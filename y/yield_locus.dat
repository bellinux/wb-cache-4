On the contrary the <b>yield</b> <b>loci</b> which result from the tension-torsion loading fulfil the Tresca yield criterion for both the quasistatic and the dynamic tests. Consequently the yield criterion changes {{with the nature of}} the load. The <b>yield</b> <b>loci</b> of the quasistatic (10 high minus 3 s high minus 1) and dynamic (10 high 2 s high minus 1) combined tension torsion-tests of austenitic steel are described by ellipses which correspond to different proof strain definitions of yielding.

Therefore the size and the shape of the <b>yield</b> <b>loci</b> are functions of strain and strain rate. The quasistatic and dynamic tension-torsion behaviour of the austenitic steel is described by Perzyna's constitutive equation.

40|$|Abstract. To {{determine}} <b>yield</b> <b>locus</b> of type 5083 aluminum-magnesium sheet at elevated temperature, biaxial tensile {{experiments were}} performed, using cruciform specimens, at various temperatures (25 - 300 ℃) at strain rates raging from 10 - 5 to 10 - 2 s- 1. From the experimental results, {{the effects of}} strain rate and temperature on the <b>yield</b> <b>locus</b> are discussed. The size of <b>yield</b> <b>locus</b> drastically decreased with increasing temperature and with decreasing strain rate. Neither von Mises ’ yield criterion or Hill’s can well predict the shape of <b>yield</b> <b>locus</b> {{of this type of}} sheet metal.

40|$|This work {{investigates the}} {{relation}} between shear stress and plastic yield considering that a crystal can only deform in a limited set of directions.

The Tresca yield criterion can be improved by averaging the shear stress over directions near the direction of maximum shear stress.

40|$|A {{continuum}} model {{based on}} the critical state theory of soil mechanics is used to generate stress and density profiles, and to compute discharge velocities for the plane flow of cohesionless materials. Two types of yield loci are employed, namely, a <b>yield</b> <b>locus</b> with a corner, and a smooth <b>yield</b> <b>locus.</b> The <b>yield</b> <b>locus</b> with a corner leads to computational difficulties. For the smooth <b>yield</b> <b>locus,</b> results {{are found to be}} relatively insensitive to the shape of the <b>yield</b> <b>locus,</b> the location of the upper traction-free surface and the density specified on this surface. This insensitivity arises from the existence of asymptotic stress and density fields, to which the solution tends to converge on moving down the hopper. Numerical and approximate analytical solutions are obtained for these fields and the latter is used to derive an expression for the discharge velocity. This relation predicts discharge velocities to within 13 % of the exact (numerical) values. While the assumption of incompressibility has been frequently used in the literature, it is shown here that in some cases, this leads to discharge velocities which are significantly higher than those obtained by the incorporation of density variation...|$|E

The tubing used has undergone progressive deformation such as extruding, plug drawing and stretching in the industrial forming process. For this reason, it has orthotropic anisotropy even after full annealing, and the initial <b>yield</b> <b>locus</b> in the tension-torsion stress field lies outside von Mises’ <b>yield</b> <b>locus.</b> Reloading tests by means of both combined axial load (tension and compression) -torsion and combined axial load-internal pressure-torsion are carried out on the fully annealed tubes subjected to prestrains in tension, torsion and combined tension-torsion. By determining the subsequent yield loci in various principal stress planes, the change in yield stress with a rotation of the principal stress axes is examined. Consequently, it is shown that anisotropic hardening (expansion, distortion and rotation of the locus) superposed kinematic hardening (translation) can be expressed precisely by the proposed yield function. words: A 1050 aluminum, Tensile prestrain, Torsional prestrain, Combined prestrain, <b>Yield</b> <b>locus,</b> Subsequent yield function...|$|E
