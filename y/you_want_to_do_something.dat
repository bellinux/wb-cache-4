While Malkmus was traveling to parts of Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East, Kannberg managed Slay Tracks release on the band's self-owned label, Treble Kicker. Slay Tracks {{caught the attention of}} Dan Koretzky, an avid record collector working at Reckless Records in Chicago. Koretzky ordered 200 copies of the EP for the record store, and asked Kannberg to sign to his newly started independent label, Drag City. At the time the members of Pavement anticipated no further releases beyond Slay Tracks, and Kannberg initially expressed reluctance to sign to any label. Kannberg later said [...] "I started talking to [...] and in our conversations he said 'I'm starting this label. Do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> for us?' I said, 'Well I don't know if we're even a band. Steve is off in Europe.' He said, [...] "Well if you want to I'm up for it.'" ...|$|E

"Marry You" [...] {{is one of}} {{the eleven}} songs {{composed}} and produced by The Smeezingtons, the collaboration of Bruno Mars, Philip Lawrence, and Ari Levine, for Mars's debut studio album, Doo-Wops & Hooligans. Lawrence explained the inspiration behind the song in an interview with American Songwriter stating, [...] "e had this image of a slow-mo video in Vegas of a couple running, and she’s in her gown and he’s in his tux, the wedding party is behind them. This sort of crazy, daring, wedding feeling". Lawrence was surprised at the impact of the song after watching some YouTube videos. He stated that [...] "e always {{thought it was a good}} song and catchy, but we didn’t think it would affect pop culture the way that it has. The first time we saw one of those YouTube videos...we were almost in tears... the power of what it is we can create. These ideas, words, and lyrics and how they can get into the fabric of society and affect people’s lives in such an amazing way." [...] In an interview with Idolator Bruno Mars said that the song had its beginning by [...] "just playing the chords," [...] and then freestyling the lyrics [...] "I think I wanna marry you!". He continued, [...] "you’re in Vegas...had way too many drinks, and you love everybody, and <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> that you probably shouldn’t do and you’ll regret in the morning." ...|$|E
500|$|A Royal Stag ad in 2011 {{featuring}} Harbhajan Singh, {{showed him}} opting to {{not work in}} his father's ball bearing factory and focus on cricket instead. The commercial ends with him asking the viewer, if with his achievements, [...] "Have I made it large?" [...] Royal Stag's rival, United Spirits Ltd's McDowell's No. 1 Platinum whisky mocked the ad in its commercial featuring Mahendra Singh Dhoni. The ad showed Harbhajan look-alike making ball bearings the size of gym balls at his father's factory, asking if he had [...] "made it large", only to get slapped by his father for being incompetent. Dhoni then tells the viewer, [...] "Zindagi main kuch karna hai to large chodo, kuch alag karo yaar" [...] (If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> in life, then forget large, do something different [...] ). The ad {{is considered to be}} a rare example of a spoof in surrogate advertising. The Economic Times quoted an industry official as saying, [...] "It is in bad taste, this type of advertising has never been used in the Indian liquor industry." [...] Harbhajan served a legal notice to United Spirits Ltd on 18 July 2011 claiming that the commercial mocked him, his family and the Sikh community. The notice was sent to Vijay Mallya, UB Executive vice-chairman SR Gupte, President & CFO Ravi Nedungadi, Deputy President Harish Bhat and Executive VP (Corporate Affairs) Nandini Verma. It was sent by Avtar Kaur, Harbhajan's mother, through his lawyers, Dewani Advocates & Consultants. Kaur stated these kinds of advertisements brought [...] "disunity and friction" [...] in the Indian cricket team and could be termed [...] "anti-national". The notice also demanded that the company publicly apologise to the family [...] "through widely-read newspapers as well as television channels prominently", remove the advertisement within three days of receiving the notice and compensation of [...] The United Breweries Group withdrew the ad on 22 July 2011 stating that had done so [...] "in the interest of the game of cricket" [...] and fearing that the commercial could be [...] "misused by vested interests to further their own agenda". The company also stated that the view of the management was that there was no maintainable case.|$|E

2500|$|Before {{the release}} of their debut album, the band {{recorded}} two demos in 1999 and 2000. In mid-2001, {{it was reported that}} Meacham had attempted suicide by drinking excessive amounts of cough syrup. The attempt affected the band's Take Action Tour. During his hospitalization he remained in poor condition and was replaced by Dameon Ash. In an interview, lead singer M. Shadows said of Meacham that [...] "he perma-fried his brain and was in a mental institution for a long time, and when you have someone in your band who does that, it ruins everything that's going on all around you, and it makes <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> to prevent it from happening to other people." [...] Avenged Sevenfold's debut album, Sounding the Seventh Trumpet, was recorded when the band members were in their late teens and still in high school. It was originally released on their first label, Good Life Recordings in 2001. When lead guitarist Synyster Gates joined the band after the album was released, the introductory track [...] "To End the Rapture" [...] was re-recorded featuring a full band element. The album was subsequently re-released on Hopeless Records in 2002. The band started to receive recognition, performing with bands such as Mushroomhead and Shadows Fall and playing on the Take Action Tour.|$|E
