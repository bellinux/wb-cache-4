It {{was not long before}} another came pop. At ten months you had four pretty white teeth, and <b>you</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> bite me. Poor mamma! Still I did not cry, because I am not a child, but you hurt me very much. So I said to papa, it is time the little girl should eat. She is not naughty, yet she hurts me. I have given her a crust of bread, and I must look for some other milk.|$|E

The lyrics {{revolve around}} the protagonist wishing for a second chance at a {{seemingly}} failed relationship. [...] "Mine Again" [...] is written in the key of B-flat major and is set in common time with a moderate dance groove with 66 beats per minute (BPM). Carey's vocal range spans three octaves from the lower note of F4 to the higher note of F7. The song includes piano keys and guitar strings {{as part of its}} instrumental composition.

500|$|In {{response}} to the motorcycles being negatively depicted on the show, a concerned viewer named Eric L. Van Duson wrote to Cycle in 1975 expressing disgust. He claimed that the portrayals of motorcycles could perhaps [...] "brainwash [...] little kids" [...] into thinking that motorcyclists are [...] "nasty". Reacting to Hanna-Barbera creating several series with vehicles serving as the main characters, such as Wheelie and the Chopper Bunch, author David Perlmutter found the use of [...] "humanized automobiles" [...] to be too predictable and repetitive. However, in a retrospective view of older cartoons, the staff at MeTV included the show on their list of [...] "15 Forgotten Cartoons from the Early 1970s <b>You</b> <b>Used</b> <b>to</b> Love".|$|E

And you will have war again: I know it. <b>You</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> fight the Maricopa. I want to go [...] to see the Maricopa and tell them: 'The Mohave will not come any more to attack you'." [...] Irataba, weary of the constant fighting and worried that further conflicts with neighboring tribes would draw more attention from the US soldiers, organized a peace expedition to the Maricopa, settling the ancient disputes between the two peoples.|$|E
500|$|Author Derek Tait {{wrote in}} his book 1970s Childhood: From Bell-Bottoms to Disco Dancing that the cartoon {{was one of the}} popular Hanna-Barbera {{productions}} of the 1970s. In a retrospective view of older cartoons, the staff at MeTV included the show on their list of [...] "15 Forgotten Cartoons from the Early 1970s <b>You</b> <b>Used</b> <b>to</b> Love". Regarding the musical aspects, Tom and Sara Pendergast felt that both The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show and Josie and the Pussycats incorporated contemporary rock music to attract a larger audience. On The Christian Science Monitors list of [...] "the five dumbest moments" [...] of The Flintstones, writer Chris Gaylord listed the series at number two.

500|$|Besides Wait Till Your Father Gets Home (1972–1974) and Hong Kong Phooey (1974), Nichola Dobson {{wrote in}} The A to Z of Animation and Cartoons that Help!... It's the Hair Bear Bunch! {{was one of}} Hanna-Barbera's more {{successful}} shows. However, in The Encyclopedia of Guilty Pleasures: 1001 Things You Hate to Love, three different authors labeled the series as one of Hanna-Barbera's [...] "lesser-known efforts" [...] but ultimately called it a [...] "guilty pleasure" [...] and enjoyed that it had its own score. In a retrospective view of older cartoons, the staff at MeTV included the show on their list of [...] "15 Forgotten Cartoons from the Early 1970s <b>You</b> <b>Used</b> <b>to</b> Love". Deirdre Sheppard from Common Sense Media rated it three out of five stars and noted that it has [...] "no educational content"; however, she also said that [...] "other than the mildest of mild violence, and the characters' tendency to poke fun at each other, the series is fun and inoffensive".|$|E
500|$|Several {{comparisons}} were {{made between the}} show and other works created by Hanna-Barbera. David Mansour, author of From Abba to Zoom: A Pop Culture Encyclopedia of the Late 20th Century, wrote in his book that Speed Buggy shared several characteristics with Hanna-Barbera's Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!. He speculated that Mark was the [...] "Freddy-esque handsome brain", Debbie was the [...] "Daphne-esque pretty girlfriend", and Tinker was the [...] "Shaggy-esque mechanic and driver". Furthermore, he considered Speed Buggy to be one the most [...] "famous dune buggies of pop culture" [...] alongside the buggies in The Funky Phantom, The Banana Splits, and the Big Jim toy line. In a retrospective view of older cartoons, the staff at MeTV included the show on their list of [...] "15 Forgotten Cartoons from the Early 1970s <b>You</b> <b>Used</b> <b>to</b> Love". On a more negative note, author David Perlmutter found Hanna-Barbera's use of [...] "humanized automobiles" [...] to be too predictable and repetitive.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{conceived}} as a [...] "rowdy pop record", both in response to Rough Trade's request for [...] "one of those pop records like <b>you</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> make" [...] {{and as a result}} of the [...] "very different atmosphere" [...] the band encountered at shows on the Love Kraft tour when the 'slow' songs from that album were played. In contrast with many Super Furry Animals albums, no samplers were used during recording of Hey Venus! as the group made a conscious decision to create a [...] "simple record" [...] which [...] "capture the spirit of the band playing live in a room". Dave Newfeld took over production duties from Mario Caldato Jr., who had worked on both Phantom Power and Love Kraft, as the band didn't want to [...] "repeat [...] past two records". As with Love Kraft, all members of the band contributed songs at the recording stage but, besides chief songwriter Gruff Rhys, only guitarist Huw Bunford ("Battersea Odyssey") and keyboard player Cian Ciaran ("Carbon Dating") ended up with their tracks on the finished album.|$|E

500|$|In a press release, Lewis {{explained}} the meaning behind [...] "Trouble": [...] "it {{tells the story}} of love going bad and becoming destructive, aspects of which we can all relate to. It’s a deeply emotional and poignant song that I have a real connection to." [...] According to the Sunday Mirror, [...] "Trouble" [...] was inspired by Lewis' break-up with her childhood sweetheart Lou Al-Chamaa. Lyrics which reference her relationship with Chamaa include the lines: [...] "I told you never to get used to me, I stay awake while you fall asleep. I'm a whole lot of trouble, we're in a whole lot of trouble. You shout louder than <b>you</b> <b>used</b> <b>to,</b> and you hold on tighter in the bedroom." [...] During an interview with Digital Spy, Lewis further explained that she was inspired and influenced by British trip-hop pioneers Massive Attack. The Suns showbiz editor Gordan Smart also picked up on the similarities, noting that [...] "Trouble" [...] sounds similar to [...] "Unfinished Sympathy" [...] (1991) and [...] "Teardrop" [...] (1998) by Massive Attack. [...] "Trouble" [...] drew comparisons to Sandé's own singles; according to Michael Cragg from The Guardian, [...] "Trouble" [...] was much like [...] "Heaven" [...] (2011) while MSN's Danielle Cheeseman compared it to Sandé collaboration with Naughty Boy, [...] "Daddy" [...] (2011).|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{after the end}} of the series. Zack Handlen {{reviewed}} the episode for The A.V. Club in April, 2010. He thought that the Ferengi were a [...] "one note" [...] opponent for the crew, but that in this episode they weren't as bad as they were in [...] "". He thought that the plot made the crew look a little silly, saying [...] "Put it this way: if somebody showed up at your door and said, [...] "Hey, we want to give you this weapon <b>you</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> murder a bunch of guys we knew years ago," [...] wouldn't you be a little suspicious?" [...] He gave the episode an overall mark of C+. James Hunt reviewed the episode for the website [...] "Den of Geek" [...] in November 2012, and said that it was the best episode of the series up until that point. He thought that little touches such as the Stargazer using the movie-era effect for warp drive was a cute touch as it was meant to be an older ship than the Enterprise but also pointed out that [...] "it also means that the Picard Manoeuvre is completely invalidated, because you literally see the ship move from point A to B before the original disappears". He felt that the conflict between Picard and Bok was well realised, and that the characterisation was good.|$|E
500|$|After {{signing with}} Columbia, many music critics {{considered}} that Smith {{lost much of}} the quality that was found in her earlier records with RCA Victor. When reviewing her compilation from her years at Columbia titled Connie Smith Sings Her Hits (1997), Thom Jurek of Allmusic commented that Smith lost much of the [...] "grain" [...] in her voice. Jurek went on to write, [...] "It could be said, that regardless of the material, she never made a bad record; the tunes were carefully chosen it's true, but she never tried to hide the hardcore twang in her vocal style." [...] In 1974 Smith released the singles [...] "I Never Knew (What That Song Meant Before)" [...] and [...] "I've Got My Baby on My Mind", which both reached No.13 on the Billboard Magazine Hot Country Singles chart. In 1975, she released her second gospel album with the label, entitled Connie Smith Sings Hank Williams Gospel, which was {{a tribute to the}} gospel material that Hank Williams recorded. That year, she also released a cover of Williams' secular [...] "Why Don't You Love Me (Like <b>You</b> <b>Used</b> <b>to</b> Do)" [...] as a single. In 1976, Smith released two cover versions of previously-made pop hits by The Everly Brothers as singles: [...] "(Till) I Kissed You" [...] and [...] "So Sad (To Watch Good Love Go Bad)". After releasing two more studio albums in 1976, Smith parted ways with Columbia Records the following year.|$|E
