2500|$|For Season 2, Koenig {{teamed up}} with Mark Boal, the Academy Award winning screenwriter of The Hurt Locker and Zero Dark Thirty, and his {{production}} company, Page 1. Boal had {{conducted a series of}} interviews with Bergdahl as part of a film production he was working on, and both Boal and Bergdahl gave Koenig permission to use those excerpts of those recorded interviews in episodes of Serial. As Koenig stated in Season 2's first episode: [...] "They'd come to us saying 'hey, we've been doing all this reporting on the story, and we've also got this tape. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> want to listen?' And yes, we did, and we were kind of blown away, and so we began working with them. They shared their research with us, and also put us in touch with many of their sources... We don't {{have anything to do with}} their movie, but Mark and Page 1 are our partners for Season 2." ...|$|E
6000|$|MISS LORE--Excuse me, Mr. Penne, for venturing a suggestion; but don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> {{state that}} in a less coarse manner? ...|$|E
6000|$|MRS. CHEVELEY. Thanks! Good evening, Lady Chiltern! Good-night, Lord Goring! I am at Claridge’s. Don’t <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> leave a card? ...|$|E
6000|$|TERESA. Do <b>you?</b> I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> {{have said}} {{something}} {{more to me than}} [...] "Is that yourself?" [...] You couldn't say less to the postman.|$|R
6000|$|... "Colonel Ray {{was telling}} me," [...] she said, [...] "how unfortunate {{you have been}} with your pupils. I wonder--don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> perhaps that <b>you</b> <b>might</b> get some others?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{was about}} to say,' resumed Miss Aldclyffe severely, 'that here is Mr. Manston waiting with the tenderest solicitude for you, and you {{overlooking}} it, {{as if it were}} altogether beneath <b>you.</b> <b>Think</b> how <b>you</b> <b>might</b> benefit your sick brother if you were Mrs. Manston. You will please me very much by giving him some encouragement. You understand me, Cythie dear?' ...|$|R
6000|$|Anne is {{so anxious}} that Ronny {{should go to}} Paris. He's made all his preparations, don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> just as well let him go? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> {{be mistaken}} in your {{identification}} of Mr. Stumpy?" [...] he replied, and I noticed that again he nearly stumbled in pronouncing the tramp's name.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. Don't you see? It was {{joy that}} killed him. Gad, {{we never thought}} of THAT! Queer, ain't it? See here, don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> make a story out of it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{no match}} for you at this game, Grace," [...] he said. [...] "Of course, I'm taking a great liberty, but if <b>you</b> <b>think</b> a little <b>you</b> <b>might</b> find some excuse for me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, that won't do! I tell {{my father}} everything; but then, I never had {{anything}} like this to tell him before. Don't <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> Jaqueline, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> break it to him? He's very fond of you. Just tell him what I told you; it's every word of it true, and he ought to know. He might see something {{about it in the}} Mercure de France." ...|$|R
6000|$|Phoebe {{burst out}} laughing. [...] "Hee-hee-hee! Thank you, sir, for a sermon {{as well as}} a sovereign. You have been most kind, indeed!" [...] She changed {{suddenly}} from irony to anger. [...] "I never was called a heathen before! Considering what I have done for <b>you,</b> I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> at least have been civil. Good afternoon, sir." [...] She lifted her saucy little snub-nose, and walked with dignity out of the room.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sounds {{like the}} Arabian Nights," [...] said Mrs. White, as {{she rose and}} began to set the supper. [...] "Don’t <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> wish for four pairs of hands for me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know about}} that, but I hope I'm not very bad. The {{long and the}} short of it is, I suppose, that <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> as well--might as well take Mr Maguire." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ain't {{much room}} in here, sure," [...] Joe would answer, with his slow grin, [...] "except for you, Daise. Me and the store are waitin' for you {{whenever}} you'll take us. Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> before long?" ...|$|E
60|$|ERNEST (with simple dignity). Do {{you mind}} if I don't cook fish to-night? (She does not mind in the least. They have all {{forgotten}} him. A lark is singing in three hearts.) I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> all be a little sorry for a chap. (But they are not even sorry, and he addresses AGATHA in these winged words:) I'm particularly disappointed in you, Aggy; seeing that I was half engaged to <b>you,</b> I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> have had the good feeling {{to be a little}} more hurt.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, grandpapa," [...] said Beatrice, {{catching}} {{hold of his}} hand, [...] "I want just {{to speak}} to <b>you.</b> Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> we <b>might</b> have a little charade-acting on Monday to enliven the evening a little?" ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{looked at}} him gloomily. [...] "Is THAT sort of tone what makes <b>you</b> pay? I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> understand," [...] she went on, [...] "that if you're to sponge on me {{successfully}} you mustn't ruin me. I must have SOME remote resemblance to a lady." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bobby," [...] said Old Mother Nature sternly, [...] "why don't you own up {{that you}} went over there to try to steal eggs? Or did <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> catch a tender young Chicken? Where were you night before last?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It {{appears to}} me, ma'am, I say, that a {{different}} sort of establishment altogether would bring out a lady of your powers. Such an establishment as your relation, Lady Scadgers's, now. Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> find some affairs there, ma'am, to interfere with?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Of course,' he said, 'I {{think we}} must have another doctor's opinion. And if we're going to have it, we had better have it at once. Egbert, do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> cycle in to Bingham for Doctor Wayne? I found him very {{satisfactory}} for Winnie's mother.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Indeed, no. I {{believe he}} was beaten, and I believe {{it was about a}} young woman. But it signifies nothing to me, and I don't suppose it signifies much to <b>you.</b> Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> we <b>might</b> fix a day, Marie?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Elfride,' he said, with a {{superficial}} archness {{which did not}} half cover an undercurrent of reproach, 'do <b>you</b> know, I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> have told me voluntarily about that past--of kisses and betrothing--without giving me so much uneasiness and trouble. Was that the tomb you alluded to as having sat on with him?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't think Martin's {{able to put}} a large sum down. I'll tell <b>you</b> what I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> ask; {{and what}} I think he would give, to get your good-will and consent to the match, and to prevent any further difficulty. I think he'd become your tenant, {{for the whole of}} your share, at a rent of five-hundred a year; and maybe he'd give you three hundred pounds for the {{furniture}} and stock, and things about the place. If so, you should give him a laise of three lives." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She is {{the very}} one I want to protect. I don't think that teazing her does any good; it only gives her cross feelings. And she really has more right on her side than <b>you</b> <b>think.</b> <b>You</b> <b>might</b> be just as honest and bold if you were less rude and bearish." ...|$|E
6000|$|The girl flushed up rosy red. [...] "If {{you could}} always remain as you are now," [...] she said after a little pause, [...] "just an impudent midshipman, I should not mind it. Do you know, Dick, they give terriers gin to prevent their growing; don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> stop yourself? It is quite sad," [...] she went on pathetically, [...] "to think that you may grow up into a great lumbering man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{had better}} {{wait till you}} find him," [...] said he, raising himself up on his arm. [...] "Come, let us {{get up and go}} home. You have asked me for my advice, and I have given it you. Do not throw {{yourself}} away upon a man because other people ask you, and because <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> as well oblige them and oblige him. If you do, you will soon live to repent it. What would you do, if after marrying this man you found there was some one you could love?" ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{turned her}} white face to me. [...] "All I know of love, all I have ever dreamt or learnt of love I have packed into these days for <b>you.</b> <b>You</b> <b>think</b> we <b>might</b> live {{together}} {{and go on}} loving. No! For you I will have no vain repetitions. You have had the best and all of me. Would you have us, after this, meet again in London or Paris or somewhere, scuffle to some wretched dressmaker's, meet in a cabinet particulier?" ...|$|R

60|$|MRS KNOX. [greatly agitated] Margaret: dont {{talk like}} that. I cant bear {{to hear you}} talking wickedly. I can bear to hear the {{children}} of this world talking vainly and foolishly {{in the language of}} this world. But when I hear you justifying your wickedness in the words of grace, it's too horrible: it sounds like the devil making fun of religion. Ive tried to bring you up to learn the happiness of religion. Ive waited for you to find out that happiness is within ourselves and doesnt come from outward pleasures. Ive prayed oftener than <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>you</b> <b>might</b> be enlightened. But if all my hopes and all my prayers are to come to this, that you mix up my very words and thoughts with the promptings of the devil, then I dont know what I shall do: I dont indeed: itll kill me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly NOT, my good friend," [...] Bertram replied, {{in a firm}} tone. [...] "Why should I, who am {{the injured}} and insulted party, assist YOU in {{identifying}} me? It was you who aggressed upon my free individuality. If {{you want to call}} in the aid of an unjust law to back up an unjust and irrational taboo, you must find out for yourself who I am, and where I come from. But I wouldn't advise you to do anything so foolish. Three of us here saw you in the ridiculous position into which by your obstinacy you compelled me to put you; and you wouldn't like to hear us recount it in public, with picturesque details, to your brother magistrates. Let me say one thing more to you," [...] he added, after a pause, in that peculiarly soft and melodious voice of his. [...] "Don't you think, on reflection--even if you're foolish enough and illogical enough really to believe in the sacredness of the taboo by virtue of which you try to exclude your fellow-tribesmen from their fair share of enjoyment of the soil of England--don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> at any rate exercise your imaginary powers over the land you arrogate to yourself with a little more gentleness and common politeness? How petty and narrow it looks to use even an undoubted right, far more a tribal taboo, in a tyrannical and needlessly aggressive manner! How mean and small and low and churlish! The damage we did your land, as you call it--if we did any at all--was certainly not a ha'pennyworth. Was it consonant with your dignity as a chief in the tribe to get so hot and angry about so small a value? How grotesque to make so much fuss and noise about a matter of a ha'penny! We, who were the aggrieved parties, we, whom you attempted to debar by main force from the common human right to walk freely over earth wherever there's nothing sown or planted, and who were obliged to remove you as an obstacle out of our path, at some personal inconvenience"--(he glanced askance at his clothes, crumpled and soiled by Sir Lionel's unseemly resistance)--"WE didn't lose our tempers, or attempt to revile you. We were cool and collected. But a taboo must be on its very last legs when it requires the aid of terrifying notices at every corner in order to preserve it; and I think this of yours must be {{well on the way to}} abolition. Still, as I should like to part friends"--he drew a coin from his pocket, and held it out between his finger and thumb with a courteous bow towards Sir Lionel--"I gladly tender you a ha'penny in compensation for any supposed harm we may possibly have done your imaginary rights by walking through the wood here." ...|$|E
60|$|Now {{there must}} be one word of Mary Lowther, and then the story shall be commenced. She {{had come to the}} vicarage in May, {{intending}} to stay a month, and it was now August, and she had been already three months with her friend. Everybody said that she was staying because she intended to become the mistress of Hampton Privets. It was a month since Harry Gilmore had formally made his offer, and as she had not refused him, and as she still stayed on, the folk of Bullhampton were justified in their conclusions. She was a tall girl, with dark brown hair, which she wore fastened in a knot {{at the back of her}} head, after the simplest fashion. Her eyes were large and grey, and full of lustre; but they were not eyes which would make you say that Mary Lowther was especially a bright-eyed girl. They were eyes, however, which could make you think, when they looked at you, that if Mary Lowther would only like you, how happy your lot would be,--that if she would love you, the world would have nothing higher or better to offer. If you judged her face by any rules of beauty, you would say that it was too thin; but feeling its influence with sympathy, you could never wish it to be changed. Her nose and mouth were perfect. How many little noses there are on young women's faces which of themselves cannot be said to be things of beauty, or joys for ever, although they do very well in their places! There is the softness and colour of youth, and perhaps a dash of fun, and the eyes above are bright, and the lips below alluring. In the midst of such sweet charms, what does it matter that the nose be puggish,--or even a nose of putty, such as <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> improve in the original material by a squeeze of your thumb and forefinger? But with Mary Lowther her nose itself was a feature of exquisite beauty, a feature that could be eloquent with pity, reverence, or scorn. The curves of the nostrils, with their almost transparent membranes, told of the working of the mind within, as every portion of human face should tell--in some degree. And the mouth was equally expressive, though the lips were thin. It was a mouth to watch, and listen to, and read with curious interest, rather than a mouth to kiss. Not but that the desire to kiss would come, when there might be a hope to kiss with favour;--but they were lips which no man would think to ravage in boisterous play. It might have been said that there was a want of capability for passion in her face, had it not been for the well-marked dimple in her little chin,--that soft couch in which one may be always sure, when one sees it, that some little imp of Love lies hidden.|$|E

[...] He brought back his eyes to her face. [...] "And the very day before they were going to let me out." [...] His feeble voice failed him altogether, the narrow compressed lips only trembling for a time before he added with that extraordinary equanimity of tone, [...] "I call it sinful." ...|$|R

I dont know why, and you know in the twenty-first century thats (not) all that important.
