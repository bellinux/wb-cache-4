Admiral Spruance could have been right. He's one of the finest officers I know of. It was his job to protect the landing force....|$|E
500|$|In {{a letter}} to General George Marshall on 24 August, Eisenhower praised Patton's {{exploits}} as commander of the Seventh Army and his conduct of the Sicily campaign, particularly his ability to take initiative as a commander. Still, Eisenhower noted Patton continued [...] "to exhibit some of those unfortunate traits of which <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> always known." [...] He informed Marshall of the two incidents and his requirement that Patton apologize. Eisenhower stated he believed Patton would cease his behavior [...] "because fundamentally, he is so avid for recognition as a great military commander that he will ruthlessly suppress any habit of his that will tend to jeopardize it." [...] When Eisenhower arrived in Sicily to award Montgomery the Legion of Merit on 29 August, Patton gave him a letter expressing his remorse about the incidents.|$|E

2500|$|The {{formation}} of the First Coalition saw Asquith display the political acuteness {{that seemed to have}} deserted him. But it came at a cost. This involved the sacrifice of two old political comrades: Churchill, who was blamed for the Dardanelles fiasco, and Haldane, who was wrongly accused in the press of pro-German sympathies. The Tories under Bonar Law made these removals a condition of entering government and, in sacking Haldane, who [...] "made no difficulty," [...] Asquith, committed [...] "the most uncharacteristic fault of (his) whole career". In a letter to Grey, Asquith wrote of Haldane; [...] "He is the oldest personal and political friend that I have in the world and, with him, <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> stood together for the best part of 30 years." [...] But he was unable to express these sentiments directly to Haldane, who was greatly hurt. Asquith handled the allocation of offices more successfully, appointing Bonar Law to the relatively minor post of Colonial Secretary, taking responsibility for munitions from Kitchener and giving it, as a new ministry, to Lloyd George and placing Balfour at the Admiralty, in place of Churchill, who was demoted to the sinecure Cabinet post of Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. Overall the Liberals held 12 Cabinet seats, including most of the important ones, while the Tories held 8. Despite this outcome, many Liberals were dismayed, the sacked Charles Hobhouse writing; [...] "The disintegration of the Liberal Party is complete. Ll.G. and his Tory friends will soon get rid of Asquith." [...] From a party, and a personal, perspective, the creation of the First Coalition was seen as a [...] "notable victory for (Asquith), if not for the allied cause". But Asquith's dismissive handling of Bonar Law also contributed to his own and his party's later destruction.|$|E

6000|$|... "Then, Bes, <b>I</b> {{think that}} <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> best go hunting {{far away in}} those lands you know, where even the Great King cannot follow us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think," [...] he said, [...] "that <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{better get}} out of the way, Sogrange, when the Count von Hern meets us at New York!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And to {{tell you}} the truth, Lady Mason, I was very glad to get it. <b>You</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> better speak openly to each other about this;--had we not?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Vervain {{began to}} whimper. [...] "You talk as if I were any better off. Have I anybody besides <b>you?</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> lost so many." ...|$|E

60|$|LORD BROCKLEHURST. In common fairness, of course, {{this should}} be remembered, that two years <b>had</b> elapsed. <b>You</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{no reason to believe}} that we should ever meet again.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he continued, [...] "that {{was written}} by our friend Graham. Do you remember, Madeline, the {{conversation}} which <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{about him in the}} library some time since?" ...|$|R

'As <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been on the same side, I don't mind telling you that I think that he ought to be released. The matter remains with the Secretary of State, who will probably be guided by the judge who tried the case.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Can it be, can it be," [...] she asked, [...] "that you too {{are trying}} to flatter me? <b>I</b> thought <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> fallen, from the first, into rather a truth-speaking vein." ...|$|R
