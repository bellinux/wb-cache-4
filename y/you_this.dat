5|$|So much {{controversy}} has swirled around my career this past decade that very little attention ever gets paid to my music. The songs {{are all but}} forgotten. While I have no regrets regarding the choices I've made artistically, I've learned to appreciate {{the idea of doing}} things in a simpler way. So without a lot of fanfare, without any distractions, I present to <b>you</b> <b>this</b> collection of ballads. Some are old, some are new. All of them are from my heart.|$|E
25|$|The {{substance}} of what I took the liberty to mention to <b>you</b> <b>this</b> morning was: You {{are on the}} borders of the grave, as well as I; shortly we must both appear before God. When it seemed to me, some months since, that my life was near an end, I was troubled that I had not dealt plainly with <b>you.</b> <b>This</b> you will permit me to do now, without any reserve, in the fear and in the presence of God.|$|E

25|$|The {{nickname}} Tijuas {{is increasingly}} popular among residents and visitors alike. Due {{to a recent}} increase in violence in the city, a new term is developing.

25|$|If {{it is so}} {{difficult}} to define terms such as 'psychology' with such precision, why bother? Why not just agree that we all have at least a rough idea of what psychology is, and take {{the rest of the afternoon}} off? After all, if theoretical or empirical work improves our understanding of some aspect of the world or our fellow people, or improves our ability to help people enhance their physical or emotional well being, what difference does it make whether this work is considered a part of psychology, of cognitive science, of behavioral neuroscience, of public health, or what have <b>you?</b> <b>This</b> raises the question of what definitions in general are good for.|$|E

Do not expect the possibility of truce or of Portuguese prisoners, as there will be no surrender rendered because I feel that our soldiers and sailors can be either victorious or dead. These words could, by their seriousness, be directed only to a soldier of higher duties fully prepared to fulfill them. God will not allow you to be the last Governor of the State of India.|$|E
