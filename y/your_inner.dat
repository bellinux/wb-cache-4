500|$|Grillo-Marxuach {{stressed}} the importance of the episode due to the discovery of the caves, which prompts the survivors to become [...] "full-time dwellers of the island." [...] Referring to the episode's Jin-Sun and Locke-Charlie storylines, Grillo-Marxuach felt that the island was about being [...] "forced to confront <b>your</b> <b>inner</b> demons [...] work out things" [...] never addressed before. Charlie's fear of bees is based on Grillo-Marxuach's life experience. Despite the character's phobia, Monaghan enjoyed working with the bees. The ones used in the episode were male drones, which meant they lacked stingers and were docile enough to easily handle. Monaghan's head and arms were covered in sticky honey to encourage the bees to land and stay on him during filming. To simulate Jack and Kate's escape from the bees, the special effects team created [...] "CG bees" [...] and then added them in post-production. Michael Zinberg directed and Sora Jung guest starred.|$|E

500|$|Reviewers {{generally}} have found less to favor in Smith's second book, Court Duel, though reviews have still been mainly positive.

[...] Ruth Cox of Emergency Librarian observed [...] "a flicker of the love/hate relationship often found in adult romance novels between Meliara and Shevraeth." [...] Contributing to Brigham Young's Children's Book and Play Review, Leah Hanson called the second part [...] "fast paced and intriguing," [...] and said it could [...] "stand on its own as an enthralling story." [...] Jo Walton believed that the second story's changing fashions and fan customs were [...] "done very well," [...] and added that the court's culture of terror felt real. She opined that [...] "Mel's eruption into their midst has in it something of the stranger coming to Versailles, and it's fascinating," [...] but called [...] "Mel's continued obliviousness to the identity of her mysterious Unknown correspondent" [...] "slightly implausible." [...] Walton concluded that the combined volume Crown Duel is [...] "a charming book with a solid background and a great first person voice. Give it to your twelve year old friends, and read it with <b>your</b> <b>inner</b> twelve-year-old eyes." [...] The publication Voice of Youth Advocates included Crown Duel in its list of [...] "fantasy for people who don't like fantasy," [...] and wrote that the novel [...] "ha few fantastical creatures, and readers will relate easily to the main characters." ...|$|E
500|$|Often renowned {{as one of}} the {{greatest}} singers in pop music, McCartney was ranked the 11th greatest singer of all time by Rolling Stone, voted the 8th greatest singer ever by NME readers and number 10 by Music Radar readers in the list of [...] "the 30 greatest lead singers of all time". He is known for his belting power, versatility and wide tenor vocal range, spanning over four octaves. Heavily influenced by Little Richard, McCartney's vocals would cross several musical genres throughout his career. On [...] "Call Me Back Again", according to Benitez, [...] "McCartney shines as a bluesy solo vocalist" [...] while MacDonald called [...] "I'm Down" [...] "a rock-and-roll classic" [...] that [...] "illustrates McCartney's vocal and stylistic versatility". MacDonald described [...] "Helter Skelter" [...] as an early attempt at heavy metal, and [...] "Hey Jude" [...] as a [...] "pop/rock hybrid", pointing out McCartney's [...] "use of gospel-style melismas" [...] in the song and his [...] "pseudo-soul shrieking in the fade-out". Benitez identified [...] "Hope of Deliverance" [...] and [...] "Put It There" [...] as examples of McCartney's folk music efforts while musicologist Walter Everett considered [...] "When I'm Sixty-Four" [...] and [...] "Honey Pie" [...] attempts at vaudeville. MacDonald praised the [...] "swinging beat" [...] of the Beatles' twenty-four bar blues song, [...] "She's a Woman" [...] as [...] "the most extreme sound they had manufactured to date", with McCartney's voice [...] "at the edge, squeezed to the upper limit of his chest register and threatening to crack at any moment." [...] MacDonald described [...] "I've Got a Feeling" [...] as a [...] "raunchy, mid-tempo rocker" [...] with a [...] "robust and soulful" [...] vocal performance and [...] "Back in the U.S.S.R." [...] as [...] "the last of [...] up-tempo rockers", McCartney's [...] "belting" [...] vocals among his best since [...] "Drive My Car", recorded three years earlier. McCartney also teasingly tried out classical singing, namely singing various renditions of [...] "Besame Mucho" [...] with the rest of The Beatles. He would continue wildly experimenting with various musical and vocal styles throughout his post-Beatles career as a solo artist, [...] "Monkberry Moon Delight" [...] being named by Pitchfork's Jayson Greene as [...] "an absolutely unhinged vocal take, Paul gulping and sobbing right next to <b>your</b> <b>inner</b> ear", adding that [...] "it could be a latter-day Tom Waits performance".|$|E

While art therapy may involve learning skills or art techniques, the emphasis is generally first on developing and expressing images that come from inside the person, rather than those he or she sees in the outside world.
