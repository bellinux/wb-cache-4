40|$|The {{influence}} of reduced water activity (aw) on lactose metabolism by Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris 2254 and 2272 was studied at different pH values. In control incubations (aw, 0. 99) with nongrowing cells in pH-controlled phosphate buffer, {{the levels of}} carbon recovered as l-(+) -lactate were 92 % at pH 6. 1 and 5. 3 and 78 % at pH 4. 5. However, the levels of recovery decreased to ∼ 50 % at all pH values tested when the aw was 0. 88 (with glycerol as the humectant). When growing cells in broth controlled at pH 6. 3 were used, {{a reduction in the}} aw from 0. 99 to 0. 96 resulted in a decrease in the level of lactose carbon recovered as l-(+) -lactate from 100 to 71 %. Low levels of l-(+) -lactate carbon recovery (< 50 %) were also observed with cells resuspended in pH-uncontrolled reconstituted skim milk at aw values of 0. 99 and 0. 87 and in <b>young</b> <b>cheese</b> curds. The missing lactose carbon could not be accounted for by acetate, ethanol, formate, acetaldehyde, or pyruvate. Attempts were made to determine where the missing lactose carbon was diverted to under the stress conditions used. Some of the missing lactose carbon was recovered as galactose (0. 1 to 2. 5 mM) in culture supernatants. Decreasing either the aw or the pH resulted in increased galactose accumulation by nongrowing cells; adjusting both environmental factors together potentiated the effect. The sensitivities of the two lactococcal strains tested were different; strain 2272 was more prone to accumulate galactose under stress conditions. A methyl pentose(s) and additional galactose were found in acid-hydrolyzed supernatants from cultures containing both growing and nongrowing cells, indicating that a saccharide(s) rich in these components was formed by lactococci under low-aw and low-pH stress conditions...|$|E

On {{the basis}} of the results got by Aminoanalyzer Beckam {{automatic}} 120 C for the influence of the ripening up to 60 days on the changes in free amino acids content of soft white cheese made from cows milk, could be concluded: According to the raw material except arginine which was not found in the milk, after producing of milk and during the ripening of the soft white cheese, the same free amino acids were identified whose content varies in very wide limits. In the <b>young</b> <b>cheese</b> (which is made only 24 hours) the content of all free amino acids decreases in accordance to the raw materials for 59. 25 %, during which the threonine and serine decrease at the most, while valine, histidine, aspartic acid, glycine and thirosine decrease with a lower inteseness. Relatively, alanine and leucine show the highest accumulation while methionine, phenilalanine, isoleucine and cystine show not so high accumulation. The highest accumulation of free amino acids during the ripening of soft white cheese, is achieved {{in the course of the}} 15 th- 30 th day, after which it decreases with higher intereness up to the 60 th day. In the course of the first 15 days leucine, phenilalanine and cystine have relatively the highest increase, but up to the 30 th day of the ripening the higher accumulation of aspartic acid, proline, glicine, alanine, methionine and valine follows. After 30 days of ripening generally the accumulation of all free amino acids decreases, so that in the 60 th day there is still leucine (78. 28 %), phenilalanine (8. 92 %), and cystine (6. 30 %), while in the rest of all free amino acids belongs 6. 50 %. According to the physiological meaning essential free amino acid in the white soft cheese was 91. 79 %, partly changeable 6. 58 % and changeable 1. 63 %.

40|$|The {{investigation}} was undertaken {{to determine the}} features of different strains of lactic streptococci (starters) associated with good or poor flavour development in Cheddar cheese. An {{attempt was made to}} differentiate the roles of the starter streptococci, other microorganisms and rennet, particularly with respect to the influence of their relative proteolytic activities on the acceptability of the cheese and the formation of bitterness. An improved agar medium was developed for the detection of proteolytic organisms in total bacterial counts, and used to assess the bacteriological quality of the milk received for cheesemaking over two dairying seasons. In spite of wide variations in the quality of the milk, the proteinases of the raw milk flora had no significant influence on the development of flavour, or off-flavours such as bitterness, in cheeses made with specific "non-bitter" or "bitter" starters. Starter strains which characteristically made good-flavoured cheese possessed either {{one or both of the}} following features: (i) low rate of cell division at the temperature of cheesemaking which resulted in relatively low numbers of cells being produced; (ii) low proteolytic activity as determined in pasteurized skim milk (PSM) cultures in the presence of 4 or 5 % NaCl. Although the total quantities of free amino acids varied between cheeses having either good flavour or bitter or "burnt" flavour defects, the proportions of individual free amino acids formed by proteolysis of the casein were very similar in all the cheeses. This suggested that the specificities of the proteinases of the different starter strains used to make these cheeses were not markedly different. A comparison of proteolysis by starter strains and by rennet in PSM under similar conditions suggests that the starters, and particularly the more active strains, contribute significantly to overall proteolysis during cheesemaking and in the <b>young</b> <b>cheese,</b> but to a lesser extent in the later stages of cheeseripening. A possible pathway of casein breakdown is suggested to explain the roles of rennet and starter in determining whether or not bitterness will be found in cheese. It is suggested that rennet proteolysis of the casein forms a pool of predominantly high MW non-bitter peptides. The extent to which the precursors are degraded by the starter proteinases determines the level of bitter peptides in the cheese. Good-flavoured cheese is associated with a low level of starter proteolysis, while more extensive proteolysis by the "bitter" starters of the non-bitter precursor peptides results in the formation of bitterness. "Burnt" off-flavours in cheese associated with the use of certain starter strains probably reflect a further degree of starter proteolysis and the accumulation of relatively high levels of amino acids. The increase in the intensity of bitterness in cheese when higher levels of rennet are used presumably results from the production of greater amounts of precursor peptides available for subsequent degradation to bitter peptides by the starter proteinases. The level of starter proteinase in the cheese appears to be the most important factor determining the development of bitterness. However, it is likely that the salt-in-moisture levels in the cheese will also exert some control on the development of bitterness since NaCl inhibited proteolysis by both rennet and starter proteinases. It is concluded that it should be possible to exert considerable control on cheese flavour merely by regulating the maximum population of starter streptococci, and hence the level of starter proteinase, attained during cheesemaking. such control would be important in reducing the incidence or intensity of bitterness in Cheddar cheese...|$|E
40|$|During {{the first}} few weeks of maturation, the texture of Cheddar-like cheeses changes {{substantially}} from an elastic material, often containing strongly oriented protein fibres from which some moisture can be expelled readily, to a uniform smooth-bodied cheese. In the past, proteolysis, particularly the cleavage of αs 1 -casein, has been invoked as an important factor in the early changes in cheese texture. However, some of the textural changes that occur early in cheese maturation {{may be related to the}} redistribution of water within the cheese matrix. To examine this, a model cheese curd system was devised and explored. Initially, cheese curd was prepared using starter and chymosin and the curd pH was controlled by varying the draining and salting pH values. The changes in water distribution, as measured by the quantity of centrifugal serum, seemed to be influenced by the cheese pH, but this could not be confirmed because of the continuing changes in cheese pH. Substitution of starter by dilute lactic acid to alter the pH value at setting provided a means of controlling the cheese pH during the 2 -week periods of study. In some trials, glucono-δ-lactone (GDL) was used to reduce the pH of the cheese to the desired level after curd manufacture. This simulated the time-dependent pH change in a normal cheese such that the effects on the water-holding capacity, microstructure and rheological properties of the cheese could be studied. This model system of cheesemaking proved to be very effective in adjusting the pH of the cheese to the desired level. In the protocol finally adopted, milk was acidified with lactic acid and coagulated with Rennilase 46 L®. After cheddaring, salting and light pressing, the curd was finely diced and mixed with GDL to give curd samples with comparable moisture contents and similar minimal casein proteolysis rates but different pH values. The quantity of centrifugal serum decreased with a decrease in the set pH of cheese curds between pH 6. 30 and pH 5. 30. The maximum quantity was obtained from cheese curd set at pH 6. 30 whereas no serum could be centrifuged from cheese curds set at pH 5. 70 or lower. The quantity of centrifugal serum was essentially constant with time for cheese curds of all set pH values. Lowering of the pH of cheese curds from the set pH by the addition of GDL also affected the quantity of centrifugal serum which decreased with a decrease in the adjusted pH value of the samples. The quantity of serum also decreased with time for all samples with adjusted pH values, the decrease being more rapid for samples with lower pH values. The set pH was also found to influence the rheological characteristics of the cheese curds. Both the maximum force, from the large strain method developed for this project (Instron), and G'(stiffness), from the small strain method (Bohlin), showed a maximum for cheese curd with a pH of 5. 90. The values for maximum force of cheese curds adjusted to lower pH values using GDL were in the same range as those of cheese curds of a similar set pH value. This suggested that the samples tended to attain a new rheological equilibrium with time that was consistent with the conditions of the lower pH value. The microstructure of the cheese curds seemed to be determined by the pH at setting as changes in structure were apparent when cheese curds were made at different set pH values but not when the pH was altered from the set pH value using GDL. The changes resulting from the alteration in pH may have been too subtle for detection by the confocal microscopy technique used. Micrographs of cheese curds from which a serum phase could be centrifuged appeared to be less compact and had open spaces in the structure where water may have been present. Such areas were absent from the micrographs of cheese curd samples from which no centrifugal serum was obtained. Overall, the present study showed that changes with time in the quantity of centrifugal serum, microstructure and some of the rheological properties in cheese curds took place even when proteolysis was at a minimum and when the pH was essentially constant. This suggests that physical changes in the cheese curd, such as redistribution of water within the cheese curd, are also important during the initial stages of ripening and probably contribute to the differences in rheological properties observed in <b>young</b> <b>cheese...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to fortify 50 % reduced fat Cheddar cheese with n- 3 fatty acids and evaluate whether this fortification generated specific off-flavors in the cheese. Docosahexaenoic (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic (EPA) fatty acids were added to the cheese to obtain 3 final fortification levels [18, 35, and 71 mg of DHA/EPA per serving size (28 g) of cheese] representing 10, 20, and 40 % of the suggested daily intake level for DHA/EPA. The presence of oxidized, rancid, and fishy flavors as a function of fortification level and cheese aging (6 mo) was evaluated using a sensory descriptive panel. No differences were found in the oxidized and rancid flavors as a consequence of DHA/EPA fortification, with only slight intensities of these flavors. The presence of fishy off-flavor was dependent on the fortification level. Cheeses with low fortification levels (18 and 35 mg of DHA/EPA per serving size) did not develop significant fishy off-flavor compared with the control, whereas at the highest fortification level (71 mg of DHA/EPA per serving size) the fishy off-flavor was significantly stronger in <b>young</b> <b>cheeses.</b> The fishy flavor decreased as a function of age and became nonsignificant compared with the control at 3 mo of storage.

40|$|In this work, {{we studied}} the growth, {{survival}} and peptidolytic activity of Lactobacillus plantarum I 91 in a hard-cheese model {{consisting of a}} sterile extract of Reggianito cheese. To assess {{the influence of the}} primary starter and initial proteolysis level on these parameters, we prepared the extracts with cheeses that were produced using two different starter strains of Lactobacillus helveticus (Lh 138 or Lh 209) at three ripening times: 3, 90 and 180 days. The experimental extracts were inoculated with Lb. plantarum I 91; the control extracts were not inoculated, and the blank extracts were heat-treated to inactivate enzymes and were not inoculated. All extracts were incubated at 34 ºC for 21 days, and then the pH, microbiological counts and proteolysis profiles were determined. The basal proteolysis profiles in the extracts of <b>young</b> <b>cheeses</b> made with either strain tested were similar, but many differences between the proteolysis profiles of the extracts of the Lh 138 and Lh 209 cheeses were found when riper cheeses were used. The pH values in the blank and control extracts did not change, and no microbial growth was detected. In contrast, the pH value in experimental extracts decreased, and this decrease was more pronounced in extracts obtained from either of the <b>young</b> <b>cheeses</b> and from the Lh 209 cheese at any stage of ripening. Lb. plantarum I 91 grew up to 8 log during the first days of incubation in all of the extracts, but then the number of viable cells decreased, the extent of which depended on the starter strain and the age of the cheese used for the extract. The decrease in the counts of Lb. plantarum I 91 was observed mainly in the extracts in which the pH had diminished the most. In addition, the extracts that best supported the viability of Lb. plantarum I 91 during incubation had the highest free amino acids content. The effect of Lb. plantarum I 91 on the proteolysis profile of the extracts was marginal. Significant changes in the content of free amino acids suggested that the catabolism of free amino acids by Lb. plantarum I 91 prevailed in a weakly proteolysed medium, whereas the release of amino acids due to peptidolysis overcame their catabolism in a medium with high levels of free amino acids. Lb. plantarum I 91 was able to use energy sources other than lactose to support its growth because equivalent numbers of cells were observed in extracts containing residual amounts of lactose and in lactose-depleted extracts. The contribution of Lb. plantarum I 91 to hard-cooked cheese peptidolysis was negligible compared to that of the starter strain; however, its ability to transform amino acids is a promising feature of this strain.

40|$|Differences in texture at any {{particular}} stage of ripening depend upon {{differences in the}} basic structure {{and the extent to}} which the basic structure is modified by physical parameters. Thus, very <b>young</b> <b>cheeses</b> of the same variety differ in texture because of variations in pH and in salt, moisture, and fat content. How well a cheese melts and shreds depend on its texture and physical parameters. Streptococcus thermophilus MR 1 C produces an exopolysaccharide (EPS) that is tightly associated with the bacterial cell wall. Addition of S. thermophilus MR 1 C to the cheese make will increase the moisture of the cheese 2 - 3 % and thus affect the texture, melt, and shreddability of that cheese. To determine the effect of S. thermophilus MR 1 C on the texture, melt, and shreddability of cheese, two stirred-curd cheeses with equivalent physical parameters using BPS-producing S. thermophilus MR 1 C or non-BPS-producing S. thermophilus DM 10 adjunct cultures were produced. Because MR 1 C cheese would increase moisture, the curd size, wash water temperature, and pH at salting had to be altered in order to make the physical parameters the same for both cheeses. The MR 1 C cheese was harder and had a higher fracture stress than the DM 10 cheese. The MRlC cheese was also more adhesive, but only for one of the two trials. Even with adjustments in the method of manufacture, the MR 1 C cheese still had a slightly higher SM and pH, which may be partly responsible for the differences between the two cheeses. There were no differences between the MRlC cheese and the DM 1 0 cheese in shreddability as determined by fines, stickiness, and gumminess.

Though similar to Parmigiano Reggiano <b>cheese,</b> the <b>younger</b> Grana Padano <b>cheeses</b> are less crumbly, milder and less complex in flavor than their better known, longer-aged relative.|$|R
40|$|Soft-ripened cheeses {{belong to}} the type of food most often {{contaminated}} with Listeria monocytogenes, and they have been implicated in several outbreaks of listeriosis. Bacteriophages represent an attractive way to combat foodborne pathogens without affecting other properties of the food. We used the broad host range, virulent Listeria phage A 511 for control of L. monocytogenes during the production and ripening phases of both types of soft-ripened cheeses, white mold (Camembert-type) cheese, as well as washed-rind cheese with a red-smear surface (Limburger-type). The surfaces of <b>young,</b> unripened <b>cheese</b> were inoculated with 101 – 103 cfu/cm 2 L. monocytogenes strains Scott A (serovar 4 b) or CNL 103 / 2005 (serovar 1 / 2 a). Phage was applied at defined time points thereafter, in single or repeated treatments, at 3 × 108 or 1 × 109 pfu/cm 2. With Scott A (103 cfu/cm 2) and a single dose of A 511 (3 × 108 pfu/cm 2) on camembert-type cheese, viable counts dropped 2. 5 logs {{at the end of the}} 21 day ripening period. Repeated phage application did not further inhibit the bacteria, whereas a single higher dose (1 × 109 pfu/cm 2) was found to be more effective. On red-smear cheese ripened for 22 days, Listeria counts were down by more than 3 logs. Repeated application of A 511 further delayed re-growth of Listeria, but did not affect bacterial counts after 22 days. With lower initial Listeria contamination (101 – 102 cfu/cm 2), viable counts dropped below the limit of detection, corresponding to more than 6 logs reduction compared to the control. Our data clearly demonstrate the potential of bacteriophage for biocontrol of L. monocytogenes in soft cheese...|$|R
40|$|In {{an answer}} to the survey, 40 % of the {{surveyed}} girls and 82 % of boys declared regular eating of three or four main meals a day. Only 31 % of the young people drank milk or milk beverages regularly, and almost half of the surveyed youth ate raw vegetables and fruit every day. Similar percentage had fish as well as poultry in their menu 1 – 2 times a week and about one fourth of the surveyed group: 3 – 4 times a week. Snacking (mainly fruit, sandwiches, crisps) between main meals was declared by 85 % of the surveyed. As many as 97 % of the surveyed young people ate fast food, {{but at the same time}} 100 % of the surveyed girls and 95 % of the boys expressed an opinion that this is not “healthy ” food. Most preferred products were: pizza – 76 % of the surveyed <b>young</b> people, open <b>cheese</b> and mushroom toasted sandwich with ketchup – 54 %, Big Mac – 43 %. A convenient form of consumption, attractiveness, taste and accessible price were regarded by most of the surveyed as great advantages of these products...|$|R
5000|$|His weekly show {{went into}} {{national}} syndication in a two-hour all-novelty format in 1974, produced by his manager Larry Gordon of Gordon/Casady and during 1978-92 was syndicated by the Westwood One Radio Network. The Westwood One period marked {{the height of}} the show's national popularity; it was carried in most major radio markets, airing mainly on FM rock stations, usually late on Sunday evenings. The producer Westwood One assigned to work with Hansen from 1978 to 1982 was Lynnsey Guererro, a former track star from UCLA and Senior Producer at the company. In 1982, he handed off the show to a new producer from San Diego, professional journalist Robert Young. It was under Young's guidance that the show gained in popularity, mainly due to his willingness to foster relationships with national media and with nationally known and up-and-coming artists, including John Mammoser, Judy Tenuta, Emo Philips, Pinkard and Bowden, Wally Wingert, and Mark Davis (Richard <b>Cheese).</b> <b>Young</b> accompanied Dr. Demento to Portland, Ore.; Dallas, Texas; New York City; San Diego; Montreal; Phoenix; and other cities to do live performances and PR Events, taking photos, setting up interviews and even 'running the board' at some of the live shows. He left the radio network in 1990 during a business downturn. In January 2014 Young released an e-book titled [...] "Producing Demento," [...] about his memories of working on the show.|$|R
