500|$|... "Through the Rain" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics; many complimented Carey's restrained vocal performance, {{as well as}} the song's simple instrumental accompaniment, while others criticized it for being overly-dramatic. Jon Pareles of The New York Times described it as [...] "inspirational", and felt that due to its vagueness, the song is would be applicable to all listeners, not just Carey. The Daily Unions David Germain commented how the song's simple musical arrangement and Carey's [...] "restrained" [...] vocal delivery aided it in becoming [...] "modest and reserved". Writing for Billboard, Michael Paoletta chose [...] "Through the Rain" [...] as a top pick from the album, as did Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine. He described it as a song that was designed as [...] "'Vision of Love' meets 'Hero'", and wrote, [...] "Mariah is back in the adult contemporary camp, no longer trying to prove that she's real." [...] Cara DiPasquale from the Chicago Tribune called it a [...] "powerhouse ballad", while Entertainment Weeklys Tom Sinclair wrote [...] "embellished with her trademark vocal pyrotechnics, it is one of those highly personal songs about finding <b>your</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> an emotional wilderness, but it sinks in its own sodden sentimentality". Similarly, a writer from Newsday also described [...] "Through the Rain" [...] as a [...] "powerhouse ballad", and felt it was reminiscent of Carey's previous single [...] "One Sweet Day" [...] (1995). Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Randy Lewis noted how the song was able to effectively take listeners right into Carey's personal struggles from the previous year. Tina Brown from Newsweek felt that while Carey's personal troubles may not have been fully solved, the song made her appear [...] "strong and triumphant".|$|E

2500|$|On October 31, 2008, Petraeus assumed {{command of}} the United States Central Command (USCENTCOM) {{headquartered}} in Tampa, Florida. Petraeus was responsible for U.S. operations in 20 countries spreading from Egypt to Pakistan—including Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom. During his time at CENTCOM, Petraeus advocated that countering the terrorist threats in the CENTCOM region requires more than just counter-terrorism forces, demanding instead whole-of-governments, comprehensive approaches akin to those of counterinsurgency. One of his closest colleagues said that Petraeus knew that defeating an insurgency required living among the people, convincing them that we were better than the insurgents.

This {{arrangement}} may be according to the Californian code of morality, but it doesn't accord with my Eastern ideas of right and wrong. If this foolish, wretched creature chooses to abandon all claim upon you, chooses to run away from you,--why, I suppose, as a GENTLEMAN, according to your laws of honor, you are absolved. Good-night, Mr. Alexander Morton. (Goes to door C., and exit, pushing out STARBOTTLE, the DUCHESS, and child. MR. OAKHURST sinks into chair at desk, burying his face in his hands.

6000|$|Haldane {{nodded to}} {{emphasize}} his remarks {{as he leaned}} forward towards me. [...] "The man you were hunting was handled in a similar fashion, and it naturally made him savage.

I am only a young girl, to be sure; but I am not quite such a fool as you take me for. Do you really think I don't know that Miss Jillgall has been telling you everything that is bad about me; putting every mistake that I have made, every fault that I have committed, in the worst possible point of view? And you have listened to her--quite naturally! And you are prejudiced, strongly prejudiced, against me--what else could you be, under the circumstances? I don't complain; I have purposely kept <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>way,</b> and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Miss Jillgall's way; in short, I have afforded you every facility, as the prospectuses say.

40|$|The {{exhibition}} {{consisted of}} four components. 1. The Lost and Found is an interactive digital archive, featuring all known artworks sited in Grizedale Forest {{for a week}} or more, since 1977. It deliberately fuses the artworks with the place that they were created for. The Lost and Found archive aims to echo the experience of trying to find the sculptures when walking through Grizedale – some are extremely difficult to find, whilst others are very accessible. Lost and Found has videos of interviews embedded within it, which literally give the artists a voice. The interviews present a rooted perspective on how and why specific sculptures were created, whilst also revealing a wider perspective on how the residencies have changed over the years. 2. The Lost Tour Guide suit. This handmade suit was worn by Edwina to interview visitor's to the Forest. It was printed with the OS map of the map of the area, with Grizedale {{on the back of the}} jacket. This meant that Edwina could help navigate other people around the Forest, but could not do so herself without taking off the jacket. 3. The Missing Persons’ Files wall panels show the chronology of the Grizedale artists’ residencies, which were set up in 1977 by Peter Davies from Northern Arts (the then Regional Arts Association for northern England), in liaison with Bill Grant from Grizedale Forestry Commission. They track the different approaches to sited practice over the 5 decades. 4. Anxious Roots and Routes The first thing that Edwina did when she arrived at Grizedale was to head out and attempt to enter the Forest accompanied by a 5. 5 foot (1. 6 metre) red balloon. She continued this over the cycle of a year, simultaneously shooting these attempts from two perspectives – one of the cameras was suspended in a harness under the balloon; the other was sited on the ground. The Anxious Roots and Routes videos aim to visualise how a city dweller, who is new to the Forest, might feel when entering it for the first time. Would they feel exhilaration, or anxiety? If it is the latter, what form might that anxiety take? A fear of the forest itself, rooted in old fairytales? A fear of getting lost and not being able to find <b>your</b> <b>way</b> <b>out?</b> A fear <b>of</b> sudden or unexpected change caused by events such a storms or felling? A fear of losing everything as a result of tree disease or the effects of climate change? In the videos, Edwina is dressed in her “city” clothes. The red balloon is a metaphor for anxiety. It is the equivalent of a red map pin, saying “HELP. I’M HERE”. It was easily punctured, which caused very real anxiety when floating a state-of-the-art HD video camera 6 metres above the ground amidst sharp branches. The two cameras produced very different readings of the Forest...|$|R
