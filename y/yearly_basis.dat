The Labour Parliament was partly a response to a lock-out of around 20,000 mill workers by the employers in Preston; its aim was to organise a levy on wages to support operatives who went on strike or were locked out. Those paying the levy were to elect a committee to buy and look after land and factories and the Parliament would meet on a <b>yearly</b> <b>basis.</b> However, the plan did not gain support among all Chartists and the plans never materialised.|$|E

5|$|Before a {{property}} is {{inscribed on the}} List of World Heritage in Danger, its condition is assessed and a potential programme for corrective measures is developed {{in cooperation with the}} State Party involved. The final decision about inscription is made by the committee. Financial support from the World Heritage Fund may be allocated by the committee for listed properties. The state of conservation is reviewed on a <b>yearly</b> <b>basis,</b> after which the committee may request additional measures, delete the property from the list if the threats have ceased or consider deletion from both the List of World Heritage in Danger and the World Heritage List. Of the two Former UNESCO World Heritage Sites, the Dresden Elbe Valley was delisted after placement on the List of World Heritage in Danger while the Arabian Oryx Sanctuary was directly delisted. As of 2017, there are 54 entries (17 natural, 37 cultural) on the List of World Heritage in Danger. Some sites have been designated as World Heritage Sites and World Heritage in Danger in the same year, such as the Church of the Nativity, traditionally considered to be the birthplace of Jesus. Arranged by the UNESCO regions 22 of the listed sites are located in the Arab States (of which 7 are located in Syria and 5 in Libya), 15 in Africa (of which 5 are in the Democratic Republic of the Congo), 7 in Latin America and the Caribbean, 6 in Asia and the Pacific, and 4 in Europe and North America (all by 2017).

40|$|In this study, {{we examine}} the effect of mutual fund connections, through {{managerial}} sharing, on performance and stock holding commonalities. Our analysis of return correlations and portfolio holdings indicates that more interconnected funds tend to buy and sell similar stocks, hence increasing the similarity of portfolio holdings and undermining the distinctiveness of their investment strategy. Our results also indicate that highly connected funds significantly underperform weakly connected funds by about 1. 4 % on a <b>yearly</b> risk-adjusted <b>basis.</b> We show that fund family performance is unaffected by the intensity of fund connections, and that greater fund connections could significantly enhance family-level profit margins. 29 page(s...|$|R

To this aim, we make use of an extensive long-term dataset of RAdiosonde OBServations (RAOBS), collected in 14 sites spread across Europe, to calculate the reference monthly attenuation statistics due to clouds and water vapour. Results indicate that the prediction of P(AC) degrades both with the increase in frequency and switching from <b>yearly</b> to monthly <b>basis,</b> while on the other hand, ITU-R P. 676 - 10 offers a much more accurate estimate of P(AV), being almost independent of the frequency and the temporal scale. In addition, while Recommendation P. 676 - 10 provides a fairly stable performance regardless of the month, P. 840 - 6 tends to offer slightly more accurate predictions for May to July...|$|R
