5|$|We write jokes, and {{the jokes}} are funny. With a game, the fourth, fifth, sixth, 80th, 100 millionth time you've seen that joke it becomes not funny, then <b>you</b> <b>lose</b> faith in it, {{and then you}} {{question}} it, and you go round this emotional circle...We've always liked fresh-baked stuff a little better but, with a video game, it doesn't work that way. But the game isn't just a collection of funny South Park scenes, hopefully it's more than that.|$|E

25|$|How can a man {{lose the}} Tour de France {{because of an}} {{accident}} to his bike? I can't understand it. The rule should be changed so that a rider with no chance of winning can give his bike to his leader, or {{there should be a}} car with several spare bicycles. <b>You</b> <b>lose</b> the Tour de France when you find someone better than you are. You don't lose it through a stupid accident to your machine. Next year Desgrange modified the rules.|$|E
25|$|A {{replacement}} for lost or stolen cards costs £15 and involves {{applying for a}} replacement card online or by calling the Oyster helpline. A new photograph is not required. The funds or remaining travel is non-transferable to a new student Oyster photocard and is refundable instead. The refund of a lost or stolen Oyster card {{is based on the}} original pro-rata daily rate. Thus, if <b>you</b> <b>lose</b> an annual student Oyster, the refund will not cover the remainder of the year, owing to the higher monthly/weekly pro-rata charges {{for the remainder of the}} year. This can leave students at a considerable disadvantage (adults can receive a replacement card with the remainder of their Travelcard loaded).|$|E

It's a big part of the {{captaincy}} so everyone knows where they stand. A happy team turns into a confident team and wins matches. But I have a hell of a lot to learn.

25|$|Cross a brook, and <b>you</b> <b>lose</b> the King of England; but {{you have}} some comfort in coming again under his Majesty, though 'shorn of his beams,' {{and no more than}} Prince of Wales. Go to the north, and you find him dwindled to a Duke of Lancaster; turn to the west of that north, and he pops upon you in the humble {{character}} of Earl of Chester. Travel a few miles on, the Earl of Chester disappears, and the King surprises you again as Count Palatine of Lancaster. If you travel beyond Mount Edgecombe, you find him once more in his incognito, and he is Duke of Cornwall... every one of those Principalities has the apparatus of a Kingdom for the jurisdiction over a few private estates, and the formality and charge of the Exchequer of Great Britain for collecting the rents of a country squire. Cornwall is the best of them.|$|E
500|$|In an on-set {{interview}} with The Huffington Post, actor John Noble {{explained that the}} episode's primary storyline concerned the bridge between the two worlds. The third season finale, he explained, ended with the two universes healing themselves {{with the help of}} a [...] "bridge". He remarked, [...] "What happens if that bridge now begins to be used as a conduit for evil? That’s the issue we’re facing. What do you do? What do you do with this wonderful discovery? Do you keep it? What do <b>you</b> <b>lose</b> if <b>you</b> <b>lose</b> it? For example, if we didn’t have that , we... wouldn’t have all these wonderful characters that we’ve grown to love. What would happen? I think we have to face that issue. We have to face the issue of 'How long can you keep this alive, this link between interlacing the two universes?'" ...|$|E

500|$|Basically, I {{like any}} music that remains simple and I {{feel this is}} the formula that makes [...] "soul music" [...] successful.

There is beauty in simplicity whether {{you are talking about}} architecture, art or music.|$|E
500|$|The UK {{government}} introduced extensive {{economic and}} political sanctions against Rhodesia and indicated that any dialogue had to take place through Gibbs. Beadle was told to liaise with Lardner-Burke regarding any proposals Smith's government might have. Beadle would later recount that the post-UDI government briefly threatened him, telling him to [...] "go now, otherwise <b>you</b> <b>lose</b> your job", but he was ultimately left alone. The Chief Justice noted in his diary that Smith's government was [...] "not prepared to force [...] showdown with the judges".|$|E
500|$|Another {{recurrent}} {{theme in}} the album is that everything is broken, out of place or missing; This is apparent in nearly all songs in the album. Examples include [...] "Fix You" [...] ("When <b>you</b> <b>lose</b> something you can't replace") and also in [...] "X" [...] ("When something is broken, {{and you try to}} fix it, trying to repair it, any way you can") and [...] "Talk" [...] ("Are you lost or incomplete? Do you feel like a puzzle, you can't find your missing piece?"). This theme is also reflective of the random, incomprehensible pattern on the album's cover (until you [...] "fix" [...] it using the Baudot Code).|$|E

Lohan {{became involved in the}} documentary after meeting Sahota at a social event and expressing her interest in doing it. Sahota stated that he {{was under the impression that}} Lohan chose to participate in the documentary [...] "as a result of working in an adult world since she was ten, she feels childhood is precious, and when <b>you</b> <b>lose</b> one you can never replace those years". He also stated that the people they met in rural India were not previously familiar with Lohan.|$|E
500|$|... nstead of {{rewriting}} the game, I thought, well maybe {{it should be}} dwarves instead. And it should be real-time to combat the [...] problem. Now, you'd be digging out minerals in a mountain, combating threats inside, and making little workshops. Then I thought, well, how should the high score list work? We really like to keep records of plays. Not just high score lists, but expansive logs. So we'll often {{try to think of}} ways to play with the idea. This time, the idea was to let your adventurer come into the fortress after <b>you</b> <b>lose</b> and find the goblets you've made, and journals it generates.|$|E
500|$|However, {{the film}} met with mixed {{reactions}} from other critics. Rob Gonsalves of eFilmCritic.com gave the film a positive review, but commented, [...] "When you strip the 007 films down for action and 'realism,' <b>you</b> <b>lose</b> {{the soul of}} those old beloved Bond movies – {{they might as well}} be Jason Bourne movies." [...] John Beifuss of The Commercial Appeal said, [...] "Who wants to see Bond learn a lesson about ego, as if he were Greg Brady in his 'Johnny Bravo' phase?" [...] Anthony Lane of The New Yorker criticised the more imperfect and self-aware depiction of the character, saying, [...] "Even James Bond, in other words, wants to be 007." ...|$|E

[...] In 2007, she {{became a member of}} the board of directors for Chernobyl Children's Project International, a role that would give her a voice in the organisation's policy making. In 2009, she staged a public abseil of the 17-storey Elysian Tower in Cork to raise funds for the organisation.|$|E
500|$|He {{was exposed}} to {{traditional}} flamenco music as a child while vacationing each summer in his parents' native Andalusia in southern Spain. Originally, Sanz intended to become a flamenco performer, but he found the music teachers to be overly strict. Commenting on his early experiences, Sanz explained, [...] "Flamenco can be very hard on beginners. If <b>you</b> <b>lose</b> the rhythm, they toss you out with, 'You're no good, boy!' They're very strict and very cruel. But it's also a marvelous education, because you either learn to play or else." [...] He felt {{that he could not}} compete with his peers, and decided to focus on creating pop music with flamenco influences, viewing flamenco to be a [...] "lifestyle" [...] better suited to others.|$|E
500|$|A triumvirate of gangster {{pictures}} were {{released in the}} early 1930s—Little Caesar (1931), The Public Enemy (1931), and Scarface (1932)—which were built on the template created by the first gangster movie, 1927's Underworld. All featured the rise and eventual fall of an organized criminal. As described by crime film scholar Jack Shadoian the maxim became, [...] "If the films insist that one can’t win, under that given it’s how <b>you</b> <b>lose</b> that counts." [...] Scarface was the most controversial and violent; the film took nearly a year to reach theaters due to battles with censors. Obviously based {{on the life of}} Al Capone, Scarface and others like it outraged civic leaders who felt that movies were glorifying the lifestyles of criminals.|$|E
