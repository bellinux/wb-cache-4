500|$|The web-video series Extra Credits {{recommended}} it on one {{of their}} [...] "Games <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> tried" [...] episodes, praising it for challenging the player to examine their beliefs, and commenting that being good at the game itself [...] "requires the same sort of paranoid genius that the game itself is trying to warn against." ...|$|E
2500|$|Amos' {{brother died}} in a car crash in 2005 and it is widely {{believed}} that the song that closes the album, Our New Year, deals with her own thoughts and feelings behind his tragic demise. However, when asked, Amos chose to keep the meaning of the song private, [...] "I think {{at this time of year}} you think of people that might not be in your life anymore or who’ve left the planet. I get really nostalgic at Christmas, and memories of other times with other people who <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> heard from in a long time can cross your mind." [...] Finally, when asked pointedly if she had anyone in mind when writing the song, Amos responded definitively, [...] "I did. But, we’ll leave it there." [...] "People get nostalgic and you have to acknowledge that there are people that aren’t with you anymore, so there’s a song that does that. But," [...] Amos insisted, [...] "for the most part, for a Tori record, it’s pretty upbeat." ...|$|E

2500|$|Game Informers Matt Helgeson scored it 7.75 out of 10, {{calling it}} [...] "still the same flawed game that was {{released}} for the current-gen systems." [...] Eurogamer's Kristan Reed scored it 6 out of 10, writing [...] "the changes and improvements are so minor that <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> noticed them were they not written down for you. Tellingly, {{none of them}} really address the fundamental gripes that dragged the game down in the first place." [...] He was critical of the graphics, arguing [...] "the game looks like a port from the word go. The low-poly character models, stilted animation and bland texture detail of the original is exposed even more once you see it running in high def." [...] He concluded [...] "the core of The Godfather can be quite harmlessly entertaining. Like so many openworld games, there's a moreishness to it that keeps you going even when so many alarm bells are ringing about where EA went wrong. But let's face it, The Godfather should have been far better than it is." ...|$|E

I ought to tell you, I think, {{that as soon as}} I reached home I wrote out, as accurately as I could from memory, the gist of your remarks. And I must say frankly, although I try to put it mildly, that they appear to contradict and controvert the doctrines of the Church." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed they have; we chased {{them the}} matter of half a mile, an' then {{concluded}} it was time we got the story from <b>you,</b> for it <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been safe to pass the first drift." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "True!" [...] {{said the}} poor girl, almost confounded with her horror at {{the charge against}} her, amid the {{violence}} of the man. [...] "True! Oh! Sir, for mercy's sake, tell me what it is of which you accuse me--tell me what it is that I have done. No man has spoken of you behind your back words which <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> yourself <b>have</b> heard. No man has desired me to ask you to spare the rebels. No man has even dared to hint to me, that I should do or say ought in opposition to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And, Rachel, {{now that}} {{money has been}} once so intended; suppose it kept its destination. About £500 would put up a tidy little {{industrial}} school, and <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> object to <b>have</b> a scholarship or two for some of our little --th Highlander lassies whose fathers won't make orphans of them for the regular military charities. What, crying, Rachel! Don't you like it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You look {{as though}} <b>you</b> <b>might,</b> and <b>had,</b> <b>not</b> so long ago," [...] replied Leo, fixing his gaze on the old man's waxen face and uneasy eyes.

"To comfort you, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been farther forward {{than you}} are now, Mr. Saddletree," [...] replied Mr. Butler; [...] "for our Scottish advocates are an aristocratic race.

6000|$|... "Oh dear no," [...] said Mrs. Gascoigne, [...] "it {{would be}} much less appropriate, <b>You</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> a bedroom to yourself." [...] And Gwendolen's {{memories}} of school suggested other particulars which forced her to admit to herself that this alternative would be no relief. She turned to her uncle again and said, apparently in acceptance of his ideas-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Forgive me," [...] I said. [...] "I {{could not}} help it, but I had been {{thinking}} that it was of dear Lucy that you wished to ask, and so that <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> time to wait, not on my account, but because I know your time must be precious, I have written {{it out on the}} typewriter for you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You see, Sir Guy,' said he, 'there {{was some}} of us thought <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> like to <b>have</b> us coming and singing like old times, 'cause 'tis not all {{as it used to}} be here with you. Yet we didn't like not to come at all, when you had been away so long, so we settled just to begin, and see whether you took any notice.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{you did it}} once before, and {{you have}} had a steady income to live on ever since; not such an income as <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>had.</b> <b>Not</b> such an income as will do for you and me, now that we both know so well what a fine {{property}} we have under our thumbs. But, nevertheless, that little visit has been worth something to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I {{want you}} to realise Sally. Right or wrong, she's fond of the man. Of course, I've told you this already, but I must {{try to make it}} clear how that fact bears upon the {{business}} in hand. Sally certainly fought for him, and there's no doubt that one could find fault with several things she did; {{but the point is that}} she's evidently determined on making the most of him now she has got him. In some respects, at least, she's absolutely straight--one hundred cents to the dollar is what Allen says of her--and although <b>you</b> <b>might</b> perhaps <b>not</b> <b>have</b> expected this, I believe it would hurt her horribly to feel that Gregory was squandering money that didn't strictly belong to him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Forgive me if I seem inquisitive, but I {{find the}} {{situation}} a little unusual. You were my guest, you see, {{and had it}} not been for my chance invitation <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> met that man at all. Then again, {{had it not been}} for my interference he would have been dead now and you would have been in a fair way to be hanged." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ell, how silly this is!' he said indignantly. 'Running {{away from}} home--I never heard such a thing! Of course I am not jealous of this unfortunate man; {{but it is}} too ridiculous that you, a married woman with three {{children}} and a fourth coming, should go losing your head like this over a dead lover!

6000|$|... 'I {{said that}} it was better as it is!' she whispers, as she holds me in her arms. 'Oh, Doady, after more years, you never could have loved your child-wife better than you do; and, after more years, she would so have tried and {{disappointed}} you, that <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been able to love her half so well!

In short, I played the eavesdropper--I, Marcel Saint-Pol de Bardelys. Yet, if you who read and are nice-minded, shudder at this confession, or, worse still, shrug your shoulders in contempt, with the reflection that such former conduct of mine as I have avowed had already partly disposed you against surprise at this I do but ask that you measure my sin by my temptation, and think honestly whether in my position <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> yourselves <b>have</b> fallen. Aye--be you never so noble and high-principled--I make bold {{to say that you}} had done no less, for the voice that penetrated to my ears was that of Roxalanne de Lavedan.|$|R
6000|$|To {{pass from}} Becket to Joyfields {{was really a}} {{singular}} experience. At Becket you were certainly supposed {{to do exactly what}} you liked, but the tyranny of meals, baths, scents, and other accompaniments of the 'all-body' regime soon annihilated every impulse to do anything but just obey it. At Joyfields, bodily existence was a kind of perpetual skirmish, a sort of grudged accompaniment to a state of soul. <b>You</b> <b>might</b> be alone in the house at any meal-time. <b>You</b> <b>might</b> or <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> water in your jug. And as to baths, you had to go out to a little white-washed shed at the back, with a brick floor, where you pumped on yourself, prepared to shout out, [...] "Halloo! I'm here!" [...] in case any one else came wanting to do the same. The conditions were in fact almost perfect for seeing more of one another. Nobody asked where you were going, with whom going, or how going. <b>You</b> <b>might</b> be away by day or night without exciting curiosity or comment. And yet you were conscious of a certain something always there, holding the house together; some principle of life, or perhaps--just a woman in blue. There, too, was that strangest of all phenomena in an English home--no game ever played, outdoors or in.|$|R
6000|$|... "MY DEAR LORD BRACY,--When I learned, through Mary's mother, that Carstairs {{had been}} here in our absence and made a {{declaration}} of love to our girl, I was, I must confess, annoyed. I felt, in the first place, {{that he was too}} young to have taken in hand such a business as that; and, in the next, that <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> unnaturally <b>have</b> been angry that your son, who had come here simply for tuition, should have fallen into a matter of love. I imagine that you will understand exactly what were my feelings. There was, however, nothing to be said about it. The evil, so far as it was an evil, had been done, and Carstairs was going away to Oxford, where, possibly, he might forget the whole affair. I did not, at any rate, think it necessary to make a complaint to you of his coming.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes;--she was here. Sir Alured did not come. I don't {{wonder at}} that, however. And {{your mother was}} in town some time ago,--but I didn't expect her to come. Why should they come? I don't know whether <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> better stayed away. Of course I am a Pariah now; but Pariah as I am, I shall {{be as good as}} any one else in Guatemala. You have seen Everett since he has been in town, perhaps?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. I {{feel that}} a little myself, because I took you there; and yet I cannot regret it, for if you had not seen him and taken an {{objection}} to him, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> noticed him particularly {{when he spoke to}} one of the galley slaves. It is certainly curious that you should have doubted the man, for I have met him there several times, and even after your visit with me I could see nothing in him to justify your dislike." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{letter is}} nearly done: my retrospect is finished. I have brought {{it down to}} the date of events, about which you know as much as I do. Accident {{conducted}} you to a discovery which, otherwise, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> made, perhaps for months, perhaps not at all, until I had led you to it of my own accord. I say accident, positively; knowing that from first to last I trusted no third person. What you know, you knew by accident alone.|$|E
6000|$|... "They are all off, by George!" [...] cried Captain Truck, when fully {{satisfied}} of the fact. [...] "Camels, tents, and Arabs! The rascals have loaded their beasts already, {{and most}} probably {{have gone to}} hide their plunder, {{that they may be}} back and make sure of a second haul, before any of their precious brother vultures, up in the sands, get a scent of the carrion. D--n the rogues; I thought at one time they had me in a category! Well, joy be with them! Mr. Monday, I return you my hearty thanks for the manly, frank, and diplomatic manner in which you have discharged the duties of your mission. Without <b>you,</b> we <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> succeeded in getting the foremast. Mr. Dodge, you have the high consolation of knowing that, throughout this trying occasion, you have conducted yourself in a way no other man of the party could have done." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are {{the very}} person I wanted to see," [...] said the old gentleman. [...] "I had two words to say to you, my dear sir; and If you have no {{objection}} I will avail myself of the present opportunity. To put it plainly, Miss Halcombe and I have been talking over family affairs--affairs which are the cause of my being here--and {{in the course of}} our conversation she was naturally led to tell me of this unpleasant matter connected with the anonymous letter, and of the share which you have most creditably and properly taken in the proceedings so far. That share, I quite understand, gives you an interest which <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> otherwise <b>have</b> felt, in knowing that the future management of the investigation which you have begun will be placed in safe hands. My dear sir, make yourself quite easy on that point--it will be placed in MY hands." ...|$|R
6000|$|MRS. P.--Yes, my love! {{you are a}} good love, and generous, heaven knows, to {{your poor}} old mother who has seen better days. If we <b>had</b> <b>not</b> wanted, would I have ever allowed you to be a governess--a poor {{degraded}} governess? If that brute O'Reilly who lived on our second floor <b>had</b> <b>not</b> behaved so shamefully wicked to you, and married Miss Flack, the singer, <b>might</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been Editress of the Champion of Liberty at this very moment, and had your Opera box every night?
