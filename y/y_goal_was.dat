These protocols improve the previous upper bound of n + log n, obtained by Karchmer. We also show that any protocol for solving the problem must exchange, in the worst case, at least n+ 1 bits.

40|$|In {{this chapter}} we survey {{the theory of}} two-party {{communication}} complexity. This field of theoretical computer science aims at studying the following, seemingly very simple, scenario: There are two players Alice who holds an n-bit string x and Bob who holds an n-bit string <b>y.</b> Their <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> to communicate in order to compute the value of some boolean function f(x, y), while exchanging a number of bits which is as small as possible. In {{the first part of}} this survey we present, mainly by giving examples, some of the results (and techniques) developed as part of this theory. We put an emphasis on proving lower bounds on the amount of communication that must be exchanged in the above scenario for certain functions f. In the second part of this survey we will exemplify the wide applicability of the results proved in the first part to other areas of computer science. While it is obvious that there are many applications of the results to problems in which communication is involved (e. g., in distributed systems), we concentrate on applications in which communication does not appear explicitly in the statement of the problems. In particular, we present results regarding the following models of computation: • Finite automata • Turing machines • Decision trees • Ordered binary decision diagrams (OBDDs) • VLSI chips • Networks of threshold gates We provide references to many other issues and applications of communication complexity which are not discussed in this survey. ...|$|R

We also show a direct sum theorem for IC(f) and give the first general connection be-tween information complexity and (non-amortized) communication complexity.

As a direct corollary of our convergence analysis we obtain a bound on the sparsity of the predictor {{as a function of the}} desired optimization accuracy, the bound on the ℓ 1 norm, and the Lipschitz constant of the loss function. 1 Outline of main results We consider {{the problem of}} searching a linear predictor with low loss and low ℓ 1 norm. Formally, let X be an instance space, Y be a target space, and D be a distribution over X × <b>Y.</b> Our <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> to approximately solve the following optimization problem min w E (x,y) ∼D[L(〈w, x〉, y) ] s. t. ‖w‖ 1 ≤ B, (1) where L: R × Y → R is a loss function. Furthermore, we would like to find an approximated solution to Eq. (1) which is also sparse, namely, ‖w‖ 0 = |{i: wi ̸ = 0 }| is small. We describe an iterative algorithm for solving Eq. (1) that alters a single element of w at each iteration. Assuming that L is convex and λ-Lipschitz with respect to its first argument, we prove that after performing T iterations of the algorithm it finds a solution with accuracy O((λ B/ɛ) 2). Our analysis therefore implies that we can find w such that • ‖w‖ 0 = O((λ B/ɛ) 2) • For all w ⋆ with ‖w‖ 1 ≤ B we have E[L(〈w, x〉, y) ] ≤ E[L(〈w ⋆, x〉, y) ] + ɛ In a separate technical report, we show that this relation between ‖w‖ 0, B, and ɛ is tight. 1...|$|R

The three problems {{we look at}} in this lecture are range minimum queries (RMQ), least common ancestors (LCA), and level ancestors (LA); we will support all these queries in constant time per operation and linear space. 1. 1 Range Minimum Query (RMQ) In the range minimum query problem, we are given (and we preprocess) an array A of n numbers. In a query, the <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> to find the minimum element in a range spanned by A[i] and A[j]: RMQ(i,j) = (arg) min{A[i],A[i+ 1], [...] .,A[j]} = k, where i ≤ k ≤ j and A[k] is minimized We care {{not only about the}} value of the minimum element, but also about the index k of the minimum element between A[i] and A[j]; given the index, it is easy to look up the actual value of the minimum element, so it is a more interesting problem to find the index of the minimum element between A[i] and A[j]. The range minimum query problem is not a tree problem, but it closely related to a tree problem (least common ancestor). 1. 2 Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) In the lowest common ancestor problem, we want to preprocess a rooted tree T with n nodes.

40|$|In this work, {{we study}} position-based {{cryptography}} in the quantum setting. The {{aim is to}} use the geographical position of a party as its only credential. On the negative side, we show that if adversaries are allowed to share an arbitrarily large entangled quantum state, no secure position-verification is possible at all. To this end, we prove the following very general result. Assume that Alice and Bob share a (possibly) unknown quantum state |ψ〉AB and some classical information x, <b>y</b> respectively.

Clearly, since both the quantum state and the classical state that determines the unitary are distributed among the players, they need to communicate. The question that we ask here is how many rounds of communication are needed, where by a round we define both Alice and Bob sending both classical and quantum messages to each other without waiting for messages of other parties. It is easy to achieve such a task using two rounds of classical communication. Surprisingly, in case Alice and Bob share enough entanglement to start with, we show that the same task can be done using a single round of classical communication in which Alice and Bob sen...|$|R

40|$|The Expectation-Maximization (EM) {{algorithm}} is {{a device to}} find MLEs when some unobserved latent variables exist. Let X and Y denote latent variables and observed data, and θ be a parameter. In general, X, Y and θ are all multidimensional. The <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> to find a MLE ˆ θ based on Y. Suppose f(x, y|θ) is the joint density for (X, Y), and fY (y|θ) is the marginal density for Y. L(θ|x, y) = log f(x, y|θ) and L(θ|y) = log fY (y|θ) are usually {{referred to as the}} likelihood functions based on the complete data (x, y) and the observed data <b>y</b> respectively. The <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> to find a MLE ˆ θ based on the observed data y. Here is a challenge: Finding ˆ θ requires maximizing the integral L(θ|y) = log ∫ X f(x, y|θ) νX(dx) as a function of θ. The EM algorithm starts with an initial guess θ (0) and alternates the following two steps at t = 0, 1, 2, [...] . E-step: Compute the target function Q(θ, θ (t)) = E[L(θ|X, y) |y; θ (t) ] = M-step: Find θ (t+ 1) to maximize Q(θ, θ (t)). The key idea in the E-step is “imputation”. X log f(x, y|θ) fX(x|y; θ (t)) νX (dx); Since the likelihood function based on the complete data is usually easy to handle, it is appealing to simply “fill in ” a set of missing data x and maximize L(θ|x, y). However, considering the variability of X, a correct “fill in ” approach is to average over all possible values of X. This is implemented by integrating log f(x, y|θ) according to the current “predictive density ” fX(x|y; θ (t)) for the missing data x. Now we show the monotonicity of the EM algorithm, i. e. it always increases the likelihood. Denote by Et(·) the conditional expectation under the density fX(x|y; θ (t)). Note that implies L(θ|y) = L(θ|X, y) − log fX(X|y; θ) L(θ|y) = EtL(θ|X, y) − Et[log fX(X|y; θ) ] = Q(θ, θ (t)) − Et[log fX(X|y; θ) ]. Let h(X) = fX(X|y;θ) fX(X|y;θ (t)).

Our results apply to any non-signaling distribution, that is, those where Alice’s marginal distribution {{does not depend on}} Bob’s input, and vice versa, therefore our techniques apply to any communication problem that can be reduced to a non-signaling distribution, including quantum distributions, Boolean and non-Boolean functions, most relations, partial (promise) problems, in the two-player and multipartite settings. We give elementary proofs and very intuitive interpretations of the recent lower bounds of Linial and Shraibman, which we generalize to the problem of simulating any non-signaling distribution. The lower bounds we obtain are also expressed as linear programs (or SDPs for quantum communication). We show that the dual formulations have a striking interpretation, since they coincide with maximum violations of Bell and Tsirelson inequalities. The dual expressions are closely related to the winning probability of XOR games. We show that {{as in the case of}} Boolean functions, the gap between the quantum and classical lower bounds is at most linear in size of the support of the distribution, and does not depend on the size of the inputs. This tranlates into a bound on the gap between maximal Bell and Tsirelson inequalities, which was previously known only for the case of Boolean outcomes with uniform marginals. Finally, we give an exponential upper bound on quantum and classical communication complexity in the simultaneous messages model, for any non-signaling distribution.
