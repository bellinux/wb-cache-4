500|$|McCormack {{received}} his breakthrough role in 1998 {{when he was}} cast as gay lawyer Will Truman on the NBC sitcom Will & Grace. McCormack said that when the part came along, he was convinced he was right for the role. [...] "At {{the end of the}} audition, Max Mutchnick, co-creator and executive producer of the show said 'That was perfect. Just to let you know, <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be more gay than that.'" [...] He explained that when he first read the script, [...] "what hit me immediately was that this was me. I mean, sexual orientation aside, Will was so much like me. He's a great host, he's relatively funny and he has great friends and he's a good friend to them... the gay issue just wasn't really a big thing." [...] The show debuted on September 21, 1998, and was watched by almost 8.6million American viewers. Will & Grace quickly developed a loyal audience, with the show and McCormack receiving strong reviews. John Carman of the San Francisco Chronicle commented that McCormack and costar Debra Messing (who played Will's best friend Grace Adler) worked [...] "nicely" [...] together. Kay McFadden of The Seattle Times also praised McCormack, Messing, and the supporting cast as [...] "very funny". For this performance, he earned four Emmy Award nominations (2000, 2001, 2003, 2005), one of which resulted in a win (2001), for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series. In addition, he received five Golden Globe Award nominations.|$|E
500|$|Many of Kavner's roles {{have been}} {{described}} by New York Times writer Hilary de Vries as a [...] "woman who is supportive, sympathetic, or self-effacingly funny". Kavner grew to despise playing such roles, saying, [...] "If it smacks of Brenda Morgenstern, I won't take the job." [...] She had a supporting role as Eleanor Costello, a nurse who befriends Robin Williams' character in the Academy Award nominated film Awakenings. Kavner interviewed several nurses {{in preparation for the}} role, and Penny Marshall, the director of the film, described Kavner as [...] "a low-maintenance actor [...] <b>You</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> worry about giving [...] back-story for her characters." [...] In 1992, Kavner starred in This Is My Life, her first leading role in a feature film. Kavner played Dottie Ingels, an aspiring stand-up comedian who starts neglecting her family when her career begins to take off. Kavner described Dottie as [...] "really selfish" [...] but admitted, [...] "I liked the role for that very reason." [...] Kavner had been asked to play a character with a smaller role in the film, but Joe Roth, at the time the chairman of 20th Century Fox, suggested that they cast a lesser known actress in the lead role. Nora Ephron, the writer of This Is My Life, said Kavner [...] "has so little vanity that it is almost shocking. Not only does she have no demands as an actress - 'How big is my trailer, what's in my refrigerator?' - but she will do anything for the character if it makes sense to her." ...|$|E

2500|$|Casting {{began in}} early August 2009, with open auditions held in various states. Jesse Eisenberg was first {{announced}} to {{be attached to}} the project in September 2009. (Coincidentally, in an interview with Diane Sawyer on ABC's World News with Diane Sawyer, Zuckerberg revealed that Eisenberg's cousin, Eric Fisher, was a Facebook product designer.) Several days later, Justin Timberlake and Andrew Garfield were confirmed to portray the roles of Sean Parker and Eduardo Saverin, respectively. In October 2009, Brenda Song, Rooney Mara, Armie Hammer, Shelby Young, and Josh Pence were cast. Max Minghella and Dakota Johnson were also confirmed to star in the film. In a 2009 interview with The Baltimore Sun, Eisenberg said, [...] "Even though I've gotten to be in some wonderful movies, this character seems so much more overtly insensitive in so many ways that seem more real to me in the best way. I don't often get cast as insensitive people, so it feels very comfortable: fresh and exciting, as if <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> worry about the audience. Not that I worry about the audience anyway – it should be just the furthest thing from your mind. The Social Network is the biggest relief I've ever had in a movie".|$|E
6000|$|But Mrs. Tappitt by {{no means}} held him in such aversion as did her husband. He was a well-grown, good-looking young man for whom his friends had made {{comfortable}} provision, and Mrs. Tappitt had three marriageable daughters. Her ideas {{on the subject of}} young men in general were {{by no means}} identical with those held by Mrs. Ray. She was aware how frequently it happened that a young partner would marry a daughter of the senior in the house, and {{it seemed to her that}} special provision for such an arrangement was made in this case. Young Rowan was living in her house, and was naturally thrown into great intimacy with her girls. It was clear to her quick eye that he was of a susceptible disposition, fond of ladies' society, and altogether prone to those pleasant pre-matrimonial conversations, from the effects of which it is so difficult for an inexperienced young man to make his escape. Mrs. Tappitt was minded to devote to him Augusta, the second of her flock,--but not so minded with any obstinacy of resolution. If Luke should prefer Martha, the elder, or Cherry, the younger girl, Mrs. Tappitt would make no objection; but she expected that he should do his duty by taking one of them. [...] "Laws, T., don't be so foolish," [...] she said to her husband, when he made his complaint to her. She always called her husband T., unless when the solemnity of some special occasion justified her in addressing him as Mr. Tappitt. To have called him Tom or Thomas, would, in her estimation, have been very vulgar. [...] "Don't be so foolish. Did <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do with a young man before? Those tantrums will all blow off when he gets himself into harness." [...] The tantrums spoken of were Rowan's insane desire to brew good beer, but they were of so fatal a nature that Tappitt was determined not to submit himself to them. Luke Rowan should never be partner of his,--not though he had twenty daughters waiting to be married! ...|$|E
