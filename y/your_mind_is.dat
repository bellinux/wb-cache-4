[...] "Many healthy people, she said, are 'driven to mental illness' by society's disapproval {{and by the}} 'authoritarian institution of psychiatry.' She attributed her own depression to her diagnosis, {{and not the other}} way around, writing, [...] "When you have been told that <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> unsound, {{there is a kind of}} despair that takes over".

She believed that her depression was due to grief and feeling broken. She said, [...] "When you have been told that <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> unsound, {{there is a kind of}} despair that takes over..."

However, after constant touring, the band lost focus as Partington explained: [...] "When you're away for a year touring straight, whenever you're home whether you're working or not <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> like 'yes I'm at home.'" [...] The group decided that to help them focus, they would record in Seattle, Washington. On May 5, 2003, {{it was announced that}} the band was in the studio recording their next album at Robert Lang Studios and TMF with producer Jim Wirt. Wirt and Phil Kaffel acted as engineers, with Justin Armstrong as a secondary engineer with assistance from Geoff Ott. Two days of the recording process consisted of Partington in the live room, tracking one-take run-throughs of each song on guitar. With this approach, Partington improvised a lot of the parts, which yielded [...] "lots of results." ...|$|E

2500|$|This did not please Mahathir, who had clashed {{on several}} {{previous}} occasions with the judiciary. In one instance, a government order revoking the work permits of two foreign journalists {{critical of the}} government had been over-ruled by the Supreme Court. Mahathir began making heated attacks on the judiciary, telling Time, [...] "The judiciary says, 'Although you passed a law with a certain thing in mind, we think that <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> wrong, {{and we want to}} give our interpretation.' If we disagree, the Courts will say, 'We will interpret your disagreement.' If we [...] go along, we are going to lose our power of legislation." [...] Mahathir also lashed out at [...] "black sheep ... who want to be ... fiercely independent," [...] accusing them of playing to public opinion. Immediately after this latter statement, the government reassigned several High Court judges to different divisions, including Justice Harun Hashim who was then hearing the UMNO case. However, as the latter case was already in progress, Harun's transfer would not take effect until the case closed.|$|E

2500|$|Mahathir, who {{had never}} been fond of the judiciary, began making heated {{statements}} about it at this time. Mahathir declared, [...] "The judiciary says, 'Although you passed a law with a certain thing in mind, we think that <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> wrong, and we want to give our interpretation.' If we disagree, the courts will say, 'We will interpret your disagreement.' ... We know exactly what we want to do, but once we do it, it is interpreted in a different way." [...] Mahathir also lambasted [...] "black sheep ... who want to be ... fiercely independent" [...] and play to public opinion. Soon after, nine judges sitting on the High Court were reassigned to different divisions; Justice Harun Hashim, who presided over the UMNO case, was transferred from appellate and special powers cases to commercial crimes. However, because the UMNO case was already in progress, his transfer would not take effect until the case closed. Harun later ruled that under the evidence presented, it was clear several UMNO delegates had come from unregistered branches of the party. In line with the law, he declared he was forced to declare UMNO an illegal society, and thereby dismissed the case of the plaintiffs. Mahathir soon formed a new party, UMNO Baru (New UMNO), to replace UMNO. Within a year, the suffix [...] "Baru" [...] was dropped, making it just plain [...] "UMNO".|$|E
