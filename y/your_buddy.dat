25|$|Asia Agcaoili {{spearheaded the}} show for the viewers of Studio 23. Her show, called Pinoy Big Brother on Studio 23: Si Kuya, KaBarkada Mo (English: Filipino Big Brother on Studio 23: Your Brother, <b>Your</b> <b>Buddy),</b> not only {{featured}} snippets from the primetime telecast the night before, but also featured opinion polls both from {{the man on the}} street and those sending SMS, spoof segments, unaired videos, and feed from inside the house (either live feed or footage taped earlier). Studio 23 has stopped the practice since the second Celebrity Edition and instead resorted to airing the delayed late morning/early afternoon feeds.|$|E
25|$|You shouldn't make friends. It's not a {{good thing}} to be friends with people you're covering. There's just no point in doing it. It's tempting, but they're not going to {{consider}} you their friend anyway. They just know that you're somebody that can do something for them. So you shouldn't really flatter yourself that they want to be <b>your</b> <b>buddy.</b> They don't... They want you for some reason or other, {{and you just have to}} fend that off all the time. And you can't really cover people critically that you're friends with. How would that work? That would be bad. So you always have to keep that in mind.|$|E
25|$|A Buddy System {{has also}} been {{implemented}} into multiplayer. At {{the beginning of each}} match, the player may be joined with a random partner or a friend if joining their game. The buddy's emblem remains displayed as part of the player's HUD to indicate their location relative to the player's own on the map. With <b>your</b> <b>Buddy,</b> you can do a cooperative taunt over dead enemies you defeated together, and can also collect each other's earned treasures for them. The player is able to spawn next to his buddy so long as the buddy remains alive and out of combat. With the aim of making the multiplayer more flexible and accessible, several logistical improvements have been added, such as the capability to join games in progress or for two different PlayStation Network accounts to play together in split-screen multiplayer on a single console. In the event of ties or near-ties, matches enter an elimination mode as they wind down, in which the players are restricted to one life and must compete to wipe out all of the opposing team's members first within the allotted remaining time.|$|E

500|$|Paul {{built the}} members a cabana style house on his pool deck with air conditioning, a TV, and beds so the members felt {{comfortable}} while recording. Paul produced {{the record and}} Gray felt Paul [...] "facilitated the whole thing". The album was completed in roughly a month, with three recording sessions. The band worked on the record for eight days and returned home for a break. A 14-day session, followed the break and then another 10 days in the studio. Gray asserts the breaks in between recording sessions were to [...] "re charge the batteries", and [...] "get a fresh head". As the line-up was complete, the band started to brainstorm names. When a member thought of a name they would write it {{on a piece of}} paper and put it in an amp box outside the studio. Someone wrote [...] "Hellyeah", and the band thought it was a perfect choice. Paul says it's [...] "very affirmative and full of attitude. When <b>your</b> <b>buddy</b> asks if you want to get a beer tonight, you don't just say 'yes,' you say, [...] "Hell yeah!". Gray attributes the name to [...] "late teens, keggers and chicks and AC/DC and Metallica".|$|E

5000|$|A short snorter is a {{banknote}} inscribed {{by people}} traveling together on an aircraft. The tradition {{was started by}} Alaskan Bush flyers in the 1920s and spread through the military and commercial aviation. During World War II short snorters were signed by flight crews and conveyed good luck to soldiers crossing the Atlantic. Friends would take the local currency and sign each other's bills creating a [...] "keepsake of <b>your</b> <b>buddy's</b> signatures".|$|R
50|$|For divers {{following}} the rule, {{one third of}} the gas supply is planned for the outward journey, one third is for the return journey and one third is a safety reserve. However, when diving with a buddy with a higher breathing rate or a different volume of gas, {{it may be necessary to}} set one third of <b>your</b> <b>buddy's</b> gas supply as your remaining 'third'. This means that the turn point to exit is earlier, or that the diver with the lower breathing rate carries a larger volume of gas than he alone requires.|$|R
5000|$|The Gene Worm {{is found}} deep {{underground}} in a seemingly abandoned industrial area of Black Mesa, and appears through a portal opening {{in a room}} there.

5000|$|The {{show has}} {{received}} {{both positive and}} negative reviews because of its unique, provocative presentation and style. Some compare it to a gonzo type of journalism. Maureen Ryan of The Huffington Post wrote a negative review of the show, due to its presentation. Rolling Stone magazine has written that: [...] "It feels a little like <b>your</b> <b>buddy</b> from the bar just happened to be wandering through eastern Afghanistan with a camera crew." [...] In June 2013, the show was covered extensively in mainstream media for documenting a basketball game with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.|$|E

5000|$|Shawn Michaels' {{loss was}} criticized by Triple H the {{following}} night on Raw Is War, blaming him for overlooking Tyson's potential double-cross. He delivered a promo saying that he would now helm D-Generation X {{and turn it into}} an army and [...] "the first thing you do is look to your blood. You look to <b>your</b> <b>buddies.</b> You look to your friends. You look to the Kliq", and introduced a returning Sean Waltman, under the X-Pac persona, who had jumped ship from World Championship Wrestling (WCW). Later in the evening, it was revealed that Road Dogg and Billy Gunn were also part of the DX Army.|$|R
5000|$|R - Releases : Locate {{and check}} {{that all of}} <b>your</b> <b>buddy's</b> {{releases}} are properly secured {{and you know how}} to undo them in an emergency. This includes their Velcro waist band and at least two shoulder clips. Many BCDs also have a chest and stomach clip. It's a good idea to touch each clip as you check it and even count each one out loud as you do so. Remember to check the tank strap and clip. You can do this by placing one hand {{on the bottom of the}} tank and the other on the first stage regulator and trying to move the tank up and down to see if the strap moves.|$|R
50|$|In 2006 {{the band}} {{released}} an EP entitled Don't Give Up on <b>Your</b> Dreams, <b>Buddy!</b> {{as well as}} a full-length album, Let Me Introduce My Friends - both of which were well-received critically.

5000|$|Players {{explore a}} large cargo station {{in search of}} {{treasure}} which then accidentally triggered the self-destruct sequence.

The player is assisted by a fellow debugger named Leon who provides information and weapon and is also <b>your</b> <b>buddy.</b> [...] The game featured a minimal ability to look up and down. Selecting a harder difficulty generated a blob-like monster that moved on the ceiling.|$|E

50|$|In 2013, McDonald’s {{encountered}} controversy around negative racial stereotypes {{when the}} fast-food restaurant tested {{one of its}} ads in Germany for the resident Mexican population. The title of the commercial was “Los Wochos,” a made-up word for the Spanish translation of the word “week” in German. This word is offensive {{because it is not}} a common expression for the people, but rather a bad attempt to make a German word sound Spanish. The commercial went on to say, “When you turn ketchup into 'salsa picante,' <b>your</b> <b>buddy</b> into a 'muchacho' and your burger into 'chili con carne,' that means The Wochos are here". 'Olé.'” The problem was that not all of these terms are of Mexican origin; rather, “olé” is a typical expression of southern Spain, while chile con carne is a Texan dish. The commercial also featured mariachi players, a luchador (wrestler), men wearing sombreros, women with red flowers in their hair, and many Mexican flags in the background.|$|E
2500|$|Waltman {{returned}} to WWF TV on the March 30, 1998 episode of Monday Night Raw, {{the night after}} WrestleMania XIV and days after his firing from WCW. With Shawn Michaels beginning a four-year retirement after a WWF World Heavyweight Championship loss and back injury, Triple H was now the leader of D-Generation X (DX). He said he was forming a DX army and [...] "when you start an army, you look to your blood... you look to <b>your</b> <b>buddies...</b> you look to your friends... you look to The Kliq." [...] Waltman appeared on the stage, commented on Bischoff and Hogan, and said if they weren't contracted to WCW, Hall and Nash would have also {{returned to}} the WWF. Bischoff responded on Nitro the next week by telling Waltman to [...] "bite me." ...|$|R
5000|$|He is {{best known}} for the series of humorous {{instructional}} books for children such as The Trickster's Handbook (1976), The Secret Agent's Handbook (1977) and The Whizzkid's Handbook (1979), full of tricks, games, puzzles, and advice, with illustrations by Roger Smith. The following gives a brief flavour of these works: [...] "tell your friends you can kiss a book 'inside and outside' without opening it - then prove it by kissing the book while standing outdoors ... and then indoors. Something semiserious? Baffle <b>your</b> <b>buddies</b> with vanishing water or instant indoor rainbows." [...] The series was adapted for television in 1980 as The Whizzkids Guide starring Kenneth Williams, Rita Webb and Arthur Mullard as overgrown schoolchildren. Williams said [...] "the script is full of corny gags which actually make me laugh".|$|R
5000|$|In Army Men: Air Attack, {{the evil}} Tan army {{is making a}} move into Green territory. Only one man {{has the ability to}} stop their advance: Captain William Blade. Take command of Blade and his ragtag crew of chopper pilots as they fly one of four {{choppers}} Huey, Chinook, Super Stallion, or Apache through 16 missions of plastic carnage. Help them maneuver through perilous settings like the [...] "Backyard" [...] and the [...] "Picnic." [...] When you get tired of seeing <b>your</b> <b>buddies</b> melted on the barbecue, call a friend to help you in the Cooperative Play mode. If sharing is not your thing, knock your friend's chopper out of the sky in a head-to-head match up. Either way, with Army Men: Air Attack, it is real combat with plastic men.|$|R
