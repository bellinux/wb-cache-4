The game was played at Fenway Park in Boston, on October 2, 1978. The tie-breaker was necessitated after the <b>Yankees</b> <b>and</b> Red Sox finished the season tied for first place in the AL East with identical 99–63 records. The Red Sox were the home team by virtue of a coin toss. In baseball statistics, the tie-breaker counted as the 163rd regular season game for both teams, with all events in the game added to regular season statistics.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the owners}} of the Yankees are {{involved}} with Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, owner of Manchester City F.C., the Major League Soccer team New York City FC, and the Red Sox being involved with Liverpool F.C., the 2014 International Champions Cup match between Manchester City and Liverpool at Yankee Stadium carried the classic angle of the <b>Yankees</b> <b>and</b> Red Sox rivalry.

5|$|The Yankees' 1980s demise and {{downfall}} {{continued into}} the early 1990s and was at its frustrating peak in 1994, when they finished with {{the best record in}} the American League in a season that was prematurely halted by the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike, which left New York sports fans disappointed that Mattingly had not played in a postseason despite being poised to do so that year. At that time, he led active players in both games played and at-bats without participating in a postseason game. Throughout October, the news media added to the embarrassment when they often made references to dates that games in the World Series would have been played. That year, the <b>Yankees</b> <b>and</b> Red Sox would have finished the season against each other at Fenway Park. Both managers, Buck Showalter of the <b>Yankees</b> <b>and</b> Butch Hobson of the Red Sox, who made their managerial debuts against each other, were fired as a result of or during the strike.|$|E
5|$|The {{broadcasts}} of {{the games}} between the rivals have led {{to an increase in}} television ratings.

5|$|After {{six innings}} of {{allowing}} no earned runs – {{which gave him}} a total of 13 innings against the <b>Yankees</b> <b>and</b> Cardinals with only one earned run allowed on a torn ankle tendon – Schilling made way for Alan Embree, who pitched a scoreless seventh. Mike Timlin replaced Embree in the eighth, in which a sacrifice fly by Scott Rolen reduced the Red Sox lead to four. Keith Foulke then came in to strike out Jim Edmonds to end the inning and also pitched the ninth to end the game. For the second game in a row, the Red Sox won despite committing four fielding errors.|$|E

5|$|Although Jennings {{dreamed of}} {{following}} in his father's footsteps in broadcasting, {{his first job}} was as a bank teller for the Royal Bank of Canada. He had hoped that the company would assign him to its Havana branch; instead, it located him to {{the small town of}} Prescott, Ontario, before transferring him to its nearby Brockville branch. During this time, he explored acting by appearing in several amateur musical productions with the Orpheus Musical Theatre Society, including Damn <b>Yankees</b> <b>and</b> South Pacific.|$|E
5|$|Bill Donovan {{was hired}} as the Yankees manager in the offseason. In the 1914–15 offseason, Peckinpaugh {{considered}} leaving the Yankees to join the Federal League, as he received offers from the Chicago Federals, Buffalo Blues, and Indianapolis Hoosiers. After considering the offer from Chicago, he chose {{to stay with the}} <b>Yankees,</b> <b>and</b> received a three-year contract worth $6,000 ($ in current dollar terms) per season from 1915 through 1917. He resigned with the Yankees in 1918. Peckinpaugh tied Buck Weaver for fourth in runs scored (89) and several players for eighth in home runs (7) in the 1919 season.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} in baseball, Paschal was {{described}} as a five-tool player who excelled at running, throwing, fielding, hitting for average, and power. However, his playing time with the Yankees was limited because they already had future Baseball Hall of Famers Ruth and Earle Combs, and star Bob Meusel, in the outfield. Paschal was considered one of the best bench players in baseball during his time with the <b>Yankees,</b> <b>and</b> sportswriters wrote how he would have started for most other teams in the American League. He {{was one of the best}} pinch hitters in the game during the period, at a time when the term was still relatively new to baseball.|$|E

5|$|In November 2000, the Indians offered Ramirez a seven-year, $119million contract. While {{this would}} have made Ramirez the highest-paid player in baseball, the deal was {{rejected}} by Ramirez and his agent, Jeff Moorad, who were seeking a ten-year, $200million contract. Ramirez was reportedly pursued by the New York <b>Yankees</b> <b>and</b> Seattle Mariners, but in December agreed to an eight-year, $160million deal with the Boston Red Sox, with $20million options for 2009 and 2010, pushing {{the total value of}} the contract to $200million for 10years.|$|E
5|$|Principal Skinner has put Bart in detention. While dusting a desk, {{he finds}} an Aramaic inscription.

For his final test, he must torture Homer; despite Bart's hesitation, Homer lets him. A disfigured Homer proudly watches Bart graduate from Hell school as valedictorian.|$|E
5|$|The Mets {{performance}} in the playoffs drew heavy television viewership, with the decisive game of the NLCS scoring the highest ratings for any League Championship Series broadcast since 1993. Overall the NLCS averaged 10.9 million viewers, 18% higher than the NLCS had drawn the year before. Variety writer Tom Bierbaum argued {{this was a good}} sign for the future of baseball because the Mets and Boston Red Sox had drawn younger viewers during their time in the postseason. Bierbaum believed that baseball needed fresh teams, not just the often-successful <b>Yankees</b> <b>and</b> Braves, to draw new audiences and grow viewership.|$|E
