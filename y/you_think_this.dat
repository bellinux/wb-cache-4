5|$|Each year, {{thousands}} of outdoor enthusiasts attempt to summit Mount Adams. The false summits and broad summit plateau have disheartened many climbers as this inscription {{on a rock}} at Piker’s Peak indicates. “You are a piker if <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> is the summit. Don’t crab, the mountain was here first.” Crampons and ice axes are needed on many routes because of glaciers and the route’s steepness. Aside from crevasses on the more difficult glacier routes, the biggest hazard is the loose rocks and boulders which are easily dislodged and a severe hazard for climbers below. These falling rocks are especially dangerous for climbers on the precipitous east faces and the steep headwalls of {{the north and west}} sides. Routes in those areas should only be climbed early in the season under as ideal conditions as can be had. Other hazards faced by climbers on Adams include sudden storms and clouds, avalanches, altitude sickness, and inexperience. Climbing Mount Adams can be dangerous {{for a variety of reasons}} and people have died in pursuit of the summit while many others have had close calls.|$|E
25|$|To Antonino Votto, Callas wasThe {{last great}} artist. When <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> woman was nearly blind, and often sang {{standing}} a good 150 {{feet from the}} podium. But her sensitivity! Even if she could not see, she sensed the music and always came in exactly with my downbeat. When we rehearsed, she was so precise, already note-perfect... She {{was not just a}} singer, but a complete artist. It's foolish to discuss her as a voice. She must be viewed totally—as a complex of music, drama, movement. There is no one like her today. She was an esthetic phenomenon.|$|E

The song deals with Armstrong's anxiety attacks {{and feelings of}} [...] "going crazy" [...] prior to being diagnosed with a panic disorder. [...] In the third verse, [...] "Basket Case" [...] references soliciting a male prostitute; Armstrong noted that [...] "I wanted to challenge myself and whoever the listener might be. It's also {{looking at the world}} and saying, 'It's not as black and white as <b>you</b> <b>think.</b> <b>This</b> isn't your grandfather's prostitute – or maybe it was.'" [...] The music video was filmed in an abandoned mental institution. This is one of the band's most popular songs.|$|E

500|$|Jennings {{started to}} consume amphetamines while {{he lived with}} Johnny Cash during the mid-1960s. Jennings later stated, [...] "Pills were the {{artificial}} energy on which Nashville ran around the clock." [...] In 1977, Jennings was arrested by federal agents for conspiracy and possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. A private courier warned the Drug Enforcement Administration about the package sent to Jennings by a New York colleague that contained 27 grams of cocaine. The DEA and the police searched Jennings's recording studio. They found no evidence, because while {{they were waiting for}} a search warrant, Jennings disposed of the cocaine. The charges were later dropped and Jennings was released. The episode was recounted in Jennings's song [...] "Don't <b>You</b> <b>Think</b> <b>This</b> Outlaw Bit's Done Got Outta Hand?" ...|$|E
500|$|In 1976, Jennings {{released}} the album Wanted! The Outlaws, recorded with Willie Nelson, Tompall Glaser, and Jessi Colter for RCA. The album {{was the first}} Country music album certified platinum. The following year, RCA issued Ol' Waylon, an album that produced a hit duet with Nelson, [...] "Luckenbach, Texas". The album Waylon and Willie followed in 1978, producing the hit single [...] "Mammas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys". Jennings released I've Always Been Crazy, also in 1978. The same year, {{at the peak of}} his success, Jennings began to feel limited by the outlaw movement. [...] Jennings referred to the overexploitation of the image in the song [...] "Don't <b>You</b> <b>Think</b> <b>This</b> Outlaw Bit Has Done Got Out of Hand?", claiming that the movement had become a [...] "self-fulfilling prophecy". In 1979, he released Greatest Hits, which was certified gold the same year, and quintuple platinum in 2002.|$|E
500|$|This Is What the Truth Feels Like {{focuses on}} several themes, {{including}} [...] "moving on {{from a broken}} relationship" [...] to [...] "falling in love again". Her divorce from Gavin Rossdale served as {{the main source of}} inspiration for the former, while her subsequent romance with Blake Shelton served as an inspiration for the latter. The singer intended the album to show her desire for [...] "forgiveness" [...] instead of [...] "revenge". Stefani's take on her [...] "messy divorce" [...] is evident in the single [...] "Used to Love You", while tracks like [...] "Send Me a Picture" [...] and [...] "Rare" [...] find her embracing a new love. She kept the news of her divorce hidden from her writing and production teams during the recording sessions, however, Stefani [...] "suspect her collaborators knew she was in crisis because of her lyrics". When asked in a GQ interview: [...] "Did <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> project {{was going to be a}} heartbreak album? It seems like a falling-in-love album. Was that a surprise?" [...] Stefani responded: ...|$|E

500|$|Critic {{and writer}} Kim Newman {{described}} Vampyrs style as {{closer to the}} experimental features such as Un chien andalou than a [...] "quickie horror film" [...] made {{after the release of}} Dracula (1931). Dreyer originally was going to film Vampyr in what he described as a [...] "heavy style" [...] but changed direction after cinematographer Maté showed him one shot that came out fuzzy and blurred. This washed out look was an effect Dreyer desired, and he had Maté shoot the film through a piece of gauze held threefeet (.9m) away from the camera to re-create this look. For other visuals in the film, Dreyer found inspiration from the fine arts. Actress Rena Mandel, who plays Gisèle, said that Dreyer showed her reproductions of paintings of Francisco Goya during filming. In Denmark, a journalist and friend of Dreyer, Henry Hellsen wrote in detail about the film and the artworks it appeared to draw on. When being asked about the intention of the film at the Berlin premiere, Dreyer replied that he [...] "had not any particular intention. I just wanted to make a film different from all other films. I wanted, if you will, to break new ground for the cinema. That is all. And do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> intention has succeeded? Yes, I have broken new ground". The filming of Vampyr was completed the middle of 1931.|$|E
500|$|When Kosygin told Brezhnev that it {{was time}} to {{reconcile}} with the PRC, Brezhnev replied: [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> is necessary, then you go by yourself". Kosygin was afraid that the PRC would turn down his proposal for a visit, so he decided to stop off in Beijing on his way to Vietnamese Communist leaders in Hanoi on 5 February 1965; there he met with Zhou. The two were able to solve smaller issues, agreeing to increase trade between the countries, as well as celebrate the 15th anniversary of the Sino-Soviet alliance. Kosygin was told that a reconciliation between the two countries might take years, and that rapprochement could occur only gradually. In his report to the Soviet leadership, Kosygin noted Zhou's moderate stance against the USSR, and believed he was open for serious talks about Sino-Soviet relations. After his visit to Hanoi, Kosygin returned to Beijing on 10 February, this time to meet Mao Zedong personally. At first Mao refused to meet Kosygin, but eventually agreed and the two met on 11 February. His meeting with Mao was in an entirely different tone to the previous meeting with Zhou. Mao criticized Kosygin, and the Soviet leadership, of revisionist behavior. He also continued to criticize Khrushchev's earlier policies. This meeting was to become Mao's last meeting with any Soviet leader.|$|E

2500|$|The {{work had}} its genesis in a {{commission}} from the dancer Ida Rubinstein, who asked Ravel {{to make an}} orchestral transcription of six pieces from Isaac Albéniz's set of piano pieces, Iberia. While working on the transcription, Ravel was informed that the movements had already been orchestrated by Spanish conductor Enrique Fernández Arbós, and that copyright law prevented any other arrangement from being made. When Arbós heard of this, {{he said he would}} happily waive his rights and allow Ravel to orchestrate the pieces. However, Ravel changed his mind and decided initially to orchestrate one of his own works. He then changed his mind again and decided to write a completely new piece based on the musical form and Spanish dance called bolero. While on vacation at St Jean-de-Luz, Ravel went to the piano and played a melody with one finger to his friend Gustave Samazeuilh, saying [...] "Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> theme has an insistent quality? I'm going to try and repeat it a number of times without any development, gradually increasing the orchestra as best I can." [...] This piece was initially called Fandango, but its title was soon changed to [...] "Boléro". According to Idries Shah the main melody is adapted from a melody composed for and used in Sufi training.|$|E
2500|$|Alstat {{lived in}} a JTS {{dormitory}} for forty-three years, serving as a counselor and mentor for generations of rabbinical students. [...] He would share both his knowledge of Jewish subjects, and the practical techniques he had developed over the years for filing {{bits and pieces of}} information that later helped him with his columns, and could help rabbis with their articles and sermons. He was well known for speaking with rabbinic students upon their return from student pulpit positions during the Jewish High Holy Days, greeting them with the question, [...] "How was your success?" [...] This question would lead to serious discussions about the difference between success during a short visit and a successful rabbinic career that would span years. When rabbinical students were having a hard time putting together a eulogy for a funeral, he would advise them to ask the relatives, [...] "What kind of a report card do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> person would have received from God?" [...] In his talks and even in the eulogies he delivered, he would teach that the way to [...] "appraise and evaluate the life achievements of a rabbi" [...] come from the Talmudic verse, where it is taught that we will be asked two questions: the second, whether we engaged in studies that were [...] "Jewishly cultural and creative?"; but the very first, whether we dealt with others faithfully—with integrity. In Alstat's own eulogy, he was called [...] "the friend, confidant and adviser to several generations of rabbinical students. Over the years he became the rabbi's rabbi as colleagues sought his counsel and advice." ...|$|E
