40|$|The {{catalytic}} conversion of Alcell (R) lignin in iso-propanol/formic acid mixtures (1 : 1 mass ratio) was explored in a batch set-up using Ru/C as the catalyst (673 K, 4 h, 28 % mass lignin intake on solvent). Lignin oils were obtained in good <b>yields</b> (71 % mass <b>yields</b> on lignin input) and shown {{to consist of}} a mixture of mainly aromatics (10. 5 % mass <b>yields</b> on lignin input), alkylphenolics (6 % mass <b>yields</b> on lignin input), catechols (8. 7 % mass <b>yields</b> on lignin input), guaiacols (1. 3 % mass <b>yields</b> on lignin input), and alkanes (5. 2 % mass <b>yields</b> on lignin input), the remainder being soluble higher molecular weight compounds (GCxGC-FID and GPC). The results for the catalytic experiments using formic acid were {{compared with those of}} a non-catalysed experiment and a catalytic hydrotreatment with molecular hydrogen and Ru/C {{in the absence of a}} solvent. Distinct differences in product <b>yields</b> and compositions were observed, and highest lignin oil <b>yields</b> were obtained by catalytic solvolysis (71 % mass <b>yields</b> on lignin input) versus 18 % mass <b>yields</b> on lignin input for noncatalytic solvolysis and 63 % mass <b>yields</b> on lignin input for catalytic hydrotreatment. The effect of reaction time on oil <b>yields</b> and product composition was established and a reaction network involving depolymerisation, and hydro(-deoxy) genation pathways is proposed to explain the product <b>yields</b> and composition. Besides iso-isopropanol, the use of ethanol and methanol in combination with formic acid was also explored for catalytic solvolysis. Best results were obtained in methanol (4 h, 673 K) leading to a lignin oil (68 % mass <b>yields</b> on lignin input) containing 11 % mass <b>yields</b> on lignin input of alkylphenolics and 19 % mass <b>yields</b> on lignin input of aromatics.

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{the impacts of}} climate change on maize <b>yields</b> using an econometric model that incorporates climate, economic, and technology variables. The major finding is climate change will not universally cause negative impacts of maize <b>yields</b> in the United States and China. The results of a simulation of climate change on maize <b>yields</b> over the period 2008 - 2030 show {{that a combination of}} changes in temperature and precipitation can either bring positive or negative effects on maize <b>yields.</b> Furthermore, variation in regional climatic and economic conditions makes the impacts of climatic change on maize <b>yields</b> substantially different in different regions. In this research, the impacts of climate change on maize <b>yields</b> are not simply examined by climate factors. Economic and technology adaptation effects on maize <b>yields</b> are also incorporated. Thus, even with significant changes in climate conditions that alter the maize crop's growing environment and affect crop <b>yields,</b> a decrease in maize supply due to a decrease in maize <b>yields</b> would lead to an increase in the maize price, which in turn would induce farmers to add more investments in production inputs to raise <b>yields.</b> Thus, the decrease in actual <b>yields</b> may not be as dramatic as predicted in only climate factor considered cases. In this research, findings gained from the study can be used for early-staged policymaking decisions and advanced problem prevention programs. To ensure the continuous increase in maize <b>yields</b> in the future, further studies and research, as well as efficient environmental policies and actions are required.
