[...] Diamond also analyzes The Matrix Revolutions and the messages imparted in the film, in the context of her own personal experiences in the Landmark Forum. [...] She describes a tautologous exchange between Agent Smith and Neo in the film, where Neo is asked by Smith: [...] "Why do <b>you</b> <b>continue</b> to do this, Mr. Anderson?" [...] and Neo responds: [...] "Because I choose to." [...] Diamond uses this example to explain the Landmark Forum's discussion of [...] "choice and decision." [...] Diamond provides further analysis of other Landmark Forum concepts utilized in The Matrix Revolutions in her book Stepping Into Spiritual Oneness: Spiritual Rememberings of the Soul Through Life Experience, including the concept that: [...] "we all choose to BE who we are being in each and every moment of our experience." ...|$|E

500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mixed reviews. In his review for IGN, contributor Colin Moriarty heavily criticized the episode and show, calling them, [...] "at best, a mediocre adventure in detective comedy television". He considered the episode [...] "mindless" [...] {{when compared to}} Monk, which preceded the episode. Moriarty stated that, when not comparing Psych to other shows, the episode is still [...] "making you wonder {{what the hell is}} going on in the minds of the show's writers and producers". He questioned the show's ability to last due to having to continue the fake psychic concept, and called detectives Lassiter and O'Hara [...] "completely unlikeable". Moriarty stated that things in the installment [...] "simply don't make any sense". He questioned whether the show would be able to last more than one season, and said that [...] "we highly recommend <b>you</b> <b>continue</b> to take a pass on Psych and save yourself from the mindlessness of it all". The installment was given a rating of 6, or [...] "okay", tying it for the lowest rated episode of the season, with the preceding episode, [...] "Spellingg Bee".|$|E
500|$|In 2008, Rajinikanth {{took part}} in a hunger strike {{organised}} by the Nadigar Sangam against Karnataka's stance on the Hogenakkal Falls water dispute. In his speech, which was well received in Tamil Nadu, he warned leaders not to inflame the water project issue for political gains and requested that the issue should be resolved soon. He reprimanded politicians in Karnataka and urged them [...] "to speak the truth" [...] to the public. [...] "They cannot be fooled and will not remain silent if <b>you</b> <b>continue</b> to act in such manner" [...] he stated. The speech led to Vatal Nagaraj, leader of the Kannada nationalist group Kannada Chaluvali Vatal Paksha, demanding an apology from Rajinikanth and threatening that he and his films would be boycotted from the state of Karnataka. The threats were echoed by other pro-Kannada organisations, such as the Karnataka Rakshana Vedike. He later thanked the Kannada film industry for allowing the release of Kuselan and lifting the ban the industry had briefly imposed on it. This led to strong reactions from Nadigar Sangam members R. Sarathkumar, Sathyaraj and Radha Ravi, who called the apology a disgrace to Tamils and opined that his speech never provoked the sentiments of the Kannada people.|$|E

2500|$|The {{picture of}} Moses {{presented}} in the midrash is to some extent that of [...] a martyr figure. [...] Moses is unloved and barely tolerated by his own people (in stark contrast to their adoration of his brother), and is constantly upbraided by God for every remark [...] which casts the Children of Israel in a negative light. [...] For example, the Israelites attack Moses for having taken them out of Egypt, and threaten his life, but when Moses reports to God this deteriorating situation, the response is: [...] "Moses, how long will <b>you</b> <b>continue</b> to defame my children?" ...|$|E

[...] In October 2006, when asked, [...] "Would <b>you</b> <b>continue</b> state funding for the proposed Knik Arm and Gravina Island bridges?", she answered: [...] "Yes. I would like to see Alaska's infrastructure projects built sooner rather than later. The window is now - while our congressional delegation is in a strong position to assist." [...] She also criticized {{the use of the word}} [...] "nowhere" [...] as insulting to local residents.|$|E
2500|$|After the {{announcement}} of the mobile game Super Mario Run in September 2016, Nintendo's stock soared to just under its recent high point after the release and success of Pokémon Go earlier in the year, something noted by journalists as even more significant than Pokémon Go, as Super Mario Run was developed in-house by Nintendo, which was not the case with Pokémon Go. In a December 2016 interview prior to the release of Super Mario Run, Miyamoto explained that the company believed that with some of their game franchises, [...] "the longer <b>you</b> <b>continue</b> to make a series, the more complex the gameplay becomes, and the harder it becomes for new players {{to be able to get}} into the series", and that the company sees mobile games with simplified controls, such as Super Mario Run, not only allows them to [...] "make a game that the broadest audience of people could play", but to also reintroduce these properties to newer audiences and draw them to their consoles.|$|E

2500|$|Johnson led the {{campaign}} advocating the Third Frontier program, a large state bond issue to finance industrial research and development, which Governor Taft had championed. [...] Critics such as Representative Tom Brinkman, a Republican of Cincinnati, called it [...] "corporate welfare". [...] Johnson after its defeat {{by the voters}} in November 2003 told The Plain Dealer the plan was not dead. [...] "There will definitely be continuing efforts to fund this strategy, because it’s the right strategy. [...] So you don’t drop it. <b>You</b> <b>continue</b> to encourage state funding.

[...] In 2005, Johnson was the point man on the Third Frontier campaign again, but this time voters in Ohio approved State Issue One which allocated dollars to support technology and innovation.

2500|$|During the Battle of Xiapi, Cao Cao {{defeated}} Lü Bu in {{the initial}} stages and forced him to retreat back to Xiapi Commandery (下邳郡; south of present-day Pizhou, Jiangsu). Cao Cao then laid siege to Xiapi and launched several attacks but was unable to breach the city walls. As his troops grew weary, Cao Cao considered withdrawing. However, Xun You and Guo Jia advised him, [...] "Lü Bu is brave but foolhardy. His forces' morale is very low after suffering consecutive defeats. An army's morale depends on its commander's will to fight on. Chen Gong is intelligent but slow. Since Lü Bu's army's morale hasn't recovered yet and Chen Gong hasn't finalised his plans yet, you can eventually defeat Lü Bu if <b>you</b> <b>continue</b> attacking him." [...] Cao Cao then ordered his troops to dig ditches and redirect the waters of the Yi and Si rivers to flood Xiapi. Xiapi fell quickly and Lü Bu was captured alive and executed.|$|E
2500|$|The Badger Trust {{national}} charity, {{believes that}} vaccination {{will also be}} more likely to help eradicate the disease. Referring to further studies by Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency (AHVLA) and the Food and Environment Research Agency (FERA),the group claims that vaccination reduces the risk of unvaccinated badger cubs testing tuberculosis positive, because [...] "by the time cubs emerge and are available for vaccination they might have already been exposed [...] to TB". Steve Clark, a director of the group, has separately said that [...] "vaccination also reduces the bacilli that is excreted by infected badgers. It doesn't cure them, but it reduces the possibility of any further infection...in the region of a 75% level of protection. The life span of a badger is about five years. So if <b>you</b> <b>continue</b> the vaccination project for five years, then the majority of animals that were there at the beginning will have died out and that vaccination programme is leading towards a clean and healthy badger population." ...|$|E

KG said later in a Channel 9 tribute to Hookes that after the first two balls went past the edge of the bat, he walked down the wicket and attempted to upset the youngster in his first game and [...] "gave him a huge spray". Hookes then sent the next four balls to the fence and after the over walked up to Cunningham and said: [...] "Listen old man, if <b>you</b> <b>continue</b> to bowl those wobbly little inswingers the next four will go over the fence and not into the fence."

He loves being in the very belly of the beast, yet he wishes he was something that'd cause it to throw up too. He wants not only to bite the hand that feeds but to shove it into an industrial mincer and stomp the resultant pulp into the dirt, yet pop, as long as <b>you</b> <b>continue</b> to make it money, would let you sexually abuse its grandmother.

2500|$|Military {{personnel}} used Rudyard's Kipling's poem [...] "The White Man's Burden" [...] {{to explain}} their imperialistic actions in Cuba, the Philippines, and Puerto Rico {{and the need for}} the United States to help the [...] "dark-skinned Barbarians" [...] reach modern sanitary standards. American actions abroad before, during, and after the war emphasized a need for proper sanitation habits especially on behalf of the natives. Natives who refuse to oblige with American health standards and procedures risked fines or imprisonment. One penalty in Puerto Rico included a $10 fine for a failure to vaccinate and an additional $5 fine for any day <b>you</b> <b>continue</b> to be unvaccinated, refusal to pay resulted in ten or more days of imprisonment. If entire villages refused the army's current sanitation policy at any given time they risked being burnt to the ground in order to preserve {{the health and safety of}} soldiers from endemic smallpox and yellow fever. Vaccines were forcibly administered to the Puerto Ricans, Cubans, and Filipinos. Military personnel in Puerto Rico provided Public Health services which culminated in military orders that mandated vaccinations for children before they were six months as well as a general vaccination order. By the end of 1899 in Puerto Rico alone the U.S. military and other hired native vaccinators called practicantes, vaccinated an estimated 860,000 natives in a five-month period. This period began the United States' movement toward an expansion of medical practices that included [...] "tropical medicine" [...] in an attempt to protect the lives of soldiers abroad.|$|E

MTV spokeswoman Linda Alexander said, [...] "The themes of the video are clearly aimed at a more adult audience. It is not appropriate for a general viewing audience". Madonna herself said she understood the channel's ban on the video; [...] "MTV plays to a huge audience {{and a lot of them}} are children, and a lot of themes I'm exploring in my videos aren't meant for children, so I understand that they say I can't show it [...] I accept it". Rolling Stones Anthony DeCurtis said that [...] "This is pretty much normal Madonna fare, [...] But how much longer can <b>you</b> <b>continue</b> mining sexuality?

Similarly, David Browne from Entertainment Weekly, asked [...] "Haven’t we seen most of this stuff before? Can we be bored with the subject matter already? [...] no emotion is attached to the mechanics of these acts, so it’s difficult to identify with or care about the characters".
