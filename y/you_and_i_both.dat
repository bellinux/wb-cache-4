500|$|After Alberta's {{two most}} {{prominent}} Liberals, Peter Talbot and Frank Oliver, {{made it clear}} that they were not interested, DeVeber considered himself as a possible candidate. [...] Less than two months before Alberta's formal creation, he wrote to his colleague in the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories, Alexander Cameron Rutherford, that the possibilities [...] "practically came to <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I,</b> <b>both</b> of us weak enough God knows but we have the sense to see it." [...] DeVeber's belief that he may be appointed premier does not appear to have been well-founded: his opposition to the introduction of party lines earned him the enmity of some Liberals, not least because it aligned him with Haultain, a Conservative. [...] In the estimation of historian L. G. Thomas, DeVeber's fellow Liberals [...] "were not inclined to take him too seriously" [...] as a potential premier.|$|E
2500|$|Gilbert {{wrote to}} a colleague, [...] "I {{sometimes}} wish I had never built the Woolworth Building because I fear it may be regarded as my only work and <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>both</b> know that {{whatever it may be}} in dimension and in certain lines it is after all only skyscraper." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{dare say}} now, uncle Ro, it would strike most Europeans as {{singular}} {{that a man}} {{should be proud of}} having been born an American--Manhattanese, as <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>both</b> were." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A Hajji {{is one of}} a class, Sir George Templemore," [...] Eve {{at length}} said, [...] "to which <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have <b>both</b> the honour of belonging." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, damn Jocelyn Thew!" [...] Crawshay replied. [...] "I {{should think}} it most unlikely. <b>You</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have <b>both</b> seen the man's dossier. Most cold-blooded person alive." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Franco, I've got to {{send you}} away. It's a hard case, Franco, but <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> must <b>both</b> submit to orders. So go off, Franco, {{as fast as you}} can." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now listen, Percival. I {{will put}} our {{position}} plainly before you, as I understand it, and you shall say if I am right or wrong. <b>You</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>both</b> {{came back to}} this house from the Continent with our affairs very seriously embarrassed--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps not, but I like him; for he {{has taught}} me all that I know of woodcraft, and I'm certain that if <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>both</b> leave him he'll be sure {{to return to the}} new {{settlement}} {{at the south end of}} Ontario, and you know what the end of that would be." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{no doubt}} you will get another step, Bull. After the way the {{regiment}} suffered, and with poor Macwitty killed, and <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>both</b> badly wounded, they are sure to give you your step," [...] and indeed when, on their arrival, they saw the Gazette, they found that both had been promoted.|$|E
6000|$|Deringham {{watched her}} closely. [...] "I only wished you to {{understand}} the position, and to remember that <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> are <b>both</b> to some extent {{at the mercy of}} our rancher kinsman," [...] he said.|$|R
6000|$|... "Extraordinary!" [...] Frank said, [...] "to {{think that}} <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> should <b>both</b> {{have been through}} this campaign, and on {{opposite}} sides. Why, we must have been within musket shot of each other a score of times." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> are <b>both</b> seconds--and {{these two}} gentlemen can {{obviously}} fight {{in front of}} us. You, he-he, are the king. I am God; really, they could hardly have better supporters. They {{have come to the}} right place." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Excellently well arranged, Guy. You thought, Sir John, that I was {{somewhat}} rash {{to leave the}} defence solely {{to the charge of}} this son of yours, but you see the lad was ready at all points, and I will warrant me that the castle would have held out under him as long a time as if <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>both</b> had been in command of it." ...|$|E
60|$|There were ambassadors from Holland that day, to intercede for {{the unhappy}} King, whom <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>both</b> wish the Parliament had spared; {{but they got}} no answer. The Scottish Commissioners interceded too; so did the Prince of Wales, by a letter in which he offered as the next heir to the throne, to accept any {{conditions}} from the Parliament; so did the Queen, by letter likewise.|$|E
60|$|For {{a daring}} and {{dangerous}} enterprise {{of a similar}} character you would to-day be the man of all my acquaintances whom I would select. <b>You</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>both</b> anticipated {{that the cause of}} the country would be advanced by making the attempt to provision Fort Sumter, even if it should fail; and it is no small consolation now to feel that our anticipation is justified by the result.|$|E
60|$|ATTEN. <b>I</b> think <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> are <b>both</b> of a mind; {{for just}} now I was {{thinking}} {{to call you}} back to him also. And pray now, since it is your own motion to return again to him, let us discourse {{a little more of}} his quiet and still death.|$|R
5000|$|Lord Lovat {{instructed}} {{his personal}} piper, Bill Millin, to pipe the commandos ashore, {{in defiance of}} specific orders not to allow such an action in battle. When Private Millin demurred, citing the regulations, he recalled later, Lord Lovat replied: “Ah, but that’s the English War Office. <b>You</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> are <b>both</b> Scottish, <b>and</b> that doesn’t apply.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pierre {{would have}} us hide him in the shed. I know not how that may {{advantage}} us; {{but let me tell}} you, Saul Ogden, that little Frenchie has got more sound sense in one side of that head of his than <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> in <b>both</b> ours put together. Now do as he has said, and we will listen to him afterwards." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, between you, {{keep an eye}} on her," [...] Hunterleys advised. [...] "And, Sidney, I don't want to make {{a coward}} of you, and <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>both</b> know that if there's danger ahead it's our job to face it, but have a care up at the Villa Mimosa. I don't fancy the law of this Principality would see you out of any trouble if they got an idea that you were an English Secret Service man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You will understand," [...] Mannering said, as the brougham drove off, [...] "that you and I are {{speaking}} together merely as friends. I have nothing official {{to say to}} you. It would be presumption on my part {{to assume that the}} time is ripe for anything definite while you are still at the head of an unbeaten Government. But one learns to read the signs of the times. I think that <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>both</b> know that you cannot last the session." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Some one has," [...] Crawshay replied bitterly, [...] "and <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>both</b> {{know who}} it is, Miss Beverley. But," [...] he went on, holding the gangway railing as she turned to descend, [...] "it's only {{the first part of}} the game that's over. Our friend has won on the sea, but I have an idea that we shall have him on land. We shall have him yet, and we'll catch him red-handed if I have {{anything}} to do with it. Will you wish us luck?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Miss Bombien telegraphed me {{you were}} lost, so I came by the first train and have been searching {{everywhere}} for <b>you.</b> Thompson <b>and</b> <b>I</b> had <b>both</b> nearly despaired, for we feared our little ones had been drowned." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Last Monday," [...] Bellamy went on, {{leaning forward}} and {{speaking}} in a soft but very distinct undertone, [...] "a man was murdered late {{at night in the}} heart of the city--within one hundred yards of the Stock Exchange. The papers called it a mysterious murder. No one knows who the man was, or who committed the crime, or why. <b>You</b> <b>and</b> <b>I,</b> Laverick, <b>both</b> know a little more than the rest of the world." ...|$|R
6000|$|Howells condoled {{with him}} on his failure to see the President, [...] "but," [...] he added, [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> had <b>both</b> been there, our {{combined}} [...] skill would have no doubt procured us to be expelled from the White [...] House by Fred Douglass. But the thing {{seems to be a}} complete [...] failure as it was." [...] Douglass at this time being the Marshal of [...] Columbia, gives special point to Howells's suggestion.|$|R
6000|$|... "The poor {{creature}} {{is under the}} darkest of clouds. Oh she came to triumph, but she remained to talk something {{in the nature of}} sense! She put herself completely in my hands--she does me the honour to intimate that of all her friends I'm the most disinterested. After she had announced to me that Lord Iffield was utterly committed to her and that for the present I was absolutely {{the only person in the}} secret, she arrived at her real business. She had had a suspicion of me ever since that day at Folkestone when I asked her for the truth about her eyes. The truth is what <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>both</b> guessed. She's in very bad danger." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{scarcely}} know," [...] Deane said, [...] "how we are {{to continue}} this discussion. For some reason or other, you are sitting there within {{a few feet of}} me and denying something which we both know to be the truth. You have a motive, I suppose, but whatever that motive may be, you cannot imperil it by speaking openly here. We are absolutely alone. There is not a soul within hearing. <b>You</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>both</b> know, Miss Rowan, that you hold that paper to obtain which your brother risked his life and met with such misfortune. It would be his wish, I know, that you should give it to me. The terms I offered him for its recovery were surely liberal. If you think otherwise, tell me your price. We are alone. You are not giving yourself away. Tell me your price!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For you! For you I {{will throw}} away money, lives--all the lives but mine! What {{you want is}} a man, a master that will let you put the heel of your shoe on his neck; not that skulker, who will get tired of you in a year--and you of him. And then what? You are not the one to sit still; neither am I. I live for myself, and you shall live for yourself, too--not for a Swedish baron. They make a {{convenience}} of {{people like you and}} me. A gentleman is better than an employer, but an equal partnership against all the 'yporcrits is the thing for you and me. We'll go on wandering the world over, <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>both</b> free and both true. You are no cage bird. We'll rove together, for we are of them that have no homes. We are born rovers!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think every}} man {{would like to}} come of an ancient and honourable race," [...] said the Colonel, in his honest way. [...] "As you like your father to be an honourable man, why not your grandfather, and his {{ancestors}} before him? But if we can't inherit a good name, at least we can do our best to leave one, my boy; and that is an ambition which, please God, <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> will <b>both</b> hold by." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "True, {{but if a}} man doesn't do his best, what then? Or if he is so {{careless}} {{about learning}} his duty that he scarce knows what it is, and in consequence falls into sundry gross mistakes, what then? Moreover, suppose that <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I,</b> having <b>both</b> done our duty perfectly up {{to the time of}} the mutiny, were now to go back to England and say, like the bad boys, `We will never do it again,' what would come of it, think you?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Mr. Harrison," [...] he said, [...] "I am engaged just now, as {{you have}} doubtless surmised, in certain {{investigations}} {{on behalf of the}} usual third party whom we need not name. Those investigations have reached a pitch which might possibly lead me into a position of some--well, I might almost say danger. <b>You</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>both</b> know that there are weapons in this place which can be made use of by persons wholly without scruples, which are scarcely available at home. I want you to keep your eyes open. I have very few friends here whom I can wholly trust. It is my purpose to call in here every morning at ten o'clock for my letters, and if I fail to arrive within half-an-hour of that time without having given you verbal notice, something will have happened to me. You understand what I mean?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No {{honest man}} will deny it," [...] said the scout, a little nettled at the implied {{distrust}} of his {{explanation of the}} mystery of the tides; [...] "and I grant that it is true on the small scale, and where the land is level. But everything depends on what scale you look at things. Now, on the small scale, the 'arth is level; but on the large scale it is round. In this manner, pools and ponds, and even the great fresh-water lake, may be stagnant, as <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>both</b> know they are, having seen them; but when you come to spread water over a great tract, like the sea, where the earth is round, how in reason can the water be quiet? You might as well expect the river to lie still on the brink of those black rocks a mile above us, though your own ears tell you that it is tumbling over them at this very moment!" ...|$|E
6000|$|So far I {{have been}} writing in great sympathy with you, but now I [...] touch a point where our lines have not been the same. You have, I [...] think, courted the hostility of Parnell. Salisbury has {{carefully}} [...] avoided doing this, and last night he simply confined himself to [...] two conditions, which <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>both</b> think vital; namely, the [...] unity of the empire and an honourable regard {{to the position of}} [...] the “minority,” i.e. the landlords. You will see in the [...] newspapers what Parnell, making for himself an opportunity, is [...] reported to have said about the elections in Ulster now at hand. [...] You have opened a vista which appears to terminate in a possible [...] concession to Ireland of full power to manage her own local [...] affairs. But I own my leaning to the opinion that, if that [...] consummation is in any way to be contemplated, action at a stroke [...] will be more honourable, less unsafe, less uneasy, than the [...] jolting process of a series of partial measures. This is my [...] opinion, but I have no intention, as at present advised, of [...] signifying it. I have all along in public declarations avoided [...] offering anything to the nationalists, beyond describing the [...] limiting rule which must govern the question. It is for them to [...] ask, and for us, as I think, to leave the space so defined as open [...] and unencumbered as possible. I am much struck by the increased [...] breadth of Salisbury’s declaration last night; he dropped the “I [...] do not see how.” ...|$|E
50|$|Publick: <b>I</b> think <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> are <b>both</b> sick {{of every}} {{interview}} mentioning the “It’s {{a show about}} failure” from five years ago. I don’t think we made {{a conscious effort to}} fight that or anything, but every year, we push what we do as writers a little more. An area we hadn’t gone into very much was positivity. I mean, all our victories are still satiric, but there are definitely places where we said, “I want to see these guys do something. I don’t want to just have everything fall on its face all the time.|$|R

I had my hand on my pistol, and felt so sure that an attack was {{intended}} that, the moment something passed before my face, although I {{had no idea what}} it was, I threw myself back and fired at the man behind me, with an instinctive feeling that my life depended on my speed. But it was only when, on looking at you, I saw a man in the act of throwing a noose round your neck, that I knew exactly what I had escaped." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "It is a {{cyclical}} thing," [...] says Stenz of the back-from-the-dead theme of [...] "Last Night's Dream." [...] "This couple are dead, {{but they are}} dreaming about the last night they were alive. That was a dream that I had. It was the last night I was alive in the dream; the next day, I thought about it and tried {{to put it into}} lyrics: 'In my dream last night <b>I</b> dreamt that <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> were <b>both</b> alive.” [...] "I am not sure how the couple died," [...] he continues. [...] "I never got that far in the dream. It was just a bizarre circumstance. Who knows why they are there, but they are there for a reason." ...|$|R
