Some of these introductions have been deliberate; the ring-necked pheasant, for example, has been introduced around the world as a game bird. Others have been accidental, such as the establishment of wild monk parakeets in several North American cities after their escape from captivity. Some species, including cattle egret, <b>yellow-headed</b> <b>caracara</b> and galah, have spread naturally far beyond their original ranges as agricultural practices created suitable new habitat.|$|E

50|$|A paleosubspecies of the <b>yellow-headed</b> <b>caracara</b> from Florida is also known.|$|E
50|$|The <b>yellow-headed</b> <b>caracara</b> {{has benefited}} from forest {{clearing}} for cattle ranching. Its status in Trinidad has changed from rare to fairly common, and it was first seen on Tobago in 1987. It adapts readily to urban areas and, together with species such as the American black vulture (Coragyps atratus), it {{is among the most}} commonly seen bird of prey in Latin American cities. Consequently, this wide-ranging species has been assigned a risk level of Least Concern category on the IUCN Red List. In Panama City for example, {{as a result of the}} increased urban sprawl, <b>yellow-headed</b> <b>caracara</b> pairs are frequently seen along the rooftops in suburban neighborhoods.|$|E
50|$|This is a bird of savanna, {{swamps and}} forest edges. Resident from Costa Rica south through Trinidad and Tobago to {{northern}} Argentina (the provinces of Misiones, Chaco, Formosa, Corrientes and Santa Fe), it is typically found from sea level to 1800 m, and occasionally to 2600 m above mean sea level. In southern South America, it {{is replaced by}} a close relative, the chimango caracara, whose range overlaps with that of the <b>yellow-headed</b> <b>caracara</b> in southern Brazil, northern Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay. A larger and stouter paleosubspecies, Milvago chimachima readei, occurred in Florida and possibly elsewhere some tens of thousand years ago, during the Late Pleistocene. According to the Peregrine Fund database, the <b>yellow-headed</b> <b>caracara</b> is expanding its range into Nicaragua.|$|E
50|$|When Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot first {{described}} the <b>yellow-headed</b> <b>caracara</b> in 1816, {{he gave it}} the scientific name Polyborus chimachima, putting {{it in the same}} genus {{as the rest of the}} caracaras. In 1824, German naturalist Johann Baptist von Spix created the genus Milvago for this species and the closely related chimango caracara.|$|E
50|$|The <b>yellow-headed</b> <b>caracara</b> (Milvago chimachima) is a {{bird of prey}} in {{the family}} Falconidae. It is found in {{tropical}} and subtropical South America and the southern portion of Central America. Unlike the falcons in the same family, the caracara is not a fast-flying aerial hunter, but is rather sluggish and often obtains food by scavenging.|$|E
50|$|Birds species {{include the}} <b>yellow-headed</b> <b>caracara</b> (Milvago chimachima), solitary tinamou (Tinamus solitarius), Amazon parrots, Muscovy duck (Cairina moschata), blue ground dove (Claravis pretiosa), violaceous quail-dove (Geotrygon violacea), chestnut-bellied seed finch (Oryzoborus angolensis), hummingbirds, toucans, pionus parrots, black-throated grosbeak (Saltator fuliginosus), rufous-bellied thrush (Turdus rufiventris), forpus parrots, great kiskadee (Pitangus sulphuratus), thraupis, woodpeckers, tataupa tinamou (Crypturellus tataupa), small-billed tinamou (Crypturellus parvirostris), partridges, seriemas, hawks and Cathartiformes.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the algae in their fur, brown-throated sloths also live commensally with a species of moth, Cryptoses choloepi, which lives in their fur, and lays its eggs in the dung.Jaguars and harpy eagles are among the few natural predators of the brown-throated sloth. The <b>yellow-headed</b> <b>caracara</b> has been observed to forage for small invertebrates in the fur of the sloths, apparently without the sloth being disturbed by the attention.|$|E
5000|$|The {{supposed}} [...] "Falco" [...] pisanus {{was actually}} a pigeon of the genus Columba, possibly the same as Columba omnisanctorum, which, in that case, would adopt the older species name of the [...] "falcon". The Eocene fossil [...] "Falco" [...] falconellus (or [...] "F." [...] falconella) from Wyoming is a bird of uncertain affiliations, maybe a falconid, maybe not; it certainly does not belong in this genus. [...] "Falco" [...] readei is now considered a paleosubspecies of the <b>yellow-headed</b> <b>caracara</b> (Milvago chimachima).|$|E

50|$|The <b>yellow-headed</b> <b>caracara</b> is 41 - 46 cm {{in length}} and weighs 325 g on average. Like many other birds of prey, the female {{is larger than the}} male, {{weighing}} 310 - 360 g against the male's 280 - 330 g. Apart from the difference in size, there is no significant sexual dimorphism in this species. It is broad-winged and long-tailed, somewhat resembling a small Buteo. The adult has a buff head, with a black streak behind the eye, and buff underparts. The upper plumage is brown with distinctive pale patches on the flight feathers of the wings, and the tail is barred cream and brown. The head and underparts of immature birds have dense brown mottling.|$|E
50|$|The <b>yellow-headed</b> <b>caracara</b> is omnivorous, {{and will}} eat reptiles, {{amphibians}} {{and other small}} animals as well as carrion. Birds are rarely if ever taken, and this species will not elicit warning calls from mixed-species feeding flocks that cross its path even in open cerrado habitat. It will also take ticks from cattle, and is sometimes called the tickbird. It has been observed also to forage for small invertebrates in the fur of brown-throated three-toed sloths and capybaras. In addition, at least younger birds are fond of certain fruits, {{such as those of}} the oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) and pequi (Caryocar brasiliense). It lays from five to seven brown-marked buff eggs in a stick nest in a tree.|$|E
50|$|Fruits {{start off}} dark purple, turning olive green and finally buffy green as they ripen, taking about 5-6 months. Ripe fruits {{are about the}} size of an orange. They {{resemble}} a mangosteen (another distantly related member of the Malpighiales) in having a few (usually 1-4) segments of pulpy pericarp inside the skin, yellow and with a typical strong taste and smell mixing sweet, fruity and cheesy aromas; this is derived mainly from volatile ethyl esters. Embedded in the mesocarp is a light-colored seed enclosed in a blackish shell covered with thin and tough woody spines, though spineless individuals exist in the wild. Both the mesocarp and the seed are edible for humans as well as many animals, including usually carnivorous species like the <b>yellow-headed</b> <b>caracara</b> (Milvago chimachima).|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: A <b>Yellow-headed</b> <b>Caracara</b> (Milvago chimachima) was {{submitted}} to the Ophthalmology Service of the Federal University of Bahia with a corneal abnormality. During ophthalmic evaluation the right cornea was stained positively with fluorescein; a blurred bullous lesion, with irregular surface, compatible with the diagnosis of bullous keratopathy was found. This is a rare condition in a bird which was treated successfully with a modified third eyelid flap associated with antibiotic and hyaluronic acid eye drops. The adopted therapeutic proved to be simple to implement and viable for repair of the bullous keratopathy in the <b>Yellow-headed</b> <b>caracara...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{interactive}} {{behaviors among}} birds are usually related to foraging and competition for resources. In some cases, birds can develop aggressive behaviors, such as mobbing behavior to reduce predation risk. This behavior {{is more common}} in smaller birds, thus this short communication describes this antagonistic conduct between two raptors. Seven displays of mobbing by the <b>Yellow-headed</b> <b>Caracara</b> over the Southern Caracara were recorded in the reproductive period of 2012. In this case, this aggressive behavior could be held as a preventive action against predation of nests and newborn chicks...|$|E
30|$|The {{abundance}} {{recorded with}} the roadside point transect method (9.38 ind[*]·[*][10  km 2] − 1 [*]·[*]h− 1) was around 2.5 {{times higher than}} that recorded with the roadside strip transect method (3.55 ind[*]·[*][10  km 2] − 1 [*]·[*]h− 1) (p[*]=[*] 0.05) (Table  1). All species showed higher abundances when surveyed by roadside point transects than roadside strip transects (Table  1). Results for the ordinary abundance (number of individuals/transect) were similar in both cases. All but four species (Roadside Hawk, Short-tailed Hawk, <b>Yellow-headed</b> <b>Caracara,</b> and American Kestrel) had higher ordinary abundances recorded on roadside point transects (Table  1).|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The Caracarini falcons {{are among}} the most {{versatile}} birds of prey, and their variable diet includes fishes, which may be taken as carrion. However, fishing behaviour is described for two species. Here we describe the Chimango Caracara (Milvago chimango) fishing at an estuary in Chile, Pacific coast of South America. The caracara flew and glided close to water surface, hovering on occasions. After such a hovering, the bird plunged and attempted to snatch a prey with its talons. If successful, the caracara carried the fish in its talons and landed on an adjacent beach where the prey was torn apart and eaten. The ‘glide-hover ’ technique of the Chimango Caracara differs slightly from the fishing recorded for the closely related <b>Yellow-headed</b> <b>Caracara</b> (Milvago chimachima), which plunges to the prey from a nearby perch (‘perch to water’). The Black Caracara (Daptrius ater) picks up fish individually with its bill or talons while staying on a river bank (‘ground foraging’). Thus, at least three fishin...|$|E
