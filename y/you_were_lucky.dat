2500|$|Riverside Rancho, {{operated}} by Marty Landau, had a [...] dance floor, three bars and a restaurant. According to Merle Travis, [...] "At that time [...] "Western swing" [...] was a household word. Al Dexter {{had had a}} million-seller on his [...] "Pistol Packin' Mama" [...] record. Bob Wills was heard on every jukebox with this [...] "San Antonio Rose". T. Texas Tyler was doing well with his [...] "Remember Me (When the Candlelights are Gleaming)". It was practically impossible to wedge your way into the Palace Barn where Red Murrell and his band were playing. A mile down the hill was the Riverside Rancho. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>lucky</b> to find a ticket on a Wednesday night. Tex Williams and his Western Caravan were playing there." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'You {{were asking}} for the quarter of our people. You must be à stranger, indeed, in Jerusalem, to suppose that a Frank would speak to a Jew. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>lucky</b> to get neither kicked nor cursed.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{will make}} you a good wife, Jamie. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>lucky</b> to have found such a dear, sweet girl. It's a blessing to us to think that <b>you</b> will <b>be</b> so happy." ...|$|R
5000|$|There is a {{monument}} erected {{in memory of}} the cyclist Alvaro Fernandez. You can read some verses of Maria Piedad Mendizabal:"If <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>lucky</b> one day walking around my Rioja ..." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] exclaimed Gust, [...] "there <b>is</b> where <b>you</b> <b>are</b> wrong. [...] There <b>is</b> where <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>lucky</b> that <b>you</b> have {{an educated}} man {{like me to}} tell you what to do. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> an ignorant savage, Momulla, and so you know nothing of wireless." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, son, listen," [...] began Steele. His {{calling me}} that was a joke, yet I did not feel it. [...] "You've made a better start than I could have figured. Neal said <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>lucky.</b> Perhaps. But you've got brains.|$|E
6000|$|... "That’s me," [...] {{said the}} other. [...] "It’s quite by {{accident}} I heard {{where you were}} living, George; I offered to go and sling my hammock with old Dingle {{for a week or}} two, and he told me. Nice quiet little place, Seacombe. Ah, <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>lucky</b> to get your pension, George." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This is a beastly climate," [...] he grumbled. [...] "It {{is awful}} {{to think that}} we are likely to get another two months of it; and shall then have to wait at least another, before the country is dry enough to make a move. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>lucky</b> in getting in, just now, before it began." ...|$|E
5000|$|He {{knows what}} I {{am going to}} say even before I say it—maybe even before I have thought it—and that <b>is</b> very rare. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>lucky</b> if <b>you</b> meet someone like that once in your life. Pressburger on Powell ...|$|R
50|$|The {{best thing}} about this pagoda is the {{beautiful}} view of surrounding city from the top; and if <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>lucky</b> to <b>be</b> visiting in the evening, {{you will get a}} chance to see one of the best sunsets in Indonesia.|$|R
6000|$|... 'That {{was when}} 'e wanted for to wash 'isself in the Fort Ditch,' Ortheris explained. 'Said {{there was too}} much beer in the Barrack water-butts for a God-fearing man. <b>You</b> <b>was</b> <b>lucky</b> in gettin' orf with wot you did, Mulvaney.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, rooinek," [...] they exclaimed, [...] "you are a brave {{young fellow}} {{to make a}} fight alone against a dozen of us. It would have been wiser if you had gone away when <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>lucky</b> enough to get up the bank without being hit. What {{was the use of}} staying by your dead comrade?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, we {{came close}} to it," [...] said Songbird. [...] "And when we got in to port some of the {{passengers}} had the captain arrested for ill treatment. But we didn't wait for that. We were wild to know {{what had become of}} you, and so we chartered this tug and began a hunt. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>lucky</b> to be picked up by such a nice craft as this." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{must have}} been very funny; but as long as Jim is always {{bringing}} somebody over from the mill, I don't see how I can go to those places. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>lucky,</b> my dear, to escape from the new Division Superintendent last night; he was insufferable to Jim with his talk of his friend the San Francisco millionaire, and to me with his cheap society airs. I do hate a provincial fine gentleman." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{will go back}} to your regiment, and {{endeavour}} {{to serve}} your country with better spirit. You may thank the jury that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> not sent to prison, and your good fortune that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> not at the front when you tried to commit this cowardly act. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>lucky</b> to <b>be</b> alive." ...|$|R
5000|$|Crocodile {{sighting}} {{can only}} be carried out at night. A chartered boat is required to sneak the crocodile along the Likau River. Please use a powerful torch or spot light {{the eyes of the}} crocodile. If <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>lucky</b> <b>you</b> might <b>be</b> able to see the reptile's whole figure.|$|R
5|$|Sometimes {{you open}} your mouth and you don't know what <b>you</b> <b>are</b> going to say, and {{whatever}} comes out is the starting point. If that happens and <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>lucky,</b> it can usually {{be turned into a}} song. This song is a prayer and personal statement between me, the Lord, and whoever likes it.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Oh, my {{expressions}} {{have been}} selected with scrupulous accuracy,’ he replied. ‘How did I find you, sir, when I came to announce this catastrophe? You {{were sitting on the}} hearthrug playing, like a silly baby, with a servant, were you not, and the floor all scattered with gold and bank paper? There was a tableau for you! It was I who came, and <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>lucky</b> in that. It might have been any one—your cousin as well as another.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{the first}} place, {{the chances are}} in favour of getting your head laid open with a sword cut. These fellows know they don't {{stand a chance against}} Englishmen's fists, and they very soon whip out their swords. In the second place, you would have to pass the night in a crowded lockup, where you would be half smothered before morning. And lastly, if <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>lucky</b> enough not to get a week's {{confinement}} in jail, you would have a smart fine to pay.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{no longer}} wonder, Lindsay, at your having {{attained}} {{the rank of}} captain so young. That old nurse of yours {{must have been a}} trump, indeed; but certainly it is wonderful that you should have lived, first as a peasant and then at the Peishwa's court, so long without anyone having had a suspicion that you were an Englishman. Fancy your meddling in politics, being regarded as a friend of the Peishwa and this minister of his, and being the means of getting the latter out of prison, and so perhaps averting a war between the Mahrattas and Bombay! That was a ticklish business, too, at Nagpore; and <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>lucky</b> in coming so well out of it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! to three! {{obliged to}} discuss your own most private {{concerns}} {{as well as}} mine with three intimate friends! <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>lucky,</b> sir, to have so many intimate friends. As my concerns have been made known to {{them as well as}} your own, may I ask who they are?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Climbing {{over that}} beastly wall at The Grange," [...] {{she said with}} a merry look. [...] "Oh, what fun we did have! We climbed it together. We were dreadful tomboys in those days, dear, you and I: but <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>luckier</b> than I <b>was,</b> and didn't cut {{yourself}} with the bottle-glass." ...|$|R
60|$|THE BISHOP. So you shall, my dear, if <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>lucky.</b> But <b>you</b> {{know you}} neednt marry them all. Think {{of all the}} buttons {{you would have to}} sew on. Besides, nothing is more dreadful than a husband who keeps telling you {{everything}} he thinks, and always wants to know what you think.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{certainly}} {{have gone through}} some queer adventures," [...] the major said, {{when he had finished}} his relation; [...] "and {{there is no doubt that}} you have had wonderful luck. In the first place, if that bullet had gone half an inch lower, you would not have been one of the four white survivors of that ugly business at Ramoo; then <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>lucky</b> that they did not chop off your head, either when they first took you, or when they got you to Ava. Then again, it was lucky that Bandoola sent a special message that he wanted you kept as an interpreter for himself, and that the official in charge of you turned out a decent fellow, and aided you to make your escape.|$|E
60|$|Scott was {{the biggest}} hitter in the School. Mr Yorke {{was one of the}} masters. He bowled slow leg-breaks, mostly half-volleys and long hops. Pillingshot had a sort of instinctive idea that fielding out in the deep with Mr Yorke bowling and Scott batting would not {{contribute}} largely to the gaiety of his afternoon. Fielding deep at the nets meant that you {{stood in the middle of}} the football field, where there was no telling what a ball would do if it came at you along the ground. If <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>lucky</b> you escaped without injury. Generally, however, the ball bumped and deprived you of wind or teeth, according to the height to which it rose. He began politely, but firmly, to excuse himself.|$|E
60|$|And so on, by the hour, the man's tongue would go. He could NOT forget any thing. It {{was simply}} impossible. The most trivial details {{remained}} as distinct and luminous in his head, {{after they had}} lain there for years, as the most memorable events. His {{was not simply a}} pilot's memory; its grasp was universal. If he were talking about a trifling letter he had received seven years before, he was pretty sure to deliver you the entire screed from memory. And then without observing that he was departing from the true line of his talk, he was more than likely to hurl in a long-drawn parenthetical biography of the writer of that letter; and <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>lucky</b> indeed if he did not take up that writer's relatives, one by one, and give you their biographies, too.|$|E
50|$|The {{reason is}} obvious: {{a letter in}} the Guardian or Independent will reach many {{thousands}} of people. Other, newer media will reach hundreds if <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>lucky.</b> Letters to the editor deliver impact - {{one of the reasons}} why those of us who are politically active want to impart our thoughts to a wider audience in the first place.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, {{it is all}} right,' {{answered}} the cat. 'Snake, die!' And the snake died, and the two brothers skinned it. They then folded the skin up into a very small parcel, and the cat tucked it into his mane, for snakes' skins can do all sorts of wonderful things, if <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>lucky</b> enough {{to have one of}} them.|$|R
60|$|BENTLEY. What luck! And what a smash! <b>You</b> <b>are</b> a <b>lucky</b> chap, I {{can tell}} you.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{there is}} no doubt that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>lucky,</b> Lisle," [...] the colonel said, when he had brought his story to a conclusion. [...] "The pluck of your action, in getting Colonel Houghton off and staying yourself, appealed {{strongly}} to the Afridis; and caused their chief to decide to retain you as a hostage, instead of killing you at once. I do not suppose that he really thought that he would gain much, by saving you; for he must have known that we are in a hurry to get down through the passes, and must consider it very doubtful whether we should ever return. Still, no doubt he would have detained you and, in the spring, sent down to say that you were in his hands; and in that way would have endeavoured to make terms for your release. But your assistance when he was attacked, and your readiness to take part with his people, entirely changed his attitude towards you.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now {{let me ask}} you," [...] he continued: [...] "do {{you think}} you are worse off than John Hiram {{intended}} to make you? Have you not shelter, and food, and leisure? Have you not much more? Have you not every indulgence which you are capable of enjoying? Have you not twice better food, twice a better bed, ten times more money in your pocket than you were ever able to earn for yourselves before <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>lucky</b> enough to get into this place? And now you send a petition to the bishop, asking for a hundred pounds a year! I tell you what, my friends; you are deluded, and made fools of by wicked men who are acting for their own ends. You will never get a hundred pence a year more than what you have now: it is very possible that you may get less; it is very possible that my lord the bishop, and your warden, may make changes--" ...|$|E
60|$|To Claire an {{automobile}} was a shiny thing with padded seats, {{in which you}} rode if <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>lucky</b> enough to know somebody who owned one. She {{had no wish to}} go more deeply into the matter. Dudley Pickering's attitude towards automobiles, on the other hand, more nearly resembled that of a surgeon towards the human body. To him a car was something to dissect, something with an interior both interesting to explore and fascinating to talk about. Claire listened with a radiant display of interest, but she had her doubts as to whether any amount of money would make it worth while to undergo this sort of thing for life. She was still in this hesitant frame of mind when she entered Reigelheimer's Restaurant, and it perturbed her that she could not come to some definite decision on Mr Pickering, for those subtle signs which every woman can recognize and interpret told her that the latter, having paved the way by talking machinery for a week, was about to boil over and speak of higher things.|$|E
5000|$|Danny Saunders, {{writing for}} The Living Tradition, {{comments}} [...] "I {{suspect that the}} fame of this album together with {{the length of time}} since its first release will mean that everyone that wanted this work will already own it. If <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>lucky</b> enough to <b>be</b> coming to The Brendan Voyage for the first time, having read the label, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> in for a treat." ...|$|R
50|$|Trekking Due to Khao Sok being a {{tropical}} rainforest, {{there are many}} wild animals such as “wild elephants, serow, tigers, Malayan sun bears and over 180 bird species to watch”. If <b>you</b> <b>are</b> interested trekking <b>you</b> can hire a local guide. If <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>lucky,</b> <b>you</b> will find Rafflesia Kerrii Meijer, and visit waterfalls. Moreover, you {{can stay in the}} forest at night and cook with bamboo.|$|R
5000|$|... "If <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>lucky</b> {{enough to}} have lived in Paris as a young man, then {{wherever}} you go {{for the rest of}} your life, it stays with <b>you,</b> for Paris <b>is</b> a movable feast."
