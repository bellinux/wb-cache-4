25|$|A {{few years}} after Miró’s 1918 Barcelona solo exhibition, he settled in Paris where he {{finished}} a number of paintings that he had begun on his parents’ summer home and farm in Mont-roig del Camp. One such painting, The Farm, showed a transition to a more individual style of painting and certain nationalistic qualities. Ernest Hemingway, who later purchased the piece, compared the artistic accomplishment to James Joyce’s Ulysses and described it by saying, “It has in it all that you feel about Spain when you are there and all that <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>when</b> you are away and cannot go there. No one else {{has been able to}} paint these two very opposing things.” Miró annually returned to Mont-roig and developed a symbolism and nationalism that would stick with him throughout his career. Two of Miró’s first works classified as Surrealist, Catalan Landscape (The Hunter) and The Tilled Field, employ the symbolic language that was to dominate the art of the next decade.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with MTV News, Bernthal stated that Walsh was suffering from the [...] "loneliness <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>when</b> you're right there with them and you can't be {{with them in the}} way you want." [...] Bernthal applauded the writers for such changes, and felt that the storyline never devitalized. [...] "The people that Shane loved more {{than anyone else in the}} world before the apocalypse are still very much alive and still very much with him, but he'll never be with them in the way he wants to and the way he once was. Every relationship—Shane/Carl, Shane/Lori and Shane/Rick—it's tainted and fractured. When you suffer from that kind of loneliness, it brings out the worst in you." ...|$|E
500|$|September saw Arsenal win all {{of their}} league matches. At home to Aston Villa, Šuker scored his first goals for the club and earnt the praise of his manager Wenger: [...] "He is just obsessed by goals. <b>You</b> <b>feel</b> <b>when</b> he is inside the box he hits the target." [...] Away to Southampton, {{it was the other}} signing Henry who scored his first goal for Arsenal. The player, on as a substitute, {{received}} the ball from Tony Adams and with his back to goal [...] "some 20 yards out", turned and curled it past goalkeeper Paul Jones. Henry later admitted his failure to score for Arsenal before then was getting him down: [...] "My goal today was very important for me. I have missed at least 14 or 15 chances for Arsenal and my confidence was low." [...] Kanu scored the only goal of the match against Watford, which moved Arsenal in third position, two points behind leaders Manchester United.|$|E

2500|$|A {{story that}} haunted Burton {{up to his}} death (recounted {{in some of his}} obituaries) was that he came close to being {{discovered}} one night when he lifted his robe to urinate rather than squatting as an Arab would. It was said that he was seen by an Arab and, in order to avoid exposure, killed him. Burton denied this, pointing out that killing the boy would almost certainly have led to his being discovered as an impostor. Burton became so tired of denying this accusation that he took to baiting his accusers, although he was said to enjoy the notoriety and even once laughingly claimed to have done it. A doctor once asked him: [...] "How do <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>when</b> you have killed a man?", Burton retorted: [...] "Quite jolly, what about you?". When asked by a priest about the same incident Burton is said to have replied: [...] "Sir, I'm proud to say I have committed every sin in the Decalogue." [...] Stanley Lane-Poole, a Burton detractor, reported that Burton [...] "confessed rather shamefacedly that he had never killed anybody at any time." ...|$|E
2500|$|IGN's Douglass C. Perry {{scored the}} PlayStation 2 and Xbox {{versions}} 8.3 out of 10.

The Thing is well-paced, designed with an excellent variety of levels [...] Everything {{is consistent with the}} movie, the theme of which has been handled with exquisite care and thought. With the exception of the blood test goofs and the rather thin storyline, The Thing warrants your time and money." [...] Steve Polak scored the PC version 8.5 out of 10, writing [...] "The Thing is for the most part an immersive and enjoyable game. The visuals and sound are top notch and the sense of desperation <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>when</b> you are stuck outside and about to succumb to the elements or being hunted by packs of the foul creatures is very real. The squad based elements and the way you keep your men from losing their minds also adds to the depth of the play experience." ...|$|E

60|$|My brother, {{when you}} see these tricks played upon other men, the gall rises black within your breast, and you loudly condemn wiles which are so womanly, but which are so unworthy of women.

The gall is not so black, the {{condemnation}} less loud; your own merit seems to excuse the preference which is shown you; your heart first forgives and then applauds.

But take care, and see how <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>when</b> you find {{yourself}} alone, and in triumph." [...] William resented these things, and continued the chase. He had taken {{the girl on the}} river. [...] "If you saw her, mother, you would know how I feel. Tall and elegant, with the clearest of clear, transparent olive complexions, hair as black as jet, and such grey eyes--bright, mocking, like lights on water at night. It is all very well to be a bit satirical till you see her. And she dresses as well as any woman in London. I tell you, your son doesn't half put his head up when she goes walking down Piccadilly with him." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{what will}} <b>you</b> <b>feel,</b> <b>when</b> {{you know from}} history how this statute passed, and what were the motives, and what the mode of making it? A party in this nation, enemies to {{the system of the}} Revolution, were in {{opposition}} to the government of King William. They knew that our glorious deliverer was an enemy to all persecution. They knew that he came to free us from slavery and Popery, out of a country where a third of the people are contented Catholics under a Protestant government. He came with a part of his army composed of those very Catholics, to overset the power of a Popish prince. Such is the effect of a tolerating spirit; and so much is liberty served in every way, and by all persons, by a manly adherence to its own principles. Whilst freedom is true to itself, everything becomes subject to it, and its very adversaries are an instrument in its hands.|$|E

She really looks upon boys as good comrades, and she is pleased when she has dozens of them tagging round, simply because she likes to be popular and to be thought popular. Even Alex and Alonzo--I'll never be able to think of those two names separately after this--are to her just two playfellows who want her to play with them all their lives. I'm glad we met her, and I'm glad we went to Old St. John's. I believe I've put forth a tiny soul-root into Kingsport soil this afternoon. I hope so. I hate to feel transplanted." ...|$|E

The gold's there--that you're sure of--piled up {{by nature}} during I don't know how many {{thousand}} years, but you have to stake high {{if you want to get}} much of it out. One needs costly labour, teams--no end of them--breakers, and big gang-plough. The farmer who has nerve enough drills his last dollar into the soil in spring, but if he means to succeed it costs him more than that. He must give the sweat of his tensest effort, the uttermost toil of his body--all, in fact, that has been given him. Then he must shut his eyes tight to the hazards against him, or, and we can't all do that, look at them without wavering--the drought, the hail, the harvest frost. If his teams fall sick, or the season goes against him, he must work double tides. Still, it now and then happens that things go right, and the red wheat rolls ripe right back across the prairie.
