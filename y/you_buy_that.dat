500|$|The episode {{received}} much acclaim from television journalists. The storyline involving Joan's prostituting herself {{to secure the}} Jaguar account for Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce came in for particular analysis and scrutiny among journalists, as related to its execution and use of themes of female sexuality and sexual objectification.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that stress can trigger seizures {{for many people}} with epilepsy. In one survey of 177 patients, 58 per cent identified that seizures occurred more frequently when they were stressed, with seizures occurring sometimes days or weeks later (Mattson, 1991). Similar studies also indicate that stress is the most frequent trigger of seizures, and is linked with sleep deprivation and fatigue (Frucht, Quigg, Schwaner & Fountain, 2000). In a more recent survey of 89 patients, 64 per cent of people with epilepsy reported that they believed stress increased the frequency of their seizures (Haut, Vouyiouklis & Shinnar, 2003). 32 per cent had tried stress reduction techniques, and of those who hadn’t, 53 per cent were willing to try. However, {{it is not just}} stress, but also life events that are reported to influence seizure frequency. Major life events identified by people interviewed in the study include death, abuse, financial crisis, divorce, job loss, marriage and pregnancy/birth. Minor life events which increased seizures included family tension, arguments, time pressure, debt and traffic/car related events. It would seem to make sense that when managing an important issue like stress, using relaxation techniques which some benefits Feeling stressed, overwhelmed, and under pressure is a common experience for us all. The challenges and demands of modern day-to-day life can impact our physical and mental health, particularly if you also have epilepsy. So {{what can we do about}} it?
