500|$|At {{the podium}} interview, {{conducted}} by film director George Lucas, Lewis Hamilton expressed gratitude to his {{team and the}} fans at the venue. Felipe Massa, asked about his last lap fight with teammate Bottas, stated: [...] "I’m getting old for that! I even said to the team I’m getting old! The last three laps of the race I was fighting with my team-mate. It was very difficult but we managed to be here." [...] During the post-race press conference, Hamilton expressed surprise over his championship lead, since {{he had not been}} made aware of Rosberg's retirement at that point. When asked about the tyre pressure issue, Sebastian Vettel defended Hamilton, saying: [...] "I think it’s not fair to hand that question to Lewis because he doesn’t know what’s going on [...] In a lot of respect and fairness he {{did a very good job}} today and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> that." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cousins' {{popularity}} {{continued to}} increase over the following seasons. In 1998, the Herald Sun ran a two-page article across its centre pages about 20-year-old Cousins, titled [...] "West goes wild for the kid". The article portrayed Cousins as a sex symbol and [...] "football's answer to Brad Pitt". When asked about the article, he said the popularity [...] "comes with the territory... If {{you want to be}} a league footballer <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> that it is part of the game." [...] Sports agent Ricky Nixon approached Cousins in 1998 about managing his endorsement deals, because [...] "He's good-looking, he elected to stay in Perth and not play in Victoria, opposition coaches take notice of him and on top of that he's a future leader." [...] In 1999, International Management Group, who managed sports stars such as Tiger Woods and Pete Sampras, said they would like to sign Ben, as [...] "There is no doubt that he is now in the top bracket of players and has great marketing potential...

2500|$|Derek Martin {{said he was}} {{surprised}} by the new baby swap storyline when it was published in the media. Speaking on This Morning, Martin commented: [...] "I'm one of those actors – I don't know how many others do it – but when I get the scripts, I only read my bits. So I looked , 'Charlie leaves his grandson upstairs, goes downstairs, gets on the drink, gets drunk – the baby's dead'. So that's terrible guilt obviously – because I feel as though it's my fault that he's died. I {{was surprised}} when I saw the story come out – because I don't read the others' [...] – that it was a baby swap." [...] Discussing the surrounding controversy of the plot, Martin added: [...] "Don't forget, there's millions of people – there's 60 odd million here, and they've all got different opinions. Every subject, everything that comes up… everybody will have opinions about that. So therefore <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> that's the public – some are for, some are against, and that's the way it is." [...] He continues: Over the years, don't forget, EastEnders have always had subjects. When [...] brother had raped Kat and we didn't find out until later on, that was a very strong storyline. And when Little Mo was bashed by her husband Trevor. These stories are all part of real life." ...|$|E
2500|$|The A.V. Club {{reviewer}} Michaelangelo Matos {{opined that}} [...] "while One Life Stands mindset is Hot Chip's most overtly serious, {{the album is}} also its most musically accomplished. The melodies are Alexis Taylor and Joe Goddard's longest-lined, and the melodies often unfurl beautifully." [...] Ian Mathers of PopMatters viewed it as [...] "Hot Chip's most kinetic album" [...] and stated that [...] "One Life Stand may be less pleasingly idiosyncratic than Hot Chip's previous work, but it pays off in their most consistently winning set of songs to date. It's still not quite as raucous as their incredible live show, [...] but those who felt that Made in the Dark never built up enough momentum ought to find this one's straightforward drive more satisfying." [...] Scott Plagenhoef of Pitchfork named One Life Stand the band's [...] "most consistent and most complete record", but remarked that [...] "it's missing an A-list single on par with 'Boy From School', 'Over and Over', or 'Ready for the Floor'. It's also missing dance songs {{in the mode of}} the latter two, focusing instead on Hot Chip at their most lush and romantic." [...] Drowned in Sound's Hayden Woolley wrote that the album [...] "sees their familiar pick'n'mix genre-shopping combined with unprecedented levels of Mills & Boon sentimentality. It's a heady cocktail, but when mixed in the right proportions the results are stunning." [...] Jamie Fullerton of NME concluded that the album [...] "does have some of the best songs of the year on it. But, again, waiting for Hot Chip to make that classic album is a bit like waiting for an alcoholic parent to arrive at your birthday party. There's a kind of unconditional love that'll keep you hoping every time one comes around, but there may be a point where <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> that it's just never going to happen." [...] Chris Beanland of BBC Music felt that [...] "his is an imbalanced record, and one that leaves you frustrated rather than elated. But despite the blips, they have dished up at least two cerebral bangers here." [...] Andy Gill of The Independent characterised it as [...] "an album full of earnest endeavour, but lacking verve and creative zest." ...|$|E

500|$|However, Anderson {{conceded that}} Grade [...] "was {{not a man}} you could argue with. If he said [...] "No", <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> that he wouldn't change his mind." [...] Of Grade's decision, La Rivière conjectures, [...] "No one knows what was running through [...] mind ... but given {{the ease with which}} the 'Unwinese' element could have been removed [...] the series, it seems {{probable}} that he simply didn't like a lot of what he was seeing." [...] In a move that would lead to the discontinuation of the Supermarionation format, Anderson and Grade coordinated to transfer most of the production staff from the Century 21 base at the Slough Trading Estate in Berkshire to Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire for the commencement of filming on UFO, the Andersons' first full live-action series.|$|R
