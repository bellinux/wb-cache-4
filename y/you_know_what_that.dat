500|$|In {{addition}} to Borland's visual appearance, the band has also used elaborate stage setups in their performances. Their Ladies Night in Cambodia club tour visually {{paid tribute to}} the film Apocalypse Now, with an elaborate stage setup which featured an empty Jeep, camouflage mesh and palm trees. During the band's tour with Primus, Limp Bizkit took inspiration from Primus' trademark self-deprecatory slogan [...] "Primus sucks": Durst, Borland, Rivers, Otto and Lethal took the stage with middle fingers raised. According to Borland, [...] "they finger us back—and <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> means to us—that they love us. It's kind of like saying something is bad when you really mean good. Les Claypool came out {{the first night of}} the tour and got a big kick out of it. We figured it was the right idea. It makes hecklers go 'huh.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Ironically, {{the wheel}} stopped on Dawson {{the first time}} it was used, inspiring several panelists (including Dawson) to stand up from their places and leave the set {{momentarily}} out of disbelief. Rayburn yelled, [...] "Now wait a minute! Get back here!" [...] He then got the four panelists to sit back down, after which guest panelist Mary Wickes said, [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> wheel cost us? And it's right back to Richard!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Restricted by a low budget, Bava {{was unable}} to utilize opticals, so all of the film's {{extensive}} visual effects work were done [...] "in camera". Miniatures and forced perspective visuals are used throughout, with lots of colored fog adding atmosphere but also obscuring the sheer cheapness of the sets. Bava explained: [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> unknown planet was made of? A couple of plastic rocks — yes, two: one and one! — left over from a mythological movie made at Cinecittà! To assist the illusion, I filled the set with smoke." ...|$|E
5000|$|Following this, {{the narrator}} says, [...] "And <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that's</b> called, don't you?" [...] Then, several Cossacks dance {{across the screen}} {{in front of a}} concerned-looking man, {{representing}} the Soviet Union and to imply {{the answer to the question}} was communism (despite the fact that the Cossacks were traditionally opponents to the communist Bolsheviks).|$|R
6000|$|... 'A little book, {{merely a}} little book--could words be modester? Yet how stupendous its importance! Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> book <b>that</b> was?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> caused <b>that</b> ill-health? My boy, {{they spoke}} of your father to-day-—brutes that they were," [...] {{he could not help}} muttering.|$|R
60|$|News reaches me that Bob is {{laid down}} with diphtheria; and <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> means.|$|E
6000|$|... "She was frontier-born, of poor settlers, and <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> means--work, work, always work, work {{in plenty}} and without end.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ten to one, you do {{yourself}} injustice,' returned Dick. 'Besides, it's a freemasonry. I sketch myself, and <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> implies.' ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Alias never split. Music changed. We couldn't get {{our music}} out there. No {{one wanted to}} hear it anymore. Grunge was in and, <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what,</b> <b>that's</b> OK, 'cause music needs to do that. It needs to change all the time. That's how it stays fresh. Alias is still Steve and I. Alias will always be Steve and I. Steve and I will do a record {{tomorrow}} if the fans need one!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes,' said Albinia, 'Edmund {{has been}} {{out of the way of}} such things, but he consented, you know.' Then as her eyes grew liquid, 'A duck pond is a funny subject for sentiment, but oh! if <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> place has been to my {{imagination}} from the first, and how the wreaths of mist have wound themselves into spectres in my dreams, and stretched out white shrouds now for one, now for the other!' and she shuddered.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Hush! hush, Nuttie! <b>you</b> <b>know</b> {{that is not}} a {{right way}} of speaking. I cannot worry him now he is ill. <b>You</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> dreadful pain is!' ...|$|R
6000|$|D. Yes, you Dog, don't <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> {{incomparable}} noble genius my Lord Rochester sings {{upon the}} subject, I believe it unfeignedly, ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ten to one you do {{yourself}} injustice," [...] returned Dick. [...] "Besides, it's a freemasonry. I sketch myself, and <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> implies." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "May I assume then," [...] I continued, {{with some}} eagerness, [...] "that <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> is? You are acquainted, perhaps, with her parentage?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, for <b>you</b> I <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> means. Well, I {{have seen}} monsieur; <b>that</b> is <b>what</b> I wanted. He can't persuade {{me that he}} isn't very clever. Farewell." ...|$|R
60|$|MAN. I've not had two hours' {{undisturbed}} sleep {{since the}} war began. I'm on the staff: <b>you</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> means. I haven't closed my eyes for thirty-six hours.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Canler {{had asked}} for no security, and <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> dearie, <b>what</b> <b>that</b> will mean for me if papa cannot meet them. Oh, how I detest that man! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You will do it, young Bertie, {{or never}} darken my doors again. And <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> means. No more of Anatole's dinners for you." ...|$|E
60|$|Well; <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> was once. I {{have often}} told you:--a live sea- egg, covered with prickles, which crawls {{at the bottom}} of the sea.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh yes! People {{always do}} those things in love. Besides, the Sofi hasn't got a single white hair in her, and <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> always means!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How clever you are!" [...] {{she said}} gleefully, and caressed a button of his velvet coat. [...] "But <b>you</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> means! It {{does not mean}} that I love you--not merely that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is called}} phosphorescence," [...] replied the doctor, {{leaning over the}} bulwarks, and {{looking down at the}} fiery serpent that seemed as if it clung to the ship's rudder. [...] "But I dare say <b>you</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> means. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> fire-flies and glow-worms are?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, pshaw! {{perhaps it}} was {{somebody}} {{who was trying to}} spy on us," [...] put in Fred. [...] "If we tell the captain we will only be exposing ourselves, and I guess <b>you</b> all <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> means." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> chap has ben doin' lately?" [...] asked Silas of his master, one evening, as he {{received}} his orders for the next day.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, for that, yes!" [...] {{said his}} companion, {{with a little}} bitter laugh. [...] "It 's the darkest day of my life--and <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> means." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of one's being married, of course,--I suppose <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> is. No {{one must}} know {{anything}} about it. I {{want you to take}} me to Europe." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I can't. <b>You</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> picture {{means to}} me. But surely {{you could get}} the Nilghai to help you, and knock me down and tie me up. I shouldn't fight for the whiskey, but I should for the work.' ...|$|R
6000|$|AMERICAN. [Pausing in the {{deglutition}} of his eggs--affably] Pardon me, sir; I'd like to {{have you}} tell me why you called that little bit of a feller [...] "Herr Ober." [...] Reckon <b>you</b> would <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> means? Mr. Head Waiter.|$|R
6000|$|... "I did {{not turn}} her out of doors. I {{provided}} a fitting shelter for her. I gave her everything that she could want. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> happened. <b>That</b> man went down and was received there. I defy you, Mrs. Outhouse, {{to say that it}} was my fault." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nonsense!" [...] said Primrose, bent {{on being}} improving. [...] "Don't <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> old book of mamma's says, 'When will Miss Rosamond's {{education}} be finished?' She answered 'Never.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "... So I said 'Listen, Izzy, that'll {{be about}} all from you! My {{father was a}} gentleman, though I don't suppose <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> means, and I'm not accustomed....'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm on the dodge. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> means. I {{got in a}} shooting-scrape at {{home and}} had to run off. When it blows over I hope to go back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, a Pinkerton. But, sure, <b>you</b> wouldn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> is, acushla, nor what it {{may mean}} {{to the likes of}} me. I'm too deep in this thing, and I may {{have to get out of}} it quick. You said you would come with me if I went." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, Sir, that's how {{it ought}} to be; only this here Squire--not being no Passon, though Rector he be--he puts in a gentleman to keep it warm till his son, young Mr. Fulbert, our Vicar as is, was growed up, and hard work {{they say it was}} to get him to bend his mind to it; nor he'd not have done it at last, but for his father's paying of his bills, and giving consent to his marrying Miss Shaw. And since that, bless you, Sir, the curates have done nothing but change, change, change, till 'tis enough to ruin a good clerk. <b>You</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> is, Master Felix, you that be one of the cloth.' (For Felix allowed himself no unprofessional coats.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{not quite}} a regret. I am an old-fashioned person, and I can't change my manners all at once. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> it was <b>that</b> I used to hope." ...|$|R
