500|$|... "The Griffin Family History" [...] {{was written}} by John Viener and was {{directed}} by Zac Moncrief. It guest starred Lori Alan as Diane Simmons and featured Chris Sheridan, Joey Slotnick, Danny Smith and Phil LaMarr as various characters. During the episode's depiction of how the universe was created, God exclaims [...] "ah, <b>you</b> <b>smell</b> that?" [...] after holding a lighter to his butt when performing flatus; this segment of audio was not broadcast on the Fox version of the episode. An additional scene not shown during the televised version was when the Griffins are depicted as dinosaurs. Originally, a Michael Jackson-related scene was {{to be included in}} the episode, but it was re-scheduled for a later episode due to limited time on this episode. In the original draft of the episode, Brian's speech informing Peter of the dangers in the woods during the Nate Griffin story was intended to be longer, including Brian talking about automobile ratings, though it was shortened for unknown reasons. MacFarlane praises the animation sequence showing a horse running around Lois' bedroom, describing it as [...] "a piece of brilliance".|$|E

2500|$|... "I was in {{a temple}} where they killed {{three or four times}} a day. They told us to watch and not to show any emotion at all. They would kill us if we reacted...if we cried, or showed that we cared about the victims. They would kill you right away. So I had to shut it all off...I can shut off {{everything}} in my body, practically, physically. I saw them killing people right in front of me, the blood was there, but I didn't smell it. I made myself numb...The killing was unbearable. You go crazy if <b>you</b> <b>smell</b> the blood." ...|$|E
2500|$|Of a {{study that}} Van Gogh made for Girl in a Wood or Girl in White in the Woods, he remarked at how much he enjoyed the work and {{explains}} how he wishes to trigger the audience's senses and how they may experience the painting: [...] "The other study in the wood is of some large green beech trunks on a stretch of ground covered with dry sticks, and the little figure of a girl in white. There was the great difficulty of keeping it clear, and of getting space between the trunks standing at different distances - and the place and relative bulk of those trunks change with the perspective - {{to make it so}} that one can breathe and walk around in it, and to make <b>you</b> <b>smell</b> the fragrance of the wood." ...|$|E
2500|$|Only Built 4 Cuban Linx… {{was well}} {{received}} by contemporary critics. The Source magazine's Nicholas Poluhoff said [...] "Raekwon has always brought his own special flavor to the Wu cipher: he sprays out lyrics like gunfire, forming vivid tales. What truly sets Cuban Linx apart is the sheer abundance of well-written, complex lyrics." [...] Poluhoff also praised RZA's production, viewing {{it as his}} best yet: [...] "The tracks are suited to the distinct flow of the Chef, who weaves in and out between beats." [...] Cheo H. Choker from Spin magazine found Raekwon to be as vivid a lyricist as Kool G Rap, [...] "so vivid <b>you</b> <b>smell</b> the gunpowder and wipe the blood on your shirt", while crediting RZA for [...] "taking the art form of production to new heights". Los Angeles Times said the songs with other Wu-Tang Clan members {{are as good as}} anything on Enter the 36 Chambers and wrote of the music: [...] "RZA's production sensibilities, sometimes minimal, other times symphonic, pull the listener in despite the chaos. In a genre characterized by singles, Cuban Linx is a full-blown album where the big picture is just as moving as the compositional stylistic elements." [...] In Vibe magazine, dream hampton was impressed by Raekwon and Ghostface Killah's use of cultural appropriation in their lyrics and said they [...] "bring the best in each other." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Shore {{they left}} there!" [...] drawled Blinky.

Wal, I'll shore keep a durn sharp eye on you, an' hobble you too." ...|$|R

5000|$|A {{writer on}} Italian food, Bill Buford, {{describes}} {{talking to an}} old Italian butcher who says: When I was young, there was one kind of prosciutto. It {{was made in the}} winter, by hand, and aged for two years. It was sweet when <b>you</b> <b>smelled</b> it. A profound perfume. Unmistakable. To age a prosciutto is a subtle business. If it's too warm, the aging process never begins. The meat spoils. If it's too dry, the meat is ruined. It needs to be damp but cool. The summer is too hot. In the winter—that's when you make salumi. Your prosciutto. Your soppressata. Your sausages.|$|R
