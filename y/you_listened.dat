500|$|So ... {{what have}} <b>you</b> <b>listened</b> to {{for a good}} time that isn't, after all, a 'traditional' song? Still playing the Mike Oldfield records, huh? Still {{whipping}} Yessongs on for a good time? Wanna count on one hand {{how many people have}} fun at a Sonic Youth gig? I'm not supporting The Choirboys, old man, I'm just saying that the day some jumped-up over-paid self-important post-modernist cocksucker puts his foot upon his Fairlight computer {{in the middle of his}} 47-minute opus [...] "The Silent Forgiveness of the Pig-God" [...] and belts out the chords to [...] "Johnny B. Goode" [...] is the day I'll join you at the footlights of post-modernism.|$|E
500|$|Control {{is widely}} {{considered}} to be the breakthrough in Jackson's career, establishing her independence and dominance in the realm of popular music. In The Sex Revolts: Gender, Rebellion, and Rock'n'roll (1996) author Simon Reynolds wrote that [...] "Janet Jackson became a superstar with the immaculately designed soft-core feminism of Control." [...] Jet magazine commented that although the Jackson family's musical legacy had given her an opportunity to tap into an international audience, Control was the turning point at which [...] "her career took off and she became a bona fide superstar. Control showcased Janet as a person who was firmly and finally in control of her own life." [...] Dennis Hunt of the Los Angeles Times wrote: [...] "Previously, she had recorded two unsophisticated, kiddie soul albums. If <b>you</b> <b>listened</b> carefully to that kid stuff, there was a grown-up singer there somewhere struggling to get out. [...] liberated the real Janet Jackson." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} well {{received}} by television critics. Ology writer Josh Harrison gave the episode a {{nine out of}} ten rating, and opined that the episode was a [...] "home run episode" [...] for the series. Harrison continued: [...] "Its central conflict is intense, its action is solid, and its new arrivals are engaging characters in their own right. Light on the gore and heavy on the drama—just how I like my Sunday night zombie adventures." [...] Scott Meslow from The Atlantic gave the episode a positive review, deeming it as an improvement from the previous episode, and appreciated that the episode had opened up new plot points for future episodes to come. Meslow wrote, [...] "At the bare minimum, The Walking Dead should be exciting, and the final moments of [...] "Bloodletting" [...] provides more than enough action." [...] Echoing similar sentiments, Catherine Gee of The Daily Telegraph gave the episode a 3.5 out of 5 stars, and compared it to the second season premiere, opining: [...] "It may have been a calmer episode but there was no shortage of story to chew on." [...] Joe Oesterle of Mania.com commended the opening sequence of the episode, and praised the performances of Lincoln and Bernthal. Oesterle wrote, [...] "Andrew Lincoln and Jon Bernthal [...] gave a fine bit of acting, and I found it interesting how the character Rick started looking and walking a little bit zombish after giving blood. The scenes between the two men were moving, and if <b>you</b> <b>listened</b> close you could decipher the main differences between these two cowboy cops. Rick is bound and determined to get back to his wife and let her know their son is in mortal danger, without ever doubting his own ability to successfully complete the mission, while Shane on the other hand is not quite as automatically selfless and heroic." [...] In conclusion, Oesterle gave [...] "Bloodletting" [...] a 'B' grade. Eric Goldman of IGN gave the episode an 8.5 out of ten, signaling a [...] "great" [...] response. Goldman stated that it was an improvement over the last episode, and that it had a great scare moment and cliffhanger. Similarly, Paste Josh Jackson gave the episode an 8.3 out of ten rating, signifying a [...] "commendable" [...] rating. Steve West of Cinema Blend expressed that [...] "Bloodletting" [...] was superior to the previous episode, opining that it was [...] "a character strengthening episode." [...] He continued: [...] "Even those throwaway threads are immensely important to what’s about to go down at the Green farm." ...|$|E

5000|$|On Moratorium Day, half {{a million}} demonstrators {{gathered}} across from the White House for a rally where they were led by Pete Seeger in singing John Lennon's new song [...] "Give Peace A Chance" [...] for ten minutes or more. His voice above the crowd, Seeger interspersed phrases like, [...] "Are <b>you</b> <b>listening,</b> Nixon?", [...] "Are <b>you</b> <b>listening,</b> Agnew?", [...] "Are <b>you</b> <b>listening,</b> Pentagon?" [...] between the choruses of protesters singing, [...] "All we are saying ... is give peace a chance".|$|R

Well, it {{happened}} here in the 16th century, the Spaniards conquerors who believed that the devil and its demons inhabited within the volcano, placed a wooden cross close {{the top of the}} crater to fear the spirits and that is why this crater is known by the name “the mouth of hell”.|$|E
2500|$|For the band's second album, Grohl {{recruited}} producer Gil Norton {{to provide}} additional pop polish to the material, demanding to hear guitar overdubs and harmonies with significant clarity. Grohl admired Norton from his work with the Pixies {{and how he was}} able to [...] "distil a coherent pop song out of all their multi-layered weirdness." [...] Norton was very demanding of the band's performance, eventually leading bassist Nate Mendel to enhance his musical formation. Grohl also stated that [...] "it was frustrating and it was hard and it was long, {{but at the end of}} the day <b>you</b> <b>listened</b> back to what you'd done and you understood why you had to do it one million times." ...|$|E
2500|$|On September 10, 2006, Ali was {{endorsed}} by The Washington Post which one county political veteran ranked as only behind that of the Democratic Party for its influence on local voters. The Post said “Political newcomer Saqib Ali has shown good command of issues and would bring new vigor to this district's delegation.” [...] On September Sept. 20, 2006, it was announced Ali had won the Democratic primary in Maryland's 39th Legislative District, defeating incumbent Delegate Joan F. Stern {{for a position on}} the slate with Del's Nancy J. King and Charles E. Barkley for the November general election. Stern had lost the outright endorsement of King and Barkley as she was not seen as a team-player. King noted that [...] "Ali was a 'breath of fresh air' to voters", while political veteran Gene Counihan said [...] "As far as I could see, he followed the book on how to win an election. I saw him on the campaign trail more than anybody. He was out door-to-door; he had impressive literature. He wanted it." [...] Ali ascribed his electoral victory to connecting with voters. [...] "Our campaign had a lot of energy. It had that underdog feel that struck a chord with people and resonated. When you talk to real voters, not the insiders, they care if you pay attention to them. They remember that <b>you</b> <b>listened</b> to them. People appreciate new blood." ...|$|E
