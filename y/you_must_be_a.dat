[...] "Like Newby, I {{was in a}} soulless job, desperate for change and adventure. Reading A Short Walk was a revelation. The superbly crafted, eccentric and evocative story of his Afghan travels was like a call to arms." [...] John Gimlette, in the same list, chooses Newby's Love and War in the Apennines. The Telegraph includes {{it as one of}} its [...] "20 best travel books of all time", describing Newby and Carless's meeting with the explorer Wilfred Thesiger as a [...] "hilarious segment". It quotes [...] "We started to blow up our air-beds. 'God, <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> couple of pansies,' said Thesiger." [...] Outside magazine includes A Short Walk among its [...] "25 essential books for the well-read explorer".|$|E
500|$|Mickiewicz's Konrad Wallenrod (1828), a {{narrative}} poem describing {{battles of the}} Christian order of Teutonic Knights against the pagans of Lithuania, is a thinly veiled allusion to the long feud between Russia and Poland. The plot {{involves the use of}} subterfuge against a stronger enemy, and the poem analyzes moral dilemmas faced by the Polish insurgents who would soon launch the November 1830 Uprising. Controversial to an older generation of readers, Konrad Wallenrod was seen by the young as a call to arms and was praised as such by an Uprising leader, poet [...] Miłosz describes Konrad Wallenrod (named for its protagonist) as [...] "the most committed politically of all Mickiewczi's poems." [...] The point of the poem, though obvious to many, escaped the Russian censors, and the poem was allowed to be published, complete with its telling motto drawn from Machiavelli: [...] "Dovete adunque sapere come sono due generazioni di combattere – bisogna essere volpe e leone." [...] ("Ye shall know that there are two ways of fighting – <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> fox and a lion.") On a purely literary level, the poem was notable for incorporating traditional folk elements alongside stylistic innovations.|$|E
500|$|The Nevermind {{album cover}} shows a naked baby boy, alone {{underwater}} with a US dollar bill on a fishhook {{just out of}} his reach. According to Cobain, he conceived of the idea while watching a television program on water births with Grohl. Cobain mentioned it to Geffen's art director Robert Fisher. Fisher found some stock footage of underwater births but they were too graphic for the record company. Furthermore, the stock house that controlled the photo of a swimming baby that they subsequently settled on wanted $7,500 a year for its use. Instead, Fisher sent a photographer, Kirk Weddle, to a pool for babies to take pictures. Five shots resulted and the band settled on {{the image of a}} four-month-old infant named Spencer Elden, the son of Weddle's friend. However, there was some concern because Elden's [...] penis was visible in the image. Geffen prepared an alternate cover without the penis, as they were afraid that it would offend people, but relented when Cobain {{made it clear that the}} only compromise he would accept was a sticker covering the penis that would say, [...] "If you're offended by this, <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> closet pedophile." ...|$|E

500|$|Minaj {{released}} her second studio album [...] in April 2012. The album {{was preceded by}} the promotional singles [...] "Roman in Moscow" [...] and [...] "Stupid Hoe". Critics suggested that the latter song was directed at Lil' Kim, who said: [...] "If {{you have to make}} a song called 'Stupid Hoe,' <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> stupid hoe." [...] Minaj and rapper M.I.A. joined Madonna to perform their single, [...] "Give Me All Your Luvin'", on the Super Bowl XLVI halftime show on February 6, 2012. She was the first solo female rapper to perform at the Grammy Awards, premiering [...] "Roman Holiday" [...] during the 2012 ceremony on February 12. Her exorcism-themed performance was controversial, with the American Catholic League criticizing Minaj for bringing a fake [...] "Pope" [...] to escort her on the red carpet. The [...] "exorcism" [...] scene that was performed during her appearance was criticized as well. According to the Catholic League president Bill Donohue [...] "Perhaps the most vulgar part was the sexual statement that showed a scantily clad female dancer stretching backwards while an altar boy knelt between her legs in prayer. Finally, 'Come All Ye Faithful' was sung while a man posing as a bishop walked on stage; Minaj was shown levitating." ...|$|E
2500|$|The movie {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} different critics. According to Mario Bautista of Malaya, [...] "...the movie {{based on the}} hit songs of APO, is an endearing musical comedy {{that is the best}} local film we have seen so far this year. If by any chance you don’t get to like it, then <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> grumpy grouchy curmudgeon who does not believe people can just burst into song-and-dance numbers, so you surely won’t enjoy this big sing-along fest...accomplishes what our favorite samples of this genre do. The musical sequences are highly entertaining, uplifting and contagious". He also added that it’s everything a movie-goer would want in a movie and the timeless crowd-pleaser is most certainly highly recommended. He also added that Concepcion is simply sensational while Coleta could be in a Best Supporting Actor award. Cristina Martinez-Belen of Manila Bulletin also gave the film a positive review. She stated, [...] "...i’ve never enjoyed a Filipino movie as much as I enjoyed this(I Do Bidoo Bidoo) which is being dubbed the grand movie-oke of the year...very Filipino in soul and essence. And the performance of the stars is impeccably admirable and superb". One of the print ads for the film shows some of local movie critics’ assessment of the film. They herald “I Do Bidoo Bidoo” as “an endearing musical comedy” that’s [...] "highly entertaining, uplifting, affecting and contagious." [...] Another raved that the music of the APO Hiking Society that’s featured in the film “rocks.” Still another went as {{far as to say that}} it’s the “Best Picture Of The Year.” Ria Limjap of SPOT.ph also gave the film a favorable review stating, [...] "The pamamanhikan scene is brilliant: old fashioned metaphoric speech, initiating an awesome salawikain battle that segues into one of the most charming numbers in the movie (“Salawikain”)." [...] The same goes with the review from Philippine Entertainment Portal (PEP), stating that the movie is a total charmer and its production design is just as excellent, while every backdrop looks meticulously planned. It further added, [...] "Well-choreographed musical numbers help the film feel fresh, and the decision to use songs from the APO Hiking Society hike the nostalgia." [...] He also praises that all casts are perfect for the role. A review from GMA News gave the film a 4/5 rating. The writer, Job B. De Leon states that, [...] "...beyond the music and the actors, it draws strength from its script as it probes the different angles of a teenage pregnancy–how a young couple tries to deal with uncertainty and responsibility, and how parents recover when their darlings color outside the lines of their pre-drawn aspirationsfor all the film's dramatic build-up, there is no climactic moralizing or grand confrontation. Instead the denouement is set to song and highlights to audiences, young and old alike, that together with values like love, friendship and family, the music of APO is forever". The Cinema Evaluation Board, who gave the film the highest rating, [...] "A" [...] states that the film has exceptional performances. Mell Navarro of Independent Cinema Artists of the Philippines commented, [...] "A must-see film! Wonderful! Brilliant!". According to Bong Austero of Manila Standard Today, [...] "...It (I Do Bidoo Bidoo) is in many ways even better than foreign musicals. For one, it features music that has relevance and meaning in our lives. Second, it’s a movie that makes you feel good about being Filipino." [...] He further stated, [...] "...we are told that it is not exactly making the kind of money that Praybeyt Benjamin or No Other Woman made, which is really sad because I Do Bidoo Bidoo is infinitely better than those two other films, which were major blockbusters...if you don’t patronize movies like I Do Bidoo Bidoo, then you should stop complaining about the sorry state of Philippine cinema."Ateneo de Manila University's official publication, The Guidon gave the film 4 stars of 5 and included it at #6 on their [...] "2012 Top Films".|$|E
