500|$|Recording {{engineer}} Geoff Emerick, who {{had worked}} with the group since Revolver in 1966, had become disillusioned with the sessions. At one point, while recording [...] "Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da", Emerick overheard Martin criticising McCartney's lead vocal performance, to which McCartney replied, [...] "Well <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>down</b> and sing it". On 16 July, Emerick announced that he was no longer willing to work with them and left.|$|E
500|$|Questlove was the [...] "musical powerhouse" [...] behind {{several of}} the Soulquarians' {{projects}} during the late 1990s and early 2000s, including Voodoo and Things Fall Apart. In a 2002 interview, he told critic Jim DeRogatis {{about his role in}} recording Voodoo and being a part of the Soulquarians, stating [...] "I tried to do all in my power that I could to bring people together – to bring Common to Electric Lady, have him record here whenever so that he could record with some of these other artists. You'd just come into [...] A Room, you don't even know who has a session, but you call me: 'Who's down there?' 'Common's in there today'. So <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>down,</b> you order some food, sit down and bulls—, watch a movie, and then it's, 'Let's play something'. And I say, 'Who wants this ?' And it would be, 'I want it!' 'No, I want it!'". Questlove has referred to the recording experience at the studio as a [...] "left-of-center black music renaissance".|$|E
500|$|Craig has {{described}} {{his portrayal of}} Bond as an anti-hero: [...] "The question I keep asking myself while playing the role is, 'Am I the good guy or just a bad guy {{who works for the}} good side?' Bond's role, after all, is that of an assassin when <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>down</b> to it. I have never played a role in which someone's dark side shouldn't be explored. I don't think it should be confusing {{by the end of the}} film, but during the film you should be questioning who he is." [...] Craig has stated that his own favourite previous Bond actor is Sean Connery, but says, [...] "I'd never copy somebody else. I would never do an impression of anybody else or try and improve on what they did. That would be a pointless exercise for me." [...] His own favourite Bond film is From Russia with Love. On an episode of The South Bank Show, Connery divulged his thoughts on Craig's casting as Bond, whom he described as [...] "fantastic, marvellous in the part". When told that Craig had taken particular note of his performances, Connery said that he was [...] "flattered" [...] and that Craig really gets the [...] "danger element" [...] to Bond's character. Craig has remarked that Bond is [...] "...actually a misogynist... A lot of women are drawn to him chiefly because he embodies a certain kind of danger and never sticks around for too long." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Food growing is {{the first}} thing you do when <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>down</b> out of the trees. The {{question}} is, how come the United States can grow food and you can't?"– speaking to Third World countries about global famine ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sir Claude Champion's place--haven't <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>down</b> for that, too?" [...] {{asked the}} other pressman, looking up. [...] "You're a journalist, aren't you?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "True, Tommy, that's {{only right}} an' fair. But I ain't used to lookin' up when discoorsin'. Couldn't <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>down</b> here an' lay alongside?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And when <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>down</b> to-morrow night, don't call out! Let {{me ask you}} {{a parting}} question. What made you cry, 'Halloa! Below there!' to-night?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Could <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>down</b> in a month's time?' he continued. 'Lance {{is to be}} {{confirmed}} at the Cathedral, {{and it might be}} an opportunity for you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And did {{you have}} all that in your mind, papa, when <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>down</b> here, and was that what you and Mr. Dawson wanted to talk about?" [...] said the {{astonished}} Rose.|$|R

6000|$|... "Nothing." [...] He hastened {{again to}} change the current. [...] "We were in hot argument. <b>You</b> <b>came</b> <b>down</b> as peace-maker. I went away cravenly, most impotently, leaving you there like a captive." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is I, Herbert Wrayson," [...] he answered. [...] "Don't be afraid. Shall I {{come out}} to you, or will <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>down</b> the laurel path?" ...|$|E
