[...] The game maintains an 83.3% average rating on GameRankings, pooling reviews from 14 separate online sources.|$|E
500|$|In 2006, supervising {{animator}} on {{the film}} Scott Clark, spoke about the challenges of animating car characters, saying: [...] "Getting {{a full range of}} performance and emotion from these characters and making them still seem like cars was a tough assignment, but that's what animation does best. <b>You</b> <b>use</b> <b>your</b> imagination, and you make the movements and gestures fit with the design. Our car characters may not have arms and legs, but we can lean the tires in or out to suggest hands opening up or closing in. We can use steering to point a certain direction. We also designed a special eyelid and an eyebrow for the windshield that lets us communicate an expressiveness that cars don't have." [...] Doug Sweetland, who also served as supervising animator, also spoke about the challenges, saying: [...] "It took a different kind of animator to really be able to interpret the Cars models, than it did to interpret something like The Incredibles models. With The Incredibles, the animator could get reference for the characters by shooting himself and watching the footage. But with Cars, it departs completely from any reference. Yes they're cars, but no car can do what our characters do. It's pure fantasy. It took a lot of trial and error to get them to look right." ...|$|E

2500|$|In chess, a desperado {{piece is}} a piece that is en prise or trapped, but captures an enemy piece before it is itself captured. This can be in either a {{situation}} where both sides have hanging pieces, [...] "...in which <b>you</b> <b>use</b> <b>your</b> doomed piece to eat as much material as possible before it dies"; or alternatively a sacrifice which will result in stalemate if it is captured.|$|E
2500|$|In 1655 Monck {{received}} a letter from the future Charles II, a copy of which he at once sent to the Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell, who is said to have written to Monck in 1657: [...] "There be [...] that tell me that there is a certain cunning fellow in Scotland called George Monck, who is said to lye in wait there to introduce Charles Stuart; I pray <b>you,</b> <b>use</b> <b>your</b> diligence to apprehend him, and send him up to me." [...] Monck's personal relations with Cromwell were those of sincere friendship on both sides.|$|E
2500|$|Reception of iOS 6 was positive. Critics {{noted that}} the {{operating}} system did not offer any significant speed improvements or major redesigned elements, but instead focused on refinements, with a general consensus that Apple [...] "isn't overhauling things {{for the sake of}} it". iOS 6 didn't [...] "completely change the way <b>you</b> <b>use</b> <b>your</b> device", but [...] "each of the tweaks [...] will make many daily smartphone actions easier across the board", and critics noted that refinement of [...] "something that already works extremely well" [...] is [...] "something other companies would do well to emulate".|$|E
5000|$|The single {{was officially}} {{credited}} to the Vengaboys ft. Cheekah, {{referring to the}} animated computer in the music video, which performs the lyrics (all of which are related to computer terminology, but initially feature some tongue-in-cheek sexual innuendo: e.g. [...] "The way <b>you</b> <b>used</b> <b>your</b> joystick / Has really made my mouse click". However, {{in the second part}} of the song, the lyrics portray sexually transmitted diseases once again using computer terminology e.g. [...] "The way <b>you</b> <b>used</b> <b>your</b> joystick / Has really made me feel sick" [...] and [...] "The doctor checked my hard drive / A virus in my archive / My disc was not protected / and now I am infected").|$|R

2500|$|The {{reception}} of iOS 6 was positive. Dan Seifert of The Verge wrote that [...] "iOS 6 looks {{nearly identical to}} iOS 5. There are a few subtle tweaks here and there [...] But for every small change to the look of iOS details, there are ten things that remain the same." [...] While praising the iPhone 4S for being a [...] "snappy performer", he noted that [...] "When it comes to speed, iOS 6 doesn't feel terribly different from iOS 5". Craig Grannell of TechRadar wrote that [...] "iOS 6 is rather like the iPhone 5 or OS X Mountain Lion - the refinement of something that already works extremely well. Apple isn't overhauling things {{for the sake of}} it but, in the main, making the iOS experience gradually better. That in itself is something other companies would do well to emulate." [...] Jason Parker of CNET wrote that [...] "iOS 6 is a welcome upgrade for any iOS user, but it's not going to completely change the way <b>you</b> <b>use</b> <b>your</b> device. Instead, each of the tweaks here will make many daily smartphone actions easier across the board and offer some relief to those waiting for certain features (sending images from e-mail and call controls, for example)." ...|$|E
