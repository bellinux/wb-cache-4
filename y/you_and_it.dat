By this stage, the group had integrated new instrumentation and technologies into its sound, including Mays' addition of midi-controlled synthesized sounds to acoustic piano solos, accomplished via a pedal control.|$|E

Everything has to feel in place. It fulfills <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> makes you feel good. That's how I felt about 'Billie Jean'. I {{knew it was going to}} be big when I was writing it." [...] The singer explained that he was so absorbed by the song that, in one instance, he did not notice that his car had caught fire as he drove down a freeway with a friend until a passing motorcyclist informed him. Jackson noted: [...] "The kid probably saved our lives." ...|$|E

[...] "....It was petrifying, but it put a stop to fantasies of being able to do anything. The oddest thing about this job is the sense of superiority you get. It was a huge wake-up call. I was completely out of it for two weeks, and in hospital for six.

She commented, saying: [...] "I was raised around him, I always saw him [...] had holidays with him and stuff like that", adding that she was unaware of his fame until she was 13 years old. Ferreira expressed interest in singing as a child and, with Jackson's encouragement, Ferreira's grandmother enrolled her in opera lessons. Ferreira has stated that she was sexually assaulted in her adolescence twice, firstly involving a neighbor, and secondly in an incident that involved a stranger who had broken into her home. In an interview with Rookie, Ferreira said: [...] "I've never said anything [...] because I don't want it to define me, but I feel like it's appropriate to say something [...] People feel like it defines <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> doesn't. It's really unfortunate and disgusting and traumatizing, but it doesn't make you who you are." [...] Ferreira {{dropped out of high}} school after completing her sophomore year.|$|E

Paul Neurath later said that the game [...] "was not a flop", but that it ultimately [...] "lost money" [...] for the company, which he attributed to its steep learning curve. Computer Gaming World praised the game's scale, physics system, and true 3D environments; the magazine extolled the presentation of Cyberspace as [...] "nothing short of phenomenal". However, the reviewer {{believed that the}} game had [...] "little sense of urgency" [...] and [...] "confusing level layouts".

500|$|... "Sun of a Gun" [...] is a synth-pop and Europop {{song that}} lasts three minutes and twenty-five seconds. It is {{composed}} {{in the key}} of E minor using common time with a tempo of 133 beats per minute. It was written by Jimmy Harry and Nanna Øland Fabricius, while Dave McCracken served as the song's executive producer. The song was written while Oh Land was in Los Angeles. Lyrically, the song depicts a relationship by comparing it to the earth's orbit. In an interview with MTV News, Oh Land described its lyrics: [...] "It's a love story about being {{in a relationship with}} a person who's kind of destructive, but you keep coming back because you can't let it go". She further confirmed [...] "that it was also a metaphor for how we orbit around the sun". The singer ended with: [...] "The sun is a really beautiful thing: a sunset, a sunrise is spectacular. But it's also something we need to protect ourselves against, because it can burn <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> can be dangerous." ...|$|E

2500|$|The idea to base {{the album}} around the {{folklore}} {{concept of the}} seventh son of a seventh son came to bassist Steve Harris after he read Orson Scott Card's Seventh Son. Harris states, [...] "It was our seventh studio album and I didn't have a title for it or any ideas at all. Then I read {{the story of the}} seventh son, this mystical figure that was supposed to have all these paranormal gifts, like second sight and what have <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> was more, at first, that it was just a good title for the seventh album, you know?

2500|$|GLaDOS' mocking of Chell was {{met with}} {{negative}} reception from Neal Stapel, an adoptive parent profiled by 1UP.com.

He added that [...] "it throws the ultimate question that that child {{is ever going to}} have for <b>you...</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> just throws it right in the living room." [...] Kotaku's Michael McWhertor felt that while it was [...] "awkward" [...] for the parents, the fact that GLaDOS was trying to kill Chell would be more upsetting. He also pointed out that [...] "morons and the overweight are also mocked by robots" [...] in Portal 2. 1UP.com's Chris Pereira found the joke [...] "harmless".|$|E
2500|$|Before {{the release}} of their debut album, the band {{recorded}} two demos in 1999 and 2000. In mid-2001, {{it was reported that}} Meacham had attempted suicide by drinking excessive amounts of cough syrup. The attempt affected the band's Take Action Tour. During his hospitalization he remained in poor condition and was replaced by Dameon Ash. In an interview, lead singer M. Shadows said of Meacham that [...] "he perma-fried his brain and was in a mental institution for a long time, and when you have someone in your band who does that, it ruins everything that's going on all around <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> makes {{you want to do something}} to prevent it from happening to other people." [...] Avenged Sevenfold's debut album, Sounding the Seventh Trumpet, was recorded when the band members were in their late teens and still in high school. It was originally released on their first label, Good Life Recordings in 2001. When lead guitarist Synyster Gates joined the band after the album was released, the introductory track [...] "To End the Rapture" [...] was re-recorded featuring a full band element. The album was subsequently re-released on Hopeless Records in 2002. The band started to receive recognition, performing with bands such as Mushroomhead and Shadows Fall and playing on the Take Action Tour.|$|E
