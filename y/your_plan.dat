25|$|The {{cost of an}} ACL {{reconstruction}} surgery {{will vary}} due to a few different reasons such as where you live, which graft is used, if the meniscus is also torn, and the coverage of your insurance. A study has shown in 2016 that metropolitan areas, {{of at least one}} million residents, located on the western coast of the United States of America and areas like Minnesota, Indiana, and Michigan were more expensive that the East and South East coast of the United States. Another study, conducted by Baylor University, found that ACL reconstruction procedures using the bone-patella tendon-bone technique took 2.5 hours longer than using a hamstring graft. The operation room costs and hospital charges for that amount of extra time came to about $1,580 more expensive. This also applies to having a torn meniscus during the procedure. Fixing the torn cartilage will increase the procedure time, increasing cost. Insurance plays the biggest roll in cost for an ACL reconstruction since that it will be covering majority of the costs. The coverage of <b>your</b> <b>plan,</b> deductibles, and insurance company will determine how much the patient will pay in copay's.|$|E
500|$|He {{served in}} New York during the American War of Independence. While William was in America, George Washington {{approved}} {{a plot to}} kidnap him, writing: [...] "The spirit of enterprise so conspicuous in <b>your</b> <b>plan</b> for surprising in their quarters and bringing off the Prince William Henry and Admiral Digby merits applause; and you have my authority to make the attempt in any manner, and at such a time, as your judgment may direct. I am fully persuaded, that it is unnecessary to caution you against offering insult or indignity to the persons of the Prince or Admiral..." [...] The plot {{did not come to}} fruition; the British heard of it and assigned guards to William, who had up till then walked around New York unescorted.|$|E
500|$|It {{was assumed}} by many that Steinbeck had kept a journal {{during the trip}} and that the book was merely an {{amalgamation}} of his log and Ricketts' taxonomic list; but the two authors revealed that the journal was Ricketts'. Although Steinbeck had added to it during the journey, he had done the real work of editing it after they returned. The log was based on what Ricketts called the Verbatim Transcript, {{an account of the}} trip he had compiled from the various notes he kept during the trip. Much of the final narrative was little changed from Ricketts' notes; Steinbeck shifted from the first person singular to the first person plural and gave some of Ricketts' drier prose a poetic twist, but many of the scenes remained almost unchanged from the daily journal. The suggestion by Steinbeck's editor, Pascal Covici, that the title page should state that Steinbeck was the author and add that the appendices were by Ricketts met with blunt opposition from Steinbeck: [...] "I not only disapprove of <b>your</b> <b>plan</b> — I forbid it". Steinbeck also drew upon the journal of Tony Berry, mostly to confirm dates and times.|$|E

2500|$|Mr. President, {{my mother}} and sister {{traveled}} abroad this summer and, when they got back, they talked to us about how shocked {{they were at the}} intensity of aggravation that other countries had with how we handled the Iraq situation.

2500|$|Burnside, at Halleck's request, {{submitted}} {{a plan to}} create a ruse at Culpeper and Gordonsville, while the brunt of his force took Fredericksburg, {{then moved on to}} Richmond. Halleck's response was sent on November 14: [...] "The President has just assented to <b>your</b> <b>plan.</b> He thinks that it will succeed, if you move rapidly; otherwise not." [...] The following Battle of Fredericksburg was a disaster, and the Army of the Potomac was handily defeated.|$|E
2500|$|Part of {{what you}} have said and Senator Kerry has said {{that you are going to}} do in order to get us out of the {{problems}} in Iraq is to internationalize the effort. Yet French and German officials have both said they have no intention even if John Kerry is elected of sending any troops into Iraq for any peacekeeping effort. Does that make your effort or <b>your</b> <b>plan</b> to internationalize this effort seem kind of naïve? ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{narrative}} depicts Zhao Ang and Wang Yi's son, Zhao Yue, as a Major-General (裨將) in Ma Chao's army. After Wei Kang {{was killed}} by Ma Chao, Zhao Ang wanted to avenge his superior, but he hesitated because his son was with Ma, so he consulted his wife. Lady Wang's response to her husband {{was similar to the}} one documented in the Lie Nü Zhuan, but the last sentence about Xiang Tuo and Yan Hui had been changed to [...] "If you do not carry out <b>your</b> <b>plan</b> because of our son, I'll die first." [...] Ma Chao was so enraged that he killed Zhao Yue and sought revenge for his losses by massacring several civilians in the area. Lady Wang survived because she was with her husband all that while.|$|E

2500|$|Ji Miao led the Ji family's {{retainers}} {{and other}} supporters, numbering about 1,000 people, to attack Wang Bi's camp {{at night and}} {{set fire to the}} gate. Jin Yi was very trusted by Wang Bi, so he used the opportunity to plant spies in Wang's camp before the revolt started. Wang Bi was injured in the arm by an arrow during the attack. As he was unaware of the true identities of the rebels, he escaped from the camp and sought shelter in Jin Yi's house, not knowing that Jin was actually one of the conspirators. Jin Yi's servants did not recognise Wang Bi and thought that he was Ji Miao, so they replied, [...] "Is Chief Clerk Wang dead? <b>Your</b> <b>plan</b> has succeeded!" [...] Wang Bi then left and headed to the south of Xu. With assistance from Yan Kuang (嚴匡), an Agriculture General of the Household (典農中郎將), Wang Bi succeeded in suppressing the revolt when he led troops back to his camp to attack the rebels and defeated them. Ji Ben and the conspirators were all captured and executed for treason. Wang Bi died from his wounds several days later.|$|E
2500|$|In 189, {{after the}} warlord Dong Zhuo {{seized control of}} the Han central {{government}} and held the figurehead Emperor Xian hostage, Zhang Cheng wanted to gather like-minded people to rise up against Dong Zhuo's tyranny and overthrow him. At the time, Zhang Zhao (張昭), another younger brother of Zhang Fan and Zhang Cheng, was also serving as a Consultant (議郎) under the Han government. Zhang Zhao came from Chang'an to meet Zhang Cheng and tell him, [...] "We can't defeat Dong Zhuo now because we aren't as powerful as him. Besides, it'll take {{time for us to}} set <b>your</b> <b>plan</b> into motion. We'll need to draft civilians into military service, train them to be soldiers, gain support from the political elites, and so on. It's impossible to achieve all these at the moment. Dong Zhuo won't last long because he lacks legitimacy and relies solely on military power. Why don't we find someone to take shelter under, pledge allegiance to him, and wait for an opportunity to take action, and fulfil our ambitions." [...] Zhang Cheng agreed with his brother. He then resigned from government service, returned home, gathered his family members and moved to Yang Province.|$|E
