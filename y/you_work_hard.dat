A lot of times producers or songwriters leak records because they feel {{if you put the}} song out there it would go [...] Usually a leak that far in advance of an album release puts the song in serious jeopardy of being excluded from the final track list. It was frustrating. I felt like <b>you</b> <b>work</b> <b>hard</b> to get in the studio to work with Beyoncé. [...] I was blessed... that song turned out [...] have nine lives.|$|E
500|$|During a {{performance}} on November 21, 2013, Kanye West gave his opinion regarding the MTV Video Music Awards, that were held on August 25, 2013. West said, [...] "Bruno Mars won all the motherfucking awards and shit". He continued, [...] "What I {{care about is}} if you’re an artist and <b>you</b> <b>work</b> <b>hard</b> as fuck and the streets say that you deserve that shit. Then can’t no motherfucking networks try to gas everybody up so they can sell some product with the prettiest motherfucker out". Nevertheless, on February 26, 2015, he publicly apologized to Bruno Mars on Twitter while asking him to sing a hook on a song that he co-produced. West asked Tyler, the Creator to direct the music video. Mars confirmed that West called him and apologized.|$|E
500|$|On {{the first}} night of the 2008 Democratic National Convention, Craig Robinson {{introduced}} his younger sister. She delivered her speech, during which she sought to portray herself and her family as the embodiment of the American Dream. Obama said she and her husband believe [...] "that <b>you</b> <b>work</b> <b>hard</b> for what you want in life, that your word is your bond, and you do what you say you're going to do, that you treat people with dignity and respect, even if you don't know them, and even if you don't agree with them." [...] She also emphasized loving her country, in response to criticism for her previous statements about feeling proud of her country for the first time, where the original statement was seen as a gaffe. That keynote address was largely well-received and drew mostly positive reviews. A Rasmussen Reports poll found that her favorability among Americans reached 55%.|$|E

500|$|At {{secondary}} sites {{he would}} remove and later burn the victim's clothing, or {{in at least}} one case (Cunningham's) deposit them in a Goodwill Industries collection bin. Bundy explained that the clothing removal was ritualistic, but also a practical matter, as it minimized the chance of leaving trace evidence at the crime scene that could implicate him. (A manufacturing error in fibers from his own clothing, ironically, provided a crucial incriminating link to Kimberly Leach.) He often revisited his secondary crime scenes to engage in acts of necrophilia, and to groom or dress up the cadavers. Some victims were found wearing articles of clothing they had never worn, or nail polish that family members had never seen. He took Polaroid photos of many of his victims. [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>work</b> <b>hard</b> to do something right," [...] he told Hagmaier, [...] "you don't want to forget it." [...] Consumption of large quantities of alcohol was an [...] "essential component", he told Keppel, and later Michaud; he needed to be [...] "extremely drunk" [...] while on the prowl in order to [...] "significantly diminish" [...] his inhibitions and to [...] "sedate" [...] the [...] "dominant personality" [...] that he feared might prevent his inner [...] "entity" [...] from acting on his impulses.|$|E
500|$|... "Hypnotico" [...] {{was written}} by RedOne, Lady Gaga, Aliaune [...] "Akon" [...] Thiam, Claude Kelly and Tami Chynn. In 2007, Gaga and Kelly were working with RedOne in a small {{recording}} studio in Queens, New York. Gaga was writing [...] "what would later become" [...] her debut studio album The Fame (2008) and Kelly was writing songs with RedOne to pitch to other artists. Kelly recalled the events by saying: [...] "We were all friends and often rode the train together {{to get to the}} studio". RedOne began working with Akon, who had signed Chynn to his record label. Akon and RedOne flew Gaga and Kelly to Los Angeles to write songs for Chynn's second studio album Prima Donna. [...] "Hypnotico" [...] became the first of several songs they had written together. From that trip, according to Kelly, [...] "Akon met, signed and helped launch Lady Gaga's career". Kelly credits the trip as also helping to launch his own songwriting career. He states that he and Akon became good friends and writing partners. Akon gave Kelly a CD of working tracks as a basis for composition. From that CD of tracks he wrote songs for Leona Lewis ("Forgive Me"), Whitney Houston ("Like I Never Left", [...] "I Got You") and Michael Jackson ("Hold My Hand"). According to Kelly, [...] "Hypnotico" [...] is a [...] "symbol of how dreams come true if <b>you</b> <b>work</b> <b>hard,</b> and a constant reminder of how far I've come. I'm still extremely grateful for all that I've achieved".|$|E
