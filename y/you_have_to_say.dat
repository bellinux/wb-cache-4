From this, Mr. Jacobovici deduced that they were a couple, because otherwise they would not have been buried together in a family tomb. In an interview, Mr. Jacobovici was asked why the filmmakers did not conduct DNA testing on the other ossuaries to determine whether the one inscribed Judah, son of Jesus was genetically related to either the Jesus or Mary Magdalene boxes; or whether the Jesus remains were actually the offspring of Mary.

2500|$|After {{the death}} of Abu Bakr, Ali raised Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr. The Twelver Shia view Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr {{as one of the}} companions of Ali. When Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr was killed by the Ummayads, Aisha, the wife of Muhammad and also a renowned scholar of her time, raised and taught her nephew Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr. Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr's mother was from Ali's family and Qasim's {{daughter}} Farwah bint al-Qasim was married to Muhammad al-Baqir and was the mother of Jafar al-Sadiq. Therefore, Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr was the grand son of Abu Bakr the first caliph and the grand father of Jafar al-Sadiq. Jafar al-Sadiq disapproved of people who said anything bad about his great grand father Abu Bakr the first caliph. Zaydis, the largest group amongst the Shia before the Safavid Dynasty and currently the second largest group (although its population is only about 5% of all Shia Muslims), believe that on the last hour of Zayd ibn Ali (the uncle of Jafar al-Sadiq), he was betrayed by the people in Kufa who said to him: [...] "May God have mercy on you! What do <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> on the matter of Abu Bakr and Umar ibn al-Khattab?"

2500|$|Gonzales, who is {{considered}} to be among the greatest tennis players of all time, always maintained that Hoad was the toughest, most skilful adversary that he had ever faced. [...] "He was the only guy who, if I was playing my best tennis, could still beat me." [...] said Gonzales in a 1995 New York Times interview. [...] "I think his game was the best game ever. Better than mine. He was capable of making more shots than anybody. His two volleys were great. His overhead was enormous. He had the most natural tennis mind with the most natural tennis physique." [...] In a 1970 interview he stated that [...] "Hoad was probably the best and toughest player when he wanted to be. After the first two years on the tour, his back injury plagued him so much that he lost the desire to practice. He was the only man to beat me in a head-to-head tour, 15 to 13." [...] Kramer, however, had mixed feelings about Hoad's ability. In spite of calling him one of the 21 best players of all time, he also writes that [...] "when you sum Hoad up, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that he was overrated. He might have been the best, but day-to-day, week-to-week, he was the most inconsistent of all the top players." [...] In a 1963 article in World Tennis Rosewall judges Gonzales to be a notch above Hoad but stated that [...] "...the latter is the greatest of all time when he is 'on'.", an opinion echoed by Frew McMillan.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the death}} of Umar Ibn Adbul Aziz the {{scholars}} in Madina got very upset. But {{in the short time}} Umar Ibn Adbul Aziz was in power the changes he made, had a long-lasting effect {{in the minds of the}} people. An associate of Umar Ibn Adbul Aziz, Zayd ibn Ali the grandson of Husayns was also very upset. Zayd ibn Ali then started receiving letters from Kufa asking him to come to Kufa. In 740, Abu Hanifah supported his friend Zayd ibn Ali against an Umayyad ruler but asked his friend not to go to Kufa. Abu Hanifah, Malik ibn Anas and Zayd ibn Ali's family advised Zayd ibn Ali not to go to Kufa feared that Zayd ibn Ali would get betrayed in Kufa. But Zayd ibn Ali felt that he needed to oppose the Umayyads by force. Zaydis believe that on his arrival in Kufa, on the last hour of Zayd ibn Ali, the people in Kufa asked him: [...] "May God have mercy on you! What do <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> on the matter of Abu Bakr and Umar ibn al-Khattab?" [...] Zayd ibn Ali said, [...] "I have not heard anyone in my family renouncing them both nor saying anything but good about them...when they were entrusted with government they behaved justly with the people and acted according to the Qur'an and the Sunnah.". After which they withdrew their support and Zayd ibn Ali fought bravely against the Umayyad army but was killed. The Scholars kept up the pressure on the Umayyads and as the Umayyads tried to re-impose the taxes abolished by Umar Ibn Adbul Aziz, the population also got more rebellious.|$|E

2500|$|Some lesbian feminists such as Julie Bindel {{are still}} {{critical}} of bisexuality. Bindel has described female bisexuality as a [...] "fashionable trend" [...] being promoted due to [...] "sexual hedonism" [...] and broached {{the question of}} whether bisexuality even exists. She has also made tongue-in-cheek comparisons of bisexuals to cat fanciers and devil worshippers. Lesbian feminists initially faced discrimination in the National Organization for Women. Heterosexual feminists such as Betty Friedan downplayed lesbian issues as not being central to feminist activism. She later admitted that [...] "the whole idea of homosexuality made me profoundly uneasy" [...] and acknowledged that she had been very square and was uncomfortable about lesbianism.

[...] She ignored lesbians in the National Organization for Women (NOW) initially but objected to what she saw as demands for equal time. [...] "'Homosexuality ... is not, in my opinion, what the women's movement is all about.'" [...] While opposing all repression, she wrote, she refused to wear a purple armband or self-identify as a lesbian (although heterosexual) as an act of political solidarity, considering it not part of the mainstream issues of abortion and child care. In 1977, at the National Women's Conference, she seconded a lesbian rights resolution [...] "which everyone thought I would oppose" [...] in order to [...] "preempt any debate" [...] and move on to other issues she believed were more important and less divisive in the effort to add the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) to the U.S. Constitution.|$|E
