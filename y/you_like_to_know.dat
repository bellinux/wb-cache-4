6000|$|... "Chug-a-rum!" [...] said he. [...] "Paddy the Beaver {{has one of}} {{the most}} useful tails I know of. Would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> how he comes by such a queer tail?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My name is Plumer," [...] {{said the}} highway guest, in harsh and {{aggressive}} tones. [...] "If you're like me, <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> {{the name of}} the party you're dining with." ...|$|E
60|$|CAPT. G. Hab! Would <b>you</b> really <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know?</b> They aren't pretty things.|$|R
60|$|MAUD. [Proudly] All right! We thought <b>you</b> might <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that Athene's married, {{and that}} I've {{given up the}} movies. Now we'll go.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, sir," [...] said Waldron. [...] "You see the Loch Fine {{herrings}} {{are very}} famous, {{and we thought}} <b>you</b> would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> how they taste." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How dear!" [...] {{said the}} girl, leaning forward {{to fix the}} nonagenarian with her glasses, while many other glasses converged upon her. [...] "Oh, wouldn't <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> him, Mr. March?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Eden," [...] she said, {{her words}} coming rapidly, with passion, from her lips, [...] "do you wish {{me to say}} more than I have said? Would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what I think of you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'So I {{perceive}}--as I also {{perceive that}} you must have shut your eyes very tight. Should <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> {{a few of the}} reasons--heaven forbid I should attempt to go over them all; there are millions!--why his hands are tied?' ...|$|E
60|$|But perhaps <b>you</b> may <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what {{happened}} afterward, {{for no one}} cares to leave the thread of a story without tying a knot in it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish I hadn't--if <b>you</b> don't <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> it, miss. But you needn't mind. Lord--hee, hee!--I shall {{keep him}} waiting many a year yet, bless ye!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, that's about all. I thought <b>you</b> would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> {{what they}} were doing,--particularly Mr. Kenneby. I do hear that they mean to be uncommonly hard upon him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{may believe}} me or not, as you like--I {{know of a}} man who is in love with her. He has had his opportunities; and he has made good use of them. Would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> who he is?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{just the}} same way," [...] he explained, [...] "that I am sending her this message at the present moment--a message which she will receive and {{understand}} wherever she is hidden. Would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what I am telling her?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Everything {{has been}} unlucky, Mr. Fregelius--or lucky," [...] he added beneath his breath. [...] "But <b>you</b> will <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that she died singing it. The aerophone told me that." ...|$|R

50|$|This section {{addresses}} {{matters of}} comfort care—what type of pain management <b>you</b> would <b>like,</b> personal grooming and bathing instructions, and whether <b>you</b> would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> about options for hospice care, among others.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, indeed," [...] said he. [...] "Their loving old hearts {{have never}} {{recovered}} from the blow. Would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> their history? It is a sad story, and pitiful; but I am sure you would understand and appreciate my old friends better after hearing it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What did I fetch you, hey?" [...] cried Jean, in delight, as he {{took the}} lad up on his knee. [...] "Wouldn't <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know?</b> I didn't forget, Lee. I remembered you all. Oh! the job I had packin' your bundle of presents.... Now, Lee, make a guess." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, of course," [...] {{said the}} girl. After a {{constraint}} which she marked by rather a long silence, she added, [...] "How strange {{a roomful of}} talking sounds, doesn't it? Just like a great caldron boiling up and bubbling over. Wouldn't <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what they're all saying?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I guess you'll pay for this, Captain Marvin," [...] said McGinty. [...] "Who are <b>you,</b> I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know,</b> <b>to</b> {{break into}} a house in this fashion and molest honest, law-abiding men?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Herbert thought <b>you</b> would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> {{as soon as}} {{possible}} how things were going," [...] Muriel said, as she took a big envelope from a drawer and gave it to him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Never mind, now. I {{know there}} are many things <b>you</b> would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know,</b> and which, perhaps, I ought to explain; but for the present you will have to let that pass." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Take {{them to your}} west-end, then!" [...] Ellen cried, scornfully. [...] "Take them {{riding in}} your motor-car. Why don't you tell the man to drive {{up and down the}} avenue, that every one may see how fine you are! Would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> just what I think of you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Should <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> {{that his}} own life is too base for words and that his impudence in talking about me would be sickening if it weren't grotesque?' Selina went on, with {{increasing}} emotion. 'Should {{you like me to}} tell you to what he has stooped--to the very gutter--and the charming history of his relations with----' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Three {{hours after}} noon. My task is finished, my report--which {{is to the}} effect that the Essenes are a most worthy and {{harmless}} people who deserve to be encouraged, not molested--is written. Also I am called hence in haste by a messenger who reached me from Jerusalem an hour ago. Would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> why?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am very sorry, madame," [...] Aline replied. [...] "I {{hesitated for}} some time, but I thought <b>you</b> would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that the gentleman was here. It is Mr. Stephen Strangewey--Mr. John's brother." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have come}} to see you, Sir Gilbert," [...] she said, because I thought <b>you</b> would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> something--of what I am going to do! you and--your cousin were great friends, were you not?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If you are {{interested}} in shop-girls, Miss President and ladies, <b>you</b> will <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that I am one, at least a silent partner and co-worker in a small fancy store at the West End." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't want it explained," [...] Spencer said, [...] "even if {{it would}} do any good--which it wouldn't! I should have retired in any case {{in less than a}} year, and, as it is, I believe my {{successor}} is on his way over already. Now would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> why I have come here at this hour of the night to tell you this?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Will we?' said George, unpleasantly. 'Would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what I'm {{going to}} do to you, then? I'm going to hit you very hard under the jaw, and I'm going to take hold of your neck and squeeze it till you lose consciousness, and then I'm going to drag you to the beach and tell people I had to hit you because you lost your head and struggled.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, well," [...] said Maggie, rather foiled by Luke's {{unexpectedly}} decided {{views about}} Dutchmen, [...] "perhaps {{you would like}} 'Animated Nature' better; that's not Dutchmen, you know, but elephants and kangaroos, and the civet-cat, and the sunfish, and a bird sitting on its tail,--I forget its name. There are countries full of those creatures, instead of horses and cows, you know. Shouldn't <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> about them, Luke?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Farebrother {{has just}} sent up {{a message to}} say that he wants to speak to me. He is below. I thought <b>you</b> might <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> he was there, if you had {{anything}} to say to him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I went {{to leave}} some roses for him," [...] Lucille answered. [...] "And if <b>you</b> would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> it, I {{will tell you}} this. I left my card tied to them with a message for him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By the way," [...] he said, [...] "perhaps <b>you</b> would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that <b>you</b> {{have had}} royalty for a coachman. Old Cæsar's {{grandfather}} was a king in Congo. Cæsar himself has royal ways, {{as you may have}} observed." ...|$|R
