5|$|One major {{manifestation of}} the North–South divide is in health and life {{expectancy}} statistics. All three Northern England statistical regions have lower than average life expectancies and higher than average rates of cancer, circulatory disease and respiratory disease. Blackpool has the lowest life expectancy at birth in England – male life expectancy at birth between 2012 and 2014 was 74.7, against an England-wide average of 79.5 – {{and the majority of}} English districts in the bottom 50 were in the North East or the North West. However, regional differences do seem to be slowly narrowing: between 1991–1993 and 2012–2014, life expectancy in the North East increased by 6.0 years and in the North West by 5.8 years, the fastest increase in any region outside London, and the gap between life expectancy in the North East and South East is now 2.5 <b>years,</b> <b>down</b> from 2.9 in 1993.|$|E

25|$|After {{some time}} {{the reason for}} the {{presence}} of voluntary police officers had changed. No longer were these men and women called into service only for emergencies. More and more they became part of the regular teams of police officers and started doing all sorts of regular police tasks. As of 1994, along with the first great reform of the Dutch police, police volunteers were fully integrated into the 25 regional police forces. Between 1994 and 2010, new voluntary police officers were no longer equipped with a pistol. Those who started before 1994 were allowed to keep their pistol, as long as they kept up training. Since 2005, all voluntary police officers are equipped with pepper spray. As of today, voluntary police officers are again equipped with a pistol, after having acquired a full police diploma, successfully completed several years of field-experience as an unarmed officer, and completed an additional police safety training. In 2012 the initial training program for new voluntary police officers was changed, reducing the training from three <b>years</b> <b>down</b> to one year. Dutch voluntary police officers hold the same police powers and wear the same uniform as their professional counterparts.|$|E

And, fifty <b>years</b> <b>down</b> the line, isn't that all we really expect from a Bond product these days?" [...] Yahoo!'s Rob O'Connor gave the standalone song a positive review, but {{felt that it was}} too soon to tell how the song would fit into the wider canon of Bond theme songs.
