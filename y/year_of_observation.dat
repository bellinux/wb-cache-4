50|$|A study {{published}} in December 2012 in The Journal of the American Medical Association observed the possible association between exposure to the World Trade Center debris and excess cancer risk. Over 55,000 individuals enrolled in the World Trade Center Health Registry, separated by rescue and/or recovery workers and non-rescue and/or recovery workers, were observed from 2003 or 2004 to December 31, 2008. The findings showed the overall incidence of all cancers among rescue and/or recovery workers was not significantly elevated, compared to non-rescue and/or recovery workers. Despite this, the incidences for prostate cancer, thyroid cancer, and multiple myeloma were significantly elevated among the rescue and/or recovery workers, in the final <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>observation.</b>|$|E

40|$|This is a {{study of}} the process of {{diagnosis}} in family medicine (FM) in four practice populations from the Netherlands, Malta, Serbia and Japan. Diagnostic odds ratios (ORs) for common reasons for encounter (RfEs) and episode titles are used to study the process of diagnosis in international FM and to test the assumption that data can be aggregated across different age bands, practices and <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>observation.</b> Participating family doctors (FDs) recorded details of all their patient contacts in an episode of care (EoC) structure using the International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC). RfEs presented by the patient and the diagnostic labels (EoC titles) recorded for each encounter were classified with ICPC. The relationships between RfEs and episode titles were expressed as ORs using Bayesian probability analysis to calculate the posterior (post-test) odds of an episode title given an RfE, {{at the start of a}} new EoC. The distributions of diagnostic ORs from the four population databases are tabled across age groups, <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>observation</b> and practices. There is a lot of congruence in diagnostic process and concepts between populations, across age groups, <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>observation</b> and FD practices, despite differences in the strength of such diagnostic associations. There is particularly little variability of diagnostic ORs across <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>observation</b> and between individual FD practices.

30|$|We {{address the}} {{collinearity}} between <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>observation,</b> year of arrival, and years since immigration (years since immigration[*]=[*]year of observation[*]−[*]year of arrival) by grouping observations by years since immigration and year of arrival. There is also perfect collinearity between age, age at arrival, and years since immigration [age at arrival[*]=[*]age[*]−[*](year of observation[*]−[*]year of arrival)]. Here too, we group the variable age at arrival into categories described above (see Mason et al. 1973 {{for a detailed}} discussion on cohort analysis). In Equation (1), the effects of age at arrival, period of arrival, and <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>observation</b> are restricted to be the same for immigrants living in the three destinations. Statistical tests rejected the restriction that <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>observation</b> has the same effect across destinations, but failed to reject the restriction that age at arrival and period of arrival has the same effect across destinations 10. Therefore, in the empirical analysis we allow the effect of <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>observation</b> to differ across destinations, but restrict the effect of age at arrival and period of arrival to be the same. Note that inclusion of different year effects across destinations allow the effect of the great recession on Mexican immigrants to differ across destinations.|$|E

30|$|Beginning in January 1996, {{budget cuts}} {{lead to a}} {{reduction}} in the CPS sample size, from 56, 000 + households to 50, 000.
