60|$|For {{the first}} {{two or three years}} the young palms must be well watered, and the soil around them opened; after which the tall graceful stem begins to rise rapidly into the open air. In this {{condition}} it may be literally said to make the tropics--those fallacious tropics, I mean, of painters and poets, of Enoch Arden and of Locksley Hall. You may observe that whenever an artist wants to make a tropical picture, he puts a group of coco-nut palms in the foreground, as much as to say, 'You see there's no deception; these are the genuine unadulterated tropics.' But as to painting the tropics without the palms, he might just as well think of painting the desert without the camels. At eight or ten years old the tree flowers, bearing blossoms of the ordinary palm type, degraded likenesses of the lilies and yuccas, greenish and inconspicuous, but visited by insects for the sake of their pollen. The flower, however, is fertilised by the wind, which carries the pollen grains from one bunch of blossoms to another. Then the nuts gradually swell out to an enormous size, and ripen very slowly, even under the brilliant tropical sun. (I will admit that the tropics are hot, though in other respects I hold them to be arrant impostors, like that precocious American youth who announced on his tenth birthday that in his opinion life wasn't all that it was cracked up to be.) But the worst thing about the coco-nut palm, the missionaries always say, is the fatal fact that, when once fairly started, it goes on bearing fruit uninterruptedly for forty years. This is very immoral and wrong of the ill-conditioned tree, because it encourages the idyllic Polynesian to lie under the palms, all day long, cooling his limbs in the sea occasionally, sporting with Amaryllis in the shade, or with the tangles of Neæra's hair, and waiting for the nuts to drop down in due time, when he ought (according to European notions) to be killing himself with hard work under a blazing sky, raising cotton, sugar, indigo, and coffee, for the immediate benefit of the white merchant, and the ultimate advantage of the British public. It doesn't enforce habits of steady industry and perseverance, the good missionaries say; it doesn't induce the native to feel that burning desire for Manchester piece-goods and the other blessings of civilisation which ought properly to accompany the propagation of the missionary in foreign parts. You stick your nut in the sand; you sit by a few years and watch it growing; <b>you</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> ripe fruits as they fall from the tree; and you sell them at last for illimitable red cloth to the Manchester piece-goods merchant. Nothing could be more simple or more satisfactory. And yet {{it is difficult to see}} the precise moral distinction between the owner of a coco-nut grove in the South Sea Islands and the owner of a coal-mine or a big estate in commercial England. Each lounges decorously through life after his own fashion; only the one lounges in a Russia leather chair at a club in Pall Mall, while the other lounges in a nice soft dust-heap beside a rolling surf in Tahiti or the Hawaiian Archipelago.|$|E

Also spectacular is the scenery that offers to those that reach its summit, a well given view of almost all the outstanding points of the Urrieles.|$|E
50|$|The game also {{involves}} exploration stages {{that can be}} accessed after unlocking new jobs. These areas allow the player to dabble in more traditional Chibi-Robo gameplay.

Trash and dust piles litter the vicinity, and Chibi-Robo has the option to either clean it up, or just explore the area. However, in order to leave the area, Chibi-Robo must dispose of the collected refuse in a Recycling Machine located near the exit.

50|$|The Very Clever Pipe Game is a {{card game}} {{produced}} by Cheapass Games. It {{can be played}} by 2-4 people, or more in teams. Like other pipe games, the objective can be to create a closed circuit in pipes of your color by playing cards from your hand. When you accomplish this, <b>you</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> cards. Whoever has the most cards at the end wins. However, what makes this game unique (and thus, according to the maker, Very Clever) {{is that you can}} also choose to close off fields of light or dark backgrounds. If you have four players, for instance, each has a different goal: light pipes, dark pipes, light backgrounds, or dark backgrounds. With so many competing goals, the game becomes quite complicated.|$|E
50|$|The {{telephone}} is {{a device}} that {{is relatively easy to}} understand and use. In fact, the telephone connections used today have remained remarkably unchanged compared to those used almost a century ago. In addition, your connection to the phone company is rather straightforward as well. The telephone makes it easy to connect instantly with others from all over the world, making it simple to have a two-way conversation with a neighbor or with someone many miles away. Phones have undergone some changes over the years. Today, for example, phones use electronic switches instead of operators. The switch uses a dial tone so that when <b>you</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> phone you are aware that both the switch and the phone are functioning properly.|$|E

[...] He then said of [...] "Pretty Vacant", [...] "One of the 1st things you learn when <b>you</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> electric guitar is that riff."

5000|$|In a 2009 interview, {{frontman}} Loyd Boldman said [...] "we put a [...] "stop-groove" [...] {{at the end}} of Side Two {{that would}} [...] "catch" [...] the vinyl record and wouldn’t allow it to eject on an automatic turntable. If <b>you</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> needle and set it down again {{on the other side of}} the stop-groove, you’d hear a packet of computer code that could be deciphered by a Commodore 64, the most popular computer of that time.

5000|$|On the CD and {{cassette}} {{versions of}} the album, the song [...] "Invasion" [...] contained about three minutes of looping guitar feedback {{at the end of}} the song. The vinyl record version had the same feedback, but the difference was that it never ended until <b>you</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> needle. This was because the sound went all the way to the locked groove {{at the end of the}} LP, causing the needle to loop it over and over again. The liner notes state (somewhat implausibly) that no pedals, outboard gear or synthesizers were used anywhere on the album.|$|R
5000|$|In April 2013, in an {{interview}} with XXL, Currensy spoke about the incorporation of flutes on the EP, saying: [...] "Let’s think about what Ron Burgundy’s jazz flute did to Mrs. Corningstone. Ron Burgundy mastered that flute and it made him able to bring her to Pleasure Town on animated horses and they were fuckin’ out in the solar system and all of that. So how could we not employ the talents of Ron Burgundy and his jazz flute on as many cuts as possible for Live in Concert. Nah, man. Honestly, that is the genius that is Bobbi Humphrey and his album that was put together long before me and my brother Wiz ever thought about rapping. Laughs I think at one point there’s maybe like two minutes of flute and nothing else. It’s for everybody’s soul, man. Some people don’t understand it immediately, but after they give it a second and third listen, they understand the music." [...] He went on to explain the sample clearance issues with the EP, saying: [...] "These are them sans one record that we didn’t put on because the person who owned the rights to that record…See we have no problem paying for clearances. I got no problem with that. But this guy, not only were we going to pay him for the sample clearance but he was trying to change lyrics. Things he didn’t like that Wiz said about a chick and shit he didn’t like that I said about weed. Basically we were like “Fam, if you don’t wanna make the bread then cool. We just won’t put the record out.” So homie chose not to pick up the bread and that’s fine. We’re not gonna jump through all these hoops on someone’s behalf when I feel like what we’re doing is going to put some more light on a body of work that our listeners don’t know shit about. We want them to know about it. That’s why we went through the proper channels to do it that way, so people who do their due diligence will see what this project sampled and want to hear that whole album. Then you pick up more money. <b>You</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> money ’cause we paid you to clear it and then <b>you</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> money from the kids who go to get the original album." ...|$|E
5000|$|Finlay & Co. and Glenmorangie Original collaborated in 2016 {{to create}} the world's first {{collection}} of sunglasses made from scotch whisky casks. The casks were made from American White Oak and were used to mature Glenmorangie Original. Finlay & Co. made a total of 1843 pairs of sunglasses to celebrate {{the year in which}} the Glenmorangie Distillery was founded. Each pair was individually numbered and displays the natural grain of the original casks. The FT How to Spend It magazine said, [...] "And the chic, dappled-wood handcrafted glasses - which come in an edition of 1,843 to reflect when the Scottish distillery was founded - still retain the faintest aroma of the aged oak'. The collaboration generated buzz with whisky lovers the world over and was featured in publications including Square Mile, GQ and Forbes. Finlay & Co. co-founder Dane Butler commented in The Observer, “The wood has all of these different complexities that we just had to experiment with really,” he added. “We work with ebony, rosewood, walnut on our other styles, but we’ve never worked with White American Oak before. The grain of it is beautiful, and <b>you</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> different colors in the wood. Obviously you get the natural grain, but then you get the elements where the cask has been burnt. There would be certain bits of the burn color that would flash through on pairs, which was really nice because every single pair is unique both in number and in character as well.” ...|$|E
