2500|$|For {{some time}} Mahal thought of {{pursuing}} farming over music. He {{had developed a}} passion for farming that nearly rivaled his love of music—coming {{to work on a}} farm first at age 16. It was a dairy farm in Palmer, Massachusetts, not far from Springfield. By age nineteen he had become farm foreman, getting up a bit after 4:00a.m. and running the place. [...] "I milked anywhere between thirty-five and seventy cows a day. I clipped udders. I grew corn. I grew Tennessee redtop clover. Alfalfa." [...] Mahal believes in growing one's own food, saying, [...] "You have a whole generation of kids who think everything comes out of a box and a can, and they don't know <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>grow</b> most of your food." [...] Because of his personal support of the family farm, Mahal regularly performs at Farm Aid concerts.|$|E

Entertainment Weekly gave this album a positive review, saying [...] "Dirty Work proves <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>grow</b> up and still {{act like a}} kid, {{just as long as}} your songs are this head-rushingly catchy". AllMusic was also postitive, saying [...] "Consider Dirty Work the band's ultimate bid for mainstream acceptance, and one of their strongest pop albums to date". Alternative Press gave the album an average review, stating [...] "Guts, featuring The Sounds' Maja Ivarsson is a synth-assisted 6/8 number loaded with urgency and lyrical poignancy" [...] yet also notes [...] "Other tracks feel homogenized and lifeless, as if they were focus group to death. Time-Bomb is a Metro Station-aping electro-dance number that does nothing to actually make the listener dance." ...|$|E

40|$|Now <b>You</b> <b>Can</b> Go was an events {{programme}} {{inspired by}} Italian feminisms {{of the late}} 1960 s, 1970 s and 1980 s that Helena Reckitt initiated and organised with six feminist colleagues. It took place across four London art venues, the ICA, The Showroom, SPACE, and Raven Row, 1 - 13 December 2015. Juxtaposing historical with contemporary positions, the series explores feminist concepts of generation and genealogy. It asked whether practices of consciousness-raising and collectivity might help us to combat the fragmentation, exhaustion and anxiety that we experience under networked capitalism. The programme drew inspiration from Italian feminisms, including the work of collectives formed in the 1970 s: Rivolta Femminile (Female Revolt), Libreria delle Donne di Milano (Milan Women’s Bookstore collective), and Lotta Femminista (Feminist Struggle). A touchstone {{was the work of}} Carla Lonzi, the writer and cofounder of Rivolta Femminile, and her refusal of power and rejection of masculine creativity that exploits female supportive activity. This process of ‘deculturation’ entailed Lonzi’s withdrawal from her roles as an art critic, as a feminist leader, and from her relationship with her lover, the sculptor Pietro Consagra, which she documented in a dialogue between them called Vai pure (Now <b>You</b> <b>Can</b> Go). The programme explored four inter-related themes: Revisiting, Translating and Annotating earlier periods of feminism, especially those of second wave Italian feminisms; Social Reproduction; Affective Politics and Human Strike; and Anti-Assimilationist Feminisms. Now <b>You</b> <b>Can</b> Go <b>grew</b> out of the Feminist Duration Reading Group which meets monthly at Space Studios in London. The programme was initiated by Helena Reckitt and developed by participants from the Feminist Duration Reading Group including Angelica Bollettenari, Giulia Casalini, Diana Georgiou, Laura Guy, Irene Revell and Amy Tobin. It was coordinated by Helena Reckitt with Dimitra Gkitsa. Full programme details {{can be found on the}} nowyoucango tumblr site: [URL]...|$|R
