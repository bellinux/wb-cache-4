500|$|Schwartz {{uses the}} [...] "Unlimited" [...] theme {{as the second}} major motif running through the score. Although not {{included}} as a titled song, the theme appears as an interlude {{in several of the}} musical numbers. In a tribute to Harold Arlen, who wrote the score for the 1939 film adaptation, the [...] "Unlimited" [...] melody incorporates the first seven notes of the song [...] "Over the Rainbow." [...] Schwartz included it as an inside joke as, [...] "according to copyright law, {{when you get to the}} eighth note, then people can come and say, 'Oh <b>you</b> <b>stole</b> our tune.' And of course obviously it's also disguised in that it's completely different rhythmically. And it's also harmonized completely differently.... It's over a different chord and so on, but still it's the first seven notes of 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow'". Schwartz further obscured the motif's origin by setting it in a minor key in most instances. This also creates contrast in the songs in which it forms a part, for example in [...] "Defying Gravity", which is written primarily in the key of D-flat major. In the song [...] "The Wicked Witch of the East", however, when Elphaba finally uses her powers to let her sister walk, the [...] "Unlimited" [...] theme is played in a major key.|$|E

And you know I know <b>you</b> <b>stole</b> that from me, right?" [...] Rico Love commented on the recording sessions of the song {{in an interview with}} magazine Rap-Up, saying that [...] "it was a really interesting situation because of the history that was in the room and the energy was so positive. It was electric. I really wanted to try my best to pull the most explosive vocals out of them. ´ It kinda carried on the next part of the story, just showing their growth and their maturity, and making it real and true to both singers. It was an amazing energy, an amazing vibe. The girls were all positive. It was just fun. We had a great time and I learned so much from both of them during the session." [...] Love also revealed that they did alternate versions of the song for both Monica and Brandy's albums. He noted that the changes were minimal.|$|E
