2500|$|On {{the morning}} of July 15, 1974, Chubbuck {{confused}} co-workers by claiming she had to read a newscast to open Suncoast Digest, something she had never done before. That morning's talk show guest waited across the studio while Chubbuck sat at the news anchor's desk. During the first eight minutes of her program, Chubbuck covered three national news stories and then a shooting from the previous day at local restaurant Beef & Bottle, at the Sarasota-Bradenton Airport. The film reel of the restaurant shooting had jammed and would not run, so Chubbuck shrugged it off and said on-camera, [...] "In keeping with Channel 40's policy of bringing <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> in 'blood and guts', and in living color, {{you are going to}} see another first—attempted suicide." [...] She drew the revolver and shot herself behind her right ear. Chubbuck fell forward violently and the technical director faded the broadcast rapidly to black.|$|E
2500|$|In September 1978, Lane visited Jonestown, {{spoke to}} Jonestown residents, {{provided}} {{support for the}} theory that intelligence agencies conspired against Jonestown and drew parallels between Martin Luther King and Jim Jones. [...] Lane then held press conferences stating that [...] "none of the charges" [...] against the Temple [...] "are accurate or true" [...] {{and that there was}} a [...] "massive conspiracy" [...] against the Temple by [...] "intelligence organizations," [...] naming the CIA, FBI, FCC and the U.S. Post Office. [...] Though Lane represented himself as disinterested, the Temple paid Lane $6,000 per month to help generate such theories. [...] Regarding the effect of the work of Lane and Freed upon Temple members, Temple member Annie Moore wrote that [...] "Mom and Dad have probably shown <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> about the conspiracy information that Mark Lane, the famous attorney in the ML King case and Don Freed the other famous author in the Kennedy case have come up with regarding activities planned against us—Peoples Temple." [...] Another Temple member, Carolyn Layton, wrote that Don Freed told them that [...] "anything this drug out could be nothing less than conspiracy".|$|E

The name Gorla is almost an advertisement in itself, and then there's the fact that she's the daughter of a peer." ...|$|E
60|$|In the old days, when Christ with scourges drave The Ravlins headlong {{from the}} Temple's nave, Each bore upon his pelt the mark divine-- The Boycott's red authenticating sign.
