When you sent Lionel upon that errand you voluntarily offered up {{your life to}} restore me to my own people. <b>You</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> right to do this without first consulting me. <b>You</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> right to suppose I would be a party to such a thing.

25|$|Williams and {{her mother}} Helen co-authored a memoir {{entitled}} <b>You</b> <b>Have</b> <b>No</b> Idea, published in April 2012. In the book, Williams discusses her childhood, rise to fame, and personal struggles (including life with type 1 diabetes), {{including the fact that}} she was sexually molested by a woman when she was 10 years old. She also spoke candidly about having an abortion while she was in high school.|$|E
25|$|A claim can be {{made that}} the {{difference}} between the two cases is that in the second, you intend someone's death to save the five, and this is wrong, whereas, in the first, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> such intention. This solution is essentially an application of the doctrine of double effect, which says that you may take action which has bad side effects, but deliberately intending harm (even for good causes) is wrong.|$|E
25|$|Imagine {{for example}} using a {{stopwatch}} to mark-off tiny increments {{of time as}} a car travels down a highway. Imagine also looking at the car's speedometer as it travels, so that at every moment you know the velocity of the car. To understand {{the power of this}} theorem, imagine also that you are not allowed {{to look out the window}} of the car, so that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> direct evidence of how far the car has traveled.|$|E

25|$|Anyone {{wishing to}} live and work in Serbia will be {{required}} to apply for a temporary residence permit. To obtain a temporary visa for employment purposes, you will need to secure a job offer from a Serbian company or government department, or a foreign company based in Serbia. The criteria for approval of an employment visa include suitable educational qualifications or work experience, a secured employment contract in Serbia, proof of adequate means of subsistence in Serbia, police confirmation that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> criminal record, and a satisfactory medical examination. All official documents must be translated into Serbian.|$|E
25|$|<b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> {{idea what}} sending on those checks {{to me at}} this time. After {{fighting}} for an idea all your life I realize that your backing has saved it for me and meant to thank you {{with all my heart}} and soul for what you have done. It has been marvelous. So many letters have been written and not mailed and owing to having been in bed {{a great deal of time}} this summer, the paintings were about all I could muster up enough energy to do what I considered the best of my ability. Just before Stieglitz’s death I took some paintings to him that I considered as having something new in the. He immediately walked right up to them and spoke of the new ideas. His intuition in that way was remarkable and I am so glad to have been allowed to live during his and your lifetimes. It has been a great privilege for which I am truly thankful.|$|E
25|$|The British came up {{and found}} her to be Princesa, {{carrying}} 64 guns and a crew of 650 {{under the command of}} Don Parlo Augustino de Gera. They began to chase her at 10am, upon which she lowered the French colours she had been flying and hoisted Spanish ones. Mayne addressed his men saying 'When you received the pay of your country, you engaged yourselves to stand all dangers in her cause. Now is the trial; fight like men for <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> hope but in your courage.' After a two and half hour chase the British were able to come alongside and exchange broadsides, which eventually left the Spanish ship disabled. The British then raked her until she struck her colours. The Spanish ship had casualties of 33 killed and around 100 wounded, while eight men were killed aboard both Kent and Orford, and another one aboard Lenox. Total British wounded amounted to 40, and included Captain Durell of Kent, who had one of his hands shot away. The commander of Orford during the engagement had been Lord Augustus FitzRoy.|$|E

An Horrific Alien Birth! A Violent Nightmare in Blood! Inseminoid at a Cinema Near You Soon!" [...] Warren, who regrets {{the decision to}} publicise the film in such a graphic manner, comments, [...] "The problem with mail-drops is that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> way of knowing {{who lives in the}} house, or who will see it first. It could be a pregnant woman, and old lady, or even worse, a young child. So it was not such a good idea." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{set list}} {{consisted}} of songs from her debut album mainly, but some new songs like [...] "Fashion" [...] from the Confessions of a Shopaholic soundtrack were also considered. In May, {{during an interview}} with Edmonton Sun Gaga announced that the tour would continue through European festivals in summer. She also declared plans for a bigger North American tour including Canada. Gaga explained that the show {{is supposed to be}} much bigger than the previous version. She said, [...] "Oh, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> idea, [...] The tour that we're about to announce is such a dream that I have to pinch myself almost every day to remind myself that it's happening." ...|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} details Stefani's former {{relationship}} with Kanal. The same critic from Classic Rock Review {{agreed that it}} [...] "deal with Gwen Stefani's recent breakup with Kanal". Kenneth Partridge's Billboard review stated that the song's lyrics involved Stefani's feelings towards Kanal, adding that it was [...] "written about the guy that got away – and who was standing {{a few feet away}} with a bass around his neck". Similarly, David Browne of Entertainment Weekly approved of the [...] "taunt" [...] and [...] "savor" [...] lyrics that describe a man who ended a relationship but [...] "wants back in", such as [...] "All by yourself / <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> one else".|$|E
500|$|A harper {{dressed as}} the Greek poet Homer entertained the crowds, {{enhancing}} the classical Olympic theme.

Various games were played for small stakes in booths and tents, including chess, Irisha game similar to backgammonand card games such as cent, a game like piquet. King James approved of card games [...] "when <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> other thing ado... and are weary of reading... {{and when it is}} foul and stormy weather", but he considered chess to be [...] "too obsessive a game".|$|E

500|$|In Revenge of the Sith, McDiarmid {{played a}} darker {{interpretation}} of the character. He explained that [...] "when you're playing a character of solid blackness, {{that in itself is}} very interesting, in the sense that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> other motivation other than the accumulation of power. It's not so much about not having a moral center, it's just that the only thing that mattered is increasing power." [...] He admitted, [...] "I've been trying to find a redeeming feature to Palpatine, and the only one I've got so far is that he's clearly a patron of the arts because he goes to the opera." [...] McDiarmid compared the character to Iago from William Shakespeare's Othello: ...|$|E
500|$|... 'Judas' is {{a metaphor}} and an analogy about {{forgiveness}} and betrayal and things that haunt you {{in your life and}} how I believe that it's the darkness in your life that ultimately shines and illuminates the greater light that you have upon you. Someone once said to me, 'If <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> shadows then you're not standing in the light.' So the song is about washing the feet of both good and evil and understanding and forgiving the demons from your past in order to move into the greatness of your future. I just like really aggressive metaphors—harder, thicker, darker—and my fans do as well. So it is a very challenging and aggressive metaphor, but it {{is a metaphor}}.|$|E
500|$|In his 1980 {{commentary}} on the story, Dick also suggested that his reasoning for making Bors sympathetic {{was a result of}} a form of trust he advanced towards robots, as opposed to androids. [...] "Perhaps", he suggested, [...] "it's because a robot does not try to deceive you as to what it is". One of the themes that runs throughout all of Dick's fiction is the [...] "power of empathy" [...] and he uses it as the [...] "key element defining the authentic human being". For example, when Silvia meets the robot that runs the government, she exclaims [...] "My God, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> understanding of us. You run all this, and you're incapable of empathy. You're nothing but a mechanical computer." ...|$|E
