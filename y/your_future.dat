50|$|An expiring OCX.Weekly spread is an {{exchange}} traded centrally cleared alternative to traditional OTC stock loan and dealer equity repo. If you own stock, buying the expiring weekly spread, (meaning buy the deferred expiration {{and sell the}} expiring) closes out your stock position and establishes a long futures position, thus transferring your delta from the stock to the <b>future.</b> <b>Your</b> stock position is closed out by delivering the stock to fulfill <b>your</b> short <b>future</b> obligation the next day while your long position is maintained by <b>your</b> <b>futures</b> position.|$|R

500|$|... 'Judas' is {{a metaphor}} and an analogy about {{forgiveness}} and betrayal and things that haunt you {{in your life and}} how I believe that it's the darkness in your life that ultimately shines and illuminates the greater light that you have upon you. Someone once said to me, 'If you have no shadows then you're not standing in the light.' So the song is about washing the feet of both good and evil and understanding and forgiving the demons from your past in order to move into the greatness of <b>your</b> <b>future.</b> I just like really aggressive metaphors—harder, thicker, darker—and my fans do as well. So it is a very challenging and aggressive metaphor, but it {{is a metaphor}}.|$|E

In early March 2014, {{it was announced}} that the band's sixth album, Ghost Stories, would be released 19 May 2014. Ghost Stories is a spiritually driven album that revolves around two major themes mentioned by Chris Martin. The album explores the idea of past actions, and the effects they can have on <b>your</b> <b>future</b> and one's capacity for unconditional love. The band took a different approach for their sixth studio album in contrast to their previous studio albums, with Martin inviting the band to contribute original songwriting material for the album, as opposed to building songs off his ideas as they had done during previous recording sessions.|$|E

30|$|The {{richness}} of the Futures Map is the special target {{of the first and}} the third criteria of the pragmatic external validity. Using the concept of Ackoff [1], their main function is to avoid the omission error. The omission error is one formulation of the so-called third kind of error in the statistical inference. In the statistical inference, you make the acceptance error if you accept something that you should reject (the type I error). The type II error is the rejection error. You do not accept something that you should accept. In the Futures Map frame, you make the type I or II error if you wrongly either add or reject to add a hypothetical scenario path to the futures map. Using the metaphor of the geographical map, <b>your</b> <b>Futures</b> Map has a type I error if it includes a path that in practice is not available. It has a type II error if <b>your</b> <b>Futures</b> Map does not describe a hypothetical path that is available in the futures landscape.|$|R
