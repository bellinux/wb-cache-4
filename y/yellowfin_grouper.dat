25|$|Grouper are fish {{belonging}} {{to a number of}} genera in the subfamily Epinephelinae of the family Serranidae, in the order Perciformes. Species of grouper include the black, comet, gag, giant, Goliath, Nassau, saddletail, tiger, Warsaw, white and <b>yellowfin</b> <b>grouper.</b> Typical lengths are 80–120 centimetres. They inhabit depths from reefs near the surface down to over 400 metres. They feed on just about any moving animal they encounter. Groper are important inshore commercial fish, usually caught with gill nets (in earlier times longlines were used).|$|E
50|$|The fish is {{variable}} in color, but is usually similar in appearance {{to the black}} grouper. It is distinguishable by the bright yellow trim on the pectoral fins. The <b>yellowfin</b> <b>grouper</b> is a hearty fish, often reaching 10 kg. It is considered quite tasty {{and is one of}} the more popular Gulf gamefishes. It has been known to be a cause of ciguatera toxin poisoning, however. An attractive animal, the <b>yellowfin</b> <b>grouper</b> is a popular aquarium fish.|$|E
50|$|The <b>yellowfin</b> <b>grouper</b> (Mycteroperca venenosa) is a {{coral reef}} fish {{native to the}} western Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean Sea, and the Gulf of Mexico. It is {{generally}} a denizen of the deeper reef areas, but it may venture into shallower waters, especially during the cooler seasons.|$|E

40|$|We {{inventoried}} fishes {{associated with}} three hardbottom reef tracts that {{are separated by}} sand and run parallel to the coast in sequentially deeper water offshore Broward County, Florida. Using SCUBA and the Bohnsack-Bannerot visual point count method, we recorded fish abundance, species richness, sizes (TL), and general habitat characteristics within an imaginary 15 m cylinder extending from the substrate to the surface. Sites were sampled along transects at quarter nautical mile intervals along 18 nautical miles of coastline at western and eastern edges, and crest {{of each of the}} three reef tracts. A total of 86, 463 fishes belonging to 208 species and 52 families was censused from 667 sites over four years (August 1998 to November 2002). Mean species richness, mean total abundance and mean total biomass of fishes increased significantly on each reef tract moving offshore (p Differences were found within reef tracts based on edge or crest sites and position along reefs north or south of Port Everglades and Hillsboro Inlet. Sites within 5 na. mi. south of Port Everglades had lower total abundance and species richness (p Of management interest, was a scarcity or absence of groupers and snappers observed over four years. Although juvenile red grouper were frequently seen (n = 232 at 667 sites), only two were above legal minimum size. No goliath or black grouper were recorded. A total of 10 gag, <b>yellowfin,</b> or scamp <b>grouper</b> was observed; none were legal. Among six snapper species, 219 of 718 were of legal size...|$|R

Species of fish found here include Cubera snapper, Bonefish, <b>Yellowfin</b> <b>grouper,</b> Black grouper, Atlantic goliath grouper as well as Strombus gigas (the large Caribbean conch) and Whale shark.Besides being an extraordinary site for fly fishing, one its main attractions for diving is the abundance of reef sharks.|$|E

40|$|Ages of <b>yellowfin</b> <b>grouper</b> (n = 306) {{from the}} southeastern United States coast from 1979 – 2014 were {{determined}} using sectioned sagittal otoliths. Opaque zones were annular, forming January–June (peaking in February–March). <b>Yellowfin</b> <b>grouper</b> {{ranged in age}} from 3 to 31 years; the largest fish measured 1, 000 mm fork length (FL). Body size relationships for <b>yellowfin</b> <b>grouper</b> were: W = 1. 22 × 10 − 5 FL 3. 03 (n = 229, r 2 = 0. 92); TL = 1. 06 FL − 14. 53 (n = 60, r 2 = 0. 99); and FL = 0. 93 TL + 18. 63 (n = 60, r 2 = 0. 99), where W = whole weight in grams, FL in mm, and TL = total length in mm.
