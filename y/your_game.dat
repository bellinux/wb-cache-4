500|$|Under {{the working}} title [...] "Jellybean", {{the film was}} shot over a span of six weeks in fifty-two locales {{throughout}} the city of Atlanta. Filming {{took place in the}} summer, sometimes in temperatures over a hundred degrees, challenging the cast and crew's ability to stay motivated. [...] "A lot of times we had to motivate each other to say 'listen, up <b>your</b> <b>game.</b> Go hard,'" [...] said Robinson. [...] "And sometimes we needed to step back, take a breath, so we could get through." ...|$|E
500|$|Over 110 {{developers}} {{worked on}} the game, a number that director Nate Fox considered small. He felt that working with a small team necessitated having a defined vision for the game from the outset, [...] "to answer those first questions {{about what you want}} <b>your</b> <b>game</b> to be". Sometimes, ideas came about during development {{that would have to be}} thrown out for not fitting with the game's original vision. [...] "We kill our darlings at Sucker Punch.

The glitch {{is the result of a}} succession of events: first, players watch an in-game tutorial for Pokémon capture.

500|$|The {{rhythm of}} the music pauses for two beats. It resumes at a calmer level as the camera shows Jordan in street clothes, {{watching}} from the sideline. Jordan is shown for just two seconds, smiling and nodding. Waterbury said of this shot, [...] "We {{wanted to make sure}} that, through this commercial, people understood Michael's role as a mentor and a coach. His nod of approval at the end is his way of saying, 'Go.'"

500|$|Pitt {{took the}} role of Paul Maclean in the 1992 biographical film A River Runs Through It, {{directed}} by Robert Redford. His portrayal of the character was described by Peoples Janet Mock as a career-making performance, proving that Pitt could {{be more than a}} [...] "cowboy-hatted hunk." [...] He has admitted to feeling under pressure when making the film and thought it one of his [...] "weakest performances... It's so weird that it ended up being the one that I got the most attention for." [...] Pitt believed that he benefited from working with such a talented cast and crew.

500|$|Anna Kendrick plays Ginny Ryerson, {{the ambitious}} and {{competitive}} {{star of the}} Plainsboro High School debate team. Anna Kendrick {{was one of the}} first cast members to sign on to the film. Blitz recalls writing [...] "Anna Kendrick is Ginny Ryerson" [...] after her audition and, after auditioning many other girls, she was cast. To prepare for her role, Kendrick learned the typical debating strategy of [...] "spreading", a rapid-fire delivery used in order to present as much evidence and information as possible within a time limit. Kendrick and Nicholas D'Agosto studied with a college debate coach and also viewed a live high school debate. Ginny's comment [...] "I upped <b>your</b> <b>game,</b> little man" [...] was inserted into the script by Blitz from a journal which he asked Kendrick to write in character.|$|E
500|$|Particularly {{for smaller}} indie developers, {{the nature of}} the procedural-generated world allows teams to deliver many hours worth of game content without having to spend {{resources}} and development time on fleshing out detailed worlds. This also allows developers to devote more time in building out complex gameplay features and their interacting systems {{that are part of the}} enjoyment of roguelike and roguelike-like games. McMillen of The Binding of Isaac stated that incorporating roguelike elements into other game genres can be difficult due to overcoming the complex interfaces roguelikes tend to have, but once a means to do so is found, [...] "it becomes an increasingly beautiful, deep, and everlasting design that allows you to generate a seemingly dynamic experience for players, so that each time they play <b>your</b> <b>game</b> they're getting a totally new adventure".|$|E

The third single from the album was a remix of [...] "I Got Cha Opin", which utilized a smooth jazz sample, courtesy of Barry White's [...] "Playing <b>Your</b> <b>Game</b> Baby". The remix featured a new chorus and all-new verses {{to go along with the}} new production. The single became the group's second Billboard Hot 100 hit in 1994, peaking at number 93.

500|$|Two days later, Stevens' Bulldogs met second-seeded Kansas State in the {{regional}} finals. Perhaps feeling the effects of their double overtime 101–96 win two days prior, Kansas State {{got off to a}} slow start, scoring just 20 points in the first half to trail 27–20. Butler kept the lead in the upper single digits for most of the second half, before Kansas State went on a 13–2 run and took a 52–51 lead. Stevens immediately called time out and re-focused the team. [...] "Play <b>your</b> <b>game.</b> Just play your game," [...] he told them. On the ensuing possession, Butler regained the lead for good. They outscored Kansas State 12–4 {{the rest of the way}} and won the game 63–56. In the post game celebration, Stevens and walk-on forward Emerson Kampen connected on a flying back-bump that became one of the iconic images of the tournament.|$|E
500|$|Guns N' Roses played {{its final}} {{show of the}} Use Your Illusion Tour on July 17, 1993, at River Plate Stadium in Buenos Aires; {{it proved to be}} Rose's last live {{performance}} with the band for seven and a half years. The following August, Rose testified in court against Steven Adler, who had filed a lawsuit contending that he had been illegitimately fired. When the judge ruled against Rose, he agreed to an out-of-court settlement of $2,500,000 and 15% of the royalties for everything Adler recorded prior to his departure. In November of that year, Guns N' Roses released [...] "The Spaghetti Incident?" [...] a cover album of mostly punk songs, which proved less successful than its predecessors. Rose had included the hidden track [...] "Look at <b>Your</b> <b>Game,</b> Girl", a song written by convicted murderer Charles Manson, which he intended as a personal message to his ex-girlfriend Stephanie Seymour. Controversy ensued, and the band subsequently pledged to donate any royalties to the son of one of Manson's victims.|$|E
500|$|Abbott {{initially}} {{created the}} game Confusion in the 1970s, {{and had it}} in finished form by 1980. The game was published in Germany by Franjos in 1992; Abbott was not satisfied with this version, however, due to several flaws in it. The rules {{were published in the}} Spanish translation of his book Abbott's New Card Games in 2008, but the game did not get published in North America until 2011. This Stronghold Games version was named [...] "Best New Abstract Strategy Game" [...] for 2012 by GAMES Magazine. The game is based on the idea of not knowing what your pieces are or what they do {{at the beginning of the}} game. His game Eleusis uses a similar idea, in that you do not know how cards are to be played at the beginning; George Brancaccio, someone Abbott worked with at the Bank of New York, commented on this, saying [...] "In <b>your</b> <b>game</b> Eleusis, you don't know what cards can be played. Why don't you make a board game where you don't know how pieces move?" [...] This is what gave Abbott the idea, and he began work on it soon after.|$|E

[...] The Ohio State locker room erupted into a [...] "roar" [...] after the players learned of Michigan's loss. Conversely, Michigan State running back Javon Ringer expressed disappointment at the game's result, saying [...] "I kinda really wanted [...] to be undefeated for us." [...] Ohio State coach Jim Tressel gave a similar reaction, saying that [...] "I'm never glad when a conference opponent loses outside of <b>your</b> <b>game</b> with them...

[...] ESPN.com {{reported that}} in the hours after the game, [...] "at least one street vendor was doing brisk business selling freshly minted Mountaineers T-shirts near the Ohio State campus", while stores near the campus were [...] "swamped with requests for gear bearing the Mountaineers' gold and black colors and logo", primarily from Ohio State fans who were rejoicing over their rival's defeat. Appalachian State's campus bookstore received {{a large number of}} phone calls from people wanting to buy gear, many of them from Ohio, but were unable to sell them in large quantities due to a state law prohibiting university bookstores from selling items to people who are not students, faculty, or alumni.|$|E
500|$|In April 2007, {{only hours}} after the Virginia Tech {{shooting}} (and before Seung-Hui Cho was actually identified), Thompson predicted that the shooter had trained on the game Counter-Strike. According to Thompson, the game [...] "drills you and gives you scenarios on how to kill them [...] gets you to kill them with your heart rate lower." [...] He says that Seung-Hui [...] "was in a hyper-reality situation in virtual reality." [...] Though Seung-Hui had last been known to have played Counter-Strike in high school, four {{years prior to the}} shooting, Thompson asserts that [...] "you don't drop it when you go to college, typically." [...] Thompson disputed Seung-Hui's roommate's claim that Seung-Hui only used his computer to write fiction, on the grounds that [...] "Cho was able to go room to room calmly, efficiently, coolly killing people." [...] Prior to being identified, Thompson attributed the [...] "flat effect on [...] face" [...] and the efficiency of his attack to video game rehearsals of the shooting. However, a search warrant released, listing the items found in Cho's dorm room, did not contain any video games, and a Washington Post story cited by Thompson later removed a paragraph stating that Seung-Hui enjoyed violent video games in high school. Despite all evidence indicating that Seung-Hui had not played Counter-Strike in years, Thompson continued to insist that [...] "this is not rocket science. When a kid who has never killed anyone in his life goes on a rampage and looks like the Terminator, he's a video gamer." [...] Thompson also sent a letter to Bill Gates, saying, [...] "Mr. Gates, your company is potentially legally liable (for) the harm done at Virginia Tech. <b>Your</b> <b>game,</b> a killing simulator, according to the news that {{used to be in the}} Post, trained him to enjoy killing and how to kill." [...] However, Microsoft did not create Counter-Strike - they only published the Xbox version of the game. The official Virginia state panel commissioned to investigate the shooting determined that Seung-Hui [...] "played video games like Sonic the Hedgehog," [...] and that [...] "none of the video games [...] were war games or had violent themes." ...|$|E
