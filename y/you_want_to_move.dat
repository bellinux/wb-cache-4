500|$|During filming, Cameron {{made use}} of his virtual camera system, {{a new way of}} {{directing}} motion-capture filmmaking. The system shows the actors' virtual counterparts in their digital surroundings in real time, allowing the director to adjust and direct scenes just as if shooting live action. According to Cameron, [...] "It's like a big, powerful game engine. If I want to fly through space, or change my perspective, I can. I can turn the whole scene into a living miniature and go through it on a 50 to 1 scale." [...] Using conventional techniques, the complete virtual world cannot be seen until the motion-capture of the actors is complete. Cameron said this process does not diminish the value or importance of acting. On the contrary, because {{there is no need for}} repeated camera and lighting setups, costume fittings and make-up touch-ups, scenes do not need to be interrupted repeatedly. Cameron described the system as a [...] "form of pure creation where if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> a tree or a mountain or the sky or change the time of day, you have complete control over the elements".|$|E

As he grew up he had learned to know his uncle; Philip was downright and intolerant, and he could not understand that a man might sincerely say things as a clergyman which he never acted up to as a man.

Noddy Holder and Jim Lea are masters of schoolboy hooks, big shouted choruses that anyone can latch onto. No one will ever mistake this for compositional brilliance, but Slade's consistent ability to suck you into their friendly carousing is impressive. The album offers no social profundity, nor even anything of musical worth, but there is no stopping the simple rock hijinks of this spritely dinosaur." [...] Record-Journal stated: [...] "You Boyz Make Big Noize proves that these rocking old-timers still have what it takes in the world of pop metal. Perhaps the thing that Slade does best and what makes their playing so entertaining is the mixture of rocking sincerity and good humor about what it all means. [...] "Sing Shout (Knock Yourself Out)" [...] describes this philosophy in song, and boy does it make <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>move.</b> If this were a just world, Slade would still be making hit records.

At one point, tired of being asked how he types with boxing gloves on, Strong Bad attaches fake fingers: a shrimp, a lit birthday candle, and an action-figure toy." [...] Johnny Dee, a reviewer from The Guardian of the United Kingdom, described the humor of Strong Bad. He wrote: [...] "Like South Park and Modern Toss, Strong Bad isn't exactly beautiful to look at but he's relentlessly funny," [...] and added, [...] "Strong Bad is an animated Mexican wrestler ... and the undoubted star of surreal cartoon site Homestar Runner." ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Examining data on {{the recent}} health care legislation, we {{demonstrate}} that public opinion polls on health care should be treated with caution because of item nonresponse — or “don’t know ” answers — on survey questions. Far from being the great equalizer, opinion polls can actually misrepresent {{the attitudes of the}} popula-tion. First, we show that respondents with lower levels of socioeconomic resources are systematically more likely to give a “don’t know ” response when asked their opinion about health care legislation. Second, these same individuals are more likely to back health care reform. The result is an incomplete portrait of public opinion on the issue of health care in the United States. In the spring of 2010 Democrats and Republicans fought over health care reform. While politicians on opposing sides of the aisle agreed on little with regard to the content of the bill, both parties claimed that public opinion was on their side. On the one hand, White House adviser David Axelrod cited opinion polls as evidence to support his case: If you average together the public polls, what you find is that the Ameri-can people are split on the top line, do you support the plan? But again, when you go underneath, they support the elements of the plan. When you ask them, does the health care system need reform, three quarters of them say yes. When you ask them, do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> Congress <b>to</b> <b>move</b> forward and deal with this issue, three quarters of them say yes. (Axel-rod and Graham 2010...|$|R
