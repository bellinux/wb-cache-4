25|$|Around 1954, {{parties were}} held at Florance's house, {{referred}} to as 'The Hovel'. According to Peter Oyston: over those <b>years</b> <b>my</b> sister and I worked out that we had 82 callers a week, not counting those who came more than once. It was constant open house. My stepfather would start a party with his muso friends while my mother was at the theatre. And then my mother would bring back the cast and any {{people who came to}} see the shows. And the taxi drivers and, if the police called to quieten us up, then the police would be invited in and they'd join the party too. It really was an extraordinary time.|$|E

A star-studded birthday tribute, Sinatra: 80 <b>Years</b> <b>My</b> Way, {{was held}} at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, featuring performers such as Ray Charles, Little Richard, Natalie Cole and Salt-N-Pepa singing his songs.

500|$|The {{first months}} of 1846 were {{dominated}} by a battle in Parliament between the free traders and the protectionists over {{the repeal of the}} Corn Laws, with the latter rallying around Disraeli and Lord George Bentinck. [...] The landowning interest in the Party, under its leader, William Miles MP for East Somerset, had called upon Disraeli to lead the Party. [...] Disraeli had declined, though pledged support to the Country Gentlemen's Interes, as Bentink had offered to lead if he had Disraeli's support. Disraeli stated, in a letter to Sir William Miles of 11 June 1860, that he wished to help [...] "because, from my earliest <b>years,</b> <b>my</b> sympathies had been with the landed interest of England".|$|E
500|$|From 1951 to 1952, he toured Ireland {{with the}} Anew McMaster {{repertory}} company, playing {{over a dozen}} roles. In 1952, he began acting in regional English repertory productions; from 1953 to 1954, {{he worked for the}} Donald Wolfit Company, at the King's Theatre, Hammersmith, performing eight roles. From 1954 until 1959, Pinter acted under the stage name David Baron. In all, Pinter played over 20 roles under that name. [...] To supplement his income from acting, Pinter worked as a waiter, a postman, a bouncer, and a snow-clearer, meanwhile, according to Mark Batty, [...] "harbouring ambitions as a poet and writer." [...] In October 1989 Pinter recalled: [...] "I was in English rep as an actor for about 12 <b>years.</b> <b>My</b> favourite roles were undoubtedly the sinister ones. [...] They're something to get your teeth into." [...] During that period, he also performed occasional roles in his own and others' works for radio, TV, and film, as he continued to do throughout his career.|$|E

PedroII decided {{on a trip to}} Europe that same year to [...] "cheer up" [...] his wife among other reasons (as stated in his own words) and to pay a visit to Leopoldina's four small boys, who had lived in Coburg with their parents since the late 1860s. The Imperial couple would travel abroad again during 1876 and 1887. Teresa Cristina preferred her ordinary life in Brazil, [...] "dedicating herself to her family, religious devotions, and charitable works." [...] In fact, visiting her native land only served to resurrect painful memories. Her family had been dethroned in 1861 and the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies had been annexed to what would later become the unified Kingdom of Italy. Everyone she had known from her youth was gone. As she wrote in 1872: [...] "I {{do not know how to}} tell what was the impression I had upon seeing again, after 28 <b>years,</b> <b>my</b> fatherland and not to find anyone for whom I cared." ...|$|E
500|$|My Love: Essential Collection is a {{greatest}} hits album by Canadian recording artist Celine Dion. It {{was released by}} Columbia Records on 24 October 2008 as the follow up to her previous English-language compilation, All the Way... A Decade of Song (1999). Before releasing My Love: Essential Collection, Dion had already sold over 200 million albums worldwide. In the album's liner notes, she dedicated this collection of songs, recorded between 1990 and 2008, to her fans who supported her throughout the <b>years.</b> <b>My</b> Love: Essential Collection was released as a single disc, consisting of Dion's most successful singles, including: [...] "My Heart Will Go On", [...] "Because You Loved Me" [...] and [...] "The Power of Love". The two-disc edition, entitled My Love: Ultimate Essential Collection has been further expanded to include rare songs that have not previously appeared on her albums. Both editions include one new track, [...] "There Comes a Time". The album wasn't released in Japan because Sony Music Entertainment decided to issue different compilation there, Complete Best.|$|E
500|$|Dreamwave Productions {{shut down}} on January 4, 2005, and {{announced}} they would cease publication {{of all their}} comics, leaving [...] and its prequel series, [...] incomplete. Chris Ryall, editor-in-chief of IDW Publishing, leaped {{at the chance to}} bid on the property. On May 19, 2005, Hasbro announced they had awarded the licensing rights to IDW Publishing, with plans for an issue #0 in October 2005 and an ongoing title entitled [...] to begin in January 2006. Beforehand, Ryall met up with long-time writer Simon Furman. Furman aimed for a contemporary version of the [...] incarnation to appeal to new and old fans alike. They both cited a focus on the [...] "Robots in Disguise" [...] element of the characters, aiming to bring back their [...] "myth and majesty". Overall, Furman described it as, [...] "This was, at last (after 20-plus <b>years)</b> <b>MY</b> take on Transformers." [...] Furman also aimed for a real time approach, using maps to help guide his stories. Infiltrations issue #0 sold 100,000 copies in pre-orders, a record for the company. Furman focused the story on Autobot medic Ratchet and broke new ground for G1-based storylines by excluding the Ark crash storyline, to give proper intent to the Transformers being on Earth, thus separating the fictional universe from the Beast Wars one. E. J. Su was hired as the artist, and was given free rein to re-design characters slightly.|$|E

500|$|Casino Royale reboots the series, {{establishing}} a new timeline and narrative framework {{not meant to}} precede or succeed any previous Bond film. Barbara Broccoli stated that [...] "For <b>years,</b> <b>my</b> father wanted to make Casino Royale—it's the Holy Grail... We {{wanted to make a}} tougher film, the way it should have been made years ago". Fellow producer Michael G. Wilson agreed, commenting [...] "We felt the last film was too fantastical, so we {{decided to go back to}} the basics and update". Neal Purvis and Robert Wade began writing a screenplay at the end of February 2004, while Pierce Brosnan was still Bond. Paul Haggis was brought in later, and his main contribution included rewriting the climax of the film. He explained that [...] "the draft that was there was very faithful to the book and there was a confession, so in the original draft the character confessed and killed herself. She then sent Bond to chase after the villains; Bond chased the villains into the house. I don't know why but I thought that Vesper [...] had to be in the sinking house and Bond has to want to kill her and then try and save her". In February 2005 Martin Campbell was announced as the film's director and the next Bond film was revealed to be Casino Royale, although the identity of the new Bond was still unknown; the producers had chosen not to renew Pierce Brosnan's contract, and in October Eon announced that the part of Bond would be taken by Daniel Craig.|$|E
