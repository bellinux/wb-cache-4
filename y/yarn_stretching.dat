Micropolar continuum models describing the effective mechanical behavior of woven fabric monolayers are constructed from the homogenization of an identified repetitive pattern of the textile within a representative unit cell. The interwoven yarns within the textile are represented as a network of trusses connected by nodes at their crossover points. These trusses have extensional and bending rigidities to allow for <b>yarn</b> <b>stretching</b> and flexion, and a transverse shear deformation is additionally considered. Interactions between yarns at the crossover points are captured by beam segments connecting the nodes. The woven fabric is modeled after homogenization as an anisotropic planar continuum with two preferred material directions in the mean plane of the textile. Based on the developed methodology, the effective mechanical properties of plain weave and twill are evaluated, including their bending moduli and characteristic flexural lengths. A satisfactory agreement is obtained between the effective moduli obtained by homogenization and numerical values obtained by finite element simulations performed over periodic unit cells...|$|E

40|$|The {{packing density}} of {{filaments}} in zero-twist <b>stretch</b> <b>yarns</b> {{is very low}} and the filament segments between points of entanglement are very long. This combination results in relatively high mobility of filament segments along the yarn axis and in any direction away from the yarn axis [1]. The relatively high mobility of the filaments means that the <b>stretch</b> <b>yarn</b> structure is easily deformed and that yarn has poor dimensional stability in general. The flattening out of the yarn structure occurs rather easily under normal bend-ing or compressional deformations. The spreading of fila-ments changes the yarn cross-sectional shape to a rather flat, ribbon-like structure, or one that is quite elliptical. This collapse of the filament bundle permits a much greater area of contact with other surfaces, resulting in greater friction and discomfort in apparel applications. I...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Based on fiber {{reinforced}} {{continuum mechanics}} theory, a simple hyperelastic constitutive model is developed {{to characterize the}} anisotropic nonlinear material behaviour of woven composite fabrics under large deformation during forming. The strain energy function for the hyperelastic model is additively decomposed into two parts nominally representing the tensile energy from weft and warp <b>yarn</b> fiber <b>stretches</b> and shearing energy from fiber-fiber interaction between weft and warp yarns, respectively. The proposed material characterization approach is demonstrated on a balanced plain weave composite fabric. The equivalent material parameters in the hyperelastic constitutive model are obtained by matching experimental load-displacement data of uni-axial tensile and picture frame tests on the woven composite fabric. The development of this anisotropic fiber reinforced hyperelastic model {{is critical to the}} numerical simulation and optimization of woven composites forming...|$|R

Trockel's [...] "knitting pictures", produced in 1985, consist of lengths of machine-knitted, woolen material stretched onto frames. The material is patterned with computer-generated geometrical motifs, or with recognizable logos, such as the hammer and sickle motif of the Soviet Union superimposed on a background of red and white stripes reminiscent of the US flag. I See Darkness (2011) {{is one of the}} wool series for which Trockel is best known. Black <b>yarn</b> is <b>stretched</b> across a square of white perspex in vertical lines which, from far away, create the illusion of a monochrome painting.

Bobbins of elastane were woven on an air-jet loom and a distinction of the bobbins in three categories was made according to the most important production processes for elastane yarn: core twist, core spun and air covered.

Subsequent electroless {{deposition of metal}} particles onto the brush-modified cotton yarns yields electrically conductive yarns, which have conductivity as high as similar to 1 S/cm {{and can be used}} as electrical wires in wearable:, flexible electronic devices. Importantly, the formation of polymer brush-bridged metal/cotton hierarchical structures provides robust mechanical and electrical durability to the <b>yarns</b> under many <b>stretching,</b> bending, rubbing, and washing cycles. With proper selection of metal, the conductivity of the samples remains stable after they are stored in air for a Few months.

30|$|For {{the elastic}} {{recovery}} rate of Hanji denim fabrics {{developed in the}} study, we compared the result with that of existing stretch denim fabrics (S 1, S 2). Basically, the standard denim fabrics are made of unbleached cotton yarn, {{so there is no}} elasticity and many wrinkles. Recently, denim fabrics have been given elasticity according to consumersâ€™ needs. The existing denim fabrics, which were compared with the Hanji denim fabric produced in this study, were denim fabrics with medium stretch (S 1) and high stretch (S 2). The approximate structure of the existing denim fabrics (S 1, S 2), using the analysis of fabric structure, showed cotton yarns (navy color) and <b>stretch</b> <b>yarns</b> used as warp and weft, respectively. Most Hanji denim fabrics produced, except for the DF 1 (C 10) and the DF 2 (C 10), showed a higher elastic recovery rate than that of existing medium stretch denim fabric (S 1). The high recovery rate trend resulted mainly in the denim fabrics using the rope-dyed yarn.|$|R
40|$|Nanofiber yarns are {{important}} {{building blocks for}} making three-dimensional nanostructures, e. g. through a knitting or weaving process, with better mechanical properties than nanofiber nonwovens and well-controlled fibrous construction. However, it still remains challenging to produce quality nanofiber yarns in a sufficient rate. In this study, we have proven that online stretching during electrospinning of nanofiber yarns can considerably improve fiber alignment and molecular orientation within the yarn and increase yarn tensile strength, but reduce fiber/yarn diameters. By compensating twist during online stretching, the device can prepare nanofiber <b>yarns</b> with different <b>stretch</b> levels, but maintaining the same twist multiplier. This allows us to {{examine the effect of}} stretching on fiber and yarn morphology. It was interesting to find that on increasing the stretching ratio from 0 % to 95 %, the yarn diameter reduced from 135. 1 Â± 20. 3 Î¼m to 46. 2 Â± 10. 2 Î¼m, and the fiber diameter reduced from 998 Â± 141 nm to 631 Â± 98 nm, whereas the yarn tensile strength increased from 48. 2 Â± 5. 6 MPa to 127. 7 Â± 5. 4 MPa. Such an advanced yarn electrospinning technique can produce nanofiber yarn with an overall yarn production rate as high as 10 m minâˆ’ 1. This may be useful for production of nanofiber yarns for various applications...|$|R
40|$|Electrically {{conductive}} or electro-active fibers are the {{key components}} of smart and interactive textiles, {{which could be used}} in medical, sports, energy, and military applications in the near future. The functionalization of high-performance textile yarns/fibers with conjugated polymers can produce conductive fibers with better electro-mechanical properties, which is difficult with commonly used spinning techniques. In this thesis work, textile-based conductive yarns/fibers were prepared by coating viscose and polyester (PET) yarns with the conjugated polymer PEDOT. For coating purposes, an efficient technique called chemical vapor deposition (CVD) was used, which is a solventless technique and can produce PEDOT polymer layers with high conductivity values. The polymerization of EDOT monomer vapors and coating of oxidantï€­ (FeCl 3 or FepTS) enriched viscose and PET yarns took place simultaneously. The PEDOT-coated viscose and polyester yarns showed relatively high conductivity values, which could be sufficient for many electronic applications. The polymerization process and the quality of PEDOT polymer strongly depends on different reaction conditions. In this research work, the impact of most of these reaction parameters on the electrical, mechanical, and thermal properties of PEDOT-coated conductive yarns was considered separately. Under specific reaction conditions, it was found that viscose fibers were successfully coated with PEDOT polymer and showed rather high electrical conductivity (â‰¥ 15 S/cm). However, due to the acid hydrolysis of viscose fibers in FeCl 3 solutions, the mechanical properties were drastically reduced. In order to improve the mechanical properties of conductive yarns, a relatively stable and chemical-resistant substrate (PET) was coated with PEDOT polymer. Comparative studies between PEDOT-coated viscose and PET conductive yarns showed that the electrical and mechanical properties were enhanced by changing the substrate material. Later on, PEDOT-coated conductive fibers were treated with silicone elastomer solution and due to the thin silicone layers, the hydrophobic properties, flexibility, and durability of coated yarns was improved. Furthermore, a novel electrical resistance-measuring setup was developed, which can be used not only for fibers but also for fabric structures. The electrical characterization of PEDOT-coated conductive yarns showed that it can be used effectively for sensitive fibers without damaging their surface morphology. Finally, the use of conductive <b>yarns</b> as <b>stretch</b> sensors was evaluated. For this purpose, small rectangular knitted patches of conductive yarns were prepared and then the change in electrical resistance values at different extension percentages (5 â€“ 50 %) was investigated. The constant variations in electrical resistance values at different extension and relaxation cycles {{for longer periods of time}} revealed that the conductive yarns produced have the potential to be used as stretch sensors for monitoring of vital signs in medical and sports applications.
