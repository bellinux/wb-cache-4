25|$|The dual-carriage Grand Trunk Road {{takes you}} past Gujar Khan and Sohawa, {{to the small}} town of Dina 130km away. Just past Dina you will drive over a railway overpass, stay {{to the right of the}} road and take the first U-turn to drive back towards Dina. After about 100 meters to <b>your</b> <b>left</b> you will find a signpost, which {{indicates}} the way towards the road leading to Rohtas Fort which is 8km away, past the small holy village of Muftian home to the Mufti Tribe. Drive on the road to enter into the fort and keep driving till you reach the parking area.|$|E
25|$|Stick heights are {{not only}} {{important}} for visual reasons but they also strongly affect the sound quality. To get a uniform and consistent sound, one must play with even stick heights {{on the right and}} left hand. To practice playing with accurate stick heights, set up your drum or pad in front of a mirror. Start with a simple exercise and watch to see if <b>your</b> <b>left</b> heights are even with your right. If you have access to a video camera, you can record yourself and watch it later. It is easier to watch your heights and critique your performance when you are not focusing on playing.|$|E

While they are nearly the same beach, the Oppenheimer house is open to the public, but the Gibney house sections are private. In the Virgin Islands, public domain property is from the sea to the first line of vegetation. Behind the first line of vegetation, the Gibney Beach property belongs to the Gibney family. Gibney has appeared on commercials and in magazines. It has also been used by Hollywood as settings for the motion pictures “The Four Seasons” and “Columbus”.|$|E
25|$|Traditional Japanese {{table setting}} {{is to place}} a bowl of rice on <b>your</b> <b>left</b> and to place a bowl of miso soup on your right side at the table. Behind these, each okazu is served on its own {{individual}} plate. Based on the standard three okazu formula, behind the rice and soup are three flat plates to hold the three okazu; one to far back left, one at far back right, {{and one in the}} center. Pickled vegetables are often served on the side but are not counted as part of the three okazu. Chopsticks are generally placed at the very front of the tray near the diner with pointed ends facing left and supported by a chopstick rest, or hashioki.|$|E

500|$|Concerned for his health, Irving's {{brothers}} financed {{an extended}} tour of Europe from 1804 to 1806. Irving bypassed {{most of the}} sites and locations considered essential {{for the development of}} an upwardly mobile young man, to the dismay of his brother William. William wrote that, though he was pleased his brother's health was improving, he did not like the choice to [...] "gallop through Italy... leaving Florence on <b>your</b> <b>left</b> and Venice on your right". Instead, Irving honed the social and conversational skills that would later make him one of the world's most in-demand guests. [...] "I endeavor to take things as they come with cheerfulness", Irving wrote, [...] "and when I cannot get a dinner to suit my taste, I endeavor to get a taste to suit my dinner". While visiting Rome in 1805, Irving struck up a friendship with the American painter Washington Allston and nearly allowed himself to be persuaded into following Allston into a career as a painter. [...] "My lot in life, however", Irving said later, [...] "was differently cast".|$|E

The otherwise comfy seats move fore and aft, but the rake is fixed, which can be-and was for me-a real pain. Speaking of driver discomforts, there's no dead pedal for <b>your</b> <b>left</b> foot, and your right thigh gets a good grilling from the aluminum transmission tunnel. The snap-shut side curtains cannot be raised or lowered like conventional windows, so you're either freezing or sweltering." ...|$|E
2500|$|... {{asked the}} boy {{to go to the}} kitchen on my right, and the right camera {{followed}} him and the left stayed, so the 3D broke. The girl is in <b>your</b> <b>left</b> eyes and the boy on the right. When he was in the kitchen, your brain didn't know how to watch. It hurts to watch a little, but it was interesting, and when the boy comes back to the girl, the two cameras were again in classic 3D. So I showed it to Jean-Luc and he decided to use this for the film.|$|E
2500|$|Motion capture {{was used}} to capture the {{character}} animations in the game. LucasFilm partner Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) generated the animation.
