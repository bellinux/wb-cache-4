2500|$|Further, Pallett writes, in the song's bridge, Perry adds more {{complexity}} to the song—and {{makes it more}} memorable, in his opinion—by taking the simple step of singing the [...] "let you put <b>your</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> me in my skintight jeans" [...] lyrics entirely on beat, including the reiteration of the song's title.

2500|$|A {{brand new}} single, [...] "Lay <b>Your</b> <b>Hands</b> <b>on</b> Me", was {{released}} in the UK in late 1984 and reached No.13 in the UK charts. Following this, the band parted company with their producer Alex Sadkin and opted to produce their new album, Here's To Future Days, by themselves in Paris. However, in March 1985, while promoting their new single [...] "Roll Over" [...] and the forthcoming album, Bailey collapsed in his London hotel room from nervous exhaustion. The [...] "Roll Over" [...] single was then cancelled {{at the last minute}} and the new album postponed.

The album was eventually released in September 1985, reaching the UK Top 5 and US Top 20, though failed to come close to the success of Into The Gap.

2500|$|... "So Emotional", [...] "Love for All Seasons" [...] and [...] "Somebody's Somebody" [...] {{incorporate}} strong {{elements of}} R and soul. [...] "So Emotional" [...] is a midtempo gospel-inspired number {{talking about a}} man who has got Aguilera [...] "on the ropes." [...] "Love for All Seasons" [...] is a pop track which is musically similar to Carey's [...] "Always Be My Baby" [...] (1996), while [...] "Somebody's Somebody", in which Aguilera sings about being secure in one's arms, features drums snap, bass pops, and a gospel organ in the bridge. Aguilera sings about a woman longing to reveal her true self on [...] "Reflection", which Partridge characterized it as the song that [...] "sums up the album." [...] "Come On Over Baby (All I Want Is You)" [...] is deemed the most [...] "sexual" [...] track on Christina Aguilera, a hip hop-influenced song which features a rap verse written by Aguilera herself. [...] "When You Put <b>Your</b> <b>Hands</b> <b>On</b> Me", an R song co-written by Robin Thicke, addresses the alchemy of sex: [...] "I just know / when you put <b>your</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> me / I feel sexy / and my body turns to gold." [...] "Blessed" [...] features elements of gospel, while [...] "Love Will Find A Way" [...] features an R groove and was compared to Carey's songs [...] "Emotions" [...] (1991) and [...] "Dreamlover" [...] (1993).

In her first US network television appearance, O'Connor sang [...] "Mandinka" [...] on Late Night with David Letterman in 1988. The single [...] "Troy" [...] was also released as a single in the UK and Ireland. A club mix of [...] "Troy" [...] would become a major US dance hit in 2002.|$|E
2500|$|Determined {{to prove}} that the success of Slippery When Wet was not a fluke, Bon Jovi {{released}} their fourth effort New Jersey in September 1988. New Jersey peaked at number one in the U.S., Canada, UK, Ireland, New Zealand and Australia. The album produced five Top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100, giving Bon Jovi the record for the most Top 10 singles spawned by a hard rock album. Two of the hits, [...] "Bad Medicine" [...] and [...] "I'll Be There for You", managed to reach number one. The album's three other singles [...] "Born to Be My Baby", [...] "Lay <b>Your</b> <b>Hands</b> <b>on</b> Me", and [...] "Living in Sin" [...] reached the top ten.
