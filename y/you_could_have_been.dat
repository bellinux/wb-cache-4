[...] MacLeod also advises Richie {{to get used to}} her loss, because it [...] "won't be the last time it happens to you." [...] Later, while MacLeod trains Richie roughly so that he can face Immortal Annie Devlin (Sheena Easton), Richie angrily tells MacLeod, [...] "You can't get past it, Mac. I know. You've seen a lot of people die. But you had to be the hero, you sent us out to the car that night, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> there ...You look me in the eyes and you tell me you don't blame yourself for her death." [...] Some time later, MacLeod bitterly tells Devlin, [...] "Nothing you do brings anyone back. Once they're dead... nothing." ...|$|E
2500|$|The novelizations of the Star Wars prequel films {{introduced}} material about Padmé Amidala {{that was}} not included in the films. Terry Brooks' [...] (1999) includes a discussion between Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi. Qui-Gon describes the then-queen of Naboo as [...] "something of an unknown" [...] before the Trade Federation blockade. In the [...] (2002) adaptation by R. A. Salvatore, there is a detailed conversation between Padmé and her sister Sola Naberrie shortly after Jamillia appoints her senator. Sola chides her for ignoring her personal life: [...] "What about Padmé Amidala? Have you even thought about what might make your life better?" [...] Matthew Stover's [...] (2005) elaborates upon Padmé's role in the formation of the Rebel Alliance. Stover narrates Darth Vader's reaction to the death of his wife: Vader thinks to himself, [...] "You killed her because, finally, when you could have saved her, when you could have gone away with her, when <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> thinking about her, you were thinking about yourself ..." ...|$|E
2500|$|The episode {{opens with}} Kröd Mändoon (Sean Maguire) {{mourning}} the recent {{death of his}} mentor General Arcadius (Roger Allam). Kröd is accompanied by his girlfriend Aneka (India de Beaufort), his pig-like 'Grobble' servant Loquasto (Steve Speirs), his sorcerer friend Zezelryck (Kevin Hart) and Bruce (Marques Ray), Arcadius' flamboyant ex-lover. Later, Kröd tells Aneka he wants to seek couples counseling due to her tendency to use sex as a weapon against her enemies. But Aneka refuses, and says she plans to leave {{them to participate in}} 'The Raccoon Festival': a pagan religious ritual in which she has sex with 300 men. When he reacts with anger, Aneka says she is leaving Kröd and tells him, [...] "And I thought <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> one of the ones." [...] Meanwhile, the evil Chancellor Dongalor (Matt Lucas) is told by his advisor Barnabus (Alex MacQueen) that they are still working to discover how to use the Eye of Gulga Grymna, the recently unearthed ancient weapon that Dongalor wants to use to gain power.|$|E

2500|$|Negotiations for the writer's return {{came to an}} end {{after the}} {{publication}} of his Memoirs (Воспоминания, 1950), full of scathing criticism of Soviet cultural life. Apparently aware of his own negativism, Bunin wrote: [...] "I was born too late. If I had been born earlier, my literary memoirs would have been different. I wouldn't have been a witness to 1905, the First World War, then 1917 and what followed: Lenin, Stalin, Hitler... How can I not be jealous of our forefather Noah. He lived through only one flood in his lifetime". Reportedly, the infamous Zhdanov decree {{was one of the reasons}} for Bunin's change of mind. On 15 September 1947, Bunin wrote to Mark Aldanov: [...] "I have a letter here from Teleshov, written on September 7; 'what a pity (he writes) that you've missed all of this: how your book was set up, how everybody was waiting for you here, in the place where <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been...</b> rich, feasted, and held in such high honour!' Having read this I spent an hour hair-tearing. Then I suddenly became calm. It just came to me all of a sudden all those other things Zhdanov and Fadeev might have given me instead of feasts, riches and laurels..." ...|$|E

60|$|ST ERTH. You're deuced positive, sir. So far as I could {{understand}} it, {{there were a}} dozen ways <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> robbed. It {{seems to me you}} value other men's reputations very lightly.|$|E

60|$|LADY CICELY. But I {{should have}} thought that the time for that was in your mother's lifetime, when <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> kind and forbearing with her. Hurting your uncle won't do her any good, you know.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{am sorry}} for this,' said the miller, not expressing half his sorrow {{by the simple}} utterance. 'I wish <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> here to-day, since this is the case,' he added, looking at the horizon through the window.|$|E

6000|$|... "Just as <b>you</b> said. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> righter, {{not if you}} {{had seen}} them at it.
