In this work, it is revealed that Strahd {{had fallen in love}} with a <b>young</b> <b>girl,</b> who in turn loved his younger brother. Strahd blamed his age for the rejection, and made a pact with evil powers to live forever. He then slew his brother, but the <b>young</b> <b>girl</b> killed herself in response, and Strahd found that he had become a vampire. All six possible locations are inside Castle Ravenloft.|$|E

It has also been suggested that the content of <b>young</b> <b>girls</b> blogs has little value, beeing mostly narcissitic, superficial and obsessed with fashion and shopping. The purpose of this paper has been to investigate how <b>young</b> <b>girls</b> reflect upon their photographic communication on the internet.   The idea has been to ask the girls themselves about their own experiences, to get a more complete picture of them as internet users, to investigate their communication strategies and solutions when it comes to net integrity  and to talk about how they create gender and identity online...|$|R
40|$|Self-destructive {{behaviour}} is a {{more and}} more occurring phenomenon in today’s society and there are mostly <b>young</b> <b>girls</b> who are affected by this behaviour. There are different explanations to why the phenomenon appears. The purpose of this research essay is to give a literature overview of the phenomenon of self-harming behaviour of <b>young</b> <b>girls.</b> Two research questions {{have been used to}} study this phenomenon; How can groups of friends contribute to reinforce an identity with the self-destructive behaviour among <b>young</b> <b>girls?</b> How can Internet contributes to reinforce an identity with the self- estructive behaviour among <b>young</b> <b>girls?</b> For the analysis this research essay uses the social constructive theoretical perspective. The method used in this study is based on systematic searching of relevant literature and research. The findings indicate that groups of friends and the Internet constitute a forum where young people can create and develop their own identity. Therefore these two components can also have an important role in developing an identity with the self-destructive behaviour among <b>young</b> <b>girls</b> especially when they have a tendency to seek help from one another...|$|R
