But it {{will not}} be in your power yet awhile to draw from any objects in which the {{gradations}} are varied and complicated; nor will it be a bad omen for your future progress, and for the use that art is to be made of by you, if the first thing at which you aim should {{be a little bit of}} sky. So take any narrow space of evening sky, that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>usually</b> see, between the boughs of a tree, or between two chimneys, or through the corner of a pane in the window you like best to sit at, and try to gradate a little space of white paper as evenly as that is gradated--as tenderly you cannot gradate it without color, no, nor with color either; but you may do it as evenly; or, if you get impatient with your spots and lines of ink, when you look at the beauty of the sky, the sense you will have gained of that beauty is something to be thankful for. But you ought not to be impatient with your pen and ink; for all great painters, however delicate their perception of color, are fond of the peculiar effect of light which may be got in a pen-and-ink sketch, and in a wood-cut, by the gleaming of the white paper between the black lines; and if you cannot gradate well with pure black lines, you will never gradate well with pale ones. By looking at any common wood-cuts, in the cheap publications of the day, you may see how gradation is given to the sky by leaving the lines farther and farther apart; but you must make your lines as fine as you can, as well as far apart, towards the light; and do not try to make them long or straight, but let them cross irregularly in any directions easy to your hand, depending on nothing but their gradation for your effect. On this point of direction of lines, however, I shall have to tell you more, presently; in the meantime, do not trouble yourself about it.|$|E

However, a season-long American Idol-like talent-search show with a sole focus on dance had never been broadcast on American network television. Producers and judges associated with the show have stated on numerous occasions, both {{within the context of the}} show and in interviews, that the series was meant to rejuvenate the visibility and appreciation of dance as an art form in the U.S. and to give exposure to struggling dancers. Series judge Mary Murphy says, for example, [...] "Of course <b>you</b> hope <b>you</b> <b>can</b> make a living at it, because you don't want to give up on something that you do, but the honest truth is most dancers have to carry one or two jobs and dance as much as they can on the side -- it's a very lucky dancer who gets a full scholarship."

You will derive a most powerful indirect assistance, from the influence {{of religion in the}} little community which you govern. But this will be, through the prevalence of its spirit in the hearts of your pupils, and not from any assistance which <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>usually</b> derive from it in managing particular cases of transgression. Many teachers make great mistakes in this respect. A bad boy, who has done something openly and directly subversive of the good order of the school, or the rights of his companions, is called before the master, who thinks that the most powerful weapon to wield against him is the Bible. So while the trembling culprit stands before him, he administers to him a reproof, which consists of an almost ludicrous mixture of scolding, entreaty, religious instruction, and threatening of punishment. But such an occasion as {{this is no time to}} touch a bad boy's heart. He is steeled, at such a moment, against any thing but mortification, and the desire to get out of the hands of the master; and he has an impression, that the teacher appeals to religious principles, only to assist him to sustain his own authority. Of course, religious truth, at such a time, can make no good impression. There may be exceptions to this rule. There doubtless are. I have found some; and every successful teacher who reads this, will probably call some to mind, some which have occurred in the course of his own experience. I am only speaking of what ought to be the general rule, which is, to reserve religious truths for moments of a different character altogether. Bring the principles of the Bible forward when the mind is calm, when the emotions are quieted, and all within is at rest; and in exhibiting them, be actuated not by a desire to make your duties of government easier, but to promote the real and permanent happiness of your charge.|$|E

5000|$|Republic of Macedonia Name-days (Именден, Imenden) in Macedonia are celebrated {{throughout}} the history of this country. It has some similarities with the other Balkan countries but there are some name-days unique for the country. The name-days are scheduled according to the Christian Orthodox church following the Julian calendar. Each month there are several name-days which are celebrated by the people with the same name. Some of the name-days that are more significant to the history and culture are non-working days for the whole country. At these days everyone's invited or would like to say „Кој дојде - Добредојде“ ("Whoever comes—is welcomed") in Macedonian. There is no need for bringing presents but if <b>you</b> like <b>you</b> <b>can</b> bring some (<b>usually</b> wine or something symbolic). You salute the celebrant by saying [...] "Let your name lasts forever" [...] („Нека ти е вечно името“ / [...] "Neka ti e vecno imeto") or [...] "For years to come" [...] („За многу години“ / [...] "Za mnogu godini"). Among the most celebrated name-days in Macedonia are St. Stefan (January 9), Epiphany (January 19), St. John (January 20), Blagovec (April 7), St. George (May 6), Ss. Cyril and Methodius (May 24), St. Kostadin and Elena (June 3), St. Peter (July 12), St. Paul (July 12), and St. Dimitar (November 8).|$|R
