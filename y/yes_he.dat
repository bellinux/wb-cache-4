25|$|He {{then joined}} the Eastern Association {{under the command}} of the Earl of Manchester as a {{volunteer}} at the siege of Lincoln, and on 7 October 1643 he was commissioned as a major in Colonel King's regiment of foot. On 16 May 1644 he was transferred to Manchester's own dragoons with the rank of lieutenant-colonel. He became friends with Oliver Cromwell, who was second in command, supporting him in his disputes with Manchester. He fought with distinction at the Battle of Marston Moor in 1644. Shortly afterwards he asked permission to attack the Royalist stronghold at Tickhill Castle, because he had heard it was willing to surrender. Manchester refused, dismissing him as a madman. Taking that as a <b>yes,</b> <b>he</b> went and took the Castle without a shot being fired.|$|E
25|$|But {{perhaps my}} finest memory of this lordly Frenchman came in 1966 at the Nürburgring, where a German {{official}} had been particularly rude {{to myself and}} other English journalists about going through one gate (the exit) to the press room instead of another 100 yards away (the entrance). We sat in delight, Sid Saltmarsh, Bill Long and me, not 20 yards from that 'Exit' gate, and watched as Jacques pulled up in his Ford Mustang, and proceeded to unload his bike {{from the back of}} the car. <b>Yes,</b> <b>he</b> did, not leaving it to mechanics. German official railed and cried, but all in vain. The seigniorial aspect came out oh so clearly, and Jacques did not merely ignore him, it was palpably as if the German did not exist at all. He left the car there, walked over to the riders' quarters pushing the gate open and the German with it. It has probably the finest comeuppance I shall ever see, and for that I shall remember Jacques for a long time.|$|E

500|$|Shabazz {{began to}} accept {{speaking}} engagements at colleges and universities. She often {{spoke about the}} black nationalist philosophy of MalcolmX, but she also spoke about {{her role as a}} wife and mother. Shabazz felt that some of the images of her husband projected by the media were misrepresentations. [...] "They attempted to promote him as a violent person, a hater of whites," [...] she explained. [...] "He was a sensitive man, a very understanding person and <b>yes,</b> <b>he</b> disliked the behavior of some whites.... He had a reality-based agenda." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{hippopotamus}} {{was also}} {{known to the}} Greeks and Romans. The Greek historian Herodotus described the hippopotamus in The Histories (written circa 440 BC) and the Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder wrote about the hippopotamus in his encyclopedia Naturalis Historia (written circa 77 AD). The Yoruba people called the hippopotamus erinmi which means [...] "elephant of the water". Zulu warriors preferred to be as brave as a hippopotamus, since even lions were not considered to match its courage. They would chant their chief: [...] "Een-gonyama Gonyama! Invooboo! Yah-bo! Yah-bo! Invooboo!" [...] which translates as [...] "He is a lion. <b>Yes,</b> <b>he</b> {{is better than a}} lion – he is a hippopotamus." ...|$|E
500|$|Jacques Parizeau, {{who had not}} {{prepared}} a concession speech, rejected one prepared by Jean-François Lisée and spoke without notes. Noting that 60% of French-speakers had voted <b>yes,</b> <b>he</b> stated that he would address French-speaking Québécois as [...] ("we"), {{and that they had}} spoken clearly in favour of the [...] "Yes." [...] He then stated that the only thing that had stopped the [...] "Yes" [...] side was [...] "money and ethnic votes" [...] and that the next referendum would be successful with only a few percentage more of French speakers onside. The remarks, widely lambasted in the Canadian and international press as ethnocentric, sparked surprise and anger in the [...] "Yes" [...] camp, as the movement had {{gone to great lengths to}} disown ethnic nationalism.|$|E

500|$|Later in 1957, Cagney ventured {{behind the}} camera {{for the first and}} only time to direct Short Cut to Hell, a remake of the 1941 Alan Ladd film This Gun for Hire, which in turn was based on the Graham Greene novel A Gun for Sale. Cagney had long been told by friends that he would make an {{excellent}} director, so when he was approached by his friend, producer A. C. Lyles, he instinctively said <b>yes.</b> <b>He</b> refused all offers of payment, saying he was an actor, not a director. The film was low budget, and shot quickly. As Cagney recalled, [...] "We shot it in twenty days, and that was long enough for me. I find directing a bore, I have no desire to tell other people their business".|$|E
500|$|... "Lovers in Japan" [...] {{received}} high commendations from critics. Alexis Petridis of The Guardian {{review of}} the album, wrote: [...] "Chris Martin's melodies... shine: even his loudest detractor could hardly deny his way with a tune as evidenced here by '42' and 'Lovers in Japan'." [...] Evan Sawdey of PopMatters remarked that the song is [...] "stunning, jaw-dropping highlight". He added that [...] "Martin pounds away at a bouncy toy-piano melody... leading into a chorus where guitarist Jonny Buckland gets to unleash {{what might be the}} catchiest guitar riff he's written... (and <b>yes,</b> <b>he</b> absolutely bathes in the moment)." [...] Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle described [...] "Lovers in Japan" [...] as a [...] "joyous, romantic anthem that combines wistful rock riffs and gorgeous piano". He also wrote that the song is one of [...] "the disc's best moments".|$|E
500|$|James Whale {{lived as}} an openly gay man {{throughout}} {{his career in the}} British theatre and in Hollywood, something that was virtually unheard of in the 1920s and 1930s. He and David Lewis lived together as a couple from around 1930 to 1952. While he did not go {{out of his way to}} publicize his homosexuality, he did not do anything to conceal it either. As filmmaker Curtis Harrington, a friend and confidant of Whale's, put it, [...] "Not in the sense of screaming it from the rooftops or coming out. But <b>yes,</b> <b>he</b> was openly homosexual. Any sophisticated person who knew him knew he was gay." [...] While there have been suggestions that Whale's career was terminated because of homophobia, and Whale was supposedly dubbed [...] "The Queen of Hollywood", Harrington states that [...] "nobody made a thing out of it as far as I could perceive".|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>yes!</b> <b>he's</b> in {{the room}} somewhere. There he is, {{standing}} up by Lady Clandidlem. He always stands in that way before dinner. In the evening he sits down much after the same fashion." ...|$|R

500|$|Reaction to the antagonist's {{death was}} mixed. [...] Kristin Dos Santos of E! criticized the writing for Keamy when he futilely asks Sayid where his fellow 815 {{survivors}} are {{so that he}} can kill them, but enjoyed his attractive physique, writing that [...] "that guy is deep-fried evil, and he must die horribly for what he did to Alex, but in the meantime, well, he's certainly a well-muscled young man". [...] The Huffington Post's Jay Glatfelter also called for Keamy's death, stating that [...] "nothing would be better to me than him getting run over by Hurley's Dharma Bus", alluding to a scene in the third-season finale. [...] Dan Compora of SyFy Portal commented that [...] "Keamy took a bit too long to die. [...] <b>Yes,</b> <b>he</b> was wearing a bulletproof vest so it wasn't totally unexpected, but it was a bit predictable." [...] In a review of the season finale, Erin Martell of AOL's TV Squad declared her disappointment in the conclusion of Keamy's arc, stating that [...] "it's always a shame when the hot guys die, [...] Kevin Durand did an amazing job with the character … he'll be missed." [...] In a later article titled [...] "Lost Season Four Highlights", Martell noted Durand's [...] "strong performance" [...] that was [...] "particularly fun to watch" [...] and wrote that [...] "we [...] all know that Widmore's the big bad, but Keamy became the face of evil on the island in his stead." ...|$|E
500|$|In The Spectator, Jonathan Sumption {{praised the}} book, writing [...] "The public {{hysteria}} surrounding such high-profile incidents {{as the death}} of the Princess of Wales and the search for Madeleine McCann, or the eccentricities of the MacPherson report on the death of Stephen Lawrence are analysed with the author's customary mixture of shrewdness, cynicism and misanthropic pessimism. These phenomena have of course been analysed before, and many of the same points have been made. But Dalrymple is good at relating them to broader trends in our society". [...] The book was described by Toby Young in The Daily Telegraph as being an [...] "excellent new book attacking the cult of sentimentality" [...] and that Dalrymple also [...] "makes a convincing case that standards in British education have plummeted in the last few decades". Young also reviewed the book on his blog No Sacred Cows, where he wrote, [...] "...the remarkable thing about Spoilt Rotten is that Dalrymple never lets his anger obscure his compassion. Throughout the book you get a powerful sense that his outrage is rooted in a commitment to social justice. <b>Yes,</b> <b>he</b> believes members of the underclass should be weaned off the nanny state and forced to take responsibility for themselves, but he also believes it is left-wing intellectuals who have reduced them to a state of helpless infantalism, mainly through the promotion of the cult of sentimentality. He is not a Christian, but believes that it is only when Britain's benefit dependents rediscover the doctrine of Original Sin {{that they will be able}} to help themselves".|$|E
2500|$|In early 1995, the Brewers asked Givens to be a {{replacement}} player. [...] Although {{he did not}} originally say <b>yes,</b> <b>he</b> wound up doing so {{to help pay for}} a mortgage debt.

6000|$|... "Why hasn't he {{got that}} big fisherman's {{staysail}} on her?" [...] she demanded irritably. [...] "It would make the old girl just walk along in this breeze.

2500|$|When David Cameron {{was asked}} in 2009 {{whether or not}} {{he would be willing to}} sack a close {{colleague}} such as Osborne, he stated, [...] "With George, the answer is <b>yes.</b> <b>He</b> stayed in my shadow cabinet not because he is a friend, not because we are godfathers to each other's children but because he is the right person to do the job.

[...] "Well, I believe that Keres failed {{in this respect}} because he lacked the killer instinct. He was too mild a person to give his all in order to defeat his opponents. He took everything, including his chess, philosophically. Keres {{is one of the}} nicest people that I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. With his friendly and sincere smile, he makes friends easily. He is goodnatured and kind. <b>Yes,</b> <b>he</b> loves chess, but being a human being is his first consideration. In addition to chess, Keres was interested in tennis, Ping-Pong, swimming, and bridge." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ghomeshi {{was charged}} by police on {{multiple}} counts {{of sexual assault}} but {{was found not guilty}} of all but one of these in March 2016. He was to be tried in June on the last remaining charge, relating to a complainant who had also worked at CBC; her name was later revealed to be Kathryn Borel. On May 11, 2016 however, the Crown withdrew the charge after Ghomeshi signed a peace bond (which does not include an admission of guilt) and apologized to Borel. Borel was critical of the CBC for its handling of her initial complaint about Ghomeshi's behavior.
