25|$|The {{mark of a}} great cabinetmaker is his {{combination}} of design and execution. It's how well they resolve the challenges of designing a piece coupled with their craftsmanship and technique. Pabst was the most distinguished cabinetmaker in Philadelphia {{in the last quarter}} of the 19th century. Clearly, the quality of his carving and cabinetmaking is of the highest order, and Philadelphia has a tradition of producing superior furniture since the 18th century, overshadowing Boston and New York.Daniel Pabst really did develop a unique and identifiable decorative vocabulary. He tended to envelop the object's architecture with a fine scale pattern; it was an invention of his own. He wasn't aping the European antecedent. While I think there are masterpieces of Pabst's not from Furness's pen, he certainly benefitted from his close association with the architect.Pabst's Modern Gothic work presents the very germ of the modern movement. Like Christopher Dresser and Bruce Talbert, he conventionalized design, departing from the realistic motifs of the mid-19th century. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>where</b> this reductivity evolves into the Craftsman style.— Andrew Van Styn, furniture scholar & dealer.|$|E

Apparently, in every town and city in India the gentlemen of the British civil and military service have a club; sometimes it is a palatial one, always it is pleasant and homelike. The hotels are not always as good as they might be, and the stranger who has access to the Club is grateful for his privilege and knows how to value it.|$|E

'My father, as you mid know, was a {{shepherd}} all his life, and lived {{out by the}} Cove four miles yonder, where I was born and lived likewise, till I moved here shortly afore I was married. The cottage that first knew me stood {{on the top of}} the down, near the sea; there was no house within a mile and a half of it; it was built o' purpose for the farm-shepherd, and had no other use. They tell me that it is now pulled down, but that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>where</b> it stood by the mounds of earth and a few broken bricks that are still lying about. It was a bleak and dreary place in winter- time, but in summer it was well enough, though the garden never came to much, because we could not get up a good shelter for the vegetables and currant bushes; and where there is much wind they don't thrive.|$|E

60|$|Look now, my father! There on {{the plain}} far away {{is a place of}} the white men--it is called Stanger. There, where is the white man's town, stood the great kraal Duguza. I cannot see, for my eyes are dark; but <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see.</b> <b>Where</b> the gate of the kraal was built there is a house; it is the place where the white man gives out justice; that is the place of the gate of the kraal, through which Justice never walked. Behind is another house, where the white men who have sinned against Him pray to the King of Heaven for forgiveness; there on that spot have I seen many a one who had done no wrong pray to a king of men for mercy, but I have never seen but one who found it. Ou! the words of Chaka have come true: I will tell them to you presently, my father. The white man holds the land, he goes to and fro about his {{business}} of peace where impis ran forth to kill; his children laugh and gather flowers where men died in blood by hundreds; they bathe in the waters of the Imbozamo, where once the crocodiles were fed daily with human flesh; his young men woo the maidens where other maids have kissed the assegai. It is changed, nothing is the same, and of Chaka are left only a grave yonder and a name of fear.|$|E

5000|$|Reviews of {{the film}} have been average. Najib Zulfikar of Total Film gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, stating, [...] "Miike amps it all up to 11 in his inimitable style, as impossibly coiffured pretty boys duke it out and the Yakuza take an {{interest}} in the outcome. Sadly, the story’s so overpopulated it’s hard to care who’ll survive to graduate." [...] Similarly, David Brook of Blueprint Review gave the film 2.5 out of 5 stars indicating, [...] "Teenage boys will lap up every minute of it (other than the songs which probably won’t appeal to many Westerners) and the lack of obviously ‘bad’ and ‘good’ guys means the conclusion wasn’t always going to be clear cut (after an hour or so <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>where</b> its heading though)." ...|$|E

On the westernmost end of the McKees Rocks yard, the P&LE interchanged with the PC&Y. However the PC&Y facilities are just behind the P&LE Locomotive facilities in the main yard, and trackage from the PC&Y crosses the P&LE Mainline at this point, servicing several local businesses in the Bottoms section of McKees Rocks, finally making the previously mentioned interchange. Most of the McKees Rocks facilities are still in place being used by various Freight Car rebuilding companies.

5000|$|By the 1990s, Prangenberg {{was also}} working with sculpture. Annegret Laabs, writing in 2008 in the artist's monograph, [...] "Norbert Prangenberg: Venustas et Fortuna," [...] explained: “Up to the mid-1990s, {{the focus of}} his ceramic works was {{to be found in}} large, bulbous, hollow forms, usually lying on their side, which were {{characterized}} by the independent movement of the glass flux that surrounds the terracotta when it is fired, and which ultimately merges light and darkness, the visible and the imaginary, or, indeed, keeps them apart.” However, after the mid-1990s, Pragnenberg rotates these large scale, monumental sculptures so that they are standing, mimicking a standing human body. Yet, they maintain the same spontaneous, playful, organic nature of the ones resting on their sides. His sculptures also show an interest in materiality; in certain parts of the clay forms <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>where</b> his fingerprints have affected the surface by way of holes, notches, and incisions.|$|E

5000|$|Friendship books (also {{known as}} [...] "FBs" [...] in their {{abbreviated}} form) are small booklets made by stapling paper together, or are sometimes just sheets or strips of paper. They are usually decorated {{and the person}} who starts the book writes their name and address as the first person sending the book. People often include a list of interests as well. The FB is then passed around from penpal to penpal, and can often also become a way for one to meet new penpals. Most people hope to see the book again once it is full so they add their return address to the back cover of the book too, or inscribe [...] "Return to Sender" [...] on it. People also sometimes make FBs for someone else rather than themselves, in which case they write the name and address of the recipient on the front/at the top.

5000|$|Locating or {{positioning}} touches upon delicate privacy issues, {{since it}} enables someone to check {{where a person}} is without the person's consent. Strict ethics and security measures are strongly recommended for services that employ positioning.In 2012 Malte Spitz held a TED talk {{on the issue of}} mobile phone privacy in which he showcased his own stored data that he received from Deutsche Telekom after suing the company. He described the data, which consists of 35,830 lines of data collected during the span of Germany's data retention at the time, saying, [...] "This is six months of my life ... <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>where</b> I am, when I sleep at night, what I'm doing."

5000|$|The beatification of Father Serra and {{decision}} to name two new parishes {{in his honor}} led to controversy over Father Serra's treatment of native Americans at the California missions. California Indian leaders criticized the move and asserted that Father Serra {{played a part in}} the destruction of a rich civilization. [...] The controversy was further sparked when Msgr. Francis J. Weber, then director of the San Fernando Mission, was interviewed by the Los Angeles Times and rejected the notion that the Indian population had a rich civilization: [...] "They were on par with what we studied in school as the Stone Age. Now if you think that's a good era to be in, then <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>where</b> you would end up in this ongoing controversy of did we destroy their civilization. In my opinion, they didn't have any civilization to destroy." [...] Weber also dismissed charges that Serra's missions imparted unduly harsh physical discipline, including whippings, on the Indians. Weber noted that [...] "spanked" [...] was a more accurate word: [...] "In Europe of the time, a father spanked his children." [...] A CSUN archeologist responded that the California Indians [...] "had a complex economy, stable villages and elaborate systems of belief in art and religion", and asserted that Weber's comments were [...] "an heir to the kind of thinking that let European societies eradicate whole cultures." ...|$|E
5000|$|Westbridge was a {{railroad}} station {{located on the}} Main Line of the Long Island Rail Road. It was located on the main line south of Jamaica Avenue. The station opened {{as a pair of}} sheltered sheds on June 28, 1916 and a ticket office at street level. The station's original name was High Bridge. Westbridge was out of service on January 1, 1939 and was discontinued as a station stop. However, Westbridge last appeared in an employee timetable on September 18, 1938. In 1916 there was a complaint by the Westbridge Civic Association to have one train in each direction to stop at Westbridge as they do at Forest Hills and Kew Gardens.There are still remnants of this station; at the south end crossing of Jamaica Avenue <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>where</b> the platforms used to be, the concrete footstones are still there and can be seen along the westbound side. Westbridge used to operate as a freight station after its closing. There is currently some old wood which lays alongside {{the outer edge of the}} roadbed which is most likely from the Wooden shelter that used to be on the platform. Some current maps and atlases still have Westbridge listed as a freight only station to this day; quite to the contrary that freight is no longer used here. While this station was open, one could see BMT trains on the BMT Jamaica Line overhead from the main line tracks when the trains ran to 168th Street.|$|E
50|$|This {{landslide}} {{is roughly}} half a kilometer in width, and 1.5 kilometers long. The {{depth of the}} landslide is approximately 100 meters. The velocity of the landslide varies, but the fastest moving part is at the toe, which moves upwards of 10 meters annually. There {{is a lack of}} vegetation on the toe of the landslide because it is over steepened and constantly sliding, providing no stable area for trees to grow. The trees that are growing on the sides and front of the landslide are tilted and disturbed due to the constant motion of the land. However, there is a section of trees {{in the middle of the}} slide that are not disturbed and seem to be moving as a connected unit riding on top of the sliding ground. At the head of the landslide, there is pronounced scarping, and on the sides of the slide, there is transform faulting. At about the middle of the slide <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>where,</b> just above the topples of the slide, the trees are moving in motion with the landslide. The soil under the trees is compact; however, just away from the outside of the root ball you can see cracks, which is an indicator of how fast this landslide is moving. If this landslide was moving slowly the rain fall would move this soft sediment into the cracks and fill them. We visited this site the morning after rainfall and the cracks were pronounced up to 1 cm in width.The main ingredient in this landslide is Serpentinite,which is formed from serpentinization, a hydration and metamorphic transformation of ultramafic rock from the Earth's mantle. The asbestos mineral that forms from this serpentinite is chrysotile.The possible reason why there was conglomerate bedrock underneath the serpentinite could be because of the glacial till or delta deposits flowing out of the Cascade mountain range as it was forming millions of years ago. After this or while this was all happening, the North American plate and the Pacific Plate were colliding causing uplift that eventually formed Sumas Mountain. As the weathering of this place was happening, the landslide started to slip away from the face of the mountain to its current position. About the time that all this was happening, 45 mya, the Chuckanut Formation was ceasing to gain deposits and the volcanic activity known as the North Cascades was in its youth. This area was also heavily affected by the Pleistocene Glaciation. Loose unconsolidated sediment is piled on top of the Chuckanut Formation and is causing a very unstable environment.|$|E
