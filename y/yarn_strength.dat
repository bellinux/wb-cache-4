40|$|Abstract. Fabric {{materials}} {{can be in}} form of woven, knitted, non-woven and braided structures {{or a combination of}} these structures can be used for protective fabric. Properties of fabrics depend on the different types of fibres that constitute the fabric and the geometry of the final structure. This project seeks the development of optimally woven enhanced silk fabric for high performance application that can be potentially beneficial to various engineering fields such as ballistic protection for military, aerospace, automotive, sports and marine engineering industries. Natural enhanced silk will be used as the yarns, rather than the traditionally used synthetically produced aramid material which poses an environmental problem. The tensile strength, tensile modulus and elongation of <b>yarns</b> <b>strength</b> are the main influences on ballistic performance. In addition to the tensile properties of the yarn, fabric weave structure is crucial as propagation of stress waves is affected by the weave structure. Mechanical performance of the woven silk fabric of various designs will be subsequently accessed for their effectiveness based on tensile testing and ballistic testing...|$|R

50|$|The {{amount of}} twist in a yarn helps {{to define the}} style of yarn- a yarn {{with a lot of}} air such as a woollen yarn will have much less twist than a yarn with little air, like a worsted yarn. It also affects the stretchiness of the <b>yarn,</b> <b>{{strength}},</b> the halo of the yarn, and many other attributes. Filling or weft yarns usually have fewer twists per inch because strength is not as important as with warp yarns, and highly twisted yarns are, in general, stronger. Warp yarns have to be stronger so that they can withstand the tension of the loom. Filament fibers, such as silk, or many synthetics, need only to be twisted slightly to create a yarn.|$|E

40|$|Nanofiber yarns are {{important}} {{building blocks for}} making three-dimensional nanostructures, e. g. through a knitting or weaving process, with better mechanical properties than nanofiber nonwovens and well-controlled fibrous construction. However, it still remains challenging to produce quality nanofiber yarns in a sufficient rate. In this study, we have proven that online stretching during electrospinning of nanofiber yarns can considerably improve fiber alignment and molecular orientation within the yarn and increase <b>yarn</b> tensile <b>strength,</b> but reduce fiber/yarn diameters. By compensating twist during online stretching, the device can prepare nanofiber yarns with different stretch levels, but maintaining the same twist multiplier. This allows us to {{examine the effect of}} stretching on fiber and yarn morphology. It was interesting to find that on increasing the stretching ratio from 0 % to 95 %, the yarn diameter reduced from 135. 1 ± 20. 3 μm to 46. 2 ± 10. 2 μm, and the fiber diameter reduced from 998 ± 141 nm to 631 ± 98 nm, whereas the <b>yarn</b> tensile <b>strength</b> increased from 48. 2 ± 5. 6 MPa to 127. 7 ± 5. 4 MPa.

30|$|Yarn quality {{properties}} can {{be predicted}} by modelling selected {{inputs and outputs}} of the cotton spinning system. This approach is widely applied {{in the study of}} the fiber to yarn process, where yarn properties can be predicted using mathematical, statistical and artificial neural network (ANN) models just to mention a few. A study of the comparison of ANN and other models (mathematical and statistical) has also been undertaken, and reports indicated that the ANN models have comparatively higher prediction efficiency (Guha et al. 2001; Ureyen and Gurkan 2008 a, b; Majumdar and Majumdar 2004). The efficiency of the ANN algorithms has enabled the design of yarn quality prediction models, which can be used in the spinning industry (Furferi and Gelli 2010). The increasing use of the ANN models in the textiles industry warrants more attention to ensure that necessary improvements are made. This is expected to improve the cotton spinning process. It is with the afore-mentioned reasons that the objectives of studying the improvement of the ANN models used in the prediction of cotton <b>yarn</b> tensile <b>strength</b> (strength) were envisioned. This was done by comparing the working of Backpropagation (BP) models with the Extreme Learning Machines (ELM) algorithm during the prediction of <b>yarn</b> tensile <b>strength.</b> Further improvement of the ELM algorithms was undertaken to produce more efficient prediction models made from a hybrid of differential evolution (DE) and ELM algorithms christened DE-ELM algorithm.|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} ageing {{as a result}} of {{extended}} warehouse storage of baled cotton on fiber pro-cessing characteristics have not been extensively investigated. This study attempts to address this issue by characterizing some of the chemical and physical factors of the cotton fiber both before and after storage for 2 years, and by comparing any changes that occur with changes observed in yarn processing and resultant yarn quality. Results indicate that subsequent to storage, sugar content and moisture content both experience significant changes. Conductivity, pH, and wax content did not exhibit any statistically significant changes. Of the physical factors measured by HVI (micronaire, length, strength, uniformity, Rd, and +b), only +b exhibited a significant change. The changes in chemical components did not appear {{to have an impact on}} processing performance as inferred from the fact that fiber friction and yarn unifor-mity were not affected. Quality measurements on the resultant yarn, however, indicate a significant reduction in <b>yarn</b> <b>strength.</b> The primary conclu-sions from these results are that cotton aged for 2 years causes a detrimental effect on cotton quality because of the change in color grade, while a nega-tive impact on yarn quality is seen {{as a result of}} decreased <b>yarn</b> <b>strength.</b> Possible causes for this observed decrease in <b>yarn</b> <b>strength</b> are discussed in terms of the measured chemical variables.

40|$|Fibre {{damage caused}} by the weaving of {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) fabric preforms for advanced composite materials is investigated. A Jacquard loom was used to weave continuous fibreglass yarns into a 3 D orthogonal woven fabric.

40|$|Technical {{textiles}} play {{a highly}} {{important role in}} today's material engineering. In fibrous composites, which are being applied {{in a number of}} industrial branches ranging from aviation to civil engineering, technical textiles are used as the reinforcing or toughening constituent. With growing number of production facilities for fibrous materials, the need for standardized and reproducible quality control procedures becomes urgent. The present thesis addresses the issue of tensile strength of high-modulus multifilament yarns both from the theoretical and experimental point of view. In both these aspects, novel approaches are introduced. Regarding the theoretical <b>strength</b> of fibrous <b>yarns,</b> a model for the length dependent tensile strength is formulated, which distinguishes three asymptotes of the mean strength size effect curve. The transition between the model of independent parallel fibers applicable for smaller gauge lengths and the chain-of-bundles model applicable for longer gauge lengths is emphasized in particular. It is found that the transition depends on the stress transfer or anchorage length of filaments and can be identified experimentally by means of standard tensile tests at different gauge lengths. In the experimental part of the thesis, the issue of stress concentration in the clamping has been addressed. High-modulus yarns with brittle filaments are very sensitive to stress concentrations when loaded in tension making the use of traditional tensile test methods difficult. A novel clamp adapter for the Statimat 4 U yarn tensile test machine (producer: Textechno GmbH) has been developed and a prototype has been built. A test series comparing <b>yarns</b> <b>strengths</b> tested with the clamp adapter and with commonly used test methods has been performed and the results are discussed.
