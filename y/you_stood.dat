The Queen duly had Karim remain at Windsor, then when the party had settled into the Excelsior Regina hotel, wired Karim to come and join them.|$|E

[...] Tal Smith, Astros' president of baseball operations, said of Benjamin, [...] "Stan's positive evaluation of Bagwell was definitely a catalyst in our taking him... He was a vital cog in our organization who had the ability to convey his opinion in a precise manner. You always knew where <b>you</b> <b>stood</b> with him. [...] He was a longtime employee, but more important, a longtime friend. [...] Smith also called him a [...] "keen judge of talent." ...|$|E
500|$|Speaking to The Times {{about the}} ending of the show in 1989, Curtis hinted that the {{collaborative}} writing process caused tensions amongst the cast: [...] "Everybody on the show thinks they can put in good jokes, despite the fact that Ben Elton and I think there are already quite a few good ones in there to start with. It does usually end up funnier, but it's time to do something over which I have more control." [...] Twenty years on, Curtis recalled in the documentary Blackadder Rides Again that: [...] "They would literally sit around for the entire time discussing the script...sometimes we would just say to them [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>stood</b> up and tried to act this script out, you would find out things about it." [...] Ben Elton stated that by opening it up, they allowed the cast to question every aspect of the script.|$|E

2500|$|A Baraita deduced {{from the}} words [...] "you shall make them known to your children, and your children's children" [...] in [...] {{that if a}} parent teaches a child Torah, Scripture ascribes merit as though the parent had taught the child, the child's children, and so on, {{until the end of}} all time. Rabbi Joshua ben Levi taught that if a parent teaches a child (or some say a grandchild) Torah, Scripture {{accounts}} it as if the parent had received the Torah at Mount Sinai, as [...] says, [...] "And you shall make them known to your children and your children's children," [...] and immediately thereafter, [...] says, [...] "The day that <b>you</b> <b>stood</b> before the Lord your God in Horeb." [...] Rabbi Hiyya bar Abba once found Rabbi Joshua ben Levi, who had hurriedly thrown a cloth upon his head, taking his child (or some say grandchild) to the synagogue to study. When Rabbi Hiyya asked Rabbi Joshua what was going on, Rabbi Joshua replied that it was no small thing that the words [...] "you shall make them known to your children and your children's children" [...] are immediately followed by the words [...] "The day that <b>you</b> <b>stood</b> before the Lord your God in Horeb." [...] From then on, Rabbi Hiyya bar Abba did not eat breakfast before revising the previous day's lesson with his child (or some say grandchild) and adding another verse. And Rabbah son of Rav Huna did not eat breakfast until he took his child (or some say grandchild) to school.|$|E

The issue was considered settled after a meeting between Sierra, the ACLU, Sierra's mother and Mann, until {{a meeting of the}} school's board of education on October 29, the day of Sierra's return to school. The meeting discussed the events of the previous week, and some board members were initially sympathetic to Sierra. However, comments turned hostile {{towards the end of the}} meeting, with Sierra being told [...] "his isn't something funny or cute…ou're talking about overthrowing the government", and having her actions characterized as [...] "like <b>you</b> <b>stood</b> up and waved a Japanese flag on Pearl Harbor day". In reference to Sierra, president of the board Bill Raglin asked [...] "hat the hell is wrong with a kid like that?" [...] and board member John Luoni accused Sierra of committing treason. Sierra fled the meeting in tears. The following day, The Charleston Gazette published comments by Mann to the effect that the messages on Sierra's T-shirts included [...] "I hope Afghanistan wins" [...] and [...] "America should burn."; Mann later claimed he had been misquoted, and that he had taken his information from Jacob Reed. Students spat on Sierra's mother's car at Sissonville High, and her friends' parents wouldn't give her rides home from school. Threats, taunting, jeering by her fellow students escalated into physical assaults, and Sierra's mother pulled her out of school; the threats would ultimately cause Sierra to move out of the town. Sierra voiced her belief that people at Sissonville High were permitted to talk about how they felt about certain things, so long as there were others who agreed with them. She denied being anti-American, and that anarchism implies support for terrorism, countering that it is an anti-authoritarian and non-violent philosophy.|$|E
