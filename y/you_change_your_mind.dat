60|$|FRANK. I also shall remain {{permanently}} single until <b>you</b> <b>change</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind.</b> Praddy: {{change the}} subject. Be eloquent about something else.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Wayne, if {{your word}} is not involved--will <b>you</b> <b>change</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> and pitch tomorrow's game for us instead of Bellville?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sir, your Honour {{ought to}} know what might make <b>you</b> <b>change</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind.</b> There have been {{passages}} between Mr. Archfield and me." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Education as {{stretching}} the mind", for the 2008 question: [...] "What Have <b>You</b> <b>Changed</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Mind</b> About?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... 2008: [...] "What have <b>you</b> <b>changed</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> about?" [...] The {{corresponding}} {{book came}} out shortly thereafter.|$|R
6000|$|... "Have <b>you</b> <b>changed</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind?</b> Or are <b>you</b> in {{the same}} mind?" [...] Mr. Tulkinghorn demands. But he knows well enough at a glance.|$|R
6000|$|... 'If <b>you</b> <b>change</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> at any time,' {{returned}} Eugene, 'come {{to me at}} my works, and you'll {{always find}} {{an opening in the}} lime-kiln.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This miser'ble ol' umbrel is too pertic'ler," [...] growled Cap'n Bill. [...] "It won't let <b>you</b> <b>change</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> an' it goes ezzac'ly {{where you}} say." ...|$|E
6000|$|As we rode off Rube shouted out, 'If <b>you</b> <b>change</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> {{again about}} {{coming with me}} to Missouri, you just drop me a line, Pepita.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{subject of}} Wesson doesn't inspire me somehow--I don't know why. Besides, you've simply {{got to say}} <b>you</b> <b>changed</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind.</b> You're a woman. It's {{expected}} of you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Really, you two {{might be}} conspirators," [...] he said lightly. [...] "Well, Mr. Morton, have <b>you</b> <b>changed</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind,</b> or am I {{to have the}} honour of your company this evening?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{figured we}} needn't trail quite so much grub along, and I guess you'll want it," [...] a voice said. [...] "Neither of <b>you</b> <b>changed</b> <b>your</b> <b>minds</b> 'bout {{lighting}} out of this?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Reashaw {{took the}} letter hastily. It {{contained}} only {{a line in}} Sleight's hand. [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>change</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind,</b> the bearer may be of service to you." ...|$|E
60|$|EVE. That is {{just what}} I feel; {{but it is very}} strange that you should say so: there is no {{pleasing}} you. <b>You</b> <b>change</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> so often.|$|E
6000|$|... “It is {{not usually}} advisable,” said Appleby with a smile. “Still, if <b>you</b> <b>change</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> about the caña {{you can come up}} to the hacienda and ask for me.” ...|$|E
6000|$|He blushed all over, but {{carried it}} off as boldly as he could. [...] "Well, well," [...] he said, [...] "that's right! If <b>you</b> <b>change</b> <b>your</b> <b>minds</b> before the Aroostook sails, you let me know." ...|$|R
6000|$|At {{the end of}} a {{year the}} king took his son aside, and said: [...] "Well, my son, have <b>you</b> <b>changed</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> on the subject of marriage, or do you still refuse to obey my wish?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{not sure}} that I shall tell you everything," [...] she decided. [...] "You have not opened your mouth to me yet. I shall wait until supper-time. Have <b>you</b> <b>changed</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> since I went away?" ...|$|R
6000|$|LADY CICELY. Dear me! That must be {{very nice}} for the people you deal with, because they can always depend on you; but isn't it rather {{inconvenient}} for yourself when <b>you</b> <b>change</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind?</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Built on sand," [...] {{answered}} Jolyon, {{pressing her}} hand hard; [...] "but it's {{a pleasure to}} do anything, at any time, remember that. And if <b>you</b> <b>change</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind...!</b> Come along, June; say good-bye." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{you want}} to get out into the world? Ah, you have youth." [...] He hesitated a moment. [...] "I want you to {{remember}} that if <b>you</b> <b>change</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> my offer still stands." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know <b>you</b> <b>changed</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind.</b> Men often do. A pinker pink, a whiter white,--a finger {{that will}} press you just half an ounce the closer,--a cheek that will consent to let itself come {{just a little}} nearer--!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh dear, no!" [...] {{she said}} in the same voice, but {{clearing}} her throat with a little cough. [...] "And why didn't you see this Mr. Horseley after all? Oh, I forgot!--you said <b>you</b> <b>changed</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> from something you'd heard." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't {{understand}} you,' said Erskine, {{looking at}} me in amazement. 'Why, you yourself have convinced me by your letter that Willie Hughes is an absolute reality. Why have <b>you</b> <b>changed</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind?</b> Or is all {{that you have been}} saying to me merely a joke?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Won't let <b>you</b> <b>change</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind,</b> eh?" [...] replied Cap'n Bill. [...] "Well, {{that has}} its advantidges, an' its disadvantiges. If your ol' umbrel hadn't been so obstinate, we could have saved that boat." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Until <b>you</b> <b>change</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind,</b> {{or one of}} us is dead. If you {{get tired}} of it in the meanwhile, you can always go back to the Old Country for a few months or so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, well--well! lovers, they say, {{should never}} despair. A little consideration, {{and a little}} talk with my dear girl--really now, won't <b>you</b> <b>change</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> and {{have a glass of}} sherry? (No again?) Very well, then, the day after tomorrow, at five o'clock." ...|$|E
60|$|I don't think she's entirely {{given up}} hope that <b>you</b> will <b>change</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "From {{the story}} you sent us," [...] Rice answered. [...] "At first you wrote on the title-page Douglas Guest as the author. Then {{apparently}} <b>you</b> <b>changed</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind,</b> crossed it out, and substituted Douglas Jesson, which we took to be a nom-de-plume, especially as you gave us for your address initials to a post-office." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was not in}} the dark. I put out {{my light}} when I caught sight of you, knowing that {{otherwise}} you would run away, and fate stood me in good stead. You came on, as I willed that you should do. Now let us talk. Miss Clifford, have <b>you</b> <b>changed</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind?</b> <b>You</b> know the time is up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] Littleson said, [...] "I {{have warned}} you. You are a crank, and a foolish one at that. You are going about asking for trouble, and I {{think you will}} find it. If <b>you</b> <b>change</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind,</b> come to me at Claridge's." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never mind," [...] she said, [...] "I {{have warned}} you. It {{is for you}} to act as you think best. If <b>you</b> <b>change</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind,</b> come to me. I will give you {{sanctuary}} at any time. Take me to my automobile, please." ...|$|E
6000|$|At parting Le Chapelier again exhorted {{him to give}} {{thought to}} what he proposed. [...] "Send me word if <b>you</b> <b>change</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind.</b> I am lodged at the Cerf, and I shall be here until the day after to-morrow. If you have ambition, this is your moment." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So you {{contrived}} {{to throw}} over your stupid business and join us, after all," [...] she said; [...] "or {{was it that}} <b>you</b> <b>changed</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> at the last moment?" [...] she added mischievously. [...] "I thought only we women were permitted that!" [...] Indeed, she could not help noticing that there was really a strong feminine suggestion in the shifting color and slightly conscious eyelids of the young fellow.|$|R
6000|$|... "'It's a darned shame, stranger," [...] she said, at parting. 'I {{like your}} looks, and I like you. If <b>you</b> ever <b>change</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind,</b> come back.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{good will}} that do me," [...] she asked, [...] "if <b>you</b> don't <b>change</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind?</b> <b>You</b> won't <b>change</b> it if <b>you</b> shut {{your eyes to}} her." ...|$|R
