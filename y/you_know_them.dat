Rockman told NME: [...] "We were hoping to explain [...] to them and that maybe we'd come out of it friends, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>them</b> {{producing}} our album and us producing theirs—the kind of thing that often happens at these meetings." [...] King Boy: [...] "Yeah, we'd have said, 'Look, you haven't had many hits lately, you don't really wanna bother with all this West End musical shit do you? Come and do the new JAMMS [...] album.'" [...] In 1994, The Guardian looked back on the Swedish sojourn as [...] "a grand, futile, attention-grabbing gesture, the kind that would come to characterise [...] collaborative career... "We were being totally stupid about it" [...] Drummond later acknowledged." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{most famous}} of the Cub Room's headwaiters was John [...] "Jack" [...] Spooner, who was well known to many celebrities from his {{previous}} duties at LaHiff's. Billingsley recruited him in 1934 {{after the death of}} Billy Lahiff and the subsequent closure of his club. Spooner began an autograph book for his daughter, Amelia, while working at LaHiff's. [...] Billingsley encouraged him to bring [...] "The Book" [...] to the Stork Club, where stars continued to sign it. [...] Some who were famous illustrators or cartoonists such as E. C. Segar (Popeye), Chic Young (Blondie), and Theodor Geisel ("Dr. Seuss") would add personalized doodles or drawings for Spooner's young daughter. Billingsley's rule of thumb for his help, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>them,</b> they don't belong in here," [...] did not apply to Spooner. It was Spooner's knowing the patrons and socializing with them away from the job that helped make the Stork Club so successful with attracting celebrity clients. At Christmas, Spooner dressed as Santa Claus, posing for photos with old and young alike.|$|E

Before the performance Jonas announced: [...] "Do you guys mind if I play a couple of songs I like from pop radio right now? Would that be OK? The only problem is, I don't know all the words. So if <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>them,</b> sing along." [...] After watching the performance online, Gaga posted his cover on her Twitter account along with the words [...] "Swoon! Nick Jonas singing The Edge of Glory. On my way to press conference in Taichung, listening to it. So dreamy! X." [...] British band Friendly Fires covered the song during BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge. Kevin O'Donnell of Spin praised their cover writing: [...] "Gaga's original showcases the pop star's gale force pipes, and Friendly Fires frontman Ed Macfarlane doesn't try to match that energy. Instead, they offer a lovely, cinematic take on the song: Macfarlane croons with the heart-on-sleeve sensitivity of an emo-boy over cascading synth melodies and a breezy funk pulse. Nice!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "O no, but if <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>them</b> as well, {{are there}} any equally worthy to be liked? I {{want you to be}} {{comfortable}} there very much, as it is all our fault." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{remains to}} be seen. I have some ideas running in my head, of course, but before letting <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>them</b> I wish {{to hear what you}} would advise." ...|$|E
