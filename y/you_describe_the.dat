I am {{not really}} sceptical about it, but I {{must admit that}} I feel very {{strongly}} that such work as <b>you</b> <b>describe</b> <b>the</b> critic producing--and creative such work must undoubtedly be admitted to be--is, of necessity, purely subjective, whereas the greatest work is objective always, objective and impersonal.|$|E

You {{should do it}} because you can't help yourself, because it's natural to you, because the man in you is crying out for heroic expression.

"Judging by {{what you}} said to Mrs. Cornett on the croquet-lawn yesterday, you were out for food. <b>You</b> <b>described</b> <b>the</b> Blemleys as the dullest people to stay with that you knew, but said they were clever enough to employ a first-rate cook; {{otherwise}} they'd {{find it difficult to}} get anyone to come down a second time." ...|$|R

Maso hath not his equal {{on the road for}} {{activity}} and courage, and the beast is second only to our mastiffs of the convent for the same qualities; but when you speak of the master's honesty, you speak of that for which the world gives him little credit, and do great disparagement to the brute, which is much the best of the two, in this respect." ...|$|E

But surely, if any one attend you, why not {{be accompanied by a}} person whom you have known long, and who knows you well; on whom you can confidently rely, and who may be aware, from a thousand signs and circumstances which will never attract my attention, at what particular and pressing moments you may require prompt and energetic assistance. Such is the companion you want; and surely such an one you may find in Arnelm, Von Neuwied--" ...|$|E

The strained relationship between Sellers and Blake Edwards had further deteriorated {{by the time}} production of Strikes Again was underway. Sellers was mentally and physically in bad shape, and Edwards commented on the actor's mental state: [...] "If you went to an asylum and <b>you</b> <b>described</b> <b>the</b> first inmate <b>you</b> saw, that's what Peter had become. He was certifiable." ...|$|R

60|$|<b>You</b> <b>describe</b> <b>the</b> beauties of Rio Janeiro in glowing colours, {{and your}} {{animated}} picture was rendered still more agreeable {{to me by}} the sight, which I had enjoyed a little before, of a panorama of the same scene, executed by a friend of mine, who in his youth studied at the Academy with a view to practise painting as a profession. He was a very promising young artist, but having a brother a Brazilian merchant, he changed his purpose and went to Rio, where he resided many years, and made a little fortune, which enabled him to purchase and build in Cumberland, where I saw his splendid portrait of that magnificent region. What an intricacy of waters, and what boldness and fantastic variety in the mountains! I suppose, taking the region as a whole, it is scarcely anywhere surpassed.|$|E
60|$|On {{the other}} hand, Time is at last {{beginning}} to sift the true admirers of Dickens from the false. Yours, Sir, {{in the best}} sense of the word, is a popular success, a popular reputation. For example, I know that, in a remote and even Pictish part of this kingdom, a rural household, humble and under the shadow of a sorrow inevitably approaching, has found in 'David Copperfield' oblivion of winter, of sorrow, and of sickness. On the other hand, people are now picking up heart to say that 'they cannot read Dickens,' and that they particularly detest 'Pickwick.' I believe it was young ladies who first had the courage of their convictions in this respect. 'Tout sied aux belles,' and the fair, in the confidence of youth, often venture on remarkable confessions. In your 'Natural History of Young Ladies' I do not remember that <b>you</b> <b>describe</b> <b>the</b> Humorous Young Lady (1). She is a very rare bird indeed, and humour generally is at a deplorably low level in England.|$|E
60|$|I avail myself gladly of the {{opportunity}} of Mr. Graves's return, to acknowledge the honour you have done me in prefixing my name to your volume of beautiful poems, and {{to thank you for}} the copy you have sent me with your own autograph. Where {{there is so much to}} admire, it is difficult to select; and therefore I shall content myself with naming only two or three pieces. And, first, let me particularise the piece that stands second in the volume, 'Flowers and Music in a Sick Room.' This was especially touching to me, on my poor sister's account, who has long been an invalid, confined almost to her chamber. The feelings are sweetly touched throughout this poem, and the imagery very beautiful; above all, in the passage where <b>you</b> <b>describe</b> <b>the</b> colour of the petals of the wild rose. This morning, I have read the stanzas upon 'Elysium' with great pleasure. You have admirably expanded the thought of Chateaubriand. If we had not been disappointed in our expected pleasure of seeing you here, I should have been tempted to speak of many other passages and poems with which I have been delighted.|$|E

6000|$|... "MY DEAR MRS. CONWAY: I {{congratulate you}} most heartily upon the great success you have met with. I own that I {{have never been}} very hopeful, for after the {{thorough}} search we made of the room I hardly thought it likely that you would succeed when we had failed; however, you have done so, and I cannot doubt that a similar success will attend your further efforts. In a small bare room such as <b>you</b> <b>describe</b> <b>the</b> difficulties {{in the way of}} finding the hidden receptacle cannot be so great as those you have already overcome. You are perfectly correct in your supposition that the fragment you sent me was part of the letter that I sent over with the will to Mr. Penfold by my clerk. I have compared it with the copy in my letter book, and find that it is the same. As you say, this letter proves conclusively that Mr. Penfold was in this secret room after he received the will, and one can assign no reason for his going there unless to put the will away in what he considered a secure hiding-place. That it is still somewhere there I have no doubt whatever, and I shall await with much anxiety news as to your further progress." ...|$|E
6000|$|Now if {{all this}} can be done in the key of tragedy and philosophic comedy, it can, I have always contended, be done in the key of farcical comedy; and Overruled is a trifling {{experiment}} in that manner. Conventional farcical comedies are always finally tedious because the heart of them, the inevitable conjugal infidelity, is always evaded. Even its consequences are evaded. Mr. Granville Barker has pointed out rightly that if the third acts of our farcical comedies dared to describe the consequences that would follow from the first and second in real life, they would end as squalid tragedies; and in my opinion they would be greatly improved thereby even as entertainments; for I have never seen a three-act farcical comedy without being bored and tired by the third act, and observing {{that the rest of the}} audience were in the same condition, though they were not vigilantly introspective enough to find that out, and were apt to blame one another, especially the husbands and wives, for their crossness. But it is happily by no means true that conjugal infidelities always produce tragic consequences, or that they need produce even the unhappiness which they often do produce. Besides, the more momentous the consequences, the more interesting become the impulses and imaginations and reasonings, if any, of the people who disregard them. If I had an opportunity of conversing with the ghost of an executed murderer, I have no doubt he would begin to tell me eagerly about his trial, with the names of the distinguished ladies and gentlemen who honored him with their presence on that occasion, and then about his execution. All of which would bore me exceedingly. I should say, [...] "My dear sir: such manufactured ceremonies do not interest me in the least. I know how a man is tried, and how he is hanged. I should have had you killed in a much less disgusting, hypocritical, and unfriendly manner if the matter had been in my hands. What I want to know about is the murder. How did you feel when you committed it? Why did you do it? What did you say to yourself about it? If, like most murderers, you had not been hanged, would you have committed other murders? Did you really dislike the victim, or did you want his money, or did you murder a person whom you did not dislike, and from whose death you had nothing to gain, merely for the sake of murdering? If so, can <b>you</b> <b>describe</b> <b>the</b> charm to me? Does it come upon you periodically; or is it chronic? Has curiosity anything to do with it?" [...] I would ply him with all manner of questions to find out what murder is really like; and I should not be satisfied until I had realized that I, too, might commit a murder, or else that there is some specific quality present in a murderer and lacking in me. And, if so, what that quality is.|$|E

50|$|The Index {{aggregates}} consumer {{responses to}} three {{questions on the}} following topics: i) national economy ("would <b>you</b> <b>describe</b> <b>the</b> state of the nation's economy these days as excellent, good, not so good, or poor?", ii) on personal finances ("would <b>you</b> <b>describe</b> <b>the</b> state of your own personal finances these days as excellent, good, not so good, or poor?") and iii) buying climate ("considering the cost of things today and your own personal finances, would you say now is an excellent time, a good time, a not so good time, or a poor time to buy the things you want and need?"). The Index is derived by subtracting the negative response to each question from the positive response to that question. The three resulting numbers are then added and divided by three. The index can range from +100 (everyone positive on all three measures) to -100 (all negative on all three measures).|$|E
