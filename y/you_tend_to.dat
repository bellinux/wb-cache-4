[...] We get our first look at Muhammad Yunus's perception of the absolute poor when he meets Sufiya Begum, a bamboo stool maker who was trapped in poverty's vicious cycle {{due to a lack}} of 27 cents. That is where we find that what will become Grameen bank, is founded upon one man's heart for those that society and big corporations could or would not help. [...] Taking productive action, Yunus worked with the banks and community around to empower people like Sufiya to be able to apply for credit, and use it in the best and most productive way that she knows how in her unique situation. [...] Grameen Bank would need to be a bank of unusual standards. It would have to be, as Yunus put it, [...] "an institution that would lend to those that had nothing.

500|$|Douglas Rankine of Wired UK and McKinley Noble of GamePro thought {{previously}} existing Nintendo DS {{games were}} revitalized with the Nintendo DSi XL's larger screens; games like Scribblenauts and The World Ends with You benefited from increased touchscreen precision and increased legibility of text, respectively.

However, Jackson and IGN's Scott Lowe and Chris Burke agreed its clear and vivid colors considerably compensated for its unchanged resolution. Carol Mangis of PC Magazine thought families looking to share a handheld between members should consider a DSi XL, but the larger screens were not enough of an incentive for current DSi owners to upgrade. Lowe, Burke, Jackson, and Bakalar concluded the larger DSi model is not an essential upgrade; Jackson explained [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>tend</b> not <b>to</b> carry it out with you, and only ever <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> use it at home, then the DSi XL is the better choice".|$|R
2500|$|Researchers have {{attempted}} to explain the racial segregation seen in neighborhoods throughout the United States. [...] There are three leading theories. The first [...] "asserts that the phenomenon is really self – segregation, {{the result of the}} preferences of blacks, as with other ethnics, to live in segregated neighborhoods. The second suggests that poverty, aided by the inertia of history has perpetuated segregation. The third suggests that the decline of blatant discrimination of the past has revealed pervasive institutional racism." [...] John E. Farley, argues that although it is plausible for each of these theories to contribute to the segregation seen, his research lends the most support to the second theory, which bases itself on social class. Farley states that [...] "class largely determines what housing people can afford to rent or buy, and since the gap between whites and African Americans is wide with respect to income (U.S. Census Bureau 2001) and even wider with respect to wealth" [...] <b>you</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> see people with similar incomes and wealth in the same areas. Diana Pearce, another researcher, contributes the segregation seen in neighborhoods throughout the United States to institutional racism.

[...] She continues that [...] "as a group they are not only experts, they also control access to housing areas.
