500|$|In {{terms of}} music, <b>Yours</b> <b>Truly</b> explores a [...] "retro style" [...] sound mixing 1990s R with '50s doo-wop genre. Scott Interrante from PopMatters complimented the music {{presented}} in the album and noted that compositionally and production wise, [...] "tropes of both styles are blended together effortlessly." [...] As him perceived, [...] "erratic programmed drums support the rich harmonies and piano chords of the more doo-wop songs and the R tracks are infused with a wide-eyed optimism more associated with the ‘60s pop style." [...] Pitchfork's Andrew Ryce felt that Grande opted [...] "for a 90s hip-hop soul vibe that awkwardly sits with the more doo-wop-indebted songwriting." ...|$|E

He stated that the album often [...] "brings to mind the intonations of Mariah Carey which are most likely intentional." [...] Collar closed the statement saying that <b>Yours</b> <b>Truly</b> [...] "makes the most of her talent." [...] Nick Catucci of Entertainment Weekly graded the album an A-, calling the album [...] "pure pop bliss" [...] and [...] "one of the most purely enjoyable albums of the year" [...] that is powered by her [...] "lithe, Broadway-honed voice". At The New York Times, Jon Caramanica gave a positive review of the album, writing that television shows such as American Idol and Glee [...] "have been responsible for an intense surge of interest in music on television, but they haven't left much of a mark on the shape of pop. That's because both shows are fundamentally conservative institutions, privileging the familiar and the unchallenging. They're about emulating, not innovating." [...] Caramanica commended Grande for becoming the first [...] "identifiable pop star" [...] who takes the [...] "rules of those enterprises, uses them as a foundation, and innovates atop them...

500|$|<b>Yours</b> <b>Truly</b> is {{the result}} of three years of work. The project {{underwent}} significant conceptual and sonic changes throughout that time. Grande began working on the album in August 2010 while she was filming Victorious and formally started to work on it with a record label after she was signed to Republic Records on August 10, 2011. By September 10 of that year, Grande already had twenty songs prepared and was going through the process of narrowing it down to thirteen. The first single, a bubblegum pop song called [...] "Put Your Hearts Up", was released on December 12, 2011. The single was aimed at young audiences, perhaps intending to cater to Grande's core audience, which at that time was almost entirely made up by kids who knew her from Victorious. During an interview in June 2012, Grande described everything on the album as being [...] "50s, 60s doo-wop-inspired" [...] and revealed that two new singles were going to be released before the album, one of which was called [...] "Do You Love Me?" [...] and featured SkyBlu. Other songs that Grande had rights to, named and later leaked as being part of the album included [...] "Honeymoon Avenue", [...] "Voodoo Love", [...] "Pink Champagne", [...] "Boyfriend Material", [...] "Tattooed Heart", [...] "Daydreamin'" [...] and [...] "You're My Only Shawty". The latter never made it onto <b>Yours</b> <b>Truly</b> and was eventually given to Demi Lovato to record and include on her 2011 R album Unbroken. as [...] "You're My Only Shorty".|$|E
500|$|Grande {{made her}} chart debut in April 2013 with [...] "The Way", which peaked at number nine on the United States chart Billboard Hot 100.

The album spawned two more singles: [...] "Baby I" [...] and [...] "Right There", the former peaked at number six in Japan. In December 2013, Grande released her first extended play Christmas Kisses, featuring four Christmas-themed tracks. The EP was re-released in December 2014, exclusive to Japan, with one bonus track, Grande's Christmas single [...] "Santa Tell Me".|$|E
