[...] The critical {{reaction to the}} film was generally negative. Roger Ebert wrote, [...] "The DJ who was hosting the radio station's free preview of Cool World leaped onto the stage and promised the audience: 'If you liked Roger Rabbit, you'll love Cool World!' He was wrong, but you can't blame him—he hadn't seen the movie. I have, and I will now promise <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> liked Roger Rabbit, quit while you're ahead." [...] The film was a box-office disappointment. While other film projects followed, Bakshi began to focus more attention on painting.|$|E
2500|$|Callaghan replied, [...] "Well, that's a {{judgement}} {{that you}} are making. I promise <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> {{look at it from}} outside, and perhaps you're taking rather a parochial view at the moment, I don't think that other people in the world would share the view that there is mounting chaos." [...] This reply was reported in The Sun under the headline [...] "Crisis? What Crisis?". Callaghan also later admitted in regard to the Winter of Discontent that he had [...] "let the country down".|$|E

"Have a drink, {{down the}} hatch baby, 20 bucks if you drink it right down; see if you're a real woman; finish that drink, finish that drink, down the hatch hurry, right down; you need another drink, I'll give you 50 bucks {{if you can}} take it; I'll give you 10, 20, 50 dollars, {{whatever}} you want, come on I {{want to see you}} get it all down; you get it right down, I'll give you the 50 bucks and the 13 bucks; I'll give you 50 bucks.

2500|$|In 1960, Cohen {{lived in}} rural Hydra, Greece, in an {{apartment}} with intermittent electricity that he was renting for $14 a month. He lived there with Marianne Ihlen, with whom {{he was in a}} relationship for most of the 1960s. The song [...] "So Long, Marianne" [...] was written to and about her. Ihlen died of leukemia three months before Cohen. His farewell letter to her was read at her funeral, stating that [...] "... our bodies are falling apart and I think I will follow you very soon. Know that I am so close behind <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> stretch out your hand, I think you can reach mine." ...|$|E
2500|$|Traditional {{adventure}} games became {{difficult to}} propose as new commercial titles. Gilbert wrote in 2005, [...] "From first-hand experience, I can tell <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> even utter the words 'adventure game' {{in a meeting}} with a publisher you can just pack up your spiffy concept art and leave. You'd get a better reaction by announcing that you have the plague." [...] In 2012 Schaefer said [...] "If I were to go to a publisher right now and pitch an adventure game, they'd laugh in my face." [...] Though most commercial adventure game publication had stopped in the United States by the early 2000s, the genre was still popular in Europe. Games such as The Longest Journey by Funcom as well as Amerzone and Syberia, both conceived by Benoît Sokal and developed by Microïds, with rich classical elements of the genre still garnered high critical acclaims.|$|E
2500|$|Stanford center Milt Vucinich said, [...] "We'd {{been reading}} about all those beatings Shaughnessy's men had taken, so we were joking among {{ourselves}} that wasn't it just like Stanford to hire somebody like this to coach us." [...] In his first address to the team, Shaughnessy told them, [...] "Boys, I am not to be addressed as 'Clark' or, especially, [...] 'Soup'. To you, I am 'Mr. Shaughnessy' or 'Coach.' Nothing else. I am a professor of football... Now, I have a formation for <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> learn it well {{will take you to}} the Rose Bowl." [...] He asserted that one of his plays, a line plunge by a back without a blocker, would score ten to twelve touchdowns alone, which was more than the Indians had scored the entire previous season. The players were understandably skeptical, and they were not alone. Football innovator and single-wing proponent Glenn [...] "Pop" [...] Warner said before the season, [...] "If Stanford wins a single game with that crazy formation, you can throw all the football I ever knew into the Pacific Ocean." [...] Shaughnessy later discovered that the players, who were mostly returners from the 1939 team, were talented, but not suited to the single wing. As a contemporary newspaper noted, [...] "The [...] team looked great in some games and sour in others. The machinery was there but it wasn't running as smoothly as had been hoped for." ...|$|E
