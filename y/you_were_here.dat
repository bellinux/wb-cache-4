5|$|Pink Floyd {{achieved}} international {{success with}} the concept albums The Dark Side of the Moon, Wish <b>You</b> <b>Were</b> <b>Here,</b> Animals, and The Wall. By the early 1980s, they {{had become one of}} the most critically acclaimed and commercially successful groups in the history of popular music; by 2013, they had sold more than 250 million albums worldwide. Amid creative differences, Waters left in 1985 and began a legal dispute with the remaining members over their use of the band's name and material. They settled out of court in 1987, and nearly eighteen years passed before he performed with them again.|$|E
5|$|Pink Floyd {{were founded}} by {{students}} Syd Barrett on guitar and lead vocals, Nick Mason on drums, Roger Waters on bass and vocals, and Richard Wright on keyboards and vocals. They gained popularity performing in London's underground music scene {{during the late}} 1960s, and under Barrett's leadership released two charting singles and a successful debut album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967). Guitarist and vocalist David Gilmour joined in December 1967; Barrett left in April 1968 due to deteriorating mental health. Waters became the band's primary lyricist and conceptual leader, devising the concepts behind their albums The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Wish <b>You</b> <b>Were</b> <b>Here</b> (1975), Animals (1977), The Wall (1979) and The Final Cut (1983). The Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall became two of the best-selling albums of all time.|$|E

25|$|Thomas {{produced}} {{a trio of}} albums for power pop group Badfinger on {{the tail end of}} their career, beginning with 1973's Ass, and 1974's Badfinger and Wish <b>You</b> <b>Were</b> <b>Here</b> albums. Ass was originally recorded with Badfinger producing, but the group later admitted they were incapable of producing themselves. Members Pete Ham and Tom Evans solicited Thomas' help in cleaning up existing recordings and laying down new tracks. Although the succeeding album Badfinger retained Thomas from the outset and was considered by critics to be an improvement in production, neither album was successful in the marketplace. For their third project together, Thomas held a meeting with the group and pleaded that they all concentrate on making the best record they could muster. It turned out that Wish <b>You</b> <b>Were</b> <b>Here</b> garnered the most positive critical response from periodicals, including Rolling Stone magazine.|$|E

500|$|Wish <b>You</b> <b>Were</b> <b>Here</b> was {{an instant}} {{commercial}} success (despite the fact that Harvest Records' parent company EMI was unable to print enough copies of the album to satisfy commercial demand), and although it initially received mixed reviews, the album has since gone on to receive critical acclaim.

500|$|Pink Floyd {{and their}} manager Steve O'Rourke had been {{dissatisfied}} with the efforts of EMI's US label Capitol Records, and Wish <b>You</b> <b>Were</b> <b>Here</b> was Pink Floyd's first album with Columbia Records, an affiliate of CBS. [...] The band remained with EMI's Harvest Records in Europe.

500|$|Barrett's {{innovative}} guitar {{work and}} exploration of experimental {{techniques such as}} dissonance, distortion and feedback influenced many musicians. His recordings are also noted for their strongly English-accented vocal delivery. After leaving the music industry, Barrett continued with painting and dedicated himself to gardening.
