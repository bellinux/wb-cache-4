25|$|Thumb Guard: A {{hard plastic}} guard that forms around <b>your</b> <b>thumb</b> to prevent <b>your</b> <b>thumb</b> from being broken from a pitch from the pitcher. The thumb guard {{is located on}} the inside of the glove (if worn) and is usually very helpful in protection.|$|E
25|$|When {{using this}} convention, in {{contrast}} to the other convention, the defined handedness of the wave matches the handedness of the screw type nature of the field in space. Specifically, if one freezes a right-handed wave in time, when one curls the fingers of one’s right hand around the helix, the thumb will point in the direction which the helix progresses given that sense of rotation. Note that it is the nature of all screws and helices that it does not matter in which direction you point <b>your</b> <b>thumb</b> when determining its handedness.|$|E
25|$|The {{conventional}} reel or trolling reel {{is similar}} to the baitcasting reel. There are two types of trolling reels, star drag reels and lever drag reels. Star drag reels are like baitcasters, but you move a little lever to put it into free spool. They have a star drag and you have to keep <b>your</b> <b>thumb</b> on them to keep off backlash. The lever drag reel uses the drag to put itself into free spool. It is very difficult to cast a conventional reel, most oven line is dropped behind a boat and left to drift. Conventional reels are for really big fish and are usually used offshore. They are designed for trolling but can also be used for butterfly jigging and Deep-sea fishing ("deep drop"). They are mounted on short rods.|$|E

500|$|Dylan {{had married}} Sara Lownds in November 1965. By {{the time the}} {{basement}} sessions started in Big Pink around June 1967, he had two children: Maria (Sara's daughter from her first marriage) and Jesse Dylan. Anna Dylan was born on July 11, 1967. Both Heylin and biographer Sid Griffin suggest that recording had to move from Dylan's home to Big Pink {{when it became clear}} that the sessions were getting in the way of family life. Domesticity was the context of The Basement Tapes, as Hudson said in The Last Waltz: [...] "Chopping wood and hitting <b>your</b> <b>thumb</b> with a hammer, fixing the tape recorder or the screen door, wandering off into the woods with Hamlet ... it was relaxed and low-key, which was something we hadn't enjoyed since we were children." [...] Several Basement Tapes songs, such as [...] "Clothes Line Saga" [...] and [...] "Apple Suckling Tree", celebrate the domestic aspects of the rural lifestyle.|$|E
500|$|... "Cruise Control", {{featuring}} reggae artist Damian Marley, {{is influenced}} by R and reggae, and finds her adapting to the genre by imitating Jamaican phrases, accents and styles of singing. [...] "I Stay in Love" [...] was released as the fourth and final single from the album. Written by Carey and Bryan-Michael Cox, is a mid-tempo [...] "beat-driven" [...] and [...] "piano-laced" [...] ballad, that {{is influenced by}} pop and RB& music genres. The song's instrumentation is derived from a piano melody, and is backed by a strong computerized drum-beat. Its lyrics find Carey as her most vulnerable; she describes old times she shared with her lover, and that even though [...] "we said let go", and [...] "inside she knows it's over", she still [...] "stays in love with him". Featuring American rapper Young Jeezy, [...] "Side Effects" [...] describes Carey's abusive relationship with Tommy Mottola, her ex-husband. During the first verse, she discusses the pair's background, and how {{she was young and}} naive, and believed everything he preached to her. The lyrics read [...] "Keepin' me there, under <b>your</b> <b>thumb</b> / Cause you were scared that I'd become much / More than you could handle," [...] she confesses, and refers to herself as [...] "Shining like a chandelier / That decorated every room inside / The private hell we built / And I dealt with it / Like a kid I wished / I could fly away." [...] Sarah Rodman from The Boston Globe described it as [...] "another look at her fractious marriage to Mottola", and wrote [...] "Although the union ended in 1998, Carey is still suffering, including dreams of the 'violent times' and 'sleeping with the enemy'. Interestingly, her vocal approach here is almost emo, as she hits her rock-solid middle register and refuses to be held captive by the demons of her past." [...] MTV News writer Jennifer Vineyard described the song in detail: ...|$|E
2500|$|Initiation: When I {{begin by}} shaking hands, I do so normally. The [...] "hypnotic touch" [...] then begins when I let loose. The letting loose becomes {{transformed}} from a firm grip into a gentle touch by the thumb, a lingering drawing away of the little finger, a faint brushing of the subject's hand with the middle finger - just enough vague sensation to attract the attention. As the subject gives attention to the touch of <b>your</b> <b>thumb,</b> you shift to a touch with your little finger. As your subject's attention follows that, you shift to a touch with your middle finger and then again to the thumb.|$|E

5000|$|British {{comic book}} writer Warren Ellis {{considered}} Brokencyde's [...] "FreaXXX" [...] music video [...] "a near-perfect snapshot of everything that’s shit about {{this point in}} the culture".
