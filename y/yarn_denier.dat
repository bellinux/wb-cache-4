40|$|The study {{objective}} {{was to determine the}} optimal water porosity for a warp-knit, externally veloured Dacron arterial prosthesis. Preclotting efficiency, surgical handling characteristics, thrombogenicity, and 56 -day healing in the descending thoracic aorta of mongrel dogs were measured for seven different arterial prostheses of the same basic design constructed to test the influence of decreased porosity produced by increased <b>yarn</b> <b>denier</b> at a constant needle density. The six prototypes tested were 160, 180, 200, 220, 240, and 280 denier. The 140 denier prosthesis (Bionit, C. R. Bard, Inc., Billerica, MA) served as the control. The water porosity of these prostheses varied from 2036 ml/cm 2 /min at 120 mmHg for the control to 286 for the 280 prototype. The preclotting efficiency increased with decreased water porosity and with increased outer-wall filamentousness. Desirability of surgical handling characteristics decreased with lowered water porosity, while the degree of outer-wall filamentousness had little influence. All the prostheses showed excellent through-wall healing at 56 days, including endothelialization. The 160 prototype represented an optimal blend of high preclotting efficiency, desirable surgical handling characteristics, and excellent 56 -day healing. These studies are pertinent to the future development of porous, warp-knit Dacron arterial prostheses...|$|E
40|$|Theoretical {{models have}} been {{proposed}} in this article (Parts I and II) to predict the vertical wicking behaviour of yarns and fabrics based on different fibre, yarn and fabric parameters. The {{first part of this}} article deals with the modelling of flow through yarn during vertical wicking, whereas the second part deals with the modelling of vertical wicking through the fabric. The yarn model has been developed based on the Laplace equation and the Hagen– Poiseuille’s equation on fluid flow; pore geometry has been determined as per the yarn structure. Factors such as fibre contact angle, number of filaments in a yarn, fibre denier, fibre cross-sectional shape, <b>yarn</b> <b>denier</b> and twist level in the yarn have been taken into account for development of the model. Lambertw, a mathematical function, has been incorporated, which helps to predict vertical wicking height at any given time, considering the gravitational effects. Experimental verification of the model has been carried out using polyester yarns. The model was found to predict the wicking height with time through the yarns with reasonable accuracy. Based on the proposed yarn model, a mathematical model has been developed to predict the vertical wicking through plain woven fabric {{in the second part of}} this article...|$|E

5000|$|The {{original}} specification for ballistic nylon was an 18 ounce nylon fabric {{made from}} 1050 denier high tenacity nylon yarn in a 2×2 basketweave. Today {{the term is}} often used to refer to any nylon fabric that is made with a [...] "ballistic weave", typically a 2×2 or 2×3 basketweave. It can be woven from nylon <b>yarns</b> of various <b>denier</b> such as 840 denier and 1680 denier. Denier refers to the weight, not the strength, of the fabric. Laboratory tests have been run and the double weave 1050 denier fabric is the strongest and most durable fabric for its denier weight level. The 1680 denier is a good alternative that has a similar strength but lighter weight than the 1050 as it resists abrasion and tearing. Ballistic nylon is hard to dye, so it is often found in black or similar dark colors.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Bursting {{strength}} {{is a standard}} method for evaluating mosquito net strength. This article suggests that tension strength with one grab and one hook better represent how holes are generated in bed nets in real life. Methods Measurements of bursting strength and tension strengths in the two directions are analysed for eight model nets created for the study. The nets {{were made in the}} most commonly used denier (75 and 100 D) and mesh (156 holes/inch 2) for multifilament polyester yarns, texturized or not, and with 4 or 6 sided holes. All were made from one polyester quality. Data was arranged in a randomized, complete block design and analysed for significant variables and their interactions. Data was then subjected to regression analyses using net square metre weight as a weighting factor with stepwise removal of variables. This revealed how the four textile variables interacted and allowed for making predictions for the strength of commercial nets in polyester or polyethylene. Results For the model nets, higher denier provided higher bursting strength and tension strengths, texturizing weakened nets and four-sided holes were stronger than six-sided holes. Even when compensating for square metre weight, 100 D nets are stronger than 75 D nets. Results for the commercial polyester net nets are less clear, probably because of different qualities of polyester. Tensile strength: a 75 denier net knitted tightly to provide the same square metre weight as a standard 100 denier net therefore does not obtain the same strength. Polyethylene nets are made of mono-fibre yarns and, therefore, have higher tension strength in both directions than multifilament polyester nets. For bursting strength results overlap for 100 <b>denier</b> <b>yarns</b> of both yarn types. As a class, commercial polyethylene nets are stronger than commercial polyester net whatever method is used for evaluation. Conclusion Tension strength measured in the length and width directions of the net using one hook and one clamp provide new relevant data as this method more closely imitates the cause of tear holes in nets as they occur in real life use. Using this methodology, the commercial monofilament yarn polyethylene nets are significantly stronger than the commercial multifilament polyester nets. This test method should be applied for nets used for years in the field. </p...|$|R
30|$|Several {{researchers}} {{have attempted to}} study the effect of fibre and yarn parameters on comfort characteristics of woven and knitted fabrics. Varshney et al. (2010) studied the effect of fibre linear density on physiological properties of polyester woven fabrics and observed an increase in thermal resistance, trans planar wicking, air and water vapour permeability with fibre decitex. However they observed that thermal conductivity, thermal absorptivity and spreading speed of water drop decreased with increase in fibre coarseness. Das et al. (2008) reported reduction in air and water vapour permeability through the fabrics but increased wicking properties with the decrease in fibre diameter in their studies on micro-denier and normal denier filament fabrics. Ramakrishnan et al. (2009) compared the comfort properties of micro denier and normal <b>denier</b> viscose <b>yarn</b> knitted fabrics and observed better water absorbency and wicking for micro <b>denier</b> <b>yarn</b> knitted fabrics. Raj and Sreenivasan (2009) reported that the cotton fibre fineness had negative correlation with air permeability of fabrics woven from yarns having the same count and twist and suggested this outcome of reduced air spaces in the fabrics made from finer fibres. Oglakcioglu and Marmarali (2010) studied the effect of yarn type on thermal comfort properties of cotton knitted fabrics and observed that fabrics knitted with double plied yarn had higher thermal conductivity, thermal absorptivity and thermal resistance compared to single plied yarn fabrics. Singh and Nigam (2013) compared carded, combed and compact spun yarn woven fabrics for their comfort performance and reported that compact weft yarn fabrics showed high water vapour permeability while carded yarn fabrics showed higher thermal insulation. Ozdil et al. (2007) studied the thermal comfort properties of carded and combed yarn rib knitted fabrics and observed an increase in thermal conductivity and water vapour permeability of fabrics knitted with combed yarns. Nasrin and Nahida (2011) reported that combed yarns were stronger, less hairy and more uniform than carded yarns. Erdumlu and Saricam (2013) studied the wicking and drying properties of vortex spun yarns and knitted fabrics in comparison with ring-spun yarns and fabrics. They observed that vortex spun yarn had lower yarn and fabric wicking values and water absorbency rate than ring-spun yarns. Tyagi et al. (2009) studied the influence of yarn type on thermal comfort properties of woven fabrics and concluded that Murata Jet Spinning (MJS) yarn fabrics showed higher absorbency, air and water vapour permeability but lower wick ability compared to ring yarn fabrics. The review of published literature suggests that researches are mainly focused on studying the effect of fibre and yarn parameters on comfort properties of woven and knitted fabrics. However, studies on the thermo-physiological properties of plated knits are very limited although the structures are fast becoming preferred choice as intimate wear owing to flexibility in engineering fabrics with different fibre and yarn combinations in the two distinct layers. Moreover, none of the reported studies suggest the desirable fibre and yarn combination in the two layers to engineer fabrics suited for particular environmental conditions. The present study was, therefore undertaken to explore the field further and {{to determine the effect}} of inner layer fibre linear density and the outer layer yarn type on thermo-physiological properties of plated knits.|$|R
40|$|Gillespie, John, Jr. Keefe, MichaelBallistic impact onto {{flexible}} {{textile fabrics}} {{is a complicated}} multi-scale problem owing to the structural hierarchy of the materials, anisotropic material behavior, projectile geometry, impact velocity and boundary conditions. While this subject has been an active area of research for decades, the fundamental mechanisms such as material failure, dynamic response and multi-axial loading occurring at lower length scales during impact are not well understood. This work provides {{new insights into the}} fundamental deformation and failure mechanisms during ballistic impact onto textile fabrics at the micron length scale. In this research, a hybrid computational-experimental systematic approach is adopted to understand the mechanisms and deformation modes of high performance polymer fibers, specifically Kevlar KM 2, that is widely used in ballistic impact applications. Fiber length-scale 3 D finite element (FE) models are developed to better understand and complement the complicated transverse impact experiments. The fiber length-scale study suggests that fibers are subjected to multiaxial stress states including transverse compression, axial tension, axial compression and transverse shear significant enough to cause fibrillation in the fiber during impact. A dispersive flexural wave mode is predicted by the model due to the finite longitudinal shear modulus of the fiber. The flexural wave induces curvature in the fiber significant enough to cause compressive kinking and, in turn, local fibrillation in the fiber. A fiber length-scale yarn model is developed by explicitly modeling all the 400 fibers in a KM 2 600 <b>denier</b> <b>yarn.</b> The yarn transverse compression results show that fiber-fiber contact plays {{a significant role in the}} spreading and deformation of individual fibers that is consistent with experimental results. When subjected to transverse impact, the model indicates significant transverse compressive strains in the fiber that increase with impact velocity and a flexural wave that induces curvatures in the fibers significant enough to induce compressive kinking and fibrillation. In addition to the transverse wave, a spreading wave develops due to fiber-fiber contact interaction that spreads the fibers to a large extent resulting in non-uniform loading and progressive failure of fibers within the yarn. Guided by the computational models, single-fiber micromechanical experiments for axial compressive kinking and transverse compression deformation modes are developed. The average tensile strength of the kinked fibers is found to be reduced by 7 % compared to the virgin fibers. An experimental methodology is developed to determine the single fiber constitutive behavior in quasi-static transverse compression by removing the geometric nonlinearity due to the growing contact area. The fibers exhibit nonlinear inelastic behavior under large compressive strains. The fibers subjected to 60 % nominal strains (80 % true strains) showed a 20 % reduction in average tensile strength compared to the virgin fibers. A nonlinear inelastic constitutive model is implemented as a user defined material (UMAT) suitable for the commercial FE code LS-DYNA explicit analysis. During impact, the inelastic behavior results in a significant reduction in the fiber bounce velocity and a reduction in the projectile-fiber contact forces by 40 % compared to an elastic constitutive behavior. The inelastic dissipation and reduced bounce leads to an inelastic collision rather than an elastic collision. The longitudinal shear modulus and the inelastic behavior are found to govern the failure response of the fibers during impact. Modeling the single fiber quasi-static multiaxial loading experiments indicate fiber failure may be initiated based on a gage length dependent maximum axial tensile strain in the fiber. Regardless of the material behavior (elastic or inelastic), fiber length-scale impact models show a gradient in the axial tensile strain (stress) in the fiber cross section at the location of failure consistent with multiaxial loading experimental observations. Fiber-level yarn breaking speed predictions based on a maximum axial tensile strain (stress) criterion are much lower than the breaking speed based on classical theory and they are consistent with experimental measurements. Therefore, the reduction in experimental yarn breaking speed compared to theoretical Smith solution is attributed to the stress concentration and property degradation mechanisms due to multiaxial stress states at the location of failure.
