I think it horrible and wonderful; I regard it as like Aztec or Benin sculpture, or to come nearer home the novels of Kafka, and am rather suspicious of any critic who claims not to feel anything so obvious.|$|E
2500|$|Maslow and Rogers {{emphasized}} {{a view of}} {{the person}} as an active, creative, experiencing human being who lives in the present and subjectively responds to current perceptions, relationships, and encounters. They disagree with the dark, pessimistic outlook of those in the Freudian psychoanalysis ranks, but rather view humanistic theories as positive and optimistic proposals which stress the tendency of the human personality toward growth and self-actualization. This progressing self will remain the center of its constantly changing world; a world that will help mold the self but not necessarily confine it. Rather, the self has opportunity for maturation based on its encounters with this world. This understanding attempts to reduce the acceptance of hopeless redundancy. Humanistic therapy typically relies on the client for information of the past and its effect on the present, therefore the client dictates the type of guidance the therapist may initiate. This allows for an individualized approach to therapy. Rogers found patients differ in how they respond to other people. Rogers tried to model a particular approach to therapy- he stressed the reflective or empathetic response. This response type takes the client's viewpoint and reflects back their feeling and the context for it. An example of a reflective response would be, [...] "It seems <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>feeling</b> anxious about your upcoming marriage". This response type seeks to clarify the therapist's understanding while also encouraging the client to think more deeply and seek to fully understand the feelings they have expressed.|$|E

5000|$|Yasheng Huang, a MIT professor, stated: “No {{matter what}} the truth of Mr. Qian’s death, doesn’t this {{demonstrate}} a political crisis, considering the preference of public opinion? If you’re the ruler, shouldn’t <b>you</b> <b>be</b> <b>feeling</b> anxious and concerned? Even if you don’t strive for justice, equality and progress, shouldn’t you start considering (political) system reform simply {{for the sake of}} ruling?” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not yet, Miss Rose," [...] {{said the}} miller, kindly. [...] "Don't {{try to talk}} yet. There's nothing as good for you as a nice, quiet little cry when <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>feeling</b> blue." ...|$|E

Well, well! Young sir, {{you have become}} {{more to me than}} an ordinary acquaintance.
