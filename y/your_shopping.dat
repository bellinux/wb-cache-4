5000|$|Quoting Doreen Massey, Moran {{says that}} despite every generation's {{emphasis}} on change, [...] "much {{of life for}} many people 'still consists of waiting in a bus shelter with <b>your</b> <b>shopping</b> for a bus that never comes'"; he describes himself as [...] "trying to find a critical language {{to talk about these}} empty, purposeless moments of daily life, filled with activities such as commuting and office routines, that we generally take for granted but that take up so much of our lives." [...] Moran describes himself as influenced by Mass-Observation and a new French ethnography of the quotidian or infraordinary, exemplified by works by Georges Perec, Marc Augé and François Bon.|$|E
5000|$|The {{number of}} stores and the rating also affect {{the number of}} {{customers}} the mall gets. For every store, five people can fit into <b>your</b> <b>shopping</b> mall, and the higher the rating, the more people come to your mall. The game provides {{a wide variety of}} stores. They include electronics, clothing, food, entertainment, sports and services. Many of the more advanced stores need to be researched before they can be constructed. A player can build a mall atrium and arrange monthly events to promote the mall. Such promotions include car shows, a mall oasis and a circus. An [...] "owner" [...] also can build restaurants, movie theaters, bowling alleys and arcades to attract customers. As with hiring research, these new additions also must be researched and evaluated.|$|E
5000|$|Sputnikmusic {{wrote of}} the EP [...] "In order {{to listen to this}} properly, I'd say you need the band's first full length album in order to see quite where this led." [...] The {{reviewer}} recommended Arcade Fire [...] "for those who are already fans, and if you aren't (not an option I advise), this should be No. 2 on <b>your</b> <b>shopping</b> list. No prizes for guessing what No. 1 is." [...] Pitchfork Media gave the EP 6.8 out of 10, saying that it [...] "finds the band still unsure of their capabilities". The music publication wrote that [...] "the build-ups seem either less patient or less directed, the quick changes more deliberate, the structures more top-heavy, and the payoffs ultimately less rewarding Funeral. Reviewer Stephen Deusner did, however, say that [...] "There are moments that not only hint at the heights of Funeral, but scale such heights themselves." ...|$|E

5000|$|Actress Karen Henthorn {{has since}} {{reflected}} on {{her time in}} EastEnders: [...] "I tried {{to keep an open}} mind regarding any expectations of the job. To be honest, I hadn’t got a clue what to expect. All I did know was that, because up until then, I, like the majority of actors, had spent years in and out of work (but mostly out). I had been struggling financially and creatively, had waited on more tables and pulled more pints than I care to remember. I was absolutely, without a shadow of a doubt, going to appreciate every single second, enjoy the whole experience. Which I did—whilst I was actually at work. But when I was away from the working environment, getting recognised in the street everywhere I went, being followed, pointed at, photographed, this was something I didn’t expect. And it happened overnight—one day, you can’t get anyone’s assistance in the supermarket, the next, they’re queuing up to carry <b>your</b> <b>shopping</b> home! Fame didn’t change me—it changed people round me. It was a very ‘interesting’ experience which took quite a while to get used to." ...|$|E
5000|$|Vedder took {{inspiration}} from the 1999 WTO protests in Seattle, Washington when writing [...] "Grievance". When speaking about [...] "Grievance" [...] in an interview, Vedder stated:I think technology went wrong somewhere. It just went into the wrong direction. Instead of helping us and freeing us, it seems to enslave us. That's what I talk about in [...] "Grievance", about the dangers and {{what a lot of}} people don't see or don't want to see. There's the line, [...] "For every tool they lend us a loss of independence" [...] and it's true. Everything happens so fast. The technology is supposed to make everything simple, easy. It tries to make us believe that it's some sort of freedom we have. Of course, it's easy and comfortable if you can do all <b>your</b> <b>shopping</b> via the internet, if you don't need to leave the house to do anything. But, on the other hand, what is going to happen? You lose touch with people. You don't meet new people except on the internet and whatever you do can be traced. They know everything about you; they know what you buy; they know which papers you read, how long you stay on a page and they look at your statistics and they're going to offer you the products they think you might buy - most of them you don't really need anyway. What is going to happen to individuality? ...|$|E
