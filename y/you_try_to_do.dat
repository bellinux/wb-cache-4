500|$|On February23,2011, it was {{announced}} that Glee, for the first time, would feature two original songs, entitled [...] "Get It Right" [...] and [...] "Loser Like Me" [...] on their March15,2011 episode. The song was written by series music producer Adam Anders with his wife Nikki Hassman, and writing partner Peer Åström. According to Anders the song was specifically crafted for Michele and was based on the storyline of Michele's character in the series, Rachel Berry. Anders told Entertainment Weekly, [...] "Lea’s storyline kind of inspired that song for me,” says Anders. [...] "Basically, <b>you</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> everything right and you have good motivations with everything you’re doing but everything ends up going wrong. How many times will it take for me to get it right?" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{release of}} Lizard {{merchandise}} designs along with unconfirmed concept art featuring a humanoid-shape {{with a layer}} of scales on top instead of a pronounced snout (similar to a dinosaur or crocodile) as in the most recent comics, produced a mixed reaction. Many commenters compared it to other fictional characters instead of his rendering in comics. Russ Fischer of /Film described the character as looking more [...] "Steve Ditko derived" [...] (the character's original artist). Webb felt that there are different incarnations of Lizard in the comic book. He felt that he should do it without the snout because he was interested more in human emotions and wanted to keep Rhys' presence in the creature. Webb wanted him to have emotion, have a face and have feeling. He stated [...] "that in a comic book, you just put that thing up there, and you can say, oh, thought bubble, whatever. But when <b>you</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that and make it look real, it's a different challenge, and I'm creating a movie, I'm not creating a comic book. That was part of the design." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the 2008 season, {{prior to}} the hiring of Gaston, the Blue Jays had a record of 35–39. Once Gaston and his coaches took over the Blue Jays went 51–37 to finish with an 86–76 record. The {{offensive}} improvements under Gaston {{were one of the}} reasons for the resurgence and as the hitting coach, Tenace was credited with rejuvenating a stagnant offense. Adam Lind commented: [...] "The thing is, a lot of people can teach you how to hit, but not a lot of people can teach you how to hit in the big leagues", referring to the major league experience of Gaston and Tenace.Blue Jays' former center fielder Vernon Wells has said he likes the approach to hitting that Tenace teaches: [...] "One thing Gene talks about is having that approach mentally when you go up there, in your mind you already guarantee yourself that one run on third, but you want to do more than that. Gene always says that first runner is a gimme, you should be able to come through in pretty much every situation like that. And then <b>you</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> more damage than just that one run".|$|E

2500|$|Le Guin's {{feelings}} towards anarchism {{are closely}} tied to her Taoist beliefs and both ideas appear in her work. [...] "Taoism and Anarchism fit together in some very interesting ways and I've been a Taoist ever since I learned what it was." [...] She has participated in numerous peace marches and although she does not call herself an anarchist since she does not live the lifestyle, she does feel that [...] "Democracy is good but it isn't {{the only way to}} achieve justice and a fair share." [...] Le Guin has said: [...] "The Dispossessed is an Anarchist utopian novel. Its ideas come from the Pacifist Anarchist tradition – Kropotkin etc. So did some of the ideas of the so-called counterculture of the sixties and seventies." [...] She has also said that anarchism [...] "is a necessary ideal at the very least. It is an ideal without which we couldn't go on. If you are asking me is anarchism at this point a practical movement, well, then you get in the question of where <b>you</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it and who's living on your boundary?" ...|$|E

60|$|COLONEL. [Following up his thoughts.] I {{always think}} women are wonderful.

"I see that, but {{am afraid}} you'll {{have to take}} my honesty for granted, because I can't tell you {{anything}} more, except that the man you came with is not to be trusted and may involve you in the difficulties that threaten him.

6000|$|... "For once I {{agree with}} you thoroughly, Hallett. It is bad enough to march in West Africa, but it is worse to sit still. It is only when <b>you</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that, that you find how much you are pulled down; and the longer you sit still, the less {{disposed}} you are to get up; whereas, on the march, you are so full {{of the idea that}} you may be ambushed, at any moment, that you have no time to think of your fatigues." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It won't do you {{any good}} to act in that way, Job Haskers," [...] {{returned}} our hero. [...] "We know you for the rascal that you are.

Now, let me say this: If you and those with <b>you</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the Morrs out of their property here, we'll do all we can to put you and Link Merwell in prison for your crimes.

[...] "Why don't <b>you</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{something}} instead of sneering at others who do? You never take anything seriously--except yourself, which isn't worth it. You {{are proud of}} your red hair and peaked nose just because you fondly believe that you got them from the Prince of Trulyruralania, {{and are willing to}} think evil of your ancestress to satisfy your snobbish little soul. Let me tell you, sir, that there was no more truth about that than there was in that silly talk of her partiality for her husband's red-haired gamekeeper in Scotland. Ah! that makes you start--don't it? But I have always observed that a mule is apt to remember only the horse side of his ancestry!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All {{that sort}} of personification," [...] said Wanhope, [...] "is far less {{remarkable}} than the depersonification which has now taken place so thoroughly that we no longer think in the old terms at all. It was natural that the primitive peoples should figure the passions, conditions, virtues, vices, forces, qualities, {{in some sort of}} corporal shape, with each a propensity or impulse of its own, but {{it does not seem to}} me so natural that the derivative peoples should cease to do so. It is rational that they should do so, and I don't know that any stronger proof of our intellectual advance could be alleged than the fact that the old personifications survive in the parlance while they are quite extinct in the consciousness. We still talk of death at times as if it were an embodied force of some kind, and of love in the same way; but I don't believe that any man of the commonest common-school education thinks of them so. If <b>you</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it yourself, you are rather ashamed of the puerility, and when a painter or a sculptor puts them in an objective shape, you follow him with impatience, almost with contempt." ...|$|E
60|$|But let no one {{think that}} a child or anyone else can learn {{religion}} from a teacher or a book or by any academic process whatever. It is only by an unfettered access to the whole body of Fine Art: that is, to the whole body of inspired revelation, that we can build up that conception of divinity to which all virtue is an aspiration. And to hope to find this body of art purified from all that is obsolete or dangerous or fierce or lusty, or {{to pick and choose}} what will be good for any particular child, much less for all children, is the shallowest of vanities. Such schoolmasterly selection is neither possible nor desirable. Ignorance of evil is not virtue but imbecility: admiring it is like giving a prize for honesty to a man who has not stolen your watch because he did not know you had one. Virtue chooses good from evil; and without knowledge there can be no choice. And even this is a dangerous simplification of what actually occurs. We are not choosing: we are growing. Were you to cut all of what you call the evil out of a child, it would drop dead. If you try to stretch it to full human stature when it is ten years old, you will simply pull it into two pieces and be hanged. And when <b>you</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this morally, which is what parents and schoolmasters are doing every day, you ought to be hanged; and some day, when we take a sensible view of the matter, you will be; and serve you right. The child does not stand between a good and a bad angel: what it has to deal with is a middling angel who, in normal healthy cases, wants to be a good angel as fast as it can without killing itself in the process, which is a dangerous one.|$|E
