5|$|BZP {{has been}} shown to have a mixed {{mechanism}} of action, acting on the serotonergic and dopaminergic receptor systems in a similar fashion to MDMA. BZP has amphetamine-like actions on the serotonin reuptake transporter, which increase serotonin concentrations in the extracellular fluids surrounding the cell and thereby increasing activation of the surrounding serotonin receptors. BZP has a lower potency effect on the noradrenaline reuptake transporter and the dopamine reuptake transporter. BZP has a high affinity action at the alpha2-adrenoreceptor, it is an antagonist at the receptor, like <b>yohimbine,</b> which inhibits negative feedback, causing an increase in released noradrenaline.|$|E
25|$|Cabergoline, an agonist of {{dopamine}} D₂ receptors which inhibits prolactin production, {{was found}} in a small study to fully restore orgasm in one third of anorgasmic subjects, and partially restore orgasm in another third. Limited data has shown that the drug amantadine may help to relieve SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction. Cyproheptadine, buspirone, stimulants such as amphetamines (including the antidepressant bupropion), nefazodone and <b>yohimbine</b> have been used to treat SSRI-induced anorgasmia. Reducing the SSRI dosage may also resolve anorgasmia problems.|$|E
25|$|After Reti's {{discovery}} (and naming) of candicine as {{a natural}} product, a series of pharmacological investigations was carried out on this alkaloid by Luduena. These are summarized in Reti's review: as before, the similarity of effects between candicine and nicotine was noted. In Luduena's experiments, candicine first stimulated, then blocked ganglionic transmission; its effects were not altered by <b>yohimbine,</b> cocaine, or atropine, but completely counteracted by sparteine or tetrapropylammonium iodide. No muscarinic action was seen. Doses of 6mg/kg were curare-like in the dog; similar effects were also observed in the toad, Bufo arenarum.|$|E
2500|$|The {{chemical}} structure of mitragynines incorporates {{the nucleus of}} the tryptamine, and these may be responsible for the molecules observed in the serotonin and adrenergic systems. [...] Mitragynine is structurally similar to <b>yohimbine</b> and voacangine.|$|E
2500|$|The NIH {{states that}} <b>yohimbine</b> {{hydrochloride}} {{has been shown}} in human studies to be possibly effective in the treatment of male impotence resulting from erectile dysfunction or SSRI usage (e.g., anorgasmia). [...] Published reports have shown it to be effective in the treatment of orgasmic dysfunction in men.|$|E
2500|$|Anesthesia {{in animals}} has many {{similarities}} to human anesthesia, but some differences as well. [...] Local anesthesia is primarily used for wound closure and removal of small tumors. Lidocaine, mepivacaine, and bupivacaine {{are the most}} commonly used local anesthetics used in veterinary medicine. Sedation without general anesthesia is used for more involved procedures. Sedatives commonly used include acepromazine, hydromorphine, midazolam, diazepam, xylazine, and medetomidine. α2 agonists like xylazine and medetomidine are especially useful because they can be reversed, xylazine by <b>yohimbine</b> and medetomidine by atipamezole. [...] Xylazine is approved for use in dogs, cats, horses, deer, and elk in the United States, while medetomidine is only approved for dogs.

2500|$|Co-administration of quinidine, {{a potent}} CYP2D6 inhibitor, with tramadol, a {{combination}} {{which results in}} markedly reduced levels of desmetramadol, was found not to significantly affect the analgesic effects of tramadol in human volunteers. However, other {{studies have found that}} the analgesic effects of tramadol are significantly decreased or even absent in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. The analgesic effects of tramadol are only partially reversed by naloxone in human volunteers, hence indicating that its opioid action is unlikely the sole factor; tramadol's analgesic effects are also partially reversed by α2-adrenergic receptor antagonists like <b>yohimbine,</b> the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist ondansetron, and the 5-HT7 receptor antagonists SB-269970 and SB-258719. Pharmacologically, tramadol is similar to tapentadol and methadone in that it not only binds to the MOR, but also inhibits the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine due to its action on the noradrenergic and serotonergic systems, such as its [...] "atypical" [...] opioid activity.|$|E
5000|$|Yohimbe (Pausinystalia johimbe) is a {{tree that}} grows in western and central Africa; <b>yohimbine</b> was {{originally}} extracted from the bark of yohimbe in 1896 by Adolph Spiegel. [...] In 1943 the correct constitution of <b>yohimbine</b> was proposed by Witkop. Fifteen years later, Van Tamelen used a 23-step synthesis {{to become the first}} person to achieve the synthesis of <b>yohimbine.</b>|$|E
50|$|Depending on dosage, <b>yohimbine</b> {{can either}} {{increase}} or decrease systemic blood pressure (through vasoconstriction or vasodilation, respectively). Because <b>yohimbine</b> has highest affinity for the α2 receptor, small doses can increase blood pressure by causing a relatively selective α2 blockade. <b>Yohimbine</b> also, however, interacts with α1 receptors, albeit with lower affinity; therefore, at higher doses an α1 blockade can occur and overwhelm {{the effects of the}} α2 blockade, leading to a potentially dangerous drop in blood pressure.Higher doses of oral <b>yohimbine</b> may create numerous side effects, such as rapid heart rate, overstimulation, anomalous blood pressure, cold sweating, and insomnia.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{antidepressants}} function {{partly as}} selective alpha-2 blockers, but the best-known drug {{in that class}} is <b>yohimbine,</b> which is extracted from the bark of the African yohimbe tree. [...] <b>Yohimbine</b> acts as a male potency enhancer, but its usefulness for that purpose is limited by serious side-effects including anxiety and insomnia. [...] Overdoses can cause a dangerous increase in blood pressure. [...] <b>Yohimbine</b> is banned in many countries, but in the United States, because it is extracted from a plant rather than chemically synthesized, it is sold over the counter as a nutritional supplement.|$|E
50|$|Examples include atipamezole, efaroxan, idazoxan, <b>yohimbine,</b> and rauwolscine, Phentolamine.|$|E

50|$|Some monoterpenoid indole {{alkaloids}} also {{interact with}} adrenoceptors. For example, ajmalicine is a selective antagonist of α1-adrenergic receptors and therefore has antihypertensive action. <b>Yohimbine</b> is more selective to α2 adrenoceptor; by blocking presynaptic α2-adrenoceptors, {{it increases the}} release of norepinephrine thereby raising the blood pressure. <b>Yohimbine</b> {{was used for the}} treatment of erectile dysfunction in men until emergence of more efficient drugs.|$|E
50|$|Compounds {{contained}} in Alchornea floribunda include Alchorneine, Alchorneinone, Alkaloids, Anthranilic acid, Gentisinic acid, Isoalchorneine and <b>Yohimbine.</b>|$|E
50|$|Yohimbe extracts, {{which contain}} <b>yohimbine,</b> {{have been used}} in {{traditional}} medicine and marketed as dietary supplements.|$|E
50|$|<b>Yohimbine</b> {{has high}} {{affinity}} for the α2-adrenergic receptor, moderate {{affinity for the}} α1 receptor, 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D, 5-HT1F, 5-HT2B, and D2 receptors, and weak affinity for the 5-HT1E, 5-HT2A, 5-HT5A, 5-HT7, and D3 receptors. It behaves as an antagonist at α1-adrenergic, α2-adrenergic, 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and D2, and as a partial agonist at 5-HT1A. <b>Yohimbine</b> interacts with serotonin and dopamine receptors in high concentrations.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Yohimbine</b> (...) is an indole {{alkaloid}} {{derived from}} the bark of the Pausinystalia yohimbe tree in Central Africa.

50|$|<b>Yohimbine</b> {{is a drug}} used in {{veterinary}} medicine to reverse the effects of xylazine in dogs and deer.|$|E
50|$|Corynanthine {{acts as an}} α1-adrenergic and α2-adrenergic {{receptor}} antagonist {{with approximately}} 10-fold selectivity for the former site over the latter. This {{is in contrast to}} <b>yohimbine</b> and rauwolscine which have around 30-fold higher affinity for α2-adrenergic over α1-adrenergic. As a result, corynanthine is not a stimulant (or an aphrodisiac for that matter), but a depressant, and likely plays a role in the antihypertensive properties of Rauwolfia extracts. Like <b>yohimbine</b> and rauwolscine, corynanthine has also been shown to possess some activity at serotonin receptors.|$|E
50|$|In {{non-human}} species {{this is an}} immobilizing and anesthetic drug, presumptively also {{mediated by}} α2 adrenergic receptors because it is reversed by <b>yohimbine,</b> an α2 antagonist.|$|E
50|$|Other drugs {{which may}} be helpful in the {{treatment}} of this condition include dopamine agonists, oxytocin, phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors, and alpha-2 receptor blockers like <b>yohimbine.</b>|$|E
50|$|Xylazine {{is often}} used as a sedative, muscle relaxant, and analgesic. It is {{frequently}} used {{in the treatment of}} tetanus. Xylazine is very similar to drugs such as phenothiazine, tricyclic antidepressants, and clonidine. As an anesthetic, it is typically used in conjunction with ketamine. Xylazine appears to reduce sensitivity to insulin and glucose uptake in humans. <b>Yohimbine</b> has been used to decrease glucose levels to a healthy level. In clinical settings, <b>Yohimbine</b> can reverse the adverse effects of xylazine if administered intravenously at a dosage of 0.5 mL / 20 pounds shortly after xylazine administration.|$|E
50|$|Rauvolfia serpentina The plant {{contains}} 200 alkaloids of the indole alkaloid family. The major alkaloids are ajmaline, ajmalicine, ajmalimine, deserpidine, indobine, indobinine, reserpine, reserpiline, rescinnamine, rescinnamidine, serpentine, serpentinine and <b>yohimbine.</b>|$|E
50|$|Medications and herbal {{supplements}} {{that affect}} body temperature and blood flow may cause piloerection. For example, {{one of the}} common reported side effects of the intake of <b>Yohimbine</b> HCL is piloerection.|$|E

50|$|Yohimban is a {{chemical}} compound. It is the base chemical structure of various alkaloids in the Rauwolfia and Pausinystalia plant genera, including <b>yohimbine,</b> rauwolscine, corynanthine, ajmalicine, reserpine, deserpidine, and rescinnamine, among others.|$|E
50|$|Ajmalicine is {{structurally}} {{related to}} <b>yohimbine,</b> rauwolscine, and other yohimban derivatives. Like corynanthine, {{it acts as}} a α1-adrenergic receptor antagonist with preferential actions over α2-adrenergic receptors, underlying its hypotensive rather than hypertensive effects.|$|E
50|$|Loganic acid is an iridoid {{substrate}} {{converted to}} strictosidine which reacts with tryptamine, eventually {{leading to the}} indole alkaloids which include many biologically active compounds such as strychnine, <b>yohimbine,</b> vinca alkaloids, and ellipticine.|$|E
5000|$|The {{chemical}} structure of mitragynines incorporates {{the nucleus of}} the tryptamine, and these may be responsible for the molecules observed in the serotonin and adrenergic systems. [...] Mitragynine is structurally similar to <b>yohimbine</b> and voacangine.|$|E
5000|$|The main active {{ingredient}} in the extract is <b>yohimbine.</b> Yohimbe extract also contains other alkaloids with undefined properties, adding to concern about its safety. Among other alkaloids is corynanthine, an alpha-1 adrenergic receptor blocker and raubasine.|$|E
50|$|Multiple {{drugs have}} been used as {{supportive}} therapeutic intervention such as lidocaine, naloxone, thiamine, lorazepam, vecuronium, etomidate, propofol, tolazoline, <b>yohimbine,</b> atropine, naloxone, orciprenaline, metoclopramide, ranitidine, metoprolol, enoxaparin, flucloxacillin, insulin, and irrigation of both eyes with saline. Effects of xylazine are also reversed by the analeptics 4-aminopyridine, doxapram, and caffeine, which are physiological antagonists to central nervous system depressants. Combining <b>yohimbine</b> and 4-aminopyridine in an effort to antagonize xylazine is superior as compared to the administration of either of these drugs individually due to reduction of recovery time. Research initiatives may be necessary in order to standardize treatment and determine effective measures for identifying chronic xylazine usage and intoxication.|$|E
50|$|Its {{effects can}} be {{reversed}} using atipamezole (distributed as Antisedan by Pfizer). IV use of atipamezole is not licensed, IM is the preferred route. <b>Yohimbine</b> may also be used in an emergency situation, but is not licensed.|$|E
50|$|Historically, <b>yohimbine</b> {{was used}} as an aphrodisiac, and is still {{sometimes}} used in veterinary medicine (although now largely replaced by atipamezole) for reversing the effects of alpha-2 agonists such as medetomidine which are used as sedatives during surgery.|$|E
