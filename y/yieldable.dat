5000|$|Support system proposed: Fibre-reinforced {{concrete}} (100-300mm or 0-10 inch thick) {{combined with}} rock bolt (26.50mm dia, 5,000-9,000mm or 200-350 inch long) {{has been proposed}} as the principal support system. In areas of poor rock condition, <b>yieldable</b> steel ribs (ISMB 150/ISMB 300) have been proposed in addition.|$|E
30|$|The <b>yieldable</b> {{circular}} supports {{are also}} called the <b>yieldable</b> enclosed supports, which include horseshoe-shaped (Fig.  8 c), circle-shaped (Fig.  8 d), and square- or rectangular-shaped types. The <b>yieldable</b> arches and trapezium supports stated above are open in the floor, and cannot control the floor deformation. The <b>yieldable</b> circular supports forms an enclosed ring, which can not only increase their bearing capacity, but also restrain the floor heave effectively. These <b>yieldable</b> circular supports are applicable to roadways in soft rocks with high stresses and large deformation, especially large floor heave.|$|E
30|$|The <b>yieldable</b> {{trapezium}} support, {{compared with}} the <b>yieldable</b> arch support, behaves poor mechanical performance. However, it still has some advantages under certain conditions: no damage to roof, high utilization ratio of cross-section area, simple structure, easy processing and transportation. When the horizontal stress is not high, and the roadway cross-section is pretty small, <b>yieldable</b> trapezium supports can be applied.|$|E
30|$|<b>Yieldable</b> {{supports}} can {{be divided}} into three types by shape, that is arch, trapezium, and circular types. The <b>yieldable</b> steel supports most widely used in Chinese coal mines are U-shaped <b>yieldable</b> steel supports. U-shaped steel has a good cross-section shape and reasonable geometric parameters, and can retract easily when two parts overlap together. As long as the design is reasonable, good mechanical performance of steel supports can be acquired. The U-shaped steel widely used for <b>yieldable</b> supports in Chinese coal mines are U 25, U 29, and U 36.|$|E
30|$|Rigid {{supports}} {{themselves are}} not <b>yieldable,</b> or slightly <b>yieldable.</b> Only when the steel supports punch into the floor, the wooden blocks in the joints of steel supports deform, and the steel supports deflect, limited displacements appear, therefore, rigid supports are applicable to roadways with small displacements.|$|E
30|$|A <b>yieldable</b> steel arch is {{composed}} of a roof beam, legs, and connecting elements (Fig.  8 b). The roof beam is an arc structure, generally consisting {{of one or two}} segments. There are two types of legs: the first one consists of an arc segment in the upper part, and a straight segment in the bottom part; the other one consists of all curved segments. <b>Yieldable</b> steel arches can be divided into three-segment, four-segment, five-segment and more segment types according to the number of segments, in which, three-segment and four-segment types are used widely.|$|E
40|$|During {{the period}} of 2004 / 05 - 2007 / 08 in Strumica region {{examinations}} were conducted with ten genotypes soft winter wheat (Triticum aestivum spp. vulgare) : milenka, bistra, lizinka, altana, mila, orovanka, olga, agrounija prima, podobrena orovcanka and pelisterka. The main aim was to determine their production characteristics in conditions of organic production and to recommend the most <b>yieldable</b> varieties for organic production in Republic of Macedonia and the region. Irrespective the climatic conditions in the years of examination, the most <b>yieldable</b> are the varieties mila (7380 kg/ha), bistra (6945 kg/ha) and agrounija prima (6875 kg/ha). These genotypes are most suitable for organic system of production for reaching relatively high yield. These varieties could also surve as future genetic material in plant breeding for creating new genotypes suitable for organic production Key words: wheat; organic; varieties; yield. ...|$|E
30|$|Germany {{has some}} of the deepest coal mines in the world, and the leading strata control {{technology}} for deep roadways (Shi et al. 2009, 2013). In the matter of roadway support technology, combined supports with <b>yieldable</b> steel arches and rock bolting, and backfilling beside the roadways and behind the steel arches are well studied and widely applied.|$|E
30|$|Based on the geomechanics {{properties}} of rocks surrounding roadways, a parameter representing the general characteristics of rocks was proposed to classify {{the stability of}} rocks. The surrounding rocks were divided into five grades, and each grade was subdivided into 2 sub-grades. Roadway support patterns and parameters can be determined according to the rock grades. Rock bolts or <b>yieldable</b> steel arches are fit for stable rocks; combined supports with steel arches, rock bolts and cables, are necessary for the instable rocks.|$|E
30|$|Backfilling behind {{supports}} {{can improve}} the loading state of steel supports, and greatly enhance their bearing capacity (Luo 2009; Xie et al. 2010). Backfilling was applied in the roadways surrounded by soft rocks in the Huainan and the Tiefa coal mining districts, compared with the case without backfilling, the working resistance of steel supports increased by 5 times, the roadway displacement decreased by 90  %. Therefore, for roadways at depth and under complex conditions, backfilling is necessary {{to fill the gap}} behind the <b>yieldable</b> steel supports.|$|E

30|$|The {{combination}} of rock bolting and steel supports {{is commonly used}} in complex roadways. According to the construction sequence, this combination support {{can be divided into}} two types: one is installing bolts (or cables) first, then setting steel supports; another is setting steel supports first, then installing bolts (or cables) between the steel supports. Bolts and cables can be used with various steel supports, such as I-shaped steel supports, <b>yieldable</b> steel arches, and enclosed steel supports. Bolts or cables can individually be combined with steel supports (Tian et al. 2011), bolts and cables can also be together used with steel supports.|$|E
40|$|Big Bell Mine {{started using}} the Cone bolt as a <b>yieldable</b> support to combat {{rockburst}} in September 1999. Australia has little experience of mining in rockburst conditions {{which makes the}} ground support requirements a new experience to all involved. Much work went into {{the design of the}} support patterns and the sequence of operations. The workforce required training in installation procedures, the theory behind yielding support and in the importance of good quality installation practices.

30|$|The {{connecting}} element {{is the key}} part to make steel supports <b>yieldable.</b> The steel support should maintain certain resistance force when it retracts, which can not only accommodate some rock deformation, but also restrain too large rock deformation to keep roadways stable. To meet the requirements mentioned above, the mechanical performance of the {{connecting element}} is very important. Any connecting element contains a lock unit and a friction unit. The lock unit binds the overlapping part of two segments in the support and offers compressive force. When the steel support overcomes the frictions between two segments of U-shaped steel and the connecting element, it will retract. According to the locking units, the connecting elements {{can be divided into}} bolt and wedge types. Bolt connecting elements can be subdivided into three types: a U-shaped bolt with clamping plate, double U-shaped clamping plates, and pushing bolt. Wedge connecting elements can also be subdivided into three types: wedge block (single-wedge or two-wedges), ear-shaped wedge, and buckled wedge.|$|E
30|$|The steel {{supports}} used in German {{coal mines}} {{can be divided}} into four types according to their shapes: (1) U-shape steel arches (open in the floor); (2) U-shape steel arches with a <b>yieldable</b> inverted-arch component in the floor; (3) ring steel supports; (4) rectangular steel supports. The first type is applicable to various gateroads, the second type is applicable to haulage roadways, the third type is applicable to development roadways, and the rectangular support is applicable to the open-off cuts. In Germany, the importance of backfilling behind the supports is stressed especially in the interaction relations between supports and surrounding rocks. Backfilling behind the supports makes the steel supports fully contact with rock surface, increases the stiffness of media transferring resistance forces from steel supports to surrounding rocks, and greatly improves the performance of the steel supports. Testing results showed that backfilling can increase the bearing capacity of steel supports by more than one time.|$|E
40|$|As {{the mining}} depth {{increases}} year by year, the deformation and failure of deep roadway {{become more and}} more serious, and new support equipment with high supporting force and <b>yieldable</b> character is quite necessary for mining safety. In this research, a new yielding steel prop with high stable load capacity was introduced, which features sustaining large deformation in the field. Based on principle stress method and elastic-plastic theory, a mathematical model of load capacity was proposed for the new prop. The results show that the stable load capacity of the prop increases linearly with the increase of the effective number of the steel balls. Meanwhile, the stable load capacity of the prop increases initially and decreases afterwards with the increase of the radius of the steel ball. Under the fixed radius of the steel ball, the stable load capacity will increase with the decrease of the gap between the inner tube and the outer tube. The stable load capacity of the prop calculated using the theoretical model quantitatively agrees with that of the experimental tests, with only an error within 5 %...|$|E
40|$|In this investigation, a new bench-scale {{electrocoagulation}} reactor (FCER) {{has been}} applied for drinking water denitrification. FCER utilises the concepts of flow column to mix and aerate the water. The water being treated flows through the perforated aluminium disks electrodes, thereby efficiently mixing and aerating the water. As a result, FCER reduces the need for external stirring and aerating devices, which until now {{have been widely used}} in the electrocoagulation reactors. Therefore, FCER could be a promising cost-effective alternative to the traditional lab-scale EC reactors. A comprehensive study has been commenced to investigate the performance of the new reactor. This includes the application of FCER to remove nitrate from drinking water. Estimation of the produced amount of H 2 gas and the <b>yieldable</b> energy from it, an estimation of its preliminary operating cost, and a SEM (scanning electron microscope) investigation of the influence of the EC process on the morphology of the surface of electrodes. Additionally, an empirical model was developed to reproduce the nitrate removal performance of the FCER. The results obtained indicated that the FCER reduced the nitrate concentration from 100 to 15  mg/L (World Health Organization limitations for infants) after 55  min of electrolysing at initial pH of 7, GBE of 5  mm, CD of 2  mA/cm(2), and at operating cost of 0. 455  US $/m(3). Additionally, it was found that FCER emits H 2 gas enough to generate a power of 1. 36  kW/m(3). Statistically, the relationship between the operating parameters and nitrate removal could be modelled with R(2) of 0. 848. The obtained SEM images showed a large number dents on anode's surface due to the production of aluminium hydroxides...|$|E
