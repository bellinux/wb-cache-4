40|$|ABSTRACTThe {{efficiency}} of yard operations {{is critical to}} the overall productivity of a container terminal because the yard serves as the interface between the landside and waterside operations. Most container terminals use <b>yard</b> <b>cranes</b> to transfer containers between the yard and trucks (both external and internal). To facilitate vessel operations, an efficient work schedule for the <b>yard</b> <b>cranes</b> is necessary given varying work volumes among yard blocks with different planning periods. This paper investigated an agent-based approach to assign and relocate <b>yard</b> <b>cranes</b> among <b>yard</b> blocks based on the forecasted work volumes. The goal of our study is to reduce the work volume that remains incomplete {{at the end of a}} planning period. We offered several preference functions for <b>yard</b> <b>cranes</b> and blocks which are modeled as agents. These preference functions are designed to find effective schedules for <b>yard</b> <b>cranes.</b> In addition, we examined various rules for the initial assignment of <b>yard</b> <b>cranes</b> to blocks. Our analysis demonstrated that our model can effectively and efficiently reduce the percentage of incomplete work volume for any real-world sized problem...|$|R

In this paper, the <b>yard</b> <b>cranes</b> are confined to rail mounted gantry cranes (RMGC), which are characterized by the restricted traveling range {{on a pair of}} rails. Since RMGCs and yard blocks are tightly bound to each other, when allocating them, we should make sure that the RMGCs allocated for a yard activity are able to together cover the blocks allocated for the corresponding yard activity. In addition, considering that there are four basic activities occurring in the yard which compete with each other for the scarce resources and have different requirements and priorities in the allocation of blocks and <b>yard</b> <b>cranes,</b> we treat them in a single model rather than in multiple independent models as were generally done in literature.

40|$|As {{more and}} more {{container}} terminals open {{up all over the}} world, terminal operators are discovering that they must increase quay crane work rates to remain competitive. In this paper, we develop a real-time <b>yard</b> <b>crane</b> control system and show that a terminal&# 039;s long-run average quay crane rate depends on the portion of this system that dispatches yard cranes in the storage area in real time. Several real-time <b>yard</b> <b>crane</b> dispatching systems are evaluated by a fully-integrated, discrete event simulation model of a pure transshipment terminal that is designed to reproduce the multi-objective, stochastic, real-time environment at an RTGC-based, multiple-berth facility.

40|$|Abstract—Effective and {{efficient}} scheduling of <b>yard</b> <b>crane</b> operations {{is essential to}} guarantee a smooth and fast container flow in a container terminal, thus leading to a high terminal throughput. This paper studies the problem of scheduling yard cranes to perform a given set of loading and unloading jobs with different ready times in a yard zone. In particular, the inter-crane interference between adjacent yard cranes which results in the movement of a <b>yard</b> <b>crane</b> being blocked by adjacent yard cranes is studied. The objective is to minimize the sum of <b>yard</b> <b>crane</b> completing times. Since the scheduling problem is NP-complete, a new hybrid optimization algorithm combining the techniques of genetic algorithm and tabu search method (GA-TS) is proposed to solve the challenging problem.
