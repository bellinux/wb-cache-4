5|$|The telenovela {{features}} Facundo Arana and Natalia Oreiro, {{who both}} {{appeared in the}} successful telenovela Muñeca Brava, as lead actors. The {{relationship between the two}} was more than professional; Facundo Arana had spontaneously been offered a guest appearance on the Russian series A ritmo de tango starring Oreiro. Both actors agreed to appear in <b>You</b> <b>Are</b> <b>the</b> <b>One</b> on the condition that they worked together. As a result, the program design was decided only after both were confirmed in the leading roles. Oreiro delayed filming proposals in Israel, Spain, and Uruguay, and the recording of her fourth music album to join the project. As in Muñeca Brava, the narrative of <b>You</b> <b>Are</b> <b>the</b> <b>One</b> revolves around a wealthy suitor and a poor woman, but unlike the former program it does not concentrate all the characters on a single narrative context. <b>You</b> <b>Are</b> <b>the</b> <b>One</b> organizes two contexts for both the rich and the poor, each one with its own characteristic locations and supporting characters.|$|E

500|$|Zacharias {{was born}} in Madras, India. He is descended from {{a woman of the}} Nambudiri Brahmin caste and a Christian man of the Boatman caste. His mother was from Madras (now Chennai) while his father was from Kerala. He grew up in Delhi. According to Zacharias, before her marriage, Swiss German missionaries had spoken to his Brahmin {{ancestor}} about Christianity and she had converted and had been made an outcast by her Brahmin family and community. Zacharias grew up in a nominal Anglican household, and says that he was an atheist until the age of 17 when he tried to commit suicide by swallowing poison. While in the hospital, a local Christian worker brought him a Bible and told his mother to read to him from John 14. [...] Zacharias says that it was [...] that touched him and meant to him as the defining paradigm: [...] "Because I live, you also will live." [...] He said that he thought, [...] "This may be my only hope: A new way of living. Life as defined by the Author of Life." [...] and that he committed his life to Christ praying, [...] "Jesus if <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> who gives life as it is meant to be, I want it. Please get me out of this hospital bed well, and I promise I will leave no stone unturned in my pursuit of truth." [...] In 1966 Zacharias emigrated with his family to Canada, earning his undergraduate degree from the Ontario Bible College in 1972 (now Tyndale University College & Seminary) and his M.Div. from Trinity International University. In 1990 Mr. Zacharias did a 2-3 month sabbatical at Ridley Hall in the town of Cambridge. Zacharias has multiple honorary doctoral degrees.|$|E

2500|$|On an {{occasion}} in 628, Wang was attending a feast held by Emperor Taizong, when a beautiful concubine of Emperor Taizong's, who was originally a concubine of Li Yuan the Prince of Lujiang {{and who was}} taken into Emperor Taizong's palace after Li Yuan was executed, was attending to Emperor Taizong. [...] Emperor Taizong stated, [...] "The Prince of Lujiang was despicable. [...] He killed her husband and seized her. [...] How could he survive long after this barbarous act!" [...] Wang instead responded, [...] "Does Your Imperial Majesty believe that the Prince of Lujiang was correct in seizing this woman?" [...] Emperor Taizong responded, [...] "Why do you ask me whether it is correct to kill a woman's husband and seize her?" [...] Wang responded, [...] "I had once read from the writings of Guan Zhong, which stated, 'When Duke Huan of Qi visited the land of Guo , he asked the seniors of Guo, [...] "Why was Guo destroyed?" [...] The seniors stated, [...] "The lord of Guo knew right from wrong." [...] Duke Huan responded, [...] "If you are correct, then he was an intelligent ruler. [...] Why was he destroyed?" [...] The seniors responded, [...] "The lord of Guo knew what was right but could not do it. [...] He also knew what was wrong but could not stop doing it. [...] That was why he was destroyed."'

[...] Although Emperor Taizong could not send away the woman, he was nevertheless humbled by Wang's words and respected him for his words. [...] On another occasion, there was an incident where Emperor Taizong had the official Zu Xiaosun (祖孝孫) teach his ladies in waiting music, and when the ladies in waiting could not learn it well, rebuked Zu. [...] Wang and Wen Yanbo spoke against the rebuke, stating that it was not appropriate for Emperor Taizong to have had an important official become a music teacher for ladies in waiting in the first place. [...] Emperor Taizong became angry and rebuked Wen and Wang. [...] Wen bowed and begged for forgiveness, but Wang refused to do so, stating to Emperor Taizong that the rebuke to him and Wen was not warranted as they were reporting what was true. [...] Emperor Taizong was surprised, but the next day indicated to the high-level officials that he was rash and improper in rebuking Wang and Wen.|$|E
