50|$|<b>You</b> <b>Got</b> <b>Yours!</b> East Bay Garage 1965-1967 is a {{compilation}} album featuring American garage rock bands that {{were active in}} the San Francisco Bay area between 1965 and 1967. It was released on September 18, 2007 on Big Beat Records and is the twenty-third installment of the Nuggets from the Golden State album series. Generally overshadowed by the garage scenes located in Los Angeles and San Jose, the San Francisco scene was uniquely influenced by the surplus of folk rock, which would eventually develop into psychedelic rock. For the most part, the groups presented on <b>You</b> <b>Got</b> <b>Yours!</b> do not exemplify the teenage-angst and rawness associated with the garage rock genre, but rather display a level of professionalism not expected from an adolescent band.|$|R

[...] appears on Pebbles, Volume 10 and <b>You</b> <b>Got</b> <b>Yours!</b> East Bay Garage 1965 - 1967, and [...] "All the Time" [...] is featured on Pebbles, Volume 11: Northern California.|$|R

However, on May 20, 2003, {{it was announced}} that the release would be on June 17, 2003, only to be pushed back once again to July 27. Before the DVD's release, Tom Araya commented, [...] "I don't think it's different than any other Slayer show, <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>your</b> kids doing the mosh stuff. They get crazy, they tear the place up. And then you get the one kid that's tempted to jump off the balcony. Whether he does it or not is another story. When they do, of course they get hurt, but they always insist on staying so they can watch the rest of the show, then they go to the emergency room." [...] On July 25, 2003, four days before its release, MTV announced the DVD's contents.|$|E

2500|$|Holden's first {{starring}} role was in Golden Boy (1939), costarring Barbara Stanwyck, {{in which he}} played a violinist-turned-boxer. He was still an unknown actor at the time, while Stanwyck was already a film star. She liked Holden and went {{out of her way}} to help him succeed, devoting her personal time to coaching and encouraging him, which made them into lifelong friends. When she received her Honorary Oscar at the 1982 Academy Award ceremony, Holden had died in an accident just a few months prior. At the end of her acceptance speech, she paid him a personal tribute: [...] "I loved him very much, and I miss him. He always wished that I would get an Oscar.

After a series of unsteady daily performances, {{he was about to}} be fired, but Stanwyck staunchly defended him, successfully standing up to the film producers. Shortly after Holden's death, Stanwyck recalled the moment when receiving her honorary Oscar: [...] "A few years ago I stood on this stage with William Holden as a presenter. I loved him very much, and I miss him. He always wished that I would get an Oscar. And so tonight, my golden boy, <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>your</b> wish." ...|$|E
