5|$|I {{think you}} will {{recognise}} {{that it was necessary}} to get rid of Brunetto for two reasons. The first is that the visionary figure has now become somewhat more definite and will no doubt be identified by some readers with Yeats though I do not mean anything so precise as that. However, I do not wish to take the responsibility of putting Yeats or anybody else into Hell and I do not want to impute to him the particular vice which took Brunetto there. Secondly, although the reference to that Canto is intended to be explicit, I wish the effect of the whole to be Purgatorial which is more appropriate. That brings us to the reference to swimming in fire which <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>remember</b> at the end of Purgatorio 26 where the poets are found.|$|E
25|$|I {{put before}} the whole House my own views with an appalling frankness. From 1933, I {{and my friends}} were all very worried about what was {{happening}} in Europe. <b>You</b> <b>will</b> <b>remember</b> at that time the Disarmament Conference was sitting in Geneva. <b>You</b> <b>will</b> <b>remember</b> at that time there was probably a stronger pacifist feeling running through the country {{than at any time since}} the War. I am speaking of 1933 and 1934. <b>You</b> <b>will</b> <b>remember</b> the election at Fulham in the autumn of 1933...That was the feeling of the country in 1933. My position as a leader of a great party was not altogether a comfortable one. I asked myself what chance was there...within the next year or two of that feeling being so changed that the country would give a mandate for rearmament? Supposing I had gone to the country and said that Germany was rearming and we must rearm, does anybody think that this pacific democracy would have rallied to that cry at that moment! I cannot think of anything that would have made the loss of the election from my point of view more certain...We got from the country – with a large majority – a mandate for doing a thing that no one, twelve months before, would have believed possible.|$|E
25|$|If {{you recall}} my would-be Sherlock Holmesian {{assessment}} of Professor Moriarty's – sorry , Professor Illingworth's – plan {{to recapture the}} Ashes, <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>remember</b> {{that it is in}} Sydney, in the Fourth Test, that this cricketing chess player is due to strike and then retire to the corner of his web and seal off reprisals. Those who command the condition of Sydney Cricket Ground and its accessories gave him just the pitch he needed. By this time, I fancy, they were nauseated by negation and demanded a win at any price – even at the price of Australian defeat.|$|E

25|$|That same day, Ipomadon is {{told that}} his mother is dying; he returns to Apulia and learns from her on her deathbed {{that he has a}} {{half-brother}}. Much later in the tale we learn that the name of this half-brother is Cabanus and there is a grand recognition scene between Ipomadon and his brother {{at the very end of}} the story. Cabanus is living at King Meleager's court in Sicily, who, <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>remember,</b> is the Proud's uncle, and, following his abrupt departure from this proud teenager's queenly court and a season of jousting in far-flung corners of Christendom, Ipomadon arrives in Sicily and to King Maleager's court, becoming known at once as the queen's favourite, perhaps even her lover. But he again becomes a figure of fun among the other noblemen for his (feigned) dislike of jousting in favour of hunting.|$|E
2500|$|A 1941 biographical film {{entitled}} <b>You</b> <b>Will</b> <b>Remember</b> about Stuart starred Robert Morley as Stuart. It features {{several of}} Stuart's songs. Stuart's songs {{have been used}} in over a dozen other films. A bronzed plaster plaque of Stuart, made by John Cassidy, was placed in the Manchester Central Library in April 1939, inscribed [...] "A son of Manchester who moved the nation to song".|$|E
2500|$|Further, Pallett writes, in the song's bridge, Perry adds more {{complexity}} to the song—and {{makes it more}} memorable, in his opinion—by taking the simple step of singing the [...] "let you {{put your hands on}} me in my skintight jeans" [...] lyrics entirely on beat, including the reiteration of the song's title. [...] "How brilliant. The title of the song is rhythmically weighted two ways—it's like a flank attack. Two sides of the same face. <b>You</b> <b>WILL</b> <b>remember</b> the name of this song." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{his text}} Buddho Ajahn Thate {{describes}} {{what it is}} like when the mind has finally rid itself of preoccupation with sensual distractions and is able to focus on the breath, mantra, or a part of the body, in meditation: [...] "When you first enter concentration, this is what it's like: [...] You'll have no idea at all of what concentration or one-pointedness of mind is going to feel like. You are simply intent on keeping mindfulness firmly focused on one object – and the power of a mind focused firmly on one object is what will bring you to a state of concentration. You won't be thinking at all that concentration will be like this or like that, or that {{you want it to be}} like this or like that. It will simply take its own way, automatically. No one can force it. At that moment you will feel as if you are in another world (the world of the mind), with a sense of ease and solitude to which nothing else in the world can compare. When the mind withdraws from concentration, you will regret that that mood has passed, and <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>remember</b> it clearly. All that we say about concentration comes from the mind which has withdrawn from that state. As long as it is still gathered in that state, we aren't interested in what anyone else says or does. You have to train the mind to enter this sort of concentration often, so as to become skilled and adept, but don't try to remember your past states of concentration, and don't let yourself want your concentration to be like it was before – because it won't be that way, and you will just be making more trouble for yourself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; {{you love}} me, and I you; {{but not with}} love that may show itself in that form. That was the old love, which I threw away, and which has been lost.
