40|$|The {{purpose of}} this brief note is to present an {{infinite}} dimensional family of exact solutions of the incompressible three-dimensional Euler equations ∂tu + u · ∇u + ∇p = 0, ∇ · u = 0. (1) The solutions we present have infinite kinetic energy and blow up in finite time. Blow up of other similar infinite energy solutions of Euler equations has been proved before ([1], [2]). The particular type of solution we will describe was proposed in ([3]). The Eulerian-Lagrangian approach we take ([4]) is not restricted to this particular case, but exact integration of the equations is. We will consider a two dimensional basic square Q of side L. The particular form of the solutions ([3]) is u(x, <b>y,</b> z, <b>t)</b> = (u(x, <b>y,</b> <b>t),</b> zγ(x, <b>y,</b> <b>t))</b> (2) where the scalar valued function γ is periodic in both spatial variables with period L and the two dimensional vector u(x, <b>y,</b> <b>t)</b> = (u 1 (x, <b>y,</b> <b>t),</b> u 2 (x, <b>y,</b> <b>t))</b> is also periodic with the same period.

Employing a multiple strategy of methodology, comprising participant comprehension, questionnaires and interviews with key informants, the changing nature of the school-work transition and local labour markets, is identified in the attitudes and actions of those working on and participating in the <b>Y.</b> <b>T.</b> S. A major focus of the project was the evaluation {{of the role of the}} supervisor working on the <b>Y.</b> <b>T.</b> S. The work of the local Accredited Centre (A. C.) charged with training the trainers was examined as was the work of nine supervisors working on eight selected schemes. As a consequence of this the progression of trainees incorporated in the study from the <b>Y.</b> <b>T.</b> S. was analysed. By identifying and analysing the manner in which a number of individuals managed the rapid change brought about by the <b>Y.</b> <b>T.</b> S. the research concluded that the <b>Y.</b> <b>T.</b> S. both perpetuated and created divisions in local labour markets reinforcing the significance of educational qualifications as a predictor of success both on and of the <b>Y.</b> <b>T.</b> S. A hierarchy of schemes evolved with high status schemes being those with prior involvement in recognised and regarded forms of training. It became apparent that the differing market and work situation (Lockwood, 1966, p. 15) of supervisors represented an image to trainees of their future. Ultimately the <b>Y.</b> <b>T.</b> S. must be regarded as the first shift in training policy, introduced by the post 1979 Conservative Governments, marking the beginning of a broader strategy linked to the management of the economy and unemployment. The state took on a major role in stipulating and directing training policy which was organised on a contractual basis locally. Within that strategy it was the individual who was deemed to be culpable for their lack of skills or unemployment.
