500|$|Vitagraph's {{recommended}} {{music for}} A Cure for Pokeritis began with [...] "I'm Glad I'm Married" [...] and [...] "I've Got My Eyes on You". The studio suggested either [...] "I Don't Believe You" [...] or [...] "I'm an Honorary Member of the Patsy Club" [...] be played as George presented his purported lodge membership. His sleep-talking {{was to be}} accompanied by [...] "If You Talk in <b>Your</b> <b>Sleep,</b> Don't Mention My Name", followed by [...] "Back to the Factory, Mary" [...] as Freddie investigates. [...] "Whoops, My Dear" [...] was to score the police raid, and [...] "Don't Take Me Home" [...] would play as the film ended.|$|E
2500|$|Mary Dell in the Daily Mirror of 19 May 1938 said, [...] "This {{is not a}} book I should {{recommend}} you to read last thing at night. The malignant eye of Mrs. Boynton might haunt <b>your</b> <b>sleep</b> and make a nightmare of your dreams. It's a pretty eerily bloodcurdling tale. A grand book." ...|$|E

2500|$|This is the {{processing}} of memories out of conscious awareness. [...] After you are finished reading something, for example this very article about sleep and memory, your brain continues to process the information even as you accomplish other tasks like playing a game of soccer. [...] This [...] "offline" [...] processing likewise occurs in <b>your</b> <b>sleep.</b>|$|E
2500|$|... "Swamp Girl" [...] {{is another}} entry with the [...] "Lorelei"/"Jezebel" [...] motif in the Laine songbook. In this decidedly gothic {{tale of a}} ghostly female spirit who inhabits a metaphorical [...] "swamp", the femme fatale {{attempts}} to lure the singer to his death, calling [...] "Come to the deep where <b>your</b> <b>sleep</b> is without a dream." [...] The swamp girl is voiced (in an obligato) by coloratura Loolie Jean Norman, who would later go on to provide a similar vocal for the theme song of the television series [...] The coloratura contrasts well with Laine's rough, masculine voice, and disembodied female voices would continue {{to appear in the}} background of many of his records, to great effect.|$|E
2500|$|In Dion's version, [...] "I Drove All Night" [...] is dance-pop. It {{was also}} {{considered}} [...] "{{a little bit}} dance-club, a little bit rock & roll." [...] Lyrically, she recalls a feverish trek for sexual gratification. She sings in the first verse, [...] "Maybe I should have called you first, but I was dying to get to you/I was dreaming while I drove the long, straight road ahead." [...] In the chorus, she sings, [...] "Woke you from <b>your</b> <b>sleep</b> {{to make love to}} you/Is that all right?/I drove all night." [...] In the second verse, Dion duplicates a line as it is heard in Orbison's original recording. Instead of singing, [...] "no matter where I go I hear the beating of our heart," [...] Dion sings, [...] "our one heart." [...] Like the original, the chorus is sung again twice, which ends the single.|$|E

2500|$|Speaking of Lopez's image, Andrew Barker of Variety observed: [...] "Despite a {{carefully}} cultivated image as an imperious pop empress in ludicrously expensive outfits, her signature hits bear the titles [...] "I'm Real" [...] and [...] "Jenny From the Block". She managed the perilous transition from actress to music star without ever seeming to pick {{either as a}} primary gig. She established herself as an oft-provocative sex symbol while her demeanor made it abundantly clear that she's {{not asking you to}} come hither." [...] In 2002, Lynette Holloway of The New York Times described Lopez as overexposed. She wrote: [...] "Forgive yourself if you are seeing Jennifer Lopez in <b>your</b> <b>sleep.</b> She is everywhere." [...] Holloway noted her image to be [...] "a dash of ghetto fabulousness" [...] and [...] "middle-class respectability" [...] for mass appeal. Entertainment Weekly observed a change in her public profile upon joining American Idol in 2011, writing: [...] "Gone was her old cut-a-bitch swagger; J. Lo 2.0 is an all-embracing, Oprahfied earth [...]" [...] Lopez is considered an icon of popular culture. Television presenter Ray Martin describes her as a [...] "showbiz phenomenon".|$|E
