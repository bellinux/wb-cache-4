2500|$|During 1936, von Braun's {{rocketry}} {{team working}} at Kummersdorf investigated installing liquid-fuelled rockets in aircraft. Ernst Heinkel enthusiastically supported their efforts, supplying a He-72 and later two He-112s for the experiments. Later in 1936, Erich Warsitz was seconded by the RLM to Wernher von Braun and Ernst Heinkel, {{because he had}} been {{recognized as one of the}} most experienced test-pilots of the time, and because he also had an extraordinary fund of technical knowledge. After he familiarized Warsitz with a test-stand run, showing him the corresponding apparatus in the aircraft, he asked: [...] "Are <b>you</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> and will you test the rocket in the air? Then, Warsitz, you will be a famous man. And later we will fly to the Moon – with you at the helm!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "We {{are glad}} to have <b>you</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> on any terms, and I take it as {{particularly}} kind, {{that you did not}} pass my door. You have been here some days?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{conductor}} came in. He {{had once}} called at Babbitt's office, {{to ask about}} houses. [...] "H' are you, Mr. Babbitt! We going to have <b>you</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> to Chicago? This your boy?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Leccisi {{left behind}} a note that said: [...] "Finally, O Duce, <b>you</b> are <b>with</b> <b>us.</b> We will cover <b>you</b> <b>with</b> roses but the smell of your virtue will {{overpower}} those roses." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "We {{should like}} <b>you</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> very much, Tim, {{if you make}} up your mind to go," [...] Ralph said; [...] "but the corps is quite full. We have refused dozens of recruits." ...|$|E
6000|$|But Charles, gallant as ever, {{replied with}} a smile, [...] "We have <b>you</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> for so short a time, you know!" [...] Which made Mrs. Forbes-Gaskell blush again that delicious blush of hers.|$|E

6000|$|... "Catholic {{virtue is}} often {{invisible}} {{because it is}} the normal," [...] answered MacIan. [...] "Christianity is always out of fashion because it is always sane; and all fashions are mild insanities. When Italy is mad on art the Church seems too Puritanical; when England is mad on Puritanism the Church seems too artistic. When <b>you</b> quarrel <b>with</b> <b>us</b> now <b>you</b> class <b>us</b> <b>with</b> kingship and despotism; but when <b>you</b> quarrelled <b>with</b> <b>us</b> first it was because we would not accept the divine despotism of Henry VIII. The Church always seems to be behind the times, when it is really beyond the times; it is waiting till the last fad shall have seen its last summer. It keeps the key of a permanent virtue." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I believe there's some fete {{or other}} to-morrow," [...] he said, [...] "but we're alone this evening. Why won't <b>you</b> dine <b>with</b> <b>us,</b> {{say at the}} Carlton?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Will <b>you</b> come <b>with</b> <b>us,</b> Monsieur Poirot? We {{are going}} through my mother's papers. Mr. Inglethorp is quite willing to leave it entirely to Mr. Wells and myself." ...|$|R
