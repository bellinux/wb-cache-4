This effectively assumes that Jesus family in <b>NT</b> <b>did</b> indeed <b>have</b> a family tomb and it was among the 1000 tombs found in Jerusalem area. There is no historical evidence for this assumption. Some experts, including archaeologist Amos Kloner (the one who excavated the tombs) do not accept that the poor family from Nazareth had a family tomb in Jerusalem.|$|R

Therefore, soil organic carbon research is gaining momentum in the Mediterranean basin. Our objective is to quantify effects of no tillage (NT) and conventional tillage (CT) on soil organic carbon stock (SOCs) in three soil types (Vertisol, Cambisol, and Luvisol) within Central Morocco. Chemical analyses {{were used to determine}} how tillage affected various humic substances. Our results showed that, after 5 years, surface horizon (0 – 30 [*]cm) SOC stocks varied between tillage systems and with soil type. The SOCs was significantly higher in NT compared to CT (10 % more in Vertisol and 8 % more in Cambisol), but no significant difference was observed in the Luvisol. Average SOCs within the 0 – 30 [*]cm depth was 29. 35 and 27. 36 [*]Mg ha− 1 under NT and CT, respectively. The highest SOCs (31. 89 [*]Mg ha− 1) was found in Vertisols under NT. A comparison of humic substances showed that humic acids and humin were significantly higher under NT compared to CT, but fulvic acid concentrations were significantly lower. These studies confirm that <b>NT</b> <b>does</b> <b>have</b> beneficial effects on SOCs and quality in these soils...|$|R

40|$|The {{accumulation}} of alumina is an inherent problem in Solid Rocket Motors (SRM). In the V on Karman Institute this problem {{have been studied}} using a scale model of Ariane 5 booster where alumina is modeled with water. The Stokes number is maintained. After a parametric test, the relevant parameter found {{to be responsible for}} the entrapment of particles, was the horizontal distance between the tip of the isolation ring (inhibitor) and the nozzle tip. This parameter is named as Obstacle tip to Nozzle tip (OT 2 NT). The problem found during Tóth investigation was that {{a large part of the}} water accumulation in the cavity was due to the dripping of the inhibitor. The rst objective of the experimental part have been to reduce the dripping modifying the inhibitor design. The design found to minimize the dripping is the one with no extra absorbing material and a wider top plate (24 mm). A posteriori, a parametric tests was <b>done.</b> OT 2 <b>NT</b> <b>has</b> been con rmed to be the main responsible while the entrapment for the new system is around a half of Tóth results. The aim of the numerical part have been to apply an existent code, Open-Foam twoPhaseEulerFoam library, based on the nite volumes. Then this code have been modi ed in order to handle with ve dispersed phases with different properties, named as sixP haseEulerFoam. The codes have been verificated through a direct comparison with existing publications. Then a sensitivity study to numerical parameters has been done. For twoPhaseEulerFoam it has been found than the results are close to the existing ones while for the sixP haseEulerFoam although the behavior of the solution is the one expected, its values are overestimated giving only a qualitatively valid answer to the problem. Finally, twophaseEulerFoam is applied to the booster geometry studied in the experimental part. Due to the fact that OT 2 <b>NT</b> <b>has</b> been determined as the main responsible for the entrapment, three different geometries showing three different OT 2 NT (25 : 69, - 4 : 31 and - 25 : 91 mm) values have been tested. It was found that for positive values, nozzle over the inhibitor tip, the entrapment increases while it decreases for negative values (the same behaviour than found in the experiments) ...|$|R
