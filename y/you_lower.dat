500|$|Campbell {{is widely}} {{acknowledged}} {{as one of}} the best power running backs in NFL history, and was highly regarded by his peers. [...] "Every time you hit him <b>you</b> <b>lower</b> your own IQ," [...] said Redskins linebacker Pete Wysocki. Cornerback Lester Hayes of the Raiders said [...] "Earl Campbell was put on this earth to play football." [...] Cliff Harris, safety for the Cowboys, recalled Campbell as [...] "the hardest-hitting running back I ever played against. He didn't have the elusiveness of an O. J. Simpson. But when you finished a game against Earl, you had to sit in a tub with Epsom salts." [...] Bum Phillips, when asked if Campbell was in a class by himself, quipped, [...] "I dunno. But if he ain't, it don't take long to call the roll." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Tis a {{difficult}} descent. There are no ladders. Will your head stand stepping from beam to beam, and can <b>you</b> <b>lower</b> yourself by a chain?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{should not}} condescend to be thwarted {{in such a}} matter. <b>You</b> <b>lower</b> {{yourself}} by admitting such a feeling." [...] And yet he writhed himself under the lashes of Mr. Slide! ...|$|E
2500|$|McKinney says, [...] "These {{three factors}} can be {{expressed}} in three basic rules: (1) As you sing higher, you must use more energy; as <b>you</b> sing <b>lower,</b> <b>you</b> must use less. (2) As you sing higher, you must use more space; as <b>you</b> sing <b>lower,</b> <b>you</b> must use less. (3) As you sing higher, you must use more depth; as <b>you</b> sing <b>lower,</b> <b>you</b> must use less." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "After that, {{it was all}} plain sailing, and {{the money}} <b>you</b> <b>lowered</b> to me {{was much more than}} {{sufficient}} for all the other things. And now, what is your honour going to do next?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “You’re {{going down}} {{in the arms of}} the two biggest seamen I can get,” Clay replied. “If that doesn’t please <b>you,</b> we’ll <b>lower</b> <b>you</b> in a slung chair.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>you</b> <b>lower</b> your hand," [...] said I {{in a loud}} voice, while I {{felt the}} blood rush to my temples, [...] "I'll tell you. Until you do so, I'm dumb." ...|$|E
60|$|But even now, {{when you}} enter the building, <b>you</b> <b>lower</b> your voice, and time turns {{backward}} for you, for the atmosphere which you breathe is cold with the exudation of buried generations.|$|E
6000|$|... "When {{we bring}} the boat up beside the tree <b>you</b> <b>lower</b> {{yourself}} into it, Waltham," [...] directed Dick. [...] "But be careful {{how you do}} it or we'll upset. The current here is very swift." ...|$|E
50|$|Time {{tracking}} {{can lower}} costs in three ways: by making payroll processing more efficient, by making costs visible so <b>you</b> can <b>lower</b> them, and by automating billing and invoicing.|$|R
5000|$|All {{student must}} submit a Tahsili score {{regardless}} of how good it is. If <b>you</b> score <b>lower</b> than 90% in High school, {{you should have a}} grade of 80 or higher in Tahsili test.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Was <b>you</b> in <b>lower</b> seven?--so <b>you</b> was!' says George. Well, {{he had it}} all right--you bet he had it. Now wasn't that queer? The {{very day}} you and I began to know each other!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why do <b>you</b> <b>lower</b> {{yourself}} so confoundedly?" [...] he {{said with}} suppressed passion. [...] "Haven't I told you o't fifty times? Hey? Making yourself a drudge for a common workwoman of such a character as hers! Why, ye'll disgrace me to the dust!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am here, my friends, in {{the middle}} of a bush. I dare not move. It is so dark I cannot see where to put my foot. Can <b>you</b> <b>lower</b> me a lantern, and I will see if I can climb up?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, sir, I {{will stand}} against it, {{and if you}} will get on to my {{shoulders}} and put your foot on my head, you will reach the top. Then, if <b>you</b> <b>lower</b> one end of your sash to me, I can pull myself up beside you." ...|$|E
5000|$|... (Holy) is an {{independent}} movement written for Christmas 1724, scored for six voices SSAATB and a festive orchestra with trumpets and three oboes. In the original, Bach had asked for three soprano parts, alto, tenor and bass. Only the score and duplicate parts of this performance survived. The music in D major is in common time, but dominated by triplets. The three upper voices sing frequently alternating with the <b>thee</b> <b>lower</b> voices, reminiscent of a passage by Isaiah about the angels singing [...] "Holy, holy, holy" [...] to each other (...) [...] The number of voices may relate to the six wings of the seraphim described in that passage.|$|R
6000|$|... "And so it does, Catherine, {{though you}} are blinded and cannot see it. It is a woman's duty not to <b>lower</b> herself. <b>You</b> are <b>lowering</b> yourself. Mr. Arrowpoint, will you tell your {{daughter}} what is her duty?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Edward's eyes sparkled, and {{his color}} rose. [...] "You must change this tone, fellow, and that speedily," [...] he observed. [...] "I order <b>you</b> to <b>lower</b> your hand, {{and answer the}} {{questions}} that I shall put to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thank you}} for this short {{enumeration}} of my strength, Blodget, since it gives me new assurance of my people's fidelity. You I will not distrust; the others I cannot, and there is a feeling of high confidence--What do you see?--why do <b>you</b> <b>lower</b> your piece, and stand at guard, in this manner?" ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{looked very}} unhappy about it, and she {{rose to her}} feet, as if to give it more serious attention. [...] "Brice, I want your play to be {{thoroughly}} honest and true from beginning to end, and {{not to have any}} sort of catchpenny effectivism in it. You have planned it so nobly that I can't bear to have <b>you</b> <b>lower</b> the standard the least bit; and I think the honest and true way is to let the love-business be a pleasant fact in the case, as it might very well be. Those things do keep going on in life alongside of the greatest misery, the greatest unhappiness." ...|$|E
6000|$|... [232] It is {{a useful}} piece of study to {{dissolve}} some Prussian blue in water, {{so as to make}} the liquid definitely blue: fill a large white basin with the solution, and put anything you like to float on it, or lie in it; walnut shells, bits of wood, leaves of flowers, &c. Then study the effects of the reflections, and of the stems of the flowers or submerged portions of the floating objects, as they appear through the blue liquid; noting especially how, as <b>you</b> <b>lower</b> your head and look along the surface, you see the reflections clearly; and how, as you raise your head, you lose the reflections, and see the submerged stems clearly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, then, don't {{you know}} what would happen if <b>you</b> were <b>lowering</b> that boat full of people in a rough sea, and the man at the bow failed to unhook his block at the exact same moment as the man at the stern?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What are {{you talking}} about, man?" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "What do <b>you</b> mean? <b>Lower</b> your voice, for heaven's sake! Consider my {{position}} here! Some one might overhear! If this is a joke, {{let me tell you}} that it's a d----d foolish one!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Northmour," [...] I said, [...] "we {{all know}} you have a bad temper, and I am the last man to be irritated by words. For all that, I propose that <b>you</b> speak <b>lower,</b> for I am {{convinced}} that we are not alone." ...|$|R

6000|$|His {{companion}} {{laughed in}} an ominous fashion. [...] "Small ranchers, though it's just {{possible that there}} may be some of the big men connected with the land business behind them. The big promoters occasionally prefer to act through a dummy. Our object is, of course, to get men who will cultivate the land, and keep it {{out of the hands of}} anyone who merely wants to hold it. Now, while I'm far from sure my superiors would be pleased to hear I'd said so much to you, there's one piece of advice I can offer." [...] He leaned forward and looked at Nasmyth confidentially. [...] "Get that work through as soon as you can. Once <b>you</b> <b>lower</b> the level of the river, nobody could compel you to put it back again. Any man who wanted land would have to buy it as it was." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Glover," [...] {{the first}} {{lieutenant}} {{said as he}} reached the deck, [...] "do <b>you</b> <b>lower</b> the schooner's cutter, put all the wounded on board, take four of your men and row out to the frigate and report to the captain what has taken place. Tell him that Mr. Playford carried the battery on the right in spite of the guns, and that I have spiked those in the battery on the left, which I found deserted. Say that we have had a sharp fight on shore with a large number of negroes led by two or three white men and some mulattoes, and that I believe there must be some large plantations close at hand whose owners are in league with the slavers. You can say that we found a hundred and twenty slaves in the barracoon, evidently newly landed from the schooner, and that I intend to find the plantations and give them a lesson in the morning. How many wounded have you here?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, {{not for the}} world. I never wish <b>you</b> to <b>lower</b> yourself; {{but somehow}} I cannot help {{thinking}} it unjust to include all poor working-people under the general and insulting name of 'the mob,' and continually {{to think of them}} and treat them haughtily." ...|$|R
5000|$|Conflicts {{result in}} the {{accumulation}} of either [...] "failure ranks" [...] (which recover {{at the end of}} the contest) or [...] "damage ranks" [...] (which may take longer to heal). Each point of either type means that the loser must choose a stat to downgrade by one rank. So if you lose a conflict roll by 3, <b>you</b> must <b>lower</b> three stats each by one rank, or one stat by three ranks (with a minimum of Poor: -2). You can choose any stat to take your damage in—i.e. you can downgrade your [...] "Accounting" [...] quality based on a hit in a fight.

6000|$|... 'There's an old well there,' {{said the}} sexton, 'right {{underneath}} the belfry; a deep, dark, echoing well. Forty year ago, you {{had only to}} let down the bucket till the first knot in the rope was free of the windlass, and you heard it splashing in the cold dull water. By little and little the water fell away, so that in ten year after that, a second knot was made, and you must unwind so much rope, or the bucket swung tight and empty at the end. In ten years' time, the water fell again, and a third knot was made. In ten years more, the well dried up; and now, if <b>you</b> <b>lower</b> the bucket till your arms are tired, and let out nearly all the cord, you'll hear it, of a sudden, clanking and rattling on the ground below; with a sound of being so deep and so far down, that your heart leaps into your mouth, and you start away {{as if you were}} falling in.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{you should}} not be {{contented}} to be here. It is just that. In learning to love me,--or rather, perhaps, to pity me, <b>you</b> <b>lower</b> yourself. Do you think that I do not see it all, and know it all? Of course it is bad to be alone, but I have no right not to be alone." [...] There was nothing for Clara to do but to draw herself once again close to the poor woman, and to embrace her with protestations of fair, honest, equal regard and friendship. [...] "Do you think I do not understand that letter?" [...] continued Mrs. Askerton. [...] "If it had come from Lady Aylmer I could have laughed at it, because I believe Lady Aylmer to be an overbearing virago, whom it is good to put down in every way possible. But this comes from a pure-minded woman, one whom I believe to be little given to harsh judgments on her fellow-sinners; and she tells you, in her calm wise way, that it is bad for you to be here with me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{beautiful}} is this earth!" [...] thought Mr. Lavender, [...] "and {{how simple}} {{to be good}} and happy thereon. Yet must we journey ten leagues beyond the wide world's end to find justice and liberty. There are dark powers like lions ever in the path. Yes," [...] he continued, turning round to the pinetrees, who were creaking slightly in the wind, [...] "hate and oppression, greed, lust, and ambition! There you stand malevolently regarding me. Out upon you, dark witches of evil! If I had but an axe I would lay <b>you</b> <b>lower</b> than the dust." [...] But the poor pine-trees paid no attention save to creak a little louder. And so incensed was Mr. Lavender by this insensibility {{on the part of}} those which his own words had made him perceive were the powers of darkness that he would very likely have barked his knuckles on them if Blink by her impatience had not induced him to resume his walk and mount on to the noble rampart of the Spaniard's Road.|$|E
