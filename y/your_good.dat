500|$|Rowson {{gives the}} {{following}} example of Black outplaying White from the Symmetrical Variation of the English Opening. He remarks, [...] "there is something compelling about Black's strategy.

500|$|Duncan cites {{his late}} mother Ione as his main inspiration. Among other things, she taught {{him and his}} sisters the nursery rhyme [...] "Good, Better, Best. Never let it rest / Until <b>your</b> <b>Good</b> is Better, and your Better is your Best", which he adopted as his {{personal}} motto. On and off the court, {{he believes that the}} three most important values are dedication, teamwork and camaraderie. The Spurs captain has also stated that he chose #21 for his jersey because that was his brother-in-law's college number, since he was Duncan's main basketball inspiration, and cites Hall-of-Fame Los Angeles Lakers point guard Magic Johnson as his childhood idol.|$|E

500|$|By this time, Symeon {{had many}} disciples—some of them, {{including}} the patrician Geneseos, appealed to Sergius II, the Patriarch of Constantinople, {{to lift the}} order of exile. Out of fear that the dispute would reach the emperor, Sergius II lifted the exile order completely, and then offered to re-establish Symeon at the monastery of St. Mammas and consecrate him as archbishop of an important see in Constantinople. The only qualification was that Symeon must show some restraint in his celebration of Symeon the Studite's festival day. Symeon refused to compromise—the Patriarch, {{out of respect for}} Symeon, gave him his blessing to [...] "live together with your disciples and act according to <b>your</b> <b>good</b> pleasure." ...|$|E
500|$|Kenyon's {{appointment}} was initially greeted with caution by his fellow barristers, who worried that, {{as he had}} practised {{in a court of}} equity rather than a court of common law, he might be unfamiliar with the area covered by his new posting in the Court of King's Bench. Despite this, he was noted as an excellent judge, although one who suffered from an [...] "excess of zeal" [...] in moral issues. One of his flaws was his defective education; he was too proud to avoid exhibiting his ignorance. He was particularly noted for using Latin incorrectly, leading George III to say [...] "My Lord... it would be well if you would stick to <b>your</b> <b>good</b> law and leave off your bad Latin". As a judge, Kenyon over-ruled the principles that a court of law could not consider trusts or a pecuniary legacy; it was said that he [...] "restored the simplicity and rigor of the common law". After nearly one and a half decades as a judge, Kenyon died on 4 April 1802 in Bath.|$|E
500|$|On 6 November, the Lord Chief Justice, Sir John Popham (a {{man with}} a {{deep-seated}} hatred of Catholics) questioned Rookwood's servants. [...] By the evening he had learned the names of several {{of those involved in}} the conspiracy: Catesby, Rookwood, Keyes, Wynter , John and Christopher Wright, and Grant. [...] "Johnson" [...] meanwhile persisted with his story, and along with the gunpowder he was found with, was moved to the Tower of London, where the King had decided that [...] "Johnson" [...] would be tortured. [...] The use of torture was forbidden, except by royal prerogative or a body such as the Privy Council or Star Chamber. [...] In a letter of 6November James wrote: [...] "The gentler tortours [...] are to be first used unto him, et sic per gradus ad ima tenditur , and so God speed <b>your</b> <b>good</b> work." [...] "Johnson" [...] may have been placed in manacles and hung from the wall, but he was almost certainly subjected to the horrors of the rack. [...] On 7November his resolve was broken; he confessed late that day, and again over the following two days.|$|E

Ticknor handled many of Hawthorne's personal matters, including the purchase of cigars, overseeing financial accounts, and even purchasing clothes.

2500|$|The Overland Campaign, Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant's {{offensive}} against Lee {{in the spring}} of 1864, began at the Battle of the Wilderness, where Stuart aggressively pushed Thomas L. Rosser's Laurel Brigade into a fight against George Custer's better-armed Michigan Brigade, resulting in significant losses. General Lee sent a message to Stuart: [...] "It is very important to save your Cavalry & not wear it out. ... You must use <b>your</b> <b>good</b> judgment to make any attack which may offer advantages." [...] As the armies maneuvered toward their next confrontation at Spotsylvania Court House, Stuart's cavalry fought delaying actions against the Union cavalry. His defense at Laurel Hill, also directing the infantry of Brig. Gen. Joseph B. Kershaw, skillfully delayed the advance of the Federal army for nearly 5 critical hours.|$|E

2500|$|King Bhadravarman {{caused a}} stele to be erected at Mỹ Sơn the {{inscription}} on which recorded his foundation. The stele {{indicates that the}} king dedicated the entire valley of Mỹ Sơn to Bhadreśvara. The text ends with a plea from Bhadravarman to his successors: [...] "Out of compassion for me do not destroy what I have given." [...] Drawing upon the doctrines of saṃsāra and karma, he added, [...] "If you destroy , all <b>your</b> <b>good</b> deeds in your different births shall be mine, and all the bad deeds done by me shall be yours. If, on the contrary, you properly maintain the endowment, the merit shall belong to you alone."

2500|$|He is {{to collect}} {{all of his}} bodily senses in concentration, and to cut himself off from all preoccupation and notions that inflict {{themselves}} upon the heart. And thus he is to turn his full consciousness towards God Most High while saying three times: [...] "Ilahî anta maqsûdî wa-ridâka matlûbî—my God, you are my Goal and <b>Your</b> <b>good</b> pleasure is what I seek". Then he brings to his heart the Name of the Essence—Allâh—and as it courses through his heart he remains attentive to its meaning, which is [...] "Essence without likeness". The seeker remains aware that He is Present, Watchful, Encompassing of all, thereby exemplifying the meaning of his saying (may God bless him and grant him peace): [...] "Worship God as though you see Him, for {{if you do not}} see Him, He sees you". And likewise the prophetic tradition: [...] "The most favored level of faith is to know that God is witness over you, wherever you may be".|$|E

2500|$|Lord Nelson, {{before he}} became famous, captained [...] in 1781 {{as part of the}} Fishery Protection Squadron in North America, {{capturing}} the U.S. fishing schooner Harmony off the coast of Cape Cod. He took it in tow, with the master of the schooner acting as pilot for both ships for the unfamiliar shores around Boston Harbor. Once the ships were safe, he allowed the schooner to continue unimpeded, saying to the master, [...] "You have rendered us a very essential service, and it is not the custom of English seamen to be ungrateful. In the name, therefore, and with the approbation of the officers of this ship, I return your schooner and with it this certificate of <b>your</b> <b>good</b> conduct. Farewell, and may God bless you." [...] The certificate of good conduct protected the schooner from capture by a British ship. In return, the master gave a present to Nelson of [...] "four sheep, some poultry, and a quantity of vegetables", which Nelson ordered to be shared amongst the sick. Even today, on Trafalgar Day, the flag officer shaves with the same cut-throat razor used by Nelson while he commanded Albermarle.|$|E
2500|$|According to the Wei Shu, Guo Jia advised Cao Cao on how {{to handle}} Liu Bei when Liu Bei came to join Cao Cao in 196, after Lü Bu seized control of Xu Province from Liu's general Zhang Fei. On Cao Cao's suggestion, Emperor Xian {{appointed}} Liu Bei as the Governor (牧) of Yu Province (豫州). Someone told Cao Cao, [...] "Liu Bei has the ambition of a hero. If you don't eliminate him now, he'll become a threat to you in the future." [...] Cao Cao asked Guo Jia for his opinion, to which Guo replied, [...] "That's true. However, when you raised an army in the name of righteousness and pledged to help the common people eliminate tyrants, you attracted talented and capable people to serve under you based on your sincerity and integrity. Liu Bei is known to be a hero, so if you kill him when he comes to serve you, you will be viewed as someone who harms men of virtue. Other talented persons will start to doubt you and may even change their minds about serving you. If that happens, who will help you achieve your goals? Therefore, it's imperative that you carefully consider the consequences of ruining <b>your</b> <b>good</b> reputation for the sake of eliminating one man who poses a threat to you."
