5000|$|During the 1981-1982 American tour, the Stones {{worked with}} Japenese {{designer}} Kazuhide Yamazari in constructing their stages for stadium sized locations and audiences. During this period, stages increased {{in size to}} include runways, movable sections of stage going out into the audience, and growing in all other aspects. This tour used coloured panels {{and was one of}} the last Stones tours to do so before switching to devices such as video screens. Stadium shows provided a new challenge for the band, the venues were large enough in size that the band became [...] "like ants" [...] to audience members. This resulted in Jagger having to project himself [...] "over the footlights" [...] and the band needing to employ more gimmicks, such as pyrotechnics, lights, and video screens. [...] "When youre out there in this vast stadium, you have to physically tiny up on stage, so thats why on the 1981-2 tour we had those coloured panels and later we started using devices like video screens. We became very aware of not being seen, of just being there like ants. Mick is the one who really has to project himself over the footlights. And when the show gets that big, <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> extra help, you need a couple of gimmicks, as we call it, in the show. You need fireworks, you need lights, you need a bit of theatre." [...] Charlie Watts, According to the Rolling Stones ...|$|E

5000|$|Black Minnaloushe {{made his}} three-year-old {{debut in the}} Listed Loughbrown Stakes at the Curragh on 21 April. Before the race O'Brien said [...] "He has done {{exceptionally}} well and is a big horse this year. He {{can be a bit}} headstrong early in his races, but that's because {{he has a lot of}} natural speed". He started odds-on favourite but was beaten two lengths into second place by Lethal Agenda. Colm O'Donoghue took over from Kinane when the colt contested the Tetrarch Stakes at the same track two weeks later. Black Minnaloushe started poorly and finished last of the five runners behind his stablemate Modigliani with another O'Brien trainee, Mozart in third. Six days later, accompanied by Modigliani and King's County, the colt was part of O'Brien's entry for the Poule d'Essai des Poulains at Longchamp Racecourse in Paris. Ridden by Jamie Spencer, he raced at the rear of the eleven runner field before making progress in the straight and finished sixth, five lengths behind Noverre. The winner was subsequently disqualified after failing a dope test and the race was awarded to Vahorimix. On 26 May, Black Minnaloushe, ridden by Johnny Murtagh, was one of four O'Brien colts to contest the Irish 2000 Guineas at the Curragh and started a 20/1 outsider in a twelve-runner field. The Middle Park Stakes winner Minardi (ridden by Kinane) started favourite ahead of the 2000 Guineas runner-up Tamburlaine and the British-trained Mugharreb whilst the other contenders included Mozart and the highly rated maiden winner Freud. Black Minnaloushe raced in mid-division as Mozart led from the start and opened up a clear advantage, and moved up into third place approaching the final furlong. He caught Mozart well inside the final furlong and went on to win by two lengths, with Minardi taking third to complete a 1-2-3 for Ballydoyle. After the race Murtagh commented [...] "There was a bit of a mix-up during the week about what I was going to ride and thankfully Aidan put me on Black Minnaloushe. It just goes to show that <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit of luck in this game. O'Brien says he's a horse with lots of ability and sometimes he doesn't always put his best foot forward. Today the race was run to suit him, there was a good strong pace all the way and when the leader started to tire in front of him he got great heart in picking him up".|$|E
