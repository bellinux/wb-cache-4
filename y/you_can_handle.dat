[...] "If it's {{against the}} law, arrest me", she sings [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>handle</b> it, undress me." [...] The song has a short {{interlude}} where Madonna continuously repeates the words [...] "Get stupid", as Williams chants, [...] "To the left, to the right". [...] "Give It 2 Me" [...] {{was written by}} Madonna as an anthemic, self-manifesto song which, although {{it appears to be}} about dance and sex, is a reference to Madonna's career spanning three decades in the music industry. Musically it is an upbeat dance song, featuring instrumentation from West African percussion and cowbells. Backing vocals are provided by Williams. The fourth track [...] "Heartbeat" [...] has Madonna singing breathlessly and also features an interlude where the music changes from its normal rhythm, just the sound of drums.|$|E

6000|$|A rule which forbids social {{intercourse}} {{between members}} of different corps is strict. In the dueling-house, in the parks, on the street, and anywhere and everywhere that the students go, caps of a color group themselves together. If all the tables in a public garden were crowded but one, and that one had two red-cap students at it and ten vacant places, the yellow-caps, the blue-caps, the white caps, and the green caps, seeking seats, would go by that table and not seem to see it, nor seem {{to be aware that}} there was such a table in the grounds. The student by whose courtesy we had been enabled to visit the dueling-place, wore the white cap--Prussian Corps. He introduced us to many white caps, but to none of another color. The corps etiquette extended even to us, who were strangers, and required us to group with the white corps only, and speak only with the white corps, while we were their guests, and keep aloof from the caps of the other colors. Once I wished to examine some of the swords, but an American student said, [...] "It would not be quite polite; these now in the windows all have red hilts or blue; they will bring in some with white hilts presently, and those <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>handle</b> freely." [...] When a sword was broken in the first duel, I wanted a piece of it; but its hilt was the wrong color, so it was considered best and politest to await a properer season.|$|E

It had operated within her now to the last intensity, her glimpse of the precious truth that by her helping him, helping him to help himself, as it were, she should help him to help HER. Hadn't she fairly got into his labyrinth with him?--wasn't she indeed in the very act of placing herself there, for him, at its centre and core, whence, on that definite orientation and by an instinct all her own, she might securely guide him out of it? She offered him thus, assuredly, a kind of support that was not to have been imagined in advance, and that moreover required--ah most truly!--some close looking at before it could be believed in and pronounced void of treachery. [...] "Yes, look, look," [...] she seemed to see him hear her say even while her sounded words were other-- [...] "look, look, both at the truth that still survives in that smashed evidence and at the even more remarkable appearance that I'm not such a fool as you supposed me.

Consider of course, as you must, the question of what you may have to surrender, on your side, what price you may have to pay, whom you may have to pay WITH, to set this advantage free; but take in, at any rate, that there is something for you if you don't too blindly spoil your chance for it."

It was shown me, and I was struck with it and took it-- knowing nothing about it at the time.

So there it is-- in its three pieces. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>handle</b> them--don't be afraid--if {{you want to make sure}} the thing is the thing you and Charlotte saw together.

40|$|Abstract In this work, I {{have chosen}} to write about {{children}} in grief. Since children in grief is a large area, I {{have chosen to}} focus on how preschool handles and works with children who has loosed a parent, siblings or a play-mate by death. The aim of this work is to contribute knowledge about how <b>you</b> in preschool <b>can</b> <b>handle</b> and work with children in grief. To get answers to my questions, I have studied the current literature in the field. I have also interviewed five people with experience and knowledge of work with preschool-children affected by grief.  In my work, I {{have come to the}} conclusion that preschool has a great influence to children affected by grief. The preschool-child can get the everyday routines that are important for the child confidence. It is also important that as a preschool teacher be there for the child and to really listen and show understanding when the child tells about their experiences and feelings. ...|$|R

At {{the beginning of the}} song, Spears says in a breathy voice the lines [...] "People can take everything away from you / But they can never take away your truth / But the question is, <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>handle</b> mine?". The rest of the lyrics do not deviate much from the original version, instead they are changed to fit a woman's perspective.
