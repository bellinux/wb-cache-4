500|$|Starting on the {{electric}} piano, Charles played what felt right: {{a series of}} riffs, switching then to a regular piano for four choruses backed up by a unique Latin conga tumbao rhythm on drums. The song changed when Charles began singing simple, improvised unconnected verses ("Hey Mama don't you treat me wrong / Come and love <b>your</b> <b>daddy</b> all night long / All right now / Hey hey / All right"). Charles used gospel elements in a twelve-bar blues structure. Some of the first lines ("See the gal with the red dress on / She can do the Birdland all night long") are influenced by a boogie-woogie style that Ahmet Ertegun attributes to Clarence [...] "Pinetop" [...] Smith who used to call out to dancers {{on the dance floor}} instructing what to do through his lyrics. In the middle of the song, however, Charles indicated that the Raelettes should repeat what he was doing, and the song transformed into a call and response between Charles, the Raelettes, and the horn section in the orchestra as they called out to each other in ecstatic shouts and moans and blasts from the horns.|$|E

And then my merry little young gentleman will begin to feel a little sick; and then very sick, and more miserable than he ever felt in his life; and wish a thousand times over that he was safe at home, even doing sums in long division; and he will give a great deal of trouble to various kind ladies--which no one has a right to do, if he can help it.|$|E

[...] "Not least of our merchant-princes." [...] Dickie, that's me, your dad! [...] I didn't begin with askings. I took my job and I stuck; [...] And I took the chances they wouldn't, an' now they're calling it luck. [...] Lord, what boats I've handled -- rotten and leaky and old! [...] Ran 'em, or -- opened the bilge-cock, precisely as I was told. [...] Grub that 'ud bind you crazy, and crews that 'ud turn you grey, [...] And a big fat lump of insurance to cover the risk on the way. [...] The others they dursn't do it; they said they valued their life [...] (They've served me since as skippers). I went, and I took my wife. [...] Over the world I drove 'em, married at twenty-three, [...] And your mother saving the money and making a man of me. [...] I was content to be master, but she said there was better behind; [...] She took the chances I wouldn't, and I followed your mother blind. [...] She egged me to borrow the money, an' she helped me to clear the loan, [...] When we bought half shares in a cheap 'un and hoisted a flag of our own. [...] Patching and coaling on credit, and living the Lord knew how, [...] We started the Red Ox freighters -- we've eight-and-thirty now. [...] And those were the days of clippers, and the freights were clipper-freights, [...] And we knew we were making our fortune, but she died in Macassar Straits -- [...] By the Little Paternosters, as you come to the Union Bank -- [...] And we dropped her in fourteen fathom; I pricked it off where she sank. [...] Owners we were, full owners, and the boat was christened for her, [...] And she died in the Mary Gloster. My heart, how young we were! [...] So I went on a spree round Java and well-nigh ran her ashore, [...] But your mother came and warned me and I wouldn't liquor no more: [...] Strict I stuck to my business, afraid to stop or I'd think, [...] Saving the money (she warned me), and letting the other men drink. [...] And I met M'Cullough in London (I'd turned five 'undred then), [...] And 'tween us we started the Foundry -- three forges and twenty men: [...] Cheap repairs for the cheap 'uns. It paid, and the business grew, [...] For I bought me a steam-lathe patent, and that was a gold mine too. [...] "Cheaper to build 'em than buy 'em," [...] I said, but M'Cullough he shied, [...] And we wasted a year in talking before we moved to the Clyde. [...] And the Lines were all beginning, and we all of us started fair, [...] Building our engines like houses and staying the boilers square. [...] But M'Cullough 'e wanted cabins with marble and maple and all, [...] And Brussels an' Utrecht velvet, and baths and a Social Hall, [...] And pipes for closets all over, and cutting the frames too light, [...] But M'Cullough he died in the Sixties, and -- Well, I'm dying to-night. [...] I knew -- I knew what was coming, when we bid on the Byfleet's keel -- [...] They piddled and piffled with iron: I'd given my orders for steel! [...] Steel and the first expansions. It paid, I tell you, it paid, [...] When we came with our nine-knot freighters and collared the long-run trade! [...] And they asked me how I did it, and I gave 'em the Scripture text, [...] "You keep your light so shining a little in front o' the next!" [...] They copied all they could follow, but they couldn't copy my mind, [...] And I left 'em sweating and stealing {{a year and a half}} behind. [...] Then came the armour-contracts, but that was M'Cullough's side; [...] He was always best in the Foundry, but better, perhaps, he died. [...] I went through his private papers; the notes was plainer than print; [...] And I'm no fool to finish if a man'll give me a hint. [...] (I remember his widow was angry.) So I saw what the drawings meant, [...] And I started the six-inch rollers, and it paid me sixty per cent -- [...] Sixty per cent with failures, and more than twice we could do, [...] And a quarter-million to credit, and I saved it all for you! [...] I thought -- it doesn't matter -- you seemed to favour your ma, [...] But you're nearer forty than thirty, and I know the kind you are. [...] Harrer an' Trinity College! I ought to ha' sent you to sea -- [...] But I stood you an education, an' what have you done for me? [...] The things I knew was proper you wouldn't thank me to give, [...] And the things I knew was rotten you said was the way to live. [...] For you muddled with books and pictures, an' china an' etchin's an' fans, [...] And your rooms at college was beastly -- more like a whore's than a man's -- [...] Till you married that thin-flanked woman, as white and as stale as a bone, [...] An' she gave you your social nonsense; but where's that kid o' your own? [...] I've seen your carriages blocking the half o' the Cromwell Road, [...] But never the doctor's brougham to help the missus unload. [...] (So there isn't even a grandchild, an' the Gloster family's done.) [...] Not like your mother, she isn't. She carried her freight each run. [...] But they died, the pore little beggars! At sea she had 'em -- they died. [...] Only you, an' you stood it; you haven't stood much beside. [...] Weak, a liar, and idle, and mean as a collier's whelp [...] Nosing for scraps in the galley. No help -- my son was no help! [...] So he gets three 'undred thousand, in trust and the interest paid. [...] I wouldn't give it you, Dickie -- you see, I made it in trade. [...] You're saved from soiling your fingers, and if you have no child, [...] It all comes back to the business. Gad, won't your wife be wild! [...] 'Calls and calls in her carriage, her 'andkerchief up to 'er eye: [...] "Daddy! dear daddy's dyin'!" [...] and doing her best to cry. [...] Grateful? Oh, yes, I'm grateful, but keep her away from here. [...] Your mother 'ud never ha' stood 'er, and, anyhow, women are queer. [...] There's women will say I've married a second time. [...] Not quite! But give pore Aggie a hundred, and tell her your lawyers'll fight. [...] She was the best o' the boiling -- you'll meet her before it ends; [...] I'm in for a row with the mother -- I'll leave you settle my friends: [...] For a man he must go with a woman, which women don't understand -- [...] Or the sort that say they can see it they aren't the marrying brand.

[...] There's some ship bodies for burial -- we've carried 'em, soldered and packed; [...] Down in their wills they wrote it, and nobody called them cracked. [...] But me -- I've too much money, and people might. [...] . All my fault: [...] It come o' hoping for grandsons and buying that Wokin' vault.
