500|$|The {{following}} concerts for {{the duration}} of the tour were also met with high praise from critics: [...] Merecedes J. Howze of New Pittsburgh Courier praised the [...] "consistent" [...] show in Cincinnati, stating [...] "The duo has proven numerous times that their union, professionally and personally, is unstoppable." [...] Howze concluded that the show was definitely a [...] "couples concert" [...] meant to be [...] "enjoy" [...] with a love partner. CityBeats Jac Kern, who attended the same show praised the duo for performing hard while fully using both of the two stages and interacting with the crowd. However he also felt that intimate moments between the couple on stage were [...] "possibly staged". The production of the tour was stated to be both large and minimal by The Boston Globe writer James Read who commented that only a few performers could manage to pull off a production of On The Run's scale. He continued his review, [...] "Nor is there much to behold beyond its stars: no long catwalks, elaborate sets, or even a visible band. With Beyoncé and Jay-Z, two natural-born entertainers, <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> much more." [...] Mesfin Fekadu of the Associated Press reported that the set list of the show emulated a conversation told through songs; he noted that despite the concert being a collaborative tour, [...] "it was the performers' emotional solo material that made their presence as a collaborative duo strong and resilient". The first Canadian show of the tour was again well received by critics. Graham Slaughter of the Toronto Star concluded in his review, [...] "If there's anything to be learned from the On the Run tour, it's that tight timing, a dynamic storyline and legendary talent make a 42-song concert not just enjoyable, but rather unforgettable. Performers be warned: the bar on dual concerts has forever been raised." [...] Lorraine Ali of the Los Angeles Times who attended the first of two shows in Pasadena, California, also gave a positive review noting that the concert showcased how a marriage should work with the spouses [...] "balancing out each other's weaknesses with individual strengths" [...] on stage. Ali went on praising the stage interactions between the pair such as kissing and toggling and concluded, [...] "Whether it was a carefully orchestrated act or not, they are a great team." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2012, NASA {{researchers}} Metzger, Muscatello, Mueller, and Mantovani {{argued for}} a bootstrapping approach to start self-replicating factories in space. They developed this concept {{on the basis of}} In Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) technologies that NASA has been developing to [...] "live off the land" [...] on the Moon or Mars. Their modeling showed that in just 20 to 40 years this industry could become self-sufficient then grow to large size, enabling greater exploration in space as well as providing benefits back to Earth. In 2014, Thomas Kalil of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy published on the White House blog an interview with Metzger on bootstrapping solar system civilization through self-replicating space industry. Kalil requested the public submit ideas for how [...] "the Administration, the private sector, philanthropists, the research community, and storytellers can further these goals." [...] Kalil connected this concept to what former NASA Chief technologist Mason Peck has dubbed [...] "Massless Exploration", the ability to make everything in space so that <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> to launch it from Earth. Peck has said, [...] "...all the mass we need to explore the solar system is already in space. It's just in the wrong shape." [...] In 2016, Metzger argued that fully self-replicating industry can be started over several decades by astronauts at a lunar outpost for a total cost (outpost plus starting the industry) of {{about a third of the}} space budgets of the International Space Station partner nations, and that this industry would solve Earth's energy and environmental problems in addition to providing massless exploration.|$|E
2500|$|In his 1958 article Tobin {{also led}} the way in showing how to deal with utility {{maximization}} under uncertainty with an infinite number of possible states. As Palda explains [...] "One {{way to get out of}} the mess of figuring out asset prices using a model of maximizing the expected utility of investing in stocks is to make assumptions about either preferences or the probabilities of the different possible states of the world. Nobellist James Tobin (1958) took this line and discovered that in some cases <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> to worry about the utility of income in thousands of states, and the attached probabilities, to solve the consumer’s choice on how to spread income among states. When preferences contain only a linear and a squared term (a case of diminishing returns) or the probabilities of different stock returns follow a normal distribution (an equation that contains a linear and squared terms as parameters), a simple formulation of a person’s investment choices becomes possible. Under Tobin’s assumptions we can reformulate the person’s decision problem as being one of trading off risk and expected return. Risk, or more precisely the variance of your investment portfolio creates spread in the returns you expect. People are willing to assume more risk only if compensated by a higher level of expected return. One can thus think of a tradeoff people are willing to make between risk and expected return. They invest in risky assets to the point at which their willingness to trade off risk and return is equal to the rate at which they able to trade them off. It is difficult to exaggerate how brilliant is the simplification of the investment problem that flows from these assumptions. Instead of worrying about the investor’s optimization problem in potentially millions of possible states of the world, one need only worry about how the investor can trade off risk and return in the stock market." ...|$|E

He realised that the collaboration and cooperation with the patronising white leaders had only resulted in further discriminatory treatment.

Indeed, Ziff never mentioned Gettier or most of the usual crowd then - say Goldman, Harman, Dretske, Pollock and Unger; a few pages are on Nozick. He maintained that it was senseless to speak about a justified belief, that [...] "neither knowledge nor belief either require or can accept justification", that <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> evidence to [...] "know that p", or need to believe that p, that 'know' is univocal and means, at bottom, you {{are in a position to}} know, no matter whether it is knowing that p, how to do something, or knowing a person, that knowing something (or someone) always counts as an increase in [...] "global coherence" [...] compared to not, and that [...] "coherence is a matter of logical structure". Ziff’s coherence view differs from the other coherentists (Lehrer, BonJour, Rescher). He stated his analysis of the philosopher’s favorite, knows that p, like this: [...] "one knows that p if and only if p is true, and one is in a position such that, in that position, any possibility of one’s being in error with respect to the truth of p may be safely discounted".
