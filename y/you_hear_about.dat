500|$|MacArthur {{remains a}} {{controversial}} and enigmatic figure. He has been {{portrayed as a}} reactionary, although he was in many respects ahead of his time. He championed a progressive approach to the reconstruction of Japanese society, arguing that all occupations ultimately ended badly for the occupier and the occupied. He was often {{out of step with}} his contemporaries, such as in 1941 when he contended that Nazi Germany could not defeat the Soviet Union, when he argued that North Korea and China were no mere Soviet puppets, and throughout his career in his insistence that the future lay in the Far East. This implicitly rejected White American contemporary notions of their own racial superiority. He always treated Filipino and Japanese leaders with respect as equals. At the same time, his Victorian sensibilities recoiled at leveling Manila with aerial bombing, an attitude the hardened World War II generation regarded as old fashioned. When asked about MacArthur, Field Marshal Sir Thomas Blamey once said that [...] "The best and the worst things <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> him are both true." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Grant starred {{opposite}} Drew Barrymore in {{a parody}} of pop culture and the music industry called Music and Lyrics. The Associated Press described it as [...] "a weird little hybrid of a romantic comedy that's simultaneously too fluffy and not whimsical enough." [...] Though he neither listens to music nor owns any CDs, Grant learned to sing, play the piano, dance (a few mannered steps) and studied the mannerisms of prominent musicians to prepare {{for his role as}} a has-been pop singer, based loosely on Andrew Ridgeley, the lesser-known member of 1980s pop duo Wham!. The Star-Ledger dismissed the performance, writing that [...] "paper dolls have more depth." [...] The film, with its revenues totalling $145million, allowed Grant to mock disposable pop stardom and fleeting celebrity through its washed-up lead character. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, [...] "Grant strikes precisely the right note with regard to Alex's career: He's too intelligent not to be a little embarrassed, but he's far too brazen to feel anything like shame." [...] In 2009, Grant starred opposite Sarah Jessica Parker in the Marc Lawrence's romantic comedy Did <b>You</b> <b>Hear</b> <b>About</b> the Morgans?, which was a critical failure but was a box office success. He reunited with Lawrence again for a dramedy film The Rewrite, starring opposite Marisa Tomei. The film received mixed-to-positive reviews, while Grant's performance was praised by many critics. Director Quentin Tarantino has stated that the film is one of his favorites of the year and called Grant a [...] "perfect leading man." [...] In 2015, he had a supporting role as Alexander Waverly in Guy Ritchie's The Man from U.N.C.L.E. Entertainment Weekly described his performance as [...] "the only bit of fun" [...] in the film. Glenn Kenny of Rogerebert.com gave film a mixed review but stated that [...] "while it can’t be said that Hugh Grant saves the movie, his return to prominence in the last half-hour, after a plot-seeding-walk-on earlier in the movie, peps things up considerably." ...|$|E

2500|$|I {{was trying}} to keep it close to the vest {{throughout}} the release. Paul Walker used to say that [...] was guaranteed.

2500|$|The {{first round}} {{questions}} usually {{had a number}} of plausible answers, while the second round questions were generally easier and were usually puns that were meant to lead to an obvious answer, in order to allow a trailing contestant to catch up.

2500|$|The {{documentary}} mini-series, [...] (released January 22, 2016, at Sundance), {{directed by}} Ezra Edelman and produced by Laylow Films, is an American 5-part, 7.5-hour film that previewed at the Tribeca and Sundance Film Festivals and is airing {{as part of}} the 30 for 30 series airing on the ABC and ESPN sister networks. This film adds [...] "rich contextual layers to the case, including a dive into the history of Los Angeles race relations that played such a central role in his acquittal". As James Poniewozik observed in his June 20, 2016, New York Times review: [...] "the director Ezra Edelman pulls back, way back, like a news chopper over a freeway chase. Before <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> the trial, the documentary says, you need to hear all the stories—the stories of race, celebrity, sports, America—that it's a part of."

2500|$|Wendy Leigh, {{who wrote}} an {{unofficial}} biography on Schwarzenegger, claims he plotted his political rise {{from an early}} age using the movie business and bodybuilding as building blocks to escape a depressing home. Leigh portrays Schwarzenegger as obsessed with power and quotes him as saying, [...] "I {{wanted to be part of}} the small percentage of people who were leaders, not the large mass of followers. I think it is because I saw leaders use 100% of their potential– I was always fascinated by people in control of other people." [...] Schwarzenegger has said that it was never his intention to enter politics, but he says, [...] "I married into a political family. You get together with them and <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> policy, about reaching out to help people. I was exposed to the idea of being a public servant and Eunice and Sargent Shriver became my heroes." [...] Eunice Kennedy Shriver was sister of John F. Kennedy, and mother-in-law to Schwarzenegger; Sargent Shriver is husband to Eunice and father-in-law to Schwarzenegger.|$|E
