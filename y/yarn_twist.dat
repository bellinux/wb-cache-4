40|$|<b>Yarn</b> <b>twist</b> in textile {{technology}} {{is an important}} characteristic since it considerably affects the properties of knitted or woven fabrics. Many researchers have investigated the effect of staple-spun <b>yarn</b> <b>twist</b> on {{the properties of the}} yarns and fabrics. However, the effects of twist level of Kevlar® 29 filament yarn on the properties of yarn and its resin-impregnated self-lubricating fabric liner are not fully known yet. In this study, we have investigated the effects of Kevlar® 29 twist level on the tensile and tribological properties of the fabric liner (Kevlar® 29 /polytetrafluoroethylene fabric-resin composite). Two unexpected findings about the effect of <b>yarn</b> <b>twist</b> have been observed, namely (1) asynchronous twist effect on the yarn’s and the liner’s tensile strength and (2) dissimilar <b>yarn</b> <b>twist</b> effect on the liner’s performance. These findings are mainly attributed to the synergic contributions of the <b>yarn</b> <b>twist</b> and strength and the interaction of the resin with the yarn orientation in the woven fabric structure of the liner...|$|E

The spindle air pressure direction was changed in both Z and S directions on the Z twist yarn of Ne 40 s Polyester/Cotton vortex yarn (50 : 50 polyester: cotton) and these yarns were then tested for their properties such as tensile, unevenness, and hairiness. It was found that unevenness was lower with normal spinning condition and increased when the spindle air pressure increased in both directions. Imperfections were also found to be minimum with normal spinning condition and increased with increase in spindle air pressure. The yarn tenacity and elongation at break found to be lower at normal spinning condition. When the spindle air pressure increased yarn tenacity and elongation at break also increased with increase in spindle air pressure.

50|$|Twisting in the {{opposite}} direction is due to the tensions resulting from the <b>yarn</b> <b>twisting</b> that Mueller indicated in the diagram of tension and pressure. The total tension acting against the twisting is increased in relation to increasedtwisting due to the increasing tension and pressure of the bundle of fibres in the yarn. It may become so strong that the thread core buckles when it can no longer withstand the compressive strains. The yarn curls, meaning that the yarn tries to reach a state of equilibrium in which twists in {{the opposite}} direction from the original twist direction balance the yarn’s torque.These twists are also called negative twists. In this state of equilibrium, the inner torsional tensions cancel each other out. The thread always buckles at a spot where the cross section is small due to the unevenness of the thread. During the spinning process this spot took up more twists and is therefore subjected to higher inner tensions, which ultimately break the thread core. Although thicker <b>yarns</b> are less <b>twisted</b> than fine ones, the inner tension rises opposite to the yarn size. Smaller yarn is more weakened by steaming. Further positive aspects of steaming are the reduction of curling and, at the same time, the setting of the physical properties of closeness and extension imparted to the <b>yarn</b> by <b>twisting.</b>|$|R

The yarn diameter is measured with good accuracy by using the small-angle far-field diffraction pattern of the yarn body. <b>Yarn</b> <b>twist</b> is then derived from the measured surface twist angle and yarn diameter.
