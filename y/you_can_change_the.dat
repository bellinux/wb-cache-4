25|$|Suppose a {{listener}} cannot hear a given acoustical signal under silent condition. When a signal is playing while another sound {{is being played}} (a masker) the signal has to be stronger for the listener to hear it. The masker {{does not need to}} have the frequency components of the original signal for masking to happen. A masked signal can be heard even though it is weaker than the masker. Masking happens when a signal and a masker are played together. It also happens when a masker starts after a signal stops playing. The effects of backward masking is weaker than forward masking. The masking effect has been widely used in psychoacoustical research. With masking <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> levels of the masker and measure the threshold, then create a diagram of a psychophysical tuning curve that will reveal similar features. Masking effects are also used for audio encoding. The masking effect is used in lossy encoders. It can eliminate some of the weaker sounds, so the listener can not hear the difference. This technique has been used in MP3's.|$|E
