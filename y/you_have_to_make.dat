But then I thought, 'Right, you're really depressed now but <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> this album. Tore would be quite pissed off if you just stopped doing anything.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Opponents of the light-rail project {{have argued}} that it was {{undertaken}} without sufficient consultation with the public. In February 2008, it was reported that the House of Commons committee on government operations would be looking into his involvement over the case. MP and committee member Mark Holland voiced a concern that Baird leaked information on the contract. Baird replied that he made the right decision and dismissed the investigation saying [...] "there is no evidence of anything". Speaking to reporters he added following the announcement of the investigation: [...] "If you want to avert a billion-dollar boondoggle, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> some difficult decisions".|$|E

If we're talking about the 'new me,' that's it and why it's {{at the end of}} the record. You have to go through those things and make the changes <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> and be there and go, 'Okay, I did it.' It doesn't come that easy. [...] I just didn't hold back this time, and writing that way has made me feel really purified, like I've actually gotten a chance to break through instead of just wallowing in all of my problems. It's not about all the times that I've been afraid and tormented and sad, it's about looking at those situations and stomping them out. It feels really good to sing these songs now." ...|$|E
500|$|Stylistically, {{the album}} has been {{described}} by Allrovi's Jason Lymangrover as ranging [...] "from Frank Sinatra pop to psychedelic garage rock"; while The Boston Globe James Reed has noted the [...] "spare" [...] sound of [...] "Scalinatella" [...] and the [...] "furious and rocking" [...] pace of [...] "Urlo Negro". Although wanting to remain faithful to the original versions of the songs covered, Patton wished to avoid simply mimicking the original recordings, stating [...] "this is a record of covers, and I believe firmly that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> them your own. There is a very fine line to tread. You have to treat a song with respect, yet twist it up, fuck it up and somehow make it a part of your own voice". When assembling the cut for [...] "Deep Down", Patton was able {{to get in touch with}} the original vocalist, a woman named Christy, though mutual friend Daniele Luppi. However, she declined to take part in the project.|$|E

Premier Shawn Graham said [...] "I just want to extend sympathies to the affected families. This is a tragic situation for the community of Bathurst and our province." [...] Prime Minister of Canada Stephen Harper said the incident had [...] "shocked the nation" [...] and called for a day of mourning. Valery Vienneau, Bishop of Bathurst, read a message on behalf of Pope Benedict XVI stating: [...] " [...] expresses sentiments of deep sympathy and spiritual closeness to the members of their families and to all staff and students who have been touched by this tragedy.

500|$|Becoming a {{restricted}} free {{agent for the}} second consecutive summer, Hansen was taken to salary arbitration by the Canucks. Following his hearing on 20 July 2010, he was awarded a one-year, one-way deal worth $850,000, which the Canucks agreed to. Recording career-highs of 9 goals, 20 assists and 29 points over 82 games in 2010–11, Hansen received the Canucks' Fred J. Hume Award as the team's [...] "unsung hero" [...] (voted by the Canucks' booster club). He added three goals and nine points over 25 games in the 2011 playoffs as the Canucks advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals, where they were defeated in seven games by the Boston Bruins. In the off-season, Hansen filed for salary arbitration. Prior to his hearing, Hansen and the Canucks avoided arbitration by agreeing to a three-year, $4.05 million contract. Many in the media, including those from the local Province newspaper, suggested that he ceded to the Canucks' negotiations, to which Hansen responded, [...] "If {{you want to be in}} a position to win, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> some sacrifices." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{decoding}} of the extraterrestrial message, {{with its}} architectural {{drawings of the}} machine, was created by Ken Ralston and Sony Pictures Imageworks. This is the sixth film collaboration between director Zemeckis and VFX supervisor Ralston. Imageworks created more than 350 visual effects shots, {{using a combination of}} model and miniature shots and digital computer work. On designing the Machine, Zemeckis explained that [...] "The Machine in Sagan's novel was somewhat vague, which is fine for a book. In a movie, though, if you're going to build a giant physical structure of alien design, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it believable." [...] He continued that [...] "it had to be huge, so that the audience would feel like it was bigger than man should be tinkering with. It had to look absolutely real." [...] The machine was then designed by concept artist Steve Burg, reusing a conceptual design he had originally created to appear as the [...] "Time Displacement Device" [...] in [...] in a scene that did not make the final cut.|$|E
500|$|Minaj {{released}} her second studio album [...] in April 2012. The album {{was preceded by}} the promotional singles [...] "Roman in Moscow" [...] and [...] "Stupid Hoe". Critics suggested that the latter song was directed at Lil' Kim, who said: [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a song called 'Stupid Hoe,' {{you must be a}} stupid hoe." [...] Minaj and rapper M.I.A. joined Madonna to perform their single, [...] "Give Me All Your Luvin'", on the Super Bowl XLVI halftime show on February 6, 2012. She was the first solo female rapper to perform at the Grammy Awards, premiering [...] "Roman Holiday" [...] during the 2012 ceremony on February 12. Her exorcism-themed performance was controversial, with the American Catholic League criticizing Minaj for bringing a fake [...] "Pope" [...] to escort her on the red carpet. The [...] "exorcism" [...] scene that was performed during her appearance was criticized as well. According to the Catholic League president Bill Donohue [...] "Perhaps the most vulgar part was the sexual statement that showed a scantily clad female dancer stretching backwards while an altar boy knelt between her legs in prayer. Finally, 'Come All Ye Faithful' was sung while a man posing as a bishop walked on stage; Minaj was shown levitating." ...|$|E

500|$|McKidd has {{referred}} to his character and the character of Cristina Yang as [...] "soulmates." [...] Speaking of Owen's PTSD storyline, McKidd stated: [...] "What's exciting about telling this story with this character is that it's quite brave of ABC and Shonda , on a prime-time network TV show, to address a tough subject, and one that people don't necessarily want to hear about. [...] But so far the writing room is handling it beautifully. They're not banging people {{over the head with}} it but exploring it in a sensitive and interesting way." [...] Owen and Cristina have struggled with their fictional relationship in season eight, leading to Owen having a sexual affair. Directly before the episode involving the affair aired, McKidd said to Entertainment Weekly: [...] "The thing about Owen is that he tries to do things perfectly, and obviously, he messes up as the chief because <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> these odd black-and-white decisions and sometimes you make the wrong decision. There’s a lot of stress in his life at the moment, so he’s trying not to let that affect his efficiency as chief." [...] Although the characters' marriage is tested, McKidd reported to The Hollywood Reporter: [...] "I think they're meant for each other. I hold out faith in Cristina and Owen, even though they go to the darkest places out of all the couples on the show. It's going to get worse but it's going to get better soon." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} make a {{faithful}} rendition of the circus, director Kramer asked the animators to watch a showing of Cirque du Soleil in Santa Monica, but they declined the offer. Regardless, executive producer and former showrunner Mike Scully found that the animators did an [...] "amazing" [...] job animating the setpiece. Because the episode takes place in winter, the animators faced some challenges that they would not have with any other episode. [...] "It just adds another element", Kramer said about episodes taking place in winter, [...] "People's clothes have to get tugged in the wind if it's windy. And <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sure the snow is consistent because [...] It's like a character. If it's a big snowflake in one scene and then tiny ones where it's snowing too hard in the next scene... It's not gonna work." [...] The scratches and bad quality of [...] "The Christmas That Almost Wasn't, But Then Was" [...] were added in by the Post-Production Department, led by Alex Duke. [...] "Our Post-Production Department never gets enough credit," [...] Scully said, [...] "But they'll take a film like [...] and make it all scratchy and make it look really old. They always do a great job." [...] The woman in [...] "The Christmas That Almost Wasn't, But Then Was" [...] was portrayed by Tress MacNeille, while the clown in the Cirque du Purée was voiced by Hank Azaria. The song that plays when Homer and Ned are driving to the school is [...] "Feel Like Makin' Love" [...] by English rock band Bad Company. Originally, the series' staff wanted to use [...] "Rock and Roll All Nite" [...] by American rock band Kiss, but they failed to obtain the rights to use it.|$|E

2500|$|During the 1970s and 1980s, Piaget's works also {{inspired}} {{the transformation of}} European and American education, including both theory and practice, leading to a more ‘child-centered’ approach. In Conversations with Jean Piaget, he says: [...] "Education, for most people, means trying to lead the child to resemble the typical adult of his society ... but for me and no one else, education means making creators... <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> inventors, innovators—not conformists" [...] (Bringuier, 1980, p.132).|$|E

2500|$|McNamara's staff {{stressed}} {{systems analysis}} {{as an aid}} in decision making on weapon development and many other budget issues. The secretary believed that the United States could afford any amount needed for national security, but that [...] "this ability does not excuse us from applying strict standards of effectiveness and efficiency {{to the way we}} spend our defense dollars.... <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a judgment on how much is enough." [...] Acting on these principles, McNamara instituted a much-publicized cost reduction program, which, he reported, saved $14 billion in the five-year period beginning in 1961. Although he had to withstand a storm of criticism from senators and representatives from affected congressional districts, he closed many military bases and installations that he judged unnecessary to national security. He was equally determined about other cost-saving measures.|$|E
2500|$|The {{film was}} well received. On Rotten Tomatoes, {{the film has}} an 87% 'Fresh' rating based on 54 reviews with an average rating of 7.3/10. On Metacritic, the film has a rating of 72 (generally {{favorable}} reviews) out of 100 based on 23 reviews. Roger Ebert gave the film {{three and a half}} stars out of four, writing: [...] "Pi is a thriller. I am not very thrilled these days by whether the bad guys will get shot or the chase scene will end one way instead of another. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a movie like that pretty skillfully before I care. But I am thrilled when a man risks his mind in the pursuit of a dangerous obsession." [...] James Berardinelli gave the film three out of four stars, writing: [...] " [...] transports us to a world that is like yet unlike our own, and, in its mysterious familiarity, is eerie, intense, and compelling. Reality is a fragile commodity, but, because the script is well-written and the central character is strongly developed, it's not hard to suspend disbelief....It probably deserves 3.1416 stars, but since my scale doesn't support that, I'll round it off to three." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mega Man 9 was co-{{developed}} by Capcom and Inti Creates. The latter {{company had}} developed the Mega Man Zero and Mega Man ZX spin-off series and employs many former Capcom members {{who worked on}} previous Mega Man games. The first six games in the original Mega Man series were created for the NES during the late 1980s and early 1990s. A plethora of spin-off series, related games, and compilations were published by Capcom {{as a result of}} the original series' immense popularity. The most recent entries in the main series, Mega Man 8 and Mega Man & Bass, were first released on more advanced home consoles in 1996 and 1998 respectively. Keiji Inafune, a designer, artist, and producer at Capcom, has been involved in most of franchise's development. As early as 2004, Inafune, credited as [...] "Inafking", publicly expressed his desire to make a Mega Man 9 as a [...] "throwback to the super [...] ", but that its creation would highly depend on the input of fans. According to Inafune, the simple fun of a classic Mega Man game [...] "doesn't fit into the grandiose and expansive world that the consumer gaming industry has become, and so <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> games that match the current expectations". He also believed that pushing for the creation of a Mega Man in the style of the original [...] "would be quickly criticized for things like being simplistic, outdated, or too expensive", thus making it too difficult to develop such games in the current climate.|$|E
