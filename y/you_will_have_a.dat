As soon as the draft is over, if you are good enough, you will be invited by five or six teams, and <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> chance to choose who you will play summer league ball with.

500|$|After the 2007 playoffs saw two wild-card {{teams with}} better records (Jacksonville Jaguars and {{eventual}} Super Bowl XLII champions New York Giants) {{go on the}} road to defeat division winners (Pittsburgh Steelers and Tampa Bay Buccaneers, respectively) during wild-card weekend, the NFL explored another proposal to change the playoffs so that the team with the better record would host the game, even if that meant a division winner went on the road. The NFL's Competition Committee withdrew the request later that offseason, with Atlanta Falcons president Rich McKay mentioning that they wanted the idea to simply get a discussion going. New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft was a strong opponent of the rule change, believing that [...] "if you win a division, it's good for your fans to know <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> home game." ...|$|E
500|$|John Pomfret of The Washington Post said a wide {{spectrum}} of Chinese and foreigners believed that Liu's award [...] "could actually resonate more deeply within China than any similar act in years". The open letter by Xu Youyu et al, which described Liu as [...] "a splendid choice" [...] because of his advancement of human rights causes and the peaceful fight against social injustice, amassed signatures from about 200 mainland intellectuals and activists; it was posted in Chinese, English, French and Japanese on websites hosted outside China. Artist and critic Ai Weiwei said that, although the regime ought to feel the most ashamed, [...] "intellectuals who had drifted away from their public responsibilities" [...] should bear some of that burden for betraying values they once strove for. Ai said that the Prize was a message from the international community to the Chinese government to respect universal human values, notwithstanding China's economic performance. Writer Liao Yiwu, a close friend of Liu, described it as [...] "a big moment in Chinese history". Another writer, Yu Jie, said he spent the night awake with tears streaming down his face – [...] "Twenty years ago Liu Xiaobo said that China needed someone with moral clarity about what China needs. Now he has become just that person, that he himself was looking for", he said. Former Chinese diplomat Yang Hengjun described it as a strong signal to the Chinese government to speed up political reform [...] "or <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> lot of enemies around you and within you." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{making his}} race for governor, Crichton had to resign as {{president}} of the Association of Former Students of Texas A, a position to which he had just been elected. A classmate from Houston named John Lindsey moved up from vice president to head the organization. He served in the post in 1967 instead. Crichton tapped a neighbor, Hughes Brown, as his campaign manager. Brown told Crichton that the assassination in Dallas meant an [...] "uphill battle, but <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> chance to advance the cause of the Republican Party in Texas, and in politics anything can happen." [...] Prior to the assassination, a poll had showed John F. Kennedy trailing in a trial heat in Texas for the 1964 general election.|$|E
2500|$|The protest arose {{controversy}} in political circles. Tsyganko reported a private {{interview with the}} Romanian envoy Artur Văitoianu. He quoted the latter as offering a deal: [...] "You must renounce [...] if only for this sole reason—that you no good Roumanian officials in Bessarabia—that is to say, none who are good nationalists. If you give up autonomy, you {{will not have a}} Commissioner-General, but <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> Bessarabian Chargé d'Affaires, a man of your own character, who will be nominated by the Central Power. The new [...] Directorate will remain in office until the meeting of the Pan-Roumanian Constitutional Assembly. Does this appeal to you as attractive?" [...] Also according to Tsyganko, Văitoianu informed the group that they needed to coalesce with Romanian nationalists in front of Great Russian revivalism, and that [...] "the national idea takes precedence over everything", implicitly threatening Sfatul dignitaries.|$|E
2500|$|When {{it turned}} to the environment, the Carbon Tax {{proposal}} came up repeatedly, with both Dion and May supporting it, although May to more ambitious figures than Dion, pointing out {{it was the most}} recommended and proven way to deal with carbon emissions by countries and organizations around the world, noting the growth that Sweden and Germany have had with this system. Harper criticized the plan, saying would increase taxpayers' burden and that Dion should be [...] "honest with the people" [...] that some environmental measures will cost the economy and said the plan includes $40 billion in carbon taxes and $26 billion in tax cuts. Dion defended the Liberal's Green Shift, saying that [...] " [...] not true at all", and that [...] "for every dollar that we will raise, <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> tax cut, and these tax cuts will be on your income". Duceppe commented that he would like targets to be applied to individual provinces, thereby allowing Quebec to financially benefit due to already-implemented greenhouse gas reductions. Layton, who favours a cap-and-trade system, said that it is a [...] "figment of Mr. Harper's imagination" [...] that emissions will fall under his plan. When Harper sought to outline his government's record on other environmental fronts, giving examples of his minority government supported the preservation {{of hundreds of thousands of}} hectares of environmentally sensitive land through the Nature Conservancy of Canada, and that the government declared a protected marine area by Lake Superior and created a whale sanctuary by Baffin Island, May responded by saying [...] "The only word he said that's true is on national parks".|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no," [...] {{said the}} {{chairman}} kindly, [...] "if {{you wish to}} make <b>a</b> statement, <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> opportunity of doing so presently. Have you any questions to ask the witness?" ...|$|R

2500|$|Upon arrival, Bree {{was shown}} as a polite and sensitive, well trained doctor, sharply {{contrasting}} her sister Brooke (Beth Allen). The character made friends quickly and appeared overly generous. However, as the character developed, {{it was revealed}} she too had a nasty side and {{was a lot more}} similar to Brooke than originally thought. Blampied enjoyed playing the personality change, labelling it as; [...] "making a great descent" [...] and stating; [...] "It's a massive change from how the character arrived and through her relationship with Brooke and Vinnie, it goes haywire. I'm looking forward to the challenge of how to justify those decisions she makes." [...] Bree's manipulative persona was blamed on her [...] "tumultuous upbringing" [...] which saw her be fostered by several families before being adopted at 10. As a result, she suffered from self-consciousness. Blampied enjoyed playing such a complex character, stating: [...] "It's definitely a lot more interesting than always being the nice guy because you do get to say and do some things you would never do and it's the furthest thing from my personal character and demeanor, so it is quite a turnaround." [...] Blampied went on to explain her mixed opinions of Bree: [...] "I obviously don't agree with what she's doing. Sometimes I read the script and go, 'Why are you doing that? There are a hundred easier ways to do that.' I have days where I really don't like Bree and what she's doing." [...] The character has been described as [...] "conniving" [...] and [...] "scheming". Blampied did not at first realise how manipulative Bree was to become and when she realised the extent to which writers were pushing her antagonistic characterisation, she described it as [...] "daunting". However Blampied had been warned, [...] "Someone told me, if you're on Shortland Street, always play your character as if you have a secret – because <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> secret!" [...] To portray Bree's penultimate breakdown, Blampied researched borderline personality disorder and severe narcissism. Blampied enjoyed how Bree was portrayed in her final scene, stating: [...] "We don't often see Bree's vulnerable side side and when we do she's still being manipulative and deceitful ... I really like the way she ends up because {{there is an element of}} real sadness to it ... when she realises how wrong she's been." [...] Blampied cared for her character and hoped for an uneventful future for Bree, [...] "I'd like to see her get well, hold down a job and maybe even get into a relationship. Life is hard for her and always has been. I care about Bree and I know that sounds like a weird thing to say." [...] Describing Bree upon her return, Blampied stated, [...] "She's still mentally very fragile, and her manipulative tendencies are most definitely still at the surface", but affirmed, [...] "she's a lot more aware now though".|$|E

6000|$|... "I do, and {{it would}} be better if we all went. Then <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> excuse for {{following}} Jernyngham and can watch him without making the thing too marked. It's a pity you didn't succeed in getting the pistol away from him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Beechnut. [...] "I am {{glad you}} are going. <b>You</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> very {{pleasant}} journey, I have no doubt,--that is, {{if you have}} accidents enough." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Why, I {{want us to}} separate. We {{have lived}} on each other all these years; now let us stop. I will go my own way without <b>you,</b> and <b>you</b> <b>will</b> go your way without me. <b>You</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> {{independent}} life of your own then." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Mr. Courthorne {{has told}} us nothing," [...] she said. [...] "Still, three gentlemen whose worth is known at Silverdale are willing to certify every point of it. If we lay the affair before Colonel Barrington, <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> {{opportunity}} of standing {{face to face with}} them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are very}} good, I'm sure," [...] he murmured. [...] "I hope <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> {{comfortable}} journey. With a nerve like yours, you'll {{be all right}} {{in a day or}} so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{has cost}} you {{a great deal of}} trouble to catch the fox, and now, if you let him go, <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> great deal more trouble in hunting him again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have sat}} up too long," [...] he said, {{as he felt}} the clasp of her cold fingers. [...] "I am afraid <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> bad night--I'm afraid you will not sleep." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{interrupted}} her vehemently. [...] "I know nothing. I wish to know nothing. Go back to London at once. I have made everything right; no one suspects. I {{shall not be}} there; <b>you</b> <b>will</b> never see me again, and <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> opportunity of undoing your mistake--our mistake." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Very well, we will. Come, mamma, let us promise, and {{see what}} these rogues will do for us. Playing father and mother is no joke, mind you; but <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> easier time of it than we do, for we shall behave ourselves,' said papa, with a virtuous expression.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, then <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> {{opportunity}} of returning at your leisure.
