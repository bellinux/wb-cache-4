40|$|Chicory, Chicorium intybus L. (Compositae), {{is a major}} {{field crop}} in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. Several pests feed on {{the leaves of the}} plant, {{resulting}} in reduced yield. The most important of these are the noctuid moths Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner), Chrysodeixis acuta (Walker), and Trichoplusia orichalcea (F.). The use of attract-and-kill traps offers an alternative to broad-based insecticides in the control of these species. Three fields were treated with normal insecticides and three fields with yellow-baited traps. Eight additional traps were placed in each field, with half of the traps containing the insecticide 2, 2 -dichlorovinyl dimethyl phosphate (dichlorvos) and half without dichlorvos; and half yellow and half green. Total moth numbers and nonphytophage diversity were measured from these eight traps. Although no differences in H. armigera or T. orichalcea catches were observed between insecticide- and trap-treated fields, numbers of C. acuta and the total number of moths were significantly higher in insecticide-treated fields. <b>Yellow</b> <b>traps</b> containing dichlorvos contained more moths than <b>yellow</b> <b>traps</b> without dichlorvos, or green traps with dichlorvos, or green traps without dichlorvos; but they also contained more nonphytophagous insects. <b>Yellow</b> <b>traps</b> also enhanced the catches of thrips on card traps associated with them.

50|$|The {{flashing}} yellow arrow has {{an important}} safety advantage {{because it can be}} shown while the through signals on the same approach are red. The circular green cannot do this because the circular green controls all vehicular movements, while the flashing yellow arrow only controls movement in the direction indicated. If oncoming traffic has a lagging protected left turn (with circular green and green left turn arrow indications), the flashing yellow arrow can continue to flash to drivers turning left across the oncoming traffic, even though the straight-ahead signals are red. This indication avoids the <b>yellow</b> <b>trap</b> problem.|$|E
5000|$|Four {{models of}} this signal exist. The one with 4 lamps {{is the most}} common. It has a steady red arrow, a steady yellow arrow, a {{flashing}} yellow arrow, and a steady green arrow. One rare version has five lenses, with a steady red arrow, two steady yellow arrows, a flashing yellow arrow, and a steady green arrow, and is only used sometimes, {{when there is a}} leading protected left turn. There are also two with 3 lamps. One signal has a steady red arrow, a steady yellow arrow, and a [...] "dual indication" [...] third lamp which can display either a steady green arrow or a flashing yellow arrow. The other 3-lamp signal has a steady red arrow, a steady yellow arrow and a flashing yellow arrow, with no green arrow; this can be used for either left or right turns, and is used to prevent <b>yellow</b> <b>trap</b> where no green arrow left turn phase exists on the approach. This cannot be done with the circular green without causing <b>yellow</b> <b>trap,</b> because a circular green releases other movements. The steady arrows all have their usual meanings. A flashing yellow arrow indicates a [...] "permitted" [...] left turn, where drivers may turn left without stopping (same as a Yield Sign), but opposing traffic has the right-of-way. The flashing yellow arrow must always be followed by either a steady yellow arrow or a steady green arrow.|$|E
50|$|The {{purpose of}} these signals is to allow traffic signal {{controllers}} to safely select movements as needed to maximize traffic flows, and to prevent vehicles from stacking up in left turn pockets {{to the point that}} they block through lanes of traffic. It also gives traffic engineers more flexibility with the leading and lagging protected left turn phase configurations, allowing for better progression (coordination) between signals. This saves gasoline by stopping fewer vehicles. The flashing yellow arrow is also meant to prevent <b>yellow</b> <b>trap,</b> which occurs when the circular signal turns yellow, and then red, while oncoming traffic still has a circular green. This traps left turning cars in the intersection while oncoming traffic continues to flow. It can also fool drivers into mistakenly assuming that oncoming traffic also has a yellow light, so they turn across live traffic, causing an accident. When the opposing direction has both a circular green and a protected left turn green arrow, the flashing yellow or a flashing red arrow—signifying caution or stop before turning, respectively—can be used for turns across oncoming traffic, but a steady green arrow cannot be used because the turn is not protected. The <b>yellow</b> <b>trap</b> issue was originally addressed by the configuration known as Dallas phasing; however, engineers changed the configuration for two reasons: a flashing yellow arrow was less confusing than a louvered green ball, and problems might ensue if the left turn signal comes out of adjustment and its indications are visible to through traffic.|$|E

50|$|In {{right-hand}} traffic, the <b>yellow</b> <b>trap</b> is {{a potentially}} dangerous scenario in traffic flow through {{a traffic light}} relating to permissive left turns. It occurs when a circular yellow light is displayed to a movement with permissive left turns, {{while at the same}} time, opposing through traffic still has a circular green light. Some drivers facing the circular yellow (then red) lights will assume the opposite direction faces the same color display, and that oncoming traffic will stop.

5000|$|In {{parts of}} Canada (the Maritime Provinces, Quebec, Ontario, Saskatchewan and Alberta), a {{flashing}} circular green light indicates right-of-way to proceed in any direction; all other entrances to the intersection will face red lights, and all pedestrian signals will indicate do-not-cross. The flashing-green phase usually precedes a normal green phase, {{in which case}} it is known as an advanced green, and an [...] sign will often be mounted next to the signal, possibly with a corresponding [...] (or similar) sign facing oncoming traffic. When a flashing-green phase occurs after a normal green phase, it as known as an extended green, but this sequence is much less common, as it can create a hazardous <b>yellow</b> <b>trap</b> for oncoming left turns.|$|E
5000|$|In some Texas {{urban areas}} {{including}} Houston and Dallas, {{the use of}} a double red light is different. It is typically used on left turn signals.

For vertically mounted signals, the two red balls or arrows are on the top, then a yellow arrow or ball, and a green arrow. It is usually accompanied by signs saying [...] "left turn signal" [...] or [...] "left on arrow only". Signals for traffic going straight use standard signals, usually mounted horizontally over the road. The use of two red lights on the left turn signal allows for redundancy in case one of the red lights burns out, while saving money by requiring only one signal for left turns per direction that needs one.
