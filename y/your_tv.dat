500|$|Blaine's {{rendition}} of [...] "Something's Coming" [...] {{was the most}} enthusiastically welcomed. It was the favorite number of Lee, VanDerWerff and Futterman; Lee said it was [...] "the best song", and added, [...] "he's kinetic, impassioned and generally delightful as Blaine-playing-Tony." [...] VanDerWerff was even more complimentary with [...] "by far the best performance", and Futterman called it [...] "the winning musical number of the episode". Both Slezak and Benigno gave it a [...] "B+", and the former complimented Criss's [...] "breathless charm and boyish enthusiasm", while the latter maintained that the actor is [...] "at his best when he's doing goofy pop numbers with kind of an off-beat twist". West gave the song an [...] "A−", and said [...] "Blaine just knows how to own the stage and <b>your</b> <b>TV</b> screen", while both Votta and Respers France wrote {{that he was the}} [...] "perfect Tony".|$|E
500|$|In 2013, Paul {{established}} the [...] "Ron Paul Channel", an Internet broadcast. Its slogan is [...] "Turn Off <b>Your</b> <b>TV.</b> Turn On the Truth." [...] Speaking about the channel, Paul said, [...] "I {{was at a}} debate one time a couple years ago, where I didn't think I got a fair shake. In a two-hour debate, I had 89 seconds. I thought, maybe there's {{something wrong with the}} media. Maybe they're not covering us fairly. I'm just using it as a pun, but there’s a bit of truth to this. We don't get a fair shake. The people who believe in liberty and limited government don't expect it from the ordinary media." [...] Speaking about his youth appeal, he noted, [...] "They don’t sit and watch TV and turn the programs on at seven o'clock to watch us like that – so I thought the technology was there. The country is ripe for the continuation of this revolution." ...|$|E
2500|$|Carl's first episode, {{broadcast}} on 20 June at 7.30pm on BBC One, received overnight ratings of 6.64million, an audience share of 33.7%, while the BBC Three repeat, shown at 1am on 21 June, was watched by 210,000 people, 8.3% {{of the total}} viewing audience at that time. Jim Shelley from the Daily Mail reviewed Carl's first two episodes, and called him [...] "a fairly undistinguished presence {{in jeans and a}} grey hoodie." [...] Shelley sarcastically wrote that [...] "He was also (you'll never guess) a menacing villain. EastEnders hasn't had a new one of those for, ooh, weeks." [...] On making his way around Albert Square to discover Ian stole his cash, Shelley wrote, [...] "Perhaps surprisingly, Carl was also such expert psychologist he should have been a master criminal rather than the petty criminal he really is, or working in Harley Street. Within 24 hours, this led him directly to his money and allowed him to negotiate an extortion rate from Ian of £500 a week plus all the free portions of Jean's Sausage Surprise he can eat. [...] It was pretty impressive for two episodes. [...] It turned out Carl was Bad News. What other kind is there in EastEnders? [...] Carl worked his magic on Ian, assessing his character and weakness, and manipulating him to get what he wanted with the skill of The Mentalist." [...] He went on to comment on Kirsty's line, [...] "He's someone you don't want in your life", saying, [...] "Or in <b>your</b> <b>TV</b> show." ...|$|E
