2500|$|On September 7, Huckabee sent an {{open letter}} to Fred Thompson {{inviting}} him to participate in a Lincoln-Douglas style debate. [...] "I share <b>your</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the debates and agree that Newt's 'Nine Nineties in Nine' concept is a far better way to make sure America's next President has the character and capacity to lead our nation forward, and that's why I have already signed that pledge," [...] Huckabee wrote in his letter. [...] "I agree that what is needed is a real discussion by the candidates about their vision for the future of our country." [...] He suggested that the first debate be held in New Hampshire.|$|E
2500|$|In Congressional {{testimony}} on October 23, 2008, Greenspan {{acknowledged that he}} was [...] "partially" [...] wrong in opposing regulation and stated [...] "Those {{of us who have}} looked to the self-interest of lending institutions to protect shareholder's equity—myself especially—are in a state of shocked disbelief." [...] Referring to his free-market ideology, Greenspan said: [...] "I have found a flaw. I don't know how significant or permanent it is. But I have been very distressed by that fact." [...] When Representative Henry Waxman (D-CA) pressed him to clarify his words. [...] "In other words, you found that <b>your</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the world, your ideology, was not right, it was not working," [...] Waxman said. [...] "Absolutely, precisely," [...] Greenspan replied. [...] "You know, that's precisely the reason I was shocked, because I have been going for 40 years or more with very considerable evidence that it was working exceptionally well." [...] Greenspan admitted fault in opposing regulation of derivatives and acknowledged that financial institutions didn't protect shareholders and investments as well as he expected.|$|E
2500|$|For Kierkegaard, true {{individuality}} {{is called}} selfhood. Becoming {{aware of our}} true self is our true task and endeavor in life—it is an ethical imperative, as well as preparatory to a true religious understanding. Individuals can exist {{at a level that}} is less than true selfhood. We can live, for example, simply in terms of our pleasures—our immediate satisfaction of desires, propensities, or distractions. In this way, we glide through life without direction or purpose. To have a direction, we must have a purpose that defines for us the meaning of our lives. Kierkegaard puts it this way in Either/Or, Here, then, I have <b>your</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> life, and, believe me, much of your life will become clear to you if you will consider it along with me as thought-despair. You are a hater of activity in life-quite appropriately, because {{if there is to be}} meaning in it life must have continuity, and this your life does not have. You keep busy with your studies, to be sure; you are even diligent; but it is only for your sake, and it is done with as little teleology as possible. Moreover, you are unoccupied; like the laborers in the Gospel standing idle in the marketplace, you stick your hands in your pocket and contemplate life. Now you rest in despair. Nothing concerns you; you step aside for nothing; “If someone threw a roof tile down I would still not step aside.” You are like a dying person. You die daily, not in the profound, earnest sense in which one usually understands these words, but life has lost its reality and you “Always count the days of your life from one termination-notice to the next.” You let everything pass you by; nothing makes any impact. But then something suddenly comes along that grips you, an idea, a situation, a young girl’s smile, and now you are “involved,” for just on certain occasions you are not “involved,” so at other times you are “at your service” in every way. Wherever there is something going on you join in. You behave in life as you usually do in a crowd. “You work yourself into the tightest group, see to it, if possible, to get yourself shoved up over the others so that you come to be above them, and as soon as you are up there you make yourself as comfortable as possible, and in this way you let yourself be carried through life.” But when the crowd is gone, when the event is over, you again stand on the street corner and look at the world.

6000|$|Gordon laughed. [...] "Are {{you going}} to hammer <b>your</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the matter into the Crown authorities? Did you ever hear of anyone who got them to {{sanction}} a proposition {{that was out of}} the usual run?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{what was}} it, Stephen? Make no bones of telling me of any blunder I may have committed, {{according}} to <b>your</b> <b>views</b> <b>of</b> duty. You {{are so much}} older than myself, that I'll stand it." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Father," [...] {{she said}} gently, [...] "don't you {{sometimes}} think that <b>your</b> <b>views</b> <b>of</b> life {{are a little}} narrow? I am very sorry indeed for what I did, inasmuch as it brought unhappiness to you. For the rest, I have nothing to regret." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let us put it {{in another}} way. I assume that <b>your</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the report takes its rise in some knowledge, on your part, of Mr. Delamayn's private affairs, which {{the rest of us}} don't possess.--Is that {{conclusion}} correct?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well; that is <b>your</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> things." [...] said Tom, more coldly than ever; [...] "you need {{say no more}} to show me what a wide {{distance}} {{there is}} between us. Let us remember that in future, and be silent." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Exactly. I {{want you}} to give me <b>your</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> it. Just tell me how it happened, and when I know the facts I'll get you to say what you {{consider}} was the cause of it, and how you think the whole affair will end." ...|$|E

6000|$|A faint colour {{stirred in}} her cheeks. [...] "Your lordship is evidently aggrieved with me. I am disconsolate.

6000|$|... "Mr. Mason," [...] said Round, {{turning to}} that gentleman, and {{altogether}} ignoring Dockwrath and his question; [...] "I {{have to tell}} you that her statement, as far as it goes, fully corroborates <b>your</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the case. As far as it goes, mind you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, by no means, sir, I like discussion. Your son {{and myself}} at Eton {{have had some}} {{encounters}} of this kind before.

6000|$|Mrs. Woodford {{sighed and}} felt hopeless. [...] "I see <b>your</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the matter, sir.

6000|$|... "I don't {{know about}} that," [...] bluntly, {{and yet not}} impolitely, {{returned}} the cosmopolitan; [...] "to be sure, accepting <b>your</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the old courtier, then if between him and Autolycus you {{raise the question of}} unprepossessingness, I grant you the latter comes off best.

6000|$|... "But {{would he}} be {{disposed}} to serve us in this pinch, Mr. Jarvie?" [...] said I.

5000|$|Always {{keep your}} eyes open to the image of man—the generic notion of his human nature—which by your work you are {{assuming}} and implying; and also to the image of history—your notion of how history is being made.

Keep your eyes open to the varieties of individuality, and to the modes of epochal change. Use what you see and what you imagine, as the clues to your study of the human variety.|$|R
6000|$|There {{could hardly}} be a better opening than this for him had he chosen to accept it. But it was not thus that he had {{arranged}} it,--for {{he had made his}} arrangements.

How was he to deploy himself on the ground before him so as to make the strategy which he had prepared answer the occasion of the day?
