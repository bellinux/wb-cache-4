500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Ken Keeler, who had been {{watching}} a lot of Frasier {{at the time and}} had been assigned to write a Sideshow Bob episode and {{he thought it would be}} a good idea to mix the two. Pierce was cast as Sideshow Bob's brother, causing Pierce to joke, [...] "Normally, I would not do something like this. But how often do <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> work with an actor like Kelsey Grammer and, more importantly, play his brother?" [...] While Sideshow Bob is addressing the crowd, a man near the back raises his hand and says [...] "probably"; he is also voiced by David Hyde Pierce, who had wanted to be a man in a crowd.|$|E
500|$|The episode [...] "Brother from Another Series" [...] {{introduces}} Bob's brother Cecil. After writer Ken Keeler {{was assigned}} to write an episode featuring Sideshow Bob, he drew inspiration from episodes of Frasier. He decided to incorporate elements of Grammer's other show into the character of Sideshow Bob, and designed Cecil to resemble Grammer's brother on Frasier. Cecil is voiced by David Hyde Pierce, who portrayed Frasier Crane's brother Niles. Pierce commented, [...] "Normally, I would not do something like this. But how often do <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> work with an actor like Kelsey Grammer and, more importantly, play his brother?" [...] Several of Frasier producers were asked to review the original script and provide feedback. Their comments were positive; they only expressed concern with a very brief scene in which Cecil talks to a visible character whom {{he refers to as}} [...] "Maris". In Frasier, Maris Crane is an unseen character, and the producers of Frasier asked that the scene be removed. Many of the interactions between Bob and Cecil were based on those of Niles and Frasier. Cecil was drawn to resemble David Hyde Pierce, while retaining a visual similarity to Sideshow Bob. According to director Pete Michels, it was difficult to draw Bob and Cecil standing together, because of their comically oversized feet.|$|E
500|$|One of Young's first actions was to hire Ray Perkins as head coach. Perkins was an {{offensive}} assistant coach on the Dallas Cowboys under Hall of Fame coach Tom Landry. In his first draft, Young drafted quarterback Phil Simms from Morehead State University with the seventh overall draft pick {{to the surprise}} of many. Simms had never played on a winning team at Morehead State, and acknowledged after he was drafted that [...] "ost people have never heard of me." [...] Young was certain of the choice though saying, [...] "nce in a while <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> get a guy with a great arm and great potential and you'd darn sight better take it." [...] Simms was unhappy with the selection, and had other teams which he favored playing on over the Giants. The Giants lost their first five games of the season with Joe Pisarcik starting at quarterback. Simms came on in relief of Pisarcik in the fifth game and started the next four, all of which the Giants won. They lost five out of their last seven however, finishing 6–10 for the year. They fell to 4–12 in 1980. Simms play was inconsistent, as he combined for 28 touchdowns against 33 interceptions while completing 48.8% of his passes over his first two seasons.|$|E

Dennis admitted that he was excited to film on the island, as he had always wanted to go.

Dennis added [...] "That's what I love about the web series, even though I'm still playing Paul Robinson and even though it's kind of Neighbours, it's also completely different so <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> play, dipping our toes in something else." ...|$|E

To interrupt him is a physical impossibility. If <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> remonstrate for a moment, he raises his voice and bears you down. True, he does you no injustice, and, with his admirable penetration, sees the disclaimer in your mind, so that you are not morally delinquent; but it is not pleasant to be unable to utter it. The latter part of the evening, however, he paid us for this, by a series of sketches, in his finest style of railing and raillery, of modern French literature, not one of them, perhaps, perfectly just, but all drawn with the finest, boldest strokes, and, from his point of view, masterly. All were depreciating, except that of Béranger. Of him he spoke with perfect justice, because with hearty sympathy.|$|E

5000|$|The album Conflict {{received}} a positive review from Billboard magazine. According to {{a writer of}} Billboard who says, [...] "Like its predecessors, [...] "Conflict" [...] finds Smith skillfully fusing R&B/soul and jazz into spacey concoctions accented by tempo shifts and insightful metaphors. Gliding over, under and around the tracks are Smith's captivatingly sly, sultry vocals." [...] From JazzandSoul.eu, [...] "Sy Smith, as mentioned, masters in presenting all different tastes of music and tempos. Ain't nobody's Bizness as a perfect crossover between old school and nu school soul, funky and mysterious in Reach down in your Soul. On B - side love Affair, soul romanticism even flirts with drum 'n bass in this unusual but splendid cut. The fantastic aspect on Conflict is that this album doesn't contain any 'ueseless' filling. All compositions are of an enormous high level, brought by a singer with a tremendous voice, an eye for original words and unique creativity. If <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> {{get your hands on}} a copy of Conflict, certainly do so. A highly recommended CD.".|$|E
