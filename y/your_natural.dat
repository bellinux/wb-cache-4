25|$|In 1970, the W-series {{plates were}} {{replaced}} by the AA·0000 to FS 9999 series with blue lettering on a white background. From 1970 to 1976 these had the slogan TAS and from 1976 to 1998, Tasmania – Holiday Isle. Between 1998 and 2004, the border colour switched to turquoise with the slogan Tasmania – <b>Your</b> <b>Natural</b> State, with a coloured decal of the Tasmanian state logo in the background (a stylised thylacine prowling through reeds on a riverbank). The update started at DS 0000. In 2004, the series reverted to the original blue borders, while retaining the other 1998 revisions.|$|E

2500|$|Various {{educators}} have estimated that Esperanto {{can be learned}} in anywhere from one quarter to one twentieth {{the amount of time}} required for other languages. Claude Piron, an Esperanto-Activist and Chinese–English–Russian–Spanish translator for the United Nations, argued that Esperanto is far more intuitive than many ethnic languages: [...] "Esperanto relies entirely on innate reflexes [...] differs from all other languages in that you can always trust <b>your</b> <b>natural</b> tendency to generalize patterns.... The same neuropsychological law [...] Jean Piaget generalizing assimilation—applies to word formation as well as to grammar." ...|$|E

2500|$|The guards repaid her {{kindness}} when, on {{the night}} of 25 November 1741, Elizabeth seized power {{with the help of the}} Preobrazhensky Regiment. [...] Arriving at the regimental headquarters wearing a warrior's metal breastplate over her dress and grasping a silver cross she challenged them: [...] "Whom do you want to serve: [...] me, <b>your</b> <b>natural</b> sovereign, or those who have stolen my inheritance?" [...] Won over, the regiment marched to the Winter Palace and arrested the infant Emperor, his parents, and their own lieutenant-colonel, Count von Munnich. [...] It was a daring coup and, amazingly, succeeded without bloodshed. [...] Elizabeth had vowed that if she became Empress she would not sign a single death sentence, an extraordinary promise for the time but one which she kept throughout her life.|$|E
2500|$|..... {{the people}} of the colonies are {{descendants}} of Englishmen... They are therefore not only devoted to liberty, but to liberty according to English ideas and on English principles. The people are Protestants... a persuasion not only favourable to liberty, but built upon it... My hold of the colonies is in the close affection which grows from common names, from kindred blood, from similar privileges, and equal protection. These are ties which, though light as air, are as strong as links of iron. Let the colonies always keep the idea of their civil rights associated with your government—they will cling and grapple to you, and no force under heaven will be of power to tear them from their allegiance. But let it be once understood that your government may be one thing and their privileges another, that these two things may exist without any mutual relation—the cement is gone, the cohesion is loosened, and everything hastens to decay and dissolution. As long as you have the wisdom to keep the sovereign authority of this country as the sanctuary of liberty, the sacred temple consecrated to our common faith, wherever the chosen race and sons of England worship freedom, they will turn their faces towards you. The more they multiply, the more friends you will have; the more ardently they love liberty, the more perfect will be their obedience. Slavery they can have anywhere. It is a weed that grows in every soil. They may have it from Spain, they may have it from Prussia. But, until you become lost to all feeling of your true interest and <b>your</b> <b>natural</b> dignity, freedom they can have from none but you.|$|E
