6000|$|... 'Anna--abide with me!' he entreated. 'Blood {{is thicker}} than water, {{and what is}} there in common between <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> now?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I promise," [...] {{he said as}} I {{gave him}} the papers. [...] "I shall in the morning, as soon as I can, come to see <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband,</b> if I may." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Can {{you look}} back to the day of your marriage? Can you {{remember}} the words which declared the union between <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> to be separable only by death? Has he treated you with brutal cruelty?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'My dear Marie,' {{began the}} Cure, 'your aunt {{has been telling}} me of this little {{difference}} between <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> affianced <b>husband.</b> Won't <b>you</b> sit down, Marie, because we shall be able so to talk more comfortably?' ...|$|R
60|$|Her ladyship and {{the ward}} of the FIZ-ZISH-UN send their best loves, in which I heartily join. If <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> dear <b>husband</b> come to town before we bring out Bulwer's comedy, I think {{we must have a}} snug reading of it.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why, your {{witness to}} be sure, ma'am. Don't you mind {{the man that}} was mending the church-window when <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> {{intended}} <b>husband</b> walked up to be made one; and the clerk called me down from the ladder, and I came and did my part by writing my name and occupation?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am sorry," [...] he continued, [...] "that {{the idea}} does not appeal to you! I can {{understand}} that my presence may serve to recall a period which <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> would doubtless prefer to forget--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then they'll start {{buying the}} Americans {{out of some}} other valley. And the Americans will spend the money and by the second {{generation}} start rotting in the cities, as <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> would have rotted if you hadn't got out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It strikes me," [...] said Jone, [...] "that these {{quarters}} {{are good}} enough for us. I'm comfortable." [...] And {{then he went on}} to say, madam, that when <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> was in London you was well satisfied with just such lodgings.|$|E
6000|$|... "But I {{venture to}} predict, on a slight acquaintance," [...] {{continued}} Mr. Shorter, undisturbed, [...] "that you will {{pick out the}} house <b>you</b> want, <b>and</b> that <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> will move into it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You have {{probably}} {{by this time}} read the narrative which I have committed to your care. I hardly dare ask how I stand in your estimation now. Is it possible that I might have seen <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> good <b>husband</b> {{if we had not}} left London so suddenly? As things are, I must now tell you in writing what I should infinitely have preferred saying to you with your friendly hand in mine.|$|R
6000|$|MAGISTRATE. Now, supposing what <b>you</b> say <b>and</b> what <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> says is true, what I have to {{consider}} is--how did he obtain access to this house, <b>and</b> were <b>you</b> in any way a party to his obtaining access? You are the charwoman employed at the house? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{said the}} judge, who looked a trifle embarrassed, [...] "I guess you are right, and Larry {{would have to}} tell you; but it's not a {{pleasant}} task to me. It is just this--we can't keep <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> any longer in this town." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Greeting, Lady of Egypt," [...] she said. [...] "Ah! had you {{taken my}} counsel in the past, that title {{might have been}} yours in very truth, and there <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> could have founded {{a new line of}} kings {{independent}} of the Empire which totters to its fall." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Have not his {{attempted}} {{crimes against}} <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> forfeited whatever rights {{the bonds of}} kinship might have accorded him?" [...] asked Tarzan. [...] "The {{fact that you are}} his sister has not deterred him from seeking to besmirch your honor. You owe him no loyalty, madame." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am glad {{indeed to}} see you again, Madame Vaillant," [...] he said. [...] "It is some twenty years, now, since <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> good <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> sister hid here, for three days, before we could smuggle you on board a ship. Ah! Those were bad times; though there have been worse since. But since our people showed {{that they did not}} intend, any longer, to be {{slaughtered}} unresistingly, things have gone better here, at least; and {{for the last four years}} the slaughterings and murders have ceased.|$|R
6000|$|... "And a jolly good thing, too," [...] Lady Amesbury declared. [...] "If ever a woman {{earned the}} right to kick the traces away for a bit, Josephine has. Don't you mind {{anything}} I say, my dear," [...] she added, as Josephine looked up at the sound of her name. [...] "You settle down to a nice comfortable flirtation, if you want to. You owe it to yourself, all right, and then there's some coming to <b>you.</b> <b>And</b> I'm <b>your</b> <b>husband's</b> aunt who tells you that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, he cannot," [...] assented the Duchesse decisively, [...] "and he is {{very rich}} <b>and</b> he loves <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> as <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> he will own all the old Cambray estates which his uncle of ragusade fame will buy up for him, <b>and</b> {{presently}} <b>your</b> son, my darling, will be Comte de Cambray, just as if that awful revolution and all that robbing and spoliation had never been. And of course everything {{will be for the}} best in the best possible world, if only," [...] concluded the old lady with a sigh, [...] "if only I thought that you would be happy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well--if I {{must speak}} plain, dear Grace--to ask her, appeal {{to her in}} the name of your common womanhood, and your many like sentiments on things, not to make {{unhappiness}} between <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband.</b> It lies with her entirely to do one or the other--that I can see." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “That {{sounds more}} probable,” said Egbert; “well, let’s {{collaborate}} on this letter of thanks {{and get it}} done. I’ll dictate, and you can scribble it down. ‘Dear Mrs. Froplinson—thank <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> {{so much for the}} very pretty calendar you sent us. It was very good of you to think of us.’” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot {{deny that}} she has spoken {{to me on the}} subject," [...] he answered, [...] "I being a lawyer. But I will say to you, in strict confidence, please, that if <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> are {{sincerely}} attached to each other there is nothing on earth she can do to separate you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{did not go}} {{into the}} Park, but turned off and cantered smartly up towards Kilburn; and, when {{we got into the}} country, galloped as if the devil were at our heels. Bless you, my love, it was all done in a minute: and the Ensign and I found {{ourselves}} regular knights of the road, before we knew where we were almost. Only think of our finding <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> new <b>husband</b> at the 'Three Rooks'! There's not a greater fence than the landlady in all the country. It was she that put us on seizing <b>your</b> <b>husband,</b> <b>and</b> introduced us to the other two gentlemen, whose names I don't know any more than the dead." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I crave your pardon, mistress," [...] {{she said}} peremptorily. [...] "My {{interests}} pre-eminently consist in being obeyed by those whom I pay for doing my behests. Now <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> worthy <b>husband</b> live here rent free and derive a benefit of ten pounds every time our guests assemble.... Well! {{in return for}} that, I make use of <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> names, {{in case of a}}ny unpleasantness with the vigilance patrol ... or in case of a scandal which might reach my Lord Protector's ears.... Up to this time your positions here have been a sinecure.... I even bore the brunt of the last fracas whilst you remained practically scathless.... But to-night, I own it, there may be some risks ... but of a truth you have been well paid to take them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm stumped. I'm up a tree. I'm clean flabbergasted, Miss Mason--or Dede, because I love to {{call you}} that name. I'm free to confess there's a mighty big heap in what you say. As I {{understand}} it, your conclusion is that you'd marry me if I hadn't a cent and if I wasn't getting fat. No, no; I'm not joking. I acknowledge the corn, and that's just my way of boiling the matter down and summing it up. If I hadn't a cent, and if I was living a healthy life with {{all the time in}} the world to love <b>you</b> <b>and</b> be <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> instead of being awash to my back teeth in business and all the rest--why, you'd marry me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Madam," [...] {{said the}} young man, leaning forward and fixing his eyes upon the ground, and then turning them upon her without moving his face towards her, [...] "with me {{all that is}} a {{different}} matter. I may have occasion later to speak to <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> upon the subject of Miss Dearborn." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then good-by," [...] said Fitzpiers; [...] "I {{may not see}} you again." [...] He {{shook hands}} with Tim {{and turned to the}} bride. [...] "Good-by, Suke," [...] he said, taking her hand also. [...] "I wish <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> {{prosperity}} in the country you have chosen." [...] With this he left them, and hastened on to his appointment.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well----You aren't a stranger, one way. Myrtle Cass--Miss Cass, should say--she's {{spoken about}} you so often. I {{wanted to call}} on you--and the doctor--but I didn't quite have the nerve. One evening I walked past your house, but <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> were talking on the porch, and you looked so chummy and happy I didn't dare butt in." ...|$|E
60|$|Here in {{my little}} country house on {{the summit of the}} hill where Falstaff did the robbery, your words have come to me in the most {{appropriate}} and delightful manner. When the story can be read all at once, and my meaning can be better seen, I will send it to you (sending it to Dean Street, if you tell me of no better way), {{and it will be a}} hearty gratification to think that <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> good <b>husband</b> are reading it together. For you must both take notice, please, that I have a reminder of you always before me. On my desk, here, stand two green leaves[68] which I every morning station in their ever-green place at my elbow. The leaves on the oak-trees outside the window are less constant than these, for they are with me through the four seasons.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} I {{am going to}} have fever. I want <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> to go into Orleans. The Prussians went in yesterday, <b>you</b> say; <b>and</b> so <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> will not have to cross any {{outposts}} to get there. There is an English ambulance there. I will write a line in pencil; and I am sure they will give him some fever medicine, and anything else I may require. Please feel in the breast pocket of my coat; you will find a pocket book, with a pencil in it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bless me, now," [...] said Lillie, briskly; [...] "you don't {{tell me that}} you're {{going to}} be so silly as to get in love with Charlie yourself! It's all well enough to keep these fellows on the tragic high ropes; but, if a woman falls in love herself, there's an end of her power. And, darling, just think of it: you wouldn't have married that {{creature}} if you could; he's poor as a rat, and always will be; these desperately interesting fellows always are. Now you have money without end; <b>and</b> of course <b>you</b> have position; <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> is a man you can get any thing in the world out of." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have no {{quarrel with}} Your Majesty, and my only reason for coming here is to {{liberate}} my father and mother, and my people, whom <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> have made your slaves, and to recover the goods King Gos has plundered from the Island of Pingaree. This I hope soon to accomplish, and if you really wish to be my friend, you can assist me greatly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Think also of your hospitals, of your schools, of your ailing {{mothers and}} feeble old men, {{of all that}} {{population}} which <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> have brought into the rocky gorge of San Tome. Are you not responsible to your conscience for all these people? Is it not worth while to make another effort, which {{is not at all}} so desperate as it looks, rather than--" ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Linley's indignation {{expressed}} {{itself by}} a look which, {{for the moment}} at least, reduced her mother to silence. Always equal to the occasion, however, Mrs. Presty's face assumed an expression of innocent amazement, which would have produced {{a round of applause}} on the stage. [...] "What have I said to make you angry?" [...] she inquired. [...] "Surely, my dear, <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> are extraordinary people." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Woman," [...] said he, [...] "last {{night the}} men of your folk - Man, woman, and maid, smothered my race in smoke. It was done like cowards; and I, a mighty man of my hands, Escaped, a single life; and now to the empty lands And {{smokeless}} hearths of my people, sail, with yourself, alone. Before your mother was born, the die of to-day was thrown <b>And</b> <b>you</b> selected:- <b>your</b> <b>husband,</b> vainly striving, to fall Broken between these hands:- yourself to be severed from all, The places, the people, <b>you</b> love--home, kindred, <b>and</b> clan - And to dwell in a desert and bear the babes of a kinless man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nay, my child, {{it is not}} God's will, but {{the fault}} of your husband; for if he would but catch the little gold-fish you would surely have children. To-night, when he comes home, tell him he must go back and catch the little fish. He must then cut it in six pieces--one of these <b>you</b> must eat, <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> the second, <b>and</b> soon after <b>you</b> will have two children. The third piece you must give to the dog, and she will have two puppies. The fourth piece give to the mare, and she will have two foals. The fifth piece bury {{on the right of}} the house door, and the sixth on the left, and two cypress trees will spring up there.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then, I think," [...] said Mr. Lorry, [...] "that I {{was very}} unhandsomely dealt with, and that I {{ought to have}} had a voice in the {{selection}} of my pattern. Enough! Now, my dear Lucie," [...] drawing his arm soothingly round her waist, [...] "I hear them moving in the next room, and Miss Pross and I, as two formal folks of business, are anxious not to lose the final opportunity of saying something to you that you wish to hear. You leave your good father, my dear, in hands as earnest and as loving as your own; he shall be taken every conceivable care of; during the next fortnight, while you are in Warwickshire and thereabouts, even Tellson's shall go to the wall (comparatively speaking) before him. And when, at the fortnight's end, he comes to join <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> beloved <b>husband,</b> on <b>your</b> other fortnight's trip in Wales, you shall say that we have sent him to you in the best health and in the happiest frame. Now, I hear Somebody's step coming to the door. Let me kiss my dear girl with an old-fashioned bachelor blessing, before Somebody comes to claim his own." ...|$|R
