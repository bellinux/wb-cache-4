2500|$|A {{stopping}} time {{with respect to}} a sequence of random variables X1,X2,X3,... is a random variable τ with the property that for each t, the occurrence or non-occurrence of the event τ = t depends only on the values of X1,X2,X3,...,Xt. The intuition behind the definition is that at any particular time t, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sequence so far and tell if it is time to stop. [...] An example in real life might be the time at which a gambler leaves the gambling table, which might be a function of his previous winnings (for example, he might leave only when he goes broke), but he can't choose to go or stay based on the outcome of games that haven't been played yet.|$|E

[...] "Mrs. Boutwell--that is to say Mrs. Waterford--couldn't stand this hotel any more than you, and she felt like you do about the colony, so she rented a little house up on Wylie Street and {{furnished}} it from the East. I took the furniture off her hands: it's still in the house, by the way, which hasn't been rented. For I figured it out that another lady would be coming along with the same notions.

My {{mistress}} used to nurse me, and kiss and fondle me, and call me her dear, sweet little Alice! But by-and-by I grew too big, and I {{was given to the}} housekeeper, and I went into the kitchen. You can see into it from where you are standing; <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> room in which I was master, for so I was when I was with the housekeeper. Of course it was a smaller place than upstairs, but it was more comfortable, for I wasn't chased about and teased by the children as I had been before. My food was just as good, or even better. I had my own pillow, and there was a stove there, which {{at this time of year}} is the most beautiful thing in the world. I used to creep right under that stove. Ah me! I often dream of that stove still! Bow-wow!' ...|$|E
6000|$|Deronda did not speak. He {{felt himself}} strangely wrought upon. The first-prompted {{suspicion}} that Mordecai might be liable to hallucinations of thought--might {{have become a}} monomaniac on some subject which had given too severe a strain to his diseased organism--gave way to a more submissive expectancy. His nature was too large, too ready to conceive regions beyond his own experience, to rest at once in the easy explanation, [...] "madness," [...] whenever a consciousness showed some fullness and conviction where his own was blank. It accorded with his habitual disposition that he should meet rather than resist any claim on him {{in the shape of}} another's need; and this claim brought with it a sense of solemnity which seemed a radiation from Mordecai, as utterly nullifying his outward poverty and lifting him into authority {{as if he had been}} that preternatural guide seen in the universal legend, who suddenly drops his mean disguise and stands a manifest Power. That impression was the more sanctioned by a sort of resolved quietude which the persuasion of fulfillment had produced in Mordecai's manner. After they had stood a moment in silence he said, [...] "Let us go now," [...] and when they were riding he added, [...] "We will get down at the end of the street and walk to the shop. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> books, and Mr. Ram will be going away directly and leave us alone." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I guess that's {{something}} so," [...] said Whitwell, with a {{long sigh}} of relief. [...] "Well, I'm glad <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it in that light, Cynthy. It's the way the feller's built, I presume, as much as anything." ...|$|R

50|$|The {{video for}} the song {{was also one of}} the only songs from Aerosmith's Geffen era not {{released}} on the video collection Big Ones <b>You</b> <b>Can</b> <b>Look</b> <b>At.</b> <b>The</b> live performance portions of the video were filmed during the day at The Summit in Houston, Texas before Aerosmith's performance there on September 30, 1994.

50|$|There are two videos for the song. One {{features}} the band performing in the Longhorn Ballroom. The other is culled from scenes from The Making of Pump, a film which documented the recording {{process of the}} Pump album. The latter received much greater airplay, and was also the version the band chose to include on their video collection Big Ones <b>You</b> <b>Can</b> <b>Look</b> <b>At.</b> <b>The</b> videos were directed by Keith Garde and Martin Torgoff.|$|E
5000|$|PopMatters {{reviewer}} John Garratt stated [...] "I recommend Myth and Mythopoeia solely {{based on}} the powerfully mysterious Missa Sine Voces"". <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> surrounding pieces {{in a number of}} ways—either as gravy, cold side-dishes, distractions, or some nice desserts. But the 13:25 track that summarizes the paradox that is John Zorn is a compelling reason to keep tracing the iconic composer’s career. As uneven and difficult as it is to follow, it’s certainly worth it when things like this happen".|$|E
2500|$|Williams responded: [...] "That's crazy. To {{think that}} oh <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> a scandal {{and think that}} that would be good for your career, where for me it took every ounce of {{credibility}} and talent that I had and wiped it out." ...|$|R

5000|$|Regarding {{songs that}} {{reflect on the}} band's history with drug abuse such as [...] "Get a Grip" [...] and [...] "Amazing", Steven Tyler declared: [...] "We were saying you can point it back {{to some of those}} old beliefs about the {{crossroads}} and signing up with the devil, that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> drugs as that: It can be fun in the beginning but then it comes time to pay your debt, and if you're not sharp enough to see that it's taking you down, then it really will get you." ...|$|E

5000|$|From the outset, Ross saw opera as {{something}} {{that had to be}} sold using similar techniques to those used to sell popular entertainment. [...] "To sell opera…you have to get their attention with a little razzle-dazzle. You've got to be simpatico. You {{have to be able to}} communicate, and you have to deliver your message with the best possible product you can manage." [...] In 1970, H. C. Schonberg of the New York Times contrasted Seattle Opera's approach to marketing to the then still staid marketing of New York's Metropolitan Opera: [...] "Out there, you see campaign buttons with the legend Opera Lives. It is in Seattle where <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sky and find an airplane skywriting the virtues of Seattle Opera. There are even auto bumper stickers about opera." [...] Further, Schonberg remarked favorably on the [...] "air of freshness and experimentation that contrasts vividly with the dull, tried and true, tired professionalism in other opera houses one could mention." ...|$|E
5000|$|While large noses {{are a sign}} of Jewishness, Jewish authors take small noses {{as a sign of}} the Gentile. [...] "Neither Sarah's way of {{speaking}} nor her manner was that of a daughter of Israel. Suddenly they remembered she didn't look Jewish, that she had a snub nose, high cheekbones, teeth that were strangely white … unlike those found among the Jews," [...] writes Isaac Bashevis Singer in his novel The Slave. [...] "'Don't you know what that girl is who is asleep beside you? Just look at that nose.' 'What nose?' 'That's the point - it's hardly even there … Schmuck, this is the real McCoy. A Shikse! (non-Jewish woman)'" [...] writes Philip Roth in Portnoy's Complaint. [...] "We started out with short beards and straight noses - <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> wall paintings - and who knows? With a slightly different genetic break in our wanderings and couplings, we might all be as blond and gorgeous today as Danish Schoolchildren," [...] writes Joseph Heller in God Knows.|$|E
5000|$|Subsequent years brought changes: the pickups {{became more}} like Gibson pickups and gained chrome covers, a trapeze {{tailpiece}} became available, the [...] "pitchfork" [...] Epiphone logo {{was added to}} the pickguard—and, in 1972, the model designation changed to EA-250. In the same period Matsumoku also made a companion short-scale bass, the 5120 / EA-260. In 1975 or '76 the guitar was replaced by the ET-255.In addition to the change from the original black plastic dual-coil Humbucker pick-ups, this guitar was altered into the EA-250 Riviera, and re-introduced with single coil pick-ups covered with the standard two coil Humbucker pick-up covers. This was a unique element on this guitar model. To identify the style, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> paper label glued inside the body of the guitar under the top f-hole. It should read EA-250 Riviera Epiphone Kalamazoo, Michigan Made in Japan. The paper is light blue in color on an authentic model, and the serial number is on the back metal neck plate. It is not possible to determine the exact year of these guitars, but it is generally accepted that the Matsumoku factory built these guitars between 1970 and 1975.|$|E
