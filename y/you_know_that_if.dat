6000|$|... "Clym, you are unjust to yourself. Depend upon it, aunt thought kindly of <b>you.</b> I <b>know</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> she had lived, {{you would}} have been {{reconciled}} with her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Dolores; <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> you, for instance, were in {{distress}} or danger I would fly to your side and risk {{my life to}} save you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> I did {{it would}} not be more terrible, Preacher? How do you know indeed that this is not your last journey from which there is no return?" ...|$|E

60|$|MRS DUBEDAT. Oh, if <b>you</b> only <b>knew</b> {{the other}} side of him as I do! Do <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> doctor, <b>that</b> <b>if</b> Louis honored himself by a really bad action, I should kill myself.|$|R
6000|$|... "For me and Charlotte. Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> {{we should}} ship, {{it would serve}} you quite right?" [...] With which he smiled--oh he smiled! [...] "And if you say much more we WILL ship." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{reassured}} her good-humouredly. 'If {{you really}} wish to go, my dear, of course I don't object. I have {{no authority to}} do that till tomorrow, and <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> I had it I shouldn't use it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It isn't whether I {{want to stay}} or not," [...] Ellen {{spoke into}} her pillow. [...] "You know that. You know that I have got to go. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> I saw him--Oh, why do you make me talk?" ...|$|E

6000|$|Suleiman-bin-Daoud {{heard one}} {{say to the}} other, 'I wonder at your {{presumption}} in talking like this to me. Don't <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> I stamped with my foot all Suleiman-bin-Daoud's Palace and this garden here would immediately vanish in a clap of thunder.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Don't <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> {{you had a}} sister, and a mother, and a housemaid, {{your mother}} would quite expect that your sister should in time have a lover, but {{that she would be}} horrified at the idea of the housemaid having a follower?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't be so foolish, child, or {{you will}} never learn how to behave. Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> you make a noise or fuss you'll disturb your {{mistress}} and she will be very angry with you. Come now, be a good dear little girl." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then, slave, he lied. He {{agreed with}} me through that dead spy {{that they should}} be slain, and do <b>you</b> not <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> I give no orders in such a case I mean death, not life? But what of the prince Hassan?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, none of it!" [...] said Paul, {{opening his}} eyes widely and reproachfully.

I thought {{you were one of}} the kind that would know." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mother Dolly's {{eyes grew}} round. 'Mind thee, Hob!' she said; 'I ken thy bark {{is worse than}} thy bite, but I would have <b>thee</b> to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> aught befall the maid between this and Greystone, I shall hold thee--and so will my Lady--guilty of a foul deed.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Mrs. MacHugh, a {{policeman}} in mufti down at Nuncombe! I wonder what our {{friend in the}} Close here will think about it!

6000|$|... "Come now, Robin, don't exaggerate," [...] said Sam in a remonstrative tone.

6000|$|... "Not to you, Morley, but worth a {{good deal}} to themselves, not to mention their wives and {{families}} and friends. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> well enough <b>that</b> <b>if</b> I had wished ever so much to return aboard last night your boat could not have got alongside the Gull for the sea. Moreover, <b>you</b> also <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> had attempted to put to sea in such weather, this leaky tub, with rotten sails and running gear, {{would have been a}} wreck on the Goodwin sands before now, and you and I, with the two men and the boy, would have been food for the gulls and fishes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{where are}} they, {{the men of}} your youth? You mad woman!" [...] {{retorted}} Babalatchi, angrily. [...] "Killed by the Dutch. Aha! But I shall live to deceive them.

6000|$|... "Not that, by any means," [...] {{he assured}} her heartily. [...] "You know that I am grateful. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> I refuse for the moment your offer it is not because I mistrust you.
