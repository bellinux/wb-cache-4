2500|$|The {{organization}} Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) put Congressman Barton on its CREW's Most Corrupt Report 2011. The article {{states that}} on Barton's 2008 financial disclosure statement, he inaccurately {{reported on the}} source of a natural gas interest that he bought into. [...] The share was purchased through a longtime donor and supporter who later died. This was discovered by the Dallas Morning News in 2010. According to the Dallas Morning News article, Barton made over $100,000 on the investment. [...] The article and CREW Report both point out how Barton buying this undervalued asset from an [...] "advisor" [...] on energy issues could be a conflict of interest to the Congressman's position as the Chair of the House's Energy Subcommittee. [...] It quotes James Thurber, a professor of government at American University, as saying [...] "If you are elected as a public servant to try to do what is right for the public generally and then <b>you</b> <b>use</b> <b>that</b> position to help bring in material wealth, I think it's unethical." ...|$|E
2500|$|Goodman {{was also}} {{responsible}} for a significant step in racial integration in America. In the early 1930s, black and white musicians could not play together in most clubs and concerts. In the Southern states, racial segregation was enforced by the Jim Crow laws. Goodman broke with tradition by hiring Teddy Wilson to play with him and the drummer Gene Krupa in the Benny Goodman Trio. In 1936, he added the vibraphonist Lionel Hampton to form the Benny Goodman Quartet. In 1939 Goodman added the pioneering jazz guitarist Charlie Christian to his band and small ensembles; Christian played with him until his death from tuberculosis {{less than three years}} later. This integration in music happened ten years before Jackie Robinson became the first black American to enter Major League Baseball. [...] " [...] popularity was such that he could remain financially viable without touring the South, where he would have been subject to arrest for violating Jim Crow laws." [...] According to Jazz by Ken Burns, when someone asked him why he [...] "played with that nigger" [...] (referring to Teddy Wilson), Goodman replied, [...] "I'll knock you out if <b>you</b> <b>use</b> <b>that</b> word around me again".|$|E

5000|$|One spirit, who was {{determined}} to be fooled no longer, thought about the problem seriously. After deep contemplation, he came up with a cunning plan that would surely allow him to capture Dong Bangsak once and for all. As it happened, Dong Bangsak was one day passing over the Tancheon. There, he came upon someone washing clothes in the stream water with a piece of charcoal. It was the spirit disguised as a human. Unable to resist this unusual sight, Dong Bang-sak asked, “Why are <b>you</b> <b>using</b> <b>that</b> charcoal to wash your clothes?” ...|$|R

[...] and she struck the floor with her foot. [...] "Henceforth, if we are to remain friends, you will refrain from lecturing me!" [...] and she left the room with a feeling of having done two men a wrong by being unjust to herself, and this feeling deepened into shame as she lay in her bed that night. It was her first serious difference with Lawson and she grew unhappy over it. [...] "But he shouldn't take sides against me like that," [...] she said, in an attempt to justify her anger.|$|E

[...] His {{face and}} voice {{must have been}} rather terrible, for the scare in their faces brought him to sudden {{consciousness}} of his own violence, and he dropped his hands. In two seconds {{they were at the}} corner. They stopped there for a second; one of them shouted [...] "Gran'pa"; then they vanished. He was left with lips and hands quivering, and a feeling that he had not known for years--the weak white empty feeling one has after yielding utterly to sudden murderous rage. He crossed over, and stood leaning against the Garden railings, with the thought: 'God forgive me! I could have killed them--I could have killed them!' There had been a devil in him. If he had had something in his hand, he might now have been a murderer: How awful! Only one had spoken; but he could have killed them both! And the word was true, and was in all mouths--all low common mouths, day after day, of his own daughter's child! The ghastliness of this thought, brought home so utterly, made him writhe, and grasp the railings as if he would have bent them.|$|E

"If it {{were only}} cotton or cloth," [...] the doctor said, [...] "I {{have no doubt}} a very strong {{solution}} of soda would take out the greater portion of the dye; but the human skin won't stand boiling water. However, I should {{say that if you}} have water as hot as you can bear it, with plenty of soda and soap, it will do something for you. No doubt, if you were to take a handful or two of very fine sand, it would help a great deal; but if <b>you</b> <b>use</b> <b>that,</b> I should not put any soda with the water, or you will practically take all the skin off, and leave your face like a raw beef steak; which will be worse than the stain and, indeed, in so hot a sun as we have, might be dangerous, and bring on erysipelas. So you must be very careful; and it will be far better for you to put up with being somewhat singular in your appearance, for a bit, than to lay yourself up by taking any strong measures to get rid of it." ...|$|E
60|$|They told {{us of our}} having {{past your}} {{carriage}} in Ledbury. Dear Mrs. Martin, I cannot dwell upon the pain of that first hour of our journey; but you will know what it must have been. The dread of it, for some hours before, was almost worse; but it is all over now, blessed be God. Before the first day's journey was at end, we felt inexpressibly relieved--relieved from the restlessness and anxiety which have so long oppressed us--and now we are calmer and happier than we have been for very long. If we could only have papa and Bro and Sette[12] with us! About {{half an hour before}} we set off, papa found out that he could not part with Sette, who sleeps with him, and is always an amusing companion to him. Papa was, however, unwilling to separate him perforce from his little playfellows, and asked him whether he wished very much to go. Sette's heart was quite full, but he answered immediately, 'Oh, no, papa, I would much rather stay with you.' He is a dear affectionate little thing. He and Bro being with poor Papa, we are far more comfortable about him than we should otherwise be--and perhaps our going was his sharpest pang. I hope it was, as it is over. Do not think, dear Mrs. Martin, that you or Mr. Martin can ever 'intrude'--you know <b>you</b> <b>use</b> <b>that</b> word in your letter. I have often been afraid, on account of papa not having been for so long a time at Colwall, lest you should fancy that he did not value your society and your kindness. Do not fancy it. Painful circumstances produce--as we have often had occasion to observe--different effects upon different minds; and some feeling, with which I certainly have no sympathy has made papa shrink from society of any kind lately. He would not even attend the religious societies in Ledbury, which he was so much pledged to support, and so interested in supporting. If you knew how much he has talked of you, and asked every particular about you, you could not fancy that his regard for you was estranged. He has an extraordinary degree of strength of mind on most points--and strong feeling, when it is not allowed to run in the natural channel, will sometimes force its way where it is not expected. You will think it strange; but never up to this moment has he even alluded to the subject, before us--never, at the moment of parting with us. And yet, though he had not power to say one word, he could play at cricket with the boys on the very last evening.|$|E
60|$|Ornament, as I {{have often}} before observed, has two entirely {{distinct}} sources of agreeableness: one, {{that of the}} abstract beauty of its forms, which, for the present, we will suppose {{to be the same}} whether they come from the hand or the machine; the other, the sense of human labor and care spent upon it. How great this latter influence we may perhaps judge, by considering {{that there is not a}} cluster of weeds growing in any cranny of ruin which has not a beauty in all respects nearly equal, and, in some, immeasurably superior, to that of the most elaborate sculpture of its stones: and that all our interest in the carved work, our sense of its richness, though it is tenfold less rich than the knots of grass beside it; of its delicacy, though it is a thousand fold less delicate; of its admirableness, though a millionfold less admirable; results from our consciousness of its being the work of poor, clumsy, toilsome man. Its true delightfulness depends on our discovering in it the record of thoughts, and intents, and trials, and heart-breakings--of recoveries and joyfulnesses of success: all this can be traced by a practised eye; but, granting it even obscure, it is presumed or understood; and in that is the worth of the thing, just as much as the worth of anything else we call precious. The worth of a diamond is simply the understanding of the time it must take to look for it before it can be cut. It has an intrinsic value besides, which the diamond has not (for a diamond has no more real beauty than a piece of glass); but I do not speak of that at present; I place the two on the same ground; and I suppose that hand-wrought ornament can no more be generally known from machine work, than a diamond can be known from paste; nay, that the latter may deceive, for a moment, the mason's, as the other the jeweller's eye; and that it can be detected only by the closest examination. Yet exactly as a woman of feeling would not wear false jewels, so would a builder of honor disdain false ornaments. The using of them is just as downright and inexcusable a lie. <b>You</b> <b>use</b> <b>that</b> which pretends to a worth which it has not; which pretends to have cost, and to be, what it did not, and is not; it is an imposition, a vulgarity, an impertinence, and a sin. Down with it to the ground, grind it to powder, leave its ragged place upon the wall, rather; you have not paid for it, you have no business with it, you do not want it. Nobody wants ornaments in this world, but everybody wants integrity. All the fair devices that ever were fancied, are not worth a lie. Leave your walls as bare as a planed board, or build them of baked mud and chopped straw, if need be; but do not rough-cast them with falsehood.|$|E
