Archy Hawkins said: [...] "How long did <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> on the front steps, Pony dear?"

60|$|If {{you recall}} the Americans {{in the nineteenth}} century who wrote books that lived forty-two years you will have to begin with Cooper; you can follow with Washington Irving, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Edgar Allan Poe, and there <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> a long time. You come to Emerson, and you have to stand still and look further. You find Howells and T. B.

Why, you could take them all and put them on one bench there [pointing]. Add the wives and children and you could put the result on, two or three more benches.|$|E

60|$|As {{it would}} be {{altogether}} too much trouble for a man-of-war's-man to keep his own shaving-tools and shave himself at sea, and since, therefore, nearly the whole ship's company patronise the ship's barbers, and as the seamen must be shaven by evening quarters of the days appointed for the business, it may be readily imagined what a scene of bustle and confusion there is when the razors are being applied. First come, first served, is the motto; and often <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> for hours together, sticking to your position (like one of an Indian file of merchants' clerks getting letters out of the post-office), ere {{you have a chance}} to occupy the pedestal of the match-tub.

Quite sure that hunting and fishing aren't taking too prominent a place in your mind? If they are, I'd better {{tell you that the}} favorite amusement in this country is chopping down big trees. There's another fact that you must consider. It takes a good deal of money to buy a ranch and, unless it's already cleared, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> a long while before you get any of the money back. This place cost me about nine thousand dollars, one way or another, and in all probability there's not a business on the Pacific Slope in which I wouldn't get twice as much as I'm getting here for the money, though I've been here a good many years. Now what do you expect to do with two dollars and a half?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now," [...] said he, {{after he}} had taken a few puffs, [...] "I'll tell you where the trouble's been with your well. People are always in too big a hurry in this world about all sorts of things as well as wells. I am a well-digger and I know all about them. We know if there is any water in the ground it will always find its way to the deepest hole there is, and we dig a well so as to give it a deep hole to go to in the place where we want it. But you can't expect the water to come to that hole just the very day it's finished. Of course you will get some, because it's right there in the neighborhood, but there is always a lot more that will come if you give it time. It's got to make little {{channels}} and passages for itself, and of course it takes time to do that. It's like settling up a new country. Only a few pioneers come at first, and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> for the population to flow in. This being a dry season, and the water in the ground a little sluggish on that account, it was a good while finding out where your well was. If I had happened along when you was talking about a well, I think I should have said to you that I knew a proverb which would about fit your case, and that is: `Let well enough alone.'" ...|$|E

6000|$|The London theatres are full, the [...] "movies" [...] crowded, and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> {{your turn}} {{for a seat}} at a restaurant. Bond Street and Piccadilly are doing a {{thriving}} business--never so thriving, you are told, and presently {{you are willing to}} believe it. The vendor beggars, so familiar a sight a few years ago, have all but disappeared, and you may walk from Waterloo Station to the Haymarket without so much as meeting a needy soul anxious to carry your bag. Taxicabs are in great demand. And one odd result of the scarcity of what the English are pleased to call [...] "petrol," [...] by which they mean gasoline, is the reappearance of that respectable, but almost obsolete animal, the family carriage-horse; of that equally obsolete vehicle, the victoria. The men on the box are invariably in black. In spite of taxes to make the hair of an American turn grey, in spite of lavish charities, the wealthy classes still seem wealthy--if the expression may be allowed. That they are not so wealthy as they were goes without saying. In the country houses of the old aristocracy the most rigid economy prevails. There are new fortunes, undoubtedly, munitions and war fortunes made before certain measures were taken to control profits; and some establishments, including a few supported by American accumulations, still exhibit the number of men servants and amount of gold plate formerly thought adequate. But in most of these great houses maids have replaced the butlers and footmen; mansions have been given over for hospitals; gardeners are fighting in the trenches, and courts and drives of country places are often overgrown with grass and weeds.|$|E
6000|$|... 'That's the point. On Monday. If it weren't for the journey, I {{should have}} been glad enough {{to be rid of}} the minx. I'm glad as it is, indeed; for a more insolent, upstanding, independent, answer-you-back-again young woman, with a sneer of her own, I never saw, Amelia--but I must get to Schlangenbad. Now, there the {{difficulty}} comes in. On the one hand, if I engage a maid in London, I have the choice of two evils. Either I must take a trapesing English girl--and I know by experience that an English girl on the Continent is a vast deal worse than no maid at all: <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> upon her, instead of her waiting upon you; she gets seasick on the crossing, and when she reaches France or Germany, she hates the meals, and she detests the hotel servants, and she can't speak the language, so that she's always calling you in to interpret for her in her private differences with the fille-de-chambre and the landlord; or else I must pick up a French maid in London, and I know equally by experience that the French maids one engages in London are invariably dishonest--more dishonest than the rest even; they've come here because they have no character to speak of elsewhere, and they think you aren't likely to write and enquire of their last mistress in Toulouse or St. Petersburg. Then, again, on the other hand, I can't wait to get a Gretchen, an unsophisticated little Gretchen of the Taunus at Schlangenbad-- I suppose there are unsophisticated girls in Germany still--made in Germany--they don't make 'em any longer in England, I'm sure--like everything else, the trade in rustic innocence has been driven from the country. I can't wait to get a Gretchen, as I should like to do, of course, because I simply daren't undertake to cross the Channel alone and go all that long journey by Ostend or Calais, Brussels and Cologne, to Schlangenbad.' ...|$|E
60|$|It was a still, hot day, {{without any}} clouds. We {{went up the}} beach to a point {{opposite}} an old construction camp. To-day when we expected the tide to be doing one thing it was doing another. Ebb and flow and flood-tide have become as difficult as Sanskrit synonyms for me. My brother took an easy and comfortable chair and sat up the beach, and I, like an ambitious fisherman, laboriously and adventurously waded out {{one hundred and fifty}} feet to an old platform that had been erected there. I climbed upon this, and found it a very precarious place to sit. Come to think about it, there is something very remarkable about the places a fisherman will pick out to sit down on. This place was a two-by-four plank full of nails, and I cheerfully availed myself of it and, casting my bait out as far as I could, I calmly sat down to wait for a bonefish. It has become a settled conviction in my mind that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> for bonefish. But all at once I got a hard bite. It quite excited me. I jerked and pulled the bait away from the fish and he followed it and took it again. I saw this fish and several others in the white patch of ground where there were not any weeds. But in my excitement I did not have out a long enough line, and when I jerked the fish turned over and got away. This was all right, but the next two hours sitting in the sun on that seat with a nail sticking into me were not altogether pleasurable. When I thought I had endured it as long as I could I saw a flock of seven bonefish swimming past me, {{and one of them was}} a whopper. The sight revived me. I hardly breathed while that bunch of fish swam right for my bait, and for all I could see they did not know it was there. I waited another long time. The sun was hot--there was no breeze--the heat was reflected from the water. I could have stood all this well enough, but I could not stand the nails. So I climbed down off my perch, having forgotten that all this time the tide had been rising. And as I could not climb back I had to get wet, to the infinite amusement of my brother. After that I fished from the shore.|$|E
