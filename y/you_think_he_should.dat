60|$|I {{have invented}} {{a good many}} useful things in my time, but never {{anything}} better than that of getting money out of people who don't want to part with it. It is always for good objects, of course. This is the plan: When you call upon a person {{to contribute to a}} great and good object, and <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> furnish about $1,000, he disappoints you as like as not. Much the best way to work him to supply that thousand dollars is to split it into parts and contribute, say a hundred dollars a year, or fifty, or whatever the sum maybe. Let him contribute ten or twenty a year. He doesn't feel that, but he does feel it when you call upon him to contribute a large amount. When {{you get used to it}} you would rather contribute than borrow money.|$|E
6000|$|But {{it was not}} on {{this matter}} that Mrs. Roden now wished to get {{assistance}} from her cousin;--certainly not with any present view towards the amelioration of her son's religious faith. That might come afterwards perhaps. But it was her present object to induce her cousin to agree with her, that her son should permit himself to be called by his father's title. [...] "But <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> take his father's name?" [...] she asked. Mrs. Vincent {{shook her head and}} tried to look wise. The question was one on which her feelings were very much divided. It was of course proper that the son should be called by his father's name. All the proprieties of the world, as known to Mrs. Vincent, declared that it should be so. She was a woman, too, who by no means despised rank, and who considered that much reverence was due to those who were privileged to carry titles. Dukes and lords were certainly very great in her estimation, and even the humblest knight was respected by her, as having been in some degree lifted above the community by the will of his Sovereign. And though she was always in some degree hostile to George Roden, because of the liberties he took in regard to certain religious matters, yet she was good enough and kind enough to wish well to her own cousin. Had there been a question in regard to an English title she certainly would not have shaken her head. But as to this outlandish Italian title, she had her doubts. It did not seem to her to be right that an Englishman should be called a Duca. If it had been Baron, or even Count, the name would have been less offensive. And then to her mind hereditary titles, as she had known them, had been recommended by hereditary possessions. There was something to her almost irreligious in the idea of a Duke without an acre. She could therefore only again shake her head. [...] "He has as much right to it," [...] continued Mrs. Roden, [...] "as has the eldest son of the greatest peer in England." ...|$|E
6000|$|When I {{used to sell}} {{hardware}} in the West, I often [...] "made" [...] {{a little}} town called Saltillo, in Colorado. I was always certain of securing a small or a large order from Simon Bell, who kept a general store there. Bell {{was one of those}} six-foot, low-voiced products, formed from a union of the West and the South. I liked him. To look at him <b>you</b> would <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> be robbing stage coaches or juggling gold mines with both hands; but he would sell you a paper of tacks or a spool of thread, with ten times more patience and courtesy than any saleslady in a city department store.|$|R
2500|$|However, Faugheen's career took a major turn as {{just before}} the start of the Punchestown festival in late April 2014, his stablemate Vautour [...] "failed a late fitness test" [...] {{according}} to Mullins, that made them switch targets during that week with Faugheen running instead in the early Tuesday's race Herald Champion Novice Hurdle which was over the 2 miles trip. In the race he was against a couple of Vautour's former rivals of which Faugheen [...] "made light work" [...] and made Mullins to reconsider his future prospect: [...] "You'd have to consider staying hurdling with him next season. Looking at him beforehand, I thought he was a chaser, but there's no harm in having another good hurdler and that would certainly make <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that maybe <b>he</b> <b>should</b> stay at this game".|$|R
5000|$|In this hugely {{international}} {{episode of}} Walt Disney World Inside Out, Scott Herriot is your host and multilenguist. Today, {{he takes the}} viewers {{on a tour of}} World Showcase at Epcot '94.Then the announcer Marc Elliot fills us in with what else Scott is doing in this episode. So pack your bags, grab your passports and [...] "keep your arms and legs inside the sofa at all times" [...] because we're heading off on a journey to visit 11 countries in [...] "27 and a half minutes". First Scott heads to Disney-MGM-Studios to ride Star Tours. His mission: Save the universe [...] "without messing up his hair". After interviewing guests waiting in line as well as a cast member who told Scott that the first time he put on the shirt that he was wearing he felt that he [...] "looked like a parking cone", Scott goes on the ride but before the ride began Scott said [...] "May the force be with you, live long and prosper and Remember the Alamo". After the ride Scott asks some kids where the restrooms are. Scott begins his tour of World Showcase starting in Germany. Scott says that Germany [...] "makes <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of cities like Hamburg, Friedberg, Steven Spielberg, me in lederhosen". Then Scott talks to Patrick Hanfert and Katrin Schnadt two of the cast members in Germany. Then Scott gives out the first of four international questions about Germany. [...] "Lederhosen translates literally to leather pants and your question is: Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> I should wear them more often?". Both Katrin and Patrick said [...] "No" [...] and [...] "Absolutely not". Scott asks how Germans say Mickey Mouse which leads into the next segment that deals with Mickey Mania the Magic Kingdom's then-newest parade. Then Scott travels to Japan and talks to two more cast members. He also gives the second question: [...] "Godzilla. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> be a good running mate in 1996?". The two cast members didn't come up with an answer so Scott heads on down to Discovery Island [...] " [...] a huge island zoo and anyone can come and see it. It's a place full of wild animals and strange sounds. A place not unlike my own dressing room". After Scott disembarked the boat, Kim Murphy The Walt Disney Company's corporate V.P. for environmental policy shows Scott around the island (including the Birds of Prey show area). In a remote segment, Howie Mandel interviews guests and goes onto the Backlot Studio tour. Scott then continues the World Showcase adventure by going to Mexico. Then Scott asks the 3rd international question: [...] "With all the countries in World Showcase, {{how are we going to}} see them all before the end of the program?" [...] The correct answer was [...] "The Cool Camera Effect". Scott heads on down to Disney's Port Orleans Resort to see and interview Denny Zavett. (Later he played the kazoo) Scott goes to Innoventions to interview guests and make phone calls. The last stop of Scott's World Showcase adventure is the United Kingdom where he interviews cast members Chris Larmour and Pauline Chinnison. Then we take a look at the calendar to check up on what's coming in the months ahead at Walt Disney World.|$|R
5000|$|In another {{interview}} with ksnmedia.com on 26 September 2010, Muriithi criticised president Kibaki {{for what he}} termed [...] "open nepotism", saying almost all the key positions in his wing of the coalition were held by his tribesmen, save for a few held by his close cousins, the Ameru. He was equally critical of Prime Minister Raila Amolo Odinga. [...] "Why is his sister the Consul General in Los Angeles yet she is a PHD in Chemistry? Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> try to at least conceal the open nepotism?" [...] he asked the interviewer.|$|E
5000|$|A {{dramatic}} shift in sound occurred in 2003 with the self-released power noise EP Human Nature. This period {{was marked by}} dark soundscaping and assaulting beat constructions, culminating in 2006 {{with the release of}} Intrusion on Isolate Records. The music of Intrusion is noted for its hyper-intensity, sonic density and high production values. It contains remixes by Polish cybercore artist Neurocore and Belgian musician Imminent. Luca Maini of Igloo Magazine summarized the album's sound as [...] "Somatic Responses mangled and speeded up to create a teeth-grinding industrial monster, ultra processed and with thousands of razor sharp beats packed together. .... This is the perfect music if you like Richard Devine but <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> stick to the smashing stuff he performs live, or maybe you think Venetian Snares is a genius but he's gone too melodic." [...] UndaCova has remixed tracks by Danny Kreutzfeldt, White Nois Stasis and Diagram of Suburban Chaos, and is also featured on the Mirex Carbon compilation, Thinner's Recore remix album, Somia's Miad, and the Polymorphik Piece series released on PuZZling Rec. The project went undercover in 2007.|$|E
5000|$|Reporter: Each {{one of you}} has won an Oscar before tonight. One of {{your other}} nominees, Kevin O'Connell, has never won in 19 tries now. Do you have {{anything}} to say to him? Minkler: I kind of figured this question was going to come up, so they said if it does come up, go ahead and say something. I think Kevin should just like maybe just go away with 19 winssicand just call it a record {{and that would be the}} end of it. We work really, really hard at what we do, all of us do in our craft. And if we, you know, stumble upon an award like this, somebody is willing to honor us with something like this, we are so grateful. And I just wonder what Kevin's trying to do out there by trying to get an award by using sympathy. And Kevin's an okay mixer but enough's enough about Kevin.Reporter: <b>You</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> take his name out of consideration? Minkler: No, no, I just think that he should take up another line of work." [...] February 24, 2007 ...|$|E

40|$|There {{are many}} people just now {{wondering}} what Barack Obama’s China policy will look like, and many eager to advise him. For instance, the National Bureau of Asian Research’s journal, Asia Policy, has published a lengthy roundtable that does just that. I was curious too—what would a learned group of distinguished China watchers, including academics, journalists, and public intellectuals, propose as the new President’s information sources? Here was the note I sent out: The United States has a new President who seems intellectually curious, will definitely {{have to deal with}} many issues relating to China, and is likely to take a trip to Beijing before too long. Imagine that you have just been told that he wants you to send him (via his Blackberry, of course) a list of five things <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> read to help him formulate policies relating to China and/or prepare to go there on a state visit. He’d also like you to give just a sentence or two of explanation for each item, justifying its inclusion on your list, and he wants you to be clear that you can choose books, articles or online pieces as readings, and that they can be old or new. What would you write? Over the next few weeks, I’ll be running the answers China Beat receives. I hope some of them will be inspirations for further inquiry and reading, for you and for (fingers crossed) President Obama. Here is the first installment...|$|E

6000|$|But again, we {{read that}} the Spirit of God takes of the things of Christ, and shows them unto us. And what are the things of Christ?

To Him all power is given in heaven and earth. He reigns, and He will reign. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>He</b> is less a Saviour now, than He was when He spoke those things to John's disciples? Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>He</b> is less able to hear and to help than He was in John's time? Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>He</b> used to care about people's bodies then, but that He only cares about their souls now?
