50|$|Tactile {{sound is}} the {{sensation}} of sound transmitted directly to the human body by contact, rather than by sound waves through the ears. For example, when you stand on a train platform {{you can feel the}} train approaching as well as hearing it. Explosions, crashes, sonic booms, and thunder are all normally felt in addition to being heard. Tactile sound is also present in the vibratory signature of musical instruments, your automobile, in aircraft, someone walking across the floor or slamming a door, even the vibration from the compressor in <b>your</b> <b>refrigerator.</b> When we talk we experience our voice in a tactile format, if we are in intimate contact with a talking individual, we can feel their voice. Besides air pressure, tactile sound can be conducted through ground motion. Tactile sound can also be transmitted through water, for example in a swimming pool or hot tub.|$|E

[...] In November 2013, the company went from its stealth mode and announced that it had received a US$25 million investment from undisclosed investors. When it first made the announcement, the company did not release the name of the kitchen brands they were working with. Minvielle Lagos recognized that among the challenges Innit faced in the industry were securing partnerships with equipment manufacturers and gaining traction in a slow-moving industry like the food industry. However, he remained confident on what lay in store for Innit in 2014.|$|E

40|$|Storing {{certain foods}} in the {{refrigerator}} is a sensible way to extend the quality, safety, and nutritional value of your groceries. Remember safety first with refrigerator storage. Microorganisms cause over 76 million cases of foodborne illness {{each year in the}} United States. The three microorganisms responsible for most cases are Norovirus, Campylobacter, and Salmonella. Improper food storage can cause these normally minor bacteria to multiply and cause foodborne illness. Most bacterial growth will happen when food is kept in the Danger Zone. The Danger Zone refers to food at a temperature between 41 degrees Fahrenheit and 135 degrees Fahrenheit. Perishable food kept at these temperatures for 2 or more hours has a higher chance for microorganism to multiply to a level that can cause foodborne illness. To keep food safe, be sure to keep <b>your</b> <b>refrigerator</b> below 41 degrees Fahrenheit. Do not over-pack <b>your</b> <b>refrigerator</b> or air {{will not be able to}} circulate properly, making it difficult to cool down the food. The warmest area of <b>your</b> <b>refrigerator</b> is the shelf space in the door and the coldest area is in the back. How long should you keep food {{in the refrigerator}}? The length of time you can safely store food in the refrigerator depends on whether or not the food is fresh, unpackaged food, or packaged food. It also matters if the package has been opened, or if the food has been cooked. The chart in this fact sheet provides information to help you decide how long to keep foods, whether fresh, cooked, packaged, or if the package has been opened. With some exceptions...|$|E

Our aim is to explore an alternative framing from behavioral theories for designing for food waste.

Once there, you are handed the bags of groceries that voters have determined are right for your family. Of course, grocery shopping doesn’t actually work that way, but schooling does. Most children in Canada and the United States are assigned to a publicly run school based on where they live and are taught a centrally determined curriculum. The structure of our education system is not only different from most other fields; it’s different even from other fields in which we wish to ensure universal access.

40|$|This {{special issue}} {{is devoted to}} recent work on mental imagery. To get a sense for the subject matter, answer the {{following}} questions: How many windows are there in your living room? What socks did you wear yesterday? Is there room in <b>your</b> <b>refrigerator</b> for a litre of milk? These questions typically evoke visual mental imagery. For example, when answering the first, people usually visualize the room, and then 'scan ' over each wall, 'seeing ' each window with their mind's eye. Similarly, if asked whether a cat's meow has a higher pitch than {{the sound of a}} blender, most people report 'hearing ' the sounds in their 'mind's ear'. Such tasks evoke auditory mental imagery. Visual mental imagery is 'seeing ' {{in the absence of the}} appropriate immediate sensory input, auditory mental imagery is 'hearing ' in the absence of the appropriate immediate sensory input, and so on. Imagery is distinct from perception, which is the registration of physically present stimuli. The examples illustrate that imagery plays an important role in memory and spatial reasoning, but as we shall see, these functions merely scratch the surface. Imagery also plays a role in abstract reasoning, skill learning, and language comprehension...|$|E
40|$|We {{assessed}} {{whether the}} refrigerator contents {{of elderly people}} {{could be related to}} subsequent admission to hospital. 132 patients aged over 65 years had a thorough assessment of their refrigerator contents and the numbers and dates of admission were recorded. Elderly people with empty refrigerators were more frequently admitted (p= 0. 032) in the month after assessment and three times sooner {{than those who did not}} have empty refrigerators (34 vs 100 days, p= 0. 002). How full is <b>your</b> <b>refrigerator?</b> According to Nadir Boumendjel and colleagues, the contents of an elderly person's refrigerator may be an indicator of imminent hospital admission. During 11 months, the researchers looked at the refrigerator's content in the homes of 132 people older than 65 years who had been discharged from hospital at least 1 month previously. Elderly people were more likely to be admitted to hospital in the month after assessment if their refrigerator was empty (fewer than three different food items), and were admitted sooner than those with a full refrigerator (about 1 month {vs} over 3 months). Quantity of food, not quality of food, was related to admission. Boumendjel and colleagues concluded that an empty refrigerator may suggest malnutrition in the elderly; therefore, early detection and preventive measures should be taken to avert the consequences of geriatric undernourishment...|$|E

40|$|As {{the empire}} realigns, late {{capitalism}} stretches like spandex {{across the globe}} and the prison-industrial complex swells, it seems indulgent, nostalgic and yet essen-tial to think through what now constitutes desire within public spaces. In 1988 I was dreaming of desire full bodied. I couldn’t sit still in that sex education class for one more visual of my ovaries infiltrated by syphilis or lips by chlamydia. Now, to speak of pleasure within the public sphere, once a seemingly reasonable if radical idea, threatens job security (Tobin, 1997). In 1997, then US Surgeon General Jocelyn Elders was removed from office: ‘Masturbation: it’s not a four-letter word, but the President fired me for saying it ’ (Elders, 1997). As all the evidence still points to the fallacies and ineffectiveness of a ‘Just Say No ’ nation-al campaign, federal funding purse strings strangle any discourse embodying the complexities of desires. My friend Evelyn Shalom, high school sexuality educator, assures me {{that the world is}} better – there are no more ‘giggles ’ in class when she introduces gay/ lesbian/bi/trans/queer issues, and many high schools enjoy gay/lesbian/trans/bi/ straight alliances; the books are more explicit; condoms and Planned Parenthood phone numbers can – in some districts – flow freely. Yet I find myself growing agnostic about schools as a site for critical education. We’re witnessing perverse versions of progress toward a socialist-feminist dream 30 years old. When repressed, desire refuses extinction. It morphs instead through a maze of underground subversions and seepage which – as we are now experiencing – can be exhausting and debilitating, filled with quiet hope and impatient outrage. It is with humility, awe and laughter that I read the essays in this volume. This collection of writers is, of course, a piñata of friends and colleagues – a delicious stew of women-wonder(ing) s about bodies and pleasures in a time when pleasure is almost outlawed, dangerous and privatized. From these essays we gain wisdom worthy of being posted on <b>your</b> <b>refrigerator</b> door, and we confront the pervers...|$|E
40|$|In {{the summer}} of 2008 the Chinese were worried about rain. They were set to host the Summer Olympics that year, and they wanted clear skies. Surely clear skies, they must have thought, would {{show the world that}} China had arrived. So they {{outfitted}} a small army (50, 000 men) with artillery pieces and rocket launchers (over 10, 000 of them) and proceeded to make war on the heavens. The idea was to 2 ̆ 2 seed 2 ̆ 2 clouds with silver iodide before they got to Beijing and rained on the Chinese parade. Or maybe the idea was to frighten the rain gods. Who knows? In any case, none of it worked: the massive, loud, and surely expensive operation had, according to most experts, no measurable effect on the weather around the Chinese capital. You might say you can 2 ̆ 7 t blame them for trying. But according to James Rodger Fleming, you can. In his incisive new book Fixing the Sky: The Checkered History of Weather and Climate Control (Columbia UP, 2010), Fleming shows that although people have always dreamed of controlling the weather, and many have tried to do so, no one has ever succeeded. The reason is simple: the atmosphere of the Earth is not like <b>your</b> <b>refrigerator</b> or oven. It 2 ̆ 7 s just too big and complex to be man-handled by any known or even realistically imagined technology. But, as Fleming demonstrates, there are always desperate people who refuse to accept this intuitive fact. So we are presented with a gallery of rain-making mountebanks, charlatans, and swindlers ever-ready to part rain-seeking fools and their rain-seeking money. In Fleming 2 ̆ 7 s excellent telling, the story is entertaining though a bit sad. It 2 ̆ 7 s sadder still that the weather-controlling con is still being run by seemingly well-intentioned people who claim they can 2 ̆ 2 fix 2 ̆ 2 global warming by means of some outsized, outrageous, and out-of-this-world engineering scheme. Fleming, who both knows the science and has looked at the history, is more than dubious. The only way we can 2 ̆ 2 fix 2 ̆ 2 the sky is to leave it alone and hope for the best. It turns out, however, that leaving the sky alone is hard. It 2 ̆ 7 s actually easier to attack it, proclaim victory, and continue as before. Just ask the Chinese...|$|E
