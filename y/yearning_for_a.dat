5|$|In his youth, Stojanović wrote poems, {{only one}} of which is published—in a 1918 issue of the {{literary}} magazine Književni jug, whose editor was future Nobel Prize winner Ivo Andrić. For this poem, Stojanović was inspired by the Serbian epic hero Ailing Dojčin. A number of Stojanović's poems are preserved in a notebook that belonged to his closest school friend Todor Ilić. According to the poet Dragan Kolundžija, Stojanović's poems are lyrical miniatures composed in free verse, focused on man and nature, and filled with melancholy. Kolundžija finds that what inspired Stojanović to write poetry is reflected in his verse Krvav je bol (Pain is bloody). According to poet Miroslav Feldman, who first met Stojanović in 1919 in Zagreb, his poems were sad and permeated with a <b>yearning</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> brighter, more joyous life.|$|E
25|$|Life in the Iron Mills {{is set in}} a {{small village}} whose center is {{industrial}} work, especially that of the iron mills. It is described as a polluted and oppressive village, inhabited by laborers, mostly “masses of men, with dull, besotted faces bent to the ground, sharpened here and there by pain or cunning; skin and muscle and flesh begrimed with smoke and ashes”. The novella's protagonist is Hugh Wolfe, an iron mill laborer who possesses artistic talent and a spiritual desire for higher forms of pleasure and fulfillment. Despite the hopefulness of Wolfe’s artistic drive, he becomes the story's tragic hero, as his <b>yearning</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> better life leads to his imprisonment and ultimate death.|$|E
500|$|The {{period of}} American history most {{dominated}} by Reagan and his policies concerning taxes, welfare, defense, {{the federal judiciary}} and the Cold War is known today as the Reagan Era, and emphasizes that the conservative [...] "Reagan Revolution," [...] led by Reagan, had a permanent impact on the United States in domestic and foreign policy. The Bill Clinton administration is often treated {{as an extension of}} the Reagan Era, as is the George W. Bush administration. Historian Eric Foner noted that the Obama candidacy in 2008 [...] "aroused a great deal of wishful thinking among those <b>yearning</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> change after nearly thirty years of Reaganism." ...|$|E

500|$|In a less {{enthusiastic}} review, Andy Gill of The Independent {{believed the}} eclectic style on Devil's Halo sounded muddled: [...] "The songs seem to bleed into one another, {{with too much}} pointlessly flashy playing leading to polite jazz-rock hell. One's left <b>yearning</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> hummable melody that might imprint one of these songs upon one's memory". Mojo wrote that while the lyrics to [...] "her songs are as politically charged as ever, musically they're laboured experiments in style". Robert Christgau from MSN Music was even less receptive, rating the album a [...] "dud", which indicated [...] "a bad record whose details rarely merit further thought".|$|E
500|$|The lyrics {{talk about}} {{substance}} abuse and the <b>yearning</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long lost love more than drugs. [...] "Just one last puff and two last regrets/Three spirits and 12 lonely steps", Gaga sings, before uttering the hook, [...] "I need you more than dope". The lyrics meant that the singer wanted her lost love more than an addict pines for drugs. [...] "Dope" [...] {{is one of the}} most personal songs of Gaga, according to Joe Lynch from Fuse. With lines like [...] "I promise this drink is my last one / I know I fucked up again / Because I lost my only friend", Lynch believed that Gaga was referring to her former assistant Jennifer O'Neil who had months ago moved to court against the singer for unpaid wages.|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} positive reviews, with critics complimenting its simple production, the songwriting and Gaga's vocals. An electronic rock lament, in {{the vein}} of Irish folk ballad rue, [...] "Dope" [...] is a bittersweet song {{centered on a}} dark theme. It has a minimal production and is only composed off Gaga's vocals sung in an intoxicated slur. Lyrically it talks about substance abuse and the <b>yearning</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long lost love. Previous to the release Gaga uploaded an image of herself on Instagram, wearing a snapback featuring the word DOPE. She also posted the song's lyrics there, triggering the social media website's concern. The artwork featured Gaga with a big blazer, her face covered with a hat and a grill that made her teeth appear larger. Media outlets found the picture to be [...] "odd" [...] and compared it to different horror films.|$|E

500|$|Edward {{returned}} to Westtown in 1855, accompanied {{by two of}} his sisters. Biology began to interest him more that year, and he studied natural history texts in his spare time. While at the school, he frequently visited the Academy of Natural Sciences. Edward often obtained bad marks due to quarreling and bad conduct. His letters to his father show he chafed at farm work and betrayed flashes of the temper for which he would later become well known. After sending Edward back to the farm for summer break in 1854 and 1855, Alfred did not return Edward to school after spring 1856. Instead, Alfred attempted to turn his son into a gentleman farmer, which he considered a wholesome profession that would yield enough profit to lead a comfortable life, and improve the undersized Edward's health. Until 1863, Cope's letters to his father continually expressed his <b>yearning</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> more professional scientific career {{than that of a}} farmer, which he called [...] "dreadfully boring".|$|E
500|$|The guitar-driven [...] "Quiero" [...] ("I Want") {{explains}} Shakira's happiness {{upon the}} return of a lover. Similarly, the mid-tempo [...] "Te Necesito" [...] ("I Need You") and the upbeat [...] "Vuelve" [...] ("Return") describe her <b>yearning</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> romantic partner to re-enter her life. [...] "Te Espero Sentada" [...] ("I Wait Sitting") expresses a desire for a romantic partner {{to be aware of}} the sorrow his absence brings to Shakira. [...] "Pies Descalzos, Sueños Blancos" [...] ("Bare Feet, White Dreams") suggests that one is happiest when living a carefree lifestyle, while [...] "Pienso en Ti" [...] ("I Think of You") notes that Shakira thinks more about a lover as times progresses. The penultimate track [...] "¿Dónde Estás Corazón?" [...] ("Where Are You Love?") asks that her boyfriend comes back to her. The album closes with its eleventh track [...] "Se Quiere, Se Mata" [...] ("You Like, You Kill"), which tells the story of expectant parents Braulio and Dana, and sees the usage of a harmonica during its chorus.|$|E
500|$|Winslet did {{not view}} Titanic as a [...] "springboard for bigger films or bigger pay cheques". She eschewed parts in {{blockbuster}} films {{in favour of}} independent productions that were not widely seen, believing that she [...] "still {{had a lot to}} learn" [...] and was unprepared to be a star. She later admitted that the decision had prevented her from [...] "burn out by the age of 25". Hideous Kinky, a low-budget drama shot before the release of Titanic, was Winslet's sole film release of 1998. She turned down offers to star in Shakespeare in Love (1998) and Anna and the King (1999) to do the film. Based on Esther Freud's semi-autobiographical novel of the same name, Hideous Kinky {{tells the story of a}} single British mother <b>yearning</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new life in 1970s Morocco. Writing for The New York Times, the critic Janet Maslin commended Winslet's decision to follow-up Titanic with such an offbeat project, and took note of how well she had captured her character's [...] "obliviousness and optimism".|$|E

2500|$|In October 2005, Neturei Karta leader Rabbi Yisroel Dovid Weiss {{issued a}} {{statement}} criticising Jewish attacks on Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

The church programs explained that [...] "the Holy Communion is the Creator's act through His people of binding the wounds and healing a broken humanity. Sometimes it is a party, sometimes not.

Therefore all people confessing their frail humanity and <b>yearning</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> greater are welcome {{to come to the}} altar and receive Holy Communion." ...|$|E

[...] Harrison biographer Elliot Huntley praises [...] "Hear Me Lord" [...] as [...] "another soulful hymn... another number given the full gospel {{treatment}} by Spector" [...] and credits Harrison with being [...] "the first white man to combine gospel and rock without sounding ludicrous". Writing in Rolling Stone Press's Harrison tribute, following the singer's death in November 2001, Greg Kot described the music as [...] "orchestrated into a dense, echo-laden cathedral of rock in excelsis by Phil Spector" [...] before noting: [...] "But the real stars of this monumental effort are Harrison's songs, which give awe-inspiring dimension to his spirituality and sobering depth to his <b>yearning</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> love that doesn't lie." ...|$|E
2500|$|In December 2001, having dropped {{original}} producer Arnold Lanni, the band met with new producer Bob Rock to start {{work on their}} fifth album. Later the following month, founding guitarist Mike Turner either quit the band or was forced out due to the other members' concerns about his guitar-playing abilities. Said Maida of Turner's departure, [...] "The last two records we've been <b>yearning</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> guitar player that can really stand up and have a strong voice and Mike (Turner) just wasn't that kind of guitar player." [...] Turner later formed the band Fair Ground with Harem Scarem guitarist Pete Lesperance and later joined the band Crash Karma. Turner's last performance with the band was for Music Without Borders at Toronto's Air Canada Centre on October 21, 2001. In the months following Turner's departure, the band held auditions for a replacement lead guitarist. Steve Mazur, {{a friend of a}} friend of drummer Jeremy Taggart, was announced as the new guitarist in April 2002. Long-time touring musician Jamie Edwards also became an official band member around this time, but later left that year for personal reasons.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the novels}} Gospa Judit (Madame Judit) and Hiša Marije Pomočnice (The Ward of Mary Help of Christians) and Križ na gori (Cross on the Mountain), all {{published}} in 1904, {{he turned to}} spiritualism and idealism, maintaining as central theme the oppressed people and their <b>yearning</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> better life. In 1906, he wrote the short novel Martin Kačur with the subtitle [...] "The Life Story of an Idealist", which is a ruthless analysis and self-analysis {{of the failure of}} an abstract idealist. During the general elections of 1907, he published the short story Hlapec Jernej in njegova pravica (The Servant Jernej and His Justice), in which he describes a clash between the individual worker and both the capitalist and traditional society, the laws of which he cannot understand. Following the electoral victory of the Slovene People's Party, he wrote his most influential play, the satire Hlapci (Serfs), in which he satirized the conformism of the former progressive and agnostic public servants who embraced Catholicism after the defeat of the liberal party. Both the liberal and the Catholic conservative parties in the Slovene Lands reacted acrimoniously against the play: its staging was delayed until after Austria-Hungary's dissolution in Autumn 1918. In the play Pohujšanje v dolini Šentflorjanski (Scandal in St. Florian Valley), Cankar made fun of the moral rigidness and culturally backward mentality of Carniola's small semi-urban society.|$|E

2500|$|... 1980 {{marked the}} return of LaKind to the lineup as a {{full-time}} member and the [...] "Doobies" [...] released their ninth studio album, One Step Closer. The LP featured the hit title track and the Top 10 smash [...] "Real Love" [...] (not {{to be confused with}} the John Lennon composition) but did not dominate the charts and the radio as Minute by Minute had two years earlier, largely due to an oversaturation of the [...] "McDonald sound" [...] by many other artists (such as Robbie Dupree's hit [...] "Steal Away", which copied the [...] "McDonald sound" [...] nearly note for note) heard on the radio at that time—not to mention McDonald's numerous guest vocal appearances on hits by other artists at that time, such as Kenny Loggins, Christopher Cross, Lauren Wood and Nicolette Larson. The album itself was also noticeably weaker musically than the previous three with the band itself sounding tired and seemingly devolving to little more than McDonald's [...] "backup band" [...] by then (according to contemporary references at that time). [...] "Ted and Michael became one faction against Pat and the rest of us,” Porter said in an interview. Long frustrated with the realities of relentless touring and <b>yearning</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> stable home life, as well as battling self-admitted problems with cocaine, Porter left the band after the recording of Closer. Session bassist Willie Weeks joined the band and the Doobies continued touring throughout 1980 and 1981 (Post-Doobies, Weeks has performed with the Gregg Allman Band, Eric Clapton, and many others).|$|E
