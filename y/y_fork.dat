50|$|The site {{consisted}} of an outer ring comprising fifty-five small split oak trunks forming a roughly circular enclosure around 7 by 6 m. Rather than {{being placed in}} individual holes, the timbers had been arranged around a circular construction trench. Their split sides faced inwards and their bark faced outwards (with one exception where the opposite is the case). One of the trunks on the south western side had a narrow <b>Y</b> <b>fork</b> in it, permitting access to the central area. Another post had been placed outside this entrance, which would have prevented anyone from seeing inside. The timbers were set in ground {{to a depth of}} 1 m from the contemporary surface although how far they originally extended upwards is not known. In the centre of the ring was a large inverted oak stump.|$|E
5000|$|Introduction: The Road Runner zooms into view, labeled [...] "Digoutius-unbelievablii", {{and then}} moves away to escape Wile E. Coyote, labeled [...] "Eatius-slobbius" [...] (no doubt due to Wile's {{protruding}} tongue at this time). Eventually, the chase {{leads to a}} 3-way <b>Y</b> <b>fork,</b> leaving the coyote confused as to which way his enemy went. The bird answers for him by pulling up behind him and beeping, giving the coyote a real headache on the rocks above. However, before he can chase the Road Runner in that direction, the bird pulls behind him a second time. Wile instantly suspects the situation, and peeks through his legs, but this only leads to him bumping {{his head on the}} ground when the Road Runner beeps. The chase now begins in full force, ending when the Road Runner barely escapes the coyote's grip and sets a bridge on fire due to his speed. Wile E. does his best to slow down when he sees the upcoming hole left in it, but fails and falls down to the ground. After hitting the ground, Wile E. comes up with an idea or two on how to catch the Road Runner.|$|E

In the early afternoon they scaled Liu-k'eng-shan (六坑山) from the east and laboriously ascended the eastern face of Yueh-mei-shan (月眉山), approaching the Chinese positions without being spotted. Late in the afternoon they captured La Table with a simultaneous frontal and flanking attack, supported by rifle and artillery fire from the French forward positions on <b>Fork</b> <b>Y.</b> The French guns on <b>Fork</b> <b>Y,</b> firing over open sights at a right angle to the axis of the attack, pounded the Chinese positions as the French infantry closed in on La Table, lifting their fire only seconds before the attackers reached the Chinese defences.|$|R
50|$|Males {{and females}} are joined {{together}} {{in a state of}} permanent copulation forming, a <b>Y</b> shape (<b>forked</b> worms). They are also known as the red worms because of their color. Females (up to 20mm long) are much longer than males (up to 6mm long). The life cycle of the gapeworm is peculiar in that transmission from bird to bird may be successfully accomplished either directly (by ingesting embryonated eggs or infective larvae) or indirectly (by ingestion of earthworms containing free or encysted gapeworm larvae they had obtained by feeding on contaminated soil).|$|R

50|$|Two {{weeks later}} the French {{attacked}} the Chinese lines {{in a more}} orderly manner. On 25 January 1885 Duchesne launched an offensive aimed at capturing the key Chinese position of La Table (Yueh-mei-shan). In three days of fighting the French captured the subsidiary position of <b>Fork</b> <b>Y,</b> enabling their artillery to enfilade the main Chinese defences, but on 28 January torrential rain halted the offensive before the French could assault La Table itself. A Chinese counterattack on <b>Fork</b> <b>Y</b> during the night of 31 January was decisively repulsed by the French with rifle fire at point-blank range. French casualties in the actions of 25 to 31 January were 21 dead and 62 wounded, mostly in the Legion and African battalions. Chinese casualties, mostly sustained in the disastrous counterattack on 31 January, probably amounted to at least 2,000 men. The dead included the battalion commander Zhang Rengui, a bandit chief from Yilan who had contributed a force of 200 militiamen to Cao Zhizhong's command.|$|R

It pricked our faces like icicles, put out fires we had spent hours lighting, turned our campsite into a bog and washed out the dye from our clothes. The men slept on beds of liquid mud. Their uniforms, filthy and faded, were a disgraceful sight. As for the Annamese coolies, shivering with cold and fever, we could hardly bear to look at them. Most of them were now clad in French hand-me-downs, which they had either filched from the field hospital or been given by kind-hearted soldiers. The unlucky ones, still clad only in a scanty loincloth, wrapped themselves in sheets or blankets to stay as warm as they could. Garnot ...|$|R

50|$|In November 1884 Duchesne led {{a column}} of legionnaires, marine {{infantry}} and Tonkinese riflemen to relieve the Siege of Tuyên Quang, defeating Liu Yongfu's Black Flag Army at the Battle of Yu Oc (on 19 November 1884). In December 1884 he {{was appointed to the}} command of the Formosa expeditionary corps at Keelung in northern Taiwan. In January 1885 he assaulted the Chinese lines of investment around Keelung, capturing the advanced Chinese position of <b>Fork</b> <b>Y.</b> In March 1885 he launched a full-scale offensive against the Chinese lines at Keelung, making a bold flank march to attack the Chinese defences on their exposed eastern flank. The French offensive was completely successful. Duchesne's men captured the key Chinese positions of La Table and Fort Bamboo on 5 March and 7 March, respectively, forcing the Chinese to retreat to new positions south of the Keelung River.|$|R
5000|$|The Strike One uses a Bergmann System {{introduced}} in the Bergmann-Bayard pistol. Unlike the Browning system, the barrel does not tilt. It is locked with a Y shaped part that during the recoil locks the barrel and bolt and halfway through it drops, releasing the barrel. The barrel stops its motion, the bolt continues back, ejecting the spent cartridge case and loading fresh cartridge and on its way back the <b>Y</b> shaped locking <b>fork</b> reengages and the barrel and bolt move together forward. Instead of tilting the barrel only moves in a straight line, thus increasing the accuracy. The Strike one is rated for +P+ ammunition and specifically set up to fire Russian 9×19mm ammunition 7N21 and 7N31 which are close to [...]357 SIG in their performance. The pistol will be available in: 9×19mm Parabellum, 9×21mm IMI, [...]357 SIG, and [...]40 S&W. There is no discussion for 10mm Auto or [...]45 ACP versions, although a [...]38 Super version is being considered due to this cartridge's popularity in Italy in particular (Italian laws forbid civilians to have weapons in the same caliber as military and police). A fully automatic version of the Strike One has been offered for the Russian Armed Forces. Longer barreled version (300mm) is also available.|$|R
