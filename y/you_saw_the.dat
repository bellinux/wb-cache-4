25|$|It {{gave you}} {{some sense of}} {{perspective}} of past, present and future. It took the myopic conflict between just black and white in the United States {{and put it on}} another level because <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> turmoil between the Armenians and the Turks, and the Cypriots and the Greeks, and the Swedes and the Danes, and the Koreans and the Japanese. Everybody had these hassles, and you saw it was a basic part of human nature, these conflicts. It opened my soul, it opened my mind.|$|E
25|$|Shooting 'Put It in a Love Song' in Rio, in Brazil, {{was very}} incredible, I {{feel that the}} energy of the city matches {{the energy of the}} song. It's sensual, it's exciting, it's so rich with color. I loved it. The people came out so heavy and so hard. I think it was exciting, {{especially}} to participate and experience it with them like that. Me and B have a good relationship. And {{to be able to have}} the chemistry we have and do it in a city that's so unique like that is unforgettable. The pictures speak a thousand words. So <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> energy out there. It was great.|$|E
500|$|Ponsford used a heavy bat——nicknamed [...] "Big Bertha". Opposition players {{sometimes}} {{joked that}} Ponsford's bat {{was larger than}} allowed under the laws of cricket and indeed in one match in Sydney, it {{was found to be}} slightly larger than permitted—the result of the bat spreading from his powerful hitting. Throughout his innings, Ponsford would pull his cap further to the left. Robinson claimed that [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> peak at a rakish angle towards his left ear you could tell he was heading for his second hundred". When volunteering for service with the Royal Australian Air Force, Ponsford discovered he possessed abnormal colour vision, unable to distinguish red from green. The examining doctor was astonished and asked Ponsford, [...] "What colour did [...] look to you after it was worn?" [...] Ponsford replied, [...] "I never noticed its colour, only its size." [...] A later study identified Ponsford's specific colour vision as protanopia, a form of dichromacy in which red appears dark. Ponsford did not enjoy batting on rain-affected wickets. When on tour his teammates did not ask if it had rained last night, merely [...] "Did Ponny wake during the night?"—legend had it that even the slightest trickle would wake him and have him anguishing over having to bat on the [...] "sticky" [...] in the morning.|$|E

500|$|Cooper's {{style of}} underplaying before the camera {{surprised}} {{many of his}} directors and fellow actors. Even in his earliest feature films, he recognized the camera's ability to pick up slight gestures and facial movements. Commenting on Cooper's performance in Sergeant York, director Howard Hawks observed, [...] "He worked very hard and yet he didn't seem to be working. He was a strange actor because you'd look at him during a scene and you'd think ... this isn't {{going to be any}} good. But when <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> rushes in the projection room the next day you could read in his face all the things he'd been thinking." [...] Sam Wood, who directed Cooper in four films, had similar observations about Cooper's performance in Pride of the Yankees, noting, [...] "What I thought was underplaying turned out to be just the right approach. On the screen he's perfect, yet on the set you'd swear it's the worst job of acting in the history of motion pictures." [...] His fellow actors also admired his abilities as an actor. Commenting on her two films playing opposite Cooper, actress Ingrid Bergman concluded, [...] "The personality of this man was so enormous, so overpowering—and that expression in his eyes and his face, it was so delicate and so underplayed. You just didn't notice it until you saw it on the screen. I thought he was marvelous; the most underplaying and the most natural actor I ever worked with." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{think he}} was the {{greatest}} directorial talent we've ever had in the [...] theater," [...] Lloyd said of Welles in a 2014 interview. [...] "When you saw a Welles production, <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> text had been affected, the staging was remarkable, the sets were unusual, music, sound, lighting, a totality of everything. We had not had such a man in our theater. He {{was the first and}} remains the greatest." ...|$|E

He is a man of good will, and I want him to show it also in wanting to prepare at least the first act for me swiftly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't deny it, sir," [...] roared the Doctor. [...] "Don't add lies, sir, to {{your other}} infamy. I <b>saw</b> <b>you</b> myself, sir. I <b>saw</b> <b>you</b> from <b>the</b> Dean's garden. I <b>saw</b> <b>you</b> kissing <b>the</b> hand of that infernal painted---" ...|$|R

2500|$|Matt Snell said, [...] "By this time, the Colts were pressing. <b>You</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> {{frustration}} and worry on all their faces." [...] After Turner's second field goal, with 4 minutes {{left in the}} third quarter, Colts head coach Don Shula took Morrall out of the game and put in the sore-armed Johnny Unitas {{to see if he could}} provide a spark to Baltimore's offense. Unitas could not get the Colts offense moving on their next drive and they were forced to punt again after 3 plays.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{within a}} month, Bellini {{had changed his}} mind and he was writing to Pasta stating that [...] "the subject has been changed, and we'll write Beatrice di Tenda. I had a hard time persuading Romani, but persuade him I did, and with good reasons. Knowing that the subject pleases you, as you told me the evening when <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> ballet.

2500|$|He said, [...] "In {{the early}} days, every time <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> {{exterior}} of Hogwarts, {{it was a}} physical miniature," [...] which was made by craftsmen and occupied a large sound stage. [...] "We {{ended up with a}} profile of how Hogwarts looked, a skyline that actually I didn't design, and it wasn't always satisfactory, and as all the novels got written and movies got made there were new requirements [...] The [...] definitely wasn't there originally, and so we were able to add that substantial piece. And in the last film, we needed an arena for the battle for Hogwarts – the big courtyard outside doubled in size, {{and if you look at}} the first movie it wasn't there at all. There were quite some liberties taken with the continuity of Hogwarts." [...] In the last film, Craig used a digital model instead of a miniature to [...] "embrace the latest technology".|$|E

2500|$|Attempting {{to focus}} on believability rather than action and gore, Peli chose to shoot the picture with a home video camera. In {{deciding}} on a more raw and stationary format (the camera was almost always sitting on a tripod or something else) and {{eliminating the need for}} a camera crew, a [...] "higher degree of plausibility" [...] was created for the audience as they were [...] "more invested in the story and the characters". Peli says that the dialogue was [...] "natural" [...] because there was no real script. Instead, the actors were given outlines of the story and situations to improvise, a technique known as [...] "retroscripting" [...] also used in the making of The Blair Witch Project. In casting the movie, Peli auditioned [...] "a few hundred people" [...] before finally meeting Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat. He originally auditioned them individually and later called them back to audition together. Peli was impressed with the chemistry between the actors, saying, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> [...] footage, you would've thought they had known each other for years." [...] During a guest appearance on The Jay Leno Show on November 3, 2009, Sloat and Featherston explained they each saw the casting call on LACasting. Featherston noted they were originally paid $500 for their work.|$|E
