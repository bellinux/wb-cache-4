50|$|A {{stereotype}} is one {{of three}} types of extensibility mechanisms in the Unified Modeling Language (UML), the other two being tags and constraints. They allow designers to extend the vocabulary of UML in order to create new model elements, derived from existing ones, but that have specific properties that are suitable for a particular domain or otherwise specialized usage. The nomenclature is derived from the original meaning of stereotype, used in printing. For example, when modeling a network <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> have symbols for representing routers and hubs.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{describes}} the Contract pattern, a programming pattern (idiom) {{that lets you}} apply assertions to guarantee pre-conditions and post-conditions of methods and invariants {{on the state of}} objects. The Design by Contract methodology—introduced by Meyer is available in the Eiffel context, but unfortunately not for all the other object-oriented languages interested to profit from Meyer’s contribution. This paper shows how to implement this idiom in Java. By using this idiom, developers can improve the reliability of their classes by precising what constraints must be satisfied by the client to guarantee correct functioning. Intent Provide an implementation of the Design by contract methodology [Meyer 88] for developing reliable classes and create robust objects in Java. This programming pattern lets you apply assertions to guarantee the pre-conditions and post-conditions of methods and invariants on the state of objects. Also Known As Design by contract Motivation Sometimes it’s necessary to restrict a class interface because you don’t want to provide all the possible input combinations for all collaborators. One way to achieve this goal is to make minimal and consistent methods that impose pre-conditions on input parameters. Moreover, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> want to ensure the class behavior by imposing post-conditions before methods return. <b>You</b> <b>might</b> also <b>need</b> <b>to</b> make sure that the class is always in a stable state. Such an approach can result in reliable classes to create robust objects...|$|R

Atlanta tried to kick a 46-yard field goal before the half expired, but Jay Feely’s attempt was no good. In the 3rd quarter Manning moved the Giant’s offense down the field and finished it with his first touchdown of his NFL career. Mannings first touchdown was a 6-yard touchdown pass to tight end Jeremy Shockey. Later in the 3rd quarter Manning threw another interception.

On the way up from Wadi Jebal you pass Ras Abu Alda, a rock formation resembling {{the head of a}} mountain goat, from where there are beautiful views to Mount Umm Shomar, another popular peak even further, and the southern ranges. From the peaks of Jebel el Bab and Bab el Donya you are looking over Mount Tarbush and can see El Tur and the Gulf of Suez. Under the peaks is the spring of Ain Nagila.Other popular peaks in the area include Jebel Ahmar, Jebel Serbal, Jebel Banat, Jebel Sana.There are many small ponds flowing under the rocks in lush Wadi Talaa Kibira, leading down to the biggest water pool of the area, Galt el Azraq, the Blue Pool. Its colour is actually changing according to the regular floods and melting snow; one brings sand from higher up, the next takes it further down and cleans the pool. It is safe to swim in it.There are permanent pools at the top of Wadi Shag Tinya, the Kharazet el Shag, in a dramatic setting. The water from Wadi Tinya drops into a granite pool from which it flows down to other pools and falls into a deep wadi, some places running under rocks, at other places resurfacing again. The water is clean enough to drink in the upper pool.At the beginning of Wadi Shag there is a narrow canyon where there are permanent granite waterpools, from which water is disappearing in the sandy floor at one place and only emerging {{before the end of the}} wadi.Water is trickling from the rock into a double fountain in Wadi Tubug. The lower fountain is for animals, locals drink from the upper one. It is considered safe, although <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> treat the water. There is also a 1000-year-old mulberry tree in Wadi Tubug, which is protected by tribal law. From Wadi Tubug you can descend to Sid Daud, a narrow and steep path leading through small caves under the boulders.In the narrow canyon of Wadi Sagar there is another water fountain. Because of the steep path, animals can't reach it and the water is safe to drink.A rarely visited route through Wadi Umm Surdi leads through a narrow canyon to Wadi Mathar and another mulberry tree which grows just outside a garden and belongs to everyone.|$|E

[...] Classroom management [...] Assessment [...] Lesson planning. Introduction. So, you've {{decided to go to}} China to teach English as a second language. Or, you are in China now beginning the adventure of a lifetime. Congratulations!By now, you probably have encountered the attitude that says, "You speak English; what more do you <b>need</b> <b>to</b> know?" Just {{the fact that you are}} a native English speaker makes you an expert in your subject matter. And since your students will have been studying English with non-native English speakers for 9 - 12 years already, their biggest need/lack will have been (or will be perceived to have been) exposure to native speakers. Every word you speak is an educational event! What more <b>might</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> know?This manual is designed to help you when all of the other things <b>you</b> <b>might</b> possibly <b>need</b> <b>to</b> know become painfully apparent. What exactly is ESL? What is a good teacher [...] . a good class… a successful lesson? How do you teach American English Conversation to a class of 50, using a British English grammar text that is 10 years out of date? How do you do ANYTHING without a computer/copy machine/overhead projector? How do you plan a lesson when you've never stood up in front of a class before? How do you even know where to start?Chapter 1 will cover the history of English and English education in China. This should give you a good overview of the topic and help you to understand your place as a foreign teacher of English in China. Chapter 2 will cover a number of topics specifically dealing with the theoretical underpinnings of Teaching ESL. It will discuss methods, concepts, issues, and some of the current debates in the field of Teaching English as a Second Language (TESL). Chapter 3 will discuss several factors that may affect your students' learning. While this section cannot hope to cover all possible influences (that is beyond the scope of this thesis), a number of the major issues are addressed. Chapter 4 begins to move out of the realm of "theory" and into the nuts and bolts of actually teaching English in China. What can you expect (and what might be expected of you) if you are assigned to teach Extensive or Intensive Reading, Writing, Grammar, Vocabulary, or Oral English?Chapter 5 offers some suggestions on organizing and managing your class time and accomplishing the myriad of daily tasks involved in teaching. Chapter 6 suggests ways <b>you</b> <b>might</b> create tests that will enable you to assess your students' <b>needs</b> prior <b>to</b> planning lessons. Chapter 7 is the longest single chapter in the manual, covering lesson planning from the semester down to the individual class level. A sample of a lesson plan is presented, as well as an explanation of how it was created. All handouts and notes required to use it in an actual class are included. Department of EnglishThesis (M.

The SGPANEL procedure creates paneled graphs in which the paneling is driven by classification variables.
