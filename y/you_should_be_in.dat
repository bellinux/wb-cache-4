2500|$|Andrew Lloyd Webber {{chose to}} save Niamh and {{eliminate}} Keisha. Before announcing his decision he said, [...] "First, I'm {{going to say}} this is a complete and utter travesty, neither of <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> the bottom two, it's completely wrong. I've been put into a situation that I have never wanted to be in. For the first time on a television show, I am angry." [...] And after choosing to eliminate Keisha, he told her, [...] "You were absolutely wonderful. I think you have a huge career ahead of you and all I can say is that I'll do anything I can to help you." ...|$|E
60|$|THE COUNT. My dear, <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> the drawing-room. You {{should not}} have kept him here.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; but I won't say it again, lest <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> {{disappointed}} <b>in</b> them. Come {{and make}} a beginning; that's all I ask of you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{the attack}} {{is made by}} night, as I propose, {{covering}} will <b>be</b> unnecessary. <b>You</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> ashore <b>in</b> force before the Spaniards {{are aware of the}} intent." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Where <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>be,</b> Prince, <b>in</b> {{your own}} house, {{the palace of}} the Shadid. But you must not speak, for you have been ill; drink this and sleep." ...|$|R
60|$|DORA. Why, Farmer, <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> the {{hayfield}} {{looking after}} your men; you couldn't have more splendid weather.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{would be}} delightful," [...] said Lady Beaumaris. [...] "Do {{you know that}} it has been one of my dreams that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> parliament?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not that I know of,' stammered Miss: 'but <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> {{the field}} now, Heathcliff. It is an hour past dinnertime: I {{thought you were}} gone.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, captain, you do {{not know}} what is vain and what is not. It is your brother's {{pleasure}} that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> kept <b>in</b> the dark for a time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am sure'--he spoke eagerly--'that in {{some way}} I could be of use to you. I shall remain at hand. I cannot bear that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> alone <b>in</b> this remote place.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{sincerely}} hope we shall!" [...] he returned, {{sitting down}} near her. [...] "It is really painful {{to think that}} <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> immured <b>in</b> this uncongenial place with your tastes and--advantages." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are marvellous, my friend," [...] he declared. [...] "With {{all these}} {{resources}} {{of science at}} your command, it seems incredible that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> the position you are." ...|$|E
6000|$|Sewell {{manifested}} {{a little}} embarrassment. [...] "Well, you won't forget your promise {{to let me}} be of use to you--pecuniarily, if <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> need of a small advance at any time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You mustn't be rash, papa, even {{to escape}} from Percycross. But, oh, papa; {{we are so happy}} and so proud. It is such an {{excellent}} thing that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> Parliament again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, indeed. And a whole army {{of accusations}} {{has been brought}} against him. I have never liked to tell you, and yet I {{do not think that}} <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> left <b>in</b> the dark." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is not his}} fault, I promise <b>you,</b> that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> left <b>in</b> the lurch. As to me, I had {{my orders}} {{to take his place}} from the only man upon earth whose word I have never disobeyed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{never saw}} such a fellow in my life. What good will that do? It is quite right that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> there <b>in</b> {{time for the}} funeral; but I don't suppose he will be buried before this day week." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your criticisms," [...] he said, [...] "are all for {{the conduct}} of the dead, and none for that of the murderer. It does not seem {{possible}} that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> sympathy with such a crime." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'All cold eggs,' said Gerald. 'In sleep, you dream, in drink you curse, and {{in travel}} you yell at a porter. No, work and love are the two. When you're not at work <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> love.' ...|$|E
6000|$|LORD CAVERSHAM. Well, sir! {{what are}} you doing here? Wasting your life as usual! <b>You</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> bed, sir. You keep too late hours! I heard of you the other night at Lady Rufford’s dancing till four o’clock in the morning! ...|$|E
6000|$|MRS. BARLOW (catching {{up a large}} old fan, and smashing {{it about}} his head). You softy--you piffler--you will never have had enough!

6000|$|... "Amiable gentleman, Mr. Jacob Meyer, now as always," [...] said Robert flushing. [...] "To {{think that}} <b>you</b> <b>should</b> have <b>been</b> <b>in</b> {{the power of}} a scoundrel like that! Well, I hope to come square with him." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Sages, <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> careful <b>in</b> what <b>you</b> say, lest you {{be punished}} with exile and {{be sent to}} a place of evil waters, and your pupils who follow you will die, and the name of Heaven will be disgraced." [...] (1:11) ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah, Katie, my bonny bird,' {{said her}} mother, seeing {{that she was}} not herself, and knowing that the {{excitement}} and overpowering feelings of gratitude were too much for her-come here; <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> bed, my foolish little puss, should you not?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{remember}} that I am still greatly your debtor, and that if, at any future time, <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> {{a position in}} which my aid may be useful, you have only to let me know, and I will stand your friend." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course it}} is,--a dreadful bore. But {{as it is}} doing so well, I am so glad that you went down to Percycross. It {{is such a great}} thing that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> the House again. It does give so much colour to our lives here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{a bit of}} it," [...] Terence said. [...] "But for <b>you,</b> I <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> prison now. If {{they had}} been ten times as many, and ten times as costly, I should still have felt your debtor, all my life.|$|R
6000|$|... "Good-night, Miss Wilson. If <b>you</b> <b>should</b> ever <b>be</b> <b>in</b> want of the {{services}} of a dog, a man, or a domestic engineer, remind Smilash of Bess and the children, and he will act for you in any of those capacities." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know why}} I should, sir. We sha'n't cross each other now, sir, {{whatever}} {{might have been}} once. But if I <b>were</b> <b>you,</b> I <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> the Indies about now, if I were not fighting the queen's battles nearer home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Because you trusted me {{and took}} what I had to offer, {{you have made}} me your friend, Covan,' said Doran-donn. 'And if <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> danger, and need help from one who can swim a river or dive beneath a wave, call to me and I will come to you.'

6000|$|At last Mr. Kenge came. HE was not altered, {{but he was}} {{surprised}} to see how altered I was and appeared quite pleased. [...] "As {{you are going to be}} the companion of the young lady who is now in the Chancellor's private room, Miss Summerson," [...] he said, [...] "we thought it well that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> attendance also.

6000|$|... "Yes, my love; I'm {{sure you}} would; nobody better. But what I mean is, {{that if you}} are to do any good, <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> kind <b>in</b> your manner. Mary Thorne has a spirit that you cannot break. You may perhaps lead, but nobody can drive her." ...|$|R
60|$|DEARTH (quickly at work). I oughtn't to {{have brought}} you out so late; <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> tucked up <b>in</b> your cosy bed at home.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Very natural, Colonel,' {{said the}} Advocate, 'that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> {{interested}} <b>in</b> the ruffian and I in the knave, that's all professional taste; but I {{can tell you}} Glossin {{would have been a}} pretty lawyer had he not had such a turn for the roguish part of the profession.' ...|$|R
