25|$|May you, O Revered One! Voluntarily permit me. I {{would like}} to confess my sinful acts {{committed}} while walking. I honour <b>your</b> <b>permission.</b> I desire to absolve myself of the sinful acts by confessing them. I seek forgiveness from all those living beings which I may have tortured while walking, coming and going, treading on living organism, seeds, green grass, dew drops, ant hills, moss, live water, live earth, spider web and others. I seek forgiveness from all these living beings, be they — one sensed, two sensed, three sensed, four sensed or five sensed. Which I may have kicked, covered with dust, rubbed with ground, collided with other, turned upside down, tormented, frightened, shifted {{from one place to}} another or killed and deprived them of their lives. (By confessing) may I be absolved of all these sins.|$|E

[...] The report was published by J.B. Lippincott, and angrily denounced by Spiritualists. There proved to be no sentiment for the Commission's continued existence, and it quietly disbanded.|$|E

2500|$|Any illusions Naguib {{might have}} had {{about the nature of}} Farouk's rule {{evaporated}} on 4 February 1942 after a standoff at Abdeen Palace during World War II, in Cairo between the British and the king. In protest at Farouk's concessions to the British, allowing them to choose the Egyptian prime minister, Naguib sent in his resignation, saying that [...] "since the army was not called upon to defend Your Majesty, I am ashamed to wear this uniform and ask <b>your</b> <b>permission</b> to resign.". On this occasion, Farouk turned down Naguib's resignation. He again attempted to resign in 1951 when Hussein Serri Amer, widely thought to be corrupt, was made head of the Coast Guard. Again, the resignation was refused.|$|E
2500|$|A mission from New Archangel was {{organized}} {{and sent to}} the Hawaiian Kingdom in October 1815. The former physician of the RAC ship Suvorov, Georg Anton Schäffer, was appointed to command likely due to Baranov simply having no one else eligible at the time. His most able officers at the time were working at RAC posts on Kodiak Island and Fort Ross in Alta California. He instructed Schäffer to present himself as a harmless explorer and obtain Kamehameha's favor, keeping his actual commission secret until then. After courting the monarch, Schäffer was to demand the restitution of the goods taken from the Bering or comparable compensation in sandalwood. If this business proceeded smoothly, Schäffer was to seek Kamehameha's patent for a monopoly in sandalwood trading. In a letter addressed to Kamehameha, Baranov warned of military intervention against Kaumalii if compensation for lost company goods didn't occur. [...] "If Kaumualii does not satisfy our just demands... with <b>your</b> <b>permission,</b> I shall treat him as an enemy." ...|$|E
