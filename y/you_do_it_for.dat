500|$|Kulwicki {{began his}} racing {{career as a}} 13-year-old kart racer. His father built engines as the crew chief for Norm Nelson and Roger McCluskey's United States Automobile Club (USAC) racecars. Because his work {{involved}} travel, Kulwicki's father was unable to help his son at most kart races, so Kulwicki's resourcefulness was often tested trying {{to find someone to}} transport his kart to the track. Even when Kulwicki asked his father for advice, he typically ended up doing most of the work himself. [...] "I showed him how", Gerry Kulwicki said. [...] "And he said: 'Why don't you do it? You can do it better.' And I said, 'Well, if <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> a while, you can do it better.'" ...|$|E
500|$|When people google Jackson, some of {{the first}} search results feature her in the nude. Jackson said of this: [...] "Instead of being known for my {{basketball}} skills, all of these nudie shots are always the first thing you see." [...] She posed nude in an Australian magazine, Black+White, that featured Olympic athletes who were set to compete in Athens in the 2004 Summer Olympics. The expensively printed magazine/book has been produced for the last three Olympic Games and, by the 2004 edition, was considered uncontroversial in Australia with its [...] "artistic" [...] approach to nude photography, and its equal coverage of male and female athletes, although it did create a stir in the United States. She also posed for the 2005 edition of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue. Of posing nude, she said, [...] "if offered the opportunity, I think that it's a personal decision. Whether <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> the money or whatever, again, I think it's a personal decision. I don't know whether I would say yes or no. I guess you cross that bridge when you come to it. I don't think it's a bad thing, I'm not against it." ...|$|E

60|$|JUDITH. <b>You</b> know <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> his sake, {{believing he}} was a more worthy man than yourself.|$|R
5000|$|The Pope orders, that in each Catholic dioceses, a day {{of public}} prayers must be {{assigned}} to admonish the faithful of this urgent need and exhort them to support by their prayers, good works and offerings for needy and abandoned children. [...] "Amen I say to you, as long as <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> one of these, the least of my brethren, <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> me" [...] (Matt. 25, 40).|$|R
6000|$|... "Say," [...] Billy began again, {{as their}} {{laughter}} eased down, [...] "what I wants know is what'd <b>you</b> wanta <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>for.</b> Say, what'd <b>you</b> wants <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>for?</b> I've been askin' that to myself ever since." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I figured you'd {{be blown}} into very little pieces {{less than a}} minute ago," [...] said one of those who stood by. [...] "What did <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>for,</b> anyway?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Say, are you crazy? What did <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>for?</b> Didn't I {{tell you}} as plain as I could; didn't I say it twenty times, {{when you came}} for the tickets, that yours was thirty-six?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Unless I make <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> me," [...] he said, {{holding out}} the letter to her. [...] "You will {{have to learn how}} weak I am. When I am really anxious I become like a child." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And no more contriving party waists out of old silk linings," [...] laughed Penelope. [...] "But it {{was very}} {{fortunate}} that <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> once, sister mine. And no more poverty puckers," [...] she concluded.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, that's different. If you {{danced with}} her {{it would look}} simply {{like a piece of}} kindness--as if <b>you</b> were <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> her amusement. If you dance with me you'll look as if <b>you</b> were <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> your own." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{must think}} it strange that I sent for you, I know," [...] she cried, {{as she turned}} to him. [...] "But I couldn't wait. I--I did not know until last night. Howard only told me then. Oh, <b>you</b> didn't <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> me! Please say <b>you</b> didn't <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> me!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes, I {{know about}} that!" [...] Pamela interrupted. [...] "That {{is the one}} thing that always sets me {{thinking}} about you. What did <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>for?</b> How did you know what it meant to me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{shook my}} head. [...] "You would not heed me," [...] I {{answered}} sadly. [...] "I dare not tell you. But {{there is one}} thing," [...] I added hastily. [...] "Will <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> me simply because I ask you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not {{another word}} on that point. I {{will not let}} <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> <b>for</b> you will get drowned as sure as you try,' said mamma, who was so timid she had panics the minute her boy was out of sight.|$|E
6000|$|Ludlow {{assumed that}} she had said more. [...] "Then if you don't think <b>you</b> ought to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> that, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> think <b>you</b> ought to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> nothing?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, papa! {{it is not}} that," [...] Amelia cried out, {{falling on}} his neck and kissing him many times. [...] "You are always good and kind. <b>You</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> the best. <b>It</b> is not <b>for</b> the money--it is--my God! my God! have mercy upon me, and give me {{strength}} to bear this trial"; and she kissed him again wildly and went away.|$|R
40|$|Whatever <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>for</b> these brothers, <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> me.

[...] ...|$|R
60|$|MRS. JONES. And I {{wish you}} wouldn't {{come after me}} like that, and hang about the house. You don't seem able to keep away at all, and {{whatever}} <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> I can't think, because of course they notice it.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was a great}} deed," [...] said Henri Marais, {{taking the}} pipe from his mouth, for I had brought tobacco among my stores. [...] "But tell me, Allan, why did <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> the sake of one who has not treated you kindly?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Did you do that? What did <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>for?</b> What's {{the sense}} of it? How do you suppose you can ever make {{yourself}} popular if you go about touching people on the shoulder? My nerves are sticking a yard out of my body this morning, Reggie!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Senator Kerry {{was asked}} about {{preemptive}} action at the last debate—he said, [...] "You've got to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> {{in a way that}} passes the test, that passes the global test where your countrymen, your people understand fully why you're doing what you're doing and can prove to the world that <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> legitimate reasons." [...] What is a global test if it's not a global veto? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Speak, if {{you have}} {{anything}} to say. And remember the commandment, Honour thy--" [...] But she broke down, when she too remembered it, and bore in mind that the precept would have called upon her daughter to honour the memory of the deceased Earl. [...] "But if <b>you</b> cannot <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> love, <b>you</b> will never <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> duty." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When you faced {{death in}} Chicago," [...] Julia went on, her voice quivering {{with the effort}} she was making to keep it low, [...] "when you offered your body to the law and preached fire and murder with your lips, <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> {{the sake of the}} people. There was nothing in life so glorious to you, then, as the one great cause. That was the man we hoped to see. Are you that man?" ...|$|R
60|$|LADY CICELY (gaily shaking out the {{finished}} coat). Oh, {{if you are}} going to dress yourself in ermine and call yourself Justice, I give you up. You are just your uncle over again; only he gets £5,000 a year for it, and <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> nothing.|$|E
6000|$|... “For {{the same}} reason for which you call me dear {{at the end of}} a {{sentence}} like that: for want of something more amusing to do. You don’t pretend to make me believe that <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> any sort of reason that a decent person would confess to.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know about}} that," [...] said Halidome, {{more and more}} {{superior}} as Shelton grew more warm; [...] "when you stand on your rights, <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> the sake of Society {{as well as for}} your own. If you want to do away with marriage, why don't you say so?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You love him!" [...] he growled. [...] "Pah! I {{see it in}} your eyes--in your tremors--that <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> <b>It</b> is <b>for</b> {{him that}} you are afraid, is't not?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{want them}} kept on, but I don't want <b>you</b> to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> that reason," [...] she said. [...] "Can't you grasp the distinction, Gregory?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Unless <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> {{yourself}} <b>for</b> the insurance," [...] {{put in a}} {{voice in}} the rear of the crowd, and then there was a laugh that made Uriah furious.|$|R
6000|$|... "I won’t have it," [...] {{said the}} captain, sternly, {{with a side}} glance at the door. [...] "If {{you want to talk}} to {{yourself}} go outside and do it. I never heard such a laugh. What did <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>for?</b> It was like an old woman with a bad cold." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're Hamp Ellison, {{in spite}} of those {{whiskers}} and that going-away bathrobe," [...] he shouted. [...] "I read about you on the bill of fare at the inn. They've run your biography in between the cheese and 'Not Responsible for Coats and Umbrellas.' What 'd <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>for,</b> Hamp? And ten years, too--gee whilikins!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes--all day. Keeping you {{company in}} your solitude. How can we {{understand}} anything," [...] she went on, [...] "without really seeing {{that this is}} what they must like to think I do for you?--just as, quite as comfortably, <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> me. The thing is for us to learn to take them as they are." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Brace up," [...] {{said the}} writer. [...] "I guess I think {{as much of}} her as <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> <b>It's</b> <b>for</b> her benefit as well as mine. I've {{got to get a}} market for my stories in some way. It won't hurt Louise. She's healthy and sound. Her heart goes as strong as a ninety-eight-cent watch. It'll last for only a minute, and then I'll step out and explain to her. You really owe it to me to give me the chance, Westbrook." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{rendering}} friendly services, yes--which have produced, as {{it turns}} out, complications. But from the moment <b>you</b> didn't <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>FOR</b> the complications, why shouldn't you have rendered them?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course it}} will," [...] said the Countess. [...] "But then Carstairs is {{so very much}} in earnest. He would have <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> himself if <b>you</b> hadn't <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> him." ...|$|R
