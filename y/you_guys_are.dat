500|$|While the Pixies {{were playing}} a concert with Throwing Muses, they were noticed by {{producer}} Gary Smith, manager of Fort Apache Studios. He told the band he [...] "could not sleep until <b>you</b> <b>guys</b> <b>are</b> world famous". The band produced a 17-track demo at Fort Apache soon afterwards, known to fans as the Purple Tape because of the tape cover's purple background. Funded by Francis' father {{at the cost of}} $1000, the recording session was completed in three days. Local promoter Ken Goes became the band's manager, and he passed the demo to Ivo Watts-Russell of the independent record label 4AD.

500|$|Germain {{left the}} series in 1993, and several new writers {{replaced}} him. At that time, Nickelodeon permitted {{the writers and}} animators to include a storyline {{about the death of}} Chuckie's mother. The development of the Rugrats Mother's Day television special was announced on December 7, 1996. Kim Cattrall provided the voice for Chuckie's mother, Melinda Finster. Germain described the episode as [...] "this whole very maudlin thing," [...] and said that he was disappointed over his inability to cover the topic. He explained: [...] "I just sat there thinking, 'We weren't allowed to do this, and now <b>you</b> <b>guys</b> <b>are</b> doing it.' That's something I regret." [...] Mary Harrington, a supervising producer of animation for Nickelodeon, described it as one of her favorite episodes of Rugrats, and commended the writers and producers for their handling of the subject matter.|$|E

Forte's performance of [...] "Pie Jesu" [...] won praise from the judges; Howard Stern said they had the element of surprise because they looked like schlubs, but next time [...] "we're going to know that you're not schlubs, but you're fantastic singers".

It just kills me. It makes me want to cry. You don’t know what kind of good you’re doing." [...] He then walked across the street in an attempt to enter the Scientology building, but was prevented from entering by three hired private security guards.

500|$|Hader, who had {{previously}} cameoed in Monsters University, was cast to voice Fear, a role that he felt he [...] "weaseled" [...] his way into by being a [...] "huge fan" [...] of Pixar's filmography.

He was invited to play Fear {{by the end of}} his stay there, but was also asked to contact fellow Saturday Night Live (SNL) veteran Amy Poehler, whom the team viewed as perfect for the character of Joy. [...] "They said: 'Would you mind calling Amy? We don't want to call her and have her think we're some weirdo,'" [...] he recalled. He phoned Poehler and explained the story to her, noting that her role would be the driving force in the film.

In February 2011 Stargate said that Rihanna approached the Norwegian production duo before she began recording the then-untitled project, saying {{that she wanted to}} have fun and produce happy, uptempo songs. According to Tor Erik Hermansen of Stargate, [...] "Only Girl (In the World)" [...] was the first song created for Loud and Rihanna decided to include it on the album before recording her vocals. In a webchat with fans, Rihanna said that she wanted {{to take the next step}} as an artist: [...] "I didn’t want to go backward and remake Good Girl Gone Bad. I wanted the next step in the evolution of Rihanna, and it’s perfect for us. <b>You</b> <b>guys</b> <b>are</b> always defending me, so now you’ve got some great songs to justify it."

500|$|Reviews for The Boys from Baghdad High were {{generally}} favourable. The Huffington Post said that giving the video cameras {{to the students}} was an excellent idea because the depiction of their school-life versus the increasing danger was captured [...] "with neutral equality [...] that the film is able to capture the interiority of its subjects more acutely than a straight-forward examination of violence would". Thomas Sutcliffe of The Independent said, [...] "its storyline was governed not by a tick-list of stock narrative dilemmas and secrets but the cruel uncertainties that occupation and insurgency have brought to Baghdad." [...] Time Out New York gave the film five out of five stars, and PopMatters rated it 8 out of 10. The Washington Posts Paul Farhi said, [...] "HBO has carved a niche as the TV home {{of some of the}} most compelling programs about the Iraq war ... Baghdad High does no harm to HBO's burgeoning war cred." [...] Variety, The Christian Science Monitor, LA Weekly, and the Los Angeles Times also praised the film. At the Question-and-Answer session following a screening at the Tribeca Film Festival, one audience member, a new recruit to the United States Marine Corps, told Ali, who had also attended, [...] "I finally know what life is like behind those walls and what <b>you</b> <b>guys</b> <b>are</b> like, and it's been really, really fantastic." ...|$|E

500|$|Also in December, {{the music}} video for [...] "I'm Made of Wax, Larry, What Are You Made Of?" [...] was filmed, {{directed}} by Dan Dobi. In early March 2010 the band announced via their Twitter account that the video {{was set for}} release, with a date of March 16. This was further confirmed a few days later, with some fans being able to view it before its release. A delay in releasing it occurred as the band were trying to negotiate with MTV, as Westfall commented: [...] "I think it's more important to have them [...] on board, instead of just putting it on, like, YouTube." [...] "Have Faith in Me" [...] was released as a radio single on March 2, 2010. The video for [...] "I'm Made of Wax, Larry, What Are You Made Of?" [...] had its television premiere on MTV on March 16. The music video {{was based on an}} idea from a friend Kyle Crawford, as McKinnon said: [...] "He was like, 'Hey, you should totally make a video where <b>you</b> <b>guys</b> <b>are</b> playing kickball and you play a bunch of kids and just kick the s*** out of them?" [...] I was like, [...] "That is a great idea. Let's look into it.'" [...] Asked why it was the band's next music video, Westfall said [...] "it stands out compared to the other songs" [...] as [...] "it's a harder song." [...] The song was also released as a radio single.|$|E
500|$|The album's earlier {{sessions}} {{produced a}} little material {{that has made}} the final cut. West had brought a majority of his usual production crew onto the project, the same crew that had assisted in the creation of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. One of the main exceptions was producer No I.D., who felt that the two artists weren't pushing forward enough with the music. In an interview with Complex, No I.D. commented about the project that [...] "you're going to sell, because you're already big. But <b>you</b> <b>guys</b> <b>are</b> important to push this forward. Push intelligence and decadence and all of the above forward in a creative manner." [...] While his advice was acknowledged to a degree, he ultimately had very little part in the finished project. In January 2011, they regrouped and rented a block of rooms at the Mercer Hotel in New York City and invited a select group of producers and recording artists. Chauncey [...] "Hit-Boy" [...] Hollis, who produced the track [...] "Niggas in Paris", said of recording at the hotel, [...] "There was music going on in every room. I had a room where I was cranking out beats, and then I'd go into the main room with Jay and [...] and play beats for them. Kanye is really hands-on.

40|$|A {{flight data}} {{acquisition}} system was developed to aid unmanned vehicle designers in verifying the vehicle’s design performance. The system is reconfigurable and allows the designer to choose the correct combination of complexity, risk, and cost for a given flight test.

System functionality, repeatbility, and accuracy was validated by collecting data during multiple flights of a radio-controlled aircraft.
