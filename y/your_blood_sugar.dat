40|$|AbstractObjectivesTo {{evaluate}} {{the association between}} hypoglycemia and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) {{in the context of}} a clinical trial using both an objectively confirmed and a patient-reported measure of hypoglycemia. MethodsDuring a phase III, double-arm, randomized study, patients completed the short form 36 health survey (SF- 36), a generic HRQoL questionnaire, at baseline and at weeks 24, 52, and 104. The objectively confirmed measure of hypoglycemia was based on a combination of plasma glucose measure and presence of hypoglycemia-related symptoms. The patient-reported frequency of hypoglycemia was defined as the following item: “How often have you felt that <b>your</b> <b>blood</b> <b>sugars</b> have been unacceptably low recently?” The association between hypoglycemia and HRQoL was evaluated in intent-to-treat patients (N = 3059) by using repeated-measurements analyses, with SF- 36 scores used as explained variables and baseline SF- 36 score, age, sex, country, time, and either number of objectively confirmed hypoglycemic events (0, ≥ 1) or patient-reported frequency of hypoglycemia (continuous variable 0 – 6) as explanatory variables. ResultsDuring study duration, less than 6 % of patients experienced at least one objectively confirmed hypoglycemic event and about half the patients reported unacceptably low <b>blood</b> <b>sugars</b> “none of the time. ” The association between the number of objectively confirmed hypoglycemic events and HRQoL was not statistically significant, while the patient-reported frequency of hypoglycemia was statistically significantly related to all SF- 36 scores (P < 0. 001), except physical functioning; patients reporting greater perceived frequency of hypoglycemia had worse HRQoL.

40|$|Diabetic {{nephropathy}} is {{kidney disease}} that develops {{as a result}} of diabetes mellitus (DM). DM, also called simply diabetes. This disease damages many organs, including the eyes, nerves, blood vessels, heart, and kidneys. Diabetes is {{the most common cause of}} kidney failure and accounts for over one-third of all patients who are on dialysis. Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is typically defined by macro albuminuria—that is, a urinary albumin excretion of more than 300 mg in a 24 -hour collection—or macro albuminuria and abnormal renal function as represented by an abnormality in serum creatinine, calculated creatinine clearance, or glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Clinically, diabetic nephropathy is characterized by a progressive increase in proteinuria and decline in GFR, hypertension, and a high risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Nephropathy means kidney disease or damage. Diabetic nephropathy is damage to your kidneys caused by diabetes. In severe cases it can lead to kidney failure. But not everyone with diabetes has kidney damage. The kidneys have many tiny blood vessels that filter waste from <b>your</b> <b>blood.</b> High <b>blood</b> <b>sugar</b> from diabetes can destroy these blood vessels.

40|$|There are an {{estimated}} 69, 000 adults and 1092 children living with diabetes in Northern Ireland in 2010. The number of adults with diabetes in Northern Ireland has increased by 34 % since 2004. Many of these cases are preventable and related to obesity. With this in mind, during Diabetes Week (12 - 18 June 2011) the Public Health Agency is encouraging everyone across Northern Ireland {{to be aware of}} how diabetes can be prevented and what the signs and symptoms of diabetes are to ensure early diagnosis and good diabetic care. Type 1 diabetes cannot be prevented. It usually occurs in children and young adults. Type 2 diabetes typically occurs after the age of 40, but may occur at a younger age, and can often be prevented - mainly by keeping your weight within the normal range for your height. Dr Brid Farrell, Consultant in Public Health Medicine, PHA, said: "The increase of diabetes occurring in the population can be explained by rising levels of obesity, people living longer and improved detection and diagnosis of diabetes in primary care. "The symptoms of diabetes can include increased thirst, passing urine more frequently (bedwetting in children), extreme tiredness, slow healing infections, blurred vision and significant or unexplained weight loss. Symptoms of diabetes can develop quickly over days or weeks, and sometimes with Type 2 diabetes, a person may have no symptoms. Early diagnosis is important. If you think you have diabetes speak to your GP or pharmacist. Dr Farrell continued: "Diabetes is a lifelong condition, but complications can be prevented or delayed by controlling <b>your</b> <b>blood</b> <b>sugar,</b> and treating high blood pressure and high cholesterol.

40|$|What is diabetes? Diabetes ─ is {{a disease}} that <b>your</b> <b>blood</b> glucose, also called <b>blood</b> <b>sugar,</b> is too high. Your body needs glucose for energy to keep you going. But having too much glucose in the blood can be unhealthy. Glucose comes from foods that contain carbohydrates, and the body can make it from other {{substances}} and stored inside the body. <b>Your</b> <b>blood</b> carries the glucose {{to all of the}} cells in your body. Insulin is a chemical (hormone) made by an organ called the pancreas that lies near the stomach and helps the glucose get into the cells of your body for energy. People with diabetes don’t make enough insulin or the body cells do not respond to insulin, causing glucose to build up in the blood. (See Figure: Diabetes, hyperglycemia (hi-per-gly-see-me-uh) – high blood glucose levels) Why do you need to control <b>your</b> <b>blood</b> glucose level? If <b>your</b> <b>blood</b> glucose stays too high overtime, it can damage blood vessels and cause heart attacks or strokes. Constant high blood glucose can also cause blindness, kidney failure, and loss of toes, feet, or teeth because of poor blood flow and nerve damages.

40|$|In 2011 nearly 73, 000 {{adults in}} Northern Ireland are {{registered}} as having diabetes. Many cases of diabetes are preventable {{and are the}} result of obesity.

The links between type 2 diabetes and obesity are firmly established. Without the intervention of a healthy diet and appropriate exercise, obesity may develop into diabetes over {{a relatively short period of}} time. According to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), worldwide 80 per cent of people with Type 2 diabetes are overweight or obese at the time of diagnosis. If you are overweight, or obese the key step to preventing or delaying the onset of Type 2 diabetes is to lose a small amount of weight by making healthy food choices and being physically active 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week. Diabetes, if left untreated can cause serious long term health complications such as heart disease, kidney damage, eye problems, which can affect vision, and foot problems leading to amputation. Dr Brid Farrell, Consultant in Public Health Medicine, PHA, said: "The increase of diabetes occurring in the population can be explained by rising levels of obesity, people living longer and improved detection and diagnosis of diabetes in primary care.
