He just acts on them with more intensity than we do. He is a character who relies on the animal. And I always believe that the animal instincts are often the worst part of them. All <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> evolve is corrupt yourself sooner or later." ...|$|E

He underwent therapy for his parents' divorce, but called it a [...] "waste of time" [...] explaining that his parents could not [...] "accept the fact that I might have been OK with it. I cried my eyes out and kicked and screamed and said, 'Why?' and all the things <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> find out. A few days later I was fine but I still had to go to therapy." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Walk Away" [...] is a piano-driven waltz ballad. Written {{in the key}} of G major, it is a downtempo song, with a {{moderate}} slow and bluesy tempo of 52 beats per minute. It {{is followed by a}} chord progression of EmC7 in the verses. Aguilera's vocal range on the song span nearly two octaves, from the low-note of C3 to the high-note of G5. In the track, Aguilera uses a [...] "sultry lower range". Lyrically, [...] "Walk Away" [...] is about an abusive relationship, where she uses a [...] "clever" [...] metaphor. At the song's beginning, the lyrics [...] "What do <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> know something's bad for you, and you still can't let go?" [...] are spoken by Aguilera. In the first verse, she sings, [...] "Your love was like candy/ Artificially sweet, I was deceived by your wrapping". The track was described as a non-sense song by Amanda Murray for Sputnikmusic.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the context}} of theistic belief, Stephen Roberts said [...] "I contend we are both atheists, I just believe in one fewer god than <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> <b>When</b> <b>you</b> {{understand}} why you dismiss all the other possible gods, you will understand why I dismiss yours." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ton Lathouwers, Chán-teacher in the Netherlands, in {{relation}} to Zen at War mentions Hisamatsu's impossible question, [...] "What will <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> cannot do anything, when all your best intentions and great endeavour are invested to no avail whatsoever, when {{all you do is}} doomed to fail?", relating it to a statement by Takeo Sato: ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Very. Did {{you give}} her one of the choruses or a bit of Agamemnon, as <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> {{described}} it to me?" [...] asked Rose, keeping sober with difficulty as she recalled that serio-comic scene.|$|R
2500|$|Coping Strategies Index (CSI) – assesses {{household}} behaviours {{and rates}} them {{based on a}} set of varied established behaviours on how households cope with food shortages.

2500|$|One of Zimmer's most durable {{works from}} {{his time in}} the United Kingdom was the theme song for the {{television}} game show Going for Gold, which he composed with Sandy McClelland in 1987. In an interview with the BBC, Zimmer said: [...] "Going for Gold was a lot of fun. It's the sort of stuff <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> don't have a career yet. God, I just felt so lucky because this thing paid my rent for the longest time." ...|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "historical induction" [...] {{argument}} {{concludes that}} since most theistic religions throughout history (e.g. ancient Egyptian religion, ancient Greek religion) and their gods ultimately {{come to be}} regarded as untrue or incorrect, all theistic religions, including contemporary ones, are therefore most likely untrue/incorrect by induction. It is implied as part of Stephen F. Roberts' popular quotation: I contend that we are both atheists. I just believe in one fewer god than <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> <b>When</b> <b>you</b> understand why you dismiss all the other possible gods, you will understand why I dismiss yours.|$|E

2500|$|Qualitative {{psychological}} research emphasizes fieldwork, {{and this}} emphasis {{has been offered}} as a distinguishing mark. Qualitative psychological research is also described as holistic. That is, qualitative researchers believe in studying phenomena in its context rather than concentrating on narrow aspects of the phenomena. This means that they either observe or participate in the phenomena they are studying, e.g. attending a football game to understand the behaviours of fan, and/or they ask open-ended questions about the behaviour of fans at football games. These questions are holistic because {{they are designed to}} understand the context of behaviour—they will usually follow a pattern that replicates the experience, e.g. [...] "What did <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> arrived? Who did you come with? What did you do then?" [...] However, similar methods are used by quantitative researchers.|$|E

6000|$|Mr. Cumberland Vane laughed outright. [...] "What put {{the country}} into such a state?" [...] he asked.
