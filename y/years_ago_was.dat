5|$|Through {{studies of}} the present cloud {{structure}} and geology of the surface, combined {{with the fact that}} the luminosity of the Sun has increased by 25% since around 3.8billion years ago, it is thought that the atmosphere of Venus up to around 4billion <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>was</b> more like that of Earth with liquid water on the surface. The runaway greenhouse effect may have been caused by the evaporation of the surface water and the rise of the levels of greenhouse gases that followed. Venus's atmosphere has therefore received a great deal of attention from those studying climate change on Earth.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Earth, Venus lacks a {{magnetic}} field. Its ionosphere separates the atmosphere {{from outer space}} and the solar wind. This ionised layer excludes the solar magnetic field, giving Venus a distinct magnetic environment. This is considered Venus's induced magnetosphere. Lighter gases, including water vapour, are continuously blown away by the solar wind through the induced magnetotail. It is speculated that the atmosphere of Venus up to around 4billion <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>was</b> more {{like that of the}} Earth with liquid water on the surface. A runaway greenhouse effect may have been caused by the evaporation of the surface water and subsequent rise of the levels of other greenhouse gases.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of the volcanoes' magma has changed significantly with time as they grow over the hotspot and migrate away. Volcanic activity 14.5to 3.0million <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>was</b> predominately felsic, producing large volumes of rhyolite and trachyte lava. This {{can be explained by}} the presence of thick granitic structures under these volcanoes, which have been tectonically compressed from being near the North American Plate margin. A unique characteristic of the felsic lava flows is that although they were high in silica content, the flows were overly fluid in nature. This is because the peralkaline content of these felsic lavas decreased the viscosity of the flows a minimum of 10–30times over that of calc-alkaline felsic flows. Evidence for explosive volcanism exists in the form of pumice flows, bedded tuffs, intensely shattered basement rocks and the high content of coarse basement clasts in rhyolite breccias.|$|E

5|$|Ambulocetus natans, which lived about 49 million <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>was</b> {{discovered}} in Pakistan in 1994. It was probably amphibious, {{and looked like}} a crocodile. In the Eocene, ambulocetids inhabited the bays and estuaries of the Tethys Ocean in northern Pakistan. The fossils of ambulocetids are always found in near-shore shallow marine deposits associated with abundant marine plant fossils and littoral molluscs. Although they are found only in marine deposits, their oxygen isotope values indicate that they consumed water {{with a range of}} degrees of salinity, some specimens showing no evidence of sea water consumption and others none of fresh water consumption at the time when their teeth were fossilized. It is clear that ambulocetids tolerated a wide range of salt concentrations. Their diet probably included land animals that approached water for drinking, or freshwater aquatic organisms that lived in the river. Hence, ambulocetids represent the transition phase of cetacean ancestors between freshwater and marine habitat.|$|E
5|$|Magma {{production}} of the Anahim hotspot has shifted from more felsic to more mafic compositions in the last 3.0million years. For instance, much of the magma created between 3.0and 0.33million <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>was</b> igneous phonolite, trachyte, trachyandesite, basalt and basanite; the volcanoes built during this period are almost entirely made of these rock types. Other igneous rocks such as phonotephrite are present in smaller quantities; these occur in the Satah Mountain volcanic field. Volcanic eruptions in the last 0.33million years have been mainly basanitic and have occurred at the youngest eruptive centre, Nazko Cone. Basanites produced by these eruptions are significantly more undersaturated than basalts from older Anahim volcanoes {{in the west and}} may indicate an eastward shift toward a deeper or less depleted mantle source. It is also possible that as the North American Plate moves over the Anahim hotspot, it underlies thinner continental crust. The overall chemistry and mineralogy of the Anahim magmas are analogous to regions of incipient continental rifting above a mantle plume.|$|E
