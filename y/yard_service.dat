The decision was hence taken to rationalise these to one yard, and in 1957 to the immediate west of Erimus, BR developed the new Tees Marshalling Yard and associated Thornaby TMD. Initially developed as a hump shunting facility, by the time construction was completed in 1963 wagon-shunting had been replaced by Containerisation and Merry-go-round trains, and hence hump shunting ceased.|$|R

The locomotive uses a downsized diesel engine and a 50 kW HELION fuel cell to provide power. The project was financed by the French Government through the Environment and Energy Management Agency and several industrial partners.|$|E

Thus, the engine was likely relegated to <b>yard</b> <b>service</b> as early as the late 1850s, as the railroad had acquired larger, more powerful locomotives such as the General and the Texas.|$|E
