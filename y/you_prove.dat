500|$|Andrew Garfield {{believes}} {{the story of}} Never Let Me Go is about humans, and exploring [...] "what {{it is to have}} a soul, and how <b>you</b> <b>prove</b> what a soul is"; he says he enjoys the way the film is a [...] "call to arms" [...] about the positives of life. He adds that its message could hopefully remind people that they have a choice when they arise in the morning whether to pursue their own choice of activities for the day, or to do what they should do or are obliged to do. Keira Knightley feels that the film's story is alarming, but has said that the film is [...] "more about humanity's ability to look the other way". [...] "You know in fact that if your morals can go out the window if you think you can survive in a certain way, whatever your morals may be".|$|E
500|$|Throughout The Ecstatic, Mos Def alternated {{between what}} AllMusic's Andy Kellman called {{nonsensical}} yet intellectual raps and [...] "seemingly nonchalant, off-the-cuff boasts", set against eccentric, lightly reverbed productions. According to The Guardians Paul MacInnes, The Ecstatic featured his characteristically [...] "fragmented lyrical style, which looped words within phrases and played on sound {{as much as}} meaning". [...] "Auditorium" [...] showcased his [...] "complex and convoluted" [...] lyricism delivered closely in rhythm with the beat, Patrin said, citing the lines [...] "soul is the lion's roar, voice is the siren / I swing 'round, wring out and bring down the tyrant / chop a small axe and knock a giant lopsided". He explored Afrocentric themes on [...] "Revelations" [...] and compared love to a gunfight on [...] "Pistola". On [...] "Roses", Muldrow sang nature-friendly lyrics about drawing flowers in times of sadness rather than plucking them from the ground. [...] "Roses is about creativity and human capacity", she explained. [...] "A lot of times Western society makes [...] base our sense of worth on 'diamonds are forever' or 'a dozen roses' and that's how <b>you</b> <b>prove</b> your love to somebody... but you receive so many gifts and still feel empty. So draw them and let the roses come from inside." ...|$|E

'thunder' involving the idea of noise, as much as 'railing children' do. Consider this--I give it up to you.[76] ...|$|R

2500|$|Evangelical writer Donald Macleod {{suggests}} that the sinless nature of Jesus Christ involves two elements. [...] "First, Christ was free of actual sin." [...] Studying the gospels there is no reference to Jesus praying for the forgiveness of sin, nor confessing sin. The assertion is that Jesus did not commit sin, nor could he be proven guilty of sin; he had no vices. In fact, he is quoted as asking, [...] "Can any of <b>you</b> <b>prove</b> me guilty of sin?" [...] in John 8:46. [...] "Secondly, he was free from inherent sin ("original sin" [...] or [...] "ancestral sin")." ...|$|E
2500|$|A letter, {{written by}} the architect, artist and earlier {{director}} {{of the school of}} arts, Hans Fischli, to Cramer said: “You create a sense of space that I have never experienced before in the open air. <b>You</b> <b>prove</b> that a clever mind combined with the precise use of the trade does not have to apply the same technique for soil as the force of the natural elements do. You do not create an imitation of a natural reality, but you fabricate a work which we abstract painters and sculptors have tried to attain through practical measures for many years.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Dan Tynan, Executive Editor of PC World {{and author}} of Computer Privacy Annoyances (2005), said: [...] "This is {{extremely}} creepy, and way beyond {{the purview of the}} school.... There's really no need to try to take a picture of someone—in fact, how can <b>you</b> <b>prove</b> the person in front of the laptop was the one who stole it?... And to install this stuff on anyone's computer and not notify them about, it is just begging for a world of pain." [...] Robert Richardson, Director of the Computer Security Institute, said: [...] "It's incredible that they didn't realize they were playing with fire." [...] Technology journalist Robert X. Cringely wrote in InfoWorld: [...] Is there any reason why you'd need to take two weeks' worth of photos to locate a missing laptop, especially when you already have other ways of tracking it? I don't think so.... Cafiero issued … the rather interesting statement that the 15-year-old Robbins had [...] "no reasonable expectation of privacy" [...] in his own home, because … his family hadn't paid the $55 insurance fee required by the school for home loaners. [...] In other words: If you don't pay your dues, we can watch you while you sleep. Did I say [...] "creepy" [...] already? ...|$|E

2500|$|The name [...] "Ori" [...] {{comes from}} the word [...] "Origin", as in {{the origin of the}} Ancients. When {{executive}} producer Robert C. Cooper looked at the root of [...] "origin", he retcon-invented the word [...] "Origin" [...] as the name of the Ori religion. Cooper said it was an interesting idea for him to address the philosophical arguments with various religious people, seeing the whole challenge as [...] "how do <b>you</b> <b>prove</b> whose God exists or whether God exists at all?" [...] Instead of the Goa'uld, who were proved quickly to not be gods by killing them and figuring out their technology, {{it would be hard to}} present the same argument to the Ori followers because the Ori were essentially ascended gods. Even if their gods were dead, it would not make much difference for them, as their followers would continue to believe; without the [...] "magic powers" [...] of the Ori, their followers and the Priors (the Ori's missionaries) could still use the technology and their ships. Cooper said that [...] "it's not necessarily wrong to believe in something ... what's wrong is to murder somebody because they don't believe the way you do." [...] Although Cooper was reluctant to get too serious about the meaning behind the Ori as Stargate should [...] "first and foremost [...] entertain people", he considered it representative of television and the media, [...] "mak people believe whatever the people in charge of that magic box [...] whatever they want you to believe they can pretty much convince you, or convince the vast majority of people." [...] For Cooper, [...] "the followers of the Ori were the interesting part", and he [...] "wanted to do a story that was in some way reflective of the differences between people's beliefs that we see around us in our society, and how conflicts arise as a result of that." [...] Cooper was particularly interested in the interaction between Ori followers and other normal human beings, the resulting [...] "mysterious aspect and quality to religious belief and the passion that it invokes." [...] The producers therefore put the Ori in the story background, similar to the way there was very little direct interaction between the actual deities of the religion and mankind in real life.|$|E

60|$|Again, “instead {{of proving}} that ‘this {{prisoner}} has committed an atrocious fraud,’ <b>you</b> <b>prove</b> that the fraud {{he is accused}} of is atrocious; instead of proving (as in the well-known tale of Cyrus and the two coats) that the taller boy had a right to force the other boy to exchange coats with him, <b>you</b> <b>prove</b> that the exchange would have been advantageous to both; instead of proving that the poor ought to be relieved in this way rather than in that, <b>you</b> <b>prove</b> that the poor ought to be relieved; instead of proving that the irrational agent—whether a brute or a madman—can never be deterred from any act by apprehension of punishment (as, for instance, a dog from sheep-biting, by fear of being beaten), <b>you</b> <b>prove</b> that the beating of one dog does not operate as an example to other dogs, etc.|$|E
