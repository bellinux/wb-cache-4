2500|$|In 2001, the Lakers won {{the title}} again; however, O'Neal and Bryant began feuding during the season. O'Neal came into {{training}} camp out of shape, which disappointed Jackson and also Bryant, who worked hard over the offseason {{to improve his}} game. Bryant was leading the league in scoring as 2001 began, and Jackson said Bryant was playing the best ball of his career. O'Neal was shooting below 50 percent during stretches, and his free throw shooting was in the 20 percent range. O'Neal said of the Lakers in January, [...] "When {{it was clear that}} everything went through me, the outcome of it was (a record of) 67–15, playing with enthusiasm, the city jumping up and down and a parade. And now we're 23–11. <b>You</b> <b>figure</b> <b>it</b> out ... I don't know why anybody else would want to change – other than selfish reasons." [...] Bryant responded that it was a different year and the roster had undergone some changes and [...] "things change, things evolve, {{and you just have to}} grow with that change." [...] Lakers assistant coach Bill Bertka said a key factor was the team's defense after losing Fisher for most of the season. O'Neal requested a trade after a blowout win against the Phoenix Suns where Bryant scored 38 and O'Neal scored 18. Jackson commented that their actions were [...] "juvenile" [...] and they should appreciate each other and play as a team. Bryant would be criticized for forcing his offense and not involving his teammates enough. Even O'Neal's stepfather was overheard yelling at Bryant to pass the ball during a game. Bryant told Jackson that the [...] "(triangle) offense is so simple. It doesn't display my talent ... it doesn't give me what I have to have for my game." [...] According to Bryant, the team's defense was the issue and not his increased role in the offense. [...] Bryant said that [...] "scoring shouldn't affect (O'Neal's) defense", while O'Neal maintained that [...] "if the big dog ain't me, then the house won't get guarded – period." [...] Due to O'Neal's sensitivity toward criticism, Jackson overlooked O'Neal's shortcomings while maintaining his criticism of Bryant. West told O'Neal that he also had personal rivalries when he played with all-time greats Wilt Chamberlain and Elgin Baylor, but O'Neal needed to [...] "stop being a baby ... put the team's success first." ...|$|E

6000|$|I {{succumbed to}} your Witchery, that is I read your brave pages, {{the very day}} they swam into my ken--what a pleasure, by the way, to hang over a {{periodical}} page so materially handsome as that of which the Scots members of your great profession [...] "dispose"!--those at least who are worthy. But {{face to face with}} my correspondence, and with my age (a [...] "certain," [...] a very certain, age,) and some of its drawbacks, I am aware of the shrunken nature of my poor old shrunken energies of response in general (once fairly considerable;) and hence in short this little delay. Of a horrible interest and a most ingenious vividness of presentation is all that hideous business in your hands--with the unspeakable King's figure looming through the caldron-smoke he kicks up to more abominable effect than the worst witch images into which he so fondly seeks to convert other people. He was truly a precious case and quite the sort of one that makes us most ask how the time and place concerned with him could at all stagger under him or successfully stomach him. But the whole, the collective, state of mind and tissue of horrors somehow fall outside of our measure and sense and exceed our comprehension. The amenability of the victims, the wonder of what their types and characters would at all [...] "rhyme with" [...] among ourselves today, takes more setting forth than it can easily get--even as <b>you</b> <b>figure</b> <b>it</b> or touch on it; and there are too many things (in the amenability) as to which one vainly asks one's self what they can too miserably have meant. That is the flaw in respect to interest--that the [...] "psychology" [...] of the matter fails for want of more intimate light in the given, in any instance. It doesn't seem enough to say that the wretched people were amenable just to torture, or their torturers just to a hideous sincerity of fear; for the selectability of the former must have rested on some aspects or qualities that elude us, and the question of what could pass for the latter as valid appearances, as verifications of the imputed thing, is too abysmal. And the psychology of the loathsome James (oh the Fortunes of Nigel, which Andrew Lang admired!) is of no use in mere glimpses of his [...] "cruelty," [...] which explains nothing, or unless we get it all and really enter the horrid sphere. However, I don't want to do that in truth, for the wretched aspects of the creature do a disservice somehow to the so interesting and on the whole so sympathetic appearance of his wondrous mother. That she should have had but one issue of her body and that he should have had to be that particular mixture of all the contemptibilities, [...] "bar none," [...] is too odious to swallow. Of course he had a horrid papa--but he has always been retroactively compromising, and my poor point is simply that he is the more so the more one looks at him (as your rich page makes one do). But I insist too much, and all I really wanted to say is: [...] "Do, very generously, send me the sequel to your present study--my appetite has opened to it too; but then go back to the dear old human and sociable murders and adulteries and forgeries in which we are so agreeably at home.
