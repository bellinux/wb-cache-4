KYW-TV cooperates with sister station WCBS-TV {{in the production}} and broadcast of statewide New Jersey political debates. When the two stations broadcast a statewide office debate, such as Governor or U.S. Senate, they will pool resources and have anchors or reporters from both stations participate in the debate. Additionally, the two stations cooperate in the gathering of news in New Jersey where their markets overlap; sharing reporters, live trucks, and helicopters. Like other CBS-owned stations, KYW-TV offers a web-only newscast called CBS 3 At <b>Your</b> <b>Desk,</b> shown daily.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} example shows {{a sequence}} of nested phrases in which each head precedes its complement. In the complementizer phrase (CP) in (a), the complementizer (C) precedes its tense phrase (TP) complement. In the tense phrase in (b), the tense-marking element (T) precedes its verb phrase (VP) complement. (The subject of the tense phrase, the girl, is a specifier, which {{does not need to}} be considered when analyzing the ordering of head and complement.) In the verb phrase in (c), the verb (V) precedes its two complements, namely the determiner phrase (DP) the book and the prepositional phrase (PP) on the table. In (d), where a picture is analyzed as a determiner phrase, the determiner (D) a precedes its noun phrase (NP) complement, while in (e), the preposition (P) on precedes its DP complement <b>your</b> <b>desk.</b>|$|E

As I have not brought up this subject before, I presume that there are a great many, which can be arranged better than they are. Will you all now look into <b>your</b> <b>desks,</b> and see whether you consider them in good order. Stop a moment however. Let me tell you what good order is. All those things which are alike, should be arranged together. Books should be in one place, papers in another, and thus every thing should be classified. Again, every thing should be so placed that it can be taken out without disturbing other things. There is another principle also, which I will mention, the various articles should have constant places,--that is, they should not be changed from day to day. By this means, you soon remember where every thing belongs, and you can put away your things much more easily every night, than if you had every night to arrange them in a new way.

2500|$|During the {{development}} of Brütal Legend, a publishing issue arose. Activision, having acquired {{the rights to the}} title through its merger with Vivendi Games, decided to drop it and forced Schafer to locate another publisher. During this period (around 2007 to 2008), Schafer attempted to boost the company's morale by engaging the team in an [...] "Amnesia Fortnight". For a two-week period, the employees were split into four groups, told to forget their current work on Brütal Legend (hence the [...] "Amnesia"), and tasked to develop a game prototype for review by the other groups. Each of the four ideas were successfully created and praised by the whole company. The four projects produced were Iron Brigade, a project that later became , Tiny Personal Ninja, and Operation <b>Your</b> <b>Desk</b> is Disgusting. The process was repeated later near the end of Brütal Legend, providing an additional four prototypes. Schafer credits the concept of the Amnesia Fortnights to film director Wong Kar-Wai. During the long, three-year filming of Ashes of Time, Wong had taken some of his actors and film crew to Hong Kong to shoot footage for fun, ultimately resulting in the films Chungking Express and Fallen Angels. Schafer noted {{these were some of the}} director's more famous films. Schafer eventually signed a publishing deal with Electronic Arts for Brütal Legend.|$|E
