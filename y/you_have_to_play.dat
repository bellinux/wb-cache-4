500|$|In an {{interview}} published in The Big Issue, journalist Bill Flanagan asked Dylan {{why he had}} performed the songs in a straightforward style, and Dylan responded: [...] "There wasn't {{any other way to}} play it. These songs are part of my life, just like folk songs. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> them straight too." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{signing with}} Fat Wreck Chords, Tintari and White left the band; Tintari was {{replaced}} by Brandon Barnes shortly thereafter. [...] With their new drummer, Rise Against began to work on The Unraveling at Sonic Iguana Studios in Lafayette, Indiana, where Principe and Wleklinski had previously recorded material for 88 Fingers Louie. Recording took place {{over the course of}} five weeks, with Mass Giorgini serving as the producer, and Wleklinski serving as the assistant engineer. Wleklinski later remarked on the grueling workdays: [...] "12-hour days for 4 of those weeks, and then 22-24 hours per day during that last week of tracking. These were the times of 'If you don't play it right, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> it again,' not 'That was good enough, I'll edit it so it's on time.'" [...] Wleklinski also commented that it was difficult to split his time between recording guitar parts and engineering the songs, and that during the last week he had to sleep on the studio floor.|$|E
500|$|With {{their new}} lineup finalized, Rise Against {{began work on}} their debut studio album, The Unraveling. Recording {{sessions}} took place in late 2000, at Sonic Iguana Studios in Lafayette. Wleklinski served as an assistant engineer under producer Mass Giorgini, and later remarked on the grueling workdays: [...] "12-hour days for 4 of those weeks, and then 22-24 hours per day during that last week of tracking. These were the times of 'If you don't play it right, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> it again,' not 'That was good enough, I'll edit it so it's on time." [...] The Unraveling was released on April 24, 2001. Although the album failed to reach any record charts, it did receive positive reviews from critics, who commended the raw and unadulterated music. To promote the album, Rise Against toured extensively throughout North America and Europe. While on tour, Wleklinski left the band due to several complaints from McIlrath. Rumor spread that Wleklinski was fired because of his long hair, although McIlrath derided these claims. Phillip Hill stood in as the lead guitarist while on tour, after which White returned as a replacement.|$|E

500|$|In September 1963, after Cox was {{discharged}} from the Army, he and Hendrix moved to Clarksville, Tennessee, and formed a band called the King Kasuals. Hendrix had watched Butch Snipes play with his teeth in Seattle and by now Alphonso 'Baby Boo' Young, the other guitarist in the band, was performing this guitar gimmick. Not to be upstaged, Hendrix learned to play with his teeth. He later commented: [...] "The idea of doing that came to me...in Tennessee. Down there <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> with your teeth or else you get shot. There's a trail of broken teeth all over the stage." [...] Although they began playing low-paying gigs at obscure venues, the band eventually moved to Nashville's Jefferson Street, which was the traditional heart of the city's black community and home to a thriving rhythm and blues music scene. They earned a brief residency playing at a popular venue in town, the Club del Morocco, {{and for the next}} two years Hendrix made a living performing at a circuit of venues throughout the South that were affiliated with the Theater Owners' Booking Association (TOBA), widely known as the Chitlin' Circuit. In addition to playing in his own band, Hendrix performed as a backing musician for various soul, R, and blues musicians, including Wilson Pickett, Slim Harpo, Sam Cooke, and Jackie Wilson.|$|E

During filming of the scene, it was reported widely among media sources after {{a fan of the}} series had snuck their way onto a nearby mountain and filmed {{a small portion of the}} fighting scenes that occurred. Robert Aramayo (young Eddard Stark) spoke about the filming of the scene in an interview following the airing of the episode and stated, [...] "We all went through a bunch of training, which continued through our three- or four-day shoot in Spain. It was intense. It was not easy. I did not find it easy to shoot that fight sequence. It's not an easy routine at all. And Luke Roberts, who plays Arther Dayne, he's incredible, man." [...] He continued, [...] "If your move's getting blocked, you obviously can't know that, just like when you're playing a scene through dialogue. You can't know the response your scene partner gives you is going to be the response you'll get. You hope it is. Likewise, in a fight, if you're going to chop somebody's arm off or stab them in the gut — the intention is to chop that arm off or stab someone in the gut, and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> that intention fully. I didn't expect it, but it takes a lot of skill in terms of acting to play." ...|$|E

2500|$|Gwynn {{was solid}} on defense, and won five Gold Gloves in a six-year span. He stole 318 bases in his career, {{with a high}} of 56 and a {{four-year}} stretch when he averaged 40. Only four players in MLB history had 300 steals and a career batting average of at least [...]338; Gwynn {{was the only one}} of the four to have played since 1928. He was also just the 10th player to retire with over 3,000 hits and 300 steals. Gwynn in 1999 was the first National League player to reach 3,000 hits since Lou Brock in August 1979. Seven American Leaguers reached the mark after Brock and before Gwynn; all but one played at least 400 games as a designated hitter. An NL player could not be a DH until 1997, when it was allowed for the few interleague games that were played in AL parks. Just six of Gwynn's first 3,000 hits came as a designated hitter. [...] "If you want to do it in the National League, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> a position", he said. [...] "It's been 20 years since anybody has been able to do it. That tells you how tough it is to do it in this league." ...|$|E

2500|$|In Silvestri's {{first meeting}} with Johnston, the latter raised his desire for a central theme. On this, Silvestri said, [...] "To {{have some kind of}} musical {{signature}} either for a character or some aspect of the film, truly holds the score together. A theme makes the music feel like one piece in a sense." [...] For this central theme, a fanfare for Captain America, Silvestri did not look to any past film scores in particular, instead looking to [...] "certain kinds of elements that we have, over time, associated with that kind of heroic statement", such as the percussive elements, intervals, and brass instrumentation of Aaron Copland's [...] "Fanfare for the Common Man". He noted that Captain America is a [...] "very bold and bombastic idea, so you don’t need to inflate that in any way. But that doesn’t mean <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> those elements down either", adding that he felt Captain America was fleshed out more as a character simply by facing [...] "a really bad guy" [...] in the Red Skull in a similar way to Luke Skywalker's development in the presence of Darth Vader. On the Red Skull himself, Silvestri looked to take the character seriously and [...] "play him as bad", but allowed for more compassion for the character when he talks about his tortured past. He also introduced a theme for the Tesseract, Red Skull's energy source.|$|E

This I take to be what is called love with the greater part of us; and I must own, my dear E., it is a hard game such a one as <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> when you meet with such a lover. You cannot refuse but he is sincere, and yet though you use him ever so favourably, perhaps in a few months, or at farthest in a year or two, the same unaccountable fancy may make him as distractedly fond of another, whilst you are quite forgot. I am aware that perhaps the next time I have the pleasure of seeing you, you may bid me take my own lesson home, and tell me that the passion I have professed for you is perhaps one of those transient flashes I have been describing; but I hope, my dear E., you will do me the justice to believe me, when I assure you that the love I have for you is founded on the sacred principles of virtue and honour, and by consequence so long as you continue possessed of those amiable qualities which first inspired my passion for you, so long must I continue to love you. Believe me, my dear, it is love like this alone which can render the marriage state happy. People may talk of flames and raptures as long as they please, and a warm fancy, with a flow of youthful spirits, may make them feel something like what they describe; but sure I am the nobler faculties of the mind with kindred feelings of the heart can only be the foundation of friendship, and it has always been my opinion that the married life was only friendship in a more exalted degree.|$|E

5000|$|Recording was a {{tedious and}} {{time-consuming}} process; as Moog synthesizers are monophonic, meaning only one note {{can be played}} at a time, each track was assembled one at a time. According to Carlos: [...] "You <b>had</b> <b>to</b> release the note before you could make the next note start, which meant <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> with a detached feeling on the keyboard, which was really very disturbing in making music." [...] The instrument was unreliable and often went out of tune; Carlos recalled hitting it with a hammer prior to recording to obtain correct levels. After several notes were played, it was checked once again {{to make sure it}} had not [...] "drifted". Switched-On Bach took, according to Carlos, approximately five months and a total of one thousand hours to produce.|$|R
