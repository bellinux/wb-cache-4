60|$|I don't {{know whether}} you know it, but <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>rent</b> an enchanted house in Mariposa for eight dollars a month, {{and some of the}} most {{completely}} enchanted are the cheapest. As for the enchanted princes, they find them in the strangest places, where you never expected to see them, working--under a spell, you understand,--in drug-stores and printing offices, and even selling things in shops. But {{to be able to find}} them you have first to read ever so many novels about Sir Galahad and the Errant Quest and that sort of thing.|$|E
6000|$|... "If <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>rent</b> another bit of garden, {{anywhere}} near, I {{would take}} it. If not, I would hire {{three or four}} men to collect earth, and bring it up here. This is a good, big place; I suppose it is thirty feet by sixty. Well, I would just leave a path from the door, there, up to this end; and a spare place, here, for your chairs; and I would cover {{the rest of it}} with earth, nine inches or a foot deep; and I would plant vegetables." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Maria," [...] Martin {{announced}} that night, [...] "I'm {{going to leave}} you. And you're going to leave here yourself soon. Then <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>rent</b> the house and be a landlord yourself. You've a brother in San Leandro or Haywards, and he's in the milk business. I want you to send all your washing back unwashed--understand?--unwashed, and {{to go out to}} San Leandro to-morrow, or Haywards, or wherever it is, and see that brother of yours. Tell him to come to see me. I'll be stopping at the Metropole down in Oakland. He'll know a good milk-ranch when he sees one." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You want to buy," [...] said Mr. Mariner {{every time}} he shut a front-door behind them. [...] "Not rent. Buy. Then, if you don't want to live here, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> always <b>rent</b> in the summer." ...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Rent</b> cards: <b>You</b> <b>can</b> collect <b>rent</b> {{of either}} {{one set of}} your {{properties}} from all rivals. For example, if you play a red+yellow <b>rent</b> card, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> either collect the rent of red or yellow properties from all rivals.

6000|$|The general {{size of a}} {{store in}} Tangier is about that of an {{ordinary}} shower bath in a civilized land. The Muhammadan merchant, tinman, shoemaker, or vendor of trifles sits {{cross-legged on the floor}} and reaches after any article you may want to buy. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>rent</b> a whole block of these pigeonholes for fifty dollars a month. The market people crowd the marketplace with their baskets of figs, dates, melons, apricots, etc., and among them file trains of laden asses, not much larger, if any, than a Newfoundland dog. The scene is lively, is picturesque, and smells like a police court. The Jewish money-changers have their dens close at hand, and all day long are counting bronze coins and transferring them from one bushel basket to another. They don't coin much money nowadays, I think. I saw none but what was dated four or five hundred years back, and was badly worn and battered. These coins are not very valuable. Jack went out to get a napoleon changed, so as to have money suited to the general cheapness of things, and came back and said he had [...] "swamped the bank, had bought eleven quarts of coin, {{and the head of the}} firm had gone on the street to negotiate for the balance of the change." [...] I bought nearly half a pint of their money for a shilling myself. I am not proud on account of having so much money, though. I care nothing for wealth.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Your husband's {{case is not}} {{a hopeful}} one, Mrs. Le Breton,' he said solemnly, 'but still, a great deal may be done for him.' Edie's face brightened visibly. 'With care, his life may be {{prolonged}} for many years,--I may even say, indeed, quite indefinitely.' Edie smiled with joy and gratitude. 'But you must strictly observe my rules and directions--the same that I've just given in a similar case to the Crown Prince of Servia who was here before you. In the first place, your husband must give up work altogether. He must be content to live perfectly and absolutely idle. Then, secondly, he must live quite away from England. I should recommend the Engadine in summer, and Algeria or the Nile trip every winter; but, if that's beyond your means--and I understand from Mr. Le Breton that you're in somewhat straitened circumstances--I don't object to Catania, or Malaga, or even Mentone and the Riviera. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>rent</b> furnished villas for very little on the Riviera. But he must in no case come farther north, even in summer, than the Lake of Geneva. That, I assure you, is quite indispensable, if he wishes to live another twelvemonth. Take him south at once, in a coupé-lit of course, and break the journey once or twice at Lyons and Marseilles. Next, as to diet, he must live generously--very generously. Don't let him drink claret; claret's poor sour stuff; a pint of good champagne daily, or a good, full-bodied, genial vintage Burgundy would be far better and more digestible for him. Oysters, game, sweetbreads, red mullet, any little delicacy of that sort as much as possible. Don't let him walk; let him have carriage exercise daily; you can hire carriages for a mere trifle monthly at Cannes and Mentone. Above all things, give him perfect freedom from anxiety. Allow him to concentrate his whole attention on the act of getting well, and you'll find he'll improve astonishingly in no time. But if you keep him here in England and feed him badly and neglect my directions, I can't answer for his getting through another winter....Don't disturb yourself, I beg of you; don't, pray, give way to tears; {{there is really no}} occasion for it, my dear madam, no occasion for it at all, if you'll only do as I tell you....Quite right, thank you. Good morning.--Next case, McFarlane.--Good morning. Good morning.' ...|$|E
