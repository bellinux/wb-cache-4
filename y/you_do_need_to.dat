60|$|Polyphemus had {{an eye for}} business; it was in {{the middle}} of his forehead. It served him admirably for the only two duties which are demanded in a modern {{financier}} and captain of industry: the two duties of counting sheep and of eating men. But when that one eye was put out he was done for. But the Scotch are not one-eyed practical men, though their best friends must admit that they are occasionally business-like. They are, quite fundamentally, romantic and sentimental, and this is proved by the very economic argument that is used to prove their harshness and hunger for the material. The mass of Scots have accepted the industrial civilisation, with its factory chimneys and its famine prices, with its steam and smoke and steel&mdash;and strikes. The mass of the Irish have not accepted it. The mass of the Irish have clung to agriculture with claws of iron; and have succeeded in keeping it. That is because the Irish, though far inferior to the Scotch in art and literature, are hugely superior to them in practical politics. <b>You</b> <b>do</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be very romantic to accept the industrial civilisation. It does really require all the old Gaelic glamour to make men think that Glasgow is a grand place. Yet the miracle is achieved; and while I was in Glasgow I shared the illusion. I have never had the faintest illusion about Leeds or Birmingham. The industrial dream suited the Scots. Here was a really romantic vista, suited to a romantic people; a vision of higher and higher chimneys taking hold upon the heavens, of fiercer and fiercer fires in which adamant could evaporate like dew. Here were taller and taller engines that began already to shriek and gesticulate like giants. Here were thunderbolts of communication which already flashed to and fro like thoughts. It was unreasonable to expect the rapt, dreamy, romantic Scot to stand still in such a whirl of wizardry to ask whether he, the ordinary Scot, would be any the richer.|$|E

40|$|If {{you are in}} {{financial}} trouble and {{are not able to}} work a repayment plan with your creditors on your own, a credit counseling service may be able to help. The most common of these services are members of the National Foundation for Credit Counseling (NFCC) with 155 members and 1, 425 offices known as Consumer Credit Counseling Services (CCCS). There are about 47 credit counseling services (or “adjustment services companies ” as they are technically called) licensed to offer services in Wisconsin. This includes agencies with local offices as well as phone and Internetbased services. What they offer. Credit counseling services provide individual budget counseling and assistance in arranging a payment plan with creditors, usually called a debt management plan (DMP). This is a monthly program that often reduces your bills and consolidates them into one monthly payment. When you sign up for the debt management plan, you deposit money each month with the credit counseling service and they pay your creditors according to a payment schedule developed by the counselor. A successful repayment plan requires you to make regular, timely payments, and could take as long as 48 months or longer to complete. As part of the repayment plan, you may have to agree not to apply for or use any additional credit while you're participating in the program. Most credit counselors will ask you to surrender or cut up your credit cards. Cost. The costs are often based on a sliding scale, based on your ability to pay. Typical fees include a start-up fee plus a monthly fee for each month you are in the debt management plan. Wisconsin laws limit the initial budget setup fee to $ 50 or $ 25 for clients that sign up for a debt management plan. However monthly fees vary, so <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> check costs before signing any agreement. Some companies charge a flat monthly fee; others base their monthly fee on the number of accounts in your repayment plan. In Wisconsin the maximum monthly fee cannot exceed 10 % of the money sent to creditors or $ 120, whichever is less. Most credit counseling services are funded, in part, by contributions from creditors, particularly credit card companies. The credit card companies agree to pay a fee to the counseling service equal to a percentage of the payments sent them each month. In the industry, this kickback is known as “Fair Share Contribution ” and is limited to 15 percent in Wisconsin...|$|E

40|$|In 1990 a {{research}} team began tracking {{a group of}} babies born in two inner suburbs of Melbourne. Their latest results paint a complex picture, writes Melissa Sweet for APO and Inside Story• JENNIFER sits poised {{on the edge of}} a large leather armchair, one of several plush lounges decorating the expansive lobby of the high-rise building where she works in Melbourne’s CBD. She is composed and smartly dressed. If she’s nervous about sharing the intimate details of her life with a stranger, she shows no sign of it. She speaks quietly and surely while describing the ups and downs that have shaped her first twenty-one years, and her ambitions to move up the ladder at the call centre where she has worked for the past three years. Eventually, she hopes to establish an IT business with her boyfriend. “If you see your parents working hard and struggling when you’re growing up, it helps you realise that <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> work hard to support yourself,” Jennifer says. “That’s why I’m the way I am. I’ve been financially independent since I was fifteen and I started working. I’ve never asked my parents for money since then. A lot of my friends don’t understand that I’ve always wanted to work and support myself. ”Some young people might have been derailed by the events that life has already thrown Jennifer’s way — her father’s bankruptcy when she was a young girl, the subsequent separation of her parents, and the tough times her mother had bringing up five children. But Jennifer sees her early experiences in a largely positive light, recognising that they contributed to her independence and maturity. She stresses that many contemporaries have known worse, and mentions the Life Chances Study, {{a research}} project tracking the experiences of children born in inner Melbourne during a six-month period in 1990. The study began with the mothers of 167 babies, and the most recent findings — released today by the Brotherhood of St Laurence — paint a rich and complex portrait of the study’s “babies” at age twenty-one. The findings may not be representative of wider Australia — the subjects were sourced from two suburbs that are unusual in having high concentrations of both low- and high-income earners —but they provide a fascinating study in contrasts. They illuminate the differences, and some similarities, between those whose parents are refugees, unskilled workers, or unemployed, and those whose parents are doctors, academics and other well-to-do professionals. Tim Gilley, who helped establish the study but now works in education research and teaching at Melbourne University, says the contrast between the study’s subjects is what makes the findings so powerful. “It raises the question, if something is good for these [wealthy] children, why isn’t it available for all children?”While many families have been on the move over the years — only one-fifth still live in the suburbs where the study began — there has been less social and economic mobility. About half are in the same income bracket as they were at the start of the study, 37 per cent have improved their position, and 14 per cent are now worse off financially. One reason Jennifer has been such an avid reader of the study’s findings is that they record something of her own family’s history. She began to take an interest from when she was about twelve, and says its reports have made her conscious of the positives in her life. “They showed us what other people had been through. Some people have lost their parents, some are homeless,” she says. “That made me appreciate the fact that I do have a family and a house; that even though we don’t have the money, we still do have some things. ”Jennifer acknowledges, however, that responsibility to family can have a downside. She and her siblings help support their mother financially, and “it does feel like a burden sometimes,” she says. “I do think, ‘We’re the children, she should be taking care of us,’ but we have all found our own jobs, so we’re supposed to give something back to her. ”It’s impossible not to be impressed by Jennifer, especially for those of us who don’t find anyone nearly so thoughtful or mature when we look back to ourselves at her age. But is she typical of twenty-one-year-old Australians? A clear message from the study is that searching for stereotypes about young people is foolish. Their lives are diverse, and not always predictable from their early circumstances. The 123 young people (out of the original group of 167) whose experiences help inform the latest Life Chances report don’t even agree on whether, at age twenty-one, they are grown up. Only 38 per cent said they would describe themselves as adults; 13 per cent said they were not yet adults and 49 per cent answered “yes and no. ”Tellingly, there are marked differences according to their backgrounds. Those from well-to-do families are far less likely to consider themselves as adults, compared with those from lower- and middle-income families. They are also far more likely to be living at home. Eighty per cent of those from well-to-do families receive financial help from their parents, compared with 20 per cent of those from low-income families. Those from families in which English was not the first language are also far less likely to receive financial help from their parents. While most twenty-one-year-olds are studying or working, some already show the mark of poor health. Fourteen per cent said they had long-term health problems or disability (anxiety and depression being the most common conditions mentioned), with almost one in five saying they had experienced mental health problems during the year they turned twenty-one. •••THE study’s reports make it clear that the individual stories — like the factory worker whose job loss sent his family into a downwards spiral and the young people who struggle with part-time, insecure jobs — are also shaped by wider narratives such as changes in the economy and labour market. While the study report describes how “structural inequalities of income, ethnicity and gender” influence young people’s experiences, most of its subjects are quite positive about their early lives, often seeing good in what might be judged as hard times. By age eighteen, a quarter of children from low-income families had left school early, but none from high-income families had done so. As a previous report from the BSL puts it, “the education system in many ways serves to maintain social divisions across the generations” — an observation that is particularly pertinent given recent state government education funding cuts. According to Michael Horn, a senior manager in the BSL’s research and policy centre, one of the study’s important messages is the need for Gonski-style reforms to direct more resources towards the most needy children, particularly those from the 5 per cent of families experiencing multiple layers of disadvantage.   “You also need to target, ideally in an early intervention way, those students experiencing disadvantage beyond the school gate. We need to do more to prevent that group of kids who struggle from dropping out of school. ”Alan Hayes, director of the Australian Institute of Family Studies, has taken a close interest in the Life Chances findings over the years — not least because he also has a child born in 1990. “What gives me heart out of the Life Chances study is that some of the children who looked most compromised have remarkable capacities to recover, and part of that resilience comes from those around them and the opportunities they are given,” he says. “Today we can be a bit precious about the capacity of children to adapt and recover. ”•••JANET TAYLOR, a researcher on the project since its conception, says that twenty-one is an age of both anxiety and anticipation, citing one man who spoke of the “quarter-life crisis” but also saw the twenties as “the golden years. ” Taylor says many young people worry about studies and job opportunities, and that their lives are completely different from when she was their age. “When I went to uni, there was definitely a job at the end, or at the end of school,” she says. The years do not seem to have dimmed Taylor’s passion for her work; when we meet one morning in a cafe near her office in Fitzroy, her gestures are intense and her eyes alight as she describes the families whose stories she has come to know so well, and what might help improve their lives. She says that there needs to be a rethinking of policies built on the assumption that young people follow a linear transition from school to higher education or training to employment. These days, for many, the journey is more one of stops, starts and backward steps. While Taylor is delighted by the resilience of some of the young people, she worries about others, including those young men who left school early with learning and/or behaviour problems and possible mental health issues, don’t seem to have found a niche in life, and have not been engaged in any meaningful way by support services. “The government’s ‘earn or learn’ policy does not seem to usefully reach these young men,” she says. “I also have concerns about the isolation of a couple of the young mothers in public housing who don’t feel they have friends. And while here I am talking about a few individuals, we know that there will be a much larger number of young people in the wider community facing similar issues. ” Taylor nominates housing and the need for youth-friendly mental health services as two other critical areas requiring more policy attention. Any number of reports and inquiries have shown the impact of disadvantage on health and wellbeing. What Life Chances adds to statistics like these is the power of storytelling, says Taylor. She and her colleague Malita Allan hope the study will focus more attention on the often-untold stories of those experiencing hardship. Says Allan: “I do think the story of these kids growing up, missing out on school excursions, textbooks etc, just goes unnoticed. ” Taylor agrees. “By trying to tell some of the young people’s stories and the families’ stories from their perspective,” she says, “we hope to give people in our wider society more understanding of what some members of the society are going through. ”•••WHEN the latest Life Chances survey arrived at Lucienne’s family home, her mother wasn’t keen to continue sharing the family’s details. But Lucienne insisted she complete the form. “I was like, ‘You have to do it,’” she says. “It’s extremely important because I’m studying psychology and I really believe in the benefits of longitudinal studies. ”Lucienne, who is thoughtful and articulate, has had plenty of life chances — both parents are professionals and she enjoys good relationships with them and her younger sister. Her parents have been very supportive, helping her financially when she moved out of home and taking the family on many overseas trips. Only after we’ve been talking for some time does it emerge that there was a time she hated school so much that she wanted to drop out. She was bullied and felt excluded, both at primary and at high school. “I didn’t fit in,” she says. “I was kind of a ratty kid. I wanted to be a writer and a musician and didn’t want to waste any more time studying. ”Her attitude changed towards the end of Year 8, when she started going out with a boy who was academically inclined. “I needed to impress this guy so I decided I wanted to take school a bit more seriously,” she says. “I don’t even know if I would have graduated if I hadn’t have met him. ” Eight years later, the pair are saving so they can travel overseas when uni is finished. Looking back, Lucienne feels her difficult times at school led to her interest in psychology and, if she could go back in time, she would reassure her fifteen-year-old self that “life gets better. ” “I think I wanted to be the school counsellor,” she says, “and sit in that room and talk to me and say it’s going to be better when you get to uni. ”Back in the high-rise lobby, Jennifer’s childhood experiences seem worlds away from Lucienne’s. But she also had to deal with tough times at school — suffering exclusion because of her Chinese appearance. “It definitely made me feel left out,” she says. It was a relief to leave school and find less discrimination in the workplace. While Jennifer stresses that she doesn’t let racism bother her, it clearly has had an impact. “Even though people try to overlook it and say Australia is multicultural, in truth there are a lot of racist people and it’s hard, it’s really hard,” she says. “I’ve grown up here my whole life… Some people treat me very poorly because they don’t think I belong here. ” When I ask her what she would like to see flow from the study, Jennifer says a greater acceptance and understanding of diversity, and a “society that helps everyone. ”What Jennifer has learnt in her first twenty-one years is, to some extent, what the researchers have learnt from the study at this landmark stage in its history. “It’s about, what sort of society do we want to live in?” says Janet Taylor. “As a society, how can we give all our kids every opportunity?” •Melissa Sweet is a health journalist and editor of the health policy blog Croakey.
