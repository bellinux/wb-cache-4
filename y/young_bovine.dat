40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to re-evaluate the {{analytical}} results and time trends of the content of cadmium in muscle, liver, and kidney samples of <b>young</b> <b>bovine</b> animals and cows slaughtered in the Czech Republic during the years 1993 – 2010, and to estimate the total dietary exposure for the entire population aged 4 – 90 years and specifically, for children at the age of four to six years. Analyses showed that the arithmetic means of cadmium concentration in cow kidney and liver are higher than in <b>young</b> <b>bovine</b> (P < 0. 0001), but not in muscle (P = 0. 227). The mean cadmium concentration in cow kidney (0. 595 mg·kg- 1) was twice as high as in <b>young</b> <b>bovine</b> kidney (0. 285 mg·kg- 1) for the entire studied period. The mean concentration of cadmium in cow liver (0. 113 mg·kg- 1) was higher compared to <b>young</b> <b>bovine</b> liver (0. 078 mg·kg- 1). The mean concentration of cadmium in cow muscle (0. 008 mg·kg- 1) was comparable with <b>young</b> <b>bovine</b> muscle (0. 006 mg·kg- 1). The evaluation of time trends showed increasing concentrations of cadmium for cow (increasing slaughtering age) and <b>young</b> <b>bovine</b> kidney and decreasing concentrations for cow and <b>young</b> <b>bovine</b> muscle, but no significant change for liver.

40|$|Objective: Dexamethasone (Dex) is a {{synthetic}} glucocorticoid that has pro-anabolic and anticatabolic effects in {{cartilage tissue engineering}} systems, though the mechanisms by which these effects are mediated are not well understood. We tested {{the hypothesis that the}} addition of Dex to chondrogenic medium would affect matrix production and aggrecanase activity of human and bovine bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) cultured in self-assembling peptide and agarose hydrogels. Design: We cultured <b>young</b> <b>bovine</b> and adult human BMSCs in (RADA) [subscript 4] self-assembling peptide and agarose hydrogels in medium containing TGF-β 1 ±Dex and analyzed extracellular matrix composition, aggrecan cleavage products, and the effects of the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU- 486 on proteoglycan content, synthesis, and catabolic processing. Results: Dex improved proteoglycan synthesis and retention in agarose hydrogels seeded with <b>young</b> <b>bovine</b> cells but decreased proteoglycan accumulation in peptide scaffolds. These effects were mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor. Adult human BMSCs showed minimal matrix accumulation in agarose, but accumulated ~ 50 % as much proteoglycan and collagen as <b>young</b> <b>bovine</b> BMSCs in peptide hydrogels. Dex reduced aggrecanase activity in (RADA) [subscript 4] and agarose hydrogels, as measured by anti-NITEGE Western blotting, for both bovine and human BMSC-seeded gels. Conclusions: The effects of Dex on matrix production are dependent on cell source and hydrogel identity. This is the first report of Dex reducing aggrecanase activity in a tissue engineering culture system. National Science Foundation (U. S.).

40|$|The {{presence}} of antibodies against BHV- 1 was evaluated in <b>young</b> <b>bovines</b> from fifteen different counties distributed along North, South and Central {{regions of the}} state of Bahia. Bovines with age ranged from 1 to 4 years old, non-vaccinated against BHV- 1 and without diagnostic of BHV- 1 infection were chosen for blood collection. A total of 558 serum samples were collected equivalent to 10 % of the population in each farm. The sera were submitted to ELISA (HerdCheck-IDDEX) and Microserum neutralization (MSN) tests. The MSN was performed in monolayers of MDBK cells in microplates using Los Angeles BHV- 1 strain. The results of serum samples by ELISA showed that 56 % (314 / 558) were positive and 44 % (244 / 558) were negative. The sera assayed by MSN showed that 48 % (269 / 558) were negative and 52 % (289 / 558) were positive. These positive sera demonstrated that 54 % had serumneutralization titer between 4 - 16, 35 % between 32 - 64 and 11 %  64. Our results suggest that the virus is circulating actively in herds.

40|$|PURPOSE: Fixation of {{soft tissue}} grafts with {{interference}} screws {{relies on the}} friction of the graft between the screw and the bone tunnel. The goal {{of this study was}} to precondition such grafts by mechanical compression in order to reduce anticipated and undesired viscoelastic adaptation of the graft to screw pressure. Further, the otherwise slippery graft surface was modified with impressed tricalcium phosphate granules (TCP) to improve friction and mechanical hold. METHODS: Fresh flexor digitorum tendons from <b>young</b> <b>bovines</b> were used to create bundles with a diameter of 8 - 9 mm and were divided into 10 groups to compare the pullout strength and bone damage in a variety of construct scenarios. Specifically, the effects of graft precompression to reduce preimplantation graft diameter were investigated. Further the effects of impressing TCP granules and/or a screw thread into the tendon surface during the compression process were studied.

Untreated unground un-pumiced, unground pumiced, and ground enamel surfaces, as well as synthetic hydroxyapatite surfaces, served as controls for intra-tooth evaluations {{of the effects of}} different treatments. The analyses indicated that exposure to 35 % H 202 alone, besides increasing the nitrogen content, produced no other significant change in the elemental composition of any of the enamel surfaces investigated. Exposure to 37 % H 3 PO 4, however, produced a marked decrease in calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) concentrations and an increase in carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) concentrations in unground un-pumiced specimens only, and a decrease in C concentration in ground specimens. These results suggest that the reported decrease in the adhesive bond strength of resin to 35 % H 202 -treated enamel is not caused by a change in the elemental composition of treated enamel surfaces. They also suggest that an organic-rich layer, unaffected by acid-etching, may be present on the unground u-n-pumiced surface of <b>young</b> <b>bovine</b> incisors. This layer can be removed by thorough pumicing or by grinding.

40|$|Aging is characterized, {{among other}} features, by an {{increased}} concentration of metal ions {{in the brain}} that may contribute to a greater increase in free radicals production. The present paper reports data regarding the concentration of some relevant metal ions (Cu, Fe, Mn, Zn), {{as well as the}} immunopositivity of metallothionein-I-II and GFAP in the bovine pineal gland with respect to animal aging. The pineal gland of <b>young</b> <b>bovines</b> displays several immunoreactive metallothionein-I-II positive elements in the parenchyma, whose number decreases with age. We also report that a well defined group of neurons bordering the third ventricle and located close to the subcommissural organ shows an intense metallothionein-I-II immunopositivity. The presence of metallothionein-I-II was confirmed by means of liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. In particular, it proved possible to identify the amino acid sequences of the unique tryptic peptide not containing cysteine and two pepsin fragments containing cysteines. In conclusion, our data suggest the presence of a metallothionein-I-II expressing system in the pineal gland and ventricle-adjacent areas of the bovine epithalamus might possibly be related to the anti-aging effects of melatonin...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDiverse {{concepts}} for BVD eradication {{or control}} {{have been applied}} in several countries with varying success. Results of previous studies conducted in Switzerland {{have shown that the}} prevalence of antibody-positive animals is high and that BVDV is wide spread in the country causing serious economic losses. A new approach to eradicate BVD in the cattle population in Switzerland was chosen.

Identified persistently infected (PI) animals have to be slaughtered, and new herd infections should be avoided by movement restrictions. Ear-notches are collected using special tags for labeling the animals, and are analyzed using ELISA or rtRT-PCR Methods. Confirmatory tests if needed are performed on blood samples using rtRT-PCR.

40|$|Post {{traumatic}} osteoarthritis (PTOA) {{refers to}} the progressive degradation of cartilage often triggered by a traumatic joint injury, such as a tear of the meniscus or anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). Such impact injuries lead to elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines in the synovial fluid of the joint, including IL- 1, IL- 6, and TNFa. In turn, these cytokines cause decreased matrix synthesis by chondrocytes and contribute to reprogramming of chondrocytes and synovial cells to increase release of matrix proteases. PTOA accounts for 12 % of the OA population and typically affects younger individuals. The {{first part of this}} thesis focuses on developing a combination therapeutic which can address multiple aspects of cartilage degradation associated with the pathogenic responses to joint injury. We studied the combined use of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF- 1) and dexamethasone (Dex) to block multiple degradative effects of cytokine challenge to articular cartilage. We found that in <b>young</b> <b>bovine</b> cartilage, the combination of IGF- 1 and Dex significantly inhibited the loss of sulfated glycosaminoglycans (sGAG) and collagen induced by IL-I. rescued the suppressed matrix biosynthesis, and inhibited the loss of chondrocyte viability caused by iL- 1 treatment. In adult human cartilage, only IGF- 1 rescued matrix biosynthesis and only Dex inhibited sGAG loss and improved cell viability. Thus, the combination of IGF- 1 +Dex together showed combined beneficial effects in human cartilage. Our findings suggest that the combination of IGF-I and Dex has greater beneficial effects than either molecule alone in preventing cytokine-mediated cartilage degradation in adult human and <b>young</b> <b>bovine</b> cartilage. In the second part of this thesis, a global phosphoproteomics approach was employed to determine the pathways that are activated upon cytokine challenge of adult human chondrocytes. We identified key regulatory kinases, p 38, JNKI/ 2, ERKI/ 2, ERK 5, JAK 2, and STAT 3 that were upregulated in phosphorylation as a result of inflammatory cytokine treatment. In addition, we identified 417 phosphopeptides with MAPK substrate motif that were more than 4 times upregulated in response to cytokine treatment. Using inhibitors against the key kinases, it was shown that P 38, JNK 1 / 2, ERK 5 played important roles in cytokine induced cell death in bovine and human cartilage, while inhibition of JNK 1 / 2 and ERK 5 had the anti-catabolic effect of reducing GAG loss from cartilage matrix. In addition, JNK inhibition sensitized chondrocytes to IGF- 1 stimulation in <b>young</b> <b>bovine</b> cartilage. These result indicate that kinase activity plays an essential role in cytokine induced cartilage catabolism and that kinase inhibitors have therapeutic potential in preventing cartilage degeneration. The third and final part of this work examined the release of matrix molecules upon mechanical injurious compression and/or cytokine treatment in long term culture to identify potential biomarkers of cartilage degeneration. A quantitative mass spectrometry approach was used to characterize the kinetics of aggrecan and collagen degradation. Although mechanical injury alone does not lead to a substantial increase in matrix degradation, mechanical injury can accelerate cytokine-induced matrix degradation and release. Additionally, we found that a collagen type III neo-epitope could be a potential biomarker for cartilage degradation. A neoepitope of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), which was identified in the synovial fluid of acute injury patients, was also found in our ex vivo explant injury model. This makes our model physiologically relevant and it can be a valuable system for determining the effects of potential drug treatment on matrix degradation. by Yang Wang. Thesis: Ph.

Cartilage explants were subjected to either static or cyclic (2 s on/ 2 s off) loading in unconfined compression at a stress of 1 MPa for 24 h, or no load. Metabolic activity was assessed by adding medium containing 35 S-sulphate and 3 H-leucine during the last 4 h of loading and measuring the incorporated radioisotope. Matrix composition was {{measured in terms of}} the amounts of collagen, sulphated glycosaminoglycans (GAG) and water content. ResultsLoading of elderly human articular cartilage at 1 MPa significantly inhibited incorporation of 35 S-sulphate (P= 0. 023) into cartilage explants. Pairwise comparisons showed that the difference in incorporation was only for static loading (43 % decrease compared to unloaded) (P superior>posterior.

40|$|Studies {{were carried}} out in South America to assess the effect of maternally derived {{antibody}} (MDA) on the responsiveness of calves to FMD vaccination. It was found that calves with MDA did not merely fail to respond to vaccination, but that their serum titres were depressed. This depression was proportional {{to the level of}} pre-existing MDA at the time of vaccination and following primary vaccination it persisted for a least 60 days. High MDA titres interfered with both primary and secondary responses. Animals with relatively low MDA titres were able to respond to vaccination, or at least to be sensitized so that on revaccination they showed a satisfactory response. The half-life of MDA was shown to be approximately 22 days, suggesting that under field conditions significant MDA titres are likely to persist for 4 - 5 months. A trial carried out in Brazil in which the primary course of two inoculations, 4 weeks apart, was initiated when the calves were 5 - 6 months of age, resulted in the reduction of FMD in the calf population from 11 % to 0. 9 % over a 12 -month period.

Fecal samples of 205 newborn calves with diarrhea were studied and used for comparing the efficiency of two microscopic staining methods for diagnosis of the parasite, the auramine (AU) and a modified Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) procedure. Out of the 205 fecal samples, we detected oocysts in 115 (56. 1 %) with AU and 102 (49. 8 %) with ZN. Comparison of results obtained with the two microscopic techniques showed significant difference (p < 0. 05), AU being more sensitive. On the other hand, concordance between the two methods was almost perfect (kappa value of 0. 83). The results with these two operator dependent methods were confirmed using an operator independent immunochromatographic (IC) method. The IC method also enabled us to determine the identity of the parasite species as that of Cryptosporidium parvum. Identification of the parasite species was further corroborated by performing a Cryptosporidium species-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test on few samples taken at random. Overall, the results showed a high number of infected animals suggesting the parasite C. parvum as a major parasitic disease agent of neonatal calves with diarrhea in dairy farms of the Metropolitan Region (Santiago) of Chile.

Using a spherical probe tip (R ~ 12. 5 mm), the magnitude of the dynamic complex indentation modulus, jE*j, and phase angle, 4, between the force and tip displacement sinusoids, were measured in the frequency range f ~ 0. 2 – 130 Hz at an offset indentation depth of d 0 ~ 3 mm. The experimentally measured jE*j and 4 corresponded well with that predicted by a fibril-reinforced poroelastic model over a three-decade frequency range. The peak frequency of phase angle, fpeak, was observed to scale linearly with the inverse square of the contact distance between probe tip and cartilage, 1 /d 2, as predicted by linear poroelasticity theory. The dynamic mechanical properties were observed to be independent of the deformation amplitude in the range d 7 – 50 nm. Hence, these results suggest that poroelasticity was the dominant mechanism underlying the frequency-dependent mechanical behavior observed at these nanoscale deformations.

MS were isolated post mortem from young (20 – 30 years, young human melanosomes [YHMs]) and old (60 – 90 years, old human melanosomes [OHMs]) human eyes and from <b>young</b> <b>bovine</b> eyes (bovine melanosomes [BMs]). Confluent cultured ARPE- 19 cells were fed equivalent numbers of OHMs or BMs and accumulated similar amounts of melanin as determined by electron paramagnetic resonance assay. Cells with and without MS were either maintained in the dark or exposed to blue light for up to 96 h and assessed for alterations in cell morphology, cell viability and lysosomal integrity. Incubation of cells in dark in the presence of internalized MS or irradiation of cells with blue light in the absence or presence of BMs did not significantly affect cell viability. However, exposures to blue light in the presence of OHMs resulted in abnormal cell morphology, up to ∼ 75 % decrease in mitochondrial activity, loss of lysosomal pH and cell death. OHMs contained significantly less melanin than YHMs, supporting the hypothesis that melanin undergoes degradation during RPE aging. Our results demonstrate that aged MS can be phototoxic to human RPE cells and support a contributing role of MS in RPE aging and in the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration...|$|E
40|$|SummaryObjectiveThe {{heterogeneity}} of biosynthesis in human-derived cartilage explants poses {{a challenge to}} its use in experiments. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the consistency with which two consecutive measures of biosynthesis could be made in individual human articular cartilage explants using a dual proline radiolabeling protocol. MethodsFull-thickness cartilage explants were harvested from <b>young</b> <b>bovine</b> or human (total knee replacement) tibial plateaus. Two consecutive measurements of biosynthesis were obtained by measuring 3 H-proline and 14 C-proline incorporation. Each sample's ratio of 14 C-/ 3 H-proline incorporation was computed. For comparison to traditional experimental designs, the 14 C-proline incorporation ratio was computed for adjacent cartilage samples. The number of samples needed to observe a change in the proline incorporation ratio of 10, 20, and 50 % was determined for both methods. ResultsThe dual-label ratio was consistent across samples from the same plateau [95 % confidence interval (CI) : ± 20 % (human) and ± 30 % (bovine) of median]. Adjacent human sample pairs had much greater variability in their 14 C-proline incorporation (95 % CI: ± 50 % of median). Adjacent bovine sample pairs had CIs that were similar in magnitude to those for the dual-label approach. In the human plateaus, ratio changes of 10, 20 and 50 % could be detected using dramatically fewer samples than the adjacent pair method. For bovine samples, the two methods required a similar number of samples per group. ConclusionThe consistency of the dual-label approach may overcome the difficulties in studying the effects of interventions on biosynthesis in human cartilage in vitro...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study we {{examined}} cartilage matrix repair following IL- 1 -induced matrix depletion. Previous data indicated that, in some cases, chondrocytes can synthesize macromolecules to establish a functional extracellular matrix {{in response to a}} matrix-damaging insult or when placed in a three-dimensional environment with inadequate matrix. However, the conditions under which such 'repair' can occur are not entirely clear. Prior studies have shown that chondrocytes in trypsin-depleted <b>young</b> <b>bovine</b> articular cartilage can replenish tissue glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and that the rate of replenishment is relatively uniform throughout the tissue, suggesting that all chondrocytes have similar capacity for repair. In {{the present study}} we used the characteristic heterogeneous distribution of matrix depletion in response to IL- 1 exposure in order to investigate whether the severity of depletion influenced the rate of GAG replenishment. We used the delayed Gadolinium-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Cartilage (dGEMRIC) method to monitor the spatial and temporal evolution of tissue GAG concentration ([GAG]). For both mild (n= 4) and moderate (n= 10) IL- 1 -induced GAG depletion, we observed partial recovery of GAG (80 % and 50 % of baseline values, respectively) over a 3 -week recovery period. During the first 2 weeks of recovery, [GAG] increased homogeneously at 10 – 15 mg/ml per week. However, during the third week the regions most severely depleted following IL- 1 exposure showed negligible [GAG] accumulation, whereas those regions affected the least by IL- 1 demonstrated the greatest accumulation. This finding could suggest that the most severely degraded regions do not recover fully, possibly because of more severe collagen damage; this possibility requires further examination...|$|E
40|$|Diverse {{concepts}} for BVD eradication {{or control}} {{have been applied}} in several countries with varying success. Results of previous studies conducted in Switzerland {{have shown that the}} prevalence of antibody-positive animals is high and that BVDV is widespread in the country causing serious economic losses. A new approach to eradicate BVD in the cattle population in Switzerland was chosen. It consists in testing the whole Swiss cattle population for virus detection {{in a short period of}} time, without initial antibody screening. Identified persistently infected (PI) animals have to be slaughtered, and new herd infections should be avoided by movement restrictions. Ear-notches are collected using special tags for labeling the animals, and are analyzed using ELISA or rtRT-PCR methods. Confirmatory tests if needed are performed on blood samples using rtRT-PCR. The eradication program is divided into four phases: (1) Pre-pasturing phase: all <b>young</b> <b>bovines</b> going to transhumance in summer have to be negative tested before. (2) Initial phase: all non-tested bovines have to be tested. Movement restrictions are effective at the same time. (3) Calves phase: all newborn calves have to be tested. (4) Surveillance phase: several strategies will be compared using a modeling approach. After the pre-pasture phase already 595, 230 animals (37 % of the livestock) have been tested within four months. A prevalence of 1. 1 % of PIs was observed. The average age of infected animals is 403 days compared to 794 days for non-infected animals, with the oldest PI-animal being over 11 years old. On average PI-animals are slaughtered within 18 days after the last positive result. The pre-pasture phase has shown that sampling and testing a high number of animals in a short time is challenging but possible. The next phase will deal with double the number of animals in a similar time frame. The coordination between all partners as well as the collaboration of farmers is the key factor for ensuring the success of the program...|$|R
40|$|The {{infection}} of the digital area {{is the most common}} cause of lameness in cattle, leading to the rejection of high-production animals destined to reproduction. This study aimed at histological and histomorphometric evaluations of the testis of bovines with digital dermatitis. Different portions of testis from 20 Nellore animals, ten healthy and ten with digital dermatitis, between 25 and 30 months of age, were analyzed. All analyzed testis showed some degree of degeneration of the seminiferous epithelium. Mononuclear interstitial infiltrate was observed in testis of both healthy bovines and the ones with digital dermatitis. Bovines with digital dermatitis presented higher height of seminiferous tubular epithelium in all regions of testis, larger area of the tubular lumen, and larger tubular diameter. We concluded that <b>young</b> Nellore <b>bovines</b> show different degrees of testicular degeneration, as well as chronic nonspecific interstitial orchitis, unrelated to digital dermatitis.

Mimosoideae), as favas desta árvore foram administradas, por via oral, a 17 bovinos jovens. Destes, cinco morreram, sendo que apenas um deles recebeu 60 g/kg das favas, em dose única, e quatro as receberam em doses repetidas (10 g/kg durante 8 dias, 20 g/kg durante 3 dias, 30 g/kg durante 2 dias e 40 g/kg durante 2 dias). Macroscopicamente, as lesões se caracterizaram por avermelhamento e aderência das papilas, desprendimento do epitélio e congestão da própria, sobretudo no rúmen e com menor intensidade no retículo e no omaso. No abomaso havia congestão difusa ou focal e grandes áreas com erosões/ulcerações. No intestino delgado observaram-se congestão da mucosa e placas de Peyer muito vermelhas e bem delimitadas e no intestino grosso leve a moderada congestão. Os linfonodos mesentéricos apresentavam-se avermelhados, ao corte. Histologicamente verificaram-se, desde a cavidade oral até o omaso, áreas de acantose, espongiose, paraqueratose, hiperqueratose, necrose e degeneração hidrópico-vacuolar, com formação de vesículas ou pústulas intra-epiteliais, por vezes contendo queratinócitos acantolíticos, e desprendimento epitelial nestas áreas. Congestão e hemorragias focais foram observadas em todo trato digestivo, porém eram mais acentuadas no abomaso e no intestino delgado. With {{the objective}} {{to characterize the}} gross and histopathological changes of poisoning by the tree Stryphnodendron obovatum Benth., of the Leguminosae Mimosoideae family, its pods were given orally to 17 <b>young</b> <b>bovines.</b> Five of the animals died from the poisoning. One of them received one dose of 60 g/kg, and four animals repeated doses(10 g/kg for 8 days, 20 g/kg for 3 days, 30 g/kg for 2 days, and 40 g/kg also during 2 days). At post-mortem examination there was reddening and adherence of the mucosal papillae, breaking up of the epithelium and congestion of the propria, mainly in the rumen and with less intensity in the reticulum and omasum. In the abomasum, focal and diffuse congestion of the mucosa, large areas of erosion and ulceration were observed. In the small intestine there was congestion of the mucosa, and the Peyer's plaques were red and well defined. In the large intestine slight to moderate congestion was seen. The mesenteric lymph nodes were reddend on the cut surface. Histological examination showed in the epithelium, from the oral cavity {{on up to the}} omasum, areas of acanthosis, spongiosis, parakeratosis, hyperkeratosis, necrosis and hydropic-vacuolar degeneration, with formation of intraepithelial vesicles or pustules, sometimes containing acantholytic keratocytes, and splitting of the epithelial layer in these areas. In the entire digestive tract, focal congestion and hemorrhages were observed, more severely in the abomasum and small intestine...|$|R
40|$|Trabecular bone is {{routinely}} analysed by histomorphological-histometrical and immunohistochemical techniques as means of assessing the differentiation status of bone deposition and growth. Currently few embedding resins exist for which both morphological and immunohistochemical analyses {{can be performed}} on mineralised tissue. Paraffin, the standard embedding medium for bone enzyme and immunohistochemistry, can only be used on demineralised tissue, but then trabecular structure may be badly preserved. Methyl methacrylate (MMA), the resin of choice for undecalcified bone histology can only be used for bone immunohistochemistry if the usual, highly exothermic polymerisation procedure is avoided which destroys tissue antigenicity. Consequently, most current practices involve cutting samples in half to be processed in separate resins when more than one type of analysis is required. Technovit 9100 Newregistered is a low temperature MMA embedding system that is purported to significantly improve tissue antigenicity preservation allowing polymerisation at - 20 &#x 00 B 0;C. In this study, Technovit 9100 Newregistered-embedded undecalcified trabecular bone samples (adult human, <b>young</b> <b>bovine</b> and ovine) yielded immunolabelling with several bone matrix markers and preserved morphological features in 7 µm sections when stained with Masson-Goldner, von Kossa, or toluidine blue. Bone samples from all resins used were immunolabelled with antibodies against osteocalcin, alkaline phosphatase, osteopontin, osteonectin, bone sialoprotein and procollagen type I amino-terminal propeptide. Technovit-embedded bone yielded more reliable immunolabelling of the matrix proteins when compared with heat or cold-cured LR White or standard embedded MMA samples. Technovit 9100 Newregistered provided better routine histology than LR White, and was comparable to MMA. Results demonstrated that Technovit 9100 Newregistered {{can be used as}} a low-temperature acrylic resin embedding method for routine undecalcified bone histology, as well as for immunohistochemistry...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjective: Regeneration of the zonal {{organization}} of articular cartilage {{may be an}} important advancement for cartilage tissue engineering. The first goal {{of this study was to}} validate our surgical technique as a method to selectively isolate chondrocytes from different zones of bovine articular cartilage. The second goal was to confirm that chondrocytes from different zones would have different proliferative and metabolic activities in two-dimensional (2 -D) and 3 -D cultures. Finally, to regenerate the zonal organization, we sought to make multi-layered constructs by encapsulating chondrocytes from different zones of articular cartilage. Design: Cartilage slices were removed from three (upper, middle, and lower) zones of articular cartilage of <b>young</b> <b>bovine</b> legs. Histology and biochemical composition of the cartilage slices were analyzed to confirm that they had been obtained from the proper zone. Growth kinetics and gene expression in monolayer culture and matrix formation in photopolymerizing hydrogels were evaluated. Multi-layered photopolymerizing hydrogels were constructed with chondrocytes from each zone of native cartilage encapsulated. Cell viability and maintenance of the cells in the respective layer were evaluated using the Live/Dead Viability kit and cell tracking protocols, respectively. After 3 weeks, the multi-layered constructs were harvested for histologic examination including immunohistochemistry for type II collagen. Results: Analysis of histology and biochemical composition confirmed that the cartilage slices had been obtained from the specific zone. Chondrocytes from different zones differed in growth kinetics and gene expression in monolayer and in matrix synthesis in 3 -D culture. Cells encapsulated in each of the three layers of the hydrogel remained viable and remained in the respective layer in which they were encapsulated. After 3 -week culture, each zone of multi-layered constructs had similar histologic findings to that of native articular cartilage. Conclusion: We present this as an experimental model to regenerate zonal {{organization of}} articular cartilage by encapsulating chondrocytes from different layers in multi-layered photopolymerizing gels...|$|E
40|$|During the {{differentiation}} cascade of growth plate chondrocytes, cells undergo {{as much as}} a 10 - 15 -fold increase in volume. This volume increase, which occurs to different extents in growth plates growing at different rates, has been demonstrated to be the single most significant variable in understanding the quantitative aspects of the cellular kinetics of long bone growth. Our hypothesis is that this volume increase, which occurs through cell swelling by water imbibition, requires intracellular accumulation of osmolytes through activation or upregulation of membrane transport mechanisms. Significant intracellular accumulation of inorganic osmolytes, such as Na+, K+, and Cl-, is potentially disruptive to normal cellular metabolism, whereas intracellular accumulation of organic osmolytes is considered to be more compatible with metabolic function. Thus, we concentrated on determining the contributions of organic osmolytes [...] betaine, amino acids, inositol, and sorbitol [...] to volume increase. Pooled cryostat sections of <b>young</b> <b>bovine</b> growth plates were extracted followed by automated analysis for their content of amino acids. Analysis for betaine and the sugar alcohols was done by extraction and derivatization, followed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Parallel stereological analyses correlated osmolyte changes to stages of chondrocytic differentiation, specifically comparing intracellular concentration and amount in proliferative vs. hypertrophic chondrocytes. Calculations demonstrated that, maximally, these organic osmolytes, in total, account for 6 %- 7 % of the intracellular osmolytes required to sustain the volume increase, and that the most significant contribution is from betaine. This suggests that intracellular accumulation of organic osmolytes is not a primary strategy used by growth plate chondrocytes during volume increase of their terminal differentiation. The data also suggest that there is a differential regulation of transporters of these osmolytes such that intracellular concentrations are constantly modified as cells proceed through {{the differentiation}} cascade...|$|E

The intact males were heavier at slaughter, (515 vs. 468 kg; P<. 005) had less backfat, (0. 81 vs. 1. 11 cm; P<. 005), larger loin eye area, (89. 0 vs 76. 8 cm 2; P<. 005), more desirable USDA yield grades (2. 11 vs. 2. 92; P<. 005), {{a higher percentage}} of edible lean cuts (81. 5 vs. 80. 5), and less bone and fat trim (16. 4 vs. 18. 9 kg) than steers. Steers exhibited more marbling, (small+ vs. slight) a higher USDA quality grade, and reached market condition 5 d earlier than the intact males. Castration had a much greater effect on mean carcass cutout than did implant treatment. Whereas implant treatment affected percentage of blade and top sirloin, castration increased yield of every primal and subprimal cut studied except for lean trim and sirloin tip. Behavior characteristics of implanted and control bulls and steers were also studied. Implantation made bulls and steers more docile. Libido measurements were also lower for the implanted bulls as compared to non-implanted intact males.

40|$|The major aim of {{this work}} {{was to develop a}} cell culture system in which changes in the rate of {{synthesis}} of intervertebral disc (IVD) matrix molecules could be evaluated in cells of animals of different ages. In particular, the synthesis of the large aggregating proteoglycans (PGs) and of decorin (DCN) and biglycan (BGN) were investigated. In addition, the potential use of growth factors to modulate the anabolism of these molecules was also studied. The results of these studies have demonstrated that the age related decline in PG biosynthesis observed in human disc tissue can be reflected in a bovine disc cell culture model. The three dimensional alginate bead cell culture model was effective in maintaining the phenotype of disc cells from both annulus fibrosus (AF) and nucleus pulposus (NP) regions in the presence of serum. Differences in phenotype of these respective cells were illustrated in vivo by the patterns of resident PGs obtained from tissue extractions. In the AF of young animals, the predominant form observed was a small PG form while in the NP of all age groups, aggrecan was the major species. In vitro collagen analyses confirmed the different phenotype of cells from the AF and NP regions. Also, TGF-beta 1 was effectively used to stimulate over all PG synthesis in NP cells from and <b>young</b> adult <b>bovine.</b> After 10 days in culture, TGF-beta 1 treated cells showed similar relative amounts of the small PGs compared to aggrecan as those determined from tissue extractions...|$|R
