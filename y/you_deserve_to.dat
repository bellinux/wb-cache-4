Francona faced a dilemma when playing without a DH in the NL park of having to bench either Youkilis, 120-RBI man Mike Lowell, or 117-RBI man David Ortiz, as he had to choose from among them which two would play first base and third base. Bob Ryan of The Boston Globe called it [...] "the most {{difficult}} decision any American League manager has had {{to make in the}} 34-year history of the DH". Youkilis said, [...] "It doesn't bother me. I want to play, but I totally understand the situation. Look, I'm doing everything I've always wanted to do. I'm playing in a World Series. I'm playing every day. I'm happy. I just want to win.... If I have to take a seat, that's just the way it has to be." [...] Youkilis hit two doubles (both in Game 1) and had three walks in only 12 plate appearances in the 4-game win over Colorado, as he was not in the starting lineup for the away games. Dismissing questions as to whether he was upset about being benched for the last two games of the World Series, Youkilis said, [...] "Move on and go to another team if you’re worried about your playing time, and think <b>you</b> <b>deserve</b> <b>to</b> play over somebody else." ...|$|E

2500|$|Both Kate Blanchard and Scholz {{note that}} there are several {{passages}} in the Book of Isaiah, Book of Jeremiah, and Book of Ezekiel that utilize rape metaphors. Blanchard expressed outrage over this fact, writing [...] "The translations of these shining examples of victim-blaming are clear enough, despite the old-fashioned language: I'm angry and you're going to suffer for it. <b>You</b> <b>deserve</b> <b>to</b> be raped because of your sexual exploits. You're a slut {{and it was just}} a matter of time till you suffered the consequences. Let this be a lesson to you and to all other uppity women." [...] Scholz discussed four passages—Isaiah 3:16-17, Jeremiah 13:22 and 26, Ezekiel 16, and Ezekiel 23. On Isaiah, Scholz wrote that there is a common mistranslation of the Hebrew word pōt as [...] "forehead" [...] or [...] "scalp". Also often translated as [...] "genitals", Scholz believes that a more accurate translation of the word in context is [...] "cunt". Regarding Jeremiah, Scholz wrote, [...] "The poem proclaims that the woman brought this fate upon herself and she is to be blamed for it, while the prophet sides with the sexually violent perpetrators, viewing the attack as deserved and God as justifying it. Rape poetics endorses 'masculine authoritarianism' and the 'dehumanization of women,' perhaps especially when the subject is God." ...|$|E
