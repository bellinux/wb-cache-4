It is horrible {{to think that}} this may mean total sacrifice, but I believe that sacrifice is the only way for us to keep up to the highest traditions and provide service {{to the future of the}} Nation. Do not expect the possibility of truce or of Portuguese prisoners, as there will be no surrender rendered because I feel that our soldiers and sailors can be either victorious or dead. These words could, by their seriousness, be directed only to a soldier of higher duties fully prepared to fulfill them.

Peacock has the appointment at his disposal & if he {{can not find a}} man willing to take the office, the opportunity will probably be lost— Capt.

Don't put on any modest doubts or fears about your disqualifications for I assure you I think you are the very man they are in search of.|$|E
500|$|... "The Negotiation" [...] {{was written}} by supervising {{producer}} Michael Schur and directed by Jeffrey Blitz. It featured {{the end of the}} story arc featuring Roy Anderson's attempt to win back Pam, his former fiancée. Roy's portrayer, David Denman, reported he was [...] "really grateful" [...] that executive producer Greg Daniels allowed his character to develop, [...] "where all of a sudden, he wasn’t just a complete idiot but felt bad for being a bad boyfriend and wanted to try to get the girl back. It’s so rare to have that on a television show, because so often everyone wants <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> same character every week. It was quite refreshing creatively to get to do that." [...] Referring to Jim and Pam, Denman felt it was [...] "inevitable that Romeo and Juliet had to get together" [...] and end the series' love triangle. [...] "Otherwise," [...] he explained, [...] "it gets kind of tiring and old. I think it was the appropriate time , and I had such a great experience working with all those guys." [...] Denman also added that Daniels' decision stemmed from a desire to advance the Jim–Pam storyline [...] "to the next stage," [...] rather than having anything to do specifically with Denman himself. Denman briefly returned in the series' fifth, seventh, and ninth seasons.|$|E
