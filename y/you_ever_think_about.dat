5000|$|The {{film was}} filmed during the blaxploitation era, where women's {{sexuality}} in movies {{was known to}} be liberated. Coffy was released in theaters in the same year, where the title character was defined by her appearance. Although Uptown Saturday Night did not show female characters as explicitly as Coffy, they were shown in a sexually-suggestive manner. Particularly, sexual liberation was present when Steve and Wardell arrived at Madame Zenobia's party. Women were very playful with the men, and their evening gowns showed a fair amount of skin. Another example lies {{at the beginning of the}} film, with the interaction of Steve and Sarah Jackson, his wife. While the two of them are reminiscing in the kitchen about when they first met, Steve keeps referencing her butt, to which she responds [...] "Don't <b>you</b> men <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> something else besides behinds?" [...] This reinforces physical attraction being the primary source of attraction in regards to the female. In spite of this, both Steve and Wardell treat their wives with respect, which highlights a positive message of equality within their marriages.|$|R

5000|$|It {{has become}} a modern ritual {{tradition}} for Japanese students to eat katsudon the night before taking a major test or school entrance exam. This is because [...] "katsu" [...] is a homophone of the verb 勝つ katsu, meaning [...] "to win" [...] or [...] "to be victorious". It is also a famous gag of Japanese police films: many people think that suspects will speak the truth with tears when they have eaten katsudon and are asked, [...] "Did <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> how your mother feels about this?" [...] Even nowadays, the gag of [...] "We must eat katsudon while interrogating" [...] is popular in Japanese films.|$|E

Somebody else then takes it away and we never see it again: out of sight, out of mind. But have <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> stopped to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> where all that garbage goes? Does it vanish into space? Does it vapourise into nothing? We'd {{have to take a}} closer look. And when we really look at what we throw away, we can see that most of our garbage isn't really garbage at all, but rather reusable, recyclable materials. Every garbage bag contains valuable resources and energy that we are throwing away. Many of these things are made up of natural resources such as trees, coal, oil and aluminium and one day some of these resources will be used up completely...|$|R

5000|$|IBS News is an American {{news channel}} {{that appears to}} be a parody of FOX News. The station's newsreaders, Anthony Markowitz and Julia Regan (Claudia Christian), give long pieces of opinion after every topic, often using the phrases 'I'm no expert' or 'I don't pretend to know much about this, but...'. Anthony tends to give colloquial, ill-informed opinion ("When you flush the toilet on an aeroplane, do <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> where it goes? I sure don't!"), while Julia gives {{incredibly}} political commentary on the outcome ("Imagine the effect this will have on the already strict aviation guidelines in force"). They then inevitably link the story, however tenuously, to the weather report ("No more frozen urine falling from the sky, but expect rain over North Carolina"). It also covers the [...] "Vincenti Trial", a parody of the Michael Jackson and O.J. Simpson trials, where the main defendant is accused of murdering his wife who was having affairs with three different women in three hotels in three states simultaneously while technically dead ("Of course {{whether or not this is}} even possible has to be considered a legal nicety").|$|E

[...] Limbaugh said that requiring insurance companies to cover contraception is [...] "no different than if somebody knocked on my door that I don't know and said, 'You know what? I'm out of money. I can't afford birth-control pills, and I'm supposed {{to have sex with}} three guys tonight.'" [...] Limbaugh commented on Fluke receiving a call from President Obama, who stated that her parents should be proud of her, saying, [...] "I'm gonna button my lip on that one."

5000|$|... "All of the ballplayers in {{the movie}} were prepped for the film by Rod Dedeaux. He coached at USC for many years, and is a {{wonderful}} man, very full of life, energetic, very supportive, just really was very giving of himself and cheerful all the time, was a great spirit to have around. And one day, we were in between setups and I said, 'Hey, coach, what position did you play?' He said, 'I was a shortstop.' I said, 'Really, could you -- were you good?' He got very quiet, and he said, 'I could field the ball.' I said, 'Could you hit?' He said, 'I could hit the ball.' And he was strangely quiet. And I said to him, 'Well, how come you never played in the majors?' And he said, 'I did.' I said, 'Really?' said 'Yes, in 1930-something.' I forget what year he said. He was the starting shortstop for the Brooklyn Dodgers. He played one game, broke his back, {{and that was the}} end of his career.And I just blanched. I said, 'My God, you're Doc Graham.' He said, 'That's right.' And I said, 'Do <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> <b>about,</b> [...] "gee, the career I might've had."' And he said, 'Every day.' He said it very quietly. It was very out of character for him, and I was so touched by that. And I did look him up in the Baseball Encyclopedia: He did go, I think, 1-for-4 with an RBI. That was his lifetime stats. So having him be the man who trained all these fellows, including the kid who plays Doc Graham, was very meaningful to me, and I know it was to him, too. It was great to have him around. I think about that often, about what that must have been like, to be good enough to start with a Major League team, and for one unlucky moment, not be able to do -- the rest of your life takes another turn. What he did with that is, he put all of that emotion -- which could have gone into bitterness or regret -- into being a phenomenal coach. He sent more people to the majors than, I think, anybody else in college history. He's an amazing man." ...|$|E

Maintenance is something we should do for everything we own, and the older I get the more I think about maintenance BEFORE I purchase a product. The more expensive the car, for example, the more likely we’re going to want the best oil to maintain it. We all know what happens when we fail to keep fresh, or enough oil in an engine. Chiropractic physicians have long held that regular monthly follow up treatments even after you have reached maximum improvement are just as helpful for the spine, as are those regular oil changes you provide to your car. Yet {{there are at least three}} important questions we should consider including: a) how do we know whether chiropractic maintenance care really prevents back pain from recurring, b) can it help our overall health and well being, and, c) is it really necessary to come to the offic...|$|E
