The {{recent history}} of {{fisheries}} management in New England has seen substantial interannual variability in total allowable catches (TACs), with stocks deemed healthy in one year retroactively identified as overfished soon thereafter. Concurrently, avenues for and examples of coordination between fishermen are increasing in the region, as exemplified by the groundfish sectors and informal bycatch avoidance programs for <b>yellowtail</b> and windowpane <b>flounder.</b> A lag exists between the updating of a stock's overfishing status and the prescribed implementation of rebuilding plans {{as required by the}} Magnuson Stevens Act. In a coordinated fishery, this lag incentivizes increased targeting of a stock likely to be binding in the following year but with relatively high TACs in the current year. Fishing is a stochastic process, with output partially determined by the probability of encountering species of interest, either due to targeting or avoidance. Thus, although next year's TAC is not conditional on this year's catch, given the right conditions the probability of encountering a limiting stock is. In this research we use trip level data to investigate the empirical evidence for this type of intertemporal arbitrage, in which fishermen increase targeting of overfished stocks in a manner efficient only when viewed in a dynamic nature...|$|R

5000|$|In the North-West Atlantic {{landings}} {{have decreased}} from 4.2 million tons {{in the early}} 1970s to 1.9 million tons in 2013. During the 21th century some species have shown weak signs of recovery, including Greenland halibut, <b>yellowtail</b> <b>flounder,</b> Atlantic halibut, haddock, spiny dogfish, while other stocks shown no such signs, including cod, witch flounder, and redfish. Stocks of invertebrates, in contrast, remain at record levels of abundance. 31% of stocks are overfished in the North-west Atlantic.In 1497 John Cabot became the first to explore mainland North America {{and one of his}} major discoveries was the abundant resources of Atlantic cod off Newfoundland. Referred to as [...] "Newfoundland Currency" [...] this discovery supplied mankind with some 200 million tons of fish over five centuries. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries new fisheries started to exploit haddock, mackerel, and lobster. From the 1950s to the 1970s the introduction of European and Asian distant-water fleets in the area dramatically increased the fishing capacity and number of exploited species. It also expanded the exploited areas from near-shore to the open sea and to great depths to include deep-water species such as redfish, Greenland halibut, witch flounder, and grenadiers. Overfishing in the area was recognised as early as the 1960s but, because this was occurring on international waters, it took until the late 1970s before any attempts to regulate was made. In the early 1990s this finally resulted in the collapse of the Atlantic northwest cod fishery. The population of a number of deep-sea fishes also collapsed in the process, including American plaice, redfish, and Greenland halibut, together with flounder and grenadier.|$|E

However, protocols for grow-out of juveniles have not been developed and little is known of the nutritional requirements and feeding of this species. This study was undertaken as a preliminary investigation into feeding strategies for <b>yellowtail</b> <b>flounder,</b> in order to increase growth during the juvenile stage and to provide recommendations {{for the development of a}} species-specific diet. [...] It is known that growth and food conversion are influenced by feeding frequency (number of meals per day) and experiments were set up to determine the best feeding regimes for optimal growth and food conversion of 0 + fish (under one year of age). <b>Yellowtail</b> <b>flounder</b> responded well to differing feeding regimes, and displayed good growth rates and low food conversion ratios (FCRs) when fed one, two, or four meals a day, and twice every other day. However, feeding frequency was shown to affect growth rates and food consumption. Behavioural observations showed that juveniles fed fewer meals per day ingested more pellets per feeding but were not as accurate at hitting the pellets as fish fed more often. Juveniles fed twice daily had the highest growth rates and lowest FCR, and it is recommended that fish at this stage of grow-out be fed twice per day. [...] Body composition, condition factors and hepatosomatic indices (HSI) of wild and cultured <b>yellowtail</b> <b>flounder</b> were examined to make estimates for the possible formulation of diets for yellowtail, as well as to determine if present diets are adequate. Levels of storage fat were higher in the muscle and liver of cultured flounder and HSI was significantly higher (p < 0. 05) in these fish, demonstrating an accumulation of fat. This, combined with higher condition indices in these fish, may suggest obesity, or a surplus in body fat due to caloric intake exceeding the amount of energy required, relative to wild counterparts. Total proportions of n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) were higher in wild fish. Body composition of wild and cultured fish closely resembled the respective diets, and it is recommended that a diet be formulated for juvenile on-growing with high levels of protein, low levels of lipid and, within this lipid, high levels of PUFA. [...] The effect of n- 3 PUFA on the growth and body composition of cultured 0 + juvenile <b>yellowtail</b> <b>flounder</b> was examined in a third experiment. <b>Yellowtail</b> <b>flounder</b> did not display typical essential fatty acid (EFA) deficiency symptoms observed in other marine fish when fed levels of n- 3 PUFA as low as 0. 4 % for twelve weeks. However, they show poor growth after four weeks and preferentially conserve PUFA in phospholipid of liver and muscle and accumulate triacylglycerol in the liver, suggesting the commencement of a deficiency. The increase in the ratio of DHA/EP A in polar tissues of <b>yellowtail</b> <b>flounder</b> was related to good growth. Neutral fatty acid composition in both liver and muscle was affected by diet. Results suggest that <b>yellowtail</b> <b>flounder</b> require 2. 5 % n- 3 PUFA as a percentage of dry diet, with 10 % lipid, for optimal growth and development.

[...] Body composition, condition factors and hepatosomatic indices (HSI) of wild and cultured <b>yellowtail</b> <b>flounder</b> were examined to make estimates for the possible formulation of diets for yellowtail, as well as to determine if present diets are adequate. Levels of storage fat were higher in the muscle and liver of cultured flounder and HSI was significantly higher (p < 0. 05) in these fish, demonstrating an accumulation of fat. This, combined with higher condition indices in these fish, may suggest obesity, or a surplus in body fat due to caloric intake exceeding the amount of energy required, relative to wild counterparts. Total proportions of n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) were higher in wild fish. Body composition of wild and cultured fish closely resembled the respective diets, and it is recommended that a diet be formulated for juvenile on-growing with high levels of protein, low levels of lipid and, within this lipid, high levels of PUFA. [...] The effect of w- 3 PUFA on the growth and body composition of cultured 0 +juvenile <b>yellowtail</b> <b>flounder</b> was examined in a third experiment. <b>Yellowtail</b> <b>flounder</b> did not display typical essential fatty acid (EFA) deficiency symptoms observed in other marine fish when fed levels of n- 3 PUFA as low as 0. 4 % for twelve weeks. However, they show poor growth after four weeks and preferentially conserve PUFA in phospholipid of liver and muscle and accumulate triacylglycerol in the liver, suggesting the commencement of a deficiency. The increase in the ratio of DHA/EP A in polar tissues of <b>yellowtail</b> <b>flounder</b> was related to good growth. Neutral fatty acid composition in both liver and muscle was affected by diet. Results suggest that <b>yellowtail</b> <b>flounder</b> require 2. 5 % n- 3 PUFA as a percentage of dry diet, with 10 % lipid, for optimal growth and development. This level is higher than has been seen in the literature, and maybe due to its cold natural climate and wild diet of invertebrates, such as polychaete worms or amphipods...|$|E
40|$|From 2003 to 2006, 44, 882 <b>Yellowtail</b> <b>Flounder</b> (Limanda ferruginea) were {{captured}} and released with conventional disc tags {{in the western}} North Atlantic {{as part of a}} cooperative <b>Yellowtail</b> <b>Flounder</b> tagging study. From these releases, 3767 of the tags were recovered. The primary objectives of this tagging program were to evaluate the mortality and large-scale movement of <b>Yellowtail</b> <b>Flounder</b> among 3 stock areas in New England. To explore mortality, survival and recovery rate were estimated from traditional Brownie tag-recovery models fitted to the data with Program MARK. Models were examined with time and sex-dependent parameters over several temporal scales. The models with a monthly scale for both survival and recovery rate had the best overall fit and returned parameter estimates that were biologically reasonable. Estimates of survival from the tag-recovery models confirm the general magnitude of total mortality derived from age-based stock assessments but indicate that survival was greater for females than for males. In addition to calculating mortality estimates, we examined the pattern of release and recapture locations and revealed frequent movements within stock areas and less frequent movement among stock areas. The collaboration of fishermen and scientists for this study successfully resulted in independent confirmation of previously documented patterns of movement and mortality rates from conventional age-based analyses...|$|E

In 2001, the trawl vessel and gear were replaced; so, the time series indices were transformed. The transformed entire series of mean catches, biomass and length distribution for Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) are presented {{for the period}} 1997 - 2000 and for <b>Yellowtail</b> <b>flounder</b> (Limanda ferruginea) for the period 1995 - 2000, and the both speci es no-transformed data for the years 2002 - 2005. For 2001, there are data from the two vessels. This year the data were updated, so a new calibration was made. The changes affect the species length distribution. For Atlantic cod and <b>yellowtail</b> <b>flounder</b> there are no signifi cant changes, both numbers and trend of the stocks. For Atlantic cod {{we can see a}} decreasing of the biomass since the year 2002, with a slight increasing this year but without reaching the level of 2003, and it remains in a very low l evel.

40|$|The <b>yellowtail</b> <b>flounder</b> (Limanda ferruginea) once {{considered}} a prime candidate for aquaculture, were photothermally manipulated {{in an attempt}} to advance the ovulation time of females of this species. The success of these techniques would be highly beneficial to the broodstock management of <b>yellowtail</b> <b>flounder.</b> [...] Two groups of female <b>yellowtail</b> <b>flounder</b> were held under compressed photothermal environmental laboratory conditions as an attempt to advance ovulation and spawning time. One group was administered a controlled release gonadotropin hormone-releasing hormone analogue (GnRH-a) in February, the other group was administered a sham pellet in an identical manner. A third group of fish was held under ambient photoperiod and temperature conditions. The experiment ran for two years using a different group of animals for each year. In year two, a sub-group (five females) of the ambient control fish was given a GnRH-a pellet in February. In year one a total of 6 females were used in each of the photothermally advanced group. In year two this number was increased to twelve in both photothermally treated groups. [...] Throughout annual reproductive development the degree of advancement of the females was monitored using both ovarian cannulation and plasma steroids (estradiol- 17 P and testosterone) analysis. No significant advancement was noted in either of the photothermal manipulated groups in the oocyte diameters obtained through the cannulation or in steroid levels. [...] Advanced spawning in the group photothermally manipulated and administered the GnRH-a pellet (PP-GnRH-a) was noted in March in both year one and two. The photothermally manipulated group receiving the sham pellet (PP-Sham) did not spawn in advance of the ambient control group. Egg quality parameters, based on egg viability, fertilization and hatch rates, for the PP-GnRH-a group were excellent and were significantly higher than the PP-Sham group for viability and fertilization. Egg quality for the PP-GnRH-a group was not significantly different from the ambient group of females. The PP-Sham and control group both spawned in June, which is the expected ambient spawning time for <b>yellowtail</b> <b>flounder</b> in captive conditions. A single female from the ambient group administered the GnRH-a pellet in February spawned, however egg and larval quality was extremely poor, and larvae produced from this female did not survive for more than one day post hatch. [...] Further investigation is required to determine an appropriate way to advance ovulation in the <b>yellowtail</b> <b>flounder</b> using environmental cues, and to improve on general broodstock husbandry of this species...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the data}} of the Spanish fishery (1998, 2000 - 2002) and the Spanish 3 NO Survey (1995 - 2002) {{in relation to the}} Skate fishery in NAFO Div. 3 NO. According to the distribution pattern of the fishing effort in 1998, 2000, 2001 and 2002, it may be concluded {{that the majority of the}} effort were performed in shallow waters of less than 100 m. and in the second half of the year. The species composition of catches show that thorny skate is the target specie and American plaice is the main bycatch species Other less important species in the by-catch are <b>yellowtail</b> <b>flounder,</b> witch flounder and cod. The percentage of SSB in the catches for <b>yellowtail</b> <b>flounder</b> is quite high and constant. For skate the values shows a increasing trend in biomass and abundance. For American plaice the values are very stables in all years excepting the last year where the percentage of abundance was rather low. Survey data shows that almost the 100 % of the biomass and abundance of <b>Yellowtail</b> <b>flounder</b> was found in the stratum 0 - 91 m. For American plaice the percentage in the last years is more than 70 %. For skate the values are very variable between years.

40|$|The {{morphology}} and the histochemistry {{from the}} mucus of the posterior esophagus {{of the winter}} flounder and the <b>yellowtail</b> <b>flounder</b> were examined using light and electron microscopy. The esophageal mucosa of both species was organized into elaborate branching folds. The epithelium consisted of a stratified layer of cuboidal cells interspersed with mucus-producing goblet cells. The cuboidal cells in the surface layer also exhibited a secretory function and were characterized by Golgi-associated granules and apical micoridges. These cells were termed esophageal surface secreting cells (ESSCs). The granules of the winter flounder ESSCs were ultrastructurally similar to mucous granules, whereas those of the <b>yellowtail</b> <b>flounder</b> were reminiscent of serous granules. Both types were analogous to those associated with salivary glands in mammals. Both goblet cells and ESSCs from the winter flounder stained positive for sulphated acid mucins, whereas in the <b>yellowtail</b> <b>flounder</b> goblet cells stained positive for sulphated and nonsulphated acid mucin combinations and ESSCs stained only for nonsulphated acid mucins. A pregastric digestive function is proposed, based upon the thick muscularis externa composed of striated circular muscle, the increased surface area due to mucosal folding, the complex histochemistry of the mucus, and the secretory nature of the ESSCs.

40|$|Possible {{biological}} {{relationships of}} cod (Gadus morhua) with other important commercial fishes are explored. Cod year-class variations are compared with variations of <b>yellowtail</b> <b>flounder</b> and American plaice spawning biomass, mackerel age 1 + group abundance, and redfish densities. The adult fish biomass {{of these species}} are considered as an index of their egg and larval abundances. Possible competitive and predator-prey relationships between the 0 -age groups and young individuals of cod and these species are examined through correlation analyses. No significant relationships between cod and redfish and <b>yellowtail</b> <b>flounder</b> were found. It seems that mackerel is a predator on cod larvae. A positive high correlation between spawning American plaice biomass and cod year-class strength was found. High American plaice spawning biomass may promote high cod recruitment through a predator-prey interaction. Alternatively, both species may respond similarly to an environmental signal...|$|E
