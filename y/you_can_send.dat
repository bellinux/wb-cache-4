500|$|Towards {{the end of}} recording, Gabriel became [...] "obsessed" [...] {{with the}} album's track listing and created an audio {{cassette}} of all the song's beginnings and ends in order to hear how the sounds blended together. His original intention was to have [...] "In Your Eyes" [...] {{at the end of}} the record, but because of its prominent bass line, it had to be placed earlier in the listing on the vinyl edition as there is more room for the stylus to vibrate. With later CD releases, this restriction was removed and the track was placed {{at the end of the}} album. So was completed in February 1986 and cost £200,000 to make.

2500|$|At {{the start}} of the 2005–06 free agent cycle, Lawton had eight teams that he would sign with. Two teams were intermediately not interested. The Seattle Mariners, which were one of the teams Lawton wanted to join, were wary of taking Lawton because of his drug suspension, but {{eventually}} signed him.
