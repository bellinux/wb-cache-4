At one point, Walter tries to stop Gene by hiding in the bedroom closet and jumping onto him from behind, but in the ensuing struggle, Gene knocks him out cold with his gun. While Gene grabs Carrie and begins to talk to her, telling her how much he loves her, Peggy sneaks into the basement and talks to Lt. Washington, who tells her to try to sneak out the exit her sons did, but Peggy tells her that she won't leave her daughter alone. She sneaks into her room, grabs Walter's gun and points it at Gene, firing and killing him. As the sun rises, Peggy and Carrie walk out of the house while the police bring out the bodies of Walter and Gene. Lt. Washington then tells Peggy that Walter will be all right, adding that she could have lost her life while in there, to which Peggy replies [...] "When it comes to your kids, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> you have to do".

40|$|Gender, {{our social}} {{conditioning}} as males and females, {{is an important}} determinant of sexual risk taking behaviors. Gendered attitudes and beliefs like “the more sex I have, the more manly I will be ” or “sometimes <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> your boyfriend wants, even if you don’t want to, so that he doesn’t break up with you, ” pressure many boys and girls into engaging in sexual behavior {{that they may not}} want, and as a consequence increase their risk for unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. The first article in this series on gender and sexual health explored definitions of gender and gender equality. In this article, we focus on how boys and girls are socialized to adopt gendered attitudes and behaviors and how traditional and rigid gender norms affect sexual risk taking behavior. When does gender socialization begin? Think about one of the baby announcements you received in the last few years. Usually the first question from family and friends to the new parents is: “Was it a boy or a girl? ” At that point, the gender socialization of that baby begins. More often than not, girls will be given pink clothes and boys will be given blue clothes. As the baby turns into a toddler, girls often receive dolls and tea sets, and boys often receive sports equipment and toy cars. Later, as children are assigned chores around the house, it is usually the boys who do the outside work (e. g., take out the garbage and do yard work), while the girls do the inside work (e. g., clea...|$|E

Designing {{learning}} experiences for students {{is a key}} responsibility of teachers. This involves designing stimulating and engaging tasks, selecting and creating appropriate resources, and deciding how best to support students to successfully complete the tasks. This is a complex process in which many factors need to be considered. Learning design research and tooling is focused on how to support this teacher design work. Existing learning design tools support the authoring and sharing of learning activities, which - if represented computationally - can also be enacted in virtual learning environments. An {{important part of the}} learning design process is thinking about what it is that students are to learn. This then informs the design of the learning activities. However, research on how to support this early phase of the learning design process is scarce. Indeed, an emerging finding from research investigating teacher design practices is that teachers’ design work exhibits some characteristics synonymous with the broader field of design. Specifically, teachers formulate and work with a design problem. But, teachers generally don’t consider their work in terms of design. Thus there is scope to encourage and support design thinking in teachers along the whole learning design process, including in the initial phase of identifying a design problem. This paper reports on a pilot study where a learning design Problem Generation Tool was created, in the form of 20 stimulus questions, to generate deeper thinking about the design problem. The stimulus questions are based on 3 foci, which are to be considered in an iterative way to think about and generate the problem: Understand the nature of the design problem and your goals (e. g, What kind of problem is this? Why is this design being done?) Map your context (e. g., Who are the students? How will the course be taught? Who will teach in this course?), Plan your design approach (e. g., What preparation do <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do?</b> <b>What</b> is your initial plan or steps you will follow for your design process?) The tool was incorporated in the Integrated Learning Design Environment (ILDE), a community platform that integrates a number of learning design tools supporting conceptualization, authoring and implementation of learning activities. The Problem Generation Tool integrated in ILDE was used with eight participants, who were already familiar with ILDE, in a workshop setting in a postgraduate program at a local University in Barcelona, Spain. Participants had between one and five or more years of teaching experience. Results showed that participants found the Problem Generation Tool helpful. The level of perceived usefulness by question varied across participants, while a few questions were not sufficiently clear and need to be revised. Overall, there was evident elaboration of the participants’ design problems thus suggesting design thinking was stimulated and identification of the design problems scaffolded. This work has been partially funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness under RESET (TIN 2014 - 53199 -C 3 - 3 -R), the Maria de Maeztu Units of Excellence Programme (MDM- 2015 - 0502) and RecerCaixa (CoT project). Hernández-Leo is a Serra Hunter fellow. The Problem Generation Tool was devised from research funded by the Australian Research Council through the Discovery Project scheme (DP 140100406) : “Designing effective {{learning experiences}}: Investigating novice and expert teachers’ design processes” (Lockyer, Bennett, & Agostinho) ...|$|E
