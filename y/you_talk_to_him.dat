6000|$|... "I don't {{think that}} Jantje likes you, Meinheer Muller," [...] said Bessie, spitefully, [...] "and I do not wonder at it if <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> like that. He {{told me the}} other day that he had known you for twenty years," [...] and she looked at him inquiringly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh. Well. That. That's different. Besides, I don't nag 'em. Not what you'd call nagging. But zize saying: Now, here's Paul, the nicest, most {{sensitive}} critter on God's green earth. You {{ought to be}} ashamed of yourself the way you pan him. Why, <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> like a washerwoman. I'm surprised you can act so doggone common, Zilla!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's one o' Bob Pretty's larks," [...] {{said the}} old man, flushing. [...] "I see <b>you</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>'im,</b> and I thought as 'ow he warn't up to no good. Biggest rascal in Claybury, he is. I've said so afore, and I'll say so agin." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I shouldn't like {{to disturb}} {{that kind of}} optimism--and here he is; I'll leave <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> As it happens, Elcot looks rather grumpy, and the mail-carrier has just brought out a sheaf of my bills from Winnipeg which he hasn't seen yet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But {{you don't}} understand, Elfride,' {{he said with}} an anxious movement. 'You shall know him some day. He is so brilliant--no, it isn't exactly brilliant; so {{thoughtful}}--nor does thoughtful express him--that it would charm <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> He's a most desirable friend, and that isn't half I could say.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know exactly}} the sort of man you mean, always liking to lay down the law and talking to women instead of men, because they don't argue with him. No, Bobus must not come to that, and he is too young to begin special training. Will <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> Mr. Ogilvie? You know if my horse is not {{convinced}} I may bring him to the water, but it will be all in vain." ...|$|E
60|$|DOCTOR. [Sitting {{down and}} {{lighting}} a cigar.] Well, yes. The Duke does suffer a little from absence [puts his cigar {{in his mouth}} and pulls during the pause] of mind. He is all for compromise. Don't you know the kind of man who, when <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> about the five best breeds of dog, always ends up by buying a mongrel? The Duke is the kindest of men, and always trying to please everybody. He generally finishes by pleasing nobody.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] says Clive, [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> {{now about}} those early days, {{it was a}} jolly time! I do not believe there was any young fellow in London so happy." [...] And there hangs up in his painting-room now, a head, painted at one sitting, of a man rather bald, with hair touched with grey, with a large moustache, and a sweet mouth half smiling beneath it, and melancholy eyes; and Clive shows that {{portrait}} of their grandfather to his children, and tells them {{that the whole world}} never saw a nobler gentleman.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are welcome}} to our tents," [...] the sheik said; [...] "may your visit be a {{fortunate}} one! Mulick," [...] he called {{to one of the}} Arab boys, [...] "take Beauty; but first," [...] he went on to Edgar, [...] "it were best that <b>you</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> a little, and gave him some sweets. He will soon get to love you, and it is well that he should hear your voice as often as possible." ...|$|R
50|$|Fenton Hardy - Frank and Joe's {{father who}} is helping them {{investigate}} the Spencer case. <b>You</b> can <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> {{in the den}} in The Hardy Residence.|$|R
6000|$|... "How could he? Isn't it our {{business}} if he breaks his word with a parishioner of ours? If <b>you</b> don't <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> I shall. So there, Archibald!" ...|$|R
60|$|WALPOLE [vindictively] I wish I had: I'd make {{a better}} man of you. Now attend. [Shewing him the book] These are {{the names of the}} three doctors. This is the patient. This is the address. This {{is the name of the}} disease. [He shuts the book with a snap which makes the {{journalist}} blink, and returns it to him]. Mr Dubedat will be brought in here presently. He wants to see you because he doesnt know how bad he is. We'll allow you to wait a few minutes to humor him; but if <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> out you go. He may die at any moment.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you had any}} pluck {{you would}} make him {{understand}} that for your sake he ought {{to say what he}} means to do, so that I might have the advantage of the fortune which I suppose he means to give you some day. If you had the slightest anxiety to help me you could influence him. Instead of that <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> about my poverty. I don't want him to think that I am a pauper. That's not the way to get round a man like your father, who is rich himself and who thinks it a disgrace in other men not to be rich too." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I think I {{would make}} bold {{to insist on}} {{remaining}} there while {{you went to a}} magistrate. I have indeed already prepared Mr Evans of Llancolly, who is the nearest magistrate. I would refuse to leave the room, and you would then return with a search warrant and a policeman. But as for opening the special book or books, I could do that with or without his permission. While <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> I will look round the room and see where they are. I don't think much of it all, Mr Brodrick; but when the stake is so high, it is worth playing for. If we fail in this, we can then only wait and see what the redoubtable Mr Cheekey may be able to do for us." ...|$|E
50|$|Chief Collig - He is {{the chief}} of Bayport Police who is good friends with The Hardys. <b>You</b> can <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> about the people related to the game.|$|R
60|$|PETKOFF. <b>You</b> must <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> my dear, until Raina {{takes him}} off our hands. He bores my life out about our not {{promoting}} him--over my head, mind you.|$|R
2500|$|Was {{sympathetic}} to college coach Woody Hayes when he punched {{a player in}} the 1978 Gator Bowl. Gradishar knew Hayes would be fired but stated publicly that [...] "We all go off the deep end sometimes. Woody just happened to do it in front of millions of people." [...] Gradishar emphasized the positive aspects of Hayes: [...] "Every time <b>you</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> it was, 'How are you doing in school, {{when are you going to}} graduate, are you going to be a doctor or a lawyer? ...|$|R
6000|$|I am {{well aware}} that in {{describing}} the effect of Darwin's discovery on naturalists and on persons capable of serious reflection on the nature and attributes of God, I am leaving the vast mass of the British public out of account. I have pointed out elsewhere that the British nation does not consist of atheists and Plymouth Brothers; and I am not now going to pretend that it ever consisted of Darwinians and Lamarckians. The average citizen is irreligious and unscientific: <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> about cricket and golf, market prices and party politics, not about evolution and relativity, transubstantiation and predestination. Nothing will knock into his head the fateful distinction between Evolution as promulgated by Erasmus Darwin, and Circumstantial (so-called Natural) Selection as revealed by his grandson. Yet the doctrine of Charles reached him, though the doctrine of Erasmus had passed over his head. Why did not Erasmus Darwin popularize the word Evolution as effectively as Charles? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That may be true," [...] he agreed, [...] "but {{since we}} have the {{opportunity}} of these few moments' conversation, Nora, there is one thing I wish to say to you. I place no embargo upon your friendship with Mr. Crawshay. I do not presume to dictate to you even as to the subjects of your conversation with him. Tell him what pleases <b>you.</b> <b>Talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> about me, if you will--you will find him always interested. But there is one thing. If your lips should ever breathe a word of that other name of mine, or of those other things connected with my personal history of which you know, I warn you, Nora, {{that it will be a}} very bad day for you. It will be the one unforgivable thing, and I never forgive." [...] Nora shivered, although the afternoon sun was streaming down upon them. Her cheeks were a little paler.|$|E
6000|$|The {{third time}} around he {{discovered}} {{me in the}} midst of one of his antics. He was so surprised that he fell down. In a second he was up again, sitting up very straight on his haunches just in front of me, paws crossed, ears erect, eyes shining in fear and curiosity. [...] "Who are you?" [...] he was saying, as plainly as ever rabbit said it. Without moving a muscle I tried to tell him, and also that he need not be afraid. Perhaps he began to understand, for he turned his head on one side, just as a dog does when <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> But he wasn't quite satisfied. [...] "I'll try my scare on him," [...] he thought; and thump! thump! thump! sounded his padded hind foot on the soft ground. It almost made me start again, it sounded so big in the dead stillness. This last test quite convinced him that I was harmless, and, after a moment's watching, away he went in some astonishing jumps into the forest.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Having found it, most truly. But <b>you</b> must <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> yourself, {{and argue}} the matter over, with {{one who can}} argue. To me such {{questions}} are an unknown land.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, what's the use, Jesse," [...] I yawned. [...] "He can't see you. He didn't know <b>you</b> were <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> at the table, You are {{a fictitious}} character, you know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mistake!" [...] ses Bill Flurry. [...] "Why, I tell <b>you</b> I <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>'im.</b> It was Charlie Pearce right enough; scar on 'is {{forehead}} and a wart on 'is left ear and all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you think}} that I am a fool?" [...] he cried. [...] "Do you think I {{do not know that}} if there were not {{something}} moving in your brain you would think no more of that clerk, that bourgeois estate agent, than of the door-mat beneath your feet? It is what I always complain about. You make use of me as a tool. There are always things which I do not understand. He comes here, this young man, under a pretext, whether he knows it or not. <b>You</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> for an hour at a time. There should be nothing in your life which I do not know of, Elizabeth," [...] he continued, his voice suddenly hoarse as he leaned towards her. [...] "Can't you see that there is danger in friendships for you and for me, there is danger in intimacies of any sort? I share the danger; I have a right to share the knowledge. This young man has no money of his own, I take it. Of what use is he to us?" ...|$|E
60|$|A {{year or two}} passes, and {{you meet}} the same lad again--if indeed he is the same. For a strange change has come over him: he walks erect, he speaks clearly, he looks you boldly in the face, with eyes full of {{intelligence}} and self-respect; he is become civil and courteous now; he touches his cap to you 'like a soldier;' he can afford now to be respectful to others, because he respects himself, and expects you to respect him. <b>You</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> and find that the change is not merely outward, but inward; not owing to mere mechanical drill but to something which {{has been going on}} in his heart; and ten to one, the first thing that he begins to talk to you about, with honest pride, is his regiment. His regiment. Yes, there is the secret which has worked these wonders; there is the talisman which has humanized and civilized and raised from the mire the once savage boor. He belongs to a regiment; in one word, he has become the member of a body.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes, there is," [...] said Victoria; [...] "he regards you as {{a person}} whose opinion has some weight. I am sure of that. He thinks of {{you as a}} person of convictions--and he has heard things about you. You talked to him once," [...] she went on, {{astonished}} at her own boldness, [...] "and made him angry. Why don't <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> again?" [...] she cried, seeing that Austen was silent. [...] "I am sure that {{what you said about}} the change of public opinion in the State would appeal to him. And oh, don't quarrel with him! You have a faculty of differing with people without quarrelling with them. My father has so many cares, and he tries so hard to do right as he sees it. You must remember that he was a poor farmer's son, and that he began to work at fourteen in Brampton, running errands for a country printer. He never had any advantages except those he made for himself, and he had to fight his way in a hard school against men who were not always honourable. It is no wonder that he sometimes takes--a material view of things. But he is reasonable and willing to listen to what other men have to say, if he is not antagonized." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'They've {{no thought}} for anything,' said Emmie with contempt. 'You {{go up and}} get dressed, our Matilda. I don't care about him. I can see to things, and <b>you</b> can <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> I shan't.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your uncle is {{disposed}} to {{be pleased with}} you in every respect; and I only wish <b>you</b> would <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> more. <b>You</b> are {{one of those who}} are too silent in the evening circle." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Puss," [...] cried Anne, that evening, for Miss Russell {{had come}} to spend the night, [...] "how could <b>you</b> have <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> so? He {{scarcely}} spoke {{on the way up}} in the carriage. You have offended him." ...|$|R
5000|$|Mark is {{a passionate}} {{listener}} and supporter of Radio 4. When <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> you realise it's in his blood. I'm sure he will build on Helen Boaden's success and take Radio 4 and BBC 7 to new heights. Jenny Abramsky, BBC Director of Radio and Music.|$|E
5000|$|Red Dirt Report wrote [...] "His vocals are warm, with a John Denver-like wistfulness to them. Park is one {{of those}} Texas guys whose smart, soulful and {{personal}} songs are finding wide appeal. Plus, he’s constantly touring and when <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> in person, he’s as friendly and down-to-earth as they come...Texas Country/Red Dirt fans will definitely enjoy it and more mainstream country folks are bound to be enchanted by his voice and music. I certainly am." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Gianni is my godson (Italian: figlioccio), but I tell you, {{for me it}} is as if he was my son," [...] Rotolo was overheard {{saying to}} another mafioso. [...] "From this day on, you have to know that when <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> {{it is as if}} you talk to me. It is the same." [...] In other bugged conversations, police listened in how Rotolo {{instructed}} Nicchi how to kill a person. They also discussed how to extort Chinese shopkeepers in Palermo.|$|E
6000|$|... 'What's {{all this}} here to-do?' said the lady, {{as the boys}} fell off right and left, to save her the trouble of {{clearing}} a passage with her brawny arms. 'What on earth are <b>you</b> a <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> for, Squeery!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Will {{you let me}} return to-morrow,--just for a few days,--and then <b>you</b> can <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> as <b>you</b> please. I did {{not mean}} to come to stay. I wished him good-bye because I knew that I should not meet him here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, {{you have}} not," [...] said she, quite hastily. [...] "You were right, too right,--has {{it not been}} proved within the last five minutes? My poor sister! What {{can be done to}} mend Mr. Vavasour's temper? I wish <b>you</b> could <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> Mr. Headley." ...|$|R
