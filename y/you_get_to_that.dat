"You shall do {{everything}} very soon," [...] said he; {{and then they}} sauntered along pleasantly through the morning hours, and when they again appeared at Mrs Dale's table, Mrs Dale and Bell were astonished at Lily's brightness.

50|$|Kōwhaiwhai is an {{expression}} of the way our ancestors saw the world in their time. Their achievement, using positive and negative spaces, was to have the colours interact simultaneously - as opposed to how most people think now. Now we’re taught to see the positive space and not the space around it. It’s one of the simple conventions of kōwhaiwhai, but for me it’s achieving excellence through simplicity. How do <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> level? That’s what fires me up.|$|E
5000|$|George Starostin Reviews {{says the}} song has [...] "perfectly {{tolerable}} lyrics {{about a family}} breakup" [...] from an anti-feminist perspective. PopDose says [...] "'Helen' took an adult look at divorce and single motherhood {{in a time when}} the divorce rate was up and the traditional family unit was taking a beating. At first, the lyrics seem a bit judgmental, until <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> last bit in the chorus where the girls assure the newly single mother that she can, in fact, make it alone".|$|E
5000|$|Film director/screenwriter Quentin Tarantino {{has also}} {{expressed}} great admiration and praise for Cimino's The Deer Hunter, especially {{with regards to}} the Vietnamese POW Russian roulette sequence: [...] "The Russian roulette sequence is just out and out one of the best pieces of film ever made, ever shot, ever edited, ever performed. ... Anybody can go off about Michael Cimino all they want but when <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> sequence you just have to shut up."

One Seventy is just to small for him.” ...|$|E

But we're all really good friends and we love each other and I think they actually thought I was going to die, but they never took steps to kick me out of the band, which I can't believe because I fucked up so many times. I was drunk and making an ass out of myself and they were concerned about it....I'd clean up for a little while then I'd fall off the wagon, like addicts do....When everything blew up, everybody kind of lost their minds....I was clean for about a month...well, semi-clean; I can't bullshit about that...but I fell off the wagon after the Kurt Cobain thing. That fucked with everybody really hard. I mean, how do <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> point of depression where suicide's the only way out? ...|$|E

5000|$|During the match, to the {{surprise}} of the public, the press and his teammates, Ponsford announced his retirement from first-class cricket at the relatively young age of 34. His announcement remarked upon the changing atmosphere in high level cricket and touched on the effects of Bodyline. [...] I am feeling the strain of the last tour. I am thirty four and when <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> age you start to lose your keenness. ... Test cricket has become too serious. It is not a game anymore but a battle ... I can remember when it was all quite different to what it is now. I do not want to refer to that [...] "bodyline" [...] business—I am out of all that. Cricket was a different game before bodyline. Naturally I have a tinge of regret ... but it is better to go out of cricket before being dropped. Bill Ponsford [...] Woodfull remarked that Ponsford's retirement was premature, while teammate and journalist Jack Fingleton believed that the task of maintaining such high standards had affected Ponsford's nervous energy: [...] "At the age of 34 he felt that he never wanted to see a bat or a cricket game again." [...] Arthur Mailey suspected that Ponsford's sensitivity to criticism, especially from the media, was a key factor behind the early retirement. The memory of being omitted from the Australian side twice during the Bodyline series also stung Ponsford sorely. Ponsford continued playing for the Melbourne Cricket Club until 1939, but never represented his state or country again.|$|E
