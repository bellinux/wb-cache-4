500|$|According to {{the sheet}} music {{published}} on the website Musicnotes.com by Alfred Music Publishing, [...] "Sweet Sacrifice" [...] is an alternative metal and gothic metal song, set in common time and performed in moderate tempo of 96 beats per minute. It is written in the key of F# minor and Lee's vocals for the song range from the musical note of A#3 to G5. According to IGN's Ed Thompson, Lee sings the lines [...] "It's true we're all a little insane/But it's so clear now that I'm unchained", with her [...] "haunting vocals". Some critics found dark lyrics like [...] "I dream in darkness, I sleep to die, erase the silence, erase my life, our burning ashes darken the day, a world of nothingness, blow me away" [...] accompanied with [...] "rumbling guitars" [...] and a string section. A writer for the website Sputnikmusic found similarities between the songs on Fallen and [...] "Sweet Sacrifice". The main theme for the song is getting over from an abusive relationship. Jordan Reimer of The Daily Princetonian concluded that Lee sings the lines [...] "You know <b>you</b> <b>live</b> <b>to</b> break me" [...] and [...] "Are you still too weak to survive your mistakes?" [...] to Evanescence's past guitarist Ben Moody. That sentiment was echoed by Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone, {{who said that the}} lyrics [...] "One day I'm gonna forget your name/And one sweet day, you're gonna drown in my lost pain" [...] are aimed at Moody.|$|E

2500|$|An {{aspect of}} blessing in many {{cultures}} {{is to offer}} a wish that the recipient lives to 100 years old. Among Hindus, people who touch the feet of elders are often blessed with [...] "May you live a hundred years". In Sweden, the traditional birthday song states, May he/she live for one hundred years. In Judaism, the term May <b>you</b> <b>live</b> <b>to</b> be 120 years old is a common blessing. In Poland, Sto lat, a wish to live a hundred years, is a traditional form of praise and good wishes, and the song [...] "sto lat, sto lat" [...] is sung {{on the occasion of}} the birthday celebrations—arguably, it is the most popular song in Poland and among Poles around the globe.|$|E

2500|$|At his {{arraignment}} at the District Court of Pittsburg County on June 4, 2002, Duty asked Judge Steven Taylor {{to enter}} a guilty plea to the murder and requested the death penalty, {{against the advice of}} his defense counsel. On October 28 of that year, Duty was deemed competent to enter the plea after court-ordered evaluations by the Carl Albert Community Mental Health Center and Eastern Oklahoma State Hospital. While testifying on his own behalf, Duty declined to present any mitigating evidence and said that he preferred death over spending a life sentence in lockdown 23 hours day. He also wrote to the prosecutor that he would kill again. Mary Wise pleaded to the court to sentence Duty to life in prison without the possibility of parole, stating: [...] "I don't believe he ought to have a choice. I think he ought to sit in that cell and face those four walls and think about what he did {{for the rest of his}} natural-born life. And I hope and pray to God that <b>you</b> <b>live</b> <b>to</b> be 110 years old, because that's how long I want you to think about what you did." [...] Judge Taylor denied her request, calling Duty a [...] "textbook case for the death penalty". Duty was initially scheduled to be executed on February 24, 2005.|$|E

[...] "We had just ourselves, and we never spent less than seven, and we didn't dress, and we didn't entertain, either, to speak of.
