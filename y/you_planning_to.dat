Soon afterwards she became the party's National Press Officer (1987–89) and Co-Chair (1989–90). Lucas has a reputation as a party moderniser, in terms of internal slang, a [...] "spiky" [...] rather than a [...] "fluffy". In a 2009 Guardian interview, she told Decca Aitkenhead: [...] "when I was putting people up to go on TV programmes I'd be saying to them, 'What are <b>you</b> <b>planning</b> <b>to</b> wear?', and they'd be slightly offended that I'd even think of asking the question. But I do genuinely think that has changed, a lot.

Three days later Miss Rasmith said to Breckon, as he took the chair which her mother agilely abandoned to him beside her: [...] "The head steward says it will be a twelve-day trip, end our bedroom steward thinks more.

5000|$|The College Art Association {{holds an}} {{international}} conference in February every year. Special events and speakers are planned for the two conferences spanning CAA's centennial year in New York in 2011 and in Los Angeles in 2012. Approximately four to six thousand members attend, depending on the location, which alternates among major cities in various regions of the United States. The convention is {{the largest and most}} important of the year for makers and interpreters of visual art and visual culture; major university and many smaller college art and art-history departments interview candidates for teaching positions at the convention, although hiring occurs all year long. In addition to such job-placement activities, several hundred programs including presentations of papers and panel discussions on diverse topics (special sessions, forums, exhibitions, media presentations, governance meetings) and social events such as receptions and dinners hosted by academic art and art history departments and allied or affiliated organizations, as well as massive book exhibits located in one of the main hotel or convention center exhibition areas, fill the convention's four days from early morning through late evening. The name CAA is often used colloquially among academics to refer to this convention (as in [...] "Are <b>you</b> <b>planning</b> <b>to</b> attend CAA this year?").|$|E

5000|$|Zhu Mei {{subsequently}} {{sent his}} officer Wang Xingyu, with 50,000 soldiers, {{to try to}} attack Xingyuan to capture Emperor Xizong. However, although Wang was initially able to defeat Tian's subordinate Yang Sheng (楊晟), he was subsequently repelled by Man Cun (滿存), {{and was unable to}} advance. He thus became fearful that Zhu would punish him for his failures. Further, the eunuch Yang Fugong, who had succeeded Tian by this point (as Tian had fled to Chengdu to be under the protection of his brother Chen Jingxuan the military governor of Xichuan Circuit (西川, headquartered in modern Chengdu)), issued a declaration that anyone who killed Zhu would be given Jingnan Circuit. Wang therefore decided to turn against Zhu. Around the new year 887, he returned to Chang'an without first receiving permission from Zhu. Zhu, in anger, summoned him, stating, [...] "You returned without permission. Are <b>you</b> <b>planning</b> <b>to</b> commit treason?" [...] Wang responded, [...] "I am not committing treason. I am trying to capture the treasonous Zhu Mei!" [...] He seized Zhu and executed him. Pei Che and Zheng Changtu escorted Li Yun and fled to Hezhong, hoping that Wang Chongrong would protect them, but Wang Chongrong instead executed Li Yun and arrested Pei and Zheng. Both Zhu's and Li Yun's heads were delivered to Xingyuan and presented to Emperor Xizong.|$|E
5000|$|It {{has been}} debated {{whether or not}} Exodus belongs in the [...] "Big Five" [...] of thrash metal with Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer and Anthrax, due to their {{involvement}} with the early 1980s thrash metal scene. VH1 stated, [...] "Much is made of Thrash's Big Four: Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth, and Anthrax. True devotees know, however, that Big Five is the actual proper figure and that Exodus is the band that completes the quintet." [...] Anthrax guitarist Scott Ian also stated that, [...] "People talk about the 'Big Four' all the time, but back then {{it was really the}} 'Big Five' because Exodus were just as important and just as influential as everybody else." [...] Megadeth founder Dave Mustaine said in a 1990 interview that the [...] "Big Four" [...] were Exodus, Slayer, Metallica and Megadeth, adding that [...] "Exodus are a much better band - I really like Exodus. Gary Holt and Rick Hunolt are really great guitar players. I like Scott Ian, but anyone else in that band kind of bores me. Having a disco thing is not what I think having a metal band is all about, and that guy had the audacity to say that he and I should together! I felt like saying what are <b>you</b> <b>planning</b> <b>to</b> do? Open a disco fashion shop?" [...] Along with Ian and Mustaine, Holt has agreed that Exodus {{should be included in the}} [...] "Big Five" [...] of thrash metal because they [...] "were there at the start of thrash metal with Metallica in the real early '80s. Same thing with Megadeth because Mustaine was a part of Metallica's birth and he also created Megadeth." ...|$|E
