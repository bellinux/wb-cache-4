40|$|Background. The {{ability of}} the Sensory Organization Test (SOT) to detect subtle balance {{problems}} has been challenged. The Head-Shake Sensory Organization Test (HS-SOT) has been developed to improve the delineation of balance performance. Objective. The {{purposes of this study}} were: (1) to examine age-related differences in balance measured with the HS-SOT and (2) to establish the test-retest reli{{ability of the}} HS-SOT in <b>younger</b> <b>adults</b> <b>who</b> were healthy and older <b>adults</b> <b>who</b> were healthy. Design. A test-retest design was used in this observational measurement study. Methods. Ninety-two <b>younger</b> <b>adults</b> <b>who</b> were healthy (mean age = 28. 3 years) and 73 older <b>adults</b> <b>who</b> were healthy (mean age = 60. 3 years) underwent the SOT and the HS-SOT. Seventy-seven of them (56 <b>younger</b> <b>adults,</b> 21 older adults) underwent the same assessments 1 to 2 weeks later. Results. The equilibrium scores in HS-SOT conditions 2 (head movements with eyes closed while standing on a firm surface) and 5 (head movements with eyes closed while standing on a sway-referenced surface) were significantly lower than those in tests without dynamic head movements added (SOT conditions 2 and 5). Older adults attained significantly lower scores in both HS-SOT conditions than their younger peers. The test-retest reliability values, reported as intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC [3, 2]), of the HS-SOT scores in conditions 2 and 5 for the <b>younger</b> <b>adults</b> were. 85 and. 78, respectively; those for the older adults were. 64 and. 55, respectively. The corresponding minimal detectable change values for the former were 2. 7 and 16. 2, and those for the latter were 3. 6 and 22. 7. Limitations. Only head rotation movements on the horizontal plane were tested. Conclusions. Adding head movements to the SOT increased the separation of <b>younger</b> <b>adults</b> <b>who</b> were healthy and older <b>adults</b> <b>who</b> were healthy. The HS-SOT has good reliability, and the reported minimal detectable change values may facilitate the interpretation of clinical studies in which the HS-SOT is used to assess changes in balance performance in <b>younger</b> and older <b>adults.</b> Department of Rehabilitation Science...|$|R
