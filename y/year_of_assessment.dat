The second part of the study covers the new legislation. The new provisions are analysed in detail and their practical application was illustrated by means of examples. It is shown that the new legislation has made a vast improvement to the historical situation and that the areas of uncertainty have been eliminated. The current legislation is also critically analysed and it was found that, except for a few minor points of criticism, the legislation had succeeded in it's aim to bring certainty to this area in our tax law...|$|R

50|$|A fishery for Antarctic toothfish, {{managed by}} the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), has existed since 1997. The {{existence}} of this fishery in the Ross Sea, the area where most Antarctic toothfish are caught, is very contentious - the main argument proposed for this being the lack of accurate population parameters, such as original stock size, fecundity, and recruitment. Moreover, the main fishing grounds is presumed by some researchers to cover the area through which the entire stock of Antarctic toothfish pass. Typically the fishing season has finished in the area {{by the end of}} February and {{for the remainder of the}} year much of the area is covered by sea-ice providing a natural impediment to fishing. This fishery is characterised by opponents as being a challenge to manage owing to the nature of benthic longline fishing. The bycatch of other fish can also be significant, with the ratio to tonnes of toothfish caught ranging from 4.5% to 17.9% and averaging 9.3% from the 1999/2000 fishing season to 2013/14 in CCAMLR Subarea 88.1 when the toothfish catch first exceeded 50 tonnes and from 2.3% to 24.5% averaging 12.4% in CCAMLR Subarea 88.2 up to the latest publicly available figure from 2013/14. The bycatch of other fish species is also regulated to a maximum amount annually by CCAMLR. CCAMLR decision rules are based on determining the catch level that will ensure that the median estimated spawning stock biomass (not total biomass) is greater than or equal to 50% of the average pre-exploitation spawning biomass after a further 35 years of fishing (i.e. 35 years from each <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>assessment),</b> with the additional condition that there is less than a 10% probability that the spawning biomass will decline below 20% of the pre-exploitation level at any time during this period. Current spawning stock biomass for Antarctic toothfish in the Ross Sea Region is estimated to be at 75% of the pre-exploitation level (95% Bayesian probability interval 71-78%), well above the 50% target reference point.|$|E
