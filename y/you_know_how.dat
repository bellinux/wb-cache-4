I don't know what you're doing. You're doing A, D, F, G, B, D, C. You don't know how {{to write a}} song... Have you ever listened to pop music? Have you ever heard any rock-and-roll music... You should go downstairs when you leave here... and buy some rock-and-roll records.|$|E
5|$|In a 2006 Icelandic Radio interview, Fischer {{explained}} {{his reasons for}} advocating Fischerandom Chess:In chess so much depends on opening theory, so the champions before the last century did not {{know as much as}} I do and other players do about opening theory. So if you just brought them back from the dead they wouldn't do well. They'd get bad openings. You cannot compare the playing strength, you can only talk about natural ability. Memorisation is enormously powerful. Some kid of fourteen today, or even younger, could get an opening advantage against Capablanca, and especially against the players of the previous century, like Morphy and Steinitz. Maybe they would still be able to outplay the young kid of today. Or maybe not, because nowadays when you get the opening advantage not only do you get the opening advantage, <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> to play, they have so many examples of what to do from this position... and that is why I don't like chess any more... It is all just memorization and prearrangement...|$|E

25|$|Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> offhand {{that comment}} {{was and how}} many times I’ve had to face it since? I did say that. It was kind of true, {{but it was also}} a bit tongue-in-cheek. We were kind of told that might be the reason. It’s a six-minute song, which {{requires}} maturity for listening. What they specifically said, apparently, was that the voice was too mature. I don’t know if that means I sound old or I sound intelligent. I’m going to hope that it’s the latter.|$|E

500|$|Less {{than a month}} later, Pei {{suspended}} {{his work}} at Harvard to join the National Defense Research Committee, which coordinated scientific research into US weapons technology during World WarII. Pei's background in architecture {{was seen as a}} considerable asset; one member of the committee told him: [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> to build you should also know how to destroy." [...] The fight against Germany was ending, so he focused on the Pacific War.

500|$|For millennia {{people have}} tried to {{forecast}} the weather. In 650BC, the Babylonians predicted the weather from cloud patterns as well as astrology. In about 350BC, Aristotle described weather patterns in Meteorologica. Later, Theophrastus compiled a book on weather forecasting, called the Book of Signs. Chinese weather prediction lore extends {{at least as far}} back as 300BC, which was also around the same time ancient Indian astronomers developed weather-prediction methods. In New Testament times, Christ himself referred to deciphering and understanding local weather patterns, by saying, [...] "When evening comes, you say, 'It will be fair weather, for the sky is red', and in the morning, 'Today it will be stormy, for the sky is red and overcast.' <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> to interpret the appearance of the sky, but you cannot interpret the signs of the times." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2005, {{commenting on}} the success American Idiot brought the band, Sam Bayer, {{director}} of all of American Idiots music videos, stated [...] "The Billie Joe that I work with {{now is not the}} same guy that walked onto the American Idiot set a year ago. Now, he's a rock star. They were famous.They had done big stuff. But it's transcended that. [...] But he hasn't changed. And they haven't changed. They're three friends who love one another". Courtney Love also commented on the success of the band, stating [...] "Billie Joe looks absolutely beautiful. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> when people get super A-list, their face gets prettier? I think it's perception. [...] It's something that happens in your subconscious". At the time of American Idiots release, the album was not sold in Wal-Mart due to its explicit content.|$|E
