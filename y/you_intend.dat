25|$|The oddity {{of general}} {{practice}} in Australia is a lingering and arguably outdated {{perception that the}} decision to practise as a GP has low or no standing and status. Comments heard by many GPs including; ‘You are just a GP’ or ‘What do <b>you</b> <b>intend</b> on specialising in?’ reflect something of the community understanding of the general practitioner.|$|E
25|$|A claim can be {{made that}} the {{difference}} between the two cases is that in the second, <b>you</b> <b>intend</b> someone's death to save the five, and this is wrong, whereas, in the first, you have no such intention. This solution is essentially an application of the doctrine of double effect, which says that you may take action which has bad side effects, but deliberately intending harm (even for good causes) is wrong.|$|E
25|$|Guru: The will {{to suffer}} and {{sacrifice}} should be there. But {{there is no}} need to get drenched or starved. Enter where entry is banned and face the consequences, Take blows without giving them. If a fence is raised in your path , don't turn back, jump over it. Don't stop with walking through the road, enter the temple, every temple, every day, everybody. If the offering of pudding is ready, take it. Go to the place where free food is served in the temple; and sit along with others. Let the Government be informed of what <b>you</b> <b>intend</b> to do. One should not fight shy of laying down one's life. Those who think another's touch pollutes him should not be left unmolested in their so called cleanliness. That is my view…. Give publicity to all these in the papers. Let people know that I subscribe to their views. But let there be no violence or show of force. Don't be perturbed by coercion.|$|E

500|$|Evelyn Waugh, who {{reviewed}} the early novels {{as they appeared}} at two-year intervals, found Widmerpool particularly compelling. He wrote to Powell after reading At Lady Molly's (fourth volume): [...] "In the opening pages I felt the void of Widmerpool really aching – I could not have borne another page's delay for his entry. Did <b>you</b> <b>intend</b> him to dominate the series?" [...] After reviewing Casanova's Chinese Restaurant Waugh complained of a [...] "sad disappointment – only three pages of Widmerpool".|$|E
500|$|Describing {{the tone}} of the season, Loeb said, [...] "When we first started talking about Daredevil, we promised that we were telling a story that was first a crime drama and then a superhero show. This is more of a {{psychological}} thriller. This speaks to when you think about what happened to Jessica and what sort of destroyed her life and how she tried to put it together, and then to have to confront the person who deconstructed her world, that’s a very powerful, emotional place to start from." [...] On approaching rape and trauma in the season, Rosenberg wanted to avoid actually showing rape, which she called [...] "lazy storytelling" [...] and often a way to [...] "spice up" [...] male characters, and preferred to just make the trauma a part of the characters' everyday lives rather than an [...] "issue" [...] for the season to tackle. When asked about the adult nature of the season, including the use of sex, Rosenberg explained that Marvel would only not allow showing nudity {{and the use of the}} word 'fuck' in the season. Regarding all of the social issues the season covered, such as [...] "issues of choice, interracial relationships, domestic violence, [...] issues of consent" [...] while also exploring [...] "feminism and being a woman in this world", Rosenberg said, [...] "It was never our intention going in , and I think the minute <b>you</b> <b>intend</b> to do that, you’re stepping up on a soap box. If you’re digging into the dark side of the human psyche and all the different experiences we go through, and as women we go through, you’re going to find those things. If you treat them honestly and with respect, you’re also going to hit social issues." ...|$|E

[...] If <b>you</b> <b>intend</b> to eat wila, you must take proper care to ensure that you are collecting the right species, and that it is not a morphotype that is high in vulpinic acid.|$|E

2500|$|As Suveică writes, it {{was only}} at this stage that Tsyganko became an adversary of the unionist camp, placing his hopes in a reestablishment of the Russian Republic, and her re-annexation of Bessarabia. At the last Sfatul session, on November 25, 1918, {{unconditional}} union was proposed for ratification, as one of several measures being voted on, alongside the allocation of offices and a land-reform-law. According to the Peasants' Faction account, also supported {{by many of the}} Moldavian nationalists who had signed the earlier protest, the Moldavian Bloc kept the opposition uniformed about there being a Sfatul session: [...] "only Mr. V. Tziganko was aware of the fact, and he was informed privately, two hours before the opening of the sitting." [...] The Tsyganko group confronted the assembly's president, Halippa, arguing that his election was illegal. They announced another walk-out, to which voices of the Moldavian Bloc responded with rhetorical questions ("Is this how <b>you</b> <b>intend</b> to solve the agrarian issue?") and taunts of [...] "Good riddance!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Lu Shi (逯式), the Administrator (太守) of the Wei-controlled Jiangxia Commandery (江夏郡), {{often led}} {{his men to}} cause trouble at the border between Wu and Wei. When Lu Xun heard that Lu Shi could not get along with Wen Xiu (文休), a son of the veteran Wei general Wen Ping, {{he came up with}} a plan to stop Lu Shi. He pretended to have {{received}} a letter from Lu Shi and wrote a [...] "reply" [...] as such: [...] "I can sense your sincerity and sorrow when you told me you have disagreements with Wen Xiu. You said both of you cannot exist together and <b>you</b> <b>intend</b> to defect to my side. I have delivered your letter to my lord and will gather my men to welcome you. You should make preparations soon and inform us of the date of your defection." [...] He then left the [...] "reply" [...] letter at the border, where it was picked up by Lu Shi's men. When Lu Shi heard about it, he became afraid and immediately sent his family to the Wei capital Luoyang. His subordinates became distrustful of him and eventually he was dismissed from office.|$|E
2500|$|The Conservative Party {{would have}} to, preferably {{at the next}} election, ask: [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>intend</b> still to control the laws which you obey, the taxes you pay and the {{policies}} of your government?" [...] Five days after this speech, in an interview for The Daily Telegraph, Thatcher praised Powell: [...] "I have always read Enoch Powell's speeches and articles very carefully.... I always {{think it was a}} tragedy that he left. He is a very, very able politician. I say that even though he has sometimes said vitriolic things against me". On the day of the Mid-Staffordshire by-election, Powell claimed that the government should admit that the community charge was [...] "a disaster" [...] and that what mattered most to the people of Mid-Staffordshire was the question of who should govern Britain and that only the Conservative Party was advocating that the British should govern themselves. Thatcher had been labelled [...] "dictatorial" [...] for wanting to [...] "go it alone" [...] in Europe: [...] "Well, I do not mind somebody being dictatorial in defending my own rights and those of my fellow countrymen... lose self-government, and I have lost everything, and for good". This was the first election since 1970 that Powell was advocating a vote for the Conservative Party. However, the Labour Party won the seat from the Conservative Party, mainly because of the community charge.|$|E
2500|$|On October 22, 2003, {{during his}} one-day shift as Acting Mayor, while Mayor Willie Brown {{traveled}} to Tibet, Daly appointed two {{members to the}} San Francisco Public Utilities Commission without Brown's consent, having consulted with the City Attorney who had advised him that as acting mayor he had the legal authority to make appointments in Mayor Brown's absence. [...] Brown, who had his own people in mind for the assignments, had a different opinion, stating that [...] " [...] were made by {{a person who was}} supposed to be operating in a ceremonial capacity... a conspiracy to... move away from the traditions, the rules, the customs and the conduct that has been the hallmark of this city, long before I became mayor of this city." [...] Brown also compared Daly to a stalker and suicide bomber, stating that, [...] "When you conspire and calculate what <b>you</b> <b>intend</b> to do several days before you're designated as the acting mayor, you really are venal, you really are violative of all the protocols. It's like stalking. You knew exactly what you were intending to do. You concealed all your steps. You carefully plotted, then you did it behind closed doors, and then you laughed about it." [...] Brown said he found out about Daly's actions when his chief of staff called him in Tibet. Brown was sleeping at the time but with the assistance of Chinese officials, was on a plane home within hours, cutting short his trade and promotion trip to China—reportedly explaining the matter to his hosts simply as a [...] "coup." ...|$|E
