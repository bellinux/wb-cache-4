A former smith from Poltava, Kulesh worked together with Centurashvili. At this time, Centurashvili was only one month away from being discharged from the camp (...) And suddenly he surprisingly disappeared. The wardens looked around the hills, stated Kulesh's evidence, that last time Kulesh had seen his workmate near the fireplace, Kulesh went out to work and Centurashvili left to warm himself more; but when Kulesh returned to the fireplace, Centurashvili had vanished; who knows, maybe he got frozen somewhere in snow, he was a weak guy (...) The wardens searched for two more days, and then assumed {{that it was an}} escape case, though they wondered why, since his imprisonment period was almost over (...) The crime was there. Approaching the fireplace, Kulesh killed Centurashvili with an axe, burned his clothes, then dismembered him and hid the pieces in snow, in different places, putting specific marks on each burial place. ... Just yesterday, one body part was found under two crossed logs.|$|E

40|$|A toolkit is a {{collection}} of materials {{that can be used to}} help you to manage your health and keep track of important information regarding sickle cell disease (SCD). The Living Well With Sickle Cell Disease: Self-Care Toolkit has multiple uses. It is designed to help you and your caregivers with management of <b>your</b> disease, <b>medical</b> care, services, and health providers. The toolkit also will help communication between the many health providers and service providers that are involved with patient care. Because many doctors are not familiar with SCD, it is very important for you to take an active role in managing your own care. To make important decisions, you need to know about SCD, understand your treatment options, and then make the best possible choices for your health. Using the tools provided in this toolkit will help you to monitor your health care and manage your disease. Putting together a care notebook or binder that you can take with you wherever and whenever (for example doctor 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s appointments, emergency room visits, vacation, and the workplace) you need it will help you organize all of <b>your</b> SCD-related <b>medical</b> information in one place so that you can keep track of information over time.
