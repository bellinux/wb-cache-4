[...] "Lose Yourself", which is the soundtrack to the 2002 film 8 Mile, is the second most-successful soundtrack song in the entire rock era. It is behind Whitney Houston's version of [...] "I Will Always Love You", having topped the chart for 14 weeks. [...] "Lose Yourself" [...] is also the longest-running Oscar-winning number-one song since singer-actor Bing Crosby's [...] "White Christmas" [...] had 14 weeks on top in the 1940s. [...] "A Moment Like This" [...] is noted for its fifty-two-to-one leap in 2002, {{breaking}} the 38-year-old record set by The Beatles' [...] "Can't Buy Me Love", which jumped from number twenty-seven to one.|$|E

500|$|BBC Radio 1 {{announced}} the chart across three programmes, presented by DJ Nihal, between 29 December and 31 December 2009. The list of best-selling albums {{of the decade}} in the UK was also announced in a show on 28 December 2009. As it was broadcast {{during the last week}} of December, the chart did not include sales from the final week of the year. An updated chart, including sales up to 31 December 2009 was published in the UK trade magazine Music Week in the issue dated 30 January 2010. Apart from some unsurprising rises in the positions of songs from 2009, this updated chart included some major changes to the one broadcast on Radio 1.

[...] dropped from 25 to 42. [...] "How <b>You</b> <b>Remind</b> Me" [...] by Nickelback and [...] "Do You Really Like It?" [...] by DJ Pied Piper and the Masters of Ceremonies dropped out of the top 100 altogether.|$|E
500|$|The album's second single {{was instead}} [...] "U Got It Bad", {{released}} on September 4, 2001. The song, like its predecessor, topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart, for five weeks. It remained number one for one week, before {{being replaced by}} Nickelback's [...] "How <b>You</b> <b>Remind</b> Me" [...] for four weeks. The song {{then returned to the}} top, replacing the latter for four more weeks. [...] "U Got It Bad" [...] also achieved chart success in other territories, reaching the top five in New Zealand, Australia and the UK. The song has been certified gold by both the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand (RIANZ). [...] "U Don't Have to Call" [...] was released as the third single, on January 12, 2002. It impacted the Hot 100, peaking at number three, and the Hot R/Hip-Hop Songs chart, at number two. It was released with P. Diddy's [...] "I Need a Girl (Part One)" [...] in the UK as a B-side single, and reached number four. [...] "U-Turn" [...] was released as the album's 4th single, on April 30, 2002 as an international single. It reached the top-ten in Belgium and Australia.

2500|$|Towards {{the end of}} 2006, Monica {{released}} her next studio album The Makings of Me. Titled after Curtis Mayfield's recording [...] "The Makings of You", it saw her particularly reuniting with producers Elliott, Dupri, and Bryan Michael Cox, {{all of whom had}} previously contributed to After the Storm. The album received a positive reception from most professional music critics, with AllMusic calling it a [...] "concise and mostly sweet set of songs," [...] and Entertainment Weekly declaring it [...] "a solid addition" [...] to Monica's discography. While it debuted at number one on Billboards Top R/Hip-Hop albums chart, and at number eight on the official Billboard 200, it widely failed to revive the success of its predecessors. Singles such as snap-influenced [...] "Everytime tha Beat Drop" [...] featuring Atlanta hip hop group Dem Franchize Boyz and Elliott-produced [...] "A Dozen Roses (<b>You</b> <b>Remind</b> Me)" [...] failed to reach the top forty of the regular pop charts. The same year, she made a cameo appearance in the American comedy-drama film ATL, playing the Waffle House waitress.|$|E
2500|$|Williams {{joined the}} [...] Navy Reserve on May 22, 1942, went {{on active duty}} in 1943, and was {{commissioned}} a second lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps as a Naval Aviator on May 2, 1944. Williams also played on the baseball team in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, along with his Red Sox teammate Johnny Pesky in pre-flight training, after eight weeks in Amherst, Massachusetts, and the Civilian Pilot Training Course. While on the baseball team, Williams {{was sent back to}} Fenway Park on July 12, 1943 to play on an All-Star team managed by Babe Ruth. The newspapers reported that Babe Ruth said when finally meeting Williams, [...] "Hiya, kid. <b>You</b> <b>remind</b> me a lot of myself. I love to hit. You're one of the most natural ballplayers I've ever seen. And if my record is broken, I hope you're the one to do it". Williams later said he was [...] "flabbergasted" [...] by the incident, as [...] "after all, it was Babe Ruth". In the game, Williams hit a 425-foot home run to help give the American League All-Stars a 9-8 win.|$|E

2500|$|Hugh was consecrated Bishop of Lincoln on 21 September 1186 at Westminster. Almost {{immediately}} {{he established}} his {{independence of the}} King, excommunicating a royal forester and refusing to seat one of Henry's courtly nominees as a prebendary of Lincoln; he softened the king's anger by his diplomatic address and tactful charm. After the excommunications, he came upon the king hunting and was greeted with dour silence. He waited several minutes and the king called for a needle to sew up a leather bandage on his finger. Eventually Hugh said, with gentle mockery, [...] "How much <b>you</b> <b>remind</b> me of your cousins of Falaise" [...] (where William I's mother Herleva, a tanner's daughter, had come from). At this Henry just burst out laughing and was reconciled. As a bishop, he was exemplary, constantly in residence or travelling within his diocese, generous with his charity, scrupulous in the appointments he made. He raised {{the quality of education}} at the cathedral school. [...] Hugh was also prominent in trying to protect the Jews, great numbers of whom lived in Lincoln, in the persecution they suffered at the beginning of Richard I's reign, and he put down popular violence against themas later occurred following the death of Little Saint Hugh of Lincolnin several places.|$|E
2500|$|... "In the End" [...] is Linkin Park's highest {{charting}} {{single in}} the US, debuting at number 78 and peaking at number two on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart in March 2002 and being kept off the top spot by [...] "Ain't It Funny" [...] by Jennifer Lopez and Ja Rule. It stayed on the chart a total of 38 weeks. It reached {{number one on the}} Modern Rock Tracks chart for five weeks, starting in December 2001, becoming their first hit on this chart.

[...] It also reached number one on the Pop Songs chart for five weeks also and it stayed on the chart for 27 weeks. [...] "In the End" [...] was the 7th best performing single on the Billboard Hot 100 during 2002, and was the 2nd best performing rock song and alternative song of the decade on the Alternative Songs chart and the Rock Songs chart only behind Trapt's [...] "Headstrong" [...] and Nickelback's [...] "How <b>You</b> <b>Remind</b> Me" [...] respectively. [...] As of June 2014, the single has sold 2,555,000 copies in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|... "Everything to Me", the album's fourth {{track and}} {{official}} first single, reunited Monica with producer Missy Elliott {{and saw the}} pair basically reprising the formula of previous successes such as [...] "So Gone" [...] (2003) and [...] "A Dozen Roses (<b>You</b> <b>Remind</b> Me)" [...] (2006). A musical ode to all things good in life, written by singer Jazmine Sullivan, the retro ballad contains a prominent sample of the Deniece Williams' 1981 recording [...] "Silly." [...] Released to rave reviews among critics, who noted it the album's [...] "standout track — as solid as a brick house; great singing, great lyrics, great production, just a great all-around song," [...] "Everything to Me" [...] became the singer's most-successful release in years. Elliott also contributed [...] "If You Were My Man", {{one of the few}} up tempo songs on Still Standing, which Monica described as the song, who was most out of her character. Originally titled [...] "Betcha", the track samples Evelyn [...] "Champagne" [...] King's 1982 record [...] "Betcha She Don't Love You", featuring heavy elements of 1980's music, and garnered a mixed response by critics, whose reviews of the song alternated between [...] "blemish," [...] "brainless," [...] and [...] "funky". [...] "Mirror", the sixth track produced by Jim Jonsin, was recorded late into the production of the album. A song about self-acceptance, Monica noted the composition one of her personal standouts on the album: [...] "Its basically about being able to look at yourself in the mirror and be completely happy with the person that you are," [...] she said. [...] "Having no shame or feeling pain again, and I am at that place in my life." ...|$|E
