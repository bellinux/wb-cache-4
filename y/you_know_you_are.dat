500|$|The song {{contains}} a [...] "rolling" [...] synth bassline and [...] "truncated" [...] percussion, {{that according to}} Zuel, comes across as both [...] "alluring and ever-so-slightly sinister". It contains [...] "slow breaks", that according to Jamil Ahmad of musicOMH, [...] "wrap this record round you like walking into an exclusive club with a million dollar sound system – <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> {{going to have one}} of those nights". The pace of the song changes with its chorus, which Mikey MiGo cited as being [...] "a bit off setting".|$|E
500|$|On March 25, 1983, Jackson {{reunited with}} his {{brothers}} for a performance taped at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium for , an NBC television special. The show aired on May 16, 1983, to an estimated audience of , and featured the Jacksons and other Motown stars. It is best remembered for Jackson's solo performance of [...] "Billie Jean", which earned Jackson his first Emmy nomination. Wearing a distinctive black-sequined jacket and a golf glove decorated with rhinestones, he debuted his signature dance move, the moonwalk, which former Soul Train dancer and Shalamar member Jeffrey Daniel had taught him three years earlier. Jackson had originally turned down the invitation to perform at the show, believing {{he had been doing}} too much television at the time; at the request of Motown founder Berry Gordy, he agreed to perform in exchange for time to do a solo performance. According to Rolling Stone reporter Mikal Gilmore, [...] "There are times when <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> hearing or seeing something extraordinary ... that came that night." [...] Jackson's performance drew comparisons to Elvis Presley's and the Beatles' appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show. Anna Kisselgoff of The New York Times wrote in 1988: [...] "The moonwalk that he made famous is an apt metaphor for his dance style. How does he do it? As a technician, he is a great illusionist, a genuine mime. His ability to keep one leg straight as he glides while the other bends and seems to walk requires perfect timing." [...] Gordy said of the performance: [...] "From the first beat of 'Billie Jean', I was mesmerized, and when he did his iconic moonwalk, I was shocked, it was magic, Michael Jackson went into orbit, and never came down." ...|$|E

As Safin was forced to miss the tournament in 2006 because of injury, 2007 was his first Australian Open since he {{captured}} the title in 2005. Safin lost against sixth seed Andy Roddick in his third-round match in a grueling 3-hour match. Roddick commented after the match, [...] "With Marat <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> going to get an emotional roller-coaster. You just have to try and focus on yourself and I was able to do that tonight.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first level}} is [...] "The despair that is ignorant of being despair or the despairing ignorance {{of having a}} self and an eternal self." [...] Essentially this level is one which has the wrong {{conception}} of what a self is, i.e., is ignorant of how to realize the self one already potentially is. In this sense, the person does not recognize his own despair because he often measures {{the success of his}} life based on whether he himself judges himself to be happy. Regardless of whether <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> in despair or not, Kierkegaard asserts, you can still be in that state. He notes that this is the most common in the world.|$|E
2500|$|Rival {{networks}} ABC and CBS had discouraged [...] "their stars" [...] from {{appearing on}} The Jay Leno Show in its primetime slot. [...] Julia Louis-Dreyfus (The New Adventures of Old Christine) {{was the first}} CBS actor {{to appear on the}} show, on September 29, 2009; on that episode, she said [...] "there was a little pressure, because as <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> now on prime time", but that [...] "Obviously, I committed to doing your show and we’re friends". [...] This boycott did not affect The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien nor was it industry-wide. [...] Other TV networks, like Fox, The CW, and HBO, were more encouraging. [...] Hugh Laurie from the Fox TV show House was a guest on the September 25, 2009, telecast. House is produced by Universal Media Studios, a sister company to NBC through NBC Universal, and Fox does not offer any network programming in the 10 p.m. time slots, instead allowing most of its affiliates to go to local news.|$|E

Mr. Camperdown is the family lawyer, and when he writes to you letter after letter you take no more notice of him than a--dog!" [...] The old woman was {{certainly}} very powerful. The way in which she pronounced that last word did make Lady Eustace ashamed of herself. [...] "Why didn't you answer his letters, unless <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> in the wrong?
