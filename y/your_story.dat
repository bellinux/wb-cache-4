500|$|Arthur Jennings, who {{portrayed the}} clown [...] "Happy Dayze" [...] {{in the park}} during the 1950s, was an {{accomplished}} engineer who approached park management about creating Story Book Forest, a theme park based on [...] "emotion rather than motion". Jennings did {{much of the work}} himself, including life-sized models of fairy tales. The park, originally separate from Idlewild, opened in 1956. Story Book Forest featured many attractions such as a pirate ship, a castle, and many live storybook characters. The entrance to the Forest is a giant storybook which reads [...] "Here is the Land of Once Upon a Time ... Step through the pages of this big Story Book ... and visit the people and places every child knows ... and Loves. Here dreams are real ... and so are <b>your</b> <b>Story</b> Book friends." [...] Now incorporated {{with the rest of the}} park, Story Book Forest celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2006.|$|E
500|$|... don't take it personally, babe, it just ain't <b>your</b> <b>story</b> is a 2011 indie {{video game}} by Christine Love. Intended {{as a spiritual}} sequel to Love's , the game was {{developed}} {{over the course of}} a month and was released as a free download on April 4, 2011. Don't take it personally is a visual novel, with the majority of the plot taking place outside of the player's control except for key decisions. It follows a new high school literature teacher in 2027 {{over the course of a}} semester, with the ability to see private messages between students at any time without their knowledge. It deals with themes of privacy and relationships in the future. The game was received positively, with critics praising the interplay between the metafictional elements of the story and those of the game itself, with special acknowledgment reserved for the writing.|$|E
500|$|A {{sequel to}} God of War was first teased {{at the end}} of its credits, which stated, [...] "Kratos Will Return". God of War II was officially {{announced}} at the 2006 Game Developers Conference (GDC). God of War Game Director David Jaffe stepped down and became the Creative Director of its sequel. God of Wars lead animator Cory Barlog assumed the role of Game Director. In an interview with Computer and Video Games (CVG) in June 2006, Barlog said that while working on the first few drafts of script, he studied the mythology extensively. He said that the mythology is so large that [...] "the real difficulty is picking things that really fit within the story of Kratos as well as being easy to swallow for audiences." [...] Although he loves the idea of teaching things through storytelling (in this case Greek mythology), Barlog said, [...] "you can't let <b>your</b> <b>story</b> get bogged down by that." [...] He said that in the game, players would see [...] "a larger view of Kratos' role within the mythological world." [...] He also said that he liked the idea of a trilogy, but there were no plans [...] "as of right now." ...|$|E

500|$|In a January 2014 {{interview}} with Kerrang! magazine, Manson described {{the sound of}} the album as being [...] "very cinematic", saying that the [...] "redneck in me comes out in my voice" [...] owing to the album's inclusion of blues influences, while still retaining the harder elements of previous work. The album has been compared to the music which was used to soundtrack Sons of Anarchy. Manson called himself [...] "a man of few words" [...] , opting to allow melody to be its primary focus, instead of using characters or extended metaphors to compose lyrics. Lyrics for the album were all derived from a single notebook, with Manson admitting that the content of previous work was too scattered, as they were composed of material taken from up to 20 different notebooks. He has described it as being intentionally sparse lyrically, elaborating that blues music stems from the [...] "guttural, visceral element of music. I [...] holes in these stories so it becomes <b>your</b> <b>story,</b> it becomes more cinematic. For example in the film Rosemary's Baby, you don't see the baby but in your mind you do." ...|$|E
500|$|After Digital, Love {{worked on}} her first {{commercial}} game project, Love and Order, a dating simulation by video game designer Riva Celso. She did writing and design work for the game, set in the Crown attorney's office in Montreal, which was released in February 2011. Love describes the game as [...] "not really my best work", as dating simulations are not her strong point. Nevertheless, proceeds from the game were enough to support her financially for a while, and showed Love that creating games and visual novels could be a full-time profession. In 2011, she spent the month of March working on another visual novel: Don't Take It Personally, Babe, It Just Ain't <b>Your</b> <b>Story,</b> which was released as a free download on 4 April 2011. A spiritual sequel to Digital, the game follows John Rook, a private school literary teacher in 2027, {{over the course of}} a semester. He can see students' private messages at any time via the school's social network. Don't Take It Personally deals with themes of internet privacy and relationships in the future. The game was again widely praised by critics, with The Daily Telegraph awarding the game for [...] "Best Script" [...] in its video game awards of 2011.|$|E
500|$|However, IGN {{said that}} [...] "the problem [...] {{is that the}} {{character}} {{at the heart of}} everything, Squall, is basically a pouty jerk... When <b>your</b> <b>story</b> is character-centered, you'd better center it on a character the audience can care about. Squall... just doesn't fit the bill". 1UP.com ranked Squall second on its list of the [...] "Top 5 Most Irritating RPG Protagonists" [...] and stated that although he was an attempt to [...] "cater to the fedora-wearing, trench-coat-clad folks", his lack of social skills alienated players. Edge compared Squall unfavorably with Final Fantasy VII protagonist Cloud Strife, saying that Squall's angst [...] "didn't seem to have any context" [...] (unlike Cloud's, which developed from one of the pivotal events in Final Fantasy VII). His relationship with Rinoa was criticized by Edge: [...] "He [...] suddenly falls in [...] "love" [...] with [...] at the end [...]" [...] In GamesRadar's humorous [...] "RPG Emo-Off", Squall was defeated in heartbreak by Cloud. Squall was featured in the 1UP.com article [...] "Top 5 Final Fantasy Character Types" [...] in the second category, [...] "The Sullen Asshole", with Cloud and Cecil from Final Fantasy IV. GameSpy featured him in its comical [...] "Videogame Characters Who Would Suck in Real Life", saying that in reality he would be a terrible soldier.|$|E

500|$|The cast {{itself has}} {{received}} criticism from reviews. Lundigran criticized {{the manner in}} which romantic interactions play out, stating that [...] "considering that the love story is so integral to everything that happens—not to mention forming the central image of the box art—it's incomprehensible why no one says 'I love you' to anyone, ever". With Squall, he felt that [...] "FFVIII does break one cardinal rule: when <b>your</b> <b>story</b> is character centered, you'd better center it on a character the audience can care about. Squall, unfortunately, just doesn't fit the bill". However, GameSpot felt that Final Fantasy VIII shifts the story from the [...] "epic" [...] concepts of Final Fantasy VII to the [...] "personal", in that [...] "the characters and their relationships are all extremely believable and complex; moreover, the core romance holds up even under the most pessimistic scrutiny". A later editorial by IGN's Ryan Clements echoed this sentiment, appreciating that Squall and Rinoa's single kiss during the finale serves [...] "one of the player's main rewards for hours of dedication". Although the reviewer at Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine acknowledged possible fears over a romantic storyline, he stated that [...] "it's only later in the game, once you are really attached to all the distinct and complex characters, that the more emotional themes are gradually introduced".|$|E
500|$|Minogue {{has been}} {{recognized}} {{with a number of}} honorific nicknames. She has been compared to American recording artist Madonna in many media outlets, with Madonna identified as Queen of Pop and Minogue as the Princess of Pop. Birmingham Post said in 2000; [...] "nce upon a time, long before anybody had even heard of Britney, Christina, Jessica or Mandy, Australian singer Kylie Minogue ruled the charts as princess of pop. Back in 1988 her first single, I Should Be So Lucky, spent five weeks at number one, making her the most successful female artist in the UK charts with 13 successive Top 10 entries." [...] She is sometimes referred to as the Goddess of Pop/Pop Goddess. She has also been dubbed a Disco Queen. William Baker, co-author of her book , talking about her song [...] "Better the Devil You Know", commented, [...] "The track transferred well onto the dance-floor and heralded a long reign for Kylie as the new queen of disco... a pop princess." [...] Jon O'Brien from Allmusic reviewed her box-set [...] and stated [...] "Kylie has yet to make that one essential album, and the going-through-the-motions nature of her later releases suggests her time may have passed, but this box set still contains plenty of moments to justify her position as one of the all-time premier pop princesses." [...] In November 2011, on the twenty-fifth anniversary of the ARIA Music Awards, she was inducted by the Australian Recording Industry Association into the ARIA Hall of Fame. Many celebrities have named Minogue as a role model. Many media outlets have said many people, particularly woman, have undergone regular checks for cancer symptoms since her breast cancer diagnosis. In December 2006, Sugar named her the Most Inspirational Celebrity as voted by teenage girls. Editor of the magazine Annabel Brog stated, [...] " [...] couldn't be any more inspirational. She's friendly, gorgeous, talented – and this year she's shown just how strong she is too." [...] Television host Giuliana Rancic cited Minogue's cancer story as [...] "inspirational" [...] when she too was diagnosed with cancer. She said, [...] "When you get diagnosed, you don't know what to do… you Google. I went online and I read <b>your</b> <b>story,</b> and it gave me the strength to go public as well." [...] Musical entertainers who have cited Minogue as an influence include September, Diana Vickers, Paris Hilton, and The Veronicas.|$|E
