25|$|In 1933, Brodovitch {{added the}} Design Laboratory to the classes he offered. It {{was meant to}} be a {{workshop}} for his advanced students who wanted to experiment with all aspects of design. Brodovitch shared the Bauhaus belief that <b>you</b> <b>needed</b> to educate the whole individual by directing his or her attention to a variety of modern solutions in their graphic projects. His course description for the Design Laboratory read: The aim of the course is to help the student to discover his individuality, crystallize his taste, and develop his feeling for the contemporary trend by stimulating his sense of invention and perfecting his technical ability. The course is conducted as an experimental laboratory, inspired by the ever-changing tempo of life, discovery of new techniques, new fields of operation...in close contact with current problems of leading magazines, department stores, advertising agencies and manufactures. Subjects include design, layout, type, poster, reportage, illustration, magazine make-up, package and product design, display, styling, art directing.|$|E

500|$|Shivnarine Chanderpaul is an {{international}} cricketer who has played for the West Indies since 1994, and captained the team for a short time. He has scored centuries (100 or more runs in a single innings) on 30 occasions in Test cricket and 11 times in One Day International (ODI) matches. He is West Indies' second-most prolific batsman in international cricket, after Brian Lara, having accumulated almost 20,000 runs. He bats with an unorthodox technique, which {{is often described as}} [...] "crab-like", and is highly regarded for his [...] "patience and obstinacy at the crease." [...] In his list of the 100 greatest Test players, Shane Warne described Chanderpaul as [...] "a bloke <b>you</b> <b>needed</b> to crowbar away from the crease."

500|$|In 1972, Bob Marley {{signed with}} CBS Records in London and {{embarked}} on a UK tour with American soul singer Johnny Nash. While in London the Wailers asked their road manager Brent Clarke to introduce them to Chris Blackwell, who had licensed some of their Coxsone releases for his Island Records. The Wailers intended to discuss the royalties associated with these releases; instead the meeting resulted in the offer of an advance of £4,000 to record an album. Since Jimmy Cliff, Island's top reggae star, had recently left the label, Blackwell was primed for a replacement. In Marley, Blackwell recognised the elements needed to snare the rock audience: [...] "I was dealing with rock music, which was really rebel music. I felt that would really {{be the way to}} break Jamaican music. But <b>you</b> <b>needed</b> someone who could be that image. When Bob walked in he really was that image." [...] The Wailers returned to Jamaica to record at Harry J's in Kingston, which resulted in the album Catch a Fire.|$|E

Nonetheless, he praised the compilation for highlighting [...] "the sheer athleticism and skill that propelled Carey’s early work. She took very simple songs—both in terms of arrangements and theme—rooted in pop, gospel, and R and turned them into feats of strength, granting them dynamism and drama with a voice that juggled power, clarity, and agility with ease".|$|E

[...] British world music record label Tumi Music, who had worked with de Marcos and many of the ensemble musicians prior to Cooder, asserted that Cuba has over 50,000 musicians, all as good as, and some as old as the [...] "Buena Vista" [...] participants, [...] "but these people hardly ever have the opportunity to share their talents with the outside world."

500|$|Although Sylvain said Rundgren {{was not an}} interfering producer, he {{occasionally}} involved himself to improve a take. Sylvain recalled moments when Rundgren went into the isolation booth with Nolan when he struggled keeping a beat and drummed out beats on a cowbell for him {{to use as a}} click track. During another session, he stopped a take {{and walked out of the}} control room to plug in Kane's bass cabinet. Scoppa, who paid afternoon visits to the studio, overheard Rundgren say, [...] "Yeah, that's all <b>you</b> <b>needed.</b> Okay, let's try it again!", and ultimately found the exchange funny and indicative of Rundgren's opinion of the band: [...] "Todd was such a 'musician' while they were just getting by on attitude and energy. But as disdainful as he appeared to be at some points he got the job done really well." [...] Rundgren felt Johansen's wild singing often sounded screamed or drunken but were eloquent in the sense that Johansen demonstrated a [...] "propensity to incorporate certain cultural references into the music", particularly on [...] "Personality Crisis". While recording the song, Johansen walked back into the control room and asked Rundgren if his vocals sounded [...] "ludicrous enough".|$|E
500|$|Cliff Fletcher, who drafted {{him into}} the NHL, {{described}} Nieuwendyk as being a [...] "pre-eminent two-way guy who had 50-goal seasons", adding that [...] "{{he had a great}} stick around the net, he had a great shot, he saw the ice well, he could skate, he had the size – he had everything <b>you</b> <b>needed</b> to have. History has indicated that wherever he went, the team was competitive. The more that was on the line in big games, the better Joe played." [...] He was an offensive centre in Calgary and power play specialist, able to withstand the physical punishment required {{to stand in front of}} the net and battle defencemen for the puck. He led the NHL in power play goals in 1987–88 with 31 and finished in the top ten on four other occasions. [...] Wayne Gretzky, who also played box lacrosse in his youth, argued that the skills Nieuwendyk learned dodging opposing players in that sport aided his development as a hockey player. Nieuwendyk was regarded as a top faceoff man, a skill that Team Canada relied on during the Olympics. He was a checking-line centre at the 2002 Olympics, relied on for his defensive and faceoff abilities.|$|E
500|$|Other reviewers {{praised the}} character's {{gameplay}} and design. An {{editor for the}} video game website GameZone wrote that his attacks compensated for his appearance and described him as [...] "cool", while also praising both his weapon and fighting style. Adam Sessler and Morgan Webb of X-Play stated that, while Necrid {{did not seem to}} fit the aesthetic, the character did have some appeal. UGO's Doug Trueman stated Necrid's weapon had to be [...] "seen to be believed", and described him among other new characters as [...] " [...] something spectacular to the Soul Calibur pantheon". Tim Rogers of website Insert Credit called Necrid [...] "a work of digital art both in form and function" [...] and added that [...] "as far as console-only characters go—everybody wins with Necrid". Despite their negative remarks, an editor for IGN listed Necrid as eighth on their list of the top ten characters contributed to the Soulcalibur games by designers outside Namco and wrote that while they felt the character's gameplay was unbalanced, it added to Necrid's appeal; the editor wrote [...] "what do you expect from a man who shares a symbiotic relationship with the very energy that powers Soul Edge?

[...] "Having two women leads was the issue," [...] Nagy noted. In 2015, Berwin said that, in those days, it was a risky idea to play the role of Carol. [...] "As a project it came together with Cate Blanchett. <b>You</b> <b>needed</b> to always start with her role". Film4 Productions and Tessa Ross financed the development of the film and kept it alive throughout the years, as it [...] "underwent a decade-plus of revision under various directors and investors" [...] − including Hettie MacDonald, Kenneth Branagh, Kimberly Peirce, John Maybury, and Stephen Frears − until the project completely stalled. The long trek was a result of the struggles and roadblocks experienced with funding, rights, and trepidations about a film with a gay theme and two female leads. [...] "During its development, there was a very different kind of lesbian or gay movie that got financed", Nagy said. [...] "They were very agenda or issue driven, and this was not. In fact it insists on not being that in order to make the point. I would talk about that with financiers, and I could see them glaze over." ...|$|E

Becky's first serious romantic relationship in the soap was with builder Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas). Their relationship was a turning point in what {{has been described as a}} [...] "journey" [...] for the character. Kelly spoke of Becky's different attributes in their relationship, during an interview stating: [...] "She absolutely believes that she's 100% in love with him. I see it as a very teenage relationship because of the on-off status. Becky's very mature in many ways– she's very streetwise and if <b>you</b> <b>needed</b> something, you'd go to Becky and she'd find it for you. But emotionally, she's very immature. That's a lot to do with why she gets on so well with Roy because he's quite emotionally immature, too. It's probably the one level that they do connect on."

DeGarmo noted that her father, Angelo, [...] "who thinks his spoiled-brat daughter sings like a choir of angels" [...] puts pressure on Devon Hamilton (Bryton James), a young and upcoming music producer, to show Angelina the ropes of the music industry and make her a success. DeGarmo said: [...] "Unfortunately, she’s not as good a singer as she and her father think she is [...] Angelina is a bit oblivious to reality, but will slowly come to grips with it over the next few weeks. As a singer myself, it’s liberating to get on the set and throw all ego – and notes – aside and surprise people." [...] DeGarmo commented: [...] "It's fantastically hilarious because it puts the poor kid in a horrible predicament!" [...] She said that Angelina was into Top 40 music at first, but: [...] "the writers have her singing the American standards — Judy Garland, that sort of thing. We want the audience to be really familiar with the songs, so they can tell how badly Angie is butchering them." [...] Michael Logan of TV Guide noted that <b>you</b> <b>needed</b> [...] "skill to play a bad singer", to which DeGarmo said that it's harder than people realize: [...] "but it's really liberating {{to get out there and}} be bad. You just throw your ego to the wind and sing for Jesus." [...] Devon would eventually go on to make Angelina a good singer. Angelina briefly fired Devon for adding rap verses to a song of hers which was soaring on the charts, but he retained the rights of the track.|$|E
