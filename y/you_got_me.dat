Spears references The Notorious B.I.G.'s hit [...] "Hypnotize" [...] in [...] "(Drop Dead) Beautiful" [...] in the line [...] "You must be B.I.G. because <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>me</b> Hypnotized". Spears' vocals on [...] "(Drop Dead) Beautiful" [...] were deemed as [...] "robotic", but similar to the ones of [...] "Oops!... I Did It Again" [...] (2000). Jocelyn Vena of MTV noted the singer uses her deep vocals in lines such as [...] "And, yeah, your body looks so sick, I think I caught the flu" [...] and [...] "You must be B.I.G.

500|$|Claudia Mitchell and Jacqueline Reid-Walsh, {{authors of}} Girl Culture: Studying girl culture : a readers' guide (2008), noted {{the lyrics of}} the song [...] "gesture toward [...] longing {{for the return of}} an ex-boyfriend." [...] Spears said [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] is a song [...] "every girl can relate to. She regrets it. She wants him back." [...] The lyrics, however, caused {{controversy}} in the United States, because the line [...] "Hit me baby one more time" [...] supposedly has sadomasochistic connotations. As a response, the singer said the line [...] "doesn't mean physically hit me. [...] It means just give me a sign, basically. I think it's kind of funny that people would actually think that's what it meant." [...] Contemporary author Ben Shapiro deemed the song's lyrics as suggestive, mostly [...] "Oh baby, baby / The reason I breathe is you / Boy, <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>me</b> blinded / Oh pretty baby / There's nothing that I wouldn't do" [...] and [...] "When I'm not with you I lose my mind / Give me a sign / Hit me baby one more time".|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{it finds}} B.o.B {{throwing}} away his old habits {{and telling the}} girl he loves {{not to worry about}} other women as he wants to [...] "settle down", while flattering her. In the hook and bridge, Mars is able to allure the girl, who is the object of all this affection, by serenading her. B.o.B, during his verses, makes references appealing not only to younger supporters, [...] "Just like that, girl, <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>me</b> froze/ Like a Nintendo 64", but also to older admirers, [...] "Baby you the whole package, plus you pay your taxes". Tiny Mix Tapes pointed out that the song's lyrics use [...] "clumsy analogies". Batey found B.o.B's attitude and rapping verses care free, in which you can almost hear him smiling. David Jeffries had a different opinion, stating that the rapper [...] "courts the ladies" [...] on the song along with Mars. He also added that B.o.B transmitted his [...] "positive vibes" [...] on [...] "Nothin' on You". B.o.B compared the song's [...] "spirit" [...] to [...] "Bonita Applebum" [...] by A Tribe Called Quest. Mars confessed that the lyrics are about someone, saying they come from [...] "real-life experience, whether it's at the time or me back-tracking to how I felt at another moment." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Natalie Nichols of the Los Angeles Times, {{the lyrics}} of [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] {{reference}} a state of romantic obsession. Beyoncé said that the song talks [...] "about how, when you are falling in love, you {{do things that are}} out of character and you do not really care because you are just open." [...] Anthony DeCurtis of Rolling Stone wrote that [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] has [...] "such a cauldron of energy," [...] that Beyoncé sounds [...] "loose and sexy," [...] gripped by emotions she [...] "can neither understand nor control." [...] The lyrics are composed in the traditional verse-chorus form. Jay Z opens the song with a brief spoken verse-rap, containing the lyrics: [...] "Yes! So crazy right now. Most incredibly, it's your girl, B. It's your boy, Young. You ready?" [...] After Beyoncé delivers the [...] "uh-oh, uh-oh" [...] catchphrase, Jay Z continues the monologue. Beyoncé begins the first verse, followed with the whistle-backed chorus. She repeats the [...] "uh-oh, uh-oh" [...] phrase, leading to the second verse. The chorus follows, giving way to the second verse-rap which contains the lyrics: [...] "Jay Z in the range, crazy and deranged [...] I been inhaling the chain smokers, how you think I got the name 'Hova', I been real and the game's over". The song continues to the bridge, singing: [...] "I'm not myself, lately I'm foolish, I don't do this, / I've been playing myself, baby, I don't care / 'Cuz your love's got the best of me, / And baby, you're making a fool of me, / <b>You</b> <b>got</b> <b>me</b> sprung and I don't care who sees." [...] She then sings the chorus again and the song fades out with the horns.|$|E

[...] He began using Goa music, something he discovered on the beaches of Goa in India, fusing it with similar-sounding European tracks to create his own distinct sound.

2500|$|Throughout the song, Beyoncé sings with [...] "a sassy attitude", {{setting a}} [...] "futuristic tone", {{as stated by}} Jocelyn Vena. According to Dombal, [...] "Countdown" [...] finds Knowles as the female protagonist {{delivering}} her [...] "message of ten years of loyalty" [...] to her love interest. Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone, who described [...] "Countdown" [...] as a [...] "monogamous romance", added {{that it is a}} love song that is [...] "no less sexy for being unblinkingly true to life", and Jocelyn Vena of MTV News wrote that the song is [...] "all about the rapture of true love". Kicking off with a reggae-ish beat, horns and drums, Knowles starts to chant the introductory lines, which also serves as the pre-chorus lines, [...] "Oh, killing me softly and I'm still falling / Still the one I need, I will always be with you / Oh, <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>me</b> all gone, don't ever let me go / Say it real loud if you fly / If you leave me you're out of your mind", followed by the chorus lines, which is a literal count backwards where Knowles counts down the ways in which she loves her man, [...] "My baby is a ten / We dressing to the nine / He pick me up at eight / Make me feel so lucky seven / He kiss me in his six / We be making love in five / Still the one I do this four / I’m trying to make a three / From that two / He still the one." ...|$|E
