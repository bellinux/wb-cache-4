The transformed calli were selected gradually on medium containing hygromycin (50, 100 mg/l) and regenerated on medium containing 0. 5 mg/l IAA and 0. 3 mg/l BAP. GUS activity in infected calli was detected by histochemical assay 3 days after inoculation. The highest (100 %) transformation efficiency were obtained from calli transformed with pCAMBIA 1303 and 1304. Thirty four out of 77 transformed shoots were tested positive for the cryIB-cryIAa gene using PCR analysis. These shoots were grown in the soil to maturity and to collect the seeds.

Entomopathogenic nematodes from the genus Steinernema and Heterorhabditis are promising biological control agents for this pest as their infective juveniles (IJs) are capable of seeking and infecting insect living in moist, cryptic habitat such as galleries created by <b>stem</b> <b>borer</b> larvae. Thirteen indigenous and exotic Steinernema and Heterorhabditis sprayed to rice seedlings in laboratory with nematodes at concentrations of 0. 5 or 2. 0 × 104 IJs ml- 1 water caused larval mortality between 7 – 93 %. Further test in greenhouse on nematodes that had > 50 % efficacy showed that an indigenous isolate, H. indicus INA H 17, was the most effective among the tested nematodes in killing larvae or pupae (78 %). Reduction in plant damage caused by the insects could not be demonstrated as the trials was limited to potted plants. The survival ability of nematodes on rice plants was evaluated by using INA H 4 as an example. A low percentage of INA H 4 IJs (0. 5 %) persisted in inner leaf sheath until 7 days post application, while IJs on leaf surface and outer leaf sheath survived only until 2 and 48 hours post application, respectively.

A synthetic cry 1 Ac gene, codon optimised for rice and {{driven by the}} maize ubiquitin- 1 promoter, was used. Over 200 putative transformants of IR- 64 and Pusa Basmati- 1 and 26 of the Karnal Local were regenerated following use of the hpt (hygromycin phosphotransferase) selection system. Initial transformation frequency was {{in the range of}} 1 to 2 % for particle bombardment while it was comparatively higher (9 %) for Agrobacterium. An improved selection procedure, involving longer selection on the antibiotic-supplemented medium, enhanced the frequency of Bt-transformants and reduced the number of escapes. Molecular evaluation revealed multiple transgene insertions in transformants, whether generated through biolistic or Agrobacterium. In the latter case, it was also observed that all genes on the T-DNA do not necessarily get transferred as an intact insert.

Efficacy of removing YRSB egg masses and spraying with three insecticides was also examined. The results showed that the densities of YRSB larvae and pupae were very low in main rice-cropping times, i. e., late spring and middle summer seasons. In fact, the percentages of dead hearts and white heads were low. However, in middle summer, the density of YRSB and the percentage of damaged stems were higher than those in late spring rice. Efficacy of controlling measures was then evaluated with 11 treatments consisting of egg mass removal and insecticide applications. The results demonstrated that all measures provided better control of YRSB than the control. However, different measures resulted in different percentages of white heads.

Treatments comprised of seven different dose of inorganic N fertilizer viz 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140 kg/ha respectively. Field with no fertilizer application was considered as control. In all the cases higher the doses of inorganic N fertilizer, higher would be the incidence of adult YSB population and accordingly the extent of damage was intensified. Incidence of dead heart (DH) and white head (WH) was 175. 74 % and 206. 72 % higher than the control field when the field was fertilized by 140 kg N/ha. Yield attributing characters differed considerably among the treatments. Maximum panicle length (1. 71 cm), Effective tiller number / hill (62. 01), filled grain number / panicle (66. 12), tiller number/hill (11. 27), leaf number/hill (48. 11) and leaf width (9. 11 mm) was noted when the field was fertilized with 100 kg N. But no significant improvement of yield attributing characters except the number of filled grain number / panicle was noted when the dose of fertilizer was increased after 100 kg N/ha. Insignificant variation of grain amylose and protein content, total phenol and ortho-dihydroxy phenol (OD phenol) amount under different fertilizer treatment was noted. Plant moisture content, however, was increased as the dose of N fertilizer was improved. Field application of 100 kg N/ha is thus suggested for Tulaipanji cultivation.

The four major host plants (Cyperus spp., Panicum spp., Pennisetum spp., and Sorghum spp.) found in natural habitats were also assessed, and both the cultivated and natural habitat species occurred in four agroecological zones in Kenya. Across habitats, plant infestation (23. 2 %), <b>stem</b> <b>borer</b> density (2. 2 per plant), and larval parasitism (15. 0 %) were highest in maize in cultivated habitats. Pupal parasitism was not higher than 4. 7 % in both habitats, and did not vary with locality during each season or with host plant between each season. Cotesia sesamiae (Cameron) and C. flavipes Cameron (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) were the key parasitoids in cultivated habitats (both species accounted for 76. 4 % of parasitized <b>stem</b> <b>borers</b> in cereal crops), but not in natural habitats (the two Cotesia species accounted for 14. 5 % of parasitized <b>stem</b> <b>borers</b> in wild host plants). No single parasitoid species exerted high parasitism rates on <b>stem</b> <b>borer</b> populations in wild host plants. Low <b>stem</b> <b>borer</b> densities across seasons in natural habitats indicate that cereal <b>stem</b> <b>borer</b> pests do not necessarily survive the non-cropping season feeding actively in wild host plants. Although natural habitats provided refuges for some parasitoid species, <b>stem</b> <b>borer</b> parasitism was generally low in wild host plants. Overall, because parasitoids contribute little in reducing cereal <b>stem</b> <b>borer</b> pest populations in cultivated habitats, there is need to further enhance their effectiveness {{in the field to}} regulate these pests...|$|R
40|$|The pink <b>stem</b> <b>borer</b> (Sesamia nonagrioides Lef.) is {{the main}} corn (Zea mays L.) pest in the Mediterranean area. Although, {{screening}} for resistance to this pest has been successful, the level of resistance shown by the most resistant varieties is not high. The objectives of the present work were: (i) the evaluation for pink <b>stem</b> <b>borer</b> resistance of the nontested inbred lines, field and popcorn materials, from the collection maintained at the Misión Biológica de Galicia and (ii) {{the study of the}} performance, under pink <b>stem</b> <b>borer</b> infestation, of inbreds selected for resistance to pink <b>stem</b> <b>borer</b> in hybrid combination. Forty four inbred lines nontested yet for resistant to pink <b>stem</b> <b>borer</b> along with five inbred lines previously reported as resistant to stem and ear attack, were evaluated in 2002 and 2003. In adjacent experiments, hybrids EP 79 × W 552, EP 77 × B 93, and A 661 × EP 42 were tested along with a resistant hybrid, MEB 531 -Bt, and a susceptible hybrid, INRA 260. New sources of resistance to pink <b>stem</b> <b>borer</b> have been detected among inbred lines improving the level of resistance presented by previously tested inbreds. Some of these lines were successfully developed by pedigree selection for resistance to pink <b>stem</b> <b>borer.</b> Research supported by the National Plan of Research and Development of Spain (AGL 2003 - 0961).

40|$|Field and {{greenhouse}} {{experiments were}} conducted to investigate the impact of <b>stem</b> <b>borer</b> injury on the physiology and yield response of irrigated rice. The compensation mechanisms investigated included increased tillering, increased percentage of productive tillers, and increased grain weight. Assimilates were translocated from stem borer-injured tillers to healthy tillers. The photosynthesis rate of green leaves in stem borer-injured tillers increased. The results indicate that all these mechanisms can be employed by rice plants in response to <b>stem</b> <b>borer</b> injury. The implications for rice pest management, including breeding for cultivars tolerant to <b>stem</b> <b>borer</b> injury, nitrogen fertilisation to encourage plant compensation. {{and an increase in}} the economic threshold for <b>stem</b> <b>borers,</b> are discussed.

This is the first report of the control of major rice pests using this specific Bt gene. The cry 2 A gene can now be used {{in combination with other}} insecticidal genes for pyramiding resistance against insect pests. This will delay, or perhaps in combination with integrated pest management practices, prevent evolution of insect populations resistant to single insecticidal genes.

40|$|Stem borers are {{destructive}} pests of rice, attacking {{all stages}} of the rice plant from seedling to matu-rity. In India, <b>yellow</b> <b>stem</b> <b>borer</b> (YSB) caused 1 − 19 % yield loss in early planted rice and 38 − 80 % yield loss in late-planted rice (Catindig and Heong 2003). The use of resistant varieties is one important technique in integrated pest management (Dilawari and Dhaliwal 1993). Although resis-tant cultivars have been devel-oped and planted over large ar-eas, they cannot hold {{the growth of the}} insect population at levels below the economic threshold because of various other stresses during cultivation (Panda and Khush 1995). The important components that form the organic bases for pest management are organic manure, biofertilizers, and soil amendments such as fly ash (Chandramani 2003). Until now, not much attention has been given to studying the impact of using resistant varieties, along with application of nutrients from organic sources, on manag-ing insect pests of rice.

We report for the first time, the cloning and sequence analysis of the amylase gene of this pest. The cloned gene translates into a protein of 487 amino acids having a predicted molecular weight of 54, 955 daltons and a theoretical pI of 5. 9. The 3 D structure of the amylase is predicted from its amino acid sequence by homology modeling using {{the structure of the}} amylase from Tenebrio molitor L (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae). We also report the purification of a dimeric α-amylase inhibitor from a local variety of wheat MP Sehore that is specific for the amylase of this pest and does not inhibit human salivary amylase or porcine pancreatic amylase. The gene encoding this inhibitor has been cloned and its sequence has been analysed to find a possible explanation for this specificity...|$|E

40|$|Busseola fusca (Fuller), Sesamia calamistis Hampson, Chilo partellus (Swinhoe) and Chilo orichalcociliellus (Strand) are {{important}} <b>stem</b> <b>borer</b> pests of {{maize and sorghum}} in East Africa. Persistence of these pests in crop fields is blamed on the influx of diaspore populations from the neighbouring natural habitats. In addition to pest species, natural habitats support numerous non-economic <b>stem</b> <b>borer</b> species, some not known to science. However, due to growing human populations and accompanying global change, some of the natural habitats are undergoing rapid changes, a process that may result {{in the evolution of}} "new" pest species. In this study, we investigated <b>stem</b> <b>borer</b> species diversity in four different vegetation mosaics in Kenya, with an aim of establishing the differences in species composition and distributions in both wild and cultivated habitats. We identified 33 <b>stem</b> <b>borer</b> species belonging to 14 different genera in the four families; Noctuidae, Crambidae, Pyralidae and Tortricidae from 37 plant species. In addition to the above <b>stem</b> <b>borer</b> pest species, we found three more species, Busseola segeta Bowden, Pirateolea piscator Fletcher and Eldana saccharina Walker, in the cultivated fields. Together, <b>stem</b> <b>borer</b> pests varied in distribution among vegetation mosaics, suggesting differences in ecological requirement. Despite the variations in distribution patterns, <b>stem</b> <b>borer</b> pests co-existed with non-economic species in the natural habitats, communities that are facing threats due to ongoing habitat changes.
