500|$|Chrono Trigger was scored {{primarily}} by Yasunori Mitsuda, with assistance by veteran Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu. A sound programmer at the time, Mitsuda {{was unhappy with}} his pay and threatened to leave Square {{if he could not}} compose music. Final Fantasy developer Hironobu Sakaguchi, one of the three designers for the upcoming Chrono Trigger, suggested he score the game, remarking, [...] "maybe <b>your</b> <b>salary</b> will go up." [...] Mitsuda reflected, [...] "I wanted to create music that wouldn't fit into any established genre...music of an imaginary world. The game's director, Masato Kato, was my close friend, and so I'd always talk with him about the setting and the scene before going into writing." [...] Mitsuda has said that he was unsure of how to start, saying that he [...] "must've tried to start writing the music 4 times" [...] and that it took [...] "a month and a half" [...] before he knew how to compose the music for Chrono Trigger.|$|E
500|$|Although his {{official}} job title {{was as a}} composer, Mitsuda found himself working more as a sound engineer. Over the next two years, he created sound effects for , Final Fantasy V, The 7th Saga, Secret of Mana, and Romancing SaGa 2. In 1994, realizing {{that he would never}} get a chance to move up to a real composition duty without some drastic action and feeling concerned about his low pay, he gave Square's vice president, Hironobu Sakaguchi, an ultimatum: let him compose, or he would quit. Sakaguchi assigned the young musician to the team working on Chrono Trigger, telling him that [...] "after you finish it, maybe <b>your</b> <b>salary</b> will go up". Mitsuda was assigned as the sole composer for the game, in the end creating 54 tracks for the final release. Mitsuda drove himself to work hard on the score, frequently working until he passed out, and would awake with ideas for songs such as the ending theme for the game. He worked himself so hard that he developed stomach ulcers and had to be hospitalized, which led Uematsu to finish the remaining tracks for him.|$|E

500|$|Chrono Trigger was scored {{primarily}} by Yasunori Mitsuda, with contributions from veteran Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu, and one track composed by Noriko Matsueda. A sound programmer at the time, Mitsuda {{was unhappy with}} his pay and threatened to leave Square {{if he could not}} compose music. Hironobu Sakaguchi suggested he score Chrono Trigger, remarking, [...] "maybe <b>your</b> <b>salary</b> will go up." [...] Mitsuda composed new music and drew on a personal collection of pieces composed over the previous two years. He reflected, [...] "I wanted to create music that wouldn't fit into any established genre... music of an imaginary world. The game's director, Masato Kato, was my close friend, and so I'd always talk with him about the setting and the scene before going into writing." [...] Mitsuda slept in his studio several nights, and attributed certain pieces—such as the game's ending theme, To Far Away Times—to inspiring dreams. He later attributed this song to an idea he was developing before Chrono Trigger, reflecting that the tune was made in dedication to [...] "a certain person with whom [...] wanted to share a generation". He also tried to use leitmotifs of the Chrono Trigger main theme {{to create a sense of}} consistency in the soundtrack. Mitsuda wrote each tune to be around two minutes long before repeating, unusual for Square's games at the time. Mitsuda suffered a hard drive crash that lost around forty in-progress tracks. After Mitsuda contracted stomach ulcers, Uematsu joined the project to compose ten pieces and finish the score. Mitsuda returned to watch the ending with the staff before the game's release, crying upon seeing the finished scene.|$|E
