5000|$|The {{concept of}} <b>youth</b> <b>hostels</b> {{originated}} in Germany in 1909 with Richard Schirrmann {{and it took}} 20 years for the ideas to reach fruition in the United Kingdom. In 1929/30, several groups almost simultaneously formed to investigate establishing <b>youth</b> <b>hostels</b> in the UK. Foremost among these was the Merseyside Centre of the British <b>Youth</b> <b>Hostels</b> Association. On 10 April 1930, representatives of these bodies met and agreed to form the British <b>Youth</b> <b>Hostels</b> Association. [...] Shortly afterwards, it became the <b>Youth</b> <b>Hostels</b> Association (England & Wales), with separate associations for Scotland (Scottish <b>Youth</b> <b>Hostels</b> Association) and Northern Ireland (Hostelling International Northern Ireland). Ever since its inception, it has been known as [...] "YHA", using the abbreviation YHA (E&W) when necessary to distinguish it from other associations.|$|R
