Without {{somebody}} like Nikki Blonsky {{at the heart of}} the movie, it might fall flat, but everybody works at her level of happiness..." [...] Ebert also noted that this film is [...] "a little more innocent than Waters would have made it..." [...] Krishna Shenoi, of the Shenoi Chronicle, called the movie [...] "Shankman's masterpiece," [...] saying that it moved away from his previous works into a different direction, making a light comedy that deals with serious issues maturely. Shenoi also said that the film was everything he wanted Grease to be. Lou Lumenick of The New York Post hailed Hairspray as [...] "The best and most entertaining movie adaptation of a stage musical so far this century— and yes, I’m including the Oscar-winning Chicago," [...] calling it [...] "one of the best-cast movies in recent memory..." [...] New York Daily News critic Jack Matthews called the film [...] "A great big sloppy kiss of entertainment for audiences weary of explosions, CGI effects and sequels, sequels, sequels." [...] The Baltimore Sun review offered Michael Sragow's opinion that [...] "in its entirety, Hairspray has the funny tilt that only a director-choreographer like Shankman can give to a movie," [...] pointing out that Shankman skillfully [...] "puts a new-millennial zing behind exact re-creations of delirious period dances like the Mashed Potato." [...] Dana Stevens from Slate called Hairspray [...] "intermittently tasty, if a little too frantically eager to please." [...] Stevens noted that [...] "Despite its wholesomeness, this version stays remarkably true to the spirit of the original, with one size-60 exception: John Travolta as Edna Turnblad," [...] saying [...] "How you feel about Hairspray will depend entirely on <b>your</b> <b>reaction</b> to this performance..." ...|$|E

During this time, complaints about black workers taking federal construction jobs appear sporadically through the legislation history of both prior bills that anticipated Davis-Bacon, and Davis-Bacon itself. On {{the floor of the}} House of Representatives, Congressman Upshaw said: [...] "You will not think that a southern man is more than human if he smiles over the fact of <b>your</b> <b>reaction</b> to that real problem you are confronted with in any community with a superabundance or large aggregation of negro labor."

2500|$|Operation Citadel, {{the last}} major German {{offensive}} operation in the east, was {{an attempt by the}} German army to regain the initiative. The plans of the operation were known to the Soviet defenders, who spent months building up a defense in depth to sap the strength of the attacking panzer units. The operation violated two of the three tenets for successful tank operations that Guderian had laid out in Achtung – Panzer!, namely that terrain for the operation had to be chosen that was open, and not built up with heavy defenses. Secondly, and more importantly, the strike had to be delivered in a manner that took the defenders by surprise. In light of the obvious heavy defenses the Soviets had been preparing for the attack, the operation was a clear misuse of the Panzerwaffe. The result would be a significant weakening of German panzer forces, forces that Guderian had been trying to rebuild. In a conversation with Hitler on 14 May 1943, Guderian pointed out the futility of the operation, asking, [...] "My Führer, {{why do you want to}} attack in the East at all this year?" [...] Hitler responded, [...] "You are quite right. Whenever I think of this attack my stomach turns over." [...] Guderian concluded, [...] "In that case <b>your</b> <b>reaction</b> to the problem is the correct one. Leave it alone." ...|$|E
