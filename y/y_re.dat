Specifically, we propose an extension of the Taylor series method which significantly improves its accuracy and stability while also increasing its range of applicability. To advance the solution from t (sub n) to t (sub n+ 1), we expand a series about the intermediate point t (sub n+mu) :=t (sub n) + mu h, where h is the stepsize and mu is an arbitrary parameter called an expansion coefficient. We show that, in general, a Taylor series of degree k has exactly k expansion coefficients which raise its order of accuracy. The accuracy is raised by one order if k is odd, and by two orders if k is even. In addition, if k is three or greater, local extrapolation can be used to raise the accuracy two additional orders. We also examine stability for the problem y'= lambda <b>y,</b> <b>Re</b> (lambda) less than 0, and identify several A-stable schemes.

Collision cascades induced by heavy recoil atoms emitted during α-disintegration of radioelements can cause important modifications in the glass structure and thus influence its chemical durability. To simulate these effects, glass samples were irradiated with bismuth ions accelerated to 200 keV using an implanter (integrate dose ≃ 1. 7 × 10 ^ 10 Gy, corresponding to 10 ^ 16 at/cm^ 2). RBS spectrometry performed on glasses after irradiation indicated an accumulation of <b>Y</b> and <b>RE</b> elements in the first 20 nm near the surface. Monoliths were then leached in static bidistilled water (pH ≃ 5. 5) for one month in an autoclave heated at 90 ^∘.

For the cerium containing glass, the oxidation of Ce(III) during leaching was the dominant parameter and few effects linked to irradiation were observed. Concerning LaYSiAlO glass, the presence of bismuth ions implanted beneath the glass, played a more important role in the dissolution process. The likely oxidation of Bi(I) into Bi(III) or Bi(V) during leaching could partly explain the strong increase of the pH that stabilized around pH_f= 10 after a few days (pH_f ≃ 6 for non-irradiated sample). Solution analysis also showed a lower release of <b>Y</b> and <b>RE</b> elements after irradiation, probably because of the low solubility of <b>Y</b> and <b>RE</b> hydroxide around pH= 10.
