500|$|... character's {{chest and}} {{his need to}} feed on the spirits of others to survive, was {{described}} by Obsidian as less all-encompassing than the first game and more personal in nature. [...] Saunders commented [...] "It's an epic story, but it's a very personal one. You awaken {{in a pool of}} your own blood. Your immediate goal is survival. The shard of the Sword of Gith has been ripped from <b>your</b> <b>chest</b> <b>and</b> in its place is a dark hunger, a craving that threatens to consume you. The early part of the game involves determining the source and implications of this craving." [...] Saunders also stated that the story, written by creative lead George Ziets, was [...] "very dark" [...] and that the ending would bring some closure to the story of the Shard-Bearer.|$|E

50|$|Squad/Detail/Platoon/Company etc: Warning {{of further}} {{commands}} to the group, if stood easy {{the response is}} to push your arms down behind your back and let your shoulders lock into place, brace <b>and</b> push <b>your</b> <b>chest</b> out <b>and</b> hold <b>your</b> head up high. If stood at ease, or at attention, no response should occur beyond listening for further words of command.|$|R

You had better bring <b>your</b> <b>chest</b> down <b>and</b> take up your {{quarters}} here. I shall get the cook in on Monday, and I expect we shall all stop on board. Of course when work is over you can always go back home when you are disposed." ...|$|R

60|$|No, no! It is no use {{trying to}} get out of it. They measure you, and bang <b>your</b> <b>chest</b> <b>and</b> your back, they look at your eyes and make you open your mouth to look at your teeth, but anyhow they take you away for three years.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, then, Mat, {{strip to}} <b>your</b> <b>chest,</b> <b>and</b> put your arms in any {{position}} Blyth tells you. Remember, {{you are going to}} be drawn as Hercules; and mind you look as if you were bringing the Erymanthian Boar to King Eurystheus, for the rest of the evening," [...] said young Thorpe, composedly warming himself at the fire.|$|E
6000|$|Now, this {{giving of}} {{strength}} by the air, observe, is mechanical {{as well as}} chemical. You cannot strike a good blow but with <b>your</b> <b>chest</b> full; <b>and,</b> in hand to hand fighting, {{it is not the}} muscle that fails first, it is the breath; the longest-breathed will, on the average, be the victor, --not the strongest. Note how Shakespeare always leans on this. Of Mortimer, in [...] "changing hardiment with great Glendower": ...|$|R
5000|$|The song {{received}} positive reviews. Aupium Global Music {{claimed that}} the song is [...] "definitely not a chill track, but a euphonious jolt you need for work mode... or run-for-your-life one." [...] AusPop opined, [...] "the beats here are perhaps a little less frenetic than those of his works with the trio, but they're dirtier, fiercer and a little darker." [...] Madison Vain of Entertainment Weekly said, [...] "the brooding, expansive song sits heavy on <b>your</b> <b>chest</b> — <b>and</b> the video matches." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1995, Sherry Sylvester of CNN interviewed male Hollywood celebrities {{about the}} use of the term 'himbo' and sexual {{objectification}} of men in entertainment and received a range of reactions. [...] "There's a great word," [...] said actor Keanu Reeves. [...] "I love that. I read that and laughed my head off." [...] Tom Selleck said he was [...] "always flattered to be called a sex symbol" [...] but Sylvester Stallone said he had fought [...] "the stereotype that brawny means brainless" [...] for years. David Charvet of Baywatch noted, [...] "You find yourself doing a show for three years where you are sticking <b>your</b> <b>chest</b> out <b>and</b> <b>your</b> shoulders are back and you're holding in your stomach and you realize that that's so boring after awhile." ...|$|R
6000|$|... '"Yes, no wonder," [...] was my next remark. [...] "Catherine used {{to boast}} that she stood {{between you and}} bodily harm: she meant that certain persons would not hurt you for fear of {{offending}} her. It's well people don't really rise from their grave, or, last night, she might have witnessed a repulsive scene! Are not you bruised, and cut over <b>your</b> <b>chest</b> <b>and</b> shoulders?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now," [...] he said, [...] "strip to the waist, and I will dye your body. I have dyes of two colours here; {{one for the}} skin, and {{the other}} to draw lines on the face, so as to make you look older; and with this I can also imitate tattoo marks on <b>your</b> <b>chest</b> <b>and</b> shoulders. Here is a long knife, such as {{everyone}} wears, and here is the cord.|$|E
6000|$|... "You call {{yourself}} a chief, do you--eh?" [...] he said sternly. [...] "What kind of a chief can you be, to come sneaking about in the dark like this, trying to steal our buffalo-meat! Are you not ashamed of yourself? A pretty chief, truly; you are like the scavenger-beetle, and think of yourself only; you have not {{the heart of a}} chief. Why don't you kill your own beef? You must have a stone in <b>your</b> <b>chest,</b> <b>and</b> no heart at all." ...|$|E

O dear good {{faithful}} tender Joe, I feel the loving tremble of your hand upon my arm, as solemnly this day {{as if it had}} been the rustle of an angel's wing! ...|$|R
50|$|The rule of epoché sets aside any initial {{theories}} {{with regard}} to what {{is presented in the}} meeting between therapist and client. The rule of description implies immediate and specific observations, abstaining from interpretations or explanations, especially those formed from the application of a clinical theory superimposed over the circumstances of experience. The rule of horizontalization avoids any hierarchical assignment of importance such that the data of experience become prioritized and categorized as they are received. A Gestalt therapist using the phenomenological method might say something like, “I notice a slight tension at the corners of your mouth when I say that, and I see you shifting on the couch and folding your arms across <b>your</b> <b>chest</b> … <b>and</b> now I see you rolling your eyes back”. Of course, the therapist may make a clinically relevant evaluation, but when applying the phenomenological method, temporarily suspends the need to express it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I say, gov'nor, {{you really}} are a topper! You really are, you know! I know just {{how you feel about}} the country and the jolly old birds and trees and chasing the bally slugs off the young geraniums and all that sort of thing, but somehow it's never quite hit me the same way. It's the way I'm built, I suppose. I like asphalt streets and crowds and dodging taxis and meeting chappies at the club and popping in at the Empire for half an hour and so forth. And there's {{something}} about having an allowance--I don't know [...] . sort of makes you chuck <b>your</b> <b>chest</b> out <b>and</b> feel you're someone. I don't know how to thank you, gov'nor! You're--you're an absolute sportsman! This is the most priceless bit of work you've ever done. I feel like a two-year-old. I don't know when I've felt so braced. I--I--really, you know, gov'nor, I'm most awfully grateful." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then, if I {{pursue the}} {{excellent}} common-sense {{tactics of the}} lesser sand-eel, which as you doubtless know buries itself tail upwards in the mud on hearing the baying of the eel-hounds and remains in that position till the danger is past, I shall be able to postpone an interview. Should you be questioned as to my whereabouts, inflate <b>your</b> <b>chest</b> <b>and</b> reply in a clear and manly voice that I have gone out, you know not where. May I rely on your benevolent neutrality, Bayliss?" ...|$|E

It is entirely bronchial by the sound. No doubt the mischief is circumscribed at present, but there is always the danger that it may spread, so you have done wisely to come to me. A little judicious treatment will soon set you right. Your waistcoat, please, but not your shirt. Puff out <b>your</b> <b>chest</b> <b>and</b> say ninety-nine in a deep voice." ...|$|E
60|$|There {{you dream}} that an {{elephant}} has suddenly {{sat down on}} <b>your</b> <b>chest,</b> <b>and</b> that the volcano has exploded and thrown you {{down to the bottom}} of the sea—the elephant still sleeping peacefully on your bosom. You wake up and grasp the idea that something terrible really has happened. Your first impression is that the end of the world has come; and then you think that this cannot be, and that it is thieves and murderers, or else fire, and this opinion you express in the usual method. No help comes, however, and all you know is that thousands of people are kicking you, and you are being smothered.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, {{every piece}} of it. Spike broke into <b>your</b> <b>chest</b> this a'ternoon, <b>and</b> made me hold the tools while he was doing it. He found the bag, and {{overhauled}} it--a hundred and seven half, eleven quarter, and one full-grown eagle, was the count. When he had done the job, he put all back ag'in, a'ter giving me the full-grown eagle for my share of the plunder, {{and told me to}} say nothing of what I had seen. I did say nothing, but I did a good bit of work, for, while he was at supper. I confiserated that bag, as they call it--and you will find it there among Miss Rose's clothes, with the full-grown gentleman back in his nest ag'in." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Give me your flask," [...] she responded, without heeding. A {{stinging}} sensation as she bathed {{the edges}} of the cut with the spirit brought him back to common sense again. [...] "There," [...] she said, skillfully extemporizing a bandage from her handkerchief and a compress from his cravat. [...] "Now, button your coat over <b>your</b> <b>chest,</b> so, <b>and</b> don't take cold." [...] She insisted upon buttoning it for him; greater even than the feminine delight in a man's strength is the ministration to his weakness. Yet, when this was finished, she drew a little away from him in some embarrassment--an embarrassment she wondered at, as his skin was finer, his touch gentler, his clothes cleaner, and--not to put too fine a point upon it--he exhaled an atmosphere much sweeter than belonged to most of the men her boyish habits had brought her in contact with--not excepting her own father. Later she even exempted her mother from the possession of this divine effluence. After a moment she asked, suddenly, [...] "What {{are you going to do}} with Hornsby?" ...|$|R

Eh? I see the fear of death in your eyes. You beat the air with your arms. You exert all your puny strength to struggle to live. Your hand is clutching my arm, lightly it feels as a butterfly resting there. <b>Your</b> <b>chest</b> is heaving, <b>your</b> tongue protruding, your skin turning dark, your eyes swimming. ‘To live!

This life only you are certain is real. Ah, it is growing dark and darker. It is the darkness of death, the ceasing to be, the ceasing to feel, the ceasing to move, that is gathering about you, descending upon you, rising around you. Your eyes are becoming set. They are glazing. My voice sounds faint and far. You cannot see my face. And still you struggle in my grip. You kick with your legs. Your body draws itself up in knots like a snake’s. <b>Your</b> <b>chest</b> heaves <b>and</b> strains. To live! To live! To live—” ...|$|R

A flash, a roar--a mad reeling of the senses, and crimson clouds flitting before your eyes--a horrible pain in your ears, a sense of oppression on <b>your</b> <b>chest,</b> <b>and</b> the knowledge that you are not on your feet--a whispering of voices blending with the concert in your ears--a darkness before your eyes--and you feel yourself plump up against the padding, whither you have been thrown by the violence of the concussion.|$|E

It won't do to give way for a minute. If necessary you must take tonics, and have a steel rod down your back, if you can't keep yourself erect without it. You must have your legs padded, <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>chest</b> thrown out; <b>and</b> you must stand up very strong and sturdy, Freddy, and not let them push you an inch this way or that.

2500|$|In {{another popular}} story, the 19th-century monk named Ter Karapet Hovhanesi-Hovakimyan, from a monastery near the village, {{conducted}} burial services at Noraduz; {{in order to}} avoid the two-hour round trip from the cemetery to the monastery he built himself a small cell in Noraduz. When he was 90 years old, he asked his brother monks to bury him alive. His last words were: [...] "I do not fear death. I would like you to not be afraid also. Never fear anything, but God alone. Let anyone who has fear come to me. Pour water at the burial stone, drink the water, wash <b>your</b> face, <b>chest,</b> arms <b>and</b> legs. Then break the vessel that contained the water. Fear will then abandon you." [...] To this day people come to the monk's grave to perform this ritual, leaving broken pieces of glass scattered all about.|$|R

5000|$|In 1841, {{she moved}} to the {{regional}} capital city of Stettin (now Szczecin, Poland), and sought to study composition with Carl Loewe, a central figure of the musical life of the city. Author Marie Silling, writes concerning this: [...] "The death of her father caused her first deep sorrow; in order to numb this pain, she buried herself in work. She went to Szczecin and became Loewe‘s student. After a challenging test he said in his crafty manner: [...] "You actually know nothing and everything at the same time! I shall be the gardener who helps the talent that is still a bud resting within <b>your</b> <b>chest</b> to unfold <b>and</b> become the most beautiful flower!" [...] Emilie always considered it important to be thrifty in her own life but was continually giving to the needs of others. When, for these reasons, she asked Löwe whether she could share the composition lessons with other female pupils, he answered: [...] "such a God-given talent as hers had not been bestowed upon any other person he knew." [...] This statement filled her with the greatest thankfulness throughout her whole life and obliged her to work extremely hard." ...|$|R
