500|$|Although Nancy Churnin of the Dallas Morning News {{considered}} the film inferior {{to those of}} Pixar and DreamWorks, she still gave it a B and wrote, [...] "it's got an upstart charm, a clever premise, appealing characters voiced by a terrific cast and a script that should make <b>you</b> <b>laugh</b> out loud more than once." ...|$|E
500|$|Six {{years after}} {{cancellation}} of Police Squad!, the film [...] returned Nielsen to {{his role as}} Frank Drebin. It involved a ruthless drug king trying hypnosis to assassinate Queen Elizabeth II. Nielsen did many of his own stunts: [...] "You {{have an idea of}} how you're going to do something, and it's your vision... unless you do it, it really doesn't stand a chance." [...] This movie grossed over $78million and was well received by critics. Ebert's 3½–star review (out of four) noted, [...] "You laugh, and then <b>you</b> <b>laugh</b> at yourself for laughing." ...|$|E

500|$|Schur {{said his}} {{favorite}} {{scene in the}} episode was when Leslie arrives at her secret meet-up spot with Ben, only to find Ron waiting there, and awkwardly tries to insist there is no affair. Schur said: [...] "The scene that unfolds is my favorite Leslie Knope moment of the whole year. [...] almost doesn't say a word for the entire scene, but still makes <b>you</b> <b>laugh</b> 50 times." [...] Immediately after [...] "Li'l Sebastian" [...] first aired, a [...] "Producer's Cut" [...] version was made available on the official NBC.com website, which included an additional six minutes of material.|$|E
500|$|For the film's {{positive}} response, Kevin Carr {{stated that}} [...] "When you dig down and actually find (and watch) the new Muppet material, {{some of the}} magic is still there." [...] MaryAnn Johanson of Flick Filosopher said that, [...] "It's not {{on a par with}} the Muppet movie madness of old, but it's darn close." [...] According to the Bums Corner's review the film was a [...] "treat for all ages, and that it was a colorful, musical, humorous romp." [...] Keith Allen of Movie Rapture gave the film 2.5 stars out of 3, explaining that the film's humor was surprisingly clever, and that the film would frequently make <b>you</b> <b>laugh.</b> Mutant Reviewers commented that although the Muppet deal with Walt Disney was [...] "disappointing", the film managed to be funny and witty.|$|E
500|$|Francis {{characterized}} Genevieve as [...] "harsh", attesting {{this quality}} to her past tragedy. In {{an interview with}} AOL, Francis said that, [...] "Although tragic things have happened to her, she is not tragic." [...] Michael Fairman of On-Air On-Soaps described Genevieve as an [...] "eerie bitch". Jamey Giddens of Zap2it described her as [...] "kooky" [...] and [...] "The Pervy-Odd Mob Mama". The soap opera's official website describes her relationship with Colin Atkinson (Tristan Rogers) as [...] "twisted" [...] and [...] "confusing". Genevieve was considerably [...] "darker" [...] than the role of Laura Spencer on General Hospital, which Francis loved. She said, [...] "It's so freeing to let your dark side shine {{for a minute and}} when you do a scene when you've been really evil, when the scene ends, <b>you</b> <b>laugh.</b> It's just fun." ...|$|E

500|$|Rajeev Masand {{also gave}} the film a {{positive}} review, calling it [...] "a barrel of non-stop laughs": [...] "It puts the fun {{back into the}} movies. <b>You</b> <b>laugh</b> harder than you have in a long time. It’s a film with a one-point agenda – to entertain you while you’re in your seat. It achieves that, no two ways about it." [...] Sudhish Kamath of The Hindu noted [...] that Dostana [...] "largely reflects a society in transition and begins to address the issues of acceptance within the Indian framework of marriage": [...] "Dostana is great mass entertainment manipulating the inherent homophobia of a country {{on the threshold of}} change, but what’s significant is that it will bring parents and children together to share laughs over alternative sexuality and related issues that will no longer remain in the closet." ...|$|E
500|$|Welsh singer Paul Child {{conducted}} {{an interview with}} Desmond Child in Nashville in April 2013 to discuss his work with Bonnie Tyler, both with [...] "Believe in Me" [...] and in the beginnings when he wrote her hit single [...] "If You Were a Woman" [...] in the 1980s. Paul Child drew similarities between the lyrical and rhythmic structure of [...] "Believe in Me" [...] and the Labelle song [...] "Lady Marmalade", specifically with the lines [...] "Voulez-vous coucher avec moi (ce soir)?" [...] and [...] " [...] and <b>you</b> <b>laugh</b> {{at the thought of}} putting your faith in stuff, like love". Desmond stated that they (Child, Christy and Braide) wanted to write a song that would [...] "uplift the world, and we're so thrilled that Bonnie sang it and that it got chosen to represent the UK." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the course}} of his review of [...] "La Couchette", Stevens {{suggested}} that Inside No. 9 is something of an acquired taste. He noted, though, that [...] "even if they don’t make <b>you</b> <b>laugh,</b> you have to concede this duo are the most febrilely inventive writers on TV." [...] Wollaston, who reviewed the episode for The Guardian, observed that humour generally is extremely personal, and said that he [...] "never really got Shearsmith and Pemberton's stuff". He said he could appreciate the narrative and artistry of [...] "La Couchette", and could understand why others found it funny, but that he does not love Inside No. 9, and that, when watching, he is [...] "just not laughing". A viewer unimpressed with the episode wrote to The Times. Disagreeing with Billen's review, the reader claimed that the episode's [...] "puerile humour [...] flatulent as its one-dimensional figures".|$|E

500|$|Contrary to the {{positive}} reviews, Anjum N., writing for Rediff, said that despite an extraordinary cast and a big budget, [...] "Karan Johar disappoints." [...] He praised Amitabh and Jaya Bachchan's performance and noted Hrithik Roshan for holding his own against the veteran actors. However, in summary he called the film [...] "a bad remix of Mohabbatein and Kuch Kuch Hota Hai". Writing for The Hindu, Ziya Salam praised Kajol's performance and Karan's ability to [...] "keep the viewer occupied". She commented, [...] "Watch Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... {{not because of the}} hype which preceded its release but because in these meagre times not many have come up with better fare. The film at least partially redeems the hope surrounding it. Again, just like its name. Some joy, some disappointment." [...] Namarata Joshi of Outlook gave a mixed review and said that while the film [...] "makes <b>you</b> <b>laugh</b> and cry alternately", the shenanigans were nevertheless [...] "fake and affected" [...] and [...] "monochromatic despite the profusion of colours".|$|E
500|$|Humor {{plays an}} {{important}} role in No One Lives Forever. As Hubbard explained, the game's intention is [...] "to make <b>you</b> <b>laugh,</b> but not at the expense of providing a broader, more satisfying emotional experience than a spoof generally allows, so that even if you don't chuckle once, you can still have plenty of fun playing the game. At heart, NOLF is an action/adventure/espionage game with a healthy dose of levity." [...] Humor is presented mainly via visual gags, overheard conversations, textual intelligence items, and cutscenes. The humor includes [...] "situational humor, and even a dash of absurdity and bathroom humor for good measure. Some of it is subtle, some of it isn't." [...] The name of UNITY, H.A.R.M., and other fictional organizations mentioned in the game follow the spy genre formula of using contrived acronyms for organizations (see List of fictional espionage organizations). What H.A.R.M. actually stands for is never revealed, and speculation about its true meaning is used as a running gag in the game and its sequel.|$|E
500|$|The {{relationship}} between Chris and Ann {{was described by}} Sundermann as [...] "one {{of the most interesting}} parts of the show and the reason, specifically, is Chris". Likewise, Porter said Lowe and Rashida Jones had developed a [...] "fantastic dynamic". Joel Keller of TV Squad said he found Chris [...] "a little two-dimensional", and believed the relationship was poorly handled because it made Ann too passive. Lowe received particularly strong praise for his role in [...] "Flu Season", in which Chris became extremely ill and hallucinatory when infected with the flu. Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter said Lowe's character seemed well-integrated into the cast by the episode [...] "Flu Season", and added [...] "If you've never believed Lowe can make <b>you</b> <b>laugh</b> out loud, pay attention to that episode." [...] Steve Kandell said Lowe stole the show from the usual Parks powerhouses of Nick Offerman and Chris Pratt, and called one scene, when Lowe tries to will away his flu by yelling to himself in the mirror [...] "Stop...pooping!", the [...] "single greatest self-effacingly comic moment of his long, handsome career".|$|E

500|$|Two songs, [...] "I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair" [...] and [...] "Honey Bun" [...] are {{intended}} to imitate American popular songs of the 1940s. [...] In the former, the triple recitation of the song title at intervals suggests a big band arrangement of the wartime era, while in the bridge, the final eight bars (repeating the lyrics from the bridge's first eight bars) gives a suggestion of swing. [...] The sections beginning [...] "If the man don't understand you" [...] and [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>laugh</b> at different comics" [...] have a blues style. [...] Lovensheimer deems the song [...] "Nellie's spontaneous and improvisatory expression of her feelings through the vocabulary of popular song". Mordden suggests that [...] "I'm in Love with a Wonderful Guy" [...] with its [...] "take no prisoners bounce", might well {{be the center of}} the score, with the typical American girl defending her love by spouting clichés, many of which, such as [...] "corny as Kansas in August" [...] Hammerstein made up, and [...] "sure enough, over the years they have become clichés".|$|E
500|$|... "Flu Season" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews, {{with many}} commentators praising {{the performance of}} Rob Lowe, whose character is usually physically fit to almost superhuman proportions but becomes extremely ill and hallucinatory when infected with the flu. Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter said Lowe's character now seemed well-integrated into the cast, adding [...] "If you've never believed Lowe can make <b>you</b> <b>laugh</b> out loud, pay attention to that episode." [...] Steve Kandell of New York magazine said Lowe stole the show from the usual Parks powerhouses of Offerman and Pratt, and called one scene, when Lowe tries to will away his flu by yelling to {{himself in the mirror}} [...] "Stop...pooping!", the [...] "single greatest self-effacingly comic moment of his long, handsome career". The Atlantic writer Scott Meslow said after two episodes, the pairing of Chris and Ann was already more interesting that Ann's entire relationship with Mark Brendanawicz in the second season, and that the new romance subplot allowed the normally [...] "" [...] Rashida Jones to display her comedic talents. Entertainment Weekly writer Hillary Busis said Chris [...] "really came into his own" [...] in the episode, and also said that Ann's relationship with Chris made her character more interesting and gave Jones greater comedic material to work with.|$|E
500|$|Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama {{gave the}} film a four-out-of-five rating {{and called it}} a madcap comedy which dared to [...] "push the {{envelope}} in its own way": [...] "Dostana is a winner all the way. In terms of content, it might just {{prove to be a}} trendsetter." [...] The Times of India also rated it four out of five: [...] "It introduces the most outrageous scenes in popular Hindi cinema and manages {{to get away with it}} because it's all done with an infectious zest and effervescence that keeps the ribs tickling." [...] Pratim D. Gupta of The Telegraph rated the film 7.2 out of 10, writing that Dostana [...] "can make <b>you</b> <b>laugh</b> out loud and also strike an emotional chord." [...] Raam Tarat of Future Movies rated the film 3.5 out of 5, praising its performances ("The lead actors share a great chemistry, are easy on the eye and oh so charming that they, along with beautiful Miami make for a visual treat") and calling it [...] "a great, fun entertainer with lots of charm and great music." [...] For Hindustan Times, film critic Khalid Mohamed gave Dostana a three-out-of-five rating: [...] "Good taste, pop colour Miami locations, high-end costumes, make-up styling and the A-grade Dharma Productions values add up to a zingy entertainer".|$|E

500|$|Remarking on the band's {{goals for}} the [...] "Paranoid Android" [...] music video, Yorke said that, [...] "When {{it came time to}} make the video for that song, we had lots of people saying, 'Yeah, great, we can have another video like [...] "Street Spirit", all moody and black and dark. Well, no. We had really good fun doing this song, so the video should make <b>you</b> <b>laugh.</b> I mean, it should be sick, too." [...] Magnus Carlsson, Swedish creator of the {{animated}} series Robin, was commissioned by the band to make the video. Radiohead were fans of the show, and connected with the Robin character; Jonny Greenwood described him as [...] "affectionate" [...] and [...] "vulnerable", while Yorke admitted that he found Robin [...] "quite the vulnerable character, but he's also violently cynical and quite tough and would always get up again." [...] At first Carlsson sought to work on a video for [...] "No Surprises" [...] and was uncertain as to how to approach [...] "Paranoid Android". Eventually he devised a scenario to the band's liking after he locked himself in his office for over 12 hours to stare out of the window, while listening to the song on repeat while jotting down visual ideas. As Carlsson did not have access to the lyrics at the time, the concept for the video was based entirely on the song's sound. According to Yorke, the band [...] "deliberately didn't send Magnus the lyrics" [...] because they [...] "didn't want [...] to be too literal." ...|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} of the album was positive overall. Robin Denselow of The Guardian awarded the album four of five stars and wrote that Wainwright's performance sounded as [...] "easy-going and spontaneous" [...] and it does at his live concerts. Denselow considered [...] "House" [...] to be the album's best track. The Daily Telegraph Colin Irwin described the album as [...] "oddly uplifting" [...] despite its [...] "variants on the theme that we're all doomed" [...] from the economic crisis. The Observer contributor Neil Spencer wrote that [...] "while [...] tone becomes shrill at times, his mix of nihilism and jauntiness (with ukulele) are finally uplifting." [...] Music journalist Andy Gill of The Independent recommended the tracks [...] "House", [...] "Fear Itself [...] " [...] and [...] "The Panic Is On". Simmy Richman's review for The Independent complimented Wainwright's ability to address current issues [...] "simply and effectively", claiming [...] "Wainwright can make <b>you</b> <b>laugh,</b> nod in agreement, shake your fist in despair and want to sing along". Richman appreciated Wainwright's honesty and humor and wrote that he displayed [...] "better lyrical form than {{he has been in}} for some time". The Independent included 10 Songs on their [...] "Indy Choice: Best of the New Music" [...] list for the week of July 16, 2010. PopMatters' Alex Ramon preferred Wainwright's album Social Studies (1999), but considered 10 Songs to be [...] "an enjoyable effort nonetheless", complimenting it for its simple approach. Furthermore, Ramon wrote that the album [...] "succeeds in getting you smiling rather than despairing at the mess we're in, and that's always been one of Wainwright's great gifts".|$|E
500|$|Although officially retired, Grimaldi still {{received}} half of {{his former}} small salary from Drury Lane until 1824. [...] Soon after the fee stopped, Grimaldi fell into poverty {{after a number of}} ill-conceived business ventures and because he had entrusted management of his provincial earnings to people who cheated him. Despite his disabilities, he offered his services as a cameo performer in Christmas pantomimes. [...] Along with Bologna, he re-appeared briefly at Sadler's Wells where he gave some acting instruction to the mime artist William Payne, the future father of the Payne Brothers. [...] He also started working for Richard Brinsley Peake, namesake of Richard Brinsley Sheridan, who was the dramaturge at the English Opera House. Peake hired Grimaldi to star in Monkey Island alongside his son JS. However, Grimaldi's health deteriorated further and he was forced to quit before the show opened; his scene was cut. [...] The early end to his career, worries about money, and the uncertainty over his son's future made him increasingly depressed. To make light of it, he would often joke about his condition: [...] "I make <b>you</b> <b>laugh</b> at night but am Grim-all-day". In 1828, two [...] "farewell" [...] benefit performances were held for him. [...] In the first, he appeared as Hock the German soldier and a drunken sailor in Thomas Dibdin's melodrama The Sixes; or, The Fiends at Sadler's Wells to an audience of 2,000 people. Unable to stand for long periods of time, he sang a duet with JS and finished the evening with a scene from Mother Goose. His last farewell benefit performance on 27 June 1828 was at Drury Lane. Between 1828 and 1836, Grimaldi relied on charity benefits to replace his lost income.|$|E
