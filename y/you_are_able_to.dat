25|$|In the United States, {{the most}} common places you will find women’s surfing would be California and Hawaii {{because they have the}} best {{conditions}} for surfing. Although <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> surf in any place that has waves, surfing is mostly found all across the world from Peru, Australia, Indonesia, South Africa, France, Philippines, Ecuador, and anywhere else that has a shore and waves coming in. Although surfing can be found anywhere, {{there are a lot of}} things that affect the waves. Tide, time of day, storms miles off shore, and weather can all affect the strength of the waves.|$|E
500|$|The album's {{title is}} derived from a dream Cox had in which he saw a group of protesters, {{one of whom was}} holding up a sign reading [...] "Let the blind lead those who can see but cannot feel". [...] Upon waking, Cox wrote down the phrase on a {{notebook}} beside his bed. [...] He described the concept to Out magazine as being [...] "like <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> see, but you might not know the right direction to go in. But somebody who can’t see might—just by instinct—lead you that way." [...] The arrangement of the tracks on Let the Blind Lead is chronological, presented in the order in which they were recorded.|$|E

500|$|Phillip Atwell {{directed}} the music video on December 10–11, 2002. Almost all the film footage {{was used in}} the video except for a scene where 50 Cent raps in a glass box. The video is set in a fictional hip hop boot camp known as the Shady/Aftermath Artist Development Center. It begins with a black Hummer driving to the facility at an unknown location. Video clips from Eminem's single [...] "Without Me" [...] are seen playing in the entrance on flat screen TVs. We see Eminem & Dr. Dre looking down at the lab from a lab balcony with windows. 50 Cent is introduced by hanging upside down from the roof of a gym. Atwell commented, [...] "I think I could have done better with it, but I really liked the way that it turned out". The video also contains a shooting range, which Atwell felt was appropriate because 50 Cent had been shot nine times. He said, [...] "creatively, I felt like we were able to put guns in a video and have it play. And I like it when <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> play within the standards and still give the artist something symbolic of what they are going for." ...|$|E

For example you cannot put a Y registration number on a T registered vehicle but you could choose any prefix range from an A to a T.

That person is so close to you that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> share some things only with him. For example, you can call that friend, and from the very first maniacal laugh or some other joke you will know who is {{at the other end of}} that line. We used to do that with him so often. And then when that person is gone, there will be nothing like that in your life ever again." ...|$|E
2500|$|Continuous {{conveyor}} belt fragmentation measurements in the comminution plant {{can provide an}} instantaneous tool for process control. [...] When planning the integration of fragmentation measurement instrumentation, position your camera monitoring station in a location where you can effect a process control change based upon the particle size information you receive. [...] For example, the primary crusher product is a good location to measure, since <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> control the size that the crusher is producing with slight adjustments to the crusher ensuring that the downstream comminution circuit is receiving a consistent product to help reduce variability in the process. [...] In addition to the continuous particle size analysis, the database of belt material size {{can be used for}} simulations and for further process analysis to help increase process efficiency and throughput.|$|E

2500|$|In Plato one {{experienced}} unit is a state, or object existing, {{which can}} be observed. The time parameter is set at [...] "ever"; that is, the state is to be presumed present between observations. Change is to be deduced by comparing observations and is thus presumed a function that happens to objects already in being, rather than something ontologically essential to them (such that something that does not change cannot exist) as in Heraclitus. In Plato, {{no matter how many}} of those experienced units <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> tally, you cannot get through the mysterious gap between them to account for the change that must be occurring there. This limitation is considered a fundamental limitation of reality by Plato and in part underpins his differentiation between imperfect experience from more perfect Forms. The fact that this is no limitation for Heraclitus motivates Plato's condemnation.|$|E
2500|$|This {{interest}} in education continued into her opera career. For many years, Blackwell {{participated in a}} program called the [...] "Affiliate Artists" [...] where {{she went into the}} community and talked to people one-on-one to educate them about and inspire {{interest in}} opera. Blackwell says, [...] "We don't have audience participation anymore, partly because of being raised on television. We have become an audience that receives entertainment in a passive way. I think in order to participate you have to have knowledge and knowledge means {{you have to take the}} time to sit down and educate. When <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> communicate with people and show them you're just another human being with a gift, it makes all the difference. My gift happens to be singing. When you go to an opera you see so many people, but you don't have an opportunity to have that one-on-one contact and that's what was so great about that program." ...|$|E
2500|$|President of FIFA Sepp Blatter {{endorsed}} {{the idea of}} having a World Cup in the Middle East, saying in April 2010, [...] "The Arabic world deserves a World Cup. They have 22 countries and have not had any opportunity to organise the tournament." [...] Blatter also praised Qatar's progress, [...] "When I was first in Qatar there were 400,000 people here and now there are 1.6 million. In terms of infrastructure, when <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> organise the Asian Games (in 2006) with more than 30 events for men and women, then that is not in question." [...] Qatar's bid to host the 2022 World Cup received a huge boost on 28 July 2010 when Asian Football Confederation (AFC) President Mohammed Bin Hammam threw his weight behind his country's campaign. Speaking in Singapore, Bin Hammam said: [...] "I have one vote and, frankly speaking, I will vote for Qatar but if Qatar is not in the running I will vote for another Asian country." [...] Qatar has already hosted the AFC Asian Cup in 1988, FIFA U-20 World Cup 1995 and the 2011 AFC Asian Cup.|$|E

2500|$|... "And {{when these}} men heard that Belisarius {{was coming and}} was not far away, they {{wrote a letter to}} him which ran as follows: [...] "Once more Chosroes, as you {{yourself}} doubtless know, has taken the field against the Romans, bringing a much greater army than formerly; and where he is purposing to go is not yet evident, except indeed that we hear he is very near, and that he has injured no place, but is always moving ahead. But come to us as quickly as possible, if indeed <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> escape detection by the army of the enemy, in order that you yourself may be safe for the emperor, and that you may join us in guarding Hierapolis." [...] Such was the message of the letter. But Belisarius, not approving the advice given, came to the place called Europum, which is on the River Euphrates. From there he sent about in all directions and began to gather his army, and there he established his camp; and the officers in Hierapolis he answered with the following words: [...] "If, now, Chosroes is proceeding against any other peoples, and not against subjects of the Romans, this plan of yours is well considered and insures the greatest possible degree of safety; for it is great folly for those who have the opportunity of remaining quiet and being rid of trouble to enter into any unnecessary danger; but if, immediately after departing from here, this barbarian is going to fall upon some other territory of the Emperor Justinian, and that an exceptionally good one, but without any guard of soldiers, be assured that to perish valorously is better in every way than to be saved without a fight. For this would justly be called not salvation but treason. But come as quickly as possible to Europum, where, after collecting the whole army, I hope to deal with the enemy as God permits." [...] And when the officers saw this message, they took courage, and leaving there Justus with some few men in order to guard Hierapolis, all the others {{with the rest of the}} army came to Europum." ...|$|E
