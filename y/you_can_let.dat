[...] After working with The Smeezingtons on Unorthodox Jukebox, Jeff Bhasker admitted that [...] "One of their great talents is that they have this fun, light vibe in the studio", something that enables anyone [...] "to be free so that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>let</b> that primal emotion come out without being embarrassed. Then they polish afterward". Mark Ronson concurred adding that the key is on Mars' charisma, which he has had since he began impersonating Elvis. Ronson concluded, [...] "Everything Bruno adds is what takes it into superstardom".|$|E
2500|$|Rob Reiner {{said in a}} 2014 {{interview}} about his on- and off-screen chemistry with O'Connor, [...] "We did over 200 shows {{in front of a}} live audience. So I learned a lot about what audiences like, what they don't like, how stories are structured. I would {{spend a lot of time}} in the writing room and I actually wrote some scripts. And from Carroll O'Connor I learned a lot about how you perform and how important the script and story are for the actors. So the actor doesn't have to push things. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>let</b> the story and the dialogue support you if it's good. I had great people around me and I took from all the people who were around." [...] He also stated, when he compared Carroll O'Connor's character to his acting mentor's real-life persona: [...] "Carroll O'Connor brought his humanity to the character even though he had these abhorrent views. He's still a feeling, human being. He loved his wife even though he acted the way he did, and he loved his daughter. Those things come out. I don't think anybody's all good or all bad." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "We shall {{neither of}} us get on by complaining;--shall we, Mr. Finn? <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>let</b> me have an answer perhaps by this time to-morrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mightily {{obliged to}} you! But <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>let</b> up now there's no more swimming. I couldn't run very far, {{if it was}} worth while trying to." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Well, {{there we}} are at service number two,” said I. “I {{want to tell you}} our yarn, and see if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>let</b> a little {{daylight}} in.” ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Any mode of attack's {{legitimate}} in {{this kind}} of deal, and there's a rather effective one your friends don't seem to have tried yet. Quite sure it wouldn't be wiser to make what terms <b>you</b> <b>can</b> and <b>let</b> them have the mine?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know, I know," [...] Cecil {{answered}} irritably. [...] "The {{place has}} been allowed to go on anyhow while I was away. Do what <b>you</b> <b>can,</b> and <b>let</b> them know outside that they must make room for one, or perhaps two automobiles...." ...|$|R
6000|$|The Master of Ravenswood {{held the}} paper in his hand, and seemed irresolute.

6000|$|... "Suppose {{you think}} it over, Gregory, and see what <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do. <b>Let</b> us meet here again to-morrow at the same time, {{and then we will}} enter into it again; and I will bring you some of my old books to show you that what I say is correct." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{hope you}} will be very happy. In the mean time try to save dear Mrs. Sterling all <b>you</b> <b>can,</b> and <b>let</b> her make you worthy a good husband," [...] was Christie's answer to a speech she was too noble to resent by a sharp word, or even a contemptuous look.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of that I know nothing. But my {{interest}} about your brother has been because of her. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> explain all this about your brother if <b>you</b> please, or <b>can</b> <b>let</b> it alone.
