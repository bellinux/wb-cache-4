25|$|Saboteur (1942) is {{the first}} of two films that Hitchcock made for Universal during the decade. Hitchcock was forced to use Universal {{contract}} player Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane (a freelancer who signed a one-picture deal with Universal), both known for their work in comedies and light dramas. Breaking with Hollywood conventions of the time, Hitchcock did extensive location filming, especially in New York City, and depicted a confrontation between a suspected saboteur (Cummings) and a real saboteur (Norman Lloyd) atop the Statue of Liberty. That year, he also directed Have <b>You</b> <b>Heard?,</b> a photographic dramatisation of the dangers of rumours during wartime, for Life magazine.|$|E
25|$|Adams was {{appointed}} as West Indies captain in 2000, replacing Brian Lara. He would not last long, leading {{the team to}} a 5–0 series loss on the 2000/01 tour of Australia; after the tour he lost both the captaincy (to Carl Hooper) and {{his place in the}} national team. News of his impending termination was broken to Adams by friend and national TV reporter, Peter Furst. The ever-cool Jamaican simply responded, ¨Have <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> something I haven't?¨ He then reflected on his career, saying that whatever happened it had all been a blessing – both the good and bad. Adams´ grace {{in the face of what}} would crush many a lesser person reflects the nature of the man; a cricketer whose best attributes can never be recorded on the score sheets.|$|E
25|$|Making {{his name}} as a hard bop player, he {{appeared}} regularly at the Marquee Club from August 1960, and recorded his first solo album {{at the age of}} 21, It’s Morrissey, Man! (1961) for Fontana, featuring Stan Jones on piano, Colin Barnes on drums, and The Jazz Couriers founding member Malcolm Cecil on bass. He spent most of 1962 in Calcutta, India as part of the Ashley Kozak Quartet, playing three 2-hour sessions seven days a week, before returning to the UK and forming his quartet with Harry South – who had also been in the quartet in Calcutta – on piano. They were joined by former The Jazz Couriers bassist Phil Bates and variously, another ex-The Jazz Couriers member, Bill Eyden, Jackie Dougan or Phil Seamen on drums. The Dick Morrissey Quartet recorded three LPs, Have <b>You</b> <b>Heard?</b> (1963); the live recording Storm Warning! (1965) on Mercury; and Here and Now and Sounding Good! (1966). The quartet, played regular London gigs at The Bull's Head, Barnes and at Ronnie Scott's, whose manager, Pete King, once said that Ronnie's was kept going in those days due to the crowds Dick Morrissey pulled in. During this time he also played extensively in bands led by Ian Hamer and Harry South, including The Six Sounds, featuring Ken Wray and Dick Morrissey, a band which by 1966 had developed into the Ian Hamer Sextet featuring South, Dick Morrissey, Keith Christie, Kenny Napper and Bill Eyden, among other leading UK-based jazz musicians.|$|E

25|$|They {{deprive the}} sinner of his life; I shall truly {{tell you how}} this is done. The wicked (punishers) remind by (similar) {{punishment}} (their victims) of all sins they had committed in a former life. Being killed they are thrown into a hell which is full of boiling filth. There they stay eating filth, and they are eaten by vermin. And there is an always crowded, hot place, which men deserve for their great sins, and which is full of misery. (The punishers) put them in shackles, beat their bodies, and torment them (by perforating) their skulls with drills. They cut off the sinner's nose with a razor, they cut off both his ears and lips; they pull out his tongue a span's length and torment (him by piercing it) with sharp pikes. There the sinners dripping (with blood) whine day and night even as the dry leaves of a palm-tree (agitated by the wind). Their blood, matter, and flesh are dropping off while they are roasted, their bodies being besmeared with natron. Have <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> of the large, erected caldron of more than man's size, full of blood and matter, which is extremely heated by a fresh fire, in which blood and matter are boiling? The sinners are thrown into it and boiled there, while they utter horrid cries of 'Agony; they are made to drink molten lead and copper when they are thirsty, and they shriek still more horribly. Those evildoers who have here forfeited their souls' (happiness) {{for the sake of}} small (pleasures), and have been born in the lowest births during hundred thousands of million years will stay in this (hell). Their punishment will be adequate to their deeds. The wicked who have committed crimes will atone for them, deprived of all pleasant and lovely objects, by dwelling in the stinking crowded hell, a scene of pain, which is full of flesh.|$|E

500|$|Stockhausen, {{along with}} John Cage, {{is one of}} the few avant-garde composers to have succeeded in {{penetrating}} the popular consciousness ( [...] ; [...] ). The Beatles included his face on the cover of Sgt.

In particular, [...] "A Day in the Life" [...] (1967) and [...] "Revolution 9" [...] (1968) were influenced by Stockhausen's electronic music ( [...] ; [...] ). Stockhausen's name, and the perceived strangeness and supposed unlistenability of his music, was even a punchline in cartoons, as documented on a page on the official Stockhausen web site (...)

500|$|On {{the morning}} of April 18, Gage ordered a mounted patrol of about 20 men {{under the command of}} Major Mitchell of the 5th Regiment of Foot into the {{surrounding}} country to intercept messengers who might be out on horseback. [...] This patrol behaved differently from patrols sent out from Boston in the past, staying out after dark and asking travelers about the location of Samuel Adams and John Hancock. This had the unintended effect of alarming many residents and increasing their preparedness. [...] The Lexington militia in particular began to muster early that evening, hours before receiving any word from Boston. [...] A well-known story alleges that after nightfall one farmer, Josiah Nelson, mistook the British patrol for the colonists and asked them, [...] "Have <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> anything about when the regulars are coming out?" [...] upon which he was slashed on his scalp with a sword. However, the story of this incident was not published until over a century later, which suggests that it may be little more than a family myth.|$|E
