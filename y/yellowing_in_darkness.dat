50|$|The ferro-gallate is coated onto a {{paper from}} aqueous {{solution}} and dried. The coating is <b>yellow.</b> <b>In</b> <b>darkness,</b> it is stable {{for up to}} three days. It is clamped under glass and a light transmitting document in a daylight exposure frame which is similar to a picture frame. The frame is put out into daylight requiring a minute or two under a bright sun or about ten times this under an overcast sky. Where ultra-violet light is transmitted the coating converts to a stable blue or black dye. The image can be seen forming. When a strong image is seen the frame is brought indoors and the unconverted coating, under the original image, is washed away. The paper is then dried.|$|R

5000|$|Drow {{characters}} are extremely intelligent, charismatic and dexterous, but share surface elves' comparative frailty and slight frames. Females {{tend to be}} bigger and stronger than males. Drow are characterized by white or silver hair and obsidian black skin. Their eyes are red (or rarely gray, violet, or <b>yellow)</b> <b>in</b> <b>darkness</b> and can be many different colors in normal light. Drow have several kinds of innate spell powers and spell resistance. This is balanced by their weakness in daylight. Also, drow weapons and armor (usually made of adamantite or another metal unique to the Underdark) slowly lose their magical properties if exposed to the sun. In Advanced Dungeons & Dragons second edition, adamantite disintegrates upon exposure to sunlight unless specifically treated. Drow also employ the unusual hand crossbow, firing small, though very lethal, darts. Half-drow {{are the result of}} crossbreeding between another race and a drow, and share characteristics of both. (The term [...] "half-drow" [...] usually refers to one who is half drow and half human.) Half-drow are also generally evil; however, half-drow of differing alignments are more common than non-evil full drow.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. The exotic zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, is {{established}} {{in all of}} the Laurentian Great Lakes and may affect benthivorous fishes by increasing the complexity of benthic substrates and changing energy flow patterns within the food web. Native yellow perch, Perca flavescens, and the nonindigenous Eurasian ruffe, Gymnocephalus cernuus, are benthivores that may compete for limited food resources. As ruffe spread to areas with more dense zebra mussel populations, the zone of interaction among zebra mussels, yellow perch, and ruffe will increase and intensify. In the laboratory, the effect of zebra mussel shells on the ability of these fishes to forage on amphipods (Gammarus pseudolimnaeus) and chironomids (Chironomus plumosus) was examined <b>in</b> light and <b>darkness.</b> <b>In</b> 12 h, ruffe consumed more amphipods than did similar-sized <b>yellow</b> perch, particularly <b>in</b> <b>darkness</b> on bare cobble, and in light within zebra mussels. Amphipods decreased activity more in the presence of ruffe than yellow perch. More amphipods were found in zebra mussel shells than in bare cobble, whether or not fish were present. <b>In</b> <b>darkness,</b> when ruffe consumed more amphipods on bare cobble, amphipods became more associated with zebra mussel shells. Although ruffe consumed more amphipods than yellow perch, perch consumed more chironomids than ruffe on bare cobble. The presence of zebra mussel shells altered the relative consumption of invertebrates in some substrate-light combinations. Experiments such as these help to improve understanding of the direct and indirect effects of predation between and among native and nonindigenous species that may exert structuring forces on the nearshore communities of the Great Lakes currently or in the future.

40|$|Using an {{open and}} a closed system of gas analysis, {{it was found that}} CO 2 {{evolution}} in light and <b>in</b> <b>darkness</b> from plant leaves (sunflower, soybean, watermelon, eggplant, and jackbean) have a different response to temperature. While the rate of CO 2 evolution in light increased with increasing temperature from 17 to 35 ° and then declined, the rate of CO 2 evolution <b>in</b> <b>darkness</b> increased continuously up to 40 °. The rate of CO 2 evolution in light was affected by light intensity. At 1800 ft-c and below 35 ° the rate of CO 2 evolution in light was greater than <b>in</b> <b>darkness,</b> but above 35 ° it became lower than <b>in</b> <b>darkness.</b> The Q 10 for CO 2 evolution in light was consistently lower than that <b>in</b> <b>darkness...</b>|$|R
50|$|Photograph {{stability}} refers {{the ability}} of prints and film to remain visibly unchanged over periods of time. Different photographic processes yield varying degrees of stability. In addition, different materials may have dark-storage stability which differs from their stability in light (An extreme case with slides, was stability under the intense light of projection). For example, when stored <b>in</b> <b>darkness,</b> Kodachrome's long-term stability under suitable conditions is superior to other types of color film. Images on Kodachrome slides over fifty years old retain accurate color and density. Kodachrome film stored <b>in</b> <b>darkness</b> is largely responsible for excellent color footage of World War II, for example. It has been calculated that the <b>yellow</b> dye <b>in</b> Kodachrome, the least stable, would suffer a 20% loss of dye in 185 years. This is because developed Kodachrome does not retain unused color couplers.|$|R
40|$|Synaptic inputs to on-off {{ganglion}} {{cells in}} mudpuppy retina were studied by measuring current-voltage relations <b>in</b> <b>darkness,</b> during different {{phases of the}} response to light, and {{in the presence of}} 4 mM-Co 2 +. The addition of Co 2 + to the bathing medium usually caused a hyperpolarization of the membrane potential <b>in</b> <b>darkness</b> and an increase in input resistance, indicating that on-off ganglion cells receive tonic excitatory synaptic input <b>in</b> <b>darkness.</b> Other results suggest that an additional synaptic input, with a reversal potential near the dark potential, may also be active <b>in</b> <b>darkness.</b> At the onset of a light stimulus in the receptive field centre all on-off ganglion cells responded with transient excitatory and inhibitory synaptic events, both of which were due to increases in conductance. Similar transient excitatory and inhibitory events occurred at the termination of the light stimulus. In about one-half of the on-off ganglion cells studied the synaptic activity during steady illumination was the same as <b>in</b> <b>darkness.</b> <b>In</b> the remaining cells steady illumination caused an increase in sustained inhibition...|$|R

40|$|Oscillatoria terebriformis, a {{thermophilic}} cyanobacterium, maintained viability <b>in</b> <b>darkness</b> under {{anaerobic conditions}} by fermenting exogenous glucose or fructose to lactic acid.

The endogenous aerobic respiration rate was high, and the limited dark aerobic survival period appeared to be due to depletion of stored glycogen.
