25|$|One of {{the things}} the movie does best is {{transport}} you back in time and into nature. In the early scenes as Joel leaves his aunt's home to travel across the South by rickety bus and horse and carriage, <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> strangeness, wonder and anxiety of a child abandoning everything that's familiar to go to a place so remote he has to ask directions along the way. The landscape over which he travels is so rich and fertile that you can almost smell the earth and sky. Later on, when Joel tussles with Idabell (Aubrey Dollar), a tomboyish neighbor who becomes his best friend (a character inspired by the author Harper Lee), the movie has a special force and clarity in its evocation of the physical immediacy of being a child playing outdoors.|$|E

500|$|Nala's {{role and}} {{demeanor}} during the film's romantic [...] "Can <b>You</b> <b>Feel</b> <b>the</b> Love Tonight" [...] sequence has drawn criticism {{in regards to}} her [...] "submissive behaviour".

Joel W. Martin wrote in the Journal of Religion and Film, [...] "One song later, [...] have fallen in love. Playing one day, they literally tumble down a hillside in the jungle, and he ends {{up on top of}} her. This time, she does not bear her teeth, but instead, shows 'bedroom eyes'". Martin ultimately accused the scene's [...] "reversal of positions" [...] of [...] "establish male dominance." [...] Criticizing the film for [...] "being merely distracting when it could have been both meaningful and instructive", Robert Humanick of Slant Magazine wrote, [...] "Small potatoes, then, when Simba's former childhood friend and betrothed queen Nala ... unexpectedly reappears in his duty-free, protein-rich life, demanding he return to his kingly responsibilities and coaxing the lion to sleep tonight with arguably the most blatant 'fuck me now' face to ever appear in a PG-rated film." ...|$|E

500|$|... "The Madness of King Scar" [...] is one {{of three}} {{original}} songs that Elton John and Tim Rice had added for the musical adaptation of Disney's 1994 animated film The Lion King. John had composed the music while Rice wrote the lyrics; the title is a reference to the 1994 film The Madness of King George.

500|$|The film's entire {{recording}} process took {{approximately three}} years to complete, during which Kelly's sessions were held in both the United States and Canada, while her co-stars Broderick and Jeremy Irons, voice of Scar, were recording in the United States and England, respectively. Each main cast member recorded their dialogue separately, which took Kelly some time {{to get used to}} because she had grown accustomed to working with several other actors at a time on the sets of live-action films. For The Lion King, a director would often take the place of another actor for Kelly to act opposite of. Vocally, Kelly decided to approach the role as though she were reading to a child, explaining, [...] "it's kind of fun to play with different voices and try to color the lines for the child so they can imagine it more fully", which she admitted is different than how the actress would approach a live-action role. Because Nala is a [...] "very straight character", determining what kind of voice she would use for her was not a particularly challenging task. Additionally, the filmmakers would also film Kelly's performances in order to incorporate her own facial expressions into her character's design, the process of which impressed the actress. In her film debut, actress Niketa Calame voices young Nala. According to Calame's official website, Nala remains the actress' [...] "biggest role to date". A classically trained pianist and chorister, Laura Williams provides the singing voice of young Nala, which can be heard in the song [...] "I Just Can't Wait to Be King"; the singer was 15 years old at the time. Meanwhile, singer-songwriter Sally Dworsky provides the singing voice of adult Nala, which is heard during the song [...] "Can <b>You</b> <b>Feel</b> <b>the</b> Love Tonight". The film's love theme, [...] "Can <b>You</b> <b>Feel</b> <b>the</b> Love Tonight"'s lyrics were re-written approximately 15 times, according to lyricist Tim Rice, who wrote the song alongside composer Elton John. At one point, the producers wanted the song to be a comical duet performed by supporting characters Timon and Pumbaa, despite the fact that John had originally composed the song with Nala and Simba in mind. However, John lobbied in favor of [...] "Can <b>You</b> <b>Feel</b> <b>the</b> Love Tonight" [...] being a love song performed as a duet by Nala and Simba, with which the filmmakers ultimately agreed.|$|E

500|$|Nala is {{the most}} {{significant}} female character in The Lion King. As the film was inspired by William Shakespeare's tragedy Hamlet, Nala is considered to be The Lion Kings equivalent of Hamlet's love interest Ophelia, although differences remain between the two characters. Many early concepts first developed for Nala were eventually abandoned, including a brother and father for the character, as well as her being romantically pursued by Scar. While critical reception towards Nala has been generally mixed – both film and feminist critics complained about the character's lack of involvement in the story and supposedly submissive demeanor during the song [...] "Can <b>You</b> <b>Feel</b> <b>the</b> Love Tonight" [...] – Kelly's vocal performance has been praised.|$|E

500|$|The second verse of {{the song}} adds accompaniment from {{acoustic}} guitar and tambourine.

[...] At {{the end of each}} bridge, McCartney sings a brief phrase ("Na-na-na na …"), supported by an electric guitar fill, before playing a piano fill that leads to the next verse. According to Riley, this vocal phrase serves to [...] "reorient the harmony for the verse as the piano figure turns upside down into a vocal aside". Additional musical details, such as tambourine on the third verse and subtle harmonies accompanying the lead vocal, are added to sustain interest throughout the four-verse, two-bridge song.|$|E

[...] ReelReviews.net's James Berardinelli, an X-Men comic book fan, believed, [...] "the film is effectively paced with a good balance of exposition, character development, and special effects-enhanced action. Neither the plot nor the character relationships are difficult to follow, and the movie avoids the trap of spending too much time explaining things that don't need to be explained. X-Men fandom is likely to be divided over whether the picture is a success or a failure".
