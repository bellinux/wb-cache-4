Finally, it is important that the expert witness realizes that replying “I don’t know” to a question is perfectly fine; it is preferable to say that you don’t have the expertise in that particular area than to claim that <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> make yourself look like a liar. Before leaving the witness stand, proper notification will be given to the expert witness to see if he is dismissed or if he will be recalled later.|$|E

[...] Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, during a discussion about terrorism, torture and the law, took offense at a Canadian judge's remark that Canada, [...] "thankfully", did not consider what Jack Bauer would do when setting policy. He reportedly responded with a defense of Bauer, arguing that law enforcement officials deserve latitude in times of great crisis, and that no jury would convict Bauer in those types of situations.|$|E

In The New York Times, Stanley Kauffmann wrote: [...] "Miss Lansbury is a singing-dancing actress, not {{a singer}} or dancer who also acts... In this marathon role she has wit, poise, warmth {{and a very}} taking [...]" [...] The role resulted in Lansbury receiving her first Tony Award for Best Leading Actress in a Musical. Lansbury's later biographer Margaret Bonanno claimed that Mame made Lansbury a [...] "superstar", with the actress herself commenting on her success by stating that [...] "Everyone loves you, everyone loves the success, and enjoys {{it as much as}} <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> <b>And</b> it lasts {{as long as you are}} on that stage and as long as you keep coming out of that stage door." ...|$|E

500|$|In July 2008, Neighbours was branded [...] "too white" [...] {{by black}} and Asian viewers in Britain. A {{report found that}} many ethnic viewers felt they were {{under-represented}} in some of Britain's most popular television shows. In Australia {{there was talk of}} a 'White Australia policy' when it came to casting actors for top-rated soaps. In response to the criticism, executive producer Susan Bower made the decision to add more ethnically diverse extras, small walk on roles and speaking parts. She also decided to introduce 15-year-old Korean actor Hany Lee into the cast as exchange student, Sunny Lee. Bower said [...] "I know we're going to get flak about this gorgeous little Korean girl who's going to be coming in next year, because you're damned if <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> damned if you don't".|$|E
500|$|Israeli actress Hadas Yaron, then aged 20, {{was cast}} {{for the role}} of Shira, the protagonist of the film. She commented that her {{character}} [...] "is much more naïve at 18 than I was when I was 18, and there was something so special about that and it was like going back to the basics". Yaron was unfamiliar with Orthodox practice prior to participating in Fill the Void. In order to become better acquainted with Shira's lifestyle, she started memorizing all of the Hebrew blessings, saying, [...] "There's something so beautiful about it because you're being so grateful all the time for everything <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> hoping that everything works out okay and I started doing those blessings every day and it sounds silly but it helps you feel that you are closer to the character." ...|$|E

[...] Ament said that [...] "Pilate" [...] concerned a question he was asking himself, dealing with a recurring dream Ament had with being old sitting with his dog on the porch, while [...] "Low Light" [...] was the answer, and that it deals with [...] "a kind of gratefulness at finding that place of calm and peace at my center and getting a glimpse of the person I could choose to be." ...|$|E

I thought I was clear... and I tried going down slowly, and Jimmie just must have been there a little bit, turned me sideways and got me on the apron—scared everybody half to death, including me." [...] Stewart, who finished second, said, [...] "I actually had fun racing at Daytona again, which I haven't had for a while. I don't know what the consensus is from everybody else, but I had more fun as a driver tonight than what we've had in the past."

500|$|Ono studied piano {{from the}} age of 4 to 12 or 13. She {{attended}} kabuki performances with her mother, who was trained in shamisen, koto, otsuzumi, kotsuzumi, nagauta, and could read Japanese musical scores. At 14 Yoko took up vocal training in lieder-singing. At Sarah Lawrence, she studied poetry with Alastair Reid, English literature with Kathryn Mansell, and music composition with the Viennese-trained André Singer. Of this time Ono has said that her heroes were the twelve-tone composers Arnold Schoenberg and Alban Berg. She said, [...] "I was just fascinated with what they could do. I wrote some twelve-tone songs, then my music went into [...] area that my teacher felt was really a bit off track, and..... he said, 'Well, look, {{there are people who are}} doing things like what <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> they're called avant-garde.'" [...] Singer introduced her to the work of Edgar Varèse, John Cage, and Henry Cowell. She left college and moved to New York in 1957, supporting herself through secretarial work and lessons in the traditional Japanese arts at the Japan Society.|$|E
500|$|Molyneux {{said that}} might have been [...] "insanely ambitious" [...] with regard to the {{standards}} they set themselves for the graphics, because the system requirements were high and much of the custom software needed to be written. One such program was a terrain-editing tool named Leadhead. He stated that they went from [...] "bizarre ideas", to [...] "the best game I have ever seen". The villagers' artificial intelligence had to be restricted by giving some control to the Village Centre as there was no limit on the number of villagers. Molyneux said of the creature's artificial intelligence, [...] "part of the game itself learns from everything <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> tailors itself to you", and described the creature as [...] "an astonishing piece of work". He also commented that the last months of development were [...] "the hardest any of us has ever had to work", and that [...] "without the right team, this game never would have happened." [...] The models for the trees, bushes, and other landscape features were created in 3D Studio Max, and initial graphics development was done in 2D using Adobe Photoshop. Later development was done using other custom software. Clan multiplayer, where multiple players play as one god, was developed in a rush; its interface had to be developed in two weeks. Black & Whites online community was handled by two servers in London, where the clan creatures were stored to minimise the possibility of cheating.|$|E

500|$|Sawyer and Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) {{were the}} least-liked {{characters}} by viewers {{during the first}} few episodes, because, according to Lindelof, [...] "they were just really obnoxious, bad guys". In later episodes, however, Sawyer and Jin changed to be more likable. Towards the beginning of [...] "Confidence Man", Sawyer is seen reading the novel Watership Down by Richard Adams (this is the book that caused Boone to think that Sawyer took Shannon's inhaler). The novel has numerous similarities to Lost, including [...] "letting go", and building a society. Furthermore, the protagonists of Watership Down are rabbits – a recurring motif in Lost. The episode ends with a montage of various characters performing different activities, featuring the song [...] "I Shall Not Walk Alone", written by Ben Harper and performed by The Blind Boys of Alabama. One lyric from the song is, [...] "I just reach for mother Mary"; Sawyer's mother's name is Mary, and, according to reviewer Therese Odell from the Houston Chronicle, the lyric may be alluding to this. Also, percussionist Ryan McKinnie of The Blind Boys of Alabama said of many members of the group's blindness, [...] "Our disability doesn’t have to be a handicap. It's not about what you can't do. It's about what <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> <b>And</b> what we do is sing good gospel music." [...] This quotation is very similar to the oft-repeated quotation by many characters (especially Locke), [...] "Don't tell me what I can't do." ...|$|E
500|$|James Cromwell {{was cast}} as Zefram Cochrane, {{the pilot and}} creator of Earth's first warp capable vessel. The {{character}} of Zefram Cochrane had {{first appeared in the}} Original Series episode [...] "", played by Glenn Corbett. Cromwell's Cochrane is much older and has no real resemblance to Corbett, which did not bother the writers. They wanted to portray Cochrane as a character going through a major transition; he starts out as a cynical, selfish drunk who is changed by the characters he meets {{over the course of the}} film. Although the character was written with Cromwell in mind, Tom Hanks, a fan of Star Trek, was approached for the role by Paramount first, but he had already committed to the film That Thing <b>You</b> <b>Do!</b> <b>and</b> had to reject the part. Frakes commented that it would have been a mistake to cast Hanks as Cochrane due to him being so well known. Cromwell had a long previous association with Star Trek, having played characters in The Next Generation episodes [...] "" [...] and [...] "", as well as a role in [...] [...] " [...] actually came in and read for the part", Frakes said. [...] "He nailed it." [...] Cromwell described his method of portraying Cochrane as always playing himself. Part of the actor's interest in the film was his involvement in Steven M. Greer's Center for the Study of Extraterrestrial Intelligence, which offers training for first contact scenarios. In this film, Cromwell's Cochrane became the first character to use the phrase [...] "star trek" [...] in the history of the franchise ("You're all astronauts, on some kind of star trek.") ...|$|E
500|$|Either/Or portrays two life views. Each life view {{is written}} and {{represented}} by a fictional pseudonymous author, with the prose of the work reflecting and depending on the life view being discussed. For example, the aesthetic life view is written in short essay form, with poetic imagery and allusions, discussing aesthetic topics such as music, seduction, drama, and beauty. The ethical life view is written as two long letters, with a more argumentative and restrained prose, discussing moral responsibility, critical reflection, and marriage. The views of the book are not neatly summarized, but are expressed as lived experiences embodied by the pseudonymous authors. The book's central concern is the primal question asked by Aristotle, [...] "How should we live?" [...] His book was certainly informed by Epictetus; [...] "Consider first, man, what the matter is, and what your own nature is able to bear. If you would be a wrestler, consider your shoulders, your back, your thighs; for different persons are made for different things. Do {{you think that you}} can act as <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> be a philosopher, that you can eat, drink, be angry, be discontented, as you are now? You must watch, you must labor, you must get the better of certain appetites, must quit your acquaintances, be despised by your servant, be laughed at by those you meet; come off worse than others in everything—in offices, in honors, before tribunals. When you have fully considered all these things, approach, if you please—that is, if, by parting with them, you have a mind to purchase serenity, freedom, and tranquillity. If not, do not come hither; do not, like children, be now a philosopher, then a publican, then an orator, and then one of Caesar’s officers. These things are not consistent. You must be one man, either good or bad. You must cultivate either your own reason or else externals; apply yourself either to things within or without you—that is, be either a philosopher or one of the mob."
