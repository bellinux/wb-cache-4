2500|$|On January 6, 2014, John Petrucci {{said that}} Dream Theater were already [...] "planting seeds for album No. 13". He commented: [...] "There are some song ideas and {{little things like}} that -- nothing really official, but the seeds just start to get planted. One {{of the great things}} about this career is that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> every time to go in and start again with a blank slate and think, 'What can we do differently? How can we make this better? Where can we go from here?' Every album has a story, and to {{constantly}} have a fresh opportunity to do it is really satisfying." ...|$|E
2500|$|Willem Dafoe as [...] "He": Dafoe, who had {{previously}} worked with Lars von Trier in Manderlay from 2005, was cast after contacting Trier and asking what {{he was working on}} at the moment. He received the script for Antichrist, although he was told that Trier's wife was skeptical about asking a renowned actor like Dafoe to do such an extreme role. Dafoe accepted the part, later explaining its appeal to him: [...] "I think the dark stuff, the unspoken stuff is more potent for an actor. It's the stuff we don't talk about, so if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> to apply yourself to that stuff in a playful, creative way, yes I'm attracted to it." [...] The voice of the talking fox was also supplied by Dafoe, although the recording was heavily manipulated.|$|E
2500|$|On August 13, 2014, Seth M. Sherwood was {{announced}} {{to write the}} film, under the title Leatherface. On October 31, 2014, Julien Maury and Alexandre Bustillo were hired to direct the film, who admired its distinction in narrative from the series' previous installments: [...] "When we first received the script, of course it's not everyday that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> to see Leatherface {{on the front page}} and we were very surprised, in a good way, that the script was taking a different path, and it's quite original." [...] Producer Whedon elucidated that the directors were chosen because their [...] "perfect vision" [...] and their [...] "edge to their storytelling". Upon signing on to the project, Maury and Bustillo requested rewrites, in which Sherwood gave his support. The general plot structure remained the same, though the directors wanted the screenplay to match their vision. Nearly every death sequence was altered and the ending, originally a mass murder involving Leatherface killing at least thirty people with his chainsaw, was changed, [...] "It was really over the top and even if we like blood and gore, we were like, no, that’s not the character, we cannot do that." [...] In March and April 2015, Sam Strike, James Bloor, Stephen Dorff, and Jessica Madsen joined the cast, respectively. On May 5, 2015, Lili Taylor was publicised to replace Angela Bettis, who dropped out due to a scheduling conflict. The following day, Vanessa Grasse joined the cast to play Lizzy.|$|E

6000|$|The Marquess {{sent for}} Coningsby {{the morning after}} his arrival {{and asked him to}} breakfast with him in his private rooms. Nothing could be more kind or more {{agreeable}} than his grandfather. He appeared to be interested in his grandson's progress, was glad to find Coningsby had distinguished himself at Eton, solemnly adjured him not to neglect his French. A classical education, he said, was a very admirable thing, and one which all gentlemen should enjoy; but Coningsby would find some day that there were two educations, one which his position required, and another which was demanded by the world. 'French, my dear Harry,' he continued, 'is the key to this second education. In a couple of years or so you will enter the world; it is a different thing to what you read about. It is a masquerade; a motley, sparkling multitude, in which you may mark all forms and colours, and listen to all sentiments and opinions; but where all you see and hear has only one object, plunder. When you get into this crowd you will find that Greek and Latin are not so much diffused as you imagine. I was glad to hear you speaking French yesterday. Study your accent. There are a good many foreigners here with whom you may try your wing a little; don't talk to any of them too much. Be very careful of intimacies. All the people here are good acquaintance; at least pretty well. Now, here,' said the Marquess, taking up a letter and then throwing it on the table again, 'now here is a man whom I should like you to know, Sidonia. He will be here in a few days. Lay yourself out for him if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity.</b> He is a man of rare capacity, and enormously rich. No one knows the world like Sidonia. I never met his equal; and 'tis so pleasant to talk with one that can want nothing of you.' ...|$|E

"My dear sister," [...] {{the bishop}} said, {{and this time}} his voice was soft and persuasive, [...] "we have all our trials; life is no rosy path, but is paved with the sharp stones of duty; but yet we must all tread it as unflinchingly as we may, looking for {{strength}} where only it can be found. To you has been confided a great and important mission. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> of doing great things for the Holy Church. You have that great and glorious object in view, and you are, moreover, filled with the pious hope of saving a lost soul, and that the soul of your erring brother. It is a task which the angels themselves might be glad to perform. To the Church is given all power here, to bind and to loose, and, for your sakes, I have promised you that your brother's errors shall be passed over. Prayers are offered up {{that he may be}} forgiven; and when the time comes, rest assured that at least no testimony shall be made against him; and that if the Church cannot bless, it will at least not curse the mistaken one. Every allowance has been and will be made for his youth at the time he forsook the right path, and the strong influences brought to bear upon him; his life has been, as you have testified in your letters, save as to this grievous falling off, an exemplary one; and I trust that, when at last stricken with illness, he will turn back as a wandering sheep to the fold. These, my sisters, are the inducements--a lost soul to be saved, the Church to be strengthened. Not often are such inducements offered. But," [...] and here he raised and hardened his voice, [...] "it is not by inducements only that the Church acts, but by orders and threatenings. Upon you a certain burden has been placed, hard to bear, perhaps, but not beyond your strength. From this task you must not shrink; your private wishes are as nothing in the balance. You have a duty, and would fain escape it to pass your life in the way it would please you in a convent; you would say, to serve God there, but He will not be so served; He has given you another sphere, other tasks. The convent is for those who see no path of active usefulness traced out for them--not for such as you. Who can tell what may yet occur? I at first acceded to your request, and allowed you to retire from the world, until your nephew's death clearly indicated that Providence had not destined the property of the Church to pass from the apostate father to the heretic son. Then your path of duty was clear; and although at present the future looks dark, although your brother is obstinate in his recusancy, and although he may talk of leaving his property to others, yet the case is by no means hopeless. He may repent and turn; this girl whom he has adopted may displease him; he may die without a will. These and many other contingencies may arise, but until his death your task cannot be ended." ...|$|E
