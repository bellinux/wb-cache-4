25|$|The true reason, then, why Hegelism {{can give}} {{no reason for}} the Time-process, i.e. {{for the fact that}} the world is 'in time,' and changes continuously, is that it was {{constructed}} to give an account of the world irrespective of time and change. If you insist on having a system of eternal and immutable 'truth,' <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> only by abstracting from those characteristics of reality, which we try to express by the terms individuality, time, and change. But you must pay the price for a formula that will enable you to make assertions that hold good far beyond the limits of your experience. And it is part of the price that you will in the end be unable to give a rational explanation of those very characteristics, which you dismissed at the outset as irrelevant to a rational explanation.|$|E

Trent Fitzgerald of PopCrush noted that the lyrics are about Brown trying to [...] "convince a hot girl he spots in the club {{to come back to}} his crib", in which he sings [...] "Hey girl tell me what you talk / Pretty as a picture on the wall / Hey girl <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> all / Cause I know you like the way the beat go". Brown also declares, [...] "You heard about my image / But I could give a flying motherfuck who's offended".

Hazel Robinson of California Literary Review magazine noted that the word [...] "bassline" [...] is a metaphor for penis.|$|E
500|$|The {{controversial}} single [...] "Welcome to the Terrordome" [...] references {{the murder}} of Yusef Hawkins and the 1989 riots in Virginia Beach, and it has Chuck D criticizing Jewish leaders who protested Public Enemy in response to Professor Griff's anti-Semitic remarks. He addresses the controversy as being {{in the center of}} political turmoil, with criticisms of the media and references to the Crucifixion of Jesus: [...] "Crucifixion ain't no fiction / So called chosen frozen / Apology made to who ever pleases / Still they got me like Jesus". He is also critical of Blacks and those who [...] "blame somebody else when you destroy yourself": [...] "Every brother ain't a brother / 'cause a Black hand squeezed on Malcolm X the man / the shootin of Huey Newton / from the hand of Nig who pulled the trigger". His lyricism features dizzying raps and internal rhyme: [...] "Lazer, anastasia, maze ya / Ways to blaze your brain and train ya [...] Sad to say I got sold down the river / Still some quiver when I deliver / Never to say I never knew or had a clue / Word was heard, plus hard on the boulevard / Lies, scandalizin', basin' / Traits of hate who's celebratin' wit Satan?". Its dense production incorporates numerous samples, including several James Brown tracks and the guitar line from The Temptations' [...] "Psychedelic Shack". Several other samples are heard amid Chuck D's rapping, such as the line [...] "come on, you can get it-get it-get it" [...] from Instant Funk's [...] "I Got My Mind Made Up (<b>You</b> <b>Can</b> <b>Get</b> <b>It</b> Girl)". AllMusic's John Bush cites the track as [...] "the production peak of the Bomb Squad and one of Chuck D.'s best rapping performances ever ... one of their tracks were more musically incendiary".|$|E
500|$|Clarkson co-wrote {{the seventh}} track, [...] "Where Is Your Heart", with DioGuardi and Chantal Kreviazuk. She {{revealed}} {{that it was}} also about her boyfriend, Hodges, whom she described as [...] "wanting to get really into our relationship, and I just thought, 'Where are you in our relationship?'" [...] "Walk Away", the eight track, was also written by the three, with additional writing by Raine Maida. Clarkson described it as [...] "one of the brighter songs" [...] on Breakaway, and said that [...] "It's very blunt and to the point. 'I'm done with you, you're upsetting me.'" [...] DioGuardi and Shanks co-wrote the ninth track, [...] "You Found Me". Clarkson revealed, [...] "When I recorded this one, I was actually in a good place with a guy. It was very fitting {{at the time that}} I recorded it." [...] DioGuardi had also co-written the tenth track, [...] "I Hate Myself for Losing You", with Jimmy Harry and Shep Solomon. Clarkson described the song as [...] "depressing", but felt it {{could be used as a}} foreshadowing device. She explained [...] "I read something that Sting said in an interview, he talked about how the great thing about writing is that it is an emotional and therapeutic thing and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> out." [...] The eleventh track, [...] "Hear Me", was written by Clarkson, DioGuardi, and Clif Magness. Clarkson explained the song, [...] "It's is almost like a prayer to God. I haven't met the person whom I will spend the rest of my life with, but the song is a prayer to God about that. That's what the song is. 'God, I'm ready for 'the one!'" [...] The twelfth and closing track is a live recording of [...] "Beautiful Disaster", originally from Thankful. Clarkson admitted that she hated Thankfuls version of the song, and thought the production was distracting from the lyrics. So she decided to record a piano ballad version instead.|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Party" [...] {{features}} Beyoncé as {{the female}} protagonist [...] "in {{the mood for}} some loving" [...] as she references to a get-together for two persons. West rhymes about [...] "swag sauce" [...] and [...] "swagu" [...] in the introductory lines, [...] "You a bad girl, your friends bad too / You got the swag sauce, you're drippin' Swagu", before passing the torch to Beyoncé, who begins to sing the first verse slowly and steadily, [...] "I may be young but I'm ready / To give you all my love / I told my girls <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> / Don't slow it down, {{just let it go}} / So in love / I'll give it all away / Just don't tell nobody tomorrow". In the chorus lines, she harmonizes over the sample from [...] "La Di Da Di", [...] "Cause tonight's the night that I give you everything / Music knocking until the morning light / 'Cause we like to party". In the second verse, Beyoncé belts out [...] "in a thick stack of smooth, layered vocals". After chanting the chorus for a second time, André 3000 surfaces around the 2:15 mark with [...] "some very naughty references" [...] to milk on the verses he raps, [...] "... another homeboy, that nigga named Cheese / Fuck wit' me baby, I make it milk 'til it drip down yo' knees", before switching gears altogether and getting philosophical about his own career, [...] "Kiddo say he looks up to me, this just makes me feel old / Never thought that we could become someone else's hero / Man, we were just in the food court eating our gyros", and finally adopting a [...] "multi-syllabic tongue twister" [...] to rap some of the finishing lines. The song runs out with Beyoncé reiterating the lines, [...] "Cause we like to party, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey", and West then [...] reprises the opening lines.|$|E

2500|$|Vol. 2 was {{the first}} film to be shot with an 8K {{resolution}} camera, the Red Weapon 8K. Gunn had wanted to use a different camera than the Alexa 65 {{that had been used}} for several other Marvel films, because he found it to be a [...] "very big and heavy camera". He wanted a camera that could deliver equivalent image quality to the Alexa 65, and tested multiple options. He eventually met with Red, whom he had a positive experience with working on The Legend of Tarzan, and they introduced him to an early prototype for the Weapon 8K. He, Gunn, and Marvel decided to use the camera in September 2015, when only that single prototype existed, and spent months working with Red to get the camera ready for filming. For the sequence where Rocket and Yondu escape from the Ravagers, a Phantom Camera was used to film scenes up to 2000 frames per second, with the footage able to be moved from slow-motion to high-speed within a single shot. Each shot using the camera had to be carefully set up and choreographed. Additional scenes were also shot in IMAX and its aspect ratio. Braham filmed almost 85 percent of the film using a stabilizing technology he had contributed to called Stabileye, which he called [...] "a handheld dolly" [...] which allowed [...] "a spontaneity to the way the camera moves that is different and that felt appropriate for this movie." [...] For filming the cockpits of spaceships, Braham surrounded the practical sets with video panels and other light sources that he could use to create realistic lighting no matter the environment outside the ship. Exteriors of the ships were filmed with the camera on a technocrane, but any shots inside the cockpits again used the Stabileye which is [...] "so small that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> in there next to the actors".|$|E
