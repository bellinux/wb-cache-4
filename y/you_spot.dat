5000|$|In [...] "Truly," [...] Daniel Handler {{explains}} the game Adverbs: [...] "Someone is It {{and leaves the}} room and everyone else decides on an adverb. It returns and forces people to act out things {{in the manner of}} the word, which is another name for the game. People argue violently, or make coffee quickly, and there's always a time when the alcohol takes over and people suggest hornily and we all must watch as It makes two people writhe on the floor, supposedly dancing or eating or driving a car, until finally It guesses the adverb everyone's thinking of. It's a charade, although it's not much like Charades. You play until you get bored." [...] Handler's explanation of Adverbs leads to a discussion of the identity of characters across chapters: [...] "Nobody keeps score, because there's no sense in keeping track of what everyone is doing. You might as well trace birds through a book, or follow a total stranger <b>you</b> <b>spot</b> outside the window of your cab, or follow the cocktails spilling themselves from the pages of vintage cocktail encyclopedias to leave stains through this book, or follow the pop songs that stick in people's heads or follow the people themselves, although you're likely to confuse them, as so many people in this book have the same names. You can't follow all the Joes, or all the Davids and Andreas.
