25|$|Are <b>you</b> <b>aware</b> that Claude Pepper {{is known}} all over Washington as a shameless extrovert? Not only that, {{but this man}} is {{reliably}} reported to practice nepotism with his sister-in-law, he has a brother who is a known homo sapiens, {{and he has a}} sister who was once a thespian in wicked New York. Worst of all, it is an established fact that Mr. Pepper, before his marriage, habitually practiced celibacy.|$|E
500|$|Reeves dislikes remakes, but was {{impressed}} by the script, which he deemed a reimagining. He enjoyed the original film as a child and became fonder of it as an adult when he understood how relevant it was, but prefers this version because it lacked the contradictory message of Klaatu [...] "laying down the law [...] almost as though the alien had the bigger stick." [...] Reeves acknowledged his Klaatu is [...] "inverted" [...] from the original, starting [...] "sinister and tough" [...] but becoming [...] "more human," [...] whereas the original was [...] "more human than human" [...] before revealing his [...] "big stick" [...] in his ending speech. He compared the remake's Klaatu to the wrathful God who floods the world in the Old Testament, but is gentle and forgiving {{by the time of the}} New Testament. He spent many weeks revising the script, trying to make Klaatu's transition from alien in human form to one who appreciates their emotions and beliefs subtle and nuanced. Derrickson, the director, said that although Reeves would not use actions [...] "that are highly unusual or highly quirky", he nevertheless [...] "keeps <b>you</b> <b>aware</b> of the fact that this being you're walking through this movie with is not a human being." [...] At Reeves' insistence, the classic line [...] "Klaatu barada nikto" [...] was added to the script after initially being omitted. The line was recorded many times, and it was decided to combine two recordings: one where Reeves said it normally, and a reversed version where he said the line backwards, creating an [...] "alien" [...] effect.|$|E
2500|$|After ascertaining {{that the}} {{minister}} {{believed in the}} eternality of the Torah and its directives, Rabbi Shneur Zalman replied: [...] "When a person is, for example, so and so many years old (mentioning the exact age of his questioner), G-d asks him: Where are you?

2500|$|Three {{days after}} Sanders's discovery, at a public, {{televised}} committee hearing, Thompson asked former White House aide Alexander Butterfield the famous question, [...] "Mr. Butterfield, were <b>you</b> <b>aware</b> {{of the existence}} of any listening devices in the Oval Office of the President?" [...] thereby publicly revealing the existence of tape recordings of conversations within the White House. National Public Radio later called that session and the discovery of the Watergate tapes [...] "a turning point in the investigation." ...|$|E
2500|$|On Monday, July 16, 1973, {{during the}} {{televised}} hearings, Thompson publicly asked: [...] "Mr. Butterfield, are <b>you</b> <b>aware</b> of {{the installation of}} any listening devices in the Oval Office of the president?" [...] The revelation of cover-up on the taping system in the Oval Office led the House Judiciary Committee to submit three articles of impeachment for obstruction of justice, abuse of power, and contempt of congress. When the final article was approved July 30, 1974, Richard Nixon resigned on August 9, 1974.|$|E
2500|$|To Nimoy's surprise, Spock {{became a}} sex symbol; Isaac Asimov {{described}} the character as [...] "a security blanket with sexual overtones", and Nimoy reported that [...] "I've never had more female {{attention on a}} set before. And get this: {{they all want to}} touch the ears!" [...] (When a young woman asked [...] "Are <b>you</b> <b>aware</b> that you are the source of erotic dream material for thousands and thousands of ladies around the world?", he replied [...] "May all your dreams come true".)

2500|$|Hunt {{was also}} a proponent of {{artillery}} practices that reflected his conservative nature. Although acknowledging the power of massed batteries to repel infantry assaults (such as at Malvern Hill or against Pickett's Charge in the Battle of Gettysburg), he urged his gun crews to fire slowly and deliberately and reprimanded them if they exceeded an average of one shot per minute. He believed that faster rates impaired accurate targeting and depleted ammunition faster than could be replenished. A story often told about Hunt was when he exclaimed to a gunner of a fast-firing gun, [...] "Young man, are <b>you</b> <b>aware</b> that every round you fire costs $2.67?" [...] Fast firing also implied {{to him that the}} gun crew was not brave enough to stand fast on the battlefield, wanting to get back behind the lines for resupply.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the fall}} of 2011, {{seventeen}} plaintiffs {{filed a lawsuit against}} Rutherford County, alleging that it had violated Tennessee's open-meetings law. Their attorney said that the approval of the mosque violated the plaintiffs' constitutional rights, on the grounds that [...] "mosque members were compelled by their religion to subdue non-Muslims." [...] This was rejected by Chancellor Corlew, leaving the question of whether there had been sufficient public notice for the planning commission's meeting of May 24, 2010 as the only remaining issue to be decided. The plaintiffs' attorney repeatedly tried to expand the case, for instance, comparing the mosque unfavorably to a neighboring Baptist church: [...] "Are <b>you</b> <b>aware</b> of any information linking Grace Baptist Church to organizations that call for the killing of Americans?" [...] Because the Islamic Center was not named as a defendant, its members were unable to defend themselves in court against such accusations. If the case went against them, they would be forced to seek fresh approval in a climate that had become intensely hostile towards them. Saleh Sbenaty, a Syrian-born spokesman for the ICM, called the attacks [...] "draining" [...] and said that he had [...] "left my country over 30 years ago to get my freedom over here, and now that's being threatened. My First Amendment rights are under fire." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1942, Buñuel {{applied for}} American citizenship, because he {{anticipated}} that MoMA {{would soon be}} put under federal control. [...] But that same year, Dalí published his autobiography, The Secret Life of Salvador Dalí, in which {{he made it clear}} that he had split with Buñuel because the latter was a Communist and an atheist. News of this reached Archbishop Spellman, who [...] angrily confronted Barry with the question: [...] "Are <b>you</b> <b>aware</b> that you are harbouring in this Museum the Antichrist, the man who made a blasphemous film L'Age d'Or?" [...] At the same time, a campaign on the part of Hollywood, through its industry trade paper, the Motion Picture Herald, to undermine the MoMA film unit resulted in a 66% reduction in the department's budget and Buñuel felt himself compelled to resign. [...] In 1944, he returned to Hollywood for the third time, this time as Spanish Dubbing Producer for Warner Brothers. Before leaving New York, he confronted Dalí at his hotel, the Sherry Netherland, to tell the painter about the damage his book had done and then shoot him in the knee. Buñuel did not carry out the violent part of his plan. Dalí explained himself by saying: [...] "I did not write my book to put YOU on a pedestal. I wrote it to put ME on a pedestal".|$|E
