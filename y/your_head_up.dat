500|$|The lyrics for One Fierce Beer Coaster utilize {{over-the-top}} satire {{and toilet}} humor to provide comedy. For instance the album opener, [...] "Kiss Me Where It Smells Funny", {{is a song}} about {{a man and his}} new girlfriend and their adventures in cunnilingus. It was written by Jimmy Pop about his then-girlfriend; the two subsequent albums would each have one song about said girlfriend - [...] "Three Point One Four" [...] and [...] "No Hard Feelings," [...] respectively. [...] "Lift <b>Your</b> <b>Head</b> <b>Up</b> High (And Blow Your Brains Out)" [...] is a satirical call for people who have considered suicide to go through with the act, because their life is worthless. Three minutes into the song, Jimmy Pop says [...] "Rewind and let me reverse it backwards like Judas Priest first did." [...] Immediately after this, a four-second segment of backwards vocals repeats four times. When played in reverse, this segment says, [...] "Devil shall wake up and eat Chef Boyardee Beefaroni." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Til It Happens to You" [...] is {{a somber}} tune {{featuring}} orchestral production and soaring strings. The pop ballad delivers an empowering message: [...] "Hold <b>your</b> <b>head</b> <b>up</b> and be strong / When you fall you gotta get up", {{and has been}} described as [...] "stirring and emotional". Featuring a classical production, the song emphasizes Gaga's vocals, keeping focus on the lyrics, which clarifies that one cannot understand the feelings of a victim unless they have been in similar situation. The first verse is sung by Gaga in a vulnerable voice, which gradually changes into an aggressive tone, and finally a joyous one during the final lyrics. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com, [...] "Til It Happens to You" [...] is set in the time signature common for a slow tempo of 59 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of A minor with Gaga's vocals spanning from E3 to D5. The song follows a basic sequence of Am–C–Fmaj7–C–G/B as its chord progression.|$|E
500|$|To {{create the}} hip-hop and rock fusions on the album, Jimmy Pop {{utilized}} the standard hip hop technique of sampling. The chorus for [...] "Fire Water Burn" [...] {{is taken from}} [...] "The Roof Is on Fire" [...] by Rock Master Scott & the Dynamic Three and also features the lyrics 'I am white like Frank Black is / So if man is five and the devil is six then that must make me seven / This honkey's gone to heaven,' a direct reference to the post-1993 stage name of Black Francis who wrote the Pixies song [...] "Monkey Gone to Heaven" [...] to which the lyrics allude. [...] "Why's Everybody Always Pickin' On Me?" [...] is built around a re-recorded sample of [...] "Spooky", by Mike Sharpe as performed by Classics IV and also features a small lift from the Bill Cosby track [...] "Greasy Kid Stuff." [...] Finally, the track [...] "Your Only Friends Are Make Believe" [...] features a chorus melody lifted from the Duran Duran song [...] "Hungry Like the Wolf." [...] "Lift <b>Your</b> <b>Head</b> <b>Up</b> High (And Blow Your Brains Out)" [...] is built around a sample from [...] "Get Up and Boogie" [...] by the Silver Convention.|$|E
