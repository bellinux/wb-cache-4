2500|$|In a November 2014, {{interview}} with The A.V. Club, Reubens explained why the film {{took so long}} to be made, saying: [...] "I think part of what happened with this project is it got leaked probably {{a year and a half}} or two <b>years</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> really wanted anyone to know about it. I was doing a Q somewhere, and I said I was writing a movie with a guy named Paul Rust, and the next day a journalist called my manager and said, [...] "Paul Rust is someone very associated with Judd Apatow, can you confirm Judd Apatow is involved in the project?" [...] The whole thing got leaked and we had just started. We didn’t have a script yet or anything, so the script took a year and—I don’t really know the answer. I think two years of it was like premature information out there, and then the last two years it's just been very, very slow to get the right people involved, and we now have such an amazing company involved, and that's the really big announcement that hasn’t been made yet." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{is a long}} step {{backward}} in time, in fact {{more than a hundred}} <b>years,</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> reach the birthday, in 1794, of Thomas Corwin, one of the most gifted Ohioans who has ever lived.|$|E

2500|$|In July 2000, Tom Green became {{engaged to}} actress Drew Barrymore. Green and Barrymore met after Barrymore, {{who was a}} fan of Green's show, asked Green to appear in Charlie's Angels, which Barrymore starred in and produced. Green and Barrymore married on July 7, 2001. In Green's book Hollywood Causes Cancer, he writes [...] "We [...] lived {{together}} for a <b>year</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> were engaged, and we were engaged for a <b>year</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> got married". Barrymore also appeared in her then-fiance's infamous 2001 film Freddy Got Fingered.|$|R
60|$|We {{thought we}} {{knew all about}} Miss Ponsonby's past; but even pale, drab, china-blue women can have their secrets and keep them. It was a full half <b>year</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> {{discovered}} Miss Ponsonby's.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{not very}} much, but I don't know that I'm sorry. I'll see they're fixed right; {{whatever}} West gets I'll beat. My girl shan't be indebted to her husband's folks. But there's {{not a word}} {{to be said about}} this yet. West must wait another <b>year</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> decide on anything." ...|$|R
60|$|Two {{years after}} that, {{which is to}} say {{nineteen}} <b>years</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> of Jamestown came here, Sir Walter Raleigh sent over one hundred and sixteen people, among whom were men, women and children, and they also began to build a town on Roanoke Island.|$|E
6000|$|The Indians called these falls [...] "thundering water," [...] {{and it was}} {{an admirable}} title. The waters thunder over the great precipice, as they have done for {{thousands}} of <b>years</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> were born, {{and will continue to do}} thousands of years after we are dead.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{would like}} nothing better, poor fellow. But what strange {{things you have}} seen and done since we met! How little we thought that morning {{that it would be}} six <b>years</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> should sit side by side again! And Prince Rupert is kind to you?" ...|$|E
60|$|It is {{scarcely}} necessary {{to say how}} much I approved of this decision, or the applause I lavished on the warm-hearted donor. The sum was fixed at two thousand dollars a <b>year,</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> left the room; and the result was communicated to Rupert by Lucy herself, in a letter written the very next day.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oo-ay! we {{can only}} get ideas by seein' or readin'. It's a grawnd thing, travellin', but it's wonderfu' what readin' 'll do. My guid-man, that's deed this therteen year,--ay,--come Marti'mas, he wrought in Lunnon for a <b>year</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> was marrit, an' he sent me the {{newspapers}} reglar once a month--ay, the English is fine folk.

6000|$|... "Wait a little, Lucy, and {{you shall}} judge for yourself. We must go back--if I am {{to make you}} {{understand}} me--to the <b>year</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> knew each other--to {{the last year of}} my father's life. Did I ever tell you that my father moved southward, {{for the sake of his}} health, to a house in Kent that was lent to him by a friend?" ...|$|R
6000|$|She was {{altogether}} {{herself by}} day, gave {{no sign of}} emotion, and was as merry as possible throughout the journey, calling out to Dermot airily from the platform that she should send him a present of sour krout from Baden. Poor child, it was five <b>years</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> saw her again! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{feel how}} deeply indebted we are, for our good fortune, to your kindness, your grace," [...] Charlie said. [...] "We know that, but for you, months might have elapsed, even <b>years,</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> could have {{obtained}} such a result, even {{after we had}} the confession of Nicholson in our hands." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And alas {{for their}} sheepfold! It will be four <b>years</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> can get Cartagena rebuilt again. And {{as for the}} blockhouse, when we shall get that rebuilt, Heaven only knows, while his majesty goes on {{draining}} the Indies for his English Armada. The town is as naked now as an Indian's back." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{had promised}} old Andrew that {{directly}} {{we were in}} a house of our own we would have up his youngest daughter Susan, who had been with us for a <b>year</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> left Canterbury, as our servant; and, accordingly, when we had taken the cottage, and the furniture came in, we sent for Susan, who arrived in due course, and was installed as our maid-of-all-work; and an excellent servant she turned out.|$|R
5000|$|In {{reference}} to Go Native, Carr {{was quoted as}} saying: [...] "We {{had been talking about}} buying a horse for a <b>year</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> approached Martin Cullinane about it. He kept an eye out for a good one for us and, about three years ago, we bought Go Native." [...] Since their purchase, Go Native has won seven races and placed second in three, accumulating £310,254 in winnings. Three of Go Native's seven wins have come in Grade 1 National Hunt races.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, sir--bit by bit, {{as you may}} say. Slowly {{worse and}} worse one week after another. She was {{a little better than}} a <b>year</b> old <b>before</b> <b>we</b> clearly made it out that her sight was gone." ...|$|R
60|$|Felix and I shivered. We felt {{suddenly}} {{that we had}} escaped a dreadful danger--the danger of having been born somebody else. But it took the Story Girl to make us realize just how dreadful it was and what a terrible risk we had run <b>years</b> <b>before</b> <b>we,</b> or our parents either, had existed.|$|E
6000|$|This {{time it was}} {{the turn}} of Amelius to look at Regina in {{helpless}} consternation. [...] "Ten years?" [...] he repeated. [...] "Do you coolly contemplate waiting ten <b>years</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> are married? Good heavens! {{is it possible that}} you are thinking of the money? that you can't live without carriages and footmen, and ostentation and grandeur--?" ...|$|E
60|$|From another {{it would}} have sounded brutal, but I {{understood}} him. And so we shook hands and parted for longer than either of us at the time expected. The Franco-German War broke out {{a few weeks later}} on, and Hal, the love of adventure always strong within him, volunteered his services, which were accepted. It was some <b>years</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> met again.|$|E
2500|$|Seymour {{later told}} Tracee Hutchison [...] "I {{remember}} having {{a discussion with}} [...] and [...] in a beergarden at the Standard Hotel in Fitzroy, and I said 'Look, you know, we should try and make a commercial record {{if we want to}} take things seriously in the long term.' I think that was a <b>year</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> even started thinking about recording this record". He recalled for 100 Best Australian Albums (October 2010) that all the tracks are [...] "connected to the relationship that [...] and I had".|$|R
60|$|I find in {{relating}} {{those parts}} of my experience {{that seem to be}} of most significance I have neglected to tell of my mother's death, which occurred the <b>year</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> moved to Grant Avenue. She had clung the rest of her days to the house in which I had been born. Of late years she had lived in my children, and Maude's devotion to her had been unflagging. Truth compels me to say that she had long ceased to be a factor in my life. I have thought of her in later years.|$|R
60|$|Moreover, from a {{child she}} was a woman, as an Irishman might say, for {{circumstances}} and character had shaped her thus. Not {{much more than a}} <b>year</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> met, her mother, whose only child she was, and whom she loved with all her strong and passionate heart, died after a lingering illness, leaving her in charge of her father and his house. I think it was this heavy bereavement in early youth which coloured her nature with a grey tinge of sadness and made her seem so much older than her years.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do not {{see that}} at all. It must rest very much with him, no doubt;--with Carstairs; and I {{do not like to}} think that our girl's {{happiness}} should depend on any young man's constancy. But such dangers have to be encountered. You and I were engaged for three <b>years</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> were married, and we did not find it so very bad." ...|$|E
60|$|How {{had these}} things escaped the Goths forty <b>years</b> <b>before?</b> <b>We</b> cannot tell. Perhaps the Gothic sack, which only lasted five days, was less {{complete}} than this one, which {{went on for}} fourteen days of unutterable horrors. The plunderers were not this time sturdy honest Goths; not even German slaves, mad to revenge themselves on their masters: they were Moors, Ausurian black savages, and all the pirates and cut-throats of the Mediterranean.|$|E
60|$|Twenty-one <b>years</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> sailed from London, Sir Walter Raleigh {{sent out}} a fleet of seven ships, {{carrying}} one hundred and seven persons, to Virginia, and Master Ralph Lane was named as the governor. They landed on Roanoke Island; but because the Indians threatened them, and because just at that {{time when they were}} most frightened, Sir Francis Drake came by with his fleet, they all went home, not daring to stay any longer.|$|E
5000|$|The Spencer Foundation was {{established}} formally in 1962. That same year, Spencer, as President of SRA, testified before Congress and made explicit {{his belief in}} the reformative power of well-funded education research: [...] "In my judgment, hard-minded, sensible investments in educational research can provide the most effective single method of strengthening our schools." [...] Speaking to employees of his firm in 1961, Spencer noted that SRA was initially a nonprofit organization that [...] "nearly went broke in the first <b>year</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> gave up that idea... We reorganized as a commercial firm in 1939 and have been going up ever since." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mamma {{left you}} to me," [...] she said, stooping down and {{brushing}} {{his forehead with}} her lips hastily. [...] "You know you were {{to come to me}} when you were in trouble, or to tell me when you were very happy: that was our compact, Arthur, last <b>year,</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> parted. Are you very happy now, or are you in trouble--which is it?" [...] and she looked at him with an arch glance of kindness. [...] "Do you like going into Parliament! Do you intend to distinguish yourself there? How I shall tremble for your first speech!" ...|$|R
5000|$|The Indians {{always tried}} to live peaceably with the white {{soldiers}} and settlers. One day {{during the time that}} the soldiers were stationed at Apache Pass I made a treaty with the post. This was done by shaking hands and promising to be brothers. Cochise and Mangus-Colorado did likewise. I do not know the name of the officer in command, {{but this was the first}} regiment that ever came to Apache Pass. This treaty was made about a <b>year</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> were attacked in a tent, as above related. In a few days after the attack at Apache Pass we organized in the mountains and returned to fight the soldiers. Geronimo ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your {{father was}} a cousin of mine--second cousin, I think. I fancy there was some row between your {{grandfather}} {{and the rest of}} the family. I don't know anything about the right or wrongs of it; for it was, of course, many <b>years</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> were born; and I never heard of your father's existence, until a fortnight before I left England. Then there were some inquiries made about the family, owing to various deaths that took place in it. Do you know that your father was related--distantly of course--to the Earl of Netherly?" ...|$|E
6000|$|I thought I {{should have}} sunk when I had heard him make this solemn and premeditated declaration. I raved like a mad woman, and, {{at the end}} of my discourse, told him that I did not value what could happen to me, even if I was forced to beg my bread, for I would stand the test of my own character; and as I could get nothing by being an honest woman, so I should not scruple to declare that [...] "the son you have left what you have to is a bastard you had by me several <b>years</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> were married." ...|$|E

60|$|GAUNT. Ay, {{her watch}} that counted the hours when I was away; they were few and sorrowful, my Hester's hours; and this poor {{contrivance}} numbered them. The ring--with that I married her. This chain, it's of Guinea gold; I brought it home for her, the <b>year</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> married, {{and she wore}} it to her wedding. It was a vanity: they are all vanities; {{but they are the}} treasure of my soul. Below here, see, her wedding dress. Ay, the watch has stopped: dead, dead.
