500|$|Film critics Roger Ebert and Richard Roeper {{gave the}} film [...] "two thumbs up". Ebert said, [...] "In 39 years, I have never written these {{words in a}} movie review, but here they are: <b>You</b> <b>owe</b> it to {{yourself}} to see this film.

500|$|Kirk Hamilton of Kotaku {{praised the}} game, writing, [...] "if {{you own a}} PC, <b>you</b> <b>owe</b> it to {{yourself}} to play Gravity Bone." [...] He said the game was [...] "one of the coolest things I've played on PC lately." [...] Kieron Gillen from Rock Paper Shotgun considered Gravity Bone to be an intellectual mix of Hitman, , and Team Fortress 2, stating {{that it is the}} [...] "wittiest game" [...] he has played since World of Goo. Gillen applauded every aspect of the game, stating that Gravity Bone was an [...] "indie art game whose main effect is to delight you at every turn." [...] It received the [...] "Best Arthouse Game" [...] award in Game Tunnel's Special Awards of 2008.|$|E
500|$|Bastion was {{released}} to strong sales and critical acclaim. The game {{sold more than}} 500,000 copies during 2011, 200,000 of which were for the Xbox Live Arcade. In March 2013 at the PAX East gaming convention, Bastion's creative director Greg Kasavin stated that the game had sold more than 1.7 million copies combined across all platforms. By May 2014, the game had sold over 2 million copies, and by January 2015, it had sold over 3 million. Bob Mackey of 1UP.com called it [...] "the perfect mesh of game and story", and McKinley Noble of GamePro said that it [...] "raises the visual and narrative bar for downloadable titles". Maxwell McGee of GameSpot called it [...] "wonderfully crafted" [...] and [...] "an amazingly good time", and Greg Miller of IGN concluded that Bastion [...] "is amazing and <b>you</b> <b>owe</b> it to yourself to download it".|$|E
500|$|After more behind-the-scenes {{contract}} wrangling, Smith {{became a}} St. Louis Cardinal on February 11, 1982. Herzog believed Smith could improve his offensive production by hitting more ground balls, and subsequently created a motivational tool {{designed to help}} Smith concentrate on that task. Approaching Smith one day during spring training, Herzog said, [...] "Every time you hit a fly ball, <b>you</b> <b>owe</b> me a buck. Every time you hit a ground ball, I owe you a buck. We'll keep that going all year." [...] Smith agreed to the wager, {{and by the end}} of the season had won close to $300 from Herzog. As the 1982 season got underway, Herzog's newly assembled team won 12 games in a row during the month of April, and finished the season atop the National League East division. Herzog would later say of Smith's contributions that, [...] "If he saved two runs a game on defense, which he did many a night, it seemed to me that was just as valuable to the team as a player who drove in two runs a game on offense." ...|$|E

500|$|The school’s {{refusal to}} play Ward in the Georgia Tech game later {{became part of}} the public legacy of President Gerald R. Ford. Ward {{recalled}} that he met “my man Jerry” during freshman orientation in 1932, and the two became friends and roommates when the football team traveled for road games. When Ford learned that the school had capitulated to Georgia Tech, some accounts indicate that he [...] "quit the team" [...] or threatened to quit in order [...] "to make a statement and take a stand because Willis Ward was his friend." [...] Ford wrote about the Georgia Tech incident in his autobiography, recalling that he felt the decision to keep Willis out of the game was [...] "morally wrong." [...] “I went to Willis himself. He urged me to play. [...] ‘Look,’ he said, ‘the team’s having a bad year. We’ve lost two games already and we probably won’t win any more. You’ve got to play Saturday. <b>You</b> <b>owe</b> it to the team.’ [...] I decided he was right. That Saturday afternoon, we hit like never before and beat Georgia Tech 9–2.” [...] Years later, Ford wrote that the Ward incident had influenced his thinking about race. Ford noted: “His sacrifice led me to question how educational administrators could capitulate to raw prejudice.” [...] Ford used the story to voice his support for U-M’s affirmative action admissions policy saying, “Do we really want to risk turning back the clock to an era when the Willis Wards were isolated and penalized for the color of their skin, their economic standing or national ancestry?” ...|$|E
2500|$|IGN's Stephen Butts scored it 8.3 out of 10, {{calling it}} [...] "one {{of the best}} console {{experiences}} on the PC in a while." [...] He praised the controls and boss fights, but criticized the difficulty and platforming sections. He concluded [...] "when a game comes out for the PC that manages to retain all the simplicity and energy of its console brother, then <b>you</b> <b>owe</b> it yourself {{to give it a}} try. MDK 2 is definitely such a game." ...|$|E
2500|$|In December 1932, Starr grew irritated with Meher Baba {{and wrote}} to him, [...] "Give me either the 400 pounds <b>you</b> <b>owe</b> me or illumination; otherwise, I {{will leave you}} and expose you as a fraud!" [...] He then did leave Meher Baba. The money he {{referred}} to was money he had spent hosting Meher Baba at his retreat in Devon. Starr disbanded the Devon retreat and sold the property {{a year and a}} half later. He later organized 'nature cure and scientific relaxation' courses at Frogmore Hall, Herts.|$|E

2500|$|In early 2004, {{the band}} wrote three new songs for {{inclusion}} on a split EP with Desa. The EP showed {{a change of}} direction from The Chameleon Script, with the band dropping {{a lot of the}} predominant ska influences. This showed a transition that the band cemented with the release of The Answer Is Never later in the same year. The album was hailed by critics as [...] "a masterpiece" [...] and [...] "one of the best British rock records ever made", with [...] firmly stating [...] "If you claim to love music, <b>you</b> <b>owe</b> it to yourself to own this record, simply as that".|$|E
2500|$|Boros noted: [...] "When {{they talk}} about toughness, they always talk about arguing bad calls, {{spitting}} in an umpire's eye, kicking dust — all that macho image stuff. ... If the fans saw {{that kind of behavior}} in a football coach, they'd be repelled by it. Isn't it funny that one kind of behavior is expected from a football coach and another from a baseball manager? And they both have essentially the same job. It seems to me it takes a certain amount of mental toughness to keep control of your emotions. <b>You</b> <b>owe</b> it to management, your players and the fans to keep yourself under control at critical moments." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Austrian School {{economist}} Ludwig von Mises {{admired the}} unapologetic elitism {{he saw in}} Rand's work. In a letter to Rand written {{a few months after}} the novel's publication, he said it offered [...] "a cogent analysis of the evils that plague our society, a substantiated rejection of the ideology of our self-styled 'intellectuals' and a pitiless unmasking of the insincerity of the policies adopted by governments and political parties...

2500|$|Totte is Zillah's three-year-old (stuffed animal) chimpanzee. [...] The duo talk, sing, {{and perform}} magic tricks {{together}} for their comical performances.

[...] In {{the middle of the}} song, Zillah fell backwards over the letters and Totte blamed her for destroying their chance to win. [...] "Now <b>you</b> <b>owe</b> me a million!" [...] said Totte to Zillah before first demanding the audience to vote for him and then sweetly asking for their vote. [...] The strategy worked as they not only won the jury's votes but also votes of the public.|$|E
2500|$|Assassin's Creed: Revelations {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics upon release. Aggregating review websites GameRankings and Metacritic gave the PlayStation 3 version 80.05% and 80/100, the Xbox 360 version 79.37% and 80/100, and the PC version 74.67% and 80/100 respectively. IGN gave the game {{a rating of}} 8.5 out of 10, stating [...] "This is the best Assassin's Creed yet, even if that victory is claimed by an inch and not a mile. If you've been following the lives of Altair and Ezio this long, <b>you</b> <b>owe</b> it to yourself to see their last adventure." [...] 1UP gave the game a rating of B+, stating [...] "While Revelations lacks that one supreme improvement or standout mechanic that defined AC2 and Brotherhood each, it's still a damn fine sendoff for Altair and Ezio." ...|$|E
2500|$|Starting in September 2006, O'Brien was stalked by Father David Ajemian of the Archdiocese of Boston, who, despite {{multiple}} {{warnings to}} stop, sent O'Brien letters signed as [...] "your priest stalker" [...] and {{came into contact}} with O'Brien's parents. O'Brien and Ajemian had attended Harvard University at the same time. Frustrated that he had been denied a spot in the Late Night audience, Ajemian sent a letter to O'Brien stating that he flew to New York [...] "in the dimming hope that you might finally acknowledge me." [...] He stated in another letter, [...] "Is this the way you treat your most dangerous fans??? <b>You</b> <b>owe</b> me big time, pal." [...] In another letter, Ajemian seemed to make a death threat, saying, [...] "Remember Frank Costello once dodged a bullet in your building and so can you." ...|$|E

2500|$|Stiltz later {{testified before}} the coroner's jury that Switzer had banged on the front door, saying, [...] "Let me in, or I'll kick in the door." [...] Once inside, he and Stiltz began to argue. Switzer said, [...] "I want that 50 bucks <b>you</b> <b>owe</b> me now, and I mean now." [...] When Stiltz refused {{to give it to}} him, the men began to fight. Switzer {{allegedly}} struck Stiltz with a glass-domed clock, which caused him to bleed from his left eye. Stiltz retreated to his bedroom and returned with a [...]38-caliber revolver. Switzer grabbed the gun, resulting in a shot being fired that struck the ceiling. Switzer forced Stiltz into a closet, although Stiltz had regained his revolver. Switzer allegedly pulled a switchblade knife and screamed, [...] "I'm going to kill you!" [...] Fearing Switzer was about to attack, Stiltz shot him in the groin. Switzer suffered massive internal bleeding and was pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital.|$|E
2500|$|Mobutu reproached the United States in a Newsweek interview, {{saying he}} was [...] "bitterly {{disappointed}} by America's attitude" [...] and: [...] "If you have decided to surrender piecemeal to the Soviet-Cuban grand design in Africa, I think <b>you</b> <b>owe</b> it to us and to your friends to have the frankness to admit it." [...] Former National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger also blamed the Soviet Union, saying, [...] "Whatever {{the details of the}} current invasion of Zaire, {{it is clear that the}} attack took place across a sovereign border from a country in which the government was installed by Soviet arms and the military personnel of a Soviet client state. It could not have taken place—and it could not continue—without the material support or acquiescence of the Soviet Union—whether or not Cuban troops are present." [...] China concurred, provoking unpleasantness with Soviet ambassadors in Beijing and later calling the FNLC invasion [...] "a new offensive drive in the Soviet Union's political and military aggression in Africa".|$|E
2500|$|In June 2014, Derby {{rejected}} {{an offer}} from Burnley for Bryson.

[...] Soon afterwards, he agreed a new five-year contract with Derby, saying that his bond with the fans was {{part of the reason that}} he chose to stay: [...] "I've got a good bond with the fans as well and that was a big part in my decision to stay here. The fans have been excellent ever since I walked through the door. When you come to a new club it can take time to win over the fans, but they have been fantastic with me... they helped me make the biggest decision of my career, if not my life. I took a while to think about it and I knew it would be a massive decision. I went through stages where one minute I thought I was leaving and then the next minute I think I'm staying. But in the end it turned out to be an easy decision for me because Derby are such a great club to be part of." ...|$|E
