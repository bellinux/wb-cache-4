5|$|In February 1943, Lieutenant General Walter Krueger's Sixth United States Army {{headquarters}} {{arrived in}} Australia. Since Sixth Army would {{do all the}} planning, and there was as <b>yet</b> <b>little</b> scope for corps-sized operations, Eichelberger found himself with a training role, preparing the 24th Infantry Division, which had arrived from Hawaii, and the 32nd and 41st Infantry Divisions, which had returned from Papua, for future missions. The War Department asked in May 1943 if Eichelberger could be released to command the First United States Army, but MacArthur would not release him. Later, it {{asked if he could}} be released to command the Ninth United States Army, but this was also refused, and this job went to Eichelberger's West Point classmate William H. Simpson. Instead, he was given responsibility for Eleanor Roosevelt's visit to Australia in September 1943. She visited Sydney and Melbourne, and had dinner with the Governor General of Australia, Lord Gowrie, and the Prime Minister of Australia, John Curtin, in Canberra.|$|E
5|$|The non-professional conscripted {{soldiers}} who served a one-year term under the Minister of the Guards {{belonged to the}} Southern Army (Nanjun 南軍). Non-conscripted, professional soldiers belonged to a standing army known as the Northern Army (Beijun 北軍). The Northern Army's main purpose was to defend the capital, but it was sometimes required to repel foreign invasions. The Northern Army is first mentioned in Han records in about 180 BC, <b>yet</b> <b>little</b> is known of its command structure at that time. Several decades later, Emperor Wu reformed the Northern Army's officer corps so that its command was shared by five Colonels (Xiaowei 校尉) who each ranked 2,000-dan and commanded a regiment. Emperor Wu also appointed three other Colonels, ranked 2,000-dan, whose forces were considered {{an extension of the}} Northern Army yet were stationed far outside the capital at strategic passes. Each of the eight Colonels was assisted by a Major (Sima 司馬) who was ranked at 1,000-dan. Professional soldiers could also be found in agricultural garrisons established in the Western Regions, such as those led by the Wu and Ji Colonels (Wuji xiaowei 戊己校尉), who were ranked Equivalent to 600-dan and were based at the Turpan oasis.|$|E

The underfunding of Florida public schools was acknowledged by most elected leaders, but there seemed little public demand for increased school funding.|$|E

25|$|With philology, archaeology, and art history, {{scholars}} seek {{understanding of}} the history and culture of a civilisation, through critical study of the extant literary and physical artefacts, in order to compose and establish a continual historic narrative of the Ancient World and its peoples. The task is difficult due to a dearth of physical evidence: for example, Sparta was a leading Greek city-state, <b>yet</b> <b>little</b> evidence of it survives to study, and what is available comes from Athens, Sparta's principal rival; likewise, the Roman Empire destroyed most evidence (cultural artefacts) of earlier, conquered civilizations, {{such as that of}} the Etruscans.|$|E
25|$|One of Echols's most {{important}} <b>yet</b> <b>little</b> known roles was his membership from 1943 to 1945 on the Air Production Board {{and on the}} Executive Committee of the War Production Board.

Helping to determine the relative strength of air versus land and sea forces of the United States were one of Echols's responsibilities, as was the task of deciding relative strengths of fighter aircraft to light-, medium- and heavy bomber forces.|$|E
25|$|A concern {{regarding}} Internet-of-things technologies {{pertains to}} {{the environmental impacts of}} the manufacture, use, and eventual disposal of all these semiconductor-rich devices. Modern electronics are replete {{with a wide variety of}} heavy metals and rare-earth metals, as well as highly toxic synthetic chemicals. This makes them extremely difficult to properly recycle. Electronic components are often incinerated or placed in regular landfills. Furthermore, the human and environmental cost of mining the rare-earth metals that are integral to modern electronic components continues to grow. With production of electronic equipment growing globally <b>yet</b> <b>little</b> of the metals (from end-of-life equipment) are being recovered for reuse, the environmental impacts can be expected to increase.|$|E

25|$|James Grant, an Elgin solicitor, {{later to}} become Provost of Elgin, and {{co-owner}} {{with his brother}} of the Glen Grant distillery at Rothes first envisaged {{the construction of a}} railway between Elgin and Lossiemouth in 1841. A survey showed that the line was feasible and could be built relatively cheaply <b>yet</b> <b>little</b> financial support for the enterprise could be obtained. On 3 February 1844 and still steadfast in his belief in the project, Grant addressed the board of the Elgin and Lossiemouth Harbour Company in an effort to gain their support—the board's opinion was there was little need for railways north of Dundee, let alone one between the two towns. Following the harbour company's own investigation, it changed its opinion and gave it their backing.|$|E
25|$|The Dome of the Rock {{with its}} {{inscriptions}} are interesting in the dating of the text. These inscriptions {{have been known}} to scholars {{for more than a century}} and have repeatedly been the subject of interpretation, <b>yet</b> <b>little</b> attention has been paid to the elements from which they were composed. On the inner face of the octagon the declaration of faith is followed by conflated verses describing the powers of God. Next Muhammad is introduced, with a blessing that, though not directly quoted from the Quran, was clearly already in use in 694 AD. Then comes an exhortation to Christians that Jesus was also a prophet and mortal, followed by the claim that God is sufficient unto Himself. Finally comes a command to bend to His will and the threat of reckoning for those who do not.|$|E
25|$|Unfortunately, {{little remains}} of the early construction, {{although}} it assumed that the castle {{was built on the}} Romanesque principals of the time, that included a keep tower surrounded by a walled fortification and battlements. <b>Yet,</b> <b>little</b> remains to suggest that was the case, since no archaeological surveys are related with this period, and that many of the 12th century fragments may have been swept away by events in the subsequent years. Between the 12th and 13th century, the alcaide offered the castle to King D. Sancho I, who compensated his captain, by offering him the title of master of Vimioso, which was conferred on Mendo Rufino. The King planned of transforming Algoso into the centre of his vast territory, encompassing the area of Miranda do Douro and Penas Róias. But, between 1212 and 1213, the lands were invaded by troops loyal to the King of León, Alfonso IX, as a reprisal for the contestation of the Portuguese King against the donations of his sisters. Following a period of turmoil, in 1219, peace was brokered between the Kingdoms of León and Portugal.|$|E

25|$|By the 16th century, the Christian Kingdom of Georgia {{had become}} {{fractured}} {{into a series}} of smaller states which were fought over by the two great Muslim empires in the region, Ottoman Turkey and Safavid Persia. But {{during the second half of}} the century a third imperial power emerged to the north, namely the Russian state of Muscovy, which shared Georgia's Orthodox religion. Diplomatic contacts between the Georgian Kingdom of Kakheti and Moscow began in 1558 and in 1589, Tsar Fyodor I offered to put the kingdom under his protection. <b>Yet</b> <b>little</b> help was forthcoming and the Russians were still too remote from the south Caucasus region to challenge Ottoman or Persian control and hegemony successfully. Only in the early 18th century did Russia start to make serious military inroads south of the Caucasus. In 1722, Peter the Great exploited the chaos and turmoil in the Safavid Persian Empire to lead an expedition against it, while he struck an alliance with Vakhtang VI, the Georgian ruler of Kartli and the Safavid-appointed governor of the region. However, the two armies failed to link up and the Russians retreated northward again, leaving the Georgians to the mercy of the Persians. Vakhtang ended his days in exile in Russia.|$|E
