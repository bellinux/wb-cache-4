It also seems like when you're a kid <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> goals about what you want your life to become.

50|$|It's {{a little}} tricky because the US {{never really had}} any strong leftist movement. But {{if you look at}} Europe, after 1917 people were really scared about {{communism}} in all the Western European countries. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> poor people, they might rise up and kill us and take our stuff. That wasn't just a fantasy because it was happening next door. And that, we can show, did trigger steps in the direction of having more welfare programs and a rudimentary safety net in response to fear of communism. Not that they communists would invade, but that there would be homegrown movements of this sort. American populism is a little different because it's more detached from that. But it happens roughly at the same time, and people in America are worried about communism, too—not necessarily very reasonably. But that was always in the background. And people have only begun to study systematically to what extent the threat, real or imagined, of this type of radical regime really influenced policy changes in Western democracies. You don't necessarily even {{have to go out and}} kill rich people—if there was some plausible alternative out there, it would arguably have an impact on policy making at home. That's certainly there in the 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, and 60s. And there's a debate, right, because it becomes clear that the Soviet Union is really not in very good shape, and people don't really like to be there, and all these movements lost their appeal. That's a contributing factor, arguably, that the end of the Cold War coincides roughly with the time when inequality really starts going up again, because elites are much more relaxed about the possibility of credible alternatives or threats being out there.|$|E

40|$|French il y a-clefts and existentials: {{information}} structural parallels Lena Karssenberg, KU Leuven 1. Introduction. Il y a-clefts (1) {{are usually}} {{said to have}} an all-focus (‘presentational’) articulation (see Lambrecht 1988 / 1994 / 2001 / 2004; Léard 1992), in which both the Clefted Element (‘CE’) Sarah and the Cleft Relative Clause (‘CRC’) qui chante are focal. (1) All-focus il y a-cleft A: What’s happening? B: Il y a Sarah qui chante. ‘Sarah is singing. ’ (lit. ‘There’s Sarah who’s singing’) Il y a-clefts are relatively underresearched with respect to c’est-clefts (but see Lambrecht 1988; Willems & Meulleman 2010; Choi-Jonin & Lagae 1997; Giry-Schneider 1988 a. o.) and {{have not yet been}} analysed on the basis of extensive corpus research. 2. Goal. Contrary to what has been assumed before, I will show that il y a-clefts instantiate three Information Structure (IS) -articulations: all-focus, focus-background and contrastive topic-comment. Moreover, I will argue that these three articulations of il y a- clefts are on a par with three types of existentials. This will lead to the proposal that il y a – regardless of whether it introduces an existential or a cleft – always encodes the instruction for the hearer that, by default, she should not expect the following constituent to be a topic. 3. IS articulations of il y a-clefts. The results of extensive corpus research (in formal and informal written and spoken French: Le Monde, YCCQA, CFFP 2000) show that 75 % of the il y a-clefts have an all- focus articulation (1), 24 % have a focus-background articulation (2) (cf. Davidse [2000 / 2014] for similar English there-clefts) and il y a-clefts can even express a topic- comment articulation in which the topic is always contrastive (3) (6 cases in total). To the best of my knowledge, this last type, which is very similar to a left-dislocation (3 ’), has not been observed before. (2) Focus-background il y a-cleft [A: ‘I’m looking for car models that cost less than € 10. 000, where should I go?’] B: Bonjour. Il y a la Citroën C 1 qui est à moins de 10 000 euros. B: ‘Hello. There’s the Citroën C 1 that costs less than € 10. 000. (YCCQA) (3) (Contrastive) topic-comment il y a-cleft [‘And Salman says: “( [...] .) There’s the establishment that hates me. There’s all those assholes who think I just made publicity with the fatwa. ] Mais il y a le peuple qui, lui, a toujours été formidable avec moi. ‘But there’s the people who, them, have always been fantastic to me. ’ (Le Monde) (3 ’) Mais le peuple, lui, a toujours été formidable avec moi. ‘But the PEOPLE have always been fantastic to me. ’ (lit. ‘But the people, them, have always been fantastic to me’) 4. Similarities between il y a-clefts and existentials. Interestingly, the three types of il y a-clefts closely parallel three types of existentials. Firstly, in both all-focus il y a-clefts and regular existentials (4), the whole sentence has been claimed to be predicated of a contextually defined stage topic (Erteschik-Shir 2007; Leonetti 2014; De Cat 2007 a. o.). ￼￼￼￼ (4) a. Regular existential stage topic [There is a dog in my garden]FOCUS (Erteschik-Shir 2007) b. All-focus il y a-cleft stage topic [Y a quelqu’un qui sonne à la porte. ]FOCUS (based on De Cat 2007) ‘There’s someone ringing at the door. ’ A second type of existentials, with a definite pivot (5), has been discussed extensively in light of the Definiteness Effect (Rando & Napoli 1978; Abbott 1997; Bentley 2014; Leonetti 2008 /forthc; Villalba 2013). These ‘list existentials’ are on a par with focus- background il y a-clefts (2) : in both of them, there is a contextually available topic that expresses a variable for which the CE/pivot provides a focus value, as shown in (6) (see also Francez 2007; Furukawa 1996 and Hartmann 2008 for similar analyses). (5) List existential A: - How many people know about this? B: - There’s me and there’s you. That’s all. (Rando & Napoli 1978 : 308) (6) =(5) a. As for [people who know about this]TOPIC, there’s [me and you]FOCUS =(2) b. As for [cars that cost less than € 10. 000]TOPIC, there’s [the Citroën c 1]FOCUS [that costs less than € 10. 000]BACKGROUND The last type of existential is illustrated in (7), and its pivot is argued to be a contrastive topic (you, contrasted with people struggling [...] .), with respect to which the following clause (<b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> [...] .) provides a comment, as shown by the paraphrase in (7 ’). (7) Existential with contrastive topic She said there were people struggling for their lives and then there's you [...] <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> opportunities and you're throwing it all away. (www) (7 ’) There are people struggling for their lives, but as for you, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> opportunities [...] . The obligatory contrastivity of these topics is the result of pragmatic accommodation by the speaker: il y a is by default followed by a focus constituent (as witnessed by the quantitative data), and therefore the marked appearance of a topic behind il y a needs some extra motivation. Contrastivity is in this case the licensing factor for the use of a marked expression (the same holds for contrastive sentence-initial bare plurals in Italian [Leonetti 2013] and contrastive pronouns in Catalan existentials [Villalba forthc. ]). 5. Il y a-clefts and existentials encode the same instruction. Given that (i) both il y a-clefts and existentials instantiate the same three IS articulations, and that (ii) the contrastive topic-comment articulation is very infrequent (presumably also in the case of existentials), I propose that il y a signals to the hearer that what is to follow is by default a focus – regardless of whether it introduces a cleft or an existential. In the rare case that the CE/pivot is a topic, the hearer infers that it must be contrastive. This processing instruction presumably saves the hearer time w. r. t. canonical subject verb sentences without il y a, because the hearer can block the expectation of a regular topic- comment articulation. In other words, by overtly announcing the information structural status of the following constituent, il y a is argued to facilitate processing. Selected References. Lambrecht, Knud. 1988.

40|$|Introduction It {{has been}} argued that existential {{sentences}} only introduce foci (1 a), not topics (1 b) (Francez 2007; Bentley 2012 / 2013; Cruschina 2015). They can therefore be seen as focus-marking devices (Besserman et al. 2015). (1) 	a. There’s a white cat in the garden. (Cruschina 2012) 	b. – ‘Where’s my sister?’ 	– # B’est sorre tua in coghina. 	 # ‘There’s your sister in the kitchen. ’ (Bentley 2012) It/c’èst clefts can introduce both foci and topics (Prince 1978; Dufter 2009), whereas existential clefts introduced by French ya / Italian c’è ‘there is’ (2) are argued to introduce foci only (Lambrecht 1994), but this has not yet been verified. (2) 	a. Ya le téléphone qui sonne. 	‘The phone is ringing. ’ (Lambrecht 2000) 	b. C’è un signore che vuole parlare con te. 	‘There’s a man who wants to talk to you. ’ (Marzo & Crocco 2015) Goal The first goal {{of this study is to}} verify whether existential clefts only introduce foci by analyzing over 600 clefts from four (French and Italian) corpora. The second goal is to compare the information structure potential of existential sentences and existential clefts. Results It turns out that ya clefts and c’è clefts express three different articulations, in which the clefted element is never topical: all-focus (2), focus-background (3 a) and doubly contrastive all-focus (3 b), in which the clefted element and the relative clause are contrasted with the previous context. (3) 	a. (– ‘What’s your favorite TV show?’) - "How I Met Your Mother" c'est génial, y'a aussi "Lost" qui est bien. 	- ‘HIMYM is great, there’s also Lost that’s good. ’ b. Ci sono ragazze che hanno tutte le illustrazioni eppoi ci sono io che ne ho tipo 8. ‘There are girls who have all the illustrations and then there’s me who only has like 8. ’ Secondly, existential sentences can express the same articulations, the only difference being that the information denoted by the relative clause in clefts is encoded differently in existentials, e. g. as a (pre/postposed) PP in all-focus (1 a) and focus-background existential sentences (4 a) or as a new sentence (you have…) in a double contrast all-focus existential sentence (4 b). (4) 	a. (Among the decisions taken by the EU that you can easily observe,) il y a par exemple la création de l'Euro. 	‘… there is for example the creation of the Euro. ’ 	b. She said there were people struggling for their lives and then there's you [...] <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> opportunities and you're throwing it all away. The more general conclusion is therefore that existential sentences and existential clefts display considerable similarities and that ya and c’è can be seen as focus markers, regardless of whether they introduce an existential sentence or a cleft.
