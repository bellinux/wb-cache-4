2500|$|The film {{received}} a mixed response upon its original release, but {{has earned a}} better reception in later years, becoming a favorite with fans of Henson and fantasy. It currently holds a 72% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Vincent Canby of The New York Times negatively reviewed the film, describing it as a [...] "watered down J. R. R. Tolkien ... without charm as well as interest." [...] Kevin Thomas gave it a more positive assessment in the Los Angeles Times: [...] "Unlike many screen fantasies, The Dark Crystal casts its spell from its very first frames and proceeds so briskly that it's over before <b>you</b> <b>realize</b> <b>it.</b> You're left with {{the feeling that you}} have just awakened from a dream." ...|$|E

Don't you {{understand that it is}} the gambler's instinct--the restless desire to be playing pitch-and-toss with fate, with honor, with life and death, if you will--that brings such as myself into the ranks of the 'Double-Four'? It is the weariness which kills, Peter Ruff. One must needs keep it from one's bones." ...|$|E

[...] And then, as he still hesitated, she stretched out and caught him by the arm. Her voice was vibrant with earnestness. [...] "Andre, you don't realize how serious is your position. If these people take you, it is almost certain that you will be hanged. Don't <b>you</b> <b>realize</b> <b>it?</b> You must not go to Gavrillac.

60|$|It was a sight which I {{shall never}} forget until my dying day--so weird, so impossible, that I {{do not know}} how I am to make <b>you</b> <b>realize</b> <b>it,</b> or how in a few years I shall bring myself to believe in it if I live to sit once more on a lounge in the Savage Club and look out on the drab {{solidity}} of the Embankment.

Yet I will set it down now, while it is still fresh in my memory, and one at least, the man who lay in the damp grasses by my side, will know if I have lied.|$|E

And the chapter, the long, unresting, {{progressing}} chapter, expands and expands; it never jumps you forward, it never lets you off, you can't skip and you can't escape, until there comes at last a culminating distension of statement in which you realize more and more clearly, until <b>you</b> <b>realize</b> <b>it</b> with the unforgettable certainty of a thing long fought for and won at last, that Mr. Blandish has actually come upon the house and with a vigour of decision as vivid as a flash of lightning in a wilderness of troubled clouds, as vivid indeed as the loud, sonorous bursting of a long blown bladder, has said 'This is it!' On that 'This is it' my chapter ends, with an effect of enormous relief, with something of the beautiful serenity that follows a difficult parturition.|$|E

You little realize what far-reaching harm has just been wrought here under the fickle forms of law. Imitation is the bane of courts--I thank God that this one is free from the contamination of that vice--and in no long time {{you will see the}} fatal work of this hour seized upon by profligate so-called guardians of justice in all the wide circumstance of this planet and perpetuated in their pernicious decisions. I wash my hands of this iniquity. I would have compelled these culprits to expose their guilt, but support failed me where I had most right to expect aid and encouragement. And I was confronted by a law made in the interest of crime, which protects the criminal from testifying against himself. Yet I had precedents of my own whereby I had set aside that law on two different occasions and thus succeeded in convicting criminals to whose crimes there were no witnesses but themselves. What have you accomplished this day? Do <b>you</b> <b>realize</b> <b>it?</b> You have set adrift, unadmonished, in this community, two men endowed with an awful and mysterious gift, a hidden and grisly power for evil--a power by which each in his turn may commit crime after crime of the most heinous character, and no man be able to tell which is the guilty or which the innocent party in any case of them all.

6000|$|So {{naturally}} Central Square {{with its}} trees and its fountains and its statues {{is one of}} the places of chief interest in the City. But especially because there stands along one side of it the vast pile of the Grand Palaver Hotel. It rises fifteen stories high and fills all one side of the square. It has, overlooking the trees in the square, twelve hundred rooms with three thousand windows, and it would have held all George Washington's army. Even people in other cities who have never seen it know it well from its advertising; [...] "the most homelike hotel in America," [...] so it is labelled in all the magazines, the expensive ones, on the continent. In fact, the aim of the company that owns the Grand Palaver--and they do not attempt to conceal it--is to make the place as much a home as possible. Therein lies its charm. It is a home. You realize that when you look up at the Grand Palaver from the square at night when the twelve hundred guests have turned on the lights of the three thousand windows. <b>You</b> <b>realize</b> <b>it</b> at theatre time when the great string of motors come sweeping to the doors of the Palaver, to carry the twelve hundred guests to twelve hundred seats in the theatres at four dollars a seat. But most of all do you appreciate the character of the Grand Palaver when you step into its rotunda. Aladdin's enchanted palace was nothing to it. It has a vast ceiling with a hundred glittering lights, and within it night and day is a surging crowd that is never still and a babel of voices that is never hushed, and over all there hangs an enchanted cloud of thin blue tobacco smoke such as might enshroud the conjured vision of a magician of Baghdad or Damascus.|$|E
