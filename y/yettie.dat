50|$|Many American musicians went to Belgium (and to Europe in general) in {{the early}} 1950s to live and perform there. Conversely, Belgian jazz musicians also enjoyed success in the States, among them guitarist and {{harmonica}} player Toots Thielemans, vibraphonist Fats Sadi, trumpet player Sandy Herman and saxophonist Jack Sels. Other Belgians toured in Europe with American bands, among them singer <b>Yettie</b> Lee who went to Paris with Roy Eldridge.|$|E
50|$|After the war, Werdyger {{found his}} eldest brother, Yaakov Meir, and {{youngest}} sister, <b>Yettie,</b> still alive. He traveled to Makow to attend Yaakov Meir's wedding {{and was there}} introduced to Malka Godinger (1923 - 1980), daughter of Meir Godinger. They married shortly after. Several months later Werdyger and his wife left for Paris, France, where their first son, Yisrael Aryeh, was born. Four years later, in February 1950, they sailed to New York.|$|E
50|$|It {{was first}} {{discovered}} and named by Europeans on 3 March 1838 when an exploration party of four young horsemen comprising John Hill, William Wood, Charles Willis, and John Oakden camped {{there on the}} first overland expedition from Adelaide to reach the River Murray at present Morgan. Oakden reported that the valley was 'swarming with cockatoos, seven of which were shot' to roast for supper. They encamped there at 'a rivulet' they had discovered, later named <b>Yettie</b> Creek.|$|E
5000|$|During {{construction}} large {{stones were}} used in the wall to save concrete and tram rails were used to reinforce the upper section. The Barossa Reservoir was formed by damming the <b>Yettie</b> Creek gorge in the northern Mount Lofty Ranges, a feat that took over 400 men. Its water comes through a two-kilometre tunnel, carved by horse power, from the South Para River and Reservoir, and is supplemented by the Warren Reservoir and the River Murray. In addition to Gawler and country, a filtration plant constructed in 1982 allows the Reservoir to supply the suburbs of Munno Para and Elizabeth.|$|E
50|$|In {{the winter}} of 1928-1929 the Pendleburys visited Egypt for the first time. They {{assisted}} briefly in the excavation at Armant, then, late in 1928, at Tel el-Amarna. Excavations at Amarna had been started 40 years earlier by Flinders Petrie, but were then continuing under directorship of Hans Frankfort for the Egypt Exploration Society. Hans and his wife, <b>Yettie,</b> had been students at the British School before Pendlebury's arrival there. They were friends of Humfrey Payne, whose wife, Dilys, would become Pendlebury's biographer {{in the latter part}} of her life. Humfrey was appointed Director of the British School in 1929, still in his 20's.|$|E
50|$|With the Nazi {{occupation}} of Poland in September 1939, Werdyger {{was subject to}} frequent arrests and forced labor {{on the streets of}} Kraków. In the summer of 1940, when the Nazis ordered all Jews to leave the city, Werdyger's family moved to an uncle's home in Proszowice. In response to rumors of a mass deportation, David, his unmarried sister <b>Yettie,</b> and his parents went into hiding with 16 others in a bunker in their uncle's warehouse, where they were cared for by a Polish employee. Three weeks later, they sneaked into the Podgórze ghetto of Kraków. From there, his parents bought {{their way out of the}} ghetto into Sosnowice, where one of their married daughters was living. David never saw them again.|$|E
