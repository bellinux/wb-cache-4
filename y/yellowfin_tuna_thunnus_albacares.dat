40|$|Using a {{combination}} of diverse large predatory fishes and one seabird, we collected information on the cephalopod fauna of the western Indian Ocean. We analyzed the stomach contents of 35 fishes representing ten families (Xiphiidae, Istiophoridae, Scombridae, Carangidae, Coryphaenidae, Alepisauridae, Dasyatidae, Carcharhinidae, Alopiidae and Sphyrnidae) and of the sooty tern Onychoprion fuscata of the Mozambique Channel from 2000 to 2010. Both fresh and accumulated beaks were used for identifying cephalopod prey. Cephalopods were important prey for twelve predators; swordfish Xiphias gladius had the highest cephalopod proportion; sooty tern (O. fuscata) and bigeye <b>tuna</b> (<b>Thunnus</b> obesus) had high proportions too. We recovered 23 cephalopod families and identified 38 species. Ten species from four Teuthida families (Ommastrephidae, Onychoteuthidae, Histioteuthidae and Ancistrocheiridae) and two Octopoda families (Argonautidae and Bolitaenidae) occurred very frequently in the stomach contents, while Sepiida were rare. Ommastrephidae were the most cephalopod food sources: the purpleback flying squid Sthenoteu this oualaniensis was the most prevalent prey by far, Ornithoteuthis volatilis was important for eleven predators and few but large specimens of the neon flying squid Ommastrephes bartramii were recovered in the stomachs of swordfish in the Indian South Subtropical Gyre province only. Predators' groups were identified based on cephalopod prey composition, on depth in which they forage, and on prey size. Surface predators' diets were characterized by lower cephalopod diversity but greater average numbers of cephalopod prey, whereas the deep-dwelling predators (swordfish and bigeye tuna) preyed on larger specimens than surface predators (O. fuscata or <b>yellowfin</b> <b>tunas</b> <b>Thunnus</b> <b>albacares).</b> Our findings emphasized the usefulness of a community of marine predators to gain valuable information on the biology {{and the distribution of}} the cephalopod forage fauna that are discussed with regard to biogeographic province, marine predator, fishing gear to catch the large pelagic fishes, and size of the beaks recovered in the stomachs...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The trophic {{relations}} of two apex predators, <b>yellowfin</b> and bigeye <b>tuna</b> (<b>Thunnus</b> <b>albacares</b> and T. obesus), and their prey were investigated {{in the western}} tropical Indian Ocean. The contents of 173 non-empty stomachs were analysed from specimens caught with longlines and purse seine during scientific and fishing cruises. Diet data were processed by occurrence, by number, and by wet weight and a comparison of diets between surface and deep swimmers made. Crustaceans were the almost exclusive food source of surface-swimming bigeye tuna, with the stomatopod (Natosquilla investigatoris) being the sole prey item recorded in this category. The diet of deep-swimming <b>yellowfin</b> <b>tuna</b> was balanced between epipelagic fish, crustaceans and cephalopods. Bigeye tuna fed predominantly on cephalopods and mesopelagic fish (Scopelarchidae and Paralepididae), for which this predator {{appeared to be the}} most active chaser.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Easter Island (Rapa Nui) is well {{studied in}} terms of its archaeology; however, {{information}} regarding the history of fishing is extremely limited. Marine resources have likely been exploited from the time the first Polynesians arrived on this remote island. While large pelagics are part of the traditional Rapa Nui diet, inshore fish and invertebrates have also made their way into the diet. Official records of fisheries catches in what is now the Easter Island Province of Chile, which also includes the uninhabited island of Salas y Gómez, are very limited and were available for only some years. Using anecdotal information, historical descriptions and the limited quantitative information available, we reconstructed fisheries catches in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of the Easter Island Province over the 1950 – 2010 time period. Totaling almost 6, 000 metric tonnes, legal catches have been increasing rapidly since the late 1970 s, but are now stagnating at around 150 – 200 t·year- 1. The main species targeted were Pacific chub (‘nanue’; Kyphosus sandwicensis) and <b>yellowfin</b> <b>tuna</b> (‘kahi’; <b>Thunnus</b> <b>albacares),</b> with spiny lobster (‘ura’; Panulirus pascuensis) being the most important invertebrate species. There are indications of a substantial illegal fishery for large pelagics in the EEZ of the province, estimated at 200 – 2, 000 t·year- 1, which may have operate...|$|R

40|$|Muscle {{excitation}} and contraction {{involves the}} release of Ca 2 + ions from the Sarcoplasmic Reticulum. Muscle contraction occurs when Ca 2 + ions, which are stored inside the Sarcoplasmic Reticulum (SR), are released by the SR release channels called the Ryanodine Receptors (RyR). There are three main isoforms of Ryanodine Receptors found in various muscle types throughout the body. The RyR 1 isoform is expressed predominantly in skeletal muscle and areas of the brain, while the RyR 2 and RyR 3 are expressed in cardiac tissue and smooth muscle respectively. Fish express two fiber-type specific RyR 1 isoforms that are phylogenetically closely related, slow twitch and fast twitch. Fish possess two main types of skeletal muscle, red and white muscle. Red muscle is used in routine sustained activities and has slow twitch RyR. In comparison to red muscle, white muscle mass is usually large for short periods of powerful bursts and utilizes the fast twitch RyR. Previous studies have shown an unusual condition in which the slow twitch specific RyR transcript retains an intron when expressed in fast (white) muscle. In our study we have detected the retained intron in both red (slow) and white muscle. We conducted research on Yellow Fin <b>tuna</b> (<b>Thunnus</b> <b>Albacares)</b> and Albacore <b>tuna</b> (<b>Thunnus</b> Alalunga) to determine weather the intron retention exsist in {{them as well as}} the Blue Marlin (Makaira Nigricans) for which the full length sequence was originally characterized...|$|R
