25|$|North Korean People's Liberation Front {{claims that}} it has support and {{contacts}} within disaffected officers of the Korean People's Army, but analysts are not convinced of this. They also claim to have contacts within the police of North Korea. Hankuk University of Foreign Studies professor Namkung <b>Young</b> <b>says</b> {{that members of the}} organization know the North Korean situation well, but they should be more realistic with their goals. Furthermore, he noted that South Korean support for the organization could increase tensions between the governments. A U.S. military analyst was unaware of any independent sources supporting the claims that the North Korean military would be discontent enough to attempt a coup.|$|E

For instance, Cathy <b>Young</b> <b>says</b> that statements such as, [...] "Intercourse is the pure, sterile, formal expression of men's contempt for women," [...] are reasonably summarized as [...] "All sex is rape".|$|E
2500|$|The July 2006 {{talks in}} Geneva {{failed to reach}} an {{agreement}} about reducing farming subsidies and lowering import taxes, and negotiations took months to resume. A successful outcome of the Doha round became increasingly unlikely, because the broad trade authority granted under the Trade Act of 2002 to President George W. Bush was due to expire in 2007. Any trade pact would then have to be approved by the Congress with the possibility of amendments, which would hinder the US negotiators and decrease the willingness of other countries to participate. Hong Kong offered to mediate the collapsed trade liberalisation talks. Director-general of Trade and Industry, Raymond <b>Young,</b> <b>says</b> the territory, which hosted the last round of Doha negotiations, has a [...] "moral high-ground" [...] on free trade that allows it {{to play the role of}} [...] "honest broker".|$|E

2500|$|In May 2009, {{newspapers}} {{reported that}} Edwards' campaign was being investigated for conversion of campaign money to personal use {{related to the}} affair. Edwards said that the campaign was complying with the inquiry. The relevant US attorney refused to comment. In the same month, George Stephanopoulos of ABC News reported that members of Edwards' staff {{had told him that}} they had planned a [...] "doomsday strategy" [...] to derail Edwards' campaign if he got close to the nomination. Joe Trippi, a senior advisor to the campaign, said the report was [...] "complete bullshit". In August 2009, Rielle Hunter appeared before the grand jury investigating this matter. On March 15, 2010, Hunter broke her silence during an interview with GQ magazine and provided new details about the affair. In March 2011, voicemail messages allegedly left by John Edwards were obtained, which <b>Young</b> <b>says</b> prove that Edwards arranged the cover up of his affair with Hunter.|$|E
60|$|As to all engagements, I am in a {{state of}} happy acquiescence, having {{resigned}} myself, as a very tame lion, into the hands of my keepers. Whenever the time comes for me to do any thing, I try to behave as well as I can, which, as Dr. <b>Young</b> <b>says,</b> is all that an angel could do in the same circumstances.|$|E

So, then, observe, {{this feeling}} {{which you are}} {{accustomed}} to despise--this secret and poetical enthusiasm in all your hearts, which, as practical men, you try to restrain--is indeed one of the holiest parts of your being. It is the instinctive delight in, and admiration for, sublimity, beauty, and virtue, unusually manifested. And so {{far from being a}} dangerous guide, it is the truest part of your being. It is even truer than your consciences. A man's conscience may be utterly perverted and led astray; but so long as the feelings of romance endure within us, they are unerring,--they are as true to what is right and lovely as the needle to the north; and all {{that you have to do}} is to add to the enthusiastic sentiment, the majestic judgment--to mingle prudence and foresight with imagination and admiration, and you have the perfect human soul. But the great evil of these days is that we try to destroy the romantic feeling, instead of bridling and directing it. Mark what <b>Young</b> <b>says</b> of the men of the world:-- ...|$|E

5000|$|If {{both players}} {{have the same}} number of cards in a suit, then they must tally the value of the cards. The values of the cards are as follows: ace = 11, face cards = 10, and face value for the rest. After adding the values of the cards, the elder calls out the number. The <b>younger</b> may then <b>say</b> [...] "Good", if the elder's value is greater, or [...] "Not good" [...] and the number that wins the point.
