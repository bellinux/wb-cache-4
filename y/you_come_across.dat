500|$|After {{playing the}} game, PC Gamer found little fault with it, {{calling it a}} very {{well-balanced}} game overall. The magazine also was pleased that the game's [...] "production values [...] sky-high", with which GamesRadar agreed, explaining, [...] "It's not often <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>across</b> an RTS with production values this high; every part seems to be polished till it shines."

Praveen of The Hindu gave a {{positive}} review: [...] "Syam Pushkaran, {{in writing the}} revenge story, takes away the usual ingredients of hate and anger, and replaces it with lots of humour, arriving as a torrent in one-liners, in situations {{and even in the}} minute gestures of the characters ... Maheshinte Prathikaram provides clean entertainment, treading new paths in that endeavour. If revenge comes like this, let's have more of it". He praised Pothan's direction and Faasil's performance. Sify also had {{a positive}} review: [...] "It's not often that <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>across</b> such an intelligent comedy that is extremely funny, thoroughly gripping and brilliantly packaged".

Also praising the screenplay, cinematography, and music, the review concluded: [...] "Maheshinte Prathikaram is one of the finest comedies to have happened in Malayalam during recent years".|$|E
500|$|At 32, Grant {{claimed to}} be on the brink of giving up the acting {{profession}} but was surprised by the script of Four Weddings and a Funeral (FWAAF). [...] "If you read as many bad scripts as I did, you'd know how grateful you are when <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>across</b> one where the guy actually is funny," [...] he later recalled. Released in 1994, FWAAF became the highest-grossing British film to date with a worldwide box office in excess of $244million, making Grant an overnight international star.

500|$|Gerstmann noted [...] "a raw {{collection}} of messy operations", while Edge praised the game's [...] "inventiveness" [...] - saying it [...] "makes Soviet Strike" [...] - {{as well as}} the variety added by the games artificial intelligence. The magazine also felt that while the collecting of supplies added strategy to the action, the limited amount restricted the paths the player might take through the level. Another critic said the [...] "real-time, living battlefield enhances the urgency of the missions and the player's involvement" [...] and also noted [...] "practically no load time." [...] GameFan complained of a high difficulty and a steep curve, long levels which return the player to the beginning should he die, infrequent opportunities to repair armour and the enemies' tendency to attack the player from beyond his limited viewpoint, and was thankful for the Saturn version's optional easier difficulty setting. Next Generation also criticised the player's restricted view, calling it the game's [...] "worst problem". One reviewer said revisiting levels to discover missed set pieces aided the game's longevity; Sega Saturn Magazine had [...] "some reservations" [...] about the game's replay-value, with only 5 missions, but said it was [...] "very playable and enjoyable", while another reviewer called it [...] "a load of fun". Gerstmann criticised the poor scrolling, erratic motion and imprecise control, Great Drakon praised the controls, while GameFan noted they had improved in the Saturn version. The reviewer also enjoyed this version's new weaponry. Another reviewer pointed to some [...] "minor flaws", saying the HUD [...] "smacks of 16-bit era graphics"; The game impressed Great Drakons reviewer, who praised the attention to detail and the reviewer found the story convincing. IGN said: [...] "Everything about this game is great. Excuse me for gushing, but when <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>across</b> a game that's as fun to play as Soviet Strike, and great looking, you really sit up and take notice." ...|$|E

[...] On his casting, Peter Jackson was quoted as saying, [...] "Despite the various rumours and speculation surrounding this role, there has only ever been one Bilbo Baggins for us. There are a few times in your career when <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>across</b> an actor who you know was born to play a role, but that was the case as soon as I met Martin Freeman.

2500|$|Bart Simpson's Escape from Camp Deadly has {{received}} mixed to negative reviews. Nintendo Power {{gave it a}} 3.4/5 rating in 1991. UGO Networks gave the game a negative review, commenting that [...] "this uninspired train wreck of a Game Boy title fails on nearly every level, {{but most of all}} simply because it's a snore-fest. It's your basic side-scrolling platformer with little to no connection to the source material and lasts only about few hours at best. During the game <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>across</b> bullies, camp counselors and even a few wild animals, battling them with spitballs, a boomerang and, in the lunchroom level, food. This one is for completists only." [...] Matt Williamson of the Rocky Mountain News gave the game a C+ grade and commented that [...] "Escape from Camp Deadly tries too hard to be a Nintendo game. It's hard, I know, to try to make game graphics more primitive, but please, guys, the more complex you make the graphics, the more confusing a game gets!" [...] However, the Channel 4 video game programme GamesMaster gave the game an 89% rating.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the major}} dietary laws that observant Jews keep of Kashruth is that dairy and meat may not be eaten at the same meal. Though it is {{mentioned}} {{many times in the}} Old Testament, Rashi held that it was connected to two major ethical laws in the Jewish heritage from the original Five Books of Moses, which are, first, to respect the mother animal: [...] "You shall not boil a kid in its mother's milk"; and, secondly, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>across</b> a bird's nest beside the road, either in a tree or on the ground, and the mother is sitting on the young or on the eggs, do not take the mother with the young."
