It is also used to indicate to an oncoming vehicle to either stop or give way in narrow lanes.|$|E

Using it to indicate that you are coming through and the other driver must wait, could lead to an accident.|$|E

6000|$|... "I--I wish <b>you</b> would <b>go</b> <b>first</b> of all {{and tell}} my cousin, Happy Jack the Gray Squirrel," [...] said Chatterer, {{speaking}} in a hesitating way.|$|R
2500|$|Pay as <b>you</b> <b>go</b> (PAYG, <b>first</b> called 'prepay') {{launched}} on London Underground, DLR, and {{the parts of}} National Rail where Underground fares had previously been valid. (January 2004) ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Thank you, my love,' said Mr Chuzzlewit. 'But I {{am afraid}} I must take Tom {{a little out}} of the way, on business. Suppose <b>you</b> <b>go</b> on <b>first,</b> my dear?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You must fetch me {{from the}} Opera House," [...] Louise insisted. [...] "It is a bargain. I have {{suffered}} enough neglect at your hands. One thing, David,--where do <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>first</b> from here?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Neck or nothing, by all means," [...] said Noel Vanstone, briskly--"on the {{understanding}} that <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>first.</b> I have no scruples about keeping Lecount in the dark. But she is devilish cunning, Mr. Bygrave. How is it to be done?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "His time is inexhaustible; he {{has nothing}} under the sun to do. Have you, Rowland? If you had seen the big hole I have been making in it! Where will <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>first?</b> You have your choice--from the Scala Santa to the Cloaca Maxima." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, {{you told}} me so yourself--that <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>first</b> to the only lodging in which your wife had been known as Mrs. Manston, and when you found that the lodging-house-keeper had gone away and died, and that nobody else in the street had any {{definite}} ideas as to your wife's personal appearance, and came and proposed the arrangement we carried out--that I should personate her. Your taking all this trouble shows that something more serious than love {{had to do with}} the matter.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well said, boy, I must be moving, or the mud will dry on me, and I shall {{stand here}} as though I were turned to stone by the Gorgon's head! So have with <b>thee!</b> <b>Go</b> on <b>first,</b> master hawk-tamer. What will bear thee will bear me!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I thought so. Now, you {{understand}} you can't try {{anything of that}} kind HERE. If you do, up <b>you</b> <b>go</b> on the <b>first</b> tree. That's Rule 1." ...|$|R
6000|$|Jimmy Skunk chuckled. [...] "I guess you've {{forgotten}} that other old saying, 'Age before beauty,' Unc' Billy," [...] said he. [...] "So <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>first.</b> You {{know you are}} older than I. I couldn't think of being so impolite as to go first. I really couldn't think of such a thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not at all," [...] {{retorted}} the cook; [...] "whin there's {{dirty work}} to be done, I most usually kape modestly in the background, an' lets <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>first,</b> bekase it's your nat'ral callin'. Arrah! the sun's goin' to set, boys," [...] he added with a sigh, as he commenced to smoke.|$|E
6000|$|... "What? Changed your mind, have you, Mr. Weathercock? Well, {{it is the}} {{prerogative}} of all feminine natures--but, your doublet is awry, and allow me to {{suggest that you should}} brush your hair. There, that's better; now, come on. No, <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>first,</b> if you please, I'd rather have you in front of me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, of course; you'll be {{near her}} here, as you say: come at six, then. By the bye, couldn't <b>you</b> <b>go</b> to Anty <b>first,</b> {{so that we}} won't be {{disturbed}} over our punch?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That comes," [...] Immelan replied. [...] "Soon {{you shall}} all know why I have come! Let me {{speak to my}} friend Shan for a moment. I carry your poison in my veins, {{but there is a}} chance--just a chance," [...] he added slowly, with a horrible smile upon his lips, [...] "that <b>you</b> may <b>go</b> <b>first,</b> after all." ...|$|R
6000|$|But Mr. Prendergast was {{accustomed}} to have his own way. [...] "I should prefer that <b>you</b> should <b>go</b> <b>first,</b> sir. And to tell the truth, Mr. Fitzgerald, what I {{have to say to}} you will take some time. It is of much importance, to yourself and to others; and I fear that you will probably find that it will detain you from your amusement to-day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ''Tis true, and {{you shall}} find it so. I {{have no more}} words to waste. Stand from the door. Kate, do <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>first.</b> Lay not a hand on her, or on that woman, or on me, or so much a brush their {{garments}} as they pass you by!--You let them pass, and he blocks the door again!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But the {{prospect}} did not please. 'Just cut out this prince stuff,' I told him. 'It isn't what it's {{cracked up to}} be. <b>You</b> <b>go</b> <b>first,</b> and I'll never tell on you.' 'Not alone the living must we please,' he admonished, 'but, more so, the dead must we please. Nor can we lie to the dead.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Doing?--Why {{anything}}, my dear Miles, {{that can}} be useful--I say, boy, {{do you think she}} looks anything like me? When you get nearer, if you should think so, just hold up a hand as a signal, that I may not be taken by surprise. Yes, yes; <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>first,</b> and I'll follow; and as for 'doing,' why, you know, I can hold this bloody horse." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mr John,' said Mr Dombey, {{referring}} to his watch, and assuming his hat and gloves. 'Take my sister, if you please: my arm today is Miss Tox's. <b>You</b> had better <b>go</b> <b>first</b> with Master Paul, Richards. Be very careful.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>go</b> in the <b>first</b> boat, monsieur, {{with the}} ladies," [...] the captain said. [...] "The sooner you are ashore the better. There is no saying whether {{we may not}} be {{disturbed}} and obliged to run out to sea again at a moment's notice." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{never thought}} of that," [...] Tom said, looking at his watch. [...] "Of course it has stopped. We must guess as near as we can; at any rate, <b>you</b> <b>go</b> to sleep <b>first,</b> and, when I am too sleepy to keep watch any longer, I will wake you up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She mustn’t go," [...] said Flower, at length. [...] "I’ll go {{down and}} see her to-morrow night. <b>You</b> <b>go</b> <b>first</b> and break the news to her, and I’ll follow on. Do it gently, Jack. It’s quite safe; there’s nobody she can talk to now; she’s left the Wheelers, and I’m simply longing to see her. You don’t {{know what it is}} to be in love, Jack." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Dunlop, you are {{the younger}} man, so I will hand him over to you. I will put this coil of rope round my neck, and will take the water and food. It is so dark now {{that they will not}} see us from below. If those fellows had but waited half an hour we could have gained the top without this sad business. Will <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>first,</b> Dunlop?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am going}} {{to the left of}} the village, Fergus, and shall make for the battery, which we must retake. Do <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>first</b> into Hochkirch, and see how matters go there. If badly, give my order to the colonel of the first {{battalion}} that comes along, and tell him to throw himself into the village and assist to hold it to the last. After that, you must be guided by circumstances. It is doubtful if you will ever find me again, in this black mist." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The rest {{ought to}} do all of you a power of good," [...] came from his father. [...] "I declare, {{it seems to me you}} have been on the jump ever since <b>you</b> <b>first</b> <b>went</b> to Putnam Hall." ...|$|R
6000|$|The blood {{rushed into}} his face. But he quickly {{collected}} himself, and said hurriedly, [...] "All right, I had forgotten it. Let the d----d sneak go. We've got what's {{a thousand times}} better in this claim at Marshall's, and it's well that he isn't in it to scoop the lion's share. Only we must not waste time getting there now. <b>You</b> <b>go</b> there <b>first,</b> and at once, and set those rascals to work. I'll follow you before Marshall comes up. Get; I'll settle up here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am {{sure you}} must be very tired,' said the mama, turning to Miss Snevellicci. 'I cannot think of {{allowing}} <b>you</b> to <b>go,</b> without <b>first</b> taking a glass of wine. Fie, Charlotte, I am ashamed of you! Miss Lane, my dear, pray see to the children.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well, then, as we {{know exactly}} the direction, and as the {{distance}} is but twelve feet, it ought not to take us very long to chop out a passage just big enough and high enough for one to crawl through. When we get near {{the place where we}} think it is, we must make the tunnel a good bit higher, for the bottom of the meat was quite five feet from the ground so that it should be well out of reach of the dogs. Now, will <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>first</b> or shall I?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Ralph, do <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>first,</b> since I am {{lighter and}} can climb up {{by means of}} the strap, which you can hold from above; push the bar out and lay it down quietly on the {{thickness}} of the wall. A splash might attract the attention of the sentries, though I doubt whether it would, for the wind is high and the rain falling fast. Unbuckle the strap before you move the bar, as otherwise it might fall and I should have difficulty in handing it to you again. Now, I am steady against the wall." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, I shall {{want to go}} by and by myself," [...] said Mr. George, [...] "and I don't want to {{have any}} trouble in finding the way. But you like finding your way about. Now, I wish you would take a carriage, and go and take the ladies on an {{excursion}} along the bay to the westward, and show them Virgil's Tomb, and the Grotto of Posilipo, and Pozzuoli, where the apostle Paul landed on his famous journey to Rome, and the temple of Serapis, half under water, and the great amphitheatre, and the Solfatara, which is the crater of a volcano almost extinct. All these things lie pretty near together along {{the shores of the}} bay to the westward of Naples, and you can go and see them in one afternoon, they say. If <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>first,</b> you will find out all about the excursion, and what we do about guides and custodians at the different places; and then, when I get ready, you can go again and take me, and I shall not have any trouble about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes;--I understand; {{but about}} our marriage. It {{may be that}} <b>you</b> should <b>go</b> out <b>first.</b> I would not be unmaidenly, Walter; but {{remember}} this--the sooner the better, if I can be a comfort to you;--but I can bear any delay rather than be a clog upon you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>go</b> out <b>first,</b> Master Aylmer," [...] the {{silversmith}} said. [...] "I {{have no fear}} {{of anyone}} watching behind, for {{it is not likely}} that any of them know of this entrance to my house; still, it is as well to make certain. When {{you get out of the}} lane you had best stay there until the others have passed on, then you can follow them. We will wait for a few minutes after they have gone, and lock the door behind us. You have not forgotten where you are to find us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I did injure you--" [...] As {{she spoke}} she rose again from her seat, showing how {{impossible}} {{to her was}} that tranquillity which she had attempted to maintain. [...] "I did injure you, but the injury came to you early in life, and sat lightly on you. Within a few months you had learned to love this young lady at the place <b>you</b> <b>went</b> to--the <b>first</b> young lady you saw! I had not done you much harm, Harry. But that which you have done me cannot be undone." ...|$|R
