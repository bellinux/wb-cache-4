6000|$|... "Oh! Of all things, <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{not deserve}} that! If there were nobody {{else to be}} considered, why, under the {{circumstances}} [...] ." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well." [...] Judicious pause. [...] "I should hardly {{call myself}} a Nartist, <b>you</b> <b>know.</b> <b>I</b> <b>DO</b> paint a little. And sketch, you know--skitty kind of things." ...|$|E
60|$|RIDGEON [quivering] Oh, <b>dont.</b> <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not <b>know</b> <b>you</b> were here.|$|R
60|$|MRS TARLETON. Now dont be rude, Johnny: <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>dont</b> like it. [To Gunner] A {{cup of tea}} {{will pick}} you up.|$|R
60|$|THE GENERAL. My dear Lesbia: <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>dont</b> {{wish to be}} impertinent; {{but these}} are not the correct views for an English lady to express.|$|R
6000|$|Miss T. (Shortly.) No! I don't {{want any}} of your charity-dances. You only ask me because Mamma told you to. I hop and I bump. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>do!</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! <b>you</b> <b>know.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{love her}} so dearly. I shall never be {{contented}} to love any one else as your wife--not {{to love her}} really, really with all my heart." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I must. Things can't go on {{like this}} any longer. Anne, I love you. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> I--I can't tell you how much. Will you promise me that some day you'll be my wife?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That's my scrimping!' said Matilda in a {{delightful}} gush. 'I <b>know</b> <b>you</b> won't be offended when <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> it to save against a rainy day!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Duke, <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> {{never meant}} health; <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not," [...] {{and then a}} pang shot across her as she remembered her past {{contempt}} of him whom she now reverenced.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{never said}} so. When we were joking, I {{said he was}} old. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not mean {{that he was too}} old to get married. Men a great deal older get married every day.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Dear Laura, <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not ridicule you. You know I {{love you}} for what you are doing. Would not I do the same, and fight for him down to my nails if I had a brother?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Flora, [...] "I don't wish {{to think}} so. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not hear Norman himself, and when papa gives his vehement {{accounts}} of things, it always puzzles {{us of the}} cooler-minded sort." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Rube laughed. 'I am {{big enough}} {{to get out of}} it if it <b>does,</b> Seth; but <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> feel {{uncommon}} soft toward Pepita, and really thought of marrying and taking her back to Missouri.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "So {{you have}} brought the young woman here at last, Mr. Stubbs. I {{expected}} you some time since. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not wish such persons to remain in custody a moment without some inquiry into their situation." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am for in-door nature myself,' said Lord Eskdale. 'Do <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{not half}} {{like the way}} Monmouth is going on? He never gets out of that villa of his. He should change his air more. Tell him.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It depends so much {{upon what}} you can do, <b>you</b> <b>know.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know you {{sufficiently}} {{to be able to}} say what natural gifts you have." [...] They were walking slowly across the lawn in the direction of the house.|$|E
60|$|BELLA.--Oh, {{something}} dreadful! <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>do!</b> <b>I</b> {{heard you}} say it to the cabman.|$|R
6000|$|... "Say, Saxon, <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> want a boy {{like the}} very dickens... well, I don't care now. I think I'm set {{just as hard}} on a girl, an', well, here's hopin' the next will be called... you wouldn't mind, would you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Did {{you think}} I loved <b>you?</b> Did <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not? Did <b>you</b> ever care, Man! for my heart, or propose to {{yourself}} {{to win the}} worthless thing? Was there any poor pretence of any in our bargain? Upon your side, or on mine?' ...|$|R
6000|$|He stamped {{his foot}} upon the floor, and then jumped {{up from his}} seat. [...] "I hate {{all that sort of}} twaddle about childhood's friends, and <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> You'll make me swear that I'll never come into this room again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, Kate, {{let us have}} no {{reference}} to the invalid of the family any more. I am getting quite strong. Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> believe that poverty is doing my health good; my appetite is improving. I really feel quite hungry now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well. But, Miss Thorne, if {{you like}} boiled fowl better, {{with a little bit}} of ham, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> hope you'll say so. And there's lamb in the house, quite beautiful; now do 'ee say something; do 'ee, Miss Thorne." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; and <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{not so much}} {{object to}} your saying it as to your {{thinking}} it, for <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not force myself on your notice; {{it was you who}} sought my acquaintance and won my confidence; and that you, above all others, should think of me in this way!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I passed {{within five}} {{miles of the}} camp.

6000|$|... "Boom!" [...] {{came the}} ironclad's gunshot like a command. [...] "Bang!"

6000|$|... "I cannot do it. What should I say to her? I {{think that}} she is wrong in what she is doing; thoroughly, {{absolutely}} wrong. She has got about her a parcel of lawyers.

6000|$|... "My father, {{you sent}} for me," [...] said Alice, in her sweet and harp-like voice.
