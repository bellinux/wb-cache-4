25|$|After the Drama tour, Yes reconvened in England {{to decide}} the band's next step, {{beginning}} by dismissing Lane as their manager. Horn chose to leave Yes {{to pursue a career}} in music production, with White and Squire next to depart. Left as the sole remaining members, Downes and Howe opted not to continue with the group and went their own separate ways in December 1980. A live compilation album of Yes performances from 1976 to 1978, mixed in mid-1979 and originally intended for release in late 1979, was released as Yesshows, peaking at number 22 in the UK charts and number 43 in the US. An announcement came from the group's management in March 1981 confirming that <b>Yes</b> <b>no</b> longer existed.|$|E
50|$|While Modern English has a two-form {{system of}} <b>yes</b> and <b>no</b> for affirmatives and negatives, earlier forms of English had a four-form system, {{comprising}} the words yea, , <b>yes,</b> and <b>no.</b> In essence, <b>yes</b> and <b>no</b> were {{the responses to}} a question posed in the negative, whereas yea and nay were the responses to positively framed questions.|$|R
5000|$|Watts classifies <b>yes</b> and <b>no</b> as {{grammatical}} particles, {{in particular}} response particles. He also notes {{their relationship to}} the interjections [...] and , which is that the interjections can precede <b>yes</b> and <b>no</b> but not follow them. Oh as an interjection expresses surprise, but in the combined forms oh <b>yes</b> and oh <b>no</b> merely acts as an intensifier; but ah in the combined forms ah <b>yes</b> and ah <b>no</b> retains its standalone meaning, of focusing upon the previous speaker's or writer's last statement. The forms *yes oh, *yes ah, *no oh, and *no ah are grammatically ill-formed. Aijmer similarly categorizes the <b>yes</b> and <b>no</b> as response signals or reaction signals.|$|R

On 2 April, Kekal announced that a download-only EP would be released in June or July, and would contain two brand new tracks recorded in 2011, as well as separate guitar and vocal tracks of [...] "Tabula Rasa" [...] {{for the purpose of}} remixing by the general public. On 26 April, Jeff uploaded a music video for the song [...] "Futuride" [...] from the upcoming EP, which was promised to be released in July. The official release date for the album, 10 July 2011, was announced over Facebook on 23 June 2011. The title of the EP was Futuride EP, and three tracks from the album were made available for public use under Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share Alike license. On 24 February 2012, Kekal announced the title of its ninth studio album, Autonomy, and the album was released on 19 December 2012, first as a limited, hand-numbered deluxe-edition double-CD with the 2008 album Audible Minority (which was previously never released on CD) added as a bonus disc.

[...] In an interview prior to filming, Slade explained that the illustrations of the graphic novel's illustrator, Ben Templesmith, would be reflected in production design. Slade also considered Nelson's draft {{to be the most}} faithful to the graphic novel. He also stated his intention to make a [...] "scary vampire film", of which he didn't think there were many. [...] "The rest of them, they fall into all kinds of traps. We're {{going to try to do}} our best... and one of the ways we have to do it is be more naturalistic than the graphic novel, because it's very over-the-top," [...] said Slade. [...] There was also concern expressed that while the vampires needed to communicate, talking might lessen the effect. To counter this, a fictional vampire language, with click consonants, was constructed with the help of a professor of linguistics and the nearby University of Auckland. [...] Slade explained [...] "we designed this really simple language that didn't sound like any particular accent that you would be aware of, that was based around really simple actions, eating, hunting, <b>yes,</b> <b>no,</b> really basic, because that's what vampires do." ...|$|E
40|$|We analyze what {{functions}} as a YES response and a NO response for different yes/no questions. This problem is surprisingly complex: respondents do not always produce overt <b>yes</b> or <b>no</b> lexical items {{in response to a}} yes/no question. In addition, when respondents don't include a clear <b>yes</b> or <b>no</b> word, they may mean to communicate a clear <b>YES</b> or <b>NO</b> meaning, or something else. We find that the classification of yes/no questions described in (Carletta et al., 1995) for the Edinburgh map task corpus correlates well with whether a response will be a bare <b>yes</b> or <b>no,</b> a <b>yes</b> or <b>no</b> plus additional speech, or just speech without an overt <b>yes</b> or <b>no.</b> Correlation with responses described simply as as "direct" or "indirect" is less good. We also find that, under the three-way categorization, the strength of a question's expectation for a YES response predicts the form of the response. 1 Introduction In order to model dialogue, it is necessary to understand what kinds of utterances are likely to occur in [...] ...|$|R
