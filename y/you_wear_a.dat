"The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe" [...] {{was written}} by head writer and {{executive}} producer Steven Moffat, who {{wanted it to be}} [...] "the most Christmassy Christmas special ever". He stated that [...] "nothing is more fun to write" [...] than the Doctor at Christmas, as he considered it [...] "his kind of day. Everything's bright and shiny, everybody's having a laugh, and nobody minds if <b>you</b> <b>wear</b> <b>a</b> really stupid hat". The story is partly inspired by The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (from The Chronicles of Narnia) by C. S. Lewis. Moffat said that Doctor Who and the Narnia stories [...] "come from the same impulse that children have of escaping to another world." ...|$|E
500|$|Portman and Kunis started {{training}} {{six months}} before the start of filming in order to attain a body type and muscle tone more similar to those of professional dancers. Portman worked out for five hours a day, doing ballet, cross-training, and swimming. A few months closer to filming, she began choreography training. Kunis engaged in cardio and Pilates, [...] "train seven days a week, five hours, for five, six months total, and ... was put on a very strict diet of 1,200 calories a day." [...] She lost 20 pounds from her normal weight of about 117 pounds, and reported that Portman [...] "became smaller than I did." [...] Kunis said, [...] "I did ballet as a kid like every other kid does ballet. <b>You</b> <b>wear</b> <b>a</b> tutu and you stand on stage and you look cute and twirl. But this is very different because you can't fake it. You can't just stay in there and like pretend you know what you're doing. Your whole body has to be structured differently." [...] Georgina Parkinson, a ballet mistress from the American Ballet Theatre (ABT), coached the actors in ballet. ABT soloists Sarah Lane and Maria Riccetto served as [...] "dance doubles" [...] for Portman and Kunis respectively. Dancer Kimberly Prosa also served as a double for Portman. She stated: [...] "Natalie took class, she studied for several months, from the waist up is her. Sarah Lane a soloist at ABT, did the heavy tricks, she did the fouettés, but they only had her for a limited time, a couple of weeks, so I did the rest of whatever dance shots they needed." ...|$|E

50|$|Nowadays, it is {{considered}} to be a gently derogatory comment, that can be used to a friend. An example might be 'Why are <b>you</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>a</b> coat? That's a bit nesh isn't it?'.|$|R
2500|$|Stanley Kubrick's 1987 film Full Metal Jacket {{features}} an underlying theme about the duality of man throughout {{the action and}} dialogue of the film. One scene plays out this way: A Colonel asks a soldier, [...] "You write 'Born to Kill' on your helmet and <b>you</b> <b>wear</b> <b>a</b> peace button. What's that supposed to be, some kind of sick joke?" [...] To which the soldier replies, [...] "I think I was trying to suggest something about the duality of man, sir... The Jungian thing, sir." ...|$|E
2500|$|On New Year's Day 2004, Michael Keaton, who {{had been}} a stagehand on Mister Rogers' Neighborhood before {{becoming}} an actor, hosted the PBS TV special Fred Rogers: America's Favorite Neighbor. It was released on DVD September 28 that year. [...] To mark what would have been his 80th birthday, Rogers' production company sponsored several events to memorialize him, including [...] "Won't <b>You</b> <b>Wear</b> <b>a</b> Sweater Day", during which fans and neighbors were asked to wear their favorite sweaters in celebration. The event takes place annually on his birthday, March 20.|$|E
2500|$|As {{she came}} from a strong legal background, her family [...] "weren't wildly happy" [...] about her desire to become an actress: [...] "My parents were always making me watch Rumpole of the Bailey, going 'You see? It’s just like acting, you make things up, <b>you</b> <b>wear</b> <b>a</b> wig and a funny outfit. Why not the law?' But I just always, always wanted to act, {{as far back as}} I remember." [...] Her joining the Royal Shakespeare Company though, finally won her parents over. However, in a 2004 {{interview}} Oberman noted that her father's death seven years earlier prevented his seeing the development of her career and her national success as an actor: [...] "I've {{come a long way in}} my career since he died and I wish he was here to see it. He was a big EastEnders fan so I know he'd be very, very proud of me." ...|$|E

Time has not changed your lovliness, you’re just as sweet to me,I love you yet, I can’t forget the days that used to be. CHORUSWhen <b>you</b> <b>wore</b> <b>a</b> tulip, a sweet yellow tulip, and I <b>wore</b> <b>a</b> big red rose,When you caressed me, ‘twas then Heaven blessed me, what a blessing, no one knows. You made life cheerie, when you called me dearie, ‘twas down where the blue grass grows,Your lips were sweeter than julep, when <b>you</b> <b>wore</b> that tulip and I <b>wore</b> <b>a</b> big red rose. When rose. VERSE 2 The love you vowed to cherish has not faltered thro’ the years,You banish all my fears, your voice like music cheers,You are the same sweet girl I knew in happy days of old,Your hair is silver, but your heart is gold,Red roses blush no longer in your cheeks so sweet and fair,It seems to me, dear, I can see white roses {{blooming}} there.
