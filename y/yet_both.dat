5|$|The most {{commonly}} recurring debate in primatology during the 1970s, 1980s, and early 2000s concerned the phylogenetic position of tarsiers compared to both simians {{and the other}} prosimians. Tarsiers are most often placed in either the suborder Haplorhini with the simians or in the suborder Prosimii with the strepsirrhines. Prosimii {{is one of the}} two traditional primate suborders and is based on evolutionary grades (groups united by anatomical traits) rather than phylogenetic clades, while the Strepsirrhini-Haplorrhini taxonomy was based on evolutionary relationships. <b>Yet</b> <b>both</b> systems persist because the Prosimii-Anthropoidea taxonomy is familiar and frequently seen in the research literature and textbooks.|$|E
5|$|<b>Yet</b> <b>both</b> {{reflect an}} inseparable {{integrity}} and regard for accuracy and truth, {{expressed in terms}} both of historical events and of a tradition of Christian faith that continues to the present day. Bede, like Gregory the Great whom Bede quotes on the subject in the Historia, felt that faith brought about by miracles was a stepping stone to a higher, truer faith, and {{that as a result}} miracles had their place in a work designed to instruct.|$|E
5|$|The SEAD {{campaign}} was halted, but although the IAF possessed no operational {{answer to the}} massive air defence array forming west of the Canal, it nevertheless still enjoyed supremacy in the air-ro-air arena. On July 30, 69 Squadron took part in Operation Rimon 20, a ruse designed to draw Soviet-flown MiG-21s into battle. In the ensuing dogfight, five Soviet fighters were downed, of which one was shot down by Avihu Ben-Nun with Shaul Levi and another by Aviem Sella with Reuven Reshef. With no side securing a clear advantage, <b>yet</b> <b>both</b> able to claim military achievements, American pressure soon bore fruit and a ceasefire marking {{the end of the}} war came into effect on August 7, 1970.|$|E

5|$|With A Company {{providing}} fire support, B Company assaulted {{the position}} at 15:35 with artillery, air strikes and armour in support. From the outset the lead elements came under constant Viet Cong sniper {{fire from the}} trees, and from machine-guns that had not previously been detected by the Australians. The assault soon faltered with steadily increasing casualties as the Viet Cong resisted strongly, withstanding multiple frontal assaults, including bayonet charges by two separate platoons. Surrounded and receiving fire from all sides, the lead Australian elements from B Company could advance no further against a determined and well dug-in force, and all attempts to regain momentum were unable to dislodge the defenders. Initially the Australians had used their APCs to secure the landing zone at the jungle's edge, however with the infantry in trouble they were subsequently dispatched as a relief force. Fighting their way forward, the M113s finally arrived by 18:15 and began loading the most badly wounded as darkness approached. The Viet Cong subsequently launched two successive counter-attacks, <b>yet</b> <b>both</b> were repulsed by the Australians. During the fighting one of the APCs was subsequently disabled by a recoilless rifle at close range, killing the driver.|$|E

25|$|The Spanish-Ottoman truce of 1581 quieted the Mediterranean {{rivalry between}} these two world powers. Spain kept a few of its Maghriban presidios and ports (e.g., Melilla and Oran). <b>Yet</b> <b>both</b> Spanish and Ottoman Empires had become preoccupied elsewhere. The Ottomans would claim {{suzerainty}} over Tunisia {{for the next three}} centuries; however, its effective political control in the Maghrib would prove to be of short duration.|$|E
25|$|The {{airport is}} located in {{uncontrolled}} airspace. The tower is manned on days and times with flights. Due to the language barrier, there is no radio communication between the helicopters and heliport on the one side, and Svalbard Airport, Longyear on the other. <b>Yet</b> <b>both</b> airport and helicopters have radios to communicate at Longyearbyen's frequency.

25|$|US {{carriers}} and their fighters shot {{down more than}} 1,900 suicide aircraft during Operation Kikusui (the last and largest Kamikaze attack in the Okinawa campaign), versus a mere 75 for the British, <b>yet</b> <b>both</b> forces suffered {{the same number of}} serious hits (four), on their carriers. However the kamikazes made 173 strikes against other USN targets and the 4 USN carriers suffered a massive death toll, in contrast to the relatively light casualties on the RN carriers.|$|E
25|$|While a morale {{boosting}} achievement, Rimon 20 did {{not change}} the course of the war. Another IAF F-4 Phantom was lost to an SA-3 on August 3 and another damaged. The new level of escalation, however, proved too ominous for all involved. Neither Israel nor Egypt could secure a clear advantage, <b>yet</b> <b>both</b> could claim military achievements. American pressure to end a conflict with the potential to draw in both the United States and the USSR soon bore fruit. On August 7, 1970, a ceasefire agreement came into effect, ending the War of Attrition.|$|E
25|$|The defendants' radical {{politics}} {{may have}} played a role in the verdict. Judge Thayer, though a sworn enemy of anarchists, warned the defense against bringing anarchism into the trial. Yet defense attorney Fred Moore felt he had to call both Sacco and Vanzetti as witnesses to let them explain why they were fully armed when arrested. Both men testified that they had been rounding up radical literature when apprehended, and that they had feared another government deportation raid. <b>Yet</b> <b>both</b> hurt their case with rambling discourses on radical politics that the prosecution mocked. The prosecution also brought out that both men had fled the draft by going to Mexico in 1917.|$|E

25|$|Kelley's most {{elaborate}} crossover was only partially successful. He sought to crossover {{an episode of}} his Picket Fences with Chris Carter's The X-Files. Both shows aired Friday nights, but on different networks. The intent was to begin the story on one show, then hope viewers would switch channels to watch the conclusion on another network. CBS balked, and both scripts were rewritten, with The X-Files Fox Mulder no longer set to appear on Picket Fences. <b>Yet,</b> <b>both</b> episodes deal with Wisconsin and cows, with Fences referencing an FBI investigation in a neighboring town. CBS blurred the connection further by postponing the Fences episode by one week.|$|E
25|$|For PiÅsudski, this {{alliance}} {{gave his}} campaign for the MiÄdzymorze federation the legitimacy of joint international effort, secured part of the Polish eastward border, and laid a foundation for a Polish-dominated Ukrainian state between Russia and Poland. For Petlura, this was the final chance to preserve the statehood and, at least, the theoretical independence of the Ukrainian heartlands, even while accepting the loss of West Ukrainian lands to Poland. <b>Yet</b> <b>both</b> of them were opposed at home. PiÅsudski faced stiff opposition from Dmowski's National Democrats who opposed Ukrainian independence. Petlura, in turn, was criticized by many Ukrainian politicians for entering a pact with the Poles and giving up on Western Ukraine.|$|E
25|$|Observations of {{the energy}} levels of atoms and {{molecules}} were inconsistent with the nuclear spin expected from protonâelectron hypothesis. Molecular spectroscopy of dinitrogen (14N2) showed that transitions originating from even-numbered rotational levels are more intense than those from odd levels, hence the even levels are more populated. According to quantum mechanics and the Pauli exclusion principle, the spin of the 14N nucleus is therefore an integer multiple of Ä§ (the reduced Planck constant). <b>Yet</b> <b>both</b> protons and electrons carry an intrinsic spin of Â½Ä§, {{and there is no}} way to arrange an odd number (14 protons + 7 electrons = 21) of spins Â±Â½Ä§ to give a spin that is an integer multiple of Ä§.|$|E

25|$|The Co-op {{refinery}} was {{a product}} of the Co-operative movement, which began in Britain in the mid-19th century. Frequently expanded and modernized, the Co-op plant (first constructed in 1935) was a small but modern refinery when talk about a refinery/upgrader complex began in the early 1980s. Both the federal and Saskatchewan governments had forbidden their Crown corporations to participate in the project, <b>yet</b> <b>both</b> took part themselves. The province had a particular interest, since an upgrader would increase the market for heavy oil from Saskatchewan's fields. This would give the provincial oil industry an important boost. The federal government saw the project as an opportunity to move the nation one small step towards the stated goal of crude oil self-sufficiency. For its part, the Co-op wanted an assured supply of crude oil for its refinery.|$|E

The Big Brother house was still divided into two {{different}} themed houses <b>yet</b> <b>both</b> equally furnished. Both houses have separate confession rooms. The garden was removed, and the pool was retained and was considered a separate area and was called the Resort. The area was used for some time for Big Brother's rewards and tasks to the housemates, and was a venue for some House Battles. The activity area was retained, and was renovated several times in order to accommodate the season's twists. Initially, it was used as a temporary shelter for the initial group of housemates, and was themed after a typical urban slum house.|$|E
