2500|$|The 1924 Summer Olympics were {{hosted by}} the city of Paris. A devout Christian, Liddell refused to run in a heat held on Sunday (the Christian Sabbath) and was forced to {{withdraw}} from the 100-metres race, his best event. The schedule had been published several months earlier, and his decision was made well before the Games. Liddell spent the intervening months training for the 400 metres, though his best pre-Olympics time of 49.6 seconds, set in winning the 1924 AAA championship 440 yards, was modest by international standards. On the morning of the Olympic 400 metres final, July 11, 1924, Liddell was handed a folded square of paper, a gift from one of the team masseurs. Reading it later he found the message: [...] "In the old book it says: 'He that honours me I will honour.' Wishing <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> success always." [...] Recognising the (slightly misquoted) reference to 1 Samuel 2:30 he was profoundly moved that someone other than his coach believed in him and the stance he had taken.|$|E

She has given <b>thee</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> friends, and thou valuest not the gift of exceeding price until the griefs are past even friendship's cure. O, my father! why did I leave thee?" [...] and he seized Mr. Grey's hand with convulsive grasp.|$|R

6000|$|... 'Bring your comrade over to Kehl,' said Galgenstein, delighted. 'I {{will give}} <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> dinners, and can promise to satisfy both of you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But mighty cast down in sperrits. To misfortunes, madam, look <b>you,</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> us are subject; and a trifling one has {{fell upon}} your son." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; Nina Balatka," [...] said Madame Zamenoy. [...] "We tell <b>you,</b> to <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> our {{knowledge}} at least. At any rate, {{they are not}} here." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "I don't think <b>you</b> see <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> {{her when}} it is that sort of race," [...] said Bowman, {{speaking}} of the slow pace. [...] "I mean she is obviously still good, she wheeled passed them {{at the top of}} the straight and she still let down. But I honestly I think when she gets in a high pressure race, when there is a lot of pace from the start like there was in last year's Cox Plate, that's when <b>you</b> see <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well,' said Elizabeth, smiling, 'I {{know all}} <b>the</b> time that <b>you</b> have <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> argument. It {{would not be}} so if it was not good for us.' ...|$|R
6000|$|They {{were all}} delighted. [...] "Quick," [...] he ordered them, [...] "bring me each of <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> what we have. Gut our house. Be sharp." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm sure I wish <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> luck," [...] he said. [...] "And I'll {{write to}} your chums at Brill, telling them {{of what is}} taking place." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are mistaken, David. I have counted you, {{and always}} hoped to count <b>you,</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> my friends. But I do not love you. I do not love any one." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, I couldn't {{expect to}} find every quality in my husband, could I? It would not be reasonable. I assure you, dear, that taking your tout ensemble, I like <b>you</b> far <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> all. <b>You</b> may not be <b>the</b> handsomest, and <b>you</b> {{may not be the}} cleverest--one cannot expect one's {{absolute}} ideal,--but I love <b>you</b> far, far <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> any.

6000|$|In {{a moment}} the good woman's arms were around her neck. [...] "I always liked <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> the two," [...] she whispered into the ear of the {{astonished}} young lady.|$|E
6000|$|... "And to <b>you,</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> amateur conspirators {{and most}} charming of hosts," [...] he said. [...] "Come soon to England and bring your automobile, {{and we will}} conspire against you with a {{policeman}} and a stopwatch." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Dear Anne,' {{he began}} again, setting down the candle, 'you {{must try to}} forgive me; really you must. I love <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> anybody in the wide, wide world. Try to forgive me; come!' And he imploringly took her hand.|$|E

6000|$|... "That's {{just what}} I wanted to know, Julien," [...] she declared. [...] "Now shake hands, be off, {{and do the}} best you can for yourself. I wish <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> luck, the very best. That's all we can say to one another, isn't it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My friend," [...] the Professor replied, [...] "I wish <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> luck, {{but more}} than {{anything}} else in the world," [...] he added, a little peevishly, [...] "I hope you may bring me back my servant Craig, and leave us both in peace." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I am belated here, good dame, {{and afraid}} of the French. And I will give <b>thee</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> bit <b>of</b> clay on my mare's back,--pot,--pan,--pansion,-- crock,--jug, or what thou wilt, for a night's lodging." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, if you won't take my {{head off}} till I'm done, I'll tell <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> joke <b>of</b> <b>the</b> season. Are <b>you</b> sure <b>the</b> pink domino with Bopp wasn't yourself,--for she looked and acted very like you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mighty sorry I can't go along," [...] said Spouter dolefully. [...] "However, I wish <b>you</b> all <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> luck, {{not only}} in getting some {{information}} about those Germans, but also in locating the foxes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What think ye, Micah?' {{said the}} landlord.

6000|$|... 'You {{have been}} such good {{children}} that I am {{going to send you}} to visit my granny, who lives in a dear little hut in the wood.

6000|$|Again {{the captain}} laughed. [...] "But," [...] he continued, [...] "I'm very fond o' you, Billy, an' there's {{no reason why}} I shouldn't help you, to help yourself. So, if you're willin', I'll send you {{to the best of}} schools, and after that to college, an' give <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> education,--in short, make a man of you, an' put you in the way of makin' your fortune." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Jenny, there's {{an offer}} for your {{boy in the}} fool's cap, and Mysie doubts if she ought to let him go. Well, Mrs. Grinstead, I think <b>you</b> have <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> it. Lookers on, etc." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear sir, {{how good}} this is <b>of</b> <b>you!</b> <b>You</b> present <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> all replies to my letter in {{presenting}} yourself. Mrs. Van Brandt is at home. Mrs. Van Brandt will be delighted. Pray walk in." ...|$|R
