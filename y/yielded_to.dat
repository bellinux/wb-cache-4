5|$|The {{publisher}} <b>yielded</b> <b>to</b> Bauer for the 1912 edition; he {{was again}} illustrating his own book. Printing techniques {{had also been}} updated and the pictures could be printed in three colors: black, yellow and blue. With this technical improvement, the prints almost resembled Bauer's original paintings.|$|E
5|$|Beecham {{took the}} {{orchestra}} on a controversial tour of Germany in 1936. Throughout the tour, the orchestra ignored {{the custom of}} playing the Nazi anthem before concerts, but Beecham <b>yielded</b> <b>to</b> pressure from Hitler's government not to play the Italian Symphony by Mendelssohn, taboo to Nazi anti-Semites. There was disquiet {{among some of the}} players that their presence in Germany gave the Nazi regime a propaganda coup.|$|E
25|$|<b>Yield</b> <b>to</b> worst (YTW): when a bond is callable, puttable, exchangeable, or {{has other}} features, the <b>yield</b> <b>to</b> worst {{is the lowest}} <b>yield</b> of <b>yield</b> <b>to</b> maturity, <b>yield</b> <b>to</b> call, <b>yield</b> <b>to</b> put, and others.|$|R
25|$|The {{interest}} payment ("coupon payment") {{divided by the}} current price of the bond is called the current yield (this is the nominal yield multiplied by the par value and divided by the price). There are other yield measures that exist such as the <b>yield</b> <b>to</b> first call, <b>yield</b> <b>to</b> worst, <b>yield</b> <b>to</b> first par call, <b>yield</b> <b>to</b> put, cash flow <b>yield</b> and <b>yield</b> <b>to</b> maturity.|$|R

5|$|Following {{the ill-fated}} 1263 {{expedition}} of Haakon IV of Norway, the Outer Hebrides {{along with the}} Isle of Man, were <b>yielded</b> <b>to</b> the Kingdom of Scotland {{a result of the}} 1266 Treaty of Perth. Although their contribution to the islands can still be found in personal and placenames, the archaeological record of the Norse period is very limited. The best known find from this time is the Lewis chessmen, which date from the mid 12th century.|$|E
5|$|In 1892, Stone was {{convinced}} {{to sit for}} a portrait in sculpture, rendered by Anne Whitney, sculptor and poet. Stone had previously protested the proposed portrait {{for more than a}} year, saying that the funds to engage an artist would be better spent on suffrage work. Stone finally <b>yielded</b> <b>to</b> pressure from Frances Willard, the New England Women's Club and some of her friends and neighbors in the Boston area, and sat while Whitney produced a bust. In February 1893, Stone invited her brother Frank and his wife Sarah to come see the bust, before it was shipped to Chicago for display at the upcoming World's Columbian Exposition.|$|E
5|$|In April 1883 Carvalho finally revived Carmen at the Opéra-Comique, with Adèle Isaac {{featuring}} in an under-rehearsed {{production that}} removed {{some of the}} controversial aspects of the original. Carvalho was roundly condemned by the critics for offering a travesty of what {{had come to be}} regarded as a masterpiece of French opera; nevertheless, this version was acclaimed by the public and played to full houses. In October Carvalho <b>yielded</b> <b>to</b> pressure and revised the production; he brought back Galli-Marié, and restored the score and libretto to their 1875 forms.|$|E

5|$|In January 1322, two Dalmatian towns, Šibenik and Trogir, {{rebelled against}} Mladen II Šubić, {{who was a}} son of Charles's {{one-time}} leading partisan, Paul Šubić. The two towns also accepted the suzerainty of the Republic of Venice although Charles had urged Venice not {{to intervene in the}} conflict between his subjects. Many Croatian lords (including his own brother, Paul II Šubić) also turned against Mladen, and their coalition defeated him at Klis. In September, Charles marched to Croatia where all the Croatian lords who were opposed to Mladen Šubić <b>yielded</b> <b>to</b> him in Knin. Mladen Šubić also visited Charles, but the king had the powerful lord imprisoned.|$|E
5|$|Louis {{assembled}} his armies in Temesvár (now Timișoara in Romania) in February 1365. According a royal charter that year, he {{was planning}} to invade Wallachia because the new voivode, Vladislav Vlaicu, had refused to obey him. However, he ended up heading a campaign against the Bulgarian Tsardom of Vidin and its ruler Ivan Sratsimir, which suggests that Vladislav Vlaicu had in the meantime <b>yielded</b> <b>to</b> him. Louis seized Vidin and imprisoned Ivan Stratsimir in May or June. Within three months, his troops occupied Ivan Stratsimir's realm, which was organized into a separate border province, or banate, under the command of Hungarian lords.|$|E
5|$|Louis sent small expeditions {{one after}} one to Italy at the {{beginning}} of his war against Joanna, because he did not want to harass the Italians who had suffered from a famine the previous year. His first troops departed under the command of Nicholas Vásári, Bishop of Nyitra (now Nitra in Slovakia), on 24 April 1347. Louis also hired German mercenaries. He departed from Visegrád on 11 November. After marching through Udine, Verona, Modena, Bologna, Urbino, and Perugia, he entered the Kingdom of Naples on 24 December near L'Aquila, which had <b>yielded</b> <b>to</b> him.|$|E

His youngest son, Sam, is a hard worker at the mill, but has fallen in with bad companions, and is often absent from home.

5|$|When Rocky was {{diagnosed}} with brain damage, {{it must be noted}} that many athletes have a form of brain damage including football players, soccer players, and other individuals in contact sports such as rugby, etc. Rocky never went for a second opinion and <b>yielded</b> <b>to</b> his wife's wishes to stop. So with the advent of new research techniques into brain damage, Rocky was found to be normal among fighters, and he was suffering the results of a severe concussion. By today's standards Rocky Balboa would be given a clean bill of health for fighters.|$|E
5|$|While Louis's armies were {{fighting}} in Poland {{and against the}} Tatars, Louis marched to Croatia in June 1345 and besieged Knin, the former seat of the late Ivan Nelipac, who had successfully resisted Louis's father, forcing his widow and son to surrender. The Counts of Corbavia and other Croatian noblemen also <b>yielded</b> <b>to</b> him during his stay in Croatia. The citizens of Zadar rebelled against the Republic of Venice and accepted his suzerainty. Louis meanwhile returned to Visegrád. He dispatched Stephen II, Ban of Bosnia, to assist the burghers of Zadar, but the ban did not fight against the Venetians.|$|E

40|$|This note {{comments}} on a misconception that <b>yield</b> <b>to</b> maturity from holding a coupon bond until maturity is only promised, {{but not really}} received, unless coupon payments are reinvested {{at the same rate}} as the (original) <b>yield</b> <b>to</b> maturity. It shows that <b>yield</b> <b>to</b> maturity is always earned no matter how coupon payments are allocated, i. e., whether spent or reinvested at any rate. It illuminates that the realized compounding yield in fact measures the <b>yield</b> <b>to</b> maturity from a combination of two investments rather from simply holding the bond itself until maturity. ...|$|R
5|$|As {{the postwar}} years <b>yielded</b> <b>to</b> the Gilded Age, Troy's {{prosperity}} continued. The wealth created by its industries built {{some of the}} city's most notable Victorian buildings. Frederick Clarke Withers designed First Street's Rice Building in 1871, a five-story flatiron-shaped building representative of his Victorian Gothic style. The Cannon Building got a contemporary mansard roof after two fires. Cummings' 1870 Congregation Berith Sholom Temple on Third Street is among the oldest synagogue buildings still standing in the United States, the oldest Reform synagogue in New York, {{and one of the}} most significant religious buildings in the district from this period. In 1875, George B. Post won a competition to build a new home for the Troy Savings Bank, with an upstairs auditorium. While his building was in the Renaissance Revival style of the time, its forms and decorations anticipated his later work in the Beaux-Arts vein.|$|E
5|$|At Matthias Corvinus' instance, the Diet of Hungary {{abolished}} {{all previous}} exemptions {{relating to the}} tax known as the chamber's profit. The leaders of the Three Nations of Transylvania who regarded the reform as an infringement of their privileges declared on 18 August 1467 that {{they were ready to}} fight to defend their liberties. Stephen promised support to them, but they <b>yielded</b> <b>to</b> Corvinus without resistance after the king marched to Transylvania. Corvinus invaded Moldavia and captured Baia, Bacău, Roman and Târgu Neamț. Stephen assembled his army and launched a crushing defeat on the invaders in the Battle of Baia on 15 December. This episode was presented in contemporary Hungarian chronicles as a defeat of Stephen's armies. However, Corvinus, who received wounds in the battle, could only escape from the battlefield with the help of Moldavian boyars who had joined him. A group of boyars rose up against Stephen in the Lower Country, but he had 20 boyars and 40 other landowners captured and executed {{before the end of the}} year.|$|E
5|$|Counsel for the {{petitioner}} {{discussed at}} great length from a sociological point of view, of the age-old problem of the gambling instinct in the human being. According to his analysis, gambling pervades our entire economic system; thus insurance contracts are a gamble, stock and grain exchange transactions are gambles, and the farmer's dependence on weather is a gamble. Counsel's attempt to apply this analysis to the present case left us cold and unimpressed. He even reminded us that our great idol, Mr. Chief Justice John Marshall, in his day attended the horse races and wagered with his clergyman. In fact, they ran a book. As indicating how times have changed and how even our coarse nature has <b>yielded</b> <b>to</b> the protecting care of governmental policy, we confess we do not even know a bookmaker, clerical or otherwise, and our passes to the beautiful race tracks around Chicago lie in our desk unused.|$|E

5|$|From the mid-13th century onwards Scottish monarchs {{increasingly}} {{sought to}} take control of the islands surrounding the mainland. The process was begun in earnest by Alexander II and was continued by his successor Alexander III. This strategy eventually led to an invasion of Scotland by Haakon Haakonsson, King of Norway. His fleet assembled in Bressay Sound before sailing for Scotland. After the stalemate of the Battle of Largs, Haakon retreated to Orkney, where he died in December 1263, entertained on his deathbed by recitations of the sagas. His death halted any further Norwegian expansion in Scotland and following this ill-fated expedition, the Hebrides and Mann were <b>yielded</b> <b>to</b> the Kingdom of Scotland as a result of the 1266 Treaty of Perth, although the Scots recognised continuing Norwegian sovereignty over Orkney and Shetland.|$|E
5|$|In 1561, Swedish forces {{arrived and}} the noble {{corporations}} of Harrien–Wierland and Jerwen (Järva) <b>yielded</b> <b>to</b> Sweden {{to form the}} Duchy of Estonia. Reval, similarly, accepted Swedish rule. Denmark dominated the Baltic, and Sweden wished to challenge this by gaining territory on the Eastern side of the Baltic. Doing so would help Sweden control the West's trade with Russia. This helped to precipitate the Northern Seven Years' War since in 1561, Frederick II had already protested against Swedish presence in Reval, claiming historical rights relating to Danish Estonia. When Erik XIV's forces seized Pernau in June 1562, his diplomats tried to arrange Swedish protection for Riga, which brought him into conflict with Sigismund.|$|E
5|$|Louis {{marched to}} Dalmatia in July 1357. Split, Trogir, and Šibenik soon {{got rid of}} Venetian {{governors}} and <b>yielded</b> <b>to</b> Louis. After a short siege, Louis's army also captured Zadar {{with the assistance of}} its townspeople. Tvrtko I of Bosnia, who had succeeded Louis's father-in-law in 1353, surrendered western Hum to Louis, who claimed that territory as his wife's dowry. In the Treaty of Zadar, which was signed on 18 February 1358, the Republic of Venice renounced all Dalmatian towns and islands between the Gulf of Kvarner and Durazzo in favor of Louis. The Republic of Ragusa also accepted Louis's suzerainty. The Dalmatian towns remained self-governing communities, owing only a yearly tribute and naval service to Louis, who also abolished all commercial restrictions that had been introduced during the Venetians' rule. The merchants of Ragusa were explicitly entitled to freely trade in Serbia even during a war between Hungary and Serbia.|$|E
