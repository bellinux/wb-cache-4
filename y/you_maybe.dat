500|$|In 1993, Mosley {{agreed with}} Balestre that the Frenchman would stand down as {{president}} of the FIA in Mosley's favour, in return for the new role of President of the FIA Senate, to be created after Mosley's election. As well as motorsport, the FIA's remit includes the interests of motorists worldwide, an area in which Mosley wanted to involve himself: [...] "That is what really interested me: [...] <b>you</b> <b>maybe</b> save one life every five years, whereas [...] road safety you are talking about thousands of lives". A challenge to Mosley's election by Jeffrey Rose, chairman of the British Royal Automobile Club, was withdrawn {{when it became clear that}} the majority of voters were already committed to Mosley. The FISA was then merged into the FIA as its sporting arm.|$|E
2500|$|Owen Gleiberman of Variety {{called the}} film [...] "an extravagant and witty follow-up, {{made with the}} same {{friendly}} virtuosic dazzle… and just obligatory enough {{to be too much}} of a good thing." [...] He cautioned that [...] "this time you can sense just how hard [...] is working to entertain <b>you.</b> <b>Maybe</b> a little too hard." [...] Mike Ryan at Uproxx noted the continued sense of humor and tone from the first film, and appreciated Gunn's difference in overall structure in the sequel (which he compared to The Empire Strikes Back). Ryan was positive of the cast, particularly Rooker in his expanded role as [...] "the heart" [...] of the film. Writing for Rolling Stone, Peter Travers called the film a [...] "blast" [...] and gave it three stars out of four, praising the film for its tone and fun, soundtrack, and characters. He noted that [...] "Vol. 2 can't match the sneak-attack surprise of its predecessor… the followup, while taking on some CGI bloat and sequel slickness, hasn't lost its love for inspired lunacy. Chicago Sun-Timess Richard Roeper also gave the film three stars, writing, [...] "Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 isn't quite as much fun, not quite as clever, not quite as fresh as the original—but it still packs a bright and shiny and sweet punch." [...] Roeper continued that [...] "even with all the silliness and all the snarkiness, the Guardians can put a lump in your throat", and praised the cast, especially Rooker, with [...] "one of the best roles in the movie".|$|E

2500|$|Brown {{began the}} 2011–12 season {{on a line}} with newly {{acquired}} center Mike Richards, but was shuffled throughout the lineup {{for most of the}} season. He maintained his consistent production, topping 20 goals and 50 points for the fifth-straight year. Along {{with the rest of the}} Kings, however, he struggled to score in the first half of the season. Head Coach Terry Murray was fired midway through the season, and as the Kings fell further out of the playoff picture, they were rumored to be listening to trade offers for Brown. New coach Darryl Sutter called the Brown-Kopitar tandem [...] "stale" [...] and said Brown was not playing the [...] "straight-line, up-and-down, go-to-the-net, shoot-the-puck, run-over-people" [...] style Brown needed to be effective. Brown's scoring pace picked up amidst the trade rumors, and he scored three goals and an assist in the last game before the NHL trade deadline, a 4–0 win over the Chicago Blackhawks. The Kings held on to Brown, who responded with 11 points in the nine games following the trade deadline. Brown later said that he was playing with [...] "a chip on his shoulder" [...] and [...] "whether those rumors are true or not, they're still out there, it gives <b>you</b> <b>maybe</b> a bit more motivation." [...] With Brown producing and the trade-deadline acquisition of Jeff Carter, the Kings were one of the highest-scoring NHL teams down the stretch and made the playoffs as an eighth seed. After moving up-and-down the lineup for most of the year, Brown found stability playing on the first line with Anže Kopitar and Justin Williams. That line would remain intact throughout the entire 2012 Stanley Cup playoffs.|$|E
2500|$|In a June 2017 {{interview}} with Eddie Trunk, Chad Smith {{said he had}} discussions with Flea about how much longer the band could continue touring. [...] "I was like, 'I don't know!' I want to make records, I still love making records, but the touring part... I don't know if we can continue. I mean, three of us are 54 years old – Anthony, me and Flea. Josh is 38 or 39, so he's a young man. But I don't know if {{we can continue to}} do the long tours – the year, year-and-a-half we normally do. That's a good question. We all have families and different things, your priorities shift a little bit. You kinda see that what's gonna work for <b>you</b> <b>maybe</b> doesn't necessarily work for other bands. But again, we're just so grateful that people want to come and see us play, and we love to perform. I don't know in the future how that's gonna look. We pride ourselves in putting out a really amazing performance. You want people to just walk away and be like, 'Wow, I haven't seen anything like that!' and when you can't do that anymore, you gotta really stop and go, 'We're not gonna be sitting on stools up there playing our songs.'"On July 18, 2017 in an {{interview with}} TMZ, Flea said of the band possibly retiring [...] "that's just silly talk. We never look past the immediate future but um, were on tour right now, we're rockin' out, we're feeling the spirit, letting the music move us and to be honest since the day we started this band nearly 35 years ago, i've never ever known what's next or what's around the corner or anything and I think that the power of the band lies in that kinda just staying in the moment and staying with the energy that's moving.|$|E
