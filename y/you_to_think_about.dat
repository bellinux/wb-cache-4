Outside of heavy metal, both the band and its lead singer have inspired {{a diverse group of}} acts, including Avril Lavigne, Charli XCX, Die Antwoord, Eminem, Grimes, Lady Gaga, Lana Del Rey, Lil Uzi Vert, Lisa Marie Presley, Muse, My Chemical Romance, Mykki Blanco, Natalia Kills, Porcelain Black, Skrillex, Skylar Grey and Years & Years. Garbage vocalist Shirley Manson has called Manson an [...] "amazing figure and provocateur and agitator" [...] and said that he was [...] "always challenging <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> the church, to think about sexuality and to think about society in different ways. We just don't have singers like that anymore." [...] Billy Corgan of The Smashing Pumpkins has commended Manson's manipulation of the culture of celebrity, saying: [...] "He's very savvy, in that he lets people think things about him or plays into things to see what will happen, almost like a performance artist. He's a visionary in a way, because he identified a culture that was coming and now that culture is everywhere." ...|$|E

2500|$|At his {{arraignment}} at the District Court of Pittsburg County on June 4, 2002, Duty asked Judge Steven Taylor {{to enter}} a guilty plea to the murder and requested the death penalty, {{against the advice of}} his defense counsel. On October 28 of that year, Duty was deemed competent to enter the plea after court-ordered evaluations by the Carl Albert Community Mental Health Center and Eastern Oklahoma State Hospital. While testifying on his own behalf, Duty declined to present any mitigating evidence and said that he preferred death over spending a life sentence in lockdown 23 hours day. He also wrote to the prosecutor that he would kill again. Mary Wise pleaded to the court to sentence Duty to life in prison without the possibility of parole, stating: [...] "I don't believe he ought to have a choice. I think he ought to sit in that cell and face those four walls and think about what he did {{for the rest of his}} natural-born life. And I hope and pray to God that you live to be 110 years old, because that's how long I want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> what you did." [...] Judge Taylor denied her request, calling Duty a [...] "textbook case for the death penalty". Duty was initially scheduled to be executed on February 24, 2005.|$|E

In an interview with Decibel magazine, Steele explained: [...] "There are no atheists in foxholes, they say, and I was a foxhole atheist for a long time.

6000|$|On {{the next}} morning there came the letter from Miss Lily Dale, and with that in her hand she again went to Miss Prettyman. She must go home, she said. She must at any rate see her mother. Could Miss Prettyman be kind enough to send her home. [...] "I haven't sixpence to pay for anything," [...] she said, {{bursting}} out into tears; [...] "and I haven't a right to ask for it." [...] Then the statements which Miss Prettyman made in her eagerness to cover this latter misfortune were decidedly false. There was so much money owing to Grace, she said; money for this, money for that, money for anything or nothing! Ten pounds would hardly clear the account. [...] "Nobody owes me anything; but if you'll lend me five shillings!" [...] said Grace, in her agony. Miss Prettyman, {{as she made her}} way through this difficulty, thought of Major Grantly and his love. It would have been of no use, she knew. Had she brought them together on that Monday, Grace would have said nothing to him. Indeed such a meeting at such a time would have been improper. But, regarding Major Grantly, as she did, in the light of a millionaire,--for the wealth of the archdeacon was notorious,--she could not but think it a pity that poor Grace should be begging for five shillings. [...] "You need not at any rate trouble yourself about money, Grace," [...] said Miss Prettyman. [...] "What is a pound or two more or less between you and me? It is almost unkind of <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it. Is that letter in your hand anything for me to see, my dear?" [...] Then Grace explained that she did not wish to show Miss Dale's letter, but that Miss Dale had asked her to go to Allington. [...] "And you will go," [...] said Miss Prettyman. [...] "It will be the best thing for you, and the best thing for your mother." ...|$|E

Her husband sat beside her, and let her take the reins from his nerveless grasp; and when they got into {{the shelter of the}} piece of woods that the road passed through he put up his hands to his face, and broke into sobs. She allowed him to weep on, though she kept saying, [...] "Geo'ge, Geo'ge," [...] softly, and {{stroking}} his knee with the hand next him. When his sobbing stopped, she said, [...] "I guess they've had a pleasant visit; but I'm glad we'a together again." [...] He took up her hand and kissed the back of it, and then clutched it hard, but did not speak. [...] "It's strange," [...] she went on, [...] "how I used to be home-sick for father and motha"--she had sometimes lost her Yankee accent in her association with his people, and spoke with their Western burr, but she found it in moments of deeper feeling--"when I was there in Europe, and now I'm glad to have them go.

It's been a strain on you, and now you must throw it all off and rest, and get up your strength. One thing, I could see that fatha noticed the gain you had made since he saw you in New Yo'k.

She's not one to talk a great deal--she always leaves that to father and me--but she's got deep feelings, and she just worshipped the baby!

6000|$|She was now {{old enough}} to {{understand}} how disproportionate a stay she had already made with her father; and also {{old enough to}} enter a little into the ambiguity attending this excess, which oppressed her particularly whenever the question had been touched upon in talk with her governess. [...] "Oh you needn't worry: she doesn't care!" [...] Miss Overmore had often said to her in reference to any fear that her mother might resent her prolonged detention. [...] "She has other people than poor little <b>YOU</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about,</b> and has gone abroad with them; so you needn't be in the least afraid she'll stickle this time for her rights." [...] Maisie knew Mrs. Farange had gone abroad, for she had had weeks and weeks before a letter from her beginning [...] "My precious pet" [...] and taking leave of her for an indeterminate time; but she had not seen in it a renunciation of hatred or of the writer's policy of asserting herself, for the sharpest of all her impressions had been that there was nothing her mother would ever care so much about as to torment Mr. Farange. What at last, however, was in this connexion bewildering and a little frightening was the dawn of a suspicion that a better way had been found to torment Mr. Farange than to deprive him of his periodical burden. This was the question that worried our young lady and that Miss Overmore's confidences and the frequent observations of her employer only rendered more mystifying. It was a contradiction that if Ida had now a fancy for waiving the rights she had originally been so hot about her late husband shouldn't jump at the monopoly for which he had also in the first instance so fiercely fought; but when Maisie, with a subtlety beyond her years, sounded this new ground her main success was in hearing her mother more freshly abused. Miss Overmore had up to now rarely deviated from a decent reserve, but the day came when she expressed herself with a vividness not inferior to Beale's own {{on the subject of the}} lady who had fled to the Continent to wriggle out of her job. It would serve this lady right, Maisie gathered, if that contract, in the shape of an overgrown and underdressed daughter, should be shipped straight out to her and landed at her feet in the midst of scandalous excesses.|$|E
