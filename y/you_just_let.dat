500|$|The {{principal}} photography {{produced a}} high demand for extras as zombies. In {{an interview with}} MTV News, special effects artist Greg Nicotero stated that while anyone was welcome to audition, the producers of the show were looking specifically for people who possessed exceptional height and thin features. Casting for extras took approximately three days. Once accepted, the extras {{would be sent to}} [...] "zombie school" [...] for training and preparing for filming. Nicotero stated that [...] "it was interesting because I initially thought my experience with zombie movies is <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>let</b> them do whatever they want to do. George [...] always said, 'You show 50 people one movement, then you have 50 people doing all the same thing.' So we sort of just lined them up and said, 'Let's see what your zombie walk would look like,' and then they would do it and we would say, 'Try this or try that.' You know, sort of fine tuning everybody." [...] Alongside with Darabont, Nicotero had previously collaborated with Romero on several occasions, and looked at the structure of the zombies in his films for inspiration. [...] "It's not that I'm against [...] It's just not what I grew up with. It's interesting, too, because a couple takes we did, where a couple of the zombies kind of broke into a run, and after one take Frank's like, 'Did they run too fast? They shouldn't be running. Slow them down.' This is trying to be creepy and moody and, you know, you're building up all this kind of scary tension." ...|$|E
2500|$|What ensued {{was one of}} {{the most}} vitriolic {{corporate}} battles of the 1980s, with Perot and Smith publicly exchanging barbs using the media, which delightedly splashed the story over every business publication in the U.S.. Perot notoriously lashed out at Smith in a 1988 exclusive to Fortune Magazine, saying: [...] "My question is: Why haven't we unleashed their potential? The answer is: the General Motors system. It's like a blanket of fog that keeps these people from doing what they know needs to be done. I come from an environment where, if you see a snake, you kill it. At GM, if you see a snake, the first thing you do is go hire a consultant on snakes. Then you get a committee on snakes, and then you discuss it for a couple of years. The most likely course of action is—nothing. You figure, the snake hasn't bitten anybody yet, so <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>let</b> him crawl around on the factory floor. We need to build an environment where the first guy who sees the snake kills it." [...] Perot went on to needle Smith regarding the opulent 25th floor GM offices in New York, [...] "An entire teak forest must have been decimated for that floor". Smith, who had obviously ignored the irony of the CEO of the largest public corporation in the world complaining about the opulence of the private office (which Perot had personally paid to furnish) of a rival, had responded to Perot's frequent criticism of GM's executive perks a year earlier, [...] "Perot's office (in Dallas) 'makes mine look like a shanty-town. He has Remingtons; he has a Gilbert Stuart painting hanging on the wall. Nobody runs around saying 'Get rid of Ross's office'".|$|E

6000|$|... "So {{you have}} come at last, have <b>you?</b> <b>Just</b> <b>let's</b> step into the drawing-room: the fact is--I thought I wrote to you about it--?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why, it's only my stupidity,' said Lance, wearily but gratefully; 'and you can't make places quiet or cool! If <b>you</b> would <b>just</b> <b>let</b> me sleep here!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Aye, but I'm {{a little}} {{doubtful}} of going in upon them by myself; now, you {{are well known}} to them all, {{and it will be}} no detriment to <b>you</b> <b>just</b> to <b>let</b> me go in with you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no! <b>You</b> <b>just</b> <b>let</b> me go! I {{want to see}} Hawk Ericson. Is that Hawk Ericson?" [...] {{demanded the}} son of Aunt Emma, {{pointing}} at Carl.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I {{guess it}} isn't, but <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>let</b> {{me know when}} you want any debts collected. I figure I could be quite smart at it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why should I {{understand}} that, {{or anything}} else?" [...] asked the girl. [...] "Don't bother my head by asking conundrums, I beg of <b>you.</b> <b>Just</b> <b>let</b> me discover myself {{in my own}} way." ...|$|E
5000|$|... “The {{business}} has changed so much. The technology alone {{allows you to}} get your music directly to your fans. It’s a very exciting {{time to be a}} musician if <b>you</b> can <b>just</b> <b>let</b> go of how things used to be.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Could <b>you</b> not <b>just</b> <b>let</b> {{them have}} a few drawings, or {{a little bit of}} your company work--just enough for you not to annoy every one, and seem to be testifying against them? You would not like to vex Meta." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're {{too hard}} on Chester, Thyra. He's out of leading-strings now, or should be. <b>You</b> must <b>just</b> <b>let</b> me take an old friend's privilege, {{and tell you that}} you're taking the wrong way with him. You're too jealous and exacting, Thyra." ...|$|R
60|$|VALENTINE (taking this in {{very bad}} part). Now look here, Crampton: <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>let</b> her alone: she's treated you very well. I {{had a much}} worse time of it at lunch than you.|$|E
60|$|CONRAD. You {{want her}} to be fully grown at eighteen. You want to force her into a stuck-up, artificial, {{premature}} self-possession before she has any self to possess. <b>You</b> <b>just</b> <b>let</b> her alone: she is right enough for her years.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course!" [...] and Miss Schuyler nodded sympathetically. [...] "Now, couldn't <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>let</b> us talk to him? The {{boys have}} cut his forehead, and Hetty {{wanted to bring}} him some balsam. I believe {{he used to be}} kind to her." ...|$|E
60|$|When {{a person}} has {{made up her mind}} to be miserable <b>you</b> <b>just</b> have to <b>let</b> her be miserable.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now make yourselves at home," [...] said Mrs. Welsh, {{appearing}} {{at the door}} leading to the kitchen; [...] "if <b>you</b> want anything, <b>just</b> <b>let</b> me know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{the picnic}} is tomorrow, Marilla," [...] cried Anne. [...] "You won't {{keep me from}} going to that, will <b>you?</b> You'll <b>just</b> <b>let</b> me out for the afternoon, won't you? Then I'll stay {{here as long as}} you like AFTERWARDS cheerfully. But I MUST go to the picnic." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then {{the princess}} spoke up. [...] "Your majesty," [...] she said, [...] "I {{can find the}} young man for <b>you.</b> <b>Just</b> <b>let</b> the herald go through the town and {{proclaim}} that I will marry the young man to whom this lock of hair belongs, {{and then we will}} find him quickly enough." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{had better}} {{let me do}} that, Songbird," [...] {{answered}} Sam, kindly. [...] "I can drive over there and Spud can go with me. <b>You</b> <b>just</b> <b>let</b> us know exactly how it occurred." [...] This, of course, was after the boys had related the particulars of their failure to catch the fleeing criminal at Dentonville.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not if it distresses <b>you.</b> <b>Just</b> <b>let</b> me {{hope that}} you did not suppose I blamed you for your share in the matter or that I told the Janseniuses of it. I did not. Yes, I like orchids. A plant that can subsist on a scrap of board is an {{instance}} of natural econ--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What do you mean, sir? I am {{young enough}} for <b>you,</b> sir. <b>Just</b> <b>let</b> me get ahold o' you, sir, and I'll show you, you young rascal! you dem jackanapes!" [...] he ended, almost shrieking with rage, as {{he shook his}} fist {{in the face of}} his {{grinning}} tormentors.|$|R
6000|$|... "If it {{were not}} for <b>you</b> (<b>just</b> to <b>let</b> <b>you</b> know the mood I'm in)-if {{it were not}} for you, and I had the world in my hands, I'd crush it like a puffball; evil so predominates, {{suffering}} is so universal and persistent, happiness so fleeting and so infrequent." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{the suit}} isn't stopped," [...] said Mr. Colbert. [...] "You don't suppose I would pay any {{attention}} to a note like the one Sammy sent me, do <b>you?</b> I <b>just</b> <b>let</b> the suit go on, of course. It has not been decided yet, but I expect to gain it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But say--oh, come, now," [...] said Hamlin confidentially, {{leaning back}} with {{his hands on the}} top of a chair. [...] "Ain't this playing it a little--just a LITTLE--too low down? Of course you mean well, and all that; but come, now, say--couldn't <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>let</b> up on him there? Why, she"--Hamlin softly closed the door--"she's got no character." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here, Gurney," [...] said Bob, impressively. [...] "There's oil there--plenty of it--and I {{know what}} I'm about. <b>You</b> <b>just</b> <b>let</b> me alone, {{and by the}} time Harnett is able to {{understand}} anything, I'll be ready to prove to him that both he and you are rich, all through your charitable idea of buying Simpson's wood-lot." ...|$|E
6000|$|Father was firm. [...] "No, {{we need a}} {{commanding}} officer, and you must take charge. Now I've got a turkey out there--and cranberries--" [...] He was off! He told just what he had laid in for the dinner, and ended by saying, [...] "If there's anything I've forgot, <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>let</b> me know, and I'll go right up town and get it." ...|$|E
5000|$|The song {{revolves}} around a breakup as Jones admits {{to be feeling}} good about not {{having to deal with}} her lover anymore. One lyric pleads, [...] "Would <b>you</b> please <b>just</b> <b>let</b> me go now?" [...] addressing a man who crushed her feelings. The song has been described as [...] "upbeat" [...] and [...] "jazzy".|$|R
6000|$|... 'I've been {{worrying}} myself, Peter,' {{she said}} at last. 'You are so chivalrous and unselfish. You're quixotic. It's that that is troubling me. Are <b>you</b> marrying me <b>just</b> because you're sorry for me? Don't speak. I can tell you now if <b>you</b> will <b>just</b> <b>let</b> me say straight out what's in my mind. We {{have known each other}} for two years now. You know all about me. You know how--how unhappy I am at home. Are <b>you</b> marrying me <b>just</b> because <b>you</b> pity me and want to take me out of all that?' ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the first}} verse, the song's narrator's woman leaves him and heads out west because [...] "she couldn't change him." [...] In the second verse, {{she starts to}} think about the quiet country nights with him, and [...] "Whatever she thought was so wrong with him / Suddenly seemed alright". Then she heads back to him, and she says that [...] "when you love someone, <b>you</b> <b>just</b> gotta <b>let</b> it be." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Thanks. I'll come. Would <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>let</b> me {{feel your}} arm? Splendid biceps! Now, boys, see here: {{this is what}} I call muscle.' And Nan {{delivered}} a short lecture with Dan's sinewy arm to illustrate it. Tom retired to the alcove and glowered at the stars, while he swung his own right arm with a vigour suggestive of knocking someone down.|$|E
6000|$|... "You do it elegant; I {{never see}} anybody do it better. You're right; play it on us, too; play it on us {{same as the}} others; it'll keep you in {{practice}} and prevent you making blunders. We'll keep away from you and let on we don't know you, but any time we can be any help, <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>let</b> us know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then she can't get any education. Old Gould is a {{sensible}} man, who says any school {{he could afford}} would only turn her out a sham, and he means, when Mary and Kate are a little older, to {{get some sort of}} governess for the three. But, mother, couldn't <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>let</b> him bring her in on market days and teach her a little?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good gracious me, my love! I thought Lord Cashel {{had managed}} all that--I {{thought that was}} all settled. You know, he would keep those horrid horses, {{and all that kind}} of thing; and what more could <b>you</b> do than <b>just</b> <b>let</b> Lord Cashel settle it?" ...|$|R
5000|$|It's {{the same}} old story—the same feeling of {{bottomless}} emptiness that has marked the completion of all previous albums. We could have honed the songs till Armageddon, {{but at some point}} <b>you</b> <b>just</b> have to <b>let</b> go and start admiring the scenery.|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly. Whatever his {{feelings}} are, he must {{act as a}} gentleman and an officer. <b>Just</b> <b>you</b> <b>let</b> me talk it over with him. He has great respect for all I say; I've noticed that already." ...|$|R
