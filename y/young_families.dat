In 2009, positive net immigration into the city was shown for the first time in 15 years.|$|E

Since its amendment to the City of Toronto in 1884, it has developed a stature as a neighbourhood of independent arts, with several independent galleries located along Queen Street East.

Many of the residences have since been redeveloped into homes for <b>young</b> <b>families</b> with homes redesigned to fit the tree-lined streetscape. In recent times, local housing values have increased significantly. With this {{a new generation of}} young professionals and their families have moved into the area, furthering already widespread gentrification.|$|E
