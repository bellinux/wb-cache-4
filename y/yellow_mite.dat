The lower sides and belly are lighter; {{there is no}} dark lateral spot below the anterior part of soft dorsal fin. There are 8 narrow, light vertical bars {{on the side of}} the body which may be faded or absent in large adults. A solid or broken blue line runs beneath the eye; it may also disappear with growth. From the upper jaw to the tip of the fleshy opercle, the line is often broken into parts that resemble dashes and spots. The fin and tail is bright yellow, yellow green, or pale orange, and the snout contains blue stripes.|$|R
40|$|Lantana camara is a {{perennial}} shrub with agronomical interest {{as it is}} a weed mainly of pastures in wild state and it is a beautiful ornamental plant in its cultivated varieties/cultivars. Its flowers are pollinated by butterflies which are often seem visiting them, and by bees and hummingbirds. Cross pollination is needed in this plant for fruit and seed set, this latter being its main reproductive mechanism. On the body of these pollinators mites of the orders Mesostigmata and Astigmata live in phoresy and by hitch-hiking arrive to lantana flowers, when those pollinators visit these plants. Mite distribution in these flowers is significantly affected by factors such as temperature and air relative humidity, as mites do not having sclerotized body cover or wax covered body, are sensible to dessication at high temperature and low relative humidity. Relative frequency of mites in red flowers was nine times higher than in yellow flowers, in orange and pink flowers, this frequency was close to five times higher than in yellow flowers. This is related to the lantana flower corolla length, longer in red and pink flowers and shorter in <b>yellow</b> flowers. <b>Mites</b> consume 40 % of flower nectar volume, reducing the availability of this food to pollinators, which avoid visiting flowers which nectar was partially consumed. This reduces seed production, but also obliges the pollinators to visit different plants, promoting cross fecundation. Thus the phoretic mites have a double role in lantana reproduction, so they may be considered pests as well as beneficial organisms. The Mesostigmata being predatory on the other side has another beneficial role as pest biocontrollers. 200...|$|R

50|$|Lorryia formosa, {{commonly}} known as the <b>yellow</b> <b>mite</b> or the citrus <b>yellow</b> <b>mite,</b> is a species of acariform mite. They are in the subfamily Tydeinae of the family Tydeidae. Commonly found on the foliage of citrus trees around the world, Lorryia formosa also associates with a variety of other plant types. The life cycle includes six discrete stages of development, and the lifespan averages about 37 days. The females of the species use an asexual form of reproduction where the growth and development of embryos occurs without fertilization by a male, a process called thelytoky.|$|E
40|$|NYS IPM Type: Fruits IPM Fact SheetPredatory mites {{can provide}} {{consistent}} biological control of pest mites {{such as the}} European red mite (Panonychus ulmi), (ERM), and two-spotted spider mite (Tetranuchus urticae), (TSSM). Pure or mixed populations of several predatory mites occur in New York tree and small fruit plantings. The {{most important of these}} predators are the phytoseiids Typhlodromus pyri and Amblyseius fallacis. Metaseiulus occidentalis, another phytoseiid, is capable of controlling pest mites, but it occurs only sporadically in New York orchards. Its behavior as a predator is similar to A. fallacis. Zetzellia mali, a Stigmaeid or <b>yellow</b> <b>mite,</b> can be found in almost any orchard in the state, but provides biological control by itself only when ERM numbers are relatively low...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1996 The {{feasibility}} of managing codling moth, Cydia pomonella (L.), with mixtures of Bacillus thuringiensis-based microbial and selected chemical insecticides was studied under laboratory and field conditions. Joint actions (synergism, additivity and antagonism) of these mixtures were determined for both egg and larval stages. Higher rates of microbial control agents (MCAs), Dipel® 2 X and MVP®, combined {{with low to}} medium rates of chemical insecticides gave additive or synergistic egg and/or larval mortality. Esfenvalerate and permethrin synergised {{the effect of these}} MCAs, whereas carbaryl, azinphosmethyl, phosmet and diflubenzuron had an additive effects. For all chemical insecticides, often the interactions were better with Dipel than MVP. Generally, egg exposure to low rates of the chemical insecticides alone or in combination with MCAs, caused the larvae hatching from these eggs to be more susceptible to insecticides-MCA mixtures. Most mixtures produced better results when treated at the blackhead stage of egg development. Adult and larval exposure to sublethal rates of azinphosmethyl, phosmet, carbaryl, esfenvalerate and permethrin manifested short- and long-term effects. Adult exposure caused deleterious effects on the survival and oviposition, and the larval exposures affected survival and pupal formation. Carbaryl, esfenvalerate and permethrin affected the pupal survival and subsequent eclosion of adults. Only esfenvalerate and permethrin significantly extended the larval period and reduced pupal weight and subsequent egg deposition. The deleterious sublethal effects of pyrethroids observed in the present study may provide added control of codling moth in the field. Diflubenzuron and MCAs had neither adulticidal activity nor long-term effects on codling moth biology. Results of field efficacy tests indicate that utilization of mixtures of Dipel with low rates of pyrethroids (0. 1 - 0. 2 X) or diflubenzuron (0. 25 - 0. 50 X) in the codling moth management is possible and indeed might be beneficial. Dipel-diflubenzuron mixtures were only suitable when applied 3 times/generation. These mixtures were environmentally safe and did not cause any outbreak of phytophagous mites. Standard application rate (2 times/generation) and timing were found to be appropriate for Dipel-pyrethroid (esfenvalerate and permethrin) mixtures. These pyrethroids at all test rates (0. 1 - 1. 0 X), applied alone or mixed with MCAs, were toxic to predatory phytoseiids, thus caused an outbreak of European red <b>mite</b> and <b>yellow</b> spider <b>mites</b> particularly at higher rates. However, mixtures of Dipel and 0. 1 X of esfenvalerate/permethrin were less disruptive than corresponding 0. 2 - 1. 0 X standard rate. These mixtures were selective to most predatory insects, spiders and Zetzellia malt. Hence, use of these mixtures instead of full rate of pyrethroids may improve the prospects of biological control of insect and mite pests in apple orchards...|$|R
