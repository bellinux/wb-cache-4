500|$|Spiegelman {{rendered}} the original three-page [...] "Maus" [...] and [...] "Prisoner on the Hell Planet" [...] in highly detailed, expressive styles. [...] Spiegelman planned to draw Maus {{in such a}} manner, but after initial sketches he decided to use a pared-down style, one little removed from his pencil sketches, which he found more direct and immediate. [...] Characters are rendered in a minimalist way: animal heads with dots for eyes and slashes for eyebrows and mouths, sitting on humanoid bodies. [...] Spiegelman {{wanted to get away}} from the rendering of the characters in the original [...] "Maus", in which oversized cats towered over the Jewish mice, an approach which Spiegelman says, [...] "tells <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> feel, tells <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> think". [...] He preferred to let the reader make independent moral judgments. [...] He drew the cat-Nazis the same size as the mouse-Jews, and dropped the stereotypical villainous expressions. [...] The contrast between the artwork in [...] "Prisoner on the Hell Planet" [...] and Maus drives home the effectiveness of the simpler artwork—"Prisoner" [...] is alienating, while Maus is more inviting, encouraging deeper contemplation and understanding.|$|E
500|$|Some critics {{characterize}} {{his books}} as unoriginal or derivative. A 2009 New York Times article {{said he is}} [...] "hardly the first writer {{to tap into the}} American longing for meaning and success". [...] Sara Nelson, the editor-in-chief of Publishers Weekly, said Tolle's writings have been successful due to surging public interest in books that tell <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> be happier, more peaceful and more successful. [...] James Robinson in The Observer called his writings [...] "a mix of pseudo-science, New Age philosophy, and teaching borrowed from established religions".|$|E
500|$|In 1973 Peter Sellers {{introduced}} Harrison to Denis O'Brien. Soon after, the two {{went into}} business together. In 1978, {{in an effort}} to produce Monty Python's Life of Brian, they formed the film production and distribution company HandMade Films. Harrison explained: [...] "The name of the company came about as a bit of a joke. I'd been to Wooky Hole in Somerset... an old paper mill where they show <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> make old underpants into paper. So I bought a few rolls, and they had this watermark 'British Handmade Paper'... So we said... we'll call it Handmade Films." ...|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with SoulCulture, Usher told that the inspiration for writing [...] "Sins of My Father" [...] is about dealing with things that people can't understand. He further stated that the past can bring people [...] "down a road" [...] {{because they are not}} aware of it. According to him, [...] "The time spent with a father will teach you a certain understanding of live and how to cope and deal with things. The lack of a father being there can also teach <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> deal with life – and that’s what 'Sins Of The Father' is about... That statement was made because that’s something that I felt." [...] Usher added that the song itself is a [...] "kind of testament" [...] for the father he is.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{win against}} Matthysse, {{negotiations}} {{for a fight}} against Kaizer Mabuza began. Both sides eventually agreed to a March 5 bout, with the vacant IBF Light Welterweight title on the line. Former champion Pernell Whitaker joined Judah's training camp to help him prepare for the match. Whitaker said: [...] "I don't train guys to be like me. I help guys {{to do the things}} that work for them. If I can teach <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> hit and not get hit, that's a blessing for you. Zab has the same abilities I have, but Zab still has to put it together and do it the way that Zab knows how to do it." [...] On March 5, 2011, Judah defeated Mabuza via technical knockout in the seventh round, at the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey, claiming the IBF title again after almost ten years.|$|E
500|$|At this time, {{several of}} his {{siblings}} wrote {{to him about the}} Nation of Islam, a relatively new religious movement preaching black self-reliance and, ultimately, the return of the African diaspora to Africa, where they would be free from white American and European domination. He showed scant interest at first, but after his brother Reginald wrote in 1948, [...] "Malcolm, don't eat any more pork and don't smoke any more cigarettes. I'll show <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> get out of prison", he quit smoking and began to refuse pork. After a visit in which Reginald described the group's teachings, including the belief that white people are devils, Little concluded that every relationship he'd had with whites had been tainted by dishonesty, injustice, greed, and hatred. Little, whose hostility to religion had earned him the prison nickname [...] "Satan", became receptive to the message of the Nation of Islam.|$|E

500|$|Because of {{his many}} {{absences}} from home, on parliamentary and other business, Richard Cobden was a somewhat remote figure to his daughters, although his letters indicate that he felt warmly towards them and that he wished to direct their political education. In later years they would all acknowledge his influence over their ideas. Both parents impressed on the girls their responsibilities for the poor in the local community; Jane Cobden's 1864 diary records visits to homes and workhouses. She and her younger sister Anne, at the ages of 12 and 10 respectively, taught classes in the local village school. [...] The girls were encouraged by their father to contribute what money they possessed to relieve local poverty: [...] "Do not keep the money... as you have now made up your minds {{to give it to}} poor sufferers, let your own neighbours have it. Your Mama will tell <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> dispose of it, and tell me all about it".|$|E
500|$|... "Wrecking Ball" [...] gained mostly {{positive}} {{reviews from}} contemporary music critics. Writing for The A.V. Club, Marah Eakin provided a favorable review, {{calling it a}} [...] "solid ballad" [...] and describing it as [...] "a modern day 'My Heart Will Go On' that discussed a deteriorated, shortlived young romance." [...] Kitty Empire from The Observer opined that [...] "the heartbreak section of Bangerz mostly repays your attention" [...] and mentioned [...] "Wrecking Ball" [...] {{to be a part}} of it. Although he found the song [...] "predictable," [...] Evan Sawdey of PopMatters gave it an overall positive review and complimented its production and the build up to its chorus, calling it [...] "the kind of broad mainstream song that shows how <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> properly build up to a chorus before hitting us over the head with it. Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone felt that it [...] " [...] the hunger and confusion that make great coming-of-age pop." [...] Writing for AllMusic, Heather Phares considered the track to be a standout from Bangerz.|$|E
500|$|A more {{negative}} review {{said that while}} [...] "Eclipse restores some of the energy New Moon zapped out of the franchise and has enough quality performances to keep it involving", the film [...] "isn't quite the adrenaline-charged game-changer for love story haters that its marketing might lead you to believe. The majority of the 'action' remains protracted and not especially scintillating should-we-or-shouldn't-we conversations between the central triangle." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times gave the film a more positive review than {{for the first two}} films in the saga, but still felt the movie was a constant, unclever conversation between the three main characters. He criticized the [...] "gazes" [...] both Edward and Jacob give Bella throughout the movie, and noted that the mountain range that appears in the film looks [...] "like landscapes painted by that guy on TV who shows <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> paint stuff like that." [...] He also predicted that a lack of understanding for the film series in general would not bode well with the audience, stating, [...] "I doubt anyone not intimately familiar with the earlier installments could make head or tails of the opening scenes." [...] He gave the film 2 stars out of 4.|$|E

500|$|... "Get Me Bodied" [...] {{was one of}} {{the music}} videos shot during the two-week filming for B'Day Anthology Video Album. It was {{conceptualized}} by Beyoncé and co-directed by Anthony Mandler. The version of the song used in the clip is the extended mix, which is featured on the deluxe edition of B'Day. The video was shot over two days and choreographed by Rhapsody, Todd Sams, Clifford McGhee and Bethany Strong. For the shoot, Beyoncé asked former Destiny's Child band-mates Kelly Rowland, Michelle Williams, and sister Solange to appear with her in the video. She said that it [...] "sets the tone of the video". Beyoncé's mother and stylist, Tina created over 60 outfits for Beyoncé and the 50 extras featured in the video. The instructional dance-oriented video was inspired by the 1960s choreographies. Beyoncé cited influences from the Broadway director-choreographer Bob Fosse, Southern and Jamaican movement and the Frug from the musical Sweet Charity; Erika Ramirez of Billboard magazine further noted that the video was inspired by the scene [...] "Rich Man's Frug" [...] from the movie. She said: [...] "It tells <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> do all the dances — it's modern, it's retro, it's vintage, it's stylized, it's all of those things put together." [...] The story moves from a tony party reminiscent of the jet set style of the sixties, followed with dance sequences. The video was released to US iTunes Store as a Video Triple on September 4, 2007. A re-edit of the video was produced for the Timbaland remix featuring Voltio. Although Voltio does not actually appear in the video, unused footages of the original video were replaced during the parts he sings. The re-edited video was posted on the MTV Overdrive on July 26, 2007. It was included on the DVD for Irreemplazable (2007).|$|E
500|$|... "Used to Love You" [...] {{was written}} by Stefani, Justin Tranter, Julia Michaels and J.R. Rotem; Rotem {{is also one of}} the song's producers. [...] The song is a {{vulnerable}} and [...] "emotional" [...] midtempo synthpop ballad, having a [...] "driving piano melody", with a length of three minutes and forty-seven seconds. Spins James Grebey wrote that the song [...] "largely showcases her passionate, conflicted vocals over restrained, electropop-leaning swells of emotional synths and drum taps." [...] Lyrically, [...] "Used to Love You" [...] is a break-up anthem, where Stefani is questioning how she fell in love with her ex in the first place. The majority of music critics noted that the song is inspired by Stefani's divorce from Gavin Rossdale, after a 13-year marriage. In an interview for Todays Matt Lauer, Stefani confirmed that the track was inspired by the end of her marriage, claiming: [...] "I’ve never put a record out where I’m actually going through things in real time. his is like, I wrote that song like a couple weeks ago." [...] According to Daniel Kreps of Rolling Stone that could be seen in the lines of the chorus, [...] "I don't know why I cry / But I think it's cause I remember for the first time / Since I hated you / That I used to love you." [...] In other poignant lyrics, she sings, [...] "I guess nobody taught you, nobody taught <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> love." [...] Kreps further compared the lyrical content of [...] "Used to Love You" [...] to [...] "Dreaming the Same Dream", a song from No Doubt's sixth album Push and Shove. Alex Kritselis of Bustle claimed that the song [...] "recalls some of [...] best ballads, like 'Cool', 'Early Winter', and '4 in the Morning'." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite this, member Lisa [...] "Left Eye" [...] Lopes was the opposite. She {{threatened}} to wear black tape {{over her mouth}} on the song's music video due to her disagreement with its message and the choice {{for it to be}} CrazySexyCool lead single, partially because of the group's history of advocating for safe sex since their debut. [...] "I was totally, 100% against 'Creep'. I wasn't down with cheating on your man, you know, for me, it's be faithful. Trust me, I fought against that single coming out. You know, I was like 'If a girl is gonna [...] catch her man cheating,' this was my thing, 'instead of telling her to cheat back, why don't we tell her [...] just leave,'" [...] she shared. In the end, Lopes eventually capitulated, stating: [...] "If some people can creep, and in their minds, they can feel better by going out doing the same thing... Fine. I'm just not one of those people." [...] She instead added her new rap verse on remixed versions of the song, which talks about the consequences of cheating. Thomas later thought the song and the video's choreography routine were [...] "cool" [...] enough to distract people from its lyrical content and [...] "just sing along." [...] "Even the song 'Creep'—not that we creep, but if we did, [...] for a woman that would do such a thing. I say just leave his ass, but if you're not ready to just jet at the moment, then you know, I guess we told <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> [...] We were really happy and we still are really happy to be the voice for so many women in so many different situations in their lives," [...] she told Myspace in 2014. Jon Parales of The New York Times stood by the song's concept, he wrote: [...] "The women sing about infidelity, revenge, status and power plays, not as victims but as contenders; when they're cheated on, they cheat, too." [...] Carol Cooper from The Guardian also described the track as the darker side of their [...] "giddy hedonism." ...|$|E

500|$|Madonna herself {{would later}} say: [...] "I wouldn't say I regret it. I've made {{mistakes}} and learned from them. Most {{people want to}} hear me say that I regret publishing my Sex book. I don't. What was the problem was releasing my Erotica album at the same time. I love that album and it got overlooked." [...] However, author Andy Koopmans in his book Madonna (2002) would comment that the singer regretted both publishing Sex and recording Erotica and that the book [...] "had affected everything she did later". It was not until 2003 that Madonna would once again declare that she regretted nothing; [...] "I'm not apologizing in any shape or form [...] I was interested in pushing buttons and being rebellious and being mischievous and trying to bend the rules. There was a lot of irony in the Sex book and I am poking fun at a lot of things and I am being kind of silly and adolescent and I am being very f you, if a man can do it, I can do it." [...] A year earlier on 2002, Naomi Campbell confessed to [...] "have {{a lot of respect for}} Madonna being bold enough to come out and do a book on sex. I've never reneged on that". However, in 2009, rapper Vanilla Ice, who was Madonna's boyfriend at the time of the book's creation, confessed to not being happy with the book once he saw it. [...] "My friends were like, 'Dude, that's cool man', but I was like, 'I'm dating her, it's not cool to see your girlfriend with all these other people' [...] It kinda ruined the whole thing. I wonder what her kids think of that book? Here she is writing kids' books now but they're going to see it and go, 'Mommy, what were you thinking?'" [...] Another of the book's models, actress Isabella Rossellini, told Out magazine that she regretted her participation on the book; [...] "I don't think the book worked, even though the photos were extraordinary, and some of them quite memorable. I think there was a little bit of a moralistic sort of 'I'll teach <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> be free!' – and that bothered the hell out of me." ...|$|E
