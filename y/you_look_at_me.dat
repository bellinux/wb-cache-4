500|$|Acoustic guitars {{introduces}} the seventh track, [...] "Intervention". It {{starts with a}} three chord minor sequence which changes to a four chord one during the chorus section and a bass section starts {{at the end of}} the track. Lyrically, the song is an optimistic track about how a relationship will last as Madonna says [...] "the road looks lonely but that's just Satan's game". [...] "X-Static Process", the eighth track, starts once again with acoustic guitars and throughout there are vocal harmony lines in addition to an organ part. Lyrically, like the title track, it questions modern life as Madonna sings [...] "Jesus Christ will <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> don't know who I'm supposed to be". [...] "Mother and Father" [...] is the album's ninth track, with a drum and bass beat paired with an electric guitar present in the instrumental. Lyrically, the song reflects on Madonna's childhood including her mother's death and her father's reaction, and the effect on their relationship. The tenth track is [...] "Die Another Day", the theme to the James Bond film of the same name which featured dominating string and synth parts. The eleventh and final track on the album, [...] "Easy Ride", is a heavily string-oriented song. It addresses Madonna's feelings towards old age, wanting to live forever, and coming full circle to a point in her life where she could be comfortable.|$|E
500|$|Clair's {{beliefs and}} endeavors {{as a working}} wife and mother are wholeheartedly {{supported}} by her family. Additionally, when Clair is at work, Cliff willingly assumes traditionally female household responsibilities such as cooking and cleaning. Both Clair's professional and personal lives operate alongside each other rather smoothly with little conflict. However, despite being a full-time lawyer, she is seldom shown {{at work in the}} courtroom; audiences see the character at home more often than anywhere else. According to Women Watching Television: Gender, Class, and Generation in the American Television Experience author Andrea L. Press, Clair's role demonstrates [...] "the hegemonic view that families need not change to accommodate working wives and mothers", believing that the show mostly depicts Clair at home to avoid exploring the everyday conflicts working women endure in their daily lives. One of the series' more political moments, Clair refuses to be exploited as [...] "the token black woman" [...] on a morning talk show discussing the Great Depression during the episode [...] "Mrs. Huxtable Goes to Kindergarten", a position she originally accepts under the impression that she would be appreciated for her experience as a lawyer. When Clair learns that her all-white male co-panelists only want to hear opinions {{from the perspective of a}} black woman, Clair delivers a speech that reads, [...] "I am also a human being, who is an attorney, a mother of five, and somewhat knowledgeable about history ... But when <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> this is all you see in me, a black woman?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Yang Fu, {{one of the}} {{officials}} who opposed Ma Chao in Liang Province, once visited his colleague and relative Jiang Xu and Jiang Xu's mother. He lamented about Ma Chao's murder of Wei Kang and forceful occupation of Liang Province: [...] " [...] Ma Chao betrayed his father, rebelled against the Emperor, and massacred the officers in our province. [...] Ma Chao is strong but iniquitous. He is morally weak and susceptible to temptation and trickery." [...] Yang Fu, Jiang Xu and several others later plotted against Ma Chao and drove him out of Liang Province. Ma Chao fought his way into Licheng (歷城) and captured Jiang Xu's mother. She scolded him, [...] "You're an unfilial son who betrays his own father and a treacherous villain who murders his superior. Heaven and Earth will not forgive you. You should die immediately. How dare <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> straight in the eye!" [...] Ma Chao was furious and he killed her.|$|E
