'The {{crisis of}} the strait however arose further on a little; where the crowded market-place had to {{introduce}} itself into a street,--straight indeed and good, but proportionably far too narrow. I have, in my life, seen nothing like it: the aspect of it might perhaps be {{compared to that of}} a swoln river which has been raging over meadows and fields, and is now again obliged to press itself through a narrow bridge, and flow on in its bounded channel. Down the long street, all visible from our windows, there swelled continually the strangest tide: a high double-seated travelling-coach towered visible over the flood of things. We thought of the fair Frenchwomen we had seen in the morning. It was not they, however, it was Count Haugwitz; him <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> <b>at,</b> with a kind of sardonic malice, rocking onwards, step by step, there.'

60|$|The {{great day}} {{appeared}} to Diamantina {{to be long}} in coming, but, like other days, it came at last. Before the sun was fairly up in the heavens the princess, too full of excitement {{to stay in the}} palace, was walking about the streets so covered with precious stones that you had to shade your eyes before <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> her. By-and-by a trumpet sounded, and she hurried home, only to appear again in a few moments walking by the side of her father down to the river. Here a splendid barge was waiting for them, and from it they watched all sorts of races and feats of swimming and diving. When these were over the barge proceeded up the river to the field where the dancing and concerts were to take place, and after the prizes had been given away to the winners, and the loaves and the dresses had been distributed by the princess, they bade farewell to their guests, and turned to step into the barge which was to carry them back to the palace.|$|E
6000|$|DEAR MAFFLIN,--You will {{remember}} that I wrote this story as an Awful Warning. None {{the less you}} have seen fit to disregard it and have followed Gadsby's example--as I betted you would. I acknowledge that you paid the money at once, but you have prejudiced the mind of Mrs. Mafflin against myself, for though I am almost the only respectable friend of your bachelor days, she has been darwaza band to me throughout the season. Further, she caused you to invite me to dinner at the Club, where you called me [...] "a wild ass of the desert," [...] and went home at half-past ten, after discoursing for twenty minutes on the responsibilities of housekeeping. You now drive a mail-phaeton and sit under a Church of England clergyman. I am not angry, Jack. It is your kismet, as it was Gaddy's, and his kismet who can avoid? Do not think that I am moved by a spirit of revenge as I write, thus publicly, that you and you alone are responsible for this book. In other and more expansive days, when <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> a magnum without flushing and at a cheroot without turning white, you supplied me {{with most of the}} material. Take it back again--would that I could have preserved your fatherless speech in the telling--take it back, and by your slippered hearth read it to the late Miss Deercourt. She will not be any the more willing to receive my cards, but she will admire you immensely, and you, I feel sure, will love me. You may even invite me to another very bad dinner--at the Club, which, as you and your wife know, is a safe neutral ground for the entertainment of wild asses. Then, my very dear hypocrite, we shall be quits.|$|E

[...] Rollo met Mr. Kennedy {{at the head}} of the cabin stairs, and he seemed very much rejoiced to learn that Waldron was found. Rollo led the way, and Mr. and Mrs. Kennedy followed him, until they came to a place on the deck, pretty well forward, where there was an opening surrounded by an iron railing, through which <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> down into the hold below. It was very far down that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>look,</b> and <b>at</b> different distances on the way were to be seen iron ladders going from deck to deck, and ponderous shafts, moving continually, with great clangor and din, while at the bottom were seen the mouths of several great glowing furnaces, with men at work shovelling coal into them.|$|R

We are {{accustomed}} to look upon the shackled form of a conquered monster, but there--there <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> a thing monstrous and free. It was unearthly, and the men were--No, they were not inhuman. Well, you know, {{that was the worst}} of it--this suspicion of their not being inhuman. It would come slowly to one. They howled and leaped, and spun, and made horrid faces; but what thrilled you was just the thought of their humanity--like yours--the thought of your remote kinship with this wild and passionate uproar. Ugly. Yes, it was ugly enough; but if you were man enough you would admit to yourself that there was in you just the faintest trace of a response to the terrible frankness of that noise, a dim suspicion of there being a meaning in it which you--you so remote from the night of first ages--could comprehend. And why not? The mind of man is capable of anything--because everything is in it, all the past as well as all the future. What was there after all? Joy, fear, sorrow, devotion, valour, rage--who can tell?--but truth--truth stripped of its cloak of time. Let the fool gape and shudder--the man knows, and can look on without a wink. But he must at least be as much of a man as these on the shore. He must meet that truth with his own true stuff--with his own inborn strength. Principles won't do. Acquisitions, clothes, pretty rags--rags that would fly off at the first good shake. No; you want a deliberate belief. An appeal to me in this fiendish row--is there? Very well; I hear; I admit, but I have a voice, too, and for good or evil mine is the speech that cannot be silenced. Of course, a fool, what with sheer fright and fine sentiments, is always safe. Who's that grunting? You wonder I didn't go ashore for a howl and a dance? Well, no--I didn't. Fine sentiments, you say? Fine sentiments, be hanged! I had no time. I had to mess about with white-lead and strips of woolen blanket helping to put bandages on those leaky steam-pipes--I tell you. I had to watch the steering, and circumvent those snags, and get the tin-pot along by hook or by crook. There was surface-truth enough in these things to save a wiser man. And between whiles I had to look after the savage who was fireman. He was an improved specimen; he could fire up a vertical boiler. He was there below me, and, upon my word, to look at him was as edifying as seeing a dog in a parody of breeches and a feather hat, walking on his hind-legs. A few months of training had done for that really fine chap. He squinted at the steam-gauge and at the water-gauge with an evident effort of intrepidity--and he had filed teeth, too, the poor devil, and the wool of his pate shaved into queer patterns, and three ornamental scars on each of his cheeks. He ought to have been clapping his hands and stamping his feet on the bank, instead of which he was hard at work, a thrall to strange witchcraft, full of improving knowledge. He was useful because he had been instructed; and what he knew was this--that should the water in that transparent thing disappear, the evil spirit inside the boiler would get angry through the greatness of his thirst, and take a terrible vengeance. So he sweated and fired up and watched the glass fearfully (with an impromptu charm, made of rags, tied to his arm, and a piece of polished bone, as big as a watch, stuck flatways through his lower lip), while the wooded banks slipped past us slowly, the short noise was left behind, the interminable miles of silence--and we crept on, towards Kurtz. But the snags were thick, the water was treacherous and shallow, the boiler seemed indeed to have a sulky devil in it, and thus neither that fireman nor I had any time to peer into our creepy thoughts.|$|E

5000|$|The Firebrand is Bradley's second re-telling of {{a famous}} legend, and her only novel set in ancient Greece. She decided to re-envision legends from a female perspective, {{and said that she}} had an {{interest}} to [...] "hear more about the human realities" [...] surrounding well-known stories, but did not believe this constituted a feminist writing style. In an interview with Lisa See of Publishers Weekly, Bradley said she viewed the Trojan War legend as an example of masculine culture dominating and obfuscating female viewpoints and contributions. She said: [...] "During the Dorian invasion, when iron won out over bronze, the female cult died. The Minoan and Mycenaean cultures were dead overnight. But <b>you</b> <b>could</b> also <b>look</b> <b>at</b> that period of history and say, here were two cultures that should have been ruled by female twins—Helen and Klytemnestra. And what do you know? When they married Menelaus and Agamemnon, the men took over their cities. I just want to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> what history was really like before the women-haters got hold of it.

And they stay in key, happy day... The trio has chosen wisely and sequenced beautifully a set of tunes that is transcendent, with skillful but not showy playing on three acoustic guitars, plus accompaniment by David Goodrich on slide guitar, mandolin and papoose guitar, and Delmhorst on occasional fiddle...

5000|$|Ray Guy was {{selected}} to seven AFC Pro Bowl teams, and in 1994, he was named the punter on the National Football League's 75th Anniversary Team. His trademark was kicking punts that stayed {{in the air for}} so long that by the time the punt returner was able to field it, the Raiders' coverage unit had the field covered so well that a return was not possible. Guy's punts often left opposing offenses pinned in their own end of the field. The statistic for hang time was instituted in the NFL during his career, reportedly because of him.

The pattern language {{presented in this paper}} sheds light on how to make use of technology when preparing and conducting a meeting. We collected advice both on social practices of good meetings as well as on implications for technology support in meetings. These patterns are illustrated by three different application areas, namely meetings in commercial contexts, meetings in the context of learning that are often referred to as group learning, and meetings in the context of committees in a nongovernmental organizations. Apologies to the writer’s workshop Well, unfortunately, this paper is a strong candidate for the longest paper award.
