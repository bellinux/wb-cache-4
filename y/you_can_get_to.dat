5|$|I've {{always tried}} to insert {{positivity}} into my songs wherever I can, to inspire other people who go through stuff. I mean the stuff they talked about in tabloids {{and the things that}} were so overly exaggerated, that's one aspect. I also went through a lot of personal stuff, a lot of family stuff this year. Losing a parent is an intense thing for anybody. It's brought me to another place. People are going to read into it as, 'This is Mariah and her struggle'. But the way I try to word it is, 'It's OK once you say I can make it through the rain.' Not just me going, 'I can make it through the rain,' it's me telling people that if you believe you can get through whatever you're going through, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> the other side.|$|E
2500|$|The {{graphics}} {{were also}} praised by reviewers. [...] GameZone's reviewer called the visuals [...] "beautiful" [...] and stated [...] "the pinball machines are very sharp and crisp, {{and are the}} absolute closest <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> playing pinball without actually being at a pinball machine." [...] IGN's Daemon Hatfield agreed. [...] He felt that the individual tables were well detailed and added praise for the dynamic camera angles show during gameplay. [...] Brad Nicholson of Destructoid also gave high marks for table design and visuals. [...] He stated Zen Pinball is [...] "a sweet little title that captures the recognizable Pinball look." ...|$|E
2500|$|Zanac, in retrospect, {{has been}} {{considered}} a unique shoot 'em up game, combining gameplay elements from games such as Xevious, especially with the extensive power-up system and vertical-scrolling gameplay that features both air and ground targets. Brett Alan Weiss of Allgame praised Zanac, calling it an extremely fast-paced shooter in which the player is almost completely surrounded by enemy ships and bullets. He praises the game for its music which seems to flow along with {{the action of the}} game; he calls the music [...] "at least as close as <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> a Zen moment while playing a shooting game on the NES". Frank Provo of GameSpot lauded Zanac for its difficulty level, its ability to handle many sprites on the screen without slowdown or other glitches, and its unique AI, which placed this game in a subgenre of its own. However, criticisms include mediocre and primitive music and sound, a steep learning curve in gameplay and difficulty level, and poor translation in the game itself and in the game's instruction manual. In addition, Weiss says that enemies in Zanac, while fearsome, [...] "don't have much personality".|$|E

2500|$|In an April 2010 {{interview}} for the NME, Ant {{announced he was}} also working a new album, with the title Adam Ant Is the Blueblack Hussar in Marrying the Gunner's Daughter. This was planned to feature collaborations with former 3 Colours Red guitarist Chris McCormack, Ant's long-time songwriting partner Marco Pirroni, a member of Oasis (later identified as Andy Bell) and Morrissey's writing partner Boz Boorer. According to Ant, the album is a [...] "live record that lends itself to performance" [...] and will feature a [...] "kind of concept. It's a very old fashioned, old school, step-by-step album". In addition, Ant rerecorded a song in tribute to the late Sex Pistols manager Malcolm McLaren, who died earlier that month, and who also once managed Adam & The Ants. Named Who's A Goofy Bunny Then?, the track was only previously available as a demo recorded in the early 1980s, but Ant {{said he wanted to}} release a new version in tribute to the late punk manager. [...] "Malcolm was a sort of mentor in my life" [...] he explained. [...] "As close as <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> a surrogate father." [...] The song took its name from a term of endearment bestowed upon McLaren by Ant – referring to his [...] "quite prominent teeth".|$|E

2500|$|Jimmy [...] was an {{education}} for me, {{as he was}} for most people who {{came in contact with}} him. ... taught me about art and developed my taste, but I didn't begin to understand about making work until later with Yvonne Rainer. [...] From her I found out {{what it is to be}} an artist [...] a person who makes choices and stands behind them. [...] Then, from working with Trisha Brown in the Grand Union, I learned how to edit, how to boil a thing down to its essence. Jimmy's approach was much more whimsical. His way of working led you [...] or led me at any rate [...] to accept any idea as valid simply because I'd thought of it. [...] I thought of it and I kept it, and what came next was what I thought of next. [...] I don't believe Jimmy meant to absolve me of all responsibility for my work, but I got the impression that wild intuitive guessing was all I had to do to make art. [...] I never threw anything away. [...] I remember distinctly Jimmy's saying, [...] "If you don't like it now, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> like it. [...] If you can't get to like it, who says you have to like it?" [...] The point of it was to demystify art and free the artist from the limitations of his own taste. [...] There was a great sense of liberation that stemmed from John Cage's championing of this philosophy, and Jimmy, among others, was establishing alternatives to the kind of teaching that had dominated modern-dance composition up until then.|$|E
