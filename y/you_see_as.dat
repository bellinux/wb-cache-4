5|$|It is {{important}} for us, my brothers, that we exterminate from our lands this nation which seeks only to destroy us. <b>You</b> <b>see</b> <b>as</b> well as I that {{we can no longer}} supply our needs, as we have done from our brothers, the French.... Therefore, my brothers, we must all swear their destruction and wait no longer. Nothing prevents us; they are few in numbers, and we can accomplish it.|$|E
500|$|L'incoronazione di Poppea {{was first}} {{performed}} at the Teatro Santi Giovanni e Paolo, Venice, {{as part of the}} 1642–43 carnival season. The theatre, opened in 1639, had earlier staged the première of Monteverdi's opera Le Nozze d'Enea in Lavinia, and a revival of the composer's Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria. The theatre was later described by an observer: [...] "...marvellous scene changes, majestic and grand appearances ... and a magnificent flying machine; <b>you</b> <b>see,</b> <b>as</b> if commonplace, glorious heavens, deities, seas, royal palaces, woods, forests...". The theatre held about 900 people, and the stage was much bigger than the auditorium.|$|E
2500|$|In {{one popular}} {{interpretation}} of stage theory, {{each of the}} so-called levels of existence envelops those below it: an ethical person is still capable of aesthetic enjoyment, for example, and a religious person is still capable of aesthetic enjoyment and ethical duty. The difference between these ways of living are internal, not external, and thus there are no external signs one can point to determine at what level a person is living. This inner and outer relationship is commonly determined by an individual by looking to others to gauge one's action, Kierkegaard believed one should look to oneself and in that relationship look to Christ as the example instead of looking at others because the more you look at others the less you see of yourself. This {{makes it easier to}} degrade your neighbor instead of loving your neighbor. But one must love the person one sees not the person one wishes to see. Either love the person <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>as</b> that person is the person he is or stop talking about loving everyone.|$|E

Wilde has been quoted as saying, [...] "What difference is there between a glass of absinthe and a sunset?" [...] and [...] "After the first glass absinthe <b>you</b> <b>see</b> things <b>as</b> <b>you</b> wish they were. After the second, <b>you</b> <b>see</b> things <b>as</b> they are not. Finally, <b>you</b> <b>see</b> things <b>as</b> they really are, and that is the most horrible thing in the world." ...|$|R
2500|$|By {{the early}} 1970s, Jones began deriding {{traditional}} Christianity as [...] "fly away religion", rejecting the Bible {{as being a}} tool to oppress women and non-whites, and denouncing a [...] "Sky God" [...] who was no God at all. Jones wrote a booklet titled [...] "The Letter Killeth", criticizing the King James Bible. Jones also began preaching {{that he was the}} reincarnation of Gandhi, Father Divine, Jesus, Gautama Buddha and Vladimir Lenin. Former Temple member Hue Fortson, Jr. quoted Jones as saying, [...] "What you need to believe in is what <b>you</b> can <b>see...</b> If <b>you</b> <b>see</b> me <b>as</b> your friend, I'll be your friend. As <b>you</b> <b>see</b> me <b>as</b> your father, I'll be your father, for those of you that don't have a father... If <b>you</b> <b>see</b> me <b>as</b> your savior, I'll be your savior. If <b>you</b> <b>see</b> me <b>as</b> your God, I'll be your God." ...|$|R

2500|$|By 1 p.m., {{the show}} held a second {{production}} meeting {{to go over}} scripts and determine which pieces to edit. Scripts were [...] "hopefully" [...] completed around 4 p.m., and a rehearsal with the entire staff would begin at 5:30p.m. or occasionally earlier. Afterward, final changes {{were made to the}} script. The final rewrite would take place in a [...] "small, red, poorly ventilated room" [...] until 6:45p.m. Before interviewing his guests, Colbert met with them in the green room and acknowledged that he was playing a character, noting that the persona is [...] "willfully ignorant of what you know and care about" [...] and urging the guest to [...] "honestly disabuse me of what <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>as</b> my ignorance." [...] Emily Lazar, a producer for the interview segments, advised guests to talk with Colbert as though he were a [...] "harmless drunk at the next bar stool." [...] Guests would typically take their seats around 7 p.m., when a warm-up comedian (perhaps Jared Logan or Paul Mercurio) delivered jokes. Colbert, out of character, held a brief question and answer session with the audience prior to taping. Taping lasted as long as three hours but usually ended around 9 p.m., at which point the show was edited and sent to Comedy Central for broadcast. As the show was being edited, the staff met one last time to work through details for the next show.|$|E
