But I {{sometimes}} think I have picked up too many foreign ways. What I was telling you belongs {{to a time when}} I was much younger and very different looking to what I am now. I had a very high color, sir, if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it,</b> indeed I was a very smart lass. My lady was younger, too, and the late marquis was youngest of all--I mean in the way he went on, sir; he had a very high spirit; he was a magnificent man. He was fond of his pleasure, like most foreigners, and it must be owned that he sometimes went rather below him to take it. My lady was often jealous, and, if you'll believe it, sir, she did me the honor to be jealous of me. One day I had a red ribbon in my cap, and my lady flew out at me and ordered me to take it off. She accused me of putting it on to make the marquis look at me. I don't know that I was impertinent, but I spoke up like an honest girl and didn't count my words. A red ribbon indeed! As if it was my ribbons the marquis looked at! My lady knew afterwards that I was perfectly respectable, but she never said a word to show that she believed it. But the marquis did!" [...] Mrs. Bread presently added, [...] "I took off my red ribbon and put it away in a drawer, where I have kept it to this day. It's faded now, it's a very pale pink; but there it lies. My grudge has faded, too; the red has all gone out of it; but it lies here yet." [...] And Mrs. Bread stroked her black satin bodice.|$|E

It 's filled {{with all sorts of}} horrible things, that fizzle up and go off, or that make you turn some dreadful color if you look at them. I expect to hear a great clap some day, and half an hour afterward to see Gordon brought home in several hundred small pieces, put up in a dozen little bottles. I got a horrid little stain {{in the middle of my}} dress that one of the young men--the young savants--was so good as to drop there. Did you see the young savants who work under Gordon's orders? I thought they were too forlorn; there is n't one of them you would look at. If <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it,</b> there was n't one of them that looked at me; they took no more notice of me than if I had been the charwoman. They might have shown me some attention, at least, as the wife of the proprietor. What is it that Gordon 's called--is n't there some other name? If you say 'proprietor,' it sounds as if he kept an hotel. I certainly don't want to pass for the wife of an hotel-keeper. What does he call himself? He must have some name. I hate telling people he 's a chemist; it sounds just as if he kept a shop. That 's what they call the druggists in England, and I formed the habit while I was there. It makes me feel as if he were some dreadful little man, with big green bottles in the window and 'night-bell' painted outside. He does n't call himself anything? Well, that 's exactly like Gordon! I wonder he consents to have a name at all. When I was telling some one about the young men who work under his orders--the young savants--he said I must not say that--I must not speak of their working 'under his orders.' I don't know what he would like me to say! Under his inspiration!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... ....I break {{ground with}} you thus, dear Grace, {{late in the}} evening (too late--for I shall soon have to go most belatedly to bed) of a {{singularly}} beautiful and glowingly hot summer's day--one of a succession that August has at last brought us (and with more, apparently, in store,) after a wholly damnable June and July, a hideous ordeal of wet and cold. English fine weather is worth waiting for--it is so sovereign in quality when it comes, and the capacity of this little place of a few marked odd elements to become charming, to shine and flush and endear itself, is then so admirable. I went out for my afternoon walk under stress of having promised my good little gardener (a real pearl of price--these eleven years--in the way of a serving-man) to come and witness his possible triumphs at our annual little horticultural show, given this year in some charming private grounds on a high hill overlooking our little huddled (and lower-hilled) purple town. There I found myself in the extraordinary position--save that other summers might--but haven't--softened the edge of the monstrosity--of seeing [...] "Henry James Esq." [...] figure on thirteen large cards commemorative of first, second and third prizes--and of more first, even, if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it,</b> than the others. It always [seems] to point, more than anything else, the moral, for me, of my long expatriation and to put its [...] "advantages" [...] into a nutshell. In what corner of our native immensity could I have fallen--and practically without effort, helpless ignoramus though I be--into the uncanny flourish of a swell at local flower shows? Here it has come of itself--and it crowns my career. How I wish you weren't too far away for me to send you a box of my victorious carnations and my triumphant sweet peas! However, I remember your telling me with emphasis long years ago that you hated [...] "cut flowers," [...] and I have treasured your brave heresy (the memory of it) so ineffaceably so as to find support in it always, and fine precedent, for a very lukewarm adhesion to them myself, except for a slight inconsistency in the matter of roses and sweet peas (both supremely lovable, I think, in their kind,) which increase and multiply and bless one in proportion as one tears them from the stem. However, it's 1.30 a.m. o'clock--and I am putting this to bed; till to-morrow night again, when I shall pull it forth and add to its yearning volume. I have to write at night, and even late at night--to write letter-things at all; for the simple reason of being so vilely constituted for work that when my regularly recurring morning stint is done (from after breakfast to luncheon-time,) I am [...] "done" [...] utterly, and so cerebrally spent (with the effort to distil [...] "quality" [...] for three or four hours,) that I can't touch a pen till as much as possible of the day has elapsed, to build out and disconnect my morning's association with it. That is one reason--and always has been--of my baseness as a correspondent. The question is whether the effect I produce as a [...] "story writer" [...] is of a nature to make up for it. You will say [...] "most certainly not!"--and who shall blame you? But goodnight and à demain.|$|E

40|$|The general {{topic of}} this work is the {{information}} value of declarative sentences containing proper names. I begin by accepting the direct designation theory of names. The theory, however, {{does not appear to}} be able to account for the difference in information value between sentences like 2 ̆ 7 Hesperus is Phosphorus 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 Hesperus is Hesperus 2 ̆ 7. In order to explain this difference I develop an account of belief that takes a novel approach to the contents of beliefs of propositions expressed by such sentences. ^ If you have a de re attitude towards a proposition, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> in several different ways. The difference corresponds to the various ways in which you can mentally represent the object in the proposition. I account for this difference by introducing a distinction between the information basis of a sentence, which is the proposition expressed by the sentence, and the information value of the sentence, which is a subjective notion that depends on how one understands the sentence. ^ The implication of the theory on the relationship between the necessary and the a priori is significant. I agree with Kripke that true identity statements containing different codesignative names express necessary propositions, but we disagree on the epistemic status of those propositions. While he argues that they can be known only a posteriori, I argue that they also can be known a priori. Regarding sentences like 2 ̆ 7 stick S is one meter long 2 ̆ 7, I disagree with Kripke, and argue that although we cannot know this a priori, there is a closely related sentence that qualifies as an example of the contingent a priori, namely 2 ̆ 7 the length S appears to have is one meter 2 ̆ 7. ...|$|E

I propose that focusing on the scientific relationships between documents is important, and has advantages as the basis for a Web metadata scheme to enrich the HCI communityÕs Web.

In response to Obama's increases, Clinton's campaign began to increase their attacks on him, including an accusation of plagiarism due to similarities in Obama's campaign speeches and campaign speeches of Obama's campaign's national co-chair and Massachusetts governor, Deval Patrick, although Patrick specifically stated he told Obama to use it. During the February 21, CNN-Univision debate in Austin, Texas Obama responded to the accusation by saying, [...] "The notion that I had plagiarized from somebody who's one of my national co-chairs, who gave me the line and suggested that I use it, I think is silly."
