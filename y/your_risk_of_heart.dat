50|$|An {{important}} {{way to maintain}} your personal health {{is to have a}} healthy diet. A healthy diet includes a variety of plant-based and animal-based foods that provide nutrients to your body. Such nutrients give you energy and keep your body running. Nutrients help build and strengthen bones, muscles, and tendons and also regulate body processes (i.e. blood pressure). The food guide pyramid is a pyramid-shaped guide of healthy foods divided into sections. Each section shows the recommended intake for each food group (i.e. Protein, Fat, Carbohydrates, and Sugars). Making healthy food choices is important because it can lower <b>your</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> disease, developing some types of cancer, and it will contribute to maintaining a healthy weight.|$|E

40|$|Having {{high blood}} {{cholesterol}} puts you at <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> disease, {{the leading cause}} of death in the United States. People with high cholesterol have about twice the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> disease as people with lower levels. Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance. Your body needs some cholesterol, but it can build up on the walls of your arteries and lead to heart disease and stroke when you have too much in your blood. 71 million American adults (33. 5 %) have high low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or “bad, ” cholesterol. 1 Only 1 out of every 3 adults with high LDL cholesterol has the condition under control. 1 Less than half of adults with high LDL cholesterol get treatment. 1 Lowering your cholesterol can reduce <b>your</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> having a <b>heart</b> attack, needing heart bypass surgery or angioplasty, and dying <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> disease. Exercising, eating a healthy diet, and not smoking will help you prevent high cholesterol and reduce your levels. High cholesterol has no symptoms, so many people don’t know that their cholesterol is too high. Your doctor can do a simple blood test to check your levels. The National Cholesterol Education Program recommends that adults get their cholesterol checked every five years.

Participants rated how much they wanted to taste full-, reduced-, and no-fat cream cheeses, and they chose 1 type to eat. People in the warning- and no-label groups wanted to taste the full-fat product more than those in the information-label group. People in the warning- and information-label groups were less likely to eat the full-fat product han those in the no-label group. People reacted to the warning label but avoided the full-fat product. For products with credible and familiar isks, information labels may be more effective than warning labels because they don't arouse reactance. So great is man's hunger for forbidden food!

Mark Twain, Pudd'nhead Wilson American society seems to be moving more and more toward the idea that warning labels are desirable for a variety of products, from fatty foods to Internet access paths.

40|$|What is cholesterol, and whatdoes {{it have to}} do withdisease of {{the blood}} vessels and heart? Cholesterol is a fatty sub-stance that is present in all the cells in your body. Cholesterol travels in your blood in {{particles}} called lipoproteins. Three of the common lipoproteins are low-density lipoproteins (LDL), high-density lipoproteins (HDL), and very low density lipoproteins (VLDL). Medical {{studies have shown that}} ele-vated levels of LDL cholesterol are associated with an increased <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> developing blockages in the coronary arteries, whereas elevated levels of HDL cholesterol reduce that risk. Thus, doctors sometimes refer to LDL as “bad cholesterol ” and to HDL as “good cholesterol. ” Cholesterol comes from 2 sources. Your body makes some cholesterol, and you also get cholesterol in foods that come from an animal (meat, milk, eggs, or anything made from these). Eating too much of these foods may increase the total amount of cholester-ol in your body. Your body needs cholesterol to work properly. However, excess cho-lesterol can deposit in your arteries and promote formation of a deposit known as a plaque, which can grow larger over time; this process is called athero-sclerosis. A piece of the plaque may break off and a blood clot may form on the exposed surface of the plaque. These blood clots may block or de-crease the blood flow and oxygen sup-ply to your heart, brain, and other body parts. If the blockage is significant, you may have a heart attack or stroke, need a procedure performed on your heart to improve the supply of blood to your heart muscle (bypass surgery, angioplasty, or stent placement), or die prematurely from cardiovascular dis-ease. One {{of the best ways to}} decrease <b>your</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> having a <b>heart</b> attack or stroke is to control the amount of cholesterol in your blood...|$|R
