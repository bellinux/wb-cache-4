500|$|In January 1991, {{following}} her departure from Automatic Dlamini, Harvey formed her own band with former bandmates Rob Ellis and Ian Oliver. Harvey decided {{to name the}} trio PJ Harvey after rejecting other names as [...] "nothing felt right at all or just suggested the wrong type of sound", and also {{to allow her to}} continue music as a solo artist. The trio consisted of Harvey on vocals and guitars, Ellis on drums and backing vocals, and Oliver on bass. Oliver later departed to rejoin the still-active Automatic Dlamini. He was subsequently replaced with Steve Vaughan. The trio's [...] "disastrous" [...] debut performance was held at a skittle alley in Charmouth Village Hall in April 1991. Harvey later recounted the event saying: [...] "we started playing and I suppose there was about fifty people there, and during the first song we cleared the hall. There was only about two people left. And a woman came up to us, came up to my drummer, it was only a three piece, while we were playing and shouted at him 'Don't you realize nobody likes you! We'll pay you, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>stop</b> playing, we'll still pay you!'" ...|$|E

[...] In every country except China, {{the rate of}} suicide in men is {{higher than that of}} women, and life {{expectancy}} is routinely less for men than women in all countries. To this end, [...] "Global Action on Men’s Health (GAMH) wants the World Health Organisation and other international public health bodies, as well as individual governments, to acknowledge the scale of the problems facing men and boys and to take sustained action to tackle them. This work should sit alongside continuing action to improve the health of women and girls." [...] Glen Poole, an IMD coordinator wrote a book entitled [...] "How <b>You</b> <b>Can</b> <b>Stop</b> Male Suicide in 7 Simple Steps," [...] summarized with the motto [...] "Learn, love, listen." ...|$|E

2500|$|Asquith {{followed}} this {{by agreeing to}} hold Commissions of Inquiry into {{the conduct of the}} Dardanelles and of the Mesopotamian campaign, where Allied forces had been forced to surrender at Kut. Sir Maurice Hankey, Secretary to the War Committee, considered that; [...] "the Coalition never recovered. For (its) last five months, the function of the Supreme Command was carried out under the shadow of these inquests." [...] But these mistakes were overshadowed by the limited progress and immense casualties of the Battle of the Somme, which began on 1 July 1916, and then by another devastating personal loss, the death of Asquith's son Raymond, on 15 September at the Battle of Flers–Courcelette. Asquith's relationship with his eldest son had not been easy. Raymond wrote to his wife in early 1916; [...] "If Margot talks any more bosh to you about the inhumanity of her stepchildren <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>stop</b> her mouth by telling her that during my 10 months exile here the P.M. has never written me a line of any description." [...] But Raymond's death was shattering, Violet writing; [...] "…to see Father suffering so wrings one", and Asquith passed much of the following months [...] "withdrawn and difficult to approach". The War brought no respite, Churchill writing that; [...] "The failure to break the German line in the Somme, the recovery of the Germanic powers in the East , the ruin of Roumania and the beginnings of renewed submarine warfare strengthened and stimulated all those forces which insisted upon still greater vigour in the conduct of affairs." ...|$|E
