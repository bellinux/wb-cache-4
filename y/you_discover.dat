5|$|Meanwhile, Kecal is {{attempting}} to buy Jeník off, and after some verbal fencing makes a straight cash offer: a hundred florins if Jeník will renounce Mařenka. Not enough, is the reply. When Kecal increases the offer to 300florins, Jeník pretends to accept, but imposes a condition – no one but Mícha's son {{will be allowed to}} wed Mařenka. Kecal agrees, and rushes off to prepare the contract. Alone, Jeník ponders the deal he has apparently made to barter his beloved ("When <b>you</b> <b>discover</b> whom you've bought"), wondering how anyone could believe that he would really do this, and finally expressing his love for Mařenka.|$|E

25|$|Cruyff is {{sometimes}} {{described as a}} typical kind of ‘artist-footballer’ or ‘footballer-thinker’ who considers football, the so-called 'beautiful game', not a purely athletic/physical competition but an artistic-oriented mind-body game. Because of his distinctive footballing views, Cruyff was called ‘the Spinoza of football’ by some. He believed in a certain style of play, which {{has the power to}} put a smile on the people's faces as he described it. When Cruyff, both as a player and as a manager, spoke about football he often mentioned the entertainment value of the game, that there is more to it than winning. In a 2009 interview with Sportmails Martin Samuel, Arsène Wenger, as a devout follower of Cruyff's footballing ideology, once shared his opinion about football's artistic value, “I believe the target of anything in life should be to do it so well that it becomes an art. When you read some books they are fantastic, the writer touches something in you that you know you would not have brought out of yourself. He makes <b>you</b> <b>discover</b> something interesting in your life. If you are living like an animal, {{what is the point of}} living? What makes daily life interesting is that we try to transform it to something that is close to art. And football is like that. When I watch Barcelona, it is art.” , the author of Cruyff's French biography, called him ‘the greatest actor in the history of football’ because Cruyff was a glorious exception (possibly the only one ever) being the man who ‘played’ outstandingly well multiple roles in the world of football: player, manager, and thinker.|$|E

500|$|The R1 {{releases}} contain several special features, {{including four}} episodes with optional commentary in each season, bloopers, deleted scenes, and featurettes. The R2/4 releases contain no commentaries and fewer other special features, but the episodes {{are presented in}} anamorphic widescreen, while R1 releases are fullscreen. Adam Tyner of DVD Talk gave the R1 first season three out of five stars for audio and video, and {{three and a half}} stars for special features. Shannon Nutt of DVD Talk gave the R1 second season three stars out of five for audio and video, and {{two and a half stars}} for extras, stating: [...] "it appears [...] a decent number of features, but then <b>you</b> <b>discover</b> the length of each one and really feel short-changed by Fox". She also noted the episode's commentary was mainly by writers and producers, and did not feature James Cameron or any of the actors.|$|E
500|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} in Radio Slobodna Evropa, Ljupcho Jolevski called the album [...] "magical and multilayered... an accomplishment which has an instant likability, but which <b>you</b> <b>discover</b> with each next listen". Jolevski praised the team responsible for the arrangement and the instrumentation for their efforts to give their best in the album's songs. He described the sound of Makedonsko Devojče 2 as a mixture of Macedonian folklore and the [...] "ocean of worldwide sounds". According to Jolevski, the album elevates to an [...] "amazing collection of songs which defy the ugliness of rhythms and simple lyrics which we are splashed with on a daily basis". At the end of his article, Jolevski concluded that Gočeva has reached her musical zenith and the brightest point of her career with the album characteristic of her hometown, Bitola. He concluded that the album [...] "brings the sounds and customs of the Old Bazaar of Bitola, the city that even nowadays somehow resists the turbo-attacks from all sides".|$|E
500|$|Blakeman {{said that}} she read the book in a single sitting, before [...] "crying her eyes out". The film {{includes}} the themes of bullying, youth crime, domestic violence, unwanted pregnancy, and teenage angst. For Blakeman, April's [...] "heartbreaking journey in searching for her real mum is also about being brave enough to let love in." [...] Tom Sutcliffe, writing for The Independent, spoke {{of the limits of}} taboo themes in family dramas, and said the film's [...] "account of a life lived in care couldn't have had swearing, or casual drug use, and when a shadow fell over a child's bed at night, it wasn't the care-home manager coming to exercise some horrible , as it might have been in an adult drama". The film also addressed the theme of Asperger syndrome through the character of Poppy. The BBC claimed that Clark, who has the condition herself, was able to offer [...] "a unique take" [...] on the role. Steveson summarised the themes of the film, saying that [...] "At the centre of the story, Marion finds out that she loves this girl. And that is an amazing liberation when <b>you</b> <b>discover</b> someone more important to you than you are. That is what is incredible about becoming a parent – you care about your child more than you care about yourself." ...|$|E

500|$|A stained smiley {{face is a}} {{recurring}} image in the story, appearing in many forms. In The System of Comics, Thierry Groensteen described the symbol as {{a recurring}} motif that produces [...] "rhyme and remarkable configurations" [...] by appearing in key segments of Watchmen, notably {{the first and last}} pages of the series—spattered with blood on the first, and sauce from a hamburger on the last. Groensteen cites it as one form of the circle shape that appears throughout the story, as a [...] "recurrent geometric motif" [...] and due to its symbolic connotations. Gibbons created a smiley face badge as an element of The Comedian's costume in order to [...] "lighten" [...] the overall design, later adding a splash of blood to the badge to imply his murder. Gibbons said the creators came to regard the blood-stained smiley face as [...] "a symbol for the whole series", noting its resemblance to the Doomsday Clock ticking up to midnight. Moore drew inspiration from psychological tests of behaviorism, explaining that the tests had presented the face as [...] "a symbol of complete innocence". With the addition of a blood splash over the eye, the face's meaning was altered to become simultaneously radical and simple enough for the first issue's cover to avoid human detail. Although most evocations of the central image were created on purpose, others were coincidental. Moore mentioned in particular that [...] "the little plugs on the spark hydrants, if you turn them upside down, <b>you</b> <b>discover</b> a little smiley face".|$|E

But if you look at it from behind, <b>you</b> <b>discover</b> the truth. ...Whoever gives in to such self-absorbed vanity has huge misery hiding inside them".

2500|$|Folklorist Sabina Magliocco {{supported}} this idea, noting {{that a great}} many of those Californian Pagans whom she interviewed claimed that they had been greatly interested in mythology and folklore as children, imagining a world of [...] "enchanted nature and magical transformations, filled with lords and ladies, witches and wizards, and humble but often wise peasants". Magliocco noted that it was this world that pagans [...] "strive to re-create in some measure". Further support for Adler's idea came from American Wiccan priestess Judy Harrow, who noted that among her comrades, there was a feeling that [...] "you don't become pagan, <b>you</b> <b>discover</b> that you always were". They have also been supported by Pagan studies scholar Graham Harvey.|$|E
2500|$|In February 2013, Yorke {{told the}} Guardian that though Radiohead {{had hoped to}} subvert the {{corporate}} music industry with In Rainbows, he feared they had instead played {{into the hands of}} content providers such as Apple and Google: [...] "They have to keep commodifying things to keep the share price up, but in doing so they have made all content, including music and newspapers, worthless, in order to make their billions. And this is what we want?" [...] Later that year, Yorke and Godrich made headlines for their criticism of the music streaming service Spotify. In July, they removed Atoms for Peace and Yorke's solo music from the service. In a series of tweets, Yorke wrote: [...] "Make no mistake, new artists <b>you</b> <b>discover</b> on Spotify will not get paid. Meanwhile shareholders will shortly be rolling in it... New artists get paid fuck-all with this model." [...] Yorke called Spotify [...] "the last gasp of the old industry", accusing it of only benefiting major labels with large back catalogues, and encouraged artists to build their own [...] "direct connections" [...] with audiences instead.|$|E
