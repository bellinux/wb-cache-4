25|$|Traditionally, yoga {{was taught}} one on one—one teacher {{teaching}} one student at a time. In modern times, yoga {{is more often}} taught in group classes. The Jivamukti In-Class Private (or ICP) allows students to experience both methods of teaching simultaneously: the student {{and his or her}} private certified Jivamukti Yoga teacher together attend a regular group class. From beginning to end, the student practices with the guidance and hands-on assists of the private teacher. ICPs always conclude with a special deep relaxation yoga massage in shavasana, or corpse pose. An ICP can be adapted to almost any Jivamukti <b>Yoga</b> <b>class,</b> but is most frequently given in an Open class.|$|E

40|$|Women in the {{postpartum}} period face {{a number}} of physical and emotional challenges that research results indicate could be alleviated through exercise. Unfortunately, many new mothers are unable to participate in regular exercise due {{to a variety of}} personal and societally constructed obstacles. There is a growing trend to incorporate babies into <b>yoga</b> <b>classes</b> in an effort to increase the accessibility of postpartum exercise. There has been limited research conducted regarding the effectiveness of this emerging trend, and none have examined the feelings of participants engaged in mother and baby <b>yoga</b> <b>classes.</b> To address this gap in the literature, the experiences of 17 new mothers who participated in mother and baby <b>yoga</b> <b>classes</b> were explored. Four focus group semi-structured interviews were conducted utilizing feminist methodology designed to create an egalitarian and empowering experience. A thematic data analysis produced 12 higher-order themes aggregated into four preliminary general categories, including transformation, therapeutic experiences in class, community in class, and mamas’ solutions for mamas. Results indicated that mothers relied on these classes to provide physical and emotional healing during their transition to motherhood. Mother and baby <b>yoga</b> <b>classes</b> provided educational, social, and exercise opportunities for the women. The mother and baby <b>yoga</b> <b>classes</b> offered a unique format to provide health and wellness benefits to a potentially vulnerable and underserved population...|$|R
