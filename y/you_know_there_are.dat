2500|$|Mark Driscoll {{responded to}} {{criticism}} in a post to CNN's Belief Blog, writing: [...] "You {{try to write}} a book on marriage and sex with your wife and next thing <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> a lot of ants crashing your picnic." [...] He wrote that he and Grace anticipated criticism [...] "from all sides" [...] but felt it would be worthwhile anyway, because [...] "we want to help marriages and single people aspiring to marry...." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ginsberg {{responded in}} a 1958 {{interview}} with The Village Voice, specifically addressing {{the charge that}} the Beats destroyed [...] "the distinction between life and literature". In the interview, he stated that [...] "the bit about anti-intellectualism {{is a piece of}} vanity, we had the same education, went to the same school, <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> 'Intellectuals' and there are intellectuals. Podhoretz is just out of touch with twentieth-century literature, he's writing for the eighteenth-century mind. We have a personal literature now—Proust, Wolfe, Faulkner, Joyce." ...|$|E

Lisa replies [...] "Ewwww!" [...] In the 1995 video release of the {{original}} Star Wars trilogy, there was an interview with George Lucas conducted by Maltin included {{before the start of}} the movies. Maltin is listed in the Guinness Book of World Records for the world's shortest movie review; his two-star review of the 1948 musical Isn't It Romantic? consists of the word [...] "No". In 1985 he delivered a three-word movie review on Entertainment Tonight for that year's horror film spoof, Transylvania 6-5000. The review begins with a silent Maltin swaying to a recording of the Glenn Miller Orchestra playing [...] "Pennsylvania 6-5000", wherein the instrumental melody is interrupted by the sound of a telephone ringing (part of the original recording), after which the band chants the title of the song. In his review, Maltin timed it so that his review began with the phone ringing: [...] "Transylvania 6-5000 ... stinks!" ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 1996 the Israeli weekly {{newspaper}} Kol Ha'ir published the personal accounts of {{several members of}} the Israeli artillery battery responsible for the shelling of the Qana camp. The soldiers spoke under condition of anonymity. One acknowledged that they were encouraged by their commander after the attack: [...] "He told us it was war. Come on, the bastards fire at you, what can you do? He told us we were firing well and we should keep it up, and that Arabs, <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> millions of them," [...] Soldier A was quoted as saying. Another artilleryman, Soldier T, was quoted as saying that [...] "no-one spoke about it {{as if it was a}} mistake. We did our job and we are at peace with that. Even 'S' told us we were great and that they were just a bunch of Arabs (in Hebrew, 'arabushim')...How many Arabs are there and how many Jews? A few 'arabushim' die, there is no harm in that." [...] Similar sentiments were expressed by another soldier, Soldier Y, who remarked, [...] "it's a war, in a war these things happen...It's just a bunch of Arabs. Why are you taking it so hard?" [...] An official army spokesman's statement questioned the accuracy of Kol Ha'ir report.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Well, no, you won't, maybe. In fact I {{hope you}} won't; for I {{want you to}} learn {{something}} by that experience. Didn't <b>you</b> <b>KNOW</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no bottom in that crossing?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a pause. I had {{a sort of}} intuition {{that the}} moment was coming. So I think had she. You may scoff, of course, at these intuitions----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How did {{you come}} here instead of Gardiner; and how do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> {{anything}} for <b>you</b> to trouble about?" [...] I asked, and the sergeant showed a trace of impatience.|$|R

5000|$|A simple {{strategy}} {{to assist in}} using this theorem is to [...] "paint" [...] (sometimes called [...] "shade") the outside and the inside areas. When you see two outside cells, or two inside cells next to each other, then <b>you</b> <b>know</b> that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> not a line between them. The converse is also true: if <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no line between two cells, then those cells must be the same [...] "color" [...] (both inside or both outside). Similarly, if an outside cell and an inside cell <b>are</b> adjacent, <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>there</b> must <b>be</b> a filled line between them; and again the converse is true.|$|R
