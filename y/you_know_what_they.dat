Egoyan {{assembled}} many Canadian actors he had worked with in prior films, including Bruce Greenwood, Gabrielle Rose and Sarah Polley. Egoyan explained the benefit of working with a familiar cast, saying [...] "When you’re working on a limited production schedule, it’s a comfort {{to know that you}} know the personalities involved, <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> need as opposed to having to discover that and be surprised by that." ...|$|E
500|$|Veronica Mars has {{attracted}} a loyal and dedicated fan base. A group of fans calling themselves the [...] "Cloud Watchers" [...] organized several campaigns to bring more viewers to the series to ensure its continuation. The group hired a plane to fly over the CW offices, carrying a banner reading [...] "Renew Veronica Mars". The group hired street teams in New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and Chicago to distribute 30,000 fliers advertising the series' return after its midseason hiatus in the third season. The [...] "Cloud Watchers" [...] raised $50,000 in donations and through the sale of Veronica Mars clothing and tchotchkes. Upon the cancellation of the series, fans sent more than 10,000 Mars Bars to the CW, hoping that the network would reverse its decision and renew the series. Rob Thomas thanked the fans of the series for their efforts, saying [...] "I love those people {{and they have been}} so good to me, but it's not going to happen." [...] A feature film continuation was made possible in 2013 through a Kickstarter fund, in which 91,585 fans donated $5,702,153 to get the film made. Fans have also come to refer to themselves and be referred to as [...] "Marshmallows" [...] by media as well as the cast and crew of the series after a line delivered by Wallace (Percy Daggs III) in the pilot episode: [...] "You're a marshmallow, Veronica Mars. A Twinkie." [...] At the end of the same episode, Veronica in voiceover remarks [...] "Well, <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> say: 'Veronica Mars, she's a marshmallow.'" [...] A reference to the term was also included in the fan-funded film.|$|E
500|$|During an interview, Tempah {{commented on}} his second album: [...] "I always {{like to work with}} {{different}} people on each project I do, just so you get a different sound and angle. I will be working with some of the same people I did for the first album, <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> say ‘if it ain't broke then don’t try and fix it’." [...] Tempah hoped to collaborate with other artists: [...] "I really want to collaborate with Toronto's very own Drake. I think he's amazing at what he does. I'd also like to collaborate with Adele, Sleigh Bells, Lykke Li, The Script, Dev, James Blake ― those are the few that I'd really like to work with." [...] Tempah asked a number of artists to appear on the album, including Gary Barlow, Chris Martin, Dizzee Rascal, and The Script. At the 2012 BRIT Awards, Tempah announced his second album would be called Demonstration. On 24 June 2012, Tempah performed on the main stage at Radio 1's Hackney Weekend, performing two of his newest songs: [...] "Mosh Pit" [...] and [...] "Drinking from the Bottle", the latter of which he features on with Calvin Harris as the lead artist, and features on Harris' 2012 album 18 Months. In interviews, other artists announced that they were working on his album such as Labrinth, Dizzee Rascal, Big Sean and Emeli Sandé. Previous collaborators Naughty Boy and Labrinth have produced multiple tracks for the album, following their appearances on Disc-Overy. Chase & Status were on additional production duties for [...] "Mosh Pit". They had previously worked with Tinie on their album No More Idols for the single [...] "Hitz". Tempah's vocals from the song are also sampled on the hidden track [...] "5 Minutes".|$|E

2500|$|While {{away on a}} trip to England in March 2004, Christopher {{received}} an email from Joan Porco's account admonishing him for failing classes at Hudson Valley Community College in Troy, NY. In the message, Joan and Peter complained to their son, [...] "You just left and (we) can't believe (our) eyes as I look at your interim grade report. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> say, 'Three strikes and you're out.' Explain yourself." [...] The email's subject header was [...] "Failing Grades-You did it again!" [...] Several days later, Christopher replied in a message to his father. Blaming the community college's office of registrar, he wrote, [...] "ut obviously they are incorrect...My lowest grade that I got on anything was a B on a physics test...Don't jump to conclusions, I'm fine." [...] Porco earned readmission to the University of Rochester with a forged transcript from HVCC. Judge Berry refused to allow prosecutors to use the forged transcripts as evidence in their criminal case against Christopher Porco.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the wake}} of the March 2006 {{incident}} with the Capitol Police officer, Rep. McKinney was in the news, and her office invited the media to attend one of her monthly [...] "District Days," [...] where she spends one full day meeting with constituents to discuss issues of concern. At her April 23, 2006, [...] "District Days" [...] event, Rep. McKinney was being interviewed by WGCL's Renee Starzyk, who repeatedly questioned her about the March 29 scuffle with a Capitol police officer. Frustrated, McKinney stood up and apparently forgot she was still wearing the microphone. Her offscreen comments were captured on tape. She was heard saying, [...] "Oh, crap, now <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> ... <b>they</b> lied to , and Coz is a fool." [...] McKinney returned on screen with the microphone, this time with instructions on what parts of the interview the station was allowed to use: [...] "anything that is captured by your audio ... that is captured while I'm not seated in this chair is off the record and is not permissible [...] to be used ... is that understood?" [...] The comments from the interview were subsequently aired on CBS and eventually across the nation.|$|E

2500|$|... "They're a lie," [...] said Gelbart in a 1992 interview. [...] "You're telling an {{engineer}} when {{to push a}} button to produce a laugh from people who don't exist. It's just so dishonest. The biggest shows {{when we were on}} the air were All in the Family and The Mary Tyler Moore Show both of which were taped before a live studio audience where laughter made sense," [...] continued Gelbart. [...] "But our show was a film show – supposedly shot in the middle of Korea. So the question I always asked the network was, 'Who are these laughing people? Where did they come from?'" [...] Gelbart persuaded CBS to test the show in private screenings with and without the laugh track. The results showed no measurable difference in the audience's enjoyment. [...] "So <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> said?" [...] Gelbart said. [...] "'Since there's no difference, let's leave it alone!' The people who defend laugh tracks have no sense of humor." [...] Gelbart summed up the situation by saying, [...] "I always thought it cheapened the show. The network got their way. They were paying for dinner." ...|$|E

50|$|Carlos Saldanha, the {{director}} of the film, strove to make the characters eyes appear alive and not mechanical. “You want the facial expressions to work.
