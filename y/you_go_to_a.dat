500|$|The {{music of}} Megadeth and its {{underground}} metal contemporaries from the 1980s featured harsh vocals, double bass drum patterns, staccato riffing, tremolo picking, and screeching lead guitar work; albums {{from this period}} were produced on low budgets. After forming Megadeth, Mustaine followed the thrash metal style of his previous band, Metallica, with more emphasis on speed and intensity. Megadeth's music is characterized by its neat instrumental performance, featuring fast rhythm sections, complex arrangements, and [...] "snarling" [...] vocals. When asked to describe Megadeth's guitar style, Mustaine answered: [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> show and see a guitar player who just stands there, that's a guitar player. A thrash guitar player {{is a guy who}} plays like he wants to beat the guitar's guts out." [...] Most of the songs are recorded in standard guitar tuning as Mustaine believes it to provide a superior melody to alternative methods of tuning.|$|E

You do see some ingenious daredevil feats, but they're crowded {{together}} and, the way they're set up, they don't give you the irresponsible, giddy tingle you're hoping for." [...] Kael also singled out the dispirited direction and the hopeless script. [...] "Director John Glen stages the slaughter scenes so apathetically that the picture itself seems dissociated. (I don't think I've ever seen another movie in which race horses were mistreated and the director failed to work up any indignation. If Glen has any emotions about what he puts on the screen, he keeps them to himself.)" ...|$|E

500|$|Brosnan left Ireland on 12 August 1964 and was {{reunited with}} his mother and her new husband, William Carmichael, now living in the Scottish village of Longniddry, East Lothian. Carmichael took Brosnan to see a James Bond film for the first time (Goldfinger), at the age of 11. Later moving back to London, Brosnan was educated at Elliott School, a state {{comprehensive}} school in Putney, southwest London, now known as Ark Putney Academy. Brosnan has spoken about the transition from Ireland to England and his education in London; [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> very large city, a metropolis like London, as an Irish boy of 10, life suddenly moves pretty fast. From a little school of, say, seven classrooms in Ireland, to this very large comprehensive school, with over 2,000 children. And you're Irish. And they make you feel it; the British have a wonderful way of doing that, and I had a certain deep sense of being an outsider." [...] When he attended school, his nickname was [...] "Irish".|$|E
500|$|Loud is a {{departure}} from the personal, melodramatic themes of Rated R. Stylistically, it is a return to the Caribbean-inspired dance-pop of Rihanna's earlier work. Ryan Burleson of Consequence of Sound described the album as [...] "a dynamic R and dance-pop record". In an interview with MTV, Rihanna said [...] "I wanted songs that were all Rihanna songs, that nobody else could do. I didn't want the generic pop record that Ke$ha or Lady Gaga or Katy Perry could just do and it'll work. I wanted a song, or songs, that were Rihanna songs, that only I could do, had that little West Indian vibe to it, had that certain tone, a certain sass and a certain energy." [...] During the promotion of Loud, Rihanna said that much of the music was born out of frustration. She explained: [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> club and have to listen to bad music you revert to the liquor, because {{you want to have a}} good time. I hate having to skip a track. I wanted to make an album you can just play." ...|$|E
500|$|In two {{separate}} 2016 AMAs on Reddit, both Nick Jonas and Joe Jonas {{reflected on the}} episode.

[...] "But years later and once the purity rings were no longer around, it was very funny to me and I've actually watched the episode a few times." [...] "I loved it. When it first came out I was so pumped". Joe said. [...] "I know that Nick was really kind of not into watching it, but I {{thought it was the}} funniest thing at the time and it's kind of a compliment because obviously if <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> comedy show and they pick you out and make fun of you, you can't heckle back, you gotta just take it and enjoy it, and for me I've always been a fan and I knew that was kind of a wow we made it moment, and also they were kind of attacking Disney more than me, so I didn't really feel threatened. Now I watch it back and laugh and Mickey kicked my ass so I won the episode by being beat up by Mickey Mouse." ...|$|E

But what's the point of passing gun laws if we're not going to enforce them? If you want to talk about gun control, that's where you need to start. We've got 300 gun laws on the books right now.

2500|$|Grace took a vehemently pro-prosecution {{position}} {{throughout the}} 2006 Duke University lacrosse case, in which Crystal Gail Mangum, a stripper and North Carolina Central University student, falsely accused {{three members of}} Duke University's men's lacrosse team of raping her at a party.

During a tour to Hazard, Kentucky, Warnke met Rose Hall, a thrice-divorced mother of three children. At this time, Warnke began courting Hall while still married to his second wife.

5000|$|Education in Changtu city {{is taken}} very seriously.
