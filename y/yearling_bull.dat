No significant (P > 0. 10) feed additive (FA) main effects were observed for any of the feedlot performance variables and carcass characteristics with the exception of dressing percentage. <b>Yearling</b> <b>bulls</b> receiving PAP had a decreased (P = 0. 047) dressing percentage when compared with <b>yearling</b> <b>bulls</b> receiving MON.

Foram utilizados machos mestiços de raças de corte, inteiros, com idade de 10 meses e peso médio inicial de 192 ± 12 kg. As seguintes variáveis foram avaliadas: massa e oferta de forragem, altura do pasto, taxa de acúmulo diário e acúmulo total de forragem, ganho de peso médio diário (GMD), carga animal e ganho de peso vivo por unidade de área (GPA), além de características qualitativas de carcaça. Os novilhos foram abatidos aos 14 meses de idade. O GMD ajustou-se a um modelo de regressão quadrático e teve o ponto de máximo desempenho entre 20 e 25 cm de altura de pré-pastejo, enquanto o GPA ajustou-se a um modelo linear negativo.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Owing to {{the lack}} of {{information}} in the literature about the ideal feeding frequency adopted by feedlot systems, {{this study was designed to}} evaluate the effect of different feeding frequencies on performance, carcass traits, feeding behavior and rumen morphometrics of Nellore cattle. Forty-eight <b>yearling</b> <b>bulls</b> were housed in individual pens with an average initial body weight of 358. 2 kg. The experiment was designed as a completely randomized block and the treatments were the feeding of cattle one, two, three, or four times daily (n = 12 per treatment). Orthogonal contrasts were used to assess linear, quadratic and cubic relationship between feeding frequency and the dependent variable. As feeding frequency increased, final body weight (p = 0. 03) and average daily gain (p = 0. 01; one: 0. 98 kg d– 1; two: 0. 96 kg d– 1; three: 1. 18 kg d– 1; four: 1. 14 kg d– 1) increased linearly and the feed:gain ratio decreased (p = 0. 02). Also, as feeding frequency increased, hot carcass weight was affected cubically (p = 0. 01; one: 246. 9 kg; two: 243. 0 kg; three: 263. 1 kg; four: 258. 1 kg). During the adaptation period dry matter intake variation was affected cubically (p ≤ 0. 05; one: 16 %; two: 23 %; three: 14 %; four: 16 %). Increases in feeding frequency affected papillae height (p < 0. 01) and papillae surface area (p < 0. 01) cubically, as well as producing increases in the mitotic index (p = 0. 05; one: 9 %; two: 11 %; three: 13 %; four: 13 %) and cells in proliferation (p = 0. 05) linearly.

40|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{challenges}} facing cow/calf producers today is cutting their costs of production. One possible strategy for lowering costs is to increase the production efficiency of the cow herd. A key area to focus on is the reproductive function of the beef bull because natural mating accounts for over 95 % of the pregnancies achieved each year in the 33. 7 million beef cows in the U. S. It is becoming apparent that perhaps because of increased selection pressure on scrotal circumference, the modern beef bull is more fertile than the bull of yesterday, yet the majority of beef bulls are still being mated at traditional bull to female ratios of 1 : 20 to 1 : 30. Utilizing bulls to their full breeding potential is one of the quickest and simplest ways a producer can cut costs. Unfortunately, however, determining a bulls breeding potential has been either elusive in the case of <b>yearling</b> <b>bulls</b> or labor intensive in the case of mature bulls. As a predictor of natural service fertility, most beef bulls undergo a breeding soundness examination prior to either sale or breeding; however, sex drive and mating ability are not commonly measured though both are essential for impregnation of females. Tests have been developed to measure a bulls mating ability or serving capacity. However, past studies investigating the relationship between serving capacity and herd fertility have been inconclusive with some researchers finding no relationship and other researchers reporting serving capacity tests to be an accurate predictor of bull fertility. Many of these studies differed in testing procedures and utilized bulls of different ages with varying levels of sexual experience; thus, differences in the findings may rest with these factors. Because most cattle producers in the United States are purchasing bulls at 12 to 15 months of age (virgins), most serving capacity work in the United States has focused on the serving capacity testing of <b>yearling</b> <b>bulls...</b>|$|R

For vt, 23 animals were positive at both samplings, 26 negative at both samplings, 22 negative animals became positive and 12 positive animals became negative. Sixty-eight per cent of the discordant pairs changed from vt-negative to vt-positive (95 % CI 48 - 80) suggesting pressure toward becoming vt-positive perhaps due to the transfer of genes due to mixing of cattle in the months between samplings or an effect of chlortetracycline...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine the}} blood chemical variables and compare changes that occurred with ruptured bladders and ruptured urethras in steers and <b>yearling</b> <b>bulls.</b> The fatality rates were 10. 5 % in steers with ruptured urethras and 50. 8 % in steers with ruptured bladders. Both groups had significantly decreased serum sodium and chloride values and significantly increased serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and plasma protein concentrations compared to the normal group. Steers with ruptured bladders were more dehydrated, had significantly lower serum sodium and chloride values and had significantly higher blood urea nitrogen concentrations than steers with ruptured urethras. The combination of a decreased serum sodium, a decreased serum chloride, and a decreased ratio of serum phosphate to blood urea nitrogen occurred consistently within the ruptured bladder group. Of the variables examined, serum phosphate was the best prognostic indicator in the steers with ruptured bladders as all of the steers that died had a serum phosphate in excess of 2. 9 mmol/L. The fluid and electrolyte changes are discussed. PUBM: Print; JID: 0004653; ppublishSource type: Electronic(1...|$|R
40|$|My name is Chad Blair {{and along}} with my, dad Ed, uncle Rich, cousin Britton, and our wives, we operate Blair Brothers Angus Ranch in western South Dakota. Currently we run around 1200 cows and 400 to 500 {{replacement}} heifers that all get AIed over two cycles. We also market between 350 and 500 <b>yearling</b> <b>bulls</b> each year that are sold private treaty off the place. We run around 2000 head of yearling cattle that include steers out of our bulls and purchased replacement heifers out of our bulls that will be resold to other customers. We do all of our own calving, AIing, ultrasounding and other cattle work. I was asked to give a producer perspective on reproductive technologies, so I am going to {{explain some of the}} technologies that we have tried and still use, and some that we have tried and no longer use, either because something better came along or it just didn’t work well for us. I will start with a timeline on AIing and work into other technologies that make our business operate smoothly...|$|R
