6000|$|... "Mr. Hartright, <b>you</b> <b>surprise</b> me. Whatever {{women may}} be, I thought that men, {{in the nineteenth}} century, were above superstition." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "So," [...] said he, [...] "this is {{the place}} where you rest, Old Mrs. Fox, after running Bowser almost off his feet.

6000|$|... "Of Peter! <b>You</b> <b>surprise</b> me, Benjamin. I {{think we}} could not be in better hands, since we have got this risk to run with the savages. If it was Pigeonswing that you feared, I could {{understand}} it." ...|$|R

60|$|He {{stopped and}} sat down on his feet, as a lucivee {{generally}} does when <b>you</b> <b>surprise</b> him, and stared at me steadily. When I went on again I knew that he was after me, though he had disappeared from the trail.|$|R
60|$|I {{forgot to}} say that <b>you</b> <b>surprised</b> and pleased me {{at the same time}} by your praise of my 'Sea-mew.'[23] Love to Annie. We were glad to hear that she did not {{continue}} unwell, and that you are well again, too. I hope you have had no return of the rheumatic pain.|$|E

6000|$|... "You don't {{know how}} <b>you</b> <b>surprise</b> me, how <b>you</b> relieve me," [...] she said, warmly--and pressed his hand. In the eagerness of her gratitude, in the gladness that had revived her sinking heart, {{she failed to}} feel that the {{pressure}} was not returned.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{would be}} an easy way of tryin' to look innercent," [...] went on the constable. [...] "They fixed it all up--blow open the safe, hide the silver an' other valerables, an' then, when <b>you</b> <b>surprise</b> 'em, they try to put the crime off on sumbuddy else." ...|$|R
