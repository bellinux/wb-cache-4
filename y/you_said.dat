5|$|SEN. DODD: Wait a minute. No, no, no. <b>You</b> <b>said</b> yes, {{you thought}} {{it made sense to}} do it.|$|E
5|$|You {{supported}} a stimulus package in 2009. In fact, <b>you</b> <b>said</b> the Obama stimulus package was not big enough. As governor, you signed onto a regional cap-and-trade market. You endorsed civil unions for same-sex couples. And you served as President Obama's ambassador to China. Some people {{have suggested that}} maybe you're running for president in the wrong party.|$|E
5|$|The Buccaneers, {{making their}} NFL debut against the Houston Oilers, {{averaged}} {{less than two}} yards per offensive play. They were unable to score despite being given good field position by two Oiler fumbles. Steve Spurrier completed 8 of 21 passes for 36 yards, and starting running backs Jimmy DuBose and Louis Carter rushed for 12 yards on 15 carries. Despite being outgained 169 to 8 by the second quarter, they were only behind 7–0 and missed a chance to tie the score when Lee McGriff dropped a Spurrier pass in the end zone. A later drive ended when Spurrier overthrew John McKay, Jr., instead hitting defender C.L. Whittington. A third chance to tie the score was lost when Mark Cotney dropped an interception of a Dan Pastorini pass with a clear path to the end zone. Whittington gave the Buccaneers {{the ball on the}} Oiler 11-yard line by fumbling a punt, but then killed the Buccaneers’ scoring chances by intercepting another Spurrier pass. Ronnie Coleman ran 25 times for 142 yards for the Oilers. McKay expressed concern over the team’s offense after the defeat, and responded to a reporter’s taunt of “I thought <b>you</b> <b>said</b> you were going to win some games?” by saying, “Houston has been in the league 6,000 years and still hasn’t won a championship. The Bucs will be heard from”. It was a day with a bad beginning, middle, and ending for the Buccaneers. The day began with the Buccaneers getting lost in the maze-like Astrodome interior, and ended with the team’s charter plane bouncing and rolling before righting itself on landing. In addition, starting tackle Dave Reavis was injured during pregame warmups and was lost for the season.|$|E

25|$|Reflecting on {{her work}} in musical films, Powell said: People are always fascinated by the {{so-called}} golden age of musicals, but it wasn’t all that great. Everything was glazed. Those movies didn’t reflect reality. I was at MGM for 11 years and nobody ever let me play anything but teenagers. I was 25 years old with kids of my own and it was getting ridiculous. Publicity was froth. Everything <b>you</b> <b>said</b> was monitored. With me, they didn’t have to worry. I never had anything to say, anyway. It was hard work, I had no friends, no social interaction with people my age and the isolation was tough. But I had to support my family, so I did what I was told and had no other choice.|$|E
25|$|Korea – as {{a platoon}} leader. Recon leader. What {{is the job}} of a recon leader? To recon the front line – no man’s land. And what did we do? I had to assault a {{fortified}} position of the Chinese communists and wiped them out. And what is this Special Forces group that we commanded in the Army – '62–'65? That was the only remaining combat unit in the Philippine Army. The rest were training in a division set-up. We were in Luzon. We were in Sulu. And then, during the previous regime, Marawi incident. Who was sent there? Ramos. We defended the camp, being besieged by 400 rebels. So next time, look at the man’s record, don't just write and write. <b>You</b> <b>said,</b> no combat experience, no combat experience. Look around you who comes from the platoon, who rose to battalion staff, company commander, group commander, which is like a battalion, brigade commander, here and abroad. Abroad, I never had an abroad assignment that was not combat. NO SOFT JOBS FOR RAMOS. Thirty-seven years in the Armed Forces. REMEMBER THAT. You’re only writing about the fringe, but do not allow yourself to destroy the armed forces by those guys. You write about the majority of the Armed Forces who are on the job. That's why we're here enjoying our freedom, ladies and gentlemen. You are here. If the majority of the Armed Forces did not do their job, I doubt very much if you’d all be here.|$|E

That's all that counts." [...] Conversely, Doby was criticized from players both active and retired. Noted former player Rogers Hornsby said, after watching Doby play one time in 1947: ...|$|E
500|$|We {{would have}} little family talks. They began at first with Malcolm telling me what he {{expected}} of a wife. But the first time I told him what I expected {{of him as a}} husband it came as a shock. After dinner one night he said, [...] "Boy, Betty, something <b>you</b> <b>said</b> hit me like a ton of bricks. Here I've been going along having our little workshops with me doing all the talking and you doing all the listening." [...] He concluded our marriage should be a mutual exchange.|$|E
500|$|The {{anthropologist}} Paul van der Grijp believes Oviri {{was intended}} [...] as an epithet to reinforce Gauguin's persona as a [...] "civilised savage". [...] The artist {{wrote in his}} final letter to Morice that [...] "You were wrong that day when <b>you</b> <b>said</b> I was wrong to say I was a savage. It's true enough: I am a savage. And civilised people sense the fact. In my work {{there is nothing that}} can surprise or disconcert, except the fact that I am a savage in spite of myself. That's also why my work is inimitable." ...|$|E

500|$|In Combs' first {{speech of}} the primary campaign, he {{admitted}} that the state needed to raise $25million ($ million in [...] dollars) in new revenue and that a sales tax should be considered. Chandler, the more experienced politician, attacked Combs for this suggestion, maintaining that an experienced governor like himself would not need to raise taxes to meet the state's obligations. Combs' speech was also attacked as dry and uninspiring, partly because he read it verbatim from prepared notes. [...] "And <b>you</b> <b>said</b> I couldn't give a speech," [...] Doc Beauchamp later complained to Clements. Hugh Morris, chief of the Louisville Courier-Journals Frankfort bureau, commented that [...] "Combs opened and closed his campaign on the same night".|$|E
500|$|Santos {{moved into}} a small apartment, where, one day, he started to sing [...] "Te Quiero, Dijiste" [...] (<b>You</b> <b>said</b> 'I Love You'). A member of the Trío Lírico was passing by and heard him sing. He then knocked on Santos' door. The trio member invited Daniel to join the trio and he accepted. Santos debuted with them on September 13, 1930; he sang in various social events and was paid a dollar for every song that he sang. He {{returned}} to Puerto Rico only to return once more to Manhattan after he unsuccessfully tried to acquire {{a job as a}} singer at WKAQ, {{which was one of the}} island's main radio stations.|$|E
500|$|Araya held {{concern about}} the lyrics that King penned to [...] "In the Name of God", voicing his opinion to guitarist Hanneman. King's {{viewpoint}} was; [...] "It's like, 'C'mon, man, you're in Slayer. You're the antichrist — <b>you</b> <b>said</b> it yourself on the first album!' You can't draw the line like that. Whether he agrees with it or not, he didn't write it — I wrote it. So you have to say, 'Well, it's {{just a part of}} being in this band.' Now Jeff and I, we don't give a fuck. If Jeff wrote something I had a problem with, I would never even raise a fucking finger. I'd be like, 'Fuck yeah, let's do it! Gonna piss someone off? Alright!'" ...|$|E

500|$|Asked whether Robbins and Torres might marry in the future, Capshaw replied: [...] "There's {{probably}} a lot more stuff that has to happen before that happens. [...] I don't think they're {{going to get married}} just to get married. As Arizona goes, I think she has incredible discipline and she does, as <b>you</b> <b>said,</b> have a very strict moral compass and marriage would not be something she would jump into without giving it a great amount of thought." [...] Discussing Robbins' relationship with Torres' former lover Sloan, Capshaw divulged: [...] "Whenever there's been a chance to play that I am intimidated by him or being standoffish, I've always chosen to make it very playful. It's much more Arizona's style to find it very amusing." ...|$|E
500|$|I {{felt sorry}} for him because he must really be stuck in the past. Not only has his music not evolved, but also homeboy is still obsessed with my wife, the same female that wouldn't let him get to second base from eight years ago. What type of grown ass man lies about getting with a chick? Only Slim Lamey! LOL! I’m putting this out there now. Marshall Mathers, you need to holler at me... Man to man, let’s meet up and deal with this like adults. So, Miss Marshall, I'm going to make you wish you never spoke my name and regret the ungodly things <b>you</b> <b>said</b> about my wife. Your legacy has now been tainted from this day forth! You will now be known as the rapper who lost to corny-ass Nick Cannon! ...|$|E
500|$|Championship runner-up Fernando Alonso {{expressed}} {{pride for}} his team, {{going so far}} as to call the 2012 season [...] "the best season of my career". During the podium interview with Nelson Piquet, he asserted: [...] "Obviously we lost the championship now, but I don't think, as <b>you</b> <b>said,</b> that we lost here in Brazil, we lost in some races where we were a little bit unlucky. But this is a sport, but when you do something with your heart, when you do something with 100 per cent, you have to be proud of your team, happy for them, and we will try next year." [...] The press later pointed out Alonso's [...] "grace after the race", contrasting him to Vettel who had criticized the competition's [...] "dirty tricks" [...] during his post-race press conference.|$|E

500|$|There is {{a slight}} {{difference}} in lyrics between the version used in [...] version and the one released on Shades of Purple. The Shades of Purple version includes the line [...] "then you start kissing me, what's that about?" [...] In the Pokémon version, the lyric is [...] "then <b>you</b> <b>said</b> you love me, what's that about?" [...] When asked about the lyric change in an interview, M2M replied [...] "the Pokémon people didn't find it appropriate to have kissing in the lyrics, because it was for younger kids. We think [...] was stupid. The original version is on , and that's the one {{we wanted to go}} with." [...] M2M had not heard of Pokémon until the song was chosen for the soundtrack, as the franchise was not yet popular in Norway.|$|E
500|$|... "Don't Say You Love Me" [...] was {{released}} in October 1999 as the lead song from the [...] soundtrack. There was a minor lyric change between the versions, as the original version contained the lyrics [...] "then you start kissing me", which was deemed inappropriate for Pokémon's young viewers and was changed to [...] "then <b>you</b> <b>said</b> you love me". The original version was retained on Shades of Purple. Promoted by a [...] "nonstop marketing effort", advanced airing on Radio Disney and the affiliation with Pokémon, the single was successful. It charted at No. 2 in Norway, No. 4 in both Australia and New Zealand, No. 16 in the UK and No. 21 on the Billboard Hot 100. It was certified gold in both Australia and the US, and was nominated for the year's best song at the 2000 Spellemannprisen awards.|$|E
500|$|Cagney's {{next film}} was Mister Roberts, {{directed}} by John Ford and slated to star Spencer Tracy. [...] Tracy's involvement ensured that Cagney accepted a supporting role, {{although in the}} end, Tracy did not take part. Cagney had worked with Ford before on What Price Glory?, and they had gotten along fairly well. However, as soon as Ford met Cagney at the airport, the director warned him that they would [...] "tangle asses", which caught Cagney by surprise. He later said, [...] "I would have kicked his brains out. He was so goddamned mean to everybody. He was truly a nasty old man." [...] The next day, Cagney was slightly late on set, incensing Ford. Cagney cut short his imminent tirade, saying [...] "When I started this picture, <b>you</b> <b>said</b> that we would tangle asses before this was over. I'm ready now – are you?" [...] Ford walked away, {{and they had no}} more problems, though Cagney never particularly liked Ford.|$|E
