40|$|Good morning. Before I begin I {{would like}} to thank Kevin O'Kula the Assistant Program Co-Chairman for {{inviting}} me to participate in this panel discussion, and the Nuclear Installation Safety Division of the American Nuclear Society for sponsoring this topical series on Hydrogen. For those of you that are not familiar with the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board, let me begin with a few words on the origin and mission of the Board. As some of <b>you</b> may <b>know-</b> the Department of Energy and all its predecessors- going back to the Atomic Energy Comer ssion have been self regulating agencies. In 1975 Congress separated commercial nuclear activities from the federal activities and placed commercial activities under the regulatory authority of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). Government nuclear energy and weapons activities remain to this day under the regulatory authority of the Secretary of Energy- ecept in those cases where Congress has specifically placed federal government nuclear activities under the regulatory authority of the NRC. However, in 1988 Congress responded to growing public concern about th...|$|R

40|$|Trivia is any {{fact about}} an entity, which is {{interesting}} due {{to any of}} the following characteristics - unusualness, uniqueness, unexpectedness or weirdness. Such interesting facts are provided in 'Did You Know?' section at many places. Although trivia are facts of little importance to be known, but we have presented their usage in user engagement purpose. Such fun facts generally spark intrigue and draws user to engage more with the entity, thereby promoting repeated engagement. The thesis has cited some case studies, which show the significant impact of using trivia for increasing user engagement or for wide publicity of the product/service. In this thesis, we propose a novel approach for mining entity trivia from their Wikipedia pages. Given an entity, our system extracts relevant sentences from its Wikipedia page and produces a list of sentences ranked based on their interestingness as trivia. At the heart of our system lies an interestingness ranker which learns the notion of interestingness, through a rich set of domain-independent linguistic and entity based features. Our ranking model is trained by leveraging existing user-generated trivia data available on the Web instead of creating new labeled data for movie domain. For other domains like sports, celebrities, countries etc. labeled data would have to be created as described in thesis. We evaluated our system on movies domain and celebrity domain, and observed that the system performs significantly better than the defined baselines. A thorough qualitative analysis of the results revealed that our engineered rich set of features indeed help in surfacing interesting trivia in the top ranks.

40|$|I {{would like}} to give special thanks to my advisor, Professor Kevin Hoover who took my {{shortcomings}} and successes with equal stride, and who struggled through the process alongside me. But how will you look for something when you don’t in the least know what it is? How on earth are you going to set up something you don’t know as the object of your search? To put it another way, even if you come right up against it, how will you know that what you have found is the thing <b>you</b> didn’t <b>know?-</b> Plato’s Meno (80 D) 3 This thesis aims to show that explicit understanding of possible causal structures often aids in inferring the true causes from data. This is done by first understanding that causes are chains of counterfactual dependence. Insofar as experiments, active or natural are not perfect, data can easily support false counterfactuals. Even those tools especially designed to identify unbiased estimates, like instrumental variables, often fail. Causal structure explains the failure of these tools, but more importantly allows us to better identify which counterfactuals to reject or accept...|$|R
