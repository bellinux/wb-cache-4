[...] Lee Dorian of Napalm Death indicated that [...] "Unfortunately, I think the same thing happened to grindcore, if you want to call it that, as happened to punk rock - all the great original bands were just plagiarised by a billion other bands who just copied their style identically, making it no longer original and no longer extreme." ...|$|E

2500|$|Three Kings Festival - January [...] This {{religious}} and cultural event began in 1884. It celebrates the visit of the Three Kings (Three Wisemen) to baby Jesus. Every year on January 6 {{people of all ages}} come to town to celebrate Three Kings Day. The main event is a parade down Comercio Street to the town's plaza where a big altar is set up for the celebration of the Holy Eucharist. The Eucharist begins with an act of the Prophets announcing the coming of a messiah. The prophesies are followed by the sighting of three kings by the shepherds. The holy mass follows and at the end the Three Kings find and adore baby Jesus. This is a must see activity if you are visiting Puerto Rico in January, and is an activity for all ages. If <b>you</b> <b>can,</b> <b>come</b> dressed as shepherds and be part of the celebration.|$|E
2500|$|The Deer Hunter was Cimino's {{first film}} to use Dolby noise-reduction system. [...] "What Dolby does," [...] replied Cimino, [...] "is {{to give you}} the ability to create a density of detail of sound—a {{richness}} so you can demolish the wall separating the viewer from the film. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>come</b> close to demolishing the screen." [...] It took five months to mix the soundtrack. One short battle sequence—200 feet of film in the final cut—took five days to dub. Another sequence recreated the 1975 American evacuation of Saigon; Cimino brought the film's composer, Stanley Myers, out to the location to listen to the auto, tank, and jeep horns as the sequence was being photographed. The result, according to Cimino: Myers composed the music for that scene in the same key as the horn sounds, so the music and the sound effects would blend with the images to create one jarring, desolate experience.|$|E

I don't always answer your letter soon, but it is because I can not write. As soon as I get so that I can write myself, I will write as often as I can. Tell Brave Bull that Dora (Her Pipe) has been a little sick, but is most well now. Tell if my grandfather is well. If he gets sick tell me. You wrote to my cousin Robert and told him that you had a house to live in, and lots of pigs and cows and such things, and I was very glad.

2500|$|Chesterton's {{fence is}} the {{principle}} that reforms should not be made until the reasoning behind the existing state of affairs is understood. The quotation is from Chesterton’s 1929 book The Thing: Why I am a Catholic, in the chapter, [...] "The Drift from Domesticity": [...] "In the matter of reforming things, as distinct from deforming them, there is one plain and simple principle; a principle which will probably be called a paradox. There exists {{in such a case}} a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, “I don’t see the use of this; let us clear it away." [...] To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: [...] "If you don’t see the use of it, I certainly won’t let you clear it away. Go away and think.

Liu Bei evacuated Xinye County and headed south with his followers towards Xiakou (夏口; in present-day Wuhan, Hubei), which {{was controlled by}} Liu Biao's elder son, Liu Qi. Cao Cao sent 5,000 riders to pursue Liu Bei, and they {{caught up with him}} at Changban (長阪), Dangyang (當陽). Liu Bei abandoned his family and fled, with only Zhuge Liang, Zhang Fei, Zhao Yun and a small number of soldiers accompanying him. Zhang Fei led 20 horsemen to cover Liu Bei's retreat.

[...] Cao Cao's soldiers were all afraid and did not dare to approach him. Liu Bei and his followers were hence able to retreat safely.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first part}} {{consists}} {{of determining the}} variable d, {{the number of days}} (counting from March 22) for the closest following full moon to occur. The formula for d contains the terms 19a and the constant M. a is the year's position in the 19-year lunar phase cycle, in which by assumption the moon's movement relative to earth repeats every 19 calendar years. In older times, 19 calendar years were equated to 235 lunar months (the Metonic cycle), which is remarkably close since 235 lunar months are approximately 6939.6813 days and 19 years are on average 6939.6075 days. The expression (19a + M) mod 30 repeats every 19 years within each century as M is determined per century. The 19-year cycle {{has nothing to do with}} the '19' in 19a, it is just a coincidence that another '19' appears. The '19' in 19a comes from correcting the mismatch between a calendar year and an integer number of lunar months. A calendar year (non-leap year) has 365 days and the closest <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>come</b> with an integer number of lunar months is [...] days. The difference is 11 days, which must be corrected for by moving the following year's occurrence of a full moon 11 days back. But in modulo 30 arithmetic, subtracting 11 is the same as adding 19, hence the addition of 19 for each year added, i.e. 19a.|$|E
