6000|$|... "Mr. Blake," [...] he said, [...] "if {{you read}} those notes now, {{by the light}} which my {{questions}} and <b>your</b> <b>answers</b> have thrown on them, you will make two astounding discoveries concerning yourself.

6000|$|In {{the review}} of my {{translation}} of Schiller's [...] "Wallenstein" [...] ("Rev". for October), I am numbered among the partisans of the German theatre.
