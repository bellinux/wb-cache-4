2500|$|During {{the hour}} {{preceding}} the attack, 13 people including the shooter {{participated in the}} Bible study. [...] According to the accounts of people who talked to survivors, when the shooter walked into the historic African-American church, he immediately asked for Pinckney and {{sat down next to}} him, initially listening to others during the study. He started to disagree when they began discussing Scripture. Eventually, after waiting for the other participants to begin praying, he stood up and pulled a gun from a fanny pack, aiming it at 87-year-old Susie Jackson. Jackson's nephew, 26-year-old Tywanza Sanders, tried to talk him down and asked him why he was attacking churchgoers. The shooter responded, [...] "I have to do it. You rape our women and you're taking over our country. And you have to go." [...] When he expressed his intention to shoot everyone, Sanders dove in front of Jackson and was shot first. The suspect then shot the other victims, all the while shouting racial epithets. He also reportedly said, [...] "Y'all want something to pray about? I'll give <b>you</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> pray about." [...] He reloaded his gun five times. Sanders' mother and his five-year-old niece, both attending the study, survived the shooting by pretending to be dead.|$|E
2500|$|The {{album was}} criticised in {{comparison}} to Cheryl's work with Girls Aloud. Digital Spy said the album was [...] "not a bad record, but {{nor is it a}} modern pop classic to rival the best Girls Aloud albums [...] it's a collection of cool, contemporary pop-R tunes that takes a few plays to reveal its charms." [...] The Daily Telegraph described the album as a [...] "selection of sexy but underwhelming R'n'B pop", noting that there was [...] "not a hint of the bubbly personality that has won over X Factor viewers" [...] or [...] "the electro-guitar fusion that put Girls Aloud on top". Financial Times also called it a [...] "dismayingly boring solo album, [...] swapping Girls Aloud's sparkly pop for thin R songs with dreary beats and characterless singing." [...] Pete Paphides of The Times agreed that Cheryl's personality is [...] "absent from mid-paced fillers" [...] and exclaimed that [...] "even when 3 Words gives <b>you</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> admire, the emotional temperature rarely nudges above frosty." [...] The Independent further stated the album was [...] "utterly bereft of imagination and risk, with tried and tested R producers [...] doing what they do as dispassionately as possible." [...] Pierre Oitmann of Dutch news site Nu.nl pointed out [...] "the album is mostly being characterised by strong A management; i.e. thoroughly sought together songs and consistent production values", before concluding [...] "Cheryl's role is reduced almost entirely to 'hot chick' on the cover." ...|$|E
