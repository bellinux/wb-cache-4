500|$|The {{title track}} is a soca-pop song, and blends horns and {{background}} vocals with ukulele folk-pop and island percussion {{morphed into a}} programmed beat. It contains handclaps and subtle modern sound effects. Trainor uses an assertive throwback aural tone on the song. The rap verse in [...] "Title" [...] was compared to the works of Australian rapper Iggy Azalea and American duo Karmin. The song's lyrics see Trainor demanding her lover to put a name on their relationship status. It was described by the singer as [...] "call me <b>your</b> <b>girlfriend,</b> I'm sick of being your boo thing, so call me <b>your</b> <b>girlfriend</b> and give me that title". Musically, Trainor felt the song showcased what her artistic style was about, and said, [...] "I loved that 'Title' showed a little Caribbean drum before the chorus and then, like, a rap bridge that was, like… totally different sound." [...] Christina Garibaldi of MTV News wrote that the song serves a lesson for women not {{to settle for a}} friends-with-benefits relationship.|$|E
500|$|Filming for Crossroads {{initiated}} in March 2001 in Baton Rouge and Hammond, Louisiana, near Spears' hometown. Due {{to the fact}} that Spears was also recording her third studio album along with the film's production, filming only wrapped up after six months. Additional scenes were filmed in Los Angeles, California. Crossroads had a total budget of $10 million; a relatively low budget by industry standards. According to the Louisiana Film and Video Commission, the film was originally titled What Friends are For. Spears described it as a teen movie that deals with real issues that normal teenagers live on a daily basis. She continued to explain the film's content, saying that it [...] "is about this journey that the three of us best friends take, finding ourselves and what we want out of life and getting our friendship back. Friends are all you have {{at the end of the}} day. When your boyfriend breaks up with you, who do you call? <b>Your</b> <b>girlfriend.</b> I just love that message." ...|$|E

Alan McKee, a university film and television professor, said that usually subscription television channels take risks in portraying storylines like Chris's. He added [...] "Commercial TV is not about risk taking, it is about entertainment for the broadest possible audience. But attitudes have changed and commercial networks like to reflect that". Holy Soap said Chris's most memorable moment was [...] "Announcing to his entire class that he was gay." [...] Anthony D. Langford from website, AfterElton said he found it [...] "humorous" [...] that Neighbours emphasizes what a gentleman Chris is compared to Andrew. He said [...] "It's like they're almost saying if you're a nice guy who's not all over <b>your</b> <b>girlfriend</b> you must be gay. But on television that's usually the case".

500|$|Several {{more members}} {{passed through the}} group, {{including}} drummer Mike Pareskuwicz of Subsist and guitarist T.J. [...] "Racine" [...] Kunasch. While Stump at this point felt uninterested in the group, Wentz was, according to Uprising Records owner Sean Muttaqi, viewing the group as [...] "the thing {{that would make him}} famous. He had a clear vision." [...] Wentz was [...] "singularly focused on taking things to the next level," [...] and threw the band into promotion via early social media. Muttaqi got word of the demo and wanted to release half of it as a split extended play with Hurley's band Project Rocket, which the band viewed as competition. Uprising desired to release an album with the emerging band, which to that point had only written three songs. With the help of Logan, the group attempted to put together a collection of songs in two days, and recorded them as Fall Out Boy's Evening Out with <b>Your</b> <b>Girlfriend.</b> The rushed recording experience and underdeveloped songs left the band discontent. When the band set off to Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin to record three songs for a possible split 7-inch with 504 Plan, engineer Sean O'Keefe suggested the band record the trio with Hurley. Hurley was also recording an EP with his new group the Kill Pill in Chicago the same day, but raced to Madison to lay down drums for Fall Out Boy. [...] "It was still a fill-in thing but when Andy sat in, it just felt different. It was one of those [...] "a-ha" [...] moments," [...] recalled Wentz.|$|E

500|$|The band's debut album, Take This to Your Grave, {{was issued}} by Fueled by Ramen in May 2003. Previously, {{one of the}} band's {{earliest}} recordings, Evening Out with <b>Your</b> <b>Girlfriend,</b> had not seen release until shortly before Grave in March 2003, when the band had gained considerable momentum. [...] "Our record was something being rushed out to help generate some interest, but that interest was building before we could even get the record out," [...] said Sean Muttaqi. The band actively tried to stop Uprising from releasing the recordings (as the band's relationship with Muttaqi had grown sour), as the band viewed it as a [...] "giant piece of garbage" [...] recorded before Hurley's involvement that the band members ceased to consider the debut album of the group. Gradually, the band's fanbase grew in size as the label pushed for the album's mainstream success. According to Wentz, shows began to end in a near-riot and the group were banned from several venues because the entire crowd would end up onstage. The band gained positive reviews for subsequent gigs at South by Southwest (SXSW) and various tour appearances. The band joined the Warped Tour for five dates {{in the summer of}} 2004, and on one date the band had only performed three songs when the stage collapsed due to the large crowd. The band appeared {{on the cover of the}} August 2004 edition of Alternative Press, and listening stations at Hot Topic partially helped the album move 2,000-3,000 copies per week by Christmas 2004, at which point the label considered the band [...] "tipping" [...] into mainstream success.|$|E
500|$|Swift became {{inspired}} to write [...] "You Belong with Me" [...] after she overheard a male {{friend of hers}} speaking to his girlfriend through a phone call. He acted defensive as his girlfriend yelled at him, and said to her, [...] "No, baby...I had {{to get off the}} phone really quickly... I tried to call you right back... Of course I love you. More than anything! Baby, I’m so sorry." [...] Out of the sympathy she felt towards him in the situation, Swift developed a concept for a song. In a writing session with co-writer Liz Rose, Swift explained the situation along with her idea and conceived the song's opening line, [...] "You’re on the phone with <b>your</b> <b>girlfriend</b> / she’s upset / she's going off about something that you said." [...] Together, they developed a story line, which described Swift being in love with the male friend and her having the desire for him to break up with his current girlfriend for her. Swift described the song's concept as [...] "basically about wanting someone who is with this girl who doesn't appreciate him at all. Basically like 'girl-next-door-itis.' You like this guy who you have known for your whole life, and you know him better than she does but somehow the popular girl gets the guy every time." [...] Swift recalled, [...] "It was really fun for us to write the line, 'She wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts'." [...] "You Belong with Me" [...] was first released as a promotional single from Fearless on November 4, 2008, as part of Countdown to Fearless, an exclusive campaign by the iTunes Store; the song was then released as the third single from Fearless on April 18, 2009.|$|E
500|$|Madonna herself {{would later}} say: [...] "I wouldn't say I regret it. I've made {{mistakes}} and learned from them. Most {{people want to}} hear me say that I regret publishing my Sex book. I don't. What was the problem was releasing my Erotica album at the same time. I love that album and it got overlooked." [...] However, author Andy Koopmans in his book Madonna (2002) would comment that the singer regretted both publishing Sex and recording Erotica and that the book [...] "had affected everything she did later". It was not until 2003 that Madonna would once again declare that she regretted nothing; [...] "I'm not apologizing in any shape or form [...] I was interested in pushing buttons and being rebellious and being mischievous and trying to bend the rules. There was a lot of irony in the Sex book and I am poking fun at a lot of things and I am being kind of silly and adolescent and I am being very f you, if a man can do it, I can do it." [...] A year earlier on 2002, Naomi Campbell confessed to [...] "have {{a lot of respect for}} Madonna being bold enough to come out and do a book on sex. I've never reneged on that". However, in 2009, rapper Vanilla Ice, who was Madonna's boyfriend at the time of the book's creation, confessed to not being happy with the book once he saw it. [...] "My friends were like, 'Dude, that's cool man', but I was like, 'I'm dating her, it's not cool to see <b>your</b> <b>girlfriend</b> with all these other people' [...] It kinda ruined the whole thing. I wonder what her kids think of that book? Here she is writing kids' books now but they're going to see it and go, 'Mommy, what were you thinking?'" [...] Another of the book's models, actress Isabella Rossellini, told Out magazine that she regretted her participation on the book; [...] "I don't think the book worked, even though the photos were extraordinary, and some of them quite memorable. I think there was a little bit of a moralistic sort of 'I'll teach you how to be free!' – and that bothered the hell out of me." ...|$|E

[...] Entertainment Weekly also included the song in their [...] "Songs for the Lovers (and Haters)" [...] playlist article, remarking, [...] "(Clarkson's) soaring synth-pop ballad defines what love's all about: knowing <b>your</b> <b>girlfriend's</b> a little bit crazy, and still not running away." ...|$|R

The chorus of the song is based on Sir Mix A Lot's song [...] "Swass" [...] (1988). Maeve McDermott distinguished [...] "Don't Cha" [...] from other girl group songs like [...] "Wannabe", [...] "Independent Women" [...] and [...] "No Scrubs" [...] which promote female camaraderie.

[...] The song's is based from the chorus of [...] "Swass" [...] performed by Sir Mix-a-Lot. [...] "Beep" [...] features will.i.am of The Black Eyed Peas and is built on an orchestral sample from Electric Light Orchestra's [...] "Evil Woman".

[...] "Stickwitu is soul ballad that celebrate's relationship that lasts. Scherzinger voice reaches at the thin end of her alto-into-soprano register.

5000|$|A {{positive}} review {{came from}} Matt Collar of Allmusic, {{who gave the}} album a rating of {{three and a half}} out of five stars.

[...] and praised [...] "I'm Your Daddy" [...] and [...] "The Girl Got Hot" [...] for being [...] "as sparkling with creative enthusiasm as anything the band has done since [...] "Buddy Holly." [...] A 4/5 rating came from Kerrang. [...] "Songs about going to meet <b>your</b> <b>girlfriend's</b> parents or how the ugly duckling in junior high school suddenly turned into a double-take ice queen, are an odd thing for men pushing 40 to sing about.

He viewed the payments as a normal business practice: If <b>your</b> <b>girlfriend</b> goes to buy stockings at a supermarket, the racks that display those stockings are usually paid for by the company that manufactured the stockings.

2500|$|Allowed {{to create}} the [...] "zoo" [...] format he had {{previously}} been disallowed from performing on Radio 1, Evans was given a free rein by his friend, Radio 1 controller Matthew Bannister. Critics hated innuendo-laden features like Honk Your Horn and In Bed with <b>Your</b> <b>Girlfriend,</b> but Evans put on 600,000 new listeners over Steve Wright – one for every £5 spent on salary and advertising. The effect also flowed through into the listening figures for later programmes. The audience grew as the breakfast format became more outrageous: humiliating assistant Holly Samos by repeatedly asking her about her sex life (Evans and Samos were reportedly in a relationship at periods through their time working together), and encouraging two female guests to perform a strip show on live radio.
