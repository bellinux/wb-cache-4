60|$|I {{will now}} apply what I {{have said to}} you, my brethren and fellow-citizens. Count upon it, as a truth next to your creed, that no one person in office, {{of which he is}} not master for life, whether born here or in England, will ever hazard that office for the good of this country. One of <b>your</b> <b>candidates</b> is of this kind, and I believe him to be an honest gentleman, as the word honest is {{generally}} understood. But he loves his employment better than he doth you, or his country, or all the countries upon earth.

'He has extensive house property {{in the city and}} three places of business and isn't it to his own advantage to keep down the rates? He's a prominent and respected citizen,' said I, 'and a Poor Law Guardian, and he doesn't belong to any party, good, bad, or indifferent.' That's the way to talk to 'em." ...|$|E
60|$|One word more, and I {{shall have}} done with this branch of the subject. You Democrats, and <b>your</b> <b>candidate,</b> in the main {{are in favor of}} laying down in advance a platform--a set of party positions--as a unit, and then of forcing the people, by every sort of appliance, to ratify them, however {{unpalatable}} some of them may be. We and our candidate are in favor of making Presidential elections and the legislation of the country distinct matters; so that the people can elect whom they please, and afterward legislate just as they please, without any hindrance, save only so much as may guard against infractions of the Constitution, undue haste, and want of consideration. The difference between us is clear as noonday. That we are right we cannot doubt. We hold the true Republican position. In leaving the people's business in their hands, we cannot be wrong. We are willing, and even anxious, to go to the people on this issue.|$|E
6000|$|Now {{can there}} be any {{difficulty}} in understanding this? To you Democrats it {{may not seem like}} principle; but surely you cannot fail to perceive the position plainly enough. The distinction between it and the position of <b>your</b> <b>candidate</b> is broad and obvious, and I admit you have a clear right to show it is wrong if you can; but you have no right to pretend you cannot see it at all. We see it, and to us it appears like principle, and the best sort of principle at that--the principle of allowing the people to do as they please with their own business. My friend from Indiana (C. B. Smith) has aptly asked, [...] "Are you willing to trust the people?" [...] Some of you answered substantially, [...] "We are willing to trust the people; but the President is as much the representative of the people as Congress." [...] In a certain sense, and to a certain extent, he is the representative of the people. He is elected by them, as well as Congress is; but can he, in the nature of things know the wants of the people as well as three hundred other men, coming from all the various localities of the nation? If so, where is the propriety of having a Congress? That the Constitution gives the President a negative on legislation, all know; but that this negative should be so combined with platforms and other appliances as to enable him, and in fact almost compel him, to take the whole of legislation into his own hands, is what we object to, is what General Taylor objects to, and is what constitutes the broad distinction between you and us. To thus transfer legislation is clearly to take it from those who understand with minuteness the interests of the people, and give it to one who does not and cannot so well understand it. I understand your idea that if a Presidential candidate avow his opinion upon a given question, or rather upon all questions, and the people, with full knowledge of this, elect him, they thereby distinctly approve all those opinions. By means of it, measures are adopted or rejected contrary to the wishes of the whole of one party, and often nearly half of the other. Three, four, or half a dozen questions are prominent at a given time; the party selects its candidate, and he takes his position on each of these questions. On all but one his positions have already been indorsed at former elections, and his party fully committed to them; but that one is new, and a large portion of them are against it. But what are they to do? The whole was strung together; and they must take all, or reject all. They cannot take what they like, and leave the rest. What they are already committed to being the majority, they shut their eyes, and gulp the whole. Next election, still another is introduced in the same way. If we run our eyes along the line of the past, we shall see that almost if not quite all the articles of the present Democratic creed have been at first forced upon the party in this very way. And just now, and just so, opposition to internal improvements is to be established if General Cass shall be elected. Almost half the Democrats here are for improvements; but they will vote for Cass, and if he succeeds, their vote will have aided in closing the doors against improvements. Now this is a process which we think is wrong. We prefer a candidate who, like General Taylor, will allow the people to have their own way, regardless of his private opinions; and I should think the internal-improvement Democrats, at least, ought to prefer such a candidate. He would force nothing on them which they don't want, and he would allow them to have improvements which their own candidate, if elected, will not.|$|E
40|$|Requesting sample SAS ® code {{from job}} {{candidates}} before an interview {{is a good}} way to gauge their level of experience, ability, and style. Once you have reviewed the code, prepare your questions for the candidate.

This paper will provide you with some guidelines on how to get answers to these questions in an interview. Code samples that I have received over the last few years and the questions that arose will be used as examples. This is also a good time to ask if the candidate can think of another way to accomplish the same task using a different approach.

5000|$|Political {{strategies}} for campaigns often include coaching on preventive measures to avoid providing {{too much information}} in public disclosure procedures that can provide ammunition for opponents' opposition researchers, particularly in itemized expenditure reports.

One bonus financial filing tip: warn <b>your</b> <b>candidate</b> about spending campaign funds on fancy restaurants for 'strategy meetings.'

6000|$|Mr. Speaker, I see I {{have but}} three minutes left, and this forces me {{to throw out}} one whole branch of my subject. A single word on still another. The Democrats are keen enough to {{frequently}} remind us that we have some dissensions in our ranks. Our good friend from Baltimore immediately before me [Mr. McLane] expressed some doubt the other day as to which branch of our party General Taylor would ultimately {{fall into the hands}} of. That was a new idea to me. I knew we had dissenters, but I did not know {{they were trying to get}} our candidate away from us. I would like to say a word to our dissenters, but I have not the time. Some such we certainly have; have you none, gentlemen Democrats? Is it all union and harmony in your ranks? no bickerings? no divisions? If there be doubt as to which of our divisions will get our candidate, is there no doubt as to which of <b>your</b> <b>candidates</b> will get <b>your</b> party? I have heard some things from New York; and if they are true, one might well say of your party there, as a drunken fellow once said when he heard the reading of an indictment for hog-stealing. The clerk read on till he got to and through the words, [...] "did steal, take, and carry away ten boars, ten sows, ten shoats, and ten pigs," [...] at which he exclaimed, [...] "Well, by golly, that is the most equally divided gang of hogs I ever did hear of!"
