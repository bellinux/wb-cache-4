5|$|The Buccaneers, {{making their}} NFL debut against the Houston Oilers, {{averaged}} {{less than two}} yards per offensive play. They were unable to score despite being given good field position by two Oiler fumbles. Steve Spurrier completed 8 of 21 passes for 36 yards, and starting running backs Jimmy DuBose and Louis Carter rushed for 12 yards on 15 carries. Despite being outgained 169 to 8 by the second quarter, they were only behind 7–0 and missed a chance to tie the score when Lee McGriff dropped a Spurrier pass in the end zone. A later drive ended when Spurrier overthrew John McKay, Jr., instead hitting defender C.L. Whittington. A third chance to tie the score was lost when Mark Cotney dropped an interception of a Dan Pastorini pass with a clear path to the end zone. Whittington gave the Buccaneers {{the ball on the}} Oiler 11-yard line by fumbling a punt, but then killed the Buccaneers’ scoring chances by intercepting another Spurrier pass. Ronnie Coleman ran 25 times for 142 yards for the Oilers. McKay expressed concern over the team’s offense after the defeat, and responded to a reporter’s taunt of “I thought you said <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> win some games?” by saying, “Houston has been in the league 6,000 years and still hasn’t won a championship. The Bucs will be heard from”. It was a day with a bad beginning, middle, and ending for the Buccaneers. The day began with the Buccaneers getting lost in the maze-like Astrodome interior, and ended with the team’s charter plane bouncing and rolling before righting itself on landing. In addition, starting tackle Dave Reavis was injured during pregame warmups and was lost for the season.|$|E

They spear-fished with spears made of shafts to which hazel tines were attached. Boats were dugouts a few feet wide propelled by paddles constructed of shafts to which leaf-shaped or heart-shaped blades were attached.

25|$|The plot is {{centered}} on a bachelor man called Asker, who wants to see and choose his bride before marriage. His wife quest, however, is difficult because in that time (in the 19th century) based on traditions women were kept at home and when allowed out they were heavily covered in hijab and because actually you {{were not allowed to}} know who <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> get married with in the 19th century. Asker's friend Suleyman suggests him disguising as a fabric peddler, a sure way to meet women. Asker agrees and starts to go round the houses selling fabrics.|$|E
25|$|The {{time machine}} went through several {{variations}} during {{production of the}} first film, Back to the Future. In {{the first draft of}} the screenplay, the time machine was a laser device that was housed in a room. At {{the end of the first}} draft the device was attached to a refrigerator and taken to an atomic bomb test site. Director Robert Zemeckis said in an interview that the idea was scrapped because he did not want children to start climbing into refrigerators and getting trapped inside. In the third draft of the film the time machine was a car, as Zemeckis reasoned that if <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> make a time machine, you would want it to be mobile. The specific choice of vehicle was a DeLorean DMC-12 for the purposes of it looking like an alien spaceship due to its characteristic gullwing doors (which were inspired by the Mercedes-Benz 300 SL). However, in order to send Marty back to the future, the vehicle had to drive into a nuclear test site. Ultimately this concept was considered too expensive to film, so the power source was changed to lightning.|$|E
500|$|Before he was sentenced, Logan {{apologized to}} the {{relatives}} and comrades of his victims, and asked Shepherd to show mercy in his sentencing him. Shepherd rebuked Logan's pleas for mercy, citing the heinous nature of the crime, which he remarked as being the most callous one that he had ever encountered {{as a member of}} the judiciary. Shepherd stated, [...] "I've never experienced a case of a murder more cold-blooded than those that occurred in this case" [...] and [...] "You decided <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> annihilate those two people".|$|E

[...] He then apologizes, saying, [...] "Sorry if I get a little Homeric at times. That's genetic, too." [...] This is an allusion to the poet Homer, who was also captivated with the nature versus nurture debate. In fact, Cal himself confesses, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> devise an experiment to measure the relative influences of nature versus nurture, you couldn't come up with anything better than my life." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1998, Kilborn left The Daily Show {{to replace}} Tom Snyder on CBS's The Late Late Show. He claimed the [...] "Five Questions" [...] {{interview}} segment as intellectual property, disallowing any future Daily Show hosts from {{using it in}} their interviews. Correspondents Brian Unger and A. Whitney Brown left the show shortly before him, {{but the majority of}} the show's crew and writing staff stayed on. Kilborn's last show as host aired on December 17, 1998, ending a 386 episode tenure. Reruns were shown until Jon Stewart's debut four weeks later. Kilborn made a short appearance on Jon Stewart's final edition of the Daily Show saying [...] "I knew <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> run this thing into the ground." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Jigsaw {{did not come}} until months later, when Whannell was working at a job he was unhappy with and began having migraines. Convinced it was a brain tumor, {{he went to a}} neurologist to have an MRI and while sitting nervously in the waiting room he thought, [...] "What if you were given the news that you had a tumor and <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> die soon? How would you react to that?" [...] He imagined the character Jigsaw having been given one or two years to live and combined that with the idea of Jigsaw putting others in a literal version of the situation, but only giving them a few minutes to choose their fate.|$|E
5000|$|The main {{character}} team are The Mates. While there are parallels with The Beatles and each {{character is a}} pastiche of a superhero, Tischman insisted the concept was much broader than that: [...] "The persona of the Mates is an iconic one for both superhero teams and rock bands. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> always <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have the really cute one. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have the quiet one. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have the spiritual one and <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have the goofy one.

500|$|One notable {{advocate}} for the fledgling movement was Mark Twain. Manipulative treatments had purportedly alleviated the symptoms of his daughter Jean's epilepsy as well as Twain's own chronic bronchitis. In 1909, he spoke before the New York State Assembly at a hearing regarding the practice of osteopathy in the state. [...] "I don't know as I cared much about these osteopaths until I heard <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> drive {{them out of the}} state, but since I heard that I haven't been able to sleep." [...] Philosophically opposed to the American Medical Association's stance that its own type of medical practice was the only legitimate one, he spoke in favor of licensing for osteopaths. Physicians from the New York County Medical Society responded with a vigorous attack on Twain, who retorted with [...] "he physicians think they are moved by regard for {{the best interests of the}} public. Isn't there a little touch of self-interest back of it all?" [...] "...The objection is, people are curing people without a license and you are afraid it will bust up business." ...|$|E
500|$|For the CGI used {{throughout}} the film, companies Rhythm & Hues (R) and Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) developed {{different parts of the}} film. R focused on the animation of the animals, while ILM completed the final scene of the ark rushing through Washington D.C. Lindy De Quattro, the ILM associate visual effects supervisor, revealed that [...] "This is the first time where we had to do a whole series of shots that were happening mid-day, where <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> get a really long look at the water and what it was doing." [...] The company initially experienced problems creating the water effects and had to develop new tools which would choreograph the movements of the water. In addition, ILM used similar tools that were used on their prior film Poseidon. Lighting was also an issue as the characters on the ark had been filmed on a greenscreen stage, and the visual effects company had to ensure that the lighting matched that of the characters and the outside setting. Details were added to the ark for long-distance shots to make the design of the ark more appealing and relate the ark's size to scale in comparison to the amount of water. To complete the scene, ILM used thirty to sixty crew members and produced 200 shots over a yearlong period between April 2006 and May 2007.|$|E
500|$|The short parodies Superman, with John Williams' {{theme from}} the 1978 film playing as Wilson {{changes in the}} booth. It was noted that Leitch's [...] "icy blue" [...] {{cinematography}} differed from the style that director Tim Miller used for the first Deadpool, on which Wernick said [...] "every director brings their take to the material" [...] and they were embracing and writing to his style. The writers wanted {{the opening of the}} short to feel like the opening of Logan, [...] "so if <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> see Logan and the first shot came up, you would think it's gonna be Hugh [...] in the hoodie, and then when {{it turns out to be}} Deadpool you realize what's going on." [...] They described the short as an absurd one-off [...] "that's probably something that doesn't fit into a movie. It wouldn't work in the logic of a movie, but Deadpool affords us the opportunity to break rules ... the tone can be more absurd if we feel like it's funny. That was our goal there." [...] The short makes several references to Logan: it is set in front of a theater that is showing the film; a poster for the film is seen in the alley; and Deadpool does an impersonation of Jackman's natural Australian accent. At the end of the short, an apparent book report summarizing Ernest Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea and seemingly written by Deadpool is quickly shown in a text crawl. This was interpreted to be an allusion to Logan and that film's focus on older characters.|$|E
