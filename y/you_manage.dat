Whereas, if he is telling me the same thing... I will not waste time asking him questions because I am also creatively aware why he needs them." ...|$|E
500|$|Drake {{ended his}} studies at Cambridge nine months before graduation, and in autumn 1969 moved to London. His father remembered [...] "writing him long letters, {{pointing}} out the disadvantages of going away from Cambridge... a degree was a safety net, if <b>you</b> <b>manage</b> to get a degree, at least {{you have something to}} fall back on; his reply to that was that a safety net was the one thing he did not want." [...] Drake spent his first few months in the capital drifting from place to place, occasionally staying at his sister's Kensington flat, but usually sleeping on friends’ sofas and floors. Eventually, in an attempt to bring some stability and a telephone into Drake's life, Boyd organised and paid for a ground floor bedsit in Belsize Park, Camden.|$|E
500|$|In December 1997, Southall went to Alvin Martin's Southend United of the Second Division on loan. He made 9 {{appearances}} {{in a brief}} stay at Roots Hall. He joined Chris Kamara's First Division Stoke City in February 1998. Kamara resigned two months later, and caretaker-manager Alan Durban pulled Southall aside {{on his first day}} in charge to say [...] "I'll let <b>you</b> <b>manage</b> the reserves, so long as you keep your head down, do whatever I tell you, and I won't tell everybody you're a bad influence". Southall was shocked by Durban's words and could not explain his attitude. Both Southend and Stoke would end the season bottom of their respective divisions and Everton only avoided relegation {{on the last day of}} the season. He left the Britannia Stadium in the summer, and later said [...] "one of the worst episodes of my life had drawn to a close".|$|E

500|$|Whether Barre was {{a native}} of England or of Normandy is unknown, but his surname appears to derive from the Norman village of La Barre, near Bernay, in the present-day {{department}} of Eure. He was likely born around 1130 and was related to Normandy's Sifrewast family, knights in Berkshire. Barre had a relative, Hugh Barre, who was Archdeacon of Leicester in the 1150s. [...] Barre studied law at Bologna in Italy before 1150 and was a student there with Stephen of Tournai, who became Bishop of Tournai in 1192. Another fellow student wrote a short verse addressed to Barre: [...] "Pontificum causas regumque negocia tractes, Qui tibi divicias deliciasque parant", which translates to [...] "May <b>you</b> <b>manage</b> the causes of bishops and the affairs of kings, Who provide riches and delights for you." [...] After finishing his schooling, Barre seems to have worked for either Robert de Chesney, the Bishop of Lincoln, or Nicholas, Archdeacon of Huntingdon; the main evidence for this is that Barre witnessed charters for both men from 1160 to 1164. By 1165, Barre had joined the household of King Henry II of England.|$|E
2500|$|King's biographer {{speculated that}} his dislike for Horne stemmed from Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox's attempt to relieve King {{of one of}} his COMINCH-CNO titles. At the First Quebec Conference in August 1943, Knox {{surprised}} King with the suggestion that King relinquish his CNO title to Horne. Upon returning to Washington, King confronted Horne. [...] "Where in hell did this idea come from?" [...] King demanded. [...] "How did <b>you</b> <b>manage</b> it?" [...] Horne pleaded innocence, claiming that he had {{had nothing to do with}} it, and that when asked about it, he had told Knox that the existing setup was fine. King did not believe him.|$|E
2500|$|Anime News Network {{contributor}} Jacob Hope Chapman {{was critical}} of the show's production quality in his review of episodes 1–3, stating that, [...] "Berserk 2016 is an abominably ugly and almost forcefully unpleasant realization of our dreams, with cut-rate CGI, questionable music choices, and disorienting camera work." [...] However, to him {{the strength of the}} source work helps to carry the show, and Itagaki's frenetic directing style at least keeps the action interesting: [...] "Once <b>you</b> <b>manage</b> to unclench your teeth at all those garish cel-shaded puppet bodies smacking against each other, Miura's compelling story and captivating world still shine as one-of-a-kind flights of dark imagination with poignant characterization, even as they struggle under such a lackluster production." ...|$|E

2500|$|GameTrailers also {{reviewed}} it favorably, though {{slightly less}} so, {{giving it a}} 7.6/10, citing issues with the narrative structure, difficulty and minor gameplay bugs, but applauding the multiplayer modes. Eurogamer gave 7/10, stating [...] "All the same, you can't escape the feeling that Rockstar just isn't as good at a pure third-person shooter {{as it is with}} the open worlds of Grand Theft Auto or Red Dead Redemption, and in this linear context it's much harder to put up with its usual missteps in mechanics and difficulty." [...] Edge also gave 7/10, stating [...] "Max Payne 3 might solve the problem of how <b>you</b> <b>manage</b> to reload when carrying more than one gun, but detailing alone can't change {{the fact that this is}} a surprisingly conservative game from Rockstar".|$|E
