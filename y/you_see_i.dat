25|$|Lammers: No. But you {{confirmed}} it. <b>You</b> <b>see,</b> <b>I</b> {{have been}} studying metaphysics for years, and I was able by a few questions, by the facts you gave, to check {{what is right and}} what is wrong with a whole lot of the stuff I've been reading. The important thing is that the basic system which runs through all the mystery religions, whether they come from Tibet or the pyramids of Egypt, is backed up by you. It's actually the right system.|$|E
500|$|A {{shortage}} of new {{material and the}} slow progress of the sessions contributed to Dylan's decision to cancel three additional recording dates. Six weeks later Dylan confided to critic Robert Shelton, [...] "Oh, I was really down. I mean, in ten recording sessions, man, we didn't get one song... It was the band. But <b>you</b> <b>see,</b> <b>I</b> didn't know that. I didn't want to think that".|$|E
500|$|Adams was {{appointed}} in 1785 the first American {{minister to the}} Court of St James's (ambassador to Great Britain). When a counterpart seemed to assume that Adams had some family members in England, Adams replied, [...] "Neither my father or mother, grandfather or grandmother, great grandfather or great grandmother, nor any other relation that I know of, or care a farthing for, has been in England these {{one hundred and fifty}} years; so that <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>I</b> have not one drop of blood in my veins but what is American." ...|$|E

500|$|By {{the end of}} 1898 Dresser {{reported}} that nearly one million copies of sheet music would soon be sold, making [...] "Wabash" [...] a [...] "sensation", the [...] "great hit of the day." [...] In a newspaper interview Dresser said, [...] "I can’t tell you just how much I have cleared off of the song, but the $50,000 estimate I have seen in some papers is very modest. <b>You</b> <b>see</b> <b>I</b> am a publisher {{as well as a}} composer and have a big printing house of my own in New York. I also write the words for all my songs, dictate the circumstances and stage settings for their public introductions, write my own ads, and sometimes sing my own songs. Now {{what do you think of}} that for a monopoly. Eh?" [...] Dresser earned a substantial income from the song, including royalties through the sale of sheet music.|$|E
500|$|Executive {{producers}} J.H. Wyman and Jeff Pickner {{were both}} impressed with Torv's {{take on the}} role, with Wyman stating that it [...] "just transcended all our expectations", while Pinkner noted that Nimoy himself was [...] "the most proud and most impressed" [...] with the outcome. Actor Joshua Jackson found her performance [...] "so creepy". He explained, [...] "In the episodes, <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>I</b> can barely look at her. I think it ended up being {{a good way to}} play Peter’s reaction to Olivia, but it was born out of the fact that when that voice came out of her, I was like: ‘Oh, that’s just wrong!'" [...] Pinkner confirmed in an interview with TVline that Bell's appearance would last for [...] "a couple" [...] episodes, and also warned that [...] "cohabitation is not as benign as William assumes it is", a reference to problems Bell would soon have in Olivia's body. The possessed state of Olivia has led viewers to refer to her as [...] "Bellivia".|$|E

2500|$|It {{is true that}} I {{can speak}} the exact, the idiomatic English. But, my friend, to speak the broken English is an {{enormous}} asset. It leads people to despise you. They say – a foreigner – he can't even speak English properly. [...] Also I boast! An Englishman he says often, [...] "A fellow who thinks as much of himself as that cannot be worth much." [...] And so, <b>you</b> <b>see,</b> <b>I</b> put people off their guard.|$|E
2500|$|But Melbourne was not New York. King {{found it}} “almost Victorian”. Her first {{impression}} of her adopted country was: “Rather flat, like {{a can of}} flat beer.” But, she said, “I {{made up my mind}} I will not look back. <b>You</b> <b>see,</b> <b>I</b> had emigrated once, and the first emigration is the hardest to adjust to. I think people do not realise that. ... these experiences ... fundamentally it does something to your whole system.” She was unable to make sculpture for several years. But she knew that she could not go back to Germany to live.|$|E
2500|$|In Platonic {{philosophy}} and other Greek philosophical thought, at death the soul {{was said to}} leave the inferior body behind. The idea that Jesus was resurrected spiritually rather than physically even gained popularity among some Christian teachers, whom the author of 1 John declared to be antichrists. Similar beliefs appeared {{in the early church}} as Gnosticism. However, in Luke 24:39, the resurrected Jesus expressly states [...] "behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself. [...] Handle me and see, for a spirit does not have flesh and bones as <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>I</b> have." ...|$|E

2500|$|While Lee herself downplayed autobiographical {{parallels}} in the book, Truman Capote, {{mentioning the}} character Boo Radley in To Kill a Mockingbird, described details he considered autobiographical: [...] "In my original version of Other Voices, Other Rooms I had that same man {{living in the}} house that used to leave things in the trees, and then I took that out. He was a real man, and he lived just down the road from us. We used to go and get those things out of the trees. Everything she wrote about it is absolutely true. But <b>you</b> <b>see,</b> <b>I</b> take the same thing and transfer it into some Gothic dream, done in an entirely different way." ...|$|E
2500|$|Parks {{initially}} {{became aware}} of the Beach Boys during their early popularity in the early 1960s. Speaking of them in 1995, he said, [...] "I knew they didn't surf.…I felt some resentment about , and I had been a fan of Four Freshmen and 5 Trombones.…Instinctively, I was not a Beach Boy fan. 'Something really dumb about it.'" [...] He added that, [...] "I loved Pet Sounds, <b>you</b> <b>see.</b> <b>I</b> came back to love them, and thought they had done a great job. It seemed to me that they would be fine in fighting spirit to take on this challenge of wresting that trophy {{out of the hands of}} those interlopers." [...] Parks has gone on to call Wilson [...] "the biggest event of that era" [...] but is hesitant to label him a [...] "genius," [...] believing Wilson to be more [...] "a lucky guy with a tremendous amount of talent and a lot of people collaborating beautifully around him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Klemperer {{hoped for}} a {{permanent}} position as lead conductor in New York or Philadelphia. But in 1936 he was passed over for both [...] first in Philadelphia, where Eugene Ormandy succeeded Leopold Stokowski at the Philadelphia Orchestra, and then in New York, where Arturo Toscanini's departure left a vacancy at the New York Philharmonic but John Barbirolli and Artur Rodziński were engaged in preference to Klemperer. The New York decision was particularly galling, as Klemperer had been engaged to conduct the first fourteen weeks of the New York Philharmonic's 1935-6 season. Klemperer's bitterness at this decision was voiced in a letter he wrote to Arthur Judson, who ran the orchestra: [...] "that the society did not reengage me is the strongest offense, the sharpest insult to me as artist, which I can imagine. <b>You</b> <b>see,</b> <b>I</b> am no youngster. I have a name and a good name. One could not use me in a most difficult season and then expell me. This non-reengagement will have very bad results not only for me in New York but in the whole world... This non-reengagement is an absolutely unjustified wrong done {{to me by the}} Philharmonic Society." ...|$|E
