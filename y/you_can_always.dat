25|$|If a {{compression}} {{scheme is}} lossless—that is, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>always</b> recover the entire original message by decompressing—then a compressed message {{has the same}} quantity of information as the original, but communicated in fewer characters. That is, it has more information, or a higher entropy, per character. This means a compressed message has less redundancy. Roughly speaking, Shannon's source coding theorem says that a lossless compression scheme cannot compress messages, on average, {{to have more than}} one bit of information per bit of message, but that any value less than one bit of information per bit of message can be attained by employing a suitable coding scheme. The entropy of a message per bit multiplied by the length of that message is a measure of how much total information the message contains.|$|E

Meyer says that the books are {{centered}} around Bella's choice to choose her life on her own, and the Cullens' choices to abstain from killing rather than follow their temptations: [...] "I really think that's the underlying metaphor of my vampires. It doesn't matter where you're stuck in life or {{what you think you}} have to do; <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>always</b> choose something else. There's always a different path." ...|$|E

His daughter Þorgerður recalls that she was once sent to a slaughterhouse to collect a specimen but arrived just as the workers were taking a lunch break: [...] "Someone asked, 'What's in the basket?' I had to say, 'I'm collecting a frozen goat penis.' After that I said, 'I will never collect for you again.'" [...] According to Sigurður, [...] "Collecting penises is like collecting anything.

I wanted him to feel at home with us, to feel wanted." [...] Washington won Boston fans over immediately. His acceptance was aided by a glowing article Bob Ryan of The Boston Globe wrote on the player after researching his life and spending some time with him. After the season, Washington took less money to re-sign with the Celtics over the Denver Nuggets.|$|E
500|$|Book III {{covers the}} mediaeval Quadrivium, the four {{subjects}} which supplemented the Trivium being mathematics, geometry, music and astronomy. He argues {{that there are}} infinitely many numbers, as <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>always</b> add one (or any other number) to whatever number {{you think is the}} limit. He attributes geometry to Ancient Egypt, arguing that because the River Nile flooded and covered the land with mud, geometry was needed to mark out people's land [...] "with lines and measures". Isidore distinguishes astronomy from astrology, and covers the world, the sky and the celestial sphere, the zodiac, the sun, moon, stars, Milky Way, planets and the names of the stars. He derives the curved (curvus) vault of the heavens from the Latin word for [...] "upside-down" [...] (conversus). He explains eclipses of the sun as the moon coming between the earth and the sun, and eclipses of the moon as happening when it runs into the shadow of the earth. He condemns the Roman naming of the planets after their gods: Jupiter, Saturn, Mars, Venus, and Mercury.|$|E
500|$|Vachss said [...] "writing is {{my way of}} preaching. For me, it's always, {{always the}} message. The plot is {{something}} I contrive to deliver the message. You've got to have enough narrative force {{to get people to}} finish the book, but if you can give them an exciting story, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>always</b> make your points." [...] He stated that [...] "the whole point of the book is to raise awareness about the kiddie-sex tourism business in Thailand". Though the story uses more realism than the escapism typically associated with superhero fiction, Vachss did end the book with endorsements of two real non-profit groups; Don't! Buy! Thai! and End Child Prostitution in Asian Tourism. The writing is not subtle, as Vachss noted [...] "If you don't get angry, you're not going to do anything". Understanding that the likely readers were young males with short attention spans, Vachss tried to be dramatic by using what author Adam Begley calls [...] "a motivational hat trick: sympathy for the victims, revenge, and a family calling".|$|E

500|$|Earlier manuscripts {{included}} more antagonistic actions by Elsa, such as intentionally cursing Arendelle with an eternal winter. Additionally, she is shown creating {{an army of}} snowmen similar to the original Snow Queen's army of snowflakes; the comedic character of Olaf {{was at the time}} written as a smaller snowman who was cast out by Elsa for being too unintimidating. Within two months, however, scripts were altered to give emphasis to her lack of control over her powers. Olaf was reduced to the only snowman created by Elsa, and he instead serves as a reminder of the sisters' childhood friendship. In the final version, Elsa creates a single giant snow creature that Olaf nicknames [...] "Marshmallow" [...] to act as a guard after being branded as a monster for her powers. According to director Jennifer Lee, the character ultimately became more of a composite of both Kai and the Snow Queen, enhancing her increasingly sympathetic portrayal. Del Vecho added, [...] "There are times when Elsa does villainous things but because you understand where it comes from, from this desire to defend herself, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>always</b> relate to her." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Michelle Grobbelaar {{from the}} CGS, [...] "There's {{a rule of}} thumb that if you {{experience}} an earthquake with a certain magnitude in the past, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>always</b> expect an earthquake of a similar magnitude in that same area." [...] Grobbelaar and Denver Birch, also from the CGS, said that the cause of the earthquake was difficult to determine given that it occurred in a mining area and the lack of historical seismic data for the area. Ian Saunders from the CGS confirmed that a team would be sent to the area for further investigation, and Eldridge Kgaswane from the CGS said {{they should be able to}} determine the cause within a month. According to Kgaswane, [...] "The fact that the deepest mine shafts are shallower than the epicentre doesn't mean mining can be ruled out as a cause. Blasting in the vicinity of a big fault could have activated seismic activity." [...] On 18 August 2014 at a Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) seminar in Pretoria, the CGS confirmed that the earthquake was caused by mining-related activity, making it the biggest ever mining-related earthquake recorded in South Africa.|$|E
500|$|Early scenes {{animated}} by Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston show that Pinocchio's design was exactly {{like that of}} a real wooden puppet with a long pointed nose, a peaked cap and bare wooden hands. Walt Disney, however, was not pleased with the work that was being done on the film. He felt that no one could really sympathize with such a character and called for an immediate halt in production. Fred Moore redesigned the character slightly to make him more appealing but the design still retained a wooden feel. Young and upcoming animator Milt Kahl felt that Thomas, Johnston and Moore were [...] "rather obsessed with the idea of this boy being a wooden puppet" [...] and felt that they should [...] "forget that he was a puppet and get a cute little boy; <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>always</b> draw the wooden joints and make him a wooden puppet afterwards". Hamilton Luske suggested to Kahl that he should demonstrate his beliefs by animating a test sequence. Kahl showed Disney a test scene in which Pinocchio is underwater looking for his father. From this scene Kahl re-envisioned the character by making him look more like a real boy, with a child's Tyrolean hat and standard cartoon character four-fingered (or three and a thumb) hands with Mickey Mouse-type gloves on them. The only parts of Pinocchio that still looked more or less like a puppet were his arms, legs and his little button wooden nose. Disney embraced Kahl's scene and immediately urged the writers to evolve Pinocchio into a more innocent, naïve, somewhat coy personality that reflected Kahl's design.|$|E

2500|$|Although a 2005 court {{settlement}} gave Nestlé {{the right to}} pump 250 gallons per minute (GPM) from a well in unincorporated Osceola Township, Osceola County, Michigan, Nestlé has tried to increase that rate to 400 GPM. Its bottled water is sold under the Ice Mountain Spring label. The local planning commission denied the application to build a booster station to increase {{the capacity of the}} pipeline that delivers water to a water truck depot some distance from the town. Local citizens mounted considerable grassroots opposition to the plan, with 55 opponents testifying against the proposal at a meeting attended by almost 500 people in July, 2017. The litigation has been costly to the small town, which receives its only compensation from a $200 annual pumping fee. Regarding the 1976 Michigan Safe Drinking Water Act, section 17, a measure precipitated by Nestlé's previous demands, Bill Cobbs, a current Democratic gubernatorial candidate said, [...] "This is wrong -- when this act was written in 1976 it was never intentioned that water would be up for sale." [...] The [...] "David vs. Goliath" [...] situation is drawing increasing national attention. Nestlé approaches water purely as a commodity. In 1994 Helmut Maucher, Nestlé's CEO commented, “Springs are like petroleum. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>always</b> build a chocolate factory. But springs you have or you don’t have.” His successor, Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, was criticized when, in a 2005 documentary, he similarly promoted and rationalized the commodification of water, saying: “One perspective held by various NGOs—which I would call extreme—is that water should be declared a human right.|$|E
