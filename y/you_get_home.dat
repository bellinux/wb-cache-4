The song's title was a saying from {{a friend of the}} band. The title for [...] "Another Song About the Weekend" [...] is a reference to Secret Lives of the Freemasons's album Weekend Warriors (2008), while the lyrics are about [...] "a sick cycle" [...] of [...] "life on the road [...] Every time you're gone, you miss home and when <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>home,</b> you miss the road". [...] "If It Means a Lot to You" [...] had been written {{over the course of a}} year, and McKinnon said he wrote it about himself.

2500|$|In 2006, Savage {{participated in}} the UK edition of The X Factor and {{advanced}} to the final 24 while attending the aforementioned music school. While participating in the popular music competition franchise, she had difficulty dealing with the limelight. Savage was quoted as saying, [...] "You have to always realize that people are watching. When I got the bad news that I wasn't getting through [...] {{it was a really}} painful time. But you still {{have to learn how to}} hold that until <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>home.</b> Because you don't want to just let everything out. People admire you and want to see that you're strong; they don't want to see you breaking down." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rene Rodriguez of the Miami Herald {{gave the}} film one star, commenting, [...] "There are enough laughs {{scattered}} throughout A Million Ways to Die in the West that while you're watching it, the movie {{seems like a}} passable comedy. By the time <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>home,</b> though, you can barely remember the jokes." [...] John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter criticized the film's running time: [...] "Though the film is hardly laugh-free, its uneven jokes appear to have breezed through a very forgiving editing process." [...] Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal too found the film's length [...] "exhausting," [...] noting, [...] "Some of it sputters, settling for smiles instead of laughs, {{and much of it}} flounders while the slapdash script searches [...] for ever more common denominators in toilet humor." ...|$|E

2500|$|Friedgen {{was born}} on April 4, 1947 in Harrison, New York. His father, [...] "Big Ralph" [...] Friedgen, {{attended}} Fordham University, where he played from 1938 to 1939, and coached high school football for 30years. The younger Friedgen worked under his father as a water boy and manager, and the two often attended New York Giants and Jets games together. He attended Harrison High School where he played quarterback on his father's team. John Nugent, the head coach of Harrison's rival Rye High School, recommended that his brother, Maryland head coach Tom Nugent, recruit Friedgen. His recruitment was handled by Lee Corso, then an assistant coach at the school. After his first season at Maryland, Nugent was fired as head coach, and his successor Lou Saban moved Friedgen to fullback to fill in for an injured teammate. The following year, Maryland had a new coach, and Bob Ward again changed Friedgen's position, this time to offensive guard, although he had never blocked before. Upset about the constant turnover at head coach and position changes, Friedgen received a favorable recommendation to transfer from coach Ward, but his father said, [...] "You can transfer, but when <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>home,</b> the key you have {{is not going to}} fit the door because we're changing the lock. Quitters don't live here." [...] He remained at Maryland as a guard and later said the experience taught him a lesson in perseverance. As an undergraduate, {{he was a member of}} Phi Delta Theta Fraternity. After completion of his bachelor's degree in physical education in 1970, Friedgen served as a graduate assistant at his alma mater, before later accepting positions on the staffs of The Citadel, William and Mary, and Murray State. Joining him on many of these coaching stops was Frank Beamer, who later served as head coach at Virginia Tech.|$|E
