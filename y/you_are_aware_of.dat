500|$|Starting in 1967 and {{continuing}} until 1986, the Albanian government {{carried out a}} policy of [...] "bunkerisation" [...] that saw the construction {{of hundreds of thousands}} of bunkers across the country. They were built in every possible location, ranging from [...] "beaches and mountains, in vineyards and pastures, in villages and towns, even on the manicured lawns of Albania's best hotel". Hoxha envisaged Albania fighting a two-front war against an attack mounted by Yugoslavia, NATO or the Warsaw Pact involving a simultaneous incursion by up to eleven enemy airborne divisions. As he put it, [...] "If we slackened our vigilance even for a moment or toned down our struggle against our enemies in the least, they would strike immediately like the snake that bites you and injects its poison before <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rava asked Rabba bar Mari {{from where}} people derived the saying: [...] If <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> a {{derogatory}} matter about yourself, say it first before {{others say it}} about you. [...] Rabba bar Mari answered that the source was what Eliezer said in [...] “And he said: ‘I am Abraham’s servant,’” immediately proclaiming {{that he was a}} servant.|$|E
2500|$|These traits come to {{the fore}} in Hi, Mom!s [...] "Be Black, Baby" [...] {{sequence}}. This sequence parodies cinéma vérité, the dominant documentary tradition of the 1960s, while simultaneously providing the audience with a visceral and disturbingly emotional experience. De Palma describes the sequence as a constant invocation of Brechtian distanciation: [...] "First of all, I am interested in the medium of film itself, and I am constantly standing outside and making people aware that they are always watching a film. At the same time I am evolving it. In Hi, Mom! for instance, there is a sequence where you are obviously watching a ridiculous documentary and you are told that and <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> it, but it still sucks you in. There is a kind of Brechtian alienation idea here: <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> what you are watching {{at the same time that}} you are emotionally involved with it." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "They {{feared that}} <b>you</b> might have <b>been</b> ill {{used by some}} evilly {{disposed}} person during your unconsciousness," [...] explained the editor diplomatically; [...] "but as <b>you</b> say THAT <b>was</b> only for a moment, and that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> everything that happened"--He paused.|$|R
6000|$|... "I knew I should startle you," [...] he said; [...] "and do you know, {{you looked}} so busy that I {{hoped it would}} have fallen souse on your heads before <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> it. What <b>was</b> the Master saying to you, Lucy?" ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{report of}} the {{convention}} in the New York Tribune for Europe inspired women in Sheffield, England, {{to draw up a}} petition for woman suffrage and present it to the House of Lords and Harriet Taylor to write The Enfranchisement of Women. Harriet Martineau wrote a letter to Davis in August 1851 to thank her for sending a copy of the proceedings: [...] "I hope <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the interest excited in this country by that Convention, the strongest proof of which is the appearance of an article on the subject in the Westminster Review ...I am not without hope that this article will materially strengthen your hands, and I am sure it can not but cheer your hearts." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, certainly! I {{think the}} best course now would be {{to speak to me}} frankly {{respecting}} Von Konigstein; and, if <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> anything which has passed in England of a nature--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your {{father is}} {{worrying}} over {{it a good}} deal, Nellie, and it is better {{that he should not}} perceive that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> it. Just let things go on as they were." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah, there <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> safe, my dear Baron. I {{have been}} in despair. Here were the Count and his brother come to call on you to join them in {{dispersing}} a meeting of those poor Huguenots {{and they would not}} permit me to send out to call you in! I verily think they suspected that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Anne {{was forced}} to own {{that she had seen}} him on board, and her cheeks were in spite of herself such tell-tales that Mr. Fellowes could not help saying, [...] "It is not my part to rebuke you, madam, but if <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> this evasion, <b>you</b> will have a heavy {{reckoning}} to pay to the young man's parents." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Very well, then," [...] counsel said, [...] "we come to this. You deputed Rowan to {{see what}} he could do with Sinclair. Do you realize your {{responsibility}} in this matter? <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> what happened?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have the}} king's authority," [...] Colonel Crofton said to him, [...] "to act as {{temporary}} governor until another may be appointed. I {{do not know}} whether <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the circumstances that led to the flight of Don Juan de Munos?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have been}} rash to trust {{yourself}} {{in the hands of}} so very staid and demure a person. And, indeed, you owe your presence here at Mrs. Harold Smith's first Cabinet ball altogether to me. I don't know whether <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, thank heaven, Sy is well. I don't {{know what}} would become of us if she wasn't. It has been a hard and sorrowful year for us with Mr. Dean's {{business}} embarrassments, my feeble health, and May's death. I don't know that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> our loss, sir;" [...] and unaffected maternal grief gave sudden dignity to the faded, fretful face of the speaker.|$|R

6000|$|Miss Mary (slowly {{refolding}} letter). <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>aware,</b> then, <b>of</b> {{the contents}} of this note; and <b>you</b> <b>are</b> the friend of Alexander Morton, sen.? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, sir; I {{only thought}} {{you ought to}} be told. I leave it with you to mention it to others or not. Perhaps you will think it best to say nothing until the story gets about. Then you can say <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Really?" [...] Razumov {{shrugged his}} {{shoulders}} a little. He was about to pass on with a bow, when a sudden thought struck him. [...] "Yes. To be sure! In your confidential position <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> many things," [...] he murmured, looking at the cat.|$|E
6000|$|SHEFFIELD--First of all, Curt, I {{hope it is}} needless for me {{to express}} how very deeply we all feel for you in your sorrow.

6000|$|Then when King Arthur {{approached}} {{near enough}} he perceived by certain {{signs that the}} lady was the chiefest of those three, wherefore he paid his court to her especially, saying to her: [...] "Lady, it seems that I have been brought hitherward unto you and that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> my name and estate when you sent for me.

6000|$|... "Capt. Boggs, take Clarke to the block-house. Make {{him stay}} {{there if you}} have to lock him up," [...] {{commanded}} Col. Zane. [...] "Miller, as for you, I cannot condemn you without proof. If I knew positively that there were Indians on the island and that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> it, <b>you</b> would <b>be</b> a dead man in less time than it takes to say it. I will give you {{the benefit of the doubt}} and twenty-four hours to leave the Fort." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't think <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> {{the value}} of your wine," [...] he said. [...] "I have claret in my cellar which is not so good as this, and which costs more than you have asked. It is only fair to offer you seven-and-sixpence a bottle." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose, Mr. Plunkett," [...] said Morgan, {{carefully}} seasoning {{an alligator}} pear, [...] "that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> {{the fact that}} you will import a good deal of trouble for yourself into Kentucky if you take back the wrong man--that is, of course, if you take anybody back?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think," [...] he said coldly, [...] "that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> what my {{feelings}} and desired {{course of action}} have been with regard to those of my fellow creatures with whom I have happened to come into contact. It {{seems to me that}} I have been a trifle unfortunate in several instances." ...|$|E
5000|$|Having {{played with}} the Merseysippi Jazz Band for six years, in 1956 Parr joined the Mick Mulligan Band as a {{full-time}} professional musician and moved to London. By the late 1950s {{he had become a}} fine trombonist, though Melly said that his music was [...] "aimed beyond his technique. Sometimes a very beautiful idea came off, more often <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> a beautiful idea which existed in Frank's head." [...] The band's performances often suffered from the effects of alcohol, and Parr himself was often drunk.|$|R
6000|$|A sardonic gleam {{crept into}} Grace's eyes. [...] "Then, since you haven't done it, it {{is a little}} {{difficult}} to understand how <b>you</b> could <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> what they <b>are</b> saying." ...|$|R
60|$|THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. Only a more {{conceited}} one, madam, no doubt. Still, I do {{not quite}} see how <b>you</b> can <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> {{the existence of}} a thing without knowing it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly I do," [...] Dr. Ashleigh said vehemently. [...] "Mr. Harmer {{was one of}} {{my oldest}} and my dearest friends; and even were I not so deeply {{interested}} in the discovery of the will as I am, I would spend every penny I have in the world in seeing his wishes carried out. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the nature of the will?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have nothing}} to say to you, sir," [...] said the Vicar of St. Matthew's, looking very majestic, [...] "except that it is time you were {{returning}} to your ship. As to you," [...] turning to Edward Harewood, [...] "I can only say that if <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the peculiar circumstances of Adrian Vanderkist, your conduct can only be called fiendish." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Even {{your present}} wealth {{is not a}} true measure of your power. The {{strength}} of your wealth at this moment is only an empty shell. That is why you are crying out your feeble little battle-cry, 'Return to the ways of our fathers.' <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> your impotency.
