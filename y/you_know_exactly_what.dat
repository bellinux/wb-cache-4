25|$|There {{followed}} {{in quick succession}} two musicals which have secured Kelly's reputation as a major figure in the American musical film, An American in Paris (1951) and – probably {{the most popular and}} admired of all film musicals – Singin' in the Rain (1952). As co-director, lead star and choreographer, Kelly was the central driving force. Johnny Green, head of music at MGM at the time, said of him:Gene is easygoing as long as <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> you are doing when you're working with him. He's a hard taskmaster and he loves hard work. If you want to play on his team you'd better like hard work, too. He isn't cruel but he is tough, and if Gene believed in something he didn't care who he was talking to, whether it was Louis B. Mayer or the gatekeeper. He wasn't awed by anybody, and he had a good record of getting what he wanted.|$|E
500|$|Up! Live from Chicago {{received}} favorable critic reviews. Matt Bjorke of About.com {{reviewed the}} home release of Up! Close and Personal. He had not attended a Shania concert, nor seen the television special, {{and was surprised}} by the singer's stage presence. He believed that the video would make the singer's naysayers realize Shania's vocal talents and ability to entertainment and interact with a crowd. Bjorke concluded, [...] "Up! Live in Chicago is a dynamic DVD experience that is sure to please fans for years to come." [...] Chris Jones of BBC noted the band's differed from most country bands and wanted a more country-influenced sound. However, Jones complimented the singer's incorporation of the audience, naming it her [...] "inimitable style". He added that the video was [...] "far from [...] sterile experience" [...] because of the live setting and crowd ambiance. However, he suspected Shania's [...] "photocopy-perfect" [...] vocal delivery could be attributed to a fair amount of post-production work. [...] "Overall, <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> you're getting with Shania, and for her fans this is bound {{to be a very good}} thing indeed." [...] Bobby Reed of the Chicago Sun Times believed Shania failed to give insight into her identity or personality, noting she never mentioned her relocation to Switzerland or her then-new son, Eja. He complimented the band's strong, yet rote efforts of bringing the dense production to life. However, he claimed Shania's vocal delivery was at times frail. Reed also noted the absence of guest stars, in contrast to her two previous concert specials, and acknowledged that inviting fans onstage gave the concert a country-fair vibe. Mark Guarino of Arlington Heights' Daily Herald believed the concert was evidently tailored for television and that Shania played the proper host. He continued, [...] "As the night wore on, Shania tried different ways, with varying degrees of success, to make the magnitude of such a large event work for the small screen. Her reliance on audience participation was an attempt to humanize things, but it often backfired." ...|$|E

She attended songwriting camps in Europe, New York City and Los Angeles, and collaborated with many songwriters such as Allan Eshuijs. Paulini co-wrote songs for South African recording artist Sasha-Lee Davids, German girl group Monrose, Spanish recording artist Edurne, and [...] winner Yoann Fréget, among others. During February–March 2009 and again in October, Paulini alongside Christine Anu, Grace Knight and Monica Trapaga embarked on the Ladies of Jazz Tour in New South Wales, where they performed jazz classics from the 30's and 40's, as well as modern jazz hits. In November 2009, Paulini released the single [...] "Scarless" [...] to help raise awareness and support for White Ribbon Day, an international day to prevent violence against women. The song is based on an abusive relationship Paulini was in and was written to help other victims of domestic violence. [...] "Scarless" [...] marked the first time Paulini released music independently. On being an independent artist, Paulini told Auspop: [...] "For the first time I feel like I'm in control of my music...with the independent thing, <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> you're paying to who and you're in control from your music to what is written, to what you release out there – you're across it all, which is a great thing." [...] Upon its release, [...] "Scarless" [...] debuted at number 18 on the AIR Independent Radio Chart. Paulini was featured on Irish recording artist Ronan Keating's 2010 single [...] "Believe Again", which peaked at number 73 on the ARIA Singles Chart and was included on Keating's album Duet (2010).|$|E

Mamma, she said, was very sorry indeed to hear of the will being missing, and indeed was made quite ill by the news. She begged her to say how much she condoled with me upon it, and what a dreadful affair it was.

Still it would be an acknowledgment for the time of his guilt, and I am sure that Ned himself would not run away without standing his trial even if the doors of his cell were opened.

60|$|In German streets {{you must}} not shoot with a crossbow. The German law- maker does not content himself with the misdeeds of the average man--the crime one feels one wants to do, but must not: he worries himself imagining all the things a {{wandering}} maniac might do. In Germany {{there is no law}} against a man standing on his head {{in the middle of the}} road; the idea has not occurred to them. One of these days a German statesman, visiting a circus and seeing acrobats, will reflect upon this omission. Then he will straightway set to work and frame a clause forbidding people from standing on their heads in the middle of the road, and fixing a fine. This is the charm of German law: misdemeanour in Germany has its fixed price. You are not kept awake all night, as in England, wondering whether you will get off with a caution, be fined forty shillings, or, catching the magistrate in an unhappy moment for yourself, get seven days. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> your fun is going to cost you. You can spread out your money on the table, open your Police Guide, and plan out your holiday to a fifty pfennig piece. For a really cheap evening, I would recommend walking on the wrong side of the pavement after being cautioned not to do so. I calculate that by choosing your district and keeping to the quiet side streets you could walk for a whole evening on the wrong side of the pavement at a cost of little over three marks.|$|E

60|$|Before we {{can clearly}} {{understand}} how baleful is this condition of intimidation {{in which we}} live, {{it is necessary to}} clear up the confusion made by our use of the word imagination to denote two very different powers of mind. One is the power to imagine things as they are not: this I call the romantic imagination. The other is the power to imagine things as they are without actually sensing them; and this I will call the realistic imagination. Take for example marriage and war. One man has a vision of perpetual bliss with a domestic angel at home, and of flashing sabres, thundering guns, victorious cavalry charges, and routed enemies in the field. That is romantic imagination; and the mischief it does is incalculable. It begins in silly and selfish expectations of the impossible, and ends in spiteful disappointment, sour grievance, cynicism, and misanthropic resistance to any attempt to better a hopeless world. The wise man knows that imagination is not only a means of pleasing himself and beguiling tedious hours with romances and fairy tales and fools' paradises (a quite defensible and delightful amusement when <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> you are doing and where fancy ends and facts begin), but also a means of foreseeing and being prepared for realities as yet unexperienced, and of testing the possibility and desirability of serious Utopias. He does not expect his wife to be an angel; nor does he overlook the facts that war depends on the rousing of all the murderous blackguardism still latent in mankind; that every victory means a defeat; that fatigue, hunger, terror, and disease are the raw material which romancers work up into military glory; and that soldiers for the most part go to war as children go to school, because they are afraid not to. They are afraid even to say they are afraid, as such candor is punishable by death in the military code.|$|E

He did his duty, but he did it with an abstracted mind. He was kind, gentle, and foolish. He had a great belief in the honour of boys; he felt that the first thing to make them truthful was not to let it enter your head for a moment that it was possible for them to lie.

He had no great faith in examinations, for he noticed that boys never did so well in them as in form: it was disappointing, but not significant.
