5|$|Bryce Dallas Howard (born March 2, 1981) is an American film actress, director, producer, and writer. Howard {{attended}} New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, {{but left}} before graduating {{to take on}} roles on Broadway. During a performance of As <b>You</b> <b>Like</b> It where Howard portrayed Rosalind, she {{caught the attention of}} director M. Night Shyamalan, and he cast her in what would be her breakout film, the psychological thriller The Village (2004) and then in the fantasy thriller Lady in the Water (2006). Her performance in Kenneth Branagh’s film adaptation of As <b>You</b> <b>Like</b> It (2006) earned her a Golden Globe Award nomination. In 2006 she co-wrote and directed the short film Orchids.|$|E

5|$|Borrowing {{from the}} French again, Planché {{introduced}} the revue (or review) to British theatre, as {{a commentary on}} recent events, particularly events in the theatre. His first revue, Success; or, a hit if <b>you</b> <b>like</b> it, was produced in 1825. He wrote another seven over the next 30 years, a peak of four in the years 1853–1855.|$|E
5|$|For several years, Howard {{appeared}} in New York plays. Among these were House & Garden, a 2002 Alan Ayckbourn production {{held at the}} Manhattan Theatre Club, in which she portrayed a disdainful, flirtatious teen. While performing as Rosalind in the critically acclaimed 2003 William Shakespeare comedy production As <b>You</b> <b>Like</b> It at The Public Theater, Howard {{caught the eye of}} director M.

Travel as many miles as <b>you</b> <b>like</b> and go where you will, it is highly {{improbable}} that you will find a spot with so many magnificent nature advantages as has St. Johns. The fine stretch of level land on which the city is located, the deep water of the two rivers, the navigable sloughs and the superb scenery which nature has painted with a master hand, makes the location an ideal one in every respect either for industries or residences.|$|E
5000|$|Newfoundland English also {{includes}} nonstandard or innovative features in verb conjugation. In many varieties, the third-person singular inflection is generalized to a present tense marker; for example, the verb [...] "to like" [...] is conjugated I <b>likes,</b> <b>you</b> <b>likes,</b> he/she/it <b>likes,</b> we <b>likes,</b> <b>you</b> <b>likes,</b> and they likes; this feature and the preceding one generate the distinctive {{characteristics of the}} representative couplet I's de b'y dat builds de boat / And I's de b'y dat sails 'er.|$|R

5|$|The Letter Preference Task is the second-most popular {{method to}} measure {{implicit}} self-esteem, surpassed {{only by the}} Implicit Association Test. The task has also been called the Name Letter Preference Task, Name-Letter-Ratings Measure, and Initial Preference Task. There is no standard method for applying the task. The most commonly used one is a letter rating task, which involves having participants judge all {{the letters of the}} alphabet. Even within this method there are variations in the instructions (how much <b>you</b> <b>like</b> the letters or how attractive you find them), in the rating scales (five-point, seven-point, or nine-point), in the order of the letters (random or alphabetical), and in data collection (paper-and-pencil or computer-based).|$|E
5|$|Both yes–no {{questions}} and wh-questions in English are mostly formed using subject–auxiliary inversion (Am I going tomorrow?, Where can we eat?), which may require do-support (Do <b>you</b> <b>like</b> her?, Where did he go?). In most cases, interrogative words (wh-words; e.g. what, who, where, when, why, how) {{appear in a}} fronted position. For example, in the question What did you see?, the word what appears as the first constituent despite being the grammatical object of the sentence. (When the wh-word is the subject or forms part of the subject, no inversion occurs: Who saw the cat?.) Prepositional phrases can also be fronted when they are the question's theme, e.g. To whose house did you go last night?. The personal interrogative pronoun who is the only interrogative pronoun to still show inflection for case, with the variant whom serving as the objective case form, although this form may be going out of use in many contexts.|$|E
5|$|Hordern came to {{prominence}} in the early 1950s when he {{took part in a}} theatrical competition at the Arts Theatre in London. There, he impressed Glen Byam Shaw who secured the actor a season-long contract at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre where he played major parts, including Caliban in The Tempest, Jaques in As <b>You</b> <b>Like</b> It, and Sir Politick Would-Be in Ben Jonson's comedy Volpone. The following season Hordern joined Michael Benthall's company at the Old Vic where, among other parts, he played Polonius in Hamlet, and the title role in King John. In 1958 he won a best actor award at that year's British Academy Television Awards for his role as the barrister in John Mortimer's courtroom drama The Dock Brief. Along with his theatrical responsibilities Hordern had regular minor roles in various films including Cleopatra (1963), and A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum (1966).|$|E
