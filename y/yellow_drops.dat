While searching a shipwreck for the Orb, Toan finds a lamp that releases a friendly genie, Ruby, who joins them. They eventually find the Moon Orb, but are unable to summon the Moon Ship. As such, they head to the Sun and Moon Temple in Muska Lacka, where the Moon Ship is located. There, they meet a sand warrior named Ungaga, who joins them and helps them activate the Moon Ship. They {{travel to the}} moon city of <b>Yellow</b> <b>Drops,</b> and meet Osmond, a Moon Person who asks for help in collecting the scattered pieces of a giant battle robot called the Sun Giant, which the Moon People believes can destroy the Genie. When the Sun Giant is complete, the party and a crew of Moon People travel to Dark Heaven Castle, where the Genie now resides.|$|E
500|$|In {{conditions}} of high humidity, several species can form striking colored drops on the actively growing caps: red drops in H.peckii, H.diabolus, H.ferrugineum, and H.cruentum, <b>yellow</b> <b>drops</b> in H.caeruleum, and coffee-colored drops in H.mirabile. The common names of H.peckii reflect its appearance: [...] "strawberries and cream" [...] and [...] "bleeding tooth fungus". Some Hydnellum species have a mealy odor (e.g. H.mirabile and H.pineticola) similar to freshly ground flour. H.zonatum smells like melilot, while H.suaveolens has a sweet odor resembling anise or peppermint. All are too tough and woody to be edible, {{and many have}} an acrid taste anyway.|$|E

25|$|This tree {{is being}} {{considered}} for more extensive plantings in semiarid locales. Its favorable qualities include resistance to drought, fire, insects, decay, and damage from ozone, and its aggressive rooting system and tolerance to variable growing medium.

The reason is unknown, although drought or insects may be possible causes.|$|R

Siegmund perceived first one, {{and then another}} dimmer one, flicker out in the darkness over the sea. He stood perfectly still, watching them. Gradually he remembered how, in the cathedral, the tapers of the choir-stalls would tremble and set steadily to burn, opening the darkness point after point with <b>yellow</b> <b>drops</b> of flame, as the acolyte touched them, one by one, delicately with his rod. The night was religious, then, with its proper order of worship. Day and night had their ritual, and passed in uncouth worship.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Jatropha curcas L. is an {{important}} biofuel crop grown worldwide. In Benin, however, the plant is attacked by rot diseases resulting in rotting, wilting, <b>yellowing,</b> <b>dropping</b> of leaves, blackening, decaying of affected areas and later death of the plant. The objective {{of the current study}} was to identify the causal agents of the disease. Methodology and results: Diseased samples were collected from field, surface sterilized and plated on PDA medium. Pure cultures were observed on plate and under microscope. Lasiodiplodia theobromae was consistently isolated from diseased plants collected from the field. Inoculation of L. theobromae to 1 -year-old jatropha plants resulted in typical symptoms of the disease, confirming the fungus pathogenicity on Jatropha. Conclusion and application of results: As conclusion, of L. theobromae is the causal agent of the diseas...|$|R

60|$|But {{the glory}} of the château was the large garden behind the house. It was {{completely}} enclosed by a very high wall, and, like the house, was nearly square in its proportions. It contained miles of walks, and each walk so like the others, that a stranger might wander there for a week without knowing that he had retraversed the same ground, were it not that he could not fail to recognize the quaint groups of figures which met him at every turn. A few of these were of stone, rudely sculptured, but by far the greater number were of painted wood, and, like the shepherds and shepherdesses in the drawing-room, displayed every action of rural life. You would suddenly come upon a rosy-coloured gentleman, with a gun to his shoulder, in the act of shooting game--then a girl with a basket of huge cabbages--an old man in a fit of the cholic; the same rosy gentleman violently kissing a violet-coloured young lady; and, at the next turn, you would find the violet-coloured young lady fast asleep upon a bank. You would meet a fat curé a dozen times in half-an-hour, and always well employed. He would be saying his prayers--drinking beer--blessing a young maiden, and cudgelling a mule that wouldn't stir a step for him, till the large <b>yellow</b> <b>drops</b> of sweat were falling from his face. It was inconceivable how so many painted figures, in such a variety of attitudes, could have been designed and executed; but there they were, the great glory of the old gardener, and the endless amusement of the peasants of the neighbourhood, who were allowed to walk there on the summer Sunday evenings.|$|E

50|$|A pear drop is a British boiled sweet {{made from}} sugar and flavourings. The classic pear drop is a {{combination}} of half pink and half yellow in a pear-shaped drop {{about the size of a}} thumbnail, although they are more commonly found in packets containing separate <b>yellow</b> <b>drops</b> and pink drops in roughly equal proportions. The artificial flavours isoamyl acetate and ethyl acetate are responsible for the characteristic flavour of pear drops: the former confers a banana flavour, the latter a pear flavour. Both esters are used in many pear and banana flavoured sweets. However, a natural pear-derived product from pear juice concentrate is sometimes used.|$|E

5000|$|Spores of Hydnellum {{are almost}} spherical to oblong and tuberculate, and are brown in mass. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are {{narrowly}} club-shaped and usually four-spored; {{there are no}} cystidia in Hydnellum.

50|$|The equine botfly {{presents}} seasonal difficulties to equestrian caretakers, as it lays eggs on {{the insides}} of horses' front legs, on the cannon bone and knees, and sometimes on the throat or nose, depending on the species. These eggs, which look like small, <b>yellow</b> <b>drops</b> of paint, must be carefully removed during the laying season (late summer and early fall) to prevent infestation in the horse. When a horse rubs its nose on its legs, the eggs are transferred to the mouth, {{and from there to}} the intestines, where the larvae grow and attach themselves to the stomach lining or the small intestine. The attachment of the larvae to the tissue produces a mild irritation which results in erosions and ulcerations at this site. Removal of the eggs (which adhere to the host's hair) is difficult, since the bone and tendons are directly under the skin on the cannon bones: eggs must be removed with a sharp knife (often a razor blade) or rough sand paper, and caught before they reach the ground. The larvae remain attached and develop for 10-12 months before they are passed out in the feces. Occasionally, horse owners report seeing the botfly larvae in horse manure. These larvae are cylindrical in shape and are reddish orange in color. In one to two months, adult botflies emerge from the developing larvae and the cycle repeats. Bots can be controlled with several types of dewormers, including dichlorvos, ivermectin, and trichlorfon.|$|E

40|$|The ectomycorrhizal {{status of}} Sistotrema sp. {{is shown by}} morphological–anatomical and {{molecular}} identification, confirming earlier reports about Sistotrema DNA in ectomycorrhizae (ECM). For molecular identification of the ECM nuclear rDNA ITS sequences obtained from mycorrhizal root tips and fruitbodies of Sistotrema sp. were compared. Blast searches using the Sistotrema sp. sequences as query were performed in GenBank and UNITE for comparison with previously published Sistotrema sequences. The morphological–anatomical characterization of the ECM used well-established protocols for the examination of all mantle parts and rhizomorphs in different sections and views including detailed illustrations. The ECM are irregularly monopodial–pyramidal, whitish ochre to yellow ochre, and woolly. Older ones become more greyish and silvery at some patches. Diagnostic anatomical characteristics are irregularly inflated emanating and rhizomorph hyphae, ampullately inflated clamps, and the occurrence of <b>yellow</b> <b>drops</b> within the hyphae. The plectenchymatous mantle shows ring-like arranged hyphae, and a slightly gelatinous matrix. The ECM of Sistotrema sp. are compared {{to those of other}} species that form distinctly ampullate hyphae in rhizomorphs, too.
