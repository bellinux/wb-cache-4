5|$|Rinkeby Swedish (after Rinkeby, {{a suburb}} of {{northern}} Stockholm with a large immigrant population) is a common name among linguists for varieties of Swedish spoken by <b>young</b> <b>people</b> <b>of</b> foreign heritage in certain suburbs and urban districts in the major cities of Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö. These varieties could alternatively be classified as sociolects, because the immigrant dialects share common traits independent of their geographical spread or the native country of the speakers. However, some studies have found distinctive features and led to terms such as Rosengård Swedish (after Rosengård in Malmö), a variant of Scanian. A survey made by the Swedish linguist Ulla-Britt Kotsinas showed that foreign learners had difficulties in guessing the origins of Rinkeby Swedish speakers in Stockholm. The greatest difficulty proved to be identifying the speech of a boy speaking Rinkeby Swedish whose parents were both Swedish; only 1.8% guessed his native language correctly.|$|E
5|$|The arts {{scene in}} Antananarivo {{is the largest}} and most vibrant in the country. Madagascar's diverse music is {{reflected}} in the many concerts, cabarets, dance clubs and other musical venues throughout Antananarivo. In the dry season, outdoor concerts are regularly held in venues including the Antsahamanitra amphitheater and Mahamasina Stadium. Concerts and night clubs are attended mainly by <b>young</b> <b>people</b> <b>of</b> the middle to upper classes who can afford the entrance fees. More affordable are performances of traditional vakindrazana or Malagasy operettas at Isotry Theater and hira gasy at the city's outdoor cheminots theater or Alliance française; these performances are more popular with older and rural audiences than among urban youth. Nightlife is the most animated in the ville moyenne neighborhoods of Antaninarenina, Tsaralalana, Behoririka, Mahamasina and Andohalo.|$|E

Socrates later clarifies that point of philosophy when he says that whatever wisdom he possesses comes from knowing that he knows nothing (23b, 29b).|$|E

40|$|This article explores <b>young</b> <b>people’s</b> {{understandings}} <b>of</b> assessments {{conducted in}} secure accommodation. The concepts of ‘institutional identity’ and ‘text-mediated’ actions {{have been used}} in the analysis. The main empirical material is repeated interviews with assessed <b>young</b> <b>people</b> during a two-year period. In the findings, the stories <b>of</b> three <b>young</b> <b>people</b> display understandings <b>of</b> appreciation, disappointment and self-development. The assessments seem to have made the youths aware of their ‘failings and faults’. An analysis of the written assessments found institutional identities of ‘inner problems and unstructured everyday lives’. In conclusion, the <b>young</b> <b>people’s</b> understandings <b>of</b> the meanings and implications of the assessments are suggested to be connected to the caseworkers’ text-mediated actions and their position in the assessment process. The <b>young</b> <b>people’s</b> stories indicate the need to consider the institutional context of the assessments and to acknowledge <b>young</b> <b>people’s</b> efforts in care...|$|R
