The Norwegian Telecommunications Administration's assistant director of radio technology, Per Mortensen, was appointed chief inspector, while the manager of Ny-Ålesund's coast radio station was appointed assistant inspector.

5|$|A. Newton {{requested}} further specimens, especially males, but in 1875 {{he finally}} published {{a plate of}} the female, lamenting that no male specimens could be found. Tafforet's 1726 account had been rediscovered the previous <b>year,</b> <b>and</b> <b>A.</b> Newton noted that it confirmed his assumption that the male would turn out be much more colourful than the female. Newton's collector, Henry H. Slater, had seen a live Newton's parakeet the year before, but was not carrying a gun at the time. On 14 August 1875, William Vandorous shot a male specimen. It {{may have been the}} same specimen Slater had observed. It was subsequently sent to E. Newton by William J. Caldwell. This is the paratype of the species, numbered UMZC 18/Psi/67/h/2 and housed in the Cambridge Museum.|$|E

5|$|Al-Jamri is {{most notable}} {{for his role}} during the 1990s {{uprising}} in Bahrain.

Due to his civil rights activity, al-Jamri was imprisoned between April and September 1995, before being arrested again in January 1996 and imprisoned until July 1999, which was followed by a <b>year</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half of house arrest.|$|E

5|$|Although many Old Court supporters—typically the state's wealthy aristocracy—gravitated to the National Republican Party (later to {{be called}} Whigs) that formed in the 1820s, it is {{inaccurate}} to assume the Anti-Relief Party as a whole became National Republicans and the Relief Party became Democrats. The primary factor in determining which party Kentuckians aligned with was their faith in Whig Party founder and native son, Henry Clay. From the election of Thomas Metcalfe in 1828 to the expiration of John L. Helm's term in 1851, only one Democrat held the office of governor: John Breathitt, who died a <b>year</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half into his term and was succeeded in office by his lieutenant governor, James Turner Morehead, a National Republican.|$|E
