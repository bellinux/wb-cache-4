500|$|T. R. Knight {{signed on}} for the pilot as O'Malley, expecting that the role might be short-lived, because he liked that the {{character}} was multi-faceted. In October 2006, news reports surfaced that Washington had insulted Knight with a homophobic slur, during an argument with Patrick Dempsey (Derek Shepherd). Shortly after, {{the details of the}} argument became public, and Knight later disclosed that the slur made him come out as gay. [...] "I was under no delusions," [...] Knight said at the time. [...] "My friends on the set knew. We talked about it. Publicly it's not my thing to call up People magazine and be like, 'Hey, <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> something about me?'...I could've just let it slide and not said anything, but it became important. It became important to make the statement." [...] The situation seemed somewhat resolved when Washington issued a statement, apologizing for his [...] "unfortunate use of words during the recent incident on-set".|$|E
500|$|The first governor-general of {{independent}} India, Chakravarti Rajagopalachari, said [...] "Vivekananda saved Hinduism, saved India". According to Subhas Chandra Bose, {{a proponent of}} armed struggle for Indian independence, Vivekananda was [...] "the maker of modern India"; for Gandhi, Vivekananda's influence increased Gandhi's [...] "love for his country a thousandfold". Vivekananda influenced India's independence movement; his writings inspired independence activists such as Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, Aurobindo Ghose, Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Bagha Jatin and intellectuals such as Aldous Huxley, Christopher Isherwood, Romain Rolland. Many years after Vivekananda's death Rabindranath Tagore told French Nobel laureate Romain Rolland, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> India, study Vivekananda. In him everything is positive and nothing negative". Rolland wrote, [...] "His words are great music, phrases {{in the style of}} Beethoven, stirring rhythms like the march of Händel choruses. I cannot touch these sayings of his, scattered as they are through the pages of books, at thirty years' distance, without receiving a thrill through my body like an electric shock. And what shocks, what transports, must have been produced when in burning words they issued from the lips of the hero!" ...|$|E

500|$|The adult defendants, {{facing the}} death penalty, portrayed {{themselves}} at trial as unwilling {{participants in the}} conspiracy. [...] The examination of defendant Veljko Cubrilović (who helped coordinate the transport of the weapons and was a Narodna Odbrana agent) is illustrative of this effort. Cubrilović stated to the court: [...] "Princip glared at me and very forcefully said 'If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know,</b> it is for that reason {{and we are going}} to carry out an assassination of the Heir and if you know about it, you have to be quiet. If you betray it, you and your family will be destroyed.'" [...] Under questioning by defense counsel Cubrilović described in more detail the basis of the fears that he said had compelled him to cooperate with Princip and Grabež." [...] Cubrilović explained that he was afraid a revolutionary organization capable of committing great atrocities stood behind Princip and that he therefore feared his house would be destroyed and his family killed if he did not comply and explained that he knew such an organization existed in Serbia, at least at one time. When pressed for why he risked the punishment of the law, and did not take the protection of the law against these threats he responded: [...] "I was more afraid of terror than the law." ...|$|E
500|$|Carl Kimlinger from Anime News Network was sharply {{critical}} {{of the first two}} episodes of the anime adaptation. He did praise the show for [...] " [...] back the terror of the fee-fi-fo-fum set", but then said that it [...] "does not a good show make". Kimlinger criticized Araki's direction, saying he [...] "clearly intends it to be powerful and unsettling, but it's just crude and unpleasant." [...] On the other hand, other critics from Anime News Network praised much of the series. Rebecca Silverman said it [...] "is both gorgeous and appalling in its visuals", and [...] "an excellent mix of what 18th century Gothic novelist Ann Radcliffe defined as horror versus terror: the one is physical, making you want to look away, and the other is intellectual, making <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what's going to happen next." [...] Though there are several apocalyptic action shows, Carlo Santos noted that [...] "few get as close to perfection as Attack on Titan does". Santos described it as [...] "a masterpiece of death and destruction" [...] even if he only watched the first episode. Theron Martin of Anime News Network praised the musical score and the [...] "intense, impactful first episode" [...] despite his feeling that it has [...] "limited animation". Martin also compared Attack on Titan vibe and visual aesthetic to Claymore. John Sinnott of DVD Talk called the series one of the best ones he has ever watched and one [...] "that anime fans should not miss." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{review in}} Publishers Weekly called the book an [...] "exuberant parade of pork fat", and commented, [...] "there's plenty {{good to be}} had in these pages". Writing for Library Journal, Judith Sutton concluded, [...] "There are, in fact, several other cookbooks devoted to bacon, {{including}} Sara Perry's Everything Tastes Better with Bacon, but with its irresistible recipes and wealth of information and lore, Villas's new title is recommended for most collections." [...] Amy Culbertson of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram also compared the Villas's work to another book on bacon, writing, [...] "His is a more definitive cookbook than last year's [...] "Seduced by Bacon" [...] by Joanna Pruess". The book was highlighted in the [...] "Holiday Cookbook Roundup: Gift Guide" [...] column of The Austin Chronicle, where writer Mick Vann concluded, [...] "This {{is one of the}} few cookbooks you'll find where every single recipe makes you want to head straight for the stove, whether it's a bacon, goat cheese, and sweet-onion pie; Russian borscht; beef-stuffed plantains; or braised Japanese pork belly. For those fellow bacon lovers in our midst, Villas' The Bacon Cookbook is required reading." [...] In honor of International Bacon Day in 2009, the National Pork Board offered recipes from The Bacon Cookbook. Bonnie Stern of Financial Post recommended the book, and commented, [...] "Few of us can resist the allure of sizzling, smokey, crispy bacon. Though not usually high on the list of foods that are considered good for you, if you don't eat it often, you can have your bacon and eat it, too. If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> all about bacon, have a look at The Bacon Cookbook by James Villas".|$|E
