2500|$|I {{would have}} to pick Erica's legal {{abortion}} back in 1973. Number one, it was timely. Abortion had only recently been legalized when Erica decided not to have her baby. Secondly, it was a bold move. I can't think of a hotter political topic for the time than abortion (it still remains a subject that soaps tend to avoid as much as possible; women may contemplate abortions, but rarely go through with having them). Erica's abortion let the fans know that All My Children was going to tackle some major issues. What made it work {{was the fact that}} it was the perfect marriage of character to social issue storyline. We've all watched shows where some character develops a social issue problem that feels artificial to them as though it's been tacked onto them as some sort of glorified public service announcement. But Erica's abortion made sense. She was a rising model who didn't want a baby to derail that career. Whether <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>or</b> <b>disagree</b> with her decision, you understand her rationale. That really is important for these social issue storylines to succeed [...] that they really be paired up with the right characters.|$|E

50|$|Turning to Judge Mayer’s arguments, {{the blog}} observes:It is totally fair {{to have a}} policy debate about the purpose of our patent laws, what they should protect, and how the patent laws coexist with the Constitution, and with other laws, {{including}} copyright law.

Above all, what I {{would like to see}} is more certain law on which I could rely to counsel my clients.
