[...] Two reviews of Honey on the website Anime Jump greatly diverged: site maintainer Mike Toole rated the series 3.5 out of 5 stars and called it [...] "tons of fun, a light, tasty action-comedy that's... spirited and silly and tongue-in-cheek", and praised its character designs as [...] "letter-perfect to Go Nagai's original (quite appealing!) character designs"; Jason Carter praised Calvello's voice work in his review of the 2004 ADV release, but rated it 1.5 out of 5 stars, said that much of Cosplay City [...] "goes back and forth between looking like an ordinary modern metropolis and resembling some sort of Smurf town built of polluted marshmallows", and concluded [...] "The characters are largely annoying, the plot is , the nudity is absurd, the fighting is rarely more than average, and the whole thing is ultimately pointless - as the series' later attempts at developing Honey as a person make all too clear." [...] Sandra Dozier of DVD Verdict was also unimpressed with Honey: [...] "I can see why it is popular—the glossy animation, the well-endowed chicks, the scant clothing. If that isn't your thing, however, there is very little to draw <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> series." ...|$|E

Bouazizi was posthumously awarded the 2011 Sakharov Prize as one of [...] "five representatives of the Arab people, in recognition and support of their drive for freedom and human rights". On 17 December, a cart statue was unveiled in Sidi Bouzid in honor of Bouazizi. Tunisia's first elected president Moncef Marzouki attended the ceremony, stating [...] "Thank <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> land, which has been marginalised for centuries, for bringing dignity to the entire Tunisian people." [...] Also, in Sidi Bouzid, {{as well as in the}} capital city of Tunis, both cities' respective main streets were renamed, [...] "Boulevard Mohamed Bouazizi".

2500|$|After the {{dissolution}} of the Rump, power passed temporarily to a council that debated what form the constitution should take. They took up the suggestion of Major-General Thomas Harrison for a [...] "sanhedrin" [...] of saints. Although Cromwell did not subscribe to Harrison's apocalyptic, Fifth Monarchist beliefs—which saw a sanhedrin as the starting point for Christ's rule on earth—he was attracted by the idea of an assembly made up of men chosen for their religious credentials. In his speech {{at the opening of the}} assembly on 4 July 1653, Cromwell thanked God’s providence that he believed had brought England to this point and set out their divine mission: [...] "truly God hath called <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> work by, I think, as wonderful providences as ever passed upon the sons of men in so short a time." [...] The Nominated Assembly, sometimes known as the Parliament of Saints, or more commonly and denigratingly called Barebone's Parliament after one of its members, Praise-God Barebone. The assembly was tasked with finding a permanent constitutional and religious settlement (Cromwell was invited to be a member but declined). However, the revelation that a considerably larger segment of the membership than had been believed were the radical Fifth Monarchists led to its members voting to dissolve it on 12 December 1653, out of fear of what the radicals might do if they took control of the Assembly.|$|E
2500|$|The {{challenge}} of designing Belle and the Beast's costumes paled {{in comparison to}} the difficulty of creating the enchanted objects, a combination of intricate wiring, prosthetics and pyrotechnics. Scale was the most prominent [...] "obstacle" [...] for Hould-Ward's to overcome: [...] "The problem was the presentation of an actor as a life-sized teapot when the characters in the film were so little in comparison". Because the castle's enchanted staff is slowly transforming into objects, shown at various stages of transformation without ever completely becoming the objects themselves, Hould-Ward was required to create several different costumes for each character in order to depict the transformation as the show progresses. Meanwhile, the costume of Lumiere alone was built by a team of forty people, including a creator of the prosthetic candle, hair and Vacuform specialist; the pyrotechnician, man responsible for equipping the costume's pyro unit with butane and man operating the butane tank were each separate people. While transforming animation into real life, Hould-Ward also worked on incorporating the human body each costume, explaining, [...] "I wanted the reality of the real person rather than the fantasy of the object... The essence of my job is to allow my real actors to take <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> fantastical place." [...] A system of wired frames was used to help the actors support their characters' heavy garments. Such elaborate costumes had never been designed for a Broadway production before. Cogsworth's costume features a fully functioning clock on his face. Meanwhile, Madame de la Grande Bouche was the production's most expensive costume.|$|E

[...] "Truly, little brother," [...] answered Monster Slayer, [...] "you shall have it." [...] Ground Squirrel went to , saw that he was dead, and put some of his blood on his face and danced and sang. The face of every ground squirrel bears red streaks to this day.
