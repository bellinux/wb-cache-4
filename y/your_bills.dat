6000|$|... “Why didn’t you {{scrap the}} blamed {{condenser}} if you doubted it?” Clay broke in. “I haven’t cut <b>your</b> <b>bills,</b> and this boat {{has got to}} go when I want her.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Put up <b>your</b> <b>bills</b> if you choose," [...] {{interrupted}} the Commissary. [...] "In {{an hour or}} so I will examine your papers at the office. But now go; I am busy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, I {{tell you}} what!" [...] said Mr. Jaggers. [...] "Once for all. If you don't know that <b>your</b> <b>Bill's</b> in good hands, I know it. And {{if you come}} here bothering about <b>your</b> <b>Bill,</b> I'll make an example of both <b>your</b> <b>Bill</b> and you, and let him slip through my fingers. Have you paid Wemmick?" ...|$|R

60|$|Flo. For this I bate {{you three}} weeks of your service; now hear <b>your</b> <b>bill</b> of faults; for your comfort 'tis a short one.|$|R
60|$|Pleas. O, I find it now! you {{are going}} to set up <b>your</b> <b>bills,</b> like a love-mountebank, for the speedy cure of distressed widows, old ladies, and languishing maids in the green-sickness: a {{sovereign}} remedy.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{can give}} me more bills ..." [...] urged Segrave, [...] "and you lose ... you may not lose after this ... 'tis lucky to play on credit ... and ... and <b>your</b> <b>bills</b> are always met, my lord ..." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are {{overdrawn}} at your bank, <b>your</b> <b>bills</b> are {{heavier than}} ever this month, {{and there are}} five or six special accounts--one for some electric fittings, another for the hire of a motor-car--which ought to be paid." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'The {{sooner the}} better, young man. Pay <b>your</b> <b>bill</b> and be off. All my rooms is wanted for gentlefolks, {{and not for}} such as you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{suppose that}} my friend has made himself liable for <b>your</b> <b>bill</b> because he paid you £15 {{with the view}} of {{assisting}} Goarly," [...] said Morton.|$|R

6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Mr. Bascom, kindly, [...] "if {{you have}} any more I was going to suggest that you {{distribute}} 'em round among the boys. That's the way I do, and most folks don't guess they're <b>your</b> <b>bills.</b> See?" ...|$|E
6000|$|This sudden closing {{with him}} made the perfumer rather uneasy; {{but he was}} not to pay for three months, and so he said, [...] "Done!" [...] too, and went on: [...] "What would you say if <b>your</b> <b>bills</b> were paid?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sure thing," [...] said Deering, {{who did not}} smile. [...] "When {{you send}} <b>your</b> <b>bill</b> along, I'll try to make good. That's all; I guess we'll let it go." ...|$|R
6000|$|MALISE. This is a {{very fine}} unexpurgated {{translation}} of Boccaccio's [...] "Decameron," [...] Mr. Haywood illustrated. I should say you would get more than the amount of <b>your</b> <b>bill</b> for them.|$|R

6000|$|... "Ay, but I am! Orders to join my {{regiment}} by {{the first}} of October, and to be shot as soon afterwards as is fitting for the honour of my country. So, Miss Val, you must be quick in making good friends with the heir-at-law; or else you won't get <b>your</b> <b>bills</b> paid any more." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You can do {{any thing}} you like with a husband {{a good deal}} older than yourself.

6000|$|... "It is on {{the whole}} {{fortunate}} my nerves are reasonably good," [...] she said. [...] "It would be singularly inconvenient if Charley's whisky-smuggling friends should visit us to-night. <b>Your</b> <b>bills</b> could, one would fancy, be got rid of more easily than English notes, and I understand there are {{a good many of}} them in Charley's room." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My man, I've got {{something}} to say about this as well as you. It's thirteen dollars. You'll make out <b>your</b> <b>bill</b> for that, and you'll take it, too, or you'll not get a cent." ...|$|R
60|$|BURGE. We {{shall have}} to draft a Bill: that is the long and the short of it. Until you have <b>your</b> <b>Bill</b> drafted you don't {{know what you are}} really doing: that is my experience.|$|R
6000|$|... "What, ho! Babbalanja!" [...] cried Media {{from under}} a tree, [...] "don't be a duck, there, with <b>your</b> <b>bill</b> in the air; drop your metaphysics, man, and fall to on the solids. Do you hear?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Take your pay like a man, Amateur, {{and look}} {{pleasant}} about it. There'll be no chance {{for you to}} handle the city's money until after being at headquarters a month, {{and in the meantime}} you've got to pay <b>your</b> <b>bills.</b> I did count on lending you enough to pull through on; but perhaps this will be the best way. What about that firebug of yours? Has the imitation detective caught him yet?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{security}} is hardly satisfactory," [...] said Aunt Rebecca immovably. [...] "You know well enough I haven't much money, Jane Lavinia. I thought when I was coaxed into giving you two quarters' lessons with Miss Claxton {{that it was}} {{as much as you}} could expect me to do for you.

6000|$|... "I {{told you}} I {{could make you}} governor, Mr. Crewe," [...] Mr. Tooting was saying. [...] "Say, {{why do you think}} the Northeastern crowd--why do you think Hilary Vane is pushing <b>your</b> <b>bills</b> down the sidings? I'll tell you, because they know you're a man of ability, and they're afraid of you, and they know you're a gentleman, and can't be trusted with their deals, so they just shunted you off at Kodunk with a jolly about sendin' you to Congress if you made a hit on a {{national}} speech. I've been in the business a good many years, and I've seen and done some things for the Northeastern that stick in my throat"--(at this point Victoria sat down again and gripped the arms of her chair), [...] "I don't like to see a decent man sawbucked the way they're teeterin' you, Mr. Crewe. I know what I'm talkin' about, and I tell you that Ridout and Jake Botcher and Brush Bascom haven't any more notion of lettin' <b>your</b> <b>bills</b> out of committee than they have Gaylord's. Why? Because they've got orders not to." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And go to prison!" [...] she protested angrily. [...] "How {{much better}} off would you be there, I wonder, and what about when you came out? Pooh! Pay <b>your</b> <b>bill</b> and let's get out of this." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My friend," [...] {{the latter}} exclaimed, [...] "pay <b>your</b> <b>bill</b> {{and let us}} depart! I am in no humor for the cafés to-night. Let us go to your rooms and sit quietly, or drive--whichever you choose." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bill? When you say Bill, do {{you mean}} <b>Bill?</b> <b>Your</b> brother <b>Bill?</b> My {{brother-in-law}} Bill? Jolly old William, the son and heir of the Brewsters?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{begin to}} understand,' {{continued}} I. 'Her Highness the Princess' (I said {{this in a}} sarcastic way) 'will not be very angry, believe me, if you break off your connection with the stupid Countess. I am no more an admirer of that lady than you are; but I want her estate.

6000|$|... "We do," [...] said Mr. Flint, interrupting, [...] "the {{best and}} most honourable counsel we can find in the State. When necessary, they appear before the {{legislative}} committees. As a property holder in the State, and an admirer of its beauties, and as its well-wisher, it will give me great pleasure to look over <b>your</b> <b>bills,</b> and use whatever personal influence I may have as a citizen to forward them, should they meet my approval. And I am especially glad to do this as a neighbour, Mr. Crewe. As a neighbour," [...] he repeated, significantly.|$|E

"Not proper (IL NE FALLAIT PAS) to negotiate Bills of Exchange, and never produce a single diamond"--bit of peltry, or ware of any kind, {{you son of}} Amalek! [...] "Not proper to say: I have got money for <b>your</b> <b>bills</b> of exchange, and I bring you nothing back; and I will repay your money when you shall no longer be here [in Germany at all]. Not proper to promise at 35 louis, and then say 30. To say 30, and then next morning 25. You should at least have produced goods (IL FALLAIT EN DONNER) at the price current; very easy to do when one was on the spot. All your procedures have been faults hitherto. [Klein, v. 259.] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you like}} to order us a bottle of {{champagne}} and tell the waiter to put it on <b>your</b> <b>bill,</b> we shan't be offended," [...] Blanche declared. [...] "We were just wondering whether we could run to it." ...|$|R
