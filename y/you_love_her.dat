5|$|Returning home, JJ {{sees his}} mother, Cecilia (Juliet Cowan), {{overwhelmed}} {{by all of}} his issues and blames himself. He calls Cook {{to tell him how}} he feels, but Cook is preoccupied with having sex with a girl who JJ assumes is Effy. When he visits Effy, however, she reveals that she has not seen Cook in days. He asks her to leave Freddie and Cook alone; she refuses but offers to be his friend. JJ then visits Cook and discovers that he is having sex with their friend Pandora Moon (Lisa Backwell). Pretending not to have seen this, he then confronts Cook about ruining their friendship with Freddie and shouts at Cook for not caring about how he feels. Cook tells JJ that he loves him and brings JJ with him to buy drugs. They are almost arrested and, after running from the police, JJ pressures Cook into taking his prescription drugs instead before they meet their friends at a club. In the queue, Effy tells Naomi Campbell (Lily Loveless) that she knows about Naomi and Emily's relationship. Naomi reveals that she is unsure of her sexuality and realises that Effy is in love with Freddie, not Cook. JJ and Cook arrive and Thomas Tomone (Merveille Lukeba) lets them into the club where British electronica duo <b>You</b> <b>Love</b> <b>Her</b> Coz She's Dead are playing, announcing that Emily is already inside. Cook gets into a fight on the dancefloor and Freddie moves in to help when he discovers that JJ gave Cook his prescription drugs.|$|E
25|$|It {{is not my}} main {{ground of}} {{complaint}} that you have her, even though I loved her dearly; that she has you is my chief regret, a loss that touches me more closely. Loving offenders, I excuse you both thus: <b>you</b> <b>love</b> <b>her,</b> because you know I love her; similarly, she abuses me for my sake, in allowing my friend to have her. If I lose you, my loss is a gain to my love; and losing her, my friend picks up that loss. Both find each other, I lose both, and both lay this cross on me for my sake. But there is one consolation in this thought: my friend and I are one; therefore she loves me alone.|$|E
500|$|While Yellowcard {{was working}} on their {{upcoming}} album, Lights and Sounds, they developed a character, Holly Wood, {{who served as a}} narrator and protagonist for the album's storyline. The character also came about when the band began writing about their hatred for life in Los Angeles. Vocalist Ryan Key, in discussion of the character, said, [...] "Holly became this person on the record who appears {{in a lot of the}} songs, and at times <b>you</b> <b>love</b> <b>her</b> and at times you hate her. At times she's good to you and sometimes she's bad." [...] Violinist Sean Mackin, also in discussion of the character, said: [...] "...Ryan didn’t have a romantic interest in his life and he didn’t want to write 'Only One' again, and he wanted to create something new. A lot of songwriters narrate and create fictional characters... and Holly was a character where sometimes <b>you</b> <b>love</b> <b>her</b> and sometimes you hate her, and she was someone he could get all his emotions out through." [...] Key revealed that the song [...] "Rough Landing, Holly", which features the Holly character, was his [...] "favorite song" [...] from Lights and Sounds.|$|E
6000|$|... "Be merciful," [...] he said, [...] "do not {{say such}} words to me. I <b>loved</b> <b>her,</b> indeed I did, but Elizabeth {{was too much}} for me, and I am so poor. Oh, if <b>you</b> <b>loved</b> <b>her</b> also, be merciful! I do not reproach <b>you</b> because <b>you</b> <b>loved</b> <b>her,</b> {{although}} <b>you</b> had no right to <b>love</b> <b>her.</b> If <b>you</b> had not <b>loved</b> <b>her,</b> and made <b>her</b> <b>love</b> <b>you,</b> all this would never have happened. Why do you say such dreadful things to me, Mr. Bingham?" ...|$|R

500|$|... "Harvest Festival" [...] was {{the first}} episode of the season written and {{produced}} separately from the second season. The previous six episodes from the third season were filmed almost immediately after the second season ended {{as part of an}} early shooting schedule to accommodate Poehler's pregnancy. Series co-creator Michael Schur described it as a particularly empowering episode for the Leslie Knope character: [...] "When you see this episode [...] it makes <b>you</b> <b>love</b> <b>her</b> even more. This episode is about Leslie being noticed for the incredible hard work she does." [...] Schur also said he believed the subplot with April and Andy was one that several young people in their situation have faced in real life: [...] "Andy is put into a situation {{that a lot of people}} have been put into in our lives and he does the exact wrong thing you can do. And that's sort of the template for them going forward is what's the wrongest thing you can do? That's sort of how we follow them." [...] Chris Pratt said he believed the conflict provided strong romantic and comedic potential for the characters: [...] "There definitely will be conflict in their relationship [...] there's still a lot of room for comedy in there, because we have good writers." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Amor Puro" [...] (Pure Love) is {{in a minor}} key with romantic lyrics, {{a string}} {{ensemble}} and techno synthesizers. Its lyrics focus {{on the meaning of}} true love. Queen sings: [...] "Pure love does not fight, it does not hurt you, love that is pure does not cause you to fall", and described the song as [...] "an honest statement of what love is". [...] "I Do" [...] is a minor-key, mid-tempo pop and R power ballad built on a handclapped rhythm and piano. Lyrically, the song is a message to men and women; Queen sings: [...] "My ladies, if you know better, if he loves you, let him come back. My fellas, if <b>you</b> <b>love</b> <b>her,</b> don't let nothing hold you back, run out and look for her". Queen recorded the song in English because she felt the language worked well with the beat. According to an editor for iTunes, the song [...] "puts her message of female empowerment into a glossy pop ballad, complete with English lyrics and Auto-Tuned vocal." [...] The minor-key [...] "Acércate" [...] (Get Closer) features vocals by Wisin & Yandel and synthesizers; it has been described as [...] "pure reggaeton". The song was praised for the presence of Wisin & Yandel and its hook. Queen previously collaborated with Wisin & Yandel on their seventh studio album, La Revolución (2009), with [...] "Perfecto" [...] (which also featured Yaviah).|$|E
2500|$|On boxing: [...] "It's {{like being}} {{in love with a}} woman. She can be unfaithful, she can be mean, she can be cruel, but it doesn't matter. If <b>you</b> <b>love</b> <b>her,</b> you want her, even though she can do you all kinds of harm. It's the same with me and boxing. It can do me all kinds of harm but I love it." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yet, what, Lucy? I believe <b>you</b> <b>loved</b> {{my sister}} as affectionately as I did myself, but I am {{sensitive}} on this point; and, tender, true, warm as I know {{your heart to}} be, I cannot allow that even <b>you</b> <b>loved</b> <b>her</b> more." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Did I dream, Prince," [...] he said, [...] "or did my ears indeed {{hear you}} tell that idolatress that <b>you</b> <b>loved</b> <b>her</b> for ever, and did my eyes see you kiss {{her on the}} lips?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'I cannot {{understand}} why you deserted her at all,' said Hetta. 'You say <b>you</b> <b>loved</b> <b>her,</b> and <b>you</b> promised to marry her. It seems horrid to me to marry a divorced woman,--a woman who just says that she was divorced. But that is because I don't understand American ways. And I am sure <b>you</b> must have <b>loved</b> <b>her</b> when <b>you</b> {{took her to the}} theatre, and down to Lowestoft,--for her health. That was only a week ago.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{of course}} you would remember, because <b>you</b> <b>loved</b> <b>her,</b> did <b>you</b> not, and the boy too, and even me, the father.
