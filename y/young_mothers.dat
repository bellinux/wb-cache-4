25|$|Rohmer {{was born}} in Huttenheim, Alsace-Lorraine, part of the German Empire, to the farmer Albert Rohmer (1846–1912) and Marie-Elizabeth Metz (1850–1935).

However, selected trainees with extraneous circumstances can send a letter of appeal to be exempted from the training, which will usually be approved.|$|E

25|$|In 1955, Matsumoto {{abandoned}} manga altogether. Although {{he continued}} to do illustration work {{in a variety of}} styles, his focus shifted to the kind of hyper-stylized, wryly adorable character epitomized by the later Kurumi-chan. His target audience accordingly shifted from preteen and low-teen girls to toddlers and <b>young</b> <b>mothers.</b> In addition to illustrating new and original children's books, Matsumoto illustrated numerous classics, including Little Red Riding Hood (1955), Andrew Lang's Blue Fairy Book (1959, translated by Yasunari Kawabata), and various other collections of classic Japanese and European fairy tales.|$|E
25|$|Pregnant {{teenagers}} face many of {{the same}} issues of childbirth as women in their 20s and 30s. However, there are additional medical concerns for younger mothers, particularly those under 15 and those living in developing countries. For example, obstetric fistula is a particular issue for very <b>young</b> <b>mothers</b> in poorer regions. For mothers between 15 and 19, risks are associated more with socioeconomic factors than with the biological effects of age. However, research has shown that the risk of low birth weight is connected to the biological age itself, as it was observed in teen births even after controlling for other risk factors (such as utilisation of antenatal care etc.).|$|E
25|$|According to a US panel, {{attacks on}} Bahá'ís in Iran have {{increased}} since Mahmoud Ahmadinejad became president. In {{the ten years}} following the 1979 revolution, more than 200 Baha'is were killed or executed, hundreds more were tortured or imprisoned, {{and tens of thousands}} lost jobs, access to education, and other rights – all solely because of their religious belief. Since 2005, more than 710 Baha'is have been arrested, and the number of Baha'is in prison has risen from fewer than five to a current figure of 136; roughly 600 more are engaged with the penal system: awaiting trial, for example, or awaiting sentencing. The incarcerated now include <b>young</b> <b>mothers</b> of nursing children (imprisoned with their infants). Since the summer of 2013, escalation of attacks has included both murder and attempted murder. These attacks are believed to be hate crimes that are religiously motivated.|$|E

25|$|The {{first big}} city to aggressively promote {{the use of}} Norplant was Baltimore. Baltimore {{targeted}} teenagers because the birthrate was three times higher than other states. In Baltimore, about ten percent of girls between ages 15 and 17 gave birth during 1990. <b>Young</b> <b>mothers</b> would often {{drop out of school}} and struggle to raise the child in poverty. The mayor at the time, Kurt Schmoke, pushed for laws that would give teen girls more access to Norplant. Norplant was eventually given to teen girls at schools without parental consent. Programs were designed for, and performed in, predominantly black schools. Laurence G. Paquin Middle School became the first school to provide Norplant to their students. Paquin Middle School had 355 female students but only 5 of them were not black. Their program started off as a pilot program and soon other urban high schools like San Fernando High School in Los Angeles and Crane High School in Chicago’s West Side adopted the program of providing Norplant to their students. Because of a focus on predominantly black schools, questions of racism arose amongst black community leaders.|$|E

The latter alleviates iron deficiency anaemia, which {{interferes with the}} mental development of an estimated 40% of infants in the developing world. A typical iron source is ferrous fumarate. Another additive, especially important for pregnant women, is folic acid (vitamin B9), which gives the table salt a yellow color.

2500|$|In {{recent times}} {{adolescent}} mothers {{have become a}} target population for breastfeeding education. In industrialized {{regions of the world}} including Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia [...] and the United States, single, <b>young</b> <b>mothers,</b> under age 20, are less likely to initiate breastfeeding and more likely to have lower rates of breastfeeding duration. [...] Studies have found that social barriers to continuing breastfeeding are insufficiently recognized and addressed by healthcare professionals. [...] Studies suggest that one of the greatest barriers to improving breastfeeding rates among adolescent mothers are the expectations made by health care providers who assume young mother are too immature to breastfeed successfully. [...] Therefore, these <b>young</b> <b>mothers</b> receive even less education and support than adult mothers even though they need it most. Participants of the various studies reported that medical staff directed them towards the hospital's vast supply of formula milk instead of receiving lactation consultations even when they wished to breastfeed.|$|E
2500|$|Studies {{suggest that}} even when <b>young</b> <b>mothers</b> are {{informed}} about {{the health benefits of}} breastfeeding other social norms take precedence. [...] The potential social embarrassment was present in the minds of expecting adolescent mothers and a major factor that influenced their choice of feeding method. Adolescent mothers have also described conflicts between their wish to resume activities outside of the home in the post-natal period and the baby's need to be fed. [...] Public breastfeeding was seen as risking social disapproval, thus, discouraged from breastfeeding. [...] Some of the adolescent participants of these studies described how their fears become a reality when they were asked to stop breastfeeding in public areas.|$|E
2500|$|Music {{composer}} Ravi considered Asha one of {{his favorite}} singers. She sang for his first movie Vachan (1955). The melodious lullaby from the movie Chandamama Door Ke! became an overnight hit among <b>young</b> <b>mothers</b> in India. Ravi got her to sing bhajans for the movies Gharana, Grihasti, Kajal and Phool Aur Patthar, {{at a time when most}} of the composers remembered her only when they needed to record B-grade songs picturized on the vamps or the side-heroines. Ravi and Asha recorded a variety of songs, including the popular funny duet with Kishore Kumar– [...] "C A T...Cat. Cat Maane Billi" [...] (Dilli Ka Thug). The bhajan [...] "Tora Maan Darpan" [...] (Kajal) is considered one of Asha's best songs.|$|E

2500|$|When World War II broke out, the {{military}} once again called upon clinical psychologists. As soldiers began {{to return from}} combat, psychologists started to notice symptoms of psychological trauma labeled [...] "shell shock" [...] (eventually to be termed posttraumatic stress disorder) that were best treated as soon as possible. Because physicians (including psychiatrists) were over-extended in treating bodily injuries, psychologists were called to help treat this condition. At the same time, female psychologists (who {{were excluded from the}} war effort) formed the National Council of Women Psychologists with the purpose of helping communities deal with the stresses of war and giving <b>young</b> <b>mothers</b> advice on child rearing. After the war, the Veterans Administration in the U.S. made an enormous investment to set up programs to train doctoral-level clinical psychologists to help treat the thousands of veterans needing care. As a consequence, the U.S. went from having no formal university programs in clinical psychology in 1946 to over half of all Ph.D.s in psychology in 1950 being awarded in clinical psychology.|$|E
2500|$|The {{breastfeeding}} {{promotion and}} support of adolescent mothers {{must take into account}} the context of the individual and their cultural norms. [...] Few teenagers can withstand the cultural pressure which categorizes bottle feeding as a norm. Therefore, new teenage mothers need more concerted prenatal anticipatory guidance, specialized lactation education and an increase of face-to-face postpartum support. [...] To succeed with the task at hand, inpatient nursing care will have to be tailor to the unique needs of this population. [...] Positive perception of inpatient postpartum nursing care {{have been found to be}} an incredible influence in a young mother's success with breastfeeding. [...] In a study conducted in the United States, <b>young</b> <b>mothers</b> reported positive postpartum experiences, especially in respect to breastfeeding initiation and mother-infant bonding, when their nursing care was targeted for adolescent mothers. The mothers reported that they felt better cared for and more motivated to initiate and sustain breastfeeding when nurses where friendly, patient, respectful and understanding of their individual needs. [...] Maternal self-confidence is a contributing factor that influences positive breastfeeding outcomes especially among adolescent mothers. Empowerment, compassion, understanding and patience are key when caring for young moms.|$|E

Without that refreshment, I doubt if I should have been in a condition for 'the Refractories,' towards whom my quick little matron--for whose adaptation to her office I had by this time conceived a genuine respect--drew me next, and marshalled me the way that I was going.|$|E
