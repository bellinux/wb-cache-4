Yuhas has been berated by gay advocacy groups for saying things like that and even had to fend off a formal Federal Communications Commission (FCC) complaint for using alleged homophobic slurs over the public airwaves. The latter complaint was because Yuhas has a sometimes-segment on his program called the [...] "Extraordinary Gay Update" [...] where he urges gay people not to use words that [...] "we demand others purge from their vocabulary" [...] as we use the words about ourselves.|$|E
