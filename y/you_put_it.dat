[...] Producer/co-writer Tom DeSanto had been supportive of using the blue and yellow color scheme of the comics, but came to conclude that they would not work onscreen. To acknowledge the fan complaints, Singer added Cyclops' line [...] "What would you prefer, yellow spandex?" [...] – when Wolverine complains about wearing their uniforms – during filming. Singer noted that durable black leather made more sense for the X-Men to wear as protective clothing, and Shuler Donner added that the costumes helped them [...] "blend into the night".|$|E
500|$|The GameCube {{version of}} Mario Power Tennis enjoyed a {{generally}} positive reception, with reviewers complimenting {{the variety of}} play and multiple minigames available. GameSpy's Raymond Padilla lauded the game's use of characters and the player categories, stating [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> all together, you have a broad cast of characters, each of whom offers a different feel." [...] Despite this, the Gimmick courts were labeled by Matt Casamassina as a [...] "distraction" [...] and [...] "annoyance", although he acknowledged that some courts were better than others. Additionally, Nintendo World Report's Michael Cole thought that most players would revert to standard courts [...] "after being 'unfairly defeated' by ghosts, paint, or some other trap." [...] Eurogamer's Tom Bramwell welcomed Power Tenniss style, which he said emphasised gameplay over simulation and realism. When comparing the game to its predecessor, reviewers praised Power Tennis for its incorporation of the Mario franchise in the different scenarios and courts.|$|E

[...] The lyrical content, {{according}} to Ocean, relates to heartbreak and other familiar tropes of interpersonal relationships: [...] "I wasn't {{trying to make a}} record that people could relate to. I was just trying to make a record with the shit that I wanted to express. The shit that I wanted to get off my chest. [...] A lot of this record is influenced by one relationship, but I don't owe that whole project to one situation. It doesn't matter what the details of it are." [...] Discussing the writing process behind the album, he mused that he was just inspired to tell stories. He continued, [...] "you gotta make sure the listener is listening to you, so if <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> into a song, often times, if the song is striking enough, then you can really deliver the story most effectively while keeping the ear of the listener the whole time.

In this album, I was screaming in a room — just like I was screaming in the song — I was screaming in a room with all my girlfriends, yelling all the shit we really say." [...] Rebecca Thomas of MTV News wrote: [...] "A platinum-blond Keri gyrates, thrusts, licks and gets (way) low as she laces the song with enough saucy language and expletives to make your favorite rapper blush." [...] while Jocelyn Vena the same news division of MTV commented that even though there are several cameo appearances in the mini-move, it is ultimately Hilson's [...] "scantily clad popping and locking that has everyone buzzing."

Mikael Wood of Billboard gave the song a {{positive}} review, stating that it [...] "has a juicy and instantly memorable vocal hook". In {{a review of}} the album, Robert Copsey of Digital Spy coined the song [...] "electro-thumping", commenting that it was [...] "as innocent as the purity ring on Gomez's finger and showcases her polished vocals perfectly." [...] Copsey also stated that the impressive hooks present in the song do not appear on the album anywhere else. In a single review, Nick Levine also of Digital Spy said was the most Disney-affiliated single with club appeal since Miley Cyrus' [...] "See You Again". When commenting on whether Gomez would be a mainstay in music, Levine said, [...] "It's too soon to tell - but most Scando-popettes would dye their locks brunette for this tune."

500|$|Another {{possible}} lover was Bill Duckett. As a teenager, {{he lived}} on the same street in Camden and moved in with Whitman, living with him {{a number of years}} and serving him in various roles. Duckett was 15 when Whitman bought his house at 328 Mickle Street. From at least 1880, Duckett and his grandmother, Lydia Watson, were boarders, subletting space from another family at 334 Mickle Street. Because of this proximity, it is obvious that Duckett and Whitman met as neighbors. Their relationship was close, with the youth sharing Whitman's money when he had it. Whitman described their friendship as [...] "thick". Though some biographers describe him as a boarder, others identify him as a lover. Their photograph [...] is described as [...] "modeled on the conventions of a marriage portrait", part of a series of portraits of the poet with his young male friends, and encrypting male–male desire. Yet another intense relationship of Whitman with a young man was the one with Harry Stafford, with whose family Whitman stayed when at Timber Creek, and whom he first met when Stafford was 18, in 1876. Whitman gave Stafford a ring, which was returned and re-given {{over the course of a}} stormy relationship lasting several years. Of that ring, Stafford wrote to Whitman, [...] "You know when <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> on there was but one thing to part it from me, and that was death." ...|$|E
500|$|Shakira and Amanda Ghost, the {{executive}} {{producers of the}} album, enlisted {{a diverse group of}} producers to collaborate on the tracks, such as Pharrell Williams, one half of the record production duo The Neptunes, who co-wrote four of the tracks on the album with Shakira. Other collaborators included John Hill, Sam Endicott, and Timbaland. Shakira later said that her collaboration with Williams helped her learn a lot, noting [...] "When collaborating you always try and capture something from the other person and I learnt a lot from his method". The singer revealed that the two readied four tracks in five days, and commented that [...] "What was interesting is that he's very fast and immediate in the studio and I'm a little slower". Endicott, musician and lead singer of American post-punk band The Bravery, was personally called by Shakira to co-compose the title track of the album along with Hill. He explained how they both began working with the single, saying she [...] "contacted him , asking if he had any stuff. We never had her in mind. We just made the thing independently of her, and then she liked it a lot, and she sang over it. She used some of the melodies we put in there and then wrote these crazy lyrics about being a werewolf. And that's how it happened". Haitian-American rapper Wyclef Jean, who previously appeared as a featured artist on [...] "Hips Don't Lie" [...] with Shakira, talked about his chemistry with her, saying [...] "I have a natural chemistry with Shakira. I love the Latin vibe. The Lebanese vibe. I love the multicultural aspect of the CD. These days it's hard for you to pick up a CD and love it from beginning to end.
