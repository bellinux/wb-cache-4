When an opponent strikes at you and your sword pierces his stomach it is setsuninken. These two concepts are the essence of the sword.|$|E

500|$|Butler {{announced}} on 6 March 1963 {{that he was}} going to convene a conference to decide the Federation's future. It would be impossible (or at least very difficult) for Britain to dissolve the union without Southern Rhodesia's co-operation as the latter, being self-governing, had been co-signatory to the Federal agreement in 1953. According to Smith, Field, Dupont and other RF politicians, Butler made several oral independence guarantees to ensure Southern Rhodesia's attendance and support at the conference, but repeatedly refused to give anything on paper. Field and Smith claimed that Butler justified this to them the day before the conference began by saying that binding Whitehall to a document rather than his word would be against the Commonwealth's [...] "spirit of trust"—an argument that Field eventually accepted. [...] "Let's remember the trust you emphasised," [...] Smith warned, according to Field's account wagging his finger at Butler; [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>break</b> that you will live to regret it." [...] No minutes were made of this meeting. Butler denied afterwards that he had ever made such a promise. Southern Rhodesia attended the conference, held at the Victoria Falls Hotel over a week starting from 28 June 1963, and among other things it was agreed to formally liquidate the Federation at the end of 1963.|$|E
500|$|As Southern Rhodesia {{had been}} the UK's {{legislative}} partner in forming the Federation in 1953, {{it would be impossible}} (or at least very difficult) for Britain to dissolve the union without Southern Rhodesia's co-operation.

500|$|Jenijoy La Belle assesses Lady Macbeth's {{femininity}} {{and sexuality}} {{as they relate}} to motherhood as well as witchhood. The fact that she conjures spirits likens her to a witch, and the act itself establishes a similarity in the way that both Lady Macbeth and the Weird Sisters from the play [...] "use the metaphoric powers of language to call upon spiritual powers who in turn will influence physical events — in one case the workings of the state, in the other the workings of a woman's body." [...] Like the witches, Lady Macbeth strives to make herself an instrument for bringing about the future She proves herself a defiant, empowered nonconformist, and an explicit threat to a patriarchal system of governance in that, through challenging his masculinity, she manipulates Macbeth into murdering King Duncan. Despite the fact that she calls him a coward, Macbeth remains reluctant, until she asks: [...] "What beast wasn't, then, that made <b>you</b> <b>break</b> this enterprise to me? / When you durst do it, then you were a man; / And to be more than what you were, you would / Be so much more the man." [...] Thus Lady Macbeth enforces a masculine conception of power, yet only after pleading to be unsexed, or defeminised. The Weird Sisters are also depicted as defeminised, androgynous figures. They are bearded (1.3.46), (which may also be associated with Lady Macbeth's amenorrhea). Witches were perceived as an extreme type of anti-mother, even considered capable of cooking and eating their own children. Although Lady Macbeth may not express violence toward her child with that same degree of grotesqueness, she certainly expresses a sense of brutality when she states that she would smash the baby's head.|$|E
