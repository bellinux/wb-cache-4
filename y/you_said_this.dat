6000|$|... "Well, there's Nell-- And <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>this</b> Gale {{was a young}} American. My {{wife will}} be scared to death for fear Nell will {{fall in love with}} him." ...|$|E
6000|$|MRS. HOPE. Well, if I'd thought you'd have {{forgotten}} what <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>this</b> morning and turned about like this, d'you suppose I'd {{have spoken to}} you at all? Now, do you? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'I didn't {{want to do}} my talkin' out front,' said she, 'for {{there might}} be people passin' along the road. I think <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>this</b> {{was to be a}} case of blackgum ag'in' thunder!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Did Mr. Jenkins--I think <b>you</b> <b>said</b> that <b>this</b> gentleman's name is Jenkins?--see {{the agent}} engaged {{in making this}} corner in pearls, or learn his name?' asked Bude.|$|R
6000|$|... "May I ask," [...] said I, [...] "what {{you meant}} when <b>you</b> <b>said</b> that <b>this</b> matter of {{suggestion}} is {{only at the}} fringe of it? What do you consider the essential?" ...|$|R
6000|$|But {{at last he}} said to Pelias, ‘Why do {{you look}} so sad, my uncle? And {{what did you mean}} just now when <b>you</b> <b>said</b> that <b>this</b> was a doleful kingdom, and its ruler a miserable man?’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How is that? Why can't he? <b>You</b> <b>said</b> <b>this</b> Blome was {{a killer}} of men. You spoke of notches on his gun. I've heard {{my father and}} my cousin, too, speak of Blome's record. He must be a terrible ruffian. If his intent is evil, why will he fail in it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was for {{you that}} I called," [...] the woman said. [...] "By what <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>this</b> morning I judged you would be {{returning}} about this hour, {{and it was in}} hopes you might hear me that I cried out, for I knew well that no one else would be likely to be within earshot." ...|$|E
6000|$|Messner {{shrugged his}} shoulders. [...] "If you do, I'll call a miners' meeting {{and see you}} strung up to the nearest tree. As <b>you</b> <b>said,</b> <b>this</b> is not California. They're a simple folk, these miners, and all I'll have to do will be to show them the marks of the beating, {{tell them the truth}} about you, and present my claim for my wife." ...|$|E
60|$|Second Objection. But {{notwithstanding}} what <b>you</b> have <b>said,</b> <b>this</b> sin is {{a deadly}} stick in my way; {{it will not}} out of my mind, my cause being bad, but Christ will desert me.|$|R
6000|$|... "If any but <b>thee</b> hadst <b>said</b> <b>this</b> slander of me, girl, {{it would}} go nigh to raise hot speech between us! Thy brother, Reuben Ring, knows better than to stir my temper, by such falsity of accusation." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Failing that, sir," [...] the {{professor}} declared, [...] "my point is, as I explained before, that Beatrice should give {{up one of}} her songs. What <b>you</b> have <b>said</b> <b>this</b> evening more than ever confirms me in my view." ...|$|R
6000|$|Miss Mary. Enough! (Taking flower {{from her}} bosom.) Here, I give you back the flower {{you gave me}} this morning. It has faded and died here upon my breast. But I shall replace it with your foundling,--the child of that woman, born like that flower in the snow! And I go now, Sandy, and leave behind me, as <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>this</b> morning, the snow and rocks in which it bloomed. Good-by! Farewell, farewell--forever! (Goes toward schoolhouse as--) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{heard what}} you were saying just now, Sir Gilbert," [...] she murmured low, but with marked emphasis, after a few polite commonplaces of {{conversation}} had first passed between them; [...] "and I want to ask you one question only about the matter. ARE you so sure as you seem of what <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>this</b> minute? Are you so sure that Mr. Guy Waring HAD sufficient reasons of his own for wishing to leave the country?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well,' {{said the}} Chevalier, 'we must begin without loss of time. My son has brought down {{a set of}} fellows here, who are trained to ferret out heretics. Not a runaway weasel cold escape them! We will set them on as soon as ever they have taken a bit of supper up there at the Chateau; and do {{you come up with}} us just to show them the way across to Leonard's. That's no {{unlikely}} place for her to lurk in, as <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>this</b> morning, good fellow.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Poor Peggotty {{lifted up}} her hands and eyes, and only answered, {{in a sort of}} {{paraphrase}} of the grace I usually repeated after dinner, 'Lord forgive you, Mrs. Copperfield, and for what <b>you</b> have <b>said</b> <b>this</b> minute, may <b>you</b> never be truly sorry!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'How are <b>you,</b> Faguey?' <b>said</b> <b>this</b> worthy, {{nodding to}} the Jew. 'Pop that shawl away in my castor, Dodger, so that I may {{know where to}} find it when I cut; that's the time of day! You'll be a fine young cracksman afore the old file now.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>you</b> <b>said</b> {{nothing of}} <b>this</b> before, Senor Cranch," [...] said he, {{with a gesture}} of indignation, turning his back quite upon Cranch, and taking a step towards the refectory.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{really do}} not think that there will be any great danger, sir. If there were no great object to be gained, it would be different; but in view of the great importance, as <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>this</b> evening, of {{learning}} Mahmud's intentions, the risk of one life being lost, even were it great, is nothing. As you say, the Sirdar's plans might be greatly affected by the course Mahmud adopts; and in such a case, the life of a subaltern like myself is a matter scarcely to be considered.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{fail to see}} {{any reason}} why you should in every case act as {{messenger}} 'twixt here and Cambridge. Send some other of your company. It is true we lost the boat in which you and I came, because of having left her where any blundering lobster back might stumble upon the craft; but <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>this</b> morning {{that it would be}} possible for us to get two small skiffs at any time." [...] Then he asked abruptly, [...] "How high from the street is the window of the room where your comrade is held prisoner?" ...|$|E
60|$|But, Sir, where learned {{you this}} new doctrine, as to reckon coming to God by Christ, {{a thing of}} so {{indifferent}} a nature, a thing not good in itself, but with respect to certain circumstances. Had <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>this</b> of baptism and the Supper of the Lord, I could with some allowance have borne your words, but to count coming to God by Christ a thing indifferent in itself, is a blasphemy {{that may not be}} borne by Christians, it being too high a contempt of the blood, and too great a disgrace to the person of the Lord, the king of glory; of which more hereafter, but to return.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It's new to <b>you,</b> I believe?' <b>said</b> <b>this</b> Gowan, when Arthur had extolled the place. 'Quite new. I made {{acquaintance}} with it only yesterday afternoon.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, to {{tell the}} truth, when I got inside I felt as if I didn't care much about it. The place {{depressed}} me {{almost as much as}} it did you--it was ugly. And then I thought of what <b>you</b> had <b>said</b> <b>this</b> morning as to whether we ought." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And now I {{beg your}} pardon, sir," [...] said the narrator, {{addressing}} the Shipwreck Clerk, [...] "but I forgot that <b>you</b> <b>said</b> you'd finish <b>this</b> story yourself. Perhaps you'd {{like to take}} it up just here?" ...|$|R
60|$|If that be true I {{wish you}} then {{to note the}} next fact: that within the space of five years Senator Douglas, in the {{argument}} of this question, has got his entire party, so far as I know, without exception, in saying that the negro has no share in the Declaration of Independence. If there be now in all these United States one Douglas man that does not say this, I have been unable upon any occasion to scare him up. Now, if none of <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>this</b> five years ago, and all of you say it now, that is a matter that you Kentuckians ought to note. That is a vast change in the Northern public sentiment upon that question.|$|E
6000|$|... "MADAME PRATOLUNGO,--You have distressed and pained me {{more than}} I can say. There are faults, and serious ones, on my side, I know. I heartily beg your pardon for {{anything}} that I may have said or done to offend you. I cannot submit to your hard verdict on me. If you knew how I adore Lucilla, you would make allowances for me--you would understand me better than you do. I cannot get your last cruel words out of my ears. I cannot meet you again without some explanation of them. You stabbed me to the heart, when <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>this</b> evening {{that it would be}} a happier prospect for Lucilla if she had been going to marry my brother instead of marrying me. I hope you did not really mean that? Will you please write and tell me whether you did or not? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I {{particularly}} wish {{to speak}} about what <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>this</b> morning. I could not possibly go back to those East-End sketches of life--even {{the name of the}} paper I wrote them for is so painfully associated in my mind with all that Merton and I went through. I was struggling so hard--oh, so hard to keep our heads above water, and seemed to be succeeding. I was so hopeful that better days were in store for us, and the end seemed to come so suddenly ... and my striving had been in vain ... and the fight was lost. I know that I must rouse myself, that I have to work for a living, only just now I seem to have lost all desire to do anything, all energy. But I know, Fan, that this will not last. Grief for the dead does not endure long--never long enough. I must work, and there is nothing I shall ever care to do for a living except literary work. I have felt and shall feel again that a garret for shelter and dry bread for food would be dearer to me earned in that way than every comfort and luxury got by any other means. During the last day or two, while I have been sitting by myself, an idea has slowly been taking shape in my mind, which will make a fairly good story, I think, if properly worked out. But that will take time, and just now I could not put pen to paper, even to save myself from starving. For a little longer, dear, I must be contented to live on your charity." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{agree with}} you entirely, James. It would be impossible; only I do wish <b>you</b> had <b>said</b> all <b>this</b> before letting me be so foolish {{as to say that}} I thought we ought to take it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{a strange}} faith," [...] said Aziel, [...] "which teaches that the Lord of Heaven can find a home in mortal breasts. But, lady, it is yours, so of it I say no more. Now tell me, if you will, {{what did you mean}} when <b>you</b> <b>said</b> that <b>this</b> barbarian king, Ithobal, set the savage whom I slew to kidnap you? Do you know this, or do you suspect it only?" ...|$|R
60|$|And when <b>you</b> have <b>said</b> all <b>this,</b> ladies, and more,--for {{more will}} suggest itself to your woman's wit,--say {{to them with}} St Paul--"And yet show we unto you a more {{excellent}} way,"--a nobler argument--and that is Charity.|$|R
6000|$|... “I {{have seen}} this letter in which you tell me {{there is so much}} [...] galimatias, and I assure you that I have not found any at all. On [...] the contrary, I find {{everything}} very plainly expressed, and among [...] others, one which is too explicit for my satisfaction—namely, what [...] you have said to Madame de Rambouillet, that if you tried to imagine [...] a perfectly happy life for yourself, it would be to pass it all alone [...] with Mademoiselle de Rambouillet. You know whether any one can be [...] more persuaded than I am of her merit; but I confess to you that that [...] has not prevented me from being surprised that you could entertain a [...] thought which did so great an injury to our friendship. As to [...] believing that <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>this</b> to one, and wrote it to the other, [...] simply for the sake of paying them an agreeable compliment, I have [...] too high an esteem for your courage to be able to imagine that [...] complaisance would cause you thus to betray the sentiments of your [...] heart, especially on a subject in which, as they were unfavorable to [...] me, I think you would have the more reason for concealing them, the [...] affection which I have for you being so well known to every one, and [...] especially to Mademoiselle de Rambouillet, so that I doubt whether [...] she will not have been more sensible of the wrong you have done me, [...] than of the advantage you have given her. The circumstance of this [...] letter falling into my hands has forcibly reminded me of these lines [...] of Bertaut: ...|$|E
5000|$|Jim Jarmusch {{recalls the}} {{shooting}} process thus: [...] Tom was exhausted. We had just shot a video {{the day before}} for [...] "I Don't Wanna Grow Up" [...] {{and he had been}} doing a lot of press. He was kind of in a surly mood as he is sometimes, but he's also very warm. He came in late that morning - I had given him the script the night before - and I was with Iggy. Tom threw the script down on the table and said, [...] "Well, you know, <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>this</b> was going to be funny, Jim. Maybe you better just circle the jokes 'cause I don't see them". He looked at poor Iggy and said, [...] "What do you think Iggy?" [...] Iggy said, [...] "I think I'm gonna go get some coffee and let you guys talk." [...] So I calmed Tom down. I knew it was just early in the morning and Tom was in a bad mood. His attitude changed completely, but I wanted him to keep some of that paranoid surliness in the script. We worked with that and kept it in his character. If he had been in a really good mood, I don't think the film would have been as funny." ...|$|E
5000|$|In July 2009 Wire {{said that}} the band's {{forthcoming}} album would [...] "be heavy metal Tamla Motown. Van Halen playing The Supremes! I know there's a lot of creativity in us and obviously because I didn't write lyrics on the last record I've got tons of words done." [...] Manics biographer Simon Price reacted to Nicky's announcement with amusement: 'Heavy metal Motown? I’ll believe it when I hear it. That Nicky Wire certainly can talk a good game. The thing is with those three lads is they'll sit around before writing any songs {{and come up with}} all these wildly juxtaposing ideas and styles, all of which sound great in theory, but when they actually start working towards them it always comes across sounding very much like a Manics record ... I remember just before the Lifeblood album came out in 2004 Nicky had been telling me it was going to sound like Goldfrapp-meets-late ’70s era David Bowie. And I could see what he meant, but when I actually heard it just reminded me of a more subdued version of their other stuff. In a good way though. A lot of the time Nicky goes public with these bold statements and then it comes down to it, it's up to James to try and back them up. That's {{a lot of pressure to}} put one person under and sometimes I’m positive James is at home half the time going [...] "Oh no, what have <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>this</b> time?". ' ...|$|E
60|$|VOICES--[Mockingly.] The Zoo? That's a {{new name}} for this coop--a damn good name! Steel, eh? <b>You</b> <b>said</b> a mouthful. <b>This</b> is the old iron house. Who is that boob talkin'? He's the bloke they brung in out of his head. The bulls had beat him up fierce.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thanks, reverend Father," [...] {{returned}} Richard, [...] "but I am but a landless page, and the Prince mounts me. <b>Said</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> {{poor man}} had been wounded in the late wars?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{spoke of}} his visit to you," [...] Brooks went on [...] "in Canada, and he twice reiterated {{the fact that there}} was no other {{dwelling}} within fifty miles of <b>you.</b> He <b>said</b> <b>this</b> upon his own authority, and upon the authority of his Indian guide. Now it is only a few days ago since you spoke of my father as living for years within a few miles of you." ...|$|R
