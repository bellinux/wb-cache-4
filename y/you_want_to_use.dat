Looping is known as melodic or percussive sequence that repeats itself {{over a period of}} time, so basically a producer will make an even-number of bars of a beat (e.g., four bars or eight bars) repeat itself or [...] "loop" [...] of a full song length. This loop provides an accompaniment for an MC to rap over.|$|E
2500|$|When Ice Cube, {{a father}} of four, was asked in January 2005 on NPR by Fresh Air's Terry Gross whether he allowed his {{children}} {{to listen to his}} music, he responded: [...] "What's worked for me is instilling in my kids a level of self-respect", and helping them to understand the content of not just music but the violence found on the evening news. When asked what he tells his children about profanity, he recalled telling his kids that there are [...] "appropriate times to use any kind of language. ...

60|$|But Sherman and Van Vliet know {{everything}} concerning Grant; {{and if you}} tell them how <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the facts, both of them will testify. Regular army men have no concealments about each other; and yet they make their awful statements without shade or color or malice with a frankness and a child-like naivety, indeed, which is enchanting-and stupefying. West Point seems to teach them that, among other priceless things not to be got in any other college in this world. If we talked about our guild-mates as I have heard Sherman, Grant, Van Vliet and others talk about theirs--mates with whom {{they were on the}} best possible terms--we could never expect them to speak to us again.|$|E

You know that greasy fellow who has been dunning you so of late. Well, be at rest there; he's paid. I was suddenly made flush yesterday:--regular flood-tide. You can return it any day, you know--no hurry; that's all.--But, by the way,--as you look as though {{you were going to}} have company here--just send for me in case <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> me--any bedstead to put up, or heavy things to be lifted about.

[...] Having seen, they would have added: [...] "You will alter those conditions, and treat your native labour humanely, or we will ban your use of this article," [...] to the grief and anger of those periwig-pated persons who write to the papers about grandmotherly legislation and sickly sentimentalism.|$|E
40|$|Suppose you ran a chess tournament, {{everybody}} played everybody, and <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> {{the results}} <b>to</b> rank everybody. Unless {{you were really}} lucky, the results would not be acyclic, so you could not just sort the players by who beat whom. A natural objective {{is to find a}} ranking that minimizes the number of upsets, where an upset is a pair of players where the player ranked lower on the ranking beats the player ranked higher. This is the NP-hard minimum feedback arc set (FAS) problem on tournaments. Our main result is a polynomial time approximation scheme (PTAS) for this problem. A simple weighted generalization gives a PTAS for Kemeny-Young rank aggregation...|$|R

6000|$|That is {{what happens}} when <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the {{telephone}} from your end. But that is not the worst that the telephone can do. A sensible man, after a little experience, can learn to leave the thing alone. Your worst troubles are not of your own making. You are working against time; you have given instructions not to be disturbed. Perhaps it is after lunch, and you are thinking with your eyes closed, so that your thoughts shall not be distracted by the objects about the room. In either case you are anxious not to leave your chair, when off goes that telephone bell and you spring from your chair, uncertain, for the moment, whether you have been shot, or blown up with dynamite. It occurs to you in your weakness that if you persist in taking no notice, they will get tired, and leave you alone. But that is not their method. The bell rings violently at ten-second intervals. You have nothing to wrap your head up in. You think it will be better to get this business over and done with. You go to your fate and call back savagely-- ...|$|E

[...] "Well, then, {{the fellow}} set down and told me, 'You've got a paint here,' says he, 'that's {{going to drive}} every other mineral paint out of the market. Why' says he, 'it'll drive 'em right into the Back Bay!' Of course, I didn't know what the Back Bay was then, but I begun to open my eyes; thought I'd had 'em open before, but I guess I hadn't. Says he, 'That paint has got {{hydraulic}} cement in it, and it can stand fire and water and acids;' he named over a lot of things. Says he, 'It'll mix easily with linseed oil, whether <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> it boiled or raw; and it ain't a-going to crack nor fade any; and it ain't a-going to scale. When you've got your arrangements for burning it properly, you're {{going to have a}} paint that will stand like the everlasting hills, in every climate under the sun.' Then he went into a lot of particulars, and I begun to think he was drawing a long-bow, and meant to make his bill accordingly. So I kept pretty cool; but the fellow's bill didn't amount to anything hardly--said I might pay him after I got going; young chap, and pretty easy; but every word he said was gospel. Well, I ain't a-going to brag up my paint; I don't suppose you came here to hear me blow." ...|$|E
