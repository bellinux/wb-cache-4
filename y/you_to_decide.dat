500|$|Owing to the {{combination}} of Pink Floyd's partial breakup and Waters' dominance on the project, The Final Cut is sometimes viewed as a de facto Waters solo album. [...] The personal quality assigned to the lyrics are related to Waters' struggle to reconcile his despair at the changing social face of Britain, and also {{the loss of his}} father during the Second World War. [...] Gilmour's guitar solos on [...] "Your Possible Pasts" [...] and [...] "The Fletcher Memorial Home" [...] are, however, sometimes considered the equal of his best work on The Wall. [...] More recent reviews of the album have weighed its importance alongside the band's breakup. [...] Writing for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine said [...] "with its anger, emphasis on lyrics, and sonic textures, it's clear that it's the album that Waters intended it to be. [...] And it's equally clear that Pink Floyd couldn't have continued in this direction...", [...] Stylus Magazine wrote: [...] "It's about pursuing something greater even when you have all the money that you could ever want. [...] And either failing or succeeding brilliantly. [...] It's up to <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> whether this record is a success or a failure, but I'd go with the former every time." [...] Rachel Mann of The Quietus said [...] "flawed though it is, The Final Cut remains a tremendous album" [...] and [...] "still has something fresh to say". [...] Mike Diver of Drowned in Sound was less generous: [...] "Rays of light are few and far between, and even on paper the track titles – including 'The Gunner's Dream' and 'Paranoid Eyes' – suggest an arduous listen. [...] Q Magazine once compiled a top ten list of depressing records, and this was on it. [...] Enough said, I think." ...|$|E

Su Fei was aware of Gan Ning's intention, so he invited him for drinks and said, [...] "I {{recommended}} you to Huang Zu many times, but he doesn't {{want to give you}} important responsibilities. Days pass by and people become older. You should make plans for the future and find someone who truly appreciates your talents." [...] Gan Ning paused for a moment before replying, [...] "That's what I've in mind, but I can't find an excuse to leave." [...] Su Fei then said, [...] "I'll suggest to Huang Zu to appoint you as the Chief (長) of Zhu County (邾縣; northwest of present-day Huanggang, Hubei). The initial phase is difficult, but after you reach it, it'll be much easier for <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> where to go from there." [...] Gan Ning replied, [...] "Great." [...] Huang Zu approved Su Fei's suggestion. Gan Ning managed to gather a few hundred men who were willing to follow him, and they headed towards Zhu.|$|E

40|$|Imagine, as one {{may well}} imagine {{at this time}} of the day, a {{chocolate}} mousse, dark and delectable, or a tempting tiramasu or a perfect pavlova. How are <b>you</b> going <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> which is best? Yes, indeed the actual presentation of the puddings may influence your choice, but to be able to make an informed choice, <b>you</b> would need <b>to</b> taste them.

Proof in the art of cooking, science, and also in law depends on the quantum and quality of evidence or data sufficient to support a conclusion.
