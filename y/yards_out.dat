60|$|Kurt {{led them}} through the <b>yard,</b> <b>out</b> past the old barn, {{to the edge of}} the open slope where the wheat {{stretched}} away, down and up, as far as the eye could see.|$|R
5|$|Banks {{made what}} he {{believed}} to be three of the best saves {{of his career in}} a Stoke shirt. In the first instance he saved and caught a powerful and well-placed header from Manchester City's Wyn Davies from just eight yards out; in the second case he saved a Francis Lee header at Maine Road; and he made his third great save for the club by catching a volley from Tottenham Hotspur's Alan Gilzean that had been hit from just six <b>yards</b> <b>out</b> at White Hart Lane.|$|E
5|$|Barrett {{made his}} first {{appearance}} of 2010–11 in the second match, starting in a 0–0 draw away to Grimsby Town on 17 August 2010.

5|$|In the 37th minute, Bahr took a {{long shot}} from twenty-five <b>yards</b> <b>out,</b> but as Williams moved to his right to intercept, Gaetjens dived headlong near the penalty spot, and grazed the ball enough to {{put it to the}} left of the English goalkeeper, whose {{momentum}} prevented him from changing direction, and into the back of the net. The crowd exploded as the U.S. improbably led 1–0. As the half drew to a close, Finney had a chance to equalize, but the whistle blew before he could shoot.|$|E
50|$|Early in {{the fourth}} quarter, Ferguson scored from one <b>yard</b> <b>out</b> to give the Seminoles a 17-point cushion. The Cowboys added a late {{touchdown}} on a 31-yard pass from Williams to Hart Lee Dykes.|$|R

Captain Flowers once made a drop kick from 44 <b>yards</b> <b>out.</b> Ferst came in for Flowers {{in the middle of}} the second quarter when Georgia Tech started to use substitutes.|$|E
5|$|United {{were denied}} victory by Bayern Munich twice, home and away. In Munich, the home side {{equalised}} with {{two minutes to}} go with United leading 2–1, after Schmeichel uncharacteristically went for and missed Bixente Lizarazu's throw-in, allowing Giovane Élber to tap in from a few <b>yards</b> <b>out</b> and score his second of the match. The return leg ended in a stalemate; Roy Keane scored just before half-time via a low header before Hasan Salihamidžić equalised for the visitors.|$|E
6000|$|He {{gathered}} the half-frightened, half-trusting boy {{into his arms}} for a moment, then, hand in hand, they fled across the <b>yard,</b> <b>out</b> of the gate, and down the street. They heard the kitchen door open, and the last they heard was: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Did you do that? What {{did you do}} it for? What's {{the sense}} of it? How do you suppose you can ever make {{yourself}} popular if you go about touching people on the shoulder? My nerves are sticking a <b>yard</b> <b>out</b> of my body this morning, Reggie!" ...|$|R
50|$|In {{the game}} against Watford, it took time for both teams' offenses {{to settle into}} the game, with all the points coming in the fourth quarter. Raiders took the lead when they ran the ball home from just a <b>yard</b> <b>out</b> after a 66-yard drive down the pitch.|$|R
5|$|Alabama {{extended}} their lead to 10–0 after Shelley connected on a 24-yard field goal {{early in the}} third quarter. Early in the fourth, Trent Richardson scored on a two-yard run for a 17–0 Crimson Tide lead. However, on the ensuing kickoff was returned 68-yards to the Alabama 22-yard line by John Fulton, and four plays later the Bulldogs cut the score to 17–7 after Tyler Russell threw a 12-yard touchdown pass to Chris Smith. The Crimson Tide then closed the game with an eleven-play, 73-yard drive, all on the ground, with Lacy scoring his second touchdown of the night from 32 <b>yards</b> <b>out</b> to give Alabama the 24–7 victory. The 127 rushing yards gained by Richardson was his seventh 100-yard rushing game of the season. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against the Bulldogs to 74–18–3 (76–17–3 without NCAA vacations and forfeits).|$|E
5|$|Alabama {{played their}} first home conference game in their annual rivalry game, against the Ole Miss Rebels at Tuscaloosa. In the game, 21 second quarter points after the Rebels' briefly held a lead {{resulted}} in the 33–14 Crimson Tide victory. After each team traded punts on their first possessions, Jeremy Shelley connected {{on the first of}} four field goals from 38 <b>yards</b> <b>out</b> to give the Crimson Tide an early 3–0 lead. After Shelley made his second 38-yard field goal to extend the Alabama lead to 6–0, Ole Miss responded with a 13-play, 75-yard drive that culminated with a one-yard Jeff Scott touchdown run that gave the Rebels a 7–6 lead early in the second quarter. At the time the Rebels' took the lead, it marked the first time Alabama trailed in regulation since their 2011 game against Tennessee.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Channon reached the two platoons, they were {{crossing}} over two small hills {{just north of}} Kantongyon. As they crossed {{over one of the}} hills, Channon and his radio operator were wounded by Chinese mortar rounds. Channon took the radio from Walker, who was now incapacitated, and joined the two platoons {{at the bottom of the}} hill. Channon then called Jess Tidwell for instructions, who responded, “move out when the tanks move out.” Two tanks had passed through a gap in the hills and were in front of them. Soon, the two tanks moved out at high speed to join their company in the center of the valley. As the Rangers started to move forward, toward the nose of a ridge from which the fire was coming about 700-800 yards ahead, they began taking casualties from machine gun and rifle fire. About 100 <b>yards</b> <b>out</b> from the ridge, they received a heavy mortar barrage, resulting in a number of them being wounded. Channon also received a couple of burp gun rounds to his lower left leg. Shortly after, a couple of light tanks arrived. Pete Hamilton (1st Plt Ldr) and Channon crawled up on the tanks, bore-sighted the guns on the machine guns and blew them away. About 30 <b>yards</b> <b>out</b> from a Chinese trench at the base of the ridge nose, they received a heavy volley of grenades. Abandoning protocol (once you start a charge, you are not supposed to hit the ground), Channon, knowing that he’d have no trouble getting his Rangers up again, had them hit the ground. When they got up, the Rangers took the ridge nose in a bayonet and grenade fight. When their position was secure, Platoon Sergeant Barber reported that they only had eight Rangers capable of continuing on. Pete Hamilton had been too seriously wounded to continue.|$|E
50|$|The {{first was}} 79-yard drive that Henry Josey {{finished}} with a 2-yard run to get the Tigers within 24-10. The Wildcats promptly went three-and-out, and Franklin led Missouri on a 74-yard drive that he finished off with a plunge from a <b>yard</b> <b>out</b> with 5:02 left in the game.|$|R
60|$|And yet we knew 'twas in 'im, we knew as 'e could fly; But what we couldn't git at was 'ow to make 'im try. We'd almost {{turned the}} job up, {{until at last}} one day We got the last <b>yard</b> <b>out</b> of 'im in a most amazin' way.|$|R
50|$|Following a run {{of eight}} games without a win, Birmingham beat Liverpool 1-0 at Anfield. Veteran Darren Anderton scored the goal on 77 minutes.

5|$|He {{finished}} the season against Sewanee on Thanksgiving Day. In the first quarter, a trick play caught Sewanee off guard. On the previous play, Kuhn ran six <b>yards</b> <b>out</b> of bounds. Then, on a fake run, {{he threw a}} pass to Bomar, who was alone behind the defense and ran {{the rest of the}} way for a touchdown. Kuhn featured in a second-quarter scoring drive, completing a 10-yard pass to Scotty Neill inside the five-yard line and faking his way through the line for a touchdown. The Commodores won, 26–0; Kuhn was selected as an All-American by Billy Evans and received an honorable mention on Walter Camp's team. Kuhn and Centre's Flash Covington were the two quarterbacks from Evans' All-Southern team to receive Camp's mention. At the December 5, 1922 Vanderbilt football banquet, he was elected Commodore captain for the following season.|$|E

The Cowboys tried to come back, but it fell short, as the Cowboys lost their seventh {{straight}} game.|$|R
5|$|On 17 March 2015, Chopra {{signed for}} Scottish Championship club Alloa Athletic {{for the rest}} of the season. On that very day, he made his debut against Rangers.

Four days later, he scored his second goal for the club, as he opened the scoring in a 2–0 victory against Brechin City in the relegation play-offs. Chopra was {{released}} by Alloa due to injury in March 2016, exactly one year after he signed for the club.|$|E
5|$|Stuart scored {{his first}} {{goal of the}} 2008–09 season in the 2–1 home defeat to Stevenage Borough on 25 September. Stevenage's goalkeeper, Chris Day, parried a header from Barry Cogan which dropped at Stuart's feet who hit a low hard shot from ten <b>yards</b> <b>out.</b> Grays faced League One outfit Carlisle United away in the FA Cup first round on 8 November. In the 1–1 stalemate, Stuart scored Grays' only goal in the 52nd minute, with a ten-yard volley.
