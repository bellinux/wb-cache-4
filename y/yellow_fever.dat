5|$|Although too old {{to serve}} in the military, Blackburn {{supported}} the Confederate cause during the Civil War. In {{the early days of the}} war, he acted as a civilian agent for the governments of Kentucky and Mississippi. By 1863, he was aiding Confederate blockade runners in Canada. In 1864, he traveled to Bermuda to help combat a <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> outbreak that threatened Confederate blockade running operations there. Shortly after the war's end, a Confederate double agent accused him of having carried out a plot to start a <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> epidemic in the Northern United States that would have hampered the Union war effort. Blackburn was accused of collecting linens and garments used by <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> patients and smuggling them into the Northern states to be sold. The evidence against Blackburn was considerable, although much of it was either circumstantial or provided by witnesses of questionable reputation. Although he was acquitted by a Toronto court, public sentiment was decidedly against him throughout much of the United States. Today, historians still disagree as to the strength of the evidence supporting Blackburn's role in the alleged plot. Any plot of this nature was destined to fail, however; in 1900, Walter Reed discovered that <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> is spread by mosquitoes, not by contact.|$|E
5|$|Diseases {{encountered}} {{among the}} immigrants included smallpox, typhus, and <b>yellow</b> <b>fever.</b> There were 37 recorded deaths.|$|E
5|$|During Memphis's 1873 <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> {{epidemic}}, he—along {{with other}} Memphis rabbis and leading Jews—remained {{in the city}} rather than fleeing. During the seven weeks the epidemic lasted, 51 people were buried in B'nai Israel's cemetery, almost twice the number typically buried there in a whole year. When another <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> epidemic broke out in 1878, Samfield stayed again, ministering to the dead and dying of all faiths. During that epidemic 78 people were buried in the congregation's cemetery. The city's frequent <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> epidemics decimated its Jewish community, which dropped from 2,100 to 300. They also hurt B'nai Israel's finances; members did not pay their dues, {{and for a time}} the congregation could not afford to pay Samfield. By 1880, however, membership had increased to 124 families, and finances had improved. By this time, the synagogue was more typically called Children of Israel. Beth El Emeth was affected more severely than Children of Israel by the epidemics; its rabbi (Peres) died of <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> in 1879. In 1882, Beth El Emeth disbanded, and transferred its property to Children of Israel, though most Beth El Emeth members joined the Orthodox Baron Hirsch Synagogue. The property included land on Second Street, and Beth El Emeth's cemetery.|$|E
5|$|Egan and the {{trustees}} of St. Mary's established a singing school in 1804, {{with the goal}} of improving the quality of the choir there. The following year was consumed by another <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> outbreak, and Egan joined John Rossiter, the pastor of another of Philadelphia's four Catholic churches, St. Joseph's, in ministering to the sick. In 1806, they worked with the parishioners of a third church, Holy Trinity, to found an orphanage, as the problem of orphaned children had been made worse by the <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> deaths.|$|E
5|$|<b>Yellow</b> <b>fever</b> {{and malaria}} among workers had seriously delayed {{construction}} of the Panama Canal. Mosquito control instituted by William C. Gorgas dramatically reduced this problem.|$|E
5|$|However, in 1801 he fell ill, {{contracting}} <b>Yellow</b> <b>Fever.</b> He {{was sent}} to sea by his doctors {{in an attempt to}} regain his health but died aboard HMS Tisiphone in September 1801.|$|E
5|$|Nancy Lea {{died of an}} undiagnosed set of flu-like ailments on February 7, 1864, and was entombed on {{the grounds}} of her home. Margaret died on December 3, 1867, having {{contracted}} <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> during an epidemic. Walter Reed would not make his discovery of the cause of <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> through mosquito bite until 1900; contamination through contact was the pervading fear in 1867, and prevented Margaret's remains from being interred in a public cemetery with her husband's. She was buried in the ground beside Nancy's tomb at 11 p.m. by her servant Bingley, family friend Major Eber Cave, and her two daughters Nettie and Mary Willie. No funeral service was performed.|$|E

5|$|David Glasgow Farragut (1801–1870) {{was born}} on at Campbell's Station, near Knoxville, Tennessee, to Jordi and Elizabeth Farragut. After Farragut's mother died from <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> in his 1808, his father gave him up for adoption, and he was adopted by future-U.S. Navy Captain David Porter.|$|E
5|$|During the American Civil War, Confederate forces under Major General John B. Magruder {{attacked}} and expelled occupying Union {{troops from the}} city in January 1863 in the Battle of Galveston. In 1867 Galveston suffered a <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> epidemic; 1800 {{people died in the}} city. These occurred in waterfront and river cities throughout the 19th century, as did cholera epidemics.|$|E
5|$|In 1906, {{transmission}} by the Aedes mosquitoes was confirmed, and in 1907 dengue was {{the second}} disease (after <b>yellow</b> <b>fever)</b> that was shown {{to be caused by}} a virus. Further investigations by John Burton Cleland and Joseph Franklin Siler completed the basic understanding of dengue transmission.|$|E
5|$|Luke Pryor Blackburn (June 16, 1816September 14, 1887) was an American physician, philanthropist, and {{politician}} from Kentucky. He {{was elected}} the 28th governor of Kentucky, serving from 1879 to 1883. Until {{the election of}} Ernie Fletcher in 2003, Blackburn was the only physician to serve as governor of Kentucky. After earning a medical degree at Transylvania University, Blackburn moved to Natchez, Mississippi, and gained national fame for implementing the first successful quarantine against <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> in the Mississippi River valley in 1848. He came {{to be regarded as}} an expert on <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> and often worked pro bono to combat outbreaks. Among his philanthropic ventures was the construction of a hospital for boatmen working on the Mississippi River using his personal funds. He later successfully lobbied Congress to construct a series of similar hospitals along the Mississippi.|$|E
5|$|Microorganisms are the causative agents (pathogens) in many {{infectious}} diseases {{of humans and}} animals. Pathogenic bacteria cause diseases such as plague, tuberculosis and anthrax. Protozoa cause diseases including malaria, sleeping sickness, dysentery and toxoplasmosis. Microscopic fungi cause diseases such as ringworm, candidiasis and histoplasmosis. Pathogenic viruses cause diseases such as influenza, <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> and AIDS.|$|E
5|$|Mälzel {{eventually}} {{took the}} Turk {{on his second}} tour to Havana, Cuba. In Cuba, Schlumberger died of <b>yellow</b> <b>fever,</b> leaving Mälzel without a director for his machine. Dejected, Mälzel died at sea in 1838 {{at the age of}} 66 during his return trip, leaving his machinery with the ship captain.|$|E
5|$|On September 5, {{the mayor}} of Hickman, Kentucky, a small western town along the Mississippi River, telegraphed {{the state board of}} health, informing them that <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> had reached {{epidemic}} levels in the city and requesting that Blackburn be sent to them as soon as possible. Blackburn arrived on September 7 to find that roughly 20 percent of the town's population were ill with <b>yellow</b> <b>fever.</b> He organized cleanup crews to disinfect the town and a squad of Negroes to guard vacated homes. In late September, when it appeared the Hickman epidemic was waning, Blackburn traveled to Chattanooga and Martin, Tennessee, to render aid, but within ten days, he received word that the outbreak in Hickman had resurged and spread to nearby Fulton, Kentucky. Blackburn returned to the area and continued his ministrations until late October, when the outbreak had fully subsided.|$|E
5|$|The {{establishment}} of the scientific method from about the mid-19th century on demanded testable hypotheses and verifiable phenomena for causation and transmission. Anecdotal reports, and the discovery in 1881 that mosquitos were the vector of <b>yellow</b> <b>fever,</b> {{eventually led to the}} investigation of mosquitoes in connection with malaria.|$|E
5|$|About {{the same}} time as his gubernatorial {{campaign}} began, Blackburn appeared before the Kentucky General Assembly to advocate measures to protect the state against disease outbreaks, including the creation of a state board of health and the construction of quarantine centers in the state's border towns. To a large degree, his pleas fell upon deaf ears, with the exception of his proposal for the state board of health, which was created in March 1878. Soon after, news came that <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> had appeared in the lower Mississippi Valley earlier than usual; by August 1878, it had reached epidemic proportions. Blackburn advocated implementing quarantines to deal with the influx of people fleeing north to escape the disease, but many of the state's doctors did not believe <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> could survive as far north as Kentucky. Some towns in the Jackson Purchase region attempted to implement crude quarantines, but the city of Louisville completely ignored Blackburn's advice and welcomed refugees from the South. Blackburn temporarily halted his gubernatorial campaign and traveled to Louisville to help treat those who arrived there already suffering from the disease.|$|E
5|$|Bates leaves Obydos; {{he finds}} the people lazy, as {{otherwise}} they could easily become comfortable with mixed farming. They sail through a tremendous storm. He finds a Pterochroza grasshopper whose forewings perfectly resemble leaves, the Victoria waterlily, masses of ticks, the howler monkey and large Morpho butterflies. He meets Wallace again at Barra. Back in Para, he catches <b>yellow</b> <b>fever.</b>|$|E
5|$|Dengue fever virus (DENV) is an RNA virus of {{the family}} Flaviviridae; genus Flavivirus. Other {{members of the same}} genus include <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> virus, West Nile virus, St. Louis {{encephalitis}} virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, Kyasanur forest disease virus, and Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus. Most are transmitted by arthropods (mosquitoes or ticks), and are therefore also referred to as arboviruses (arthropod-borne viruses).|$|E
5|$|Drawn by the city's prosperous economy, the Blackburns {{relocated}} to Natchez, Mississippi, in 1847. Luke Blackburn quickly became {{an active member}} of the community, helping found a temperance society, joining a militia group, and becoming the administrator of a local hospital. He became a close associate of Jefferson Davis and William Johnson. In 1848, Blackburn served as the city's health officer and implemented the first successful quarantine against a <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> outbreak in the Mississippi River valley. Using his own personal funds, he established a hospital for boatmen who navigated the Mississippi River. He also successfully lobbied the Congress to establish a hospital in Natchez; upon its completion in 1852, he was appointed surgeon there. In 1854, he implemented another successful quarantine against <b>yellow</b> <b>fever.</b> The Mississippi Legislature commissioned Blackburn to lobby the Louisiana State Legislature to establish a quarantine at New Orleans to protect cities along the Mississippi River; Louisiana authorized him to organize such a system.|$|E
5|$|In 1881, Dr. Carlos Finlay, a Scottish {{physician}} practising in Havana, {{theorized that}} <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> was transmitted by a specific mosquito, later designated Aedes aegypti. The theory remained controversial {{for twenty years}} until confirmed in 1901 by Walter Reed. This was the first scientific proof of a disease being transmitted exclusively by an insect vector, and demonstrated that control of such diseases necessarily entailed control or eradication of its insect vector.|$|E
5|$|Many {{insects are}} parasites of other insects {{such as the}} {{parasitoid}} wasps. These insects are known as entomophagous parasites. They can be beneficial due to their devastation of pests that can destroy crops and other resources. Many insects have a parasitic relationship with humans such as the mosquito. These insects are known to spread diseases such as malaria and <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> and because of such, mosquitoes indirectly cause more deaths of humans than any other animal.|$|E
5|$|On June 7, 1855, the 183-ft. vessel Benjamin Franklin {{put into}} Hampton Roads for repairs. She had just sailed from the West Indies where {{there had been}} an {{outbreak}} of <b>yellow</b> <b>fever.</b> The port health officer ordered the ship quarantined. After eleven days, a second inspection found no issues, so she was allowed to dock. A few days later, the first cases of <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> were discovered in Norfolk, and a machinist died from the disease on July 8. By August, several people were dying per day, and a third of the city's population had fled in the hopes of escaping the epidemic. No one understood how the disease was transmitted. With both Norfolk and Portsmouth being infected, New York banned all traffic from those sites. Neighboring cities also banned residents from Norfolk. The epidemic spread through the city via mosquitoes and poor sanitation, affecting every family and causing widespread panic. The number of infected reached 5,000 in September, and by the second week, 1,500 had died in Norfolk and Portsmouth. As the weather cooled, the outbreak began to wane, leaving a final tally of about 3,200 dead. It took the city some time to recover.|$|E
5|$|On November 20, 1985, {{one week}} later, rescue efforts began to cease. Nearly 4,000relief workers and rescue team members were {{still searching for}} survivors, with little hope of finding any. By then, the {{official}} death toll was registered at 22,540people; additional counts showed that 3,300 were missing, 20,000homeless, and 4,000injured. Looters raided the ruins and survivors faced concerns of typhus and <b>yellow</b> <b>fever.</b> For most of the relief workers, their job was over.|$|E
5|$|The {{city has}} free {{immunization}} programs for children, specifically targeted against the seven major diseases – smallpox, diphtheria, tetanus, <b>yellow</b> <b>fever,</b> whooping cough, polio, and measles. As of 2016, {{a total of}} 31,115 children age one and below has been “fully immunized”. The Manila Dialysis Center that provides free services for the poor has been cited by the United Nations Committee on Innovation, Competitiveness and Public-Private Partnerships {{as a model for}} public-private partnership (PPP) projects.|$|E
5|$|The {{light and}} {{grenadier}} companies {{were involved in}} the capture, shortly afterwards, of St Lucia and the recapture of Guadeloupe. A short period as garrison duty followed and then the regiment returned to England, severely weakened by both losses in battle and sickness, mostly <b>yellow</b> <b>fever.</b> Sir Charles Grey, commander of the British forces in the West Indies, estimated that he had lost 5,000 out of 7,000 troops in less than six months.|$|E
5|$|The {{vaccine is}} {{produced}} by Sanofi and goes by the brand name Dengvaxia. It {{is based on a}} weakened combination of the <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> virus and each of the four dengue serotypes. Two studies of a vaccine found it was 60% effective and prevented more than 80 to 90% of severe cases. This is less than wished for by some.|$|E
5|$|Wallace and Bates {{spent most}} of their first year {{collecting}} near Belém do Pará, then explored inland separately, occasionally meeting to discuss their findings. In 1849, they were briefly joined by another young explorer, botanist Richard Spruce, along with Wallace's younger brother Herbert. Herbert left soon thereafter (dying two years later from <b>yellow</b> <b>fever),</b> but Spruce, like Bates, would spend over ten years collecting in South America.|$|E
5|$|After his acquittal, Blackburn {{remained}} in Canada to avoid arrest and prosecution by U.S. authorities. When {{he learned of}} a <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> outbreak in New Orleans and the Texas Gulf Coast, Blackburn wrote to President Andrew Johnson on September 4, 1867, asking permission {{to return to the}} U.S. and help treat the disease. Not waiting for Johnson's response—which never came—Blackburn returned to the U.S., arriving in Louisville on September 25, 1867, en route to New Orleans. After rendering aid during the epidemic, he and his family moved to an Arkansas plantation owned by his wife.|$|E
5|$|Chagas {{named the}} {{pathogenic}} parasite as Trypanosoma cruzi and {{later that year}} as Schizotrypanum cruzi, both honoring Oswaldo Cruz, the noted Brazilian physician and epidemiologist who successfully fought epidemics of <b>yellow</b> <b>fever,</b> smallpox, and bubonic plague in Rio de Janeiro and other cities {{in the beginning of}} the 20th century. Chagas was also the first to unknowingly discover and illustrate the parasitic fungal genus Pneumocystis, later infamously linked to PCP (Pneumocystis pneumonia in AIDS victims). Confusion between the two pathogens' life-cycles led him to briefly recognize his genus Schizotrypanum, but following the description of Pneumocystis by others as an independent genus, Chagas returned to the use of the name Trypanosoma cruzi.|$|E
5|$|During {{service on}} the {{blockade}} at various other points, Albany arrived off {{the mouth of the}} Tabasco River by 13 June. As in the Tuxpan operation, members of her crew joined an inland expedition. The movement upriver began late in the first dog watch on 14 June. In two days, the American force ascended the river, disembarked the landing force, routed the defenders on the approaches to Tabasco, and captured the town. The Americans remained there until 22 July, when <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> and Mexican troops forced the evacuation of the town.|$|E
5|$|Eight others {{implicated in}} Lincoln's {{assassination}} were tried {{by a military}} tribunal in Washington, D.C. and found guilty on June 30, 1865. Mary Surratt, Lewis Powell, David Herold, and George Atzerodt were hanged in the Old Arsenal Penitentiary on July 7, 1865. Samuel Mudd, Samuel Arnold, and Michael O'Laughlen were sentenced to life imprisonment at Fort Jefferson in Florida's Dry Tortugas. Edmund Spangler was given a six-year term in prison. O'Laughlen died in a <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> epidemic there in 1867. The others were eventually pardoned in February 1869 by President Andrew Johnson.|$|E
5|$|Epidemics accidentally {{introduced}} by the Spanish included smallpox, measles and influenza. These diseases, together with typhus and <b>yellow</b> <b>fever,</b> had {{a major impact on}} Maya populations. The Old World diseases brought with the Spanish and against which the indigenous New World peoples had no resistance were a deciding factor in the conquest; the diseases crippled armies and decimated populations before battles were even fought. Their introduction was catastrophic in the Americas; it is estimated that 90% of the indigenous population had been eliminated by disease within the first century of European contact.|$|E

5|$|In 1802, {{during the}} Haitian Revolution, Dermide {{arrived on the}} island-colony of Saint-Domingue with his parents, {{as part of the}} Saint-Domingue expedition. After his father's death of <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> later during the year, Dermide and Pauline were brought back to France. In 1803, Pauline remarried, this time to Italian nobleman Camillo Borghese, and she took up residence, along with her husband and son, in Rome. Always a frail child, Dermide died of a fever at the age of six, three months after his uncle became Emperor and two years before his mother's {{proclamation}} as Duchess of Guastalla.|$|E
5|$|In August 1835, Jefferson and Sarah {{traveled}} {{south to}} his sister Anna's home in West Feliciana Parish, Louisiana; the plantation was known as Locust Grove. Their goal was to spend the hot summer months in the countryside away from the river floodplain, for their health, but both of them contracted either malaria or <b>yellow</b> <b>fever.</b> Sarah {{died at the age}} of 21 on September 15, 1835, after just three months of marriage. Davis was also severely ill, and his family feared for his life. In the month following Sarah's death, he slowly improved, although he remained weak.|$|E
