2500|$|All black {{bass are}} scent {{as well as}} visual predators so care {{should be taken to}} ensure no foreign scents, like bug spray, or any outdoor chemicals, or any {{personal}} chemicals, like tobacco, contaminate one's hands when handling <b>your</b> <b>line,</b> reels, rods, artificial baits, and particularly soft plastics. [...] Bass are usually filleted when taken for the table; the flesh is white and flaky, with a mild taste when cooked.|$|E
2500|$|At 11 a.m. on June 3, the Confederate {{postmaster}} general, John Henninger Reagan, {{arrived with}} a delegation from Richmond. He asked Robert E. Lee, [...] "General, if the enemy breaks <b>your</b> <b>line,</b> what reserve have you?" [...] Lee provided an animated response: [...] "Not a regiment, {{and that has been}} my condition ever since the fighting commenced on the Rappahannock. If I shorten my lines to provide a reserve, he will turn me; if I weaken my lines to provide a reserve, he will break them." ...|$|E

2500|$|As Lee was savoring {{his victory}} at the Chancellorsville crossroads, he {{received}} disturbing news: Maj. Gen. John Sedgwick's force had broken through the Confederate lines at Fredericksburg and was headed toward Chancellorsville. On the night of May 2, {{in the aftermath of}} Jackson's flank attack, Hooker had ordered Sedgwick to [...] "cross the Rappahannock at Fredericksburg on the receipt of this order, and at once take up <b>your</b> <b>line</b> of march on the Chancellorsville road until you connect with him. You will attack and destroy any force you may fall in with on the road." [...] Lee had left a relatively small force at Fredericksburg, ordering Brig. Gen. Jubal Early to [...] "watch the enemy and try to hold him." [...] If he was attacked in [...] "overwhelming numbers," [...] Early was to retreat to Richmond, but if Sedgwick withdrew from his front, he was to join with Lee at Chancellorsville. On the morning of May 2, Early received a garbled message from Lee's staff that caused him to start marching most of his men toward Chancellorsville, but he quickly returned after a warning from Brig. Gen. William Barksdale of a Union advance against Fredericksburg. At 7 a.m. on May 3, Early was confronted with four Union divisions: Brig. Gen. John Gibbons of the II Corps had crossed the Rappahannock north of town, and three divisions of Sedgwick's VI Corps—Maj. Gen. John Newton and Brig. Gens. Albion P. Howe and William T. H. Brooks—were arrayed in line {{from the front of the}} town to Deep Run. Most of Early's combat strength was deployed to the south of town, where Federal troops had achieved their most significant successes during the December battle. Marye's Heights was defended by Barksdale's Mississippi brigade and Early ordered the Louisiana brigade of Brig. Gen. Harry T. Hays from the far right to Barksdale's left.|$|E
