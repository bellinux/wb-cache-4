5|$|Excavations of {{the tomb}} of Nikau-Isesi under the {{direction}} of Naguib Kanawati at Saqqara have yielded evidence in support of a shorter reign. Nikau-Isesi was an official who started his career during the reign of Djedkare Isesi, lived through that of Unas and died as overseer of Upper-Egypt under Unas' successor Teti. Nikau-Isesi is known to have died on the year of the eleventh cattle count during Teti's reign, an event consisting of counting the livestock throughout the country to evaluate the amount of taxes to be levied. It is traditionally believed that such counts occurred every two <b>years</b> <b>during</b> the Old Kingdom and every year during the later Middle Kingdom (c.2055–c.1650 BC). Thus Nikau-Isesi would have lived for 22 years after Teti took the throne and together with the 30 years of reign credited to Unas, would have died past 70 years old. However, forensic examination of his mummy yielded an age at death of no more than 45 years old. This suggests that the cattle count occurred more than once every two <b>years</b> <b>during</b> Unas and Teti's time, possibly irregularly. If so, Unas' 30-year figure on the Turin canon, understood to mean 15 cattle counts, could translate into as little as 15 years, which together with just 11 <b>years</b> <b>during</b> Teti's reign would account for Nikau-Isesi's death at around 40 to 45 years of age.|$|E

2500|$|The rate of {{areal density}} {{advancement}} {{was similar to}} Moore's law (doubling every two years) through 2010: 60% per <b>year</b> <b>during</b> 1988–1996, 100% during 1996–2003 and 30% during 2003–2010. Gordon Moore (1997) called the increase [...] "flabbergasting," [...] while observing later that growth cannot continue forever. Price improvement decelerated to −12% per <b>year</b> <b>during</b> 2010–2017, as the growth of areal density slowed.
