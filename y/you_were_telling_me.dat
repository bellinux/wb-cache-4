6000|$|... "I wish to Heaven that I {{could see}} your face!" [...] Pelham exclaimed, [...] "I should know then whether <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> the truth." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You know it isn't that," [...] he {{answered}} hastily. [...] "It's my work, nothing but my work. Go on with what <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me,</b> Violet." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Who <b>are</b> <b>you?</b> I've {{never seen}} you before and now <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> all these things." ...|$|R
50|$|Abbasi: So, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> I <b>am</b> {{an enemy}} combatant. I <b>am</b> <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> by special Geneva Conventions, I am a non-combatant….|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not think}} <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> everything, Mr. Quatermain, but {{something}} seems {{to say that this}} is because it is not well that I should learn everything." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't bully her, Janet," [...] said Allen; [...] "we {{are not so}} stupid, are we, Jessie? Come {{and show}} me the walnut-tree <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> about." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Surely it {{must have}} been one of the mines <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> about," [...] said Miles, in a low voice to Sergeant Gilroy, who stood near to him.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{fellow who}} took up golf at thirty-eight {{and let the}} girl he was engaged to marry go off with someone else because he hadn't the time to combine golf with courtship? I remember. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> about him the other day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'But if he {{is really}} your brother, why did you hide him?' asked he. 'I believe <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> a lie, and if he comes back I shall kill him!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Jones," [...] Lady Fitzgerald {{had said}} to her, very earnestly, [...] "if you know more about this man than <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me,</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> bound to speak out, {{and let me know}} everything." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You! This <b>is</b> impossible. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> a {{fabricated}} lie. If you {{had gone}} away in that boat, how could <b>you</b> now <b>be</b> here? No, no--it is a miserable lie, and Rose is below!" ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{laughed in}} the frost, {{and he was}} certain it was the prettiest {{laughter}} he had ever heard. [...] "And have you married and raised all those children <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> about?" [...] Before he could retort, she went on. [...] "How many chechakos are there behind?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am not joking," [...] I rejoined. [...] "I {{never met}} {{with two more}} ill-looking villains in my life. The window was open when <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> about the {{necessity}} for melting the plates again. They may {{know as well as}} we do, that your gold and silver will be returned to you after a time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am getting}} {{perfectly}} callous," [...] she confided. [...] "If it did, this house would probably follow, father would realise {{everything he could}} lay his hands upon and become the autocrat of some French watering place, and I should cease to be the honest but impecunious daughter of a wicked nobleman, and enjoy the liberty of the middle-class young women <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> about. It wouldn't be so bad!" ...|$|E
5000|$|... "There are {{districts that}} I am 100 percent sure no {{government}} worker {{can go to}} - But <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> that still so many people registered? I don't believe it." [...] Roshanak Wardak, Afghan member of parliament from Wardak Province ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know why}} <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> all this, Richard," [...] {{his wife said}} calmly. [...] "I did not cast any {{reflections}} as to {{the manner in which}} you made your choice. I only said I wished to see the list." ...|$|R
5000|$|Criticism has {{no clear}} motivation: [...] "why <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> this, and why <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> about it now?".|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know, I don't know. Yes, I do. Do {{you know}} whether that cottage <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> about where you lived while you were away from here, is to let? That will do nicely, for there I should be away from every one. Get me a box from the lumber room, and tell Harriet {{to go out and}} get me a post chaise from the Red Lion as soon as my son has gone to the mill." ...|$|E
6000|$|Godfrey smiled. [...] "You forget {{there would}} be some {{preliminary}} trouble in knocking me on the head, Alexis; but seriously, I don't think any natives who have been in contact at all with civilization are disposed to take life without some strong motive. Of course robbery would be a motive, but I should certainly have nothing about me that a Tartar or a Buriat--I suppose they are all something of the same thing--would covet. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> yourself that many of these people have very large flocks and herds. Is it likely such people as these would cut a stranger's throat on the chance of finding a few roubles in his pocket?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear Lady Deringham," [...] he said, [...] "I {{have told}} you the exact truth. I {{want to get some}} {{statistics}} for my paper. Mr. C. himself recommended me to try and get them from your husband; that is absolutely all. As for this attempted robbery of which <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me,</b> believe me when I assure you that I know nothing whatever about it. Your son's interest is, after all, only natural. The study of the papers on which your husband has been engaged is the only reasonable test of his sanity. Frankly, I cannot believe that any one in Lord Deringham's mental state could produce any work likely to be of the slightest permanent value." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I believe <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> a falsehood, Anne," [...] {{she said}} sharply. [...] "I know <b>you</b> <b>are.</b> There now, don't say {{anything}} more unless <b>you</b> <b>are</b> prepared to <b>tell</b> the whole truth. Go to your room and stay there until <b>you</b> <b>are</b> ready to confess." ...|$|R
5000|$|November 29, 2007 - Portsmouth {{football}} manager Harry Redknapp angrily {{denied any}} wrongdoing after being arrested by police investigating alleged corruption in football: [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> this <b>is</b> how <b>you</b> treat anyone, {{it is not}} the society I grew up in." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What I hailed ye for {{was only}} this," [...] he said, after I had shaken hands with him. [...] "I saw you a minnit ago standin' over in yon box--chirpin' with a lady--a young lady, peart and pretty. Might <b>you</b> <b>be</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> her name?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My own, own man. Then we went abroad, and as {{good fortune}} would have it you came in our way. It {{was not long before}} you made me love you. That was not my fault, George. I loved you so dearly when <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> that story about the other girl;--but, somehow, I could not tell you then a similar story about myself. It seemed at first so odd that my story should be the same, and then it looked almost as though I were mocking you. Had you had no story to tell, you would have known all my own before I had allowed myself to be made happy by your love. Do you not {{perceive}} that it was so?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, my dear Prince," [...] she declared, [...] "it is my anxiety {{for your}} safety which induces me to propose this. Only {{a few minutes}} ago <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> that you feared that you had become an {{extremely}} unpopular person in Paris, and that the very streets were not safe for you. Under the circumstances, one can scarcely wonder at it! The French Government, however, is above all small feelings. A private citizen in Paris, even though he be an enemy of France, is a person to be respected. The protection of the detective force of Paris is at your service. Monsieur Bourgan, you will do me the great favor of conducting my husband to his rooms. Afterwards you will return here to continue your watch over Sir Julien." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Take to her! Can I not {{interest}} {{myself in}} human beings without wishing to make them flesh of my flesh, bone of my bone? What am I to think of you? It was but {{the other day that}} all that you are now telling me of Miss Boncassen, <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> of Lady Mabel Grex." [...] Here poor Silverbridge bit his lips and shook his head, and looked down upon the ground. This was the weak part of his case. He could not tell his father the whole story about Mabel,--that she had coyed his love, so that he had been justified in thinking himself free from any claim in that direction when he had encountered the infinitely sweeter charms of Isabel Boncassen. [...] "You are weak as water," [...] said the unhappy father.|$|E

6000|$|... "I am very, {{very sorry}} for the relapse," [...] said she, [...] "but awfully glad for the stay. And you mustn't stand another minute. Let us go {{and sit in the}} arbor. The sun is shining {{straight}} into it, and that will make it all the more comfortable, while <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> about those things." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You <b>are</b> {{trying to}} <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> something, Father Sobriente," [...] he said, with an effort. [...] "Speak out, I implore you. I can stand {{anything}} but this mystery. I {{am no longer}} a child. I {{have a right to}} know all. This that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>is</b> no fable--I see it in your face, Father Sobriente; it is the story of--of--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{certainly}} odd," [...] the sheriff went on, [...] "after what <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> {{about her son}} pitching into Andrew over flogging this very slave, that she should go and buy his wife. Still, that's a very different thing from hiding a runaway. I dare say that, as she says, the fellow came here to see his wife when he first ran away; but I don't think you will find him anywhere about here now. It's pretty certain from what we hear that he hasn't made for the North, and where the fellow can be hiding I can't think. Still the woods about this country are mighty big, and the fellow can {{go out on the}} farms and pick corn and keep himself going for a long time. But he's sure to be brought up, sooner or later." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I don’t {{want to be}} discouraging, but that’s not true,” I returned. “I’m {{sure that}} during the months you lay here in pain you had visitations sublime. You thought of a {{thousand}} things. You think of more and more all the while. That’s what makes you, if you’ll pardon my familiarity, so respectable. At a time when {{so many people are}} spent you come into your second wind. But, thank God, all the same, you’re better! Thank God, too, you’re not, as <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> yesterday, ‘successful.’ If you weren’t a failure what would be the use of trying? That’s my one reserve on the subject of your recovery—that it makes you ‘score,’ as the newspapers say. It looks well in the newspapers, and almost anything that does that’s horrible. ‘We are happy to announce that Mr. Paraday, the celebrated author, is again in the enjoyment of excellent health.’ Somehow I shouldn’t like to see it.” ...|$|E
60|$|I saw at once {{what had}} happened. Rube's rifle, {{as he was}} making a blow at a man, had struck a beam over his head, and the shock had made it fly from his hands across the room. In another moment the two Mexicans were upon him with their knives. He hit out wildly, but he got a gash across the {{forehead}} and another on the arm in a moment. I made two strides across the hut, and the Mexicans who were attacking me, instead of trying to prevent me, made a rush to the corner where their rifles were, which I had left unguarded. It was a fatal mistake. My gun came down crash upon the head of one of Rube's assailants before he knew of my approach, and another minute did for the second. As I turned from him the remaining two Mexicans leveled at Rube, who had rushed across to pick up his gun, and myself, and gave a cry as the flints fell and there was no report. For a minute or two they fought desperately with the guns; but it was no use, and it was soon over, and we stood the masters of the hut, with eleven dead men round us. For they were dead every one, for we examined them. The stocks of our guns had broken with the first blow, and the rest had been given with the iron, and in no case had we to hit twice. I don't say it was anything like Samson and the donkey's jaw-bone <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> about, but it war very fair hitting. It was scarcely over when we heard several men come running up outside.|$|E
5000|$|Thomson {{has rarely}} given {{interviews}} {{to the press}} and maintains a low public profile. [...] "The only substantial interview he has given was to James FitzGerald, who wrote a book about the elite private school (Upper Canada College) they both attended in Toronto," [...] according to a July 3, 2006 article in The New York Times. [...] "In his comments to Mr. FitzGerald 12 years ago, David had little positive to say about many people in the business world". In the interview, Thomson said: [...] "When you try to live a more balanced life, traditional businessmen think that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> not a real man. But who is not the real man? <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me?</b> <b>You</b> have not taken a weekend with your wife, you have no spare time that you use constructively, you do not have any hobbies, you {{do not know how to}} spell Mozart. And here <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> that I <b>am</b> weak?" [...] He resides in Toronto, Ontario.|$|R
6000|$|... "And do {{you really}} never mean to let your sister's child know who <b>you</b> <b>are?</b> <b>You</b> may <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that, surely--though you won't speak a word about Master Zack." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not at all," [...] said he, [...] "and I {{am going}} to show you how greatly mistaken <b>you</b> <b>are.</b> <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> not to go down that shaft, <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> to live on without ever knowing what it is I have discovered, <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> to explode bombs in that great hole until I have blocked it up, and I will obey <b>you.</b> That <b>is</b> how I love you, Margaret." ...|$|R
