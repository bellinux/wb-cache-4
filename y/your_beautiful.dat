500|$|The {{music of}} Parasakthi was {{composed}} by R. Sudarsanam. The lyrics {{were written by}} Bharathidasan, Subramania Bharati, M. Karunanidhi, Annal Thango, Udumalai Narayana Kavi and K. P. Kamatchisundaram. The background score was composed by the Chennai-based Saraswathi Stores Orchestra. Relatively higher importance {{was given to the}} film's dialogues over its music, so the dialogues were sold separately on audio cassettes. Some of the numbers from Parasakthi were based on songs from Hindi films; one was a rehash from the Urdu film Akeli (1952). The number [...] "O Rasikkum Seemane" [...] inspired [...] "Itai Tazhukikkolla" [...] from Periyar (2007). The 2010 film Rasikkum Seemane borrows its title from the song of the same name. Annadurai is referenced in the number [...] "Kaa Kaa Kaa", in the line [...] "Kaakai Annave neengal azhagaana vaayaal pannaga paadureenga", which translates to [...] "Crow elder, you are singing so melodiously with <b>your</b> <b>beautiful</b> mouth". It was written by Narayana Kavi. [...] "Poomalai" [...] is based on the Urdu song [...] "Sanwariya, Tohe Koi Pukare" [...] from the Pakistani film Dupatta (1952). An album containing remixed versions of the songs of Parasakthi was released in on 3 June 2009, to commemorate Karunanidhi's 86th birthday.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{time after}} the Titanic sank, while afloat in Lifeboat No. 1, Lucy Duff-Gordon {{reportedly}} commented to her secretary, [...] "There is <b>your</b> <b>beautiful</b> nightdress gone." [...] A fireman, annoyed by her comment, replied that while the couple could replace their property, {{he and the other}} crew members had lost everything in the sinking. Sir Cosmo then offered each of the men £5 (equivalent to £ in [...] ) to aid them until they received new assignments. While on the RMS Carpathia, the Cunard liner that rescued Titanics survivors, Sir Cosmo presented the men from Lifeboat No. 1 with checks drawn on his bank, Coutts. This action later spawned gossip that the Duff-Gordons had bribed their lifeboat's crew not to return to save swimmers out of fear the vessel would be swamped.|$|E
2500|$|Karim Massimov is {{considered}} a China expert. China has become an important strategic partner for Kazakhstan {{in recent years and}} the two countries are working closely together to develop Kazakhstan's energy resources. Massimov visited Beijing, China with Finance Minister Natalya Korzhova, Transport and Communications Minister Serik Akhmetov, and Energy and Mineral Resources Minister Baktykozha Izmukhambetov from 16–17 November 2006. Massimov co-chaired the third meeting of the China-Kazakhstan Cooperation Committee with Chinese Vice Premier Wu Yi. Several accords between agencies of the two governments were signed. Massimov later met with Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao. Meanwhile, Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev met with Liu Qi, secretary of the Beijing Party Committee, in Astana. Secretary Liu said was [...] "very nice for me to visit <b>your</b> <b>beautiful</b> country at Otan's invitation. The goal of the visit is to deepen cooperation and mutual understanding between our countries." ...|$|E
2500|$|Xinjiang {{has been}} {{experiencing}} an Islamic revival, manifest in decreased alcohol consumption and increased beard length in Hotan. Most visibly, since the July 2009 Ürümqi riots, many religious Hotan women {{of an older}} age began to wear a long face-concealing Islamic garment, which is more similar to the uniform of the female Chechen suicide bomber than to traditional Uyghur attire. Authorities became concerned with the fashion trend after a spate of murders and robberies outside Hotan where the perpetrators wore face-concealing veils, so they ineffectively campaigned to discourage women from wearing the veils, using slogans such as [...] "show off your pretty looks and let <b>your</b> <b>beautiful</b> long hair fly". Uyghur separatist attacks usually {{take the form of}} IEDs and vehicle-borne bombs in heavily-policed areas. Compared to the 1990s, such bombings from 2000 onward have tended to claim civilian as well as traditional police and bureaucrat targets.|$|E

2500|$|Boat 1 had {{room for}} about another 28 {{passengers}} {{but did not}} return to rescue those in the water after Titanic sank. Fireman Charles Hendrickson claimed he told his boat mates: [...] "It's up to us to go back and pick up anyone in the water" [...] but found no support. At least three other crewmembers, as well as the Duff Gordons, Salomon and Stengel, denied hearing any suggestion to go back or opposing any proposition to do so. In the media later, the Duff Gordons in particular were widely criticised for what was interpreted as their callousness {{in the face of the}} disaster. For instance, as Titanic sank, Lucile reportedly commented to her secretary: [...] "There is <b>your</b> <b>beautiful</b> nightdress gone." [...] Fireman Pusey replied that she shouldn't worry about losing her belongings because she could buy more. Pusey mentioned that the crew had lost all their kit and that their pay stopped from the moment of the sinking. Sir Cosmo responded: [...] "Very well, I will give you a fiver each to start a new kit!" [...] Aboard the rescue ship Carpathia, he did as he promised, presenting each of the seven crewmen in his lifeboat a cheque for £5.|$|E
