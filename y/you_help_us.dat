Either <b>you</b> <b>help</b> <b>us</b> in the revolution or you keep quiet with MONUC. But if you wait for MONUC to bring you peace, you can wait forever." [...] — Laurent Nkunda, rebel general ...|$|E
2500|$|While rebel troops did {{abide by}} the {{temporary}} ceasefire, Nkunda spoke to a crowd of 1,500 in a stadium in the rebel-held town of Rutshuru {{to tell them to}} reject the recent deployment of 3,000 more peacekeepers.

2500|$|Next to the {{entrance}} is a plaque made of azulejos with the following inscription: [...] "The Rábida is the first manifestation of the Hispano-American movement. This place, where {{the vision of a}} New World was conceived, is sacred to the hearts of people everywhere. Any Spaniard or American who reflects deeply and elevates his thoughts must ask, 'Won't <b>you</b> <b>help</b> <b>us</b> in our intention to spread love and peace, the forces that radiate from this humble monastery?' Christ, before whom Columbus, Friar Juan Perez, Friar Marchena, and the Pinzóns all prayed, opens his loving arms to men of all beliefs who harbor good will." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We should succeed if <b>you</b> <b>helped</b> <b>us.</b> At {{one time}} you used proudly to say: 'The League of The Scarlet Pimpernel has never failed.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{would have}} them in for dessert, and <b>you</b> <b>helped</b> <b>us,</b> only Sister Constance and Clem left all theirs for Cherry, and then you went by {{yourself}} and ate them all up.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We don't {{propose to}} bother, because I think we're even. <b>You</b> <b>helped</b> <b>us</b> sell our claim and the Combine {{know what you}} were willing to pay. We raised them some; one could take it for granted you wouldn't reach just value." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{are after}} that other sail-boat. The {{men in her}} are thieves and have {{abducted}} a girl, too. Will <b>you</b> <b>help</b> <b>us</b> catch them?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It will <b>you</b> <b>help</b> <b>us</b> {{to locate}} the mine before Arnold Baxter or his confederates can get on the ground? We will pay you for your trouble." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, if <b>you</b> <b>help</b> <b>us</b> {{to clear}} ourselves, we'll make it two {{thousand}} dollars," [...] cried Japson. He paused a moment. [...] "Quite a swell apartment, Fogg." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then he drew {{nearer to}} her, {{and said in}} a dry and dreadful voice: [...] "Oh, don't condescend to play the fool with such a fool as me. Are you really locked up here as a patient--because <b>you</b> <b>helped</b> <b>us</b> to escape?" ...|$|R
50|$|Aznar: We need <b>you</b> to <b>help</b> <b>us</b> {{with our}} public opinion.|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with The Independent, Yulia claimed that the song had helped people {{to be honest about}} their sexual orientations. She said [...] "People used to call us and say 'Thank <b>you.</b> That <b>helped</b> <b>us</b> to come out, ... <b>You</b> <b>helped</b> <b>us</b> to feel like people.'" [...] She then said [...] "It was our teenage years, ... You have to try everything. It felt at the time like it was real love - it felt like there was nothing more serious... Now when you look back at it, of course, it's ridiculous." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Won't <b>you</b> <b>help</b> <b>us,</b> Captain Blossom? Of course, we {{recognize}} {{the fact that those}} things belong to you, since you remained on the ship up to the time she struck the island." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{care who}} they are. Drunken ruffians and savages! That's enough. Will <b>you</b> <b>help</b> <b>us?</b> We are men {{of your own}} race, and we come to you for help. Can you {{withhold}} it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tell me," [...] {{said the}} Green Monkey earnestly, {{as he came}} close to the cage, [...] "what must we do, Daughter of the Rainbow, to escape from these transformations? Can't <b>you</b> <b>help</b> <b>us,</b> being a Fairy?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I know <b>you</b> can <b>help</b> <b>us.</b> When I {{was with}} her {{the last time she}} {{declared}} that you were the only one of us she ever wished to see again. She meant to include me then especially, but of course she was not thinking of Archie. I know <b>you</b> can <b>help</b> <b>us</b> if <b>you</b> will." ...|$|R
60|$|All we ask is--and all we dare ask--of divine or statesman, poet or warrior, {{musician}} or engineer--of Dryden or of Handel--of Isaac Watts or of Charles Dickens--but why go on {{with the}} splendid diversities of the splendid catalogue?--What was your work? Did we admire you for it? Did we love you for it? And why? Because you made us in some way or other better men. Because <b>you</b> <b>helped</b> <b>us</b> somewhat toward whatsoever things are pure, true, just, honourable, of good report. Because, if there was any virtue--that is, true valour and manhood; if there was any praise--that is, just honour in the sight of men, and therefore surely in the sight of the Son of man, who died for men; <b>you</b> <b>helped</b> <b>us</b> to think on such things. You, in one word, <b>helped</b> to make <b>us</b> better men.|$|R

6000|$|... "Then, I fear, {{there is}} little hope that Trackless is any wiser, as you are Mohawk born, and he, they tell me, is at bottom an Onondago. What say you, Trackless? can <b>you</b> <b>help</b> <b>us</b> to find the tree?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] {{cried the}} Hoppers in a chorus; [...] "can <b>you</b> <b>help</b> <b>us?</b> Please do! We will be greatly obliged! It would please us very much!" [...] and by these exclamations the Scarecrow {{knew that his}} speech had met with favor.|$|E
6000|$|... "First {{find the}} key, gal; we'll {{talk of the}} rest a'terwards. Sarpent, you've eyes like a fly, and a {{judgment}} that's seldom out.

6000|$|... "Say, won't <b>you</b> <b>help</b> <b>us</b> out?" [...] he went on, not so coolly. [...] "The other night, in the {{excitement}} we forgot to fetch Louise's clothes.... Fact is, we grabbed her up out of a sick bed, with only a dressing gown and a blanket. Won't you lend her some clothes, shoes, stockings--and--everything?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear {{neighbor}} Dart, {{he would}} envy you, {{if he knew}} how patiently you bear your troubles; how tenderly <b>you</b> <b>help</b> <b>us</b> with our little ones; how cheerfully you serve your friends; how faithfully you love your lost mate; and how trustfully you wait to meet him again in a lovelier country than the South." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{worst thing}} of all," [...] said the Wizard, [...] "is that my Black Bag is lost. It {{disappeared}} when I was transformed.

Will <b>you</b> <b>help</b> <b>us</b> search for the Black Bag, Friend Cat?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Cabman,' {{said the}} stout lady, {{with a very}} shaky voice, 'I wish <b>you</b> would <b>help</b> <b>us</b> in this painful business.' Those were her very hidentical words.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm sorry, Babbitt, but {{the best}} thing you can do--I hate to say it, but <b>you</b> could <b>help</b> <b>us</b> most by keeping {{strictly}} out of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} may," [...] {{answered}} the girl. [...] "You're {{one of the}} family now, Uncle John, and <b>you</b> must <b>help</b> <b>us</b> to unravel the mystery." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Exactly, but {{the curious}} {{part of the}} affair is that, up to the present, Mr. Sydney Barnes {{has been unable to}} {{discover}} the slightest trace of any investments or any sum of money whatever.

Did he ever give you any idea at all as to the source of his income?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "W-why yes. We're {{learning}} all of European Literature this year. The club gets {{such a nice}} magazine, Culture Hints, and {{we follow}} its programs. Last year our subject was Men and Women of the Bible, and next year we'll probably take up Furnishings and China. My, it does make a body hustle {{to keep up with}} all these new culture subjects, but it is improving. So will <b>you</b> <b>help</b> <b>us</b> with the discussion today?" ...|$|E
6000|$|TRESHAM... "To give a best of best accounts, yourself, [...] Of {{me and my}} demerits." [...] You are right! [...] He {{should have}} said what now I say for him.
