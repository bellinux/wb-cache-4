5000|$|Alfred de Vigny, [...] "The Prison" [...] (1821). Alfred de Vigny, {{the great}} French writer, {{composed}} a lengthy poem which purports to tell events which {{occurred at the}} death bed of the Man in the Iron Mask. An aged priest is called to offer the last rites of the Catholic Church to a mysterious prisoner. The poem begins with the bitter complaint of the priest who has been delayed an hour blindfolded before he is taken by a circuitous route to the prisoner. Eventually they arrive at a dungeon where the blindfold is removed, and {{in the dim light}} the priest sees an old dying man. The jailer respectfully addresses the prisoner as [...] "Mon prince" [...] and announces the arrival of the holy man. [...] "What do I care?" [...] replies the prisoner. The priest calls upon him to repent his sins. The prisoner declares at length that he has been imprisoned since he was a child, and effectively has had no life. In the dim light the priest realizes with shock that he cannot see the face of the prisoner, since it is covered by an iron mask. At this point the priest remembers from his youth being told of a state prisoner, who succeeded in casting off his mask and attempting to flee. Those around caught a glimpse of a handsome young man bearing a resemblance to the king of France. He was quickly subdued. A <b>young</b> <b>entrant</b> to a convent testified that he was guiltless, and wrongly sentenced. The priest tells the prisoner that God himself suffered terribly on the cross, and the prisoner's sorrows would open the gates of heaven to him, would he just accept God. The priest fails. The prisoner becomes delirious, and dies unshriven. The priest is desolate, and stays on praying to God to forgive him for his failure. The poem ends with the priest seeing with horror that the outline of the mask projects through the shroud, and even in death the prisoner has no release.|$|E

30|$|A {{number of}} further issues arise when the {{public-private}} pay gap is not constant across income levels. A large starting pay gap would attract more competent <b>young</b> <b>entrants</b> {{into the public}} service but also exacerbate queuing phenomena and early-career turnover. For a given overall pay gap, it would also mean that the public-private differential diminishes or becomes negative at higher levels of income, encouraging turnover at the more senior level or, worse still, discouragement and underperformance. On the other hand, steep profiles (relative to those prevailing in the private sector) may fail to attract liquidity-constrained but competent <b>young</b> <b>entrants</b> {{and those that do}} enter the public service may never wish to leave.|$|R

40|$|Even though Japan and Switzerland are characterised by {{comparatively}} low {{youth unemployment}} rates, non-standard forms of employment {{are on the}} rise, posing a risk to the stable integration of <b>young</b> labour market <b>entrants.</b> Drawing on the French approach of societal analysis, this paper investigates how country-specific school-to-work transition systems stratify the risk of non-standard employment in early career differently in Japan and Switzerland. Our results reveal that in Japan <b>young</b> <b>entrants</b> who completed university education are least at risk of becoming employed in non-standard work. On the contrary, it is the highly educated university graduates who mainly enter the labour market via non-standard employment in Switzerland, where vocational education promotes smooth transitions into standard employment relationships. Our {{findings suggest that the}} transition systems of the two countries differ in the way they revert to non-standard forms of employment. However, while job insecurities may not endanger labour market integration of highly skilled university graduates holding good career prospects in Switzerland, they may go hand in hand with social exclusion processes for the low-educated <b>young</b> <b>entrants</b> lacking bargaining power in the segmented Japanese labour market...|$|R

The {{results show that}} expected gains in initial earnings provide <b>young</b> <b>entrants</b> to the labor force with a marked incentive to migrate from their non-metropolitan counties of origin. Initial earnings gains stem, in part, from higher returns to schooling in both metropolitan areas and other non-metropolitan counties. The propensity to migrate is also sensitive to the costs of migration, which, in turn, are correlated with paternal education and the local presence of extended family.

40|$|Workshop 2. Session B. Abstract Essential {{differences}} between generations in wealth accumulation and indebtedness can arise {{as a result}} of structural system changes. This happened in the Finnish housing finance system {{at the turn of the}} millennium. The traditional characteristics and problems of the housing mortgage system changed radically. Older generations used to pay their housing loans in 5 - 10 years, for the young generation the loan period for purchasing their homes can be 30 years or more, but under 20 years, on the average, though. This paper estimates the possible negative effects from this, which poses a growing risk of overindebtedness for <b>young</b> <b>entrants</b> to the housing market. We use in our analysis the data from Statistics Finland 9 ̆ 2 s Wealth Surveys from 1998 and 2004. Very low current interest rates tempt new entrants to the housing market to take big loans. In the Risk Society, <b>young</b> <b>entrants</b> to the housing market are themselves responsible for forecasting the future. When housing is distributed through the market mechanism, the risks are passed on to the market actors and especially to young people. In a time that emphasises individuality, the individuals must also be able to calculate very complicated risks. The differences in wealth, and especially in indebtedness, between generations are growing. New home owners are highly mortgaged and pay a high share of their income for housing, and will continue to do so for decades with the longer loan periods. Rising interest rates are a risk not yet fully realised in Finland...|$|R
