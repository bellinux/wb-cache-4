The image of the Cat balancing many objects on his body while in turn balancing himself on a ball has been included in political cartoons and articles. Political caricaturists have portrayed both Bill Clinton and George W. Bush in this way. In 2004, MAD magazine published [...] "The Strange Similarities Between the Bush Administration and the World of Dr. Seuss", an article which matched quotes from White House officials to excerpts taken from Dr. Seuss books, and in which George W. Bush's State of the Union promises were contrasted with the Cat vowing (in part), [...] "I can hold up the cup and the milk and the cake! [...] I can hold up these books! [...] And the fish on a rake!" [...] In 2007, during the 110th Congress, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid compared the impasse over a bill to reform immigration with the mess created by the Cat. He read lines of the book from the Senate floor. He then carried forward his analogy hoping the impasse would be straightened out for [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> read Dr. Seuss, the cat manages {{to clean up the}} mess."

500|$|... "Rock Show", {{the first}} season finale of Parks and Recreation was written by Norm Hiscock and {{directed}} by series co-founder Michael Schur. Schur said he felt [...] "Rock Show" [...] marked a change in tone for the series and struck a better balance between personal and professional stories {{than any of the}} other episodes from the season. Schur said: [...] "We treated that whole six-episode season like a pilot. If <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> watch those episodes now, you can see us making changes. The sixth episode is different in tone than the first. And we made some character tweaks, like every show ever does". Amy Poehler said she believed [...] "Rock Show" [...] would end what she described as the inevitable comparisons between Parks and Recreation and The Office, which is also produced by Parks creators Schur and Greg Daniels. Poehler said, [...] "I think it was something we had to work through in the beginning, and I’m kind of hoping we’re on the other side of that and people will start to judge the show on its own, for what it is and realize it’s just a completely different world in a similar style.” Schur made his directorial debut with [...] "Rock Show", and had only one day of preparation before directing the episode. While preparing to direct the episode, Schur was asked to make an appearance on The Office as Mose Schrute, the cousin of Dwight Schrute and a popular minor character, in the fifth season finale episode, [...] "Company Picnic". Schur regretfully declined because he needed the time to work on [...] "Rock Show", leading Office episode writers Paul Lieberstein and Jennifer Celotta to create the character Rolf, Dwight's friend played by James Urbaniak, as an alternative.|$|E
2500|$|On the {{television}} show Roger Ebert & the Movies, director Martin Scorsese named Eyes Wide Shut his fourth-favorite film of the 1990s. For the introduction to Michel Ciment's Kubrick: The Definitive Edition, Scorsese wrote: [...] "When Eyes Wide Shut came out {{a few months after}} Stanley Kubrick's death in 1999, it was severely misunderstood, which came as no surprise. If <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> look at the contemporary reactions to any Kubrick picture (except the earliest ones), you'll see that all his films were initially misunderstood. Then, after five or ten years came the realization that [...] or Barry Lyndon or The Shining was like nothing else before or since." [...] Mystery writer and commentator Jon Breen agreed. In 2012, Slant Magazine ranked the film as the second greatest of the 1990s. The BBC listed it number 61 in its list of the 100 greatest American films of all time.|$|E

I think if <b>you</b> were to <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> try to find and review the {{ratification}} of the 16th amendment, which was the internal revenue, income tax, I think if <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> examined that carefully, you would find that a sufficient number of states never ratified that amendment ... And nonetheless, I think it's fair to say that it is part of the Constitution of the United States, and I don't think any court would ever...set it aside.|$|R

6000|$|Now {{the wish}} of the Jews all along, and {{especially}} in Ezekiel's time, was {{to be like the}} heathen--like the nations round them. They said to themselves: [...] "These heathen worship idols, and yet prosper very well. Their having gods of wood and stone, and their indulging their passions, and being profligate and filthy, covetous, unjust, and tyrannical, does not prevent their being just as happy as we are--ay, and a great deal happier. They have no strict law of Moses, as we have threatening us and keeping us in awe, and making us uncomfortable, and telling us at every turn, 'Thou shalt not do this pleasant thing, and thou shalt not do that pleasant thing.' And yet God does not punish them, as Moses' law says He will punish us. These Assyrians and Babylonians above all--they are stronger than we, and richer, and better clothed, and cleverer; they have horses and chariots, and all sorts of luxuries and comforts which we Jews cannot get. Instead of being like us, in continual trouble from earthquakes, and drought, and famine, and war, attacked, plundered by all the nations round us, one after another, they go on conquering, and spreading, and succeeding in all they lay their hand to. Look at Babylon," [...] said these foolish Jews, perhaps, to themselves; [...] "a few generations ago it was nothing of a city, and now it is the greatest, richest, and strongest nation in the whole world. God has not punished it for worshipping gods of wood and stone, why should He punish us? These Babylonians have prospered well enough with their gods, why should not we? Perhaps it is these very gods of wood and stone who have helped them to become so great. Why should they not help us? We will worship them, then, and pray to them. We will not give up worshipping our own God, of course, lest we should offend Him; but we will worship Him and the Babylonian idols at the same time; then we shall be sure to be right if we have Jehovah and the idols both on our side." [...] So said the Jews to themselves. But what did Ezekiel answer them? [...] "Not so, my foolish countrymen," [...] said he, [...] "God will not have it so. He has taught you that these Babylonian idols are nothing and cannot help you; He has taught you that He can and will help you, that He can and will be everything to you; He has taught you that He alone is God, who made heaven and earth, who orders all things therein, who alone gives any people power to get wealth; and He will not have <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> fall from that for any appearances or arguments whatsoever, because it is true. He has chosen you to witness to these heathen about Him, to declare His name to them, that they may give up their idols and serve the true God, in whom alone is strength. He chose you to be these heathens' teachers, and He will not let you become their scholars. He meant the heathen to copy you, and He will not let you copy them. If He does, in His love and mercy, let these poor heathen prosper in spite of their idols, what is that to you? It is still the Lord who makes them prosper, and not the idols, whether they know it or not. They know no better, and He will not impute sin to them where He has given them no law. But you do know better; by a thousand mighty signs and wonders and deliverances, the Lord has been teaching you ever since you came up through the Red Sea, that He is all-sufficient for you, that all power is His in heaven and earth. He has promised to you, and sworn to you by Himself, that if you keep His law and walk in His commandments, you shall want no manner of good thing; that you shall have no cause to envy these heathen their riches and prosperity, for the Lord will bless you in house and land, by day and night, at home and abroad, with every blessing that a nation can desire. Moses' law tells you this, God's prophets have been telling you this, God's wonderful dealings with you have been telling you this, that the Lord God is enough for you. And if you, who are meant to be a nation of kings and priests to God, to teach all nations and serve solely Him, fancy that you will be allowed to throw away the high honour which God has put upon you, and lower yourselves to the follies and sins of these heathen round you, you are mistaken. You were meant to be above such folly, you can be above it; and you shall not prosper by serving God and idols at once; you shall not even prosper by serving idols alone. God will visit you with a mighty hand, and with fury poured out, and you shall know that He is the Lord." ...|$|E
