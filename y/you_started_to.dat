6000|$|DEAR MR. FULTON,--I remember, {{as if it}} were yesterday, {{that when}} I disembarked from the {{overland}} stage in front of the Ormsby in Carson City in August, 1861, I was not expecting to be asked to come again. I was tired, discouraged, white with alkali dust, and did not know anybody; and if you had said then, [...] "Cheer up, desolate stranger, don't be down-hearted--pass on, and come again in 1905," [...] you cannot think how grateful I would have been and how gladly I would have closed the contract. Although I was not expecting to be invited, I was watching out for it, and was hurt and disappointed when <b>you</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> ask me and changed it to, [...] "How soon are you going away?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{murmur of}} admiring comment was, however, {{broken by a}} burly-bearded miner who sat in the middle seat. [...] "Thet's pretty fair, {{as far as it}} goes," [...] he said smilingly, [...] "but I reckon it wouldn't go far ef <b>you</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> run. I've got a simpler game than that, gentlemen, and ez we're all friends here, and the danger's over, I don't mind tellin' ye. The first thing these yer road agents do, after they've covered the driver with their shot guns, is to make the {{passengers}} get out and hold up their hands. That, ma'am,"--explanatorily to the lady, who betrayed only a languid interest,--"is to keep 'em from drawing their revolvers. A revolver is the last thing a road agent wants, either in a man's hand or in his holster. So I sez to myself, 'Ef a six-shooter ain't of no account, wet's the use of carryin' it?' So I just put my shooting-iron in my valise when I travel, and fill my holster with my gold dust, so! It's a deuced sight heavier than a revolver, but they don't feel its weight, and don't keer to come nigh it. And I've been 'held up' twice on t'other side of the Divide this year, and I passed free every time!" ...|$|E
6000|$|There was {{a second}} of painful silence, and the lady continued: [...] "I am staying at the mill alone, for my husband {{has gone to the}} Laguna de Bay on business. Several hours ago, these two {{soldiers}} came in and demanded that I serve them with a hot supper. Not wishing to have trouble I gave them the best I had. But they were not satisfied, and broke into my husband's wine closet and drank two bottles of his choicest wine, and smoked his best cigarettes, package after package. Then, after drinking much wine, they demanded that I give them money, and that man," [...] pointing to the older prisoner, [...] "told his companion that I must have money hidden somewhere, as all the Spanish mill-owners in Luzon were rich, while the truth is, we are very poor, as the war has taken away everything. Then the men drank more, and at last they caught hold of me and threatened me with great violence if I did not give up what I had hidden away. I gave them the little silver I had, but they were not satisfied, and when I tried to run away, one hit me over the head with this bench. Then they plotted {{to get me out of}} the way entirely and go on a hunt for money themselves. I cried louder than ever, and then <b>you</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> come in. One of the men had opened that trap leading to the river, and as you came up the outer stairs both dropped me down, no doubt to drown me. I was swept down to the rocks at the falls, and there the capitan saved me, God bless him for it." ...|$|E

But its glory, after enduring in great splendor for a season, has now vanished—at least its Long Island Railroad glory has. The tunnel: dark as the grave, cold, damp, and silent. How beautiful look earth and heaven again, as we emerge from the gloom! It might not be unprofitable, now and then, to send us mortals—the dissatisfied ones, at least, and that's a large proportion—into some tunnel of several days' journey. We'd perhaps grumble less, afterward, at God's handiwork.|$|E

When I started to feel like this I stayed up the night praying to Allah and supplicating.

I did not finish supplicating before Abu Jaffar Mohammad the son of Ali blessings be upon them came to me and said: Oh Abu Salt, <b>you</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> feel uncomfortable?

5000|$|Shortly {{after his}} army experience, Toomik {{enrolled}} in the art academy in Tallinn, where between 1985 and 1991 he studied in the faculty of painting. Some large-scale paintings with openly Neo-Expressionist brushwork have survived from that time (e.g. Menstruation, 1989; Dancer, 1990). The artist described himself as being heavily influenced by Jorge Luis Borges in those days: “the perception of identity was different during the Soviet era. /…/ We all lived in some other world. Even geographically we transferred ourselves somewhere else. /…/ However, during the Singing Revolution (1988) <b>you</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> identify with this land and nation.” A good example could be Toomik’s temporal installation Bed 75 (1993), located in the centre of Tallinn for one month, which consisted of 75 iron beds, bought by the artist from the Russian military bases - then still located all around the newly independent Estonia. Through painting, Toomik had gradually found his way to performance art and then to installation art and site-specific art, actually abandoning painting altogether, albeit {{for a short period}} of time. His interest in installations marks an important move in his professional career. An art historian, artist and curator Hanno Soans has even suggested that “many of Toomik's fans among foreign curators have not properly digested his early development story, the way the Neo-Expressionist painter converted himself to a modern Post-Conceptual installation and video artist.” ...|$|E
5000|$|Hibberd {{echoed the}} show's producers' {{statement}} that [...] "the move lays down a dramatic {{precedent for the}} show: Nobody is safe." [...] He called it a [...] "risky" [...] move that would probably lose the show viewers who had tuned in for Bean, but would hopefully attract others impressed by the boldness of it. Executive producer and writer D. B. Weiss told Entertainment Weekly in 2011 that when he and Benioff pitched the series to HBO, the fact that [...] "main character" [...] Ned was slated to die [...] "was a selling point for them." [...] Noting that the network has killed off characters in other successful series, he said that this sense of jeopardy [...] "completely ups the ante for any moment when a character is in a dire situation if you know another character didn't survive a similar situation." [...] HBO programming president Sue Naegle concurred, saying that Ned's death made the show creatively more attractive, adding that [...] "The book series was filled with unexpected twists and turns. I loved this idea we'd bring together the group of characters, then once <b>you</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> believe all the tropes of heroes, you pull the rug out from under them. It's the opposite of feeling manipulated." [...] Noting that the story and world of the series is bigger than any one character, Naegle said, [...] "Sean brings a giant following, but Thrones {{is not just about}} the promise you're going to see one of your favorite actors week in and week out. The star is the story." [...] Bean noted that Ned's death [...] "was as much a surprise to me as anyone" [...] and called it [...] "a very courageous move for a television company." ...|$|E
