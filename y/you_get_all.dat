500|$|When it was renewed for {{a second}} season, Veronica Mars became the lowest-rated show in network history to be renewed and the only UPN drama from the 2004-05 {{television}} season to be renewed. Starting in the second season, Veronica Mars was moved to Wednesday nights, placing it in direct competition with ABC's popular Lost. Rob Thomas said that, [...] "I wish the juggernaut that is Lost wasn't our direct competition." [...] At the same time, Veronica Mars was placed after UPN's America's Next Top Model. On {{the date of the}} airing of this episode, Bell and Thomas talked to The New York Times, where Thomas commented, [...] "We let Veronica say things that, if <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>all</b> day to think about it, would be the perfect retort." ...|$|E

Linehan also said that, being a special event, the musical would {{need to focus on}} a [...] "world-shaking" [...] story, possibly with Ted becoming Pope due to [...] "some weird succession thing". In June, Linehan said that he hoped The Divine Comedy frontman Neil Hannon, who wrote the show's music, would return to compose the songs.|$|E
2500|$|Because of its {{themes of}} fornication, drug addiction, prostitution, violence, and murder, Porgy and Bess {{proved to be}} {{difficult}} to cast. Many black actors felt the story did nothing but perpetuate negative stereotypes. Harry Belafonte thought the role of Porgy was demeaning and declined it. So many performers refused to participate in the project that Goldwyn actually considered Jackie Robinson, Sugar Ray Robinson and singer Clyde McPhatter for major roles. [...] Only Las Vegas entertainer Sammy Davis, Jr. expressed interest in appearing in the film, and arranged to audition for a role during a party at Judy Garland's home. Ira Gershwin's wife Lee was present and, horrified by Davis' vulgarity, implored Goldwyn, [...] "Swear on your life you'll never use him." [...] The producer, who sneeringly called Davis [...] "that monkey," [...] assured her he would not cast him and offered the role of Sportin' Life to Cab Calloway instead. When Calloway declined, Davis had Frank Sinatra and some of his associates pressure Goldwyn, who finally announced to Davis, [...] "The part is yours. Now will <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>all</b> these guys off my back?" ...|$|E
