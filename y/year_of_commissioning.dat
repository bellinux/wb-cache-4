5000|$|In the {{aftermath}} of World War II Congress drafted legislation that attempted to address three (sometimes competing) objectives: create [...] "uniform" [...] rules for officer management between Army and Navy (and later Air Force), promote a [...] "young and vigorous" [...] officer corps, and retain the capacity to rapidly remobilize if needed. In 1947 Congress consolidated Army and Navy officer management legislation into the Officer Personnel Act (OPA). With the encouragement of the Army (notably by General Dwight Eisenhower) OPA extended the [...] "up or out" [...] system across the military, requiring officers to go before promotion boards at set times based on cohorts (normally based on <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>commissioning).</b> OPA also ended the practice of appointing Army officers into specific [...] "branches", giving the Army greater authority to move personnel to different functions and change organizational designs. OPA also authorized the services to grant voluntary retirement at 20 years of commissioned service.|$|E
50|$|The {{airfield}} {{was abandoned}} {{after the war}} and lay unused until the 1980s, when it was transferred to the Indian Navy who rehabilitated and commissioned the airfield as INS Rajali.INS Rajali was commissioned on 11 March 1992. The commissioning commanding officer was Captain RS Vasan, who subsequently retired in the rank of commodore while on deputation to the Coast Guard as the Regional Commander of Coast Guard Region East. Rajali, named after a bird, was commissioned by then President Sri Venkataraman. The upgraded airbase became home to an anti-submarine warfare squadron, INAS 312, which moved here from INS Hansa in Goa. On 16 April 1988, the Tupolev Tu-142MK-E aircraft were commissioned into the squadron by the then Defence Minister, Shri K. C. Pant, at INS Hansa. The Albatross as they are called celebrated the silver jubilee of induction at Rajali. The replacement aircraft for the TU 142 M are P8i Poseidon and eight of them have started operating from Rajali. The Helicopter Training School which operated from INS Garuda was shifted to Rajali from July 1991 in the <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>commissioning</b> itself and has been training rotary-wing pilots of the Navy and the Coast Guard ever since. This self-contained base will be celebrating its silver jubilee on 11 March 2017.|$|E

The dam was built to a height of 59.13 m (above the river bed level) between 1947 (start of construction) and 1965 (<b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>commissioning).</b> It has a gross storage capacity of 2.025 km3, live storage of 63.00 BCF at full reservoir level and a dead storage of 8.50 BCF at RL (reservoir level) of 631.54 m. The storage created by the reservoir is according to the allocation of 61.70 BCF (1.747 km3 including direct evaporation of 0.14 km3) of water made under the Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal Award. The dam is built on a shattered rock based with a central masonry spillway. It has an earthen embankment on the left side and a rock hillock on the opposite side. The Ogee type spillway in the middle section of the river has been provided with four numbers of vertical lift gates over a width of 18.28 m and designed for a discharge of /s. In addition, two number river sluices are also provided to pass a discharge of /s. The annual siltation load considered in the design is 10.78 million cubic feet per square kilometer of catchment area. The canal outlets provided in the dam, initially for Hydropower generation followed by irrigation, consists of the left Bank canal outlet to discharge /s and two right bank canal outlets to pass a discharge of /s.

40|$|In {{the current}} era of {{deregulated}} electricity markets, the power distribution systems have attained {{a very important}} and {{crucial role in the}} industry. A distribution company (referred to as a disco) plays an active and effective role in electricity markets, and can positively impact the market efficiency and make it more reliable, secure and beneficial to customers. Therefore, operation and planning issues of discos in such electricity market environment requires extensive analysis and research in order to improve their operational strategies both in the short-term and long-term. A generic operations framework for a disco operating in a competitive electricity market environment is presented in the thesis. The operations framework is a two-stage hierarchical model in which the first stage deals with disco’s activities in the day-ahead stage, the Day Ahead Operations Model (DAOM). The second stage deals with disco’s activities in real-time and is termed Real-Time Operations Model (RTOM). The DAOM determines the disco’s operational decisions on grid purchase, scheduling of distributed generation (DG) units owned by it, and contracting for interruptible load. These decisions are imposed as boundary constraints in the RTOM and the disco seeks to minimize its short-term costs keeping in mind its day-ahead decisions. A case-study is presented considering the well-known 33 -bus distribution system and three different scenarios are constructed to analyze the disco’s actions and decision-making in this context. The thesis presents a new paradigm for distribution system operation taking into account the presence of DG sources and their goodness factors. The proposed concept of goodness factor of DG units is based on the computation of the incremental contribution of a DG unit to distribution system losses. The incremental contributions of a DG unit to active and reactive power losses in the distribution system are termed as the active / reactive Incremental Loss Indices (ILI). The goodness factors are integrated directly into the distribution system operations model. This model seeks to minimize the disco’s energy costs in the short-term taking into account the contribution (goodness factor) of each DG unit. The analysis was carried out considering an 18 -bus distribution network, considering two different ownership structures of DG units, and a 69 -bus distribution system considering specific characteristics of wind-DG units. The concept of goodness factors is further extended to determine a new set of goodness factors pertaining to a DG’s impact on feeder unloading by virtue of its power injection. A novel long-term planning model has been developed for the disco that considers investments in DG capacity, distribution system feeder addition / expansion and substation transformers capacity addition. The model includes the new set of goodness factors pertaining to both loss reduction and feeder unloading and arrives at an optimal set of new expansion plan, with specified locations, and <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>commissioning.</b> The work clearly demonstrates the effectiveness and contribution of DG units in distribution systems both in the short-term and long-term framework...|$|E
