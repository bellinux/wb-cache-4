500|$|Following {{the first}} three verses of {{advertising}} slogans, the song continues with the lyrics [...] "I have no compass, and I have no map" [...] and [...] "No reason to get back", referring to {{the uncertainty of the}} new direction of U2's music at the time. [...] The following verse begins with, [...] "And I have no religion", which was included in the lyrics because Bono stated that he believes [...] "religion is the enemy of God." [...] A review of the album in Melody Maker compared the lyric [...] "Uncertainty can be a guiding light" [...] {{towards the end of the}} song to the line [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>walk</b> <b>away,</b> [...] I will follow" [...] from U2's 1980 single [...] "I Will Follow". The reviewer stated [...] "The man (Bono) that once had so many answers now sounds simply confused." [...] The theme of moral confusion was first used in U2's song [...] "Acrobat" [...] from Achtung Baby. The coda in [...] "Zooropa" [...] features the lyric [...] "dream out loud", which Bono included as a reference to [...] "Acrobat". The phrase [...] "dream out loud" [...] was first used by Bono during the Lovetown Tour in 1989, and has appeared several times in U2's work since then. The phrase was also used in the song [...] "Always"– a B-side to the [...] "Beautiful Day" [...] single released in 2000 — and was spoken by Bono in the [...] video.|$|E

500|$|Q {{magazine}} {{gave the}} album {{four out of}} five stars, stating [...] "It speaks volumes for Pearl Jam's continuing creative acumen that they can respond so confidently to a new punk scene that has sprung up." [...] Robert Christgau of The Village Voice gave the album an A- rating, writing that [...] "Three or four of these songs are faster and riffier than anything else in P. Jam's book, token experiments like [...] "Bugs" [...] are genuinely weird, and in an era of compulsory irony [...] sincerity is something like a relief—a Kurtlike relief at that." [...] David Browne of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B+. He said, [...] "Vitalogy marks the first time it's possible to respect the band's music as much as its stance." [...] He added that [...] "despite its musical advances, Vitalogy leaves an odd, unsettling aftertaste. <b>You</b> <b>walk</b> <b>away</b> from it energized, but wondering what price Eddie Vedder, and Pearl Jam, will ultimately pay for it." [...] Chicago Sun-Times writer Jim DeRogatis gave it three out of four stars and commended Pearl Jam for their earnest songwriting. However, DeRogatis also wrote that the album [...] "leaves you wishing that they'd just lighten up". USA Todays Edna Gundersen gave Vitalogy three and a half out of four stars and stated that it [...] "delivers the band's most compelling, inventive and confident music to date", while calling it [...] "the rebel yell of a band that is maturing without mellowing". Los Angeles Times critic Robert Hilburn gave Vitalogy four out of four stars and viewed its music as an improvement over Pearl Jam's previous work, writing [...] "This isn't just the best Pearl Jam album but a better album than the band once even seemed capable of making". AllMusic staff writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album four and a half out of five stars, saying, [...] "Pearl Jam are at their best when they're fighting, whether it's Ticketmaster, fame, or their own personal demons." [...] According to The New Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), [...] "By Vitalogy PJ hit their apex … the band's creative zenith, finding them doing a Led Zeppelin III on acoustic tracks like 'Corduroy' and turning in a Tom Waits-like weird attack on 'Bugs'".|$|E
