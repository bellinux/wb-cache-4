500|$|Keeping in {{line with}} the most {{prominent}} theme of Beyoncé, [...] "Rocket" [...] explores frank female sexuality. It opens with Beyoncé expressing feelings of lust in the first line, [...] "Let me sit this assssss [...] on ya" [...] for which she adopts a soft and sultry vocal style. She further sings about love-making with a male lover and the second line includes the lyrics: [...] "Let me take this off while you watch me / that's my'ass appeal". It features explicit and metaphorical lyrics throughout and sees Beyoncé instructing her love interest to watch her perform a striptease. She further talks about how their evening together is going to proceed with lyrics such as [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> can touch it babe, do you wanna touch it baby?".|$|E
500|$|Lacking {{clues about}} the mysterious {{disappearance}} of the two men, Fink and Stoolie attend a special sunset celebration at the shop, during which Seymour is to be presented with the trophy and Audrey Jr.'s buds are expected to open. As the attendees look on, four buds open and inside each flower {{is the face of}} one of the plant's victims. As the crowd breaks out in shock and fright, Fink and Stoolie realize Seymour is their culprit who flees from the shop with the police in hot pursuit. Managing to lose them in a junkyard filled with tires, sinks and toilets with the help of Mushnick who followed along, Seymour eventually makes his way back to Mushnick's shop which is now empty. Audrey Jr. demands, [...] "Feed me!" [...] Seymour curses the plant for ruining his life. He grabs a kitchen knife and climbs into Audrey Jr.'s maw, saying, [...] "I'll feed <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> never been fed before!" ...|$|E
500|$|The stereo {{version of}} the song has an organ moving from speaker to speaker; the effect is lost on the mono {{version of the}} song, where it simply gains an extra organ and guitar sound. However, the organ is very {{prominent}} during the first 50 seconds of the mono version—along with some special effects—but inaudible in the stereo mix until the improvised section. Five takes of the song were originally recorded on 27 February 1967, with a sixth later recorded on 16 March 1967, {{in an attempt to}} create a shorter version, with overdubs in June of that year, the Piper version also appears on the official compilation albums Relics and A Nice Pair. Despite Smith trying to bring the rest of the album's tracks from a jam-long length to something more manageable, Smith relented for [...] "Interstellar Overdrive", as Jenner recalled: [...] "It was definitely the deal that—hey, here you can do 'Interstellar Overdrive', you can do what <b>you</b> <b>like,</b> <b>you</b> can do your weird shit. So 'Interstellar Overdrive' was the weird shit [...] [...] [...] and again, hats off to Norman for letting them do that." [...] A delay effect was created by producer Norman Smith by superimposing a second version of the song over a previous version. Smith played the drum roll on the song. After the drum roll, the opening riff is played with severe stereo panning.|$|E

[...] Ted discussed the matter with the other selectors and the decision was to ignore my advice, and play Len, Brian and myself. It was a farce. The pitch didn't have a blade of grass on it and I was reduced to bowling off-cutters, but I couldn't pitch them slow enough to have much effect.|$|E

[...] for Alice In Chains' second album Dirt in Wood's memory. He also {{dedicated}} Alice In Chains' debut album Facelift to Wood, {{as well as}} his late mother. Speaking with Spin magazine in 1991, Cantrell confirmed that the song [...] "Sunshine" [...] from Facelift was written about his mother's death. “When I was a little kid, I'd always tell her, “I'll be famous and buy you a house and you'll never have to work again. I'll take care of <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> took care of me.’ When she passed away, it was a really sh–ty time for me. I didn't {{know how to deal with}} it then, and I still don't. But it gave me the impetus to do what I'm doing.” Gloria is also mentioned in the song [...] "Rooster".|$|E

2500|$|I {{was walking}} {{about in a}} town which I did not know. [...] I saw streets and squares which were strange to me. [...] Then I came into a house where I lived, went to my room, and found a letter from Mother lying there. [...] She wrote saying that as I had left home without my parents' {{knowledge}} she had not wished to write to me to say Father was ill. [...] "Now he is dead, and if <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> can come." [...] I {{then went to the}} station and asked about a hundred times: [...] "Where is the station?" [...] I always got the answer: [...] "Five minutes." [...] I then saw a thick wood before me which I went into, and there I asked a man whom I met. [...] He said to me: [...] "Two and a half hours more." [...] He offered to accompany me. [...] But I refused and went alone. I saw the station {{in front of me and}} could not reach it. [...] At the same time, I had the unusual feeling of anxiety that one has in dreams when one cannot move forward. Then I was at home. I must have been travelling in the meantime, but I knew nothing about that. I walked into the porter's lodge, and enquired for our flat. The maidservant opened the door to me and replied that Mother and the others were already at the cemetery.|$|E
