25|$|Historic Native American flutes are {{generally}} tuned to {{a variation of}} the minor pentatonic scale (such as <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> playing the black keys on a piano), which gives the instrument its distinctive plaintive sound. Recently some makers have begun experimenting with different scales, giving players new melodic options. Also, modern flutes {{are generally}} tuned in concert keys (such as A or D) {{so that they can be}} easily played with other instruments. The root keys of modern Native American flutes span a range of about three and a half octaves, from C2 to A5.|$|E

[...] Wanderone would go virtually anywhere to help promote the game, and he was a crowd-pleaser.|$|E
500|$|As films {{featuring}} prurient elements {{performed well}} at the box office, after the crackdown on crime films, Hollywood increased its production of pictures featuring the seven deadly sins. In 1932, Warner Bros formed an official policy decreeing that [...] "two out of five stories should be hot", and that nearly all films could benefit by [...] "adding something {{having to do with}} ginger." [...] Filmmakers (including the shrewd Mae West) began putting in overly suggestive material they knew would never reach theaters in hopes that lesser offenses would survive the cutting-room floor. MGM screenwriter Donald Ogden Stewart said [...] " [...] wouldn't want to take out too much, so you would give them five things to take out to satisfy the Hays Office—and <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> away with murder with what they left in." ...|$|E

He later recalled, [...] "I thought people in those conditions would have very, very, reduced language—they wouldn't be really a verbal society any more, and I think we're heading towards that. Television is mainly responsible for it, the fact that people are now conditioned to image. The pictures they see on television screens more and more dominate their thinking, as far as people do a lot of thinking, and if you had a verbally reduced society, <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> the kind of language—possibly—that you did get in the play".|$|E

[...] Armstrong commented, [...] "Right now we're refraining from pulling out a lot of that 'Nimrod' stuff. We want to make things small. We don't want to bring a horn section or a violin player out with us. A {{lot of people want to}} hear the old stuff, and that stuff is still just as significant to us." [...] The band also decided to play small theaters instead of stadiums and festivals, as Armstrong explained that they felt better to [...] "go to a place like The Fillmore and The Warfield and know it's actually going to sell out" [...] instead of playing to half-empty large venues. The Nimrod tour marked the first time the band performed its now-routine ritual of inviting audience members onstage to play instruments. [...] During the tour, Armstrong felt that he became a better performer, noting, [...] "I think some people walk away from a Green Day concert with the emotions <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> from some kind of theater performance where the crowd feels involved — where it's not just about the singer. It's not just about the band." ...|$|E
500|$|On 20January, a {{force of}} over 100Japanese aircraft, {{comprising}} bombers, dive bombers and fighter escort, converged on Rabaul. It was led by Commander Mitsuo Fuchida, who had controlled the attack on Pearl Harbor on 7December 1941. Two patrolling Wirraways of No.24 Squadron attacked {{the first wave of}} Japanese raiders. Lerew's six remaining Wirraways then scrambled, one crashing on take-off. Of the seven that were airborne, three were shot down into the sea by Mitsubishi Zero fighters, two others crash landed with severe damage, one escaped with minor damage, and one remained unscathed. The ten-minute action killed six RAAF aircrew and wounded five. An Australian soldier on the ground later recalled, [...] "We sat at our guns, shocked by the massacre we had just observed". The Japanese fighters compounded the humiliation by executing aerobatics over the bombed airfield. Lerew signalled headquarters, [...] "Two Wirraways useless defence. Will you now please send some fighters?", receiving the reply, [...] "Regret inability to supply fighters. If we had them <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> them." [...] The next day he was ordered to attack the approaching Japanese fleet with [...] "all available aircraft". As his two serviceable Wirraways had no bomb racks, this left only the one remaining Hudson with which to execute the order; it duly took off to search for the enemy ships but was unable to locate them by nightfall, and returned to base.|$|E
500|$|Total Films review {{gave the}} film 4/5 with its verdict: [...] "The Terminator story recharges with a post-apocalyptic jolt of energy. Frantic {{and full of}} welcome ties to the past, it also ploughs new ground with purpose. Fingers crossed McG will follow Cameron's lead and serve up a worthy sequel." [...] Devin Faraci of Empire {{magazine}} also gave a positive rating of {{four out of five}} stars, saying: [...] "McG has sparked a moribund franchise back to life, giving fans the post-apocalyptic action they've been craving since they first saw a metal foot crush a human skull two decades ago." [...] However, on CHUD, the latter said, [...] "Bale's desire to star as John Connor was probably the most fatal blow to the film; it completely distorted the shape of the story as it existed." [...] Furthermore, he expressed that the third act was when the film began falling apart, saying, [...] "McG and Nolan muddied the end of the picture, delivering action generics (yet another Terminator fight in a factory) while never finding their own hook that would give this movie more of an impact than <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> from an expanded universe novel." [...] In contrast, James Berardinelli considered the ending {{the best part of the}} film, feeling that the first two-thirds were [...] "rambling and disjointed" [...] and that the lack of a central villain was only fixed when the T-800 appeared.|$|E

500|$|Rubano had a bassline that, {{within an}} hour of playing it, became the track [...] "New Again." [...] After writing it, Fazzi said it was a [...] "no-brainer for an opener". O'Connell called it [...] "powerful" [...] and said it [...] "sets the mood" [...] for the album. One day during rehearsals, Fazzi played a guitar riff, then O'Connell played along, {{resulting}} in [...] "Sink into Me." [...] The song begins with cheerleader-esque [...] "hey!"s that Fazzi came up with. Lazzara referred to it as a [...] "freight train. ... if you were {{to stand in front of}} it, <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> pummeled". Lazzara also mentioned that the music to it was [...] "unlike anything we've ever done before. It's real upbeat." [...] For [...] "Lonely, Lonely," [...] Lazzara said it was the [...] "first time that we just turned it up to ten and went with it". With this song, Fazzi said the group wanted something [...] "short, to the point and just punishing from start to finish". The song's bridge had been suggested by Fazzi during his audition for the band. Rubano said the track was [...] "a freight train of rock & roll" [...] and was inspired by Queens of the Stone Age. [...] "Summer, Man" [...] was one of the first songs written for New Again. It was composed during the Projekt Revolution tour, and consisted originally of a bridge guitar riff by Reyes. Rubano said it was the band's take on a Beach Boys-esque song.|$|E
500|$|Most {{reviews of}} [...] "Secret Truths" [...] were positive, {{particularly}} praising {{its treatment of}} social issues. Maureen Ryan wrote for the Chicago Tribune that [...] "The lack of either cutesyness or condescension shown by this program is promising." [...] She also commended that the pilot [...] "doesn't shy away" [...] from issues pertaining to race, religion and sexuality. Kate Authur of The New York Times compared the pilot positively to other series, writing, [...] "If you took the plot of Beverly Hills, 90210 (a good-looking Midwestern family moves to Los Angeles), combined it with the identity issues of Degrassi (race, sexuality and class clash {{in a high school}} setting) and added a splash of One Tree Hills basketball backdrop, <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> South of Nowhere... That's meant to be a compliment." [...] Alessandra Stanley, another critic for The New York Times, mentioned [...] "Secret Truths" [...] in a feature about racial issues on television. She felt that the pilot distinguished itself from other teen shows by including a subplot about race; however, she still found it to be [...] "constrained and politically correct". Varietys Brian Lowry gave the episode a lukewarm review, comparing it to other teen dramas. He wrote that [...] "the web of relationships doesn't feel particularly fresh, mirroring the recent spate of nighttime teen serials", but he felt the pilot was an [...] "edgier treatment", noting that it [...] "isn't screwing around" [...] by addressing topics including abortion, drugs, homosexuality and racism. Karman Kregloe of AfterEllen.com, a website focused on the portrayal of lesbians in the media, thought that the episode was [...] "well-written, and the storyline for each of the lead characters is compelling". She praised the show greatly for its authentic portrayal of teenagers' questioning of their sexuality and the [...] "big step" [...] taken towards promoting tolerance.|$|E

So you would actually get a tax cut on that part. If your revenue is above 250, then from 250 down, your taxes {{are going to stay}} the same. It is true that, say for 250 up— from 250 to 300 or so, so for that additional amount, you'd go from 36 to 39 percent, which is what it was under Bill Clinton." ...|$|E
2500|$|Church of Scientology leader David Miscavige {{appeared}} in his first ever interview with the media on the program Nightline on February 14, 1992, and was interviewed by Ted Koppel. Miscavige stated that he believed Scientology did not [...] "lend itself well to the press", and he criticized a piece on Scientology that aired on Nightline shortly before his interview. In his criticism of the piece, Miscavige asserted that Nightline correspondents had only interviewed members of CAN, stating, [...] "For instance, something that isn't mentioned in there is that every single detractor on there {{is part of a}} religious hate group called Cult Awareness Network and their sister group called American Family Foundation. Now, I don't know if you've heard of these people, but it's the same as the KKK would be with the blacks. I think if you interviewed a neo-Nazi and asked them to talk about the Jews, <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> a similar result to what you have here." [...] Koppel then posited the notion that others critical of Scientology were less apt to come forward and speak publicly due to fears of potential recrimination from the Church. In 1994, the Cult Awareness Network opened a counter-suit against the Church of Scientology, eleven individual Scientologists and the Los Angeles law firm of Bowles and Moxon.|$|E
2500|$|During the pre-code period, {{after the}} {{crack down on}} crime films, {{production}} of films featuring prurient elements increased. Studios began putting in extra suggestive material which they knew would never reach theaters. MGM screenwriter Donald Ogden Stewart said that [...] " [...] wouldn't want to take out too much, so you would give them five things to take out to satisfy the Hays Office—and <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> away with murder with what they left in." [...] In 1932 Warner Brothers' policy was that [...] "two out of five stories should be hot", and that nearly all films could benefit by [...] "adding something {{having to do with}} ginger." [...] Films such as Laughing Sinners, Safe in Hell, The Devil Is Driving, Free Love, Merrily We Go to Hell, Laughter in Hell and The Road to Ruin were provocative in their mere titles. Studios marketed their films, sometimes dishonestly, by coming up with suggestive tag lines and lurid titles, even {{going so far as to}} come up with in house contests for thinking up provocative titles for screenplays. Commonly labeled [...] "sex films" [...] by the censors, these pictures offended taste in more categories than just sexuality. According to a Variety analysis of 440 pictures produced in 1932–33, 352 had [...] "some sex slant", with 145 possessing [...] "questionable sequences", and 44 being [...] "critically sexual"." [...] The trade paper summarized that [...] "over 80% of the world's chief picture output was...flavored with bedroom essence."

2500|$|Due to {{changing}} needs or personal preferences, {{a person may}} {{go back to work}} after retiring. In this case, it is possible to get Social Security retirement or survivors benefits and work at the same time. A worker who is of full retirement age or older may (with spouse) keep all benefits, after taxes, regardless of earnings. But, if this worker or the worker's spouse are younger than full retirement age and receiving benefits and earn [...] "too much", the benefits will be reduced. If working under full retirement age for the entire year and receiving benefits, Social Security deducts $1 from the worker's benefit payments for every $2 earned above the annual limit of $15,120 (2013). Deductions cease when the benefits have been reduced to zero and the worker will get one more year of income and age credit, slightly increasing future benefits at retirement. For example, if you were receiving benefits of $1,230/month (the average benefit paid) or $14,760 a year and have an income of $29,520/year above the $15,120 limit ($44,640/year) you would lose all ($14,760) of your benefits. If you made $1,000 more than $15,200/year you would [...] "only lose" [...] $500 in benefits. <b>You</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> no benefits for the months you work until the $1 deduction for $2 income [...] "squeeze" [...] is satisfied. Your first social security check will be delayed for several months—the first check may only be a fraction of the [...] "full" [...] amount. The benefit deductions change in the year you reach full retirement age and are still working—Social Security only deducts $1 in benefits for every $3 you earn above $40,080 in 2013 for that year and has no deduction thereafter. The income limits change (presumably for inflation) year by year.|$|E
