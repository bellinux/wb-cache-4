25|$|The plot is {{centered}} on a bachelor man called Asker, who wants to see and choose his bride before marriage. His wife quest, however, is difficult because in that time (in the 19th century) based on traditions women were kept at home and when allowed out they were heavily covered in hijab and because actually <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> allowed to know who {{you were going to}} get married with in the 19th century. Asker's friend Suleyman suggests him disguising as a fabric peddler, a sure way to meet women. Asker agrees and starts to go round the houses selling fabrics.|$|E
500|$|Smith {{was very}} fond of Lennon, and his softer {{approach}} to parenting was {{in stark contrast to}} his stern wife, who based everything on decorum, honesty, and a black-and-white attitude; either you were good enough or <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>not.</b> Pete Shotton—Lennon's school friend—later commented that [...] "Mimi had a very strong sense of what was right or wrong". In contrast, Smith used to give the young Lennon [...] "squeakers" [...] (kisses) that his wife did not approve of.|$|E
500|$|The Just So Stories {{began as}} bedtime stories told to his {{daughter}} [...] "Effie" [...] when the first three were published in a children’s magazine, a year before her death, Kipling explained: [...] "in the evening there were stories meant to put Effie to sleep, and <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> allowed to alter those by one single little word. They had to be told just so; or Effie would wake up and put back the missing sentence. So at last they came to be like charms, all three of them,—the whale tale, the camel tale, and the rhinoceros tale." ...|$|E

500|$|Adams viewed Paine's Age of Reason {{not as the}} {{embodiment}} of the Enlightenment but as a [...] "betrayal" [...] of it. Despite all of these attacks, Paine never wavered in his beliefs; when he was dying, a woman came to visit him, claiming that God had instructed her to save his soul. [...] Paine dismissed her in the same tones that he had used in The Age of Reason: [...] "pooh, pooh, it is not true. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> sent with any such impertinent message[...] [...] [...] Pshaw, He would not send such a foolish ugly old woman as you about with His message." ...|$|E
500|$|Gold disliked other magazines' use of covers {{with what}} he {{described}} as [...] "shapely female endomorphs with bronze bras, embattled male mesomorphs clad in muscle, and frightful alien monsters in search of a human meal". The cover for the first issue was by David Stone, depicting a scene from Simak's Time Quarry. The image was muted, in contrast to the sensational art typically found on the covers of the sf pulps; the intention was that Galaxy should look like an sf magazine, but one [...] "that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> embarrassed to hold", in the words of Mike Ashley. [...] The early artwork was generally unremarkable, though Ed Emshwiller's humorous cover for the June 1951 issue, his first professional sale as an artist, was a positive sign. [...] "Emsh", as he was known to science fiction readers, soon became a regular contributor. The relatively expensive production processes that Gold had insisted on enabled more sophisticated internal artwork, which could be integrated with type in ways not possible with cheaper letterpress printing.|$|E
500|$|Allard Laban of Jellyvision Games {{noted that}} {{compared}} to 1995, where the pop culture was [...] "fragmented", {{the onset of}} the Internet and social media made it easier to develop questions for the game. At the same time, with more information and entertainment available, the writers had to be selective about what parts of culture would remain relevant; an example given by Heinrich was that while questions about Seinfeld were okay, questions about Mad About <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>not.</b> Jellyvision Games sought comedy writers, including from local comedy clubs such as Second City and I.O., narrowing down the pool of applicants from hundreds to six, including Second City comedian Tim Sniffen, who had worked on previous iterations of the You Don't Know Jack series. A weekly training process was employed to bring the new writers up to speed and review previously written dialog for possible improvements. Heinrich also assured that material was not repeated throughout the game's script. Heinrich estimates that each question in the game was a result of about two hours of work.|$|E

2500|$|The Lorentz-transform {{calculation}} above uses {{a definition}} of extended-simultaneity (i.e. of when and where events occur at which <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> present) that might {{be referred to as}} the co-moving or [...] "tangent free-float-frame" [...] definition. This definition is naturally extrapolated to events in gravitationally-curved spacetimes, and to accelerated observers, through use of a radar-time/distance definition that (unlike the tangent free-float-frame definition for accelerated frames) assigns a unique time and position to any event.|$|E
2500|$|He criticised the American policy, saying, [...] "You Americans {{with your}} 500,000 {{soldiers}} in Vietnam! <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> defeated...you ran away!" [...] He lambasted US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger for signing the Paris Peace Accords, which the communists violated, {{and which he}} regarded as an American abandonment, stating [...] "I never thought that such a good Secretary of State would produce a treaty that would bring us to our death". Thiệu also blamed the local media and foreign broadcasting organisations for lowering {{the morale of the}} military and the population by reporting on the corruption and setbacks of his government.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the age of}} 24 Scates {{moved from}} player to coach. When the UCLA volleyball coach took a sabbatical, he offered Scates the job. Scates was {{surprised}} but accepted. He then went to meet with Athletic Director Wilbur Johns. [...] "He didn't even tell me to sit down," [...] Scates recalled. [...] "I told him that I cannot accept a salary for coaching volleyball because I {{wanted to be in}} the Olympics in 1964, and at that time if you coached a sport for money or played for money <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> considered an amateur and couldn't participate in the Olympics.

2500|$|The {{scale of}} the {{controversy}} intensified when the Church of Scientology released a 40-second clip of video footage showing a screaming argument between John Sweeney and Scientologist Tommy Davis over {{the way in which}} Sweeney was interviewing critics of Scientology. In the clip, Sweeney yells [...] "You were not there {{at the beginning of the}} interview! <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> there! You did not hear or record all the interview!" [...] at Davis in reference to an interview Sweeney recorded with Scientology critic Shawn Lonsdale. Despite the Church of Scientology's lobbying British MPs to have the documentary scrapped, its first airing went ahead on 14 May. With a peak of 4.9 million viewers in the UK, the episode garnered the highest ratings for Panorama since September the previous year.|$|E
2500|$|Despite Claire’s open {{disdain for}} her sister, {{she has never}} told Agnes about Tobias’s affair. It is not clear if she does this out of love or out of spite. She keeps the affair a secret, {{almost as if she}} has a hidden weapon that she protects in case she may have to use it one day. When Agnes comes right out and asks Claire to confirm her suspicions about Tobias, Claire’s answer is, “Ya got me, Sis.” Shortly after this exchange, Agnes {{describes}} Claire in this way: “Claire could tell us so much if she cared to [...] [...] [...] Claire, who watches from the sidelines, has seen so very much, has seen us all so clearly [...] [...] [...] <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> named for nothing.” Claire is said to closely resemble Albee’s aunt Jane, an alcoholic and frequent visitor to the Albee home.|$|E

2500|$|On October 2, 2016 at a {{press conference}} at Fenway Park, MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said that the {{anonymous}} drug test in 2003 were inconclusive because [...] "it was hard to distinguish between certain substances that were legal, available over the counter, and not banned under our program." [...] Manfred argued that [...] "it was important to make people understand that even if your name was on that list, that it was entirely possible that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> a positive". Furthermore, Manfred sustained that the 2003 test was supposed to be confidential and it would be unfair to judge players based on [...] "leaks, rumors, innuendo, [...] not confirmed positive test results". Manfred finished by stating that Hall of Fame voters should use their best judgment and only consider confirmed testing by the MLB as there were many [...] "legitimate scientific questions about whether or not those were truly positives." ...|$|E
2500|$|Birmingham {{was already}} being {{recognised}} as a centre of Pre-Raphaelitism by the 1850s. At {{a time when}} the controversial new movement was still exciting the hostility of the London press, the 1852 exhibition of Millais' Ophelia at the annual exhibition of the Birmingham Society of Artists provoked the radical Birmingham Journal – the town's most popular newspaper – to display a front page article analysing the picture, praising its [...] "erratic genius" [...] and [...] "independent thought" [...] and contrasting it with the [...] "traditions of the schools" [...] and the [...] "slavish reproduction of the academy models". Further Pre-Raphaelite works were sought the following year, with Holman Hunt's Strayed Sheep being singled out as [...] "one that ought to be studied ... with an intelligent appreciation of its peculiar beauties and special teachings." [...] Camille Pissarro would later write to his son [...] "It is a pity <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> able to go to Birmingham to see the assembled masters of Pre-Raphaelitism ... the provinces in England are more sympathetic to innovation." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{graduating from}} high school, Parsons {{received}} a bachelor's degree from the University of Houston. He was prolific during this time, appearing in 17 plays in 3 years. He was {{a founding member of}} Infernal Bridegroom Productions and regularly appeared at the Stages Repertory Theatre. Parsons enrolled in graduate school at the University of San Diego in 1999. He was one of seven students accepted into a special two-year course in classical theater, taught in partnership with the Old Globe Theater. Program director Rick Seer recalled having reservations about admitting Parsons, saying, [...] "Jim is a very specific personality. He's thoroughly original, which is one reason he's been so successful. But we worried, 'Does that adapt itself to classical theater, does that adapt itself to the kind of training that we're doing?' But we decided that he was so talented that we would give him a try and see how it worked out." [...] Parsons enjoyed school and told an interviewer that he would have pursued a doctorate in acting if possible: [...] "school was so safe!.....you frequently would surprise yourself by what you were capable of, and <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> surprised by some things." [...] Parsons graduated in 2001 and moved to New York.|$|E
