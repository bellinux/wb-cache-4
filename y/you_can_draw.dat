But {{at the same}} time, Spartan women had an unusual level of rights. It's a paradox {{that they were a}} bunch of people who in many ways were fascist, but they were the bulwark against the fall of democracy. The closest comparison <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>draw</b> in terms of our own military today is to think of the red-caped Spartans as being like our special-ops forces. They're these almost superhuman characters with a tremendous warrior ethic, who were unquestionably the best fighters in Greece. I didn't want to render Sparta in overly accurate terms, because ultimately I do want you to root for the Spartans. I couldn't show them being quite as cruel as they were. I made them as cruel as I thought a modern audience could stand." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{receiving}} the go-ahead {{to work on}} the project, Moore and Gibbons spent a day at the latter's house creating characters, crafting details for the story's milieu and discussing influences. The pair was particularly influenced by a Mad parody of Superman named [...] "Superduperman"; Moore said, [...] "We wanted to take Superduperman 180 degrees—dramatic, instead of comedic". Moore and Gibbons conceived of a story that would take [...] "familiar old-fashioned superheroes into a completely new realm"; the writer said his intention was to create [...] "a superhero Moby Dick; something that had that sort of weight, that sort of density". The writer came up with the character names and descriptions, but left the specifics of how they looked to Gibbons. Gibbons did not sit down and design the characters deliberately, but rather [...] "did it at odd times [...] spend maybe two or three weeks just doing sketches." [...] Gibbons designed his characters to make them easy to draw; Rorschach was his favorite to draw because [...] "you just have to draw a hat. If <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>draw</b> a hat, then you've drawn Rorschach, you just draw kind of a shape for his face and put some black blobs on it and you're done." ...|$|E
500|$|The win marked Liverpool's third {{consecutive}} victory against Manchester United, but despite this, manager Houllier refused to get carried away: [...] "At the moment I am worried because the team which {{has won the}} Charity Shield {{in recent years has}} not won the title, I don't think <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>draw</b> conclusions from this match." [...] Man of the match Sander Westerveld echoed similar sentiments: [...] "It doesn't say too much about the season. Last year Chelsea beat them 2-0 and had high expectations. We played well and it's a good result but it doesn't say anything about the Championship." [...] Questions were asked about the exclusion of striker Robbie Fowler from the match-day squad, with Houllier confirming the striker had been left out after a training ground bust-up with assistant manager Phil Thompson: [...] "It is a regrettable moment for the team and the club but I'm sure at some stage common sense will prevail. I am leaving it to him. I brokered a get-together between Phil and Robbie, which I attended at the beginning. Then I left the two Scousers together. But so far it has been unsuccessful." [...] Houllier added that he had tried to resolve the issue {{before the start of the}} match: [...] "I waited until the Sunday lunchtime before the Charity Shield game. I again insisted yesterday. I took them together again. I think at some stage it will be solved. I am a patient man." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "A Wiccan {{knows how}} to live life. There is no negativity no dullness, no pulling back. That effortlessness is there. Before <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>draw</b> energy from the {{elements}} to rejuvenate yourself, {{you have to love}} nature, attune and identify with it. To bring it to more practical and understandable levels, you must have an almost sensuous and sensual relation with what is around you. Attune your senses finely to recognize the sensuous touches of nature. Winter flowers are not fragrant, but there is a smell to them. Identify it. Only as you become finely-honed and centered {{will you be able to}} sense and use the presence of earth energy or that of other elements. The more you sensitize yourself, the more Nature reveals her secrets." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stewart aired archive {{footage of}} Cramer admitting to {{the ease of}} {{manipulating}} markets and commented that Cramer's on-air personality lacks honesty: [...] "I understand {{you want to make}} finance entertaining, but it's not a fucking game. And when I watch that, I get, I can't tell you how angry that makes me. Because what it says to me is: you all know. You all know what's going on. You know, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>draw</b> a straight line from those shenanigans to the stuff that was being pulled at Bear, and AIG, and all this derivative market stuff that is this weird Wall Street side bet." [...] Stewart said of Cramer in particular, [...] "I can't reconcile the brilliance and knowledge that you have of the intricacies of the market with the crazy bullshit I see you do every night." ...|$|E

Till <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>draw</b> with that, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>draw</b> with nothing; when <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>draw</b> with that, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>draw</b> with a log of wood charred at the end.

50|$|Russia, {{clear on}} the other side of the map, takes time to get going, but once it does, it's very hard to stop. Invaders will tend to stay out of Russia, {{especially}} early on thanks to Russia's attrition rule, which can cause invading armies to take casualties by remaining in Russia for too long.
