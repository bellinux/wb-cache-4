[...] Loeb, who was familiar with driving on nighttime stages in the French Rally Championship, said, [...] "In the dark you have to drive like you can when you have only two passes on the recce, and then you also start with the fastest stage.

2500|$|In early 1996, Quo Vadis {{headed back}} into the studio and {{recorded}} their debut album with Pierre Rémillard, who had previously worked with Cryptopsy, as producer. On April 10, 1996, Forever... was released and was received favorably by both fans and critics, leading Earth AD Records in Germany and Immortal Records in Poland to sign licensing deals with Quo Vadis. Bart said of the album, [...] "We recorded a demo which was released as an EP on cassette last year. The reaction was very positive. We were still searching for direction at that time, experimenting with keyboards and femme vox. The music is much more focused now as we have found our sound. Forever... is much more aggressive then the EP was, it's much more melodic and intricate. That {{may sound like a}} contradiction but that is the case. I think we had more to say as musicians this time in the studio as well. Our objective was to keep the aggression and not to loose our edge. I think we captured that quite well, at the same time setting free our artistic side. It's pretty weird. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> to both to really understand." ...|$|E

6000|$|Dinah {{must have}} risen {{a little before}} the sun the next morning, for she was downstairs about five o'clock. So was Seth, for, through Lisbeth's obstinate refusal to have any woman-helper in the house, {{he had learned to}} make himself, as Adam said, [...] "very handy in the housework," [...] that he might save his mother from too great weariness; on which ground I hope you will not think him unmanly, any more than you can have thought the gallant Colonel Bath unmanly when he made the gruel for his invalid sister. Adam, who had sat up late at his writing, was still asleep, and was not likely, Seth said, to be down till breakfast-time. Often as Dinah had visited Lisbeth during the last {{eighteen}} months, she had never slept in the cottage since that night after Thias's death, when, you remember, Lisbeth praised her deft movements and even gave a modified approval to her porridge. But in that long interval Dinah had made great advances in household cleverness, and this morning, since Seth was there to help, she was bent on bringing everything to a pitch of cleanliness and order that would have satisfied her Aunt Poyser. The cottage was far from that standard at present, for Lisbeth's rheumatism had forced her to give up her old habits of dilettante scouring and polishing. When the kitchen was to her mind, Dinah went into the new room, where Adam had been writing the night before, to see what sweeping and dusting were needed there. She opened the window and let in the fresh morning air, and the smell of the sweet-brier, and the bright low-slanting rays of the early sun, which made a glory about her pale face and pale auburn hair as she held the long brush, and swept, singing to herself in a very low tone--like a sweet summer murmur that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> for very closely--one of Charles Wesley's hymns: ...|$|E

50|$|There was a {{time when}} record shops were crucial to local music and people congregated over new vinyl releases. The shop owners knew every band <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to.</b> It’s gotten tougher to keep the magic of the record shop alive, but Sweat Records has proven it’s not impossible. Sweat Records is more than a record shop, it’s a café, music store, event space and hangout to Miami’s indie scene. Sweat Records is {{credited}} with organizing and spreading the word on the rise of the indie scene in Miami. While still cozy, the space has a small stage, a vegan café with delicious specialty coffee drinks (using soy and almond milk), free WiFi and space to use it, rows and rows of CDs and records with hand drawn labels, T-shirts and merchandise from local bands. Sweat puts on a yearly block-party called Sweatstock and has named a new holiday, Record Store Day.|$|R

And so, when I perform that song, or when you listen to the album version, you are listening to a hybrid of the original.

5000|$|Boyd Tonkin in The Independent {{described}} Şafak as a “writer who weds {{the modern}} and the mystic.”Şafak first {{became interested in}} Sufism {{as a college student}} in her early 20s, and it has reverberated through her writing and her life ever since. In The Forty Rules of Love, she tackles the subject head on with a modern love story between a Jewish-American housewife and a modern Sufi living in Amsterdam. Their unusual story is set against a historical background that narrates the remarkable spiritual bond between Rumi and Shams Tabrizi. She said in an interview given to The Guardian, [...] "The more you read about Sufism, the more <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen.</b> In time I became emotionally attached. When I was younger I wasn't interested in understanding the world. I only wanted to change it, through feminism or nihilism or environmentalism. But the more I read about Sufism the more I unlearned. Because that is what Sufism does to you, it makes you erase what you know, what you are so sure of. And then start thinking again. Not with your mind this time, but with your heart." ...|$|E
