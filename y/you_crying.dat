[...] Both videos were shot back to back, and were released simultaneously to music programs and channels for immediate circulation. The video begins with Carey lying in her bed, as she receives a text message from Snoop Dogg reading [...] "Yo what's happening? What <b>you</b> <b>crying</b> for? Now you know you look 2 damn good 2 be crying... Come here... Holla at a playa DPG style... Ya know," [...] to which Carey responds [...] "I can't sleep." [...] As the video progresses as the lyrics continue, {{it appears to be}} 5 AM, and Carey is still unable to sleep. She lies in bed with the lamp on, pondering on thoughts of a past lover until she takes a bath. Afterwards, she makes her way to the kitchen, and begins pouring an abundant amount of cereal and milk into a bowl, spilling it over the counter in a restless rage. As the scene finishes, Snoop's face is seen on a small monitor, directing his verse to Carey in the video. As the last chorus plays, Carey becomes restless and tosses a champagne glass and bottle at a large window, shattering it and sending glass around the living room. The video ends with Carey lying down on the couch one more, attempting to sleep once more.|$|E

2500|$|The ninth song is [...] "What <b>You</b> <b>Crying</b> For", first {{described}} by Cheryl as a [...] "garage-sound track". However, critics refutted these comments by defining its sound as drum and bass, with influences of pop and two-step garage. Despite a negative remark by McCaighy, many other music editors highlighted the production as [...] "forward-thinking" [...] and believed the members [...] "excelled themselves". The [...] "futuristic" [...] "I'm Falling" [...] includes [...] "squelchy sounds with a punky guitar", which was later compared to Girls Aloud's track [...] "Graffiti My Soul" [...] by BBC Music's Talia Kraines. [...] "Damn" [...] {{was one of}} the only tracks that was not frequently discussed by critics in their reviews for Tangled Up, but the pop rock-number was criticized for not sonically [...] "blending" [...] {{with the rest of the}} material. The album closer, [...] "Crocodile Tears", is an acoustic pop song that focuses more on the members' [...] "intelligent" [...] vocal performances, an element to which was never highlighted in their previous work, as mentioned by AllMusic's John Lucas.|$|E
