Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr., but being {{concerned}} with something as minor as keeping the Buffalo Bills from winning the Super Bowl. Chris Carter said [...] "I had to speak with Bill several times; I spent hours with him on the telephone talking about the character, because the actor felt that the episode really made the character something that it wasn't. I tried to explain to him, as I think Jim and Glen were trying to express, that even if your mission in life is a destroyer, that <b>you</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> some hope {{in the back of your}} mind that you can be a creator— and that this all of a sudden, this vanity, is his vanity. And we see that so clearly here and it makes him sort of a silly person".|$|E
500|$|... "Out of Mind" [...] is a pop song {{written by}} Tove Lo {{alongside}} Alx Reuterskiöld and produced by The Struts with Reuterskiöld. It has a minimal instrumentation which incorporates [...] "a mesh of fizzing synthesizers". It was released {{as a single}} on 16 October 2013, and was later featured on the singer's debut extended play, Truth Serum (2014). According to the artist, the songs on the EP talk about her [...] "most intense" [...] failed relationship. In an interview with Coup de Main Magazine, she said that [...] "'Out Of Mind' for me {{is kind of the}} step after 'Habits'... Picked up the pieces again and now just trying to glue them back together, you know? But it never really works". She further explained, [...] "That comes after I have the pain and I'm trying to get over this heartbreak. It's when you moved on and you're sort of okay, but <b>you</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> that little scar. It will always be there. Those thoughts about this other person will always haunt you a bit".

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Mark Blasius, Millett was sympathetic {{to the concept of}} intergenerational sex, describing age of consent laws as [...] "very oppressive" [...] to gay male youth in particular but repeatedly reminding the interviewer that the question cannot rest on the sexual access of older men or women to children but a rethinking of children's rights broadly understood. Millett added that [...] "one of children's essential rights is to express themselves sexually, probably primarily with each other but with adults as well" [...] and that [...] "the sexual freedom of children {{is an important part of}} a sexual revolution ... if you don't change the social condition of children <b>you</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> an inescapable inequality". In this interview, Millett criticized those who wished to abolish age of consent laws, saying the issue was not focused on children's rights but [...] "being approached as the right of men to have sex with kids below the age of consent" [...] and added that [...] "no mention is made of relationships between women and girls".|$|E

500|$|In an interview, Lo {{summarised}} the storyline of the EP; [...] "The song 'Love Ballad' {{is about}} the moment you decide to give everything to another person, while 'Habits' shows what happens when everything is screwed up and {{you just want to}} freak out. 'Out of Mind' deals with the stage after that, when your broken heart has mended, but the scars are still there". The EP's main genres are pop, electropop and indie pop. The Swedish edition of Truth Serum opens with [...] "Love Ballad", a pop song with drum instrumentation. It was described as a [...] "parody of love songs" [...] that talks about the [...] "carefree beginnings of a new romance". Lo also called it a [...] "way of telling the one I love I'd do anything for him". In the standard edition, the EP opens with [...] "Not on Drugs", a pop, dance and electropop song in which the artist compares falling in love to being under the influence of drugs. Following the narrative of Truth Serum, it represents the happy beginning of the relationship, when Lo was [...] "really in love" [...] and [...] " [...] think straight". [...] "Paradise" [...] is a jungle and drum and bass song with electronic elements; it talks about the moment when Lo realizes that she needs and relies on her partner. The electropop song [...] "Over" [...] details the part when Lo and her boyfriend end the relationship. The singer stated that it was about [...] "me making a big mistake and having to confess and come clean". [...] "Habits (Stay High)" [...] is a pop and electropop track which talks about the artist's hedonistic attempts to forget her former boyfriend. [...] "Out of Mind" [...] is a pop song with minimal instrumentation. According to Lo, it represents the part when [...] "I have the pain and I'm trying to get over this heartbreak. It's when you moved on and you're sort of okay, but <b>you</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> that little scar". The EP's last track is the downtempo [...] "Stay High", a remix version of [...] "Habits (Stay High)" [...] by record production duo Hippie Sabotage.|$|E

He Yong fell out over a record deal and sank into depression and alcoholism. In 1999, He Yong spent three months in France and the Netherlands, playing and recording music. Since his first album, He Yong has not produced any new material, which prompted one Chinese newspaper to question: [...] "He Yong, do <b>you</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> energy to rock?".|$|E

2500|$|Believed to {{have been}} written in the 1390s, Chaucer's short poem Fortune, is also {{inferred}} to directly reference Lancaster. [...] "Chaucer as narrator" [...] openly defies Fortune, proclaiming he has learned who his enemies are through her tyranny and deceit, and declares [...] "my suffisaunce" [...] (15) and that [...] "over himself hath the maystrye" [...] (14). [...] Fortune, in turn, does not understand Chaucer's harsh words to her for she believes she has been kind to him, claims {{that he does not}} know what she has in store for him in the future, but most importantly, [...] "And eek thou hast thy beste frend alyve" [...] (32, 40, 48). [...] Chaucer retorts that [...] "My frend maystow nat reven, blind goddesse" [...] (50) and orders her to take away those who merely pretend to be his friends. [...] Fortune turns her attention to three princes whom she implores to relieve Chaucer of his pain and [...] "Preyeth his beste frend of his noblesse/That to som beter estat he may atteyne" [...] (78–79). [...] The three princes are believed to represent the dukes of Lancaster, York, and Gloucester, and a portion of line 76, [...] "as three of you or tweyne," [...] to refer to the ordinance of 1390 which specified that no royal gift could be authorised without the consent of {{at least two of the}} three dukes. Most conspicuous in this short poem is the number of references to Chaucer's [...] "beste frend". [...] Fortune states three times in her response to the plaintiff, [...] "And also, <b>you</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> your best friend alive" [...] (32, 40, 48); she also references his [...] "beste frend" [...] in the envoy when appealing to his [...] "noblesse" [...] to help Chaucer to a higher estate. [...] A fifth reference is made by [...] "Chaucer as narrator" [...] who rails at Fortune that she shall not take his friend from him. [...] While the envoy playfully hints to Lancaster that Chaucer would certainly appreciate a boost to his status or income, the poem Fortune distinctively shows his deep appreciation and affection for John of Gaunt.|$|E
2500|$|Men {{and women}} hold unique roles in Tongan society. A man usually holds {{the power and}} is {{considered}} {{the head of his}} household. However, a man has an obligation to care for his sister and her children. So in Tongan families ones maternal uncle or Fa'etangata, is considered lower in ranking because of his obligation {{to take care of the}} needs of his sister and her children. Contrastly in Tongan families your paternal aunt is the highest-ranking member and is referred to as mehekitanga or Fahu. Men hold power and women hold rank. In ancient Tonga one would inherit titles, land and people from their mother, after Christianity this was changed to mainly inheriting from ones father. Until recently it was Tapu (taboo) for any male that has passed puberty to be in the same room with his sister or girl cousins alone. This was done under the notion of respect or faka'apa'apa. The recent introduction of western ideas and culture has slowly made this taboo vary widely amongst Tongan families. At one time it was inappropriate for a brother and sister to even watch television together if the characters were to kiss or even flirt on screen. That is mostly laxed in the modern age, but <b>you</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> families that will separate the boys and girls when watching TV or movies. The notion of faka'apa'apa is still strong but the meaning of it is slowly changing especially amongst the youth of the Tongan diaspora. Other key members of Tongan kinship are the 'Ulumotu'a or the oldest male in ones extended family on your father's side, they are usually called upon to be in charge of funerals and other family events. They do not out rank a Fahu but they have power to direct events. Also noteworthy [...] is all of your maternal aunts are called your mothers, likewise you paternal uncles are your fathers. Your cousins on either side are called your brothers or sisters. Similarly if you are female and your sisters children are called your children also because you are a mother to them. Same applies if you are a male and your brothers children will refer to you as a father.|$|E
2500|$|His fast bowling {{gave him}} the {{nickname}} [...] "Typhoon Tyson", and despite his short career he achieved status as the fastest England bowler in living memory. Don Bradman called him [...] "the fastest bowler I have ever seen" [...] and Richie Benaud agreed, writing [...] "For a short time, Frank Tyson blasted all-comers". Tom Graveney wrote 'I cannot believe any bowler was faster than Tyson at that time'. When fielding in the slips he had 'to stand 40 yards off the bat, and still. the ball was often going over our heads from edged shots'. His Northants colleague Jock Livingston said 'When really firing, Tyson was the quickest of all {{over a period of}} three or four overs'. Livingston had seen Harold Larwood bowl Bodyline and batted against the Australian fast bowlers Miller and Lindwall in the Sheffield Shield. At the Aeronautical College in Wellington, New Zealand in 1955 metal plates were attached to a cricket ball and a sonic device was used to measure their speed, with Tyson's bowling measured at [...] 89mph (142km/h), but he was wearing three sweaters on a cold, damp morning and used no run up, Brian Statham bowled at 87mph (139km/h). He certainly bowled faster than 89mph in matches, and Tyson claimed that he could bowl at 119mph (190km/h), but this cannot be proven. The best that can be said was that he was noticeably faster than his contemporaries Ray Lindwall, Keith Miller, Fred Trueman, Brian Statham, Peter Heine and Neil Adcock. His great fast bowling rival Fred Trueman ‘was forever being told that when it came to bowling I was very fast, but on his day Frank Tyson was faster than me' and it was Tyson who kept Trueman out of the England team in 1954–55. When they played together in a Gentlemen v Players match at Scarborough in 1957 the captain Godfrey Evans insisted Trueman bowl into the headwind so as to give the faster Tyson the advantage of the tailwind. Dickie Bird, the famous England umpire, wrote [...] "he was certainly the quickest bowler I ever seen through the air, and on one occasion the quickest bowler I never saw through the air". When playing for [...] at Scarborough in 1958 [...] "I opened the innings against him and hit his first three deliveries through the off side for four. With supreme confidence I went on to the front foot for the fourth ball. Tyson dropped one short. It reared up and hit me on the chin. I went down as if I'd just been {{on the receiving end of}} a right hook...I still carry the scar to show my folly that day. There was blood all over and I saw stars. I could hear bells ringing in my head...". Dickie came back to score his then highest first class score of 62 and Tyson took 4/30. When they met in Australia in 1998–99 Tyson joked 'You're looking well Dickie. See <b>you</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> the scars though'.|$|E
