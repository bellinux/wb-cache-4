25|$|An Andrew Lloyd Webber {{production}} {{opened on}} November 15, 2006, at the London Palladium and ran until February 2009, produced by Live Nation's David Ian and Jeremy Sams. Following failed negotiations with Hollywood star Scarlett Johansson, {{the role of}} Maria was cast through a UK talent search reality TV show called How Do <b>You</b> <b>Solve</b> a Problem like Maria?

25|$|Andrew Lloyd Webber, David Ian and David Mirvish {{presented}} The Sound of Music at the Princess of Wales Theatre in Toronto from 2008 to 2010. The role of Maria {{was chosen}} by the public through a television show, How Do <b>You</b> <b>Solve</b> a Problem Like Maria?, which was produced by Lloyd Webber and Ian and aired in mid-2008. Elicia MacKenzie won and played the role six times a week, while the runner-up in the TV show, Janna Polzin, played Maria twice a week. Captain von Trapp was played by Burke Moses. The show ran for more than 500 performances. It was Toronto's longest running revival ever.|$|E
25|$|Connie Fisher was {{selected}} by public voting as {{the winner of the}} show. In early 2007, Fisher suffered from a heavy cold that prevented her from performing for two weeks. To prevent further disruptions, an alternate Maria, Aoife Mulholland, a fellow contestant on How Do <b>You</b> <b>Solve</b> a Problem like Maria?, played Maria on Monday evenings and Wednesday matinee performances. Simon Shepherd was originally cast as Captain von Trapp, but after two preview performances he was withdrawn from the production, and Alexander Hanson moved into the role in time for the official opening date along with Lesley Garrett as the Mother Abbess. After Garrett left, Margaret Preece took the role. The cast also featured Lauren Ward as the Baroness, Ian Gelder as Max, Sophie Bould as Liesl, and Neil McDermott as Rolf. Other notable replacements have included Simon Burke and Simon MacCorkindale as the Captain and newcomer Amy Lennox as Liesl. Summer Strallen replaced Fisher in February 2008, with Mulholland and later Gemma Baird portraying Maria on Monday evenings and Wednesday matinees.|$|E
