2500|$|Bandar {{considers}} himself an American Hamiltonian conservative. Before the 2000 U.S. presidential election was decided, he invited George H. W. Bush to go pheasant shooting on his English estate in a [...] "Desert Storm reunion". After the September 11 attacks in 2001, {{in an interview}} in the New York Times, he stated, [...] "Bin Laden used to come to us when America through the CIA and Saudi Arabia, were helping our brother mujahideen in Afghanistan, {{to get rid of the}} communist secularist Soviet Union forces. Osama bin Laden came and said 'Thank you. Thank <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>bringing</b> the Americans to help us.' At that time, I thought he couldn’t lead eight ducks across the street." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't think I {{have ever}} seen him," [...] he said quietly. [...] "Thank <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>bringing</b> me the spur. But keep the {{knowledge}} of it to yourself, good Nascio, for the present." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! {{a mystery}} is it?" [...] I cried, rubbing my hands. [...] "This is very piquant. I am much obliged to <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>bringing</b> us together. 'The proper study of mankind is man,' you know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{else should}} she be {{suffering}} from? I will never forgive <b>you,</b> Julian, <b>for</b> <b>bringing</b> that crazy impostor into my house." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suppose we}} shall be in very soon, and I want to thank <b>you</b> now <b>for</b> <b>bringing</b> me back safe," [...] she said. [...] "Anthea, of course, can thank <b>you</b> <b>for</b> herself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Go away, naughty fairy! we {{know you}} now, and won't let <b>you</b> in, <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> trouble {{wherever}} you go. You needn't come to us for a new cloak when the shower has spoilt that one," [...] they cried.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Thank you much,' said Ethelberta, with dignity. 'Thank <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>bringing</b> my book, but I must go home now. I {{know that}} {{you will see that}} it is not {{necessary}} for us to be talking here.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I thought I {{never should}} have got over. I wouldn't go back for anything. But it is lovely; and I am so much obliged to <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>bringing</b> me here. We can go back another way?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I’m {{obliged to}} <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>bringing</b> my ship from London," [...] said Barber, slowly. [...] "I sha’n’t {{want you to}} take ’er back. I sha’n’t want you to stay in ’er at all. I don’t want to see you again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As you please, George Warrington--and God forgive you, George! God pardon <b>you,</b> Harry! <b>for</b> <b>bringing</b> me {{into this}} quarrel," [...] said the Colonel, with a face full of sadness and gloom.|$|R
6000|$|... “Now don’t {{say that}} this is what <b>you</b> get <b>for</b> <b>bringing</b> a woman along,” she said. She smiled at me whimsically, gloriously, and I knew {{there was no need for}} forgiveness.|$|R
60|$|Harpool. O, do you Sir me now? All's one for that; I'll make <b>you</b> eat it <b>for</b> <b>bringing</b> it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Died?" [...] The fan and the parasol {{and the two}} {{or three}} light {{packages}} she had been holding slid down one by one, and lay at her feet. [...] "Thank <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>bringing</b> me his last words," [...] she said, but did not ask him anything more.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Basil; it's {{all very}} pleasing, and thank <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>bringing</b> me. But if you don't {{think of any}} other New York delights to show me, do let us go and sit in Leonard's office till he comes, and then get out into the country as soon as possible." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Zack," [...] whispered Mr. Blyth, as {{the door}} closed, [...] "I am {{anything}} but pleased with <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>bringing</b> Madonna down-stairs. You have broken through all rule in doing so; and, besides that, you have confused your friend by introducing her to him without any warning or preparation." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “No,” Clay {{answered}} rather grimly; “it doesn’t seem probable. I haven’t thanked <b>you</b> yet <b>for</b> <b>bringing</b> me up.” He {{turned to}} Aynsley. “Mr. Farquhar stuck {{to me when}} I was half conscious and helpless. I’d like you to remember that. Now I want a quiet talk with him.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Of the Ethnological Survey?' said Father Victor. The Englishman nodded. 'Faith, I'm glad to meet ye then; an' I owe <b>you</b> some thanks <b>for</b> <b>bringing</b> {{back the}} boy.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I shall {{expect you}} sure," [...] replied Richard. [...] "I'll give <b>you</b> ten cents <b>for</b> <b>bringing</b> them," [...] he added, {{to make certain}} that Pep would not change him mind. [...] "Have you had any breakfast?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Again I thank <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>bringing</b> {{him here}} for me, and now I must {{ask you to}} {{surrender}} him to me, that I may turn him over to his foster parents." [...] As he concluded Rokoff held out his hands for the child, a nasty grin of vindictiveness upon his lips.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>bringing</b> {{me down to}} my feet again, when I was soaring {{away too}} far and too fast. I'm poorly off, ma'am; {{but if you are}} {{knitting}} these for me, I shall certainly start on a firm foundation." [...] And, leaning on Aunt Betsey's knee, she patiently discussed the wardrobe question from hose to head-gear.|$|E
6000|$|... "Our hopes, dear George," [...] wrote Mr. Robinson, the Speaker of the House of Burgesses, [...] "are all {{fixed on}} <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>bringing</b> our affairs to a happy issue. Consider what fatal {{consequences}} to your country your resigning the command {{at this time}} may be, especially {{as there is no}} doubt most of the officers will follow your example." ...|$|E
2500|$|The German Foreign Office tweeted [...] "Good-bye, David Bowie. You are now among #Heroes. Thank <b>you</b> <b>for</b> {{helping to}} <b>bring</b> down the #wall", {{referencing}} Bowie's [...] {{as well as}} his 1987 concert near the Berlin wall.|$|R
5000|$|The German Foreign Office tweeted [...] "Good-bye, David Bowie. You are now among #Heroes. Thank <b>you</b> <b>for</b> {{helping to}} <b>bring</b> down the #wall", {{referencing}} Bowie's time in Berlin in the 1970s {{as well as}} his 1987 concert near the Berlin wall.|$|R
6000|$|... 'By the men I saw here, then,' {{returned}} Kate, quickly. 'If {{they were}} no friends of yours, and you knew what they were,--oh, the more shame on <b>you,</b> uncle, <b>for</b> <b>bringing</b> me among them. To have subjected me to what I was exposed to here, through any misplaced confidence or imperfect knowledge of your guests, would have required some strong excuse; but if you did it--as I now believe you did--knowing them well, it was most dastardly and cruel.' ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{little old}} lady screwed up the {{delicate}} skin about her eyes, examined Milt, and cackled, [...] "Boy, there's something wrong here. You don't belong with my family. Why, you look like an American. You haven't got an imitation monocle, and I bet you can't talk with a New York-London accent. Why, Claire, I'm ashamed of <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>bringing</b> a human being into the Boltwood-Gilson-Saxton tomb and expecting----" ...|$|E
60|$|SIR HOWARD. Well, I {{am afraid}} I {{want a little}} privacy, and, if you will allow me to say so, a little civility. I am greatly obliged to <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>bringing</b> us safely off to-day when we were attacked. So far, you have carried out your contract. But since we have been your guests here, your tone {{and that of the}} worst of your men has changed--intentionally changed, I think.|$|E
6000|$|... "Like enough. The King is severe {{since we}} crossed the Border." [...] Then in a brisker tone: [...] "I thank <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>bringing</b> me this news," [...] said he, [...] "and I regret that in my poor house there be naught I can offer you wherein to drink His Majesty's health ere you proceed upon your search. Give you good night, sir." [...] And by drawing back a pace he {{signified}} his wish {{to close the door}} and be quit of them.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{considering}} this," [...] continued Mr. Tolman, [...] "I {{think it}} would be well <b>for</b> <b>you</b> to <b>bring</b> your love matters to a conclusion while I am here to help you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, we {{were only}} waiting <b>for</b> <b>you</b> to <b>bring</b> my things, Laura," [...] {{answered}} her brother, coolly. [...] "We'll be ready in three minutes and a half by the factory whistles." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are so {{imprudent}} I fear <b>for</b> <b>you,</b> and <b>bring</b> your things," [...] said a timid voice, as {{the little}} white figure approached the tall black one, striding down the path tempestuously.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Intend' is a mild word {{applied to}} Humphrey," [...] she answered; [...] "'determined' would suit him better. According to him, {{there is no}} game that cannot be won by dynamics. 'Get out of the way' is his motto. Mrs. Pomfret {{will tell you how}} he means to cover the State with good roads next year, and take a house in Washington the year after." [...] She held out her hand. [...] "Good-by,--and I am ever so much obliged to <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>bringing</b> me here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This is opportune indeed," [...] he said, [...] "and I thank <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>bringing</b> me {{the news}} so rapidly. Well did the astrologer {{say that my}} destiny to some extent {{depended}} on you; this is a proof that he was right. The chancellor {{tells me that the}} Duke of Saxe-Lauenberg will march instantly with four thousand men to join me, and that Duke Bernhard will move down at once with six thousand of the best Swedish troops. I may yet be even with the traitors." ...|$|E
60|$|CANYNGE. That's enough! [He {{goes to the}} door, but stops {{before opening}} it] Now, look here! I have some {{knowledge}} of the world. Once an accusation like this passes beyond these walls no one can foresee the consequences. Captain Dancy is a gallant fellow, with a fine record as a soldier; and only just married. If he's as innocent as--Christ--mud will stick to him, unless the real thief is found. In {{the old days of}} swords, either you or he would not have gone out of this room alive. It you persist in this absurd accusation, you will both of you go out of this room dead in the eyes of Society: <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>bringing</b> it, he for being the object of it.|$|E
6000|$|... "O yes, poor Uncle Jack! I feel somehow as if I were {{cheating}} {{him out of}} it. He {{ought to}} be here in my place. But I do like it; and, Dick, I don't know what I can ever say or do to <b>you</b> and Fanny <b>for</b> <b>bringing</b> me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wait here a minute, Elizabeth," [...] said Bince. [...] "How {{much do you}} want? I'll get it <b>for</b> <b>you</b> and <b>bring</b> it back. I {{want to see you}} {{a moment}} alone before you go." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My poor child!" [...] exclaimed the lady, [...] "how {{you must}} have suffered. Thank Heaven it is over now. To-morrow we shall call <b>for</b> <b>you</b> and <b>bring</b> you away with us to Muddlenut Chase." ...|$|R
