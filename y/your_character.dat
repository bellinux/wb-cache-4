That was the other thing – everyone reacts to the problem differently so there's no textbook way of playing Ruth in her present situation. In fact, the way I'm playing her now might surprise some people because in the past she's been such a strong character and here she is collapsed and weeping and thinking the worst. Occasionally you may suggest to the script editor that you don't think <b>your</b> <b>character</b> will react a certain way, but with Ruth I have absolute trust in the scriptwriter's characterisation.|$|E
25|$|Character {{statistics}} {{alter the}} combat system {{by the individual}} qualities of a character. Statistics are split into five categories: Strength, Intelligence, Dexterity, Will, and Luck. Strength, Intelligence, and Dexterity all determine the base attack power of melee, magic, and ranged, respectively. Dexterity also determines damage balance during melee combat. Will affects how <b>your</b> <b>character</b> absorbs strong blows and how much damage is done to enemies. A character's luck rating may improve the chance of high hits, gathering, and increases the chance of lucky drops.|$|E
500|$|Practical - Full {{contact system}} where {{the core of}} the combat is {{completely}} dependent on what <b>your</b> <b>character</b> can do, not what <b>your</b> <b>character</b> has the stats to do. These types of LARPs exist with boffer weapons, but they are more commonly seen with real weapons and armor. This system follows variations of the Limb Loss System with the primary difference being realism. In some practical LARPs actions such as kicking another player's shield is authorize, as seen in the LARP Dagohir. Practical systems that involve real weapons and armor put emphasis on realism, specifically historic realism which is what the [...] strives to achieve. The SCA is techinally an educational group and not a LARP, however, they are the most widely known group that utilizes the Practical system of combat. On the RP side of things, Practical LARPs differ from Limb Loss LARPs because of the interaction that takes place between combat. Generally, but not always, Practical LARPs do not role play in between fights and if they do, they usually take on the role of a historical figure rather than a created character.|$|E

John Billingsley, who played Doctor Phlox in Enterprise, didn't agree with the changed version, saying [...] "the ending that had initially been created I was fairly comfortable with. But the head of the studio suggested some revisions on the ending. What do you do?

500|$|Deus Ex {{features}} combat {{similar to}} first-person shooters, with real-time action, a first-person perspective, and reflex-based gameplay. As the player will often encounter enemies in groups, combat often tends toward a tactical approach, {{including the use}} of cover, strafing, and [...] "hit-and-run". A USA Today reviewer found [...] "At the easiest difficulty setting, <b>your</b> <b>character</b> is puréed again and again by an onslaught of human and robotic terrorists until you learn the value of stealth." [...] However, through the game's role-playing systems, it is possible to develop a character's skills and augmentations to create a tank-like combat specialist with the ability to deal and absorb large amounts of damage. Non-player characters will praise or criticize the main character depending on his use of force, incorporating a moral element into the gameplay.|$|E
500|$|With further releases, {{many games}} in the genre have drifted towards action by {{allowing}} the option of direct confrontations. The Hitman series, the first installment of which was released in 2000, allowed this play style, but rewarded the player for stealthy and elaborate assassination of antagonists. [...] {{was also the first}} 3D game to employ the genre's device of disguises. No One Lives Forever, an espionage themed parody also released in 2000, again allowed the player to combine or choose between stealth and overt violence. In 2000, the first-person action role-playing game Deus Ex also incorporated stealth elements in its gameplay.

It was most peculiar. I'm sure serious character actors feel this all the time... Obviously if you're trying to feel the character and his dilemma then you're going to experience some of the fictional feelings for real. You felt swept along by it." ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{both were}} {{committed}} O.T.O. members, Northrup's usurpation of Helen's role led to {{conflict between the}} two sisters. The reactions of Parsons and Helen towards Northrup were markedly different. Parsons told Helen to her face that he preferred Northrup sexually: [...] "This {{is a fact that}} I can do nothing about. I am better suited to her temperamentally – we get on well. <b>Your</b> <b>character</b> is superior. You are a greater person. I doubt that she would face what you have with me – or support me as well." [...] Some years later, addressing himself as [...] "You", Parsons told himself that his affair with Northrup (whom he called Betty) marked a key step in his growth as a practitioner of magick: [...] "Betty served to affect a transference from Helen at a critical period ... Your passion for Betty also gave you the magical force needed at the time, and the act of adultery tinged with incest, served as your magical confirmation in the law of Thelema." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{graphics}} received mixed reviews. Lewis {{called them}} [...] "more {{interesting than the}} first game, but marginally so", and Meuller called them [...] "dated", with environments seeming [...] "bland and drab, and the enemies [...] generic". The GameTrailers reviewer praised the character animations, but cited the environments as bland and felt that there were too few FMVs and too many game engine-driven cutscenes, which he described as [...] "awful". Parkin criticized the game's graphic capacities, commenting that players would [...] "stop watching the main screen instead fixing upon the little map in the corner to guide <b>your</b> <b>character</b> towards hostile red dots that only materialize polygonal just seconds before you lock swords.", while Jarvis said {{that it had not}} improved from the previous game and called the colors [...] "very murky, drab and dark". 1UP said that the graphics [...] " [...] hold up to the visual quality of Cavia's other titles like [...] ".|$|E

500|$|Publications {{judged the}} co-op {{aspect of the}} game well. Kristan Reed of Eurogamer praised {{the fact that the}} {{missions}} were [...] "designed with co-op in mind." [...] He noted that, for example, the third level [...] "has Joanna providing cover fire for her father Jack as he hops from one point of the level to the next. In the single player campaign Jack's AI controlled, but co-op lets you take direct control of his actions, making the experience a much more engaging affair all-round." [...] Multiplayer matches of Perfect Dark Zero were widely well received. GameSpot stated that [...] "the excellent weapon selection, flexibility of options, high-quality maps, and smooth online performance ... make for a rock-solid competitive shooter." [...] IGN stated similar pros, calling it [...] "enormous". 1UP.com reviewer Che Chou also praised the multiplayer, but observed that [...] "constantly roll-dodging to avoid enemy fire at close range [...] combined with the exceptionally slow movement speed of <b>your</b> <b>character</b> [...] can occasionally be highly frustrating for beginners." ...|$|E
500|$|British {{composer}} Charlie Mole {{wrote the}} score to Northanger Abbey, while the Pemberley Players provided other authentic pieces of music. Sue Mythen choreographed the ballroom scenes. Speaking to Benji Wilson of the Radio Times, Jones revealed the dance sessions {{were the most}} taxing part of the shoot. She explained that the cast had to learn all of the ballroom dances from scratch and they spent a week going over them {{to make sure they}} were right. She explained, [...] "But what happens is as soon as you put the dialogue in, the dancing just goes to pot! So it's all about putting the movement and the dialogue together and remembering what <b>your</b> <b>character</b> is supposed to be thinking at the same time – that's quite tricky!" [...] Jones praised Mythen and said the teacher often reminded the actors to relax into the dance and remember that their character would have been doing it for years, as they would have learnt at an early age. Jones added [...] "the novelty for us with three weeks of dancing is not quite the same!" ...|$|E

The role was then rapidly aged for the first time when Tucker assumed the role in October 2009. In May 2012, it was announced that the character had been rapidly aged again to a teenager, with Ehrich scheduled to join the cast. He made his debut on June 11, 2012. In an interview with Soap Opera Digest, Ehrich stated that he had gone through a [...] "long audition process", saying: [...] "I got a callback and did a chemistry read with someone, then came back to read with Christian LeBlanc. By the end of that audition, I knew something felt right and that he could be my father." [...] When asked about signing a contract with the series, Ehrich stated: [...] "I'm still on recurring right now.

500|$|Skyrim {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} upon release. The {{removal of the}} character class system, present in previous The Elder Scrolls entries, was well received. Billy Shibley of Machinima's Inside Gaming and Charles Onyett of IGN praised its removal because it allowed players to experiment with different skills without having {{to make decisions about}} a class early in the game. John Bedford of Eurogamer stated that by removing the character class system, the game tailored itself to players who wanted to build an all-around character, while still letting other players specialize in a preferred play-style. Steve Butts of The Escapist considered the addition of perks to the character development system [...] "a great method to make <b>your</b> <b>character</b> feel even more unique and personal". Kevin VanOrd of GameSpot praised the way perks allowed for the player's preferred skills to become more powerful over time, stating that the perk system [...] "forms around the way you play, but allows for tweaking so that you retain a sense of control". The user interface was also praised by reviewers for its accessibility; Bedford complimented its [...] "elegant design" [...] which succeeded Oblivions comparatively complex interface.|$|E
500|$|Certain {{elements}} {{gained a}} more mixed response. GameSpot felt that Sonic Advance lacked polish, and criticized the hard-to-master special stages. IGNs only criticism was {{the presence of}} problems from prior titles, such as [...] "an inviting stretch of roadway that begs to have <b>your</b> <b>character</b> blaze across it at top speed, only to have a spike strip jab you in the feet somewhere in the middle". Nintendo World Report thought the game was too short and criticized {{the exclusion of the}} Super Sonic replay mode from earlier games. Reception to SonicN was mixed; GameSpot criticized its choppy frame rate and encouraged readers to instead buy the superior GBA version. IGN agreed and felt the ported version was damaged by the N-Gage's vertical screen and omission of the multiplayer modes. Regarding the game as a whole, critics felt Sonic Advance was a solid entry in the Sonic franchise. Nintendo World Report felt the game was not perfect but was still a game that [...] "deserves a spot in your GBA case". IGN agreed, and stated the game successfully re-captured the spirit of classic Sonic gameplay while taking advantage of the GBA's capabilities. In 2009, Official Nintendo Magazine named it among the best games ever produced for a Nintendo platform.|$|E
500|$|John Colonnello, a youth pastor from Athens, Alabama, criticized Rihanna's {{failure as}} a role model for young girls and women who look up to her.

[...] The video is the third by Rihanna in 2011 to receive a negative reaction from organizations; [...] "S" [...] was banned from eleven countries due to its explicit sexual content, while [...] "Man Down" [...] attracted media attention when the Parents Television Council (PTC) criticized Rihanna for depicting a [...] "cold, calculated execution of murder" [...] in the video and for portraying a scenario of rape.
