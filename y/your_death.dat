25|$|In general, the Many-minds theory {{holds that}} a {{conscious}} being who observes {{the outcome of}} a random zero-sum experiment will evolve into two successors in different observer states, each of whom observes one of the possible outcomes. Moreover, the theory advises you to favour choices in such situations in proportion to the probability that they will bring good results to your various successors. But in a life-or-death case like getting into the box with Schrödinger's cat, you will only have one successor, since one of the outcomes will ensure <b>your</b> <b>death.</b> So it seems that the Many-minds Interpretation advises you to get in the box with the cat, since it is certain that your only successor will emerge unharmed.

500|$|To the {{surprise}} of the Palestine Police Force, al-Qassam's funeral, which {{was held at the}} Jerini Mosque, attracted at least 3,000 mourners, mostly members of the peasant and working classes.

Al-Qassam is buried at the Muslim cemetery at the former Palestinian village of Balad al-Sheikh, now Nesher, a Jewish suburb of Haifa.

Author James Srodes states in his biography of Allen Dulles that some British historians believed that Cicero was [...] "'turned' into a double agent to send disinformation via von Papen". Malcolm Gladwell, author of Pandora's Briefcase, said that an interviewer had questioned Menzies before he died about whether {{he was telling the}} truth. Menzies told the interviewer [...] "Of course, Cicero was under our control," [...] but his truthfulness is questioned. Gladwell stated in an article in The New Yorker; [...] "if you had been the wartime head of M.I.6, giving an interview shortly before <b>your</b> <b>death,</b> you probably would say that Cicero was one of yours." [...] Gladwell also mentions that while Ribbentrop was wary of Bazna, which curtailed the dissemination of some of Bazna's intelligence, most German intelligence officials were not wary of him.|$|E

The Andersons had originally intended to film the script as a one-hour drama for ATV; Sylvia explained that since the concept [...] "was too good for a television play, I suggested to Gerry {{that we try to}} develop it as a movie." [...] Responding to claims that Doppelgänger had [...] "dark" [...] scripting, Gerry stated that he wanted the film to have an interesting and entertaining premise. He also discussed the significance of the title, which was suggested to him by Century 21 co-director John Read: Doppelgänger being [...] "a German word which means 'a copy of oneself', and the legend goes that if you meet your doppelganger, it is the point of <b>your</b> <b>death.</b> Following that legend, clearly, I had to steer the film so that I could end it illustrating the meaning of that word." ...|$|E
