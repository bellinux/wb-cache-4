A <b>young</b> <b>man</b> jumps {{in the air and}} pumps his fist as another <b>young</b> <b>man</b> in an opposing jersey sinks to the floor. The moment is from the 1989 NBA Playoffs, when Jordan hit a game-winning jump shot over Cleveland Cavaliers guard Craig Ehlo. At 0:38 is Jordan's last shot with the Chicago Bulls, after a crossover dribble past Utah Jazz guard Bryon Russell at the end of Game 6 of the 1998 NBA Finals. These scenes are musically punctuated with a bass drum roll and a cymbal crash. Finally, at 0:44 a <b>young</b> <b>man</b> shrugs after hitting a shot, as Jordan shrugged after scoring six three-point field goals {{in the first half of}} Game 1 of the 1992 NBA Finals against the Portland Trail Blazers.|$|E

40|$|Teenage {{pregnancy}} prevention programmes {{targeted at}} young women have received considerable attention from researchers and programme developers. However, to date, relatively limited {{information is available}} on preventing teenage fatherhood or improving outcomes for young fathers. A notable gap is concerned with understanding the forms of sexual health programmes that are most effective {{from the perspective of}} <b>young</b> <b>men.</b> We conducted a systematic mapping to identify studies involving <b>young</b> <b>men</b> aimed at preventing teenage pregnancy, improving outcomes for teenage fathers or exploring the perspectives of <b>young</b> <b>men</b> around pregnancy and fatherhood. We searched a wide range of electronic databases from January 1996 to August 2008. Three quantitative and 15 qualitative studies were identified, of which nine were UK based. Key themes related to the inappropriateness of current sexual health promotion to respond to the needs of <b>young</b> <b>men.</b> While <b>young</b> <b>men</b> often possessed very similar ideals to young women, existing programmes were problematic when they negatively stereotyped <b>young</b> <b>men</b> and ineffectively addressed models of masculinity or the difficulties <b>young</b> <b>men</b> may have forming meaningful relationships. Further investigations are required on programme development for <b>young</b> <b>men,</b> particularly on sexual health promotion interventions for 'looked-after' <b>young</b> <b>men</b> and those from unstable childhoods...|$|R

The central {{aim of the research}} is to understand how the news media represent black <b>young</b> <b>men</b> and boys, and specifically, to consider whether there is evidence of negative stereotyping of black <b>young</b> <b>men</b> and boys in the news media. The report begins by discussing the results of a quantitative analysis of media news stories about <b>young</b> <b>men</b> and boys generally, followed by more detailed analysis of media news stories involving black <b>young</b> <b>men</b> and boys. This is followed by an in-depth qualitative analysis of media stories about black <b>young</b> <b>men</b> and boys related to crime; an analysis of black and minority ethnic media coverage; and finally the results of a series of qualitative interviews with those involved in making and reporting the news. Overall, the dominant discourse surrounding black <b>young</b> <b>men</b> and boys in the news media links them with violent crime, and particularly murders involving knives and/or gangs. While this is clearly a negative media image, no clear or explicit stereotype of black <b>young</b> <b>men</b> or boys was constructed across news reports...|$|R
