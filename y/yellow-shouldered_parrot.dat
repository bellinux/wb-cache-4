50|$|The yellow-shouldered amazon (Amazona barbadensis) {{also known}} as <b>yellow-shouldered</b> <b>parrot</b> is a parrot of the genus Amazona that {{is found in the}} arid areas of {{northern}} Venezuela, the Venezuelan islands of Margarita and La Blanquilla, and the island of Bonaire (Caribbean Netherlands). It has been extirpated from Aruba and possibly also Cura√ßao.|$|E
50|$|The {{park has}} a zoo with {{beautiful}} animals including jaguars, monkeys, squirrels, Chiguires, Ocelots, laziness, Opossum, {{many kinds of}} birds: Caricare, many types of parrot, <b>yellow-shouldered</b> <b>parrot,</b> Tinamou, White Heron, kind egret, Blue heron, gonzalito, blue and yellow macaw, scarlet macaw, scarlet macaw, Green macaw, North Guacharaca, Barn Owls,helmeted curassow, king Zamuro (vulture), Red-billed toucan and reptiles including crocodiles and anacondas.|$|E
50|$|The male {{hooded parrot}} can be {{distinguished}} from the similar looking male golden-shouldered parrot mainly {{by the absence of}} a pale frontal band, a larger yellow patch on the wings, and absence of the red on the abdomen. The female is very similar to the female <b>Yellow-shouldered</b> <b>parrot</b> being identified by the absence of a pale frontal band and an absence of red on the abdomen.|$|E

5000|$|The {{peninsula}} is {{the only}} home of the endangered <b>yellow-shouldered</b> amazon <b>parrot,</b> and {{is also home to}} the blue-crowned parakeet. The seasonal watercourses, or quebradas, are the main nesting and feeding grounds for the yellow-shouldered amazon. They are being mined for sand and gravel to be used in construction, and in some areas the parrot is hunted, considered a pest that robs jocote orchards.|$|R
40|$|Many {{bird species}} are declining in {{population}} size. There {{is a limited}} understanding of how birds and specifically secondary cavity nesting species select their nest sites. In many cases secondary cavity nesters (SNCs) {{are thought to be}} at risk due to limited available nest sites. This study investigated the effect of environmental conditions on nest site selection for the vulnerable <b>yellow-shouldered</b> <b>parrot</b> (Amazona barbadensis). Temperature was not found to have a significant influence on clutch size, hatchability or fledging numbers but did have an effect on overall breeding success. Hotter nests at the coldest point of the day were more successful than those nests that had never produced chicks. This information improves our understanding of nest site selection in A. barbadensis and provides a good foundation for understanding what cavities may be regarded as suitable for nesting on Bonaire. This information has the ability to influence nestbox design for both A. barbadensis {{and other members of the}} highl...|$|E
