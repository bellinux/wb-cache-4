500|$|Tragedy befell Alice on 29 May 1873, {{when her}} {{youngest}} and favourite son, Friedrich, called [...] "Frittie", died after falling 20feet from a window. The child suffered from haemophilia, {{and although he}} regained consciousness, the internal bleeding could not be stopped. Alice never recovered from Frittie's death, writing to her mother two months later: [...] "I am glad <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> coloured picture of my darling. I feel lower and sadder than ever and miss him so much, so continually." [...] However, the Queen's attention was more focused on the engagement of her son Prince Alfred to the Grand Duchess Marie Alexandrovna of Russia, the only surviving daughter of Tsar Alexander II and his first wife, Empress Marie Alexandrovna. The Tsar had refused to present his daughter for pre-marriage inspection in England, and instead invited the Queen to meet the family in Germany. Alice supported this suggestion, and {{on the same day}} she wrote to the Queen about how much she missed Frittie, the Queen wrote to Alice in scathing terms: [...] "You have entirely taken the Russian side, and I do not think, dear child, that you should tell me...what I ought to do." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Thank {{you very}} much, Mr. Hendrick," [...] said Mr. Holohan, [...] "you'll see it in, I know. Now, won't <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{something}} before you go?" ...|$|E
5000|$|The meeting did {{eventually}} take place, {{with the}} Queen remarking, according to Carey, [...] "I believe <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> trouble getting here." ...|$|R
6000|$|Her {{face was}} eloquent with reproach as she said, [...] "Then {{you were only}} making believe when <b>you</b> wished <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> girl like me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It doesn't {{count for}} much. Was Clarence Gladwyne {{accustomed}} to roughing it and going without his dinner? Would you {{expect him to}} survive where you would perish, even if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more to bear?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> now, or I am cursed badly mistook. Oons! {{what do you}} fear?" [...] he exclaimed, [...] "you {{that have}} played with March and Fox?" ...|$|E
60|$|PRAG. It is easy, yes, when <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> home bought already, and mortgaged, and childrens who go {{to school}} here, and a wife a long time sick.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh no!' cried Rosette, 'he must be wicked, {{since he}} tried to drown me. Don't let us tell him, but if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> basket give it to me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Stow this gab,' roared Hook, and the spokesmen were dragged back. 'You, boy,' he said, {{addressing}} John, 'you {{look as if}} <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> pluck in <b>you.</b> Didst {{never want}} to be a pirate, my hearty?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{would be}} if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> good-will--if <b>you</b> entered <b>a</b> <b>little</b> into my dilemma." [...] The note of reproach was so {{distinct}} in these words that Bernard stood staring. [...] "You never take anything seriously," [...] his companion went on.|$|R
6000|$|... "For--well, to go {{away for}} a day or two," [...] said the visitor. [...] "I find you in bed; it may be a cold or a bilious attack; or perhaps <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> upset of the nerves when the trains kissed each other." ...|$|R
6000|$|Peter nodded. [...] "More than that, Mr. Toad. I think <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{the best}} of it," [...] he replied. [...] "Now won't {{you tell me how}} you did it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'One thing I beg of you! Don't {{tell anyone}} that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bird who tells you everything. It {{will be much}} better not to!' Then the Nightingale flew away.|$|E
60|$|Maccario laughed softly. “Now I think <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{explanation}} to make, Don Bernardino, {{and it is}} conceivable that the Señor Harding may not be grateful to you,” he said.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Lily; [...] "and then, you know, we stupid {{people can}} go to bed. Mamma, I wish <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> smoking-room here for us. I don't like being {{considered}} stupid." [...] And then they parted,--the ladies going into the house, {{and the two men}} returning across the lawn.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am very sorry, mamma. I think I {{might have}} been better if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more {{patience}} with me, but even now if you really wish me to stay at home I will do so. I can write again to uncle and tell him that I have changed my mind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Hold your tongue; I thought <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> sense! Felix <b>had</b> that; he saw I {{could not}} tell him, and said it must be as I pleased about that; but then he rowed me, as he never did before, for wasting time, and not mugging for the exhibition--as if that was any use.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh--a difference--what a difference! When <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more flesh--then--" [...] Madame made {{a slight}} click with her tongue. [...] "What a good brooch, eh?" [...] Madame fingered the brooch. [...] "Old paste--old paste--antique--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I may say then, that I {{was sure}} you would,' said Mr Pecksniff. 'I know that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> room of your own, {{and that they}} can be {{comfortable}} there, without appearing at the general table.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'If {{you have}} a big lump you must give me a strip of your skin from your ear to your thumb, and if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> lump, you must give me a strip from your ear to your little finger.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am glad <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{agreed to}} wait and come back for Helen in the spring, but I ought to tell you {{something}} now, because it may make a difference in your plans," [...] Mrs. Dalton remarked [...] "You admitted that some of the difficulties you and Helen would have to meet might be avoided if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more capital." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "True, Giles, {{but surely}} you won't deny me the small {{privilege}} of wishing that <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> less to do, and <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{more time with}} your family. You men,--especially you Scotchmen--are such an argumentative set, that a poor woman can't open her lips to say a word, but you pounce upon it and make an argument of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am at your service. I see our good-humor is gone. And I {{only wanted}} to be amiable! It is very discouraging. Cavaliere, you, only, look as if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> of the milk of human {{kindness}} left; from your venerable visage, at least; there is no telling what you think. Give me your arm and take me away!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mercy on me! it's a {{question}} for your taste, my good lady, not for mine. Suppose <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> of both? and suppose you begin with the chicken, because Mr. Hartright looks devoured by anxiety to carve for you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'There's {{plenty more}} {{of it at the}} same shop,' said Mr Swiveller, by turns {{advancing}} and retreating in a threatening attitude, 'a large and extensive assortment always on hand--country orders executed with promptitude and despatch--will <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more, Sir--don't say no, if you'd rather not.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'If you wasn't a Moses-meek little Mary's lamb, you wouldn't {{have been}} took down this way,' says he. 'Haven't you got gumption {{enough not to}} drink swamp water or fall down and scream {{whenever}} <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> colic or feel a mosquito bite you?' He made me a little mad.|$|E
6000|$|Charlotte {{opened her}} big eyes very widely. [...] "Why, it's an orphan asylum!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "Nobody could {{like living in}} an orphan asylum. But, of course, orphans should be very thankful to have any place to live in and I am thankful. I'd be thankfuller still if the matron wouldn't make me take sulphur and molasses. If <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> girl, would <b>you</b> make her take sulphur and molasses?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Mind! I {{should think}} not. That poor boy will miss you {{something}} cruel. I wish <b>you</b> <b>had</b> thought <b>a</b> <b>little</b> of that, mother.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{thank you}} very much,' {{returned}} the knight, kissing his delicate hand to the locksmith, 'for your guileless advice; and I only wish, my good soul, although your simplicity is quite captivating, that <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more worldly wisdom. I never so much regretted the arrival of my hairdresser as I do at this moment. God bless you! Good morning! You'll not forget my message to the ladies, Mr Varden? Peak, show Mr Varden to the door.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish I {{could help}} you, Bill," [...] Ned said: [...] "if {{father had been}} alive I am sure he would have let <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> money to take you away from here and keep you somewhere until {{it is time for}} you to enlist; but you see I can do nothing now." ...|$|E
6000|$|Nevertheless, in {{the morning}} his fever was {{slightly}} worse. Mrs. Hale, offering her condolence, said, [...] "I {{know that you have}} not been resting well, for even after your friend met with that mishap in the hall, I heard your voices, and Kate says your door was open all night. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> fever too, Mr. Falkner." ...|$|E
6000|$|Saxton made {{a little}} gesture of approval, though he shook his head. [...] "You show <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> sense now and then, but there's nothing in that view," [...] he said. [...] "Is a man going to lay out dollars on dams and wire-rope slings when he knows {{that none of them}} will be any use to him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Flora Schuyler laughed. [...] "You {{are quite}} delightful, Hetty, now and then. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> read <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> and been taught history. Can't you {{remember}} any?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{will tell}} a {{different}} story next year,' said Lady Merton, 'when <b>you</b> <b>have</b> learnt <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more of the ways of the poor children.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>you</b> know <b>you</b> <b>have</b> been <b>a</b> <b>little</b> silly, Mr. Gray, {{and that}} you don't really object to being {{reminded}} that you are extremely young." ...|$|R
