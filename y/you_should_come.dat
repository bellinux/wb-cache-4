500|$|With {{the score}} 2–0 to Reading, the goalkeeper Steve Death {{threw the ball}} to the right back Gary Peters, who spotted Friday {{standing}} near the left-hand corner of the opposing penalty area. Peters passed high and diagonally across the pitch towards his forward, who jumped into the air and used his chest to cushion the ball and knock it into the air with his back to goal, about 25–30 yards away from the net. As Friday landed, he ferociously powered the ball towards goal, kicking over his shoulder and turning after the ball had gone. The shot flew straight into the top-right-hand corner of the net, stunning the crowd, players and Thomas, the referee, who put his hands over his head in disbelief. [...] "I'll never forget it", Thomas recalled. [...] "It was the sheer ferocity of the shot on the volley ... over his shoulder. ... If it hadn't gone into the top corner of the net it would have broken the goalpost. Even up against the likes of Pelé and Cruyff, that rates as the best goal I have ever seen." [...] Reading {{went on to win the}} game 5–0. When Thomas told Friday after the game that he had never seen a better goal, the Londoner replied, [...] "Really? <b>You</b> <b>should</b> <b>come</b> down here more often, I do that every week." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Yohanan has {{related the}} {{following}} {{account of the}} massacre: “The brains of three-hundred children were found upon one stone, along with three-hundred baskets of what remained of phylacteries [...] (...) were found in Betar, {{each and every one}} of which had the capacity to hold three measures (...) [...] If <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>come</b> to take [...] into account, you would find that they amounted to three-hundred measures.” Rabban [...] Gamliel said: “Five-hundred schools were in Betar, while the smallest of them wasn’t less than three-hundred children. They used to say, ‘If the enemy should ever come upon us, with these metal pointers [...] we’ll go forth and stab them.’ But since iniquities had caused , the enemy came in and wrapped up each and every child in his own book and burnt them together, and no one remained except me.” ...|$|E
2500|$|I was {{returning}} {{from high school}} one day and a runaway horse with a bridle on sped past {{a group of us}} into a farmer's yard looking for a drink of water. The horse was perspiring heavily. And the farmer didn't recognize it so we cornered it. I hopped on the horse's back. Since it had a bridle on, I took hold of the tick rein and said, [...] "Giddy-up." [...] Headed for the highway, I knew the horse would turn in the right direction. I didn't know what the right direction was. And the horse trotted and galloped along. Now and then he would forget he was on the highway and start into a field. So I would pull on him a bit and call his attention to the fact the highway was where he was supposed to be. And finally, about four miles from where I had boarded him, he turned into a farm yard and the farmer said, [...] "So that's how that critter came back. Where did you find him?" [...] I said, [...] "About four miles from here." [...] "How did you know <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>come</b> here?" [...] I said, [...] "I didn't know. The horse knew. All I did was keep his attention on the road." ...|$|E

6000|$|This delighted Kinney {{as much as}} {{the last}} {{refinement}} of hospitality would have pleased another man. [...] "Look here!" [...] he said, [...] "I want <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>come</b> out and see our camp. I can't fool away any more time on you here; but I want <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>come</b> out and see us.

6000|$|How did I finally {{save him}} from an asylum?
