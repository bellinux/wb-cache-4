Filmfare, in 2013, named Gabbar Singh the most iconic villain in the history of Indian cinema, and four actors were included in its 2010 list of [...] "80 Iconic Performances" [...] for their work in this film.|$|E

500|$|On November 18, the {{impatient}} Roosevelt directed {{that the}} second set of dies be used to strike coins, directly ordering the Mint to [...] "begin the new issue, even if it takes you all day to strike one piece!" [...] Over 12,000 of these [...] "High Relief" [...] pieces were struck and were released into circulation in 1907 and 1908. [...] Barber wrote of the High Relief pieces to Landis, [...] "Mr. Hart has put the mill into operation and I send <b>you</b> <b>two</b> pieces showing the result; these are not selected as all the coins now made are the same as these two, which gives me alarm as they are so well made that I fear the President may demand the continuance of this particular coin." [...] Barber completed work on his version of the design, with a greatly lowered relief, and the new coin went into production on a large-scale basis. [...] A total of 361,667of the revised design were produced by the Mint in 1907; the [...] "Low Relief" [...] coins were released into circulation at the end of [...] [...] Barber's modifications were denounced both by the sculptor's family and by Hering. [...] Among other alterations, Barber changed the Roman numeral MCMVII for the date to the Arabic numeral [...] "1907". [...] In spite of the modifications, according to R.S. Yeoman in his A Guide Book of United States Coins, many consider the Saint-Gaudens double eagles the most beautiful of U.S. coins.|$|E
500|$|In {{comparison}} to Cliff, Clair {{is usually the}} tougher and more sensible parent, offering her children legitimate advice that they can actually apply to their everyday lives; it remains clear to audiences that Clair runs the household. AskMen's Geoffrey Lansdell agreed that the character [...] "rel on a sly maternal quality that fed off of Bill Cosby’s silly paternal playfulness". However, there are occasionally times when Clair resorts to the [...] "wait till your father gets home" [...] method of disciplining her children. Clair generally supports her children's decisions and ever-changing ambitions, specifically in regards to schooling, marriage and careers. Both Clair and Cliff value the importance of proper education in their children's lives, appearing proudest when they {{do well in school}} and delivering the most serious punishments when they underperform academically. On one occasion, Theo rebels against his parents' high expectations of him, arguing, [...] "Because of what <b>you</b> <b>two</b> have achieved, the whole world expects a lot more from us than other kids. Let’s face it, there’s nowhere else left for us to go but down," [...] a statement Clair immediately reprimands him for making. When it comes to parenting, Clair usually maintains [...] "an allure of cool, calm confidence ... exhibit a strong but gentle parenting stance, one that wasn’t seen on television by a woman of color" [...] at the time, according to Global Grind's Desire Thompson. Clair practices disciplining her children without ever punishing them physically, often delivering punishments [...] "with a calm charm", and raises her four daughters to love and respect themselves. However, she is also known for ranting at her children when she loses her temper, one of her most recognizable of which is the one she gives Vanessa when she attends a concert in Baltimore against her parents' wishes. In the Season 3 episode [...] "The Shower", Denise hosts a wedding shower for a close friend who gets pregnant on purpose to blackmail her parents into letting her marry her fiancé as soon as possible. When Denise broaches the subject of how she would handle a similar situation, Clair sternly – but rather comically – insists that she will never find herself in a similar situation. Despite her seriousness and disciplinarian status, Clair seldom shies away from laughing and participating in fun activities alongside her family as opposed to simply observing them from the sidelines. The character is also fond of relaxing and taking time to herself away from her children whenever necessary.|$|E

2500|$|The dual number {{indicates}} {{a pair of}} things. Historically, the dual number has been a full grammatical number, participating as the third element in [...] singular - dual - plural distinction. During the last century, the dual was used more or less sporadically in Lithuanian, sometimes reaching {{the status of a}} full number for agreement purposes, meaning the dual of noun required dual agreement in its adjectives or the dual of the subject required the dual of the verb. But in many more cases the dual was reduced to a nominal category explicitly indicating a pair of things, but not requiring dual agreement of adjectives or verbs. Presently, the dual is mostly used as a declension paradigm for numbers du – two, abu – both (and a variant abudu – idem) and with personal pronouns aš – I, mùdu dual – we two (mẽs pl. – we) and tu sg. – you, jùdu dual – <b>you</b> <b>two</b> (jū̃s pl. – you).|$|E
2500|$|Although never a nationalist, Merezhkovsky was a Russo-centric {{author and}} thinker, cherishing {{the idea of}} his country's unique {{and in many ways}} decisive place in the world culture in history. Never tiring of reiterating the [...] "Russian plight is the problem of the world, not Russia" [...] postulate, he was ever on the {{look-out}} for some 'strong leader' who would be able to organize and successfully see through the anti-Communist crusade. For a while Merezhkovsky thought he's found his hero in Benito Mussolini who, having sponsored his book on Dante, had several lengthy talks with the Russian writer on politics, literature and art. Impressed, Merezhkovsky started to see his new friend as an incarnation of Dante, almost. In a letter addressed to Mussolini, he wrote:The best, the truest and the liveliest document on Dante is — your personality. To understand Dante one has to live through him, but only you being around makes that possible. Two souls, his and yours, are merged into one, Infinity itself bringing <b>you</b> <b>two</b> together.
