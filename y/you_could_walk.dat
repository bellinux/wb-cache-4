5|$|This work {{maintains}} a heavy {{importance in the}} Art History world, as {{it is widely believed}} to be the first painting, since the fall of Rome (ca. 476 AD), to use Scientific Linear One Point Perspective, or, all the orthogonals point to one vanishing point, in this case, Christ. Also, it is one of the first paintings that does away with the use of a head-cluster. A technique employed by earlier Proto-Renaissance artists, such as Giotto or Duccio. If you were to walk into the painting, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>walk</b> around Jesus Christ, in the semicircle created, and back out the painting again with ease.|$|E
500|$|Krankel and Hines {{looked at}} other story-focused games, {{and felt that}} they either were linear stories driven by set pieces, or branching, player choice-influenced stories [...] told through cut scenes. [...] "We thought, why not let you move freely while communicating, interacting, and {{exploring}} a branching narrative?" [...] Krankel recalled. [...] "The first thing {{we wanted to do}} is make a game where communication is really sort of a key mechanic, but that people have more freedom than they do with all the other narrative-focused games. At its core, we wanted to never have a cut scene in the game, where <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>walk</b> and move freely and communicate with your friends, and even communicate with other beings and other kind of strange things." [...] Rather than developing the gameplay and attaching a story to it, Night School focused on developing gameplay that would support the story they wanted to tell.|$|E
2500|$|As a {{consequence}} of his religious conversion, Wright eschewed the highlife favoured by many of his loyalist contemporaries such as Johnny Adair and Stephen McKeag, abstaining from alcohol, tobacco and illegal drugs. He read a lot, including Irish history and theology. In particular he studied the history of Protestantism in Europe. Wright's religious faith had contradictory influences on his life. On the one hand, he argued that his faith drove him to defend the [...] "Protestant people of Ulster", {{while at the same}} time, he conceded that the cold-blooded murder of non-combatant civilians would ensure his damnation. He spoke of this dilemma during an interview with Martin Dillon: [...] "You can't glorify God and seek to glorify Ulster because the challenges which are needed are paramilitary. That's a contradiction to the life God would want you to lead. If you were to get yourself involved in paramilitary activity in its present form, or the form in which it manifested itself during the Troubles, then I don't think <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>walk</b> with God...|$|E

6000|$|... "It {{might be}} {{possible}} if I could find a sheltered beach farther on, but it wouldn't be wise. You would find yourselves twenty or thirty {{miles from the nearest}} settlement, and <b>you</b> <b>could</b> never <b>walk</b> so far through the bush." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why, to be sure,' said Walter, {{glancing at}} her foot, 'mine are a mile too large. What am I {{thinking}} about! <b>You</b> never <b>could</b> <b>walk</b> in mine! Come along, Miss Dombey. Let {{me see the}} villain who will dare molest you now.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nonsense, father,' Dorothy exclaimed. 'Why, you {{are often}} out for {{eight or ten}} hours over the turnip fields with a gun, you know; <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>walk</b> four times as far as I could.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The same work. Always {{the same}} work!" [...] the officer said. [...] "And <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>walk</b> {{from here to}} the sea or to Switzerland in that ditch--and you'll find the same work going on everywhere. It isn't war." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Catriona," [...] said I, [...] "I know you're {{brave and}} I believe you're strong, {{do you think}} <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>walk</b> thirty miles on a plain road?" [...] We found it, I believe, scarce the two-thirds of that, but such was my notion of the distance.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am sure Nat {{will look}} well after us," [...] Myra said confidently; [...] "besides, mamma, I {{am certain that}} <b>you</b> <b>could</b> not <b>walk</b> down there. You know you never do walk, and I cannot {{recollect}} your walking so far as you have done to-day." ...|$|R
6000|$|Do {{you suspect}} death? If I were to suspect death, I should die now: Do <b>you</b> think I <b>could</b> <b>walk</b> pleasantly and well-suited toward annihilation? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "At any rate, O'Grady," [...] Terence laughed, [...] "I am half a head {{taller than}} <b>you</b> are, and <b>could</b> <b>walk</b> <b>you</b> off your legs any day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no, don't {{talk like}} that. We may be saved now that I {{have found a}} way. Oh, if only you could--if only <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>walk,</b> or if I had the {{strength}} to carry you!" [...] and she wrung her hands and began to weep, so weak was she.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a thin run," [...] said Harry. [...] "There'll {{probably}} {{be more of}} them in the next one. Once upon a time, as I expect you've heard, these rivers were so thick with fish that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>walk</b> across their backs, though I'll allow I've never seen anything of that kind." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should think}} so," [...] said Raymond, the more moved of the two. [...] "I tell you, Julius, that Rosamond {{was to me}} the only redeeming element in the day. I {{wanted to know whether}} <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>walk</b> with me to ask after that poor girl; I hear she came home one with her grandmother." ...|$|E

We'd {{never leave}} <b>you</b> if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> even <b>walk.</b> If {{we have to}} give you to the monks itself, we'd keep round the place to {{encourage}} you, only for the last business. We'll have to put two counties at least between us and Gortmore after what we're after doing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, here I am!" [...] Miss Winch dropped despairingly into a swivel-chair, and endeavoured {{to restore}} {{herself with a}} stick of chewing-gum. [...] "Fillmore, darling, you're the sweetest thing on earth, and I love you, but on present form <b>you</b> <b>could</b> just <b>walk</b> {{straight}} into Bloomingdale and they'd give you the royal suite." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am rested now. Oh, {{how good}} you have all been! I {{was just going to}} tell <b>you</b> that I <b>could</b> <b>walk</b> again. I am quite ready to go on now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It isn't far to walk, sir. Perhaps some day, {{when the}} May-fly is gone off, {{and the fish}} won't rise awhile, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>walk</b> down and see. I beg your pardon, sir, though, for {{thinking}} of such a thing. [...] They are not places fit for gentlemen, that's certain.' There was a staid irony in his tone, which Lancelot felt.|$|E
6000|$|... "You are a fraud, Arnold," [...] she declared. [...] "As {{if we did}} not know--I and Madame and all of us, that in Paris, even {{throughout}} France, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>walk</b> safely {{into any}} den of thieves you choose. Your courage isn't worth a snap of the fingers. Any man can be brave who has the archangels of Dotant at his elbows." ...|$|E
6000|$|When he {{had made}} his way with his guest through the crowd, she began to speak to her father before she noticed Corey. [...] "Well, Colonel, you've {{improved}} your last chance. We've been coming to every boat since four o'clock,--or Jerry has,--and I told mother that I would come myself once, and see if I couldn't fetch you; and if I failed, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>walk</b> next time. You're getting perfectly spoiled." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "And {{well they}} might, for I never saw so much dirt in my life. <b>Walk!</b> <b>You</b> <b>could</b> no more <b>walk</b> than <b>you</b> <b>could</b> fly! It {{has not been}} so dirty the whole winter; it is ankle-deep everywhere." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{makes all}} the {{difference}} how you walk, Miss Armstrong. No doubt, if you had been in good spirits, and with a pleasant party, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> have <b>walked</b> fifty miles in two days, although that is certainly a long distance for a woman; but depressed and almost despairing, as you were, it told upon you generally, and doubtless you rather dragged your feet along than walked." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Would {{you like}} {{to make up a}} class?" [...] she asked. [...] "But I do not know how the teacher and the two pupils could ride in this gig. Oh, I see. Miriam and I could sit here, and <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>walk</b> by our side and {{instruct}} us, and when the one who happened to be driving should make a mistake, she would give up her seat and the reins, and go to the foot of her class." ...|$|E
60|$|This sand {{seemed to}} us the {{connecting}} link between land and water. It {{was a kind of}} water on which <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>walk,</b> and you could see the ripple-marks on its surface, produced by the winds, precisely like those {{at the bottom of a}} brook or lake. We had read that Mussulmen are permitted by the Koran to perform their ablutions in sand when they cannot get water, a necessary indulgence in Arabia, and we now understood the propriety of this provision.|$|E
60|$|No one in Mariposa {{had ever}} seen {{anything}} like the caff. All down the side of it were the grill fires, with great pewter dish covers that went up and down on a chain, and <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>walk</b> along the row and actually pick out your own cutlet and then see the French marquis throw it on to the broiling iron; you could watch a buckwheat pancake whirled into existence under your eyes and see fowls' legs devilled, peppered, grilled, and tormented till they lost all semblance of the original Mariposa chicken.|$|E
5000|$|Prvan Selo is {{a village}} in Perušić, Croatia with amazing nature and wild life, last time the {{population}} was recorded the village had 97 people living there. Comforting people are always around you, you would fill right at home. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> also <b>walk</b> to perusic where <b>you</b> <b>could</b> shop and have drinks at local cafes and bars. A soccer competition is held on the mountains of Prvan selo once every year, a relaxing area is also near the soccer pitch with tables and chairs made by the Hecimovic family. There are also many walking tracks were you can literally feel like you are in mother natures hands. Prvan selo is a beautiful village.By julian ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was {{a damned}} bad photograph, that," [...] Mr. Raymond Greene pronounced. [...] "I saw it--couldn't make head nor tail of it, myself. Well, {{the world is}} full of queer surprises, but this is the queerest I ever ran up against. Believe me, Mr. Ware, if this man Romilly who {{disappeared}} had been a millionaire, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> have <b>walked</b> into his family circle and been made welcome at the present moment. Why, I don't believe his own wife or sister, if he had such appendages, would have been able to tell that you weren't the man." ...|$|R
5000|$|Holmes {{was also}} {{familiar}} {{with both the}} burgeoning Texas blues and jazz scenes, and soon, the club became known for its music {{as well as its}} food and drink. The club began attracting music lovers, no matter what their race. During its heyday in the 1950s, most of the popular national blues, rhythm and blues, and jazz acts that played Austin performed at the Victory Grill. Ike & Tina Turner, James Brown, Etta James, Billie Holiday, Chuck Berry and Janis Joplin were some of the artists who graced the stage. A resident of the area later quoted, [...] "The street was so crowded <b>you</b> <b>could</b> barely <b>walk.</b> It was like New Orleans." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'If <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>walk</b> {{we should}} {{have to go down}} the Street of Wells, where perhaps {{somebody}} would know me? Now if we get below here to the Cove, can't we push off one of the little boats I saw there last night, and paddle along close to the shore till we get to the north side? Then we can walk across to the station very well. It is quite calm, and as the tide sets in that direction, it will take us along of itself, without much rowing. I've often got round in a boat that way.' ...|$|E
6000|$|After Jim {{promised to}} find out whether there was any Indian {{reservation}} that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>walk</b> to, he pretended to study out in the geography that the only reservation there was in the State was away up close to Lake Erie, but it was not far from the same canal that ran through the Boy's Town to the lake, and Jim said, [...] "I'll tell you what, Pony! The way to do will be to get into a canal-boat, somehow, and that will take you to the reservation without your hardly having to walk a step; and you can have fun on the boat, too." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Lawrence, [...] "I don't {{think that}} would settle the affair at all. From what I {{understand}} of your relations with Miss March, she knows you are her lover, and yet she neither accepts nor declines you. If you were {{to go to her}} now, it is not likely she would give you any definite answer. But in regard to me, it would be different. She would say yes or no. And if she made the latter answer I think <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>walk</b> over the course. I am not vain enough to say that I have been an obstacle to your success, but I assure you that I have tried very hard to make myself such an obstacle." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{last month}} of the Kerensky regime was marked first by the falling off of the bread supply from 2 pounds a day to 1 pound, to half a pound, to {{a quarter of a}} pound, and, the final week, no bread at all. Holdups and crime {{increased}} {{to such an extent that}} <b>you</b> <b>could</b> hardly <b>walk</b> down the streets. The papers were full of it. Not only had the government broken down, but the municipal government had absolutely broken down. The city militia was quite disorganized and up in the air, and the street-cleaning apparatus and all that sort of thing had broken down — milk and everything of that sort." ...|$|R
6000|$|I wish <b>you</b> <b>could</b> {{suddenly}} <b>walk</b> {{into this}} valley, {{which seems to}} have been made by the flashing scimitar of the river that cuts through the mountain. Ah! you in England, and in Belgium still less, do not know what scenery is, what Nature is when she is natural. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> as soon guess at a tiger from the cat on the hearthstone. You do not know; but, being a poet, you can dream. You have divine insights, as we all have, of heaven, all of us with whom the mortal mind does not cake and obstruct into cecity. No, no, no. I protest against anything I have not reprinted. The Prometheus poems bear the mark of their time, which was one of greenness and immaturity. Indeed, the responsibility for what I acknowledge in print is hard enough to bear. Don't put another stick on the overloaded--ass, shall I say candidly? ...|$|R
