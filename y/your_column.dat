5000|$|So {{impressed}} was I with my discovery, that I rode rapidly back to {{the point}} on the Plank road where I had left my cavalry, and back down the road Jackson was moving, until I met [...] "Stonewall" [...] himself. [...] "General," [...] said I, [...] "if you will ride with me, halting <b>your</b> <b>column</b> here, out of sight, I will show you the enemy's right, and you will perceive the great advantage of attacking down the Old turnpike instead of the Plank road, the enemy's lines being taken in reverse. Bring only one courier, as you will be in view {{from the top of the}} hill." [...] Jackson assented, and I rapidly conducted him to the point of observation. There had been no change in the picture.I only knew Jackson slightly. I watched him closely as he gazed upon Howard's troops. It was then about 2 P.M. His eyes burned with a brilliant glow, lighting up a sad face. His expression was one of intense interest, his face was colored slightly with the paint of approaching battle, and radiant at the success of his flank movement. To the remarks made to him while the unconscious line of blue was pointed out, he did not reply once during the five minutes he was on the hill, and yet his lips were moving. From what I have read and heard of Jackson since that day, I know now what he was doing then. Oh! [...] "beware of rashness," [...] General Hooker. Stonewall Jackson is praying in full view and in rear of your right flank! While talking to the Great God of Battles, how could he hear what a poor cavalryman was saying. [...] "Tell General Rodes," [...] said he, suddenly whirling his horse towards the courier, [...] "to move across the Old plank road; halt when he gets to the Old turnpike, and I will join him there." [...] One more look upon the Federal lines, and then he rode rapidly down the hill, his arms flapping to the motion of his horse, over whose head it seemed, good rider as he was, he would certainly go. I expected to be told I had made a valuable personal reconnaissance - saving the lives of many soldiers, and that Jackson was indebted to me to that amount at least. Perhaps I might have been a little chagrined at Jackson's silence, and hence commented inwardly and adversely upon his horsemanship. Alas! I had looked upon him for the last time.

So do gird out the rest. [] I can use for the Feby issue if the rest of yours is not ready in time, so you need not fear February 8. 1931. My Dear Dear [], I have been so occupied with court work {{in the past two weeks}} that I have not had the opportunity to go over my spring docket & consider it carefully the [] to the subject we discussed two weeks ago. First I want to say how greatly I enjoyed my visit with you the reminiscences of the old times. In spite of the comedies & some tragedy that were enacted, I shall always regard with affection the protagonists in the stage of that day. I love every one of them, even tho both the [] & the actionno matter how conceal his make-up appears to us now. Now about course in Federal Procedure. Looking over my calendar I find that I shall have a heavy trial docket in April, but until then I have two months, & I shall also have the months of May & June not so crowded. The [] indicated that ten hours of preparation are required for one hour of instruction & there will be approx. 50 hours in the course requiring 300 hours of preparation. I can put in about 200 hours before the course begins. That will leave about three hours additional preparation every day as the course progressed. If this is sufficient, & if continued residence during the course is not required, I think I could swing it, but I do not feel that I should undertake an additional course in August. In years past tho not recently I have suffered with hay fever in the latter part of August, & I would not want to have anything of that kind interfere with the work. The [] intended to send me a book on the subject but I have not yet received it. Of you think that this outline of the situation, together with what we have discussed, warrants further consideration of my accepting the course, I shall be glad to come to AA whenever it is convenient for you. February 14 1932. My dear []- I have been so engaged that I did not have time to read your article until today. The best part I think is the keen analysis of the [] of Trust Company management. That speaks for itself & needs no retuperation to reinforce it. In fact I think the whole story can be most effectively toed in an off-hand way with the emphasis of understatement. I have indicated with brackets the parts which I think you could as well leave out. Of course, economic forces are working the passing of trust companies. One part is from my brief, which, of course, should not go in. Well, we are getting ready for another liquidation. Soon the shouting & the tumult over the Reconstruction finance Corps, etc, will die and then the real depression will begin when the these artificial stimuli are compelled to meet the test of economic laws. Let me know where to look for your article. I am working on “The Responsibilities & Powers of Govt in Economic Crises”- Yours G. O. March 15. 1934. My dear Mr. Warner- Thank you for all your kindness & consideration showed to my Mother & Sister. It is certainly unusual to find such a spirit of friendliness in a city hotel. I am trying to persuade my Mother and sister to come home with me, since the doctor says it is entirely possible for Mother to make the trip to Toledo. In the meantime, just give them anything they need to make them comfortable and send the bill to me. Please remember me to your good Mother & Mrs. Warner. Very truly yours Gustavus Ohlinger Toledo O., Oct 11 1934. Mr. William Roche C/o News Bee Toledo My Dear Bill- In reading <b>your</b> <b>column</b> this evening I notice that you do me the honor of naming me as one of the Republican campaign speakers. I don’t know how you came to do this, as I certainly did not give my name to you, or to anyone else. It required twelve years of Republican administration to all but ruin this country, & so far the party has presented no plan for repairing the damage which its leaders did. Democratic leadership should have at least four years to demonstrate what it can do- if at the end of that time it can show no results, & some other party develops a program, we can have a change. Just now the major issue in Toledo is the City Manager Amendment. The adoption of that amendment will mark a long step toward recovery for this city- and I expect to devote whatever energy & time I have to secure that result. This letter is personal- to set you right on my attitude- and is not for publication. Sincerely Gustavus Ohlinger April 16. 1935 My dear Mr. Zants- Just a word of congratulation for the fine showing the students of DeVilbiss made last evening. you and your faculty are to be highly commended for having stimulated such a fine spirit of emulation and achievement. Your invitation to Lucy to play has meant a great deal to her- I can notice already a renewed interest in school. I hope you may have the opportunity to assign her to other tasks, so that DeVilbiss may during the year that remains become the dominating interest in her life. I want her to develop a sense of responsibility to her school. You have done a great deal toward this result. I assure you that I appreciate it. Mr Merritt C. Nauts Sincerely yours, Principal DeVilbiss High School Gustavus Ohlinger This you [] gives you my varied experience against your five year time after college graduation. Just now I’m in the 8000 foot elevation at edge of Death Valley where my son (and wife) are for the summer months then back to Furnace Creek in October.

Will you let me have your criticisms soon as you can I want to get rid of []- It is easier to ramble than to condense. EIM Monday Jauary 9. 1936 My dear Rabbi Fencer- I believe that you will agree with me that this highest tribute which a sermon, such as yours this morning can receive is evidence that it has provoked thought even though the thinking may not be entirely in line with the conclusions of the speaker. This is the reason for the letter. I quite agree with you that the dark ages impend- but I cannot concur in your reasons. The darkness descends upon a man as upon a nation rules when the man or the nation fails to see the blinding light on the road to Damascus or if seeing it he is disobedient to the heavenly vision. Nor can I agree with you that wars are all inconclusive. Without []. There[] we would not have had Socrates and Plato, without [] the Declaration of Independence would not have been written, and without the Civil War there would have been no Emancipation Proclamation. It is not that wars are inconclusive it is rather that those who participated in them lose the vision that came in the blinding light on the road to Damascus. We had the vision in 1917, 1918, & 1919 - Woodrow Wilson was the apostle of better world which that vision disclosed- but alas, his people could not see it and re-turned to the flesh pots of Egypt. The other night I saw a picture taken at the bombardment of Nanking- a boy weeping in unrestrained grief at the body of his father, the wife lifting the lifeless hand of her husband. That was a personal accusation to me- that lifeless hand points at the heart of every American- and unless America can respond to that pointing hand America will die, & we can only hope then that the insuing dark ages will be so dark that there may be not even a glimmer to reveal our history and our refusals of our destiny. War is terrible- but there are things wors than war. Paul’s obedience to the heavenly vision led to imprisonment & crucifixion- should he have returned to Jerusalem? After all, war and death and life are only portals of existence. the abiding thing is the decending light on the Road to Damascus! With great appreciation for what you said, I remain Very sincerely, Gustavus Ohlinger To Rabbi Leon I Fencer Toledo March 13. 1936. My dear Jack- The people at Ann Arbor have asked me to repeat the Course on Federal Jurisdiction this Summer. I am therefore preposing a new outline. I enclose a copy of the first chapter. As you are one of my graduates, I wish you would look it over and favor me with your criticism. Do you think it would assist the students if I had the outline printed making a copy available to everyone? Or should the students discover the sequences for themselves? Please return the enclosed when you have looked it over as I have only two copies. I suppose you will be here for the Spring Vacation & will try to have a talk at that time. Sincerely yours Gustavus Ohlinger June 11. 1936. My dear Mr. Klinsmeyer: I have your letter of the seventh with the exceedingly generous offer of a scholarship for pious study with Severen [] for Lucy. Needless to say such an opportunity to work [] and Lucy is very anxious to take advantage of it. We have been in considerable doubt about what to do. I had come to the conclusion that perhaps she did not have the ability or talent to justify a major effort along musical lines & for that reason Lucy placed her application for the Arts Department of Oberlin College with possibly minor attention to music. Of course the time to June 15 is very short, but Lucy has decided she would rather forego a summer at Crystal Lake which to her is the loveliest spot in all the world than lose the opportunity with Mr. Eisenberger. Would it be satisfactory if Lucy owes to C[] next Friday prepared to stay for six weeks, provided Mr. Eisenberger finds that she justifies her interest & instruction? If she does we may change all our plans for her future studies. If she does not show sufficient promise she will enter the Arts department at Oberlin or some other college. If you will wire me at my charge what you think of this we will send Lucy to[] next Friday- or sooner if you desire. Thanking you again for the opportunity you have presented. Yours very truly, Gustavus Ohlinger June 11, 1936 My dear [] Your delightful letter was awaiting me on my return from the office yesterday evening. I am so glad you saw Ann Arbor in all the beauty of early spring- it is romantic. [] always look forward to my six weeks of returning there and to the opportunity as change from the driving business world into the atmosphere of residence freedom. Our great regret is that you did not have the opportunity of staying over in Toledo. [] you make a break on one of your visits in Michigan, for a short stay with us? We would have so much to discuss about the wondrous ways of life- our visit with you was so interesting and inspiring. Now about Lucy- she graduated from DeVilbiss High School last Friday. She ranked among the highest twenty five in a class of over five hundred. So far as a continued musical education is concerned we have been in doubt- were by no means sure that she has the ability to say nothing of talent that would justify a continuance of a major effort in the direction. We had about concluded to send her to Oberlin- Lucy wants to go to a small college and a small college town- and let her follow an academic course with music as a minor. So she has placed an application rather belatedly for admission to the Arts department. Having applied so late we do not know whether she will be accepted. With your letter also came one from Mr. Klusmeyer offering Lucy two lessons a week with Mr. Eisenberger on a scholarship bases. This has given her the third of her young life, you can imagine. The effect it has had when [] you that she was willing to forgo a seminar at our Crystal Lake cottage- and that spot to her is the embodiment of undying romance. After talking is over on the family [] we have decided to do this provided it meets with your approval & the approval of Mr. Klinsmeyer- Lucy to come to C[] next Friday prepared to spend six weeks of Mr. Eisenberger thinks she can justify her interest in her. If she does not show sufficient promise, he can of course tell her so, and she could return at any time he would also be in a better position to judge whether we should continue with our old plan or whether we should change the program to a major effort along musical lines. I am writing Mr. Klunsmeyer about this. if after he and Mr. Eisenberger talk with Lucy next Friday they can judge better the situation. Thank you dear cousin for your kind interest in the problem. Lucy is looking forward to seeing you again and even though she does not stay she would have another memorable visit in [] But do try to stop over with us some time. Affectionately Gustavus Sunday Oct 4. 1936. My dear Frazier= As you know last spring I had grave doubts about the Republican Party being able to develop anything but false issues. Since then Landon has proved himself inept, & Knox’s attempts to start runs on the banks & insurance companies are saved from criminality only by the fact that nobody pays any attention to what he says. President Roosevelts monetary policies as expressed by him to the World Economic Conference I 933 have now had a marvelous indication in the accord between Great Britain, France and the United States. If I can do anything to and in Roosevelts’ reelection, just let me know. Best wishes, Gustavus Ohlinger Personal Frazier Reams Democratic Headquarters Columbus, O. 11 / 11 / 47 My dear Gertrude, Helen read to me last evening the account of your exploits and embarrassments in New York in trying to find the American Association of the United Nations, & in getting to Lake Success- These, together with your appearances with when have probably given you enough “shocks” to last for a long time. I am glad you finally came through without permanent injury or disfigurement. Now about John. You & Bess will probably see more of him continuously in the next three weeks than we have ever since he went fortune of his own making, & our social position & prominence. There is no reason whatever why he should be satisfied with anything less than the best. I had a terrific struggle with Alice & Helen last winter over Alice’s willingness to follow the same course. That was the reason for my arranging for Alice to go to San Diego. Fortunately I succeeded in getting Alice to see things more clearly & I think she is properly orientated now. But John is certainly a hard problem- all the harder because he is never here long enough to enable us to talk to him. Furthermore, he is so good, pleasant & obliging that he immediately agrees with everything you say, & then pays to Dartmouth in 1933. In spite of his brilliant record at Dartmouth, & all his achievements since, he seems to be a waif in life, with no fixed abode or permanent future. He is too willing to slip back, both in his social contacts and in his career. I think you noticed this when you sized up his associates in New York. This tendency must be stopped- he must learn to look to the top instead of at the bottom. In his social affairs, particularly in female contacts, he is too easily inclined to accept whatever left-overs may remain on the bargain counter. John has everything- physique, education, many honors, a small no further attention to it- So I wish you would use the opportunities of contact which you will have during the next three weeks to see what can be done. Write me personally at the office about the situation, as it is better that the matter be kept strictly between us. We enjoyed your visit here and only wish you had stayed longer. Affectionately, Gustavus January 14, 50 Mr. Robert Dancer 2233 Dundas Rod [] Dear Mr. Dancer- I enclose herewith receipted bill for $ 17. 74 which I paid to A. H.
