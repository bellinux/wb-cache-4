60|$|LUBIN. You and <b>your</b> <b>newspaper</b> confederates {{took the}} peace {{out of my}} hands. The peace did not find me out {{because it did not}} find me in.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{are not to}} come to business, and I do {{not want}} things to go easy. I believe you said some things of me in <b>your</b> <b>newspaper</b> that were very scurrilous." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is about}} the soundest idea," [...] said Psmith, [...] "that has ever been struck. One of <b>your</b> <b>newspaper</b> friends shall supply us with tickets, and Friday night shall see us at the Highfield." ...|$|E
50|$|Monday Buzz: Somewhat of a {{spin-off}} of Tomorrow's Headlines Tonight, each Sunday Coleman and Rickard {{run down}} the top stories that <b>your</b> <b>newspapers</b> will be covering tomorrow.|$|R
5000|$|I take <b>your</b> <b>newspaper's</b> concern seriously, {{and your}} readers' {{perceptions}} even more seriously. But {{at the same}} time, as a cartoonist and former reporter, I don't steer away from controversy.|$|R
6000|$|... "What good {{could you}} do me? I had Martha to nurse me and the doctor every day. You are too busy to write to women or to think about them. You have your books and <b>your</b> <b>newspapers,</b> and <b>your</b> {{politics}} and your railroads to occupy you. I wrote when I was well." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{you mean}} the little problem of the Grosvenor Square {{furniture}} van. That is quite cleared up now--though, indeed, it was obvious from the first. Pray give me the results of <b>your</b> <b>newspaper</b> selections." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "True enough! But {{you could}} take life easily and read <b>your</b> <b>newspaper</b> in comfort, without being in any hurry to get down town to business. Twenty-five {{millions}} would bring you a cozy little income, if properly invested." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{picked up}} a copy of <b>your</b> <b>newspaper</b> on a seat in the Park," [...] Burton replied. [...] "I saw that article on 'London Awake.' I thought if that sort of thing was worth printing, it was worth paying for, so I tried to do {{something}} like it. It is so easy to write just what you see," [...] he concluded, apologetically.|$|E

6000|$|... "Ah! you, too, are gallant," [...] she said. [...] "But indeed, then, I fear {{you will}} not be flattered when I tell you why I was so interested. I read all <b>your</b> <b>newspapers.</b> I read of that terrible murder in Crooked Friars' Alley only a few days ago,--is not that how you call the place?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Without doubt," [...] the Prince answered, [...] "life moves {{very much}} in the East as with you here. Only with us," [...] he added a little thoughtfully, [...] "there is a {{difference}}, a difference of which one is reminded at a time like this, when one reads <b>your</b> <b>newspapers</b> and hears the conversation of one's friends." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'd gladly come down, Howard, if {{it seemed}} to make the least {{difference}} to you," [...] said Honora. [...] "But {{all you do is}} to sit with <b>your</b> <b>newspaper</b> propped up and read the stock reports, and growl when I ask you a polite question. You've no idea how long it makes the days out here, to get up early." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, that's {{the best}} place," [...] Ricker commented. [...] "What I always wonder at in {{you is the}} rapidity with which you Ve taken on the city. You were quite in the green wood when you came here, and now you know your Boston like a little man. I suppose it's <b>your</b> <b>newspaper</b> work that's {{familiarized}} you with the place. Well, {{how do you like}} your friend Witherby, as far as you've gone?" ...|$|E
6000|$|LUBIN [with dignified emotion, wounded, {{but without}} bitterness] Excuse me, Mr Barnabas; but before I answer that {{question}} I want to say this. Burge: we have had differences of opinion; and <b>your</b> <b>newspaper</b> friends have said hard things of me. But we worked together for years; and I hope I have done nothing to justify you in the amazing accusation you have just brought against me. Do {{you realize that you}} said that I have no conscience? ...|$|E
60|$|VICOMTE DE NANJAC. I {{read all}} <b>your</b> English <b>newspapers.</b> I find them so amusing.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{ways of the}} infidel." [...] {{said the}} little Sultan, calmly {{resuming}} his pipe, [...] "are beyond the compass of the true intelligence of the Faithful. Yet I thought it was so even as here. I had read in <b>your</b> <b>newspapers</b> that after <b>your</b> last election your ministers were buried alive--buried under a landslide, was it not? We thought it--here in Turkey--a noble fate for them." ...|$|R
40|$|Am {{very pleased}} to receive all <b>your</b> <b>newspapers,</b> it is {{delightful}} to read such vigorous and scholarly productions.

He is hoping Mr Smith will offer him a partnership when he finishes his study and is admitted. C 4 /C 15...|$|R
6000|$|... "How? <b>Your</b> <b>newspaper</b> is unbroken. Not a tack is disturbed. But {{suppose she}} did! How about the books? Did she get the books with her feet? How about the broad hand which I saw? How about the candy-box which was {{moved from a}} point seven feet away? How could she slip from her bonds? See these threads, {{actually}} sunk into her wrists!" [...] I continued. [...] "No, my conviction {{is that she has}} not once moved." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm hanged if {{you don't}} get more mysterious every moment!" [...] Richard exclaimed vigorously. [...] "What's it all about? Can't you even be safe {{in your room}} for five minutes without keeping {{one of those little}} {{articles}} under <b>your</b> <b>newspaper</b> while you read your letters?" [...] he added, lifting with his stick the sheet which Hunterleys had hastily thrown over a small revolver. [...] "What's it all about, eh? Are you plotting to dethrone the Prince of Monaco and take his place?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 8. Never {{forget that}} if you leave your law to judges and your {{religion}} to bishops, you will presently find yourself without either law or religion. If you doubt this, ask any decent judge or bishop. Do NOT ask somebody who {{does not know what}} a judge is, or what a bishop is, or what the law is, or what religion is. In other words, do not ask <b>your</b> <b>newspaper.</b> Journalists are too poorly paid in this country to know anything that is fit for publication.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{trust to}} mine, which gives forth no {{uncertain}} note on this question, as <b>your</b> favorite <b>newspapers</b> {{are fond of}} saying." ...|$|R

60|$|I--It {{makes me}} regard your {{interesting}} nation {{with the same}} shuddering curiosity that I should bestow on a Pappan cannibal chewing the scalp off his mother's skull. Does that convey any idea to your mind? It makes me regard the whole pack of you as heathens--real heathens--not the sort you send missions to--creatures of another flesh and blood. You {{ought to have been}} shot, not dead, but through the stomach, for your share in the scandalous business, and the thing you call <b>your</b> <b>newspaper</b> ought to have been sacked by the mob, and the managing proprietor hanged.|$|E
6000|$|... "MY DEAR SIR,--I do {{not know}} whether the bearer will suit you; but, unless the office of 'devil' in <b>your</b> <b>newspaper</b> is a purely {{technical}} one, I think he has all the qualities required. He is very quick, active, and intelligent; understands English better than he speaks it; and makes up for any defect by his habits of observation and imitation. You have only to show him how to do a thing once, and he will repeat it, whether it is an offence or a virtue. But you certainly know him already. You are one of his godfathers; for is he not Wan Lee, the reputed son of Wang the conjurer, to whose performances I had the honor to introduce you? But perhaps you have forgotten it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't let us make {{mountains}} out of molehills," [...] he said. [...] "I did kiss her--there! A woman {{pressing the}} prettiest little purse {{you ever saw}} into your hand, and wishing you many happy returns of the day with the tears in her eyes; I should {{like to know what}} else was to be done but to kiss her. Ah, yes, smooth out <b>your</b> <b>newspaper</b> report, and have another look at it! She did rest her head on my shoulder, poor soul, and she did say, 'Oh, Amelius, I thought my heart was turned to stone; feel how you have made it beat!' When I remembered what she had told me in the boat, I declare to God I almost burst out crying myself--it was so innocent and so pitiful." ...|$|E
60|$|PRAG. I know this, {{that capital}} is power. What is the workmen's vote against it? against <b>your</b> <b>newspapers</b> and <b>your</b> system? America, {{she will not}} be free until your money power is broken. You don't like kings and emperors, no,--you say to us workmens, you are not patriots, you are traitors if you do not work and fight to win this war for {{democracy}} against kings. Are we fools that we should worry about kings? Kings will fall of themselves. Now you can put me in jail.|$|R
2500|$|His [...] "Appeal for Amnesty" [...] letter {{called for}} the release of six {{political}} prisoners from around the world. It began: [...] "Open <b>your</b> <b>newspapers</b> - {{any day of the week}} – and you will find a report from somewhere in the world of someone being imprisoned, tortured or executed because his opinions or religion are unacceptable to his government. The newspaper readers feel a sickening sense of impotence. Yet if these feelings of disgust all over the world could be united into common action, something effective could be done" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{were two}} American comisionistas at Valverde {{and they must}} have heard {{the story in the}} cafés. It is, you understand, a romantic episode: the {{daughter}} of a well-known financier elopes with a foreign soldier. The comisionistas talk about it when they return and <b>your</b> <b>newspapers</b> {{make the most of the}} tale. Some of them are not reserved or fastidious. It is possible they print your portrait. One can imagine the astonishment of your friends, but the story would be incomplete if it did not end with a romantic wedding." ...|$|R
60|$|And so you think, do you, {{that the}} chief use of Logic, in real life, is to deduce Conclusions from {{workable}} Premisses, and to satisfy yourself that the Conclusions, deduced by other people, are correct? I only wish it were! Society would be much less liable to panics and other delusions, and POLITICAL life, especially, would be a totally different thing, if even {{a majority of the}} arguments, that scattered broadcast over the world, were correct! But it is all the other way, I fear. For ONE workable Pair of Premisses (I mean a Pair that lead to a logical Conclusion) that you meet with in reading <b>your</b> <b>newspaper</b> or magazine, you will probably find FIVE that lead to no Conclusion at all: and, even when the Premisses ARE workable, for ONE instance, where the writer draws a correct Conclusion, there are probably TEN where he draws an incorrect one.|$|E
60|$|This {{made a great}} {{impression}} on my mind, and I really lived in this faith until some years ago it happened upon a stormy night I was kindly escorted from a bleak railway station to the little out-of- the-way town it represented by a sprightly and vivacious newsman, to whom I propounded, as we went along under my umbrella--he being most excellent company--this old question, what was the one all- absorbing passion of the human soul? He replied, without the slightest hesitation, that it certainly was the passion for getting <b>your</b> <b>newspaper</b> in advance of your fellow-creatures; also, if you only hired it, to get it delivered at your own door {{at exactly the same}} time as another man who hired the same copy four miles off; and, finally, the invincible determination {{on the part of both}} men not to believe the time was up when the boy called.|$|E
60|$|In order, therefore, {{to arrive}} at what really is {{sensation}} in an occurrence which, at first sight, seems to contain nothing else, we have to pare away all that is due to habit or expectation or interpretation. This {{is a matter for}} the psychologist, and by no means an easy matter. For our purposes, it is not important to determine what exactly is the sensational core in any case; it is only important to notice that there certainly is a sensational core, since habit, expectation and interpretation are diversely aroused on diverse occasions, and the diversity is clearly due to differences in what is presented to the senses. When you open <b>your</b> <b>newspaper</b> in the morning, the actual sensations of seeing the print form a very minute part of what goes on in you, but they are the starting-point of all the rest, and it is through them that the newspaper is a means of information or mis-information. Thus, although {{it may be difficult to}} determine what exactly is sensation in any given experience, it is clear that there is sensation, unless, like Leibniz, we deny all action of the outer world upon us.|$|E
6000|$|... "There I'm stuck," [...] Mr. Coulson admitted. [...] "There's {{only one}} thing I can tell you, {{and that is that}} I believe he had a lot more money on him than the amount {{mentioned}} in <b>your</b> <b>newspapers</b> this morning. My own opinion is that he was murdered for what he'd got. A smart thief would say that a fellow who takes a special tug off the steamer and a special train to town was a man worth robbing. How the thing was done I don't know--that's for your police to find out--but I reckon that whoever killed him did it for his cash." ...|$|R
60|$|EMPEROR. I {{think your}} private ground may be <b>your</b> own private <b>newspaper.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am going}} to a mission room in the neighbourhood," [...] he explained. [...] "We have war talks every week. I try to tell them {{how things are going}} on, and we have a short service. But before I go, Mr. Stenson has sent you a little message, Julian. If you go to your club later on to-night, you will see it in the telegrams, or you will find it in <b>your</b> <b>newspapers</b> in the morning. There has been {{wonderful}} fighting in Flanders to-day. The German line has been broken at half a dozen points. We have taken nearly twenty thousand prisoners, and Zeebrugge is threatened. Farther south, the Americans have made their start and have won a complete victory over the Crown Prince's picked troops." ...|$|R
