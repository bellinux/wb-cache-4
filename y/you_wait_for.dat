500|$|Equally {{proficient}} {{as both a}} blocker and runner, Johnson {{was described}} as [...] "the perfect NFL fullback". A talented runner, he ran with power {{both inside and outside}} the tackles, and he was as fast as McElhenny and Perry. Jim Brown called Johnson the greatest running back he had ever seen. He was also a very skilled safety and linebacker on defense. During a preseason game in 1955, Johnson hit Chicago Cardinals halfback Charley Trippi so hard that he fractured Trippi's face in multiple places, leaving him with a smashed nose and concussion and all but ended his career. [...] "Football was like a combat zone," [...] said Johnson. [...] "I was always told that you carry the impact to the opponent. If <b>you</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> it, the impact will be on you." ...|$|E
500|$|The primary {{antagonist}} of {{the novel}} is Kobus Breed, a mercenary with a disfigured face and a permanently weeping eye who had previously served with the Rhodesian Light Infantry in Matabeleland; Olen Steinhauer, writing in The New York Times thinks the scarred villain to be [...] "an obligatory nod toward the requirements of the Bond formula". Some writers were unimpressed with Breed; Robert Crampton of The Sunday Times thought that the character [...] "feels more like a henchman than a proper power-crazed villain. He has menace, but no ambition. <b>You</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> the evil genius to turn up—but he never does", while David Sexton in the London Evening Standard wrote that the character [...] "lacks charisma", and David Connett in the Sunday Express considered him [...] "a colourless character in comparison with factual and fictional counterparts". The journalist Geoffrey Wansell in the Daily Mail disagreed, writing that Breed, along with a second villain, millionaire Hulbert Linck, were as strong as some of Fleming's villains; Steinhauer also thought that the novel's villains were realistic, [...] "motivated by simple greed yet clever enough to be legitimately dangerous". There are two main female characters in Solo— horror film actress Bryce Fitzjohn and the local MI6 contact Efua Blessing Ogilvy-Grant; like many of Fleming's female characters, both are [...] "determined females who are not to be patronised by Bond".|$|E

500|$|Despite her ongoing {{relationship}} with Rhys, the series explores possibilities {{of a romantic}} connection between Gwen and her boss Jack. In a 2007 interview, Eve Myles describes the relationship between Jack and Gwen as a [...] "palpable love" [...] and stated that [...] "it's the real thing and they're going to make <b>you</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> that." [...] AfterElton's Locksley Hall interprets Jack's attraction to Gwen as being influenced by [...] "her warmth, her sense of justice, her very ordinariness and lack of glamour", whilst Myles states of Gwen's interest in Jack that [...] "the most monogamous {{woman in the world}} would probably go for him". Stephen James Walker quotes the firing range sequence in 2006 episode [...] "Ghost Machine" [...] as an example of romantic tension between the pair as well as the scene where Jack discovers Gwen engagement. Gwen remains monogamous during the second series and [...] "fights every day to be with [...] " [...] even though Jack remains [...] "a huge temptation". Her suspension between Jack and Rhys becomes a central theme; Valerie Frankel believes that Gwen is caught between [...] "Rhys, the sweet, kind handsome prince, and Jack, the compelling trickster". She suggests that Jack is not mature enough to occupy the role of [...] "steady prince" [...] for Gwen. John Barrowman feels that if Jack were to settle down with her [...] "he'd have to commit completely"; this is why he does not act on his feelings, because though Gwen would let him flirt with other people, he could [...] "never afford to do anything more".|$|E
500|$|Barrowman {{states in}} a behind-the-scenes {{featurette}} that Gwen brings a [...] "little bit of soul" [...] back to Jack, following her recruitment. In a 2007 interview, Eve Myles, who plays Gwen, describes the relationship between Jack and Gwen as a [...] "palpable love" [...] and opines that [...] "with Jack and Gwen, it’s the real thing and they’re going to make <b>you</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> that." [...] The first two series suggest the possibility of romantic and sexual tension behind Jack and Gwen's working relationship, with Stephen James Walker drawing on the firing range sequence in series one episode [...] "Ghost Machine" [...] as a key example, {{as well as the}} scene where Jack discovers that Gwen has become engaged to Rhys in [...] "Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang", the series two opener. AfterElton.com's Locksley Hall conjectures that Jack is attracted to Gwen because of [...] "her warmth, her sense of justice, her very ordinariness and lack of glamour", whilst Eve Myles explains Gwen's attraction to Jack by stating: [...] "the most monogamous woman in the world would probably go for him– it'd be hard not to". Valerie Estelle Frankel describes Jack as a [...] "compelling trickster", who acts out Gwen's private desires with his [...] "outrageous flirting". She suggests that Jack (unlike Rhys) is not mature enough to occupy the role of [...] "steady prince" [...] for Gwen, whilst Barrowman feels that if Jack were to settle down with her, [...] "he'd have to commit completely"; this is why he does not act on his feelings, because though Gwen would let him flirt with other people, he could [...] "never afford to do anything more". Gareth David-Lloyd, who played Ianto, feels that for Jack, [...] "there’s two different sorts of love going on there", and that Jack feels for Gwen and Ianto in different ways, although both have helped him become less emotionally isolated. [...] Lynnette Porter feels that part of the reason Jack leaves Earth at the conclusion of Children of Earth is Gwen's idealisation of Jack, which is so intense that he cannot stand to look at her in the wake of Ianto's death. Gwen hopes that she is reason enough for Jack to stay on Earth, but Jack is ready to give up any hero worship because he feels unworthy.|$|E

[...] "On this record we really tried to write together," [...] Maida says. [...] "It’s easy for me to come in with a song, say here it is, lets go record it and it’ll be done in a couple of days.

2500|$|Bukowski died {{of leukemia}} on March 9, 1994, in San Pedro, aged 73, shortly after {{completing}} his last novel, Pulp. The funeral rites, orchestrated by his widow, {{were conducted by}} Buddhist monks. He is interred at Green Hills Memorial Park in Rancho Palos Verdes. An account of the proceedings {{can be found in}} Gerald Locklin's book Charles Bukowski: A Sure Bet. His gravestone reads: [...] "Don't Try", a phrase which Bukowski uses in one of his poems, advising aspiring writers and poets about inspiration and creativity. Bukowski explained the phrase in a 1963 letter to John William Corrington: [...] "Somebody at one of these places [...] asked me: 'What do you do? How do you write, create?' You don't, I told them. You don't try. That's very important: not to try, either for Cadillacs, creation or immortality. You wait, and if nothing happens, you wait some more. It's like a bug high on the wall. <b>You</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> it to come to you. When it gets close enough you reach out, slap out and kill it. Or if you like its looks you make a pet out of it." [...] Bukowski was an atheist.|$|E
