50|$|Phyllis <b>Yes’s</b> {{interest}} in socially prescribed gender roles dates to her youth, {{when she realized}} that her elderly neighbor was helpless to care for himself after his wife died. She noted, “He didn’t {{know how to use}} the dishwasher, the can opener...If it had been the wife who had survived, she probably wouldn’t have known how to find the fuse box.” In her mid-20s, when she was a U.S. Peace Corps volunteer teaching art in northeastern Brazil, she encountered Brazilian gender roles that were different from those she grew up with, such as women who smoked pipes and men who sold fabrics. The experience heightened her awareness that cultures vary widely in their perceptions of “feminine” and “masculine” traits and artifacts. <b>Yes’s</b> key artistic influences include the sculptor Louise Nevelson, as well as feminist artists Judy Chicago and Miriam Schapiro, who urged other women artists “to discover personal imagery and imagery that might honor the neglected and unfairly denigrated women’s decorative and domestic arts of the past.” This impulse influenced <b>Yes’s</b> “highly praised” paintings of lace in the 1970s and 1980s.|$|R
