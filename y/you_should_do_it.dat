500|$|In 2007, after Pearl Jam's 2006 tour had ended, {{the band}} members began {{recording}} demo material on their own while staying in occasional contact via e-mail. Guitarist Mike McCready revealed {{at the time that}} he had tested out some ideas with guitarist Stone Gossard and drummer Matt Cameron in separate sessions as well. After the band was invited to record The Who's [...] "Love, Reign o'er Me" [...] for the Reign Over Me soundtrack, they opted to call long-time collaborator Brendan O'Brien to produce their cover. During the experience, O'Brien and Pearl Jam decided it was a good time for them to work again in a studio album. This ninth album would mark O'Brien's first production credit with Pearl Jam since 1998's Yield. The band allowed O'Brien greater latitude in determining the sound of Backspacer. [...] "At this point, I think we're willing to let somebody cut the songs up a little bit," [...] says lead vocalist Eddie Vedder. [...] "In the past, Brendan would say, 'It's a great song, but I think <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> in a different key', and we'd say no. But now that we've heard Bruce [...] has listened to his suggestions, I think we will too." [...] Bassist Jeff Ament said, [...] "He brings a brutally honest approach to what he thinks is working and what isn't, and it really moves things along... We don't get weighted down with ideas that maybe aren't even that good. He's one of the few people outside of the band that we trust with our music, and we're really, really looking forward to making this record." ...|$|E
500|$|Eastwood {{is known}} for his {{economical}} film shoots; his regular camera operator, Steve Campanelli, indicated the rapid pace at which Eastwood films—and his intimate, near-wordless direction—also featured during Changelings shoot. Eastwood limited rehearsals and takes to garner more authentic performances. Jolie said, [...] "You've got to get your stuff together and get ready because he doesn't linger... He expects people to come prepared and get on with their work." [...] Campanelli sometimes had to tell Jolie what Eastwood wanted from a scene, as Eastwood talked too softly. To provide verisimilitude to certain scenes, Eastwood sometimes asked Jolie to play them quietly, as if just for him. At the same time he would ask his camera operator to start filming discreetly, without Jolie's seeing it. Malkovich noted Eastwood's direction as [...] "redefining economical", saying Eastwood was quiet and did not use the phrases [...] "action" [...] and [...] "cut". He said, [...] "Some —like Clint Eastwood or Woody Allen—don't really like to be tortured by a million questions. They hire you, and they figure you know what to do, and <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> <b>it...</b> And that's fine by me." [...] Ryan also noted the calmness of the set, observing that her experiences working with director Sidney Lumet on 100Centre Street and Before the Devil Knows You're Dead were useful due to his sharing Eastwood's preference for filming a small number of takes. Donovan said Eastwood seldom gave him direction other than to [...] "go ahead", and that Eastwood did not even comment on his decision to play Jones with a slight Irish accent: [...] "Actors are insecure and they want praise, but he's not there to praise you or make you feel better... All he's there to do is tell the story, and he hired actors to tell their story." [...] Gaffer Ross Dunkerley said he often had to work on a scene without having seen a rehearsal: [...] "Chances are we'll talk about it for a minute or two, and then we're executing it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, the Sports Authority of Thailand banned competitions. It {{has been}} speculated that the Muay Thai {{industry}} played {{a factor in the}} Sports Authority of Thailand (SAT)'s final decision, as MMA could potentially take away business from Muay Thai, from fighters to profit. SAT Deputy Governor Sakol Wannapong has said [...] "Organizing a MMA event here would hurt the image of Muay Thai, {{if you want to do}} this kind of business, <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> in another country. Organizing MMA here could mislead the public into believing that Muay Thai is brutal." ...|$|E

2500|$|Second, Searle {{believes}} we can rationally {{do things}} that don't result from our own desires. It is widely believed that one cannot derive an [...] "ought" [...] from an [...] "is", i.e. that facts about how the world is can never {{tell you what you}} should do ('Hume's Law'). By contrast, in so far as a fact is understood as relating to an institution (marriage, promises, commitments, etc.), which is to be understood as a system of constitutive rules, then what one should do can be understood as following from the institutional fact of what one has done; institutional fact, then, can be understood as opposed to the [...] "brute facts" [...] related to Hume's Law. For example, Searle believes the fact that you promised to do something means <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> because by making the promise you are participating in the constitutive rules that arrange the system of promise making itself, and therefore understand a [...] "shouldness" [...] as implicit in the mere factual action of promising. Furthermore, he believes that this provides a desire-independent reason for an action—if you order a drink at a bar, you should pay for it even if you have no desire to. This argument, which he first made in his paper, [...] "How to Derive 'Ought' from 'Is'" [...] (1964), remains highly controversial, but even three decades later Searle continued to defend his view that [...] "..the traditional metaphysical distinction between fact and value cannot be captured by the linguistic distinction between 'evaluative' and 'descriptive' because all such speech act notions are already normative." ...|$|E

6000|$|Some don't run. They {{pretend to}} smile {{when they see}} their hat borne along on the breeze, and glance at the {{laughing}} faces around in a way implying, [...] "Yes, it is funny, and I enjoy the joke, although the hat is mine." [...] Nobody believes you, but if this does you good, <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> You don't attempt to catch your hat as it were on the wing. You walk after it, smiling, as if you liked the joke the more you think of it, and confident that the hat will come to rest presently. You are {{not the sort of}} man to make a fuss over a hat. You won't give the hat the satisfaction of thinking that it can annoy you. Strange though it may seem, there are idiots who will join you in pursuit of the hat. One will hook it with a stick, and almost get it, only not quite. Another will manage to hit it hard with an umbrella. A third will get his foot into it or on it. This does not improve the hat, but it shows that there is {{a good deal of the}} milk of human kindness flowing in the street as well as water, and is perhaps pleasant to think of afterwards. Several times you almost have the hat in your possession. It lies motionless, just where it has dropped after coming in contact with a hansom. Were you to make a sudden rush at it you could have it, but we have agreed that you are not that sort of man. You walk forward, stoop, and----. One reads how the explorer thinks he has shot a buffalo dead, and advances to put his foot proudly on the carcass, how the buffalo then rises, and how the explorer then rises also. I have never seen an explorer running after his hat (though I should like to), but your experience is similar to his with the buffalo. As your hand approaches the hat, the latter turns over like a giant refreshed, and waddles out of your reach. Once more your hand is within an inch of it, when it makes off again. There are ringing cheers from the audience on the pavement, some of them meant for the hat, and the others as an encouragement to you. Before you get your hat you have begun to realize what deer-stalking is, and how important a factor is the wind.|$|E

6000|$|When I {{once asked}} {{his opinion of}} a poetical {{composition}} on which I had expended no little pains, he read it attentively, and then remarked 'Unless one's thought pack more neatly in verse than in prose, it is wiser to refrain. Commonplace gains nothing by being translated into rhyme, for it is something which no hocus-pocus can transubstantiate with the real presence of living thought. You entitle your piece, [...] "My Mother's Grave," [...] and expend four pages of useful paper in detailing your emotions there. But, my dear sir, watering does not {{improve the quality of}} ink, even though <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> with tears. To publish a sorrow to Tom, Dick, and Harry is in some sort to advertise its unreality, for I have observed in my intercourse with the afflicted that the deepest grief instinctively hides its face with its hands and is silent. If your piece were printed, I have no doubt it would be popular, for people like to fancy that they feel much better than the trouble of feeling. I would put all poets on oath whether they have striven to say everything they possibly could think of, or to leave out all they could not help saying. In your own case, my worthy young friend, what you have written is merely a deliberate exercise, the gymnastic of sentiment. For your excellent maternal relative is still alive, and is to take tea with me this evening, D.V. Beware of simulated feeling; it is hypocrisy's first cousin; it is especially dangerous to a preacher; for he who says one day, [...] "Go to, let me seem to be pathetic," [...] may be nearer than he thinks to saying, [...] "Go to, let me seem to be virtuous, or earnest, or under sorrow for sin." [...] Depend upon it, Sappho loved her verses more sincerely than she did Phaon, and Petrarch his sonnets better than Laura, who was indeed but his poetical stalking-horse. After you shall have once heard that muffled rattle of clods on the coffin-lid of an irreparable loss, you will grow acquainted with a pathos that will make all elegies hateful. When I was of your age, I also for a time mistook my desire to write verses for an authentic call of my nature in that direction. But one day as I was going forth for a walk, with my head full of an [...] "Elegy on the Death of Flirtilla," [...] and vainly groping after a rhyme for lily that should not be silly or chilly, I saw my eldest boy Homer busy over the rain-water hogshead, in that childish experiment at parthenogenesis, the changing a horse-hair into a water-snake. All immersion of six weeks showed no change in the obstinate filament. Here was a stroke of unintended sarcasm. Had I not been doing in my study precisely what my boy was doing out of doors? Had my thoughts any more chance of coming to life by being submerged in rhyme than his hair by soaking in water? I burned my elegy and took a course of Edwards on the Will. People do not make poetry; it is made out of them by a process for which I do not find myself fitted. Nevertheless, the writing of verses is a good rhetorical exercitation, as teaching us what to shun most carefully in prose. For prose bewitched is like window-glass with bubbles in it, distorting what it should show with pellucid veracity.' ...|$|E
6000|$|SCENE II.--A Room in SIR TUNBELLY CLUMSY'S House. Enter MISS HOYDEN, NURSE, and TOM FASHION. Fash. This quick {{despatch}} of the chaplain's I take so kindly {{it shall}} give him claim to my favour {{as long as}} I live, I assure you. Miss Hoyd. And to mine too, I promise you. Nurse. I most humbly thank your honours; and may your children swarm about you like bees about a honeycomb! Miss Hoyd. Ecod, with all my heart--the more the merrier, I say--ha, nurse? Enter LORY. Lory. One word with you, for Heaven's sake. [Taking TOM FASHION hastily aside.] Fash. What the devil's the matter? Lory. Sir, your fortune's ruined {{if you are not}} married. Yonder's your brother arrived, with two coaches and six horses, twenty footmen, and a coat worth fourscore pounds--so judge what will become of your lady's heart. Fash. Is he in the house yet? Lory. No, they are capitulating with him at the gate. Sir Tunbelly luckily takes him for an impostor; and I have told him that we have heard of this plot before. Fash. That's right.--[Turning to MISS HOYDEN.] My dear, here's a troublesome business my man tells me of, but don't be frightened; we shall be too hard for the rogue. Here's an impudent fellow at the gate (not knowing I was come hither incognito) has taken my name upon him, in hopes to run away with you. Miss Hoyd. Oh, the brazen-faced varlet! it's well we are married, or maybe we might never have been so. Fash. [Aside.] Egad, like enough.--[Aloud.] Pr'ythee, nurse, run to Sir Tunbelly, and stop him from going to the gate before I speak to him. Nurse. An't please your honour, my lady and I had better, lock ourselves up till the danger be over. Fash. Do so, if you please. Miss Hoyd. Not so fast; I won't be locked up any more, now I'm married. Fash. Yes, pray, my dear, do, till we have seized this rascal. Miss Hoyd. Nay, if you'll pray me, I'll do anything. [Exit with NURSE.] Fash. Hark you, sirrah, things are better than you imagine. The wedding's over. Lory. The devil it is, sir! [Capers about.] Fash. Not a word--all's safe--but Sir Tunbelly don't know it, nor must not yet. So I am resolved to brazen the brunt of the business out, and have the pleasure of turning the impostor upon his lordship, which I believe may easily be done. Enter SIR TUNBELLY CLUMSY. Did you ever hear, sir, of so impudent an undertaking? Sir Tun. Never, by the mass; but we'll tickle him, I'll warrant you. Fash. They tell me, sir, he has a great many people with him, disguised like servants. Sir Tun. Ay, ay, rogues enow, but we have mastered them. We only fired a few shot over their heads, and the regiment scoured in an instant.--Here, Tummus, bring in your prisoner. Fash. If you please, Sir Tunbelly, it will be best for me not to confront this fellow yet, till you have heard how far his impudence will carry him. Sir Tun. Egad, your lordship is an ingenious person. Your lordship, then, will please to step aside. Lory. [Aside.] 'Fore heavens, I applaud my master's modesty! [Exit with TOM FASHION.] Enter SERVANTS, with LORD FOPPINGTON disarmed. Sir Tun. Come, bring him along, bring him along. Lord Fop. What the plague do you mean, gentlemen? is it fair time, that you are all drunk before supper? Sir Tun. Drunk, sirrah! here's an impudent rogue for you now. Drunk or sober, bully, I'm a justice o' the peace, and {{know how to deal with}} strollers. Lord Fop. Strollers! Sir Tun. Ay, strollers. Come, give an account of yourself. What's your name? where do you live? do you pay scot and lot? Come, are you a freeholder or a copyholder? Lord Fop. And why dost thou ask me so many impertinent questions? Sir Tun. Because I'll make you answer 'em, before I have done with you, you rascal, you! Lord Fop. Before Gad, all the answer I can make to them is, that you are a very extraordinary old fellow, stap my vitals. Sir Tun. Nay, if thou art joking deputy-lieutenants, we know how to deal with you.--Here, draw a warrant for him immediately. Lord Fop. A warrant! What the devil is't thou wouldst be at, old gentleman? Sir Tun. I would be at you, sirrah, (if my hands were not tied as a magistrate,) and with these two double fists beat your teeth down your throat, you dog, you! [Driving him.] Lord Fop. And why wouldst thou spoil my face at that rate? Sir Tun. For your design to rob me of my daughter, villain. Lord Fop. Rob thee of thy daughter! Now do I begin to believe I am in bed and asleep, and that all this is but a dream. Pr'ythee, old father, wilt thou give me leave to ask thee one question? Sir Tun. I can't tell whether I will or not, till I know what it is. Lord Fop. Why, then, it is, whether thou didst not write to my Lord Foppington, to come down and marry thy daughter? Sir Tun. Yes, marry, did I, and my Lord Foppington is come down, and shall marry my daughter before she's a day older. Lord Fop. Now give me thy hand, old dad; I thought we should understand one another at last. Sir Tun. The fellow's mad!--Here, bind him hand and foot. [They bind him.] Lord Fop. Nay, pr'ythee, knight, leave fooling; thy jest begins to grow dull. Sir Tun. Bind him, I say--he's mad: bread and water, a dark room, and a whip, may bring him to his senses again. Lord Fop. Pr'ythee, Sir Tunbelly, why should you take such an aversion to the freedom of my address as to suffer the rascals thus to skewer down my arms like a rabbit?--[Aside.] Egad, if I don't awake, by all that I can see, this is like to prove one of the most impertinent dreams that ever I dreamt in my life. Re-enter MISS HOYDEN and NURSE. Miss Hoyd. [Going up to LORD FOPPINGTON.] Is this he that would have run--Fough, how he stinks of sweets!--Pray, father, let him be dragged through the horse-pond. Lord Fop. This must be my wife, by her natural inclination to her husband. [Aside.] Miss Hoyd. Pray, father, what do you intend to do with him--hang him? Sir Tun. That, at least, child. Nurse. Ay, and it's e'en too good for him too. Lord Fop. Madame la gouvernante, I presume: hitherto this appears to me to be one of the most extraordinary families that ever man of quality matched into. [Aside.] Sir Tun. What's become of my lord, daughter? Miss Hoyd. He's just coming, sir. Lord Fop. My lord! what does he mean by that, now? [Aside.] Re-enter TOM FASHION and LORY. Stap my vitals, Tam, now the dream's out! [Runs.] Fash. Is this the fellow, sir, that designed to trick me of your daughter? Sir Tun. This is he, my lord. How do you like him? Is not he a pretty fellow to get a fortune? Fash. I find by his dress he thought your daughter might be taken with a beau. Miss Hoyd. Oh, gemini! is this a beau? let me see him again. [Surveys him.] Ha! I find a beau is no such ugly thing, neither. Fash. [Aside.] Egad, she'll be in love with him presently --I'll e'en have him sent away to jail.--[To LORD FOPPINGTON.] Sir, though your undertaking shows you a person of no extraordinary modesty, I suppose you ha'n't confidence enough to expect much favour from me? Lord Fop. Strike me dumb, Tam, thou art a very impudent fellow. Nurse. Look, if the varlet has not the effrontery to call his lordship plain Thomas! Lord Fop. My Lord Foppington, shall I beg one word with your lordship? Nurse. Ho, ho! it's my lord with him now! See how afflictions will humble folks. Miss Hoyd. Pray, my lord--[To FASHION]--don't let him whisper too close, lest he bite your ear off. Lord Fop. I am not altogether so hungry as your ladyship is pleased to imagine.--[Aside to TOM FASHION.] Look you, Tam, I am sensible I have not been so kind to you as I ought, but I hope you'll forgive what's past, and accept of the five thousand pounds I offer--thou mayst live in extreme splendour with it, stap my vitals! Fash. It's a much easier matter to prevent a disease than to cure it. A quarter of that sum would have secured your mistress, twice as much cannot redeem her. [Aside to LORD FOPPINGTON.] Sir Tun. Well, what says he? Fash. Only the rascal offered me a bribe to let him go. Sir Tun. Ay, he shall go, with a plague to him!--lead on, constable. Enter SERVANT. Ser. Sir, here is Muster Loveless, and Muster Colonel Townly, and some ladies to wait on you. [To TOM FASHION.] Lory. [Aside to TOM FASHION.] So, sir, what will you do now? Fash. [Aside to LORY.] Be quiet; they are in the plot.--[Aloud.] Only a few friends, Sir Tunbelly, whom I wish to introduce to you. Lord Fop. Thou art the most impudent fellow, Tam, that ever nature yet brought into the world.--Sir Tunbelly, strike me speechless, but these are my friends and acquaintance, and my guests, and they will soon inform thee whether I am the true Lord Foppington or not. Enter LOVELESS, COLONEL TOWNLY, AMANDA, and BERINTHIA.--LORD FOPPINGTON accosts them as they pass, but none answer him. Fash. So, gentlemen, this is friendly; I rejoice to see you. Col. Town. My lord, we are fortunate to be the witnesses of your lordship's happiness. Love. But your lordship will do us the honour to introduce us to Sir Tunbelly Clumsy? Aman. And us to your lady. Lord Fop. Gad take me, but they are all in a story! [Aside.] Sir Tun. Gentlemen, you do me much honour; my Lord Foppington's friends will ever be welcome to me and mine. Fash. My love, let me introduce you to these ladies. Miss Hoyd. By goles, they look so fine and so stiff, I am almost ashamed to come nigh 'em. Aman. A most engaging lady indeed! Miss Hoyd. Thank ye, ma'am. Ber. And I doubt not will soon distinguish herself in the beau monde. Miss Hoyd. Where is that? Fash. You'll soon learn, my dear. Love. But Lord Foppington-- Lord Fop. Sir! Love. Sir! I was not addressing myself to you, sir!--Pray who is this gentleman? He seems rather in a singular predicament-- Col. Town. For so well-dressed a person, a little oddly circumstanced, indeed. Sir Tun. Ha! ha! ha!--So, these are your friends and your guests, ha, my adventurer? Lord Fop. I am struck dumb with their impudence, and cannot positively say whether I shall ever speak again or not. Sir Tun. Why, sir, this modest gentleman wanted to pass himself upon me as Lord Foppington, and carry off my daughter. Love. A likely plot to succeed, truly, ha! ha! Lord Fop. As Gad shall judge me, Loveless, I did not expect this from thee. Come, pr'ythee confess the joke; tell Sir Tunbelly that I am the real Lord Foppington, who yesterday made love to thy wife; was honoured by her with a slap on the face, and afterwards pinked through the body by thee. Sir Tun. A likely story, truly, that a peer would behave thus. Love. A pretty fellow, indeed, that would scandalize the character he wants to assume; but what will you do with him, Sir Tunbelly? Sir Tun. Commit him, certainly, unless the bride and bridegroom choose to pardon him. Lord Fop. Bride and bridegroom! For Gad's sake, Sir Tunbelly, 'tis tarture to me to hear you call 'em so. Miss Hoyd. Why, you ugly thing, what would you have him call us--dog and cat? Lord Fop. By no means, miss; for that sounds ten times more like man and wife than t'other. Sir Tun. A precious rogue this to come a-wooing! Re-enter SERVANT. Ser. There are some gentlefolks below to wait upon Lord Foppington. [Exit.] Col. Town. 'Sdeath, Tom, what will you do now? [Aside to TOM FASHION.] Lord Fop. Now, Sir Tunbelly, here are witnesses who I believe are not corrupted. Sir Tun. Peace, fellow!--Would your lordship choose to have your guests shown here, or shall they wait till we come to 'em? Fash. I believe, Sir Tunbelly, we had better not have these visitors here yet.--[Aside.] Egad, all must out. Love. Confess, confess; we'll stand by you. [Aside to TOM FASHION.] Lord Fop. Nay, Sir Tunbelly, I insist on your calling evidence on both sides--and if I do not prove that fellow an impostor-- Fash. Brother, I will save you the trouble, by now confessing that I am not what I have passed myself for.--Sir Tunbelly, I am a gentleman, and I flatter myself a man of character; but'tis with great pride I assure you I am not Lord Foppington. Sir Tun. Ouns!--what's this?--an impostor?--a cheat?--fire and faggots, sir, if you are not Lord Foppington, who the devil are you? Fash. Sir, the best of my condition is, I am your son-in-law; and the worst of it is, I am brother to that noble peer. Lord Fop. Impudent to the last, Gad dem me! Sir Tun. My son-in-law! not yet, I hope. Fash. Pardon me, sir; thanks to the goodness of your chaplain, and the kind offices of this gentlewoman. Lory. 'Tis true indeed, sir; I gave your daughter away, and Mrs. Nurse, here, was clerk. Sir Tun. Knock that rascal down!--But speak, Jezebel, how's this? Nurse. Alas! your honour, forgive me; I have been overreached in this business as well as you. Your worship knows, if the wedding-dinner had been ready, you would have given her away with your own hands. Sir Tun. But how durst you do this without acquainting me? Nurse. Alas! if your worship had seen how the poor thing begged and prayed, and clung and twined about me like ivy round an old wall, you would say, I who had nursed it, and reared it, must have had a heart like stone to refuse it. Sir Tun. Ouns! I shall go mad! Unloose my lord there, you scoundrels! Lord Fop. Why, when these gentlemen are at leisure, I should be glad to congratulate you on your son-in-law, with a little more freedom of address. Miss Hoyd. Egad, though, I don't see which is to be my husband after all. Love. Come, come, Sir Tunbelly, a man of your understanding must perceive that an affair of this kind is not to be mended by anger and reproaches. Col. Town. Take my word for it, Sir Tunbelly, you are only tricked into a son-in-law you may be proud of: my friend Tom Fashion is as honest a fellow as ever breathed. Love. That he is, depend on't; and will hunt or drink with you most affectionately: be generous, old boy, and forgive them-- Sir Tun. Never! the hussy!--when I had set my heart on getting her a title. Lord Fop. Now, Sir Tunbelly, that I am untrussed--give me leave to thank thee for the very extraordinary reception I have met with in thy damned, execrable mansion; and at the same time to assure you, that of all the bumpkins and blockheads I have had the misfortune to meek with, thou art the most obstinate and egregious, strike me ugly! Sir Tun. What's this! I believe you are both rogues alike. Lord Fop. No, Sir Tunbelly, thou wilt find to thy unspeakable mortification, that I am the real Lord Foppington, who was to have disgraced myself by an alliance with a clod; and that thou hast matched thy girl to a beggarly younger brother of mine, whose title deeds might be contained in thy tobacco-box. Sir Tun. Puppy! puppy!--I might prevent their being beggars, if I chose it; for I could give 'em as good a rent-roll as your lordship. Lord Fop. Ay, old fellow, but you will not do that--for that would be acting like a Christian, and thou art a barbarian, stap my vitals. Sir Tun. Udzookers! now six such words more, and I'll forgive them directly. Love. 'Slife, Sir Tunbelly, <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> and bless yourself--Ladies, what say you? Aman. Good Sir Tunbelly, you must consent. Ber. Come, you have been young yourself, Sir Tunbelly. Sir Tun. Well then, if I must, I must; but turn--turn that sneering lord out, however, and let me be revenged on somebody. But first look whether I am a barbarian or not; there, children, I join your hands; and when I'm in a better humour, I'll give you my blessing. Love. Nobly done, Sir Tunbelly! and we shall see you dance at a grandson's christening yet. Miss Hoyd. By goles, though, I don't understand this! What! an't I to be a lady after all? only plain Mrs.--What's my husband's name, nurse? Nurse. Squire Fashion. Miss Hoyd. Squire, is he?--Well, that's better than nothing. Lord Fop. [Aside.] Now I will put on a philosophic air, and show these people, that it is not possible to put a man of my quality out of countenance.--[Aloud.] Dear Tam, since things are fallen out, pr'ythee give me leave to wish thee joy; I do it de bon coeur, strike me dumb! You have married into a family of great politeness and uncommon elegance of manners, and your bride appears to be a lady beautiful in person, modest in her deportment, refined in her sentiments, and of nice morality, split my windpipe! Miss Hoyd. By goles, husband, break his bones if he calls me names! Fash. Your lordship may keep up your spirits with your grimace, if you please; I shall support mine, by Sir Tunbelly's favour, with this lady and three thousand pounds a year. Lord Fop. Well, adieu, Tam!--Ladies, I kiss your, hands!-- Sir Tunbelly, I shall now quit this thy den; but while I retain the use of my arms, I shall ever remember thou art a demned horrid savage; Ged demn me! [Exit.] Sir Tun. By the mass, 'tis well he's gone--for I should ha' been provoked, by-and-by, to ha' dun un a mischief. Well, if this is a lord, I think Hoyden has luck on her side, in troth. Col. Town. She has, indeed, Sir Tunbelly.--But I hear the fiddles; his lordship, I know, has provided 'em. Love. Oh, a dance and a bottle, Sir Tunbelly, by all means! Sir Tun. I had forgot the company below; well--what--we must be merry, then, ha? and dance and drink, ha? Well, 'fore George, you shan't say I do these things by halves. Son-in-law there looks like a hearty rogue, so we'll have a night on't: and which of these ladies will be the old man's partner, ha?--Ecod, I don't know how I came to be in so good a humour. Ber. Well, Sir Tunbelly, my friend and I both will endeavour to keep you so: you have done a generous action, and are entitled to our attention. If you should be at a loss to divert your new guests, we will assist you to relate to them the plot of your daughter's marriage, and his lordship's deserved mortification; a subject which perhaps may afford no bad evening's entertainment. Sir Tun. Ecod, with all my heart; though I am a main bungler at a long story. Ber. Never fear; we will assist you, if the tale is judged worth being repeated; but of this you may be assured, that while the intention is evidently to please, British auditors will ever be indulgent to the errors of the performance.
