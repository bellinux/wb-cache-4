2500|$|The game {{begins in}} a {{ceremonial}} chamber, with Ray and Thomas pointing their guns at one another, as Marisa stands alongside Thomas. Ray says [...] "I loved you, and <b>you</b> <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> me. Both of you. You betrayed me." [...] From nearby, William laments to himself how {{the family has}} been destroyed by lust for a woman and greed for gold. There is a cut to black, a gunshot, and Marisa screams.|$|E
6000|$|... "Can {{you deny}} it?" [...] I cried. [...] "Can you deny {{that you love}} me? If you can--why, then, <b>you</b> <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> me three nights ago at Toulouse!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... {Margaret}, a {{few minutes}} ago, when you told me there was nothing between you and this man, <b>you</b> <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> me--lied to me as only a wicked woman can lie.|$|E
60|$|<b>You</b> have <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> {{me about}} Knox, and I {{have no reason}} to believe you will not lie to me about this matter.|$|R
6000|$|... "And yet <b>you</b> have <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> me! Is a lie no injury;--and such a lie! Emily, {{why did you}} lie to me? You {{will tell}} me to-morrow that <b>you</b> never <b>lied,</b> and never owned that you had lied." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'We {{are all in}} {{the hands}} of the priests, who are the mouth of God,' he {{answered}} coldly. 'Besides, I hold that <b>you</b> have <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You'll {{tell him}} you's sole {{me to pay}} yo' gamblin' debts en dat <b>you</b> <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> me en was a villain, en dat I 'quires you to git dat money en buy me back ag'in." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I must apologise {{for this}} second intrusion, Mr. Ledsam," [...] he said cuttingly. [...] "I {{think you will}} admit that the {{circumstances}} warrant it. Am I to understand that <b>you</b> <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> me this morning?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{sounds very}} picturesque," [...] Maggie said coldly, [...] "but I {{do not follow}} your allegory. What I {{want to know is}} why <b>you</b> <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> me, why you sent me to that house to meet Prince Shan?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And if <b>you</b> have <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> me," [...] said Achmet Zek, [...] "I {{will kill}} you at any time. What return, other than your life, do you expect for your services?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>you</b> have <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> me, {{if this is}} but a {{shift to}} win your miserable life, rest assured, Master Ashburn, that you have but put off the day for a very little while." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{shall not}} kill you--now," [...] said the ape-man. [...] "First I shall go and learn if <b>you</b> have <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> me {{and if you}} have your death shall be the more terrible. Do you know how Major Schneider died?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should like}} to know why <b>you</b> <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> Mr. Carvel about my convictions, Mr. Allen," [...] I said. [...] "I am not of the King's party now, and never shall be. And you know this better than another." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You--you snake!" [...] I cried, in {{uncontrollable}} anger. [...] "You well knew Dorothy's spirit, {{which she}} has not got from you, and <b>you</b> <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> her. Yes, lied, I say. To force her to marry Chartersea you made her believe that your precious honour was in danger. And <b>you</b> <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> me last night, and sent me in the dark to fight {{two of the most}} treacherous villains in England. You wish they had killed me. The plot was between you and his Grace. You, who have not a cat's courage, commit an indiscretion! You never made one in your life, Tell me," [...] I cried, shaking him until his teeth smote together, [...] "was it not put up between you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your law [...] . or your lies? What am I to believe? I came--I ran {{to defend}} you when I saw the strange men. <b>You</b> <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> me with your lips, with your eyes. You crooked heart! [...] . Ah!" [...] she added, after an abrupt pause. [...] "She is the first! Am I {{then to be}} a slave?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What?" [...] screams out Deuceace,--"what? Why {{that you}} are a beggar, for marrying without your mother's consent--that <b>you</b> basely <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> me, in order to bring about this match--{{that you are}} a swindler, in {{conspiracy}} with that old fiend yonder and the she-devil his wife?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Have I {{no cause}} {{to look at}} you sternly, Adrea?" [...] he demanded,--"you who deceived us! <b>you</b> who <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> us, to win our aid! Where would you have been now {{had it not been for}} me? At Cruta! Would to God my hand had {{withered}} before it had set you free!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'If <b>you</b> have <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> me,' said Mr Carker, 'in anything, {{never come}} {{in my way}} again. If not, you may let me find you waiting for me somewhere near your mother's house this afternoon. I shall leave this at five o'clock, and ride there on horseback. Now, give me the address.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And yet {{you told}} me that {{there was no one else}} when I spoke to you of Lord Lovel? <b>You</b> <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> me?" [...] The girl sat confounded, astounded, without power of utterance. She had {{travelled}} from York to London, inside one of those awful vehicles of which we used to be so proud when we talked of our stage coaches. She was thoroughly weary and worn out. She had not breakfasted that morning, and was sick and ill at ease, not only in heart, but in body also. Of course it was so. Her mother knew that it was so. But this was no time for fond compassion. It would be better, far better that she should die than that she should not be compelled to abandon this grovelling abasement. [...] "Then <b>you</b> <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> me?" [...] repeated the Countess still standing over her.|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{of course}} <b>you</b> <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> him. All right, Diana; {{perhaps there is}} nothing to be gained from your alliance, and I'll let you out of the deal from this moment. The battle's mine, after all, and I'll fight it alone. But--I need more money. You ought to be willing to pay, for so far the {{developments}} are all in your favor." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] went on his father, {{standing}} before him, his tall frame swaying backwards and forwards with excitement; [...] "no, do not curse her, she, like your other poor dupe, is an honest woman; on yourself be the damnation, you living fraud, you outcast from all honour, who have brought shame and reproach upon our honest name, on you be it; may every curse attend you, and may remorse torture you. Listen: <b>you</b> <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> me, <b>you</b> <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> your wife, trebly did you {{lie to the}} unfortunate girl you have deceived; but, if you will not speak it, for once hear the truth, and remember {{that you have to}} deal with one so relentless, that fools, mistaking justice for oppression, call him 'devil.' I, 'Devil Caresfoot,' tell you that I will disinherit you of every stick, stone, and stiver that the law allows me, and start you in the enjoyment of the rest with my bitterest curse. This I will do now whilst I am alive; when I am dead, by Heaven, I will haunt you if I can." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Would {{that this}} {{were all that}} I have to say. But alas! it is not. You have {{committed}} the great sacrilege against the Sun, my father, of which I warned you, having robbed him of his bride, and, my brother, <b>you</b> have <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> me, who told me but yesterday that you had put all thought of her from your mind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have even}} deceived you. If {{it had not}} been for that word 'esteem.' These are not the words for me. I would have <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> Haven't I <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> <b>you?</b> Weren't you going to trust your {{property}} on board this very trip?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "People {{talked to}} you in Paris about us," [...] she continued, [...] "about Anna the virtuous and Annabel the rake. You were accused of having been seen with the latter. You denied it, remembering that I had called myself Anna. You went even to our rooms and saw my sister. Anna <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> I <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> I was Annabel the rake, 'Alcide' of the music halls. My name is Annabel, not Anna. Do you understand?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As you will, wife, as you will," [...] Jan answered, {{somewhat}} sharply, [...] "but I {{doubt if}} we shall {{get rid of}} our danger thus, for with you I think that the tide of our lives has turned, and that it sets towards sorrow. Ay," [...] he went on, sitting up in the bed, [...] "and I will tell you when it turned; it turned upon the day that <b>you</b> <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> the Englishmen." ...|$|E
60|$|LADY CHILTERN. Don’t {{come near}} me. Don’t touch me. I {{feel as if}} you had soiled me for ever. Oh! what a mask you have been wearing all these years! A horrible painted mask! You sold {{yourself}} for money. Oh! a common thief were better. You put yourself up to sale to the highest bidder! You were bought in the market. <b>You</b> <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> the whole world. And yet you will not lie to me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps," [...] {{he said in}} a low voice, and {{a manner}} quite free from any {{personal}} annoyance,--"perhaps it's just as well that <b>you</b> <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> her as you did. You can say now that the pick-pocket was arrested the other day, and you got your money back." [...] Mr. Oakhurst quietly slipped four twenty-dollar gold-pieces into the broad hand of the bewildered Mr. Decker. [...] "Say that--or any thing you like--but the truth. Promise me you won't say that." ...|$|E
50|$|The band parted with Independiente, in mid-2004. Their {{second album}} <b>You</b> Are Being <b>Lied</b> <b>to</b> was {{released}} in June 2005 on the indie label Captains of Industry. The album was recorded and produced by the band themselves on a tight budget.|$|R

50|$|<b>You</b> Are Being <b>Lied</b> <b>to</b> is Kinesis' {{second and}} follow up album to Handshakes For Bullets. It {{is also the}} final release made by the band just before they split up in 2005. Released 29 September 2003 by Captains of Industry and financed by the band.|$|R
6000|$|... 3. These things proving ineffectual, God {{takes hold}} of his axe again, sends death to a wife, to a child, to his cattle, 'Your young men have I slain,--and taken away your horses' (Amos 4:9,10). I will blast him, cross him, {{disappoint}} him, and cast him down, and will set myself against him in all that he putteth his hand unto. At this the poor barren professor cries out again, Lord, I have sinned; spare me once more, I beseech thee. O take not away the desire of mine eyes; spare my children, bless me in my labours, and I will mend and be better. No, saith God, <b>you</b> <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> me last time, I will trust you in this no longer; and withal he tumbleth the wife, the child, the estate into a grave. And then returns to his place, till this professor more unfeignedly acknowledgeth his offence (Hosea 5:14,15).|$|E
6000|$|The men in {{that far}} country were liars, every one. Their mere howdy-do was a lie, because they didn't care how you did, except they were undertakers. To the {{ordinary}} inquirer you lied in return; for you made no conscientious diagnostic of your case, but answered at random, and usually missed it considerably. <b>You</b> <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> the undertaker, and said your health was failing--a wholly commendable lie, since it cost you nothing and pleased the other man. If a stranger called and interrupted you, you said with your hearty tongue, [...] "I'm {{glad to see}} you," [...] and said with your heartier soul, [...] "I wish you were with the cannibals and it was dinner-time." [...] When he went, you said regretfully, [...] "Must you go?" [...] and followed it with a [...] "Call again;" [...] but you did no harm, for you did not deceive anybody nor inflict any hurt, whereas the truth would have made you both unhappy.|$|E

'You {{have broken}} your faith; <b>you</b> have <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> me; <b>you</b> have {{forgotten}} your wrongs and mine; {{but you have}} not yet forgotten my parting words when I left you last night! I told you {{that she should be}} slain, and now that you have refused to avenge me, I will make good my words by killing her with my own hand! If you would defend her, you must murder me.
