5|$|A {{significant}} amount of new star formation and star destruction data {{is expected to be}} recorded from continued observation of Sakurai's Object, as well as be used as reference data in the future research of similar stars.

Sakurai's Object and V605 Aquilae have been observed experiencing born-again behavior for only 10 <b>years,</b> <b>while</b> FG Sagittae has undergone such behavior for 120 years. It is hypothesized that this is due to Sakurai's Object and V605 Aquilae evolving to the asymptotic giant branch of stars for the first time, while FG Sagittae is undergoing the process a second time.|$|E
