In this next interview, Lazarus Laiser spoke to one woman who has done her research ? and it shows. With other women in her village, Rose Machange set up Umangu Enterprises in Tanzania, to sell dried vegetables to local businesses. Its success has been inspiring, and now the group is thinking of expanding the business. But first they had to find credit and, as Rose explains, they needed to form a group and invest some money of their own in the enterprise. IN:	?The chairman of our village? OUT:	?help dry a bigger amount. ? DUR?N:	 4 ? 41 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: That was Lazarus Laiser speaking to Rose Machange of Umangu Enterprises in Tanzania. Small businesses can become bigger. But knowing your market ? your customers and your buyers ? is the first step. The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Machange	The chairman of our village one day called a village meeting and {{said there is no}} women group in our village. So we called our friends and we agreed to start such a group. Laiser	Where did you get the finances because always it is difficult to get the finances? Machange	After setting our goals we talked and discussed how to start and then we decided to contribute the money in a business of selling the clothes for women house-to-house, and we got a profit and started a small garden and our profit grew. Laiser	Did you get any benefits? Machange	Yes we got, it is still going on and we are still going on with it, it is growing. We got a lot of benefits {{and we were able to}} build good houses; that is modern houses. This is our office we built from the profits we got and we are able to pay our school fees for all our children. Laiser	I am still standing outside the Umangu Enterprises office with the chairperson Mrs Rose, and I am interested to know more about this process of drying vegetables and fruits that you say that you are dealing with here in the office and I can see some dried things here on the table, Rose. Machange	As you can see, these are the vegetables taken from the gardens and we have already dried them. Laiser	The vegetables are already dried and it has its greenish colour and looks like maybe somehow hard but this is ready just to eat? Machange	Yes you can even taste. Laiser	Is it sweet? Machange	Yes it is very sweet. Laiser	If I taste? Machange	Yes, it is very nice. Laiser	Um, ok it is very sweet yes, it is very sweet and you added salt in? Machange	Yes, as you can see, as you have already tasted what we do is we use a simple method of drying them to allow the duration of storage so that it will take long. Laiser	Which type of greens are you dealing with? Machange	We as Umangu Enterprise we dry all the greens found in our area. We have that knowledge on how to dry them but we have two types of green which are the soft and hard. Laiser	Right, the green vegetables are varied into two types, they are hard and soft. Ok, how do you do now the drying process? Machange	We bring the vegetables from the garden, we wash them, we wash them well in clean water, that is, and put on a clean place. We take a piece of a clean white cotton cloth and put on the greens and tighten it. After that we boil water and add salt on it. We then put the green tightened with the piece of cloth into hot water for about one minute if it?s so soft and two minutes if it?s too hard. Laiser	Why do you add salt in this water? Machange	We usually use salt because it helps to protect the greenish not to be lost because if it?s lost the vitamins are lost therefore we dry vegetables with greenish if you eat you get all the vitamins. After boiling for one or two minutes we put in a dry place - a bed - and it stays there for one day or some hours. It depends on how hot the sun is and it is not advisable to dry them too much because it will loose its vitamins. After drying them well, we put on the nylon pack and keep safe. We use them in our homes and also we sell them to other people. Laiser	And <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> are coming to buy? Machange	Yes, very many. Laiser	Now also the mangoes I can see also that bucket you say that you have some mangoes inside that are in the process also for drying. This is another fruit that you are dealing with here. You said also you are dealing with tomatoes. These are the mangoes, so?. Machange	Yes, as you can see these are the mangoes from our own trees found in our farms. As you can see we have cut them into small pieces ready for drying. After the six weeks, we will add various spices to get a mango pickle ready to sell and for home use. Laiser	Which is the starting point of drying? Machange	We take the mango from the tree. Mind you they should be the mangoes which are ripe but did not drop down by themselves. We wash them and put on a dry place to drop water. After that we wash them with clean water and cut them into small pieces and weigh together with adding salt and put into bucket. Laiser	Then after, how do you use these dried mangoes? Machange	For our mango women group we sell them and get a good income. People usually come and buy from us. We can also use them by making mango pickles and we sell more money. Laiser	Do you satisfy the market that is available? You said that you sell the product to other people. Machange	No not at all. We have a big market and currently we did not manage to satisfy the market. We are only a few and we do not have many buckets to produce more but it is encouraging, the market is available. Laiser	Which strategies now do you have to satisfy the market? Machange	We are planning to sell and buy bigger buckets to help dry a bigger amount.

40|$|Preventing {{transmission}} {{to humans}} Cue: There {{are many different}} strains of avian flu, which cause death and sickness in poultry around the world every year. However, the H 5 N 1 strain, which is causing such concern to poultry producers and veterinary authorities, is different from others, {{because it is the}} first strain we know of that can be passed from birds to humans. So far over one hundred people have died from H 5 N 1, mostly in South East Asia. However, scientists fear that if more human cases occur, the virus could develop into a new form which could be spread from one person to another. This could lead to a serious epidemic, causing thousands or even millions of human deaths. Preventing transmission of the virus from birds to humans is therefore very important. And {{there are a number of}} simple measures that farmers and poultry keepers can take to reduce their risk of contracting the disease. Dr Linus Chimangha, an inspector from the Cameroon ministry responsible for agriculture, spoke to Martha Chindong about how spread of the disease from poultry to humans can be prevented and what symptoms people should look for if they think they have been exposed to birds that may have avian flu. Martha began by asking which types of people are most at risk of contracting the disease. IN:		?First the farmers, the poultry farmers ?? OUT:		??for confirmation of the diagnosis. ? DUR?N:	 5 ? 01 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Dr Linus Chimangha with some advice to people if they think they could be at risk of having contracted avian flu. The interview comes from a radio resource pack on avian flu produced by CTA. Transcript Chimangha	First the farmers, the poultry farmers and their families, who have direct contact with the birds on a daily basis. Then you have veterinarians and other technicians who visit these poultry establishments for no matter what type of intervention. Then you have even journalists, journalists like you sitting here. When an outbreak occurs you will visit it and want to have in depth information so you can better inform the population. In cases where there are outbreaks <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> are in charge of clearing the poultry houses, people who will do slaughtering of the poultry and disposing of them. Groups of people who will go in to disinfect the poultry houses. You have even researchers and laboratory technicians who will go in to collect blood samples for examination. So these are the classes of people who are very highly susceptible and more vulnerable to the infection by, not only avian flu, but equally all other epidemics which may occur in livestock or poultry. Chindong	In the case of avian flu, what of small scale farmers who stay in their houses with fowls? Chimangha	These are very susceptible groups of people, and it is not advisable for people who keep chickens to be living with them in the same type of establishment. Chindong	So for these people at greater risk, how can they protect themselves? Chimangha	Implementing some biosecurity measures, hygienic practices, whenever they touch poultry they should wash their hands well and their clothing, they should wear protective clothing, gloves and a mask, particularly in places where an outbreak has been reported. And they should have things like dips, footbaths at the entrance of the poultry house, so that they dip in their feet when they are going in and when they are going out. And then ensuring that all poultry products which they consume ? in fact this one is even a general measure ? should be well cooked. As you know the virus does not withstand cooking at boiling of 60 degrees Celsius for five minutes, and at 100 degrees for just one minute the virus is destroyed. So these are some of the things they should do. And equally, in case of any suspected cases, say a sick bird, they should report it immediately to the veterinary authorities for measures to be taken. Chindong	When a farmer comes in contact with the dead bird, is he at risk too? Chimangha	Sure, certainly he is at risk, and that is why he is not supposed to pick up that dead bird with his empty hands. He should wear gloves, or if no gloves are available he should use something like a plastic bag, and then pick up the dead bird. And you either dispose of it, or where the disease is suspected you report it to the veterinary authorities. Such birds should really be burned or buried very deeply. Chindong	When human beings contract the disease, what are the symptoms? Chimangha	When human beings get this disease, you know it is a disease of the respiratory system. But the pronounced symptoms start coming after some few days of incubation, say about two days to one week, at times it can even stay up to two weeks. And then you see the symptoms coming up, which just present as the common symptoms of flu or cold, with a temperature of up to 38 at times even 39 degrees Celsius. You have a painful or sore throat. Then muscle and joint pains, respiratory signs like cough, then running nose, coupled with headache, loss of appetite and occasional nausea and vomiting. Then such respiratory signs may become more severe and they could give rise to bronchitis, sinusitis, and other bacterial pneumonias. Then specifically in elderly people, or people with other infections which compromise their immune system, like HIV/AIDS, such symptoms may become even more severe and lead to death. But generally death from this disease is rare, except if it is aggravated by other underlying medical conditions. Chindong	So if we notice such a case, what is the immediate thing a farmer should do at home, even at home or anywhere, what is the immediate thing that can be done? Chimangha	When avian flu is suspected in any severe cold conditions which are not immediately responding to common treatment, you should rush immediately to the hospital and meet the medical authorities. These are the ones who are supposed to do more in depth diagnosis and then see what treatment they can undertake. But again the case should be reported to the veterinary authorities, so that they come in with their own investigation for confirmation of the diagnosis. End of track.

There were times when we were there to play for Australia and some blokes were off at a meeting about something else.

40|$|Urban {{farming and}} food Cue: Urban {{agriculture}} - the {{growing of crops}} and keeping of livestock in cities ? is increasingly popular {{in many parts of}} Africa, both as a means for generating income, and as a way for urban households to supplement their diets. However, one challenge facing urban farming is how to access water for irrigation. While some families may harvest rainwater from their rooftops, many urban farmers depend on less clean sources of water, including polluted rivers and drainage channels. This creates a danger to health, both for the farmers themselves, who risk catching infections from the water, and for consumers who buy their produce. So how can consumers protect themselves, {{and what can be done}} to ensure that produce grown in urban areas is as safe as possible? To find out, Eric Kadenge went to a restaurant owned by food safety expert Mr Ham Onsando. Apart from his restaurant business, Mr Onsando also works for Global Food Safety, an organisation which helps restaurants and food processors to improve their safety standards. He began by explaining the risk to food safety from the use of contaminated irrigation water. IN:		?There is a very interesting situation ? OUT:		? Thank you very much. ? DUR?N		 4 ? 35 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Mr Ham Onsando, of the organisation Global Food Safety, talking to Eric Kadenge. Transcript Onsando	There is a very interesting situation that we find ourselves, especially in Nairobi and the urban setting. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> got your domestic shambas (gardens), <b>you</b> <b>have</b> got <b>people</b> <b>who</b> grow food by riversides, by drainage systems. A lot of these obviously have an element of risk. More so when we know that a lot of the effluent that leaves our houses finds its way into these rivers, into the drainage system on the way out. If you go into the industrial area, a lot of organizations there are pumping chemicals into these same scenarios that then end up possibly contaminating the produce that we get from these farmers. Kadenge	It is actually quite scary especially during the days when it?s very rainy because you will find that the sewage water and all the other rain water gets mixed up. Onsando	I have got a classic example of one. On my way home I always drive by him, he?s got a little sukuma wiki (kales) patch, and I know he gets his water from the drainage that runs by the little patch. There are issues in terms of what contaminants he is actually transferring on to the produce. The produce looks good, but <b>you</b> <b>have</b> then got to be aware of ? because of where it is grown - there is a risk and because of that risk there are ways <b>you</b> <b>have</b> got to address it. So <b>you</b> <b>have</b> got to cook it thoroughly, make sure you wash it thoroughly etc. So the steps to actually secure your own safety in terms of the consumer are easy to achieve. It is just washing thoroughly and then cooking thoroughly. That would normally get rid of the kind of contaminants we are dealing with in the urban area. But in that backdrop as well, we have got a mushrooming up of more informal eating areas as well. Nowadays you walk down the street and you can buy fruit salad ready to eat. You don?t know where the fruits <b>have</b> been washed, <b>you</b> don?t know whether the guy washed his hands before peeling the fruit, before chopping; we know so little about the food we are eating. Kadenge	And how do you think then that some of these risks could be minimized or prevented especially from the farmer?s perspective? Onsando	One of the biggest things we need is legislation. Legislation in the sense that farmers who draw water from rivers or from bore-holes have a right to know what kind of pollutants could have gotten into that water. Now legislation on industries, big industry players, we need legislation that will control what they can spew out into rivers. We need legislation that controls what pesticides farmers can use and in what quantities. Kadenge	Let?s talk about the consumer. How should I as a consumer get to know about these risks? Onsando	Education on food risks when you are eating is very key. But from my perspective any time you eat in a restaurant ? even if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> the slightest discomfort, four hours, three hours after eating, complain. Go back to that restaurant and complain. Say they caused <b>you</b> to <b>have</b> a sleepless night, they caused <b>you</b> to <b>have</b> diarrhea ? complain. Consumers have to be aware of their rights and I think the media has a role to play in that and maybe we should be running more consumer awareness programs and inviting people to tell the consumer what is his right as a consumer. Kadenge	And lastly then, what word would <b>you</b> <b>have</b> in regards to the contamination of water that is used for irrigation in urban settings like Nairobi? Onsando	Other than touting a lot for legislation, I would also like to ask the industry players, the guys who are actually spewing out a lot of waste water into our ecosystem. They should actually take it upon themselves and they should ask themselves ?Is what I am doing good for the environment?? Because ultimately, they might think that they will drive home in their big cars and go into their posh neighbourhoods and it will not affect them. But ultimately whatever we do to the environment affects us. Nature has got a nasty way of coming right round back and hitting at us. Kadenge	Okay thank you very much for taking your time to talk to us. Is this my cup of tea? Onsando	Yes, enjoy your cup of tea, it is very safe - purified water! Kadenge	Thank you very much. End of track.

40|$|Drying and {{preserving}} meat Cue: When it?s available, fresh meat is a delicacy. But in some areas, dried meat is a delicacy too. In Cameroon, Martha Chindong {{went to the}} Ministry of Secondary Education to ask Chofor Ndimofor for some tips on drying meat. Smoking and drying meat has been done for centuries ? it?s {{one of the oldest}} kinds of preservation. But, there are health concerns related to drying meat. As usual, preparation and washing {{needs to be done in}} a clean area, and boiled water should be used. And different kinds of meat will require different drying times and storage periods. But why dry meat at all? Martha Chindong finds out. IN:	?Well basically there are two reasons? OUT:	?when meat will be scarce. ? DUR?N:	 4 ? 53 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: That was Martha Chindong speaking to Chofor Ndimofor of the Ministry of Secondary Education in Cameroon. It is always best to seek advice about how long it is safe to dry your meat or fish. If it decays, it can cause serious illness. The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Ndimofor	Well basically there are two reasons. The first reason is that when meat is dried it is properly preserved and secondly it is a way of improving the taste of the meat. People consider dry meat as a delicacy. Chindong	So which type of meat or fish are also best to dry? Ndimofor	Well, as you see presently, I am in the process of drying a rabbit. Chindong	What of fish? Ndimofor	Yes fish, all kinds of fish can be dried, especially fish that is not too oily and which does not have a lot of water. We are thinking of fish like mackerel. Chindong	So how do you just get started?Just describe one, how you get started with at least one? Maybe this here rabbit which I see in front of you? Ndimofor	All right, in order to dry a rabbit, the first thing is you select a healthy rabbit, one that is not lean, one that is in good health. You kill it, you skin it and then you open it up. You actually open it up in such a way that it is spread out and you can use pieces of stick to get it well spread out so that it remains in shape. And then you salt it with brine; that is you put some salt in water and steep it in it for a while. You hang it out or you expose it in the sun to drip a little then you put it over the fire as you see me doing. Chindong	So is that the same process you do for meat and fish? Ndimofor	No, for meat <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to choose meat that does not have too much fat because too much fat will not enhance the drying process. Then the meat should be lean, it should not have too much fat and the best way is for you to slice it into strands. When you slice it into strands you treat it with brine in the same way. Sometimes in order to give added flavour you might like to spice it with other ingredients, maybe curry, maybe ginger then you hang it out to drip and then you put the strands either over a grill or you hang them from a hook or a rope over a fire, a smoke fire. Chindong	Smoke fire like what we are seeing? Ndimofor	Yes, what we are seeing, we are using the grill now. There is fire under the grill, not burning into flames but only producing the smoke and heat that go up to dehydrate the meat and after some three or four hours the meat is well dehydrated and now you only leave it for sometime to get properly dried. Chindong	Is it within the reach of smallscale farmers living in the villages? Ndimofor	Yes, I think it is within the reach of smallscale farmers. I say it is within their reach because the materials are not expensive. Chindong	So <b>you</b> <b>have</b> constructed it with what type of material? Ndimofor	Burnt bricks and then he will need to have a good piece of grill which cannot be rusted. The best one within the reach of the people in the rural areas is the traditional everyday fire with which they prepare their meals. What they do is they prepare their meat or whatever animal they have to smoke or dry and just hang it over the fireplace. Chindong	So, Mr Chofor Ndimofor, this meat that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> dried can keep for how long? Ndimofor	Ah, it depends. If you really want the meat to keep for long it should be properly dehydrated. The only things is that you should avoid during that time, you should avoid it coming into contact with moisture. Chindong	When it comes in contact with moisture can it be contaminated? Ndimofor	Oh yes, when it comes in contact with moisture you know especially in rural areas there is this tendency that it can fall out of the containers and when it falls out of the containers onto the ground it can pick up dirt and germs and all kinds of things. When dry meat gets into contact with moisture maggots tend to infest it and it will reduce the quality and also the look of it and nobody would really like to eat it. Chindong	What advice do <b>you</b> <b>have</b> for farmers? What message do <b>you</b> <b>have</b> for <b>people</b> <b>who</b> are interested in drying meat? Ndimofor	Yes what I have to say is, you know in the first place why do we dry meat? We dry meat because there are certain seasons when <b>you</b> <b>have</b> abundance of meat. Use that opportunity to dry the meat and preserve it for when meat will be scarce. End of trackHow to get the most from your mea...|$|R

40|$|Introduction The Hausa {{people of}} Northern Nigeria {{have long been}} known for their {{production}} of voluminous robes known as babban riga (Heathcote 1972; Kriger 1988; Lamb and Holmes 1980; Perani and Wolff 1999; Picton and Mack 1979), which are handembroidered {{in a range of}} embroidery stitches, materials (mainly cotton and silk), styles, and designs (e. g., fig. 1). Until recently, the embroidery of these robes was primarily done by men (Heathcote 1972, 1979). However, women have taken up this work (fig. 2) in the past twenty years, as men have turned to machine embroidery and other occupations, though women generally sell their robes through male relations or dealers. This paper considers the situation of Hausa women who hand-embroider in one of the major centers for hand-embroidery in Northern Nigeria, the old, walled section of the town of Zaria, known as Zaria City or Birnin Zazzau. Robes and kaftans, both handembroidered and machine-embroidered that are produced in Zaria City, are available in local shops and are marketed throughout Nigeria (fig. 3 a-e). In other words, the production and marketing of these garments is big business and is the major occupation of many men and some women in Zaria City. For these Zaria City women, hand-embroidery (dinkin hannu) is an important source of income and more accessible without a large cash outlay than other occupations open to them as one Zaria City woman explained: Before I was selling soup ingredients but now I don’t have money to buy them. But hand-embroidery, you can do it for people [without needing capital] and get money. And especially for us women who stay at home, it is good for us (Interview: QA- 3, Zaria City, July 2002). This woman is referring to the practice of seclusion by married Muslim Hausa women (Callaway 1987; Schildkrout 1983), whose respectability (mutunci) rests on their staying at home during the day, while going out under cover of darkness—to visit and pay condolence calls as well as go to Islamic schools at night. Hand-embroidery of babban riga is a particularly suitable occupation for these women as they can work in their homes. However, as will be seen, this situation puts women at a disadvantage when it comes to marketing, particularly if they are producing robes on their own and not doing piece work for someone else. In such cases, they are at a double disadvantage. First, they are subject to the vagaries of the market, as one woman noted: Before, if you take a babban riga to the tailor to sew it, before he is finished he will find someone to buy it…But now {{there is no such thing}} unless you are lucky and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>people</b> like those <b>who</b> <b>have</b> titles [i. e., are rich], who will buy them from you, then you’ll get a profit (Interview: FEAP-RI- 4, Zaria City, July 2002). Second, they face the problem of the honesty of those who are selling robes for them. For example, one woman had to take a man to court to recover some of the money from a robe he had taken to sell for her. The issue of marketing will be discussed in a later section of this paper. Despite these problems, hand-embroidery has become a principal occupation for Zaria City women, who have used capital provided by government programs to buy the necessary materials (imported cotton brocade, locally made cotton muslin backing, thread) and labor to produce babban riga robes. This paper examines two such government micro-credit programs, the Federal Economic Advancement Programme (FEAP) and the Nigerian Agricultural Co-op and Rural Development Bank Ltd. (NACRDB), and their consequences for women embroiderers as well as one nongovernmental program, Queen Amina Embroidery, started by the author to market handembroidered items for sale in the U. S. Before discussing these programs for the craftproduction as sources of income for these women—which also reflect some of the larger problems associated with artisan enterprises more generally—the specifics of these three programs are discussed in the following section...|$|R
