500|$|AllMusic's Heather Phares {{described}} the album as more consistent than most remix collections {{and noted that}} it functions well as a record in its own right. Priya Elan of NME explained that [...] "the results are pretty much all quality" [...] {{and that some of}} the tracks are better than the original songs on Silent Alarm. Rockfeedback's Thomas Hannan stated, [...] "It's all very clever, but the most intelligent thing about it is that it makes <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> original in a completely altered way." [...] Pitchfork Media's Nitsuh Adebe was impressed with the album and indicated that it is [...] "surprisingly good, and surprisingly often".|$|E
500|$|Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly named [...] "A Short Story About Love" [...] {{the fifteenth}} best {{episode of the}} series, {{explaining}} [...] "The timeline reboot of season 4 frustrated some fans, but the premise yielded several truly cool capture-the-imagination ideas that made for provocative drama, most notably Fringes most romantic hour... The fact that the episode also featured one of the show's seediest creepazoids — a serial killer who murdered men for their pheromones so {{he could make a}} perfume that allowed him to seduce their grieving female significant others — was a bonus. Icky, but bonus." [...] Cory Barker of TV.com named the episode the 17th best of the series, saying, [...] "Fringe has never been afraid of coming up with intimate, emotionally based—and sometimes very hokey—resolutions for its grand plots. Whatever <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> choices the writers made in Season 4, it's hard to deny the emotional wallop this episode delivered." ...|$|E

Sober, Gaga was still at her outlandish peak." [...] David Drake of Complex found the ArtRave to be quite a production but like all things Gaga does he found it to be a [...] "blend of the high-brow and the trashy, depth and superficiality, the thoughtful and the impulsive, and lots of other contradictions that make <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> nature of philosophy and life and art." [...] He gave a positive review of the main show, praising the sound system, the performances of [...] "Gypsy" [...] and [...] "Do What U Want", and deduced that: [...] "Perhaps this kind of ambition is music's future, at least for a certain breed of artist. Although Artpop doesn't sound retro per se, Lady Gaga's project as a whole does feel like a reaction to the idea that as far as the music goes, there's nothing new under the sun." ...|$|E

[...] Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun called [...] "Unusual You" [...] "a surprisingly subtle and effective moment" [...] and speculated {{that it was}} [...] "surely a future single."

[...] Nekesa Mumbi Moody of the Associated Press commented that Spears's most personal and emotional moments of Circus are in the slower tracks, most notably in [...] "Unusual You". Moody continued, [...] "Though she didn't write the song, it's hard not to wince in empathy when <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> string of users who have filtered {{in and out of}} her life." [...] Pete Paphides of The Times said [...] "Unusual You" [...] would [...] "find a home with anyone whose love of melancholy Europop is fatal enough to take in Limahl's 'Never Ending Story.'" [...] In 2015, Gregory Hicks of MTV named [...] "Unusual You" [...] Spears's best song that was not released as a single. On December 18, 2008, [...] "Unusual You" [...] managed to peak at number eighty on the US Billboard Pop 100 due to strong digital sales.|$|E
500|$|With the {{announcement}} by Islam4UK that it planned {{to hold a}} protest march through Wootton Bassett (known for the military funeral repatriations of dead British soldiers returning {{from the war in}} Afghanistan), Choudary said [...] "You may see one or two coffins being returned to the UK every other day, but when <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> people of Afghanistan its a huge number [...] in comparison ... I intend to write a letter to the parents of British soldiers telling them the reality of what they died for." [...] Choudary's open letter was published on 3 January 2010. [...] It explained his reasons for proposing the march, endorsed his religious beliefs, and claimed that UK politicians had been lying about the war. [...] Choudary wrote that the proposed march was to [...] "engage the British public's minds on the real reasons why their soldiers are returning home in body bags and the real cost of the war." [...] In an interview with Sky News, he stated that the location was chosen to effect a level of media attention which [...] "it would not have gained anywhere else". [...] The proposal was condemned by the British Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, who said that to offend the families of dead or wounded troops would be [...] "completely inappropriate". [...] The Minhaj-ul-Quran International UK centre in Forest Gate also condemned the proposal, as did the Muslim Council of Britain, which stated that it [...] "condemns the call by the fringe extremist group Islam4UK for their proposed march in Wootton Bassett."

On the other hand, Montalembert was certainly in bed the other day with vexation, because 'nobody could do anything with Louis Napoleon--he was obstinate;' 'nous nous en lavons les mains,' and that fact gives me hope that not too much indulgence is intended to the Church. There's to be a ball at the Tuileries with 'court dresses,' which is 'un peu fort' for a republic.

I was assured that he believes the prophecy firmly, 'being in all things too superstitious' and fatalistical.|$|E
