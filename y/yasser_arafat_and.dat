5|$|Aflaq {{moved to}} Baghdad {{following}} his reelection to the Secretary Generalship in February 1968. He stayed there until 1970, when Black September happened, he criticised the Ba'ath leadership of doing {{too little to}} help the Palestine Liberation Organisation during the conflict. During the conflict, Aflaq lobbied extensively for <b>Yasser</b> <b>Arafat</b> <b>and</b> the PLO. Aflaq wanted Iraqi intervention; al-Bakr, however, refused to get Iraq involved in such a conflict. Because of this, Aflaq returned to Lebanon in self-imposed exile. The government of Hafez al-Assad, the President of Syria, condemned Aflaq to death in absentia in 1971.|$|E
5|$|Like Nasser, Gaddafi favoured the Palestinian leader <b>Yasser</b> <b>Arafat</b> <b>and</b> his group, Fatah, {{over more}} militant and Marxist Palestinian groups. As the years progressed however, Gaddafi's {{relationship}} with Arafat became strained, with Gaddafi considering him too moderate {{and calling for}} more violent action. Instead he supported militias like the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – General Command, the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, As-Sa'iqa, the Palestinian Popular Struggle Front, and the Abu Nidal Organization. He funded the Black September Organization whose members perpetrated the 1972 Munich massacre of Israeli athletes in West Germany, and had the killed militants' bodies flown to Libya for a hero's funeral.|$|E

5|$|Talal Hassan Abu Rahma studied {{business}} {{administration in the}} United States, and began working as a freelance cameraman for France2 in Gaza in 1988. At {{the time of the}} shooting, he ran his own press office, the National News Center, contributed to CNN through the Al-Wataneya Press Office, and was {{a board member of the}} Palestinian Journalists' Association. His coverage of the al-Durrah shooting brought him several journalism awards, including the Rory Peck Award in 2001. According to France2 correspondent Gérard Grizbec, Abu Rahma had never been a member of a Palestinian political group, had twice been arrested by Palestinian police for filming images that did not meet the approval of <b>Yasser</b> <b>Arafat,</b> <b>and</b> had never been accused of security breaches by Israel.|$|E

50|$|The group {{emerged from}} a split in the Palestinian Liberation Front in Lebanon in 1983 as Col. Abu Musa revolted against <b>Yasser</b> <b>Arafat's</b> {{leadership}} <b>and</b> the old PLF was divided into three (one group led by Abu Abbas supported <b>Yasser</b> <b>Arafat,</b> one group led by Abd ul-Fattah Ghanim supported Abu Musa and the third group led by Talat Yaqub sought to remain neutral in this conflict). The PLF (Abu Nidal Ashqar wing) emerged from the latter group.|$|R
25|$|In the mid-1950s, Abbas became heavily {{involved}} in underground Palestinian politics, joining a number of exiled Palestinians in Qatar, where he was Director of Personnel in the emirate's Civil Service. While there in 1961, he was recruited {{to become a member}} of Fatah, founded by <b>Yasser</b> <b>Arafat</b> <b>and</b> 5 other Palestinians in Kuwait in the late 1950s. At the time, Arafat was establishing the groundwork of Fatah by enlisting wealthy Palestinians in Qatar, Kuwait, and other Gulf States.|$|E
25|$|Eventually, {{the lack}} of {{progress}} {{of the peace process}} led to new negotiations, which produced the Wye River Memorandum, which detailed the steps to be taken by the Israeli government and Palestinian Authority to implement the earlier Interim Agreement of 1995. It was signed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and PLO chairman <b>Yasser</b> <b>Arafat,</b> <b>and</b> on November 17, 1998, Israel's 120 member parliament, the Knesset, approved the Wye River Memorandum by a vote of 75–19.|$|E
25|$|For {{his role}} in the {{creation}} of the Oslo Accords, Rabin was awarded the 1994 Nobel Peace Prize, along with <b>Yasser</b> <b>Arafat</b> <b>and</b> Shimon Peres. The Accords greatly divided Israeli society, with some seeing Rabin as a hero for advancing the cause of peace and some seeing him as a traitor for giving away land they viewed as rightfully belonging to Israel. Many Israelis on the right wing often blame him for Jewish deaths in terror attacks, attributing them to the Oslo agreements.|$|E

He also covered the invasion of Somalia by U.S. forces, and the first Gulf War.|$|R
25|$|While <b>Yasser</b> <b>Arafat</b> <b>and</b> the PLO had {{not officially}} taken a {{side in the}} conflict, several PLO members were {{fighting}} with the LNM. Assad attempted to steer Arafat and the PLO away from Lebanon, threatening him with a cutoff of Syrian aid. The two sides were unable to reach an agreement. When Frangieh stepped down in 1976, Syria pressured Lebanese members of parliament to elect Elias Sarkis president. One-third of the Lebanese members of parliament (primarily supporters of Raymond Edde) boycotted the election to protest American and Syrian interference.|$|E
25|$|After {{graduating from}} the AUB, he took up the {{profession}} of being a teacher in Beirut's al-Maqassed School, but the administration disliked the discussions he frequently held with the students {{on the subject of}} the Palestinian cause, and eventually removed him from his post. Prior to his emigration to Kuwait in 1956 for another teaching job, al-Hout obtained Lebanese citizenship, despite reservations by his father. It was during his brief stay in Kuwait that he met <b>Yasser</b> <b>Arafat</b> <b>and</b> other Palestinian activists. Two years later, after correspondence with Salim al-Lawzi, he returned to Lebanon where he was given the post of chief editor at the Lebanese magazine al-Hawadeth run by al-Lawzi. He soon gained a reputation of being a Nasserist—a supporter of Egyptian president at the time, Gamal Abdel Nasser—journalist.|$|E
25|$|He rose to {{national}} prominence for {{his pursuit of}} civil rights of Muslim-Americans and raising awareness of the Palestinian plight. Al-Arian criticized the peace process led by Palestinian Authority president <b>Yasser</b> <b>Arafat</b> <b>and</b> advocated support for the Palestinian uprisings against Israeli occupation during the 1980s and early 1990s. On October 20, 1988, Al-Arian established the Islamic Concern Project, which included a committee devoted to raising charity for Palestine. In 1990–91, his continued involvement in promoting dialogue between the West and Middle East {{led to the creation}} of World and Islam Studies Enterprise (WISE), which served as a think tank that promoted public policy initiatives. WISE and University of South Florida formally agreed to cooperate on March 11, 1992. WISE published journals, supported graduate student education, and held seminars between American and Middle Eastern scholars.|$|E

25|$|But his Lebanese pan-Arabist Sunni Muslim Prime Minister Rashid Karami {{supported}} Nasser in 1956 and 1958. Lebanese Muslims {{pushed the}} government to join the newly created United Arab Republic, a country formed out of the unification of Syria and Egypt, {{while the majority of}} Lebanese and especially the Maronites wanted to keep Lebanon as an independent nation with its own independent parliament. President Camille feared the toppling of his government and asked for U.S. intervention. At the time the United States was engaged in the Cold War. Chamoun asked for assistance proclaiming that Communists were going to overthrow his government. Chamoun was responding not only to the revolt of former political bosses, but also to the fact that both Egypt and Syria had taken the opportunity to deploy proxies into the Lebanese conflict. Thus the Arab National Movement (ANM), led by George Habash and later to become the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and a faction of the PLO, were deployed to Lebanon by Nasser. The ANM were a clandestine militia implicated in attempted coups against both the Jordanian monarchy and the Iraqi president throughout the 1950s at Nasser's bidding. The founding members of Fatah, including <b>Yasser</b> <b>Arafat</b> <b>and</b> Khalil Wazir also flew to Lebanon to use the insurrection as a means by which a war could be fomented toward Israel. They participated in the fighting by directing armed forces against the government security in the city of Tripoli according to Yezid Sayigh's work.|$|E
500|$|While in Algeria, Abu Ali Iyad was {{recruited}} into the Palestinian nationalist paramilitary organization Fatah by {{the leader of}} its armed wing Khalil al-Wazir.

Abu Ali Iyad, along with al-Wazir, <b>Yasser</b> <b>Arafat,</b> <b>and</b> three others in the Syrian camp, formed the organization's [...] "emergency" [...] field command in Damascus in 1965.|$|E
500|$|In 1990, Moran first won {{election}} to the United States House of Representatives, defeating five-term Republican incumbent Stan Parris.

[...] Moran angrily responded by saying that Parris was [...] "a deceitful, fatuous jerk", and that he wanted [...] "to break his nose". Moran's well-financed campaign also focused on Parris' opposition to abortion. Moran upset Parris, winning by 7.1 percent. He was sworn into office in January 1991.|$|E
