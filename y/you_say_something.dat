I think on the whole people in the other American Republics understand and support us, but it isn't good politics to say so at {{election time}}. We are a sort of punching bag during elections.

500|$|He {{was very}} careful not to present his own views of the meaning of his films and leave them open to interpretation. He {{explained}} in a 1960 interview with Robert Emmett Ginna: [...] "One of the things I always find extremely difficult, when a picture's finished, is when a writer or a film reviewer asks, 'Now, {{what is it that you}} were trying to say in that picture?' And without being thought too presumptuous for using this analogy, I like to remember what T. S. Eliot said to someone who had asked him—I believe it was The Waste Land—what he meant by the poem. He replied, 'I meant what I said'. If I could have said it any differently, I would have". Kubrick likened the understanding of his films to popular music, in that whatever the background or intellect of the individual, a Beatles record, for instance, can both be appreciated by the Alabama truck driver and the young Cambridge intellectual in the way that his films can because their [...] "emotions and subconscious are far more similar than their intellects". He believed that the subconscious emotional reaction evoked by audiences was far more powerful in the film medium than in any other traditional verbal form, and was one of the reasons why he often relied on long periods in his films without dialogue, placing emphasis on images and sound. In a Time magazine interview in 1975, Kubrick further stated: [...] "The essence of a dramatic form is to let an idea come over people without it being plainly stated. When <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> directly, it is simply not as potent as it is when you allow people to discover it for themselves." [...] He also said [...] "Realism is probably the best way to dramatize argument and ideas. Fantasy may deal best with themes which lie primarily in the unconscious".|$|E
2500|$|After {{recording}} The Midnight Organ Fight, {{the current}} quartet line-up was completed {{with the addition}} of guitarist/keyboardist Andy Monaghan of Piano Bar Fight (who have previously played as support to Frightened Rabbit). In an interview, Scott mentions that he [...] "met him on New Year's Eve, in Glasgow, in a bar. I was really hammered and I was like 'why don't you come and play some shows with us man?' and he was like 'Yeah!'. The next day, I got a text like 'Do you remember… did <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> about this or is it my imagination?'".|$|E

Asked in 2007 how she feels when criticized from within the movement, she said: [...] "Somebody has to push the envelope. If <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> that someone already agrees with, then what's the point, and so we make some more conservative animal protection organizations uncomfortable; they don't want to be associated with us because it will be embarrassing for them, and I understand that. Our own members write to us sometimes and say, 'Oh why did you do this? I don't want anyone to know I'm a PETA member.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Brando made {{a similar}} comment on Larry King Live in April 1996, saying [...] "Hollywood is run by Jews; it is owned by Jews, {{and they should have}} a greater {{sensitivity}} about the issue of—of people who are suffering. Because they've exploited—we have seen the—we have seen the nigger and greaseball, we've seen the chink, we've seen the slit-eyed dangerous Jap, we have seen the wily Filipino, we've seen everything, but we never saw the kike. Because they knew perfectly well, that that is where you draw the wagons around." [...] Larry King, who is Jewish, replied, [...] "When you say—when <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> like that, you are playing right in, though, to anti-Semitic people who say the Jews are—" [...] Brando interrupted: [...] "No, no, because I will be the first one who will appraise the Jews honestly and say 'Thank God for the Jews'." ...|$|E
2500|$|When CNN {{presenter}} Jeff Greenfield {{was asked}} why Chomsky was never on his show, {{he claimed that}} Chomsky might [...] "be {{one of the leading}} intellectuals who can't talk on television. [...] If you got a 22-minute show, and a guy takes five minutes to warm up, [...] he's out". Greenfield described this need to [...] "say things between two commercials" [...] as the media's requirement for [...] "concision". Chomsky has elaborated on this, saying that [...] "the beauty of [...] is that you can only repeat conventional thoughts. If you repeat conventional thoughts, you require zero evidence, like saying Osama Bin Laden is a bad guy, no evidence is required. However, if <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> that is true, although not a conventional truth, like the United States attacked South Vietnam, people are going to rightfully want evidence, {{and a whole lot of}} it, as they should. The format of the shows do not allow this type of evidence which is one of the reasons concision is critical." [...] He's continued that if the media were better propagandists they would invite dissidents to speak more often because the time restraint would stop them from properly explaining their radical views and they [...] "would sound like they were from Neptune." [...] For this reason, Chomsky rejects many offers to appear on TV, preferring the written medium.|$|E

2500|$|All groups talk a {{particular}} language. Thus begins the fifth essay of the book. It {{is the natural}} way of things that <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> one way which the lawyer says another way. Same with doctors. A doctor who can only talk like a text book may leave you in serious doubt as to your state of health, Sykes says. Same with sailors, same with all other craftsmen. Then he comments from Shakespeare, for whom language was a vast instrument at his command, {{to what he calls}} the irrational little vocabulary of the movements of fashion: newspaper fashion, pub fashion, cinema fashion, popular song fashion. But, for this English author, the great, the most desired fashion has always been that of “the best society,” of “the fashionable”, of “the chic”, which is kept by snobbism. After further analyzing the use of U and non-U habits and its progress, reflecting either by stress or reaction the mood of any time. Pursuing his argument he introduces Topivity — T-manners and T-customs etc., meaning the likely social conventions of a remote future in which the peerage has survived by infiltrating the trade union movement on a large scale. Abandoning [...] "U", he ends the article with [...] "T" [...] stating that one big T-point remains constant: nobody wants a really poor peer: it is very un-T not to be rich. However, T and non-T do not seem to have become popular though.|$|E
