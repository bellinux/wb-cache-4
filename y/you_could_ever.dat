Berry Gordy and Smokey Robinson gave eulogies, while Queen Latifah read [...] "We Had Him", a poem written for the occasion by Maya Angelou. The Reverend Al Sharpton received a standing ovation with cheers when he told Jackson's children: [...] "Wasn't nothing strange about your daddy. It was strange what your daddy had to deal with. But he dealt with it anyway." [...] Jackson's 11-year-old daughter Paris Katherine, speaking publicly for the first time, wept as she told the crowd: [...] "Ever since I was born, Daddy {{has been the best}} father <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> imagine ... I just wanted to say I love him ... so much." [...] Reverend Lucious Smith provided a closing prayer.|$|E
500|$|The Maharishi had {{arranged}} a simple lifestyle for his guests, which included stone cottages and vegetarian meals taken outdoors in a communal setting. The days {{were devoted to}} meditating and attending lectures by the Maharishi, who spoke from a flower-bedecked platform in an auditorium. The Maharishi also gave private lessons to the individual Beatles, nominally due to their late arrival. The tranquil environment provided by the Maharishi – complete with meditation, relaxation, {{and away from the}} media throng – helped the band to relax. Harrison told Saltzman, [...] "Like, we're The Beatles after all, aren't we? We have all the money <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> dream of. We have all the fame <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> wish for. But, it isn't love. It isn't health. It isn't peace inside, is it?" [...] Lennon was respectful of the Maharishi but not in awe of him. At their first meeting Donovan remembers that the Maharishi was [...] "amiable but non-talkative", and during an awkward silence Lennon walked across the room and patted the Maharishi on the head, saying, [...] "There's a good little guru" [...] while the room erupted in laughter. Maharishi cancelled the formal lectures for a time and told students to meditate for as long as possible. One student meditated for 42 straight hours, and Pattie Boyd once meditated for seven hours. Boyd's sister Jenny meditated for long periods as well, but also suffered from dysentery (misdiagnosed as tonsilitis); she said Lennon also felt unwell, suffering from jet lag and insomnia. The lengthy meditation sessions left many students moody and oversensitive. Like the 60 other students at the ashram, the Beatles adopted native dress and the ashram had a tailor on the premises to make clothes for the students. The Beatles shopped in Rishikesh and the women bought saris for themselves and to be made into shirts and jackets for the men, which affected Western fashion when the Beatles wore them after going home.|$|E
500|$|The Fifth Element polarised critics on release. Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times {{described}} {{the film as}} an [...] "elaborate, even campy sci-fi extravaganza, which is nearly as hard to follow as last year's [...]" [...] He concluded that The Fifth Element was [...] "a lot warmer, more fun and boasts {{some of the most}} sophisticated, witty production and costume design <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> hope to see." [...] On film review show At the Movies, both Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel gave the film a [...] "thumbs up"; in his own review for the Chicago Sun-Times, Ebert gave the film 3 stars out of 4, calling it [...] "One of the great goofy movies", and concluding, [...] "I would not have missed seeing this film, and I recommend it for its richness of imagery. But at 127 minutes, which seems a reasonable length, it plays long." ...|$|E

500|$|Clyde's {{unsuccessful}} career {{made him}} the [...] "poster-boy" [...] for bringing up young players. In his autobiography White Rat his first big league manager, future Baseball Hall of Famer [...] Whitey Herzog stated that he was often forced to leave Clyde in the game much longer than usual because fans {{wanted to see the}} 18-year-old [...] "phenom" [...] pitch. It led to Clyde's arm burning out at an early age, Herzog argued. In a 2003 interview with The New York Times, Herzog criticized Bob Short, stating that [...] "(Short) sure wasn't going to send him down without getting some people in the ballpark to see him. The kid should have gone to the minors after two starts." [...] He also said that Clyde [...] "was one of the best young left-handed pitchers I've ever seen." [...] Former teammate Tom Grieve said that keeping Clyde in the roster was the [...] "dumbest thing <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> do to a high school pitcher." ...|$|E
500|$|Warren {{rejects the}} label [...] "video nasty", {{which has been}} applied to Inseminoid on the {{incorrect}} assumption that its violent content made it impossible to release uncut on home video formats in the UK. The film was incorrectly labelled as previously banned in 1984 when it was rereleased in its cut cinema print in 1994 by Vipco. It has long been uncut in the UK on DVD. In response to the idea that the film has attained cult status, he remarks, [...] "if Inseminoid has become some form of cult movie, then I am very pleased and, indeed, very flattered." [...] On his private response to his work, he answers that [...] "I don't think <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> be one hundred percent satisfied with any film you make", and that, in the scenario of remaking Inseminoid, he would darken the lighting of certain scenes to heighten the tension and demand a longer filming schedule.|$|E
500|$|The BLT Cookbook {{discusses}} the author's {{love of the}} BLT sandwich, which according to Jordan is [...] "America's favorite sandwich". The author wrote, [...] "There are times when the BLT just tastes right, primal and true, the best thing <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> eat. The play of the salt and acid, the silk of the tomato against the salt crunch of the bacon ... It is sheer delight." [...] She discusses ways the combination {{can be used in}} soups, appetizers, and salads. Recipes are provided for multiple versions of the BLT sandwich. Jordan writes that to make the best sandwich, one should select the finest ingredients. She recommends shopping at farmers' markets for fresh tomatoes, a butcher for choice bacon, and a bakery for fresh bread. The author recommends mayonnaise brands Hellmann's and Best Foods, and Niman bacon from California. Jordan writes, [...] "For lettuce, remove the first outer leaf and then use only the next three layers. Further in, iceberg lettuce gets a little cabbagey." ...|$|E

500|$|The story {{developed}} from the character of Mark, who {{is based on the}} first boyfriend of Duncan's oldest daughter. Duncan says he [...] "was a very sick young man, and he was the most charming young man <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> meet" [...] but that it [...] "wasn't until things got very bad that we discovered {{he was the kind of}} guy who would swerve in the road to run over a dog." [...] She began to wonder what might happen if a charismatic teenage psychopath was placed in a high school setting and the young people he would attract as followers. 'Then I thought [...] "What could he make them do?" [...] The book moved from there.' Mr. Griffin was based on the personality of a drama teacher one of Duncan's daughters had in high school who [...] "was very strict and demanded that her students do the best work they were capable of doing", but for whom Duncan's daughter was later grateful. Duncan wanted the character to be symbolic of a teacher who is not appreciated at the time, but later is.|$|E
500|$|After {{leaving the}} Secret Agent Corrigan daily strip, he {{illustrated}} the Marvel Comics adaptation of The Empire Strikes Back with Carlos Garzon, {{as well as}} the 50th issue of the monthly Star Wars comic. Williamson was Lucasfilms' first choice as illustrator for the Star Wars newspaper comic strip, a project Williamson had been offered years earlier but had declined to take on at the time. He was offered the Empire Strikes Back adaptation upon Lucasfilm's specific request, as George Lucas had an appreciation of Williamson's EC Comics and Flash Gordon work. Writer Archie Goodwin cited [...] "the comfort of knowing that I would be working with Al Williamson, an old friend that I've worked with over the years. He was absolutely the best Star Wars artist <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> want to have. That makes it easier because you feel that whatever you do as a writer, you have an artist that will make it look great. He's also an artist that Lucasfilm kind of begged and pleaded for and always wanted to have do Star Wars material. There was that comfort factor in it as well." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, [...] "Sober" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics, with several declaring it an album highlight. Comparing its production to {{the works of}} Australian recording artist Sia, George Griffiths of Redbrick deemed it the best song of Gomez's career; praising its placement as the album's musical centerpiece. He elaborated that the themes of empowerment and vulnerability present throughout Revival coalesced into [...] "Sober" [...] "more clearly and coherently than <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> have imagined". In her review, Concrete writer Melissa Haggar called [...] "Sober" [...] a key example of the personal and meaningful lyrics behind Revival, calling the track [...] "somber and satisfying". Haggar {{went on to say}} that the singer: [...] "reflects similar melancholy emotions in bonus tracks like the bittersweet ballad 'Nobody' and the sweeping 'Cologne', which display her more vulnerable side." [...] Idolator writer Mike Wass felt that the track was among the album's best tracks, and compared it to Alessia Cara's single [...] "Here" [...] from her debut album Know-It-All (2015) and Lorde's debut album Pure Heroine (2013), saying [...] "With the rise of relatable-pop, this bittersweet pop anthem should get a warm reception at radio.

500|$|Reviewers also {{praised the}} game's varied {{scenarios}} and replayability. Dora from Jay Is Games praised the game, saying that [...] "with {{a huge amount}} of replay value, creativity to burn, and some of the most shocking plot lines <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> hope to encounter, Hatoful Boyfriend is a fascinating and surprising text adventure well worth checking out", though she also observes that [...] "the delayed payoff and the abruptness of some of the endings combined with the oddball concept may not appeal to every fan of the visual novel genre". Alexa Ray Corriea's Polygon review of the remake gave it an 8 out of 10, concluding that the [...] "witty dialogue and absolutely bonkers scenarios are genuinely fun to discover, and the handful of different storylines make repeated playthroughs worthwhile". Some critics however expressed concerns over the presence of some repetitive aspects of gameplay—noted as being especially apparent when attempting multiple playthroughs—as well as the accessibility of the game's Bad Boys Love scenario to casual players: in his review of the remake for PC Gamer, Julian Murdoch states that [...] "I suspect few will have the patience to ride the fast forward button and suss out the romantic proclivities of each cast member to get to the extended ending—really a second half—of the game".|$|E
500|$|The Diane Martel-directed {{music video}} for [...] "Love Sex Magic" [...] premiered on March 22, 2009. In an {{interview}} with MTV News, Ciara said: [...] "It's all about showing another side of me with this video. I'm basically giving you a show you'd see in Vegas—and it's my love, sex and magic show. He's the voyeur and I play with him a little bit. I got my inspiration from the Crazy Horse show and just from the shows , period. It's giving you the elements of love and sex and magic." [...] In a later interview about the video, Ciara stated {{that she had to}} lick Timberlake's ear, and at one point, he was licking her neck and they were [...] "freestyling." [...] Martel wanted them to do something [...] "edgy," [...] so they found a [...] "cool way to do it." [...] Ciara noted the different pauses in cuts in between the tapings, commenting [...] "so it's licking on the neck, again, then his biting on my neck, again. It was really funny." [...] The singer would later elaborate on the Crazy Horse show reference in {{an interview with}} Blues & Soul, explaining that she had so much respect for the show that it became her reference. On working with Timberlake, she said, [...] "Justin {{is one of the most}} easy-going, down-to-earth, hard-working and passionate artists <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> work with. And, with both me and him, our goal was just to make the best video we could possibly make together, and to give the fans something a little fun and a little unexpected." ...|$|E
500|$|The Open Door {{received}} generally mixed {{to positive}} reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 61, based on twelve reviews, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews". IGN music reviewer Ed Thompson felt that [...] "The Open Door is everything that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> {{want in a}} follow-up album—and more" [...] and added that despite Moody's exit from the band, the remaining members [...] "have not missed a beat." [...] Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone gave the album three-and-a-half stars out of five and said, [...] "When the pain takes over her corseted soul, [...] she just overdubs her big bodice-ripping voice into a choir." [...] Additionally, {{he added that the}} [...] "best songs are the creepiest", and concluded; [...] "Obviously, Lee has got a touch of the magnetic and destructive herself. But that's what makes the breakup songs on The Open Door feel mighty real." [...] Jon Dolan of Entertainment Weekly explained the record is [...] "more personal and, by accessing a deeper emotional palette, maybe even more universal". Blender gave a positive review, confessing, [...] "Denser and more scuzzed-up than Fallen, the album amps everything up to gloriously epic, over-the-top proportions". Billboard said, [...] "Those who embraced Fallen will doubtlessly fall even harder into The Open Door." [...] Spins Mellisa Maerz rated the album with four stars out of five and commented, [...] "A post-dysfunctional kiss-off that builds from ethereal Sunday-mass uplift into full-eff-you guitar dirges, revealing an angrier, more self-assured Lee who waxes sardonic [...] but still misses the comfort in being sad".|$|E

500|$|Like {{the song}} itself, the music video for [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit" [...] was well {{received}} by critics. Rolling Stone writer David Fricke described the video as looking like [...] "the greatest gig <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> imagine." [...] In {{addition to a}} number one placing in the singles category, [...] "Teen Spirit" [...] also topped the music video category in the Village Voices 1991 [...] "Pazz & Jop" [...] poll. The video won Nirvana the Best New Artist and Best Alternative Group awards at the 1992 MTV Video Music Awards, and in 2000 the Guinness World Records named [...] "Teen Spirit" [...] the Most Played Video on MTV Europe. In subsequent years Amy Finnerty, formerly of MTV's Programming department, claimed the video [...] "changed the entire look of MTV" [...] by giving them [...] "a whole new generation to sell to." [...] Rolling Stone placed the music video for [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit" [...] at number two on their 1993 list of [...] "The 100 Top Music Videos". MTV ranked the song's music video at number three on its [...] "100 Greatest Music Videos Ever Made" [...] list in 1999.

500|$|Other aspects {{grew out}} of basic {{concepts}} or ideas. For the episode [...] "Skin", writer Shiban felt that the shapeshifting villain had to change {{into one of the}} lead characters. The character chosen was Dean, and the writers decided not to clear his name of attempted murder {{at the end of the}} episode. Though they at first feared that having one of the main characters be a wanted man would later ruin the show, the writers eventually felt it was [...] "a great layer to add", opening up new potential storylines and characters. Dean's reputation is addressed again in [...] "The Benders", and catches up to him in the second and third seasons. Another element that would influence future episodes came about in [...] "Hook Man" [...] when writers Milbauer and Burton realized that shotguns shoot salt, a weakness for spirits. Kripke deemed it the [...] "perfect combination of occult element", as it brought together a [...] "folkloric repellent of evil" [...] with the [...] "blue-collar aspect of shotguns". The episode [...] "Asylum" [...] later established iron as another weapon against ghosts. [...] "Faith", on the other hand, stemmed from the question of whether it truly was wrong to heal good people of their illnesses at the cost of the lives of strangers. Kripke noted, [...] " [...] really a great girl and she deserves to live, and some stranger you don't even know will die... and maybe that's worth it." [...] Reapers were not in the original script of the episode, but were added later to give the writers a chance to create [...] "scary" [...] sequences and to explain the faith healer's ability. Because the writers found the traditional look of the Reaper—hooded and carrying a sickle—to be cheesy, they ultimately made him appear as [...] "the most shriveled old man <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> imagine".|$|E
500|$|Owing to the {{combination}} of Pink Floyd's partial breakup and Waters' dominance on the project, The Final Cut is sometimes viewed as a de facto Waters solo album. [...] The personal quality assigned to the lyrics are related to Waters' struggle to reconcile his despair at the changing social face of Britain, and also {{the loss of his}} father during the Second World War. [...] Gilmour's guitar solos on [...] "Your Possible Pasts" [...] and [...] "The Fletcher Memorial Home" [...] are, however, sometimes considered the equal of his best work on The Wall. [...] More recent reviews of the album have weighed its importance alongside the band's breakup. [...] Writing for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine said [...] "with its anger, emphasis on lyrics, and sonic textures, it's clear that it's the album that Waters intended it to be. [...] And it's equally clear that Pink Floyd couldn't have continued in this direction...", [...] Stylus Magazine wrote: [...] "It's about pursuing something greater even when you have all the money that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> want. [...] And either failing or succeeding brilliantly. [...] It's up to you to decide whether this record is a success or a failure, but I'd go with the former every time." [...] Rachel Mann of The Quietus said [...] "flawed though it is, The Final Cut remains a tremendous album" [...] and [...] "still has something fresh to say". [...] Mike Diver of Drowned in Sound was less generous: [...] "Rays of light are few and far between, and even on paper the track titles – including 'The Gunner's Dream' and 'Paranoid Eyes' – suggest an arduous listen. [...] Q Magazine once compiled a top ten list of depressing records, and this was on it. [...] Enough said, I think." ...|$|E
