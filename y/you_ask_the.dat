25|$|A {{prayer of}} {{petition}} is {{a request to}} God that asks him to fulfill a need. By prayer of petition, Catholics acknowledge their dependence on God. This expression {{is not intended to}} instruct or direct God what to do, but to appeal to his goodness for the things we need; and the appeal is necessary, not because He is ignorant of our needs or sentiments, but to give definite form to our desires, to concentrate our whole attention on what we have to recommend to him, to help us appreciate our close personal relation with him. The expression need not be external or vocal; internal or mental is sufficient. The prayer of petition is at its heart an Act of Faith in that the one praying must believe first, in the existence of God; and second, that God is both willing and able to grant the petition. The Catechism states that asking forgiveness, coupled with trusting humility, should be the first movement of a prayer of petition. Jesus said to bring our every need to God in his name and assures that “whatever <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> Father in my name he will give you.” (John 16:23) Through petition one can ask for God's help with every need no matter how great or small. According to the Catechism, Christ is glorified by what we ask the Father in his name.|$|E

[...] "Most of the interviews", Leto explained, [...] "I did myself, so they're really intimate. It's me, it's them, and it's the camera. What I've found is, that if you talk to everybody long enough, you find an incredible story. Every single person has a moment in their life, something that they've found a solution for, a story to tell. Some are funny, some are really intriguing, and if <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> right questions, you get interesting answers." ...|$|E

2500|$|Reviews in the {{conservative}} press were more mixed. American economist Mark Skousen praised the film, writing in Human Events, [...] "The script is true to the philosophy of Ayn Rand's novel." [...] The Weekly Standard senior editor Fred Barnes noted that the film [...] "gets Rand's point across forcefully without too much pounding", that it is [...] "fast-paced" [...] {{when compared with the}} original novel's 1200-page length, and that it is [...] "at least as relevant today as it was when the novel was published in 1957." [...] Jack Hunter, contributing editor to The American Conservative, wrote, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> average film critic about the new movie adaptation of Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged they will tell you it is a horrible movie. If <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> average conservative or libertarian they will tell you it is a great movie. Objectively, it is a mediocre movie at best.

2500|$|Afterwards, Gavin {{attended}} the United States Army Infantry School at Fort Benning, Georgia. This school was managed by Colonel George C. Marshall, {{who had brought}} Joseph Stillwell with him to lead the Tactics department. Marshall and Stillwell taught their students not to rely on lengthy written orders, but rather to give rough guidelines for the commanders {{in the field to}} execute as they saw fit, and to let the field commanders do the actual tactical thinking; this was contrary to all other education in the US Army thus far. Gavin himself {{had this to say about}} Stilwell and his methods: [...] "He was a superb officer in that position, hard and tough worker, and he demanded much, always insisting that anything <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> troops to do, you must be able to do yourself." ...|$|E
