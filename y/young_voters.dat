5|$|Prior to the Republican convention, the Lincoln {{campaign}} began cultivating {{a nationwide}} teen and young adult organization, the Wide Awakes, which {{it used to}} generate popular support for Lincoln throughout the country to spearhead large voter registration drives, knowing that new voters and <b>young</b> <b>voters</b> tend to embrace new and young parties. As Lincoln's ideas of abolishing slavery grew, so did his supporters. People of the Northern states knew the Southern states would vote against Lincoln because of his ideas of anti-slavery and took action to rally supporters for Lincoln.|$|E
5|$|Public {{reaction}} to Reagan was always mixed; the oldest president {{up to that}} time was supported by <b>young</b> <b>voters,</b> and began an alliance that shifted many of them to the Republican party. Reagan did not fare well with minority groups, especially African-Americans. This was largely due to his opposition to affirmative action policies. However, his support of Israel throughout his presidency earned him support from many Jews. He emphasized family values in his campaigns and during his presidency, although he was the first president to have been divorced. The combination of Reagan's speaking style, unabashed patriotism, negotiation skills, as well as his savvy use of the media, {{played an important role in}} defining the 1980s and his future legacy.|$|E
5|$|Post {{election}} {{polls showed}} that Humphrey lost the white vote with 38%, nine points behind Nixon, but won the nonwhite vote solidly, 85% to 12%, including 97% of African-Americans. African-Americans favored Humphrey {{because of his}} record on civil rights, and their desire to quickly end the war in Vietnam, where blacks were overrepresented. The racial divide in the election had widened since 1964, and was attributed to civil rights protests and race riots. Humphrey won 45% of the female vote, two points ahead of Nixon, but lost to the Republican among males, 41% to 43%. Voters with only a grade school education supported Humphrey 52% to 33% over Nixon, while Nixon won among both those with no higher education than high school (43% to 42%) and those who graduated from college (54% to 37%). Occupation demographics mirrored these numbers with manual-labor workers supporting Humphrey 50% to 37%, and with white-collar (47% to 41%) and professionals (56% to 34%) favoring Nixon. Humphrey won among <b>young</b> <b>voters</b> (under 30 years old) by 47% to 38%, and also edged Nixon among those between 30 and 49 years, with 44% to 41%. Nixon won among voters over 50 years, 47% to 41%. Catholics backed Humphrey with 59%, twelve points ahead of Nixon, but Protestants favored Nixon, 49% to 35%. Humphrey lost the Independent vote 31% to 44%, with 25% going to Wallace, and won a lower percentage among Democrats (74%) than Nixon won among Republicans (86%). This discrepancy {{was connected to the}} tough Democratic primary election that caused some former McCarthy, Kennedy or McGovern supporters to vote for Nixon or Wallace as a protest.|$|E

25|$|It {{would be}} no {{exaggeration to say that}} the Republican Party has been in a state of panic since the defeat of Mitt Romney, not least because the {{election}} highlighted American demographic shifts and, relatedly, the party's failure to appeal to Hispanics, Asians, single women and <b>young</b> <b>voters.</b> Hence the Republican leadership's new willingness to pursue immigration reform, even if it angers the conservative base.|$|E

[...] The quotation shows that ethnic diversity strongly engages with unengaged young people from immigrant families who have their own identity. And the statistics of number of immigrants prove that social differences affect <b>young</b> <b>voter</b> declines. It also demonstrates the impact of differences of social class, gender and educational experiences in shaping young people’s political orientations and knowledge.|$|R

25|$|Barack Obama has {{the support}} of 85% of Indian Americans, 68% of Chinese Americans, and 57% of Filipino Americans. The Asian American community's {{increasing}} number of <b>young</b> <b>voters</b> has also helped to erode traditionally reliably Republican voting blocs such as Vietnamese and Filipino Americans, leading to an increase in support for Democrats. Prominent Asian-American Democrats include Senators Tammy Duckworth, Daniel Inouye, Daniel Akaka and Mazie Hirono, former Governor and Secretary of Commerce Gary Locke, and Representatives Mike Honda, Judy Chu, Doris Matsui, and Norman Mineta.|$|E

25|$|Unlike Bush, Clinton {{was able}} to unite his fractious and ideologically diverse party behind his candidacy, even when its {{different}} wings were in conflict. To garner the support of moderates and conservative Democrats, he attacked Sister Souljah, a little-known rap musician whose lyrics Clinton condemned. Furthermore, Clinton made clear his support {{of the death penalty}} and would later champion making school uniforms in public schools a requirement. Clinton could also point to his centrist record as Governor of Arkansas. More liberal Democrats were impressed by Clinton's record on abortion and affirmative action. His strong connections to African Americans also played a key role. In addition, he organized significant numbers of <b>young</b> <b>voters</b> and became a symbol of the rise of the Baby Boomer generation to political power. Supporters remained energized and confident, even in times of scandal or missteps.|$|E
25|$|The Nazi Party was {{the largest}} party in the {{national}} elections of 1932. On 31 July 1932 it received 37.3% of the votes, and in the election on 6 November 1932 it received less, but still the largest share, 33.1%, making it the biggest party in the Reichstag. The Communist KPD came third, with 15%. Together, the anti-democratic parties of far right and far left were now able to hold the majority of seats in Parliament, but they were at sword's point with each other, fighting {{it out in the}} streets. The Nazis were particularly successful among Protestants, among unemployed <b>young</b> <b>voters,</b> among the lower middle class in the cities and among the rural population. It was weakest in Catholic areas and in large cities.
