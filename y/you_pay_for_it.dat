"Is it possible," [...] cried Libby, {{pulling in}} his useless oars, and leaning forward upon them, [...] "that {{she has gone}} on letting you think I {{believed}} {{there was going to}} be a storm? She knew perfectly well that I didn't mind what Adams said; he was always croaking." [...] She sat looking at him in a daze, but she could not speak, and he continued. [...] "I see: it happened by one chance in a million to turn out as he said; and she has been making <b>you</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> Why, I suppose," [...] he added, with a melancholy smile of intelligence, [...] "she's had so much satisfaction in holding you responsible for what's happened, that she's almost glad of it!" ...|$|E

Eat {{everything}} that you like until you can't eat any more. The only test is, can <b>you</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>it?</b> If you can't pay for it, don't eat it. And listen--don't worry as to whether your food contains starch, or albumen, or gluten, or nitrogen. If you are a damn fool enough to want these things, go and buy them and eat all you want of them. Go to a laundry and get a bag of starch, and eat your fill of it. Eat it, and take a good long drink of glue after it, and a spoonful of Portland cement. That will gluten you, good and solid.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{answered}} Swart Piet, {{with some}} hesitation. [...] "I {{do not want}} to kill them indeed, but I see no other way, except as regards the girl, of course, who must be saved. These people are to be attacked and robbed by Kaffirs, for it must never be known that I had a hand in it, and you brutes of Kaffirs always kill. Therefore, they must die, alas! especially the Englishman, though so far as I am concerned I should be glad to spare the others if I could, but it cannot be done without throwing suspicion upon me. As for the girl, if she is harmed the lives of all of <b>you</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> You will throw a kaross over her head, and bring her to the place which I will tell you of to-morrow, where I shall come upon you with some men and seem to rescue her.

As soon as we came into the house he took me in his arms, and kissing me, [...] "Now you are my own," [...] says he. [...] "Oh that you had been so good to have done this eleven years ago!" [...] "Then," [...] said I, [...] "you, perhaps, would have been tired of me long ago; it is much better now, for now all our happy days are to come. Besides," [...] said I, [...] "I {{should not have been}} half so rich;" [...] but that I said to myself, for there was no letting him into the reason of it. [...] "Oh!" [...] says he, [...] "I should not have been tired of you; but, besides having the satisfaction of your company, it had saved me that unlucky blow at Paris, which was a dead loss to me of above eight thousand pistoles, and all the fatigues of so many years' hurry and business;" [...] and then he added, [...] "But I'll make <b>you</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> all, now I have you." [...] I started a little at the words. [...] "Ay," [...] said I, [...] "do you threaten already? Pray what d'ye mean by that?" [...] and began to look a little grave.|$|E

You would like to travel in triumphal caravans; to see your effigy {{placarded}} on city walls; to have your levees attended by admiring crowds, all crying out, [...] "Was there ever such a wonder of a woman?" [...] You would like admiration? Consider the tax <b>you</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> You would be alone were you eminent. Were you so distinguished from your neighbors I will not say by a beard and whiskers, that were odious--but by a great and remarkable intellectual superiority--would you, do you think, be any the happier? Consider envy. Consider solitude. Consider the jealousy and torture of mind which this Kentucky lady must feel, suppose she should hear that there is, let us say, a Missouri prodigy, with a beard larger than hers? Consider how she is separated from her kind by the possession of that wonder of a beard? When that beard grows gray, how lonely she will be, the poor old thing! If it falls off, the public admiration falls off too; and how she will miss it--the compliments of the trumpeters, the admiration of the crowd, the gilded progress of the car. I see an old woman alone in a decrepit old caravan, with cobwebs on the knocker, with a blistered ensign flapping idly over the door. Would you like to be that deserted person? Ah, Chloe! To be good, to be simple, to be modest, to be loved, be thy lot. Be thankful thou art not taller, nor stronger, nor richer, nor wiser {{than the rest of the}} world! ...|$|E

5000|$|On August 27, 2013, Samadi {{appeared}} as a guest on {{a segment of the}} Fox & Friends morning television show to discuss whether women should pay more than men for health insurance. At the time of the interview, the gender rating for insurance premiums was common practice among health insurers, with estimates that women paid about $1 billion a year more than men on health insurance. However, under the provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, 2010 (″Obamacare″), the practice was banned effective January 1, 2014, and this is considered {{to be one of the}} most uncontroversial provisions in the law. Samadi argued that women pay more for health insurance, because they, for a number of reasons, tend to use the health care system more than men. He stated that women go through more preventive screening; they give birth; they have mammograms and PAP smears; men do not like to go to the doctor. [...] He said: [...] "I just think that the whole system is not working well. I mean this is one of the examples, where men and women are totally different, there is a sex difference when it comes to the health care use, but I really think that if <b>you</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> you are going to negotiate, finding out where is the best doctor, where you're going to get a better deal on all these X-rays etc., that's how you're gonna save money." ...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the application possibility of “Effect size” and Cohen’s-d index {{in the case}} of introduction of new milk products on the market. The field and online survey were used to establish the potential interest of final consumers for new functional food product of dairy company in Slovenia - milk with phytosterols additives. Two techniques possibilities of Cohen-d index were calculated; manual and using the Cohen’s-d calculator. Further, the application is focused on two main questions in survey regarding observed problem: 1) Would you buy milk with phytosterols additives, which scientifically proven lowers concentration of cholesterol in blood? 2) Would <b>you</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> at a higher price? The sample includes 419 surveys, 150 surveys were conducted on field (control group) and 269 surveys were provided online (experimental group). The Cohen’s-d index (d) results show by using manual and Cohen’s-d calculator for both groups “small” effect (d= 0. 35, i. e. d= 0. 34), and “zero or near zero” effect (d= 0. 15, i. e. = 0. 15) when deciding to buy new milk product...|$|E
40|$|There is a {{tremendous}} demand to electronically buy and sell goods over networks. This field is called electronic commerce, and it has inspired a large variety of work. Unfortunately, much of this activity ignores traditional transaction processing concerns — chiefly atomicity. This paper discusses the role of atomicity in electronic commerce, pointing out various atomic flaws. Special attention {{is given to the}} atomicity problems of digital money proposals. Two examples of highly atomic electronic commerce systems, NetBill and cryptographic postage indicia, are presented. ELECTRONIC COMMERCE If you regularly use the World Wide Web, you have probably noticed that much of the information on it is worth what <b>you</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> To improve the quality of available electronic information, we must create mechanisms to conveniently compensate the creators and owners of network information. If we want to put the Library of Congress online, we will first {{have to find a way}} to compensate copyright owners. Electronic commerce is an attempt to address such problems. The idea is to build mechanisms that make it simple to buy and sell goods online. These mechanisms have attracted significant interest. Besides enabling a new type of commerce, they appear to offer a variety of benefits, including increasing the range of information readily available to most people, 32 n W making automatic search and retrieval of that information easy, and reducing costs by simplifying or eliminating human involvement in processing and fulfilling orders. Here is one indicator of the excitement over electronic commerce: The June 12, 1995, issue of Business Week includes the following projection of the role of electronic commerce. This projection is probably overly optimistic, but it is a sign that electronic commerce is being taken seriously in some quarters...|$|E
