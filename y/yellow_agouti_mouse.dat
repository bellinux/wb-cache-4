40|$|ELEVATED {{synthesis}} of neuropeptide Y (NPY) in the arcuate nucleus {{has been proposed}} {{to play an important}} role in mediating the obese phenotype in genetically obese animals (1, 2). This hypothesis is widely viewed as credible because 1) experimental elevation of hypothalamic NPY can induce obesity (1); 2) in some forms of genetic obesity, NPY messenger RNA (mRNA) in the arcuate nucleus is elevated (3 – 6); 3) leptin inhibits NPY mRNA in the arcuate nucleus (3, 7); and 4) obesity is attenuated in leptindeficient ob/ob mice that lack NPY (8). On the other hand, reduced POMC activity is also implicated in obesity, as 1) obesity in <b>yellow</b> <b>agouti</b> <b>mice</b> is associated with interference in response to �MSH, which is derived from POMC (9 – 13); 2) genetic deletion of an �MSH receptor produces obesity (14); 3) central administration of �MSH or a melanocortin- 4 receptor agonist inhibits food intake, whereas a melanocortin- 4 receptor antagonist stimulates food intake (13, 15); and 4) the expression of hypothalamic POMC mRNA is reduced in genetically obese ob/ob and db/db mice and is stimulated by leptin (16 – 18). Obesity can be acquired through several perturbations, including hypothalamic damage.

40|$|An {{electron}} microscope study of ultrathin sections of trophoblast cells of implanting blastocysts {{resulting from the}} crossing of heterozygous <b>yellow</b> <b>agouti</b> <b>mice</b> has been conducted. Several conditions for successful preparation of the blastocysts have been described. These include avoidance {{of the use of}} sucrose in the buffers, reduction of specimen washing times and exclusion of propylene oxide from the dehydration procedure. Electron micrographs of cells from a blastocyst considered, on the basis of light microscopy, to be 'abnormal' revealed a cytoplasm with many 'empty' areas and numerous 'vacuolated' mitochondria. Electron micrographs of cells from blastocysts considered to be 'normal' revealed, in one instance, a preponderance of cells with very few of these 'abnormal' features, and, in the other instance, a preponderance of cells with many abnormalities. Both 'normal' blastocysts revealed cellular features usually regarded as either primitive or pathological, namely tight junctions, vacuolated mitochondria and mitochondria with cristae oriented parallel to their long axis. It was generally concluded that the appearance of the blastocysts, in the light microscope, at 100 - 105 hours of development, could not be used as a valid criterion of normality or abnormality, for, although a blastocyst classified as 'abnormal' under the light microscope appeared 'abnormal' also in the {{electron microscope}}, those classified as 'normal' under the light microscope appeared either 'normal' or 'abnormal' in the electron microscope. This disturbing situation may indicate that the electron microscope is diagnosing 'abnormality' before the light microscope.

40|$|Early {{nutrition}} affects adult metabolism {{in humans}} and other mammals, potentially via persistent alter-ations in DNA methylation. With viable <b>yellow</b> <b>agouti</b> (Avy) <b>mice,</b> which harbor a transposable {{element in the}} agouti gene, we tested {{the hypothesis that the}} metastable methylation status of specific transposable element insertion sites renders them epigenetically labile to early methyl donor nutrition. Our results show that dietary methyl supplementation of a/a dams with extra folic acid, vitamin B 12, choline, and betaine alter the phenotype of their Avy/a offspring via increased CpG methylation at the Avy locus and that the epigenetic metastability which confers this lability is due to the Avy transposable element. These findings suggest that dietary supple-mentation, long presumed to be purely beneficial, may have unintended deleterious influences on the estab-lishment of epigenetic gene regulation in humans. Human epidemiologic and animal model data indicate that susceptibility to adult-onset chronic disease is influenced by persistent adaptations to prenatal and early postnatal nutrition (1, 2, 13, 14); however, the specific biological mechanisms underlying such adaptations remain largely unknown.

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} of fetal origins of adult disease posits that early developmental exposures involve epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, that influence adult disease susceptibility. In utero or neonatal exposure to bisphenol A (BPA), a high-production-volume chemical {{used in the}} manufacture of polycarbonate plastic, is associated with higher body weight, increased breast and prostate cancer, and altered reproductive function. This study shows that maternal exposure to this endocrine-active compound shifted the coat color distribution of viable <b>yellow</b> <b>agouti</b> (Avy) <b>mouse</b> offspring toward yellow by decreasing CpG (cytosine-guanine dinucleotide) methylation in an intracisternal A particle retrotransposon upstream of the Agouti gene. CpG methylation also was decreased at another metastable locus, the CDK 5 activator-binding protein (CabpIAP). DNA methylation at the Avy locus was similar in tissues from the three germ layers, providing evidence that epigenetic patterning during early stem cell development is sensitive to BPA exposure. Moreover, maternal dietary supplementation, with either methyl donors like folic acid or the phytoestrogen genistein, negated the DNA hypomethylating effect of BPA. Thus, we present compelling evidence that early developmental exposure to BPA can change offspring phenotype by stably altering the epigenome, an effect that can be counteracted by maternal dietary supplements...|$|R

Here, we report that maternal dietary genistein supplementation of mice during gestation, at levels comparable with humans consuming high-soy diets, shifted the coat color of heterozygous viable <b>yellow</b> <b>agouti</b> (A vy /a) offspring toward pseudoagouti. This marked phenotypic change was significantly associated with increased methylation of six cytosine–guanine sites in a retrotransposon upstream of the transcription start site of the Agouti gene. The extent of this DNA methylation was similar in endodermal, mesodermal, and ectodermal tissues, indicating that genistein acts during early embryonic development. Moreover, this genistein-induced hypermethylation persisted into adulthood, decreasing ectopic Agouti expression and protecting offspring from obesity. Thus, we provide the first evidence that in utero dietary genistein affects gene expression and alters susceptibility to obesity in adulthood by permanently altering the epigenome.

Intracerebroventricular infusion of antisense oligonucleotide targeted to this transcript selectively suppressed its hypothalamic mRNA levels and resulted in loss of body weight in both P. obesus and Sprague Dawley rats. Reductions in body weight were mediated by profoundly reduced food intake without a concomitant reduction in metabolic rate. Yeast two-hybrid screening, and confirmation in mammalian cells by bioluminescence resonance energy transfer analysis, demonstrated that the protein it encodes interacts with endophilins, mediators of synaptic vesicle recycling and receptor endocytosis in the brain.

Global methylation analysis reveals hypermethylation in tail tissue of a/a and A vy /a offspring across all dose groups compared with controls (n = 11 litters; P < 0. 02). Analysis of coat color phenotype replicates previous work showing that the distribution of 50 mg BPA/kg A vy /a offspring shifts toward yellow (P = 0. 006) by decreasing DNA methylation in the retrotransposon upstream of the Agouti gene (P = 0. 03). Maternal exposure to 50 μg or 50 ng BPA/kg, however, results in altered coat color distributions in comparison with control (P = 0. 04 and 0. 02), but no DNA methylation effects at the Agouti gene are noted. DNA methylation at the CDK 5 activator‐binding protein (Cabp IAP) metastable epiallele shows hypermethylation in the 50 μg BPA/kg offspring, compared with controls (P = 0. 02). Comparison of exposed mouse liver BPA levels to human fetal liver BPA levels indicates that the three experimental exposures are physiologically relevant. Thus, perinatal BPA exposure affects offspring phenotype and epigenetic regulation across multiple doses, indicating the need to evaluate dose effects in human clinical and population studies.

40|$|There is {{increasing}} evidence in both {{plants and animals}} that epigenetic marks are not always cleared between generations. Incomplete erasure at genes associated with a measurable phenotype results in unusual patterns of inheritance {{from one generation to}} the next, termed transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. The <b>Agouti</b> viable <b>yellow</b> (A vy) allele is the best-studied example of this phenomenon in mice. The A vy allele is the result of a retrotransposon insertion upstream of the Agouti gene. Expression at this locus is controlled by the long terminal repeat (LTR) of the retrotransposon, and expression results in a yellow coat and correlates with hypomethylation of the LTR. Isogenic mice display variable expressivity, resulting in mice with a range of coat colours, from <b>yellow</b> through to <b>agouti.</b> <b>Agouti</b> <b>mice</b> have a methylated LTR. The locus displays epigenetic inheritance following maternal but not paternal transmission; yellow mothers produce more <b>yellow</b> offspring than <b>agouti</b> mothers. We have analysed the DNA methylation in mature gametes, zygotes, and blastocysts and found that the paternally and maternally inherited alleles are treated differently. The paternally inherited allele is demethylated rapidly, and the maternal allele is demethylated more slowly, in a manner similar to that of nonimprinted single-copy genes. Interestingly, following maternal transmission of the allele, there is no DNA methylation in the blastocyst, suggesting that DNA methylation is not the inherited mark.

A depressed basal lipolytic rate in adipocytes or a decreased adrenergic tone arising from antagonizing alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) activation of melanocortin receptors (MCR) {{could be at}} {{the origin of the}} obesity phenotype. MATERIAL AND METHODS: MCR 4 and 5 (MC 4 R, MC 5 R) genes were studied in the QuÃ©bec Family Study. Sequence variations were detected by Southern blot probing of restricted genomic DNA, and mRNA tissue expression was detected by RT-PCR. Subjects {{with a wide range of}} weight were used for single-point sib-pair linkage studies (maximum of 289 sibships from 124 nuclear families). Analysis of variance across genotypes in unrelated males (n = 143) and females (n = 156) was also undertaken. Body mass index (BMI), sum of six skin-folds (SF 6), fat mass (FM), percent body fat (%FAT), respiratory quotient (RQ), resting metabolic rate (RMR), fasting glucose and insulin, and glucose and insulin area during an oral glucose tolerance test were analyzed. RESULTS: MC 4 R showed polymorphism with NcoI, and MC 5 R, with PstI and PvuII, with a heterozygosity of 0. 38, 0. 10, and 0. 20, respectively. Linkages were observed between MC 5 R and BMI (p = 0. 001), SF 6 (p = 0. 005), FM (p = 0. 001), and RMR (p = 0. 002), whereas associations were observed in females between MC 5 R and BMI (p = 0. 003), and between MC 4 R and FM (p = 0. 002) and %FAT (p = 0. 004). After correction for multiple tests, these p values are lowered by one tenth. MC 4 R and MC 5 R mRNAs have been detected in brain, adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle.

40|$|Low-dose {{ionizing}} radiation (LDIR) exposure (under 10. 0 centigray (cGy)) from man-made sources, such as diagnostic imaging, predominates in the US population and comprises nearly 50 % {{of an average}} individual's yearly radiation exposure (Ullrich, Brooks et al. 2009). The increase in such exposures has led to public and government alarm {{about the impact of}} LDIR on human health (Ullrich, Brooks et al. 2009). Besides the mutational effects of radiation exposure, there is concern it might also result in modifications of the epigenome. Such aberrations can disrupt normal development and are involved in the progression of numerous diseases, including cancer (Gasser and Li 2011). High doses of radiation (> 100. 0 cGy) have been shown to cause epigenetic disruption (Kaup, Grandjean et al. 2006; Tamminga, Koturbash et al. 2008; Ilnytskyy, Koturbash et al. 2009), which is necessary for the persistence of radiation-induced genomic instability (Rugo, Mutamba et al. 2011); however, it is presently unclear to what extent LDIR in vivo alters the epigenome. The viable <b>yellow</b> <b>agouti</b> (Avy) <b>mouse</b> was used here to characterize the dose-dependent epigenetic response to LDIR. The Avy mouse is a unique biological model that functions as a biosensor for environmentally induced epigenetic changes and disease susceptibility due to the presence of a metastable epiallele that modulates coat color (Waterland and Jirtle 2003). Pregnant dams were whole-body exposed to one of five doses of X-ray radiation ranging from 0 - 10. 0 cGy on gestational day 4. 5. Using a phantom mouse model, the intrauterine doses were estimated to be 0. 0 cGy, 0. 4 cGy, 0. 7 cGy, 1. 4 cGy, 3. 0 cGy, and 7. 6 cGy, respectively. At weaning, offspring coat colors were assessed and tissues were collected for methylation analysis. First, methylation changes at CpG sites in the Avy and Cdk activator binding protein (CabpIAP) metastable epialleles and at intracisternal a particle (IAP) elements across the genome were quantified using Sequenom technology. Second, three imprinted genes, Peg 3, Nnat, and H 19, were assessed for methylation changes in differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that regulate their parent-of-origin monoallelic expression using Sequenom technology. Lastly, it was postulated that the epigenetic changes at the Avy locus could be counteracted with dietary alterations. To test this hypothesis, female mice were placed on an antioxidant-supplemented diet prior to pregnancy and throughout gestation and lactation. Pregnant dams were irradiated with 3. 0 cGy of whole-body X-rays. Offspring coat colors were assessed and methylation changes at the Avy allele were measured with the Sequenom platform. Herein, I demonstrate that in utero LDIR exposure induced epigenetic changes in the Avy mouse in a dose-dependent and sex-specific manner. Acute, whole-body exposure to 0. 7 cGy, 1. 4 cGy, 3. 0 cGy or 7. 6 cGy X-rays significantly shifted offspring coat color distribution toward pseudoagouti. Acute exposure to 1. 4 cGy, 3. 0 cGy, and 7. 6 cGy significantly increased methylation at multiple CpG sites in the Avy metastable epiallele in male offspring, but not female offspring. Methylation changes at DMRs in Nnat, Peg 3, and H 19 also occurred in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, inhibition of the phenotypic and Avy methylation changes with an antioxidant-supplemented diet suggests that the mechanisms to induce epigenetic changes are mediated by oxidative stress. These results demonstrate that relevant, low doses of radiation can elicit epigenetic changes that lead to a persistent phenotype, but can be mitigated with dietary supplementation. The successful completion of this project has resulted in the first in vivo epigenetic characterization of LDIR exposure and will {{contribute to the development of}} more relevant risk assessment strategies for protecting human populations.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Epigenetics is {{the study}} of the {{heritable}} changes in gene expression that occur without a change in the DNA sequence itself. These heritable epigenetic changes include chromatin folding and attachment to the nuclear matrix, packaging of DNA around nucleosomes, histone modifications, and DNA methylation. The epigenome is particularly susceptible to dysregulation during gesta-tion, neonatal development, puberty, and old age. Nevertheless, it is most vulnerable to environmental factors during embryogenesis be-cause the DNA synthetic rate is high, and the elaborate DNA methylation patterning and chromatin structure required for normal tissue development is established during early development.

In addition to inducing genetic mutations, there is concern that LDIR may also alter the epigenome. Such heritable effects early in life can either be positively adaptive or result in the enhanced formation of diseases, including cancer, diabetes, and obesity. Herein, we show that LDIR significantly increased DNA methylation at the viable <b>yellow</b> <b>agouti</b> (A(vy)) locus in a sex-specific manner (P= 0. 004).

40|$|Both {{oestrogen}} deficiency and the {{inflammatory disease}} {{contribute to the}} generalized bone loss seen in postmenopausal rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Oestradiol and the selective oestrogen receptor modulator raloxifene {{have been shown to}} ameliorate the disease in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), a well-established animal model for human RA. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether raloxifene-treatment would be beneficial in long-term treatment of established CIA, both regarding anti-arthritic and anti-osteoporotic properties. Female dilute brown <b>agouti</b> <b>mice</b> were ovariectomized and CIA was induced. Raloxifene or vehicle treatment was administered 5 days per week, and the clinical arthritis score was evaluated continuously. At termination, bone mineral density was analysed, paws were collected for histological examination and sera were analysed for markers of bone and cartilage turnover, as well as antibodies to type II collagen and levels of interleukin (IL) - 6. Treatment with raloxifene is beneficial in long-term treatment of established CIA. It hampers the disease severity and frequency, protects the joints from destruction and protects against the development of osteoporosis. The proinflammatory cytokine IL- 6 was down-regulated in raloxifene-treated mice compared with controls. The serum levels of antibodies to collagen were not affected by raloxifene-treatment. Long-term treatment with raloxifene has both anti-arthritic and anti-osteoporotic effects in established experimental postmenopausal polyarthritis...|$|R
40|$|Mammalian melanins {{exist in}} two {{chemically}} distinct forms: the brown to black eumelanins {{and the yellow}} to reddish pheomelanins. Melanogenesis is influenced {{by a number of}} genes, the levels of whose products determine {{the quantity and quality of}} the melanins produced. To examine the effects of various coat-color genes on the chemical properties of melanins synthesized in the follicular melanocytes of mice, we have introduced new methods to solubilize differentially pheomelanins and brown-type eumelanins. We applied these and previously developed high-performance liquid chromatography and spectrophotometric methods for assaying eu- and pheontelanins to characterize melanins in various mutant mice: black, lethal <b>yellow,</b> viable <b>yellow,</b> <b>agouti,</b> brown, light, albino, dilute, recessive yellow, pink-eyed dilution, slaty, and silver. It was demonstrated that 1) complete solubilization of melanins in Soluene- 350 is a convenient method to estimate the total amount of eu- and pheomelanins, 2) lethal yellow, viable yellow, and recessive yellow hairs contain almost pure pheomelanins, and 3) melanins from brown, light, silver, and pink-eyed black hairs share chemical properties in common that are characterized by partial solubility In strong alkali. We suggest that 1) the brown-type eumelanins have lower degrees of polymerization than the black-type eumelanins, and 2) slaty hair melanin contains a greatly reduced ratio of 5, 6 -dihydroxyindole- 2 -carboxylic acid-derived units as compared with black and other eumelanic hair melanins. These results indicate that our methodology, high-performance liquid chromatography and spectrophotometric methods combined, may be useful in chemically characterizing melanin pigments produced in follicular melanocytes...|$|R
40|$|Mutations in {{the obese}} (ob) gene lead to obesity. This gene has been {{recently}} cloned, but the factors regulating its expression {{have not been}} elucidated. To address the regulation of the ob gene with regard to body weight and nutritional factors, Northern blot {{analysis was used to}} assess ob mRNA in adipose tissue from mice [lean, obese due to diet, or genetically (<b>yellow</b> <b>agouti)</b> obese] under different nutritional conditions. ob mRNA was elevated in both forms of obesity, compared to lean controls, correlated with elevations in plasma insulin and body weight, but not plasma glucose. In lean C 57 BL/ 6 J mice, but not in mice with diet-induced obesity, ob mRNA decreased after a 48 -hr fast. Similarly, in lean C 57 BL/ 6 J controls, but not in obese yellow mice, i. p. glucose injection significantly increased ob mRNA. For up to 30 min after glucose injection, ob mRNA in lean mice significantly correlated with plasma glucose, but not with plasma insulin. In a separate study with only lean mice, ob mRNA was inhibited > 90 % by fasting, and elevated approximately 2 -fold 30 min after i. p. injection of either glucose or insulin. These results suggest that in lean animals glucose and insulin enhance ob gene expression. In contrast to our results in lean mice, in obese animals ob mRNA is elevated and relatively insensitive to nutritional state, possibly due to chronic exposure to elevated plasma insulin and/or glucose...|$|R
40|$|The agouti protein regulates {{pigmentation}} in {{the mouse}} hair follicle producing a black {{hair with a}} subapical yellow band. Its effect on pigmentation is achieved by antagonizing the binding of alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) to melanocortin 1 receptor (Mc 1 r), switching melanin synthesis from eumelanin (black/brown) to phaeomelanin (red/yellow). Dominant mutations in the non-coding region of <b>mouse</b> <b>agouti</b> cause <b>yellow</b> coat colour and ectopic expression also results in obesity, type 11 diabetes, increased somatic growth and tumourigenesis. At least some of these pleiotropic effects {{can be explained by}} antagonism of other members of the melanocortin receptor family by <b>agouti</b> protein. The <b>yellow</b> coat colour is the result of agouti chronically antagonizing the binding of alpha-MSH to Mc 1 r and the obese phenotype results from agouti protein antagonizing the binding of alpha-MSH to Mc 3 r and/or Mc 4 r. Despite the existence of a highly homologous agouti protein in humans, agouti signal protein (ASIP), its role has yet to be defined. However it is known that human ASIP is expressed at highest levels in adipose tissue where it may antagonize one of the melanocortin receptors. The conserved nature of the agouti protein combined with the diverse phenotypic effects of <b>agouti</b> mutations in <b>mouse</b> and the different expression patterns of human and <b>mouse</b> <b>agouti,</b> suggest ASIP {{may play a role in}} human energy homeostasis and possibly human pigmentation...|$|R

"May 2013 "Epigenetics is the study of how heritable phenotypes are transmitted without changes being made to the DNA sequence. One of the best characterized animal models for epigenetics is the viable yellow (Avy) mouse. These animals exhibit a range of coat colors that reflect the degree of methylation of an intracisternal A particle (IAP) inserted in the <b>agouti</b> gene. <b>Yellow</b> coat color Avy mice, with an under-methylated IAP, exhibit altered expression of the agouti gene, which leads to obesity and diabetes; in contrast, brown Avy siblings, with a highly methylated IAP, and black (a/a) pelage siblings, lacking the IAP, remain healthy. Along with overt phenotypic differences, epigenetic modifications are also thought to change normal behaviors. Here, we examined whether behavioral and body weight differences exist between brown and yellow morph (Avy/a) and black pelage (a/a) mice as they age. In another experiment, a diet high in methyl donors was fed to the Avy/a mice to determine if it would have an effect on coat color, weight, and/or diabetic status. We demonstrated that there are body weight and behavioral differences between non-agouti and <b>agouti</b> <b>mice.</b> <b>Yellow</b> mice were more lethargic and less motivated to complete the mazes compared to darker furred mice. Brown and black mice outperformed their yellow counterparts in almost all mazes and weighed less by puberty. Caloric differences in the diets explain most phenotypic differences seen in the mice but not in the increase in serum glucose concentrations in mice on the methyl-donor diet...|$|R
