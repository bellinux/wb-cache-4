25|$|With {{millions}} of others I had prayed hard {{at the time of}} Dunkirk and never did prayer seem to be more speedily answered to the full. And we prayed for France and the next day she surrendered. I thought much, and when I went to bed I lay for a long time vividly awake. And I went over in my mind what had happened, concentrating on the thoughts that you had dwelt on, that prayer to be effective must be in accordance with God's will, and that by far the hardest thing to say from the heart and indeed the last lesson we learn (if we ever do) is to say and mean it, ‘Thy will be done.’ And I thought what mites we all are and how we can never see God's plan, a plan on such a scale that it must be incomprehensible. And suddenly for what must have been a couple of minutes I seemed to see with extraordinary and vivid clarity and to hear someone speaking to me. The words at the time were clear, but the recollection of them had passed when I seemed to come to, as it were, but the sense remained, and the sense was this. ‘You cannot see the plan’; then ‘Have you not thought there is a purpose in stripping you one by one of all the human props on which you depend, that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>being</b> left alone in the world? You have now one upon whom to lean and I have chosen you as my instrument to work with my will. Why then are you afraid?’ And to prove ourselves worthy of that tremendous task is our job.|$|E
500|$|In the Reconstruction Era, Beecher {{sided with}} President Andrew Johnson's plan for swift {{restoration}} of Southern {{states to the}} Union. He believed that captains of industry should be the leaders of society and supported Social Darwinist ideas. During the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, he preached strongly against the strikers whose wages had been cut, stating, [...] "Man cannot live by bread alone but the man who cannot live on bread and water is not fit to live," [...] and [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>being</b> reduced, go down boldly into poverty". His remarks were so unpopular that cries of [...] "Hang Beecher!" [...] became common at labor rallies, and plainclothes detectives protected his church.|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. About.com writer Bill Lamb rated [...] "Come Back to Me" [...] {{three and a}} half stars out of five; he praised its pop sound and Hudgens' [...] "engaging personality", but criticized it for having a manufactured sound from the [...] "Disney pop factory". Moreover, Lamb wrote: [...] "'Come Back to Me' is unlikely to linger too long in your memory, but it also fails to generate any annoying after taste. Program it into your listening when you need a contemporary, breezy, light pop confection... Sure, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>being</b> manipulated by the corporate music establishment, but the song is fun." [...] He also noted that the [...] "Baby Come Back" [...] sample was possibly added to [...] "trigger pleasant deja vu in parents listening along with their kids". In an editorial review for Rhapsody, Nick Cavalieri named the song one of the best tracks on V.|$|E

500|$|The court then {{considered}} {{whether the}} accused had taken action that waived those rights. Waiver {{must be a}} free choice with full awareness (Moran v. Burbine). Miranda v. Arizona (the Miranda ruling) states that [...] " [...] heavy burden rests on the government {{to demonstrate that the}} defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his privilege against self-incrimination and his right to retained or appointed counsel." [...] It was noted that the accused had read and expressed understanding of the rights, and had them read aloud, he had not pleaded lack of understanding, was given time, and therefore knew his rights. Specifically, having read the 5th warning ("you have the right to decide at any time before or during questioning to use your right to remain silent and your right to talk with a lawyer while <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>being</b> questioned") he was aware this right was enduring and could be applied {{at any time in the}} questioning if he chose, and the police would have to honor the invocation if he did so. The court observed that [...] "olice are not required to rewarn suspects from time to time". That a question is linked to religious beliefs does not cause the reply to be [...] "involuntary". The accused, understanding his rights and that they were capable of invocation at any point, had not chosen to invoke them.|$|E

[...] Jones wrote [...] "I can't do Groklaw without your input.... and there is now no private way, evidently, to collaborate." [...] and [...] "What I do know is it's not possible to be fully human if <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>being</b> surveilled 24/7... I hope that makes it clear why I can't continue.

2500|$|The England cricket team {{played a}} One Day International (ODI) match against Scotland on 9 May 2014 as a warm-up for their series against Sri Lanka and India {{later in the}} summer. The match was played at Mannofield Park in Aberdeen, the 11th ODI to be played at the ground, with one match that was abandoned. England won the game by 39 runs. After the match, England captain Alastair Cook said that due to the rain that the match [...] "probably wasn't fit to play, if <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>being</b> totally honest. But just in a one-off game, with not so much riding on it, I {{think it was the}} right {{decision}} to play".|$|E
2500|$|Neal Ascherson defended Kapuściński in March 2010 by saying: [...] "None of the doubts, {{as far as}} I can see, {{are about}} the despatches and {{features}} he sent to newspapers, or to the Polish Press Agency. They are about his books. The adventures and encounters he describes in his books are on a different level of veracity. Like his friend Gabriel García Márquez, Kapuściński {{used to talk about}} [...] "literary reportage". You're meant to believe what <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>being</b> told, but not in every literal detail. [...] Scrupulous in his journalism, in his books he was capable of inventing {{in order to make a}} truth even truer. He was a great story-teller, but not a liar." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Eisenhower {{administration}} {{believed that}} if Nasser were able to secure Soviet economic support for the high dam, that would be beyond {{the capacity of the}} Soviet Union to support, and in turn would strain Soviet-Egyptian relations. Eisenhower wrote in March 1956 that [...] "If Egypt finds herself thus isolated {{from the rest of the}} Arab world, and with no ally in sight except Soviet Russia, she would very quickly get sick of the prospect and would join us in the search for a just and decent peace in the region". Dulles told his brother, CIA director Allen Dulles, [...] "If they [...] do make this offer we can make a lot of use of it in propaganda within the satellite bloc. You don't get bread because <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>being</b> squeezed to build a dam".|$|E

2500|$|Mark uses a clue from Rose's {{letter to}} {{discover}} that beneath each floor is a secret crawl space. He follows hidden passages to a suite of rooms where he finds Professor Arnold who reveals, via a mechanical voice generator, {{that he is in}} fact Varelli. He tries to kill Mark with a hypodermic injection. During the struggle, Varelli's neck is caught in his vocal apparatus, choking him. Mark frees him, only to be told by the dying man, [...] "Even now <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>being</b> watched." [...] Mark follows a shadowy figure to a lavishly furnished chamber, where he finds Varelli's nurse. Laughing maniacally, she reveals to him that she is Mater Tenebrarum. She suddenly transforms into Death Personified. However, the fire that has consumed much of the building enables Mark to escape from the witch's den.

In fact, it was all from which a sober fellow revolts." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Cossey," [...] {{answered}} the Squire, with his politest and most old- fashioned bow, [...] "whatever sympathy I {{may have felt}} for <b>you</b> <b>is</b> <b>being</b> rapidly alienated by your manner.
