500|$|Woodburne {{has said}} she never gets bored of playing Susan as she changes all the time. She added [...] "One of the upsides of this job {{is that in a}} week <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> doing {{absolute}} slapstick comedy, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> doing high drama/tragedy and in between maybe some nice subtle interesting stuff as well, the character keeps changing and evolving depending on who she is interacting with". Woodburne has said that her favourite storyline has been the Susan, Karl and Izzy love triangle. As Susan is normally a good person, it gave her a chance to have a character (Izzy) that she could hate. Woodburne added [...] "It was good to play those much meaner, darker, angrier, cruel moments than always to be the kind character. It was good to see those dents in her armour I think".|$|E

He was a head prefect at Pasir Panjang Primary School (which his father became {{principal}} of years later) and a prefect while at Raffles Institution. Following his A-levels he was considering business administration, but ended up accepting a scholarship from DBS Bank to study law instead. According to Woon in an April 2008 interview, [...] "When I went for the scholarship interview, the interviewer said, 'We looked at your results and you look like <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> a lawyer; {{would you like to}} do law?'

The time now grows late. We shall therefore give you a little more time to consider of it and therefore desire that you attend the court again in the morning." [...] The first day had gone fairly well for Hutchinson, who had held her own in a battle of wits with the magistrates. Biographer Eve LaPlante suggests, [...] "Her success before the court may have astonished her judges, but it was no surprise to her. [...] She was confident of herself and her intellectual tools, largely because of the intimacy she felt with God." ...|$|E

I'm not resigned to let the story go on. It has all to be sorted out before the season." [...] He added that if Vieira chose to leave, the club could sufficiently replace him: [...] "We've worked very hard {{in the last five years}} to get good young players in and you saw that today." [...] Reyes, who was named man of the match, was frustrated at his missed chance early in the second half, but continued: [...] "I set one up and then scored myself so I was much happier." [...] Bergkamp was impressed with Fàbregas's performance in the match: [...] "Normally at 17, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> a bit unsure when you step out. But with players like Cesc, the way he has developed in one year is quite amazing." ...|$|E
500|$|Scott Shetler of Pop Crush {{noted that}} the song was {{indirectly}} about Lopez's ex-boyfriends and husbands. He commented that the song was [...] "obviously condemning several exes" [...] and wrote [...] "A logical reading of the lyrics, though, reveals that the “bad boy” is probably Lopez’s former long-term boyfriend and Bad Boy Records founder Diddy, while the guy J. Lo danced with until saying “I do” is her second husband Cris Judd, a professional dancer and choreographer. The lyrics go on to reference two more men, who {{would seem to be}} Ben Affleck (“went nowhere but kept the ring”) and Lopez’s current husband, Marc Anthony (“he sang to me.”)" [...] Allison Stewart from The Washington Post said that [...] "One Love" [...] examines all of her high-profiled relationships, and commented that Lopez is not [...] "trying to gin up controversy with these red-meat tidbits about her personal life.

500|$|... "Wet Hot Demonic Summer" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. David Hinckley of New York Daily News rated it {{four out of}} five stars and commented that although it may not make sense to some viewers, it is [...] "equally possible they will keep watching anyway because the jokes work so well all by themselves". Hinckley went on to remark that [...] "Ugly Americans packs a lot into 21 or 22 minutes. Happily, its often droll and deadpan style makes it easy to watch even if some of the references are whizzing by unappreciated". RedEye critic Curt Wagner rated it three stars out of four and wrote that it includes [...] "visual [...] ", cultural references and [...] "so-fast-you'll-miss-them jokes" [...] that it might require multiple viewings. Wagner, however, meant that this was a rather positive feature, writing: [...] "For example, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> laughing so hard at what just happened that you miss a fun line..." [...] Lastly, Wagner observed that [...] "Ugly Americans can be gross and bizarre, but everything makes sense in the world that it has created".|$|E

He also gives her a large silver cross pendant. In The Bronze, Buffy meets Willow and encourages her to seize the moment: [...] "Because tomorrow <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> dead." [...] She finds Giles and tells him about the stranger. Giles tells her to learn to hone her skills to sense vampires anywhere. Buffy uses her fashion sense to pick out a vampire (J.

Cordelia immediately calls her friends {{to tell them about}} it. While Buffy looks for Willow, Jesse chats up Darla at The Bronze.

During the roast, Pam says Michael's penis is so small, [...] "If it were an iPod, it would be a Shuffle", a reference to the smallest of the Apple Inc. portable media player brands. Kelly said she would rather kiss Lord Voldemort, the hideous antagonist of the Harry Potter novels and films, than Michael. Andy sings a song about Michael, [...] "What I Hate About You", to the tune of the rock song by The Romantics, [...] "What I Like About You". Angela makes a joke, [...] "If you put sunblock on a window, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> Michael Scott", which is modeled after the [...] "you might be a redneck" [...] one-liner jokes by comedian Jeff Foxworthy.

Imagine living your life knowing {{that at any}} point <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> CRUSHED BY THE WEIGHT OF YOUR OWN AMAZINGNESS", noting that the band Dragonette was a large part behind {{the success of the}} track. Dan Lambden from the online magazine So So Gay found the song to be a [...] "perfect medium between classic pop lyrics" [...] and [...] "a pulsating dance beat", and positively commented on the riffs within the track stating they would [...] "satisfy the most Hoxton of hipsters". Emily Mackay from NME declared [...] "I'd be a bit freaked out by a phonecall like that" [...] in response to the lyrics [...] "I’d like a phone call/I’d like to hear something like this—WAHWAHWAHWAH". Mackay called the track [...] "classy" [...] and concluded her review saying [...] "the sugar-spun electropop goes down smooth." [...] Despite listing [...] "Lucky Day" [...] as one of the singles of the week, Alex Macpherson of Metro gave a predominantly negative review noting [...] "She’s lionised by a cult fan base, but wider appeal remains elusive" [...] and further explaining that [...] "her voice is simultaneously too weak and shrill to carry".|$|E
500|$|Discussing her own {{reaction}} to the storyline, Smith has commented; [...] "I was psyched. I {{thought it was a}} great idea." [...] She revealed that the writers have not fully divulged Hahn's romantic backstory to her, explaining; [...] "a lot of it is still vague. I mean, there's what the writers think and what I've sort of thought, and in my mind. Maybe I had a crush in high school or in college or something— there was something, but I don't think it's ever— I think it might be her first time." [...] Continuing with this theme, Smith also spoke with Kristin Dos Santos for E! about her character's lack of definitive romantic history, jesting; [...] "I'll look at the script next week and be like [...] "Oh my God, I've been a lesbian for years and I didn't know." [...] She also discussed the meetings with GLAAD she and Ramirez attended, and their impact on her portrayal of the storyline, explaining: [...] "It was actually very helpful because they did talk about their own personal lives, and how, I guess if you're an open person, and life is change, then anything can happen. And it could really rock your world I imagine, if you all of a sudden thought that <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> in love with a woman and maybe you weren't before." ...|$|E

In an interview with Eamonn Holmes for Sky News Sunrise in December 2010, Burke stated that [...] "The Silence" [...] was released as a promotional single for the re-release of Overcome and for Christmas.
