5|$|Large green-head ant colonies exhibit age caste polyethism, {{where the}} <b>younger</b> <b>workers</b> act as nurses {{and tend to}} the brood and the older workers go out and forage. In smaller colonies, age caste polyethism does not occur, with nursing and {{foraging}} initiated by both younger and older workers. These results show that ageing is not the mechanism that drives labour among colonies. The emergence of age polyethism in larger colonies {{is a result of}} worker specialisation. Workers in small colonies usually tend to the brood much more than those in larger colonies, but {{this is due to the}} differentiated social environment between small and large societies. In contrast, old workers from large colonies forage for significant periods of time, and those in small colonies forage less. A predatory species such as the green-head ant may not be able to increase prey retrieval within its environment, even if there is a larger foraging force. This means that the workers may have to spend more time foraging to retrieve any prey item. Contact among nestmates also differs between small and large colonies, strongly suggesting that colony size regulates contact rates. Higher contact rates allow colonies to scan their environment and determine their needs more quickly, which makes a colony react faster. Task allocation patterns (referring to the way that tasks are chosen) are different in small and large colonies, which may determine the contact rate.|$|E

Findings – A definition and model of abusive leadership as experienced by <b>young</b> <b>workers</b> is proposed. The model details 11 behaviours, five moderators and six individual and two organizational outcomes of abusive leadership. Originality/value – The adoption of a constructivist grounded theory approach reveals several unique factors that moderate the relationship between behaviors and outcomes of abusive leadership in <b>young</b> <b>workers.</b> By grounding the model in the actual experiences of <b>young</b> <b>workers,</b> the paper offers possibilities for future research on abusive leadership and <b>young</b> <b>workers</b> and across demographic groups...|$|R

25|$|After {{hitting a}} {{historical}} low of 1.47 children born per female, the total fertility {{rate of the}} EU started to increase again, to reach a level of 1.60 in 2008. The positive trend was observed in all member states {{with the exception of}} Luxembourg, Malta and Portugal. The largest increases over this period were observed in Bulgaria (from 1.23 children per woman in 2003 to 1.57 in 2009), Slovenia (from 1.20 to 1.53), the Czech Republic (from 1.18 to 1.49) and Lithuania (from 1.26 to 1.55). In 2009, the Member States with the highest fertility rates were Ireland (2.06), France (2.00), Sweden (1.94), and the United Kingdom (1.90), all approaching the replacement level of 2.1 children born per female. The lowest rates were observed in Latvia (1.31), Hungary and Portugal (both 1.32) and Germany (1.36). The increasing fertility rate has also been accompanied by an upward trend in the natural increase of the population which is due to the moderate increase of the crude birth rate that reached 10.9 births per 1000 inhabitants in 2008, an increase of 0.3 compared with 2007. The increase was observed in all member countries except Germany. The EU crude death rate remained stable at 9.7 per 1000 inhabitants. The relatively low fertility rate means retirement age workers are not entirely replaced by <b>younger</b> <b>workers</b> joining the workforce. The EU faces a potential future dominated by an ever-increasing population of retired citizens, without enough <b>younger</b> <b>workers</b> to fund (via taxes) retirement programs or other state welfare agendas.|$|E

40|$|The IMF crisis {{which started}} late in 1997 caused massive {{unemployment}} in Korea. The crisis placed a high toll on <b>young</b> <b>workers,</b> especially on those at age between 25 and 29. However, {{even after the}} crisis, the high unemployment rate of <b>young</b> <b>workers</b> persisted. This study addresses the issue of high unemployment of younf workers in Kora. It argues that the Human capital theory(Becker, 1975) and Institutional Theory(Coase, 1965 North, 1996) based on the Neo-classical economic perspective can offer only limited explanations on the unemployment of <b>young</b> <b>workers</b> in Korea. But, the New institutionalism Analysis(Granovetter, 1985 Kim Hae-dong, 1995) perpective which focuses on the socio-cultural and institutional aspects provides a better explanation for high unemployment of <b>young</b> <b>workers</b> in Korea. The recently observed high unemployment of <b>young</b> <b>workers</b> is not a cyclical unemployment, which should wither away if the economy picks up. But, it is a long-trem phenomenon, which should be systematically dealt with. As a solution {{to deal with the}} current high unemployment of <b>young</b> <b>workers,</b> the study suggests improvement of the current vocational education and training system.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, governments across Canada {{have responded to}} the {{specific}} problem of workplace injuries among <b>young</b> <b>workers</b> through an increased emphasis on consciousness raising media programs, education and training. This shift in attention was motivated by research evidence on the higher rates of injuries among <b>young</b> <b>workers</b> (Breslin and Smith 2005; Breslin et al, 2007; Wegman and Davis, 1999; Salminen, 2004), the higher costs associated with compensating disabled <b>young</b> <b>workers</b> and the efforts of unions and other activists (often the parents of children killed on the job) to bring more attention to the issue. While compensation statistics in Ontario and elsewhere suggest a general decline in injury rates, including a decline among <b>young</b> <b>workers</b> (WSIB, 2007), the evidence also indicates that the drop has been slower among <b>young</b> <b>workers</b> and that they continue to have higher rates of injuries than older workers (Breslin et al., 2006 b).

25|$|A Roth 401(k) plan is {{probably}} most advantageous {{to those who}} might otherwise choose a Roth IRA, such as <b>younger</b> <b>workers</b> who are currently taxed in a lower tax bracket but expect to be taxed in a higher bracket upon reaching retirement age. Higher-income workers may prefer a traditional 401(k) plan because they are currently taxed in a higher tax bracket but would expect to be taxed at a lower rate in retirement; also, those near the Roth IRA income limits may prefer a traditional 401(k) since its pre-tax contributions lowers Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) and thus increases eligibility for various other tax incentives (Roth IRA contributions, the Child Tax Credit, medical expense deduction, etc.). Another consideration for those currently in higher tax brackets {{is the future of}} income tax rates in the US: if income tax rates increase, current taxation would be desirable for a wider group). The Roth 401(k) offers the advantage of tax free distribution but is not constrained by the same income limitations. For example, in tax year 2013, normal Roth IRA contributions are limited to $5,500 ($6,500 if age 50 or older); up to $17,500 could be contributed to a Roth 401(k) account if no other elective deferrals were taken for the tax year, such as traditional 401(k) deferrals.|$|E
25|$|Although {{workers could}} be redundant, the {{employer}} {{may still be}} liable for unfair dismissal by following an unfair procedure. The procedure the employer follows to select employees to make redundant must be procedurally fair. In Williams v Compair Maxam Ltd Browne-Wilkinson J held that the proper steps should be to (1) give all warning possible (2) consult the union (3) agree objective criteria (4) follow those criteria, and (5) always check there if there is alternative employment rather than dismissal. This meant that the managers, who had selected workers {{to lose their jobs}} based on personal preferences, had unfairly dismissed the workforce. The criteria that the employer uses must be observable, and reviewable. However, employers do not need to disclose to employees all the details of their reasoning when they select people for redundancy unless there is a specific complaint of unfairness. A last in, first out policy, as used in many collective agreements will be regarded as fair. For example, in Rolls Royce plc v Unite the Union, Rolls Royce plc challenged a collective agreement which gave extra points in a selection procedure for years of service as being unlawful discrimination against <b>younger</b> <b>workers</b> (who it wished to retain). The Court of Appeal agreed with the union that this represented a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim of rewarding seniority, particularly since older workers might find alternative employment much harder to secure. If possible, employers should attempt to redeploy redundant staff within their firm. Under ERA 1996 section 141 an employee should accept a suitable offer for redeployment, and will lose entitlement to redundancy if he or she declines it. 'Suitable' means substantially similar in terms of status, wages and types of duties. For example, in Thomas Wragg & Sons Ltd v Wood the Employment Appeal Tribunal held that it was reasonable for Mr Wood to refuse an alternative job offer the day before his termination took effect. He was therefore redundant. There is also, under section 138, a right to refuse an alternative job to which an employee is redeployed after a four-week trial period if it would be reasonable. However, redeployment remains an option for the employer that gives it greater scope to avoid redundancy payments. A right for the employee to be redeployed does not yet exist, except {{to the extent that the}} employer must consult about redeployment possibilities when more than 20 employees could be redundant.|$|E

Aim: This research aimed to include the voice of <b>young</b> <b>workers</b> and other stakeholders in the development of a strategy for action for South Australia. Methods: engagement: hearing the voice of <b>young</b> <b>workers</b> in the development of the youth work health and safety strategy. We used a mixed methods approach that included a combination of quantitative methods (online survey of young workers’ WHS knowledge) and qualitative methods (interviews, focus groups, online survey of young workers’ stories, program analysis, future inquiry workshop). We relied on snowballing and a strong social media presence to reach <b>young</b> <b>workers</b> so that we could include their voice in the research. We also heard from key stakeholders, the social partners, to canvass their opinions and ideas. We used statistics and thematic analysis to determine our findings. Results: We identified eight areas for action: the psychosocial working environment; the physical working environment; precarious work and work/life balance; fatigue; training and education of young workers; training and education of employers; the need to hear the voice of young workers; and the obstacles faced by employers. We organized these into four key strategic actions: health and well-being; education, training and skill development; engagement and participation; and better connections. Conclusion: The Strategy for Youth Work Health and Safety for South Australia was adopted by the regulator and State government and launched in November 2013. It provides a road map for collaborative change in South Australia that will potentially lead to significant improvements in youth WHS and will help achieve the goal of healthy, safe, fair and productive lives for <b>young</b> <b>workers</b> in South Australia...|$|R
