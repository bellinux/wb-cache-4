50|$|Sunfish {{stood out}} of Majuro on 15 January 1945 to patrol in the East China and <b>Yellow</b> <b>Seas.</b> However, she had to {{terminate}} the patrol on 20 February when collision with an unsighted ice floe bent both periscopes. The ship entered Apra Harbor, Guam, on 27 February, for refit and repairs.|$|R
5|$|Typhoon Mamie was {{the worst}} {{tropical}} cyclone to affect China in 26years. Originating from an area of disturbed weather near the Philippines in mid-August1985, the system gradually became better organized, and was upgraded into a tropical storm early on August16. It continued to deepen, and late on August17, Mamie attained typhoon intensity. Around this time, Typhoon Mamie reached its peak intensity of , which it maintained for 12hours. After making landfall in Shanghai, the storm steadily weakened. However, after turning north and crossing the Shanghai Peninsula and the <b>Yellow</b> <b>Sea,</b> Mamie made a second landfall near Yantai as a tropical storm. After turning northwest and re-entering the <b>Yellow</b> <b>Sea,</b> Mamie moved ashore for {{the third and final}} time near Dairen. On August21, Mamie dissipated inland over northeastern China.|$|E
5|$|On 10 August the Imperial Japanese Army, {{which had}} been slowly pushing south to Port Arthur, began {{an assault on the}} city's outer defenses. With their base now {{directly}} under attack, the First Pacific Squadron sortied in the morning, around 07:00, in an attempt to escape to Vladivostok. The Japanese fleet intercepted the Russian ships at 12:55 in what became the Battle of the <b>Yellow</b> <b>Sea.</b>|$|E
5|$|Vessels from Silla, Balhae and Hizen Province of Japan {{were all}} {{involved}} in the <b>Yellow</b> <b>Sea</b> trade, which Silla dominated. After Silla and Japan reopened renewed hostilities in the late 7th century, most Japanese maritime merchants chose to set sail from Nagasaki towards {{the mouth of the}} Huai River, the Yangzi River, and even as far south as the Hangzhou Bay in order to avoid Korean ships in the <b>Yellow</b> <b>Sea.</b> In order to sail back to Japan in 838, the Japanese embassy to China procured nine ships and sixty Korean sailors from the Korean wards of Chuzhou and Lianshui cities along the Huai River. It is also known that Chinese trade ships traveling to Japan set sail from the various ports along the coasts of Zhejiang and Fujian provinces.|$|E

5|$|Kasuga and Nisshin {{participated in}} the Battle of the <b>Yellow</b> <b>Sea</b> on 10 August, but only played a minor role {{as they were in}} the rear of the Japanese battleline. During the battle, the ship's {{executive}} officer was Kantarō Suzuki, later Prime Minister of Japan. Kasuga was not significantly damaged, although she was hit three times with 11 crewmen wounded. Kasuga fired 33 ten-inch shells along with an unknown number of eight-inch shells during the battle. After the battle the sisters returned to Pigeon Bay where they engaged the Russian fortifications.|$|E
5|$|SpongeBob is {{depicted}} as being a good-natured, optimistic, naïve, and enthusiastic <b>yellow</b> <b>sea</b> sponge residing in the undersea city of Bikini Bottom alongside an array of anthropomorphic aquatic creatures. He works as a fry cook at a local fast food restaurant, the Krusty Krab, to which he is obsessively attached. At work, SpongeBob answers to Eugene Krabs, a greedy crab who shows SpongeBob favor, alongside his ill-tempered, snobbish next-door neighbor Squidward Tentacles. His hobbies include jellyfishing, practicing karate at an elementary level, and blowing bubbles.|$|E
5|$|Studies of {{historical}} catches suggest several resident groups once {{existed in the}} North Pacific – the Baja California group and the Yellow Sea–East China Sea (including Ryukyu Islands and western Kyusyu) group. Additionally, respective groups in northern Sea of Japan and the group along Pacific coasts of Japan from Hokkaido to Sanriku might have been resident or less migratory, as well. The only modern record among Ryukyu Islands was of a rotten carcass beached on Ishigaki Island in 2005. Regarding <b>Yellow</b> <b>Sea,</b> a juvenile was accidentally killed along Boryeong in 2014.|$|E
50|$|The ship next trained {{forces for}} {{the assault on}} the Japanese homeland, but the news of Japan's {{surrender}} ended this task. Liddle transported equipment to Korea through the mine-infested waters of the East China and <b>Yellow</b> <b>Seas</b> in September 1945, evacuated prisoners of war from Dairen, Manchuria, on 5 October, and became the Port Director Ship at Taku, China, on 25 October.|$|R

5|$|The United States Army's 34th Infantry Regiment, 24th Infantry Division was {{assigned}} to delay elements of the North Korean People's Army's 4th Infantry Division as it advanced south following its victories at the Battle of Osan and the Battle of Pyongtaek the days before. The regiment emplaced {{north and south of}} Chonan attempting to delay the North Koreans in an area where the terrain formed a bottleneck between mountains and the <b>Yellow</b> <b>Sea.</b>|$|E
5|$|They {{participated in}} the Battle of the <b>Yellow</b> <b>Sea</b> on 10 August, but only played a minor role as they were {{generally}} {{in the rear of}} the Japanese battleline. For the brief amount of time when Tōgō reversed course, Nisshin was at the head of the battleline and was hit three times during the battle, losing 14 crewmen killed and 25 wounded. After the battle the sisters returned to Pigeon Bay where they engaged the Russian fortifications.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{the urging}} of his crewmen, Choe changed his clothes in a ritual fashion in {{preparation}} for death, although he prayed to the heavens to spare him and his crew, asking what sins they had committed to deserve this fate. On the sixth day, during fairer weather, their ship came upon a group of islands in the <b>Yellow</b> <b>Sea</b> where Chinese pirates were moored. The pirates robbed their ship of spare goods and rations, threw away the Koreans' oars and anchor, and left them to drift aimlessly into the sea.|$|E
50|$|Returning home, Changchun largely {{followed}} his outward route, with certain deviations, {{such as a}} visit to Hohhot. He was back in Beijing {{by the end of}} January 1224. From the narrative of his expedition, Travels to the West of Qiu Chang Chun written by his pupil and companion Li Zhichang, we derive some of the most vivid pictures ever drawn of nature and man between the Great Wall of China and Kabul, between the Aral and <b>Yellow</b> <b>Seas.</b>|$|R
50|$|The finless {{porpoise}} {{lives in the}} coastal waters of Asia, especially around Japan, Korea, China, Indonesia, Malaysia, India, and Bangladesh. Throughout their range, the porpoises stay in shallow waters, up to 50 m deep, close to the shore, in waters with soft or sandy seabeds, or in estuaries and mangrove swamps. In exceptional cases, they have been encountered as far as 135 km off-shore in the East China and <b>Yellow</b> <b>Seas,</b> albeit still in shallow water.|$|R
5000|$|China's {{stake in}} Gwadar will also {{allow it to}} expand its {{influence}} in the Indian Ocean, a vital route for oil transportation between the Atlantic and the Pacific. Another advantage to China {{is that it will}} be able to bypass the Strait of Malacca. As of now, 60 percent of China's imported oil comes from the Middle East, and 80 percent of that is transported to China through this strait, the dangerous, piracy-rife maritime route through the South China, East China, and <b>Yellow</b> <b>Seas.</b> Council on Foreign Relations ...|$|R
5|$|After {{the end of}} the Russo-Japanese War the Imperial Russian Navy was in a {{state of}} confusion. Its leadership, tactics and ship designs had all been cast into disrepute by its {{repeated}} defeats by the Japanese at the Battle of Tsushima, Battle off Ulsan and the Battle of the <b>Yellow</b> <b>Sea.</b> The Navy took quite some time to absorb the design lessons from the war while the government reformed the Naval Ministry and forced many of its more conservative officers to retire. It conducted a design contest for a dreadnought in 1906, but the Duma refused to authorize it, preferring to spend the money on rebuilding the Army.|$|E
5|$|Angel sharks {{in general}} are highly {{threatened}} by commercial trawl fisheries due to their susceptibility to capture and low rate of reproduction, and angel shark species elsewhere {{are known to have}} declined markedly under fishing pressure. Trawling activity in the <b>Yellow</b> <b>Sea</b> {{and other parts of the}} northwestern Pacific is intense and, coupled with pollution, has had a serious impact on the local ecosystem. The Japanese angelshark population is suspected to have declined by up to 50% or more under these conditions, leading the species to be assessed as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). It may benefit from a ban on trawling imposed in some areas by the Chinese government, though enforcement is inconsistent.|$|E
5|$|Before {{developing}} True Detective, Nic Pizzolatto {{worked as}} a literature professor for the University of Chicago, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and DePauw University. He also delved into fiction writing, having developed a fascination for it {{as a graduate student}} at the University of Arkansas. His first published work was the short story collection Between Here and the <b>Yellow</b> <b>Sea,</b> released in 2006. The author published his debut novel, titled Galveston, four years later, and around the same time began preparing to branch out into the television industry (earlier attempts were never realized due to lack of capital).|$|E
5000|$|Later that day, Bang {{headed for}} Hawaii {{and arrived at}} Pearl Harbor on 5 December for refit. Following a restful holiday period, the {{submarine}} departed Oahu on 2 January 1945 and set a course for Saipan. There, on 15 January, she joined with , , and [...] and sailed for a patrol area in the East China and <b>Yellow</b> <b>Seas.</b> Bad weather and a scarcity of targets denied Bang opportunities to attack any enemy shipping before she departed the area on 19 February, without any kills. She arrived at Guam on the 24th for refit alongside Proteus.|$|R
5000|$|Relief {{departed}} Saipan 7 July {{and touched}} at Guam en route San Pedro Bay, Leyte, the Philippines. She {{served as a}} Fleet Base Hospital in the Philippines {{for the remainder of}} the war. She departed Subic Bay 28 August, steaming via Okinawa for Dairen, Manchuria. Her mission was the recovery of Allied prisoners of war from the former Japanese military prison camp at Mukden, Manchuria. As she passed through the East China and <b>Yellow</b> <b>Seas,</b> [...] and [...] swept out ahead to destroy any mines that might be sighted.|$|R
500|$|After the refit, Gunnel {{was ordered}} to the Pacific Fleet, and in June 1943, went on patrol in the East China and <b>Yellow</b> <b>Seas.</b> [...] On June 15, McCain torpedoed and sank the {{freighter}} Koyo Maru (6400 tons) in the Tsushima Strait. [...] Early on June 19, McCain engaged a Japanese convoy that was headed for Shanghai. [...] He torpedoed and sank the freighter Tokiwa Maru (7000 tons) and hit a smaller vessel. [...] The convoy's escorts then staged a prolonged counter-attack on Gunnel, dropping depth charges that shook and damaged the boat and grappling hooks that rattled along its hull.|$|R
5|$|During the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05, Kasuga {{participated in}} the Battle of the <b>Yellow</b> <b>Sea</b> and was lightly damaged during the {{subsequent}} Battle of Tsushima. In addition she frequently bombarded the defenses of Port Arthur. The ship played a limited role in World War I and was used to escort Allied convoys and search for German commerce raiders in the Indian Ocean and Australasia. Kasuga became a training ship in the late 1920s and was then disarmed and hulked in 1942 {{for use as a}} barracks ship. The ship capsized shortly before the end of World War II in 1945 and was salvaged three years later and broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|During the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05, Nisshin {{participated in}} the Battle of the <b>Yellow</b> <b>Sea</b> and was damaged in the {{subsequent}} Battle of Tsushima. In addition she frequently bombarded the defenses of Port Arthur. The ship played a limited role in World War I and was used to escort Allied convoys and search for German commerce raiders in the Indian Ocean and Australasia. In 1918, Nisshin was deployed to the Mediterranean and then escorted the surrendered German submarines allocated to Japan from Britain to Japan after the war. She became a training ship in 1927 and was sunk as a target ship in 1936. Her wreck was later refloated and used as a target again in 1942.|$|E
5|$|For Asian stocks, {{resident}} {{groups may}} {{exist in the}} <b>Yellow</b> <b>Sea</b> and East China Sea, and the Sea of Japan (though these populations are critically endangered and the population off China, Korea, and Japan are either near extinction or in very small numbers). Very small increases in sightings have been confirmed off Shiretoko Peninsula, Abashiri, and Kushiro in Hokkaido, Tsushima, Sado Island, off Maiduru in the Sea of Japan since in late 2000s as whales in Sea of Okhotsk might have started recolonizing into former habitats (for coastal Sakhalin, as well). Whales possibly used to migrated into Seto Inland Sea.|$|E
5000|$|Cero cleared New London 17 August 1943 for Pacific waters, and on 26 September sailed from Pearl Harbor, {{bound for}} the East China and <b>Yellow</b> <b>Seas</b> on her first war patrol. This patrol {{was also the first}} American wolfpack, {{comprising}} Cero, , and , commanded from Cero by Captain [...] "Swede" [...] Momsen. At dawn on 12 October, Cero made her first attack, on a convoy of three freighters escorted by two destroyers; one of the merchantmen was heavily damaged. During this patrol, she damaged two other freighters, and a small patrol boat which she engaged on the surface.|$|R
