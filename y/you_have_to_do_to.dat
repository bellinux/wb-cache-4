[...] Weiner said in August 2012 that he intended for Peggy's departure from SCDP to be in [...] "The Other Woman", which is centered on Joan: [...] " [...] literally about the quantification and value {{of women in the}} workplace and the relationship of their sexuality to it. I knew that on a subconscious level at the writing stage, {{because of the way the}} stories went together. As these stories fold in together, it starts to become about that, but it was always about what <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> get ahead, in a very simple way, and the opportunities to get ahead." ...|$|E

Morrow told the state adjutant general [...] "Do as much as <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> keep that negro {{in the hands of}} the law. If he falls into the hands of the mob I do not expect to see you alive." [...] Lockett had already confessed, without the benefit of a lawyer, to the murder. His trial took only thirty minutes as he pleaded guilty but asked for a life sentence instead of death. Despite his plea, he was sentenced to die in the electric chair.|$|E
500|$|According to Lee, several core {{concepts}} {{were already}} in place from Buck and Del Vecho's early work, such as the film's [...] "frozen heart" [...] hook: [...] "That was a concept and the phrase... an act of true love will thaw a frozen heart." [...] They already knew the ending involved true love {{in the sense of}} the emotional bond between siblings, not romance, in that [...] "Anna was going to save Elsa. We didn’t know how or why." [...] Lee said Edwin Catmull, president of Disney Animation, told her early on about the film's ending: [...] "First and foremost, no matter what <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> the story, do it. But you have to earn that ending. If you do it will be great. If you don't, it will suck." ...|$|E

500|$|Several of {{the songs}} on the album drew their lyrics from real life relationships. [...] "Peachy" [...] {{documents}} the permanent breakup of a relationship that had inspired her 2004 single [...] "Ten Days". [...] "Where I Stood", which Higgins calls [...] "a pretty sad love song", describes the end of another relationship. She said it portrays [...] "one of those situations where you just feel that leaving this person is something <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> get to know yourself again." [...] "Secret" [...] was about an ex-girlfriend who was uncomfortable about going public with their relationship; [...] "I was so head over heels {{in love with her}} I kind of wanted to shout it out to the world, so it was just a song about keeping something under the covers ... keeping it away locked in a little room." ...|$|E
500|$|Lecrae {{attended}} a conference after being invited by a friend, though Lecrae admits that his interest {{was to meet}} girls and experience the big city. When {{he arrived at the}} conference, Lecrae was awed by the performance of the Christian hip-hop group The Cross Movement. Lecrae says that he saw [...] "guys who had been shot from being in gangs, girls who were extremely promiscuous in the past, I see rappers, dancers and singers; I see people who came from the same background I came from, and they still embodied who they were culturally, but they were all in love with Jesus and I had never seen that before." [...] After hearing Pastor James White of Christ Our King Community Church speak on how Christians are bought with a price and the suffering that Jesus underwent in the Crucifixion, Lecrae says that he remembers articulating [...] "God get me out of this, don't kill me; do whatever <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> get me out of this, just don't kill me." [...] Later, Lecrae was driving on a highway when he turned too quickly and his car went into a roll. He had no seatbelt and the roof and windshield of the car caved in, his glasses were molded into the frame of the car, but he survived completely uninjured. Lecrae cites this incident as the one which convinced him to commit his life to Christ. Lecrae went back to his college, the University of North Texas, with a printed version of his testimony to pass out on campus. He started volunteering and performing at a juvenile detention center, and the reception he received convinced him that offering [...] "hope and encouragement" [...] through music was what he wanted to do. However, Lecrae still struggled in his faith − as revealed in [...] "Good, Bad, Ugly", in 2002 he impregnated a then-girlfriend. Rather than risk scandal, he and his girlfriend had the baby aborted, a decision he says he now deeply regrets. In the same song, he revealed that he had been sexually abused by a babysitter as a child.|$|E

Hill left behind a manuscript manifesto which his backers promised him they would publish. Hill also encouraged others who believe abortion is an illegitimate use of lethal force to [...] "do what <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> stop it." ...|$|E
