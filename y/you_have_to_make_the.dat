You're living vicariously through me. There might be someone that [...] you just might want to put it to someday, and you can't, but you can turn on the TV and see Sheila do it, and get away with it. Being mean and evil and fighting {{and by the end of}} the day, you're spent." [...] On {{the topic of}} Sheila [...] "terrorizing" [...] both Genoa City and Los Angeles while on both soaps, Brown said: [...] "You know, I came to L.A. to start a new life. And well they just didn't make it that easy for me, did they? So I might've shot a gun once or twice again, but it wasn't my fault. You know what, people get what they deserve, they really do. I might've poisoned someone by accident, but he never should've talked to me like that. You just don't do that. Anyway, people get what they deserve, and I think a lot of them have what's coming to them, and I'm not sure I'm done yet." [...] About Sheila's personality, Brown said: [...] "Sheila's just evil. There's nothing bitchy about what she does, [...] it's very straightforward. She's manipulative but never in a bitchy way, in a way to get things accomplished, and get things done the way she wants to. When being nice and being diplomatic and when being all those things don't work any longer, she snaps." [...] On Sheila's relationship with Stephanie Forrester, Brown said: [...] "Stephanie made my life miserable. So anyway, I shot Stephanie. I did. Stephanie felt she could be a better provider for my child than I could. And you know what, you don't keep a mother like Sheila away from her child, you just don't do that. And Stephanie couldn't stop me." [...] Brown also added that, [...] "To be a good villain, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> character real for you." ...|$|E
6000|$|Now {{of these}} three methods, the last is {{undoubtedly}} the best. If you once commit the addition table thoroughly, you have it fixed for life; whereas if you do not, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> calculation over again every time, and thus lose {{a vast amount of}} labor. I have no doubt that there are some in this class who are in the habit of counting, who have ascertained that seven and eight for instance, make fifteen; by counting up from seven to fifteen, hundreds of times. Now how much better it would be, to spend a little time in fixing the fact in the mind once for all, and then when you come to the case, seven and eight are--say at once [...] "Fifteen,"--instead of mumbling over and over again, hundreds of times, [...] "Seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen." ...|$|E

"I keep {{thinking}} and thinking {{and thinking of}} that wonderful service, of the wonderful, wonderful things you said, and the wonderful choice you made of the moment to say them--when all those young lives were coming to the great serious thing in life. It was most beautifully done. At any rate, dear Bishop and Teacher, it was most beautifully begun. And now we all stand to you like creditors because you have given us {{so much that you}} owe us ever so much more. You have started us and you have to go on with us. You have broken the shell of the old church, and here we are running about with nowhere to go. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> shelter of a new church now for us, purged of errors, looking straight to God. The King of Mankind!--what a wonderful, wonderful phrase that is. It says everything. Tell us more of him and more. Count me first--not foremost, but just the little one that runs in first--among your disciples. They say you are resigning your position in the church. Of course that must be true. You are coming out of it--what did you call it?--coming out of the cracked old vessel from which you have poured the living waters. I called on Lady Ella yesterday. She did not tell me very much; I think she is a very reserved as well as a very dignified woman, but she said that you intended to go to London. In London then I suppose you will set up the first altar to the Divine King. I want to help.|$|E

You'd think butter wouldn't melt in that mouth of his; but he always gets his way; that's what riles 'em so; that and the success he's making of his mine.

5000|$|Once Covert Action was released, Meier and Shelley {{returned}} to the prototype.

Meier also opted to include a technology tree that would help to open the game to many more choices to the player as it continued, creating a non-linear experience. Meier felt players would be able to use the technology tree to adopt a style of play and from which they could use technologies to barter with the other opponents. While the game relies on established recorded history, Meier admitted he did not spend much time in research, usually only to assure the proper chronology or spellings; Shelley noted that they wanted to design for fun, not accuracy, and that [...] "Everything we needed was pretty much available in the children’s section of the library." ...|$|E
5000|$|During a {{performance}} at the Avalon Theater in Salt Lake City, Utah, on September 6, 2006, frontman Dave Elkins made the following statement before the band performed [...] "Mistakes We Knew We Were Making" [...] (transcribed from video previously posted on YouTube):I hope {{you know how much}} fun we’re having up here because of you guys. Well, this next song is a hypothetical story of a couple who falls in love; they’ve decided what they’re looking for and they find it in each other…and it’s very good, it’s very rewarding; but…well, not “but” but alongside of this, or as a result of this, an unborn baby comes into the picture before too long. And {{a lot of people have}} wondered and talked to us at shows, and I’ve seen it discussed on message boards and whatnot, and a lot of people thought this song is a story about an abortion or this song is a story stating us as pro-choice or pro-life, and that’s not necessarily the case here. What we’re looking at is the fact that as a result of this baby entering into the world, they find a love, these individuals, that’s more fulfilling and more rewarding, and more satisfying, than anything they had known up until that point. Cheering I think that it’s important that we understand that love is not always black and white like we’d like for it to be, and sometimes it’s very grey. Sometimes <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> difficult decisions. And sometimes you do have to try and fail, and fail and fail a few times before you can actually succeed and get the big picture. And I think that’s exactly what this song is really all about. And this song is called “Mistakes We Knew We Were Making.” ...|$|E
