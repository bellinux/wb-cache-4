This allowed you to suspend your doubt of the supernatural until you were so thoroughly into the story that you could accept it almost without noticing...It's not until Grady, the ghost of the former caretaker who axed to death his family, slides open the bolt of the larder door, allowing Jack to escape, that you are left with no other explanation but the supernatural.|$|E

500|$|Swift did {{not want}} any misconceptions of Beautiful Eyes as her second album and {{therefore}} partnered with the American retail company Wal-Mart to make the EP an exclusive release. The album was only made available through American Wal-Mart stores and Wal-Mart's website. Furthermore, it was made a limited release because Swift only allowed Big Machine Records to manufacture {{a certain number of}} copies of the EP. She said, [...] "I’m only letting my record company make a small amount of these. The last thing I want any of <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> is that we are putting out too many releases." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Never Learn Not to Love" [...] was {{released}} as the B-side to [...] "Bluebirds over the Mountain" [...] on December 2, 1968. The A-side reached number 61 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 33 on the UK Singles Chart. The song was later {{featured on the}} Beach Boys' album 20/20 on February 10, 1969. When Manson discovered he was uncredited on the single, he was furious and threatened Dennis Wilson with murder. Beach Boys collaborator Van Dyke Parks recalled [...] "One day, Charles Manson brought a bullet out {{and showed it to}} Dennis, who asked, 'What's this?' And Manson replied, 'It's a bullet. Every time you look at it, I want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> how nice it is your kids are still safe'". Wilson confronted Manson about the incident, realizing Manson's growing erratic behavior, and ended their friendship soon after.|$|E
500|$|Prior to the 1975 {{federal and}} state elections, Australia, and South Australia in particular, {{had been hit by}} a series of {{economic}} problems. The 1973 oil crisis had massively increased the cost of living, domestic industry began to erode {{due to a lack of}} cost-competitiveness, and government funds were waning. In response, the Dunstan Government sold loss-making railways to the Commonwealth and brought in new taxes to allow wage rises. The changes had unexpected consequences: inflation, already high, increased markedly, and workers were still displeased with wages. The LCL, now known as the Liberal Party, had rebuilt after internal schism and had modernised to make themselves more appealing to the public. Having called an early election, Dunstan appealed to the electorate and pushed blame onto the Whitlam Government for South Australia's problems. In a television address just days before the election, he said: [...] "My Government is being smeared and it hurts. They want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> we are to blame for Canberra's mistakes. The vote on Saturday is not for Canberra, not for Australia, but for South Australia." ...|$|E

500|$|The album's lead single was [...] "Moto Psycho", and a {{video was}} also made for this song. The song is about people who commute every day to work, {{spending}} a lot of time on the road. [...] "Dread and the Fugitive Mind" [...] was released on the [...] compilation a year earlier, at the insistence of Megadeth's former label, Capitol Records. The album's opener, [...] "Disconnect", is explained by Mustaine as being about living a double life and [...] "the person I want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that I am and the person inside that I really know I am." [...] "Coming Home" [...] was only available on the Japanese pressing as a bonus track, but has since been released on the Warchest box set. Mustaine has stated that concept for [...] "Promises" [...] is [...] "prejudiced relationships," [...] such as those between a Catholic and a Protestant in Ireland, interracial and same-sex relationships, [...] "it could be about a guy and a sheep for all I care. It just means that if we can't be together in this life, maybe we'll make it in the next." ...|$|E
500|$|With Barrett {{seemingly}} {{detached from}} proceedings, {{it came down}} to Waters and Wright to provide adequate material. The opening, [...] "Let There Be More Light", penned by Waters, continues the space rock approach established by Barrett. [...] "Let There Be More Light" [...] evolved from a bass riff that was part of [...] "Interstellar Overdrive". Both [...] "Remember a Day" [...] and [...] "See-Saw" [...] use the childlike approach that was established on their debut. Wright remained critical of his early contributions to the band. [...] "Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun" [...] was first performed with Barrett in 1967. The success of the track was such that it remained in their live setlist until 1973 where it appeared in a greatly extended form. Waters later performed the track during solo concerts from 1984 and later. Waters borrowed the lyrics from a book of Chinese poetry from the Tang Dynasty, like Barrett had used in [...] "Chapter 24". [...] "Corporal Clegg", is the first Pink Floyd song to address issues of war, a theme which would endure throughout the career of Waters as a songwriter for the band, culminating on the 1983 album The Final Cut. [...] "A Saucerful of Secrets" [...] was originally written as a new version of [...] "Nick's Boogie". The track is titled as four parts, on Ummagumma. A staple in the band's live set until summer 1972, a live version of the song was recorded on 27 April 1969 at the Mothers Club in Birmingham for inclusion on Ummagumma. [...] "Jugband Blues" [...] refers to Barrett's departure from the group ("It's awfully considerate of <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of me here / And I'm most obliged to you for making it clear that I'm not here"). A promotional video was recorded for the track. The band's management wanted to release the song as a single, before being vetoed by both the band and producer Norman Smith.|$|E

[...] Alonso Duralde of The Wrap said the film [...] "will doubtless tickle young fans of the toys.

2500|$|Upon its release, {{the album}} met with mixed reviews from music critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave the album a {{favorable}} review but noted that [...] "even {{a few years}} on from its 1994 release, Portrait of an American Family began to sound a little dated, especially since its Nine Inch Nails-meets-W.A.S.P.-meets-Alice Cooper formula was fully realized on Manson's follow-up album, Antichrist Superstar. Here, it's in sketch form, {{and by the end}} of the album it's clear that Warner, Manson, whatever you want to call him, needs a full canvas to truly wreak havoc." [...] Rolling Stone gave the album a negative review and said that [...] "Manson's debut [...] isn't the sharply rendered cultural critique of America he'd like <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> it is.

2500|$|In the 1978 {{edition of}} a book that {{traditionally}} promoted an unfavourable view on Harrison's work, , authors Roy Carr and Tony Tyler described Thirty Three & ⅓ as Harrison's [...] "best effort – by far" [...] since All Things Must Pass. Carr and Tyler concluded: [...] "It must be the production. For no individual track really presents itself as typifying a New Harrison Approach – and yet the impression left by the album {{as a whole is}} definitely of a more balanced, poised and devil-may-care Hari..." [...] Robert Christgau, another critic with a low regard for Harrison's music, gave Thirty Three & ⅓ the highest rating of all the ex-Beatle's solo albums thus far, with a [...] "B–". Christgau wrote, [...] "This isn't as worldly as George wants <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> – or as he thinks himself, for all I know – but it ain't fulla shit either", and he highlighted [...] "Crackerbox Palace" [...] as Harrison's best song since [...] "Here Comes the Sun".|$|E
2500|$|The {{band has}} been noted as {{influencing}} numerous groups within metal-associated genres, such as American Head Charge, Avatar, Babymetal, Combichrist, Ghost, Korn, Motionless in White, Murderdolls, Mushroomhead, New Years Day, September Mourning and Slipknot. Outside of heavy metal, both the band and its lead singer have inspired {{a diverse group of}} acts, including Avril Lavigne, Charli XCX, Die Antwoord, Eminem, Grimes, Lady Gaga, Lana Del Rey, Lil Uzi Vert, Lisa Marie Presley, Muse, My Chemical Romance, Mykki Blanco, Natalia Kills, Porcelain Black, Skrillex, Skylar Grey and Years & Years. Garbage vocalist Shirley Manson has called Manson an [...] "amazing figure and provocateur and agitator" [...] and said that he was [...] "always challenging <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about the church, to think about sexuality and to think about society in different ways. We just don't have singers like that anymore." [...] Billy Corgan of The Smashing Pumpkins has commended Manson's manipulation of the culture of celebrity, saying: [...] "He's very savvy, in that he lets people think things about him or plays into things to see what will happen, almost like a performance artist. He's a visionary in a way, because he identified a culture that was coming and now that culture is everywhere." ...|$|E
2500|$|At his {{arraignment}} at the District Court of Pittsburg County on June 4, 2002, Duty asked Judge Steven Taylor {{to enter}} a guilty plea to the murder and requested the death penalty, {{against the advice of}} his defense counsel. On October 28 of that year, Duty was deemed competent to enter the plea after court-ordered evaluations by the Carl Albert Community Mental Health Center and Eastern Oklahoma State Hospital. While testifying on his own behalf, Duty declined to present any mitigating evidence and said that he preferred death over spending a life sentence in lockdown 23 hours day. He also wrote to the prosecutor that he would kill again. Mary Wise pleaded to the court to sentence Duty to life in prison without the possibility of parole, stating: [...] "I don't believe he ought to have a choice. I think he ought to sit in that cell and face those four walls and think about what he did {{for the rest of his}} natural-born life. And I hope and pray to God that you live to be 110 years old, because that's how long I want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about what you did." [...] Judge Taylor denied her request, calling Duty a [...] "textbook case for the death penalty". Duty was initially scheduled to be executed on February 24, 2005.|$|E
