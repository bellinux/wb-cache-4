The {{feeding regime}} did not affect, in any {{clear-cut}} way, the sensory {{characteristics of the}} test <b>yoghurts.</b> However, those <b>yoghurts</b> manufactured from the TMR-fed cow milk contained more acetaldehyde and, in most cases, showed higher hardness, compared to the <b>yoghurts</b> made from milk produced by the cows kept on the traditional feeding regime...|$|R
40|$| Material and methods. Milk samples, {{collected}} {{six times}} a year at about 2 -month intervals, were assayed for density, acidity, and contents of fat, protein, and lactose. Dry matter and solid-not-fat (SNF) contents were determined, as was the protein/fat ratio. Thermal stability of the milk was assessed with alcohol tests. The <b>yoghurts</b> manufactured (test <b>yoghurts)</b> were assayed for acidity, acetaldehyde content, and hardness. The <b>yoghurts</b> were also subjected to sensory evaluation. |$|R

5|$|Besides {{farming and}} its {{associated}} industries, including making cider, cheese and <b>yoghurt,</b> and peat extraction, the county has little industry. It {{has been involved in}} the manufacture of helicopters, some heavy industries related to defence, quarrying and the mining of gravels and sands, brick-making and tile-making, and the manufacture of slippers, boots and shoes, but many of these industries have declined. Tourism {{is one of the main}} sources of income.|$|E
5|$|Dairy {{products}} such as milk, butter, ghee, <b>yoghurt,</b> buttermilk and cheese are manufactured largely from domestic cattle, though the milk of sheep, goat, yak, and buffalo is also used {{in some parts of}} the world and for gourmet products. For example, buffalo milk is used to make mozzarella in Italy and gulab jamun dessert in India, while sheep milk is used to make blue Roquefort cheese in France.|$|E
5|$|Penicillium moulds cause {{soft rot}} such as of apples, while Aspergillus moulds create patches {{on the surface}} of old bread, <b>yoghurt</b> and many other foods. Yeasts spoil sugary foods such as plums and jams, fermenting the sugars to alcohol.

40|$|The {{improvement}} of physical properties of <b>yoghurts</b> by varying casein/wRey protein The overall {{objective of this}} study was to investigate effects of variation in casein (CN) to whey protein (WP) ratios and types of exopolysaccharide (EPS) -producing starter cultures on physical properties of <b>yoghurts</b> made at 9 % and 14 % total solids during 28 days of storage at 4 °C. There are three main parts of this research: a preliminary study, a comparative study of three methods for determination of syneresis and the studies on physical properties of <b>yoghurts</b> made with various CN to WP ratios using non-EPS- or EPS-producing starter cultures. The preliminary study examined the physical properties of set <b>yoghurts</b> made at 12 % total solids with reconstituted skim milk (RSM) or RSM supplemented with 0. 5 % (w/w) of whey protein concentrate (WPC, 80 %) w/w total proteins) using non...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we {{investigated}} in detail {{the effects of the}} addition of inulins to the sensoric properties of low-fat <b>yoghurts.</b> <b>Yoghurts</b> were prepared from skimmed milk and with different concentrations of inulin (0 - 4 %). Two types of inulin with different chain length of the polymer were used. Attributes contributing to creamy mouthfeel were assessed by a trained expert panel. The analysis showed that stickiness, airiness and thickness contributed to the creamy mouthfeel of the <b>yoghurts</b> with thickness being significantly affected by the inulins. Unexpectedly, we found that inulins affected airiness and we could show that for long chain inulin an optimum was reached for airiness in the concentration range between 1. 5 % and 4 %, with an apparent optimum at 3 % and that native inulin with a shorter chain length was less effective. The results show that inulins can be used successfully to improve the creamy mouthfeel of low-fat <b>yoghurts.</b> © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
5|$|Street {{foods are}} a key element to Faislabadi cuisine. Samosas (deep fried pastry filled with {{vegetables}} or meat) topped with an onion salad and two types of chutney. There is even a square dedicated {{to them in the}} old city. Other street foods include, dahi bhale (deep fried vadas in creamy <b>yoghurt),</b> gol gappay (fried round puri filled with vegetables and topped with tamarind chutney) and vegetable or chicken pakoras. Biryani and murgh pilao rice are a speciality in Faisalabad.|$|E
5|$|Kalighat {{painting}} {{originated in}} 19th century Kolkata {{as a local}} style that reflected a variety of themes including mythology and quotidian life. The Government College of Art and Craft, founded in 1864, has been the cradle as well as workplace of eminent artists including Abanindranath Tagore, Jamini Roy, and Nandalal Bose. The art college was {{the birthplace of the}} Bengal school of art that arose as an avant garde and nationalist movement reacting against the prevalent academic art styles in the early 20th century. The Academy of Fine Arts and other art galleries hold regular art exhibitions. The city is recognised for its appreciation of Rabindra sangeet (songs written by Rabindranath Tagore) and Indian classical music, with important concerts and recitals, such as Dover Lane Music Conference, being held throughout the year; Bengali popular music, including baul folk ballads, kirtans, and Gajan festival music; and modern music, including Bengali-language adhunik songs. Since the early 1990s, new genres have emerged, including one comprising alternative folk–rock Bengali bands. Another new style, jibonmukhi gaan ("songs about life"), is based on realism. Key elements of Kolkata's cuisine include rice and a fish curry known as machher jhol, which can be accompanied by desserts such as roshogolla, sandesh, and a sweet <b>yoghurt</b> known as mishti dohi. Bengal's large repertoire of seafood dishes includes various preparations of ilish, a fish that is a favourite among Calcuttans. Street foods such as beguni (fried battered eggplant slices), kati roll (flatbread roll with vegetable or chicken, mutton, or egg stuffing), phuchka (a deep-fried crêpe with tamarind sauce) and Indian Chinese cuisine from Chinatown are popular.|$|E
5|$|The cuisine of Rwanda {{is based}} on local staple foods {{produced}} by subsistence agriculture such as bananas, plantains (known as ibitoke), pulses, sweet potatoes, beans, and cassava (manioc). Many Rwandans do not eat meat {{more than a few}} times a month. For those who live near lakes and have access to fish, tilapia is popular. The potato, thought to have been introduced to Rwanda by German and Belgian colonialists, is very popular. Ubugari (or umutsima) is a paste made from cassava or maize and water to form a porridge-like consistency that is eaten throughout the African Great Lakes. Isombe is made from mashed cassava leaves and served with dried fish. Lunch is usually a buffet known as mélange, consisting of the above staples and sometimes meat. Brochettes are the most popular food when eating out in the evening, usually made from goat but sometimes tripe, beef, or fish. In rural areas, many bars have a brochette seller responsible for tending and slaughtering the goats, skewering and barbecuing the meat, and serving it with grilled bananas. Milk, particularly in a fermented <b>yoghurt</b> form called ikivuguto, is a common drink throughout the country. Other drinks include a traditional beer called urwagwa, made from sorghum or bananas, which features in traditional rituals and ceremonies. The major drinks manufacturer in Rwanda is Bralirwa, which was established in the 1950s and is now listed on the Rwandan Stock Exchange. Bralirwa manufactures soft drink products from The Coca-Cola Company, under license, including Coca-Cola, Fanta, and Sprite, and a range of beers including Primus, Mützig, Amstel, and Turbo King. In 2009 a new brewery, Brasseries des Mille Collines (BMC) opened, manufacturing Skol beer and a local version known as Skol Gatanu; BMC is now owned by Belgian company Unibra. East African Breweries also operate in the country, importing Guinness, Tusker, and Bell, as well as whisky and spirits.|$|E

40|$|Protein-enriched micro-gels of {{different}} morphologies {{were incorporated into}} stirred <b>yoghurts.</b> Resulting sensory and rheological properties were investigated. An experimental design was defined with two factors (micro-gel shape and concentration). Four different shapes were designed and three micro-gel concentrations were used (2. 5, 5, 10 wt%). A Flash profile with experienced assessors was performed in combination with instrumental measurements {{in an attempt to}} relate the added micro-gel shape and concentration to sensory perception. The most important attributes to explain the texture of the micro-gels-enriched stirred <b>yoghurts</b> were consistency and graininess, which could then be associated to structural parameters. It has been shown that an increase in particle lengths and widths gave rise to a visual or mouthfeel grainy perception whereas the presence of entangled micro-gels contributed to instrumental and sensory consistency. Therefore, the sensory properties of micro-gels-enriched stirred <b>yoghurts</b> could clearly be distinguished depending on the characteristics of the added particles...|$|R

40|$|Goat’s {{milk can}} be enriched with {{magnesium}} {{in the form}} of chloride before pasteurization with a save dose, i. e. 20 mg of magnesium for 100 g of milk. Higher doses of magnesium can lead to coagulation of proteins since together with the increase of the dose of fortification there increases general acidity while pH of milk decreases. Together with the increase of the dose of fortification of <b>yoghurts</b> with magnesium there was shown an essential proportional increase of acidity and hardness of curds persisting for 21 days of storage. Enriching goat’s milk <b>yoghurts</b> with magnesium decreased the intensity of „goat” smell and aftertaste and did not cause a change in colour. The most favourable solution is the production of goat’s milk <b>yoghurts</b> enriched with 10 - 20 mg of magnesium {{in the form of}} magnesium chloride. Such doses of enrichment caused successive lowering of perceptibility of „goat” aftertaste and smell together with extension of storage time...|$|R

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} the supplementation of total dietary fiber from apple, banana or passion fruit processing by-products on the post-acidification, total titratable acidity, bacteria counts and fatty acid profiles in skim milk <b>yoghurts</b> co-fermented by four different probiotics strains: Lactobacillus acidophilus L 10 and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BL 04, HN 019 and B 94. Apple and banana fibers increased the probiotic viability during shelf-life. All the fibers were able to increase the short chain and polyunsaturated fatty acid contents of <b>yoghurts</b> compared to their respective controls. A synergistic effect between the type of fiber and the probiotic strain on the conjugated linoleic acid content was observed, and the amount of alpha-linolenic acid was increased by banana fiber. The results of this study demonstrate, for the first time, that fruit fibers can improve the fatty acid profile of probiotic <b>yoghurts</b> and point out the suitability of using fibers from fruit processing the by-products to develop new high value-added fermented dairy products.

25|$|In Indian religion, late Vedic rituals {{developed}} {{involving the}} anointing of government officials, worshippers, and idols. These are {{now known as}} abhisheka. The practice spread to Indian Buddhists. In modern Hinduism and Jainism, anointment is common, although the practice typically employs water or <b>yoghurt,</b> milk, or (particularly) butter from the holy cow, rather than oil. Many devotees are anointed {{as an act of}} consecration or blessing at every stage of life, with rituals accompanying birthing, educational enrollments, religious initiations, and death. New buildings, houses, and ritual instruments are anointed, and some idols are anointed daily. Particular care is taken in such rituals to the direction of the smearing. People are anointed from head to foot, downwards. The water may derive from one of the holy rivers or be scented with saffron, turmeric, or flower infusions; the waste water produced when cleaning certain idols or when writing certain verses of scripture may also be used. Ointments may include ashes, clay, powdered sandalwood, or herbal pastes.|$|E
25|$|In Tamil Nadu, a plain rice porridge, or {{the thick}} {{supernatant}} water from overcooked rice, {{is known as}} kanji. Kanji or Congee is also prepared with different grains available {{in different parts of}} Tamil Nadu, for example minor millet or pearl millet, finger millet, broken wheat, maize.The people of Kerala also call this preparation of rice in a watery state kanji, and it is eaten as a porridge with green lentils or chutney. Kanji is prepared with rice or ragi. Nuts and spices are added to the kanji depending on the economic status or health requirements. Rice kanji is prepared by boiling rice in large amounts of water. To this preparation, either milk and sugar (usually jaggery) or curd (<b>yoghurt)</b> and salt are added. Ragi kanji is prepared by drying ragi sprouts in shade, and then grinding them into a smooth powder. This powder is added to water and cooked. Milk and brown sugar are added to this cooked preparation for taste. Ragi kanji can be given to infants after six months. Another kanji preparation uses jevvarisi (sago in English, sabudana in Hindi) in kanji. Sago is dry roasted and powdered with/ without sugar. Powdered sago is boiled in water until cooked. This is eaten by all ages from adults to infants as young as three months.|$|E

40|$|Purpose The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} older people’s perceptions, across eight European countries (the UK, Denmark, Germany, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Italy), towards functional foods. Design/methodology/approach The repertory grid method was used to elicit reasons underlying preferences of five <b>yoghurts</b> with different functional properties and two conventional ones. Findings Familiarity was the key driver in products’ separation. For the Italian case, as well as the Spanish, Portuguese, Danish and Swedish the first principal axis could be interpreted as novel-common axis, whilst it was not in the UK, Germany and Poland. Research limitations/implications Behavioural intention to buy functional <b>yoghurts</b> was more strongly predicted and moderated by single item perceived need (PN) than single item affective and/or cognitive attitude (AA, CA), even though PN, AA and CA could be consistently assessed within the same latent measure (in all countries but Denmark). Nevertheless, beliefs/attitudes towards a novel category of products such as functional foods may be reasonably keeping moving. Originality/value In this study, preference instructions pertaining to beneficial and imagery attributes, revealed idiosyncratic properties associated with functional <b>yoghurts</b> across eight European samples of older people. </p...|$|R
