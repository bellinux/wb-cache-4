Eia and Kauwā's other four children were named Naʻea, Iʻahuʻula, Kahele and Kaikumoku.|$|E

Men are more likely to develop Guillain–Barré syndrome than women; the relative risk for men is 1.78 compared to women.|$|E

5|$|Urine {{catecholamine}} level can be elevated in pre-clinical neuroblastoma. Screening asymptomatic infants {{at three}} weeks, six months, and one <b>year</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> performed in Japan, Canada, Austria and Germany since the 1980s. Japan began screening six-month-olds for neuroblastoma via {{analysis of the}} levels of homovanillic acid and vanilmandelic acid in 1984. Screening was halted in 2004 after studies in Canada and Germany showed no reduction in deaths due to neuroblastoma, but rather caused an increase in diagnoses that would have disappeared without treatment, subjecting those infants to unnecessary surgery and chemotherapy.|$|E
5|$|In 1909, {{dermatologist}} Frederick Parkes Weber {{wrote an}} article about von Recklinghausen disease in the British Journal of Dermatology. erroneously citing Merrick {{as an example of}} the disease, which German pathologist Friedrich Daniel von Recklinghausen had described in 1882, but in the last <b>year</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> found that this conjecture was wrong. In fact, symptoms that are always present in this genetic disorder include tumours of the nervous tissue and bones, small warty growths on the skin, and (which is a peculiar characteristic of this disease) the presence of light brown pigmentation on the skin called café au lait spots.; however, these spots were never observed on Merrick's body. For this reason, although this diagnosis was quite popular through most of the 20th century, other conjectural diagnosis were advanced, such as those of who suffer Maffucci syndrome and polyostotic fibrous dysplasia (Albright's disease).|$|E

25|$|Paganism's public rituals are {{generally}} calendrical, although the pre-Christian festivals that Pagans {{use as a}} basis varied across Europe.

Common Pagan festivals include those marking the summer solstice and winter solstice as well as the start of spring and the harvest. In Wicca, a Wheel of the <b>Year</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> developed which typically involves eight seasonal festivals.|$|E
25|$|Few {{details of}} Heywood's life have been {{documented}} with certainty.

Ebola may also occur in the breast milk of women after recovery, and it is not known when it is safe to breastfeed again. The virus was also found in the eye of one patient in 2014, two months after it was cleared from his blood. Otherwise, people who have recovered are not infectious.|$|E
25|$|While {{little is}} known with {{certainty}} about his life, {{he may have been}} associated with the French royal court, since he wrote at least one motet for them. Most likely he lived and worked in Paris, based on evidence of his print editions, which were prepared there. Since later in his career he set verse by Huguenot poet Guillaume Guéroult, as well as Clément Marot, he may have either become a Protestant or had Protestant sympathies; this could explain his disappearance from Paris around 1570. If he did leave the city then, his destination is unknown. No record of him after that <b>year</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> found.|$|E
25|$|The African Footballer of the Year award, {{presented}} to the best African footballer each <b>year,</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> conferred by the Confederation of African Football (CAF) since 1992. An earlier African Footballer of the Year Golden Ball award was given out between 1970 and 1994 by France Football magazine. The changes resulted in parallel Golden Ball awards given out to Abedi Pele and George Weah in 1993 and 1994 by the magazine although the CAF sponsored awards for those years were won respectively by Rashidi Yekini and Emmanuel Amuneke, {{as well as two}} awards given to Abedi Pelé in 1992. France Football discontinued the election from 1995 after the European Ballon d'Or – also awarded by the magazine – had been opened to all players in the European leagues.|$|E

25|$|For over a {{thousand}} years {{the basis of the}} economy in the North York Moors was agriculture. The rural scene, which attracts millions of visitors to the park each <b>year,</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> formed and maintained by generations of farmers. The 1996 Agricultural Census recorded a total workforce of 2,913 employed on 1,342 working farms. Sheep and cattle provide the prime source of farm income. The dale farms have rights to graze sheep on the open moor. The rights to moorland grazing are often essential to the economic viability of a farm. In recent years agriculture in Britain has suffered economic setbacks and the viability of hill farming has become questionable. A number of environmental schemes to improve farm incomes have been devised but the industry continues to decline.|$|E
25|$|Except for the {{subspecies}} bianchii {{which is}} largely all-year resident, and subspecies excubitor in the temperate European parts of its range with their mild maritime climate, {{the species is}} a short-distance migrant. The migrations are triggered by scarcity of food and therefore, according to prey population levels, the winter range might little extend south beyond the breeding range, or be entirely parapatric to it. The populations of the Central Asian mountains mostly migrate downslope rather than southwards. Females {{are more prone to}} migration than males; they do not appear to migrate, on average, longer or shorter distances than males, and consequently are the dominant sex {{in many parts of the}} winter range. Birds leave for winter quarters a more or less short time after breeding – July to October, with most birds staying to September – and return to nest mainly in March/April, but some only arrive in May. In recent decades, the number of birds remaining on the breeding grounds all <b>year</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> noted to increase e.g. in Fennoscandia, whereas for example borealis seems to be as rare a winter visitor in northern Ohio as it was a century ago.|$|E
