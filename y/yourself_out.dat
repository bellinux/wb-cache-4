500|$|A new visual for the song, {{directed}} by Sophia Peer, was shot on December 2 {{of that year}} in Franklin, Tennessee. Peer stated that she wanted the video to [...] "reflect" [...] the message she retained from the song—"you had to push <b>yourself</b> <b>out</b> of your comfort zone and challenge yourself". She began by brainstorming ideas for the visual, and she talked to Alexandra Young and the video's editor Winston Case, who suggested her the concept of breaking world records. Peer selected 30 records for the band to break, nonetheless, they reduced the number due to the short length of the video shoot. The records selected were picked to match [...] "different sections of the song" [...] and were based on other already-existent records.|$|E
500|$|Virginia Tech quarterback Marcus Vick was {{considered}} the key player for the Virginia Tech offense heading into the Gator Bowl. The younger brother of first-overall NFL Draft pick Michael Vick—who also played for Tech—Marcus {{led the league in}} passing efficiency (141.6rating), completed 166 of 268passes (60.3percent) for 2,190yards and 15touchdowns, with ten interceptions. On the ground, he ran for 370yards and six touchdowns. Prior to the Gator Bowl, he pledged that he would return for another season at Virginia Tech before entering the NFL draft. [...] "The NFL is tough. It's the real deal. You've got to be ready for it. You just don't want to rush into just throwing <b>yourself</b> <b>out</b> there because of the money or anything like that. You've got to really be prepared for it", he said.|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} Tom Haverford also undergoes {{changes during}} the final episodes of the season, in which the character begins to consider leaving his city hall position to pursue his own business ambitions. The storyline is advanced particularly strongly in [...] "The Bubble", when Tom becomes frustrated with an assignment by Chris, and culminates in the season finale [...] "Li'l Sebastian", in which he ultimately quits the parks department to form an entertainment company. [...] "Li'l Sebastian" [...] ends with several cliffhanger twists including Tom's departure from city hall, Leslie being approached to run for office, {{and the arrival of}} Ron's first ex-wife Tammy, although the actress who will play her was not revealed. Schur said the writing staff had a general idea of where the newly introduced storylines should go, but the exact stories had not been completely worked out yet when the episodes broadcast. Schur said they sought to [...] "write the juiciest, most exciting cliffhanger-y possible scenario you can write, and then you have all summer {{to figure out how to}} get <b>yourself</b> <b>out</b> of it".|$|E
500|$|The final {{few minutes}} of [...] "Li'l Sebastian" [...] {{introduced}} major developments for several of the characters, including Leslie being approached with the idea to run for elected office, {{which has been a}} lifelong dream for her. Additionally, Tom decides to leave city hall to pursue his entrepreneurial ambitions, a progression of his character that had been building throughout the third season. Series co-creator Michael Schur said he believes characters should change and their situations should change throughout the season, so he wanted them to be in a very different place {{at the end of the}} season than where they were from the beginning. Schur also described his fellow co-creator Greg Daniels' theory about finale episode as: [...] "write the juiciest, most exciting cliffhanger-y possible scenario you can write, and then you have all summer to figure out how to get <b>yourself</b> <b>out</b> of it". Although Schur said the writing staff had a general idea of where the newly introduced storylines should go, the exact stories had not been completely worked out yet and the writers would be brainstorming how to handle them over the summer.|$|E
500|$|Feeder {{returned}} to the studio to record their fifth album Pushing the Senses. The album was seen by Grant as more of an extension to Comfort in Sound, as it focused on the same lyrical themes and musical styles, and also said that it had more of an organic sound, with more upbeat tracks added into the mix. It also seen a number of piano driven tracks, with [...] "Frequency" [...] being an example. [...] "Frequency" [...] was produced by Coldplay producer Ken Nelson, while {{for the rest of}} the album, Gil Norton was on production duties. Grant told Kerrang! in May 2004, [...] "I've done some recording on my own in a little studio up by where I live in North London. I demo the album in its full form before the rest of the band play on it. Its difficult to know at this stage what it will turn out like, but so far its slightly more mature sounding". Grant later added [...] "Each album is a journey and a reflection of the past, there is some stuff that touches on what has happened, but there are songs about love, songs of loss and songs about the future. I don't want to give too much away but there's one track called [...] "Bitter Glass". Its quite dark but uplifting too. Its about pulling <b>yourself</b> <b>out</b> of a big hole".|$|E

500|$|In mid-2010, {{the entire}} group were in Los Angeles for a birthday, where Manson {{suggested}} they book a studio and spend time writing. Along with Garbage's long time engineer and Manson's husband Billy Bush, the band, as Bush described, [...] "hung out for a couple weeks, drank some wine and played a bunch of music”. Three or four song ideas came together during this time. [...] "But we didn't go right into making-a-record mode", Erikson recalled. [...] "It took {{a bit of time}} for us to realize {{that we were going to}} make an album." [...] Erikson described reconvening as a piecemeal process, saying that it informally began with the first phone conversations among them since their hiatus, as they discussed playing together again. After convening, and composing and performing song ideas together through multiple sessions, they then decided to move forward with the band and embark on a full-length album. The project took off in February 2011, when Manson called Vig proposing to reunite the band and try making a new record. Manson convoked the group out of an eagerness [...] "to make loud music again". [...] "I'm a loud person", she proclaimed; [...] "I love noise and aggression. I crave contact. I needed to make that connection again. I think we all did. To get something back up when there was absolutely no momentum took a Herculean effort on everybody's part. It's like pulling <b>yourself</b> <b>out</b> of mud. Even to stand back up and say 'we're going to take another swing at this' was a scary feeling, and I'm proud of us for trying. It's much easier to stay at home.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Bryant {{established}} {{a reputation for}} taking shots in the closing moments of tight games, even amid double or triple teams, and has been noted as {{being one of the}} premier closers in the NBA. In an annual survey of NBA general managers, he was selected in 2012 for the 10th consecutive season as the player they most wanted taking the shot with the game on the line. Bryant enjoys being the villain, and revels in being booed and silencing the crowd with his play. His ability to make difficult shots has also drawn criticism of his shot selection. Throughout his career, he has been disparaged for being a selfish high-volume shooter; he has missed more field goal attempts in his career than any other player in NBA history. Phil Jackson states that Bryant [...] "tends to force the action, especially when the game isn't going his way. When his shot is off, Kobe will pound away relentlessly until his luck turns." [...] According to Bryant, [...] "I would go 0 for 30 before I would go 0 for 9; 0 for 9 means you beat yourself, you psyched <b>yourself</b> <b>out</b> of the game." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pushing the Senses {{contains}} {{music in}} the same rock styles featured on Feeder's 2002 album Comfort in Sound, but it focuses more on pianos, rather than a string orchestra. Only [...] "Pain on Pain" [...] on the album mainly used strings, including samples from a mellotron. Frontman Grant Nicholas {{said he did not}} think the album needed them. He also called the album the band's [...] "Recovery album" [...] as he felt he was more at ease writing the songs than he was with Comfort in Sound, after the loss of their drummer Jon Lee, alongside stating that he was inspired by artists such as John Lennon within the piano playing and writing the songs. Grant told Kerrang! in May 2004, [...] "I've done some recording on my own in a little studio up by where I live in North London. I demo the album in its full form before the rest of the band play on it. It's difficult to know at this stage what it will turn out like, but so far its slightly more mature sounding".
