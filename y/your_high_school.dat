30|$|Qualifications are {{collected}} on the census form using three questions. First, {{there is a question}} that asks, ‘What is <b>your</b> <b>highest</b> secondary <b>school</b> qualification?’ and only allows categorical responses. Next, individuals are asked, ‘Apart from secondary school qualifications, do you have another completed qualification?’, and respondents can check either ‘yes’ or ‘no’. If they check yes, they are then asked, ‘Print <b>your</b> <b>highest</b> qualification, and the main subject’. Individuals are only coded as ‘not included elsewhere’ if they respond ‘yes’ to the question about further qualifications and then give a response to the write-in question that Statistics New Zealand cannot categorise into a standard post-secondary level (or they leave it blank). Hence, we are fairly certain that they have some post-secondary qualification. Among the NZ-born in the analysis sample, 5.4  % have qualifications that are ‘not elsewhere included’, while this is the case for 6.3  % of immigrants. Excluding these individuals entirely leads to a large increase in the average level of overeducation among migrants relative to natives, but our main finding that, further controlling for differences in education levels (at a very aggregate level) between migrants and natives reduces the relative difference in overeducation seen for migrants, is unaffected by this change. These results are included in an unpublished appendix, which is available upon request.|$|R
