2500|$|According to Julian Tudor Hart, {{before the}} mid-1960s poor {{conditions}} and low expectations existed as GPs were taught entirely by specialists in hospitals; back then GPs were {{men who had}} failed to become specialists and were unable {{to work in a}} hospital. Or as Lord Moran wrote in 1966: [...] "I was dean of St. Mary’s Hospital [...] for 25 years.[...] all the people of outstanding merit, with few exceptions, aimed to get on the staff. There was no other aim, and it was a ladder off which some of them fell. How can <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> people who get {{to the top of the}} ladder are the same as the people who fall off it? It seems to me so ludicrous." ...|$|E
2500|$|The main thesis was Mrs. Von Harbou's, but I am {{at least}} 50 percent {{responsible}} because I did it. I {{was not so}} politically minded in those days as I am now. You cannot make a social-conscious picture in which <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> intermediary between the hand and the brain is the heart. I mean, that's a fairy tale– definitely. But I {{was very interested in}} machines. Anyway, I didn't like the picture– thought it was silly and stupid– then, when I saw the astronauts: what else are they but part of a machine? It's very hard to talk about pictures—should I say now that I like Metropolis because something I have seen in my imagination comes true, when I detested it after it was finished? ...|$|E

5000|$|What are <b>you</b> <b>saying</b> when <b>you</b> {{mention the}} {{fundraising}} scandals or <b>the</b> fundraising charges <b>that</b> involve Vice President Gore? What are <b>you</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> voters should take from that that's {{relevant to this}} election? ...|$|R
6000|$|CLEAVER. [Rising] <b>You</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> on <b>the</b> {{morning of}} the forgery the {{prisoner}} was jumpy. Well, now, sir, what precisely {{do you mean by}} that word? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You don't {{know the}} gentlemen here? You have not {{exchanged}} a syllable {{with one of}} them? Will <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> of <b>the</b> master of the house!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, it {{was your}} turn, Lieutenant Glover. You have come back three times more or less {{severely}} hurt already. <b>You</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> brigantine is fast?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{was still}} {{all of the}} next day," [...] said Sir Harry. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{prisoner}} was never out of your sight on that day too?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you, count. It {{is but a}} small clue {{with which}} to {{commence}} my search, but {{it is at least}} something. <b>You</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> palace itself has been searched?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm not {{a lovely}} being. How can <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>that,</b> at <b>the</b> very moment when I'm asking such odious questions? I must seem to you delicate!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{how dare}} <b>you,</b> then, <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> man is my friend?" [...] said the Captain, {{knitting}} his brows {{in a most}} formidable manner.|$|R
6000|$|... "Something handsome!" [...] I cried. [...] "But, Eveleth, haven't I heard <b>you</b> <b>say</b> {{yourself}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{growth of}} interest from dead money was like--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's a {{nice way}} for a baptized Christian to talk," [...] said Barbara, adding, [...] "But Jeekie, {{what do you mean}} when <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> god did not take you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{never saw}} you behind a plow, Uncle Randolph," [...] {{answered}} Tom, with {{a twinkle in}} his blue eyes. [...] "Besides, I heard <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> farm ran behind last year." ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{some may}} answer, 'How can <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Holy Spirit teaches the {{children}} their Duty, {{when it is}} their schoolmaster, or their father, who teaches them the Ten Commandments and the Catechism?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good!" [...] Staunton declared. [...] "One more question. <b>You</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> on <b>the</b> {{committee}} of the Rifle Club was a German officer. Do you know who he was?" ...|$|R
6000|$|A light here {{began to}} break upon Glossin's {{confusion}} of ideas. 'Did <b>you</b> not <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> younker, as <b>you</b> call him, {{goes by the name}} of Brown?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So attentively, {{and with}} so much {{confidence}} in what <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> <b>that</b> for <b>the</b> moment I lose sight," [...] touching {{the back of the}} Doctor's chair, [...] "even of this distress." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Exactly. There {{was evidently}} some mark, some thumbprint, {{something}} which might give {{a clue to}} the person's identity. Now. Mrs. Warren, <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> man was of middle size, dark, and bearded. What age would he be?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{have heard}} you," [...] said Meyer, when Mr. Clifford had {{finished}} translating, [...] "and {{we wish to}} ask you a question. What do you mean when <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Spirit of the white woman has been seen?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Say, I'm {{not quite}} sure I follow you," [...] Mr. Bundercombe observed. [...] "I am with you all right when <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> direct pecuniary payment for being in Parliament doesn't amount to anything; but what's your pull worth, eh?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, then, for {{the good}} of the family. Can <b>you</b> <b>say</b> {{positively}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> man who came here to your master was Talbot, or that he was not?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And now <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> <b>that</b> at <b>the</b> wedding, the {{prisoner}} promised {{in a day}} or two to meet the same boys at Mrs. Mulready's, to settle their plans of ridding the country of Ussher?" ...|$|R
60|$|Sir John. Millisent, <b>say</b> <b>you?</b> <b>That's</b> <b>the</b> {{name of my}} mistress.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why do <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> general {{would hardly}} {{be able to do}} anythin' of the kind?" [...] I asked. [...] "Surely to one so high in command Brant would listen, when he might refuse even to speak with one of less rank." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You die!" [...] said Almayer, contemptuously. [...] "Oh, no! You shall {{live a life}} of {{lies and}} {{deception}} till some other vagabond comes along to sing; how did <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>that?</b> <b>The</b> song of love to you! Make up your mind quickly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That {{it is my}} fault. Before our marriage, you and {{she were}} {{the whole world to}} each other; but since I came, I have seen, as <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> craving for work was strong, and I fear it actuates her more than she knows.' ...|$|E
5000|$|According to Computer Gaming World, {{the game}} was [...] "a decent attempt for an immitative product, but <b>you</b> might <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> effort to {{catch-up}} and cash-in on id Software's success was doomed from the beginning".|$|R
6000|$|... "Six out and six back. Nothing simpler. <b>You</b> <b>say</b> {{yourself}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{horse was}} fresh and glossy {{when you got}} in. How {{could it be that}} if it had gone twelve miles over heavy roads?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To be sure," [...] said I,--"to be sure. By the bye, Monsieur, did I {{understand}} <b>you</b> to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> system <b>you</b> have adopted, {{in place}} of the celebrated soothing system, was one of very rigorous severity?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I {{take it up}} I must {{understand}} every detail," [...] said he. [...] "Take time to consider. The smallest point {{may be the most}} essential. <b>You</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> man came ten days ago and paid you for a fortnight's board and lodging?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wait awhile, Queen," [...] said Olfan, who {{appeared}} utterly overcome. [...] "If I understand you right, your husband lives, and therefore <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> words {{which we have}} spoken and the oaths that we have sworn mean nothing, for you are not my wife." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "O my dear!" [...] exclaimed his wife, [...] "You don't mean {{anything}} so abominable as that! I've heard <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> worst thing about fiction and the theatre {{was that they}} brought emotions into play {{that ought to be}} sacred to real occasions." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Enough so {{as often}} {{to make me}} feel ashamed of myself. She has an {{excellent}} mother, Mordaunt; and I have heard <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> often, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> mother would have great influence with you in choosing a wife." ...|$|R
60|$|THE CLERK. What did you expect? You {{told them}} our gallant fellows is falling {{at the rate}} of a {{thousand}} a day in the big push. Dying for Little Pifflington, <b>you</b> <b>says.</b> Come and take their places, <b>you</b> <b>says.</b> <b>That</b> ain't <b>the</b> way to recruit.|$|R
6000|$|... "The younger chief {{pleaded for}} <b>you,</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Mitche Manitou had {{stricken}} you with madness, {{as could be}} seen by your swimming to their canoe, and that a blight would fall upon the nation if you were led to the stake. But this Bastard said that love came often like madness among <b>the</b> pale-faces, and <b>that</b> it was that alone which had driven you. Then {{it was agreed that}} you should die and that she should go to his wigwam, since he had led the war-party. As for me, their hearts were bitter against me, and I also am to die by the pine splinters." ...|$|R
