The High Performance version came with a larger diameter <b>Y</b> <b>pipe,</b> and was only installed {{in some of the}} S-10 Blazers and S-15 Jimmys as well as the S-10 Pickups ...|$|E

A group of young athletes, mostly from Arecibo, like: Manuel Gilberto (Petaca) Iguina, Quicón Iguina, Abdiel de la Rosa, Alberto Renta, Joaquín Balaguer, Armando Villamil, <b>y</b> <b>Pipe</b> Beníquez showed {{themselves}} {{to be a part}} of it and dominated the sport in Puerto Rico, finishing in second place.|$|E
40|$|Low water {{pressure}} always {{happens at the}} highland area. During peak hours, consumers always have this problem, especially at the end user of the water transmission. With the technology that we have today, this problem can be solved easily. In most cases this problems are solved by using pumps. This project describes a new design of a {{water pressure}} increasing device {{for the use of}} the end user. The device enables the water pressure to be increased during low water pressure condition. This project also focuses on the water transmission aspects such as the pipe design and size that is used for the water distribution system. This project uses a basic vacuum concept in science; creating a low water pressure area which will suck the water. An air compressor is used in this project to give a force to push the water in order to increase the water flow. As to connect between the pipeline transmission and the air compressor, the designs of the <b>Y</b> junction <b>pipe</b> involved. The <b>Y</b> junction <b>pipe</b> is designed with variable diameter of pipe size to see the effect in flow rate and pressure of the water. Flow meter and pressure gauge were been deployed in this project to measure the value of the flow rate and pressure of the water as the <b>Y</b> junction <b>pipe</b> is connected to the water pipeline. All the measured values will be placed in a database system to give users full access to use it and to interact with the measured data...|$|R
40|$|Non-destructive {{testing of}} piping in {{operation}} is an urgent task, requiring {{development of new}} methods of control, oriented to the current condition of the plants. Control of welded joints in this respect is an area, which is relatively well-developed and specified in detail. As regards control of the <b>pipe</b> <b>y,</b> i. e. sections between welds, ability to control them is limited, in view of their large extent and presence of various anticorrosion and insulation coatings...|$|R
40|$|The Tribag breccia pipes, {{located near}} the eastern {{extremity}} of Lake Superior, are associated with Keweenawan felsic intrusions and have yielded a K-Ar age of 1, 055 _ 35 m. <b>y.</b> The <b>pipes</b> cut Archean diabase and greenstones {{but in terms of}} regional setting exhibit a relationship to Keweenawan rifting. Four major breccia pipes occur in the district. Three contain large tonnages of disseminated subeconomic Cu and Cu-Mo mineralization, but only two have supported mining. That pro-duction amounted to 16, 000 metric tons of copper from relatively high grade ore associated with domal fractures within the two pipes. The pipes contain mainly angular fragments of the surrounding metavolcanic and granitic country rocks and exhibit sharp contacts. Hydrothermal lteration within the pipes is restricted to the vicinity of fractures and orebodies but becomes more pervasive downward. Mineralization of the pipes can be divided into four periods, each marked by somewhat distinctive mineral assemblages and ore fluid characteristics. Period 1 resulted in formation of disseminated chal-copyrite-molybdenite sulfides associated with magnetite, pyrite, epidote, and quartz. Flui...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} study the {{internal}} gas flow of <b>Y</b> type branch <b>pipes</b> in the exhaust ventilation conditions, the branch pipe is simulated by using FLUENT software. Combined with experimental results, comparatively analyze exhaust ventilation pressure, velocity and vortex flow of the branch pipe. The results show that simulation and experimental data consistent overall trend, the difference is less than 8 %, the main entrance pressure of the branch pipeline decreases with {{the width of the}} leakage increasing, leakage width of 0 mm, 1 mm, 2 mm cases, there is vortex tube, and valve and the main ventilation pipe case gas exchange occurs when no leakage, this study provides a theoretical and practical basis for further analysis of branch pipe exhaust ventilation...|$|R
