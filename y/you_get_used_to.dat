Something happens sometimes with string instruments—violin, viola, cello—where the first moment you listen to the sound of this instrument, the first feeling is a bit strange sometimes. But after just a few minutes, when <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>used</b> <b>to,</b> when you become friends with this kind of sound, then the sound becomes a magical quality. This was Callas.|$|E

500|$|His form in {{the tour}} to the West Indies in March and April 2004 was mixed. After several low scores in the Test series—Trescothick started with only 20 runs from his first five innings—he reached two half-centuries, but failed to make a {{substantial}} match-winning contribution. This poor touring form {{may have been the}} start of the troubles that would rule him out of international cricket in the future. Trescothick said, [...] "The hardest thing for me has been the pitches. So far nets and the matches have been on average surfaces and runs have been hard work...In England <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> good practice surfaces so the rhythm of batting comes pretty easy [...]" [...] However, he topped the England batting averages in the 7-match one-day series, with 267 runs including 130 in the 5th ODI and 82 from 57 balls in the 7th.|$|E

500|$|Christman {{worked with}} the Office of Special Affairs (OSA) in her efforts to curtail or remove {{material}} critical of Scientology from the press, media, and the Internet. She spent a total of 20 years working for the OSA agency while {{a member of the}} Scientology organization. OSA agents serve as the [...] "internal security force and intelligence unit" [...] within Scientology. Christman assisted OSA agents in 1979, when a politician in Clearwater, Florida was attempting to hinder the Scientology organization's efforts to establish a presence in the city. She was ordered to participate in public meetings, and divert the focus of these events to questioning of the politician, Richard Tenning. He was defeated in a subsequent election, and the Scientology organization proceeded to increase its activities in Clearwater. In 1985, Christman helped OSA agents during a lawsuit from a former Scientology member. She attended the court proceedings and wrote reports about members of the jury, and assisted Scientology lawyers in compiling profiles of the jurors. At the time, Christman was an ardent believer in the Scientology organization and did not question the activities of the OSA agents. Reflecting back on her experiences assisting OSA agents, she commented, [...] "I was in a cult. Scientology promotes not watching the news. It keeps you inside a Truman Show where you're totally unaware of things. It's like your own thinking gets shut down and <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> not considering anything that might be critical of Scientology." ...|$|E
500|$|The title's {{controls}} and overall gameplay {{were not as}} well-received, with certain critics questioning their accuracy and depth. MacDonald finished every level in first place within one hour using {{only one of the}} four initial characters. While the game also features a hard mode, MacDonald concluded that [...] "Sonic R has more in the personality department than in the depth department". MacDonald and Reiner cited finding the Chaos Emeralds and hidden coins as [...] "difficult", but MacDonald argued that such optional tasks offered little in return, because the hidden characters [...] "are mostly robot versions of the already playable ones". Moreover, Sackenheim noted that the game's controls initially [...] "take some practice to get used to", but added: [...] "Start sliding around corners and letting off the gas at the right times and you'll be finding all of the secrets that Sonic R conceals in no time". Likewise, Nutter called the controls [...] "initially tricky... but incredibly playable," [...] Next Generation stated [...] "the proper techniques, with time, can be learned," [...] and John concluded [...] "once <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> it, you'll find a real solid game". The latter reviewer thought the game played better with the digital pad as opposed to Sega's analogue controller. Dan Elektro agreed that the controls were [...] "responsive", but [...] "to a fault": [...] "At high speeds, it's nearly impossible to run in a straight line".|$|E
500|$|Rick Thames, {{editor of}} The Charlotte Observer, criticized the book's {{packaging}} calling the cover as [...] "tacky, hot pink-and-acid green sleeves, featuring an unflattering {{photo of the}} dished artist." [...] Barry Didcock from Sunday Herald felt that [...] "Morton [...] to find the face of Madonna." [...] He criticized Morton's sketchy portrayal of Madonna's relationship with deceased painter Jean-Michel Basquiat, saying [...] "he commits an error by doing so because, unusually for Madonna, this was a relationship of equals." [...] Gregg Barrios from Daily Star was critical of the book, saying [...] " [...] The fatal flaw of these quickie knockoffs {{is that they have}} no real ending or any way of predicting what the fates have in store for Madonna Louise Penn [...] nee Ciccone. Once the next Madonna tour, CD, marriage or film appears, their shelf life is cut short." [...] Barbara Ellen from The Guardian criticized Morton's writing by saying, [...] "Andrew Morton achieves the implausible: he takes an interesting woman and an astonishing life and makes them both seem incredibly boring in his life of Madonna.... Once <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> Morton's pace (dull plod, with occasional snooze), it becomes quite amusing joining him on the journey, a bit like watching someone dragging a dead body around, trying to find some place to hide it. Even luminaries such as Madonna exes Sean Penn and Warren Beatty are reduced to flailing around like disenfranchised phantoms in the shallows of Morton's blandly automatic insight." ...|$|E

2500|$|Filming {{began on}} 23 August 2005, lasting for 15 weeks, with August and September being {{difficult}} months {{due to the}} heat and the cast's requirement to wear spacesuits for their roles. Cinematographer Alwin H. Küchler chose to film in anamorphic format to capture a physical sense of the light. [...] "We shot certain sequences in a very dark environment, which <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>used</b> <b>to,</b> so when the Sun plays a role, we wanted the audience to have a physical reaction to it", Kuchler said. Due to filming with the actors taking place on a stage, director Danny Boyle constructed live effects so the actors could realistically respond to computer-generated effects that were later implemented.|$|E
2500|$|... "My {{views were}} {{formulated}} as a 24-year-old officer in Normandy... On one occasion the jeep ahead hit a mine... Next thing I knew, {{there was this}} chap in the long grass beside me. A bloody bundle, shrapnel-ripped, legless, one arm only. The one arm reached out to me, white eyeballs wide, unseeing, in the bloody mask {{that had been a}} face. A gurgling voice said, [...] "Help. Kill me." [...] With shaking hands I reached for my small pouch to load my revolver... I had to look for my bullets—by which time somebody else had already taken care of him. I heard the shot. I still remember that gurgling sound. A voice pleading for death....During the war I saw more wounded men being [...] "taken care of" [...] than I saw being rescued. Because sometimes you were too far from a dressing station, sometimes you couldn't get them out. And they were pumping blood or whatever; they were in such a wreck, the only thing to do was to shoot them. And they were, so don't think they weren't. That hardens you: <b>You</b> <b>get</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> the fact that it can happen. And that it is the only sensible thing to do." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nina was {{a singing}} {{champion}} on Tanghalan ng Kampeon, with her winning pieces [...] "Better Days" [...] and [...] "Love Takes Time".

I also don’t eat spicy food or mint candies." [...] She explained, [...] "Of course, {{it was hard for}} me [...] But <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> it." [...] She also sings twenty songs a day for practice. She takes good care of her voice and maintains a healthy diet, and swore it takes her only three days or less to recover from throat infections. In her 2011 documentary on TvN Asia, it was revealed that despite all the fame and success, Nina still regularly comes back to the Center for Pop Music to train her vocals and make it even stronger. She is also known for doing covers of popular hits. She expressed herself in a statement, saying [...] "I can say that the songs I sing in my albums very much represent who I am [...] I try to make it my own even if it was done originally by another artist." ...|$|E
