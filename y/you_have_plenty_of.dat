6000|$|... "Then as <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> {{money in}} hand, you can pack up your things {{and get out}} of this house before I've time to tell his lordship." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> pluck, Alexis, or {{you never}} could have gone on walking with such feet as those. I am sure I {{could not have done}} so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{very good}} idea, very good," [...] Nat said warmly; [...] "the {{women were not}} wrong when they said <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> good sense. And now, Dinah, what is the news {{from other parts of}} the island?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Go back, Louise," [...] he ordered, [...] "back to your rooms, {{for your}} own sake. Remember that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> left the theatre too ill to finish your performance. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> time already to get home. Quick! Leave me {{to deal with this}} young man. I tell you to go." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course, of course!" [...] said Mulrady, {{a little}} frightened at his {{tenacity}} in questioning the oracle. [...] "Nat'rally, this was private, {{and not to}} be talked about. I meant, <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> room for 'em without crowdin'; you kin tell me some day when you're better, and kin sorter select what's points and what ain't." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Unless <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> {{money when}} you start {{breaking}} prairie, {{you have to be}} a number of things," [...] he answered, smiling. [...] "Difficulties keep cropping up, and they must be attacked." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{no doubt}} you will, Lisle, for <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> common sense, though you are a little {{inclined}} to mischief--not that you are altogether to blame for that, for the officers encourage you in it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now," [...] said Forester, [...] "you can not {{possibly}} have occasion {{to come to me}} about your writing; for here are pages enough for you to write upon for several days, and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> pens." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Nobody asked them,' said Arthur, carelessly, then as {{she turned}} away, {{covering}} {{her face with her}} hands, 'But it is nothing to take to heart in that way. I am my own master, you know, you silly child, and <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> consent, and all that sort of thing, to satisfy you, so you are quite out of the scrape.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You see I {{got myself}} into a scrape tryin' to help you through and how's it turned out! You wouldn't so much as give me {{a bite to eat}} when I was starvin', even when <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> it without costin' a cent. Now, if I'm caught, I've got to go to jail, jest the same's if I'd done {{whatever}} you did." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I did {{not think}} that <b>you</b> could <b>have</b> lived so long without food,' said he, 'and as <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> time to repent your wicked conduct, I will grant you pardon, on {{condition}} that you help me in a sore strait. Read this letter from the Sultan; you will see that if I fail to answer his question about the foals, a dreadful war will be the result.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> pluck, young fellow, if you haven't much wisdom; but if {{you think}} that after getting in here, I shall let you go out again to bring the constables down on me you are mistaken altogether." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{must not}} talk like that," [...] she said kindly; [...] "your life is as {{valuable}} as any here, {{and you know that}} we all like and esteem you; and, at any rate, you have shown today that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> courage." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wonder," [...] he said reflectively, [...] "what we men see in you. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> admirers. They {{say that}} Grefton got himself shot {{out at the}} front because you treated him badly. Yet--you are not much to look at, are you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll send Ben up the hill, and you {{can step}} over to Myra's yourself; it will please her, and <b>you</b> will <b>have</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> time." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Maria, [...] "I {{suppose they}} would; {{but it is}} a great deal better to have money of your own. Besides, suppose that when you get to Liverpool, for some reason or other, your father should not be there. Then, <b>having</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> money, <b>you</b> could go to a hotel and stay there till your father comes. Or you could ask some one of the {{passengers}} who is going to London to let you go with him, and you could tell him that <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> money to pay the expenses." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Money," [...] {{said the}} man who had come in first. [...] "Anyway, that's the first thing. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> it here. Tom Gallwey brought a big wallet out from the {{settlement}} a week ago. They're in the safe in the room behind you, too." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Stop!" [...] cried Mr. Batterbury; his {{mahogany}} face {{actually getting}} white with alarm. [...] "Stop! Don't talk in that dreadfully unprincipled manner--don't, I implore, I insist! <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> friends--you have me, and your sister. Take to portrait-painting--think of your family, and take to portrait-painting!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish, then, {{you would}} take him away. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> money. Do me a favor. Take him to travel. Go to the East--go to Timbuctoo. Then, when Christina is Princess Casamassima," [...] Mrs. Light added in a moment, [...] "he may come back if he chooses." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ten {{years ago}} I was a child. Ronald, {{how can you}} talk like this! <b>You</b> know we <b>have</b> always been as brother and sister together. I have never thought of {{anything}} else of late. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> been home four or five months, anyhow, and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> time to speak if you wanted to. You {{never said a word}} to lead me to believe that you thought of me in any other way than as a cousin." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{should think}} it would be easy enough for you to get a wife, Mr. Burke," [...] said Mrs. Cliff.

6000|$|... "More than ample. Of course, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> light underclothing of all sorts, and {{a couple}} of suits of khaki will not cost you {{anything}} like so much as they would, if you got them at a military tailor's in London. However, if you want more, {{you will be able to}} draw it." ...|$|E
6000|$|Edward did {{not refuse}} the offered grasp, and though {{his words were}} only, [...] "Good-bye, I hope <b>you</b> will <b>have</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> fun!" [...] Harry went away with a lighter heart.|$|R
6000|$|... "Giuseppi," [...] Francis said, [...] "do you act as {{guide to}} the party. <b>You</b> will <b>have</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> {{time to get to}} the top and to return before the galleys come along." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You {{need not}} express it. I don't come pitying you for {{supposed}} troubles. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> money; {{but if you}} were so poor that you could eat nothing but cold mutton, I shouldn't condole with you as to the state of your larder. I should pretend to think that poultry and piecrust were plentiful with you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank God, {{the delay}} that has {{happened}} is of no consequence. I asked Blanche, at Windygates, when you were to be married--and she told me not {{until the end of}} the autumn. It is only the fifth of September now. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> time before you. For all our sakes, make good use of it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> time," [...] {{the woman}} said; [...] "it won't be dark till eight o'clock, and it's not seven yet.

60|$|Because he's got fifty {{thousand}} a year, and you're head over ears in debt. You've got to raise something like four thousand pounds at once, or you go under. You've {{got yourself a}} good deal talked about during the last ten years, but people <b>have</b> stood <b>you</b> because <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> money. If <b>you</b> go broke they'll drop you like a hot potato. And I daresay it wouldn't be inconvenient to change Lady Frederick Berolles into Lady Mereston. My sister has always led {{me to believe that}} it is rather attractive to be a Marchioness.|$|R

6000|$|... "Very good. Mind you are ready. Stop a minute! <b>you</b> will <b>have</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> time {{to speak}} to Blanche when I <b>have</b> done with <b>you.</b> You don't appear {{to me to be}} {{sufficiently}} anxious about seeing your own property." ...|$|R
