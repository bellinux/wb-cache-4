2500|$|In early August 2005, leaked emails {{from former}} US {{prosecutors}} criticised the legal process, accusing it of being [...] "a half-hearted and disorganised effort by a skeleton group of relatively inexperienced attorneys to prosecute fairly low-level accused {{in a process}} that appears to be rigged" [...] and [...] "writing a motion saying that the process will be full and fair when you don't really believe it is kind of hard, particularly when you want to call <b>yourself</b> <b>an</b> officer and lawyer". Ruddock responded by saying that the emails, written in March 2004, [...] "must be seen as historic rather than current." [...] In October 2005, the US government announced that if Hicks was convicted, his pre-trial detention would not count as time served against his sentence.|$|E
2500|$|Buechner has {{occasionally}} {{been accused}} of being too [...] "preachy;" [...] a 1984 review by Anna Shapiro in the New York Times notes [...] "But for all the colloquialism, there is something, well, preachy and a little unctuous about making <b>yourself</b> <b>an</b> exemplar of faith. Insights that would do for a paragraph are dragged out with a doggedness that will presumably bring the idea home to even the most resistant and inattentive." [...] The sentiments expressed by Cecelia Holland's 1987 Washington Post review of Buechner's novel, Brendan, are far more common. She writes,"In our own time, when religion is debased, an electronic game show, an insult to the thirsty soul, Buechner's novel proves again the power of faith, to lift us up, to hold us straight, to send us on again." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "Have <b>Yourself</b> <b>a</b> Merry Little Christmas", Hugh Martin and Ralph Blane, 1944, {{performed}} by Judy Garland. The lyrics for [...] "Have <b>Yourself</b> <b>A</b> Merry Little Christmas" [...] were originally different. The lyricist, Hugh Martin, wrote opening lyrics which were deemed too depressing by Judy Garland, Tom Drake, and Vincente Minnelli (They were: [...] "Have <b>yourself</b> <b>a</b> merry little Christmas / It {{may be your}} last/ Next year we may all be living in the past"), so Martin changed the lyrics.|$|R
