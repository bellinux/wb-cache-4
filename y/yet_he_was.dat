5|$|Octavian had {{previously}} shown little mercy to surrendered enemies and acted {{in ways that}} had proven unpopular with the Roman people, <b>yet</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> given credit for pardoning many of his opponents after the Battle of Actium.|$|E
5|$|Kesselring {{was back}} where he started. Park's {{handling}} of the actions was a masterpiece of aggressive defence, <b>yet</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not under the same pressure {{as he had been}} in the battles during August when air battles were so confusing they were hard to control. A big set-piece offensive played into his hands.|$|E
5|$|David is {{best known}} for his crucial {{assistance}} to the Byzantine Macedonian dynasty in the 976–9 civil war and his unique role in the political unification of various Georgian polities as well as his patronage of Christian culture and learning. Between 987 and 989, David joined his friend Bardas Phocas in a revolt against the Byzantine emperor Basil II, but was defeated and agreed to cede his lands to the empire on his death. <b>Yet</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> able to secure for his heir, Bagrat III, an opportunity to become the first ruler of a unified Georgian kingdom.|$|E
5000|$|Little {{is known}} about this version of Blast Off <b>yet.</b> <b>He</b> <b>is</b> a Decepticon astronaut.|$|R
50|$|<b>Yet</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> {{convinced}} that The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception {{is far from}} being the last word on the subject.|$|R
5000|$|Sebastian {{was stated}} as being {{dead in the}} movie, <b>yet</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> alive in The Edge of Human.|$|R
5|$|During World War I, Constantine I {{followed}} a formal policy of neutrality, <b>yet</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> openly benevolent towards Germany, which was fighting alongside Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire against the Triple Entente of Russia, France and Britain. Constantine was the brother-in-law of Kaiser Wilhelm II, and had also {{become something of}} a Germanophile following his military training in Prussia. His pro-German attitude provoked a split between the monarch and the prime minister, Eleftherios Venizelos, who wanted to support the Entente in the hope of expanding Greek territory to incorporate the Greek minorities in the Ottoman Empire and the Balkans. Protected by the countries of the Entente, particularly France, in 1916 Venizelos formed a parallel government to that of the king.|$|E
5|$|Quintus of Smyrna, in {{a passage}} whose {{atmosphere}} Boitani describes as sad and elegiac, retains what for Boitani {{are the two}} important issues of the ancient story, that Troilus is doomed by Fate and that his failure to continue his line symbolises Troy's fall. In this case, {{there is no doubt}} that Troilus entered battle knowingly, for in the Posthomerica Troilus's armour is one of the funerary gifts after Achilles' own death. Quintus repeatedly emphasises Troilus's youth: he is beardless, virgin of a bride, childlike, beautiful, the most godlike of all Hecuba's children. <b>Yet</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> lured by Fate to war when he knew no fear and was struck down by Achilles' spear just as a flower or corn that has borne no seed is killed by the gardener.|$|E
5|$|Słowacki {{was not a}} {{very popular}} figure in Paris, nor among his contemporaries. He wrote many dramas, which can be seen as his {{favorite}} genre, <b>yet</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a playwright who never saw any of his work performed on stage (only Mazepa was staged during his lifetime, and not in his presence). His works, written in Polish, dense with Slavic myths, philosophy and symbols, were difficult to translate to other languages. Słowacki's unpopularity among other Polish émigrés can be attributed to his unwillingness to pander to contemporary tastes; and in particular, his refusal to comfort his compatriots, shaken by the loss of Polish statehood and the failure of the November Uprising. Słowacki's ironic and sometimes pessimistic attitude was not appreciated by his contemporaries, nor was his denial of Polish uniqueness.|$|E
50|$|Edwin Aguilar {{did all the}} {{animation}} for the Legoland sequence, <b>yet</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> not featured in the episode's credits.|$|R
50|$|Though <b>he</b> <b>be</b> scrupulous in {{matter of}} ceremony, <b>yet</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> a loyal subject unto the King, and a true friend unto the state.|$|R
5000|$|On the surface, Ben Loy appears like a [...] "good boy", <b>yet</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> {{covering}} up secrets of a promiscuous past.|$|R
25|$|Lueger's monuments {{present a}} {{difficult}} case {{because they are}} genuinely local, <b>yet</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> inspirational for the Nazis.|$|E
25|$|Faulkner {{had been}} campaigning {{to get rid}} of the pirate {{printers}} in Ireland, as they were competition, and <b>yet</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> so tarred with the charge of piracy that he was even excluded from scientific societies in England.|$|E
25|$|David Bronstein {{wrote that}} Boris Verlinsky {{had won the}} 1929 Soviet Championship and was granted the first Soviet Grandmaster title for this achievement, <b>yet</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> later {{stripped}} of it, when it was thought more politically correct to make Botvinnik the first official Soviet GM (as distinct from the then-nonexistent FIDE grandmaster title).|$|E
5000|$|According to skeptical {{academic}} Paul Kurtz, [...] "Clark attacks skeptics {{for being}} closed-minded and dogmatic, <b>yet</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> easily impressed by questionable evidence." ...|$|R
50|$|Vanaraja Chavda is not {{portrayed as}} a Jain by birth, <b>yet</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> shown {{participating}} in distinctly Jain rituals of kingship by Jain authors.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Augustine, too, {{spent the}} best {{ten years of}} his life among such; and <b>yet</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> now combating the very errors which he once taught.' ...|$|R
25|$|In his Treaty {{defending}} the sea chart, Nunes {{argued that a}} nautical chart should have its parallels and meridians shown as straight lines. <b>Yet</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> unsure how {{to solve the problems}} that this caused: a situation that lasted until Mercator developed the projection bearing his name. The Mercator Projection is the system which is still used.|$|E
25|$|In {{his next}} match, the quarter final at Saurashtra University in Rajkot against Karnataka, he scored 37 & 352 (dismissed by off spinner K.Gowtham in both innings) {{to ensure that}} Saurashtra qualify to the semifinal. Though he was called to the India ODI Squad after this success, <b>yet</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not {{selected}} in the first XI.|$|E
25|$|Innes was {{involved}} in virtually every significant act in Cape political life during {{his years as a}} parliamentarian, and his alliance with Merriman and Sauer was a formidable one. <b>Yet</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not particularly well suited to politics; he was too scrupulous and too measured in his views. He turned down the leadership of the opposition, he said, because his tendency to see both sides of a debate would make him a poor leader.|$|E
6000|$|... "He hasn't {{recovered}} consciousness <b>yet.</b> <b>He</b> <b>is</b> {{wounded in}} the back and in {{trying to get to the}} rear became insensible from loss of blood." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not <b>yet.</b> <b>He</b> <b>is</b> half {{afraid to}} move. I think he realizes, or will very soon, how serious this man's {{existence}} {{may be for}} Germany." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Poor Frank is {{our worst}} case as <b>yet.</b> <b>He</b> <b>is</b> {{constantly}} delirious. The others are generally sensible, except that Terry is dreadfully haunted with mathematics." ...|$|R
25|$|In his {{literary}} career, Hoffmann Price produced fiction {{for a wide}} range of publications, from Argosy to Terror Tales, from Speed Detective to Spicy Mystery Stories. <b>Yet</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> most readily identified as a Weird Tales writer, one of the group who wrote regularly for editor Farnsworth Wright, a group that included Lovecraft, Robert E. Howard, and Clark Ashton Smith. Price published 24 solo stories in Weird Tales between 1925 and 1950, plus three collaborations with Otis Adelbert Kline, and his works with Lovecraft, noted above.|$|E
25|$|Isidore of Seville {{wrote about}} the local music in the 6th century. His {{influences}} were predominantly Greek, and <b>yet</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> an original thinker, and recorded {{some of the first}} details about the early music of the Christian church. He perhaps is most famous in musical history for declaring that {{it was not possible to}} notate sounds, an assertion which revealed his ignorance of the notational system of ancient Greece, suggesting that this knowledge had been lost with the fall of the Roman Empire in the west.|$|E
25|$|Louis {{was under}} no {{delusion}} {{about the state}} of his boxing skills, <b>yet</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> too embarrassed to quit after the Walcott fight. Determined to win and retire with his title intact, Louis signed on for a rematch. On June 25, 1948, about 42,000 people came to Yankee Stadium to see the aging champion, who weighed 213½, the heaviest of his career to date. Walcott knocked Louis down in the third round, but Louis survived to knock out Walcott in the eleventh.|$|E
6000|$|... "His soul {{has been}} seared," [...] said May Sethby. [...] "Light and {{laughter}} have been burned out of him. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> like one dead, and <b>yet</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> fearfully alive." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course there}} <b>is</b> not; and <b>yet</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> to be punished. I know very well, Mr. Erle, {{that if you}} choose to put your {{shoulder}} to the wheel you can manage it; and I shall expect to have it managed." ...|$|R

25|$|Today we {{know the}} {{exertion}} of his journey to Korea took a greater toll of his strength than perhaps even he realized. But he considered it his duty as an American to be there, {{and that was all}} that mattered to him. Jolson died in a San Francisco hotel. <b>Yet</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> as much a battle casualty as any American soldier who has fallen on the rocky slopes of Korea … A star for more than 40 years, he earned his most glorious star rating at the end—a gold star.|$|E
25|$|Aged 20, Huxley was {{too young}} to apply to the Royal College of Surgeons for a licence to practise, <b>yet</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> 'deep in debt'. So, at a friend's suggestion, he applied for an {{appointment}} in the Royal Navy. He had references on character and certificates showing the time spent on his apprenticeship and on requirements such as dissection and pharmacy. Sir William Burnett, the Physician General of the Navy, interviewed him and arranged for the College of Surgeons to test his competence (by means of a viva voce).|$|E
25|$|At {{the onset}} of puberty, Chikatilo {{discovered}} that he suffered from chronic impotence, worsening his social awkwardness and self-hatred. He was shy {{in the company of}} women; his first crush, at age 17, had been on a girl named Lilya Barysheva, with whom he had become acquainted through his school newspaper, <b>yet</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> chronically nervous in her company and never asked her for a date. The same year, Chikatilo jumped upon an 11-year-old friend of his younger sister and wrestled her to the ground, ejaculating as the girl struggled in his grasp.|$|E
6000|$|... "Listen to him! You'd think butter wouldn't melt in his mouth, an' <b>yet</b> <b>he's</b> <b>been</b> ridin' {{a mighty}} high hoss, 'cordin' to all I can find out!" ...|$|R
50|$|He admires {{the leaders}} who led their {{countries}} to independence, <b>yet</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> {{highly critical of}} them in most cases for their failures during the post-colonial period. He became disillusioned with the leadership on the continent through the years, filled with broken promises, and {{not long after the}} countries won independence. He admires many aspects of Nyerere's socialist policies in Tanzania, yet concedes the policies were also a failure in many cases. And he strongly favours fundamental change in African countries, <b>yet</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> nostalgic about the past.|$|R
5000|$|Considered as [...] "l'enfant terrible du cinéma marocain" [...] for his antics with {{journalists and}} his fellow filmmakers, <b>yet</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> {{considered}} one of the most talented Moroccan directors.|$|R
