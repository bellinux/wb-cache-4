2500|$|Despite his pacifist upbringing, {{as a young}} freedom fighter, Wali Khan seemed exasperated {{with the}} pacifism {{advocated}} by his father. He was to later explain his frustration to Gandhi, in a story he told Muklaika Bannerjee, [...] "If the cook comes to slaughter this chicken's baby, is non-violence {{on the part of}} the chicken likely to save the younger life?" [...] The story ended with a twinkle in his eye when he remembered Gandhiji's reply, [...] "Wali, <b>you</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> done more research on violence than I have on non-violence." [...] His first wife died in 1949 while Wali Khan was in prison. In 1954, he married Nasim Wali Khan, the daughter of an old Khudai Khidmatgar activist.|$|E
2500|$|Phaedrus and Socrates both {{note how}} anyone would {{consider}} Socrates a foreigner in the countryside, and Socrates attributes this fault to {{his love of}} learning which [...] "trees and open country won't teach," [...] while [...] "men in the town" [...] will. Socrates then proceeds to give Phaedrus credit for leading {{him out of his}} native land: [...] "Yet <b>you</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> discovered a drug for getting me out (dokei moi tes emes exodou to pharmakon heurekenai). A hungry animal can be driven by dangling a carrot or a bit of greenstuff in front of it; similarly if you proffer me speeches bound in books (en bibliois) I don't doubt you can cart me all around Attica, and anywhere else you please." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 20 December, T. V. Soong {{arrived in}} Xi'an, and Soong Mei-ling arrived two days later, {{in order to}} {{negotiate}} Chiang's release. At first, Chiang was opposed to negotiating with a CCP delegate, but withdrew his opposition {{when it became clear}} that his life and freedom were largely dependent on Communist goodwill towards him. On 24 December, Chiang received Zhou for a meeting, the first time that the two had seen each other since Zhou had left Whampoa over ten years earlier. Zhou began the conversation by saying: [...] "In the ten years since we have met, <b>you</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> aged very little." [...] Chiang nodded and said: [...] "Enlai, you were my subordinate. You should do what I say." [...] Zhou replied that, if Chiang would halt the civil war and resist the Japanese instead, the Red Army would willingly accept Chiang's command. By the end of this meeting, Chiang promised to end the civil war, to resist the Japanese together, and to invite Zhou to Nanjing for further talks.|$|E

6000|$|... "It {{used to make}} me {{so angry}} with you," [...] said Ann, [...] "that <b>you</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> no go, no {{ambition}} in you. I wanted you to wake up--do something. If I had known you were a budding genius--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It wasn't the message. I was bracing {{up before}} it came; {{you and your}} father made me feel that I needn't despair. In fact, I was getting ashamed of being downcast, after the {{confidence}} <b>you</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> in me." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'The chant! A noble {{office for}} me, truly! That {{is the very}} part of the absurd {{spectacle}} to which you used to say the people never dreamed of attending.

But he very soon gets tired of it, and goes away. <b>You</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> more perseverance.

6000|$|... "You {{have been}} seen a great deal with Miss Brooks lately--on the street and elsewhere--acting as her escort, and evidently on terms of intimacy.
