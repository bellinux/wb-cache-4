25|$|INTERVIEWER: Suppose {{someone called}} <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> {{there was a}} kid, {{nineteen}} or twenty years old, {{who has been a}} very good boy, {{but all of a sudden}} this week he started walking around the neighborhood carrying a large cross. The neighbors are upset and the family's upset, and would you do something about it. How would you think about that as a problem? Some kind of bizarre behavior like that.|$|E
500|$|Conversely, Allmusic {{contributor}} Gregory Heaney {{gave the}} album an overall score of {{three out of}} a possible five, noting that the lyrics [...] "feel more genuinely personal than his earlier work", and that [...] "there's a real sense of urgent catharsis at work". He concludes, [...] " [...] combination of a tight, talented band and a tortured frontman doesn't necessarily make Falling in Reverse a revelatory band, but is does make The Drug in Me Is You a very solid album." [...] Molly Walter of The University Leader felt the album was an attempt to recreate Escape the Fate prior to Radke's departure and noted that [...] "he fell short big time", calling the album's music [...] "out of date and overdone". Walter did comment on Radke's singing but felt the lyrical content was conceited, concluding the review saying, [...] "Face it, Ronnie, you did not magically turn tragedy into melody. You’re just not king of the music scene." [...] The [...] Jam! gives 3.5/5 stars to The Drug in Me Is <b>You</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "In a world of poseurs, Ronnie Radke is the real deal. The lewd, crude and tattooed punk has survived jail, rehab and being turfed from Escape the Fate. Now he’s on the loose and up to no good with a new band — and a CD of post-hardcore anthems that render his foul-mouthed tales of sex, drugs and rock ’n’ roll with a mix of metalcore power and pop-punk melody. Lock up everything." ...|$|E
2500|$|Abu Musa al-Ashari {{reported}} that Muhammad said, [...] "When {{a son of}} a servant of Allah dies, Allah Says to the angels, 'Have you taken the son of My servant?' They say, 'Yes.' Then Allah Says, 'Have you taken the fruit of his heart?' They say, 'Yes.' Allah Says, [...] "What has My servant said?' They say, 'He has praised <b>You</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> Allah is the only one and his Prophet is Muhammad [...] (Surely we belong to Allah and to Him shall we return). Then Allah Says, 'Build a house for My servant in Paradise and call it the house of praise.'" [...] From Tirmidhi, Musnad Ahmad and ibn Habban ...|$|E

2500|$|Upon {{conclusion}} of the peace in 1674, the Duke of York appointed Sir Edmund Andros as Governor of his territories in America. Governor Edmund Andros in 1674 said [...] "permit all persons of what religion soever, quietly to inhabit within the precincts of your jurisdiction" [...] Nonetheless, he made the Quakers of West Jersey pay toll on the Delaware, but they applied to England and were redressed. He was followed by Colonel Thomas Dongan in 1682. Dongan was empowered, {{on the advice of}} William Penn, to summon [...] "...a general assembly of all the freeholders, by such persons they should choose to represent them to consult with <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> council what laws are fit and necessary to be made..." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cao Cao often praised Xun <b>You</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Gongda is {{intelligent}} but appears foolish; he is courageous but appears cowardly; he is resilient but appears weak. He neither flaunts {{his talents}} nor brags about his achievements. You {{can be as}} intelligent as him, but you can't pretend to be foolish {{as well as he}} does. Even Master Yan and Dou Wu cannot be compared to him." [...] When Cao Pi was still Cao Cao's heir apparent, his father told him, [...] "Xun Gongda is a role model for people. You should treat him courteously and respectfully." [...] When Xun You was ill, Cao Pi visited him and knelt down beside his bed; such was Cao Pi's level of respect for Xun You. Zhong Yao also once said, [...] "Every time I plan something, I'll carefully think through it again and again until I'm certain that I can't make any more changes. However, after consulting Gongda, he always has new insights to offer." [...] Xun You created 12 strategies for Zhong Yao. Zhong Yao died before he managed to finish writing a book about the 12 strategies, hence some of them were lost. The historian Pei Songzhi thought it was a huge pity that Xun You's strategies were lost because Zhong Yao {{died at the age of}} 79 – some 16 years after Xun You's death – so he probably should have had ample time to finish writing the book.|$|E

60|$|EILEEN. Don't scold me, please. I'll {{make up for}} it. I'll rest all the time--after you're gone.
