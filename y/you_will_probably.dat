500|$|The title Wildlife is not {{derived from}} lyrics from the album, but from themes that connect the songs. Dreyer regards {{wildlife}} as [...] "an all-encompassing word to sum everything up", {{and he has}} said that [...] "we all witness tragedy and change. It's the summation of our existence." [...] On the inside of the album cover the words [...] "To – for everything" [...] are written as a dedication with a word being crossed out. It has been speculated by some that the word is the name 'Helen'. Drummer Brad Vander Lugt when asked about the dedication replied [...] "That’s Jordan’s story to tell, and not mine. [...] It does have significance to a story he is telling. <b>You</b> <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> hear {{a little bit more about}} that in future work, Jordan has been known to continue stories or themes onto future albums." ...|$|E

500|$|Back in London, Fleming had his manuscript—which he {{described}} as his [...] "dreadful oafish opus"—retyped by Joan Howe, his red-haired secretary at The Times on whom the character Miss Moneypenny was partly based. Clare Blanchard, a former girlfriend, advised him not to publish the book, {{or at least to}} do so under a pseudonym. During the book's final draft stages, Fleming allowed his friend, and later editor, William Plomer to see a copy, and remarked [...] "I really am thoroughly ashamed of it... after rifling through this muck <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> never speak to me again, but I have got to take that chance." [...] Despite this, Plomer thought the book had sufficient promise and sent a copy to the publishing house Jonathan Cape. At first they were unenthusiastic, but were persuaded to publish on the recommendation of Fleming's older brother, Peter, an established travel writer whose books they managed.|$|E
500|$|After the {{formation}} of the New Zealand Rugby Football Union in 1892, New Zealand representative teams were selected for matches against international opponents. The first tour by a New Zealand representative side under NZRFU auspices was in 1894 to New South Wales (although an earlier team had toured Britain and Australia in 1888–1889). New Zealand's first Test match was in 1903 when they played Australia in Sydney. New Zealand's first home Test was played the following year when they defeated Britain at Athletic Park, Wellington, by 9–3. The win was significant as Britain had been unbeaten in their Australian tour, yet they won only two out of five matches in New Zealand. The captain of Great Britain, David Bedell-Sivright, said after the Test that he could not see New Zealand winning the big matches on their Northern Hemisphere tour, but [...] "I think <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> win most of the county matches." ...|$|E

"But," [...] I said doubtfully, [...] "I don't {{know the}} Kennedys--nor {{any of the}} social stunts that are doing in Broughton; I won't dare to talk about anything, and I'll seem so stupid, even if I don't {{actually}} make some irremediable blunder, that the Kennedys will be disgusted with <b>you.</b> It <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> do your prospects more harm than your absence would." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And now I {{want to make}} a {{proposal}} to you--viz., to buy back the Isleworth lands from you. I know that the place is distasteful to <b>you,</b> and <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> be doubly so after your severe illness; but, if you care to keep the house and grounds, I am not particularly anxious to acquire them.

2500|$|Craig's sister, Jess Nicholls, also {{confirmed}} their departure via the band's official forum. [...] "If {{any of you}} were at Homebake yesterday, I'm sure you can agree the set was amazing and sounded better than ever," [...] she wrote. [...] "The band has made a creative decision to revert back to a three piece, as they originally started. I know <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> {{have a lot of}} questions but just wanted to say don't fear, this is in no way the end of the Vines!!"

2500|$|... {{for ever}} or forever: Traditional British English usage makes a {{distinction}} between for ever, meaning for eternity (or {{a very long time}} into the future), as in [...] "If you are waiting for income tax to be abolished <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> have to wait for ever"; and forever, meaning continually, always, as in [...] "They are forever arguing". In British usage today, however, forever prevails in the [...] "for eternity" [...] sense as well, in spite of several style guides maintaining the distinction. American writers usually use forever regardless of which sense they intend (although forever in the sense of [...] "continually" [...] is comparatively rare in American English, having been displaced by always).|$|E
2500|$|Compute!'s Gazette in 1986 called Temple of Apshai Trilogy for the Commodore 64 [...] "a classic {{series of}} {{computer}} games made even better", stating that improved graphics and game play made it worthwhile {{even for those}} who had played them before. Amiga World criticized the Amiga version of Trilogys repetitiveness, stating that [...] "unless you are very easily amused <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> lose interest fairly soon". Bill Kunkel, Arnie Katz and Joyce Worley for Analog Computing, on the other hand, listed Trilogy {{as one of the best}} Atari ST games of 1986, lauded the improved graphics and interface, while asserting that [...] "the actual content is timeless". In Dragon #114's [...] "The Role of Computers" [...] column in 1986, reviewers Hartley and Pattie Lesser also stated that the game was [...] "well-worth your interest." [...] Info gave the Amiga version four-plus stars out of five, stating that the trilogy [...] "has been admirably Amiga-tized". The magazine approved of the graphics, sound, and user interface and concluded that the game would be [...] "more likely to appeal to novices than Ultima". In 1991 and 1993 Computer Gaming Worlds Scorpia stated that the graphics [...] "caused a sensation when it first appeared", but also criticized a lack of polish in the programming and slow speed due to the use of BASIC, issues which were improved upon in the Atari 8-bit version.|$|E

2500|$|In Light {{received}} largely favorable {{reviews from}} music critics. Catherine P. Lewis of The Washington Post described the record as an [...] "instant mood-lifter," [...] writing that [...] "There’s not a lethargic moment here [...] the band’s exuberance is barely containable." [...] Stephen Thompson of NPR felt In Light reflected [...] " [...] that knockabout, anything-goes vibe, {{just in time}} for the season that suits it best." [...] Devon Maloney of The Phoenix called the record [...] "an impressive step forward — it seriously contends for the title of this summer's go-to indie-pop record." [...] Allmusic's Matt Collar called In Light an [...] "accomplished, ambitious debut," [...] while comparing it to [...] "the peppy pseudo-Afro pop of Vampire Weekend and the percussive, improv-heavy dance rock of Local Natives." [...] Ryan Reed of Paste felt the record rose above its reference points, [...] "because the songs are usually excellent [...] speaking strictly sonics, In Light is literally the brightest album I’ve heard in ages." [...] Q felt [...] "This world music/indie rock mix is countered by the affecting melancholy of their quieter moments," [...] while Ari Lipsitz of CMJ opined that Givers were a [...] "seriously cute band that writes seriously catchy love songs that <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> seriously enjoy — if you're all right with that ebullience thing." ...|$|E
