60|$|The Stranger.--One of <b>you</b> <b>referred</b> in our {{conversation}} {{this morning to}} a vision, which had some relation {{to the subject of}} our discussion, and I was promised some information on this matter.|$|E
6000|$|... "What is {{the verse}} <b>you</b> <b>referred</b> him to, Hilda?" [...] Netta said. [...] "I confess that I {{do not know}} any verse in St. John {{that seems to be}} at all {{applicable}} to him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, I see, Amy. If <b>you</b> <b>refer</b> to the {{presence}} of any visitor you have here--I say, if <b>you</b> <b>refer</b> to that,' answered Tip, jerking his head with emphasis towards his shoulder nearest Clennam, 'I see!' ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I presume," [...] he asked, [...] "that <b>you</b> <b>refer</b> to {{the battle}} of Magenta, Major?" ...|$|R
30|$|Imagine that {{somebody}} asks you the following question: “How successful has your occupational career been so far?” Would it {{be easy for}} you to answer this question or would you need considerable time to think about it? Which criteria would you apply? Would <b>you</b> <b>refer</b> to your bank-account, would <b>you</b> <b>refer</b> to your reputation among colleagues, would <b>you</b> <b>refer</b> to an ongoing project? Would you give a simple successful vs. unsuccessful answer or would you differentiate between several criteria? Which standard(s) of comparison would you use? Irrespective of how these questions will be answered people are no doubt concerned about their career success, they want to be successful and they want to feel successful. The meaning of career success is, however, not easy to grasp.|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{never spoken}} {{of it before}} because it's your business, not mine," [...] {{continued}} the girl. I wouldn't have spoken now, but when <b>you</b> <b>referred</b> to your loneliness I thought perhaps you didn't realize the cause of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Neither can I tell of {{what use}} my troubling you may be," [...] {{retorted}} Oliver with provoking coolness, [...] "but I heard the man speak {{of you on}} the beach {{less than an hour}} ago, and as <b>you</b> <b>referred</b> to him yourself I thought it right to call--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This is Mr. Ralph Lorimer to whom <b>you</b> <b>referred</b> to in a {{recently}} published paragraph," [...] he said. [...] "The other gentleman is his uncle, a British capitalist; {{and after he}} has given {{his version of the}} affair I have something to say. Will you state the main facts briefly, Mr. Lorimer?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are <b>you</b> <b>referring</b> to Miss Clibborn's {{engagement}} to Captain Parsons?" [...] he asked, with a gloomy face. [...] "Bad news travels fast." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} <b>you</b> <b>refer</b> to, sir. I have {{certainly}} never borrowed any money {{on such an}} insecurity. Please to explain." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My lord," [...] said Ramiro, revived and {{strengthened}} in spirit by the draught, [...] "I must ask your Excellency to {{be a little}} plainer with me. To what conspiracy is it that <b>you</b> <b>refer?</b> I know of none. What is this letter which you say Vitelli wrote me? I take it <b>you</b> <b>refer</b> to the Lord of Citta di Castello. But I can recall no letters passing between us. My acquaintance with him is of the slightest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Which one was---- Oh, the boy you {{met on the}} road? Why, really, I didn't {{notice him}} particularly. I'd rather fancied from the way <b>you</b> <b>referred</b> {{to him that he}} was awfully jolly and forceful, but rather crude. But I didn't notice him at all. He seemed {{perfectly}} well-bred, but slightly heavy." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Longdon faced her, {{across his}} interval, with his {{original}} terror represented now only {{by such a}} lingering flush as might have formed a natural tribute to a brilliant scene. [...] "I haven't the glimmering of {{an idea of what}} you'd be at. But please understand," [...] he added, [...] "that I don't at all refuse you the private half-hour <b>you</b> <b>referred</b> to a while since." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{consider}} {{that has taken}} the responsibility off my shoulders, Amy. <b>You</b> <b>referred</b> me to Mrs. Hamber as the lady you knew best here. She is of opinion that, if she were your mother, she would advise your {{trying to get away}} with me. So, now, we have only to decide how it is to be done--that is, if you still wish to try." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I don't know, Emelina, what is {{the precise}} `thingumy' <b>you</b> <b>refer</b> to this time," [...] said the uncompromising and matter-of-fact Miss Deemas.|$|R
6000|$|... "Liberty, sir!--I am an {{advocate}} for liberty wherever I can find it. Do <b>you</b> <b>refer</b> to the young men on the lawn, Mr. Effingham?" ...|$|R
50|$|Boshoff: But now why do <b>you</b> <b>refer</b> to <b>you</b> {{people as}} blacks? Why not brown people? I mean {{you people are}} more brown than black.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no," [...] cried Holmes, [...] "not {{a word to}} the cousin--not a word, I beg of you. The {{matter is}} very {{important}}, and the farther I go with it, the more important it seems to grow. When <b>you</b> <b>referred</b> in your ledger to the sale of those casts I observed that the date was June 3rd of last year. Could {{you give me the}} date when Beppo was arrested?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You will understand, sir," [...] he concluded, [...] "that {{a scheme}} such as I {{have pointed out}} could only be carried through if {{the whole of the}} {{property}} were in one person's hands. I may say that the information to which <b>you</b> <b>referred</b> a few days ago was perfectly correct. A considerable portion of {{the south side of the}} hill has already been purchased, besides certain other plots which would interfere considerably with any comprehensive scheme of building." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now I wish {{to ask you}} {{one more}} question, which I wish you all to answer by your votes, honestly. It is this. Do you think that the real {{disorder}} which has been in this class, that is, the real cases which <b>you</b> <b>referred</b> to, when you stated to me, that you thought that the class was not in good order, have been now really exposed, so that I honestly and fully understand the case? How many suppose so?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why do <b>you</b> <b>refer</b> {{again to}} that?" [...] she asked. [...] "Is--" [...] (she hesitated and {{recovered}} herself)--"Is Mr. Winterfield another devoted friend of yours?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Silvio warns Tony that Ralph is {{the type}} to pull a [...] "Jack Ruby" [...] on <b>you,</b> <b>referring</b> to the sneak-attacking shooter of Lee Harvey Oswald.|$|R
6000|$|... "Your wits are {{sharper than}} mine, Emma," [...] said Mrs Stoutley, {{with a sigh}} and a placid look. [...] "What do <b>you</b> <b>refer</b> to, Doctor Tough?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, young sir, {{tell us your}} story," [...] {{the prince}} said. [...] "Do not fear of its being long. It is a rest to have one's mind taken off the affairs of state. I have already told these gentlemen what {{valuable}} services you have rendered to the cause we all have at heart, and they, like myself, wish {{to know how you}} fared, and how you escaped the danger <b>you</b> <b>referred</b> to at the hands of Von Aert." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no, dear Miss Henley," [...] she {{hastened to}} say; [...] "the inn {{is really a}} more clean and {{comfortable}} place than you suppose. A hard bed and a scarcity of furniture are the worst evils which your friend has to fear. Do you know," [...] she continued, addressing herself to Mountjoy, [...] "that I was reminded {{of a friend of}} mine, when you spoke just now of the young gentleman whose adventures are in the newspapers. Is it possible that <b>you</b> <b>referred</b> to the brother of the present Earl of Norland? A handsome young Irishman--with whom I first became acquainted many years since. Am I right in supposing that you and Miss Henley know Lord Harry?" [...] she asked.|$|E
5000|$|... "What do {{you mean}} <b>you</b> <b>referred</b> it to the prosecution? Are you trying to cheat parliament?" [...] Al-Tabtabaie asked the minister. [...] "The {{official}} responsible for treatment abroad is still {{on top of his}} job." ...|$|E
5000|$|Using {{the word}} [...] "specification" [...] without {{additional}} information to {{what kind of}} specification <b>you</b> <b>refer</b> to is confusing and considered bad practice within systems engineering.|$|R
5000|$|In [...] "Michael's Last Dundies", Creed's {{contribution}} to the office workers' version of Seasons of Love is [...] "I watch <b>you</b> (<b>referring</b> to Michael) when you sleep." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's the {{discretion}} you just spoke of," [...] said the Duchess. [...] "Only I should have {{expected from the}} cause <b>you</b> <b>refer</b> to rather the comic effect." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "The team {{responsible}} for After Dark were naturally pleased that Broadcast chose our programme {{as one of}} the most significant in Channel 4's history in your anniversary issue. Since <b>you</b> <b>referred</b> to the edition in which the late Oliver Reed took part, this seems a good time to correct some of the myths which have surrounded the programme since it was transmitted on 26 January 1991.|$|E
50|$|One {{may wonder}} why {{should there be}} yet another website for library as {{there is already a}} glut of sites for the same on internet. The most {{positive}} aspect of this library is that your reference to a particular book you are consulting is saved for your future reference. For example, if you are going through the author Ayatullah Sistani' Tauziul Masael, 'Fiqh' and left the book after flipping through 26 pages, this would be saved for your next reference. So if you log-in again after some time you need not bother to search the book and its pages <b>you</b> <b>referred</b> to in your previous session again. You will automatically get down to the page you left unread in your earlier session that is page number 26 in the example here.|$|E
40|$|Ralph Hudson (State Library), Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, USA, letter, 1937 March 25, to Hamlin Garland, 2045 De Mille Drive, Hollywood, California, USA. "We {{have made}} {{a search for the}} Indian crosses <b>you</b> <b>referred</b> to in yoru recent letter but so far, have been unable to find any trace of them. " [...] first line...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>refer</b> {{particularly}} to MY stairs?" [...] she asked with her whimsical woe. But meanwhile {{she had taken}} it in. [...] "Then whom were you speaking of?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is indeed," [...] {{returned}} Milly; [...] "but I don't {{feel quite}} sure whether <b>you</b> <b>refer</b> to the splendour of the scenery or {{the goodness of}} the tart." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now," [...] said Mr. Lorry, gently laying {{his hand}} on the Doctor's arm again, after a short silence on both sides, [...] "to what would <b>you</b> <b>refer</b> this attack?" ...|$|R
