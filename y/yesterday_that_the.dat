25|$|Unlike {{the system}} obtaining under State control, when hauls wore left on deck until all {{operations}} ended, the method adopted was to place each haul of fish straight {{into a separate}} ice-house, and, to prevent-crushing of the lower layers of fish, each ice-house is divided into sections by removable shelves. This system also obviates the use of grappling hooks, which formerly tore {{the flesh of the}} fish, and so made large quantities unsaleable. Under the new system loading into the baskets is affected by a simple inclination of the shelves. Mr. Creamer, general manager of the Coastal Trawling Company, which controls the Koraaga, pointed out <b>yesterday</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> reduction of handling to a minimum must ensured the good condition of all fish. The ‘Koraaga, moreover, should show a profit with even moderate catches. The weakness of the State trawling enterprise was, in his opinion, the large administrative and storage expenses. The Coastal Trawling Company has entirely eliminated the latter. Arrangements were made for the landing of fish at the markets in as fresh a condition as possible. Voyages were cut short; bonus systems were introduced, which made it worthwhile for the crews to see that no damage was done in the stowage or unloading of their hauls. Unnecessary handling was obviated by all discoverable devices.|$|E

[...] "To look at you, Miriam, {{it seems as if}} years must have passed since <b>yesterday.</b> <b>That</b> is <b>the</b> pink dress <b>that</b> Dora Bannister wore when she was here, isn't it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{just seen}} Mat Tierney, {{and he told}} me that Kilcullen had declared, at a large dinner-party, <b>yesterday,</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> match between me and his cousin was finally broken off." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{dinner was}} the {{counterpart}} of <b>yesterday's,</b> except <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Major was twenty-four hours more triumphant and less mysterious. Edith was toasted again. Mr Dombey was again agreeably embarrassed. And Mr Carker {{was full of}} interest and praise.|$|R
60|$|He looked rather helplessly {{across the}} room. Few sights are so pathetic as the strong man of <b>yesterday</b> feeling <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{chair by the}} fire is a distant object to-day. Tommy knew how pathetic it was, but Grizel {{did not seem to}} know.|$|R

6000|$|... "The {{delay was}} a terrible {{nuisance}} at the time, but it has enabled you {{to come up here}} and warn us about Fadil. Fortunately no Dervishes came along while we were crossing, and indeed we learned, from the prisoners we took <b>yesterday,</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> fact that a force from Kassala had crossed the river was entirely unknown, so no harm was done." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; I {{noticed when}} I walked about in <b>the</b> town, <b>yesterday,</b> <b>that</b> many of <b>the</b> troops were almost in rags, and I {{have no doubt}} there has been fraud in the {{clothing}} department, {{as well as in}} all the others." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Not {{in a case}} of poisoning." [...] Mrs. Cavendish's clear voice startled me. [...] "Dr. Bauerstein {{was saying}} <b>yesterday</b> <b>that,</b> owing to <b>the</b> general ignorance of the more {{uncommon}} poisons among the medical profession, there were probably countless cases of poisoning quite unsuspected." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, madam, {{certainly}} not," [...] {{the sheriff}} replied; [...] "no one would suppose {{for a moment}} that Mrs. Wingfield of the Orangery would {{have anything to do with}} a runaway, but Mr. Jackson here learned only <b>yesterday</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> wife of this slave was here and everyone knows that where the wife is the husband is not likely to be far off." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{first thought}} that had broken in upon her {{after a brief}} and troubled sleep was that a brave young life would be sacrificed to-day to gratify the petty spite of a fiend. She had been persuaded <b>yesterday</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> man who--though {{helpless}} and pinioned--stood before her in all the splendour of manhood and of a magnificent personality {{was nothing but a}} common criminal--a liar, a forger and a thief.|$|E
6000|$|... "Let me consider," [...] he continued. [...] "It {{was about}} three, {{or a little}} after, <b>yesterday</b> {{afternoon}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> world finally entered the poison belt {{to the extent of}} being completely submerged.

60|$|This {{annoyance}} {{has made}} me endure the bad weather with even less than ordinary patience; and my faith was so far exhausted that, {{when they told me}} <b>yesterday</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> sun was setting clear, I would not even turn my eyes towards the west. But this morning I am made all over anew, and have no greater remnant of my cold than will serve as an excuse for doing no work to-day.|$|E
60|$|You will be perhaps {{surprised}} to hear that it is Morgan's conviction (his son was here <b>yesterday),</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> North will put down the South, and that speedily. In his management of his large business, he is proceeding steadily on that conviction. He says that the South has no money and no credit, and that it is impossible for it to make a successful stand. He may be all wrong, but he is certainly a very shrewd man, and he has never been, as to the United States, an enthusiast of any class.|$|E
60|$|I {{told you}} <b>yesterday</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{lower part of}} the glacier, as seen from La Flégère, {{appeared}} covered with dirt. I saw to-day the reason for this. Although it was a sultry day in July, yet around the glacier a continual high wind was blowing, whirling the dust and débris of the sides upon it. Some of the great masses of ice were so completely coated with sand as to appear at a distance like granite rocks. The effect of some of these immense brown masses was very peculiar. They seemed like an army of giants, bending forward, driven, as by an invisible power, down into the valley.|$|E
60|$|Last {{night she}} had {{hoped it would be}} spent as <b>yesterday</b> was, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> evening would be again passed with {{happiness}} and Robert.

Shall I try them? I'll write to Strachan tonight, if you like. And they aren't strong this year. We'll smash them. What do you say?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Mordaunt Hall gave Frankenstein a very {{positive}} review and said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> film [...] "aroused so much excitement at <b>the</b> Mayfair <b>yesterday</b> <b>that</b> many in <b>the</b> audience laughed to cover their true feelings." [...] "There is no denying that it is {{far and away the}} most effective thing of its kind. Beside it Dracula is tame and, incidentally, Dracula was produced by the same firm".|$|R
6000|$|... "This prophecy {{struck the}} heart of my father with such woe, that he never got over it, {{but that did not}} prevent him from {{attending}} carefully to my education till I attained, a short time ago, my fifteenth birthday. It was only <b>yesterday</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> news reached him that ten days previously the statue of brass had been thrown into the sea, and he at once set about hiding me in this underground chamber, which was built for the purpose, promising to fetch me out when the forty days have passed. For myself, I have no fears, as Prince Agib is not likely to come here to look for me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was only}} <b>yesterday</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> chance came. I may tell you that, besides Mr. Rucastle, both Toller {{and his wife}} find {{something}} to do in these deserted rooms, and I once saw him carrying a large black linen bag with him through the door. Recently he has been drinking hard, and yesterday evening he was very drunk; and when I came upstairs there was {{the key in the}} door. I have no doubt at all that he had left it there. Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle were both downstairs, and the child was with them, so that I had an admirable opportunity. I turned the key gently in the lock, opened the door, and slipped through.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Grenfell, reflectively, [...] "your {{action on}} one or two {{occasions}} seems to warrant the observation--I mean when you stood the boys off me after I'd spoiled their supper, and the other time when you decided on my account not to stay on at the copper-mine. Still, I want to say that while I seem to know I will not make another journey on the gold trail, I've had a subconscious feeling of certainty since sunrise <b>yesterday</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> lake lies just ahead of us. I know nothing definite that justifies it, but we'll probably find out to-morrow. There's just another thing. If I leave my bones up here my share falls to you." ...|$|E

5000|$|In The Albuquerque Journal of 29 December 1928 [...] (probably a reprint of {{an earlier}} article) it was {{reported}} “T. J.
