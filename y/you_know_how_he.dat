6000|$|... "Well; {{no wonder}} at that, if <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> has been laboring. The wonder is, whence {{he got the}} {{knowledge}} wherewith to labor; for he never saw sea-work to my remembrance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Didn't Evelyn {{join the}} party that went to welcome Jim?" [...] Bernard resumed. [...] "Rather a happy thought of Janet's! Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> {{impressed}} Evelyn?" ...|$|E

6000|$|It was no {{occasion}} for further affectation. 'I am SURE he will,' answered her niece flatly. 'I have {{not the least}} fear about it--nor would <b>you,</b> if <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> is. He will forgive me anything.' ...|$|R
60|$|My dear, <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> {{susceptible}} <b>he</b> is. There's {{always the}} possibility that he'll {{fall in love with}} someone who isn't very desirable.|$|R

6000|$|... "Stanley, don't touch him. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> sick <b>he's</b> been. He isn't himself. Let it pass. He's as sorry {{as any of}} us that it happened; aren't you, Tom?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Precisely of {{the kind}} with which Monsieur least likes to be pestered: an urgent summons to go {{directly}} to the Athénée, as there is an official visitor--inspector--I know not what--arrived, and Monsieur must meet him: <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> hates a must." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So it was--his {{watch on}} deck was his chronometer, I declare. I am forgetting {{a part of}} my education. Do you know the use of a chronometer, now, Rose? You have seen your uncle's often, but do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> used it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Poor Mr. Coon!' I cried, and I felt mighty sorry, for Bobby and I {{had always}} been good friends, though I must admit that he has some habits of which I don't approve. 'Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> {{happened}} to play in such hard luck, Mr. Crow?' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, {{he thinks}} it time--on all accounts--that <b>you</b> should <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> stands, and why he {{declined}} that proposition of yours. I must say he has behaved very well--like a gentleman." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, such {{a regular}} Bluebeard! Of course <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> treated another girl before he married Lady Alexandrina.

6000|$|... "It {{was just}} before he went away--bolted out, I should say. He nodded {{and pointed at the}} curtain to our room. He knew you were there, of course.

6000|$|... "Man, you're crazy!" [...] cried Brandt. [...] "He'd cut you {{to pieces}} before you'd {{have time to}} draw. He {{could give you a}} tomahawk, then take it away and split your head.

60|$|You, my reader, {{know the}} sincerity of Pilate's effort. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> tried to befool the mob, first by mocking Jesus as a {{harmless}} fool; and second by offering to release him according to the custom of releasing one prisoner at time of the Passover. And {{you know how the}} priests' quick whisperings led the mob to cry out for the release of the murderer Bar-Abba.|$|E
6000|$|... “They chased {{his young}} broods of {{speckled}} Sussex and drove two sitting hens off their nests, besides running {{all over the}} flower beds. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> devoted <b>he</b> is to his poultry and garden.” ...|$|R
