500|$|Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly {{gave the}} album B−. He felt that A New Day Has Come was [...] "over-arranged" [...] by producers, which works [...] "against Dion's {{enthusiasm for the}} wonders of babies and innocence." [...] Nevertheless, he praised the [...] "jaunty disco" [...] of [...] "Sorry for Love", and [...] "Have <b>You</b> <b>Ever</b> <b>Been</b> in Love" [...] which [...] "builds in {{intensity}} to sound like [...] "a James Bond movie theme as delivered by Barbra Streisand." [...] Tucker described [...] "Rain, Tax (It's Inevitable)" [...] as the most [...] "idiosyncratic" [...] and [...] "idiomatic" [...] song that Dion has ever recorded. According to the positive review from Mike Ross of Jam!, A New Day Has Come [...] "picks up where Falling into You left off." [...] Dion's album is a full of [...] "bombast, melodrama and soaring love ballads indistinguishable from anything she's ever done." [...] Attempts at modernity are [...] "spotty", though [...] "welcome". Ross noticed that ballads are the strongest tracks on the album and praised [...] "Goodbye's (The Saddest Word)", with [...] "two soaring key changes" [...] in the same song, which is then launched into a [...] "high Earth orbit of melodrama by an orchestra that would make John Williams blush with envy." [...] Barnes & Noble also gave the album favorable review and wrote that the new songs reveal a more [...] "spiritual" [...] and [...] "edgier" [...] Dion. They praised the [...] "uplifting" [...] title track, [...] "heartfelt, country-tinged" [...] "Goodbye's (The Saddest Word)", [...] "anthemic, gospel choir-accented ballad" [...] "Prayer", [...] "bluesy, honky-tonk rocker" [...] "Ten Days", [...] "soaring ballad" [...] "Have <b>You</b> <b>Ever</b> <b>Been</b> in Love", and [...] "solid renditions" [...] of [...] "Nature Boy" [...] and [...] "At Last".|$|E

500|$|HUAC {{achieved}} {{its greatest}} fame and notoriety with its {{investigation into the}} Hollywood film industry. In October 1947, the Committee began to subpoena screenwriters, directors, and other movie industry professionals to testify about their known or suspected membership in the Communist Party, association with its members, or support of its beliefs. It was at these testimonies that {{what became known as}} [...] "the $64,000 question" [...] was asked: [...] "Are you now or have <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> a member of the Communist Party of the United States?" [...] Among the first film industry witnesses subpoenaed by the Committee were ten who decided not to cooperate. These men, who became known as the [...] "Hollywood Ten", cited the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech and free assembly, which they believed legally protected them from being required to answer the Committee's questions. This tactic failed, and the ten were sentenced to prison for contempt of Congress. Two of the ten were sentenced to six months, the rest to a year.|$|E

Performing in Little Richard's ensemble band, he backed up vocalists Buddy and Stacy on [...] "Shotgun". The video recording of the show marks the earliest known footage of Hendrix performing. Richard and Hendrix often clashed over tardiness, wardrobe, and Hendrix's stage antics, and in late July, Richard's brother Robert fired him. He then briefly rejoined the Isley Brothers, and recorded a second single with them, [...] "Move Over and Let Me Dance" [...] backed with [...] "Have <b>You</b> <b>Ever</b> <b>Been</b> Disappointed". Later that year, he joined a New York-based R band, Curtis Knight and the Squires, after meeting Knight {{in the lobby of}} a hotel where both men were staying. Hendrix performed with them for eight months. In October 1965, he and Knight recorded the single, [...] "How Would You Feel" [...] backed with [...] "Welcome Home" [...] and on October 15, Hendrix signed a three-year recording contract with entrepreneur Ed Chalpin. While the relationship with Chalpin was short-lived, his contract remained in force, which later caused legal and career problems for Hendrix. During his time with Knight, Hendrix briefly toured with Joey Dee and the Starliters, and worked with King Curtis on several recordings including Ray Sharpe's two-part single, [...] "Help Me". Hendrix earned his first composer credits for two instrumentals, [...] "Hornets Nest" [...] and [...] "Knock Yourself Out", released as a Curtis Knight and the Squires single in 1966.|$|E

According to Taylor, Dion does not disappoint with ballads like the [...] "rafter-shaking" [...] "I Surrender" [...] where she sings of [...] "forbidden love amid a firestorm of utterly volcanic instrumentation" [...] and [...] "The Greatest Reward", and two standards – the [...] "diamond-dipped" [...] "Nature Boy" [...] and gospel [...] "At Last". He called the album the most [...] "versatile and gratifying" [...] Dion's recording yet. Larry Flick, also from Billboard wrote about another song, [...] "Have <b>You</b> <b>Ever</b> <b>Been</b> in Love" [...] that [...] "at a time when music is frightfully aggressive and {{the world at large}} is fraught with turmoil, a classic Dion power ballad is a warm source of comfort." [...] The track [...] "builds from a gentle, piano-laced opening into a deliciously theatrical, string-framed climax."
