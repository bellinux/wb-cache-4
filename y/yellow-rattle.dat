6000|$|On {{one such}} day they went out, as it chanced, into the meadows that stretch {{up the hill}} behind Brackenhurst. Frida remembered it well afterwards. It was the day when an annual saturnalia of vulgar vice usurps and pollutes the open downs at Epsom. Bertram did not care to see it, he said--the rabble of a great town turned loose to desecrate the open face of nature--even {{regarded}} {{as a matter of}} popular custom; he had looked on at much the same orgies before in New Guinea and on the Zambesi, and they only depressed him: so he stopped at Brackenhurst, and went for a walk instead in the fresh summer meadows. Robert Monteith, for his part, had gone to the Derby--so they call that orgy--and Philip had meant to accompany him in the dogcart, but remained behind at the last moment to take care of Frida; for Frida, being a lady at heart, always shrank from the pollution of vulgar assemblies. As they walked together across the lush green fields, thick with campion and <b>yellow-rattle,</b> they came to a dense copse with a rustic gate, above which a threatening notice-board frowned them straight in the face, bearing the usual selfish and anti-social inscription, [...] "Trespassers will be prosecuted." ...|$|E
50|$|Herbs include dyer's greenweed, saw-wort, adder's-tongue, common knapweed, betony {{and pepper}} saxifrage. <b>Yellow-rattle,</b> common spotted-orchid, sneezewort, cowslip and hoary {{plantain}} are also recorded.|$|E
50|$|Rhinanthus angustifolius or Greater <b>Yellow-rattle</b> is a Lamiales {{plant species}} of the genus Rhinanthus. It is an annual wildflower native to {{temperate}} grasslands in much of Europe, and north and central Western Asia. The yellow flowers are mostly visited by bumblebees.|$|E
50|$|Some {{of these}} fields are pasture {{and others are}} hay meadows, and they display ridges and furrows from medieval ploughing. They are a type of neutral {{grassland}} which is declining nationally. Flowers include cowslips and <b>yellow-rattles,</b> and there are fauna such as green woodpeckers and great crested newts.|$|R
50|$|The meadow is old {{ridge and}} furrow {{grassland}} {{which has been}} traditionally managed. The dominant grasses are Common Bent, Red Fescue, Crested Dog’s-tail and Yorkshire Fog. Flowering herbs include Cowslip, Pepper Saxifrage, <b>Yellow-rattle,</b> Ox-eye Daisy, Great Burnet, the Green-winged Orchid and Corky-fruited Water Dropwort.|$|E
50|$|The site is {{a sloping}} dry chalk bank, which has {{a wide variety of}} plants, {{butterflies}} and birds. Plants include the pyramidal and man orchids, and the greater <b>yellow-rattle,</b> which is rare nationally. Over 100 species of moth and 36 of butterfly have been recorded. It also has scrub with wild privet, dogwood and the wayfaring tree. Sheep graze on the grassland as part of the Surrey Downs Project.|$|E
50|$|Fuller {{information}} {{is available from the}} Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust nature reserves handbook. Typical woodland flowers include bluebell, wood anemone, early-purple orchid, primrose, ramsons (wood garlic), common dog-violet and yellow archangel. Uncommon species are meadow saffron, herb-paris, common cow-wheat, bitter-vetch and violet helleborine. The grassy rides support betony, devil's-bit scabious, saw-wort, common spotted-orchid, greater knapweed, greater butterfly-orchid, cowslip and <b>yellow-rattle.</b> The damper rides supports lesser spearwort, ragged-robin, marsh ragwort, brooklime and various sedges and rushes.|$|E
50|$|Farthing Downs is a {{long strip}} of {{grassland}} with pockets of ancient woodland, which narrows to a point at the northern end. It is the most extensive area of semi-natural downland left in Greater London. Its chalk and natural grasslands have a large variety of rare herbs, including some which are nationally scarce, such as the wildflower greater <b>yellow-rattle.</b> This is specially protected by legislation and Farthing Downs and Happy Valley have the {{major part of the}} British population.|$|E
50|$|The {{range of}} plants is wide and {{includes}} bee orchid, horseshoe vetch and chalk milkwort. The site supports an abundant population of pyramidal orchids. Typical plants which flourish {{on the site}} are cowslip, salad burnet, common rock-rose, <b>yellow-rattle,</b> burnet-saxifrage, oxeye daisy, spring-sedge (Carex caryophyllea) and marjoram. Grasses include upright brome, quaking-grass, sweet vernal-grass, crested hair-grass, yellow oat-grass and sheep's fescue. Tor-grass is dominant but in small areas. Devil's-bit scabious is present on the lower slopes. Sainfoin has entered the site from surrounding fields.|$|E
50|$|The meadows {{support a}} show of {{thousands}} (estimated at 45,000) of green-winged orchid in May, a colony of some size {{in this part of}} Gloucestershire. Also flowering in the late spring are common twayblade, adder's-tongue, cowslip, bluebell, and pignut. Taller grass and flowers develop over the summer and produce a haycrop at that time. Recordings include quaking-grass, common knapweed, meadow vetchling, downy oat-grass, field scabious, meadow buttercup, <b>yellow-rattle,</b> oxeye daisy, common bird's-foot trefoil, goat's-beard, fairy flax and Devil's-bit scabious. Meadow saffron flowers following the hay cut.|$|E
50|$|Belshaw is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) in Lincolnshire, England. It lies to {{the west}} of the village of Belton in the Isle of Axholme. The site, which was {{designated}} a SSSI in 1988, is a short length of land along a disused railway line and is important because it supports a colony of greater <b>yellow-rattle.</b> This ia a nationally rare plant which receives special protection under Schedule 8 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act, 1981. Once widely distributed, this species is now known to occur at only six localities in Great Britain.|$|E
40|$|Targeted {{introduction}} of <b>Yellow-rattle</b> (Rhinanthus minor) {{has been suggested}} as a method to assist diversification of species-poor grassland. Here, we report results from a study carried out in species-poor grassland established via natural regeneration at a calcareous ex-arable site. In particular, we explored short-term effects of soil scarification and sowing of R. minor on plant species richness and composition. Our results indicated a negative short-term effect of high Rhinanthus densities on the richness of dicot forbs. Scarification increased forb richness, but did so primarily by stimulating arable species present in the seed bank. Several characteristic forbs of calcareous grassland that were already present in the vegetation were negatively affected by the techniques used, emphasizing the point that restoration techniques should be assessed {{not only in terms}} of their impact on target species establishment, but also in terms of their effects on non-target species and whole plant assemblages...|$|E
