60|$|MRS GEORGE [rising promptly] Oh, indeed. Then <b>youre</b> <b>not</b> {{coming home}} with me, young man. I'm sorry; for its {{refreshing}} {{to have met}} once in my life a man who wasnt frightened by my wedding ring; but I'm looking out for a friend and not for a French marquis; so <b>youre</b> <b>not</b> coming home with me.|$|E
60|$|TARLETON. Youre {{afraid of}} getting the sack; but <b>youre</b> <b>not</b> afraid to shoot yourself.|$|E

5000|$|In the DS9 episode [...] "Q-Less", Q at {{one point}} goads Commander Benjamin Sisko into a bare-knuckle boxing match, all the while belittling and {{insulting}} him. When Sisko loses his temper and knocks Q down, an astonished Q says, [...] "You hit me! Picard never hit me!" [...] Sisko counters frankly that [...] "Im not Picard." [...] Q responds with a smile, saying, [...] "Indeed <b>not,</b> <b>youre</b> much easier to provoke.". While on the station, Q gives hints to help the crew keep their station from being destroyed by an artifact that has been brought aboard it.|$|R
5000|$|Although Reddys eighth studio album Music, Music (1976) {{had been}} {{certified}} gold, its second single release [...] "Gladiola" [...] had been Reddys first Billboard Hot 100 shortfall since her 1971 Hot 100 debut with [...] "I Dont Know How to Love Him" [...] (of Reddys fifteen 1971-76 Hot 100 entries {{all but two}} had reached the Top 20 affording her ten Top 20 hits). Jeff Wald, then Reddys husband and manager, would state in 1977: [...] "Helen has enough hits to be established in the public mind...but it still shakes you when <b>youre</b> suddenly <b>not</b> on the charts". Wald therefore had not wanted Reddys ninth studio album to be (quote) [...] "just another Helen Reddy album: I {{let it be known}} on the street that whoever came to me with the right material, with a hit song, was going to produce Helen Reddy"..."I wanted hit singles and something a little different":"I called every publisher in town: listened to 800-900 songs";"I let a dozen producers walk into this office and play me a song. I called Kim Fowley and let him know I would like to hear from him, what his ideas were and of all the guys who walked into my office he had the most material that I liked":"He played me five songs, four of which I liked immediately".|$|R
60|$|MRS GEORGE [to Hotchkiss, {{pointing}} to the study] Go in there, you. <b>Youre</b> <b>not</b> wanted here.|$|E
60|$|PERCIVAL. It {{also makes}} {{everybody}} {{pretend not to}} believe it. Mrs Tarleton: <b>youre</b> <b>not</b> playing the game.|$|E
60|$|LINA. Pray instead: dont cry. Why {{should you}} cry? <b>Youre</b> <b>not</b> the first I've said no to.|$|E
5000|$|... "We {{have got}} {{a bit of a}} reputation. I had a {{conversation}} with Noel Gallagherat a party once and said to him, Im in a band but its the most uncool band in the world - Marillion. He went, Yeah, <b>youre</b> right. Deadpan! <b>Not</b> even smiling." [...] —Keyboardist Mark Kelly The chief music critic of The Guardian, Alexis Petridis, has described Marillion as [...] "perennially unfashionable prog-rockers". On the subject of joining the band in 1989, Steve Hogarth said in a 2001 interview: [...] "At about the same time, Matt Johnson of The The asked me to play piano on his tour. I always say I had to make a choice between the most hip band in the world, and the least." [...] In the same conversation, he claimed: [...] "Were just tired of the opinions of people who havent heard anything weve done in ten years. A lot of whats spread about this band is laughable." ...|$|R

60|$|MITCHENER. I trust <b>youre</b> <b>not</b> ringing for the police, Mrs. Farrell. I {{assure you}} Im {{perfectly}} sane.|$|E
60|$|MRS WARREN [staring at her] Of course: until youre married. <b>Youre</b> <b>not</b> {{going back}} to college again.|$|E
60|$|LORD SUMMERHAYS. <b>Youre</b> <b>not</b> {{the first}} to fall today under the lash of that young lady's terrible derision, Bentley.|$|E
60|$|REGINALD. Well, dont let me detain you, old chap. When {{you start}} calling people Sir, <b>youre</b> <b>not</b> {{particularly}} good company.|$|E
60|$|FANNY. Oh, I {{know all}} about that; but you cant {{understand}} what it means to Papa. <b>Youre</b> <b>not</b> so innocent as he is.|$|E
6000|$|REGINALD. <b>Youre</b> <b>not</b> {{going to}} speak to me again, anyhow, are you? Do you suppose I'm going to visit you when you marry him? ...|$|E
60|$|THE PARLOR MAID. Well, {{of course}} <b>youre</b> <b>not</b> in earnest, sir. But it does set one thinking, {{especially}} {{when one is}} going to be married.|$|E
60|$|MRS BRIDGENORTH. Stuff, Sinjon! Of course {{people must}} get married. [Uneasily] Alfred: why dont you say something? Surely <b>youre</b> <b>not</b> {{going to let}} this go on.|$|E
60|$|COLLINS. Excuse me, sir; but do {{you stay}} to breakfast? Your name is {{on one of the}} covers; and I should like to change it if <b>youre</b> <b>not</b> remaining.|$|E
6000|$|JOHNNY. So I say. It's {{really a}} great {{encouragement}} to me to find you agree with me. For of course if nobody agrees with you, how are {{you to know that}} <b>youre</b> <b>not</b> a fool? ...|$|E
60|$|MRS TARLETON. Oh, you are tiresome. As if {{it mattered}} to anyone what you saw. Me! A married woman {{that might be}} your mother. [To Lina] And I'm sure <b>youre</b> <b>not</b> particular, if youll excuse my saying so.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course: {{that is what}} I meant. Confound it, here we are already. You mustnt come in, {{you would}} only be in the way. Come to-night after the burlesque, if you like. <b>Youre</b> <b>not</b> angry with me, are you?" ...|$|E
60|$|BENTLEY. If you go {{on doing}} it after Ive asked you not, youll feel an awful swine. [He strolls away {{carelessly}} to the sideboard with {{his eye on the}} sponge cakes]. At least I should; but I suppose <b>youre</b> <b>not</b> so particular.|$|E
60|$|HOTCHKISS. I hope so. Surely <b>youre</b> <b>not</b> {{going to}} be vindictive, Rejjy. Besides, youll have all the {{advantages}} I formerly enjoyed. Youll be the visitor, the relief, the new face, the fresh news, the hopeless attachment: I shall only be the husband.|$|E
6000|$|MITCHENER (outraged). Attention. Speak {{when youre}} spoken to. Hold your tongue when <b>youre</b> <b>not.</b> Right about face. March. (The Orderly obeys.) Thats {{the way to}} keep these chaps up to the mark. (The Orderly returns.) Back again! What {{do you mean by}} this mutiny? ...|$|E
6000|$|TARLETON. <b>Youre</b> <b>not.</b> Youre {{laughing}} at me. Serve me right! Parents and children! No man should know his own child. No child should know its own father. Let the family be rooted out of civilization! Let {{the human race}} be brought up in institutions! ...|$|E
60|$|SIR PATRICK. No: {{about your}} behavior. Theres {{nothing wrong with}} your spine; and theres nothing wrong with your heart; but theres {{something}} wrong with your common sense. <b>Youre</b> <b>not</b> going to die; but you may be {{going to make a}} fool of yourself. So be careful.|$|E
60|$|BOBBY. [hastily] No. I {{never said}} that. It might even give a woman a greater claim on a man. Any girl, {{if she were}} thoughtless and a bit on, perhaps, might get into a scrape. Anyone who really {{understood}} her character could see there was no harm in it. But <b>youre</b> <b>not</b> the larky sort. At least you usent to be.|$|E
60|$|B. B. Overwork! Theres no such thing. I do {{the work}} of ten men. Am I giddy? No. NO. If <b>youre</b> <b>not</b> well, you have a disease. It may be a slight one; but it's a disease. And what is a disease? The lodgment in the system of a {{pathogenic}} germ, and the multiplication of that germ. What is the remedy? A very simple one. Find the germ and kill it.|$|E
60|$|DORA. Well, old dear, {{he wants}} me; and thats {{about the long}} and short of it. And I must say <b>youre</b> <b>not</b> very nice to me about it. Ive talked to him like a mother, and tried my best to keep him straight; but I dont deny I like a bit of fun myself; and we both get a bit giddy when we're lighthearted. Him and me is a pair, I'm afraid.|$|E
60|$|LOUIS. Yes, why not? Lots {{of people}} do it: just as good people as you. Why dont you learn to think, instead of bleating and bashing {{like a lot of}} sheep when you come up against {{anything}} <b>youre</b> <b>not</b> accustomed to? [Contemplating their amazed faces with a chuckle] I say: I should like to draw the lot of you now: you do look jolly foolish. Especially you, Ridgeon. I had you that time, you know.|$|E
60|$|THE SHERIFF. Go easy there. Youre a smart boy, Strapper; but <b>youre</b> <b>not</b> Sheriff yet. This is my job. You just wait. I {{submit that}} we're in a {{difficulty}} here. If Blanco was the man, the lady cant, {{as a white}} woman, give him away. She oughtnt {{to be put in}} the position of having either to give him away or commit perjury. On the other hand, we don't want a horse-thief to get off through a lady's delicacy.|$|E
60|$|JUGGINS. I have noticed, sir, that Denmark Hill {{thinks that}} the higher {{you go in the}} social scale, the less sincerity is allowed; and that only tramps and riff-raff are quite sincere. Thats a mistake. Tramps are often shameless; but theyre never sincere. Swells--if I may use that {{convenient}} name for the upper classes--play much more with their cards on the table. If you tell the young lady that you want to jilt her, and she calls you a pig, the tone of the transaction may leave much to be desired; but itll be less Camberwellian than if you say <b>youre</b> <b>not</b> worthy.|$|E
6000|$|TARLETON. Good. Well, do {{you like}} me? Dont {{misunderstand}} me: I'm perfectly aware that <b>youre</b> <b>not</b> going {{to fall in love}} at first sight with a ridiculous old shopkeeper. I cant help that ridiculous old shopkeeper. I have to carry him about with me whether I like it or not. I have to pay for his clothes, though I hate the cut of them: especially the waistcoat. I have to look at him in the glass while I'm shaving. I loathe him because hes a living lie. My soul's not like that: it's like yours. I want to make a fool of myself. About you. Will you let me? ...|$|E
60|$|BOBBY. Well, I dont {{think you}} can fairly hold me to it, Meg. Of course it would be ridiculous for me to set up to be shocked, or {{anything}} of that sort. I cant afford to throw stones at anybody; and I dont pretend to. I can understand a lark; I can forgive a slip; {{as long as it}} is understood that it is only a lark or a slip. But to go on the loose on principle; to talk about religion in connection with it; to--to--well, Meg, I do find that a bit thick, I must say. I hope <b>youre</b> <b>not</b> in earnest when you talk that way.|$|E
