50|$|When {{the enemy}} is {{superior}} in numbers and your situation is such that you expect to be overrun at any moment, then drop all pretense of military preparedness, act calmly and taunt the enemy, so that the enemy will {{think you have a}} huge ambush hidden for them.

This ploy is only successful if in most cases <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> powerful hidden force and only sparsely use the empty fort strategy.|$|E

He condemned the protest, stating: [...] "we have not seen this sort of behaviour for some considerable time… it was thuggery, it was disgraceful, and we are determined to find responsible for vandalism." [...] He further warned that [...] "the likelihood is for more disorder on our streets. We must be prepared for it." [...] He was criticised by Jenny Jones, a Green Party member of the London Assembly, who told him: [...] "when you imprison thousands of people, which is essentially what you did yesterday, <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> duty of care to them... You kept people for nine-and-a-half hours. You punished innocent people for going on a protest." ...|$|E
50|$|For Live Shows, Martin {{performed}} “Walk Like An Egyptian” by The Bangles. Blake Shelton {{commented on}} her performance, “I {{think you did}} {{as good as you}} could do with that song.

You can take any song and make it amazing. <b>You</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> very unique and special voice.” However, Christina Aguilera thought that Martin should have done more. The next day, during the Result Show, Carson Daly announced that Martin is in the bottom 3 alongside Tony Vincent and Cheesa. Martin performed “Your Song” by Sir Elton John for the Last Chance performance to convince Cee Lo Green that he should save her and should not eliminate her. Cee Lo Green chose to save Cheesa. Martin was eliminated from the show on April 11, 2012 - together with Tony Vincent.|$|E

5000|$|Stephen Poole of GameSpot gave Front Page Sports: Baseball Pro '98 an 8 out of 10, commenting that [...] "But {{just as with}} Sierra's Football Pro games, arcade-style play is {{not this}} game's strong point. The graphics, {{at least from the}} batter-pitcher perspective, are {{certainly}} decent - until you notice there's no option for a pitcher-batter perspective, and that, with the exception of skin tone, all the players are generic in the way they look, the way they step up to the plate, and the way they swing. On the up side, <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> nice variety of managerial options available in the hands-on mode, as well as extensive control over pitching (type, location, speed) and batting (type of swing and area to look for the pitch). The game looks and feels a lot like real baseball - the animations are dead-on without looking canned and the ball physics seem to be about right." ...|$|E
5000|$|Andy Webb from [...] "The Movie Scene" [...] {{gave the}} film {{three out of}} five stars, stating: [...] "What this all boils down to is that [...] "The Rats" [...] is some old {{fashioned}} horror fun which plays on people's own fears of rats. Of course if you think rats are cute and adorable then this isn't {{going to work and}} you might even be offended at the portrayal of rats or the ridiculous climax. But if <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> fear of the fury rodents this movie is not one to watch before you go to sleep." [...] Rod Lott from [...] "Flick Attack", wrote: [...] "Come up with a cliché, and sooner or later, The Rats gets to it, right down to the ever-predictable it-ain’t-really-over final shot. Child’s Play 2 and Man’s Best Friend director John Lafia does a decent job, having experience with all sorts of beasts, like killer dolls, robot dogs and Ally Sheedy." [...] Florita A. from [...] "Hell Horror", scored the film 4 out of 10, writing: [...] "The Rats was made simple, and that was not an ideal thing as the movie flopped although it was a TV movie. I like the idea of rats playing on someone’s fear, but it came down to the film not being executed in the right manner to send frights across to its audience amongst other things." ...|$|E
