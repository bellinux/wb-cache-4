[...] However, many cemeteries require that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>such</b> a container so that the grave will not sink in. [...] Either a grave liner or a burial vault will satisfy these requirements”.|$|E
2500|$|Shrimpton {{believes}} that the apparent indifference of earlier authors {{was due to the}} general hatred by other Greeks against the Thebans who had medized (i.e. allied with the Persians) in the second Persian invasion in 480 BC and again in 368 BC. Athenians, in particular, held a special contempt for Thebes due to the latter's actions in the Peloponnesian War; as well as the Thebans' destruction of Plataea in 373 BC, and the invasion of the Athenian-allied Boeotian city of Oropus in 366 BC. Demosthenes records this sentiment very clearly in a disclaimer in his speech On the Navy (354 BC): [...] "It is difficult to speak to you about , because <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>such</b> a hearty dislike of them that you would not care to hear any good of them, even if it were true." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1979, Biafra ran for mayor of San Francisco, using the Jell-O ad {{campaign}} catchphrase, [...] "There's always room for Jello", as his campaign slogan. Having entered the race before creating a campaign platform, Biafra later wrote his platform on a napkin while attending a Pere Ubu concert where Dead Kennedys drummer Ted told Biafra, [...] "Biafra, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>such</b> a big mouth that you should run for Mayor." [...] As he campaigned, Biafra wore campaign T-shirts from his opponent Quentin Kopp's previous campaign {{and at one point}} vacuumed leaves off the front lawn of another opponent, current U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein, to mock her publicity stunt of sweeping streets in downtown San Francisco for a few hours. He also made a whistlestop campaign tour along the BART line. Supporters committed equally odd actions; two well known signs held by supporters said [...] "If he doesn't win I'll kill myself" [...] and [...] "What if he does win?" ...|$|E

2500|$|No direct {{orders to}} commit atrocities by Milošević {{have ever been}} discovered, though little or no effort was made by Milošević to punish people deemed {{responsible}} for such atrocities, including Ratko Mladić who, after being accused of allowing atrocities to occur against Croats in Vukovar, was sent to lead the Army of the Republika Srpska, in which capacity Mladić was accused of ordering atrocities, including the murder of thousands of Bosniak men and boys in Srebrenica. Even after the reports of Srebrenica were released, Milošević refused to accept that Mladić {{was responsible for the}} crimes he was accused of. Wesley Clark, {{who was a member of}} the US team that helped negotiate the 1995 peace agreement ending the Bosnian War, claimed in his testimony during the trial of Milošević that Milošević had prior knowledge of the Srebrenica massacre and knew of Mladić's plans. During the negotiations, Clark had asked Milošević: 'Mr. President, you say you have so much influence over the Bosnian Serbs, but how is it then, if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>such</b> influence, that you allowed General Mladić to kill all those people in Srebrenica?' with Milošević answering: 'Well, General Clark... I warned Mladić not to do this, but he didn't listen to me.'" ...|$|E
