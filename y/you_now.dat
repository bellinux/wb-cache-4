5|$|November 27, 1888: Petition {{from the}} King of Rurutu and the Queen of Rimatara and their nobles to Her Most Gracious Majesty Queen Victoria, {{and to the}} Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. May you have good health. We, Teuruarii, King of Rurutu and Te Maere, Queen of Rimatara and our nobles, ask for the Prime Minister to place our islands and our ships under the {{protection}} of the British flag. These are the islands, namely, Rurutu, Rimatara, and Marià, and there are the names of the ships: Faaito and Ronui, and the masters of the same are natives. This is our word to you: Do not forsake us; we are your children; you taught us the word of God, and that has led us in the path of civilisation; therefore we know that you are a good parent to us. The thoughts of the children cling fondly to their good parent; they do not wish to be separated from their good parent. If the parent forsake the children, the children will seek the parent; so do we; we are like those children, and we ask that you will give us your flag to protect us. We have heard that you have taken Rarotonga and the neighbouring islands under your protection, but we remain without anyone to protect us. When we received the news that Rarotonga and the neighbouring islands were placed under your protection, we wept aloud because we were forsaken by you; we were afraid lest we should be adopted by another parent. The strange parent we mean is the French. They did not feed us with the milk of the gospel, but you did. O Great Britain; you fed us with that milk which has given life to us. This is our last word to you; we do not wish for French annexation or protection, not at all, but we wish you to be our parent, O Great Britain. We pray <b>you</b> <b>now</b> to accede to this our request. This letter was written in the house of Queen Pa. -TEURUARII, TE MAERE ARII.|$|E

25|$|Brooks {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} in Phillip Hayes Dean's play Paul Robeson. Brooks portrayed {{the life of}} the famous singer, actor, and civil rights activist in a one-man, critically acclaimed biographical drama. He has performed the role since 1982 at the Westwood Playhouse in Los Angeles, the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., and the Longacre Theater on Broadway. He also portrayed Robeson in Are <b>You</b> <b>Now</b> Or Have You Ever Been?, both on and Off-Broadway.|$|E
25|$|Brooks' early theater {{credits include}} The Offering, A PHOTOGRAPH: A Study of Cruelty, and Are <b>You</b> <b>Now</b> or Have You Ever Been in the 1970s. He started to gain {{recognition}} after his appearance in Spell #7 at the Public/Anspache Theater in New York City in 1979. He subsequently starred in Othello at the Folger Shakespeare Festival (1985) and Fences at the Repertory Theater of St. Louis, Missouri (1990). He reprised {{the role of}} Othello at the Washington Shakespeare Theater in 1990-1991.|$|E

25|$|None of us {{can ever}} forget how in that last Easter Sunday of his life, the Holy Father, marked by suffering, came once more to {{the window of the}} Apostolic Palace and one last time gave his blessing Urbi et Orbi. We can be sure that our beloved pope is {{standing}} today at the window of the Father's house that he sees us and blesses us. Yes, bless us, Holy Father. We entrust your dear soul to the Mother of God, your Mother, who guided you each day and who will guide <b>you</b> <b>now</b> to the eternal glory of her Son, our Lord Jesus Christ.|$|E
25|$|Of course, many conjectural {{decisions}} were made, {{such as the}} precise locations of the exterior doors and the size and locations of the windows. On the interior, {{the location of the}} staircase to the loft and the form of the large open hearths and built-in bed box also involved conjecture, but were based on historical precedent. In the original Brooklyn Museum installation, there were two bed boxes on the exterior wall of the north room. When the house was moved to its present location in 2006, it was decided that if the house did have a bed box it more logically was on an interior wall next to the hearth as <b>you</b> <b>now</b> will see it.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} no designs made for this {{elevation}} (Bedford Avenue), but the aim has been to have a central tower on the same axis as that on Flatbush Avenue, through the archway {{in the base of}} which will be afforded a view of the ‘quad’ with its greensward, trees, shrubs and vines. What the ultimate design of the various buildings going to make up the group may be, it is, of course, impossible to say, but in designing and planning that portion which <b>you</b> <b>now</b> see approaching completion, I have always intended that the whole should be a graphic illustration of the various phases of the so-called Gothic movement, from the Round Arch to the Flamboyant and on through its later transitional stage.|$|E

Cosimo wrote desperate missives to the Electress Palatine: [...] "I can tell <b>you</b> <b>now,</b> in case you are not informed, {{that we have no}} money in Florence..."
