He also learned the Highland pipes - it is rare to master both instruments, with their very different fingering and sound. He was perhaps the last piper to have known the playing of the Cloughs directly. He described Tom Clough's set of exercises, which he said were similar to G.G. Armstrong's. They consisted of scales and arpeggios - the pupil would have to start slowly, and increase speed till mistakes happened. Another group of exercises, based on variation sets, are all found in the four tunes Fenwick of Bywell, Jacky Layton, Felton Lonnen and Oh dear, what can the matter be. He also gave a description of Tom Clough's meticulous teaching technique: He made you break a tune down and play it bar by bar. If there was a bar bothering you, you played that bar until you got it right. Then you put the bars together, then put the measure together, and then eventually the tune together.

After Mercedes' {{stalking}} of Mitzeee, Stephen went on to say: [...] "No one could deny that Mercedes has had one heck of an exciting life. Siege victim, kidnap victim, depressive, stalker..." [...] Stephen urged Mercedes to realise that [...] "there are other guys in the world apart from Riley. True, you've had them all, but <b>you</b> <b>could</b> simply <b>start</b> going round the circuit again". She added that Mercedes does not have much to lose in her life. After her stalking of Mitzeee, Mercedes went on to stab herself, on this Carena Crawford of All About Soap said the episode itself was a [...] "huge shocker" [...] due to Mercedes' actions. Crawford added that when Mercedes realises she will be blamed for knocking Mitzeee unconscious she sees the knife and [...] "mad Mercedes {{came up with the}} perfect plan and we winced as she plunged the blade into her own stomach, knowing everyone would think Mitzeee did it! So now manipulative Mercedes has the upper hand over her rival [...] After all, who’d suspect anyone of stabbing themselves – very few people are warped enough to do that".|$|R

[...] "But I don't think they'll totally close the door on John Black" [...] Hogestyn suspected. A year later, though he was happy with Roman, Hogestyn said he initially wanted to find success in his own role instead of a recast. The actor later admitted that he never thought of himself as a recast [...] "because I played five months as John Black before they told me I was Roman."

[...] A minute later, Hutchinson had made no attempt to descend, but had made verbal confirmation of his cleared altitude of 9,000 feet. ATC prompted Hutchinson to descend by reaffirming his clearance, but Hutchinson replied by stating again that he had a problem.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Graph {{theory is}} a part of {{mathematics}} that has many practical applications. The study of graph theory began in 1736 with Leonard Euler’s work on the Konigsberg bridge problem. Konigsberg was a city built on a river with two islands and seven bridges. The question was posed as to whether <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>start</b> anywhere, cross each bridge exactly once, and end up at the starting point. Other problems that arise include scheduling routes for transportation systems that meet certain requirements such as distance, time, places stopped, and profits; and choosing the best times for replacement of equipment and the best type to use—what brand, new or used—to make operations more efficient. The focus of this paper will be on the algorithms used for optimizing problems. It will cover the uses of these algorithms and why they are used, as well as touching on how each one works. B. S.

40|$|This {{chapter is}} a little more “classic ” than the others. It {{introduces}} calculus of vari-ations, an elegant field not often covered in modern math curricula. A knowledge of multivariable calculus will suffice, but it helps to also have a familiarity with differential equations. This chapter covers more material than can be covered in a week of classes. If you want to dedicate only a week of time to this chapter, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>start</b> by motivating the material with a few examples that require minimizing a functional (Section 14. 1). Afterward, you may move on to the Euler–Lagrange equation and the Beltrami identity (Section 14. 2). Finally, finish the week by solving the problems listed in Section 14. 1, including the classic brachistochrone problem (Section 14. 4). Covering the rest of the material in this chapter will easily require a second and maybe even a third week. However, the level of difficulty remains constant through the chapter, there being no advanced sections. Several sections study the properties of cycloids, the solutions to the brachistochrone problem: the tautochrone property is detailed in Section 14. 6, and Huygens’s isochronou...|$|E

You know, you get married (to an occupation) and live happily ever after. Well, that’s not true of career development any more than it is of other things.

40|$|New {{curricula}} in UK, US and Australia aim {{to introduce}} computational thinking into every school. Computational Thinking (CT) teaches {{how to solve}} problems by borrowing techniques used in computer science to design programs: problem decomposition, pattern recognition, pattern generalization to define abstractions or models and algorithm design. An algorithm is a sequence of steps, decisions and repetitions to complete a task. A common approach to introduce CT and algorithms is by exposing primary students to visual programs such as Scratch or Kodu. These tools are engaging and they successfully teach students to develop simple algorithms. However, not all primary school teachers are familiar with them, {{and they may have}} constraints both in the access to school computers and the lack of time to upskill. Thus, we propose to support/complement visual programming with flowcharts, as they use plain English, require only pen and paper and can be applied to multiple subjects of the primary school curriculum. Flowcharts are a good introduction to CT, as <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>start</b> with simple step-by-step procedures, and gradually introduce decisions, branches and repetition. In this paper we will review ways to incorporate CT with flowcharts into the primary school curriculum that is aligned with the ACARA Digital Technologies curriculum's content descriptions for algorithms at years F- 6.

It meant that you were finding the analytical equivalent of the bunnies in the clouds, poring over data until you found something. Everyone knew that if you did enough poring, you were bound to find that bunny sooner or later, but it was no more real than the one that blows over the horizon. Now, data mining is a small industry, with entire companies devoted to it. 1 There are academic conferences devoted solely to data mining. The phrase no longer elicits as many invitations to step into the parking lot as it used to. What’s going on? These new data mining people are not fools. Sometimes data mining makes sense, and sometimes it doesn’t. The new data miners pore over large, diffuse sets of raw data trying to discern patterns that would otherwise go undetected. This can be a good thing. Suppose a big copier company has thousands of service locations all over the world. It wouldn’t be unusual for any one of them to see a particular broken component from any particular copier. These gadgets do fail.

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{downloadable}} games is nothing new. Small free games {{have been available}} for download for many years. As a revenue-producing section of the industry though, Web and Downloadable games have come into their own {{over the past couple}} years. One of the places this is most apparent is at the annual Game Developers Conference, held in March in California. When our group was forming in 2000 and 2001, few people seemed to understand what web/downloadable titles were about. At GDC 2002 more people understood the market, and from the buzz <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>start</b> to see that this might become {{a significant portion of the}} game industry. At GDC 2003, Web and Downloadable games had a bit of a coming out party. There were numerous sessions devoted to the format, lots of developers creating these titles, and quite a few successful companies making the rest of the industry take notice. As of this writing we are getting close to GDC 2004 and it is very easy to see that the Web and Downloadable games industry is transitioning from the early growth stages of the past few years, and starting to become a more mature marketplace. Several publishers and developers have found profitable and scalable business models, and have even begun leveraging their titles onto other platforms. We are seeing higher quality games, with more time and effort put towards their development. In a similar vein, this paper is evolving from those of previous years.
