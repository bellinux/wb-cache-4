25|$|European hornets {{have been}} given a {{reputation}} for being very aggressive. Evidence to support this is from the first documented instance by Davis of V. crabro parasitizing the <b>yellow</b> <b>garden</b> <b>spider</b> Argiope aurantia. Davis observed the hornets in Georgia fly into the spider’s web and appear entangled. Looking closer, the hornet was cutting free prey that had been caught by the spider’s web. The spider did not attack or interfere with V. crabro as it was stealing its prey. This also follows the trait that is observed in most vespines that as the year progresses, they change their food-seeking techniques from foraging for food to scavenging, especially once the fall season begins. A common scavenging technique in the fall consists of Vespines loitering around a garbage can, which is why they are regarded as pests in some areas.|$|E

50|$|<b>Yellow</b> <b>garden</b> <b>spiders</b> breed twice a year. The males roam {{in search}} of a female, {{building}} a small web near or actually in the female's web, then court the females by plucking strands on her web. Often, when the male approaches the female, he has a safety drop line ready, in case she attacks him. The male uses the palpal bulbs on his pedipalps to transfer sperm to the female. After inserting the second palpal bulb, the male dies, and is sometimes then eaten by the female.|$|R

50|$|One {{feature of}} the webs of some orb-weavers is the stabilimentum, a {{crisscross}} band of silk {{through the center of}} the web. It is found in a number of genera, but Argiope, the <b>yellow</b> and banded <b>garden</b> <b>spiders</b> of North America, is a prime example. The band has been hypothesized to be a lure for prey, a marker to warn birds away from the web, and a camouflage for the spider when it sits in the center of the web. However, recent research suggests the stabilimentum actually decreases the visibility of the silk to insects, thus making it harder for prey to avoid the web. The orb-web consists of a frame and supporting radii overlaid with a sticky capture spiral, and the silks used by orb-weaver spiders have exceptional mechanical properties to withstand the impact of flying prey.|$|R

5000|$|The spider species Argiope aurantia is {{commonly}} known as the <b>yellow</b> <b>garden</b> <b>spider,</b> black and <b>yellow</b> <b>garden</b> <b>spider,</b> golden garden spider, writing spider, corn spider, or McKinley spider. It is common to the contiguous United States, Hawaii, southern Canada, Mexico, and Central America. It has distinctive yellow and black markings on the abdomen and a mostly white cephalothorax. Its scientific Latin name translates to [...] "gilded silver-face" [...] (the genus name Argiope meaning [...] "silver-face", while the specific epithet aurantia means [...] "gilded"). Males range from 5 - 9 mm; females range from 19 - 28 mm. These spiders may bite if disturbed or harassed, but the venom is seemingly harmless to humans.|$|E

50|$|The web of the <b>yellow</b> <b>garden</b> <b>spider</b> is distinctive: a {{circular}} shape up to 2 feet (60 cm) in diameter, with a dense zigzag of silk, {{known as a}} stabilimentum, in the center. The purpose of the stabilimentum is disputed. It is possible that it acts as camouflage for the spider lurking in the web's center, {{but it may also}} attract insect prey, or even warn birds of the presence of the otherwise difficult-to-see web. Only those spiders that are active during the day construct stabilimenta in their webs.To construct the web, several radial lines are stretched among four or five anchor points that can be more than three feet apart. The radial lines meet at a central point. The spider makes a frame with several more radial lines and then fills the center with a spiral of silk, leaving a 5/16 to 3/8 inches (8 to 9.5 mm) gap between the spiral rings, starting with the innermost ring and moving outward in a clockwise motion. To ensure that the web is taut, the spider bends the radial lines slightly together while applying the silk spiral. The female builds a substantially larger web than the male's small zigzag web, often found nearby. The spider occupies the center of the web, usually hanging head-down, waiting for prey to become ensnared in it. If disturbed by a possible predator, she may drop from the web and hide on the ground nearby. The web normally remains in one location for the entire summer, but spiders can change locations usually early in the season, perhaps to find better protection or better hunting.The <b>yellow</b> <b>garden</b> <b>spider</b> can oscillate her web vigorously while she remains firmly attached in the center. This action might prevent predators like wasps and birds from drawing a good bead, and also to fully entangle an insect before it cuts itself loose.However, in a case observed in Georgia, Davis witnessed a Vespa crabro fly into the spider’s web and get tangled up. Upon looking closer it was found that V. crabro was actually cutting free prey that had been caught in the A. aurantia web. In this case, A. aurantia did not interfere or fight with the European hornet probably because it dropped down and hid nearby.|$|E
