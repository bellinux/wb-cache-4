40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to identify whether the Wagner Law, which refers {{to the effect of}} public spending on economic growth can be observed for the Brazilian reality. According to Wagner, the public sector is able to intervene in the economy to alter its growth trajectory, with such a process promoted by higher expenses. To test the hypothesis Wagner information was collected on the amount of government spending and the Brazilian production between 1909 and 2012, extracted from IPEADATA. The processing of information in order to reproduce the arguments that led to the completion of the verification or not the Wagner Law was based on techniques of time series. The model of Vector Autoregressive (VAR), the analysis of Granger and Cointegration test were used. Still, the tests of Dickey - Fuller and Phillip - Perron test for identification to check the type of behavior that characterizes the best series of public spending and growth were used. The results highlight that both variables have decided not stationary in level, <b>you</b> <b>characterize</b> as well as a process I(1). The impulse response functions showed a positive relationship not spending towards growth and a low explanatory power of the fluctuations of the latter after the first 20 periods, respectively. The test of Granger pointed out that there is a unidirectional relationship between public spending and growth, with the same expenditure towards growth - ie, only growth can affect the spending behavior in the Granger sense. Finally, the cointegration analysis did find arguments in favor of a long-term relationship for the series in question. O objetivo deste trabalho Ã identificar se a lei de Wagner, que se remete ao efeito dos gastos pÃblicos sobre o crescimento econÃmico, pode ser observada para a realidade brasileira. Segundo Wagner, o setor pÃblico Ã capaz de intervir na economia de modo a alterar sua trajetÃria de crescimento, sendo tal processo promovido pela elevaÃÃo das despesas. Para testar a hipÃtese de Wagner foram coletadas informaÃÃes sobre o montante de gastos governamentais e sobre a produÃÃo brasileira entre 1909 e 2012, extraÃdas do IPEADATA. O processamento das informaÃÃes de modo a reproduzir argumentos que levaram a conclusÃo sobre a verificaÃÃo ou nÃo da lei de Wagner foram baseado em tÃcnicas de sÃries temporais. Foram utilizados o modelo de Vetores Auto-Regressivos (VAR), a anÃlise de causalidade de Granger e o teste de CointegraÃÃo. Ainda, foram utilizados os testes de Dickey-Fuller Aumentado e o teste de Phillip-Perron para identificaÃÃo para verificaÃÃo do tipo de comportamento que melhor caracteriza as sÃries do gasto pÃblico e do crescimento.

40|$|La tesi di questo saggio è che ciò che caratterizza il “nuovo pensiero” di Franz Rosenzweig è il linguaggio. A partire da qui viene capovolto, seguendo la lezione di Humboldt, il rapporto tradizionale tra logica e grammatica. Perciò la grammatica del parlare è non solo il punto di partenza, ma la struttura della Stella della redenzione. Il saggio delinea la genealogia dei pronomi, dall’io al tu, fino al messianico “noi tutti” (Wir-Alle), seguendone le implicazione filosofiche, linguistiche e teologiche nei tre grandi commenti di Bereshit, del Cantico dei cantici e del salmo 115. This essay {{tries to}} {{delineate}} the genealogy of the pronoun »we« {{in the philosophy}} of Franz Rosenzweig. In this context it considers the often ignored connection between the »new thinking« and the German philosophy of language, which goes back to Hamann, Herder, and above all to Humboldt. In fact, it is surprising that a detailed study on the importance that Humboldt has for Rosenzweig is still missing. This essay tries to remedy this lack through the interpretation of the paradoxical concept of »dual« which Humboldt develops in his famous treatise Über den Dualis of 1827. For Humboldt, as well as for Rosenzweig, the »we« doesn’t arise from the plural, but from the »dual«, i. e., from the duality of the I and the <b>you</b> which <b>characterizes</b> the dialogue. According to Rosenzweig, the dual introduces the sign of the personal singularity into the plural which otherwise would be impersonal.

40|$|Induction {{couplers}} exploit eddy-current {{effects to}} create force and torque on a target without mechanical contact. Nearly all spacecraft structures include conductive material, so induction couplers {{may be the}} closest realizable technology to science fiction's tractor beam: a device that generates contactless force on an uncooperative target. Contactless forces can potentially enable on-orbit servicing missions that are currently infeasible because they are too dangerous and expensive. On-oribt servicing enables tasks {{we take for granted}} on earth but are difficult in space like maintenence, repair, and disposal. Relative movement between two uncooperative spacecraft traditionally requires either mechanical grapplers or thrusters. Contactless actuators can act in the place of mechanical grapplers in many situations, reducing the risks associated with mechanical contact and sudden non-compliant dynamics coupling. Induction couplers reduce or eliminate the need for thrusters while maneuvering near a larger object - increasing lifetimes, reducing costs, and eliminating risks from plume impingement. Contactless actuation technology asks three major questions: • How do <b>you</b> model and <b>characterize</b> dynamic eddy-current interactions? • How can an inspector use induction couplers to move in six degrees of freedom? • How do you design an inspection system that can successfully control itself with induction couplers? This thesis describes solutions to each of these challenges, laying the groundwork for safe and practical on-orbit servicing. Induction couplers can produce millinewton actuation forces with a lower specific power than other contactless actuators. The inspector can move in six degrees of freedom by following trajectories composed of four motion primitives, each with two possible control laws. Finally, a new algorithm based on the idea of controllable volumes informs the inspector's physical layout so that it can maximize the use of its induction couplers...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{development}} of mathematical models that can reliably simulate the energy {{performance of a}} whole building or a building component with minimal discrepancy between the real and simulated data is a major aim of Building Physics science. In order to create models that accurately represent real physical phenomena it is necessity to perform tests on buildings and building components, producing real data {{that can be used}} to adjust and validate these models. If these tests are not undertaken correctly, incorrect data sets, insufficient data sets or excessively complex and expensive experiments may be performed. Thus, depending on the aim and the accuracy needed for the mathematical models, the test environment and test set up must be chosen correctly. This problem has been studied inside Subtask 2 of the Annex 58 “Reliable building energy performance characterisation based on full scale dynamic measurements”. The aim was to come to a roadmap on how to measure the actual thermal performance of building components and whole buildings. This means under realistic boundary conditions (field exposure or artificial climate) and taking into account workmanship. Since there are many established methods and different Standards for different measurement purposes, the solution has been to organize the existing methods (both Standards and widely used non-Standard testing methods) into a decision tree. This decision tree begins with the question “What do you want to characterize?” and determines the context, environment, experimental design and analysis method being used by the user, terminating in a document reference. In a very simple format, following the decision tree and having a clear idea of what <b>you</b> need to <b>characterize</b> or model, <b>you</b> will reach an end branch of the decision tree where a testing Standard or testing method will be defined. The objective of this paper is to present the decision tree, its logic and the way it should be used...|$|R
50|$|Having {{considered}} the demand you have submitted to me, {{in which you}} inform me that a modification {{of the order of}} succession established by the Firman, addressed to your ancestor, Mehmed Ali-Pacha, dated on the 2nd of the month of Rebiul-Akhir, 1257, confering upon him the Government à titre d'hérédité of the Province of Egypt, and the transmission of the succession from father to son, in a direct line by primogeniture, would be favorable to the good administration of Egypt and the development of the well-being of the inhabitants of that Province—Appreciating in all their extent the efforts you have made toward this end since your nomination to the Government-General of Egypt, {{which is one of the}} most important provinces of my Empire, as well as the fidelity and devotion of which you have never ceased to give me proofs; and wishing upon my part to give you a striking testimony of the good-will and entire confidence I accord to you, I have decided that henceforth the Government of Egypt and the annexed territories and dependencies shall be transmitted to your eldest son, and in the same manner to the eldest sons of his successors.If the Governor-General leaves no male heir, the succession will fall to his eldest brother, and in default of brothers, to the eldest son of the eldest brother. This shall be hereafter the law of succession in Egypt. Moreover, the conditions contained in the foregoing Firman are, and remain always in force as heretofore; each one of the conditions will be constantly observed, and the maintenance of the privileges which flow from these conditions will depend upon the integral observance of each one of the obligations which they impose.The pledges more recently accorded by my Imperial Government-General of Egypt to maintain 30,000 effective troops, to create a difference between the moneys coined in Egypt, in my Imperial name, and the other moneys of my Empire, to confer the civil grades of my Government as high as the rank of Sanié (second rank of the first class), are equally confirmed.The law which interdicts the succession of the male descendants of the daughters of the Governors will be maintained in future as in past.The tribute of 80,000 bourses, paid by Egypt into the Imperial Treasury, is increased to 150,000 bourses, commencing March, 1866.My Imperial Trade being issued to put into execution the preceding conditions, the present Firman, bearing my Imperial signet, has been transmitted to you by my Chancellerie.It is incumbent upon you, with that loyalty and zeal which <b>characterizes</b> <b>you,</b> profiting by the knowledge you have acquired of the requirements of Egypt, to consecrate yourself to the good administration of that country; to labor to assure to the people entire security and tranquillity; and, recognizing the value of the pledge I have just given you of my Imperial favor, to observe with fidelity the conditions as established above.Done 12th day of the Month of Muharram, 1283.|$|R

No Brasil e no mundo existe grande preocupaÃÃo com o aumento das Ãreas agrÃcolas mecanizadas que apresentam problemas de compactaÃÃo. Este estudo foi realizado no NÃcleo Experimental de Engenharia AgrÃcola da Universidade Estadual do Oeste do ParanÃ - UNIOESTE. A Ãrea avaliada foi dividida em trÃs faixas com trÃs tratamentos cada, totalizando nove parcelas de 35 m 2. Foram coletados os dados de resistÃncia do solo Ã penetraÃÃo (RSP), por meio de um penetrÃmetro eletrÃnico de haste, resistÃncia do solo Ã placa ou Ãndice de compressÃo do solo (RSPP), com o auxÃlio do penetrÃmetro de placa, densidade do solo (Ds) e teor de Ãgua no solo (UMID). Esses dados foram coletados em condiÃÃes iniciais, caracterizando-se como os dados antes das passadas do rodado do trator agrÃcola. Na seqÃÃncia, com a finalidade de compactar o solo, foram {{realizadas}} as passadas com o rodado de trator agrÃcola, com o auxÃlio de um trator Ford, SÃrie 7630, com traÃÃo dianteira auxiliar. Em uma das faixas foi realizada uma passada, em outra, cinco passadas e em outra com dez passadas, apÃs, coletaram-se novamente os dados de RSP, RSPP, Ds e UMID, seguindo os mesmos parÃmetros iniciais. Depois da coleta desses dados, foi realizada em faixas perpendiculares Ã faixa das passadas a semeadura das culturas de milho, soja e feijÃo, com o auxÃlio de uma semeadora-adubadora de precisÃo. Com tÃrmino do ciclo e a colheita manual das culturas, coletaram-se novamente os dados de RSP, RSPP, DS e UMID. O trabalho teve como objetivos determinar a resistÃncia mecÃnica do solo Ã penetraÃÃo, o Ãndice de compressÃo do solo e a densidade do solo, em funÃÃo do aumento do nÃmero de passadas com um trator agrÃcola, antes da semeadura e apÃs a colheita de soja, feijÃo e milho, e analisar o efeito dessas culturas na reduÃÃo da compactaÃÃo do solo. Os resultados obtidos permitiram concluir que as passadas do rodado do trator agrÃcola afetam diretamente no estado de compactaÃÃo do solo, aumentando com isso a resistÃncia mecÃnica do solo Ã penetraÃÃo, resistÃncia do solo Ã placa ou Ãndice de compressÃo do solo e densidade do solo. O efeito das culturas na reduÃÃo da resistÃncia do solo Ã penetraÃÃo nÃo foi significativo, no entanto, na reduÃÃo da pressÃo de prÃ-consolidaÃÃo foi mais acentuado para a cultura do milho. The compactation of {{the soil}} has been pointed {{as one of the}} great problems of modern agriculture. In Brazil and the world great concern with the increase of the mechanized agricultural areas exists that present compactation problems. The study State University of the West of the ParanÃ was carried through in the Experimental Nucleus of Agricultural Engineering of the Unioeste -. The area was divided in three bands with three treatments each having totalized nine parcels of to 35 m 2 each, had been collected the data of resistance {{of the soil}} to the penetration (RSP) through penetrÃmetro electronic of connecting rod, resistance of the soil to the plate or index of compression of the soil (RSPP) I assist with it of penetrÃmetro of plate, density of the soil (Ds) and water text in the soil (UMID), these data had been collected in conditions <b>you</b> initiate <b>characterizing</b> itself as the data before the passed ones of twirled of the tractor the agriculturist. In the sequence, with the objective to compact the soil, the passed ones with the twirled one of agricultural tractor had been carried through, assist with it of a Ford tractor, Series 7630 with front traction to assist, in one of the bands had been carried through passing, in another one, five passed and in another one with ten passing, after, again collected the data of RSP, RSPP, Ds and UMID following the same initial parameters. After the collection of these data, was carried through in perpendicular bands the band of passed the sowing of the maize cultures, soy and beans, with the aid of a semeadora-adubadora of precision. With ending of the cycle and manual harvest of the cultures, the data of RSP, RSPP had been collected again, DS and UMID. The objective of this work was to determine the resistance mechanics of the soil to the penetration, index of compression of the soil and density of the soil in function of the passed increase of the number of with an agricultural tractor, before the sowing and after the harvest soy, beans and maize and to analyze the effect of these cultures in the reduction of the compactation of the soil. The gotten results had allowed to conclude that the passed ones of the twirled one of the agricultural tractor affect directly in the state of compactation of the same, increasing with this the resistance mechanics of the soil to the penetration, resistance of the soil to the plate or index of compression of the soil and density of the soil. The effect of the cultures in the reduction of the resistance of the soil to the penetration was not significant, however in the reduction of the daily pay-consolidation pressure more it was accented for the culture of the maize...|$|R
