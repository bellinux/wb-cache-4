500|$|After {{returning}} from Alaska, Hubbard applied {{to join the}} United States Navy. His Congressman, Warren G. Magnuson, wrote to President Roosevelt to recommend Hubbard as [...] "a gentleman of reputation" [...] who was [...] "a respected explorer" [...] and had [...] "marine masters papers for more types of vessels than any other man in the United States". Hubbard was described as [...] "a key figure" [...] in writing organizations, [...] "making him politically potent nationally". The Congressman concluded: [...] "Anything <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> Mr Hubbard will be appreciated." [...] His friend Robert MacDonald Ford, by now a State Representative for Washington, sent a letter of recommendation describing Hubbard as [...] "one of the most brilliant men I have ever known". It called Hubbard [...] "a powerful influence" [...] in the Northwest {{and said that he}} was [...] "well known {{in many parts of the}} world and has considerable influence in the Caribbean and Alaska". The letter declared that [...] "for courage and ability I cannot too strongly recommend him." [...] Ford later said that Hubbard had written the letter himself: [...] "I don't know why Ron wanted a letter. I just gave him a letter-head and said, 'Hell, you're the writer, you write it!'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Dr. Orr’s {{theme for}} {{the week of the}} conference was “Think not what great things <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> God, but think first of {{whatever}} <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> a great God.” And so he introduced the song {{at the start of the}} conference and it was sung each day. Attending the Forest Home college-age conference were Hal Spencer and his sister, Loretta, son and daughter of Tim Spencer, who was a songwriter and publisher of Christian music. Hal and Loretta borrowed the song sheet from Dr. Orr and brought it home and gave it to their father.|$|E

2500|$|John Fitzgerald Kennedy [...] (May 29, 1917 – November 22, 1963), was the 35th President of the United States, serving from 1961 {{until his}} {{assassination}} on November 22, 1963. Few American Presidents have quotes that are remembered long after their deaths, and Kennedy {{was among those}} few for saying to the nation, [...] "Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> your country." [...] He was the second-youngest President (after Theodore Roosevelt). Kennedy {{was faced with a}} number of important events during his term as President which include the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Bay of Pigs Invasion, the Space Race and the Berlin Wall crisis.|$|E
2500|$|Others doubted whether recent {{graduates}} had {{the necessary}} skills and maturity {{for such a}} task. The idea was popular among students, however, and Kennedy pursued it, asking respected academics such as Max Millikan and Chester Bowles to help him outline the organization and its goals. During his inaugural address, Kennedy again promised to create the program: [...] "And so, my fellow Americans: ask not what your country can do for you—ask what <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> your country". President Kennedy in {{a speech at the}} White House on June 22, 1962, [...] "Remarks to Student Volunteers Participating in Operation Crossroads Africa", acknowledged that Operation Crossroads for Africa was the basis {{for the development of the}} Peace Corps. [...] "This group and this effort really were the progenitors of the Peace Corps and what this organization has been doing for a number of years led to the establishment of what I consider to be the most encouraging indication of the desire for service not only in this country but all around the world that we have seen in recent years". The Peace Corps website answered the question [...] "Who Inspired the Creation of the Peace Corps?", acknowledging that the Peace Corps were based on Operation Crossroads Africa founded by Rev. James H. Robinson.|$|E

6000|$|... "Like enough," [...] {{said the}} poor wife. [...] "He'd prey upon anybody {{as he could}} get a-hold of. And so, Mr. Wharton, you think that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> nothing <b>for</b> me." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Then I fear <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> nothing <b>for</b> me at Glenbogie. To mollify Aunt Emmeline would, I fear, {{be beyond}} your power. Sir Thomas, {{as far as}} I <b>can</b> see, <b>does</b> not require much mollifying." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, then," [...] said Jacob Stuck, [...] "I {{would like}} you to help me out of this desert place, if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> so, <b>for</b> it is a poor spot for any Christian soul to be." ...|$|R
