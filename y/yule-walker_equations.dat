In recent years, this field has received increased attention of the research community. In this thesis, some time domain and frequency domain approaches for identifying the errors-in-variables model is studied. The first chapter gives an overview of various methods for identifying dynamic errors-in-variables systems. Several approaches are classified and a qualitative comparison of different existing methods is also presented. The second chapter deals with instrumental variables based approaches. The least squares and the total least squares methods of solving the <b>Yule–Walker</b> <b>equation</b> is of central interest here. The methods are compared from the view point of asymptotic performance, numerical robustness and computation. The method presented in the third chapter uses prefiltered data.

Compared to the IV approach, the proposed method shows a significant improvement in the small-sample properties of the MA parameter estimates, without any increase in the computational load.

40|$|The propagator of {{a linear}} model plays {{a central role}} in {{empirical}} no mal mode and finite-time instability problems. Its estimation will affect whether the linear stability character is tics of the corresponding dynamic system can be properly extracted. In this study, we introduce two alternative methods for estimating the linear propagator and finite-time growth rates from data. The first is the generalized singular value de composition (GSVD) and the second is the singular value de composition combined with the cosine-sine decomposition (SVD-CSD). Both methods linearize the relation between the predictor and the predict and by de composing them to have a common evolution structure and then make the estimations. Thus, the linear propagator and the associated singular vectors can be simultaneously derived. The GSVD clearly reveals the connection between the finite-time amplitude growth rates and the singular values of the propagator. However, it can only be applied in situations when given data have more state variables than observations. Further more, it generally encounters an over-fit ting problem when data are contaminated by noise. To fix these two draw backs, the GSVD is generalized to the SVD-CSD to include data filtering capability. There fore, it has more flexibility in dealing with general data situations. These two methods as well as the <b>Yule-Walker</b> <b>equation</b> were applied to two synthetic datasets and the Kaplan's sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTA) to evaluate their performance. The results show that, be cause of linearization and flexible filtering capabilities, the propagator and its associated properties could be more accurately estimated with the SVD-CSD than other methods...|$|R
50|$|Walker was an {{established}} applied mathematician at the University of Cambridge {{when he took}} up a position as assistant to the meteorological reporter in 1903. He was elevated {{to the position of}} director general of observatories in India in 1904. Walker had never worked on meteorology but the previous director of the Indian Meteorological Department, John Eliot. Another predecessor in the Indian Meteorological Department, Henry Francis Blanford, had noticed the pattern that the summer monsoon in India and Burma was correlated with the spring snow cover in the Himalayas. In India, the failure of the Indian Ocean monsoon had brought severe famine to the country in 1899 and meteorology had great economic value. Walker developed Blanford's idea with quantitative rigour and came up with correlation measures (with a lag) and regression equations (or in time-series terminology, autoregression). He set up a group of Indian clerks to calculate correlations between weather parameters. The methods he introduced for time-series regression are now partly named after him (the other contributor was Udny Yule who studied sun-spot cycles) as the <b>Yule-Walker</b> <b>equations.</b> Analyzing vast amounts of weather data from India and lands beyond, over the next fifteen years he published the first descriptions of the great seesaw oscillation of atmospheric pressure between the Indian and Pacific Ocean, and its correlation to temperature and rainfall patterns across much of the Earth's tropical regions, including India.

40|$|ECG {{monitoring}} of {{heart rate variability}} (HRV) in a noninvasive method {{for the evaluation of}} cardiovascular autonomic control. HRV can be analyzed in the time- and frequency domain. The frequency-domain analysis (FDA), an estimation of the variability distributed as a function of frequency, is performed with spectral techniques using the Fast Fourier transform (FFT) or autoregressive (AR) algorithms. With FDA three main rhythmic components: the VLF (0 - 0. 03 Hz), LF (0. 04 - 0. 15 Hz) and HF (0. 15 - 0. 40 Hz). HF measures the amplitude of sinus node respiratory arrhythmia (vagal modulation); LF mainly reflects the effectes of sympathetic discharge. Physiological interpretation of VLF is still uncertain. FDA is applied to short term (5 min.) and long term (24 hours) recordings. In both cases FDA requires some level of stationarity of the signals during the time window, usually chosen for evaluation. This impedes the quantification of clinically relevant transient variations of sympathovagal balance. Different time-frequency methods have been developed for instant FDA of HRV. Those based on short-time FFT still require some level of stationarity. In this work an autoregressive (AR) adaptive parametric method, based on the <b>Yule-Walker</b> <b>equation,</b> has been used, which is suitable for real-time FDA during data acquisition. ECG signal (band-passed 0. 05 - 100 Hz) is digitized with a 500 Hz sampling frequency. The RR interval is computed from QRS first derivative with threshold method. The AR adaptive software program automatically the optimal order of the model and tests its reliability. The LF and HF central frequency, the total power, the LF and HF power in absolute values and in normalized units and the LF/HF ratio are computed beat-to-beat. The results of beat-to-beat spectral analysis is typically represented three-dimensionally. The power spectrum at each beat can be separately analyzed with automatic calculation of all parameters. The method has been applied to investigate normal volunteers and patients with syncope, Parkinson Disease and Multisystem Atrophy. All patients have been studied in supine position, under spontaneous and metronome-controlled breathing, during Valsalva maneuver, and in active 90 ° upright position. The average modifications of spectral pattern of HRV were the same as those previously reported with conventional FFT or AR algorithm. The real time study of the RR interval dynamics has identified transient changes of HRV spectral components, which might helpful for clinical investigation of neural mediation of syncope, dysauthonomia and of several cardiac arrhythmia...|$|R

40|$|Modelling high {{dimensional}} {{time series}} and non-stationary time series are two import aspects in {{time series analysis}} nowadays. The main objective of this thesis is {{to deal with these}} two problems. The first two parts deal with high dimensionality and the third part considers a change point detection problem. In the first part, we consider a class of spatio-temporal models which extend popular econometric spatial autoregressive panel data models by allowing the scalar coefficients for each location (or panel) different from each other. The model is of the following form: yt = D(λ 0) Wyt + D(λ 1) yt− 1 + D(λ 2) Wyt− 1 + εt, (1) where yt = (y 1,t,..., yp,t) T represents the observations from p locations at time t, D(λk) = diag(λk 1,..., λkp) and λkj is the unknown coefficient parameter for the j-th location, and W is the p×p spatial weight matrix which measures the dependence among different locations. All the elements on the main diagonal of W are zero. It is a common practice in spatial econometrics to assume W known. For example, we may let wij = 1 /(1 + dij), for i ̸= j, where dij ≥ 0 is an appropriate distance between the i-th and the j-th location. It can simply be the geographical distance between the two locations or the distance reflecting the correlation or association between the variables at the two locations. In the above model, D(λ 0) captures the pure spatial effect, D(λ 1) captures the pure dynamic effect, and D(λ 2) captures the time-lagged spatial effect. We also assume that the error term εt = (ε 1,t, ε 2,t,..., εp,t) T in (1) satisfies the condition Cov (yt− 1, εt) = 0. When λk 1 = · · · = λkp for all k = 1, 2, 3, (1) reduces to the model of Yu et al. (2008), in which there are only 3 unknown regressive coefficient parameters. In general the regression function in (1) contains 3 p unknown parameters. To overcome the innate endogeneity, we propose a generalized Yule-Walker estimation method which applies the least squares estimation to a <b>Yule-Walker</b> <b>equation.</b> The asymptotic theory is developed under the setting that both the sample size and the number of locations (or panels) tend to infinity under a general setting for stationary and α-mixing processes, which includes spatial autoregressive panel data models driven by i. i. d. innovations as special cases. The proposed methods are illustrated using both simulated and real data. In part 2, we consider a multivariate time series model which decomposes a vector process into a latent factor process and a white noise process. Let yt = (y 1,t, · · ·, yp,t) T be an observable p × 1 vector time series process. The factor model decomposes yt in the following form: yt = Axt + εt, (2) where xt = (x 1,t, · · ·, xr,t) T is a r × 1 latent factor time series with unknown r ≤ p and A = (a 1, a 2, · · ·, ar) is a p × r unknown constant matrix. εt is a white noise process with mean 0 and covariance matrix Σε. The first part of (2) is a dynamic part and the serial dependence of yt is driven by xt. We will achieve dimension reduction once r ≪ p {{in the sense that the}} dynamics of yt is driven by a much lower dimensional process xt. Motivated by practical needs and the characteristic of high dimensional data, the sparsity assumption on factor loading matrix is imposed. Different from Lam, Yao and Bathia (2011) ’s method, which is equivalent to an eigenanalysis of a non negative definite matrix, we add a constraint to control the number of nonzero elements in each column of the factor loading matrix. Our proposed sparse estimator is then the solution of a constrained optimization problem. The asymptotic theory is developed under the setting that both the sample size and the dimensionality tend to infinity. When the common factor is weak in the sense that δ > 1 / 2 in Lam, Yao and Bathia (2011) ’s paper, the new sparse estimator may have a faster convergence rate. Numerically, we employ the generalized deflation method (Mackey (2009)) and the GSLDA method (Moghaddam et al. (2006)) to approximate the estimator. The tuning parameter is chosen by cross validation. The proposed method is illustrated with both simulated and real data examples. The third part is a change point detection problem. we consider the following covariance structural break detection problem: Cov(yt) I(tj− 1 ≤ t < tj) = Σtj− 1, j = 1, · · ·, m + 1, where yt is a p × 1 vector time series, Σtj− 1 ̸ = Σtj and t 1,..., tm are change points, 1 = t 0 < t 1 < · · · < tm+ 1 = n. In the literature, the number of change points m is usually assumed to be known and small, because a large m would involve a huge amount of computational burden for parameters estimation. By reformulating the problem in a variable selection context, the group least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) is proposed to estimate m and the locations of the change points t 1,..., tm. Our method is model free, it can be extensively applied to multivariate time series, such as GARCH and stochastic volatility models. It is shown that both m and the locations of the change points t 1,..., tm can be consistently estimated from the data, and the computation can be efficiently performed. An improved practical version that incorporates group LASSO and the stepwise regression variable selection technique are discussed. Simulation studies are conducted to assess the finite sample performance...|$|R
