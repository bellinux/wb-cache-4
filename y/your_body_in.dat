6000|$|But Cauchon was not touched. He {{made another}} of those conscienceless speeches of his, all {{dripping}} with hypocrisy and guile. He told Joan that among her answers had been some which had seemed to endanger religion; and as she was ignorant and without knowledge of the Scriptures, he had brought some good and wise men to instruct her, if she desired it. Said he, [...] "We are churchmen, and disposed by our good will {{as well as by}} our vocation to procure for you the salvation of your soul and <b>your</b> <b>body,</b> <b>in</b> every way in our power, just as we would do the like for our nearest kin or for ourselves.

"Is it not {{wonderful}} that, {{while not}} very many years ago the Whites were merely a handful, living on sufferance in Calcutta, Madras, and Bombay, they are now masters of southern India and half of Bengal; and even venture to engage a great empire {{like that of the}} Mahrattas, stretching from the sea on the west to Delhi, and holding the mastery over all central India? There must be something extraordinary about these men. Why, you would scarce believe it, but I have seen often, and wondered always; when they have an entertainment, instead of sitting quietly 'and having dancing girls to posture for their amusement, they dance themselves with their women--not a mere movement of the body and hands, such as you see among our dancers, but violent dancing, exhausting themselves till the perspiration streams from their faces--and this both men and women regard as amusement; so, Puntojee, if you are to take your place among your countrymen again, you must accustom yourself to fatigues, and strengthen <b>your</b> <b>body</b> <b>in</b> every way; or you will be regarded with contempt as one who, although of their blood, has grown degenerate and unworthy of them." ...|$|E
60|$|Now, here is {{the plain}} answer to such unwise speech (for unwise it is, let it be dressed up in all fine long words, and show of wisdom), whether the {{doctrine}} be true or not, your not understanding the matter is no reason against it. Here is the answer: 'You DO believe all day long a hundred things which you do not understand; which quite surpass your reason. You believe that you are alive: {{but you do not}} understand how you live. You believe that, though you are made up of so many different faculties and powers, you are one person: but you cannot understand how. You believe that though your body and your mind too have gone through so many changes since you were born, yet you are still one and the same person, and nobody else but yourself; but you cannot understand that either. You know it is so; but how and why it is so, you cannot explain; and the greatest philosopher would not be foolish enough to try to explain; because, if he is a really great scholar, he knows that it cannot be explained. You lift your hand to your head: but how you do it, neither you nor any mortal man knows; and true philosophers tell you that we shall probably never know. True philosophers tell you that in the simplest movement of <b>your</b> <b>body,</b> <b>in</b> the growth of the meanest blade of grass, let them examine it with the microscope, let them think over it till their brains are weary, there is always some mystery, some wonder over and above, which neither their glasses nor their brains can explain, or even find and see, much less give a name to. They know that there is more in the matter, in the simplest matter, than man can find out; and they are content to leave the wonder in the hands of God who made it; and when they have found out all they can, confess, that the more they know, the less they find they know.|$|E

60|$|Your {{ideal is}} not perhaps high, {{but it is}} plain and possible. You become enamoured of a life of change and {{movement}} and the open air, where the muscles shall be more exercised than the affections. When you have had your will of the forest, you may visit the whole round world. You may buckle on your knapsack and take the road on foot. You may bestride a good nag, and ride forth, {{with a pair of}} saddle-bags, into the enchanted East. You may cross the Black Forest, and see Germany wide-spread before you, like a map, dotted with old cities, walled and spired, that dream all day on their own reflections in the Rhine or Danube. You may pass the spinal cord of Europe and go down from Alpine glaciers to where Italy extends her marble moles and glasses her marble palaces in the midland sea. You may sleep in flying trains or wayside taverns. You may be awakened at dawn by the scream of the express or the small pipe of the robin in the hedge. For you the rain should allay the dust of the beaten road; the wind dry your clothes upon you as you walked. Autumn should hang out russet pears and purple grapes along the lane; inn after inn proffer you their cups of raw wine; river by river receive <b>your</b> <b>body</b> <b>in</b> the sultry noon. Wherever you went warm valleys and high trees and pleasant villages should compass you about; and light fellowships should take you by the arm, and walk with you an hour upon your way. You may see from afar off what it will come to in the end—the weather-beaten red-nosed vagabond, consumed by a fever of the feet, cut off from all near touch of human sympathy, a waif, an Ishmael, and an outcast. And yet it will seem well—and yet, in the air of the forest, this will seem the best—to break all the network bound about your feet by birth and old companionship and loyal love, and bear your shovelful of phosphates to and fro, in town country, until the hour of the great dissolvent.|$|E
6000|$|If aught from fearful dreams may be divined, [...] They signify a cock of {{dunghill}} kind. [...] All dreams, as in old Galen I have read, [...] 140 [...] Are from repletion and complexion bred; [...] From rising fumes of indigested food, [...] And noxious humours that infect the blood: [...] And sure, my lord, if I {{can read}} aright, [...] These foolish fancies {{you have had}} to-night [...] Are certain symptoms (in the canting style) [...] Of boiling choler, and abounding bile; [...] This yellow gall, that in your stomach floats, [...] Engenders all these visionary thoughts. [...] When choler overflows, then dreams are bred [...] 150 [...] Of flames, and all the family of red; [...] Red dragons, and red beasts, in sleep we view, [...] For humours are distinguish'd by their hue. [...] From hence we dream of wars and warlike things, [...] And wasps and hornets with their double wings. [...] Choler adust congeals our blood with fear, [...] Then black bulls toss us, and black devils tear. [...] In sanguine airy dreams, aloft we bound; [...] With rheums oppress'd, we sink in rivers drown'd. [...] More I could say, but thus conclude my theme, [...] 160 [...] The dominating humour makes the dream. [...] Cato was in his time accounted wise, [...] And he condemns them all for empty lies. [...] Take my advice, and when we fly to ground, [...] With laxatives preserve your body sound, [...] And purge the peccant humours that abound. [...] I should be loath to lay you on a bier; [...] And though there lives no pothecary near, [...] I dare for once prescribe for your disease, [...] And save long bills, and a damn'd doctor's fees. [...] 170 [...] Two sovereign herbs, which I by practice know, [...] And both at hand (for in our yard they grow), [...] On peril of my soul shall rid you wholly [...] Of yellow choler, and of melancholy: [...] You must both purge, and vomit; but obey, [...] And {{for the love of}} heaven make no delay. [...] Since hot and dry in your complexion join, [...] Beware the sun when in a vernal sign; [...] For when he mounts exalted in the Ram, [...] If then he finds <b>your</b> <b>body</b> <b>in</b> a flame, [...] 180 [...] Replete with choler, I dare lay a groat, [...] A tertian ague is at least your lot. [...] Perhaps a fever (which the gods forefend!) [...] May bring your youth to some untimely end: [...] And therefore, sir, as you desire to live, [...] A day or two before your laxative, [...] Take just three worms, nor under nor above, [...] Because the gods unequal numbers love, [...] These digestives prepare you for your purge; [...] Of fumetory, centaury, and spurge, [...] 190 [...] And of ground ivy add a leaf or two,-- [...] All which within our yard or garden grow. [...] Eat these, and be, my lord, of better cheer; [...] Your father's son was never born to fear.|$|E
