5|$|Holiday {{made her}} first {{appearance}} and {{start for the}} U.S. women's national soccer team on January 26, 2007, against Germany. She earned her second cap and scored her first goals against Mexico on April 14, 2007. The same year, she was named the U.S. Soccer <b>Young</b> <b>Female</b> Athlete of the Year.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, she {{was named}} U.S. Soccer <b>Young</b> <b>Female</b> Athlete of the Year. She earned U.S. Soccer Female Athlete of the Year honors in 2014. She was the first player in NWSL history to have her jersey retired after {{retiring}} from the league.|$|E
5|$|Much like {{fathers are}} {{depicted}} primarily in recreational activities with their children, other male {{members of the}} family, including sons and male grandchildren, are portrayed in play activities {{the majority of the}} time. Interestingly, <b>young</b> <b>female</b> members of the family are depicted similarly in play activities, but nevertheless tend to be more likely shown in activities related to chores and child-care. In addition, the image of the grandparent has been largely nonexistent in advertising.|$|E
40|$|Studies {{have shown}} that the {{auditory}} brain stem response (ABR) is often affected in neurodevelopmental disorders. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate possible differences in ABR between <b>young</b> <b>females</b> with ADHD compared to control subjects. This study focuses on <b>young</b> <b>females,</b> age 7 – 17 with ADHD, comparing the ABR of 43 <b>young</b> <b>females</b> with ADHD to 21 age- and gender-matched control subjects. <b>Young</b> <b>females</b> with ADHD have a significantly different ABR in a region between cochlear nucleus and superior olivary complex as well as in the thalamic region compared to control subjects. These data indicate specific differences in ABR between girls with ADHD compared to female controls...|$|R
50|$|The {{families}} {{make sure}} all <b>young</b> <b>females</b> in their groups leave before that can fall pregnant and kill the mothers' newer pups whilst still in the family unit. The father or older brothers will mate with <b>younger</b> <b>females.</b> These <b>young</b> <b>females</b> {{have the ability to}} carry sperm for up to 2 weeks until they are sexually mature (at 3-4 months) so that they can make a family of their own without the interference of another male who may kill the fathers pups. This is why it isn't recommended to keep an older male gerbil with a <b>younger</b> <b>female</b> as a cage mate for a prolonged amount of time.|$|R
40|$|In the two-spotted {{spider mite}} Tetranychus urticae (Acari: Tetranychidae), because only the first mating results in fertilisation, adult males guard {{quiescent}} deutonymph females, the stage immediately before adult emergence. Previous studies showed that T. urticae males prefer to guard older rather than <b>younger</b> <b>females.</b> However, as previous experimental designs have included uncertain factors, findings {{have not always been}} sufficiently rigorous. Therefore, we reexamined whether T. urticae males discriminate between the females closest to becoming receptive and <b>younger</b> <b>females.</b> One male was introduced onto leaf squares with two differently aged quiescent deutonymph females, with time lags between the females of 3, 6, 12 or 23 h, and whether the older or <b>younger</b> <b>female</b> was guarded was recorded. When the time lags between the females were 3, 6 or 12 h, males showed no preferences. Males preferred older <b>females</b> over <b>younger</b> ones only when the time lag was 23 h. Under non-choice conditions, fewer males guarded the 23 -h <b>younger</b> <b>females</b> than other older females, suggesting that the attractiveness of the <b>younger</b> <b>females</b> is weaker than older females. Our results are not fully consistent with previous studies; T. urticae males do not obviously discriminate between females closest to becoming receptive and <b>younger</b> <b>females...</b>|$|R
5|$|On {{the eve of}} the February 2016 New Hampshire Democratic primary, Ratajkowski {{spoke at}} a Bernie Sanders rally in New Hampshire to endorse his campaign. One of the main points of her speech, and her social media {{activity}} surrounding it, was to counter Gloria Steinem's statement that <b>young</b> <b>female</b> Sanders supporters were involved in the campaign (rather than supporting fellow female Hillary Clinton) to meet potential male romantic partners.|$|E
5|$|With Sweet Emma, Dear Böbe (1992), Szabó {{returned}} to a strictly Hungarian subject—this time, however, focused on a contemporary, rather than historical, social problem. The film follows two <b>young,</b> <b>female</b> teachers of Russian facing the obsolescence of their specialty {{after the fall of}} the socialist government, as well as a variety of types of sexual harassment in the new Hungary. The film won the top prize at the Berlin Film Festival.|$|E
5|$|Bundy was {{regarded}} {{by many of}} his <b>young</b> <b>female</b> victims as handsome and charismatic, traits that he exploited to win their trust. He typically approached them in public places, feigning injury or disability, or impersonating an authority figure, before overpowering and assaulting them at more secluded locations. He sometimes revisited his secondary crime scenes {{for hours at a}} time, grooming and performing sexual acts with the decomposing corpses until putrefaction and destruction by wild animals made further interaction impossible. He decapitated at least 12 of his victims, and kept some of the severed heads in his apartment {{for a period of time}} as mementos. On a few occasions, he simply broke into dwellings at night and bludgeoned his victims as they slept.|$|E

5|$|Fortuny also {{states that}} dress codes {{are a sign}} of a patriarchal {{organization}} because men are only forbidden from growing their hair long or wearing shorts in public. Women, at times, can be more autonomous than those in the general population in Mexico. Fortuny says that the growing trend of educated women having husbands in supporting roles is also seen within the Church both in the Guadalajara (Mexico), and Houston (Texas) congregations. Many <b>young</b> <b>female</b> members said they want to undergo post-secondary education, and some told Fortuny they were degree students. Both young men and women are equally encouraged to enter post-compulsory education. Fathers who are members of La Luz del Mundo are more likely than their mothers to direct their daughters towards attending university.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, {{after working}} in Singapore, Tommy and Hal Meadow {{returned}} to the US with what they say were three local brown-ticked cats. These three cats, a pair {{of male and female}} kittens from the same litter and another <b>young</b> <b>female,</b> were the foundation used to establish the Singapura. The breed takes its name from the Malay name for Singapore. In 1981 a breeder visited Singapore and chanced upon a cat fitting the profile of the Singapura (with the exception of the tail) in the local Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. The cat was imported to the US and adopted into the breeding program.|$|E
5|$|Kemper was {{released}} {{at the age}} of 21 after convincing Atascadero psychiatrists that he had been rehabilitated. Kemper was regarded as nonthreatening by his victims. He solely targeted <b>young</b> <b>female</b> hitchhikers during his killing spree, luring them into his vehicle and driving them to quiet areas where he would murder them before taking their corpses back to his home to be decapitated, dismembered, and violated. He then murdered his mother and one of her friends before turning himself in to the authorities. He was found sane to stand trial and in 1973 guilty and requested the death penalty for his crimes. However, capital punishment was temporarily suspended in California. He instead received eight life sentences. Since then, Kemper has been incarcerated in the California Medical Facility.|$|E

5|$|Kroonland was {{the scene}} of an {{attempted}} murder-suicide in October 1908. Two acquaintances in steerage had an argument over a <b>young</b> <b>female</b> second-class passenger that both men knew. One man threw a knife at the other—only slightly wounding him—and then fled and jumped over the railing into the English Channel near Dover. U.S. Senator Benjamin Tillman and his wife were aboard the liner at the time and saw the young man jump overboard. Although the ship lowered a boat to look for him, no trace of him was found, and he was presumed drowned.|$|E
5|$|Logan Moore is {{a troubled}} 14-year-old boy {{living with his}} mother Marianne and {{stepfather}} Robert in Newburg, Oregon. Logan does not get along well with Robert or his mother, and holds a grudge against his biological father for leaving when he was young. After an incident at a barbecue, Robert decides to purchase a Labrador Retriever in order to teach Logan responsibility. Eager to rebel against his stepfather, Logan convinces his mother to adopt a dog from an animal shelter. He plans to choose an ugly dog and teach it destructive behavior. At the shelter, Logan encounters a <b>young</b> <b>female</b> mutt who immediately takes a liking to him. Logan adopts the dog and names her Jack after Robert's former dog.|$|E
5|$|Peter Neal, an American {{writer of}} violent horror novels, is in Italy {{to promote his}} latest work, Tenebrae. He is {{accompanied}} by his literary agent, Bullmer and his assistant, Anne. Neal is unaware that {{he has also been}} followed to Rome by his embittered ex-wife, Jane. Just before Neal arrived in Rome, Elsa, a <b>young</b> <b>female</b> shoplifter, was murdered with a razor by an unseen assailant. The murderer sends Neal a letter informing him that his books have inspired him to go on a killing spree. Neal is soon contacted by the police in the form of Detective Giermani and his female partner, Inspector Altieri.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the impact of}} media on development of eating disorders in <b>young</b> <b>females</b> of Pakistan by analyzing eating disorder, weight-related issues and critically evaluating the factors, which lead to the eating disorder in females. Based on study, {{it is suggested that}} the occurrence of eating disorders and the number of <b>young</b> <b>females</b> who employ weight loss endeavors are increasing at an alarming rate. Efforts directed toward the impediment of eating disorders are needed to invalidate this tendency. Suggestions for future research include standardization of procedure. An empirical base to support the use of proposed factors; more sustained, stepwise research analyzing the eating disorder in females and rigorous programs that have sufficiently large sample sizes and lengthy follow-up periods to detect effects, will be more informative. Recommendations are proposed for health care providers and marketers to help prevent both chubbiness and eating disorders among <b>young</b> <b>females.</b> These recommendations put great emphasis on the importance of helping <b>young</b> <b>females</b> and their families, for a sustained behavioral change...|$|R
5|$|The {{events of}} the game unfolds {{successively}} from the viewpoints of four different Warhead protagonists. The first one is Gene, {{a young man who}} becomes amnesic after the Arks accident. He is the son of professor Alvin, one of the builders of the Arks, who disappeared some time after the accident. While searching for his sister Aliz kidnapped by a strange creature, Gene is mutated into a Warhead and watches his arm turning into a weapon during a battle against some Otellos. He is assisted by a small floating companion named Pake; and is later joined by the Warhead Kilroy, who was an assistant to professor Alvin; and Meme, a mysterious but determined, optimistic <b>young</b> <b>female</b> Warhead.|$|E
5|$|They {{asked him}} to leave because they were uncomfortable about sexual remarks he had made to <b>young</b> <b>female</b> members of the family. He moved to Birmingham {{towards the end of}} 1999 and stayed briefly at the Trinity Centre, a hostel for the {{homeless}} in Digbeth, before moving to a property managed by a housing association in Braithwaite Road in the Sparkbrook district of Birmingham. He became well-known locally and was a regular patron of the Shamrock Cafe on Stratford Road and of the Rainbow pub in Digbeth, where he was employed on a casual basis as an odd-jobber and served as an unofficial taxi driver for drinkers.|$|E
5|$|Until recently, {{only a few}} {{benthic species}} of shark, such as hornsharks, leopard sharks and catsharks, had survived in {{aquarium}} conditions {{for a year or}} more. This gave rise to the belief that sharks, as well as being difficult to capture and transport, were difficult to care for. More knowledge has led to more species (including the large pelagic sharks) living far longer in captivity, along with safer transportation techniques that have enabled long distance transportation. For a long time, the great white shark had never been successfully held in captivity for long, but in September 2004, the Monterey Bay Aquarium successfully kept a <b>young</b> <b>female</b> for 198 days before releasing her.|$|E

5|$|<b>Young</b> <b>female</b> tigers {{establish}} their first territories {{close to their}} mother's. The overlap between the female and her mother's territory reduces with time. Males, however, migrate further than their female counterparts and set out {{at a younger age}} to mark out their own area. A young male acquires territory either by seeking out an area devoid of other male tigers, or by living as a transient in another male's territory until he is older and strong enough to challenge the resident male. Young males seeking to establish themselves thereby comprise the highest mortality rate (30–35% per year) amongst adult tigers.|$|E
5|$|After Prince died in 1899 he was {{replaced}} by the Reverend John Hugh Smyth-Pigott. Around 1890, Smyth-Pigott again started leading meetings of the community and recruited 50 <b>young</b> <b>female</b> followers to supplement the ageing population of Agapemonites. He took Ruth Anne Preece as his second wife and she had three children, named Glory, Power and Hallelujah. By 1902 his fame had spread as far as India, from where Mirza Ghulam Ahmad warned him of his false teachings and made a death prophecy against him stating that he would die within Mirza's lifetime, if he will claim that he was a god another time, which did come true as in the life time of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad he stopped claiming being a god. After the death of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad he claimed again being god and was sentenced to death and died.|$|E
5|$|Even {{after he}} became a bishop Burnell kept a mistress, Juliana. Rumours {{circulated}} that she bore him four sons, {{and that he had}} a number of daughters, all of which Burnell denied. He kept a magnificent household, sufficient for him to be able to host a parliament at his home in Acton Burnell in autumn 1283. He married off a number of <b>young</b> <b>female</b> relatives, rumoured to be his daughters, to noblemen. Amabilla Burnell married a member of a royal justice's family, and a Joan Burnell {{was the subject of a}} guarantee to the bishop that the son of William of Greystoke would marry her. A William Burnell was dean of Wells Cathedral, and was named as one of the bishop's executors. Robert Burnell's eventual heir was his nephew, Philip.|$|E
