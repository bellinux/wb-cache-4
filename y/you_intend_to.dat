Enter where entry is banned and face the consequences, Take blows without giving them. If a fence is raised in your path , don't turn back, jump over it. Don't stop with walking through the road, enter the temple, every temple, every day, everybody. If the offering of pudding is ready, take it. Go to the place where free food is served in the temple; and sit along with others. Let the Government be informed of what <b>you</b> <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> do. One should not fight shy of laying down one's life. Those who think another's touch pollutes him should not be left unmolested in their so called cleanliness. That is my view…. Give publicity to all these in the papers. Let people know that I subscribe to their views. But let there be no violence or show of force. Don't be perturbed by coercion.|$|E
500|$|Describing {{the tone}} of the season, Loeb said, [...] "When we first started talking about Daredevil, we promised that we were telling a story that was first a crime drama and then a superhero show. This is more of a {{psychological}} thriller. This speaks to when you think about what happened to Jessica and what sort of destroyed her life and how she tried to put it together, and then to have to confront the person who deconstructed her world, that’s a very powerful, emotional place to start from." [...] On approaching rape and trauma in the season, Rosenberg wanted to avoid actually showing rape, which she called [...] "lazy storytelling" [...] and often a way to [...] "spice up" [...] male characters, and preferred to just make the trauma a part of the characters' everyday lives rather than an [...] "issue" [...] for the season to tackle. When asked about the adult nature of the season, including the use of sex, Rosenberg explained that Marvel would only not allow showing nudity {{and the use of the}} word 'fuck' in the season. Regarding all of the social issues the season covered, such as [...] "issues of choice, interracial relationships, domestic violence, [...] issues of consent" [...] while also exploring [...] "feminism and being a woman in this world", Rosenberg said, [...] "It was never our intention going in , and I think the minute <b>you</b> <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> do that, you’re stepping up on a soap box. If you’re digging into the dark side of the human psyche and all the different experiences we go through, and as women we go through, you’re going to find those things. If you treat them honestly and with respect, you’re also going to hit social issues." ...|$|E

2500|$|Patricia Neal had {{a problem}} saying the phrase, though {{she was proud of}} the film overall. [...] "I do think it's the best science fiction film ever made, {{although}} I admit that I sometimes had a difficult time keeping a straight face. Michael would patiently watch me bite my lips to avoid giggling and ask, with true British reserve, 'Is that the way <b>you</b> <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> play it?" ...|$|E
2500|$|There are {{numerous}} {{other species of}} Bryoria that can be mistaken for wila, as they all look superficially similar. [...] Although wila is edible, {{most of the other}} species of Bryoria are mildly toxic and should not be eaten in large quantities. [...] Furthermore, in certain areas wila can contain toxic quantities of vulpinic acid, {{which is one of the}} most potent poisons found in lichens. [...] If <b>you</b> <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> eat wila, you must take proper care to ensure that you are collecting the right species, and that it is not a morphotype that is high in vulpinic acid.|$|E

2500|$|As Suveică writes, it {{was only}} at this stage that Tsyganko became an adversary of the unionist camp, placing his hopes in a reestablishment of the Russian Republic, and her re-annexation of Bessarabia. At the last Sfatul session, on November 25, 1918, {{unconditional}} union was proposed for ratification, as one of several measures being voted on, alongside the allocation of offices and a land-reform-law. According to the Peasants' Faction account, also supported {{by many of the}} Moldavian nationalists who had signed the earlier protest, the Moldavian Bloc kept the opposition uniformed about there being a Sfatul session: [...] "only Mr. V. Tziganko was aware of the fact, and he was informed privately, two hours before the opening of the sitting." [...] The Tsyganko group confronted the assembly's president, Halippa, arguing that his election was illegal. They announced another walk-out, to which voices of the Moldavian Bloc responded with rhetorical questions ("Is this how <b>you</b> <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> solve the agrarian issue?") and taunts of [...] "Good riddance!" ...|$|E

But Spotted Tail, you cannot read or write. You claim that the government has tricked your people and placed the lines of your reservation a long way inside of where it was agreed that they should be. [...] You signed that paper, knowing only what the interpreter told you it said. If anything happened when the paper was being made up that changed its order, if you had been educated and could read and write, you could have known about it and refused to put your name on it. Do <b>you</b> <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> let your children remain in the same condition of ignorance in which you have lived, which will compel them always to meet the whiter man at a great disadvantage through an interpreter, as you have to do? [...] As your friend, Spotted Tail, I urge you to send your children with me to this Carlisle School and I will do everything I can to advance them in intelligence and industry in order that they may come back and help you." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lu Shi (逯式), the Administrator (太守) of the Wei-controlled Jiangxia Commandery (江夏郡), {{often led}} {{his men to}} cause trouble at the border between Wu and Wei. When Lu Xun heard that Lu Shi could not get along with Wen Xiu (文休), a son of the veteran Wei general Wen Ping, {{he came up with}} a plan to stop Lu Shi. He pretended to have {{received}} a letter from Lu Shi and wrote a [...] "reply" [...] as such: [...] "I can sense your sincerity and sorrow when you told me you have disagreements with Wen Xiu. You said both of you cannot exist together and <b>you</b> <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> defect to my side. I have delivered your letter to my lord and will gather my men to welcome you. You should make preparations soon and inform us of the date of your defection." [...] He then left the [...] "reply" [...] letter at the border, where it was picked up by Lu Shi's men. When Lu Shi heard about it, he became afraid and immediately sent his family to the Wei capital Luoyang. His subordinates became distrustful of him and eventually he was dismissed from office.|$|E
2500|$|On October 22, 2003, {{during his}} one-day shift as Acting Mayor, while Mayor Willie Brown {{traveled}} to Tibet, Daly appointed two {{members to the}} San Francisco Public Utilities Commission without Brown's consent, having consulted with the City Attorney who had advised him that as acting mayor he had the legal authority to make appointments in Mayor Brown's absence. [...] Brown, who had his own people in mind for the assignments, had a different opinion, stating that [...] " [...] were made by {{a person who was}} supposed to be operating in a ceremonial capacity... a conspiracy to... move away from the traditions, the rules, the customs and the conduct that has been the hallmark of this city, long before I became mayor of this city." [...] Brown also compared Daly to a stalker and suicide bomber, stating that, [...] "When you conspire and calculate what <b>you</b> <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> do several days before you're designated as the acting mayor, you really are venal, you really are violative of all the protocols. It's like stalking. You knew exactly what you were intending to do. You concealed all your steps. You carefully plotted, then you did it behind closed doors, and then you laughed about it." [...] Brown said he found out about Daly's actions when his chief of staff called him in Tibet. Brown was sleeping at the time but with the assistance of Chinese officials, was on a plane home within hours, cutting short his trade and promotion trip to China—reportedly explaining the matter to his hosts simply as a [...] "coup." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Newman, [...] "I {{can only}} say, in return, that I am NOT proud; I shan't mind you! But you speak as if <b>you</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> be very disagreeable." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should tell}} you that I couldn't approve of the {{engagement}} unless you were prepared to fix the time of your marriage. And I should ask <b>you</b> where <b>you</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> live." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Nor am I self-confident. I am {{obliged to}} seek comfort from such scraps of {{encouragement}} as may {{have fallen in}} my way here and there. I once did think that <b>you</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> love me." ...|$|R
