The male has a large disk-like crest and brilliant scarlet or orange plumage. It has black tail and wings, and pale greyish scapulars. The female is significantly drabber and browner than the male and has a less prominent crest. The bill is yellowish in the male, and dark with a small <b>yellow</b> <b>tip</b> in the female. Depending on gender and subspecies there are significant variations in the colour of the iris, ranging from red over orange and yellow to bluish-white in the male, and whitish over reddish to brown in the female. In addition to the display calls described in the breeding section below, foraging birds give a loud querulous “tank?” when disturbed or in flight.|$|E
500|$|The {{surviving}} specimen is [...] long, and {{has very}} dark, brownish plumage {{with a green}} gloss. The neck feathers are elongated, {{and most of the}} feathers on the upperparts and wings have a yellowish spot on their tips. It has a black bill with a <b>yellow</b> <b>tip,</b> {{and the end of the}} tail has a pale band. It has relatively short legs and long wings. It has been suggested it had a knob on its bill, but there is no evidence for this. Unlike the Nicobar pigeon, which is mainly terrestrial, the physical features of the spotted green pigeon suggest it was mainly arboreal, and fed on fruits. It may have been native to an island somewhere in the South Pacific Ocean or the Indian Ocean, and it has been suggested that a bird referred to in 1928 as titi by Tahitian islanders was this bird. The spotted green pigeon may have been close to extinction by the time Europeans arrived in its native area, and may have disappeared due to over-hunting and predation by introduced animals.|$|E

500|$|The pied currawong is {{generally}} a black bird with {{white in the}} wing, undertail coverts, {{the base of the}} tail and most visibly, the tip of the tail. It has yellow eyes. Adult birds are [...] in length, with an average of around the wingspan varies from , averaging around [...] Adult males average around , females [...] The wings are long and broad. The long and heavy bill is about one and a half times as long as the head and is hooked at the end. Juvenile birds have similar markings to adults but have softer and brownish plumage overall, although the white band on the tail is narrower. The upperparts are darker brown with scallops and streaks over the head and neck, and the underparts lighter brown. The eyes are dark brown and the bill dark with a <b>yellow</b> <b>tip.</b> The gape is a prominent yellow. Older birds grow darker until adult plumage is achieved, but juvenile tail markings only change to adult late in development. Birds appear to moult once a year in late summer after breeding. The pied currawong can live for over 20 years in the wild.|$|E
