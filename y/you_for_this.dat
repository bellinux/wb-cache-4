500|$|The two {{brothers}} had often argued, and {{earlier in the}} decade, studio employees claimed they saw Harry chase Jack through the studio with a lead pipe, shouting, [...] "I'll get <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>this,</b> {{you son of a}} bitch" [...] and threatening to kill him. This subterfuge, however, proved too much for Harry. He never spoke to Jack again. When Harry Warner died on July 27, 1958, Jack did not attend the funeral, and he departed for his annual vacation at Cap d'Antibes. [...] Asked to respond to his brother's death, Jack said, [...] "I didn't give a shit about Harry." [...] At the same time, Jack took pride in the fact that President Dwight D. Eisenhower sent him a letter of condolence.|$|E

500|$|In October 1868 Cosima {{asked her}} husband for a divorce, to which he would not {{initially}} agree. To sceptical enquirers he explained her absence from the von Bülow family home by a supposed visit to her half-sister in Versailles. In June 1869, immediately {{after the birth of}} her and Wagner's third and final child, Siegfried, Cosima wrote to von Bülow in what she called a [...] "final attempt at an understanding". His reply was conciliatory; he wrote: [...] "You have preferred to consecrate the treasures of your heart and mind to a higher being: far from censuring <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> step, I approve of it". Legal processes extended the marriage until 18 July 1870, when the divorce was finally sanctioned by a Berlin court. After the divorce von Bülow distanced himself from both Wagner and Cosima; he never again spoke to Wagner, and 11 years passed before his next meeting with Cosima.|$|E

He said that Remi had [...] "a lot of {{ideas about how to}} keep the good stuff we’d established in Season 1", and [...] "diminish the things that weren’t as strong". Steven Spielberg's original conception of Falling Skies was that the characters in the series would be nomadic. The idea for the second season was to [...] "create a mobile refugee camp made up of vehicles and rag-tag tents." [...] Chris Faloona, who was the Director of Photography in the first season, was unable to return due to commitments on another series, and Nate Goodman was hired. Aubuchon and Beeman discussed what was a head for the characters this season, and soon after, Beeman called Connor Jessup, who plays Ben Mason, and said [...] "I’ve just heard what the plans are for <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> season. [...] And my strong advice is that you get a trainer and start eating your Wheaties! [...] You are in a HUGE storyline is going to revolve around you… [...] You’re a warrior, you’re a skitter killer and you’re a badass!" [...] Jessup hired a trainer that very day.|$|E
500|$|Several {{explanations}} of {{the cause of the}} September 2008 attacks have been postulated. Many Christians believe that the attacks were a direct response from right-wing Hindu organisations who were targeting the people of Mangalore and the surrounding area because they had been outspoken about persecution of Christians in Orissa. St. Aloysius College, a Jesuit institution in Mangalore, and some other 2000 Christian schools in Karnataka, went on strike for varying periods between 29 August and 5 September prior to the attacks, protesting against anti-Christian persecution in Orissa, contrary to the orders of the government who stated that they were to be regular work days. Primary and secondary education minister Vishweshwar Hegde Kageri, responding to the shutting down of the Christian educational institutions in Karnataka, had directed the public education department to issue show-cause notices to schools that had objected to the violence against Christians in Orissa. A Christian institution in Shimoga had reportedly received a notice from the education ministry of Karnataka during the strike saying, [...] "The VHP and Bajrang Dal have conducted a protest against the closure of schools and criticised your action. They have submitted letters requesting action against <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>this.</b> In this context, you are asked to show cause as to why action should not be initiated against you for using religion as an excuse to announce a holiday and as to why permission to run your institution should not be withdrawn." [...] State Home Minister V. S. Acharya explained the reason for the notices, [...] "All Christian institutions are grant-in-aid institutions of the government and they should have had the courtesy to inform us before declaring a holiday. Their decision to act unilaterally cannot be tolerated." [...] The education minister was backed by the State President D. V. Sadananda Gowda, who issued a statement in which he stated that Christian education institutions had committed a crime by declaring holiday without obtaining the state government's permission. However, the Indian National Congress (INC) condemned Hegde's statement to take action against Christian education institutions and the leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Assembly, Mallikarjun Kharge, stated that [...] "The minister's statement is not proper. It may lead to law and order problem in the State." [...] Bajrang Dal proponents protested with banners outside the St. Aloysius College gates and across Mangalore on Saturday 31 August, the day after the college had closed for a holiday, chanting slogans such as, [...] "Jai Mata Di" [...] (Hail to the Mother) and [...] "Bharat Mata ki jai" [...] (Hail Mother India). It should be noted, however, that the closure of the schools in Mangalore were not alone; some 45,000 institutions across India had participated on 29 August in a [...] "prayer for peace and communal harmony" [...] in response to the events in Orissa.|$|E

2500|$|According to the Book of Exodus, God {{hardened}} Pharaoh's heart so {{he would}} {{be strong enough to}} persist in his unwillingness to release the people, so that God could manifest his great power and cause his power to be declared among the nations, so that other people would discuss it for generations afterward. In this view, the plagues were punishment for the Egyptians' long abuse of the Israelites, as well as proof that the gods of Egypt were false and powerless. If God triumphed over the gods of Egypt, a world power at that time, then the people of God would be strengthened in their faith, although they were a small people, and would not be tempted to follow the deities that God proved false. Exodus 9:15–16 (JPS Tanakh) portrays Yahweh explaining why he did not accomplish the freedom of the Israelites immediately: [...] "I could have stretched forth My hand and stricken you [...] and your people with pestilence, and you would have been effaced from the earth. Nevertheless I have spared <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> purpose: in order to show you My power and in order that My fame may resound throughout the world." ...|$|E
