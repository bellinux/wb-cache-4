500|$|The {{video was}} {{released}} on 11 August 2001. It begins with Minogue driving a De Tomaso Mangusta sports car on a futuristic bridge, while singing the [...] "la la la" [...] hook of the song. The next scene consists {{of a number of}} dance couples performing a dance routine dressed in black and white costumes; they are soon joined by Minogue, who is seen wearing a white tracksuit. The setting changes to a room where Minogue is seen striking various poses sporting bright crimson lipstick and a hooded white jumpsuit with a neckline plunging down to her navel. The outfit was designed by London-based fashion designer Fee Doran, under the label of Mrs Jones. Minogue then performs a synchronised dance routine with several backup dancers, who are wearing red and black suits. As the video ends, she performs a similar routine {{on the top of a}} building during the night, this time wearing a lavender halter neck dress with ribbon tile trim. Various scenes in the video show Minogue's face [...] "unusually" [...] close to the lens of the camera, thus it [...] "subtly distorts, yet remains glamorous." [...] Shadforth felt the shot gave a [...] "sort of sense of intimacy and as <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>a</b> sort of strangeness," [...] again drawing upon the suggestion of Minogue being an alien. Similarly, Morley opined that it was [...] "the side of Kylie that suddenly reveals itself as being experimental, she is prepared to push herself into positions and shapes that might not be conventionally attractive [...] She becomes alien Kylie as well." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1879, when Grand Duke Nicholas Mikhailovich was 20 years old, {{he visited}} the court of his {{maternal}} uncle, Grand Duke Friedrich I of Baden, {{and fell in love}} with his cousin, Princess Victoria of Baden. [...] "She is charming and pleases one immediately", he wrote, adding, [...] "She kisses you and makes <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>a</b> thousand things". [...] The Russian Orthodox Church, which prohibited first cousins to marry, would not permit any thought of marriage. [...] Nicholas nevertheless asked his uncle Alexander II to allow the wedding, threatening that if he were not allowed to marry Victoria of Baden, he would never marry. Permission was not granted; Princess Victoria eventually became Queen of Sweden.|$|E

2500|$|Albini's lyrics drew {{criticism}} for apparent racism and homophobia. Racism {{was a frequent}} theme in Big Black songs, influenced partly by the sharp racial divisions present in Chicago at the time. The word [...] "darkie" [...] appeared in {{the first line of}} the Lungs EP, but Albini defended its use as a comical term, saying [...] "in a way that's a play on the concept of a hateful word. Can a word that's so inherently hilarious be hateful? I don't know." [...] He similarly defended his use of gay jokes and the word [...] "fag": [...] "Given how intermingled the gay and punk subcultures were, it was assumed by anyone involved that open-mindedness, if not free-form experimentation, was the norm. With that assumption under your belt, joke all you like. The word 'fag' isn't just a gay term, it's funny on its own — phonetically — like the words 'hockey puck,' 'mukluks,' 'gefilte fish,' and 'Canada. Some critics viewed these defenses as mere justifications for actual deep-seated racism, homophobia, and misogyny on Albini's part, given his level of familiarity with the subject matter, but he insisted that he was not a prejudiced person and was merely satirizing those impulses that rational, civilized persons normally suppress in the course of social interaction: [...] "So once that's given, once you know what you think, there's no reason to be ginger about what <b>you</b> <b>say.</b> <b>A</b> lot of people, they're very careful not to say things that might offend certain people or do anything that might be misinterpreted. But what they don't realize is that the point of all this is to change the way you live your life, not the way you speak." ...|$|E
