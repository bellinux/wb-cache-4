5|$|As {{human populations}} increase, {{and as they}} build houses in low-lying areas or fish or hunt near water, {{incidents}} are inevitable where American alligators intrude, or at least appear to intrude, on human life. Since 1948, 257 documented attacks on humans in Florida (about five incidents per <b>year)</b> <b>have</b> been reported, of which an estimated 23 resulted in death. Only nine fatal attacks occurred in the United States throughout the 1970s–1990s, but American alligators killed 12 people between 2001 and 2007. In May 2006, American alligators killed three Floridians {{in less than a}} week. There have been at least 28 fatal attacks by American alligators in the United States since 1970.|$|E

40|$|This is {{study of}} {{morphological}} and physical characteristic of bamboo from species Schizostachyum brachycladum. The bamboo samples {{were taken in}} Pergau jungle area, next to Pergau Dam. Bamboo culm of aged 1, 2, 3 and 4 years were used in this study. For the morphological study, the investigations that were carried out were on the rhizomes, shoots,culms, culm sheaths, branches, clump formation and leaves. For physical characteristic study. the whole culm consisting of node 1 to node 12 were used. This study involves three characteristics which are internodes leght, diemeter of internodes length of 81. 38 cm, 2 <b>years</b> old <b>has</b> 88. 65 cm, 3 <b>years</b> old <b>has</b> 88. 82 cm and 4 <b>years</b> <b>has</b> 93. 26 cm. For internodes diameter, the bamboo culm of 1 <b>years</b> old <b>has</b> average internodes diameter of 6. 79 cm, 2 <b>years</b> <b>has</b> 6. 50 cm, 3 <b>years</b> old <b>has</b> 4. 90 cm and 4 <b>years</b> old <b>has</b> 4. 91 cm.

5|$|For many years, revellers {{celebrating the}} New <b>Year</b> <b>have</b> {{gathered}} in the square {{despite a lack of}} celebrations being arranged. The lack of official events was partly because the authorities were concerned that encouraging more partygoers would cause overcrowding. Since 2003, a firework display centred on the London Eye and South Bank of the Thames has been provided as an alternative. Since 2014, New Year celebrations have been organised by the Greater London Authority in conjunction with the charity Unicef, who began ticketing the event to control crowd numbers.|$|E
5|$|Young {{southern}} boobooks {{are usually}} paler than adults, {{and do not}} attain adult plumage properly until their third or fourth year. Juveniles (up to a year old) have whitish underparts and foreneck, a larger and more prominent pale eyebrow and larger whitish spots on their upperparts. The tips of their feathers are white and fluffy, remnants of the nestlings' down. These are worn away over time, persisting longest on the head. The feathers of the head, neck and underparts are fluffier overall. Immatures in their second and third <b>year</b> <b>have</b> plumage more like adults, though their crowns are paler and more heavily streaked.|$|E
5|$|Alpine {{symbolism}} {{has played}} {{an essential role}} in shaping {{the history of the country}} and the Swiss national identity. Nowadays some concentrated mountain areas have a strong highly energetic ski resort culture in winter, and a hiking (ger: das Wandern) or Mountain biking culture in summer. Other areas throughout the <b>year</b> <b>have</b> a recreational culture that caters to tourism, yet the quieter seasons are spring and autumn when there are fewer visitors. A traditional farmer and herder culture also predominates in many areas and small farms are omnipresent outside the cities. Folk art is kept alive in organisations all over the country. In Switzerland it is mostly expressed in music, dance, poetry, wood carving and embroidery. The alphorn, a trumpet-like musical instrument made of wood, has become alongside yodeling and the accordion an epitome of traditional Swiss music.|$|E

5|$|In April 1982, {{the first}} Nationals {{was held at}} Loyola Marymount University in California—16 states and the District of Columbia participated. However, the competition's founder, Dr. Robert Peterson, was {{inspired}} by the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. He hoped to make Academic Decathlon an international event, and so at the 1984 Nationals, Canada, Mexico, and New Zealand fielded teams in addition to teams from 32 U.S. states. The inclusion of foreign countries did not become a regular occurrence, however. There was no more international participation until 1989, when teams from Northern Ireland and Rio de Janeiro competed. Since then, {{no more than a few}} teams a <b>year</b> <b>have</b> competed at Nationals. Since the first national event in 1982, only three states have ever won the National Competition: California, Texas, and Wisconsin, with California having won the majority of the National Competitions. El Camino Real High School from California currently holds the record for the most wins, having won its sixth national title in 2010. The current National Champion is Granada Hills Charter High School from Granada Hills, California.|$|E
5|$|The sand whiting is a {{schooling}} species, whose {{movements are}} associated with a variety of factors including prey, lunar patterns and spawning movements; although there appears to be little consistency in its movements in relation to these factors. Studies on the species over the period of a <b>year</b> <b>have</b> shown the species does not change its local distribution {{over the course of a}} day, generally being of the same abundance during both night and day. Seasonal abundance due to spawning is variable, with studies conducted in Moreton Bay, Queensland finding the species recruits heavily to shallow waters and increase numbers during winter months, while studies in the Noosa River estuary have shown no difference in numbers recruited over the course of a season. Like other sillaginids, they have the ability to 'burrow' into the sand and remained hidden until a predator or seine net has passed by.|$|E
