500|$|I quaked {{a little}} as we began our quartet 'A Right-down Regular Royal Queen.' [...] But [...] numbers seemed to amuse the real Queen more than {{anything}} else in the opera, and, indeed, who could so well as she see the point of them? [...] The very fact of her choosing this opera from all the others to be played before her shows how vivid was her sense of fun, and how truly British was her willingness to laugh at herself. [...] There was... only one encore... nd who do <b>you</b> <b>suppose</b> was singled out for that honour? Who but I who write this, little Jessie Bond... for my song in the first act, 'When a Merry Maiden Marries.' ...|$|E

500|$|The {{controversy}} promoted polemics regarding September Morn and censorship, {{and multiple}} editorial cartoons; one depicted {{a young woman}} bathing, only her head showing, with a caption attributed to Comstock reading [...] "Don't <b>you</b> <b>suppose</b> I can imagine what is UNDER the water?". Comstock called the work [...] "demoralizing in the extreme and especially calculated to excite immodesty in the young", arguing {{that it must be}} suppressed {{in the interest of the}} children. He emphasized that [...] "the law is the law... the picture will have to come out of the window". Reverend Sydney Ussher of St. Bartholomew's Episcopal Church took a more moderate approach, explaining that [...] "so vivid a display of nudity as September Morn" [...] would best not be displayed in the United States, owing to the people's relative lack of appreciation for art.|$|E
500|$|For three years, from 1787 to 1790, Dissenters {{had been}} {{attempting}} to convince Parliament {{to repeal the}} Test and Corporation Acts which limited {{the civil rights of}} Dissenters. After the repeal was voted down for the third time, Barbauld burst onto the public stage after [...] "nine years of silence." [...] Her highly charged pamphlet is written in a biting and sarcastic tone; it opens, [...] "we thank you for the compliment paid the Dissenters, when <b>you</b> <b>suppose</b> that the moment they are eligible to places of power and profit, all such places will at once be filled with them." [...] She argues that Dissenters deserve the same rights as any other men: [...] "We claim it as men, we claim it as citizens, we claim it as good subjects." [...] Moreover, she contends that it is precisely the isolation forced on Dissenters by others that marks them out, not anything inherent in their form of worship. Finally, appealing to British patriotism, she maintains that the French cannot be allowed to outstrip the English in liberty.|$|E
500|$|Balzac {{demonstrated}} {{these beliefs}} through the characters' lives in La Cousine Bette. The conflict between Baron Hulot and the perfumer Crevel mirrors the animosity between the aristocracy of the Ancien Régime {{and the newly}} developed bourgeoisie of traders and industrial entrepreneurs. Although he despised the socialist politics of Eugène Sue, Balzac worried that bourgeois desperation for financial gain drove people from life's important virtues. The characters– especially Bette, Valérie, and Crevel– are fixated on their need for money, and do whatever they must to obtain it. As Crevel explains to Adeline: [...] "Vous vous abusez, cher ange, si vous croyez que c'est le roi Louis-Philippe qui règne... au-dessus de la Charte il y a la sainte, la vénérée, la solide, l'aimable, la gracieuse, la belle, la noble, la jeune, la toute-puissante pièce de cent sous!" [...] ("You are quite mistaken, my angel, if <b>you</b> <b>suppose</b> that King Louis-Philippe rules us... supreme above the Charter reigns the holy, venerated, substantial, delightful, obliging, beautiful, noble, ever-youthful, and all-powerful five-franc piece!") ...|$|E

500|$|In November 1921 Joseph {{organised}} the Morley {{forces to}} perform a large-scale pageant, celebrating the bicentenary {{of the church of}} St Martin-in-the-Fields. The text was by Laurence Housman and the music, directed by Holst, was taken from the Morley repertory. In the following year Joseph's increasing recognition as a composer was confirmed when her Seven Two-Part Songs were performed at a SWM concert that included works by Ethel Smyth and other women composers. Two of Joseph's works, A Hymn for Whitsuntide and A Festival Venite were introduced during the 1922 Whitsun festival at All Saints' church, Blackheath, with Holst conducting. After the Venite premiere Joseph wrote appreciatively to Holst: [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>suppose</b> for one moment that any other conductor takes trouble like that? If you do, you are quite wrong". The Venite was performed on 13 June 1923 at the Queen's Hall, by the Philharmonic Choir under Charles Kennedy Scott; the Spectators critic thought it a [...] "very notable addition to modern British music". Amidst her compositional and other activities, Joseph found time, in 1922, to organise the first Kensington Musical Competition Festival, and to orchestrate many of the competition songs. In due course this festival became an important annual event in Kensington; Vaughan Williams was among the adjudicators. On 12 October 1922, Vaughan Williams's 50th birthday, Joseph organised a choir which gave an early-morning surprise performance in the composer's garden of a song she had written to mark the occasion.|$|E
500|$|Many {{of these}} attacks are {{considered}} to have been scurrilous, including suggestions that {{he was planning to}} [...] "crown himself king" [...] and [...] "grooming John Quincy as heir to the throne". However, Peter Shaw has argued that: [...] "he inevitable attacks on Adams, crude as they were, stumbled on a truth that he did not admit to himself. He was leaning toward monarchy and aristocracy (as distinct from kings and aristocrats) at the time he wrote 'Davila', though he did not directly reveal this in its essays. Decidedly, sometime after he became vice-president, Adams concluded that the United States would have to adopt a hereditary legislature and a monarch... and he outlined a plan by which state conventions would appoint hereditary senators while a national one appointed a president for life." [...] In contradiction to such notions, Adams asserted in a letter to Thomas Jefferson: [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>suppose</b> that I have ever had a design or desire of attempting to introduce a government of King, Lords and Commons, or in other words an hereditary Executive, or an hereditary Senate, either into the government of the United States, or that of any individual state, in this country, you are wholly mistaken. There is not such a thought expressed or intimated in any public writing or private letter of mine, and I may safely challenge all of mankind to produce such a passage and quote the chapter and verse." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 1942 {{letter to}} United States Attorney General Francis Biddle, John Steinbeck wrote: [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>suppose</b> {{you could ask}} Edgar's boys to stop {{stepping}} on my heels? They think I am an enemy alien. It is getting tiresome." [...] The FBI denied that Steinbeck was under investigation.|$|E

2500|$|A 1998 {{article in}} The Daily Telegraph quoted a {{spokesperson}} for the Department of Trade and Industry (the government department that, at that time, regulated radio broadcasting in the United Kingdom) as saying [...] "These [...] are what <b>you</b> <b>suppose</b> they are. People shouldn't be mystified by them. They are not for, shall we say, public consumption." ...|$|E
2500|$|Predating {{the modern}} age of pornography, facials were {{described}} in literature. As an example, the French aristocrat Marquis de Sade wrote about performing facials in his work The 120 Days of Sodom, written in 1785. One passage of the novel reads [...] "... I show them my prick, then what do <b>you</b> <b>suppose</b> I do? I squirt the fuck in their face... That's my passion my child, I have no other... and you're about to behold it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Eternal {{salvation}} {{is equally}} close to everyone. There is {{no distinction between}} the simple and the wise. He says, [...] "If one was not what in a more elevated way is called a simple man, but what in plain, everyday speech is called a real simpleton, and you, my listener, were a wise person who profoundly asked, [...] "What is truth?" [...] and restlessly pondered the question with competence and success-do <b>you</b> <b>suppose</b> it would disturb you if he became just as blessed as you and heaven's infinite salvation made you both equal?" ...|$|E

But why should we hear about body bags and deaths, and how many, what day it's gonna happen, and how many this or that or what do <b>you</b> <b>suppose?</b> Or, I mean, it's not relevant.

2500|$|Carlton Blanchard: {{played by}} William Hickey, Carlton {{is an old}} man with a high-pitched nasal voice whose {{outwardly}} meek yet privately demanding behavior causes everyone who meets him to shudder at his coming. He is also known for asking bizarre questions such as [...] "If you were to carpet Florida, {{how long would it take}} to vacuum it?" [...] and [...] "If a monkey were to bite you, what kind of drugs do <b>you</b> <b>suppose</b> they'd give you?". He annoys Joe, Brian, Lowell and Antonio when he wins a charity contest sponsored by Sandpiper and demands to be flown to Las Cruces, New Mexico, far beyond the scope of Sandpiper's routes.|$|E

2500|$|The {{expedition}} left Ovalau on 6 October 1859 {{and sailed}} west around {{the northern end}} of the main island of Viti Levu to Waya. During their passage to the island, Lieutenant Caldwell’s men heard many stories from towns and villages about the warriors of Waya. A letter was also received from the Wayan chiefs {{responsible for the deaths of}} the two American traders. The message said, “Do <b>you</b> <b>suppose</b> we have killed the two white men for nothing? No, we killed them and we have eaten them. We are great warriors, and we delight in war.” Caldwell later wrote, “...and woe to the members of any strange tribe that falls into their hands... to be clubbed to death and eaten is the only alternative for the captive. It is not a matter of surprise that the tribes along our route learned with feelings of satisfaction the nature of our expedition.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Mahaffey {{also stated}} that after the murder of Virgil Starks, the police made the {{farmhouse}} off limits to everybody. [...] "Several nights later, I was holding forth in the Arkansas police station when a call came through that a neighbor had seen strange lights in the farmhouse. We sped to the scene and I hid behind a car while Police Chief Max Tackett and three other patrolmen approached the house. Chief Tackett yelled into the house that the place was surrounded and the Phantom might as well give up. Who do <b>you</b> <b>suppose</b> walked out? None other than Lone Wolf Gonzaullas of the Texas Rangers and a woman photographer from Life and Time magazines. Lone Wolf explained rather sheepishly {{that he had been}} re-enacting the crime and the young lady was taking pictures of him. Police Chief Tackett turned to me and shouted {{at the top of his}} voice, 'Mahaffey, you can quote me as saying that the Phantom Murders will never be solved until Texarkana gets rid of the big city press and the Texas Rangers.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Captain Jack, {{like most}} army officers, looked upon {{reservations}} as temporary reserves where Indians {{would begin to}} learn about the American way of life. [...] He believed that Indians were capable of great change and that private land ownership would lead to their ultimate assimilation into American society. [...] Captain Jack also believed Native Americans would observe modern life and different cultures, acquire new skills and customs, and change at their own pace and terms. Crawford was angry with the Indians about Custer and the Little Big Horn, and his early performances and poems portray the Indian as a dangerous but worthy opponent. [...] His later performances and poems are more sympathetic, and focus on shared universal emotions with whites. [...] Crawford held progressive views of Indians, including the sanctioning of interracial marriages, which he depicted in poetry and short stories. Captain Jack promoted Indian education and opposed off-reservation boarding schools. He believed that education should be provided close to home [...] "under the eyes of the parents, who must thereby learn to respect education. [...] "He had witnessed [...] "a child torn from his screaming mother's arms and hurried away" [...] and asked a reporter, [...] "Don't <b>you</b> <b>suppose</b> that mother has the same feeling in her breast for her young as your mother had for you?" [...] In 1889, Crawford served as special agent for the U.S. Justice Department of Justice, spending the next four years investigating illegal liquor traffic and fighting alcoholism on Indian reservations in the western states and territories.|$|E
