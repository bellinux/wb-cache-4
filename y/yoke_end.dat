50|$|The yoke {{arrangement}} {{is similar to}} ’58 Pattern, though the strap adjustment was much simpler. The haversack had a similar pick handle storage attachment arrangement to ’58 webbing between the shoulder blades. It {{is attached to the}} rear of the yoke with the help of two doubled ¾ inch wide nylon straps passing through plastic D-rings on the top rear of the sack and adjustable at the <b>yoke</b> <b>end</b> by the same type of green buckle used elsewhere. The front and back strap arrangements allowed the webbing to be easily drawn in or let out dependent on load. A pair of straps was also fastened to D-rings threaded onto the rear yoke straps, to allow a sleeping bag or poncho to be carried on top.|$|E
40|$|Evaluation of {{magnetic}} properties of electrical steel is vital {{in improving the}} quality of electrical machinery since it is used as magnetic cores for transformers, motors and generators. A double yoke single sheet tester (SST) was modeled using two identical C-cores wound with copper wires at limb side in horizontal arrangement. The magnetic properties for electrical steels, grade M 4 and M 19 were tested under a frequency of 50 Hz with the current ranging from 0. 2 to 2. 4 A. The effects of the sample dimension and anisotropy on magnetic measurements were investigated. Evaluation on specimen dimensions indicate that the non-uniformity of sample magnetization in overhang sample can attribute to the flux leakage between the yoke legs. The stray flux is also increased with the overhang sample. However, the so-called fit-in sample which is fitted nicely between the <b>yoke</b> <b>end</b> poles can minimize the effect of stray flux. One way ANOVA and T-test were used as statistical methods and executed at the 5 % significance level. It is statistically proven that the magnetic properties of both magnetic materials are influenced by their anisotropy...|$|E

40|$|The {{design of}} fast ramped superferric magnets with {{repetition}} {{rates in the}} order of 1 Hz requires reliable software tools to calculate the complex 3 D magnetic field quality as well as the impact of eddy currents and hysteresis losses. Various technological construction details should be taken into account to obtain a high field quality. We present a methodical study of these problems based on ANSYS calculations for simplified dipole models. The results of this analysis are compared with recently published results obtained by different special codes, i. e. an integral and the FIT method. The time dependencies of the eddy current power due to longitudinal magnetic field component at the <b>yoke</b> <b>ends,</b> the transient field distribution in the yoke volume and the total eddy current loss are investigated, using identical geometries with the same magnetic and electric properties of the lamination steel as used by the other codes. According to the results of this investigation the appli-cation potential of the different methods is discussed...|$|R

40|$|The National Synchrotron Light Source-II (NSLS-II) {{storage ring}} at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) will be {{equipped}} with 54 dipole magnets having a gap of 35 mm, and 6 dipoles having a gap of 90 mm. Each dipole has a field of 0. 4 T and provides 6 degrees of bending for a 3 GeV electron beam. The large aperture magnets are necessary to allow the extraction of long-wavelength light from the dipole magnet to serve {{a growing number of}} users of low energy radiation. The dipoles must not only have good field homogeneity (0. 015 % over a 40 mm x 20 mm region), but the integral transfer functions and integral end harmonics of the two types of magnets must also be matched. The 35 mm aperture dipole has a novel design where the <b>yoke</b> <b>ends</b> are extended up to the outside dimension of the coil using magnetic steel nose pieces. This design increases the effective length of the dipole without increasing the physical length. These nose pieces can be tailored to adjust the integral transfer function as well as the homogeneity of the integrated field. One prototype of each dipole type has been fabricated to validate the designs and to study matching of the two dipoles. A Hall probe mapping system has been built with three Group 3 Hall probes mounted on a 2 -D translation stage. The probes are arranged with one probe in the midplane of the magnet and the others vertically offset by {+-} 10 mm. The field is mapped around a nominal 25 m radius beam trajectory. The results of measurements in the as-received magnets, and with modifications made to the nose pieces are presented...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. EMMA is a 20 MeV non-scaling Fixed Field Alternating Gradient {{accelerator}} (nsFFAG) proof-of-principle prototype, to be {{built at}} Daresbury Laboratory in the UK as an accelerator physics experiment to explore the behaviour of such machines. The magnet designs present major challenges- the lattice {{is made up of}} 84 quadrupoles, with different horizontal offsets from the magnet centres in the focusing and defocusing quads. These offsets alone provide the necessary bending fields in the ring. The magnets are also very thin (55 mm and 65 mm <b>yoke</b> lengths) and <b>end</b> field effects therefore dominate. Careful design, followed by prototype construction and measurement, is essential. The magnets have been designed in 3 D from the outset, using the CST EM Studio software. The paper will present the results of the design, showing how the magnets have been optimised to improve the integrated good gradient region, and will report on the progress of the prototyping work...|$|R
40|$|After {{practically}} {{all of the}} southern-rim countries of the Mediterranean gained their independence, the process of national construction has been predicated on authoritarian regimes. These regimes justified both {{the use of force}} against political opposition and the limits on rights and liberties on the need for maintaining the unanimity of the people which had manifested itself during the struggles for liberation from the colonial <b>yoke.</b> Towards the <b>end</b> of the 1980 s, the regional and international context seemed to presage a very much longed for opening-up of the political scene after some of these countries (Tunisia, Algeria and Jordan) initiated a series of movements that pointed to their democratisation. The posterior evolution of events has crushed those hopes in every case, and only Morocco and Jordan (each with their respective limitations) appear to have evolved towards a softening of repression. The excuse put forth from the collection of states in the region to justify the step backwards is the existence of two threats they must act with forcefulness before: the threat of Islamic “fundamentalism” and the desire of certain groups to boycott the on-going Israeli-Palestinian Peace Process...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyse the {{representation}} of women in English jest-books of the early seventeenth century. This period of time is particularly interesting because of the large amount of jest-books that were brought out then, because the formal controversy about women was at its height, and because it was the age when more and more English female writers started to publish. Criticism has generally neglected the study of jest-books, most likely due to their deficient literary quality and apparent frivolity. Yet, they are cultural products of unquestionable interest to probe attitudes and anxieties of the society that has created them. The representation of women in these texts tends to reflect the misogyny prevailing at the time, insisting on clichés such as women as lustful, shrewish and gossiping. Many of these jests are devised to laugh at women who are (ab) used as sexual objects or the victims of mens violence. Male and female antimisogynists of the time complained about this use of humour to degrade women. And, as one of the jests hints, there were unruly women who could not endure to bear the <b>yoke.</b> At the <b>end</b> of Book II of The Book of the Courtier (1528), first translate...|$|R
50|$|In the 5th {{century the}} eastern part of Armenia, {{including}} Artsakh, remained under Persian rule. In 451 the Armenians in response to the policy of compulsion of their Zoroastrian Persian overlords organized a powerful revolt known as the Vardan war. Artsakh took part in that war, its cavalry having particularly distinguished itself. After the suppression of the revolt by Persia the considerable part of the Armenian forces took shelter in the impregnable fortresses and thick woods of Artsakh to continue further struggle against the foreign <b>yoke.</b> At the <b>end</b> of the same century Artsakh and neighboring Utik united under the rule of the Aranshakhiks with Vachagan the Devout at the head (487-510’s). Under the latter a considerable rise in culture and science is observed in Artsakh. According to the evidence of a contemporary, in those years in the land there were built as many churches and monasteries as there are days in a year. At the turn of the 7th century the Albanian marzpanate broke up into several small principalities. In the south Artsakh and Utik created a separate Armenian principality, that of the Aranshakhiks. In the 7th century the Armenian Aranshakhiks were replaced by the Migranians or Mihranids, a dynasty of Persian origin which, becoming related with the Aranshakhiks, turned to Christianity and became rapidly Armenicized. In {{the second half of the}} 7th century in the initial period of the Arab dominion, political and cultural life in Artsakh did not cease. In the 7th and 8th centuries a distinctive Christian culture was shaped. The monasteries Amaras, Orek, Katarovank, Djrvshtik and others acquired a significance that transcended the local area and spread across the Armenian lands.|$|R
5000|$|The team is {{represented}} {{through a number}} of images and symbols, including the maple leaf logo found on the club's uniform, and their mascot. The Maple Leafs' jersey has a long history {{and is one of the}} best-selling NHL jerseys among fans. Throughout franchise history, Toronto's uniform has had four major incarnations and many minor alterations. The club's first uniforms were blue and featured the letter T. The first major alteration came in 1919, when the club was renamed the St. Patricks. The uniforms were green with [...] "Toronto St. Pats" [...] on the logo, lettered in green either on a white [...] "pill" [...] shape or stripes.When the club was renamed the Maple Leafs in the 1927-28 season, the logo was changed, and the team reverted to blue uniforms. The logo was a 48-point maple leaf with the words lettered in white. The home jersey was blue with alternating thin-thick stripes on the arms, legs and shoulders. The road uniform was white with three stripes on the chest and back, waist and legs. For 1933-34, the alternating thin-thick stripes were replaced with stripes of equal thickness. This remained the basic design for the next 40 years. In 1937, veins were added to the leaf and [...] "Toronto" [...] curved downwards at the ends instead of upwards. In 1942, the 35-point leaf was introduced. In 1946, the logo added trimming to the Leaf with a white or blue border, while [...] "C" [...] for captain and [...] "A" [...] for alternate captain first appeared on the sweaters. In 1947, the [...] "Toronto Maple Leafs" [...] lettering was in red for a short time. In 1958, a six-eyelet lace and tie was added to the neck and a blue shoulder yoke was added.
