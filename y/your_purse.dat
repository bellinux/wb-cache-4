[...] This preamble argues that the prostitute is of benefit to the public, able to relieve man's natural inclination towards violence. [...] It describes the customer as a patron supportive of a good cause: [...] "be <b>your</b> <b>purse</b> strings never closed; nor let the name of prostitute deter you from your pious resolve!" [...] Prostitutes were generally scorned by 18th-century society, and the 1789 edition's preface complains [...] "Why should the victims of this natural propensity... be hunted like outcasts from society, perpetually gripped by the hand of petty tyranny", continuing: [...] "Is not the minister of state who sacrifices his country's honour to his private interest... more guilty than her?" ...|$|E

40|$|Economics, {{which has}} greatly {{advanced}} deterrence theory, {{has made no}} contribution to understanding how law changes peoples’ values. I combine economics and psychology to offer the framework for such a theory. Rational self-development involves treating yourself as the means to achieve <b>your</b> ends. <b>Pursing</b> ends changes objective opportunities and subjective values. The theory of cognitive dissonance predicts how changing opportunities changes values. If the connection between opportunities and values is strong enough, one choice may dominant the alternatives. A dominant choice is preferred when evaluated by using any likely values. I call a choice that is better {{with respect to the}} likely values of a decision-maker a “Pareto self-improvement. ” By creating opportunities for Pareto self-improvement, law changes peoples’ values. Law’s ability to change behavior by changing values, however, occurs slowly, whereas law changes behavior quickly by other means such as deterrence...|$|R
