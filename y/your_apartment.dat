500|$|Ladytron's mix of [...] "Like Eating Glass" [...] {{replaces the}} lead and rhythm guitars with looped {{synthesisers}} and adds {{a large amount of}} reverberation to the vocals; the resulting effect was described by Pitchfork Media's Nitsuh Adebe as [...] "walking out of <b>your</b> <b>apartment</b> and thinking you can hear Bloc Party playing a festival six blocks over". Whitey reworked [...] "Helicopter" [...] in a minimalist fashion and introduced wolf howls and a xylophone staccato to the song. The musician's effects gave the track a rawer sound than the original version according to Heather Phares of Allmusic. [...] "Positive Tension" [...] was remixed by Jason Clark of art punk band Pretty Girls Make Graves under the pseudonym [...] "Blackbox". The song includes elements of oldschool jungle. The Paul Epworth edit of single [...] "Banquet", under his [...] "Phones" [...] moniker, is more sparse than the original and is closer to dance music than indie rock.|$|E
2500|$|In the September 1, 1995, {{article for}} the Shambhala Sun, [...] "bell hooks talks to John Perry Barlow", Barlow {{reflects}} upon Cynthia Horner passing away: [...] "It {{seems to me that}} what we’re here to do is to learn about love in the presence of fear... You pass away from the moment into the infinite, where there are no moments and where there’s no time. Here in an embodied state, the body, like all physical things, participates in entropy and all the other artifacts of time. There’s a thin but nevertheless impermeable membrane between the chronological and the timeless that has become much more real to me since my lover died a year ago. Even though I feel her soul, the absence of her body feels like an enormous barrier. The absence of the spoken word, the absence of the sound of her voice, or the touch of her skin. All the things that only can be done by souls with bodies on them... But you know the only time that I feel in contact with her, really, is when her spirit temporarily borrows someone else’s body to dance. Like the moment that you and I were dancing up in <b>your</b> <b>apartment</b> a few months ago. And suddenly she was in you and I could feel her there. You quit dancing the way you danced and started dancing the way she danced. And it was almost like a practical joke that she was playing in a way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Got a grouch tonight, haven't you? You {{seem all}} flittered up about something. What's the trouble? Sore about my not {{showing up at}} <b>your</b> <b>apartment?</b> I'll explain that all right.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'The gentleman, R. W.,' said Mrs Wilfer, 'proposes to take <b>your</b> <b>apartments</b> by the quarter. A quarter's {{notice on}} either side.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'True,' said Dodson, 'I {{dare say}} you have been annoyed in the Fleet; there are some odd gentry there. Whereabouts were <b>your</b> <b>apartments,</b> Mr. Pickwick?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Will {{you let me}} {{take you}} back to <b>your</b> <b>apartments,</b> Lydie?" [...] urged Monsieur le Duc. [...] "I fear the {{excitement}} has seriously upset you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "True, I had forgot; {{they had}} their reasons for that, doubtless," [...] {{answered}} she. [...] "But the secret passage from <b>your</b> <b>apartment</b> is open, and you may go that way." ...|$|E
60|$|LADY CORINTHIA (gazing at {{him almost}} tenderly). Though {{you may not}} believe me, I find you are more {{interesting}} {{when you talk about}} music than when you are endeavoring to betray a woman who has trusted you by remaining alone with you in <b>your</b> <b>apartment.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Your worship," [...] {{said the}} good clergyman, [...] "had better retire to <b>your</b> <b>apartment,</b> {{and try to}} sleep for a little space. The {{physician}} left a composing draught; and our Great Physician has commanded us to use earthly means, {{that we may be}} strengthened to sustain the trials He sends us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear Marguerite," [...] he whispered, [...] "for {{an hour or}} so I {{must leave}} you. You will permit that my man takes you to <b>your</b> <b>apartments</b> and returns for me here?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And now," [...] said Uncle John, [...] "I {{want to know}} if I {{can keep}} my little room in <b>your</b> <b>apartments,</b> Patsy; or if you'd prefer me to find another {{boarding}} place." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come," [...] said Dr. Stein, [...] "your majesty {{should be}} in <b>your</b> <b>apartments,</b> away from all excitement, {{if we are to}} effect a cure, so that you may return to your throne quickly." ...|$|R
6000|$|SIR PETER. Yes, yes, madam, {{you were}} then in {{somewhat}} a humbler Style--the {{daughter of a}} plain country Squire. Recollect Lady Teazle when I saw you first--sitting at your tambour in a pretty figured linen gown--with a Bunch of Keys at your side, and <b>your</b> <b>apartment</b> hung round with Fruits in worsted, of your own working-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In your apartment?" [...] {{repeated}} Amy--"in <b>YOUR</b> <b>apartment?</b> It shall instantly {{be relieved}} of my presence." [...] She hastened towards the door; but the sad recollection of her deserted state at once pressed on her mind, and pausing on the threshold, she added, {{in a tone}} unutterably pathetic, [...] "Alas! I had forgot--I know not where to go--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By the by," [...] {{said the}} professor, looking uneasily about him, [...] "what {{singular}} fragrance is this in <b>your</b> <b>apartment?</b> Is it the perfume of your gloves? It is faint, but delicious; and yet, after all, {{by no means}} agreeable. Were I to breathe it long, methinks it would make me ill. It is like the breath of a flower; but I see no flowers in the chamber." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Will you {{not allow}} me, my daughter, to {{accompany}} you to <b>your</b> <b>apartments?</b> The Queen, remember, hath confided {{you to my}} charge; I would wish to see you safely in Her Grace of Lincoln's care." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I beg pardon, sir," [...] he said faintly, as {{his eyes}} fell on the marshal, who was {{standing}} {{just in front of}} him. [...] "I am sorry that I came into <b>your</b> <b>apartments</b> in this state, but it seemed to me--" ...|$|R
6000|$|And Mr. Fox {{declared}} that the duke was no coward, but all other epithets known might be called him. [...] "A very diverting evening, Richard," [...] said he; [...] "let's to <b>your</b> <b>apartments</b> and have a bowl, and talk it over." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Deauville, {{take this}} youth, Gervaise Tresham to your room. He is {{appointed}} {{one of the}} pages of the grand master. He is English, but he speaks French as well as you do, having lived in France for some years. Take him to <b>your</b> <b>apartment</b> and treat him kindly and well, seeing that he is a stranger and new to all here. Tomorrow he will go to the palace." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed, indeed, my sweetest mistress, I cannot," [...] replied Rose. [...] "It is {{even that}} {{circumstance}} of the guardian angel {{which makes me}} consider the whole as a dream. A Norman sentinel, whom I myself called from his post on purpose, did indeed come to your assistance, and, breaking into <b>your</b> <b>apartment,</b> transported you to that where I myself received you from his arms in a lifeless condition." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was dark}} when I awoke; I felt cold also, and half frightened, as it were, instinctively, finding myself so desolate. Before I had quitted <b>your</b> <b>apartment,</b> on a {{sensation}} of cold, I had covered myself with some clothes, {{but these were}} insufficient to secure me from the dews of night. I was a poor, helpless, miserable wretch; I knew, and could distinguish, nothing; but feeling pain invade me on all sides, I sat down and wept.|$|E
6000|$|... "O Prince," [...] he said maliciously, [...] "pardon me if I caution you. Yet {{in truth}} if veiled ladies flit thus through <b>your</b> <b>apartments</b> {{in the light}} of day, it will reach the ears of the holy but violent Issachar, of whose doings I come to speak. Then, Prince, I tremble for you." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} stages of the Karabakh {{movement}} leading up to the Nagorno-Karabakh War and days before the Sumgait pogrom, Hidayat Orujov, a leader of the Communist Party of Azerbaijan, warned Armenians in Sumgait: [...] "If you do not stop campaigning for the unification of Nagorno Karabakh with Armenia, if you don't sober up, 100,000 Azeris from neighboring districts will break into your houses, torch <b>your</b> <b>apartments,</b> rape <b>your</b> women, and kill your children." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "These are, {{to leave}} your Majesty," [...] replied Crevecoeur, [...] "undisputed {{possession}} of <b>your</b> own <b>apartments.</b> Such are my master's orders." ...|$|R
6000|$|Catherine recollected herself, blushed deeply, {{and could}} say no more. He {{seemed to be}} looking in her countenance for that {{explanation}} which her lips did not afford. She moved on towards the gallery. [...] "And may I not, in my turn," [...] said he, as he pushed back the folding doors, [...] "ask how you came here? This passage is at least as extraordinary a road from the breakfast-parlour to <b>your</b> <b>apartment,</b> as that staircase can be from the stables to mine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Cruel, cruel deserter! Oh, Jane, {{what did}} I feel when I {{discovered}} you had fled from Thornfield, and when I could nowhere find you; and, after examining <b>your</b> <b>apartment,</b> ascertained {{that you had}} taken no money, nor anything which could serve as an equivalent! A pearl necklace I had given you lay untouched in its little casket; your trunks were left corded and locked {{as they had been}} prepared for the bridal tour. What could my darling do, I asked, left destitute and penniless? And what did she do? Let me hear now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} yet told you that I have the {{advantage}} of you, Mr. Lydgate, and know you better than you know me. You remember Trawley who shared <b>your</b> <b>apartment</b> at Paris for some time? I was a correspondent of his, and he told me a good deal about you. I was not quite sure when you first came that you were the same man. I was very glad when I found that you were. Only I don't forget that you have not had the like prologue about me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{would be}} possible," [...] said Lincoln thoughtfully. [...] "Quite possible. Indeed, {{it shall be}} done." [...] He laughed. [...] "I came {{prepared}} to suggest amusements, but you have found one for yourself. I will telephone to the aeronautical offices from here and we will return to <b>your</b> <b>apartments</b> in the Wind-Vane Control. By the time you have dined the aeronauts {{will be able to}} come. You don't think that after you have dined you might prefer--?" [...] He paused.|$|R
6000|$|... "Welcome to Canaples, M. de Mancini!" [...] he exclaimed, as {{he hurried}} forward, {{with a smile}} so winning that his countenance {{appeared}} transfigured by it. [...] "Welcome most cordially! We had not hoped that you would arrive so soon, but fortunately my daughters, to whom you {{appear to have been}} of service at Choisy, warned me that you were journeying hither. <b>Your</b> <b>apartments,</b> therefore, are prepared for you, and we hope that you will honour Canaples by long remaining its guest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Francois, do {{you take}} charge of your cousin. I have told the serving men to let you have a meal in <b>your</b> own <b>apartments,</b> {{and then you can}} show him over the chateau and the stables." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Here {{you will}} sit, madam, {{with the young}} ladies," [...] said Mrs. Aylward. [...] "They have a maid-servant who will wait on you, and if you require anything, you will be pleased to speak to me. My Lady wishes you {{to take charge of}} them, and {{likewise}} to execute the piece of embroidery you will find in that frame, with the materials. This will be <b>your</b> <b>apartment,</b> and you can take the young ladies into the garden and park, wherever you please, except that they must not make a noise before the windows of the other wing, which you will see closed with shutters, for those are Mr. Belamour's rooms." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{the streets}} {{neighboring}} on Piccadilly {{there are many}} apartments which are effectively small hotels, where you pay a certain price for your rooms, and a certain fixed price for your meals. You must leave this neighborhood {{if you want the}} true lodging where you pay for <b>your</b> <b>apartment,</b> and order the provisions which are cooked for you, and which are apportioned to your daily needs. This is the ideal, and it is not seriously affected by the reality that your provisions are also apportioned to the needs of your landlord's family. Even then, the ideal remains beautiful, and you have an image, somewhat blurred and battered, of home, such as money cannot elsewhere buy you. If your landlord is the butler who has married the cook, your valeting and cooking approach as nearly perfection as you can hopefully demand.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{have the}} first juniper-berries that get ripe in our garden by the lake brought in for that special purpose," [...] said St. Clare, gravely pulling the bell as he did so; [...] "meanwhile, cousin, you must be wanting to retire to <b>your</b> <b>apartment,</b> and refresh {{yourself}} a little, after your journey. Dolph," [...] he added, [...] "tell Mammy to come here." [...] The decent mulatto woman whom Eva had caressed so rapturously soon entered; she was dressed neatly, with a high red and yellow turban on her head, the recent gift of Eva, and which the child had been arranging on her head. [...] "Mammy," [...] said St. Clare, [...] "I put this lady under your care; she is tired, and wants rest; take her to her chamber, and be sure she is made comfortable," [...] and Miss Ophelia disappeared {{in the rear of}} Mammy.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] Letitia complained, [...] "it's {{very clear}} {{what you are}} {{thinking}} of! You want <b>your</b> bachelor <b>apartments</b> in the Albany again, and the gay life. I really {{feel that it is}} my duty to remain a spinster and look after you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We are," [...] said Crevecoeur, {{who acted}} as the Marshal of the Duke's household, [...] "subjects of Burgundy, and must do our duty as such. Our hopes and prayers, and our efforts, {{will not be}} wanting to bring about peace and union between your Majesty and our liege Lord. Meantime, we must obey his commands. These other lords and knights will be proud to {{contribute}} to the convenience of the illustrious Duke of Orleans, of the brave Dunois, and the stout Lord Crawford. I myself must be your Majesty's chamberlain, and bring you to <b>your</b> <b>apartments</b> in other guise than would be my desire, remembering the hospitality of Plessis. You have only to choose your attendants, whom the Duke's commands limit to six." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Griffith," [...] he said, [...] "I {{shall not}} act hastily--you and your companions {{will be pleased}} to retire to <b>your</b> several <b>apartments.</b> I will so far respect the son of my brother Harry's friend as to believe your parole will be sacred. Go, gentlemen; you are unguarded." ...|$|R
