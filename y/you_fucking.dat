It can be quite tricky. Sometimes we've had to change lines even when the filming is all finished. We go back to the recording studio and put one line over another line. ... The only reason I reckon we've not been sued is because actually we've not said anything that technically we can't." [...] He said the series was [...] "well looked after" [...] by attorneys. In a 2009 interview with The Independent, Bishop recounted an experience when he gave a copy of the program to television producers in the United States: [...] "I gave some American producers the Star Stories DVD and those that could be bothered to watch it saw the Tom Cruise one. One guy went 'you can't do that it's Tom Cruise man? [...] 'yeah but you can't do that on TV' [...] 'what you’re talking about Scientology, are <b>you</b> <b>fucking</b> nuts?? [...] has Tom Cruise seen this?!" ...|$|E

[...] Here's the sound of Sarah Palin's husband's snowmobile when it won't start. (followed by a loud screeching noise)." [...] While performing [...] "I Love New York" [...] during the request section, the line [...] "Get off my street" [...] was replaced by Madonna screaming [...] "You know who can get off of my street?

500|$|The {{band was}} {{still searching for}} a lead singer. Chimes recalls one Billy Watts (who [...] "seemed to be, like, {{nineteen}} or eighteen then, as we all were") handling the duties for a time. Rhodes had his eye on Strummer, with whom he made exploratory contact. Jones and Levene had both seen him perform and were impressed as well. Strummer, for his part, was primed to make the switch. In April, he had taken in the opening act {{for one of his}} band's gigs—the Sex Pistols. Strummer later explained:I knew something was up, so I went out in the crowd which was fairly sparse. And I saw the future—with a snotty handkerchief—right in front of me. It was immediately clear. Pub rock was, [...] "Hello, you bunch of drunks, I'm gonna play these boogies and I hope you like them." [...] The Pistols came out that Tuesday evening and their attitude was, [...] "Here's our tunes, and we couldn't give a flying fuck whether you like them or not. In fact, we're gonna play them even if <b>you</b> <b>fucking</b> hate them."On 30 May, Rhodes and Levene met surreptitiously with Strummer after a 101'ers gig. Strummer was invited to meet up at the band's rehearsal location on Davis Road.

[...] He also used the song as a platform to express his belief that Biggie was guilty of stealing his style of rapping, and was merely imitating his lifestyle. This notion is addressed in the verse in [...] "Now it's all about Versace, you copied my style." [...] He also touches topically on their early friendship with the line [...] "Biggie, remember when I used to let you sleep on the couch?" [...] and their subsequent fallout. Towards {{the end of the}} song Tupac disses Mobb Deep, saying [...] "Don't one of you niggas got sickle cell or something? <b>You</b> <b>fucking</b> with me, nigga you fuck around and get a seizure or a heart attack", referring to Prodigy, a member of Mobb Deep, suffering from sickle cell disease. Mobb Deep responded by releasing [...] "Drop a Gem on 'em", which was released shortly after Tupac's death, however recorded before.

Griffin said the man [...] "leaned {{out of the car and}} pointed at me and made a gun and gang gesture", and that he threatened him by shouting [...] "I'm going to...". Griffin said he had left the demonstration early, fearing for his safety. The 23-year-old defendant denied his comments had any racial intent, and was found not guilty. Griffin later commented [...] "I think it's unfortunate and I think it's wrong, but that's the jury's right. They saw all the evidence, I accept their decision.
