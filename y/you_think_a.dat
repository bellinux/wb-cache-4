5|$|Parsons' newfound {{credentials}} and financial security {{gave him the}} opportunity to travel more widely throughout the U.S. as an ambassador for Aerojet, meeting with other rocket enthusiasts. In New York he met with Karl Germer, the head of the O.T.O. in North America and in Washington, D.C. he met Poet Laureate Joseph Auslander, donating some of Crowley's poetry books to the Library of Congress. He also became a regular at the Mañana Literary Society, which met in Laurel Canyon at the home of Parsons' friend Robert A. Heinlein and included science fiction writers including Cleve Cartmill, Jack Williamson, and Anthony Boucher. Among Parsons' favorite works of fiction was Williamson's Darker Than <b>You</b> <b>Think,</b> <b>a</b> novelette published in the fantasy magazine Unknown in 1940, which inspired his later occult workings. Boucher used Parsons as a partial basis for the character of Hugo Chantrelle in his murder mystery Rocket to the Morgue (1942).|$|E

He added that [...] "the Na'vi represent something that is our higher selves, or our aspirational selves, what we would like to think we are" [...] and that even though there are good humans within the film, the humans [...] "represent what we know to be the parts of ourselves that are trashing our world and maybe condemning ourselves to a grim future".|$|E
500|$|Miller later {{noted that}} unlike other episode scenes {{such as in}} [...] "Grey Matters", Walter's {{breakdown}} at the supermarket [...] "came largely out of nowhere. It was a thought experiment that took {{on a life of}} its own." [...] Miller continued that at the time, he and Stentz thought they were writing Olivia-focused episodes, but [...] "In retrospect, we really wrote a four-part story about Walter, his relationship to children, and the struggle between Walter-who-was and Walter-who-is. If you look at it that way, his decision at the end of 'Northwest Passage' becomes the moment where he reconciles those things. He doesn't resolve them, but he comes to grips with them. Once again in retrospect, I think that's what the supermarket breakdown was really about. This happens — <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> scene is about one thing when you're in the middle of it, and realize it's something else entirely when you look back. Characters can be sneaky motherfuckers that way." ...|$|E

She participated in sports such as swimming and baseball and earned numerous badges as a Brownie and a Girl Scout. She has often told a story of being inspired by U.S. efforts during the Space Race and sending a letter to NASA around 1961 asking what {{she could do to}} become an astronaut, only to be informed that women were not being accepted into the program."After receiving more information from the National Air and Space Museum, specifically a [...] with a similar tone and message as the [...] and Clinton's account, we decided the claim met the [...] "reasonable person" [...] standard.

She attended Maine East High School, where she participated in the student council, the school newspaper and was selected for the National Honor Society.

For her senior year, she and other students were transferred to the then new Maine South High School, where she was a National Merit Finalist and was voted [...] "most likely to succeed". She graduated in her class's top five percent in 1965.|$|E

The suggestive lyrics attracted widespread press interest. The young singer was frequently asked salacious questions such as [...] "What do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> girl's most precious thing is?", to which she replied magokoro ("her devotion").|$|E

2500|$|Revisiting the {{commercial}} in Harper's Magazine {{thirty years after}} it aired, Rebecca Solnit suggested that [...] "1984" [...] did not so much herald {{a new era of}} liberation as a new era of oppression. She wrote, [...] "I want to yell at the liberatory young woman with her sledgehammer, 'Don't do it!' Apple is not different. That industry is going to give rise to innumerable forms of triviality and misogyny, to the concentration of wealth and the dispersal of mental concentration.

2500|$|Giles and O'Keefe {{have been}} criticized for {{accuracy}} problems. Their videos include the oft-repeated conservative claim that ACORN is expected to get up to $8.5 billion in government funds. But that's a bold exaggeration, as it includes $3 billion in stimulus funds set aside for revitalization efforts nationwide, and $5.5 billion in federal community development grants.The more than $8 billion number was based on the false assumption that ACORN would apply for and win every project and grant in the country, and in fact ACORN did not apply for any of the stimulus funds. Leonnig also observed:the videos, in some cases, left out what I would call some exculpatory material ... for example, in one, a San Bernadino employee at ACORN explains {{that there is no way}} ACORN would support what the couple were proposing, and she asks if they are putting her on, candid-camera style.During a September 14 television appearance on FOX, O'Keefe appeared dressed in a fur coat, sunglasses, and holding a cane. The host announced: [...] " [...] is dressed exactly in the same outfit that he wore to these ACORN offices up and down the eastern seaboard." [...] He asked, [...] "s that what <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> pimp looks like?" [...] O'Keefe answered yes. Within weeks, political journalist Mike Stark revealed that O'Keefe did not wear such clothing to the ACORN offices, but rather he wore subdued clothing and a tie, and in one instance posed as a candidate for Congress. Stark said, [...] "If they really wanted the truth out there, why do they need to edit these tapes in the first place? Why aren't the unedited videos already in the public domain?" ...|$|E
