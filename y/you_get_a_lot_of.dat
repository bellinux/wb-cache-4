500|$|Joel Bullock from The Coaster Critic and Mike from NewsPlusNotes both {{praised the}} g-forces {{experienced}} while {{going through the}} helix, {{and the amount of}} airtime Goliath has. Bullock described Goliath as, [...] "not only the park’s best roller coaster, but arguably the best coaster in the South East (south of Virginia)." [...] Mike Collins from Coaster Radio particularly enjoyed the section of the roller coaster that takes riders outside of the park boundaries. He also said that, [...] " [...] a fun and fast coaster.

John Fields produced [...] "Forget About It". Squire produced [...] "Time-Bomb" [...] and [...] "My Only One". Butch Walker produced [...] "Just the Way I'm Not". Kahne produced [...] "That Girl", {{to which}} Green provided additional production and was mixed by Chris Lord-Alge. U4L produced [...] "Merry Christmas, Kiss My Ass", which was mixed by Green. Asked about {{the choice of}} using several producers, Barakat said [...] "We're all about using multiple producers on our records. ... I'm not 100% into the one producer/one record thing because <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> the same sounding songs. It's cool to {{have a bunch of}} variety." [...] Gaskarth added [...] "working with a lot of different producers is good, because it pulls you in all kinds of new directions." [...] He added that, similar to Nothing Personal, they [...] "kinda split up the [...] with different producers that we wanted to work with in the past, but for scheduling or monetary reasons, we couldn’t lock them in for the whole record." ...|$|E
60|$|At {{one time}} they {{got the idea that}} what the public wanted was not {{anything}} instructive but something light and amusing. Mullins said that people loved to laugh. He said that if <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> people all together and get them laughing {{you can do anything you}} like with them. Once they start to laugh they are lost. So they got Mr. Dreery, the English Literature teacher at the high school, to give an evening of readings from the Great Humorists from Chaucer to Adam Smith. They came mighty near to making a barrel of money out of that. If the people had once started laughing it would have been all over with them. As it was I heard a lot of them say that they simply wanted to scream with laughter: they said they just felt like bursting into peals of laughter all the time. Even when, in the more subtle parts, they didn't feel like bursting out laughing, they said they had all they could do to keep from smiling. They said they never had such a hard struggle in their lives not to smile.|$|E

5000|$|Bruce {{was born}} in Musselburgh, near Edinburgh in Scotland. He was born John Charles Young, but adopted the stage name of Robert the Bruce, later {{shortened}} to Robert Bruce, and kept the name when he quit wrestling. In the ring he played the quintessential villain who prefaced every low blow with an evil smirk, once saying [...] "Honestly, it's better being a bad guy.

You cut it down from top to bottom: then you lay the two {{sections}} on their rounded sides: then <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> more of jam, which I see you have on the side table, and you spread the cut surfaces with it: then you put it together as it was before, and slice it along its shorter diameter. Good?" [...] said he; [...] "they are delicious." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is the way," [...] {{said the}} boy who had studied mechanics. [...] "You take a saw, and then, about two feet from the ground, you begin and saw down diagonally, for {{a foot and a}} half, to the centre of the trunk. Then you go on the other side, and saw down in the same way, the two outs meeting each other. Now you have {{the upper part of the}} trunk ending in a wedge, which fits into a cleft in the lower part of the trunk. Then, about nine inches below the place where you first began to saw, you bore a hole {{straight}} through both sides of the cleft and the wedge between them. Then you put an iron bolt through this hole, and you have your tree on a hinge, only she wont be apt to move because she fits in so snug and tight. Then you get a long rope, and put one end in a slipknot loosely around the trunk. Then <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> poles, and tie them end to end, and push this slip-knot up until it is somewhere near the top, when you pull it tight. Then you take another rope with a slip-knot, and push this a little more than half-way up the trunk. By having two ropes, that way, you prevent too much strain coming on any one part of the trunk. Then, after that, you take a mallet and chisel and round off the lower corners of the wedge, so that it will turn easily in the cleft. Then we take hold of the ropes, let her down gently, pick off the fruit, and haul her up again. That will all be easy enough." ...|$|E

Sure, <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> to do, but not many ways to do it.

5000|$|O'Connor {{became the}} {{youngest}} ever Super Rugby debutant at age 17, and the second youngest Wallaby in Australian rugby history at age 18. He is a versatile 'utility back'. When asked about his preferred position in 2009, he said, [...] "I feel more comfortable at 12 as a second ball player. I also like 15. <b>You</b> definitely <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of space.

6000|$|... "Yes, {{that would}} be awkward. However, if they do, we must keep the men below, and in the {{meantime}} <b>you</b> had better <b>get</b> your carpenter to cut up some spars and make <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of plugs in readiness to stop up any holes they make near the water-line. I don't think they are likely to make very ragged holes, the wood is so rotten the shot would go through the side as if it were brown paper; still, <b>you</b> might <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of squares of canvas ready, with hammers and nails." ...|$|R
5000|$|As in Chicago, Salvi {{opened a}} harp {{workshop}} business in New York City, {{first in the}} West 40s, later moving to West 54th Street. In 1954, he built his first harp in New York - a small, orchestral model. [...] "Playing the harp in orchestras <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> measures of rest, {{time to think about}} how the instrument is constructed and how it could be improved", Salvi told the New York Times in a 2005 interview. Ultimately, Salvi had to choose between either performing or the building of harps. He chose the latter, and moved to Europe where he knew he would have more affordable and skilled craftsmanship.|$|E
5000|$|... "Roy {{was one of}} {{the sweetest}} guys you'll ever meet, and a joy to work with. It was hilarious to watch him act, and see that stern, gravelly voice of Ben coming out of this gentle, soft-spoken man. Casting Roy was {{definitely}} the easiest decision we ever had to make at LucasArts. We had been through boxes of audition tapes without much luck--When you advertise that you're looking for a tough, biker character, <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> guys trying to be tough; Growling, yelling, and forcing a lot of attitude--And then we put in Roy's tape, and out came this effortless, deep, rich, bass sound. And that was that. We didn't even listen to another tape." ...|$|E
5000|$|It’s so {{much easier}} to work with {{something}} you’ve written, because you can cut things or add things on the spot. You can be much more at home and at ease with what you do. You don’t feel unfaithful to the writer because there is no writer. Most of the other films I’ve done I’ve co-written, and I prefer it. But having said that, when you work with someone else’s characters, <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> gifts. You get an entire world, you get to portray people that you couldn’t have made up, and entire worlds that are fascinating because they are not yours. It’s much harder, I really think it’s much harder ...|$|E

5000|$|Holmes {{was soon}} {{on the covers}} of {{magazines}} such as Seventeen, TV Guide, and Rolling Stone. Jancee Dunn, an editor at Rolling Stone said she was chosen for the cover because [...] "every time you mention Dawsons Creek <b>you</b> tend to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of dolphin-like shrieks from teenage girls.

6000|$|... "No--because it isn't {{a case of}} sitting--or a case of back to back.

50|$|Winning the Pulitzer {{has meant}} {{nothing for the}} piece that won. Back when Blomstedt was at the San Francisco Symphony, David Zinman {{conducted}} it and did a beautiful job. But they never did it again and nobody else has ever played it. It’s a very difficult piece. I write chromatic music and chromatic music is not in vogue at the moment. I think that has not helped things.The Prize has benefited me in other ways, however. <b>You</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> notoriety out of it. My commissions have soared and everything I have written since that time has been published. And I am {{fortunate enough to have}} some of the best musicians in the world playing my chamber music, which has led to a CD that has just come out.|$|E
5000|$|The {{environment}} of the factory ultimately dictated the album's overall aesthetic, with the band using different metals, woods and artifacts as percussive instruments. Prystowsky also notes that the album's emphasis on quieter songs is {{as a result of}} the recording space: [...] "It just sounded muddy when you tried to play rowdy songs. It’s not an acoustically treated room, and if <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> drums and electric guitar, then everything is muddy and you can’t hear the divisions, the timbres of the instruments. It had that kind of effect with some of those kinds of songs when we tried to play them in the factory building." [...] Prior to the album's release, Miller remarked that [...] "a lot of songs died in that space that would have flourished elsewhere, for musical reasons more so than lyrical reasons." ...|$|E

About his professional success, {{he said in an interview}} with DNA, [...] "It’s a job that doesn’t give you an opportunity to show your intelligence, but you have to be really smart to stick around." [...] He also commented, [...] "It's show-business, you get to travel a lot, <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> hype & fame and other exciting things in life happen; but the nature of the job is very erratic." [...] In an interview with Zoom, he stressed, [...] "I'm very proud of the work I've done in modeling, but I'm very particular about the quality of work that I do." ...|$|E
5000|$|Anand Raj {{continued}} [...] "When you are <b>a</b> hero, <b>you</b> <b>get</b> to do {{only two}} or three films a year.

He said he lost his income as his films as hero didn't work, so he decided to play once again the villain as well as character actor roles.|$|R
30|$|The {{difference}} between a table with real money and a table with fake money, the people with fake money, they don’t do the moves they usually do with their real money. You just mess around, you don’t really care “Oh I’m all in” – it’s like you don’t care.

500|$|After {{appearing}} on the show in series 6, Richard Herring wrote on his blog: [...] "What a delightful and fascinating programme this is (and one that I think might benefit from an extended podcast release - two hours of material is recorded for the 27 minute show and it's pretty much all gold!). At times I was so enjoying listening to the others talking that I almost forgot that I {{was meant to be}} taking part. It was a wide-ranging discussion taking in ants on stilts, pianists with crippling, mechanical little fingers, the changing meridian and okapi sex (can you guess what I contributed?). The show has a dedicated team of nerds behind it who have dug out amazing facts and I love the way it has a panel comprising comedians, scientists and experts and attempts to link each contribution to similar areas of the different disciplines. While most TV panel shows (including to some extent even QI) gravitate to putting in the same well-known comedy faces, <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> more interesting stuff by mixing it up a bit. The zoologist, Dr Christofer Clemente, came up with the funniest lines of the show. But would they book him on Mock The Week? It's intelligent and stimulating programming that is increasingly being edged out of TV and even radio, leaving a gaping open goal for independent internet productions to score in. I discussed this with one of the razor-minded team after the show. The TV companies insist on getting big names into all shows, which takes up all the budget and seems to ignore the fact that the pool of possible contributors gets smaller and more boring. But glad that a few shows designed to expand the mind rather than crush the spirit still exist." ...|$|R
