5|$|Traditional historiography {{emphasizes}} Li Yuan's initial {{reluctance to}} {{revolt against the}} Sui, {{and that he had}} to be persuaded by his senior aides and his second son (and eventual successor), Li Shimin. In reality, Li Yuan was considering a rebellion at least by the time of his appointment to Taiyuan in early 617. In mid-617, Li began raising additional troops from his province and executed his two deputies—who were appointed by Yang to watch over him. He also concluded an alliance with Shibi, the powerful khagan of the Eastern Turks, which secured his northern frontier from a Turkish invasion and provided him with men and, most importantly, horses, which he lacked. Initially, however, Li Yuan portrayed himself a Sui loyalist, and proclaimed his intention of placing Yang's grandson, Yang <b>You,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> throne.|$|E
