40|$|The {{optimization}} of {{the manufacture}} of cotton yarns involves several processes, while the prediction of yarn quality parameters forms an important area of investigation. This research work concentrated on the prediction of cotton <b>yarn</b> <b>elongation.</b> Cotton lint and yarn samples were collected in textile factories in Kenya. The collected samples were tested under standard testing conditions. Cotton lint parameters, machine parameters and <b>yarn</b> <b>elongation</b> were used to design <b>yarn</b> <b>elongation</b> prediction models. The elongation prediction models used three network training algorithms, including backpropagation (BP), an extreme learning machine (ELM), and a hybrid of differential evolution (DE) and an ELM referred to as DE-ELM. The prediction models recorded a mean squared error (mse) value of 0. 001 using 11, 43 and 2 neurons in the hidden layer for the BP, ELM and DE-ELM models respectively. The ELM models exhibited faster training speeds than the BP algorithms, but required more neurons in the hidden layer than other models. The DEELM hybrid algorithm was faster than the BP algorithm, but slower than the ELM algorithm. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Wool used in {{this study}} was {{collected}} from Falahi sheep after shearing and from Falahi hides after unhairing process by both chemical and enzymatic treatments. The underlying study investigates the possibility of increasing the percent of pulled wool via blending with wool. Unhairing process using enzyme treatment not only considered as environmentally friendly but also gives better pulled wool compared with chemical one. As much as we increase pulled wool in the blend, the profit tended to increase while yarn strength and yarn regularity tended to decrease. Pulled wool percentage is reasonable at 25 %, risky at 50 % and not favorable at 75 %. Yarns from pulled wool is preferable to use in hand made fabric, which needs 100 % wool and low yarn quality compared with mechanical textile. Chemical unhairing treatment significantly decrease the wool content of amino acids, sulfur content as sulfur ion and as sulfur amino acid (Methionine), as well as some physical properties like staple and yarn strength, <b>yarn</b> <b>elongation</b> and yarn regularity expressed by increasing number of fine and thick places as well as number of nodes.

40|$|The handle {{properties}} of single jersey fabrics composed of superfine wools (17  μm) of different fibre curvature (114 vs. 74  °/mm) in blends with cashmere (fibre curvature 49  °/mm) were investigated. There were four blend ratios of cashmere (0, 25, 50, 75 %) plus 100 % cashmere. Each {{of the nine}} fibre blend combinations were replicated three times, and each was knitted into three tightness factors. The 81 fabrics were evaluated using the Wool HandleMeter, which measures seven primary handle attributes and Overall handle, and have been calibrated using {{a panel of experts}} and a wide variety of commercial fabrics. Results were analysed by ANOVA and general linear modelling. Tightness factor significantly affected all Wool HandleMeter attribute values, with the effect of tightness factor varying according to handle attribute. The Wool HandleMeter was able to detect differences between fabrics composed of superfine wool differing in fibre curvature, with lower fibre curvature wool fabrics having more preferred Overall handle and softer, looser, cooler, lighter and less dry handle attributes at some or all tightness factors compared with fabrics composed of higher fibre curvature superfine wool. Progressively blending cashmere with wool significantly improved Overall handle, increased soft and smooth handle, reduced dry, heavy and tight handle. Linear regression modelling indicated that fabric mass per unit area explained more than 50 % of the variance in overall fabric handle and in combination with variations in fabric thickness and <b>yarn</b> <b>elongation</b> could explain 71 % of the variance in Overall handle...|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of spindle air pressure and its direction on {{the properties of}} Polyester/Cotton vortex yarn was studied. The spindle air pressure direction was changed in both Z and S directions on the Z twist yarn of Ne 40 s Polyester/Cotton vortex yarn (50 : 50 polyester: cotton) and these yarns were then tested for their properties such as tensile, unevenness, and hairiness. It was found that unevenness was lower with normal spinning condition and increased when the spindle air pressure increased in both directions. Imperfections were also found to be minimum with normal spinning condition and increased with increase in spindle air pressure. The <b>yarn</b> tenacity and <b>elongation</b> at break found to be lower at normal spinning condition. When the spindle air pressure increased <b>yarn</b> tenacity and <b>elongation</b> at break also increased with increase in spindle air pressure.

Because of many variables, there is a difficulty in developing a universal empirical/theoretical model. This work presents a multilayer perceptron algorithm (MLP) model for the purpose of building a mill specific worsted spinning performance prediction tool. Sixteen inputs are used to predict key yarn properties and spinning performance, including number of fibers in cross-section, unevenness (U%), thin places, neps, <b>yarn</b> tenacity, <b>elongation</b> at break, thick places, and spinning ends-down. Validation of the model on mill specific commercial data set shows that the general fit to the target values is good. Importantly, the performance of the MLP shows a certain degree of stability to different, random selections of independent test data. Subsequent comparison against the predicted outputs of Sirolan Yarnspec confirms the overall performance of the artificial neural network (ANN) method to be more accuratefor mill specific predictions...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to explore whether the {{properties}} of worsted yarns, especially hairiness, can be improved by combining the Solospun and Sirospun processes into a single Solo-Siro spun process. Wool fibres of 19 and 21 μm in average diameter were spun into 40 tex yarns at different twist levels, using the conventional ring, Sirospun and Solo-Siro spun systems, respectively. These yarns were then tested for a range of properties, including hairiness, tenacity, elongation and evenness, for comparison purposes. The statistical analysis results indicate that the hairiness (S 3 value) of Solo-Siro spun yarns was significantly less than that of both Sirospun and normal ring spun yarns. In addition, the tenacity of the Solo-Siro spun yarns was higher than that of the normal ring spun yarns, while changes in <b>yarn</b> breaking <b>elongation</b> were not statistically significant. For the 21 μm wool, {{it was found that the}} evenness of Solo-Siro spun yarns deteriorated slightly in comparison with that of Sirospun and conventional ring spun yarns. <br /...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} quarantine-level gamma {{irradiation}} on cotton fiber and its subsequent textile processing performance Marinus HJ van der Sluijs and Jeffrey S Church Quarantine treatments of raw cotton fiber with gamma irradiation {{are known to}} have an adverse effect on fiber properties and thus could have an effect on processing into textile products. In this study, the effects of such irradiation treatments on two different cottons, cultivars of Upland and Extra Long Staple, were studied. Even at low dosages, gamma irradiation affects the physical properties of the fiber, with these effects becoming more apparent and significant as the dosage increased. While the affect on moisture regain was marginal, dye affinity was adversely affected. From a textile processing performance and quality point of view, the irradiation dosages did not {{have a significant impact on}} the yarn evenness and imperfection values, but did have a significant effect on <b>yarn</b> strength and <b>elongation,</b> as well as fabric strength and abrasion resistance.

40|$|Fiber {{elongation}} (ability {{to stretch}} before breaking) {{is one of}} the key components in determining overall <b>yarn</b> quality. <b>Elongation</b> in U. S. upland cotton (G. hirsutum L.) has remained largely neglected due to: absence of monetary incentives for growers to produce high elongation cotton; lack of research interests among breeders; and absence of a reliable fiber testing system for elongation. This study was conducted to determine the genetics of cotton fiber elongation via a diallel and generation means analysis (GMA). Findings from this study should lay the foundation for future breeding work in cotton fiber elongation. Of the seven distinctive upland parents used for the diallel study, general combining ability was far more prominent than specific combing ability for fiber elongation. Cultivar PSC 355 and Dever experimental line were the two parents identified as good combiners for fiber elongation in this study. The slight negative correlation between fiber elongation and strength remained true. Highly significant negative correlation was observed between fiber upper half mean length and elongation. Both Stelometer and HVI elongation measurements correlated well with values of 0. 85 and 0. 82 in 2010 and 2011, respectively. For the six families used in the GMA analysis, additive genetic control was prevalent over dominance effect. Based on the scaling test, no significant epistatic interaction was detected for fiber elongation. As expected, additive variance constituted a much larger portion of total genetic variation in fiber elongation than the dominance variance. On average, larger numbers of effective factor were identified in fiber elongation than all other fiber traits tested, suggesting that parents used in the GMA study are carrying different genetic materials/ loci for fiber elongation. Considerable gains in fiber elongation may be achieved by selectively crossing these materials in a pure-line breeding scheme while holding other important fiber traits constant...|$|R

Very often these spacer fabrics are molded into a desirable shape in order to fit with consumers' body contour. Thermal-mechanical properties of the spacer fabric are greatly affecting the molding properties and shape conformity of the molded spacer product. In this study, five different spacer fabrics were molded to a desirable bra cup shape with 6 cm cup depth (equivalent to a size 38 B's bra). The optimal molding conditions including molding temperature and molding time for each spacer fabric were found. It was shown that not all spacer fabrics can be molded to a desired cup shape.

40|$|Abstract: Spindle {{speed is}} an {{important}} parameter {{for the production of}} jute yarn [1]. An Apron Draft spinning frame was modified in to ring system by incorporating rings and travelers instead of flyers. The experiments were performed for investigating the effect of spindle speed on textile properties and productivity of jute yarn of 103 tex. The spindle speed was varied from 5000 rpm to 9000 rpm. The experiments were performed with Bangla White B (BWB) grade jute sliver of finisher drawing of linear density 2415 tex (70 lb/spy). The draft ratio and the twist used in the experiments were 23 and 240 tpm (turns per meter) respectively. The ring size was KW (4) 76 mm Ø. Steel travelers number 1, Type G, semicircular in shape were used in the experiment. Ten runs were performed for the experiment at the standard atmospheric condition, 20 + 2 ˚C, and relative humidity 65 % + 2 %. The nominal count of the yarn produced was 103 tex. The yarns produced through the experiments were tested for different textile properties. Analysis of the test results shows that the spindle speed greatly influences the textile properties, such as strength, <b>elongation,</b> <b>yarn</b> breakage, productivity, quality ratio etc. of produced yarn.

40|$|Impact of the ginning method on fiber {{quality and}} textile {{processing}} performance of Long Staple Upland cotton Marinus HJ van der Sluijs 1, 2 With the {{increased demand for}} quality {{and the production of}} finer, longer and stronger Upland cottons, an increasing proportion of these cottons are ginned on roller gins to preserve and improve fiber quality. However, although the benefits of roller ginning on lint turn out and fiber quality are fairly well understood, it is still unclear whether these improvements translate into improved yarn quality and processing performance. The aim of this research was to com-pare the impact of saw and roller ginning on Long Staple Upland cotton in a high-production and commercial environ-ment and to evaluate quality and textile processing performance in a commercial textile mill. One field located within the central cotton growing area of Australia was planted with a Long Staple Upland variety, with a number of round modules selected at random from the field and processed by a saw and a rotary knife roller gin. There was {{a significant difference between the}} two ginning methods in some of the average fiber results, with the roller ginned fiber longer and more uniform with fewer short fibers and fibrous neps, as well as stronger with higher elongation. These improved fiber properties resulted in significant differences in the fine count combed hosiery ring spun yarn produced.
