(pause) Today I consider myself the luckiest man {{on the face of the}} earth. (cut) When <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>around,</b> wouldn't you consider it a privilege to associate yourself with such fine-looking men as are standing in uniform in this ballpark today? (cut) ... that I might have been given a bad break, but I've got an awful lot to live for. [...] Thank you." ...|$|E

He Kennedy had a glamorous family, and conveyed the impression that you could actually do something in politics {{to improve the lives of}} citizens.

60|$|Tuesday, July 23.--We dined under a bare trellis erected for the Fourth of July; {{and here}} we used to linger by lamplight over coffee and tobacco. In that climate evening {{approaches}} without sensible chill; the wind dies out before sunset; heaven glows a while and fades, and darkens into the blueness of the tropical night; swiftly and insensibly the shadows thicken, the stars multiply their number; <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>around</b> you and the day is gone. It was then that we would see our Chinaman draw near across the compound in a lurching sphere of light, divided by his shadows; and {{with the coming of}} the lamp the night closed about the table. The faces of the company, the spars of the trellis, stood out suddenly bright on a ground of blue and silver, faintly designed with palm-tops and the peaked roofs of houses. Here and there the gloss upon a leaf, or the fracture of a stone, returned an isolated sparkle. All else had vanished. We hung there, illuminated like a galaxy of stars in vacuo; we sat, manifest and blind, amid the general ambush of the darkness; and the islanders, passing with light footfalls and low voices in the sand of the road, lingered to observe us, unseen.|$|E
60|$|Now the {{deductions}} which I {{am going}} to append to these figures may sound extravagant, but they are not. I take them from Miscellaneous Documents No. 50, second session 45th Congress, and they are official and trustworthy. To-day, the work of those 2,000,000 cotton-ginners is done by 2,000 men; that of the 6,000,000 stocking-knitters is done by 3,000 boys; that of the 2,000,000 thread-spinners is done by 1,000 girls; that of the 500,000 screw makers is done by 500 girls; that of the 400,000 reapers, binders, etc., is done by 4,000 boys; that of the 1,000,000 corn shelters is done by 7,500 men; that of the 40,000 weavers is done by 1,200 men; {{and that of the}} 1,000 stitchers of shoe soles is done by 6 men. To bunch the figures, 17,900 persons to-day do the above-work, whereas fifty years ago it would have taken thirteen millions of persons to do it. Now then, how many of that ignorant race--our fathers and grandfathers--with their ignorant methods, would it take to do our work to-day? It would take forty thousand millions--a hundred times the swarming population of China--twenty times the present population of the globe. <b>You</b> <b>look</b> <b>around</b> you and you see a nation of sixty millions-- apparently; but secreted in their hands and brains, and invisible to your eyes, is the true population of this Republic, and it numbers forty billions! It is the stupendous creation of those humble unlettered, un-college-bred inventors--all honor to their name.|$|E
6000|$|... 2. I {{have devoted}} some {{thought to the}} proper method of {{changing}} trains. The system which I have observed {{to be the most}} popular with travellers of my own class, is something as follows: Suppose that you have been told on leaving New York that you are to change at Kansas City. The evening before approaching Kansas City, stop the conductor in the aisle of the car (you can do this best by putting out your foot and tripping him), and say politely, [...] "Do I change at Kansas City?" [...] He says [...] "Yes." [...] Very good. Don't believe him. On going into the dining-car for supper, take a negro aside and put it to him as a personal matter between a white man and a black, whether he thinks you ought to change at Kansas City. Don't be satisfied with this. In the course of the evening pass through the entire train from time to time, and say to people casually, [...] "Oh, can you tell me if I change at Kansas City?" [...] Ask the conductor about it a few more times in the evening: a repetition of the question will ensure pleasant relations with him. Before falling asleep watch for his passage and ask him through the curtains of your berth, [...] "Oh, by the way, did you say I changed at Kansas City?" [...] If he refuses to stop, hook him by the neck with your walking-stick, and draw him gently to your bedside. In the morning when the train stops and a man calls, [...] "Kansas City! All change!" [...] approach the conductor again and say, [...] "Is this Kansas City?" [...] Don't be discouraged at his answer. Pick yourself up and go {{to the other end of}} the car and say to the brakesman, [...] "Do you know, sir, if this is Kansas City?" [...] Don't be too easily convinced. Remember that both brakesman and conductor may be in collusion to deceive <b>you.</b> <b>Look</b> <b>around,</b> therefore, for the name of the station on the signboard. Having found it, alight and ask the first man you see if this is Kansas City. He will answer, [...] "Why, where in blank are your blank eyes? Can't you see it there, plain as blank?" [...] When you hear language of this sort, ask no more. You are now in Kansas and this is Kansas City.|$|E
6000|$|... "But those things," [...] {{said the}} Sacian, [...] "which you name, must be unusual and {{extraordinary}} occurrences.

50|$|Coming {{out of the}} Manwal {{railway station}} you will be greeted by the calm, green environs and dash of fresh air.

The surroundings resemble humble settings of just any other hill station. So what is so different about Manwal, a small village situated at Dhar road roughly 28 km from Udhampur.|$|R

5000|$|Having worked {{largely in}} {{isolation}} since returning from Pont-Aven, Bevan’s paintings were noticed by Harold Gilman and Spencer Gore {{and he was}} invited to join Walter Sickert’s Fitzroy Street Group.

Thus began a series of paintings recording the decline of the horse cab trade, for example The Cab Horse (Tate gallery).|$|R

5000|$|In May 2014 Delgado had a solo {{exhibition}} entitled Even Less at Howard Griffin Gallery in Shoreditch London.

5000|$|Former {{coach of}} the St. Louis Rams, Mike Martz, says [...] "Don {{is the father of}} the modern passing game.

5000|$|R Chaim {{was aware}} of the {{opposition}} to his method, but defended it. In response to a rabbi who insisted on taking the words of the Gemara at face value, R Chaim replied: A term may refer to different laws in different contexts. For example, the Talmud requires [...] "panim chadashos" [...] (meaning [...] "a new presence" [...] or [...] "new faces") at the Sheva Brachos celebration, i.e. a guest must be present who had not attended the wedding. Elsewhere, the Talmud comments that once sacrificial meat has been burned to ashes, the ashes no longer have a sacrificial status, as [...] "panim chadashos ba'u l'chan" [...] - [...] "a new presence has arrived", meaning that the ashes {{are not the same as}} the meat. [...] "So if you were at a Sheva Brachos party, and <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> and everyone there had already been at this couple's wedding, why not just take some meat and burn it to ashes?", challenged Rabbi Chaim. Clearly, the phrase [...] "panim chadashos" [...] has different meanings in the contexts of wedding celebrations and sacrificial meat.|$|R

[...] Krugman points out that Sentance never once mentions that, according to Krugman, US [...] "inflation is still below the Fed’s target, and {{shows no sign of}} rising".|$|E
