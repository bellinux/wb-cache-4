500|$|In the episode, Field Marshal Haig {{is shown}} casually {{sweeping}} away toy soldiers with a dustpan and brush; BBC News Magazines Finlo Rohrer called this a [...] "visual allusion to his callousness", but quoted the historian Gary Sheffield as saying [...] "The real Field Marshal Haig {{was certainly not}} a callous man. He was commanding the largest British army ever. Whatever he did <b>you</b> <b>ended</b> up with {{lots and lots of}} casualties." [...] Sheffield also noted that [...] "Melchett is an amalgam of Haig and John French and the other generals", so Haig effectively [...] "appears twice". The series, and the storyline of [...] "Goodbyeee" [...] especially, often depicts the [...] "lions led by donkeys" [...] perception of the War, an element of Blackadder Goes Forth that has been criticised by historians.|$|E
500|$|... "Branch Closing" [...] has {{received}} generally positive reviews from television critics. IGN's Brian Zoromski rated it 10 out of 10, making it {{only one of}} two third-season episodes he deemed a [...] "masterpiece". He explained that the episode [...] "is {{a perfect example of}} why The Office is the best-written comedy currently on the air. The episode expertly combines character-driven and situational humor, while realistically presenting a major change that advances the stories of all the characters. The result is a fantastically funny, enjoyable and realistic half-hour." [...] Michael Sciannamea of AOL TV felt that because of the poor economy, the episode [...] "surely hit home with quite a number of people," [...] and added that it shows that Michael [...] "does have a soul... <b>you</b> <b>ended</b> up rooting for him to save the day." [...] Sciannamea highlighted Stanley's reaction to the branch closure as one positive element, though he criticized the Ryan-Kelly storyline as [...] "tiresome." ...|$|E
500|$|During the crisis, Gingrich's {{public image}} {{suffered}} from {{the perception that the}} Republicans' hardline budget stance was owed partly to an alleged snub of Gingrich by Clinton during a flight on Air Force One to and from Yitzhak Rabin's funeral in Israel. That perception developed after the trip when Gingrich, while being questioned by Lars-Erik Nelson at a Christian Science Monitor breakfast, said that he was dissatisfied that Clinton had not invited him to discuss the budget during the flight. He complained that he and Dole were instructed to use the plane's rear exit to deplane, saying the snub was [...] "part of why <b>you</b> <b>ended</b> up with us sending down a tougher continuing resolution". In response to Gingrich's complaint that they were [...] "forced to use the rear door," [...] NBC news released their videotape footage showing both Gingrich and Dole disembarking at Tel Aviv just behind Clinton via the front stairway.|$|E

2500|$|Poirot {{mentions}} that once in Egypt {{he attempted to}} warn a murderer before the person committed the crime. That case is the one retold in Death on the Nile. He {{mentions that}} there was another case in which he had done the same thing: almost certainly that retold in “Triangle at Rhodes” (published in Murder in the Mews in 1937). In The ABC Murders, Inspector Japp says to Poirot: [...] "Shouldn't wonder if <b>you</b> <b>ended</b> by detecting your own death;" [...] an indication that the idea of Curtain had already formed in the author's mind in 1935. On 6 August 1975, The New York Times published a front-page obituary of Poirot with a photograph to mark his death.|$|E
2500|$|Richie {{said that}} as Redwater is a {{stand-alone}} series, there is no reference to the EastEnders locations of Walford, Albert Square or The Queen Victoria pub, though Alfie does mention that he once worked in a pub, being the only reference to their time in EastEnders. Kat and Alfie's twin sons, Bert and Ernie Moon, do not appear in Redwater, because Treadwell-Collins knew that having two small children in the series would have [...] "limited Kat and Alfie and they wouldn't {{have been able to}} do as much", though revealed that they were originally due to appear, but [...] "suddenly <b>you</b> <b>ended</b> up having storylines about who is looking after the twins and on a show like this we needed to tell other stories" [...] and confirmed that Kat and Alfie have only left them for a few weeks and check on them during the series.|$|E
2500|$|On August 26, 2011, the Red Hot Chili Peppers {{released}} their tenth album, I'm with You. [...] On December 7, 2011, the Red Hot Chili Peppers {{were named}} 2012 inductees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Kiedis {{said it was}} very emotional and the first person he told was his father, who cried when hearing the news. On January 11, 2012, the Chili Peppers announced that {{they were forced to}} postpone the U.S. leg of their I'm with You tour due to multiple foot injuries suffered by Kiedis. Kiedis has been battling through foot injuries since 2006 when he injured his foot onstage and finally was able to have surgery during a break in the band's tour in January 2012. During the surgery, Kiedis had a crushed sesamoid bone removed and a detached flexor tendon repaired. The band was able to resume their tour and kicked off the U.S. leg on March 29, 2012. The tour in support of I'm with <b>You</b> <b>ended</b> in April 2013 and the band continued touring into mid-2014 which included a halftime performance with Bruno Mars at the Super Bowl in January 2014.|$|E

Suppose you was falling over a cliff, wouldn't it be all right for me to reach out and hold you by the arm? Sure it would. But suppose <b>you</b> <b>ended</b> another sort of help--instead of the {{strength}} of arm, the strength of my pocket? That would be all and that's what they all say. But why do they say it. Because the robber gangs want all the suckers to be honest and respect money. If the suckers weren't honest and didn't respect money, where would the robbers be? Don't you see? The robbers don't deal in arm-holds; they deal in dollars. Therefore arm-holds are just common and ordinary, while dollars are sacred--so sacred that you didn't let me lend you a hand with a few.|$|E
6000|$|MADAM,--The last {{paragraph}} in yours of the 30th February {{affected me}} most; so I shall begin my answer where <b>you</b> <b>ended</b> your letter. That I am often a sinner with any little wit I have, I do confess; but I have taxed my recollection to no purpose {{to find out}} when it was employed against you. I hate an ungenerous sarcasm a great deal worse than I do the devil--at least as Milton describes him; and though I may be rascally enough to be sometimes guilty of it myself, I cannot endure it in others. You, my honoured friend, who cannot appear in any light but you are sure of being respectable--you can afford to pass by an occasion to display your wit, because you may depend for fame on your sense; or, if you choose to be silent, you know you can rely on the gratitude of many, and the esteem of all; but, God help us, who are wits or witlings by profession, if we stand not for fame there, we sink unsupported! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "... The most trustful {{eyes in the}} world--your {{brother said}} of you when he was {{as well as a}} dead man already. And when you stood before me with your hand extended, I remembered the very sound of his voice, and I looked into your eyes--and that was enough. I knew that {{something}} had happened, but I did not know then what.... But don't be deceived, Natalia Victorovna. I believed that I had in my breast nothing but an inexhaustible fund of anger and hate for you both. I remembered that he had looked to you for the perpetuation of his visionary soul. He, this man who had robbed me of my hard-working, purposeful existence. I, too, had my guiding idea; and remember that, amongst us, it is more difficult to lead a life of toil and self-denial than {{to go out in the}} street and kill from conviction. But enough of that. Hate or no hate, I felt at once that, while shunning the sight of you, I could never succeed in driving away your image. I would say, addressing that dead man, 'Is this the way you are going to haunt me?' It is only later on that I understood--only to-day, only a few hours ago. What could I have known of what was tearing me to pieces and dragging the secret for ever to my lips? You were appointed to undo the evil by making me betray myself back into truth and peace. You! And you have done it in the same way, too, in which he ruined me: by forcing upon me your confidence. Only what I detested him for, in <b>you</b> <b>ended</b> by appearing noble and exalted. But, I repeat, be not deceived. I was given up to evil. I exulted in having induced that silly innocent fool to steal his father's money. He was a fool, but not a thief. I made him one. It was necessary. I had to confirm myself in my contempt and hate for what I betrayed. I have suffered from as many vipers in my heart as any social democrat of them all--vanity, ambitions, jealousies, shameful desires, evil passions of envy and revenge. I had my security stolen from me, years of good work, my best hopes. Listen--now comes the true confession. The other was nothing. To save me, your trustful eyes had to entice my thought to the very edge of the blackest treachery. I could see them constantly looking at me with the confidence of your pure heart which had not been touched by evil things. Victor Haldin had stolen the truth of my life from me, who had nothing else in the world, and he boasted of living on through you on this earth where I had no place to lay my head on. She will marry some day, he had said--and your eyes were trustful. And do you know what I said to myself? I shall steal his sister's soul from her. When we met that first morning in the gardens, and you spoke to me confidingly in the generosity of your spirit, I was thinking, 'Yes, he himself by talking of her trustful eyes has delivered her into my hands!' If you could have looked then into my heart, you would have cried out aloud with terror and disgust.|$|E
