5|$|I have {{a rather}} more {{favourable}} {{opinion of the}} 'Vestiges' than <b>you</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> have. I do not consider it a hasty generalization, but rather as an ingenious hypothesis strongly supported by some striking facts and analogies, but which remains to be proven by more facts and the additional light which more research may throw upon the problem. It furnishes a subject for every student of nature to attend to; every fact he observes will make either for or against it, and it thus serves both as an incitement to the collection of facts, and an object to which they can be applied when collected.|$|E

60|$|CANYNGE. <b>You</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> {{have your}} breed on the brain, sir. Nobody else does, {{so far as}} I know.|$|E
6000|$|... "Prince," [...] {{replied the}} Fairy, smiling, [...] "I am sorry that so small a matter should disturb you, {{and make you}} so uneasy as <b>you</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sick men!" [...] he echoed. [...] "Awhile ago, monsieur, <b>you</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> cast a doubt upon my sanity. Is it {{a case of}} the {{drunkard}} {{who thinks}} all the world drunk but himself?" ...|$|R
6000|$|You were {{a dreadful}} criminal--by Heaven, [...] I think {{there never was}} a man so sinful! We've all a pinch or two of Satan's leaven, [...] But <b>you</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> have an even skinful.|$|R
6000|$|Warrington laughed--"Stunning Warrington--yes," [...] he said, [...] "I {{recollect}} {{you in your}} freshman's term. But <b>you</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> {{have quite}} cut me out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thanks," [...] replied Heika. [...] "As, however, <b>you</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> doubt our {{powers of}} self-restraint, we will relieve your mind by going without them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All {{who live}} near <b>you</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> think you the common centre of their affections," [...] Paul resumed; when his {{swelling}} heart permitted him to speak.|$|E
6000|$|They {{had stopped}} {{in a garden}} path; Acton looked hard at his rosy young kinsman. [...] "She {{said she could n't}} fancy what had got into you; <b>you</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> have taken a violent dislike to her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{spoke of}} Horace just now," [...] she said, [...] "in terms which {{surprised}} me. <b>You</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> {{think that he}} would not hold me to my explanation. Is that one of the conclusions which you draw from Lady Janet's letter?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You knew Hamilton Fynes," [...] Mr. Gaynsforth remarked. [...] "That fact {{came out}} at the inquest. <b>You</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> have known him better than most men. Mr. Vanderpole had just left you when he was murdered,--that also came {{out at the}} inquest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Can I trust you, Tuscarora? Sometimes {{you seem}} a friend, {{sometimes}} an enemy. I know that <b>you</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> be {{on good terms}} with my captors." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In which <b>you</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> {{have succeeded}} admirably. Your spars and sails are a size or two too small; but every thing stands like a church." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No! No! You are not ordinary. I {{have some}} {{experience}} of Russians who are--well--living abroad. <b>You</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> me, {{and to others}} too, a marked personality." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] said M. le Marquis, {{and drew}} a gold snuffbox from his pocket. [...] "You say, 'if the deed was infamous,' monsieur. Am I to {{understand}} that {{you are no longer}} as convinced as <b>you</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> be of its infamy?" ...|$|R
5000|$|It {{is better}} to be smarter than <b>you</b> <b>appear</b> than <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> smarter than <b>you</b> are.|$|R
6000|$|... "Exactly! I {{observed}} that <b>you</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> be startled by what my sister-in-law had said; {{and when you}} declared that appearances must certainly have misled her, you looked and spoke (to my mind) like a man animated by a strong feeling of indignation. Was I wrong in drawing that conclusion?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Here, then, lies our way," [...] {{said the}} young man, {{in a low}} voice. [...] "Manifest no distrust, or you may invite the danger <b>you</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> apprehend." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not what <b>you</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> think, sir," [...] Captain Bannister replied stiffly. [...] "We require from Mr. Bundercombe {{a written}} {{confession}} and his resignation from the Sidney Club." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{has been}} going on? I counted on helping a party of boys, rather than giving my tent up {{to a lot of}} roughs, as <b>you</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> be." ...|$|E
50|$|Lycan (-1): You are a villager, but <b>you</b> <b>appear</b> falsely <b>to</b> be a {{werewolf}} to the Seers and PI.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, but, my {{dear old}} artist," [...] said Archie, [...] "what you don't seem <b>to</b> grasp--what <b>you</b> <b>appear</b> not <b>to</b> realise--is that I'm getting a crick in the back." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Things not a {{bit more}} horrible, I think," [...] Miss Overmore returned, [...] "than those <b>you,</b> madam, <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> have come here {{to say about the}} father!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It might be," [...] she replied, [...] "if I had, as <b>you</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to,</b> the {{imagination}} of atrocity. But I don't pretend to so much as conceive what's your business." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, cer'nly, cer'nly," [...] {{replied the}} boatsman; [...] "if you'll lend us {{a hand to}} sink the shaft. <b>You</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> {{have been in the}} water, and 'twill warm 'ee." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{would not}} have us retire, sir, before these boasted horsemen, without doing {{something}} that may deprive them of part of the glory which <b>you</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> think they have gained!" ...|$|E
60|$|The Judge: But <b>you</b> <b>appear,</b> Mr. Humphrey, <b>to</b> {{have left}} matters {{in a very}} {{unsatisfactory}} state.|$|R
6000|$|... "By all {{the gods}} of the Romans, Greeks, Christians, Jews, and barbarian nations, you are a noble-hearted woman," [...] he said, [...] "and that kiss is my tribute to you. Little wonder that puppy, Marcus, is called The Fortunate, since, even when he {{deserved}} to die who suffered himself to be taken alive, <b>you</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> save him--to save him, by Venus, {{at the cost of}} your own sweet self. Well, most noble traitress, what now?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "From {{the little}} that I have seen of <b>you</b> it <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> me, Dr. Hardacre," [...] said he, [...] "that {{you are the}} very man I have wanted to meet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tic--tic--tic!" [...] {{said the}} man, [...] "how low and gentle your voice seems to-night. Everything is so still and quiet, that <b>you</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> be only {{whispering}} {{the flight of}} time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I had thought," [...] {{said her}} ladyship at last, [...] "that you promised {{to tell us}} {{something}} {{that it was in}} our interest to hear. Instead, <b>you</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> be asking questions." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. John, <b>you</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> {{forget that}} the public has more claims {{to be treated with}} attention, than a single individual. If it has fallen into error, it ought to be undeceived." ...|$|E
6000|$|Down inside Blacky chuckled. It was a {{noiseless}} chuckle, for Blacky did {{not intend}} to give himself away until he had to. But when at last he saw that Reddy was beginning to get uneasy, Blacky spoke. [...] "You seem to be feeling better, Brother Reddy," [...] said he. [...] "You must excuse me for keeping you waiting, but I did not suppose that any one so weak and feeble as <b>you</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> be early this morning could possibly get here so soon." ...|$|R
6000|$|Densher seemed for {{a little}} to look at Lord Mark's {{conviction}} {{as if it were}} a blot on the face of nature. [...] "Do you mean because <b>you</b> had <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> him to have encouraged him?" ...|$|R
2500|$|My {{greatest}} {{pride and}} pleasure was seeing {{you as the}} head of the greatest orchestra in Germany. You may remember that I missed almost no performance which you conducted, saw only you and was happy. I believed that what I was hearing emanated from you only...the Ninth Symphony will be forever unforgettable to me on account of <b>you.</b> <b>You</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> me like a God governing all the powerful elements and working enchantments on men. See, dear Richard, you own the power, the glorious gift of creating something great even as a conductor...|$|R
