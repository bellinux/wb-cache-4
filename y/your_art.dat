500|$|While this {{mixing of}} campaigns was done without the {{knowledge}} of the members of Fall Out Boy, Wentz did post an acknowledgement on August 22, when CFOB again [...] "hijacked" [...] Decaydance Records website. Decaydance act The Cab began performing with [...] "Citizens for Our Betterment" [...] written on the group's instruments. Finally, on August 26, a blog post of a press release was made on the band's FriendsOrEnemies.com page; it announced Folie à Deux as the title of the upcoming album, due for release on November 4. Wentz said of the endeavor [...] "To me, this is not a marketing campaign. It is a way to cause excitement about <b>your</b> <b>art</b> and have people earn it and understand it...I don't believe the full campaign has begun, and I also believe people are taking over the ship in a truly viral way. It doesn't hurt anyone, and hopefully it {{tells the story of the}} project better and makes it more appreciated." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Untitled (How Does It Feel)" [...] portrayed D'Angelo {{as a sex}} symbol to {{mainstream}} music audiences, which had repercussions on The Voodoo Tours second half. During the tour, female fans yelled out {{for him to take}} his clothes off, while others tossed clothes onto the stage. As trumpeter Roy Hargrove recounted, [...] "We couldn't get through one song before women would start to scream for him to take off something [...] It wasn't about the music. All they wanted him to do was take off his clothes." [...] This led to frustration and both onstage and offstage outbursts by D'Angelo, with him breaking stage equipment. Questlove later said, [...] "He'd get angry and start breaking shit. The audience thinking, 'Fuck <b>your</b> <b>art,</b> I wanna see your ass!', made him angry." [...] Although some were cancelled due to D'Angelo's throat infection during the tour's mid-March dates, many shows were cancelled due to his personal and emotional problems. D'Angelo chose on several occasions to not perform on scheduled dates, and delayed others to do physical workouts like stomach crunches. According to Questlove, three weeks worth of concert dates were cancelled, including two weeks worth of shows in Japan. He elaborated on the experience in a 2003 interview for The Believer, saying that: ...|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} {{performed}} {{for the first}} time at the Bambi Awards in Germany, on November 27, 2008. For the performance Spears wore hot pants, fishnet stockings and a black top hat. The ensemble was compared to the costume Madonna wore during the first act of her Sticky & Sweet Tour (2008–09). Spears was also presented with an award for Best International Popstar by Karl Lagerfeld, who said, [...] "I admire you... not just for <b>your</b> <b>art,</b> but for your energy. [...] coming back not only as a phoenix but as a bird of paradise". The following night, Spears performed the song at Star Academy, with similar choreography and dance moves but wearing a red strapless dress. On November 30, 2008, Spears performed at The X Factor. The performance was watched by over thirteen million UK citizens, making it the most viewed episode in the show’s history. On December 2, 2008, she performed the song at Good Morning America along with a performance of [...] "Circus". On December 15, 2008, she performed at the Japanese music show Hey! Hey! Hey! Music Champ. The following day, she performed at NTV Best Artist 2008 in a black and gold bra, hot pants and a white top hat. She also sported a fake tattooed heart in her cheek.|$|E
500|$|While {{writing the}} scene with Meredith and Shepherd fighting, Rater {{explained}} that she was intending to show how they matured, adding: [...] "This is a real grown-up argument. Meredith isn't running away, getting all dark and going to Cristina for help getting out of her marriage. She's staying and fighting." [...] While writing the episode, writers intended {{the theme of the}} episode to be [...] "exposure", but after the episode was filmed, realized it was [...] "ambition". Rater commented on this: [...] "Derek wants to be Chief; Meredith wants to do a procedure that she knows she isn’t ready for; Cristina wants Teddy to stay." [...] In the episode, Oh's character asked her fellow residents if they would choose love or surgery, if need be, with Stevens choosing love and Yang and Meredith choosing surgery. The Grey Anatomy staff offered the insight: [...] "When we were first discussing this story we had a knock down drag out fight in the writers' room – if you had to choose your love or <b>your</b> <b>art,</b> which would you choose? And some of us came down on the Cristina side, and some of us came down on the Izzie side – that in the end love is all that matters." [...] At the conclusion of the episode, Karev ended his marriage to Stevens. Rater expressed that the writers decided to have the fictional couple break-up, because Stevens wasn't sick anymore, and Karev would not have left her when she was.|$|E
