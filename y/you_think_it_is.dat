500|$|The {{idea behind}} Mad Dogs {{came from the}} {{friendship}} between the four main actors, who wanted to work together for a television project, as well as Cris Cole and executive producer Suzanne Mackie. The four initially {{wanted to make a}} story about a rock band, but decided that making programmes about bands have been [...] "done to death". To write the series, Cole was influenced by the works of David Lynch and the Coen brothers as inspiration to the kind of storytelling that is [...] "never quite what <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> going to be".|$|E
500|$|The {{match was}} the most {{discussed}} sports game ever on Twitter with over 35.6 million tweets, surpassing Super Bowl XLVIII, with 24.9million tweets during the game. At first incentive hashtags such as [...] "#PrayForBrazil" [...] were common, but once Germany built a 50 lead Brazilian users instead lent their frustration into self-deprecatory humor, comparing Germany's goals with the Volkswagen Gol car and stating the Brazilian team looked like [...] "11 Freds". Other Twitter users compared Germany's dominating performance to their military efforts during World War II and The Holocaust, for example, dubbing it the [...] "Goalocaust". Bung Moktar Radin, a member of parliament of Malaysia, came under heavy criticism from the Malaysian public and the German ambassador, Holger Michael, for posting such a comment. The President of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff, stated on Twitter following the match that [...] "like all Brazilians, I am deeply saddened by our loss". The Israeli Minister of Foreign Affairs, Yigal Palmor, mentioned the match when countering Brazil's claim that his country was using disproportionate force in the Gaza conflict, saying [...] "This is not football. In football, when a game ends in a draw, <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> proportional, but when it finishes 7–1 it's disproportionate".|$|E
500|$|On March 17, 2012, Scott {{said that}} the film leaves many {{questions}} unanswered and that these could be answered in a sequel. He said, [...] "If we're lucky, there'll be a second part. It does leave you with some nice open questions." [...] Asked whether a sequel would be a direct prequel to Alien, Lindelof said: [...] "If we're fortunate enough to do a sequel... it will tangentialize even further away from the original Alien." [...] In June 2012, Lindelof said that while plot elements were deliberately left unresolved {{so that they could}} be answered in a sequel, he and Scott had thoroughly discussed what should be resolved so that Prometheus could stand alone, as a sequel was not guaranteed. Scott said that a sequel would follow Shaw to her next destination, [...] "because if it is paradise, paradise cannot be what <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> Paradise has a connotation of being extremely sinister and ominous." [...] Lindelof cast doubt on his participation, and said, [...] "if [...] wants me to be involved in something, that would be hard to say no to. At the same time, I do feel like [...] might benefit from a fresh voice or a fresh take or a fresh thought." [...] Scott said that an additional film would be required {{to bridge the gap between}} the Prometheus sequel and Alien. Scott later stated it would take an additional two sequels to bridge the gap to Alien.|$|E

2500|$|In a November 2013 {{interview}} for ITV, Niall Wass defended the firm's practices and challenged critics to [...] "go use the service, see if <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> fair and transparent, take out £30 for ten days, {{pay it back}} after a week, look at the price, tell me if that is fair and transparent." ...|$|E
2500|$|Meles {{claimed that}} there are two basic views about ethnic federalism: [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a threat, it will be; if you think it a benefit, then it will be."

2500|$|Qiao Zhou asked Du Qiong, [...] "Zhou Shu {{once said}} that the 'something tall on the road' [...] refers {{to the state of}} Wei. Why do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> so?" [...] Du Qiong replied, [...] "Wei (魏) also refers to either of the two viewing towers at each gate of the {{imperial}} palace. It faces the road and stands out as a very tall structure from a distance away. (Because Wei was also the name of an ancient state,) the sages decided {{to use it as a}} double entendre." [...] When Qiao Zhou sought clarification, Du Qiong further explained, [...] "The term cao (曹) was never used to refer to the positions held by government officials in ancient times. This practice only started in the Han dynasty: clerks are called shu cao (屬曹) and guards are called shi cao (侍曹). This is probably Heaven's will." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 24 November, Hannam, Hewett and {{the head}} of Eastbourne CID, Detective Inspector Pugh, searched Adams' house with a warrant issued (in Pugh's name) under the Dangerous Drugs Act 1951. When told they were looking for, [...] "Morphine, Heroin, Pethidine and the like", Adams was surprised: [...] "Oh, that group. You will find none here. I haven't any. I very seldom ever use them", he said. When Hannam asked for Adams' Dangerous Drugs Register – the record of those ordered and used – Adams responded: [...] "I don't know what you mean. I keep no register." [...] He had not kept one since 1949. When shown a list of {{dangerous}} drugs he had prescribed Morrell, and asked who administered them, Adams said, [...] "I did nearly all. Perhaps the nurses gave some but mostly me" [...] – contradicting what the nurses' notebooks would show during his trial. Hannam then observed, [...] "Doctor, you prescribed for her 75 – 1/6 grains heroin tablets the day before she died." [...] Adams replied, [...] "Poor soul, she was in terrible agony. It was all used. I used them myself [...] Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> too much?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Duterte's {{constant}} cursing had {{local officials}} {{worried that the}} Philippines would lose foreign aid from the United States and European Union. [...] He responded that “If <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> high time for you guys to withdraw your assistance, go ahead. [...] We will not beg for it. We have a problem here trying to preserve our society" [...] he said. [...] The President continued that he would “be {{the first to go}} hungry. I will {{be the first one to}} die of hunger". [...] Local actress Agot Isidro responded in Tagalog [...] "First of all, no one's trying to fight you. As a matter of fact, you're the one who's picking a fight. Secondly, the country where you are elected as President by 16 million out of 100+ million is Third World. You talk as if the Philippines is a superpower. Excuse me, we don't want to go hungry. If you want, you do it yourself. Leave us out of it. So many people have nothing to eat, and yet you'll starve us even further". Her sentiments were echoed by Senator Panfilo Lacson adding that [...] "if the economy worsen, the entire Filipino people will be affected, they will go hungry as well".|$|E
