25|$|In {{the first}} year of the IBMXF World Championship in 1982 after having <b>your</b> <b>standard</b> racers to decide the World Champions in the various Classes, both Amateur and Professional, an overall World Champion was decided by racing all of the class winners {{including}} the Pro Champion and Amateur champion in a single race called the Trophy Dash. In 1982, Greg Hill, the professional World Champion refused to race the Amateur World Champion the American Nelson Chanady, claiming that there was no point to it. Nelson Chanady raced and won the Trophy Dash without Hill's participation, capturing the Overall title. However, since Mr. Hill did not race, the World Championship title lost a considerable amount of luster, since American professional racers were regarded collectively as the best in the world with Mr. Hill being among the best of them. Because of this lost of stature due to Mr. Hill not racing that final race in 1982, the Trophy Dash to determine the World Champion was abolished and in 1983 when the American professional Clint Miller won the World Professional Championship he was also considered the overall World Champion.|$|E

500|$|The show's {{popularity}} {{resulted in}} enquiries for coats similar to Sherlock's, reported retailer Debenhams. Garment manufacturer Belstaff put the wool trench coat worn by Benedict Cumberbatch back into production before the series had ended. The Independent reported, [...] "designer Paul Costelloe moved {{to meet the}} demand, offering tailored coats and scarves based on the series, while Savile Row bespoke tailor John Pearse said many of his clients were inquiring about the actors' clothes." [...] Journalist Alexis Petridis commented, [...] "ou can see why men {{wanted to get the}} look. Perhaps they noted the effect Cumberbatch, by no means <b>your</b> <b>standard</b> telly hunk, had on lady viewers … and decided it must {{have something to do with}} the clobber.

500|$|The {{film was}} re-released in its {{original}} form to American theatres on October 31, 2003 and received great critical acclaim. Based on 35 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, Eyes Without a Face received an average 97% fresh rating with an average rating of 8.1/10. The reviewers commented on the film's poetic nature and noted the strong influence of French poet and filmmaker Jean Cocteau. Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader praised the film, referring to it as [...] "absurd and as beautiful as a fairy tale". J. Hoberman of The Village Voice declared the film [...] "a masterpiece of poetic horror and tactful, tactile brutality". The Encyclopedia of Horror Films noted the Cocteau influence, stating that [...] "Franju invests [...] with a weird poetry in which the influence of Cocteau is unmistakable". David Edelstein of Slate also compared the film to Cocteau's work, commenting that [...] "the storyline is <b>your</b> <b>standard</b> obsessed-mad-doctor saga, one step above a Poverty Row Bela Lugosi feature ... ut it's Lugosi by way of Cocteau and Ionesco". In the early 2010s, Time Out conducted a poll with several authors, directors, actors and critics who have worked within the horror genre to vote for their top horror films. Eyes Without a Face placed at number 34 on their top 100 list.|$|E
40|$|In {{the recent}} {{discussion}} of happiness {{it has become}} popular to claim that being happy means having a certain positive attitude towards your life. This attitude involves both a judgement that your life measures up to <b>your</b> <b>standards</b> {{and a feeling of}} satisfaction with your life. In this paper, I am going to discuss a serious problem inherent in this account that has important ramifications for the normative question of how we ought to pursue happiness. If happiness is in part determined by <b>your</b> <b>standards,</b> how shall we determine whether you are happier in one life than in another when <b>your</b> <b>standards</b> change across these lives? Perhaps you will judge a life as a parent as better than a childless life, if you were to become a parent, but judge a childless life as better than a parenting life, if you were to remain childless. Which standard should determine the comparative happiness of the two lives? In this paper, I shall argue that some innocent-looking answers to this question will generate inconsistencies. To find an acceptable resolution, we need to make a difficult choice between what {{on the face of it}} look like two equally valid principles of happiness. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.

500|$|... "Gehenna" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Writing for The A.V. Club, Todd VanDerWerff rated the episode a C+, finding {{that it was}} [...] "almost completely crippled by ... self-seriousness". VanDerWerff felt that the episode reflected Millennium seeming simultaneously both [...] "intrinsically of the 1990s" [...] and [...] "ahead of its time", find that its treatment of [...] "the dread and shadowy fear and sense that the world held several cloaked and mysterious evils for well-to-do Americans" [...] was a symptom of 1990s preoccupation with [...] "the end of the world" [...] while foreshadowing {{the mood of the}} United States following the September 11 attacks in New York in 2001. As a result, VanDerWerff described the episode, and the series, as being [...] "the first post-Sept. 11 show". Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated the episode 4.5 out of 5, noting that there is [...] "more here than just <b>your</b> <b>standard</b> serial killer show". Gibron praised the episode's [...] "atypical storyline", which he felt was achieved through [...] "some suggestive effects and wonderful crosscutting". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode two-and-a-half stars out of five, calling it [...] "a somewhat humdrum story". Shearman and Pearson felt that the episode's core premise—that of [...] "a telemarking company being a front for a terrorist cult"—was intriguing, but that the [...] "millennial flavour" [...] that accompanies this resulted in the episode seeming [...] "a little confused".|$|E
500|$|The {{gameplay}} received mixed responses. Both John Scalzo and the Game Revolution reviewer {{compared the}} gameplay to Donkey Kong Country, with Scalzo describing {{the game as}} having a [...] "familiar, yet unique" [...] quality that he attributed to Naughty Dog's design, while the Game Revolution reviewer concluded that the game [...] "fails to achieve anything really new or revolutionary" [...] as a platform game, and the Next Generation reviewer {{went so far as}} to call it [...] "the single most derivative game to ever hit a console", adding that [...] "anyone who's played even one side-scrolling action game could have come up with every single game element found in Crash." [...] Electronic Gaming Monthlys four reviewers, while having a more positive overall impression of the game, admitted that the gameplay is short on originality, with Shawn Smith summarizing, [...] "It's like the original Mario with some 3-D effects thrown in." [...] They also noted that the gameplay is not genuinely 3-D, though they praised the mixture of side scrolling, front scrolling, and back scrolling sections. Tommy Glide remarked that the gameplay [...] "lacks some of the diversity and innovative next-gen qualities found in Sega's Nights and Nintendo's Mario 64." [...] The IGN reviewer said that the game [...] "isn't a revolution in platform game design. It's pretty much <b>your</b> <b>standard</b> platform game". However, he noted the game's [...] "surprisingly deep" [...] depth of field and use of different perspectives as exceptions to the platforming formula. Jim Sterling of Destructoid.com stated that the game has aged poorly since its initial release and cited the lack of support for DualShock thumbsticks, a poor camera as well as substandard jumping and spinning controls.|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} from music critics for both Guetta's catchy production and Rowland's strong vocals. It {{was called the}} strongest and most commercial single choice from Guetta's album, One Love. Critics noted that the song's opening piano riff {{was similar to that}} from Coldplay's hit single [...] "Clocks" [...] (2002). David Jefferes of Allmusic gave the song a thumbs up saying, calling [...] "When Love Takes Over" [...] one of the strongest songs from One Love and praising the [...] " [...] the powerful voice of Kelly Rowland for one grand, uplifting floor-filler." [...] Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly agreed calling the song the [...] "most memorable from the album" [...] and recalling [...] "Clocks" [...] by Coldplay to make [...] "a showstopper starring Kelly Rowland." [...] Michael Hibbard of MusicOMH was impressed with both the production and vocal work on [...] "When Love Takes Over". He pointed out the rarity in the amount of promotion given to the song, referring to [...] "When Love Takes Over" [...] being given [...] "its own poster on the Tube." [...] He also described the song as a [...] "euphoric masterpiece" [...] backed by [...] "at least eight remixes [...] " [...] and the accompany vocals from [...] "Destiny's Child songbird Kelly Rowland on hand for a diva masterclass." [...] Also agreeing with these comments was Fraser McAlpine from BBC Online who awarded the song four out of five stars. [...] "The genius ingredients include a thinly reworked go at the piano riff to 'Clocks' by Coldplay and handclaps ... And the fairy dust is...well...it's <b>your</b> <b>standard</b> dance-pop production, actually." [...] However he noted that the production was [...] "tastefully done {{to make sure that the}} good bits are not spoilt". Other elements of the song such as the [...] "bed of synthistrings, a skippy beat, a breakdown, some riffing glassy electronics and a dramatic, cinematic bottom end drone" [...] were praised. McAlpine also praised Rowland's appearance on the track, commenting who she sounded [...] "entirely unlike herself, so that even SHE is all buffed up and shiny."

[...] She continued: [...] "Perhaps that is the creators' intent, but most successful science fiction contains an element of, if not outright humor, then the absurd. That the human race will be enslaved not through brainwashing or firepower but adequate healthcare is pretty hilarious in a dark and almost possible way. And Anna and her crew seem to embody more of a Wall Street deregulated/Bernie Madoff mentality—big returns for minimum investment. And we all know how that turns out." [...] Linda Stasi for The New York Post conversely compared the Visitors to extremist Muslims. Though in the original series the aliens were a metaphor for Nazis, Stasi commented: [...] "TV shows no longer have to rely on Nazis, because now we have the hated extremist Muslims to make all bad-guy metaphors with", adding on the Visitors' appearance: [...] "Once you peel back the outer, good-looking shell, you've got <b>your</b> <b>standard</b> outer-space Nazi/Taliban lizard person lurking beneath." ...|$|E
