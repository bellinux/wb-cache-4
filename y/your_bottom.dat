2500|$|Unlike fashion-focused {{magazines}} and television shows, fashion blogs {{are able to}} be updated more frequently, keeping up to date with the new and up-and-coming fashion trends. [...] Not only are fashion blogs easier to access, many fashion blog readers (interviewed in Swedish fashion management study) stated that fashion blogs are far more personable and are more 'up to date' on both local and foreign trends. [...] These blogs are granting unlimited access to the fashion world to anyone that has a connection to a computer. Karen Kay also stated that, “These days, before a designer’s runway show has even finished, you can bet <b>your</b> <b>bottom</b> dollar that someone in the audience, or better still, backstage, has recorded every silhouette, signature shoe, styling detail and sulking supermodel, then uploaded it onto the internet for style watchers across the globe to enjoy”. The interviewed Swedish fashion blog readers, stated above, had also stated that fashion blogs had helped share and promote new trends to a much greater extent than other fashion mediums. [...] Unlike mainstream {{magazines and}} newspapers, which are constricted to what they write, blogs have the ease of writing about anything that interests author(s), allowing for a more broad spectrum of focused fashion trends.|$|E

[...] Luke Lewis of NME referred to the song as [...] "a comet-trail of sadness and exhilaration that's easily the equal of Robyn's breakthrough hit, 'With Every Heartbeat'." [...] The Guardians Michael Hann stated that song's [...] "pulsing synths and electronic percussion manage to sound both jackbooted and ineffably melancholy." [...] Jer Fairall wrote for PopMatters that [...] "he aggressive stun-gun rhythm of 'Dancing on My Own' can't hide a classic drama-played-out-on-the-dancefloor scenario inherited from standard bearers like ABBA's 'Dancing Queen' and Madonna's 'Into the Groove', nor is it cold enough not to melt at the touch of Robyn's warm, yearning vocals or the song's shimmering keyboard chime." [...] Matthew Horton of BBC Music described [...] "Dancing on My Own" [...] – along with [...] "Fembot" [...] and [...] "Cry When You Get Older" [...] – as [...] "scorchingly catchy, and laced with Robyn's familiar cordial of sparkling hook mixed with unutterable poignancy." ...|$|E

40|$|Software {{is a vital}} {{component}} of nearly every piece of modern technology. It is not a 'sub-system', able to be separated out from {{the system as a}} whole, but a 'co-system' that controls, manipulates, or interacts with the hardware and with the end user.

Learning to think about software from a safety perspective is the focus of this paper. We want you to think of software as part of the safety critical system, a major part. This requires 'system thinking' - being able to grasp the whole picture. Software's contribution to modern technology is both good and potentially bad. Software allows more complex and useful devices to be built. It can also contribute to plane crashes and power outages. We want you to see software in a whole new light, see it as a contributor to system hazards, and also as a possible fix or mitigation to some of those hazards...|$|R

At this point, the duo had rehashed Edge's pre-Brood gimmick as borderline gothic fan favorites most notable for a tendency to enter the ring through the audience.|$|R

Furthermore, Babbalanja, on this head, final, last thoughts you mortals have none; nor can have; and, at <b>bottom,</b> <b>your</b> own fleeting fancies are too often secrets to yourselves; and sooner may you get another's secret, than your own. Thus with the wisest of you all; you are ever unfixed. Do you show a tropical calm without? then, be sure a thousand contrary currents whirl and eddy within. The free, airy robe of your philosophy is but a dream, which seems true while it lasts; but waking again into the orthodox world, straightway you resume the old habit.

40|$|The {{strongly}} racist {{character of}} the Democratic presidential campaign of 1868 is displayed full-blown in this elaborate attack on Reconstruction and Republican support of Negro rights. Horses with the heads of Democratic candidate Horatio Seymour and running mate Francis P. Blair, Jr., pull a fine, ornate carriage in a race with a rude wagon drawn by asses with the heads of Republican candidates Ulysses S. Grant and Schuyler Colfax. The Democratic carriage pulls ahead in the race, heading toward a cheering crowd {{and a series of}} floral arches held by young maidens. The U. S. Capitol is visible beyond. In the carriage are four allegorical figures: Liberty, holding the Constitution and a banner which reads "Our Glorious Union D̀istinct, like the Billows, One, Like the Sea' This is a White Man's Government!"; Navigation, holding a miniature ship; Agriculture, holding sheaves of wheat and a scythe; and Labor, represented by a bearded man with a hammer and flywheel. In contrast to the Democratic vehicle, the Republican wagon has stalled before a pile of rocks and a cemetery strewn with bones representing " 100, 000, 000 White Lives, the Price of Nigger Freedom!" Its wheels are blocked by a large stone "Killing Taxation" and a skeleton. Other stones represent "Ruined Commerce," "$ 30, 000, 000 stolen from the Treasury," and "Negro Supremacy. " In the wagon are the grim reaper, Pennsylvania representative and abolitionist Thaddeus Stevens, an unidentified man, a black woman, and an idle black man. Stevens: "Colfax pulls like the d [...] l but old tangleleg [i. e., Grant] aint worth a d [...] n! Push at the tailboard, Ben!" Massachusetts representative and former Civil War general Benjamin F. Butler, pushing the wagon from the rear, replies, "I am pushing, Thad! but we are stuck. Seymour is a mile ahead now. " Silver spoons protrude from Butler's pocket. (For the origins of Butler's nickname "Silver Spoons," see "The Radical Party on a Heavy Grade," no. 1868 - 14.) The black woman reassures Stevens, "Don't worry you'sef, honey, or you'll peg out afore we get de paeket for Seymour's in de White House and we's good for Salt River [colloquialism for political disaster]. " The black man asks, "War's dis wagon gwine wid dis member ob Congress. I'd jes like to know?" The unidentified man remarks, "The Democracy would not take me so I thought I'd come back & stick by you Uncle Thad, and we'll all go to H-ll together!"
