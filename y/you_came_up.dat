Upon hearing [...] "I Was Here", Beyoncé got chills, and {{immediately}} made up her mind, [...] "Oh my god, I have to have this song." [...] September 2011 was going to mark the tenth anniversary of the September 11 attacks and Beyoncé thought that the song would perfectly complete her album, which had nearly reached completion. The mastering of 4 was delayed to allow Beyoncé to record the song. Warren {{was present at the}} recording sessions, which took place two days following her conversation with Beyoncé and Jay-Z on the phone. She said, [...] "There's nothing better than to hear the song that <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> with [...] It's like your heart found another heart", before adding: ...|$|E
500|$|In 2010, Nas {{released}} his tenth studio album Distant Relatives, a collaboration with Damian Marley that reinvigorated the rapper creatively. He soon became distracted by tax problems and an expensive, highly publicized divorce {{from his wife}} Kelis months before their son's birth, events that influenced his direction for Life Is Good. His songwriting on the album was also influenced by adjusting back to life as a single man. Nas also wanted to write more original subject matter rather than another album [...] "about how <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> in the hood and how {{you had to make}} it out of the hood". Although he did not find his album [...] "quite so much about the marriage or the divorce", Nas likened Life Is Good to Marvin Gaye's 1978 album Here, My Dear, which was written by Gaye in response to his own deteriorating marriage and released as a financial settlement. For Life Is Goods album cover, a photo was taken of Nas in a polished white suit, sitting in a night club's VIP lounge, appearing forlorn, and holding over his knee Kelis' actual green wedding dress, which he said was the only item she left him. When writing the album, Nas also reflected on aging and maturation, fatherhood, and his 20-year experience in hip hop music. Nas discussed the album's personal subject matter in an interview for Billboard: ...|$|E
2500|$|British rock critic Nick Kent wrote that, {{sometime}} in the mid-1960s: [...] "Wilson began getting wrapped up in big complicated ideas like 'Art' and 'Civilization'. People would tell him the most commonplace facts about such-and-such a composer or painter and Brian would just flip right out ... A visitor would read a fragment from a volume of Omar Khayyam and Brian Wilson would leap up, his head just awash with all this magical dumb inspiration, screaming 'Wow' and 'Too much' {{over and over again}} because he sensed right there and then that this guy had access to all the answers to the problems besetting our troubled universe. According to unnamed participants of the Smile sessions, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> to the house and introduced something new to Brian's thought processes–astrology, a different way to think about the relationship of Russia to China, anything at all–if {{all of a sudden he}} was into that, it would find its way into the music. You could hear a bit and say, 'I know where that feeling came from.'" [...] Tony Asher remembers that Wilson [...] "exhibit this awful taste. His choice of movies, say, was invariably terrible. ... every four hours we'd spend writing songs, there'd be about 48 hours of these dopey conversations about some dumb book he'd just read. Or else he'd just go on and on about girls." ...|$|E
