5|$|Akodon caenosus is the {{smallest}} of the Argentine members of the A.boliviensis group–indeed, among {{the smallest}} of all species of Akodon. The upperparts are uniformly colored, but their tone is variable: generally ochraceous brown, but approaching yellow, red, or olivaceous in some individuals. Reddish tones occur mostly in lactating females. High-altitude animals are generally lighter, but there is also conspicuous variation within populations. The ears are similar to the upperparts, but some individuals have the sides more rich and clear in color. The underparts are clearly different in color, varying from light gray to <b>yellowish</b> or reddish. There are <b>yellowish</b> rings around the eyes, which are more highly developed in high-altitude populations. There are white to <b>yellowish</b> hairs on the fore- and hindfeet. The tail is variably covered with hair and is dark brown above and white to buffy below.|$|E
5|$|The summer pelage of {{different}} subspecies varies drastically but is generally dark or cinnamon brown. The back is dull, <b>yellowish,</b> ochre-grey in colour, with dark brown to black {{tips of the}} hairs. The latus (side of the body between therib cageand theuppermost and largest part of the hip bone) is tinged with rust-red, and the underside is pale <b>yellowish</b> ochre. In winter, its pelage turns grey, with a <b>yellowish</b> tinge; the underside becomes greyish brown, and the anterior dorsum and head are tinged with yellow. The incisive foramen (funnel-shaped opening in the bonyplate of theskull, located in {{the roof of the}} mouth,immediately behind theincisor teethwhere blood vessels and nerves pass) are round, small, and are detached from the palatine foramen.|$|E
5|$|The <b>yellowish</b> hyphae {{are between}} 15 and 13.5μm wide with {{a wall of}} {{variable}} thickness. There are clamp connections at the septa (the walls dividing individual hypha cells). The flesh in the cap is radial, and {{is made up of}} <b>yellowish</b> hyphae of between 2.4 and 20μm wide. The pileipellis, the outermost layer of hyphae, forms a cutis, and on older specimens (and on the small scales) forms a trichoderm.|$|E
5|$|Boletus pisciodorus {{is similar}} in form to Tylopilus tabacinus. Unlike, T.tabacinus however, B.pisciodorus has spores that are hyaline in mass, and dark <b>yellowish</b> brown rather than hyaline when viewed with a light microscope. Further, B.pisciodorus has a fishy odor that is {{apparent}} in both fresh and dried specimens.|$|E
5|$|One unusual specimen, {{described}} by Branch and Farrell (1988), from Summer Pride, East London in South Africa, was striped. The pattern {{consisted of a}} narrow (1 scale wide) pale <b>yellowish</b> stripe that ran from the crown of the head {{to the tip of}} the tail.|$|E
5|$|The Styan's {{red panda}} is {{supposedly}} larger and darker in color than the Western {{member of the}} species, but with considerable variation in both subspecies, and some individuals may be brown or <b>yellowish</b> brown rather than red.|$|E
5|$|The larger scutes {{display a}} pattern of black or yellow lines. The wood turtle's {{plastron}} (ventral shell) is <b>yellowish</b> in color and has dark patches. The posterior margin of the plastron terminates in a V-shaped notch. Although sometimes speckled with <b>yellowish</b> spots, the upper surface of the head is often a dark gray to solid black. The ventral surfaces of the neck, chin, and legs are orange to red with faint yellow stripes along the lower jaw of some individuals. Seasonal variation in color vibrancy {{have been known to}} occur.|$|E
5|$|The muzzle is {{narrow and}} long. The lower eyelid {{contains}} a large, transparent disk. The head is olive-brown. There are black scales {{with a white}} border between the eyes and the ears. The body is somewhat darker than the head and covered with irregular black and white spots above and is bluish white below. The limbs are <b>yellowish</b> white below. The tail is light brown above, but has two rows of darker spots, and <b>yellowish</b> white below. Snout-to-vent length is 83mm (3.3in), head length 10mm (0.39in), head width 6.5mm (0.26in), length of the body 33mm (1.3in), length of the forelimb 15mm (0.59in), length of the hindlimb 23mm (0.91in), and length of the (incomplete) tail 40mm (1.6in).|$|E
5|$|The spores are 7–9 by 5–6.5μm, broadly , smooth, and {{strongly}} amyloid (it turns black when treated with Melzer's reagent). The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored. The pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) are not differentiated. The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) {{are embedded in}} the gill edge and very inconspicuous, club-shaped, 26–36 by 5–10μm, and have tips that are covered with contorted projections that can be slender or thick. The flesh of the gills is homogeneous, and pale <b>yellowish</b> to dirty brown when stained in iodine. The flesh of the cap has a distinct , a well-differentiated hypoderm (a region of tissue immediately under the pellicle), and a filamentous tramal body (gill tissue); it is pale <b>yellowish</b> to sordid brownish in iodine stain.|$|E
5|$|The spores are spherical, and 3.5–4.5µm in diameter. They {{are covered}} with short narrow {{abruptly}} terminating projections of a translucent (hyaline) substance, which turn a pale cinnamon brown in potassium hydroxide, and a dark dull brown (nearly sepia) when stained with iodine. The capillitium is made of {{what appears to be}} encrusted cylindrical filaments 3–6µm in diameter, of a color varying from hyaline to dull <b>yellowish</b> brown in potassium hydroxide, and <b>yellowish</b> in iodine; its walls are thickened {{to the point where the}} interior (lumen) appears as only a line. Either two or four spores are attached to the basidia, and the sterigmata (extensions of the basidia that attach the spores) are long, up to 20µm. Geastrum triplex does not have cystidia.|$|E
5|$|With its short stipe {{and sticky}} cap, S.quiescens {{is similar to}} S.brevipes. It may be {{distinguished}} from the latter species {{by the color of}} the young (light-brown) cap, the glandular dots at the top of stipes in mature specimens, and the <b>yellowish</b> color {{at the top of the}} stipe.|$|E
5|$|Young {{individuals}} have <b>yellowish</b> or greenish tail tips {{and engage in}} caudal luring. The tail tip is wriggled to lure prey, such as frogs and lizards, within striking distance. Wharton (1960) observed captive specimens exhibiting this behavior between 07:20 and 19:40 hours, which suggests it is a daytime activity.|$|E
5|$|After its {{discovery}} in 1897, {{it has never}} been recorded again and it is now considered extinct; the presence of introduced black rats on María Madre may have contributed to its extinction. Oryzomys nelsoni was a large species, distinguished in particular by its long tail, robust skull, and large incisors. It was reddish to <b>yellowish</b> above and mostly white below. Its diet may have included plant material and small animals.|$|E
5|$|Field {{characteristics}} used {{to distinguish}} Boletus auripes from potential lookalike species include the <b>yellowish</b> brown to chestnut-brown cap surface that becomes paler with age, yellow flesh {{that does not}} stain blue, and a reticulate stem. B.aureissimus has a similar appearance, but has a honey-yellow to bright yellow or yellow-ochre cap, less conspicuous stem reticulation, and a more limited range covering Florida west to Texas. B.aureissimus var. castaneus has a purplish-brown cap with a texture like velvet.|$|E
5|$|Mourning doves can be {{afflicted with}} several {{different}} parasites and diseases, including tapeworms, nematodes, mites, and lice. The mouth-dwelling parasite Trichomonas gallinae is particularly severe. While a mourning dove will sometimes host it without symptoms, it will often cause <b>yellowish</b> {{growth in the}} mouth and esophagus that will eventually starve the host to death. Avian pox is a common, insect-vectored disease.|$|E
5|$|Scandium is a {{soft metal}} with a silvery appearance. It {{develops}} a slightly <b>yellowish</b> or pinkish cast when oxidized by air. It {{is susceptible to}} weathering and dissolves slowly in most dilute acids. It does not react with a 1:1 mixture of nitric acid (HNO3) and 48% hydrofluoric acid (HF), possibly due {{to the formation of}} an impermeable passive layer. Scandium turnings ignite in air with a brilliant yellow flame to form scandium(III) oxide.|$|E
5|$|Several {{chemical}} tests {{can be used}} to help verify an identification of L.rugosiceps. A drop of ammonium hydroxide solution turns the cap cuticle a reddish color or is unreactive, and yellow or unreactive on the flesh. A drop of dilute potassium hydroxide (KOH) turns the cap surface red, and the flesh <b>yellowish</b> to orangish. Application of iron (II) sulphate solution produces a gray color on the cap surface, and greenish-gray to olive coloration on the flesh.|$|E
5|$|Spathularia flavida may be {{distinguished}} from the velvet-foot fairy fan (Spathulariopsis velutipes) by differences in the stem: S.velutipes is fuzzy and brown rather than smooth and <b>yellowish.</b> The fuzziness {{is a result of}} a thin layer of intertwined hyphae that cover the stem, which project short hyphae outward from the surface. The closely related species S.neesi has an ochre color, spores that measure 60–80 by 1.5–2µm, and paraphyses that are branched on the upper parts. Neolecta irregularis is roughly similar in appearance to S.flavida, but lacks a sharply differentiated, spoon-shaped head, has a stem lighter in color than the head, and microscopically, has much smaller oval to elliptical spores that measure 5.5–8.5 by 3–4µm. Another <b>yellowish</b> earth-tongue fungus, Microglossum rufum, has a well-defined oval to spoon-shaped head, and sausage- to spindle-shaped spores that are 18–38 by 4–6µm.|$|E
5|$|Spore {{prints are}} purplish brown to {{chocolate}} brown. The smooth, thick-walled spores are broadly ellipsoidal, and typically measure 5.8–7.3 by 3.7–4.4μm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored, club-shaped, hyaline (translucent, and measure 20–21.3 by 5.8–7.0μm. Cystidia on the gill edge (cheilocystidia) are sac-shaped to club-shaped, hyaline to pale <b>yellowish</b> brown in color, and have dimensions of 18.3–25.6 by 7.3–11.0μm; {{there are no}} cystidia on the gill face (pleurocystidia).|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal glands}} {{are located on}} both sides of the body in the retroperitoneum, above and {{slightly}} medial to the kidneys. In humans, the right adrenal gland is pyramidal in shape, whereas the left is semilunar or crescent shaped and somewhat larger. The adrenal glands measure approximately 3.0cm in width, 5.0cm in length, and up to 1.0cm in thickness. Their combined weight in an adult human ranges from 7 to 10grams. The glands are <b>yellowish</b> in colour.|$|E
5|$|The cane cholla (or {{walking stick}} cholla, tree cholla, chainlink cactus, etc.) (Cylindropuntia imbricata) is a cactus {{found in the}} Southwestern United States and {{northern}} Mexico, including some cooler regions in comparison to many other cacti. It occurs primarily in the arid regions of the Southwestern United States in the states of Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, and Nevada. It is often conspicuous because of its shrubby or even tree-like size, its silhouette, and its long-lasting <b>yellowish</b> fruits.|$|E
5|$|The condor's {{head and}} neck have few feathers, and {{the skin of the}} {{head and neck}} is capable of {{flushing}} noticeably in response to emotional state, a capability that can serve as communication between individuals. The skin color varies from <b>yellowish</b> to a glowing reddish-orange. The birds do not have true syringeal vocalizations. They can make a few hissing or grunting sounds only heard when very close.|$|E
5|$|The {{goldcrest}} {{is usually}} easily distinguished from other small birds in its range, but poor views could possibly lead to confusion {{with the common}} firecrest or yellow-browed warbler. The adult common firecrest has a distinguishing face pattern showing a bright white supercilium (eyebrow) and black eye-stripe, and the juvenile usually shows enough of this face pattern to be readily distinguished from the plain-faced goldcrest. The yellow-browed warbler has a <b>yellowish</b> supercilium and pale crown stripe, so also shows a different head pattern. The ruby-crowned kinglet, an American Regulus species and a potential vagrant in Europe, could {{be more difficult to}} distinguish. It has a plain face like its Old World cousin, but the male has a red crest without any yellow or a black border. Female and juvenile ruby-crowned kinglets lack the ruby-red crown patch, but compared with the similarly crestless juvenile goldcrest, the American bird is larger in size, has an obvious whitish eyering, and <b>yellowish</b> wing bars.|$|E
5|$|The two {{subspecies}} {{are similar}} in coloration, but differ {{in the shade of}} the cap. The northern subspecies, living in Central Pacific Costa Rica, has a lighter cap than the southern subspecies, which lives in Panama and in parts of Costa Rica near Panama. The southern subspecies also has more <b>yellowish</b> limbs and underparts.|$|E
5|$|Wilson's {{disease is}} a genetic {{disorder}} in which copper builds up in the body. Symptoms are typically related to the brain and liver. Liver related symptoms include vomiting, weakness, fluid build up in the abdomen, swelling of the legs, <b>yellowish</b> skin, and itchiness. Brain related symptoms include tremors, muscle stiffness, trouble speaking, personality changes, anxiety, and seeing or hearing things that others do not.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the genus}} Mycena, {{it is found}} in the section Filipedes, on account of the cheilocystidia covered with evenly spaced, short {{cylindrical}} excrescences, and its size and occurrence on wood. It can be separated from {{the other members of the}} section on account of a cap with <b>yellowish</b> to olive shades, gills with pinkish hints and stems with vaguely violet colouration.|$|E
5|$|Yellow tea: This tea is {{processed}} {{in a similar}} manner to green tea, but instead of immediate drying after fixation, it is stacked, covered, and gently heated in a humid environment. This initiates oxidation in the chlorophyll of the leaves through non-enzymatic and non-microbial means, which results in a <b>yellowish</b> or greenish-yellow colour.|$|E
5|$|A {{saturated}} solution of equal parts of thallium(I) formate (Tl(CHO2)) and thallium(I) malonate (Tl(C3H3O4)) in water {{is known as}} Clerici solution. It is a mobile, odorless liquid which changes from <b>yellowish</b> to colourless upon reducing the concentration of the thallium salts. With a density of 4.25g/cm3 at 20°C, Clerici solution {{is one of the}} heaviest aqueous solutions known. It was used in the 20th century for measuring the density of minerals by the flotation method, but its use has discontinued due to the high toxicity and corrosiveness of the solution.|$|E
5|$|Adults have {{forewings}} {{that are}} <b>yellowish</b> brown {{in color and}} have a dark spot located {{in the center of}} their body. The moths have a wingspan ranging from 32 to 45mm, and live over thirty days in optimal conditions. However, the life span ranges from five to fifteen days on average. They are nocturnal and hide in vegetation during the day. Adult moths collect nectar or other plant exudates from a large number of plants, and live for 12 to 16 days. Females can lay up to 2,500 eggs in their lifetime.|$|E
5|$|Amanita regalis {{is easily}} {{distinguished}} from A.muscaria {{by the absence}} of any red color in the cap, and the yellow patches on the stem. If it is a form that has a pale-colored, yellowish-brown cap, Amanita regalis may be confused with the blusher (Amanita rubescens, edible). The latter species can be identified by the flesh-colored tinge it stains when cut or bruised, and also by the color of the flesh underneath the cuticle: A.regalis is <b>yellowish</b> while A.rubescens is white. Amanita pantherina has a similar color, but has white flesh below the cap cuticle, and a cup-shaped bulb with distinct margins around the edge.|$|E
5|$|As {{the comet}} {{approached}} the Sun, {{it continued to}} brighten, shining at 2ndmagnitude in February, and showing a growing pair of tails, the blue gas tail pointing straight away from the Sun and the <b>yellowish</b> dust tail curving away along its orbit. On March 9, a solar eclipse in China, Mongolia and eastern Siberia allowed observers there to see the comet in the daytime. Hale–Bopp had its closest approach to Earth on March 22, 1997 {{at a distance of}} 1.315AU.|$|E
5|$|Beta, Delta and Kappa are {{multiple}} star systems containing six, two and four stars respectively. Located near {{the tail of}} the toucan, Beta Tucanae's two brightest components, Beta1 and Beta2 are separated by an angle of 27 arcseconds and have apparent magnitudes of 4.4 and 4.5 respectively. They can be separated in small telescopes. A third star, Beta3 Tucanae, is separated by 10 arcminutes from the two, and able {{to be seen as a}} separate star with the unaided eye. Each star is itself a binary star, making six in total. Lying in the southwestern corner of the constellation around 251 light-years away from Earth, Delta Tucanae consists of a blue-white primary contrasting with a <b>yellowish</b> companion. Delta Tucanae A is a main sequence star of spectral type B9.5V and an apparent magnitude of 4.49. The companion has an apparent magnitude of 9.3. The Kappa Tucanae system shines with a combined apparent magnitude of 4.25, and is located around 68 light-years from the Solar System. The brighter component is a <b>yellowish</b> star, known as Kappa Tucanae A with an apparent magnitude of 5.33 and spectral type F6V, while the fainter lies 5 arcseconds to the northwest. Known as Kappa Tucanae B, it has an apparent magnitude of 7.58 and spectral type K1V. Five arcminutes to the northwest is a fainter star of apparent magnitude 7.24 —actually a pair of orange main sequence stars of spectral types K2V and K3V, which can be seen individually as stars one arcsecond apart with a telescope such as a Dobsonian with high power.|$|E
5|$|Described by German {{zoologist}} Friedrich Boie in 1826, {{the genus}} Phylloscopus contains about 50 species of small insectivorous Old World woodland warblers which are either greenish or brown above and <b>yellowish,</b> white or buff below. The genus was formerly {{part of the}} Old World warbler family Sylvidae, but has now been split off as a separate family Phylloscopidae. The chiffchaff's closest relatives, other than former subspecies, are a group of leaf warblers which similarly lack crown stripes, a yellow rump or obvious wing bars; they include the willow, Bonelli's, wood and plain leaf warblers.|$|E
5|$|Diamonds exhibit fluorescence, that is, they emit {{light of}} various colors and intensities under long-wave {{ultraviolet}} light (365nm): Cape series stones (type Ia) usually fluoresce blue, and these stones may also phosphoresce yellow, a unique property among gemstones. Other possible long-wave fluorescence colors are green (usually in brown stones), yellow, mauve, or red (in type IIb diamonds). In natural diamonds, there is typically {{little if any}} response to short-wave ultraviolet, but {{the reverse is true}} of synthetic diamonds. Some natural type IIb diamonds phosphoresce blue after exposure to short-wave ultraviolet. In natural diamonds, fluorescence under X-rays is generally bluish-white, <b>yellowish</b> or greenish. Some diamonds, particularly Canadian diamonds, show no fluorescence.|$|E
5|$|First called Agaricus cinerellus by Finnish mycologist Petter Karsten in 1879, he {{transferred}} {{it to the}} genus Mycena that same year. In his 1936 Flora Agaricina Danica (Agaric flora of Denmark) Jakob Emanuel Lange referred it to the genus Omphalia; Omphalia cinerea (P. Karst.) J.E. Lange is now a synonym. Mycena cineroides was named and described as a new species distinct from M.cinerella by Hintikka in 1963, who thought it to be unique due to its narrowly acute cap that lacked brownish or <b>yellowish</b> tones, decurrent gills, and two-spored basidia. However, intermediate forms of it have been found, and some authorities, like Dutch Mycena specialist Maas Geesteranus, believe it {{should be treated as}} a synonym of M.cinerella.|$|E
5|$|Formerly {{a member}} of Hygrophoropsis, Aphroditeola olida is also similar in {{appearance}} to H.aurantiaca but can be distinguished from the false chanterelle by its smaller, pinkish fruit bodies and candy-like odour. It also has smaller spores. Chrysomphalina chrysophylla has a <b>yellowish</b> brown cap and unforked yellow gills. Cortinarius hesleri, an eastern North American species that associates with oaks, has a rusty brown spore print and a cortina in young specimens. The poisonous jack-o'-lantern mushrooms (genus Omphalotus) comprise another group of lookalikes; however, they have straight, non-forked true gills. The European wood-rotting species Haasiella splendidissima, sometimes confused with H.aurantiaca, is most readily distinguished from the latter by its pink spore print and gills that do not fork.|$|E
