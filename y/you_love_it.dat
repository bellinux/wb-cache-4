5|$|I am {{excited to}} give my Australian fans the World Premiere of 'Love On Top'! Thank you for the amazing {{response}} to the song at radio. I have worked very hard on this video, this song is special to me and I had an idea for the video based on {{some of my favorite}} male groups. I remember seeing videos from New Edition, The Jackson 5 and the Temptations, bands I love for their beautiful harmonies, and precise choreography and I always wanted to make a video and be part of a boy group myself. It was so much fun. I put my heart and soul into 'Love On Top' and I hope <b>you</b> <b>love</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
500|$|Chesnutt shopped {{the album}} around to record companies, but they mistook {{it for a}} demo and {{rejected}} it. They encouraged him to reproduce it smoothly, rearrange the drums, and rerecord his vocals. He {{said in an interview}} for Vibe at the time, [...] "I refuse to re-record it-that defeats the purpose. What about the experience I had in my bedroom? To go back to the studio, I'd be chasing something. If you're listening to it and <b>you</b> <b>love</b> <b>it,</b> then it's already done what it's supposed to do." [...] In September 2002, Chesnutt made the album available through his website, and released it on September 24 on his own label Ready, Set, Go! ...|$|E
500|$|... "Express Yourself" [...] {{begins with}} the sound of brass tinkling along, as Madonna chimes the opening line: [...] "Come on girls, do you believe in love? 'Cause I got {{something}} to say about it, And it goes something like this." [...] Handclaps and drum beats start as Madonna moves into the chorus of the song, with a thick vocal texture and high-pitched background singing. The chorus is aided by instrumentation from a saxophone and percussion. Madonna then sings the first verse of the song, as a violin sound is added after she finishes the bridge, [...] "Make you feel like a queen on the throne, make <b>you</b> <b>love</b> <b>it</b> till you never come down", a male voice repeating the last line. A synthesizer is played after the second verse as Madonna continues chanting the words [...] "Express yourself" [...] with background vocals singing [...] "Hey, hey, hey, hey" [...] alongside her.|$|E

500|$|The song's {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Dave Meyers, and shot at Venice Beach, California on 21 December 2009. The content of the video revolves around [...] "several couples as they deal with {{the ups and downs}} of relationships." [...] Prior to the release of the video, Lewis tweeted [...] "It's a strong, cool performance, lots of actors with a movie feel to it. I'm so proud of it and hope <b>you</b> <b>love</b> <b>it</b> â€“ enjoy!". The video was released on 12 February 2010. In the video, scenes of Lewis performing in front of a heart engulfed in flames, as well as sitting on an apartment floor barefoot, are intercut throughout the video amongst the narrative of the video. The video shows several couples ending their relationships, showing many of them are who angry and cannot cope with the heartbreak, but progresses to show how they manage to rebuild their relationships with one and other, ending with images suggesting healing, happiness and new relationships.|$|E
2500|$|Critics {{generally}} {{praised the}} overall gameplay. [...] Brandon Justice of IGN said, [...] "I can't stress enough how addictive this game is." [...] Of the Dreamcast port Game Revolution's reviewer stated [...] "a great arcade game became {{a good home}} game." [...] They further noted the game's high difficulty, and added that while the game was difficult it was not frustrating. [...] Michael Goncalves of PALGN added that the game was either a [...] "love or hate" [...] title, adding [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>love</b> <b>it,</b> you will cherish the game and play it to your hearts content." [...] Goncalves {{also pointed out that}} the game featured occasional pop up and clipping. [...] Reviews were split across the releases in regards to the game's soundtrack. PALGN cited Bad Religion and The Offspring as a high point of the game, while Game Revolution felt that the tracks were repetitive. GameSpot reviewer Jeff Gerstmann felt that the soundtrack was subjective to personal preference, stating [...] "you'll either want to crank the volume up or turn the music all the way down." [...] In a review for the PC version's altered soundtrack, fellow GameSpot reviewer Andrew Park felt that the new music was fitting for the game. However, they criticized the PC version for frame rate issues and recommended the Dreamcast version instead.|$|E

And then one day you show him off to your friends, and the conditions are changed, and he gets all excited and foolish, and you can't get him to do a thing. Children are like that.

I used to watch that flag, and thank God that Washington had not lived to see it. And {{sometimes}}, sometimes I wondered if God had allowed it to be put in irony just there." [...] His voice seemed to catch. [...] "That was wrong," [...] he continued. [...] "I should have known that this was our punishment--that the sight of it was my punishment.

Your ancestors founded it, and fought for it, that the descendants of mine might find a haven from tyranny. My friend, one-half of this city is German, and it is they who will save it if danger arises. You must come with me one night to South St. Louis, that you may know us. Then you will perhaps understand, Stephen.

[...] The child that would have inspired the song was his adopted son by Janet, his wife at that time.
