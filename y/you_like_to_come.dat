500|$|This was Weezer's {{first album}} to feature a {{transparent}} CD tray. Under the CD tray of the album, the word [...] "No" [...] {{can be found}} on the back of the spine. Some fans speculate that this is a response to the inside tray of Radiohead's album OK Computer which contains the text [...] "I like you. I like you. You are a wonderful person. I'm full of enthusiasm. I'm going places. I'll be happy to help you. I am an important person, would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> home with me?" [...] Weezer's official explanation was vague, with webmaster Karl Koch stating [...] "No means no." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I'm {{going to}} get down in the next street,' {{returned}} the old gentleman. 'If <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> on after us, you may have the job.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Then {{the most}} {{wonderful}} thing of all happened. One day a week later the Pretty Lady said, [...] "Would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> and live with me, Charlotte?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> Bunce <b>to</b> <b>come</b> in, papa?" [...] said Eleanor, {{thinking}} that {{the company of the}} old man might lighten his sorrow.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, Captain," [...] he argued; [...] "how would <b>you</b> have <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> out {{and find}} nothing but two half-burnt wrecks stuck on the sands--perhaps?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'If {{you want}} to hear London talk there will be some very good going on in here,' she said. 'If <b>you</b> would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> in with me----?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If there's {{anything}} I can do, I'm sure I'd do it: if there's {{anything at}} all you wish done.--Would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> {{up to the house}} again?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We-ell then! We-ell--" [...] So Madame {{gave her}} her congé. [...] "But if <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back--if you laike--then--" [...] Madame shrugged her shoulders--"you must come, I suppose." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{the night}} club. We {{take it in}} turns. Thursday is my night. Would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>come?</b> You {{see a lot of}} types. It's only round the corner." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> me," [...] {{he asked}} hesitatingly, [...] "supposing I get away early--would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> me <b>to</b> <b>come</b> {{in and say}} good night to you later on?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Anything but {{the dead}} sea of your respectable churches, Marie. Positively, it's {{too much to ask}} of a man. Eva, do <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> go? <b>Come,</b> stay at home and play with me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah, but, dear, {{you must}} {{remember}} your mother. She gets so anxious, and every word the doctor says is law. How would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> me <b>to</b> <b>come</b> again <b>like</b> this, perhaps?--like Santa Claus?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps you haven’t {{seen many}} ships," [...] said the impressionable mate, his eyes devouring her face. [...] "Would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> {{and have a}} look at our cabin?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'He {{looks as}} if he was a-going, miss,' bawled Brittles, {{in the same manner as}} before. 'Wouldn't <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> and look at him, miss, in case he should?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{ought to}} be lonely enough to suit anybody," [...] {{observed}} Henshaw. He turned to Roger. [...] "How would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> out here some dark night all alone?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps I was indiscreet," [...] she confessed. [...] "I {{dare say}} {{you know as}} much about him as I do. At what time would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> me <b>to</b> <b>come</b> and help you change the bandages?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Show {{him into}} my study." [...] Then {{he turned to}} us. [...] "My mother's lawyer," [...] he explained. And in a lower voice: [...] "He is also Coroner--you understand. Perhaps <b>you</b> would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> with me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Look here, Sophia. If <b>you</b> don't <b>like</b> it, <b>you</b> {{need not}} talk about it. We shall always have a house in town, and you will not. If <b>you</b> don't <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> us, <b>you</b> needn't. That's about all.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think I have, Guy," [...] she answered, [...] "but I am just as {{pleased to}} see you. Would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> and be {{introduced}} to my uncle and guardian?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> for a walk?' said Hermione {{to each of}} them, one by one. And {{they all}} said yes, feeling somehow like prisoners marshalled for exercise. Birkin only refused.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sir," [...] said John Griffith, [...] "it's a fine day, and {{the crops}} {{are doing well}} enough. Would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> in and see the missus? She'll take it civil." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll pay all that. I'll write {{a note to}} my own solicitor, the sportsman who was my father's executor. Would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> me <b>to</b> <b>come</b> with <b>you</b> now? I expect he'll {{still be}} at his office." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly, Vicomte, and I {{will go with}} you. Get my parasol, Susan. Perhaps <b>you</b> would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>come,</b> too, Howard," [...] {{she added}} to Mr. Spence; [...] "it has {{been so long since}} you were here, and we have made many changes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hello?" [...] said Gertie {{over the}} telephone. [...] "Oh, hello, Carl; I just {{called up to}} tell you Adelaide {{is going to be}} here this evening, and I thought perhaps <b>you</b> might <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> up if <b>you</b> haven't {{anything}} better to do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{never showed}} you our oaken drainpipes," [...] he said. [...] "Some {{of the ones}} we dug up are lying quite close to here. Would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> and see them?" ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{laughed at}} the warning, though I had {{occasion}} to remember it, and looking for Alice I said, [...] "I am driving in to church to-night. Would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> with me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'A bad fit of croup. He {{was better}} when the letter went. My poor Violet! She has called in further advice; {{but it may}} come back. Do <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> with me?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{guess you}} can't help it," [...] {{and there was}} a twinkle in Jefferson's eyes. [...] "Your shell's quite a good fit, and <b>you</b> don't <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> out of it, though I almost {{thought you were going to}} a moment or two ago." ...|$|R
6000|$|She came back. Her {{face was}} once more {{softened}} in its expression of kindly concern. [...] "Would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> take my arm?" [...] she asked, a little timidly. [...] "We {{are close to}} the cottage now. Perhaps <b>you</b> would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> in and sit down. My aunt would be glad to see you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And I had rather {{you stayed}} here," [...] said his uncle, {{in a tone}} of voice that for him was good-humoured. [...] "Come, you need not be in a pet, like a child. Stay where you are now, and if <b>you</b> don't <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> again, why <b>you</b> can stay away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{dare say}} you're dull at home," [...] he said. [...] "Any day <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> and dine with me, I'll give you {{as good a}} bottle of wine as you'll get in London." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{any time}} will do, Mr. Langbourne," [...] she {{returned}} sweetly. Then, {{as if it}} had just occurred to her, she added, [...] "We're going after May-flowers this afternoon. Wouldn't <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> too?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{do not see}} {{how your}} private papers could have been of the {{slightest}} use to Peters," [...] I said; [...] "but if <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> down to my state-room you can question him yourself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Trade is slack," [...] Wolf resumed. [...] "The Spanish merchants {{see they}} can't ship much produce and are cutting their orders. I don't {{know if you}} feel the slump, but my African {{speculation}} promises well. The trouble is, I can't finance it properly, and if <b>you</b> would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> in----" ...|$|R
60|$|I'm {{not going}} to be devoured when I come, by anybody, unless <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to.</b> I shall <b>come</b> <b>to</b> your window with the birds, to be fed myself.|$|R
6000|$|... "You will excuse me, won't you?" [...] he begged. [...] "Enjoyed my evening tremendously. I'd <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> and dine with me one night." ...|$|R
