60|$|She cried while Timothy {{was being}} prepared, {{and they all}} had sherry {{afterward}} out of the yearly Christmas bottle, which would not be needed now. Ah! dear! She had been there five-and-forty years and Smither three-and-forty! And now they would be going to a tiny house in Tooting, to live on their savings and what Miss Hester had so kindly left them--for to take fresh service after the glorious past--No! But they would like just to see Mr. Soames again, and Mrs. Dartie, and Miss Francie, and Miss Euphemia. And {{even if they had}} to take their own cab, they felt they must go to the funeral. For six years Mr. Timothy had been their baby, getting <b>younger</b> <b>and</b> <b>younger</b> every day, till at last he had been too young to live.|$|E
6000|$|... 'When the dwellers in {{the villages}} saw us coming, they {{poisoned}} the wells and fled to the hill-summits. We fought with the Magadae who are born old, and grow <b>younger</b> <b>and</b> <b>younger</b> every year, and die when they are little children; and with the Laktroi who {{say that they are}} the sons of tigers, and paint themselves yellow and black; and with the Aurantes who bury their dead on the tops of trees, and themselves live in dark caverns lest the Sun, who is their god, should slay them; and with the Krimnians who worship a crocodile, and give it earrings of green glass, and feed it with butter and fresh fowls; and with the Agazonbae, who are dog-faced; and with the Sibans, who have horses' feet, and run more swiftly than horses. A third of our company died in battle, and a third died of want. The rest murmured against me, and said that I had brought them an evil fortune. I took a horned adder from beneath a stone and let it sting me. When they saw that I did not sicken they grew afraid.|$|E
60|$|MRS LUTESTRING. You, Mr President, {{were born}} {{intoxicated}} {{with your own}} well-fed natural exuberance. You cannot imagine what alcohol was to an underfed poor woman. I had carefully arranged my little savings so that I could get drunk, as we called it, once a week; and my only pleasure {{was looking forward to}} that poor little debauch. That is what saved me from suicide. I could not bear to miss my next carouse. But when I stopped working, and lived on my pension, the fatigue of my life's drudgery began to wear off, because, you see, I was not really old. I recuperated. I looked <b>younger</b> <b>and</b> <b>younger.</b> And at last I was rested enough to have courage and strength to begin life again. Besides, political changes were making it easier: life was a little better worth living for the nine-tenths of the people who used to be mere drudges. After that, I never turned back or faltered. My only regret now is that I shall die when I am three hundred or thereabouts. There was only one thing that made life hard; and that is gone now.|$|E

60|$|They did {{not that}} year get {{the trip to}} Margate; but in the autumn, after the great work of {{furnishing}} was finished, they did get several long jaunts, once out to Epping Forest on an omnibus, once in a steamer up to Kew, and several times across to Greenwich Park. Mrs. Andrews found it a very happy summer, free from the wear of anxiety, which, more even than the work, had brought on her long illness. She grew stronger and better {{than she had ever}} expected to be again, and those who had only known the pale, harassed-looking needlewoman of Croydon would not have recognized her now; indeed, as George said sometimes, his mother looked <b>younger</b> <b>and</b> <b>younger</b> every day. She had married very young, and was still scarcely five-and-thirty, and although she laughed and said that George was a foolish boy when he said that people always took her for his sister, she really looked some years younger than she was. Her step had regained its elasticity, and there was a ring of gladness and happiness in her voice which was very attractive, and even strangers sometimes looked round as they passed the bright, pleasant-looking woman chatting gayly with the two healthy, good-looking young fellows.|$|E

5000|$|During the 20th century, the {{popularity}} of cosmetics increased rapidly. Cosmetics are used by girls at increasingly young ages, especially in the United States. Because of the fast-decreasing age of make-up users, many companies, from high-street brands like Rimmel to higher-end products like Estee Lauder, cater to this expanding market by introducing flavored lipsticks and glosses, cosmetics packaged in glittery and sparkly packaging, and marketing and advertising using young models.

There is little {{that can be done}} to replace the slow-growing Mvule because the trees do not grow in forests, but rather haphazardly across Basoga. Efforts to grow them in nurseries are not successful because of blight. The Mvule is a resilient tree once it reaches a certain age, but before that age it is easily threatened. Every systematic effort to replant Mvules has failed over the last 30 years.|$|E
