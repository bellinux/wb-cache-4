6000|$|... "I {{understand}}, mademoiselle, I {{understand all}} you feel. It is most natural. <b>You</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are lukewarm--that we lack fire and energy--but trust me, {{it is not}} so." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "This seems {{a pretty}} wide promise," [...] said Oliver, {{after it had}} been read to us and {{translated}} by me to Quick. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> ought to take it on?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do forgive me," [...] he begged. [...] "I {{met a man}} outside {{who kept}} me gossiping about trifles. Tell me, do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can persuade your mother {{to come out to}} supper?" ...|$|E

60|$|John. We {{have offered}} no {{violence}} to you yet. Why do {{you seem to}} oblige us to it? I am an old soldier, and cannot starve, and if <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> shall be obliged {{to go back for}} want of provisions, you are mistaken.|$|E
