A film comedy, The Happy Family, was made about working-class resistance to the demolition that the festival required.

25|$|Cauliflower ear is a {{blood clot}} that forms under the skin in the ear, causing {{there to be a}} large bump in the ear; the bump tends to be {{extremely}} hard. To develop cauliflower ear one must be hit in the ear many times or hit hard for it to form into {{a blood clot}}. When having cauliflower ear it is important to get the ear drained of liquid that has built up. Otherwise the ear will require surgery to return to normal shape and size. The best way to prevent cauliflower is to wear headgear. This will protect <b>your</b> <b>ears</b> from taking hard hits.|$|E
500|$|While calling Undone MercyMe's [...] "most satisfying" [...] {{record to}} date, Russ Breimeier of Christianity Today {{regarded}} the songwriting as [...] "monotonous" [...] {{and felt that}} MercyMe was [...] "beginning to sound like they're repeating themselves". Josh Taylor of Jesus Freak Hideout gave the album three out of five stars, opining that [...] "Frankly, {{this is the same}} stuff they were doing three years and two albums ago... If you’re a diehard MercyMe fan, this disc will be music to <b>your</b> <b>ears.</b> But {{for those of us who}} long for change (Not drastic ones, mind you. But small, significant ones.), Undone seems redundant. It’s still good, but it’s beginning to become stale".|$|E
500|$|The album's sound also {{incorporates}} diverse musical {{elements from}} various genres such as funk, soul, rock, dubstep, and electro music. Houston Press writer Shea Serrano describes the album as a [...] "new {{take on the}} traditional Southern rap sound. It's slow and fast, wonky and flimsy, lyrical and hook-driven". Tom Breihan of Pitchfork Media perceives [...] "1980s synth-funk" [...] as its predominant musical element, but also finds each track musically varied, stating [...] "New melodic elements flit {{in and out of}} tracks just as you start to notice them, and there's a lot going on at any given moment". Big Boi has called the music [...] "basically what you been getting from Outkast. Raw lyricism and the funkiest grooves you can lay <b>your</b> <b>ears</b> on." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Skyfall" [...] was {{composed}} {{in the key}} of C minor using common time at 76beats per minute (Adagietto). Adele's vocal range spans , from the low note of G3 to the high note of C5, on the song. The lyrics closely follow the narrative of the film {{rather than focusing on}} romanticism. According to Epworth, the song is about [...] "death and rebirth", saying [...] "It's like, when the world ends and everything comes down around <b>your</b> <b>ears,</b> if you've got each other's back, you can conquer anything. From death to triumph, that was definitely something we set out to try and capture". The Daily Telegraph writer Neil McCormick described the lyrics as [...] "slightly sinister" [...] and containing references to a number of Bond tropes and motifs.|$|E
500|$|In general, [...] "Monkey Gone to Heaven" [...] {{received}} a positive critical reaction. British magazine NME, reviewing the UK 7" [...] single in March 1989, said: [...] "All the smart bastards are mixing strings with grunge guitars nowadays and the Pixies are no exception. Snarled vocals, sci-fi lyrics, {{and the usual}} molten lava flow of guitars burn another crater where <b>your</b> <b>ears</b> used to be. 'Monkey Gone to Heaven' pukes acid and poetry into America's AOR heartland before being splattered by the faster and more direct sting of the second track 'Manta Ray'." [...] Upon the release of Doolittle in April 1989, NMEs Edwin Pouncey added: [...] "the wonderful 'Monkey Gone to Heaven' is laced with lush but unobtrusive strings which nibble round {{the edge of the}} song and push it into a new realm of arrangement for the band. The opportunity to give 'Monkey' the full Philharmonic treatment, complete with heavenly harp, must have been a temptation to them. Wisely such a folly has been resisted." ...|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, several {{critics have}} reacted much less favorably towards [...] "I See the Light". Scott Chitwood of ComingSoon.net {{described}} the song {{as nothing more}} than [...] "pretty good". Tim McCall of The Star-Ledger reviewed [...] "I See the Light" [...] very negatively, describing it as both [...] "predictable" [...] and [...] "the sort of thing you'd plug <b>your</b> <b>ears</b> through". McCall went on to pan Slater's lyrics, describing them as a [...] "dull ... twenty-car pileup of cliche." [...] Times Richard Corliss described [...] "I See the Light" [...] as a [...] "generically tuneful love ballad". In another review, Corliss similarly commented, [...] "'I See the Light' ... isn't the most inventive of Menken melodies". Questioning the song's originality, Cindy White of IGN described [...] "I See the Light" [...] as [...] "unmemorable". Filmtracks.com wrote a mixed review, describing Levi's vocal performance as [...] "conservatively appropriate" [...] while criticizing Moore for [...] "lacking in depth of inflection." ...|$|E

500|$|McFall {{spent the}} next year at home, during which he took up {{mountain}} biking and climbing {{and worked as a}} fitness instructor at his local leisure centre. He also started running in the summer of 2003 as soon as he had his prosthesis fitted: [...] "I love that sound of air rushing past <b>your</b> <b>ears</b> and the freedom of it. I missed that and I wanted to get that back." [...] After taking up his place at Swansea University to pursue a Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) in sport and exercise science, he practised on the university's running track and also trained with a local running club, the Swansea Harriers Athletic Club. However, he found running difficult and uncomfortable as his prosthesis was not designed for the purpose, and frequently got damaged. Upon making inquiries at the Federation of Disability Sport Wales (FDSW), he was introduced to carbon-fibre running [...] "blades". He graduated from university with an upper second-class honours degree in summer 2004, taking part in his first race at the Disability Sports Events (DSE) Championships in the UK the same year.|$|E
500|$|... "Invading My Mind" [...] {{received}} generally positive acclaim {{from music}} critics. Tim Stack of Entertainment Weekly awarded the song a B+ rating, stating that: [...] "Remember when {{the thought of}} Jennifer Lopez releasing good music was as likely as a sequel to Angel Eyes? Well, our bad. The American Idol judge shot up the charts with the cheesetastic Ibiza chant On the Floor. Now she unites with Gaga pal RedOne for this appropriately named piece of pop pleasure: Once the club banger hits <b>your</b> <b>ears,</b> good or bad, you won't {{be able to get}} it out of your head." [...] Tanner Stransky, also of Entertainment Weekly, gave a positive review of the song, stating that between [...] "On the Floor" [...] and [...] "Invading My Mind" [...] Lopez is [...] "really made a glittery return to her extreme club/"Waiting for Tonight" [...] roots". She continued by stating: [...] "Sure, ' Mind' may be shallower than the kiddie pool, but this one is up from the first second... and never goes down". Monica Herrera from Billboard stated that on [...] "Invading My Mind" [...] RedOne and Lady Gaga bring the [...] "hit potential", while Lopez [...] "brings the heat". She continued by stating that the song is an [...] "irresistible '80s euphoria and release".|$|E
500|$|Producer Oren Koules told horror news website ShockTilYouDrop.com {{that there}} are eleven traps in the film, the most ever in the franchise. [...] There is one [...] "trap" [...] scene in the film that {{producers}} would not allow in previous Saw films that they described as [...] "too violent", [...] "too disgusting", and [...] "just wrong". [...] Melton later confirmed that was the [...] "Garage Trap", which involved a car and sets off a [...] "chain reaction" [...] with other characters. Gabby West {{was part of the}} trap. She told VH1, [...] "They molded my entire face, and basically my entire upper body after my belly button. They put layers and layers of different materials on you and you have two straws in your nose so you can breathe. It was so scary! They put so much of it on, you can't see and they put it in <b>your</b> <b>ears</b> so you can barely hear anything. That was part of the prep for the film, which was really cool, to have a dummy made of yourself. But scary." [...] Over 25 gallons of fake blood was used in the film, which was two and half times more than Saw II.|$|E

500|$|NME {{ranked the}} album number 411 {{on their list}} of the 500 {{greatest}} albums of all time, describing it as [...] "stoner humour and mind-bending beats from a hip-hop dream team" [...] and stating that [...] "MF DOOM and Madlib might not have invented underground rap, but they damn well perfected it". Pitchfork ranked the album at number 13 in their list of the top 100 albums of 2000–2004, commenting, [...] "While Madlib's special power played tricks on <b>your</b> <b>ears</b> – a sample you were sure {{was the sound of}} cars rolling by on the street might sound like the hiss of a record on a different day ("Rainbows") – MF Doom unfurled his clever lyrics like a roll of sod on earth... and the album curved in on itself like a two-way mirror."Pitchfork also ranked Madvillainy as the 25th best album of the 2000s, describing it as [...] "a preternaturally perfect pairing of like-minded talents" [...] who [...] "have each been responsible for tons of great, grimy underground hip-hop". Tiny Mix Tapes considered the album the fourth best of the 2000s. Rhapsody named the ranked the album 1st on its [...] "Hip-Hop's Best Albums of the Decade" [...] list. PopMatters positioned it at number 49 on their list of the 100 best albums of the 2000s and praised MF DOOM, who [...] "free-associates culture high and low, from Hemingway to Robh Ruppel, across tongue-tied internal rhymes", and Madlib's [...] "fusion breaks, psych soul, and Steve Reich", and called the album [...] "the best chemistry of either’s career, {{and one of the best}} of hip-hop, period". In 2016 Q listed Madvillainy among the albums that didn't appear in their list of the best albums of last 30 years, stating that [...] "underground hip-hop's cracked geniuses, Madlib and MF DOOM, unite on a labyrinth of weed-stained vignettes that combine invention and accessibility". Spin ranked it number 123 on their list of the 300 best albums of the past 30 years (1985–2014), calling it [...] "a genius cross-pollination of seemingly divergent styles". The magazine also positioned the album at number eight on the list of the 50 best hip hop debut albums since Reasonable Doubt. Stylus Magazine ranked the album number 13 on their list of the top 50 albums of 2000–2005, praising Madlib's production, based on [...] "an endless supply of funk, soul, and jazz samples", and stating that the album was [...] "displaying the future of hip-hop".|$|E
