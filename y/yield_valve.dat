40|$|A new {{generation}} of hydraulic mine support prestressing devices has been developed. These thin-walled steel shells are machine-welded and can be inflated with water or any liquid to provide prestressing {{for a wide variety}} of roof support products ranging from Can supports to props and cable bolts. With an expansion capability of several inches, depending on the geometry and size of the unit, they can also establish roof contact eliminating the need for wooden wedges or crib blocks that are commonly employed with several standing roof support products. Capable of withstanding pressures from 1, 000 to 6, 000 psi, these cells are able to transfer roof loading into the support structure without rupturing. A recent development has been the addition of an inexpensive <b>yield</b> <b>valve</b> that provides control of the maximum pressure and load development on the support. This paper examines the performance capabilities of these inflatable prestressing units and the impact they have on the performance of various support systems, including an evaluation of the overall stiffness of the support system and the load control during yielding of the prestressing unit. Recommendations are made regarding the design requirements of the prestressing unit to optimize the support performance. A summary of mine applications using this technology is provided with general comments regarding their impact on ground control...|$|E

40|$|The {{endoscopic}} {{appearance of}} the gastroesophageal valve, viewed by the retroflexed gastroscope, has been studied in 51 patients with and without reflux esophagitis. Esophagitis was graded according to its severity, and the yield pressure (YP) was measured in all patients to assess the competence of the cardia. There was a close relationship between the YP and the grades of the gastroesophageal valve. YP was significantly lower in patients with endoscopic oesophagitis than in patients with no evidence of reflux esophagitis (p < 0. 0001). An increased abnormality of the gastroesophageal valve was associated with all grades of esophagitis and with a low YP.

40|$|We have {{designed}} and built electrostatically actuated microvalves compatible with integration into a PDMS based microfluidic system. The key innovation for electrostatic actuation was the incorporation of carbon nanotubes into the PDMS valve membrane, allowing for electrostatic charging of the PDMS layer and subsequent discharging, while still allowing for significant distention of the valveseat for low voltage control of the system. Nanoparticles were applied to semi-cured PDMS using a stamp transfer method, and then cured fully to make the valve seats.

40|$|Abstract: Microfluidic systems require {{numerous}} {{control valves}} {{in order to}} function properly. These valves form the basic unit of fluid handling within the microfluidic system. Many different valves have been designed and manufactured, both active and passive. The current paper investigates a novel passive valve that works {{on the principle of}} hydrostatic pressure. This normally closed valve can also be used in a toggle valve combination, where only one external actuation source is required to <b>yield</b> two <b>valves</b> that open and close sequentially. The first valve is an active valve, operated pneumatically. The second valve operates purely on the pressure applied by the fluid in the microfluidic channel at the valve entrance. One valve is thus always closed, while the other is open. By changing the valve entrance properties, the valve can be designed to operate at different actuation pressures. The valve mechanism, which consists of four layers of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), was designed and manufactured using the SU- 8 lithography and replication molding processes. It was successfully implemented, and initial results show the relationship between the applied pressure and flow rate. In addition to being used as a toggle valve, this design also allows for the passive valve {{to be used as a}} stand-alone pressure valve and as a one way valve, which would restrict fluid flow to a single direction. This may give rise to the possibility of designing entirely passive microfluidic devices, which would be advantageous from a circuit complexity and energy usage perspective.

40|$|Each year, {{approximately}} 300, 000 {{heart valve}} repair or replacement procedures are performed worldwide, including approximately 70, 000 aortic valve replacement surgeries in the United States alone. This paper describes progress in constructing anatomically and physiologically realistic immersed boundary (IB) {{models of the}} dynamics of the aortic root and ascending aorta. This work builds on earlier IB models of fluid-structure interaction (FSI) in the aortic root, which previously achieved realistic hemodynamics over multiple cardiac cycles, but which also were limited to simplified aortic geometries and idealized descriptions of the biomechanics of the aortic valve cusps. By contrast, the model described herein uses an anatomical geometry reconstructed from patient-specific computed tomography angiography (CTA) data, and employs a description of the elasticity of the aortic valve leaflets based on a fiber-reinforced constitutive model fit to experimental tensile test data. Numerical tests show that the model is able to resolve the leaflet biomechanics in diastole and early systole at practical grid spacings. The model is also used to examine differences in the mechanics and fluid dynamics <b>yielded</b> by fresh <b>valve</b> leaflets and glutaraldehyde-fixed leaflets similar to those used in bioprosthetic heart valves.

These nozzles, designed for an optimum running time of 30 seconds, at a Mach number of 2, 35. Boundary layer growth was considered by displacing the nozzle contours outwards by the equivalent displacement thickness, while keeping the vertical tunnel side walls parallel. The five pitot probe calibration results, taken through the central vertical plane in the tunnel test-section, showed Mach number standard deviations about the mean of 0, 638 % and 1, 004 % for the analytical and semi-graphical design respectively. These results compare ·very favourably {{with those of other}} wind- tunnels. Without pressure recovery the critical flow pressure ratio through the tunnel for Mach 2, 35 nozzles, is 2, 53.

40|$|Abstract—Tissue-engineered {{heart valves}} have been {{proposed}} by physicians and scientists alike {{to be the ultimate}} solution for treating valvular heart disease. Rather than replacing a diseased or defective native valve with a mechanical or animal tissue–derived artificial valve, a tissue-engineered valve would be a living organ, able to respond to growth and physiological forces {{in the same way that}} the native aortic valve does. Two main approaches have been attempted over the past 10 to 15 years: regeneration and repopulation. Regeneration involves the implantation of a resorbable matrix that is expected to remodel in vivo and <b>yield</b> a functional <b>valve</b> composed of the cells and connective tissue proteins of the patient. Repopulation involves implanting a whole porcine aortic valve that has been previously cleaned of all pig cells, leaving an intact, mechanically sound connective tissue matrix. The cells of the patients are expected to repopulate and revitalize the acellular matrix, creating living tissue that already has the complex microstructure necessary for proper function and durability. Regrettably, neither of the 2 approaches has fared well in animal experiments, and the only clinical experience with tissue-engineered valves resulted in a number of early failures and patient death. This article reviews the technological details of the 2 main approaches, their rationale, their strengths and weaknesses, and the likely mechanisms for their failure. Alternative approaches to valvular tissue engineering, as well as the role of industry in shaping this field in the future, are also reviewed. (Circ Res. 2005; 97 : 743 - 755.)

BACKGROUND: The correct management of the small aortic annulus is still controversial. Small aortic prostheses {{can lead to a}} PPM, which results in high gradients with important repercussions on the hemodynamic status. METHODS: Seventy-two patients (mean age: 72. 5 ± 6. 2 years, 73. 6 % women) with a small aortic root (≤ 21 mm intraoperatively measured aortic annulus) had a CLOB valve implanted in the aortic position between November 1993 and July 2001 at our institution. Mean prosthesis size was 22. 0 ± 0. 8 mm. Patients underwent echocardiography preoperatively, at discharge, six months, one year and yearly thereafter. RESULTS: The incidence of PPM at discharge was 22. 2 % (16 / 72); 18. 7 % were severe (effective orifice area index [EOAI] ≤ 0. 65 cm/m 2), 43. 7 % were moderate (EOAI = 0. 66 to 0. 75 cm/m 2) and 37. 6 % were mild (0. 76 to 0. 85 cm/m 2). At multivariable analysis, gender (p < 0. 001), age (p = 0. 015), body surface area (p < 0. 001) and patient's annulus index (p < 0. 001) were significant factors influencing the occurrence of "transient" PPM.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. April 2009. Major: Chemical Engineering. Advisor: Robert T. Tranquillo. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xii, 215 pages, appendices A-C. In the United States alone, over 100, 000 heart valve replacement procedures are performed each year, with approximately 45 % of patients below age 65. While current mechanical and bioprosthetic heart valves are viable options, they have several limitations. The most significant limitation is for pediatric patients, since {{neither of these}} valve types grow and remodel with the patient. Tissue engineering provides a methodology to create functional heart valves that can grow and remodel similar to native tissue once implanted. Several tissue engineering approaches have been proposed using decellularized native scaffolds, synthetic biopolymers, and biological polymers seeded with cells. Fibrin provides a scaffold to create tissue-engineered heart valves (TEHV) that are completely biological with an environment permissive for extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition. Previous research in our lab has demonstrated the feasibility of creating a fibrin-based TEHV with neonatal human dermal fibroblast (nHDF) that <b>yields</b> <b>valve</b> leaflets with structural and mechanical anisotropy similar to native leaflets. However, the TEHV had sub-optimal tensile mechanical properties and was thus unable to withstand physiological forces. The development of tissue can be accelerated by both chemical and mechanical stimulus. Previously, fibrin based TEHV were cultured with chemical stimulus {{in the form of}} growth factors supplemented in the culture medium resulting in improved ECM deposition by the cells; however, no mechanical stimulation was applied. Prior research in both our lab and by other researchers has shown cyclic stretching with constant strain amplitude is a method to stimulate remodeling of biological scaffolds seeded with cells. Initial experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of cyclic stretching on fibrin-based tubular constructs seeded with porcine valve interstitial cells (PVIC) and nHDF. Cyclic stretching with 10 % constant strain amplitude applied for 3 weeks led to modest improvement in tensile properties of the tubular constructs. We hypothesized that long-term cyclic stretching, as was used in this study, could induce cellular adaptation, minimizing the benefits of cyclic stretching. This hypothesis was tested in subsequent experiments using tubular constructs cultured with incremental strain amplitude cyclic stretching, with an average strain of 10 % for 3 weeks. Both PVIC and nHDF seeded constructs exhibited a 2 -fold improvement in ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and collagen density over samples conditioned with constant strain amplitude strteching. To verify that this {{was the result of a}} cellular response, phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) was measured by western blot. At 5 weeks, the phosphorylated ERK was 255 % higher in incremental cyclic strained samples compared to constant strain samples. nHDF-seeded tubular constructs were also used to optimize the use of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β). Studies showed that under cyclic stretching conditions, TGF-β has detrimental effects on total collagen deposition and collagen maturation. Western blot analysis showed a decrease in p-ERK signaling in TGF-β treated samples. However, TGF-β use demonstrated a benefit by increasing the elastin content of the tissue constructs. In subsequent experiments, a sequence of cyclic stretching and TGF-β supplementation was used to optimize tensile mechanical properties and elastin content of the engineered tissue. Based on the results with tubular constructs, a novel bioreactor was designed to apply controlled cyclic stretching to the fibrin-based TEHV. Briefly, the valve was mounted on two plastic end-pieces with elastic latex tube placed around TEHV. Using a reciprocating syringe pump, culture medium was cyclically pumped into the bioreactor. The root distension, which was determined by the stiffer latex was used as a control parameter, and in turn stretched the leaflets. A separate flowloop (connected to the bioreactor end-pieces) was used to control nutrient transport to the TEHV. Using an incremental strain amplitude stretching regime, fibrin-based TEHV were conditioned in the bioreactor for 3 weeks. Cyclically stretched valves (CS valve) had improved tensile properties and collagen deposition compared to statically-cultured valves. The mechanical stiffness (modulus) and anisotropy (measured as ratio of leaflet modulus in circumferential to radial directions) in the leaflets was comparable to native sheep pulmonary valve leaflets. Collagen organization/ maturation also improved in CS valves over statically-cultured valves as observed by picrosirius red staining of tissue crosssections. In addition, the CS valve root could withstand pressures of up to 150 mmHg and its compliance was comparable to that of the sheep pulmonary artery at physiological pressures. To assess in vivo remodeling TEHV were implanted in the pulmonary artery of two sheep for 4. 5 weeks with the pulmonary valve either left intact or rendered incompetent by leaflet excision. Echocardiography immediately after implantation showed functional coapting leaflets, with normal right heart function. It was also performed just prior to explantation, revealing functional leaflets although with moderate regurgitation in both cases and a partial detachment of one leaflet from the root in one case. The explanted leaflets had thickness and tensile properties comparable the implanted leaflets. There was endothelialization on the lumenal surface of the TEHV root. These preliminary results are unprecedented for a TEHV developed from a biological scaffold; however, many issues remain to be surmounted. In further development of the TEHV with a fibrin scaffold, photo-cross linking of the fibrin gel was utilized as a method to stiffen the matrix, thereby inhibiting excessive cell-induced compaction. Preliminary studies with tubular constructs demonstrated reduced compaction of cross-linked fibrin gel during cyclic stretching with no effect on nHDF proliferation or deposited collagen. In addition, a preliminary investigation using blood outgrowth endothelial cells (BOEC) has been conducted to assess their adhesion to the remodeled TEHV surface. Studies showed BOEC adhesion and proliferation on remodeled fibrin surface creating a confluent layer after 4 days of culture. Successful seeding of sheep BOEC on the TEHV surface prior to implantation would reduce the risk of clotting. Overall, the studies presented in this dissertation advance the development of a completely biological tissue-engineered heart valve. These studies improve our understanding of the role of cyclic stretching in tissue remodeling and have furthered the science of mechnotransduction and tissue remodeling...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the ability of a novel cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) real-time phase contrast (RT-PC) flow measurement technique to reveal the discordant respirophasic changes in mitral and tricuspid valve in flow indicative of the abnormal hemodynamics seen in constrictive pericarditis (CP). BackgroundDefinitive diagnosis of CP requires identification of constrictive hemodynamics with or without pericardial thickening. CMR to date has primarily provided morphological assessment of the pericardium. MethodsSixteen patients (age 57 ± 13 years) undergoing CMR to assess known or suspected CP and 10 controls underwent RT-PC that acquired simultaneous mitral valve and tricuspid valve inflow velocities over 10 s of unrestricted breathing. The diagnosis of CP was confirmed via clinical history, diagnostic imaging, cardiac catheterization, intraoperative findings, and histopathology. ResultsTen patients had CP, all with increased pericardial thickness (6. 2 ± 1. 0 mm). RT-PC imaging demonstrated discordant respirophasic changes in atrioventricular valve inflow velocities in all CP patients, with mean ± SD mitral valve and tricuspid valve inflow velocity variation of 46 ± 20 % and 60 ± 15 %, respectively, compared with 16 ± 8 % and 24 ± 11 % in patients without CP (p 0. 3 for both). Respiratory variation exceeding 25 % across the mitral <b>valve</b> <b>yielded</b> a sensitivity of 100 %, a specificity of 100 %, and an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 1. 0 to detect CP physiology. Using a cutoff of 45 %, variation of transtricuspid valve velocity had a sensitivity of 90 %, a specificity of 88 %, and an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0. 98. ConclusionsAccentuated and discordant respirophasic changes in mitral valve and tricuspid valve inflow velocities characteristic of CP can be identified noninvasively with RT-PC CMR. When incorporated into existing CMR protocols for imaging pericardial morphology, RT-PC CMR provides important hemodynamic evidence with which to make a definite diagnosis of CP...|$|R
40|$|Mechanical {{heart valves}} {{implanted}} in mitral position {{have a great}} effect on the ventricular flow. Changes include alteration {{of the dynamics of}} the vortical structures generated during the diastole and the onset of turbulence, possibly affecting the efficiency of the heart pump or causing blood cell damage. Modifications to the hemodynamics in the left ventricle, when the inflow through the mitral orifice is altered, were investigated in vitro using a silicone rubber, flexible ventricle model. Velocity fields were measured in space and time by means of an image analysis technique: feature tracking. Three series of experiments were performed: one with a top hat inflow velocity profile (schematically resembling physiological conditions), and two with mechanical prosthetic valves of different design, mounted in mitral position-one monoleaflet and the other bileaflet. In each series of runs, two different cardiac outputs have been examined by changing the stroke volume. The flow was investigated in terms of phase averaged velocity field and second order moments of turbulent fluctuations. Results show that the modifications in the transmitral flow change deeply the interaction between the coherent structures generated during {{the first phase of the}} diastole and the incoming jet during the second diastolic phase. Top hat inflow gives the coherent structures which are optimal, among the compared cases, for the systolic function. The flow generated by the bileaflet valve preserves most of the beneficial features of the top hat inflow, whereas the monoleaflet valve generates a strong jet which discourages the permanence of large coherent structures at the end of the diastole. Moreover, the average shear rate magnitudes induced by the smoother flow pattern of the case of top hat inflow are nearly halved in comparison with the values measured with the mechanical valves. Finally, analysis of the turbulence statistics shows that the monoleaflet <b>valves</b> <b>yield</b> higher turbulence intensity in comparison with the bileaflet and, with top hat inflow, there is not a complete transition to turbulence...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} growing {{interest}} in environmental forms of trace evidence, and ecological trace evidence collected from footwear has proved valuable within casework. Simultaneously, there has been growing awareness of the need for empirical experimentation to underpin forensic inferences. Diatoms are unicellular algae, and each cell (or ‘frustule’) consists of two valves which are made of silica, a robust material that favours their preservation both in sediments and within forensic scenarios. A series of experiments were carried out to investigate the transfer and persistence of diatoms upon common footwear materials, a recipient surface that has historically been overlooked by studies of persistence. The effectiveness of two novel extraction techniques (jet rinsing, and heating and agitation with distilled water) was compared to the established extraction technique of hydrogen peroxide digestion, for a suite of five common footwear materials: canvas, leather, and ‘suede’ (representing upper materials), and rubber and polyurethane (representing sole materials). It was observed that the novel extraction technique of heating and agitation with distilled water did not extract fewer diatom valves, or cause increased fragmentation of valves, when compared to peroxide digestion, suggesting that the method may be viable where potentially hazardous chemical reactions may be encountered with the peroxide digestion method. Valves could be extracted from all five footwear materials after 3 min of immersion, and more valves were extracted from the rougher, woven upper materials than the smoother sole materials. Canvas <b>yielded</b> the most <b>valves</b> (a mean of 2511 /cm 2) and polyurethane the fewest (a mean of 15 /cm 2). The persistence of diatoms on the three upper materials was addressed with a preliminary pilot investigation, with ten intervals sampled between 0 and 168 h. Valves were seen to persist in detectable quantities after 168 h on all three upper materials. However, some samples produced slides with no valves, and the earliest time after which no diatom valves were found was 4 h after the transfer. Analysis of the particle size distributions over time, by image analysis, suggests that the retention of diatoms may be size-selective; after 168 h, no particles larger than 200 μm 2 could be found on the samples of canvas, and > 95...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to explore the complex fluid flow phenomena that result in the generation of a high frequency noise in counterbalance valves through an experimental and numerical investigation of the flow. Once the influence of the different components involved in noise generation is established, a secondary objective is the introduction of design modifications that eliminate the undesired effect without altering the operation envelope or the performance of the valve. A hydraulic test bench was used to carry out an experimental investigation of the noise generation process. A computer based data acquisition system was used to record pressure fluctuations, flowrates and hydraulic oil temperatures in a production valve under a variety of operational conditions. Extensive experimental measurements and numerical modeling lead to the hypothesis that noise generation is the result of an acoustic resonance triggered by shear layer instability at the valve inlet. The pressure gradients developed when the shear layer entrains the stagnant fluid in the valve main cavity cause the layer to become unstable and oscillate. The oscillation frequency will depend on a great number of factors such as valve geometry, pressure and velocity gradients and the density and viscosity of the fluid. It is postulated that the observed noise is generated when this frequency matches one of the resonant frequencies of the valve cavity. The proposed mechanism is theoretically poorly understood and well beyond simplified analysis, its accurate numerical simulation is computational very intensive requiring sophisticated CFD codes. The numerical investigation was carried out using STAR–CCM+, a commercially available CFD code featuring 3 -D capabilities and sophisticated turbulence modeling. Streamline, pressure, velocity-vector and velocity-scalar plots were obtained for several valve configurations using steady and unsteady state flow simulations. An experimental and numerical analysis of an alternative valve geometry was carried out. Experimental results demonstrated a greatly reduced instability range. The numerical analysis of the unsteady behavior of the shear-layer streamlines for both <b>valves</b> <b>yielded</b> results that were compatible with the experimental work.

My thanks are due to the Michigan Board of Fish Commissioners for the many conveniences placed at my disposal in carrying out the investigations on fish parasites, of which this is one result. To Professor J. E. Reighard, director of the party, I owe much for his interest and hearty cooperation in all matters pertaining to this work. In the first dog-fish (Amia calva L.) examined (August 2) the intestine just above the spiral <b>valve</b> <b>yielded</b> a large number (354) of specimens of a small Distoma, which is about {{the size and shape of}} a mustard seed. It seemed on examination to be a new species, and later study strengthened this opinion. My attention was, however, more particularly directed to it when ten days later I examined a specimen of the same fish which had been brought from Saint Clair Flats, opposite our laboratory. The number of this Distoma present was so great as to cover completely the wall of the intestine. They were removed by a pipette to a dish of normal salt solution (0. 75 per cent.) and, after examination, preserved in a saturated solution of corrosive sublimate, in Kleinenberg 2 ̆ 7 s picrosulphuric acid, and in Flemming 2 ̆ 7 s chrom-osmo-acetic acid, about one-third in each. One of these lots counted later showed 1, 023 individuals present. The fish just mentioned had enjoyed a meal of Cambarus propinquus, 26 of which were still easily recognizable in his stomach. I noticed at once in the crayfish, which had the cephalo-thorax crushed and in most cases its dorsal portion gone, a large number of small cysts, while around these cysts were occasional free Distomes, and in the stomach were to be found both cysts and free Distomes, whose identity with those in the crayfish and with the specimens from the intestine was afterwards established beyond a doubt. These results were communicated to the Society in a paper which was, however, read by title only. During the latter part of August the work of examining the fish for parasites was entrusted to Mr. Dwight Lydell, an experienced and careful assistant of the Fish Commission, and from his record of two specimens of Amia examined August 31, I take the following: “One with tapeworms was feeding on small fish, the other on crawfish. ” The parasites from 2 ̆ 2 the other 2 ̆ 2 were this Distoma, both free and enclosed in cysts, so that the source of the infection seemed clear...|$|R
