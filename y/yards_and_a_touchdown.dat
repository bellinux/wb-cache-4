5|$|Mississippi's Steve Hindman {{was named}} the game's most {{valuable}} player after he rushed the ball for 121 <b>yards</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>touchdown</b> in addition to catching three passes for 32 yards. Ole Miss quarterback Archie Manning finished the game with 141 passing yards and two touchdowns. Virginia Tech was led on offense by Ken Edwards, who finished with 119 rushing <b>yards</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>touchdown,</b> and Terry Smoot, who finished with 91 rushing <b>yards</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>touchdown.</b> Tech turned the ball over five times, committing three fumbles and throwing two interceptions to the Mississippi defense.

Both marks remain Liberty Bowl records for the fewest passes and fewest passing yards gained by a team.|$|E
