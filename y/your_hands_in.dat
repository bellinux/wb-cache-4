500|$|When {{the prime}} {{minister}} asked Manekshaw to go to Dhaka and accept the surrender of Pakistani forces, he declined, saying that the honour {{should go to the}} Indian Army Commander in the East, Lieutenant General Jagjit Singh Aurora. Concerned about maintaining discipline {{in the aftermath of the}} conflict, Manekshaw issued strict instructions forbidding looting and rape. He stressed the need to respect and stay away from women wherever he went. As a result, according to Singh, cases of looting and rape were negligible. In addressing his troops on the matter, Manekshaw was quoted as saying: [...] "When you see a Begum (Muslim woman), keep <b>your</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> your pockets, and think of Sam." ...|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Team" [...] is a [...] "tribute to {{her friends}} and country". During an {{interview}} with Billboard, Lorde described the song as [...] "her take on most modern music" [...] and explained, [...] "no one comes to New Zealand, no one knows anything about New Zealand, and here I am, trying {{to grow up and}} become a person." [...] Lorde explained that the line [...] "We live in cities you'll never see on screen" [...] was [...] "to be speaking for the minority" [...] from small cities. She also expresses distaste in common contemporary popular music lyrics telling listeners to [...] "put <b>your</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> the air" [...] through the verse [...] "I'm kind of over getting told to throw my hands up in the air". Writer Lily Rothman for the magazine Time commented that the lyrics [...] "we sure know how to run things" [...] in [...] "Team" [...] were a response to the lyrics [...] "we run things, things don’t run we" [...] in Miley Cyrus' [...] "We Can't Stop" [...] (2013).|$|E

2500|$|Alison Goldfrapp {{explained}} that the upbeat nature of the album was inspired by her desire to create something [...] "a little bit like Supernature, but that had a warmer sound—maybe not as hard." [...] Describing their previous album Seventh Tree as an [...] "intimate, dreamy, more introspective album" [...] which was created in response to deep unhappiness with her personal life following the tiring Supernature tour, Head First was a reaction to wanting [...] "to get out the synths again, put <b>your</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> the air" [...] and [...] "set about making an 'up' album." ...|$|E

2500|$|Davidson {{joined the}} Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) in 1934 after meeting J.S. Woodsworth. She remarked about him, [...] "He had a burning fire {{of love for}} people. You could warm <b>your</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> his personality." [...] She worked for Agnes MacPhail and Arthur Williams on their {{election}} campaigns in the 1930s. She ran for the CCF in the 1953 federal election in the riding of York East coming third behind Robert McGregor. She also ran provincially in the 1955 Ontario election against Hollis Beckett, again with a poor showing. In 1971 she recalled this period of involvement with the CCF. She said, [...] "I'm not a partisan politician at all... I ran for the CCF 15 or 16 {{years ago when the}} CCF had fallen on very stony places. I don't know why I ran. I had no thought of winning." ...|$|E
2500|$|For Kierkegaard, true {{individuality}} {{is called}} selfhood. Becoming {{aware of our}} true self is our true task and endeavor in life—it is an ethical imperative, as well as preparatory to a true religious understanding. Individuals can exist {{at a level that}} is less than true selfhood. We can live, for example, simply in terms of our pleasures—our immediate satisfaction of desires, propensities, or distractions. In this way, we glide through life without direction or purpose. To have a direction, we must have a purpose that defines for us the meaning of our lives. Kierkegaard puts it this way in Either/Or, Here, then, I have your view of life, and, believe me, much of your life will become clear to you if you will consider it along with me as thought-despair. You are a hater of activity in life-quite appropriately, because {{if there is to be}} meaning in it life must have continuity, and this your life does not have. You keep busy with your studies, to be sure; you are even diligent; but it is only for your sake, and it is done with as little teleology as possible. Moreover, you are unoccupied; like the laborers in the Gospel standing idle in the marketplace, you stick <b>your</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> your pocket and contemplate life. Now you rest in despair. Nothing concerns you; you step aside for nothing; “If someone threw a roof tile down I would still not step aside.” You are like a dying person. You die daily, not in the profound, earnest sense in which one usually understands these words, but life has lost its reality and you “Always count the days of your life from one termination-notice to the next.” You let everything pass you by; nothing makes any impact. But then something suddenly comes along that grips you, an idea, a situation, a young girl’s smile, and now you are “involved,” for just on certain occasions you are not “involved,” so at other times you are “at your service” in every way. Wherever there is something going on you join in. You behave in life as you usually do in a crowd. “You work yourself into the tightest group, see to it, if possible, to get yourself shoved up over the others so that you come to be above them, and as soon as you are up there you make yourself as comfortable as possible, and in this way you let yourself be carried through life.” But when the crowd is gone, when the event is over, you again stand on the street corner and look at the world.
