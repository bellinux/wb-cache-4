It also {{becomes clear that}} the two girls are related—identical twins, born seven <b>years</b> <b>apart.</b> The girls are clones, produced using a technique {{similar to that used}} to create identical cattle. Black believes that this is connected to Hoffman's Earth Changes theory, that someone is breeding offspring destined to survive May 5, 2000.|$|E
5|$|Filmed in India, Mauritius, and Scotland, {{this was}} Karan Johar's directorial debut. One of his {{goals for the}} film was to set a new level for style in Hindi cinema.

5|$|The {{pattern of}} 105.5, 8, 121.5 and 8 years {{is not the}} only pattern that is {{possible}} within the 243-year cycle, because of the slight mismatch between the times when the Earth and Venus arrive at the point of conjunction. Prior to 1518, the pattern of transits was 8, 113.5 and 121.5 years, and the eight inter-transit gaps before the AD 546 transit were 121.5 <b>years</b> <b>apart.</b> The current pattern will continue until 2846, when it will be replaced by a pattern of 105.5, 129.5 and 8 years. Thus, the 243-year cycle is relatively stable, but the number of transits and their timing within the cycle will vary over time. Since the 243:395 Earth:Venus commensurability is only approximate, there are different sequences of transits occurring 243 <b>years</b> <b>apart,</b> each extending for several thousand years, which are eventually replaced by other sequences. For instance, there is a series which ended in 541 BC, and the series which includes 2117 only started in AD 1631.|$|E

5|$|Transits of Venus {{are among}} the rarest of {{predictable}} astronomical phenomena. They occur in a pattern that generally repeats every 243 years, with pairs of transits eight <b>years</b> <b>apart</b> separated by long gaps of 121.5 years and 105.5 years. The periodicity {{is a reflection of}} the fact that the orbital periods of Earth and Venus are close to 8:13 and 243:395 commensurabilities.|$|E

After many <b>years</b> <b>apart,</b> the band finally united at a gig at the Royal Festival Hall and a short tour in 2005. Since then, the band has continued as a trio of Hammill, Banton, and Evans, who record and tour regularly in between Hammill's concurrent solo career.|$|E

5|$|The Australian pelican has two {{reproductive}} strategies {{depending on}} the local degree of environmental predictability. Colonies of tens or hundreds, rarely thousands, of birds breed regularly on small coastal and subcoastal islands where food is seasonally or permanently available. In arid inland Australia, especially in the endorheic Lake Eyre basin, pelicans will breed opportunistically in very large numbers of up to 50,000 pairs, when irregular major floods, which may be many <b>years</b> <b>apart,</b> fill ephemeral salt lakes and provide large amounts of food for several months before drying out again.|$|E
5|$|The Theban plays {{consist of}} three plays: Oedipus Rex (also called Oedipus Tyrannus or Oedipus the King), Oedipus at Colonus and Antigone. All three plays concern {{the fate of}} Thebes {{during and after the}} reign of King Oedipus. They have often been {{published}} under a single cover. Sophocles, however, wrote the three plays for separate festival competitions, many <b>years</b> <b>apart.</b> Not only are the Theban plays not a true trilogy (three plays presented as a continuous narrative) but they are not even an intentional series and contain some inconsistencies among them. He also wrote other plays having to do with Thebes, such as the Epigoni, of which only fragments have survived.|$|E
5|$|The {{collision}} of Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 with Jupiter in 1994 demonstrated that gravitational interactions can fragment a comet, {{giving rise to}} many impacts {{over a period of}} a few days if the comet should collide with a planet. Comets undergo gravitational interactions with the gas giants, and similar disruptions and collisions are very likely to have occurred in the past. This scenario may have occurred on Earth {{at the end of the}} Cretaceous, though Shiva and the Chicxulub craters might have been formed 300,000 <b>years</b> <b>apart.</b>|$|E

5|$|NASA {{maintains}} {{a catalog of}} Venus transits covering the period 2000 BCE to 4000 CE. Currently, transits occur only in June or December (see table) and the occurrence of these events slowly drifts, becoming {{later in the year}} by about two days every 243-year cycle. Transits usually occur in pairs, on nearly the same date eight <b>years</b> <b>apart.</b> This is because the length of eight Earth years is almost the same as 13 years on Venus, so every eight years the planets are in roughly the same relative positions. This approximate conjunction usually results in a pair of transits, but it is not precise enough to produce a triplet, since Venus arrives 22 hours earlier each time. The last transit not {{to be part of a}} pair was in 1396. The next will be in 3089; in 2854 (the second of the 2846/2854 pair), although Venus will just miss the Sun as seen from the Earth's equator, a partial transit will be visible from some parts of the southern hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the Canucks' final {{home game}} of the season a week later, Sedin was awarded the Cyclone Taylor Award as the team's most {{valuable}} player (MVP) and his third Cyrus H. McLean Award as the team's leading point-scorer. Finishing the campaign with a career-high 41 goals, 63 assists and 104 points, he won the Art Ross Trophy as the NHL's leading point-scorer. It marked the first time in NHL history that brothers led the League in scoring in back-to-back seasons, as Henrik had won the previous year. Chicago Blackhawks forwards Doug and Max Bentley also won separate scoring titles, but had achieved the feat three <b>years</b> <b>apart</b> in 1943 and 1946, respectively. He also received the Viking Award as the NHL's best Swedish player, following after Henrik who received it the year before.|$|E

5|$|The 11-century temple-building boom {{continued}} in the 12th century {{with the addition of}} new features. The Mahadeva Temple at Itagi and the Siddhesvara Temple in Haveri are standard constructions incorporating these developments. Based on the general plan of the Amrtesvara Temple at Annigeri, the Mahadeva Temple was built in 1112 CE and has the same architectural components as its predecessor. There are however differences in their articulation; the sala roof (roof under the finial of the superstructure) and the miniature towers on pilasters are chiseled instead of moulded. The difference between the two temples, built fifty <b>years</b> <b>apart,</b> is the more rigid modelling and decoration found in many components of the Mahadeva Temple. The voluptuous carvings of the 11th century were replaced with a more severe chiselling.|$|E
5|$|The {{solutions}} for R(t) depend on k and Λ, but some qualitative features of such solutions are general. First and most importantly, the length scale R of the Universe can remain constant {{only if the}} Universe is perfectly isotropic with positive curvature (k=1) and has one precise value of density everywhere, as first noted by Albert Einstein. However, this equilibrium is unstable: because the Universe {{is known to be}} inhomogeneous on smaller scales, R must change over time. When R changes, all the spatial distances in the Universe change in tandem; there is an overall expansion or contraction of space itself. This accounts for the observation that galaxies appear to be flying apart; the space between them is stretching. The stretching of space also accounts for the apparent paradox that two galaxies can be 40 billion light <b>years</b> <b>apart,</b> although they started from the same point 13.8 billion years ago and never moved faster than the speed of light.|$|E
5|$|A {{player has}} taken two hat-tricks {{in the same}} Test match only once. Playing for Australia against South Africa in the first match of the 1912 Triangular Tournament at Old Trafford, Manchester, England, leg spinner Jimmy Matthews took a hat-trick in South Africa's first and second innings, both taken on 28 May 1912. He {{completed}} both hat-tricks by dismissing South Africa's Tommy Ward. Only three other cricketers have taken more than one Test hat-trick: Australian off spinner Hugh Trumble (two <b>years</b> <b>apart,</b> between the same teams at the same ground), Pakistani fast bowler Wasim Akram (just over a week apart, in consecutive matches between the same teams) and English fast bowler Stuart Broad. Three players have taken a hat-trick on their Test debut: English medium pace bowler Maurice Allom in 1930, New Zealand off-spinner Peter Petherick in 1976, and Australian pace bowler Damien Fleming in 1994. Geoff Griffin took the fewest total Test wickets of any player who recorded a hat-trick, taking only eight wickets in his entire Test career. During the match in which he took his hat-trick, Griffin was repeatedly called for throwing by the umpires and never bowled again in a Test match. Australian Peter Siddle is the only bowler to take a hat-trick on his birthday, and Bangladeshi off spinner Sohag Gazi is the only player to score a century and take a hat-trick in the same Test match.|$|E

5|$|The first {{recorded}} observation of a transit of Venus {{was made by}} Jeremiah Horrocks from his home at Carr House in Much Hoole, near Preston in England, on 4 December 1639 (24 November under the Julian calendar then in use in England). His friend, William Crabtree, also observed this transit from Broughton, near Manchester. Kepler had predicted transits in 1631 and 1761 and a near miss in 1639. Horrocks corrected Kepler's calculation for the orbit of Venus, realized that transits of Venus would occur in pairs 8 <b>years</b> <b>apart,</b> and so predicted the transit of 1639. Although he was uncertain of the exact time, he calculated that the transit was to begin at approximately 15:00. Horrocks focused {{the image of the}} Sun through a simple telescope onto a piece of paper, where the image could be safely observed. After observing for most of the day, he was lucky to see the transit as clouds obscuring the Sun cleared at about 15:15, just half an hour before sunset. Horrocks's observations allowed him to make a well-informed guess as to the size of Venus, as well as to make an estimate of the mean distance between the Earth and the Sun— the astronomical unit. He estimated that distance to be 59.4millionmiles (95.6Gm, 0.639AU)– about two thirds of the actual distance of 93millionmiles (149.6 million km), but a more accurate figure than any suggested up to that time. The observations were not published until 1661, well after Horrocks's death.|$|E
