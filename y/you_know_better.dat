500|$|Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish {{was adamant}} that his players would improve {{following}} the defeat: [...] "They've been in two cup finals {{in this season}} – they'll have enjoyed the first one more than the second, the lads {{will benefit from the}} experience. You can't give a team like Chelsea a two-goal head start." [...] When asked about his future as manager of the club Dalglish stated: [...] "We'll assess the season {{at the end of the}} season." [...] Captain Steven Gerrard echoed Dalglish's sentiments: [...] "With the players we have in that dressing room, we could have done better. But we are Liverpool. We will bounce back. We will strengthen in the summer and come back fighting again. That's what Liverpool Football Club does." [...] Striker Andy Carroll, who scored one goal and had another disallowed, thought the ball had crossed the line: [...] "I thought it was over the line and <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>better</b> than me but I thought it was. I thought it hit the other side of the bar but I haven't seen it back." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Amor Puro" [...] (Pure Love) is {{in a minor}} key with romantic lyrics, {{a string}} {{ensemble}} and techno synthesizers. Its lyrics focus {{on the meaning of}} true love. Queen sings: [...] "Pure love does not fight, it does not hurt you, love that is pure does not cause you to fall", and described the song as [...] "an honest statement of what love is". [...] "I Do" [...] is a minor-key, mid-tempo pop and R power ballad built on a handclapped rhythm and piano. Lyrically, the song is a message to men and women; Queen sings: [...] "My ladies, if <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>better,</b> if he loves you, let him come back. My fellas, if you love her, don't let nothing hold you back, run out and look for her". Queen recorded the song in English because she felt the language worked well with the beat. According to an editor for iTunes, the song [...] "puts her message of female empowerment into a glossy pop ballad, complete with English lyrics and Auto-Tuned vocal." [...] The minor-key [...] "Acércate" [...] (Get Closer) features vocals by Wisin & Yandel and synthesizers; it has been described as [...] "pure reggaeton". The song was praised for the presence of Wisin & Yandel and its hook. Queen previously collaborated with Wisin & Yandel on their seventh studio album, La Revolución (2009), with [...] "Perfecto" [...] (which also featured Yaviah).|$|E

In addition to Ruddock witnessing Ueshiba first hand {{on a couple of}} hundred occasions, he took extra private lessons, firstly from Kobayashi and then Ichihashi. In his memoir Ruddock recalled Ueshiba intervening when Ichihashi became overly zealous in his throws but also fondly remembered many aspects of the latters instruction and in particular advice Ichihashi provided {{as he was about to}} return to Ireland: [...] " [...] Remember, all these things like bowing and sitting in seiza are Japanese – not Aikido. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>better</b> than we do how to teach foreigners. When you go back home, respect the ways of your country, remember to teach Aikido your way." ...|$|E

2500|$|No, we do {{not love}} humanity; {{but on the other}} hand we are not nearly [...] "German" [...] enough, in the sense in which the word [...] "German" [...] is {{constantly}} being used nowadays, to advocate nationalism and race hatred and to be able to take pleasure in the national scabies of the heart and blood poisoning that now leads the nations of Europe to delimit and barricade themselves against each other as if it were a matter of quarantine. For that we are too open-minded, too malicious, too spoiled, also too well-informed, too [...] "traveled": we far prefer to live on mountains, apart, [...] "untimely," [...] in past or future centuries, merely in order to keep ourselves from experiencing the silent rage to which we know we should be condemned as eyewitnesses of politics that are desolating the German spirit by making it vain and that is, moreover, petty politics:—to keep its own creation from immediately falling apart again, is it not finding it necessary to plant it between two deadly hatreds? must it not desire the eternalization of the European system of a lot of petty states? ... We who are homeless are too manifold and mixed racially and in our descent, being [...] "modern men," [...] and consequently do not feel tempted to participate in the mendacious racial self-admiration and racial indecency that parades in Germany today as a sign of a German way of thinking and that is doubly false and obscene among the people of the [...] "historical sense." [...] We are, in one word—and let this be our word of honor!— good Europeans, the heirs of Europe, the rich, oversupplied, but also overly obligated heirs of thousands of years of European spirit: as such, we have also outgrown Christianity and are averse to it, and precisely because we have grown out of it, because our ancestors were Christians who in their Christianity were uncompromisingly upright; for their faith they willingly sacrificed possessions and position, blood and fatherland. We—do the same. For what? For our unbelief? For every kind of unbelief? No, <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>better</b> than that, my friends! The hidden Yes in you is stronger than all Nos and Maybes that afflict you and your age like a disease; and when you have to embark on the sea, you emigrants, you, too, are compelled to this by— a faith! ...|$|E
