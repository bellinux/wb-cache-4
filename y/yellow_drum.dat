50|$|After work, {{the pair}} spy {{on a woman}} living across {{the street with a}} telescope; they {{discover}} that she is being mistreated by a man who is with her. Determined to right the wrong, Carl shoots the man in the rear with a pellet gun. He and James both hide and laugh. Moments later, the man - a city councilman named Jack Berger (Darrell Larson), who's running for mayor - is strangled and ends up found the next day by Carl and James in a <b>yellow</b> <b>drum.</b> They decide that turning in the body would implicate themselves, as they had shot him earlier.|$|E
40|$|A {{feeding trial}} was {{conducted}} to determine the dietary lipid requirement {{and its effects on}} body composition, plasma biochemical parameters and liver fatty acids content in juvenile <b>yellow</b> <b>drum</b> Nibea albiflora. Six animal groups (initial weights, 17. 7  ±  0. 20  g) were fed isonitrogenous diets formulated with increasing lipid levels (52, 70, 94, 111, 129 and 153  g kg− 1, labeled as L 50, L 70, L 90, L 110, L 130, L 150, respectively) using menhaden oil, twice daily to apparent satiation, for 8 weeks. The results showed that the weight gain and specific growth rate (SGR) of fish fed L 130 and L 150 lipid diets were significantly higher than those of the animals on the L 50 lipid diet. The feed conversion rate (FCR) of fish fed the L 130 lipid diet was significantly lower compared with the values obtained for the other groups. Hepatosomatic index (HSI) of fish fed the L 90 lipid diet was significantly higher than that of animals on L 150 lipid. Whole body and muscle lipid contents increased with increasing dietary lipid level, and the dietary fatty acid profile was reflected in liver tissue. Liver eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) contents in fish fed with the L 150 diet were significantly higher compared with the values recorded in the other groups. Total highly-unsaturated fatty acid (HUFA) content in liver showed an increasing trend, whereas total saturated fatty acid (SFA) and mono-unsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) contents in liver tended to decrease with increasing dietary lipid levels. The plasma triglyceride and cholesterol contents of juvenile N. albiflora increased with the increasing dietary lipid level. Analysis by the broken-line model of percent weight gain indicated the optimal dietary lipid level in juvenile N. albiflora to be 120  g kg− 1 of the diet...|$|E

500|$|He {{was wearing}} a pink t-shirt, {{stonewashed}} jeans, he had a mullet haircut, and he was driving a 280Z, and had <b>yellow</b> <b>drums.</b> We were sort of looking {{each other in the}} eye thinking, 'This ain't gonna happen, this is not the guy.' [...] he'd learned all our songs, as only Jimmy can, off the top of his head, and, within one practice, we were ready to play. It was amazing. We just knew right away. He's that good.|$|R

[...] "Object" [...] points are installed {{on the face of}} the dam (look closely you can see the <b>yellow</b> <b>drums).</b> Surveyors use devices such as theodolites and total stations to compare changes in distance and elevation of the object points on the dam to the reference points. The information gathered gives dam operators a picture of how the dam is settling or if motion of the face is occurring.|$|R

50|$|Jon Hyde was {{the singer}} {{for the early}} 1970s group Hokus Pokus, who had one album on Romar Records in the early 1970s, {{featuring}} former Stooges keyboard player Scott Thurston, former <b>Yellow</b> Payges <b>drummer</b> Danny Gorman and former Steppenwolf guitarist Michael Monarch and bass Billy Cioffi. They played the Hollywood clubs quite a bit at that time, and were regular patrons of Rodney Bingenheimer's club on Sunset. Jon and Michael Monarch later formed Detective with Michael Des Barres from Silverhead and signed with Led Zeppelin's Swan Song Records. Jon was the drummer for Detective but wrote most of the lyrics and material, as he was a lead singer himself. He did the drumming on the Hokus Pokus album as well.|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{prevalence of}} literature which pushes {{the boundaries of}} national literatures as {{as well as the}} difficulty that the methodology of comparative literature has with negotiating texts without a clear-cut national provenance has led to the increasing interest in reviving the term “world literature. ” While most of the current theories of world literature are concerned with the migration of texts or authors unidirectionally, from the periphery to the center, this study is interested in tracing the migration of authors and texts along their itineraries. The benefit of this model is the way that it allows multidirectional movement, texts and authors move back and forth between countries, languages, and literatures in ways that current models of both comparative literature and world literature do not account for. The itineraries of the three writers and their texts also reveal the ways that the geopolitics of the time influenced literary movement: writers moved south to avoid Japanese conquest in the 1930 s and 1940 s and moved westward to the United States in the 1950 s. Xiao Hong’s itinerary takes her ever southward, through the shifting map of the Republic of China at the time. While she is most commonly identified as a Northeastern writer, Xiao Hong wrote most of her most famous works in exile in Shanghai. Her works must be understood in light of her self-imposed exile. Zhang Ailing’s itinerary took her to the British colony of Hong Kong as a young woman. After returning to Shanghai, she earned literary fame writing tales of exotic colonial life for a Shanghai audience. After the establishment of the People’s Republic of China, Zhang returned to Hong Kong briefly before immigrating to the United States. She had hopes for an Anglophone career, introducing American audiences to China, but remained ultimately unsuccessful in retooling herself. Nevertheless, Zhang found lasting fame among Sinophone audiences in Hong Kong and Taiwan, styling herself as “the last aristocrat” of lost Shanghai. Lao She had a wide and varied itinerary, however one portion which remains relatively understudied is his sojourn in the United States shortly after the end of World War II. While there, Lao She played an active role in shaping his Anglophone career following the success of Evan King’s translation of Camel Xiangzi (Luotuo Xiangzi) as Rickshaw Boy. Lao She collaborated in the translation of three of his other novels into Chinese, The <b>Yellow</b> Storm, The <b>Drum</b> Singers, and The Loves of Lau Lee. Eventually Lao She grew disillusioned with American publishing and returned to China, taking with him several unpublished manuscripts which were later lost. The Chinese translator Ma Xiaomi, later translated the English translations of these manuscripts and restored them to the original Chinese manuscripts. In charting the circulation of writers and texts along their itineraries, it is possible to see the way in which different writers of different languages and literatures intersect. Rather than looking at the movement of Chinese literature into the canon, I look at the globalized connections which have occurred through travel, collaboration, and contestation in several different languages and literatures...|$|R
