On 7 November she posted a seven-page letter filled with praise and flattery:Your soul embraces centuries, Monsieur; its {{philosophical}} concepts {{appear to be the}} fruit of long study matured by time; yet I am told that you are still young. I would like to know you, but feel that I have no need to do so. I know you through my own spiritual instinct; I picture you in my own way and feel that were I to set eyes upon you I should exclaim, 'That is he!' Your outward semblance probably does not reveal your brilliant imagination; you have to be moved, the sacred fire of genius has to be lit, if you are to show yourself as you really are, and <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>what</b> I feel you to be—a man superior in his knowledge of the human heart.|$|E

25|$|The {{script was}} {{developed}} by recording songs beforehand; much of the songs in the play were previously recorded for other albums, including Zoot Allures, Tinseltown Rebellion, <b>You</b> <b>Are</b> <b>What</b> You Is and Ship Arriving Too Late To Save A Drowning Witch. New vocals were combined with previously released tracks and new Synclavier music. In addition to the new songs, the previously recorded songs include new overdubs moving this storyline forward. As the recording process continued, Zappa brought in revised scripts and improved the work by editing or changing aspects with which he was dissatisfied.|$|E

500|$|Harrison wrote [...] "Savoy Truffle" [...] as {{a tribute}} to Clapton's {{chocolate}} addiction. He derived the title and much of the lyrics from a box of Mackintosh's Good News chocolates, which Clapton began eating during one of his visits to Harrison's home. Many of the confectionery names used in the song are authentic; others, such as cherry cream, coconut fudge and pineapple heart, were Harrison's invention, based on the flavours listed inside the lid of the box. For the lyrics to the second of the song's middle eight sections, Harrison received assistance from Derek Taylor, the press officer for the Beatles' new record label, Apple Records. In keeping with the theme of Harrison's composition, Taylor drew inspiration from the title of the American counterculture film <b>You</b> <b>Are</b> <b>What</b> You Eat, which was itself titled after a fashionable macrobiotic slogan.|$|E
500|$|Originally, [...] "Castle Walls" [...] {{belonged to}} Diddy, who had {{commissioned}} the song for his fifth album Last Train to Paris with his group Dirty Money. But Diddy told T.I., [...] "Yeah, {{this is my}} record, but you know what, I {{think this is a}} better fit for you. I think you should rock out on this one. I think this speaks volumes to where <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> <b>what</b> you going through, what you living and how you feel." [...] Consequently, Christina Aguilera was chosen as the featured guest on the song, which appeared on T.I.'s album No Mercy. Alex da Kid, producer of the song, said about the collaboration, [...] "I love it. I think it's amazing. It's my sound, just kind of an evolution of that. I think it'll cater to a lot of different people." [...] T.I. told RapFix Live about the track's inspiration: ...|$|E
500|$|The {{same year}} the double album <b>You</b> <b>Are</b> <b>What</b> You Is was released. Most {{of it was}} {{recorded}} in Zappa's brand new Utility Muffin Research Kitchen (UMRK) studios, which were located at his house, thereby giving him complete freedom in his work. The album included one complex instrumental, [...] "Theme from the 3rd Movement of Sinister Footwear", but focused mainly on rock songs with Zappa's sardonic social commentary—satirical lyrics targeted at teenagers, the media, and religious and political hypocrisy. [...] "Dumb All Over" [...] is a tirade on religion, as is [...] "Heavenly Bank Account", wherein Zappa rails against TV evangelists such as Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson for their purported influence on the U.S. administration {{as well as their}} use of religion as a means of raising money. Songs like [...] "Society Pages" [...] and [...] "I'm a Beautiful Guy" [...] show Zappa's dismay with the Reagan era and its [...] "obscene pursuit of wealth and happiness".|$|E

500|$|MTV {{stated that}} [...] "'Dress' {{continues}} [...] {{return to the}} soulful old-school sounds he championed in his early work" [...] and that [...] "West works an easy flow over the midtempo joint replete with feathery falsetto backing vocals an overall buttery '70s feel. Despite the laidback groove, West shows his vulnerable side, as he laments being loved and left." [...] "Devil in a New Dress" [...] contains lyrics about lust and heartache, with sexual and religious imagery described by one critic as [...] "part bedroom allure, part angelic prayer". Rap-Up called it a [...] "female-focused song" [...] and a [...] "soulful track, boasting a slow-rolling beat with a haunting vocal sample.” Alex Koening of Knightnews wrote [...] "over piano flourishes and a scintillating string section contain some of the funniest tongue-in-cheek lyrics about women Kanye ever managed: 'I hit the Jamaican spot, at the bar, take a seat/ I ordered the jerk, she said <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>what</b> you eat.' Kanye might be on his quest for love, but he still isn’t able to tolerate gold-digging girls who are only after his cash: 'And outta all the colors that are still up the skies/ You got green on your mind, I {{can see it in}} your eyes.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1930, Nuvolari won {{his first}} RAC Tourist Trophy (he won again in 1933). Motor racing {{legend has it that}} when one of the drivers broke the window of a butcher's shop, Nuvolari drove onto the {{pavement}} and tried to grab a ham as he passed. According to Sammy Davis who met him there, Nuvolari enjoyed dark humour and situations when everything went wrong. For example, after he got a ticket for a journey home from the Sicilian Targa Florio he said to Enzo Ferrari, [...] "What a strange businessman <b>you</b> <b>are.</b> <b>What</b> if I am brought back in a coffin?" ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{story was}} {{constructed}} during the recording sessions, which included producing new overdubs for recordings which previously appeared on Zappa's albums Zoot Allures, Tinseltown Rebellion, <b>You</b> <b>Are</b> <b>What</b> You Is and Ship Arriving Too Late to Save a Drowning Witch. [...] The {{release of the}} album was delayed when Barking Pumpkin Records' previous distributor, MCA, refused to distribute the album. It was instead released by Capitol Records in the United States, accompanied by a [...] "Warning/Guarantee" [...] written by Zappa himself. Thing-Fish was initially received poorly by critics, who criticized the use of previously recorded material, but has since been reappraised for its highly satirical content.|$|E
6000|$|... "You may be {{speaking}} the truth," [...] she said. [...] "If so, I have <b>been</b> deceived. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> {{not quite the}} sort of man I did believe <b>you</b> <b>were.</b> <b>What</b> <b>you</b> tell me <b>is</b> amazing, but it may be true." ...|$|R

2500|$|In 1998, W.K. {{moved from}} Michigan to New York City, {{where he worked}} as a bubblegum machine salesman, a parking attendant, and a waiter when he was not playing music. He ended AAB and began a new solo project; the year saw the release of a cassette-only single {{entitled}} Room to Breathe on Hanson Records. A follow-up release entitled <b>You</b> <b>Are</b> <b>What</b> You Eat was scrapped when the master recordings went missing. W.K. also recorded the soundtrack for an independent film named Poltergeist made by Aaron Dilloway and himself, one track of which appeared on the Hanson Records compilation Labyrinths & Jokes. In 1999, he moved to Seffner, Florida, to start a band with drummer Donald [...] "D.T." [...] Tardy.|$|E
2500|$|The album's lyrics, {{written by}} both Accardi and Lacey, are more {{abstract}} compared {{to many of}} those featured on previous album, The Devil and God Are Raging Inside Me. While Accardi had previously had some involvement in writing lyrics, Daisy saw him contribute far more compared to previous albums. Accardi and Lacey both affirmed {{that there had been}} no conscious decision made by the band on Accardi writing more. Lacey worked with Accardi to help refine his lyrics, as well as filling in any blanks. During writing, both Lacey and Accardi had unintentionally begun to reuse certain themes and imagery, such as nature and forests, as well as lyrics relating to an absence of love. Lacey also used his writing as a means of venting anxieties, comparing it to therapy proclaiming [...] "Daisy was just the venting of anxiety, of letting go and doing the right thing for us personally and as a band. It’s a very hard way to do something but it is the best way. There’s a lot of pent up emotion that goes into owning up to who <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> <b>what</b> you are doing and the choices you are making so Daisy was us rejoicing in that".|$|E
2500|$|Jason Geter {{confirmed}} potential features from The-Dream and Trey Songz. The-Dream {{commented on}} his work with T.I. saying [...] "sounds great. He's sounding beautiful.

[...] Rap-Up had reported that T.I. has been recording with fellow Grand Hustle artist B.o.B, one track was confirmed by B.o.B being titled [...] "Dream Me Up" [...] with production from Cut the Check. In an interview with Vibe, DJ Toomp revealed that T.I. was looking to get André 3000 as a feature on the album. MTV reported that T.I. confirmed collaborations from Lady Gaga, Kid Rock, Young Dro, Mac Boney and Eminem. T.I. told Rolling Stone about the content he had recorded, [...] "some songs talk about my time in prison — how I was affected by that, the way I've grown from that, things I see now that I may have not seen then, sometimes I talk about love, some songs I talk about life, some songs I talk about me being the shit on every level." [...] Kanye West recorded six songs for the album at Avex Honolulu Studios in Honolulu, Hawaii. T.I. told MTV's Jayson Rodriguez that the song [...] "Castle Walls" [...] (featuring Christina Aguilera) originally belonged to Diddy who had commissioned the song for his fifth album Last Train to Paris with his group Dirty Money. But Diddy told T.I. [...] "Yeah, this is my record, but you know what, I think this is a better fit for you. I think you should rock out on this one.
