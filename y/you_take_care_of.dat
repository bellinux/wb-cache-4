500|$|Dudley {{also managed}} several wrestlers, {{including}} Bobo Brazil. Prior to Brazil's matches, Dudley excited the crowds by waving a towel while {{running to the}} ring. Over time, Dudley's role with the company diminished and he ceased working for them; the company's operations were moved to Connecticut, and Turner's Arena was demolished. Shortly before McMahon's death in 1984, he told his son, Vincent K. McMahon, who had taken {{over control of the}} promotion (then known as the WWF), [...] "Whatever else you do, <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> James Dudley." [...] After Vincent J. McMahon's death, Dudley was put back on the company payroll at age 74 and subsequently received several gifts from Vincent K. McMahon to show appreciation for Dudley's contributions to the company. Dudley has been described as an [...] "important cog" [...] in the company, and McMahon once stated that [...] "had there been no James Dudley, the WWF possibly wouldn't exist as it does today". Dudley continued to feel a sense of loyalty to the McMahons and their promotion. Dudley was inducted into the WWF Hall of Fame in 1994 by Vincent K. McMahon.|$|E
2500|$|The lead {{prosecutor}} {{said that}} he had asked Garson: [...] "Why did you do this with Siminovsky? Why did <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> him?" [...] And that Garson had replied: [...] "I like him. And he kind of reminded me of myself." ...|$|E
2500|$|A lighter {{incident}} occurred regarding that accusation during the Nebraska primary campaign. [...] The state's former governor, Frank Morrison, who was actively campaigning for McGovern, sought {{to counter the}} Jackson and Humphrey campaigns' effective use of the accusation. [...] During a campaign speech, Morrison declared, [...] "They say that George McGovern is for the legalization of marijuana, but I say --" [...] At this point there was thunderous applause from the younger people in the audience, which left Morrison puzzled, but when it died down, he finished, [...] "I tell you that George McGovern does not advocate the legalization of marijuana." [...] This produced cries of disappointment in the audience. [...] He continued, [...] "They say George McGovern is for abortion on demand, but I tell you--" [...] Again there was deafening applause, followed by sighs of regret when he finished the sentence: [...] "But I {{say to you that}} George McGovern is against tampering with our state laws on abortion." [...] Afterwards, Morrison confessed to McGovern, [...] "Maybe I'm too old to understand this new generation. [...] I'll get the oldsters for you, and <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> the young ones as you think best." [...] McGovern won the Nebraska primary.|$|E
5000|$|In {{light of}} the Bellflower mom, Nadya Suleman's story, I spoke on The Today Show. When asked, Iyke Louis Udobi stated in their recent AP {{interview}} that [...] "if <b>you</b> can <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> one, <b>you</b> can <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> eight".|$|R
6000|$|Tessa {{hesitated a}} little, under a {{recurrence}} of that original dreamy wonder about Romola which had been expelled by chatting contact--"if you were a saint, <b>you</b> would <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> him, too, because <b>you</b> have <b>taken</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> me and Lillo." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Not in the least," [...] Cecil answered. [...] "Here, Forrest, <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> this," [...] he added, {{passing the}} {{revolver}} over to him. [...] "I'll look after Engleton." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>you</b> <b>took</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> that. All this {{is quite}} true, but it's beside the point. We are not disputing about what happened. What I want to know--for the third time--is what made you let the cat out of the bag? Why couldn't you keep quiet about it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To begin with, {{the thing}} has an airy {{lightness}} {{that ought to}} suit <b>you.</b> Then <b>you</b> <b>took</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> me {{and we were very}} good friends when I was ill. I'd like to feel I'd given you something that might remind you of this. Besides, you see, I'm going away----" ...|$|R
50|$|The game {{begins with}} your Uncle Bill going on an {{expedition}} and leaving <b>you</b> to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> the apartment. <b>You</b> can also <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> the pets {{already in the}} apartment {{of the beginning of}} the game. Soon after the game starts, the janitor will tell you about a lost puppy, and give it to you until the owner is found.

6000|$|... "Silence!" [...] she cried, sternly. [...] "I expect neither thanks nor protests. If <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> the money, John, it {{will last}} you {{as long as you}} live." ...|$|E
6000|$|His arm slid {{behind her}} shoulders. The insinuating music drained her independence. She said mournfully, [...] "Would <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> me?" [...] She touched his hand. It was warm, solid.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] replied Miss Longstreth, simply. [...] "This is my cousin, Ruth Herbert. We've come {{to nurse}} <b>you,</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> the children, {{help you in}} any way you'll let us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Jeff," [...] said I, {{when the}} Autolycan adventurer {{seemed to have}} divulged the gist of his tale, [...] "I hope <b>you</b> <b>took</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> the money.

6000|$|... "Oh, <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> {{your own}} miserable skin well enough! But {{you need not}} be afraid of me--I take my orders from my chief, {{and he has not}} ordered me to kill you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good-bye, old fellow,"' Frank {{cried in}} farewell, as he mounted {{his horse and}} cantered gaily off. [...] "Mind <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> {{yourself}} while I'm away. Give the crater a wide berth. Don't try to go exploring any further without me!" ...|$|E
5000|$|Qi Yihu (齐一虎): {{women might}} {{consider}} working half time and taking <b>care</b> <b>of</b> the family {{half of the}} time. [...] "That way <b>you</b> can <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> parents, husband and kids. This way, you don't completely separate the women from social contact, {{and at the same}} time <b>you</b> can <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> the family, <b>you</b> can call it killing two birds with one stone." ...|$|R
60|$|JAMES. The {{best way}} <b>you</b> can <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> him {{will be to}} give him up.|$|R
5000|$|For I {{was hungry}} and you fed me, thirsty and {{you gave me}} drink. I was a {{stranger}} and you received me in your homes. Naked and you clothed me.

60|$|Pala. [Aside.] How cross {{this happens}} to my design of going to Doralice! for I am {{confident}} she was sick on purpose that I should visit her. Hark you, Rhodophil, could not <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> the stripling? I am partly engaged to-night.|$|E

"To-morrow morning I'll have {{a little}} {{business}} to attend to," [...] said Dunston Porter, [...] "and I'll have to let <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> yourselves for a few hours.

6000|$|I believe I may {{lay claim}} to the mysterious inkstand, also to a volume {{lettered}} on the back, [...] "Shipwrecks and Disasters at Sea, II.," [...] which I left when I came down at Christmas.

6000|$|... 'Self-possessed? energetic?' asked Mrs. Henley, {{with whom}} {{those were the}} first of qualities; and as her brother paused from repugnance to speak of Amabel to one so little capable of comprehending her, she proceeded: 'No doubt she did the best she could, but {{she must have been}} quite inexperienced.
