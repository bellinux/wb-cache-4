5|$|Beetles can be {{beneficial}} to human economics by controlling the populations of pests. The larvae and adults of some species of lady beetles (Coccinellidae) feed on aphids that are pests. Other lady beetles feed on scale insects, whitefly and mealybugs. If normal food sources are scarce, they may feed on small caterpillars, <b>young</b> <b>plant</b> bugs, or honeydew and nectar. Ground beetles (Carabidae) are common predators of many insect pests, including fly eggs, caterpillars, and wireworms. Ground beetles can help to control weeds by eating their seeds in the soil, reducing the need for herbicides to protect crops. The effectiveness of some species in reducing certain plant populations {{has resulted in the}} deliberate introduction of beetles in order to control weeds. For example, the genus Zygogramma is native to North America but has been used to control Parthenium hysterophorus in India and Ambrosia artemisiifolia in Russia.|$|E
25|$|Seeds {{protect and}} nourish the embryo or <b>young</b> <b>plant.</b> They usually give a {{seedling}} a faster start than a sporeling from a spore, {{because of the}} larger food reserves in the seed and the multicellularity of the enclosed embryo.|$|E

Particles of gold or tungsten are coated with DNA and then shot into <b>young</b> <b>plant</b> cells or plant embryos. Some genetic material will stay in the cells and transform them. This method also allows transformation of plant plastids. The transformation efficiency is lower than in Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, but most plants can be transformed with this method.|$|E

500|$|Although [...] "difficult to grow under cultivation", The Royal Horticultural Society states Eriophorum angustifolium can be {{cultivated}} as a low-maintenance wildflower, {{suitable for}} meadows, ponds margins or bog gardens. This may {{be done in}} sheltered or exposed terrain, but best accomplished with full sun at a south- or west-facing aspect, in water up to [...] deep. Poorly-drained peat, sand, clay or loam with an acidic soil pH is required. Division in spring is the recommended form of propagation for the species, and regular deadheading is the recommended method of pruning. Narthecium ossifragum and Myrica gale are suitable for companion planting with E.angustifolium. Eriophorum angustifolium is [...] "generally pest free". As a seedling and <b>young</b> <b>plant</b> it is eaten by sheep and cattle, {{and a variety of}} goose species. It is tolerant to chalybeate (iron-enriched) water, but may succumb to powdery mildews.|$|E
2500|$|A {{vascular}} plant begins {{from a single}} celled zygote, formed by fertilisation of an egg cell by a sperm cell. [...] From that point, it begins to divide to form a plant embryo {{through the process of}} embryogenesis. [...] As this happens, the resulting cells will organize so that one end becomes the first root, while the other end forms the tip of the shoot. [...] In seed plants, the embryo will develop one or more [...] "seed leaves" [...] (cotyledons). [...] By the end of embryogenesis, the <b>young</b> <b>plant</b> will have all the parts necessary to begin in its life.|$|E
2500|$|Angiosperm (flowering plants) seeds {{consist of}} three genetically {{distinct}} constituents: (1) the embryo formed from the zygote, (2) the endosperm, which is normally triploid, (3) the seed coat from tissue {{derived from the}} maternal tissue of the ovule. In angiosperms, the process of seed development begins with double fertilization, which involves the fusion of two male gametes with the egg cell and the central cell to form the primary endosperm and the zygote. [...] Right after fertilization, the zygote is mostly inactive, but the primary endosperm divides rapidly to form the endosperm tissue. [...] This tissue becomes the food the <b>young</b> <b>plant</b> will consume until the roots have developed after germination.|$|E

2500|$|The {{organs and}} tissues {{produced}} by a <b>young</b> <b>plant,</b> such as a seedling, are often different from those that are produced by the same plant when it is older. [...] This phenomenon is known as juvenility or heteroblasty. [...] For example, young trees will produce longer, leaner branches that grow upwards more than the branches they will produce as a fully grown tree. [...] In addition, leaves produced during early growth tend to be larger, thinner, and more irregular than leaves on the adult plant. [...] Specimens of juvenile plants may look so completely different from adult plants {{of the same species}} that egg-laying insects do not recognize the plant as food for their young.|$|E
2500|$|While closely related, {{the terms}} trellising, pruning and vine {{training}} {{are often used}} interchangeably even though they refer to different things. Technically speaking, the trellis refers to the actual stakes, posts, wires or other structures that the grapevine is attached to. Some vines are allowed to grow free standing without any attachment to a trellising structure. Part of the confusion between trellising and vine training systems {{stems from the fact}} that vine training systems will often take on the name of the particular type of trellising involved. [...] Pruning refers to the cutting and shaping of the cordon or [...] "arms" [...] of the grapevine in winter which will determine the number of buds that are allowed to become grape clusters. In some wine regions, such as France, the exact number of buds is outlined by Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) regulations. During the summer growing season, pruning can involve removing <b>young</b> <b>plant</b> shoots or excess bunches of grapes with green harvesting. Vine training systems utilize the practice of trellising and pruning in order to dictate and control a grape vine's canopy which will influence not only the potential yield of that year's crop but also the quality of the grapes due to the access of air and sunlight needed for the grapes to ripen fully and for preventing various grape diseases.|$|E

60|$|Cissus antarcticus.--The tendrils on a <b>young</b> <b>plant</b> {{were thick}} and straight, with the tips a little curved. When their concave {{surfaces}} were rubbed, {{and it was}} necessary to do this with some force, they very slowly became curved, and subsequently straight again. They are therefore much less sensitive than those of the last species; but they made two revolutions, following the sun, rather more rapidly, viz., in 3 hrs. 30 m. and 4 hrs. The internodes do not revolve.|$|E
60|$|Tropaeolum peregrinum.--The first-formed internodes of a <b>young</b> <b>plant</b> did not revolve, {{resembling}} in {{this respect}} those of a twining plant. In an older plant the four upper internodes made three irregular revolutions, in a course opposed to the sun, at an average rate of 1 hr. 48 min. It is remarkable that the average rate of revolution (taken, however, but from few observations) is very nearly the same {{in this and the}} two last species, namely, 1 hr. 47 m., 1 hr. 46 m., and 1 hr. 48 m. The present species cannot twine spirally, which seems mainly due to the rigidity of the stem. In a very <b>young</b> <b>plant,</b> which did not revolve, the petioles were not sensitive. In older plants the petioles of quite young leaves, and of leaves as much as an inch and a quarter in diameter, are sensitive. A moderate rub caused one to curve in 10 m., and others in 20 m. They became straight again in between 5 hrs. 45m. and 8 hrs. Petioles which have naturally come into contact with a stick, sometimes take two turns round it. After they have clasped a support, they become rigid and hard. They are less sensitive to a weight than in the previous species; for loops of string weighing 0.82 of a grain (53.14 mg.), did not cause any curvature, but a loop of double this weight (1.64 gr.) acted.|$|E

40|$|In Arabidopsis, {{much of what}} we {{know about}} the {{phytohormone}} salicylic acid (SA) and its role in plant defense comes from experiments using <b>young</b> <b>plants.</b> We are interested in understanding why <b>young</b> <b>plants</b> are susceptible to virulent strains of Pseudomonas syringae, while mature plants exhibit a robust defense response known as Age-Related Resistance (ARR). SA-mediated signaling is important for defense in <b>young</b> <b>plants,</b> however, ARR occurs independently of the defense regulators NPR 1 and WHY 1. Furthermore, intercellular SA accumulation is an important component of ARR, and intercellular washing fluids from ARR-competent plants exhibit antibacterial activity, suggesting that SA acts as an antimicrobial agent in the intercellular space. <b>Young</b> <b>plants</b> accumulate both intracellular and intercellular SA during PAMP- and Effector-Triggered Immunity, however, virulent P. syringae promotes susceptibility by suppressing SA accumulation using the phytotoxin coronatine. Here we outline the hypothesis that mature, ARR-competent Arabidopsis alleviates coronatine-mediated suppression of SA accumulation. We also explore the role of SA in other mature-plant processes such as flowering and senescence, and discuss their potential impact on ARR...|$|R

60|$|The cocoa-nut is planted as follows: Selecting a {{suitable}} place, you {{drop into the}} ground a fully ripe nut, and leave it. In a few days, a thin, lance-like shoot forces itself through a minute hole in the shell, pierces the husk, and soon unfolds three pale-green leaves in the air; while originating, in the same soft white sponge which now completely fills the nut, a pair of fibrous roots, pushing away the stoppers which close two holes in an opposite direction, penetrate the shell, and strike vertically into the ground. A day or two more, and the shell and husk, which, in the last and germinating stage of the nut, are so hard that a knife will scarcely make any impression, spontaneously burst by some force within; and, henceforth, the hardy <b>young</b> <b>plant</b> thrives apace; and needing no culture, pruning, or attention of any sort, rapidly advances to maturity.

6000|$|The {{philosophers}} of antiquity, interrogated as to {{the cause}} of these phenomena, were provided with a ready and a plausible answer. It did not enter their minds even to doubt that these low forms of life were generated in the matters in which they made their appearance.

And many living creatures, even now, spring out of the earth, taking form by the rains and the heat of the sun."[1] The axiom of ancient science, [...] "that the corruption of one thing is the birth of another," [...] had its popular embodiment in the notion that a seed dies before the <b>young</b> <b>plant</b> springs from it; a belief so widespread and so fixed, that Saint Paul appeals to it {{in one of the most}} splendid outbursts of his fervid eloquence:-- ...|$|E
60|$|All {{this is not}} {{sufficiently}} remembered by some of us when {{the period of the}} year comes which is trying to the farmer's heart, when the young clover is growing, and the barley has been just sown. Farmers, as a rule, do not think very much of their wheat. When such riding is practicable, of course they like to see men take the headlands and furrows; but their hearts are not broken by the tracks of horses across their wheat-fields. I doubt, indeed, whether wheat is ever much injured by such usage. But let the thoughtful rider avoid the new-sown barley; and, above all things, let him give a wide berth to the new-laid meadows of artificial grasses. They are never large, and may always be shunned. To them the poaching of numerous horses is absolute destruction. The surface of such enclosures should be as smooth as a billiard-table, so that no water may lie in holes; and, moreover, any <b>young</b> <b>plant</b> cut by a horse's foot is trodden out of existence.
