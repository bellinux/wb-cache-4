Arsenal were unbeaten {{domestically}} since December 2001 and on course to complete their first league and cup double in four years. Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger was buoyant his team would complete the task on hand: [...] "We have been facing cup games in the league every week {{for a long time}} and this is just another. Chelsea will be a difficult team to beat if they are at their best on Saturday, but such is the confidence in this squad, we just feel we can win every game." [...] When asked what he made of Sir Alex Ferguson's comments that Manchester United played the best football in England, Wenger retorted: [...] "What do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>say?</b> Everybody thinks he has the prettiest wife." [...] The Arsenal manager was undecided whether to drop Richard Wright who started in every round of the FA Cup for David Seaman and to recall Sol Campbell who recovered from a hamstring injury.|$|E
