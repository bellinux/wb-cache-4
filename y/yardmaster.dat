In 1955, Michigan State University Trustee, Forest Akers was asked by C Chairman Cyrus Eaton if the University would be {{interested}} in having a steam locomotive (Eaton did not want to scrap the engines but {{was having a hard time}} finding places that would accept them) so that engineering students would have a piece of real equipment to study. Forest Akers thought it was a good idea and proposed the idea to University President John Hannah. John Hannah accepted the gift of the locomotive. When he told the Dean of the College of Engineering about the gift, the Dean said that Engineering was not interested in an obsolete locomotive. John Hannah then called up Dr. Rollin Baker, director of the MSU Museum and told him that he was getting a locomotive. [...] The C then instructed the <b>yardmaster</b> at New Buffalo to send an engine to the Wyoming Shops for a cosmetic restoration and repainting with the name Chesapeake and Ohio on the side. [...] No. 1225 was the last engine in the line, i.e. easiest to get out. It had nothing to do with the number representing Christmas Day. [...] The Christmas Day myth seems to have arisen after the publication of the book, [...] "Polar Express". [...] Chris Van Allsburg took notice of the number.|$|E

50|$|In 1950 {{there were}} a series of {{disputes}} between the railroads and yard employees {{in connection with the}} 40-hour week. That year the government seized the railroads. The government's Railway Labor Act Emergency Board ruled on June 15, 1950, in favor of the 40-hour basic work week, overtime pay for work in excess of 40 hours, and other improvements. When the railroad owners rejected this John R. Steelman, the President's representative, defined a proposed settlement that included wage increases and cost of living adjustments. The Railroad <b>Yardmasters</b> of America, Railroad <b>Yardmasters</b> of North America and the Switchmen's Union of America agreed to settle with some railroads based on the Steelman formula effective October 1, 1950, but other operating unions held out.|$|R

50|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the railway strike of 1877, there were two very divergent tendencies among railroad workers. The Brotherhood of Railway Trainmen, the Switchmen, and the <b>Yardmasters</b> did not consider themselves unions, they were mutual aid societies. But men who worked in the depots, the yards, the roundhouses, and the railway machine shops were convinced by events in 1877 that they needed to become more aggressive. The two groups of workers worked peacefully side by side for the most part, until the brotherhoods got involved in a struggle with the Knights of Labor.|$|R

Proper turning of equipment was the responsibility of the Hanks <b>Yardmaster.</b>|$|E
50|$|On October 13, 1894, {{delegates from}} several lodges {{of the former}} {{association}} met in Kansas City, Missouri and formed the Switchmen's Union of North America.It was incorporated in Buffalo, New York on January 9, 1902, covering the United States and Canada, and representing yard workers: <b>yardmasters,</b> switchmen, switch tenders, towermen and interlocking men. The objectives were to promote the social, moral and intellectual interests of its members, to maintain harmonious relations between workers and employers and to protect its distressed or erring members, exercising its beneficial influence {{in the interests of}} right and justice. At this period, railway unions such as the Switchmen's Union avoided strikes wherever possible.|$|R
5000|$|The International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail, and Transportation Workers (SMART) a North American {{labor union}} {{headquartered}} in Washington, D. C., was chartered by the AFL-CIO in 2013. The {{product of a}} merger between the Sheet Metal Workers’ International Association (SMWIA) and the United Transportation Union (UTU), SMART represents over 210,000 sheet metal workers, service technicians, bus operators, engineers, conductors, sign workers, welders, and production employees, among others, throughout the United States, Puerto Rico, and Canada. The Transportation Division (which has offices in Washington, D.C. and North Olmsted, Ohio) represents employees on Class I railroad, Amtrak, and regional and short line railroads; bus and mass transit employees on some 45 transit systems; and airline pilots, flight attendants, dispatchers and other airport personnel.

50|$|Ranney (also {{known as}} Rogers Siding) is {{a ghost town}} in Pleasant Prairie. It {{is located at the}} {{intersection}} of Bain Station Road and the Canadian Pacific Railroad (originally the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul & Pacific Railroad). The last passenger train stopped at the Ranney Station prior to 1862, but the Ranney post office opened in 1885 and lasted into 1906. The Bain Station of the KD Line was located just east of Ranney, and remained into the 1940s. Rogers Siding itself was a KD Line team track just west of Green Bay Road for area farmers who would load their produce for rail shipments; the siding itself was removed in the 1980s. The last house in Ranney, the former KD Line <b>yardmaster's</b> house, was demolished in 2003, and the area is now devoid of all traces of community except for continuing railroad activity on the KD Line and the Canadian Pacific. Much of the property there is now owned by We Energies.|$|R
5000|$|Switch/local Conductor - A switch/local {{conductor}} {{is responsible}} for servicing local industry customers close to their assigned rail yard. This is done by gathering rail cars from one or more tracks within the yard, as assigned by the <b>Yardmaster,</b> then transporting those rail cars to the assigned industries; and placing them in their designated [...] "spots". The Industry switcher is also responsible for [...] "pulling" [...] the cars that the customer has [...] "Ordered Out", and returning them to the rail yard for classification and placement in an outbound train.|$|E

50|$|Frederick {{was born}} Pauline Beatrice Libbey (later changed to Libby) in Boston in 1883 (some sources state 1884 or 1885), {{the only child}} of Richard O. and Loretta C. Libbey. Her father worked as a <b>yardmaster</b> for the Old Colony Railroad before {{becoming}} a salesman. Her parents separated when she was a toddler and Frederick was raised primarily by her mother to whom she remained close for the remainder of her life (her parents divorced around 1897). As a girl, she was fascinated with show business, and determined early to place her goals {{in the direction of the}} theater. She studied acting, singing and dancing at Miss Blanchard's Finishing School in Boston where she later graduated.|$|E
50|$|The first {{element of}} {{controlling}} train lengths was {{to place a}} cap on train size. To avoid train meets where both trains were overlength for a siding’s capacity, an instruction was issued to the Thunder Bay <b>yardmasters</b> to ensure that eastward trains leaving their terminal for the Nipigon Subdivision did not exceed a length of 6200 feet. This capping {{of the length of}} eastward trains also tacitly acknowledged that westward trains would have no length restrictions. When first implemented, this length target was difficult to meet as there was no process in place to deliver an accurate train length measurement. Thus sometimes there were surprises when, on a planned meet, a train did not fit into a siding. In such instances, the excess length would have to be moved into the siding’s back track, if possible, until the opposing train had passed. Under such a scenario, delays could be incurred by both trains. Canadian Pacific Railway took train length determination a step further and implemented on the Division a basic process to capture actual train lengths and pass this information along to the train dispatcher to assist in train planning while limiting train delays.|$|R
5000|$|It {{took two}} years of discussions, on and off, before the unions were ready to {{negotiate}} an agreement. Finances were a stumbling block. The UTU’s structure was “top-heavy” by SMWIA standards and “economically unsustainable.” So before any real progress could be made the UTU would have to cut the number vice presidents to lower expenses and raise per capita taxes to match SMWIA rates. With negotiations back on track, the UTU reaffiliated with the AFL-CIO early in 2006 (with the SMWIA’s help), and by spring 2007 both organizations had a merger agreement ready to go. The document seemed straightforward at the time. Both unions agreed that they shared common objectives, including a desire to improve their members’ living and working conditions. They admitted that their goal was to strengthen their ability to organize and bargain with employers more effectively. And they acknowledged that the merger agreement had been negotiated {{in a spirit of}} good will with the firm conviction that unity between the Sheet Metal Workers and the UTU would bring “fresh strength” to their industries and their political and community-related efforts. The merged organization would be known as “SMART” - the International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail, and Transportation Workers. It would be governed by a new constitution that encompassed the old, that is, the SMWIA constitution would be amended to include the UTU constitution as Article 21 B. And it would place the UTU president {{at the head of a}} new Transportation Division that would include a Bus Department, <b>Yardmasters</b> Department, and Airlines Department. Six of the UTU’s current officers would join the SMWIA’s eleven vice presidents on SMART’s GEC - the remaining vice presidents would be named international representatives or organizers and provide the same services they did as UTU officers.|$|R
