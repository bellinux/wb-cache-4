500|$|Producer John Lloyd, {{speaking}} to The Times in 1989 hinted {{that it was}} the draining scripting and rehearsal process that led to the writers deciding not to make another series: [...] "Things do get very tense by the end of a series, because everyone involved in the thing is very clever, and very funny, and they all want to push the scripts along. It's a very exhausting process, {{and by the end of}} it we all swear we'll never, ever, do another one. But then you start to think how rare it is to get so many good people in the same room and you talk <b>yourself</b> <b>into</b> doing another series." ...|$|E
500|$|Ed O'Brien {{described}} the lyrics, saying [...] "They were universal. There wasn't a political agenda. It's being human." [...] The song [...] "Bodysnatchers" [...] {{is inspired by}} Victorian ghost stories, the 1972 novel The Stepford Wives and Yorke's feeling of [...] "your physical consciousness trapped {{without being able to}} connect fully with anything else." [...] "Jigsaw Falling into Place" [...] is about a set of observations and different experiences, partly of the chaos witnessed by Yorke when he used {{to go out on the}} weekend in Oxford. Yorke said [...] "The lyrics are quite caustic—the idea of 'before you're comatose' or whatever, drinking <b>yourself</b> <b>into</b> oblivion and getting fucked-up to forget ... is partly this elation. But there's a much darker side." ...|$|E

[...] "I was kind of doing the {{opposite}} — being nonchalant and doing other stuff and not having a routine. You get in that physical routine that just makes you ready mentally. You trick <b>yourself</b> <b>into</b> knowing that it's game time and time to play." [...] Kyle Dubas, assistant GM of the Toronto Marlies cited Emery for his mentorship towards the team. On February 5, 2016, Emery signed with Adler Mannheim of the German elite league Deutsche Eishockey Liga {{for the remainder of}} the season, thus ending his professional tryout with the Toronto Marlies of the American Hockey League (AHL) On March 29, 2016, he signed a tryout contract with the Philadelphia Flyers of the National Hockey League (NHL) and on April 1, 2016, the Philadelphia Flyers announced signing Emery {{for the remainder of the}} season.|$|E

500|$|There are {{multiple}} features {{omitted from the}} game that the team considered typical of most video games, such as boss fights. A traditional cover system was excluded for the game as the team wanted players to constantly move around. The team also attempted to cause players to {{feel as though they}} are lacking, particularly in the supplies that they collect. [...] "You're not building <b>yourself</b> <b>into</b> a tank," [...] said Straley. This also motivated many of the design decisions of the gameplay, such as the weightlessness of the animations, and the melee combat mechanic. To further add to the realism, the team developed the game's combat mechanic in a way that forces players to spend more time planning. They also wanted players to be forced to retreat from combat after alerting the Infected, despite their belief that retreating is the [...] "anti-video game play mechanic". The combat mechanic was developed to feel intense, intentionally moving the camera closer to players, {{in order for them to}} [...] "feel every strike". The team felt that the game forces players to make difficult choices, in terms of combat, stealth and resource management, allowing them to understand the decisions made by the characters.|$|E
500|$|The game's playable character, William [...] "B.J." [...] Blazkowicz, {{has been}} {{previously}} featured as the playable protagonist of all Wolfenstein games. When developing the character of Blazkowicz for The New Order, MachineGames considered his appearances in previous games in the series. When doing this, they realised that the character had never really developed at all throughout the games; [...] "He's just the guy that you play," [...] said Pete Hines, Vice President of PR and Marketing for Bethesda. The team discovered that {{they were interested in}} exploring his story, which is what they later invested in. One particular scenario that the team envisioned is putting Blazkowicz in situations where he is uncomfortable. Matthies said, [...] "that's really interesting to me. I love taking things and making them real." [...] Throughout the game, Blazkowicz communicates some of his inner thoughts through short monologues, many of which reveal that he has been traumatized by some of his experiences. [...] "We always loved the idea of a prototypical action hero exterior juxtaposed with a rich and vulnerable interior psychology," [...] said Matthies. One of the largest priorities for the team when developing the character of Blazkowicz was to [...] "reveal whatever needs to be revealed to [...] and the player" [...] simultaneously; Matthies felt that, despite the simplicity of this concept, it is rarely used in games. Prior to developing The New Order, the team had primarily worked on games that involved antihero protagonists. However, id Software wished Blazkowicz to be portrayed differently in the game. Matthies said, [...] "It's really important to [...] that BJ is a hero, and not an anti-hero." [...] The team attempted to develop Blazkowicz into a character that players could relate to, as they felt that players are generally unable to relate to video game protagonists. [...] "The goal is not to have a protagonist that's so neutral that you can project <b>yourself</b> <b>into</b> them; the goal is to have a protagonist that is so relatable that you become them," [...] said Matthies. They also tried to make players become [...] "emotionally in sync" [...] with Blazkowicz, using the morality choice in the game's prologue to do so.|$|E
2500|$|The fourth song is [...] "Judas", which Gaga {{confirmed}} {{to be influenced}} by the Biblical Judas Iscariot. The song's lyrics are about being betrayed as well as [...] "honoring your darkness in order to bring <b>yourself</b> <b>into</b> the light," [...] according to Gaga. The song is a dance-pop and house track, with influences of techno, industrial and disco, a 1980s-inspired pop chorus, as well as a breakdown containing elements of dubstep and techno music. In parts of the song, Gaga sing-raps with a Caribbean Patois accent.|$|E

2500|$|The {{problem was}} how to move from mode to mode. One option would be to signal this change—"put <b>yourself</b> <b>into</b> command mode"—via {{one of the many}} pins in the RS-232 cable. However, while the 25-pin {{connector}} on the modem side had more than enough pins for this purpose (even some meant for this purpose), the computer side often used a much smaller 9-pin connector, and equally often many of these pins were not actually connected or accessible from software. In fact, there were very few pins that were guaranteed to work on all computers, mostly the data in and out, [...] "ready" [...] indications that said whether the modem or computer was operational, and sometimes flow-control pins.|$|E

2500|$|Within {{the land}} of Mordor where it was forged, the Ring's power {{increased}} so significantly that even without wearing it the bearer could draw upon it, and could acquire an aura of terrible power. When Sam encountered an orc in the Tower of Cirith Ungol while holding the Ring, he appeared to the orc as a powerful warrior cloaked in shadow [...] " [...] some nameless menace of power and doom." [...] The orc was so terrified that it fled. Similarly at Mount Doom, when Frodo and Sam were attacked by Gollum, Frodo grabbed the Ring and appeared as [...] "a figure robed in white... held a wheel of fire." [...] Frodo told Gollum [...] "in a commanding voice" [...] that [...] "If you touch me ever again, you shall be cast <b>yourself</b> <b>into</b> the Fire of Doom," [...] a statement fulfilled when Gollum fell into Mount Doom with the Ring. Although the Ring was certainly invoked with this statement, {{it is unclear whether}} Frodo was prophesying (Frodo had previously seen less sinister visions while in possession of the Ring), or if Frodo was actively laying a curse upon Gollum.|$|E
2500|$|For Kierkegaard, true {{individuality}} {{is called}} selfhood. Becoming {{aware of our}} true self is our true task and endeavor in life—it is an ethical imperative, as well as preparatory to a true religious understanding. Individuals can exist {{at a level that}} is less than true selfhood. We can live, for example, simply in terms of our pleasures—our immediate satisfaction of desires, propensities, or distractions. In this way, we glide through life without direction or purpose. To have a direction, we must have a purpose that defines for us the meaning of our lives. Kierkegaard puts it this way in Either/Or, Here, then, I have your view of life, and, believe me, much of your life will become clear to you if you will consider it along with me as thought-despair. You are a hater of activity in life-quite appropriately, because {{if there is to be}} meaning in it life must have continuity, and this your life does not have. You keep busy with your studies, to be sure; you are even diligent; but it is only for your sake, and it is done with as little teleology as possible. Moreover, you are unoccupied; like the laborers in the Gospel standing idle in the marketplace, you stick your hands in your pocket and contemplate life. Now you rest in despair. Nothing concerns you; you step aside for nothing; “If someone threw a roof tile down I would still not step aside.” You are like a dying person. You die daily, not in the profound, earnest sense in which one usually understands these words, but life has lost its reality and you “Always count the days of your life from one termination-notice to the next.” You let everything pass you by; nothing makes any impact. But then something suddenly comes along that grips you, an idea, a situation, a young girl’s smile, and now you are “involved,” for just on certain occasions you are not “involved,” so at other times you are “at your service” in every way. Wherever there is something going on you join in. You behave in life as you usually do in a crowd. “You work <b>yourself</b> <b>into</b> the tightest group, see to it, if possible, to get yourself shoved up over the others so that you come to be above them, and as soon as you are up there you make yourself as comfortable as possible, and in this way you let yourself be carried through life.” But when the crowd is gone, when the event is over, you again stand on the street corner and look at the world.
