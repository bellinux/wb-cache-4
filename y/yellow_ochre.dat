5|$|Choctaw dyers use maple (Acer sp.) for a grey dye. Navajo weavers create black from mineral <b>yellow</b> <b>ochre</b> {{mixed with}} pitch from the piñon tree(Pinus edulis) and the three-leaved sumac (Rhus trilobata). They also produce a cool grey dye with blue flower lupine {{and a warm}} grey from Juniper {{mistletoe}} (Phoradendron juniperinum).|$|E
5|$|The same scholar has {{performed}} {{detailed analysis of}} the rock art in Facatativá; the Piedras del Tunjo Archaeological Park. The many petrographs in this location are painted using red, <b>yellow,</b> <b>ochre,</b> blue, black and white colours. The motives show a possible tobacco plant, commonly used by the Muisca, zig-zag patterns, anthropomorphic figures, concentric lines similar to those in Soacha and Sáchica, zoomorphic motives and anthropo-zoomorphic composites in the shape of frogs.|$|E
30|$|The {{study has}} {{also looked at}} the wider palette present which is {{comprised}} of red and <b>yellow</b> <b>ochres,</b> carbon black, cinnabar, calcite and gypsum on kaolinite grounds, consistent with Hellenistic period terracottas [10] and decorated ceramics.|$|R
50|$|Titian {{employed}} {{an extensive}} array of pigments {{and it can}} be said that he availed himself of virtually all available pigments of his time. Except for the common pigments of the Renaissance period, such as ultramarine, vermilion, lead-tin <b>yellow,</b> <b>ochres,</b> and azurite, he also used the rare pigments realgar and orpiment.|$|R

25|$|Ochre, both red and yellow, {{appears in}} South African heraldry; the {{national}} coat of arms, adopted in 2000, includes red ochre, while (<b>yellow)</b> <b>ochre</b> {{appears in the}} arms of the University of Transkei.|$|E
25|$|In Vermeer’s oeuvre, {{only about}} 20 {{pigments}} have been detected. Of these 20 pigments, seven principal pigments which Vermeer commonly employed include lead white, <b>yellow</b> <b>ochre,</b> vermilion, madder lake, green earth, raw umber, and ivory or bone black.|$|E
5|$|Ancient Egyptian {{artisans}} used {{stone to}} carve statues and fine reliefs, but used wood as a cheap and easily carved substitute. Paints {{were obtained from}} minerals such as iron ores (red and <b>yellow</b> <b>ochres),</b> copper ores (blue and green), soot or charcoal (black), and limestone (white). Paints could be mixed with gum arabic as a binder and pressed into cakes, which could be moistened with water when needed.|$|R
50|$|On the buff {{underside}} {{there are}} 4-6 fine pores per millimetre. These are initially greyish-white but mature to <b>yellow</b> or <b>ochre.</b>|$|R

25|$|Ochre is a clay that is {{colored by}} varying amounts of hematite, varying between 20% and 70%. Red ochre {{contains}} unhydrated hematite, whereas <b>yellow</b> <b>ochre</b> contains hydrated hematite (Fe2O3 • H2O). The principal use of ochre is for tinting {{with a permanent}} color.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} known pigments were natural minerals. Natural {{iron oxides}} give {{a range of}} colors and are found in many Paleolithic and Neolithic cave paintings. Two examples include Red Ochre, anhydrous Fe2O3, and the hydrated <b>Yellow</b> <b>Ochre</b> (Fe2O3.H2O). Charcoal, or carbon black, has also been used as a black pigment since prehistoric times.|$|E
25|$|Just {{north of}} Birdwood is the Cromer Conservation Park, proclaimed in 1976, with an open-forest {{formation}} of long-leafed box with Pink Gum {{and an open}} woodland formation of Red Gum, which forms an important habitat for honeyeaters. Mining for <b>yellow</b> <b>ochre</b> occurred in the park during the 1800s. There are no formal walking trails or visitor facilities.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 8-16 mm. The forewings are whitish <b>yellow</b> to <b>ochre,</b> {{with a dark}} costal margin. The hindwings {{are dark}} grey.|$|R
30|$|From the {{composition}} of the pigments, it appears that the image portraying Mary and the Child does not accord with the overall painting programme because the palette used here includes cinnabar, orpiment and lead white, which is different from the earth pigments used elsewhere for the same colours, namely red and <b>yellow</b> <b>ochres.</b> These differences in types of pigment suggest that the Marian figure may have been painted after the rest of the murals (together with some retouches in the neighbouring figure).|$|R
50|$|The {{church was}} given a {{relatively}} dark Victorian appearance when opened. The Greek columns were painted a sandstone orange, with an elaborate color scheme of brown, red, and <b>yellow</b> <b>ochres</b> dominating {{the rest of the}} nave. The chancel was dominated by a black walnut reredos. A small stained-glass window of St. Paul stood above the high altar. English Minton tiles adorned the aisles and chancel that complimented the color scheme of the church. An anonymous painting of this interior is still in the possession of the parish.|$|R
25|$|Before the Royal Family {{moved in}} at the palace in 1754, the whole facade, except for the base was painted in a <b>yellow</b> <b>ochre</b> color to imitate French sandstone. The yellow tone was the {{foremost}} color of the Rococo and the height of fashion at that time. The monochrome yellow color without any contrasting white on the stone details {{was a way to}} achieve an architectonical effect with mainly relief.|$|E
25|$|The south panel {{depicts the}} spoils {{taken from the}} Temple in Jerusalem. The golden {{candelabrum}} or Menorah is the main focus and is carved in deep relief. Other sacred objects being carried in the triumphal procession are the Gold Trumpets, the fire pans for removing the ashes from the altar, and the Table of Shew bread. These spoils were likely originally colored gold, with the background in blue. In 2012 the Arch of Titus Digital Restoration Project discovered remains of <b>yellow</b> <b>ochre</b> paint on the menorah relief.|$|E
25|$|Lowry {{claimed to}} have only ever used five colours: Flake White (Lead White), Ivory Black, Vermillion Red, Prussian Blue and <b>Yellow</b> <b>Ochre,</b> all from the art-supply firm Winsor & Newton, but expert {{analysis}} of the paint used in Darby and Joan showed that it contained traces of Zinc White. However, the programme revealed a photograph of Lowry's studio in the 1950s which showed that he did have both Titanium White and Zinc White. The same painting was also plainly visible in a contemporary BBC documentary film about the artist, which included shots of his studio. All three works were judged to be genuine {{by a panel of}} experts, and the total value of the paintings was estimated to be in excess of £200,000.|$|E
50|$|Images in Aztec codices, {{ceramics}} and sculptures display the elaborate and colorful designs of Aztec weavers. There were regional textile specialties, with associated graphic designs. Most designs were geometric, with some regions specializing in textiles with {{animal and plant}} images. Cotton was generally used, and dyes came from blue clays, <b>yellow</b> <b>ochres,</b> and red came from insects living in nopal cacti. Purple {{was derived from the}} sea snail Purpura patula, similar to how the Phoenicians also derived purple dye used for royal robes from snails.|$|R

50|$|Although {{best known}} for murals and other monumental works, Flores has worked with various media, {{techniques}} and sizes. Traditional media include oils, acrylics, watercolors and ink in small and medium-sized formats as well as monumental. More unusual media and materials have included cloth, rock, plaster, glass, wood, snow, vegetation, paper and cardboard. One collection {{is a series of}} ink drawings on paper napkins, which belongs to the Máxima Casa de Estudios. El Minotauro is painted over live rock at the Museo Universitario. Colors that frequently appear in his work include reds, <b>yellows,</b> <b>ochre,</b> grays, blues and black.|$|R
25|$|Many of the {{locomotives}} {{remained in}} traffic, both departmental and in regular stock. They lasted {{longer than most}} classes of pre-grouping tank engine under the Southern Railway, primarily due {{to the presence of}} several light railways which came under the Southern Railway's jurisdiction at the grouping, such as the lines from Tenterden and Hayling Island, {{as well as on the}} Isle of Wight. Most of these lines needed small engines such as the 'Terrier' class due to severe weight restrictions. Among the engines transferred into departmental use was the former No.82 Boxhill, which was restored to original condition, painted in the <b>yellow</b> <b>ochre</b> livery of Stroudley and used as a shunter at Brighton Works, being numbered 380S and named after the works itself. This engine was replaced by 377S, formerly No.35 Morden, in 1948. Although much photographed toward the end of steam, this locomotive was not preserved but was scrapped at Eastleigh in 1963.|$|E

This eruption had a minimum volume of [...] Additional tephra layers indicate eruptions less than 2,560 and 4,320 years ago, along {{with a number of}} smaller eruptions.|$|E
500|$|In Scotland, sycamores {{were once}} a favoured tree for hangings, because their lower {{branches}} rarely broke under the strain. Both male and female flowers produce abundant nectar, which makes a fragrant, delicately flavoured and pale-coloured honey. The nectar and copious dull <b>yellow</b> <b>ochre</b> pollen are collected by honeybees as food sources. [...] The sap rises vigorously {{in the spring and}} like that of sugar maple can be tapped to provide a refreshing drink, as a source of sugar and to make beer.|$|E
50|$|Entirely {{enclosed}} and pedestrianised, this square {{is located}} {{in the heart of the}} old town. With typical buildings in red and <b>yellow</b> <b>ochres</b> surrounding the square, the cathédrale Sainte-Réparate and the fountain in the centre, place Rossetti is a must-see spot in the old town. By day, the place is invaded by the terraces of traditional restaurants and the finest ice-cream makers. By night, the environment changes radically, with tourists and youths flocking to the square, where music reverberates on the walls of the small square. The square's lighting at night gives it a magical aspect.|$|R

30|$|Colour {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} properties of objects, in archaeology and art history. This review is aimed at collecting information on the stability of traditional inorganic mediaeval pigments under a variety of conditions. The pigments considered are whites (leadwhite and calcium carbonate), <b>yellows</b> (<b>ochres,</b> orpiment, massicot, lead tin <b>yellows),</b> orange-reds (<b>ochres,</b> realgar, vermillion, litharge, red lead), blues (ultramarine, blue ochre, smalt, azurite, Egyptian blue), greens (green earths, malachite, verdigris and other Cu containing materials), brown (umbers) and black (carbon black). Pigments as Naples yellow (Pb 2 Sb 2 O 7 /Pb 3 (SbO 4) 2), lead chromate yellows (PbCrO 4 /PbCr 1 −xSxO 4), Prussian blue (KFe[Fe(CN) 6]·xH 2 O/Fe 4 [Fe(CN) 6] 3 ·xH 2 O), zinc white (ZnO), etc., although known to degrade, are not included in this review, as they were not available during the Middle Ages [1]. For the purpose of this review, mainly chemical and archaeometrical literature was reviewed, so that an explanation for the on-going degradation processes could be provided as revealed by advanced analytical techniques.|$|R
500|$|In Ancient Egypt, {{green was}} {{the symbol of}} {{regeneration}} and rebirth, and of the crops {{made possible by the}} annual flooding of the Nile. [...] For painting on the walls of tombs or on papyrus, Egyptian artists used finely ground malachite, mined in the west Sinai and the eastern desert; a paintbox with malachite pigment was found inside the tomb of King Tutankhamun. They also used less expensive green earth pigment, or mixed <b>yellow</b> <b>ochre</b> and blue azurite. To dye fabrics green, they first colored them yellow with dye made from saffron and then soaked them in blue dye from the roots of the woad plant.|$|E
500|$|The text is {{accompanied}} by many full-page miniatures, while smaller painted decorations appear throughout the text in unprecedented quantities. The decoration {{of the book is}} famous for combining intricate detail with bold and energetic compositions. The characteristics of the Insular manuscript initial, as described by Carl Nordenfalk, here reach their most extreme realisation: [...] "the initials ... are conceived as elastic forms expanding and contracting with a pulsating rhythm. The kinetic energy of their contours escapes into freely drawn appendices, a spiral line which in turn generates new curvilinear motifs...". The illustrations feature a broad range of colours, with purple, lilac, red, pink, green, and yellow being the colours most often used. Earlier manuscripts tend toward more narrow palettes: the Book of Durrow, for example, uses only four colours. As is usual with Insular work, there was no use of gold or silver leaf in the manuscript. The pigments for the illustrations, which included red and <b>yellow</b> <b>ochre,</b> green copper pigment (sometimes called verdigris), indigo, and possibly lapis lazuli, would have been imported from the Mediterranean region and, {{in the case of the}} lapis lazuli, from northeast Afghanistan. Though the presence of lapis lazuli has long been considered evidence of the great cost required to create the manuscript, recent examination of the pigments has proven that lapis lazuli was not used.|$|E

The sides above the prolegs are <b>yellow</b> <b>ochre.</b> [...] A narrow border around the head and the anal segment <b>yellow</b> <b>ochre.</b> Initially the head is black. The larva in later instars becomes apple green, darker on the back, with three narrow yellow stripes on the seventh to tenth segments, and a buff line just above the legs from head to tail. The head is green with four round black spots on the crown, and two more smaller ones at {{the angle of the}} jaws.|$|E
5|$|Géricault {{painted with}} small brushes and viscous oils, which allowed {{little time for}} {{reworking}} and were dry by the next morning. He kept his colours apart from each other: his palette consisted of vermilion, white, naples yellow, two different <b>yellow</b> <b>ochres,</b> two red ochres, raw sienna, light red, burnt sienna, crimson lake, Prussian blue, peach black, ivory black, cassel earth and bitumen. Bitumen has a velvety, lustrous appearance when first painted, but {{over a period of}} time discolours to a black treacle, while contracting and thus creating a wrinkled surface, which cannot be renovated. As a result of this, details in large areas of the work can hardly be discerned today.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} forms {{part of the}} {{research}} undertaken on the mural paintings from Abydos area in Egypt, and it {{is concerned with the}} identification of the materials used in the paint layers of these murals. The methods used in this purpose are optical microscopes (OM), scanning electron microscope with an energy dispersive X-ray unit (SEM/EDS), X-ray diffraction (XED), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Theses methods led to that the blue color was Egyptian blue, while the green one was Egyptian green; in addition, the red and yellow colors were composed of red and <b>yellow</b> <b>ochres.</b> Finally, the binder used was gum Arabic...|$|R
50|$|The {{analysis}} of the painting materials is described in the book by Bomford et al.
