25|$|Coping {{occurs in}} {{response}} to psychological stress—usually triggered by changes—in an effort to maintain mental health and emotional well-being. Life stressors are often described as negative events (loss of a job). However, positive changes in life (a new job) can also constitute life stressors, thus requiring the use of coping skills to adapt. Coping strategies are the behaviors, thoughts, and emotions that <b>you</b> <b>use</b> <b>to</b> adjust to the changes that occur in your life. The use of coping skills will help a person better themselves {{in the work place}} and perform {{to the best of their}} ability to achieve success. There are many ways to cope and adapt to changes. Some ways include: sharing emotions with peers, having a healthy social life outside of work, being humorous, and adjusting expectations of self and work. These coping skills will help turn negative emotion to positive and allow for more focus on the public in contrast to oneself.|$|E

6000|$|In doing this, however, {{take care}} not to get the drawing too dark. In order to {{ascertain}} what the shades of it really are, cut a round hole, about half the size of a pea, in a piece of white paper, the colour of that <b>you</b> <b>use</b> <b>to</b> draw on. Hold this bit of paper, with the hole in it, between you and your stone; and pass the paper backwards and forwards, so as to see the different portions of the stone (or other subject) through the hole. You will find that, thus, the circular hole looks like one of the patches of colour you have been accustomed to match, only changing in depth as it lets different pieces of the stone be seen through it. You will be able thus actually to match the colour of the stone, at any part of it, by tinting the paper beside the circular opening. And you will find that this opening never looks quite black, but that all the roundings of the stone are given by subdued greys.[208] ...|$|E
60|$|In {{regard to}} Colwall, you are both, my very dear friends, the kindest {{that you can}} be. Ah, but dearest, dearest Mrs. Martin, you can understand, with the same {{kindness}} that <b>you</b> <b>use</b> <b>to</b> me in other things. There is only one event in my life which never loses its bitterness; which comes back on me like a retreating wave, going and coming again, which was and is my grief--I never had but one brother who loved and comprehended me. And so there is just one thought which would be unbearable if I went into your neighbourhood; and you won't set it down, I am sure, as unpardonable weakness, much less as affectation, if I confess to you that I never could bear it. The past would be too strong for me. As to Hope End, it is nothing. I have been happier in my own home since, than I was there and then. But Torquay has made the neighbourhood of Hope End impossible to me. I could not eat or sleep in that air. You will forgive me for the weakness, I am certain. You know a little, if not entirely, how we loved one another; how I was first with him, and he with me; while God knows that death and separation have no power over such love.|$|E
6000|$|When I see birches bend to {{left and}} right [...] Across the lines of straighter darker trees, [...] I like to think some boy's been {{swinging}} them. [...] But swinging doesn't bend them down to stay. [...] Ice-storms do that. Often you must have seen them [...] Loaded with ice a sunny winter morning [...] After a rain. They click upon themselves [...] As the breeze rises, and turn many-colored [...] As the stir cracks and crazes their enamel. [...] Soon the sun's warmth makes them shed crystal shells [...] Shattering and avalanching on the snow-crust-- [...] Such heaps of broken glass to sweep away [...] You'd think the inner dome of heaven had fallen. [...] They are dragged to the withered bracken by the load, [...] And they seem not to break; though once they are bowed [...] So low for long, they never right themselves: [...] You may see their trunks arching in the woods [...] Years afterwards, trailing their leaves on the ground [...] Like girls {{on hands and knees}} that throw their hair [...] Before them over their heads to dry in the sun. [...] But I was going to say when Truth broke in [...] With all her matter-of-fact about the ice-storm [...] (Now am I free to be poetical?) [...] I should prefer to have some boy bend them [...] As he went out and in to fetch the cows-- [...] Some boy too far from town to learn baseball, [...] Whose only play was what he found himself, [...] Summer or winter, and could play alone. [...] One by one he subdued his father's trees [...] By riding them down over and over again [...] Until he took the stiffness out of them, [...] And not one but hung limp, not one was left [...] For him to conquer. He learned all there was [...] To learn about not launching out too soon [...] And so not carrying the tree away [...] Clear to the ground. He always kept his poise [...] To the top branches, climbing carefully [...] With the same pains <b>you</b> <b>use</b> <b>to</b> fill a cup [...] Up to the brim, and even above the brim. [...] Then he flung outward, feet first, with a swish, [...] Kicking his way down through the air to the ground. [...] So was I once myself a swinger of birches. [...] And so I dream of going back to be. [...] It's when I'm weary of considerations, [...] And life is too much like a pathless wood [...] Where your face burns and tickles with the cobwebs [...] Broken across it, and one eye is weeping [...] From a twig's having lashed across it open. [...] I'd like to get away from earth awhile [...] And then come back to it and begin over. [...] May no fate willfully misunderstand me [...] And half grant what I wish and snatch me away [...] Not to return. Earth's the right place for love: [...] I don't know where it's likely to go better. [...] I'd like to go by climbing a birch tree, [...] And climb black branches up a snow-white trunk [...] Toward heaven, till the tree could bear no more, [...] But dipped its top and set me down again. [...] That would be good both going and coming back. [...] One could do worse than be a swinger of birches.|$|E
