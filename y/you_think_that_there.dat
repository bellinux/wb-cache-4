6000|$|... "Seriously speaking," [...] said he, [...] "don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> {{are some}} {{experiences}} great {{enough to break}} up and re-form a man's nature?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is {{any chance}} of our being disturbed, Master Oswald?" [...] Roger said, as they took up their post under a low, stunted tree.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{feel as if}} I wanted breakfast horribly," [...] Peter said, with {{an attempt}} at a smile. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is any {{possibility}} of catching anything?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't believe it," [...] Annie broke out, but she {{was greatly}} troubled. [...] "What do <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> Ellen; <b>that</b> <b>there's</b> any danger of his {{carrying}} the day against Mr. Peck?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Scoutbush? Of {{course he}} will,--he shall,--he must. Good heavens! whose concern {{is it more}} than his? <b>You</b> <b>think,</b> then, <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is a chance of staving it off--by cleansing, I mean?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{there is}} to be a retreat made at all," [...] Mrs. Conyers said, [...] "I prefer that it should be made now. Do <b>you</b> really <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is any real danger of attack?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is {{any chance}} {{at all of}} the Spaniards taking the place, if they do besiege us?" [...] Bob asked, as Dr. Burke took his seat.|$|E
60|$|Still <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is more {{interest}} {{taken in the}} intellectual development of the working classes in foreign countries than in England?--I think so, but I do not trust my own opinion.|$|E
6000|$|... "Your {{father and}} his friends have gone off to secure my uncle’s treasure, and you come {{straight}} on here," [...] she cried, hotly. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is no end to his good-nature?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because {{it would}} be, I suppose, {{understood}} as a signal of distress," [...] he went on. [...] "What do <b>you</b> <b>think?</b> <b>That</b> elephant <b>there,</b> I take it, stands for something {{in the nature of}} the Union Jack in the flag. [...] ." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 155. <b>You</b> observed, I <b>think,</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was a thirsty desire on {{the part}} of the working classes for improvement?--Certainly.|$|R
6000|$|... “There, ‘Duke, what do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of <b>that?</b> <b>There</b> {{is another}} verse of it, {{all but the}} last line. I haven’t got a rhyme for the last line yet. Well, old John, what do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of the music? as good as one of your war-songs, ha?” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That we can see, father. Mother and I were at {{the window}} for hours after you left, and the whole sky seemed ablaze. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is any danger of its coming here?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then if <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> {{will only}} be a peaceable entry, will you not let me ride with you? It will be a brave sight to see the king enter London again; one to tell of all one's life." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And, Mamma, don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is a {{something}},--I don't know what,--something not at {{all like}} other men about him that compels one to love him? Oh, Mamma, do say something nice to me! To me he is everything that a man should be." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>You</b> may <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is {{not much}} to be evolved from Pig. It all depends how you set to work. Pinecoffin being a Civilian and wishing to do things thoroughly, began with an essay on the Primitive Pig, the Mythology of the Pig, and the Dravidian Pig.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> he {{is likely}} to come to know it, sir; the shock of the affair {{yesterday}} and that of this morning have completely prostrated him, and Dr. Holloway, who was up with him before <b>you</b> arrived, <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is very little chance of his recovery." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> Mr. Houston, <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is something,--a little,--unmanly shall I call it, {{in coming}} so often {{about the same}} thing?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, tell me--we {{have heard}} {{much of that}} bad {{business}} at Cholula--tell me, do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was treachery {{on the part of}} the people, or was it a mere pretext of the Spaniards to fall upon the inhabitants, and sack the town?" ...|$|E
6000|$|My dearest child, why try for that? Try {{to be as}} good, and wise, {{and learned}} as you can, and if you find any man, or ten {{thousand}} men, superior to you, thank God for it. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> can be too much wisdom in the world? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{who know}} everything, Mr. Pepper," [...] she said, [...] "tell us how did those {{wonderful}} French ladies manage their salons? Did we ever do {{anything of the}} same kind in England, or do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is some reason why we cannot do it in England?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> Sir Henry," [...] I said, much put out, and {{pocketing}} my paper--for I do {{not like}} to be thought one of those silly fellows who consider it witty to tell lies, and who are for ever boasting to newcomers of extraordinary hunting adventures which never happened--"if <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> why, <b>there</b> is an end to the matter," [...] and I rose to go.|$|R
6000|$|... "Kreta will go himself," [...] {{the chief}} said, [...] "with {{two of his}} young men. Do <b>you</b> not <b>think,</b> incos, <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is danger in your calling out?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{every one}} says," [...] the countess replied. [...] "But surely <b>you</b> do not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is any danger. The Walloons and Germans {{should be able}} alone to hold the barricades, and behind them are all the citizens." ...|$|R
60|$|I won't have <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was {{anything}} remarkable about the man, {{or anything that}} would--even momentarily--distinguish him from {{any number of other}} hall porters, who wear a uniform and peaked cap, have the air of having seen military service, and wear a couple of medals on a well-developed chest.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{will give}} them a chance of proving whether their title is justified," [...] the colonel said, cheerfully. [...] "That is very good news. The men are getting {{thoroughly}} worn out with the extra night duty caused by this uncertainty. <b>You</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> {{is no doubt that the}} news is correct?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'She {{knows it}} already;--that is, {{she knows what}} you mean. I have not told her of the woman's lie, nor of this demand for money. But I shall when she {{is strong enough to}} hear it and to talk of it. You are very much mistaken if <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are secrets between me and Hester.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, William," [...] says I, smiling, [...] "do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> if <b>there</b> is a God above, as {{you have}} so long been telling me <b>there</b> is, and <b>that</b> we must give an account to Him,--I say, do <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> if He be a righteous Judge, He will let us escape thus with the plunder, as we may call it, of so many {{innocent}} people, nay, I might say nations, and not call us to an account for it before {{we can get to}} Europe, where we pretend to enjoy it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, what in {{the world}} has that to do with it! The crux {{of the matter is that}} you didn't own the dog--can't you see <b>that?</b> <b>You</b> seem to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is no impropriety in selling {{property}} that isn't yours provided you sell it cheap. Now, then--" ...|$|R
5000|$|When {{asked by}} Noisey in 2014 {{if he ever}} felt bitter {{for a lack of}} recognition, singer Kyle Bishop stated, [...] "There’s a lot of accolades that people give us for {{supposedly}} starting something and I <b>think</b> <b>that’s</b> all bullshit to be honest with <b>you.</b> I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there’s</b> a billion bands that were doing similar things before us and after that that deserve just as much credit. And if we do get some credit by certain people, awesome. If we don't, it doesn’t really matter because I really don’t think it’s true anyways." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I knew {{it quite}} well. You are not conceited. You do not believe, {{as so many}} men would, that I have {{fallen in love with}} you. <b>You</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> must be some object, and you ask {{yourself}} all the time, 'What is it?' in your heart, Mr. Laverick, I wonder whether you have any idea." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But if <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is no mistake, if your {{opponent}} is undoubtedly about {{to proceed to}} extremities, shoot him down at once, my dear lad, before he has time to draw. I have heard {{those who have been}} out there say that in such cases everything depends upon getting the first shot. I am anxious about you, and shall not be easy until I see you again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you take}} me for a pig like yourself?" [...] said Leonard angrily. [...] "Well, go your own way, foolish that you are, but beware of the beer and the spirits. Now you are {{beginning}} to know this language, and when you are drunk you talk, and do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are no spies here? That girl, Saga, is great-niece to Nam, and you are besotted with her. Be careful lest you bring us all to death." ...|$|E
5000|$|I'll {{be honest}} with <b>you,</b> I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is a {{reasonably}} good chance <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is nothing of any value on the phone. What we are hoping {{might be on the}} phone would be potential contacts that we would obviously want to talk to. This is an effort to leave no stone unturned in the investigation. To allow this phone to sit there and not make an effort to get the information or the data that may be inside of that phone is simply not fair to the victims and their families.|$|R
6000|$|... "They will say, Alice, {{whatever}} their crooked policy may suggest, or their disappointed vanity can urge. But the picture must be {{drawn by the}} friends of the hero, as well as by his enemies! <b>Think</b> <b>you,</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are not pens as well as swords in America?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O Sweet Fern, Sweet Fern!" [...] {{cried the}} student. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> I was <b>there,</b> to measure {{him with a}} yard-stick? Well, if you must know to a hair's-breadth, I suppose he might be from three to fifteen miles {{straight}} upward, and {{that he might have}} seated himself on Taconic, and had Monument Mountain for a footstool." ...|$|R
