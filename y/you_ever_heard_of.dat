Then I thought, 'Twenty-five per cent of the world might get this, {{probably}} less, it's not worth it.' It happens all the time, because my references are usually off the Richter scale." ...|$|E
500|$|Carnarvon {{had been}} succeeded as Colonial Secretary by Sir Michael Hicks Beach, who {{received}} the deputation coldly. After Bok gave a lengthy opening declaration, Hicks Beach muttered: [...] "Have <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> an instance where the British Lion has ever given up anything on which he had set his paw?" [...] Kruger retorted: [...] "Yes. The Orange Free State." [...] The deputation remained in London for some weeks thereafter, communicating by correspondence with Hicks Beach, who eventually reaffirmed Carnarvon's decision that the annexation would not be revoked. The deputation attempted to rally support for their cause, as the first mission had done, but with the Eastern Question dominating the political scene few were interested. One English sympathiser gave Kruger a gold ring, bearing the inscription: [...] "Take courage, your cause is just and must triumph in the end." [...] Kruger was touched and wore {{it for the rest}} of his life.|$|E

2500|$|Right-wing {{radio host}} Rush Limbaugh {{contended that the}} events were being blown out of proportion, stating that [...] "this is no {{different}} than what happens at the Skull and Bones initiation, and we're going to ruin people's lives over it and we're going to hamper our military effort, and then we are going to really hammer them because they had a good time. You know, these people are being fired at every day. I'm talking about people having a good time, these people, <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> emotional release? <b>You</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> emotional release?" [...] Conservative talk show host Michael Savage said, [...] "Instead of putting joysticks, I {{would have liked to have}} seen dynamite put in their orifices", and that [...] "we need more of the humiliation tactics, not less."

Roz retells the urban legend version of Vélez's suicide, {{reminding}} Frasier that [...] "even though things might not happen like we planned, they can work out anyway." [...] When Frasier asks [...] "how it worked out for Lupe", Roz tells him [...] "all she wanted was to be remembered. Will you ever forget that story?" [...] Later in the episode Frasier asks a caller to his radio show, [...] "Have <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> the story of Lupe Velez?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Elbegdorj {{has long}} been an {{advocate}} for women's rights and more proportional representation of women in decision making level of governments. He stressed the importance of women in leadership, highlighting the three-fold increase of women representatives elected in the 2012 Mongolian parliamentary elections in his speech at the UN General Assembly in September 2012. [...] "We need more women leaders. Women tend to see the whole picture. For society to advance, we need more women in public service at all levels – local to global. They bring an unique perspective often missing in global challenges," [...] Elbegdorj said [...] "Have <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> a woman bloody dictator or tyrant? I think not. If there were more women in power, I think we would have more harmony, more engagement and less suffering and less conflict." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 58 BC, Publius Clodius Pulcher, the tribune of the plebs, {{introduced}} a law (the Leges Clodiae) threatening exile {{to anyone who}} executed a Roman citizen without a trial. Cicero, having executed members of the Catiline Conspiracy four years previously without formal trial, and having had a public falling out with Clodius, was clearly the intended target of the law. Cicero argued that the senatus consultum ultimum indemnified him from punishment, and he attempted to gain {{the support of the}} senators and consuls, especially of Pompey. When help was not forthcoming, he went into exile. He arrived at Thessalonica, on May23, 58BC. Cicero's exile caused him to fall into depression. He wrote to Atticus: [...] "Your pleas have prevented me from committing suicide. But what is there to live for? Don't blame me for complaining. My afflictions surpass any <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> earlier". After the intervention of recently elected tribune Titus Annius Milo, the senate voted in favor of recalling Cicero from exile. Clodius cast the single vote against the decree. Cicero returned to Italy on August5, 57BC, landing at Brundisium. He was greeted by a cheering crowd, and, to his delight, his beloved daughter Tullia.|$|E

"'Fourthly,'" [...] recited Mr. Carroll, with an {{exceeding}} sober face, [...] "'Fourthly, that we {{will not}} kill, or suffer to be killed, or sell, or dispose to any person whom we have reason to believe intends to kill, any ewe-lamb that shall be weaned before the first day of May, in any year during the time aforesaid.'

5000|$|Many U.S. radio stations, in {{response}} to the language found in the song, wanted an edited version.

[...] were changed by replacing [...] "whore" [...] with a [...] "shhh" [...] sound and removing [...] "god" [...] in [...] "goddamn".
