Typically, when Hacikyan wrote lyrics he had a melody in mind, which the band fit the music around. Hacikyan {{described}} the album as being about [...] "the everyday ins-and-outs of social cliques. It’s about the pressure that they put on <b>you,</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> up to something that you’re not, to be somebody that someone else wants you to be." [...] The Academy Is... vocalist William Beckett provides guest vocals on [...] "There's a Class for This," [...] while All Time Low performed group vocals on [...] "Teasing to Please (Left Side, Strong Side)" [...] and [...] "Sweet Talk 101."

2500|$|The {{number of}} native Jews was soon bolstered by {{small groups of}} Ashkenazi Jews that immigrated to the Ottoman Empire between 1421–1453. Among these new Ashkenazi {{immigrants}} was Rabbi Yitzhak Sarfati (Hebrew: צרפתי–Sarfati, meaning: [...] "French"), a German-born Jew whose family had previously lived in France, who became the Chief Rabbi of Edirne and wrote a letter inviting the European Jewry to settle in the Ottoman Empire, in which he stated that: [...] "Turkey is a land wherein nothing is lacking" [...] and asking: [...] "Is it not better for <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> under Muslims than under Christians?".|$|E
2500|$|Jewish {{communities}} in the Ottoman Empire held a protected status and continued to practice their own religion, as did Christians, though both were subject to additional restrictions, such as restrictions on the areas where they could live or work or in clothing, and both had to pay additional taxes. Yitzhak Sarfati, born in Germany, became the Chief Rabbi of Edirne and wrote a letter inviting European Jews to settle in the Ottoman Empire, in which he asked: [...] "Is it not better for <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> under Muslims than under Christians?'". Sultan Beyazid II (1481–1512), issued a formal invitation to the Jews expelled from Catholic Spain and Portugal, leading to a wave of Jewish immigration.|$|E

Funk Brother musician Earl Van Dyke once mentioned that Berry Gordy didn't know of the word [...] "ecology" [...] {{and had to be}} told what it was. The song featured a memorable tenor saxophone riff from Detroit music legend Wild Bill Moore. [...] "Right On" [...] was a lengthy seven-minute jam influenced by funk rock and Latin soul rhythms that focused on Gaye's own divided soul in which Gaye later pleaded in falsetto, [...] "if you let me, I will take <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> where love is King" [...] after complying that [...] "true love can conquer hate every time". [...] "Wholy Holy" [...] follows [...] "God Is Love" [...] as an emotional gospel plea advising people to [...] "come together" [...] to [...] "proclaim love [...] salvation". The final track, [...] "Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler)", focuses on urban poverty, backed by a minimalist, dark blues-oriented funk vibe, with its bass riffs composed and performed by Bob Babbitt, who also performed on [...] "Mercy Mercy Me" [...] (Jamerson played {{on the rest of the}} album). The entire album's stylistic use of a song cycle gave it a cohesive feel and was one of R's first concept albums, described as [...] "a groundbreaking experiment in collating a pseudo-classical suite of free-flowing songs." ...|$|E
