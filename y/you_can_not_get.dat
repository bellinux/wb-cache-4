It seems hard to entrust such great scientific discoveries to the discretion of a mere boy; but they are quite harmless, so if you exercise proper care <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> into trouble through their possession. And who knows what benefits to humanity may result? One week from to-day, at this hour, I will again appear to you, at which time you shall receive the second series of electrical gifts." ...|$|E

He is obliged to be at Pike court where he has a case, with a fee of five hundred dollars, two hundred dollars already paid. To neglect it would be unjust to himself, and dishonest to his client. Harris will be with you, head up and tail up, for Nebraska. You must have some one to make an anti-Nebraska speech. Palmer is the best, {{if you can get}} him, I think. Jo. Gillespie, if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> Palmer, and {{somebody}} anyhow, if you can get neither. But press Palmer hard. It is in his Senatorial district, I believe.|$|E

6000|$|Well: {{but there}} is a branch of {{education}} in which, even now, the poor man can compete fairly against the rich; and that is, Natural Science. In the first place, the rich, blind to their own interest, have neglected it hitherto in their schools; so that they have not the start of the poor man on that subject which they have on many. [...] In the next place, Natural Science is a subject which a man cannot learn by paying for teachers. He must teach it himself, by patient observation, by patient common sense. And if the poor man is not the rich man's equal in those qualities, it must be his own fault, not his purse's. Many shops have I seen about the world, in which fools could buy articles more or less helpful to them; but never saw I yet an observation-shop, nor a common-sense shop either. And if any man says, [...] "We must buy books:" [...] I answer, a poor man now can obtain better scientific books than a duke or a prince could sixty years ago, simply because then the books did not exist. When I was a boy I would have given much, or rather my father would have given much, if I could have got hold of such scientific books as are to be found now in any first-class elementary school. And if more expensive books are needed; if a microscope or apparatus is needed; <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> them by the co-operative method, which has worked so well in other matters? <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> form yourselves into a Natural Science club, for buying such things and lending them round among your members; and for discussion also, the reading of scientific papers of your own writing, the comparing of your observations, general mutual help and mutual instructions? Such societies are becoming numerous now, and gladly should I see one in every town. For in science, as in most matters, [...] "As iron sharpeneth iron, so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend." ...|$|R
6000|$|My first {{contrivance}} {{was to make}} a pretence {{to speak}} to this Moor, to get something for our subsistence on board; for I told him we must not presume to eat of our patron's bread; he said, that was true: so he brought a large basket of rusk or biscuit of their kind, and three jars with fresh water, into the boat. I knew where my patron's case of bottles stood, which it was evident, by the make, were taken out of some English prize, and I conveyed them into the boat while the Moor was on shore, {{as if they had been}} there before for our master: I conveyed also a great lump of bees-wax into the boat, which weighed above half a hundred weight, with a parcel of twine or thread, a hatchet, a saw, and a hammer, all which were of great use to us afterwards, especially the wax to make candles. Another trick I tried upon him, which he innocently came into also; his name was Ismael, whom they call Muley, or Moley; so I called him: [...] "Moley," [...] said I, [...] "our patron's guns are on board the boat; <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> a little powder and shot? it may be we may kill some alcamies (a fowl like our curlews) for ourselves, for I know he keeps the gunner's stores in the ship."--"Yes," [...] says he, [...] "I'll bring some;" [...] and accordingly he brought a great leather pouch which held about a pound and a half of powder, or rather more; and another with shot, that had five or six pounds, with some bullets, and put all into the boat: at the same time I had found some powder of my master's in the great cabin, with which I filled one of the large bottles in the case, which was almost empty, pouring what was in it into another; and thus furnished with every thing needful, we sailed out of the port to fish. The castle, which is at the entrance of the port, knew who we were, and took no notice of us: and we were not above a mile out of the port before we hauled in our sail, and set us down to fish. The wind blew from the N.N.E. which was contrary to my desire; for had it blown southerly, I had been sure to have made the coast of Spain, and at least reached to the bay of Cadiz; but my resolutions were, blow which way it would, I would be gone from that horrid place where I was, and leave the rest to fate.|$|R

40|$|Throughout {{the history}} of Photogrammetry, {{according}} to Andrade (2003), many methods and devices were developed aiming at attaining the highest accuracy, coupled with the lowest cost in the determination of coordinates. Indeed, mechanical equipment, the analog solution, were developed to the fullest. The optical and mechanical systems allow high precision and were robust enough to last many years, but extremely expensive. The evolution of electronics allowed more precise solutions, fast and economical. All measurements or observations, are affected by errors of different classes. So {{it is impossible to}} determine the true magnitude of a distance or an angle measured. The exact value is only in our imagination. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> over the likely value. For Brito (2007), the bundle block adjustment represents a major advance in photogrammetric techniques, for allowing the coordinates of various points on the ground from the interpolation of only a few points in the field, streamlining production costs photogrammetric. Because it is an interpolation process is not error free. However, if complied with adequate details for each scale to obtain the basic points of support, we arrive at acceptable results for the topographic mapping (scales of 1 : 250, 000 and less), or even for the cadastral mapping (scale of 1 : 2000 and higher). The parameters obtained are essential in the practice phototriangulation subsequent rectification, orthorectification and restitution. It highlights the fact the fundamental importance of this task is therefore essential to its judicious. Pages: 9000 - 900...|$|E
