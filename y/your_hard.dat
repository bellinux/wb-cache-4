For he will render to every man according to his works: to those who by patience in well-doing seek for glory and honor and immortality, he will give eternal life; but for those who are factious and do not obey the truth, but obey wickedness, there will be wrath and fury. There will be tribulation and distress for every human being who does evil, the Jew first and also the Greek, but glory and honor and peace for every one who does good, the Jew first and also the Greek. For God shows no partiality.|$|E

Reviewers criticized the service {{for the lack of}} games available, {{reliability}} issues and the lack of integration with iOS games. Scott Stein of CNET commented [...] "Game Center-compatible titles will have achievements, leaderboard info...and, potentially, a way of playing cross-platform games. As of the time of this post, I could find only seven Game Center games featured the Mac App Store," [...] and [...] "Until Game Center becomes a complete portal for all games on the Mac, and a true method of cross-platform iOS/Mac play, I'm not sure many people will even bother checking it out." [...] Matt Clark of MacLife also commented that if developers don't develop applications for Game Center, it is [...] "likely doomed to sit unnoticed on <b>your</b> <b>hard</b> drive".|$|E
2500|$|His heretical {{opinions}} and early friendship with Henry V created a traditional scandal which long continued. In the old play The Famous Victories of Henry V, written before 1588, Oldcastle figures as the Prince's boon companion. When Shakespeare adapted that play in Henry IV, Part 1, Oldcastle still appeared, {{but when the}} play was printed in 1598, the name was changed to Falstaff (modelled after John Fastolf), in deference to one of Oldcastle's descendants, Lord Cobham. Though the fat knight still remains [...] "my old lad of the Castle", the stage character {{has nothing to do}} with the Lollard leader. In Henry IV, Part 2 an epilogue emphasises that Falstaff is not Oldcastle: [...] "Falstaff shall die of a sweat, unless already a' be killed with <b>your</b> <b>hard</b> opinions; for Oldcastle died a martyr, and this is not the man." [...] In 1599, another play, Sir John Oldcastle, presented Oldcastle in a more kindly light.|$|E

2500|$|Jesus Freak Hideout's Michael Weaver {{said that}} [...] "Since 2008, the band has {{undergone}} extensive line-up changes {{that has left}} only singer Kevin Young as the sole original member still standing. Despite these changes, Disciple has continued to release solid hard rock records. Their newest effort, O God Save Us All, is no exception, but is, however, {{a bit of a}} mixed bag. Half of the record feels like the energizing hard rock found of their self-titled album, as well as Scars Remain, while the other half feels more like the same modern rock heard all over the radio. Thankfully, Disciple is able to pull that radio rock sound off better than most." [...] Weaver concluded with saying [...] "Kevin Young's current Disciple doesn't necessarily hit it out of the park, but they do manage to maintain the norm. When the norm is crafting solid rock records with great replay value, 'maintaining the norm' isn't such a bad thing; it's no wonder Disciple has been around so long...Fans of harder rock than typically played on the radio, and fans of radio rock alike, can find common ground on this record. O God Save Us All probably won't end up as the favorite album of most fans, but it still contains plenty of material to whet <b>your</b> <b>hard</b> rock appetite." ...|$|E
