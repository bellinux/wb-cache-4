500|$|The {{identity}} of the sitter has been debated since the panel's discovery. Foley has identified at least four Jane Greys among the English nobility {{at the time of}} the portrait. However, owing to [...] "the ages and marital status of the other candidates", Lady Jane Grey was the only viable choice; the others were too young, already married and using a different surname, or had lost their title. Starkey was more reserved, arguing [...] "there isn't that over-the-top quality <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>with</b> royal portraits of the period, where the sitters look as though they've just come back from Asprey", and that there was no documentation of Jane owning the jewellery seen in the portrait.|$|E

Dickson Wright {{comments}} that Acton knew about [...] "her countrymen"'s {{lack of understanding of}} curry and [...] "lamented 'the great superiority of the oriental curries over those generally prepared in England'". She further notes that Acton suggested practical improvements, such as grating coconut into the gravy, and using tamarind, acid apples and cucumber to simulate the [...] "piquancy <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>with</b> bitter gourds, mango, and so on", which she comments was certainly better than lazily adding lemon juice, but still nothing like [...] "anything prepared by my grandmother's Indian cook." ...|$|E

The episode features a guest appearance by stand-up comedian Kirk Fox as Joe, Leslie's nemesis from the Pawnee sewer department.

2500|$|Bow Wow had {{publicly}} {{announced his}} interpretation of the song's meaning as he stated {{in an interview with}} MTV: [...] "Basically the song is me talking to a girl and telling her, 'These are the things I can do for you. Let me hold you down. This is what I want to do for you as a man. These are the things I'm capable of doing for you if <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>with</b> me. Just hear me out.' I'm just really talking to the ladies. The song is really special to me, and I love that song."

2500|$|In 1994 Blackman {{made her}} first {{recording}} with {{a working group}} and called the album Telepathy because of the tight communication in the band. [...] "I {{wanted to do a}} quartet record because of the amount of space <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>with</b> fewer players", she said in Telepathy's liner notes. [...] "It's intimate, but more dimensional than a piano trio. I'm really into this sound, and it was nice to play with a group that was a group. You can't help but have a better feel when the musicians know each other, are headed in the same direction, and have the same goals. You can make most everything work. You get chances to play a lot of colors, and really stretch your ideas." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You've got Prince and MacNeff figured exactly right," [...] replied Dale. [...] "Prince is the {{football}} captain, by-the-way. Be careful how {{you run into}} second base. If you ever slide into him head first--good-bye! He's a great player, and he can hit {{any kind of a}} ball. MacNeff now, just as you said, is weak on a high ball close in, and he kills a low ball. Kills is the word! He hits them a mile. But, Peg, I think you're a little off on Keene, Starke, and Martin, the other Place cracks. They're veterans, hard to pitch to; they make you cut the plate; they are as apt to bunt as hit, and they are fast. They keep a fellow guessing. I think Starke pulls a little on a curve, but the others have no weakness I ever discovered. But, Peg, I expect you to do more with them than I did. My control was never any too good, and you can throw almost as straight as a fellow could shoot a rifle. Then your high fast ball, that one <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>with</b> the long swing, it would beat any team. Only I'm wondering, I'm asking--can you use it right along, {{in the face of such}} coaching and yelling and hitting as you'll run against to-day? I'm asking deliberately, because I want to give you confidence." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps I {{was going}} to say that even those Germans are not so dear as they are in the fatherland, though rude. They do not tend much if at all to tables d'hôte, but the Italians and the French who do, serve you a better meal for a lower price than you would get in Paris, or Rome, or Naples. There the {{prevalent}} ideal is five francs, with neither wine nor coffee included. I'll allow that the cheap table d'hôte is mainly the affair of single men and women, and does not merit the consideration I've given it. If it helps a young couple to do with one maid, or with none, instead of two, it makes for cheapness of living. Service is costly and it is greedy, and except in large households its diet {{is the same as the}} family's, so that anything which reduces it is a great saving. But the table d'hôte which is cheap for one or two is not cheap for more, and it is not available if there are children. Housing and raw-provisioning and serving are the main questions, and in Europe the first and last are apparently much less expensive. Marketing is undoubtedly cheaper with us, and if you count in what <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>with</b> the newness, the wholesomeness, and handiness of an American flat, the rent is not so much greater than that of a European flat, with its elementary bareness. You could not, here, unless you descended from the apartment to the tenement, hire any quarter where you would not be supplied with hot and cold water, with steam heating, with a bath-room, and all the rest of it." ...|$|E
