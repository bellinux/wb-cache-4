6000|$|This roused all the slumbering warrior in him, {{and when}} the time came (May 8), in a speech {{three and a half hours}} long, he threw his detractors into a depth of {{confusion}} that might have satisfied the Psalmist himself. Peremptorily he brushed aside the apology of his assailants for not challenging him by a direct vote of want of confidence, that such a vote would be awkward in a time of war. On the contrary, he said, a case so momentous as the case of war is the very reason why you should show boldly whether you have confidence in our management of <b>your</b> <b>finances</b> or not; if you disapprove, the sooner I know it the better. Then he dashed into a close and elaborate defence in detail, under all the heads of attack,--his manner of dealing with the unfunded debt, his abortive scheme of conversion, his mode of charging deficiency bills. This astonishing mass of dry and difficult matter was impressed in full significance upon the House, not only by the orator's own buoyant and energetic interest in the performance, but by the sense which he awoke in his hearers, that to exercise their attention and judgment upon the case before them was a binding debt imperatively due to themselves and to the country, by men owning the high responsibility of their station. This was the way in which he at all times strove to stir the self-respect of the House of Commons. Not sparing his critics a point or an argument, he drove his case clean home with a vigour that made it seem as if the study of Augustine and Dante and the Fathers were after all the best training for an intimate and triumphant mastery of the proper amount of gold to be kept at the bank, the right interest on an exchequer bond and an exchequer bill, and all the arcana of the public accounts.[333] Even where their case had something in it, he showed that they had taken the wrong points. Nor did he leave out the spice of the sarcasm that the House loves. A peer had reproached him for the amount of his deficiency bills. This peer had once himself for four years been chancellor of the exchequer. 'My deficiency bills,' cried Mr. Gladstone, 'reached three millions and a half. How much were the bills of the chancellor whom this figure shocks? In his first year they were four millions and a half, in the second almost the same, in the third more than five and a quarter, in the fourth nearly five millions and a half.' Disraeli and others pretended that they had foreseen the failure of the conversion. Mr. Gladstone proved that, as matter of recorded fact, they had done nothing of the sort. 'This is the way in which mythical history arises. An event happens without attracting much notice; subsequently it excites interest; then people look back upon the time now passed, and see things not as they are or were, but through the haze of distance--they see them as they wish them to have been, and what they wish them to have been, they believe that they were.' ...|$|E

5000|$|Now {{in these}} troubled times, We find that {{no less than}} the Justice Department of these United States has found that {{institutionalized}} racism has found its way into many municipal courts across the land, making a Jim Crow reality for many black youth preventing them from ever reaching their potential to be as great as their fathers aspired them to be. They are challenged by police as they go about their lives, by I.D. challenges, stop and frisk, [...] black lives matter. This is a fault of not being one of the haves, a poverty in America that is compounded by courts making laws to keep the have-nots in place, forever poor.We should fall back to what made of our generation a black middle class, one that founded the organizations like ours, and be guides and mentors to our lost generation of youth. Civil Service made black wealth a reality for a time, but we got complacent, and 2008 saw the greatest re-distribution of black wealth ever in the form of pension losses, home foreclosures and bankruptcies. Our finest minds have gone on, having done their time striving for better. Their sons and daughters are not part of that America, and for the most part, they are not civil servants. They are Lawyers, Bankers, Business owners and members of Americas elite. The ones that are civil servants, we call on you to join us. We need you to give of your time, your dollars, your knowledge of Civil Service to the returning veteran, to the students in school, to the parolee just out of our mass incarceration mills and to get them hired. Those salaries are returned to the community because these are our neighbors, our relatives, our brothers and sisters. We know how to do this, and {{it is the only way}} to prevent the cycle of crime, drugs and violence that plagued us in our communities as it did during the crack epidemic of the 90's, and the fires and riots of the 60's.It is imperative that we impart our skills to this problem now, as the older generation withers a gap is forming and the old organizations are dying swiftly. Lets invigorate the tree of liberty with the blood, sweat and tears of a new generation. Call out your fence sitting friends, bring them out and you come out, we need you now to re-build and re-vitalize your communities. Now that you are no longer a Probie, and you have a handle on <b>your</b> <b>finances,</b> join a fraternal organization and give 50 hours a year to mentor youth in test practice classes. Give up 5 hours of overtime a year to shepherd a parolee into a job.
