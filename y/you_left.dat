5|$|The website Allmusic {{called the}} song 'a tormented ballad about romantic loss and regret {{built on a}} spooky yet heart-wrenching piano melody'. The torment {{is present in the}} song's opening ('There were nights when the wind was so cold'), from which the singer recovers ('I {{finished}} crying in the instant that <b>you</b> <b>left...</b> And I banished every memory you and I had ever made'). However, the defiance in the verses are replaced by the return of the 'subservient' feelings in the chorus ('when you touch me like this, and you hold me like that...'); this juxtaposition continues throughout the song.|$|E
5|$|After the war, of course, {{the roads}} were all bad. There were cobbles from the moment <b>you</b> <b>left</b> Paris, or Senlis where we started in those days. There'd be {{stretches}} of surfaced roads and often there'd be a cycle path or a pavement and sometimes a thin stretch of something smoother. But you never knew where was best to ride and you were for ever switching about. You could jump your bike up on to a pavement but that got harder the more tired you got. Then you'd get your front wheel up but not your back wheel. That happened to me. And then you'd go sprawling, of course, and you could bring other riders down. Or they'd fall off and bring you down with them. And the cycle paths were often just compressed cinders, which got soft {{in the rain and}} got churned up by so many riders using them and then you got stuck and you lost your balance. And come what may, you got covered in coal dust and other muck. No, it's all changed and you can't compare then and now.|$|E
5|$|It’s straightforward, heartfelt and classy. Mariah pleads {{with her}} {{departed}} lover – 'When <b>you</b> <b>left</b> I lost {{a part of}} me / It’s still so hard to believe' – and the song’s gentle R roll is perfectly understated, built from a few piano chords and a slowed-down So So Def rhythm. It has a homebody quality, almost like an autumn song would – you can imagine a split-up couple singing it quietly, separately, as the world goes on around them. She’s on a porch with tea; he’s stuck in traffic when he finds Mariah on the radio. It even cleverly references that feel, with Mariah finding the Bobby Womack and Babyface songs on her radio just too tough to hear. There’s no tired 'I tried to 2-way you' retorts, no trash-technology love affair 'I was at the grocery store and this guy had the same ring tone as you, and I cried.' No, there’s a classic sensibility to the lyrics and sound of 'We Belong Together' that makes for perfect – and perfectly universal – pop/R songwriting. In other words, it’s the jam. And there’s probably a happy ending, too: Mariah’s triumphant octave shift finale makes the song’s title an emphatic.|$|E

500|$|After {{the first}} five songs, The Revival {{features}} songs at a calmer tempo and more conventional style, with ballads that are more relaxed and low-key. [...] "It Never Rains (In Southern California)" [...] was titled after an oft-repeated phrase from one of Tony! Toni! Toné!'s attorneys, who used it {{in response to the}} group wearing heavy coats after returning from visits on the East Coast. Group drummer Timothy Christian played most of the song's instruments, and bassist Raphael Wiggins wrote its lyrics about a man longing for a woman who was in southern California. The ballads are followed by [...] "Those Were the Days", which features jouncing banjo, trumpet, and wistful lyrics reminiscing about simpler times [...] "when a dollar was worth a dollar, and you didn't have to carry a gun when <b>you</b> <b>left</b> your house." ...|$|E

500|$|On 4 October, TV3 {{broadcast}} Vincent Browne's Big Presidential Debate. Gay Mitchell challenged Martin McGuinness on the [...] "fairytale" [...] that he {{left the}} IRA in 1974, asking him directly: [...] "If you (McGuinness) say <b>you</b> <b>left</b> the IRA in 1974 and persist in saying that when you didn’t; {{if you say you}} are living on the average industrial wage when you are drawing down a couple of hundred grand– how can people have confidence in your word?" [...] Moderator Vincent Browne later challenged Martin McGuinness' claims {{that he left}} the Provisional Irish Republican Army in 1974, producing eight books with alleged evidence claiming otherwise. McGuinness referenced this moment when he said in a later debate on the radio that people would blame him for the 1916 Rising if they {{could find a way to}} implicate him.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "You Lost Me" [...] {{talks about}} a [...] "cheating" [...] man, who has left Aguilera's world [...] "infected". Amar Toor from AOL Radio thought that its lyrical content [...] "perfectly captures {{one of the most}} {{difficult}} experiences young lovers have to go through". The song begins with a [...] "somber orchestral" [...] piano opening, followed by the lines [...] "I am done, smoking gun/ We've lost it all, the love is gone" [...] sung by Aguilera. During the chorus, she sings, [...] "I feel like our world's been infected/ And somehow <b>you</b> <b>left</b> me neglected". Toward the ending, Aguilera's [...] "painful" [...] and [...] "catharsis" [...] voice [...] "crescendos dramatically". According to Jon Pareles from The New York Times, Aguilera [...] "barely" [...] holds back her tears in the song. The Village Voice critic Drew Hinshaw thought that Aguilera is [...] "less vexed by what he did than what he lost".|$|E
500|$|Stalemate {{drew closer}} as the Rhodesian Cabinet {{resolved}} that since Wilson had ruled out {{maintenance of the}} status quo, its only remaining options were to trust in the Royal Commission or declare independence. When the terms for the commission's visit were presented to Smith, he found that contrary to what had been discussed during the British Prime Minister's visit, the Royal Commission would operate {{on the basis that}} the 1961 constitution was unacceptable to the British government, and that Britain would not commit itself to accepting the final report. Smith said these conditions amounted to a [...] "vote of no confidence in [...] before they commenced", and therefore rejected them. [...] "The impression <b>you</b> <b>left</b> with us of a determined effort to resolve our constitutional problem has been utterly dissipated", he wrote to Wilson on 5 November. [...] "It would seem that you have now finally closed the door which you publicly claimed to have opened." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} written at the ocean's point of view, {{detailing}} the human's evolution. According to Jason Killingsworth from Paste magazine, it calls listeners' attention to [...] "Mother Oceania" [...] {{from which the}} singer believes all life emerged, whilst she sings: [...] "You have done well for yourselves / Since <b>you</b> <b>left</b> my wet embrace / And crawled ashore [...] ". The song anchors the midsection of Medúlla, [...] "jubilantly punctuated with bubbling synth and propelled by the rolling, spitfire cadence of Rahzel's beatbox", according to the reviewer. The last line from the song, [...] "Your sweat is salty/ And I am why/ Your sweat is salty/ And I am why", is about how [...] "we were all little jellyfish or whatever before we made it on to land", according to the singer. Elthan Brown from New York magazine considered these lyrics as [...] "frank sensuality". [...] "Oceania" [...] also features The London Choir. Entertainment Weeklys writer Chris Willman commented that [...] "the computer-enhanced choir behind Björk [...] a cosmic harem of pleased dolphins. Here she imagines herself as the sea itself, proud of all the belegged creatures she's spit out onto land over the last hundred million years. It's the nearest evolutionists have come to having their own gospel tune".|$|E
500|$|Bond, already ambitious, asked Gilbert if {{he might}} be able to {{increase}} the size of her role. [...] Gilbert tried to mollify her in a letter, concluding, [...] "I am writing such a particularly good part for you in the new piece that I should be distressed beyond measure if you should leave us. I've never said as much as this to any actor or actress before. I don't say it to induce you to play so insignificant a part as Edith, for if <b>you</b> <b>left</b> us now, and came back to us to play that part, I should be satisfied. But if you didn't play it, my calculations would be all upset, and I should lose a dear little lady for whom I have always had a very special regard." [...] True to Gilbert's word, Edith was followed by a string of roles of increasing importance. [...] First was Lady Angela in Patience (1881–82). [...] Bond did not much like the role, writing later that she did not relate to the sentimental lady of luxury indulging in the aesthetic craze. At the same time, Bond was becoming known to theatregoers and attracting the attention of young men. [...] Having had such bad experiences with romance in the past, Bond ignored such attentions. [...] One poem sent to her by an admirer ran in mock-Gilbertian style as follows (in part): ...|$|E
500|$|The booklet {{contains}} outdated {{discussions of}} health and well-being. Other notes in the booklet, dealing with life and death reflections, {{seem to be more}} personal, like a message typed on one of the last pages, supposedly referring to the loss of a loved one ("I waited all day. You waited all day...but <b>you</b> <b>left</b> before sunset...and I {{just wanted to tell you}} the moment was beautiful. Just wanted to dance to bad music...drive bad cars...watch bad TV...should have stayed for the sunset... if not for me."). The booklet also displays some poems or original sayings not belonging to the songs' lyrics, but to be interpreted as a commentary to the songs and, again, as a reflection on how life should or shouldn't be lived. An example is the poem typed on the [...] "Aye Davanita" [...] page. The song's subtitle is [...] "The song without words", as it is an instrumental track. But the page displays a sort of poem about the wasted life of a young girl. Another episode of [...] "intruder words" [...] is on the [...] "Not for You" [...] lyrics page. After the second refrain, instead of the actual lyrics, the typed words give a hint about the Sisyphus myth ("Yeah, you call me Sisyphus love. Yeah, I move the rock. I just don't want to talk about moving the rock. Anything that distracts me from moving the rock"). The lyrics to [...] "Whipping" [...] are written on a copy of a petition to Bill Clinton against [...] "pro-life" [...] killings of abortion doctors. An X-ray of Vedder's teeth was pictured instead of lyrics on the page for [...] "Corduroy".|$|E
