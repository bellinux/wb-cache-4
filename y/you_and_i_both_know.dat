2500|$|Gilbert {{wrote to}} a colleague, [...] "I {{sometimes}} wish I had never built the Woolworth Building because I fear it may be regarded as my only work and <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>both</b> <b>know</b> that {{whatever it may be}} in dimension and in certain lines it is after all only skyscraper." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, between you, {{keep an eye}} on her," [...] Hunterleys advised. [...] "And, Sidney, I don't want to make {{a coward}} of you, and <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>both</b> <b>know</b> that if there's danger ahead it's our job to face it, but have a care up at the Villa Mimosa. I don't fancy the law of this Principality would see you out of any trouble if they got an idea that you were an English Secret Service man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You will understand," [...] Mannering said, as the brougham drove off, [...] "that you and I are {{speaking}} together merely as friends. I have nothing official {{to say to}} you. It would be presumption on my part {{to assume that the}} time is ripe for anything definite while you are still at the head of an unbeaten Government. But one learns to read the signs of the times. I think that <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>both</b> <b>know</b> that you cannot last the session." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{dare say}} now, uncle Ro, it would strike most Europeans as {{singular}} {{that a man}} {{should be proud of}} having been born an American--Manhattanese, as <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>both</b> were." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now listen, Percival. I {{will put}} our {{position}} plainly before you, as <b>I</b> understand it, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> shall say if I am right or wrong. <b>You</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>both</b> {{came back to}} this house from the Continent with our affairs very seriously embarrassed--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps not, but I like him; for he {{has taught}} me all that I know of woodcraft, and I'm certain that if <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>both</b> leave him he'll be sure {{to return to the}} new {{settlement}} {{at the south end of}} Ontario, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> know what the end of that would be." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Some one has," [...] Crawshay replied bitterly, [...] "and <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>both</b> <b>know</b> who it is, Miss Beverley. But," [...] he went on, {{holding the}} gangway railing {{as she turned}} to descend, [...] "it's only {{the first part of}} the game that's over. Our friend has won on the sea, but I have an idea that we shall have him on land. We shall have him yet, and we'll catch him red-handed if I have {{anything}} to do with it. Will you wish us luck?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{scarcely}} know," [...] Deane said, [...] "how we are {{to continue}} this discussion. For some reason or other, you are sitting there within {{a few feet of}} me and denying something which we both know to be the truth. You have a motive, I suppose, but whatever that motive may be, you cannot imperil it by speaking openly here. We are absolutely alone. There is not a soul within hearing. <b>You</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>both</b> <b>know,</b> Miss Rowan, that you hold that paper to obtain which your brother risked his life and met with such misfortune. It would be his wish, I know, that you should give it to me. The terms I offered him for its recovery were surely liberal. If you think otherwise, tell me your price. We are alone. You are not giving yourself away. Tell me your price!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Harrison," [...] he said, [...] "I am engaged just now, as {{you have}} doubtless surmised, in certain {{investigations}} {{on behalf of the}} usual third party whom we need not name. Those investigations have reached a pitch which might possibly lead me into a position of some--well, I might almost say danger. <b>You</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>both</b> <b>know</b> that there are weapons in this place which can be made use of by persons wholly without scruples, which are scarcely available at home. I want you to keep your eyes open. I have very few friends here whom I can wholly trust. It is my purpose to call in here every morning at ten o'clock for my letters, and if I fail to arrive within half-an-hour of that time without having given you verbal notice, something will have happened to me. You understand what I mean?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{no doubt}} you will get another step, Bull. After the way the {{regiment}} suffered, and with poor Macwitty killed, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>both</b> badly wounded, they are sure to give you your step," [...] and indeed when, on their arrival, they saw the Gazette, they found that both had been promoted.|$|R
6000|$|... "Excellently well arranged, Guy. You thought, Sir John, that I was {{somewhat}} rash {{to leave the}} defence solely {{to the charge of}} this son of yours, but you see the lad was ready at all points, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> will warrant me that the castle would have held out under him as long a time as if <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>both</b> had been in command of it." ...|$|R
60|$|There were ambassadors from Holland that day, to intercede for {{the unhappy}} King, whom <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>both</b> wish the Parliament had spared; {{but they got}} no answer. The Scottish Commissioners interceded too; so did the Prince of Wales, by a letter in which he offered as the next heir to the throne, to accept any {{conditions}} from the Parliament; so did the Queen, by letter likewise.|$|R
6000|$|... "No {{honest man}} will deny it," [...] said the scout, a little nettled at the implied {{distrust}} of his {{explanation of the}} mystery of the tides; [...] "and I grant that it is true on the small scale, and where the land is level. But everything depends on what scale you look at things. Now, on the small scale, the 'arth is level; but on the large scale it is round. In this manner, pools and ponds, and even the great fresh-water lake, may be stagnant, as <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>both</b> <b>know</b> they are, having seen them; but when you come to spread water over a great tract, like the sea, where the earth is round, how in reason can the water be quiet? You might as well expect the river to lie still on the brink of those black rocks a mile above us, though your own ears tell you that it is tumbling over them at this very moment!" ...|$|E
5000|$|Gilbert {{wrote to}} a colleague, [...] "I {{sometimes}} wish I had never built the Woolworth Building because I fear it may be regarded as my only work and <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>both</b> <b>know</b> that {{whatever it may be}} in dimension and in certain lines it is after all only skyscraper." ...|$|E
5000|$|Earlier in the episode, Mrs Doyle {{had been}} {{shopping}} for [...] "tea bags {{shaped like a}} really tall tower." [...] When suddenly a certain Mrs Boyle literally glides up toward her. She demands to know when Eoin will be arriving, and Mrs Doyle cracks, revealing he will be arriving on Sunday. But she pleads with Mrs Boyle not to spread it around, as Eoin wouldn't want anyone to know. Mrs Boyle swears she won't blab: [...] "May I be struck down with every disease that it is known for a middle aged woman to suffer from. And as <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>both</b> <b>know,</b> Mrs Doyle, that's {{a hell of a}} lot of diseases." ...|$|E
60|$|For {{a daring}} and {{dangerous}} enterprise {{of a similar}} character you would to-day be the man of all my acquaintances whom <b>I</b> would select. <b>You</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>both</b> anticipated {{that the cause of}} the country would be advanced by making the attempt to provision Fort Sumter, even if it should fail; and it is no small consolation now to feel that our anticipation is justified by the result.|$|R
5000|$|This is a {{story of}} three swordsmen, Poong-cheon, Seol-rang, and Deok-gi, who led an {{uprising}} during the Goryeo era. When their desire for freedom and justice is about to be fulfilled, Deok-gi betrays them, leading to the death of Poong-cheon, and to Seol-rang disappearing along with Poong-cheon's infant daughter Hong-ee. When Seol-rang leaves, Deok-gi intones the prophecy that [...] "You, no, not just <b>you,</b> but <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>both</b> will be killed by Hong-ee." ...|$|R

5000|$|CBS News' Bailey Johnson contrasted Crosson's rap {{and dancing}} {{performance}} with Obama's [...] "model of confidence, restraint, and calm authority," [...] further stating that Crosson's {{version of the}} speech [...] "seems to perfectly capture the national mood." [...] The San Francisco Chronicle's [...] "City Brights" [...] contributor Zennie Abraham quoted Johnson and added that the video [...] "exactly expresses what <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>both</b> <b>know</b> Barack wanted to say after the Navy Seal Team 6 got to their objective." [...] Al Jazeera 's [...] "Listening Post" [...] remarked that Crosson's satirical interpretation [...] "cuts through the usual diplomatic platitudes and delivers - {{what seems to be}} - a more honest and rhythmically tuned account of what happened." [...] CQ Roll Call Daily Briefing Editor David Hawkings remarked that the video [...] "skewered the president’s 'no drama' affect {{and at the same time}} captured the mood of the country in the days after the Abbottobad raid." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, damn Jocelyn Thew!" [...] Crawshay replied. [...] "I {{should think}} it most unlikely. <b>You</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have <b>both</b> seen the man's dossier. Most cold-blooded person alive." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Franco, I've got to {{send you}} away. It's a hard case, Franco, but <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> must <b>both</b> submit to orders. So go off, Franco, {{as fast as you}} can." ...|$|R
6000|$|Deringham {{watched her}} closely. [...] "I only wished you to {{understand}} the position, and to remember that <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> are <b>both</b> to some extent {{at the mercy of}} our rancher kinsman," [...] he said.|$|R
50|$|The Accafellas are an all-male, collegiate {{a cappella}} group from Michigan State University in East Lansing, Michigan. Founded in 1996, the group {{typically}} has eight (occasionally nine or ten) singers. The Accafellas have released five CDs to date, and are currently producing a sixth. Their arrangement of Jason Mraz's <b>You</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>Both</b> {{appeared on the}} Best of College A Capella (BOCA) compilation in 2006. In 2010, The Accafellas performed their arrangements of Walking in Memphis by Marc Cohn <b>and</b> Would <b>You</b> Go With Me in Nashville, Tennessee before the CMA Music Festival with Josh Turner.|$|R
6000|$|... "Extraordinary!" [...] Frank said, [...] "to {{think that}} <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> should <b>both</b> {{have been through}} this campaign, and on {{opposite}} sides. Why, we must have been within musket shot of each other a score of times." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> are <b>both</b> seconds--and {{these two}} gentlemen can {{obviously}} fight {{in front of}} us. You, he-he, are the king. I am God; really, they could hardly have better supporters. They {{have come to the}} right place." ...|$|R
5000|$|Kyne {{said of his}} novel, [...] "I have at last {{finished}} writing [...] "The Pride of Palomar." [...] It isn't at {{all what}} I wanted it to be; it isn't at all what I planned it to be, but it does contain something of what <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>both</b> feel, something of what {{you wanted me to}} put into it. Indeed, I shall always wish to think that it contains just a few faint little echoes of the spirit of that old California that was fast vanishing when I first disturbed the quiet of the Mission Dolores with infantile shrieks—when you first gazed upon the redwood-studded hills of Sonoma County." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The poor {{creature}} {{is under the}} darkest of clouds. Oh she came to triumph, but she remained to talk something {{in the nature of}} sense! She put herself completely in my hands--she does me the honour to intimate that of all her friends I'm the most disinterested. After she had announced to me that Lord Iffield was utterly committed to her and that for the present I was absolutely {{the only person in the}} secret, she arrived at her real business. She had had a suspicion of me ever since that day at Folkestone when I asked her for the truth about her eyes. The truth is what <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>both</b> guessed. She's in very bad danger." ...|$|R
60|$|ATTEN. <b>I</b> think <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> are <b>both</b> of a mind; {{for just}} now I was {{thinking}} {{to call you}} back to him also. And pray now, since it is your own motion to return again to him, let us discourse {{a little more of}} his quiet and still death.|$|R
5000|$|Lord Lovat {{instructed}} {{his personal}} piper, Bill Millin, to pipe the commandos ashore, {{in defiance of}} specific orders not to allow such an action in battle. When Private Millin demurred, citing the regulations, he recalled later, Lord Lovat replied: “Ah, but that’s the English War Office. <b>You</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> are <b>both</b> Scottish, <b>and</b> that doesn’t apply.” ...|$|R
500|$|After Alberta's {{two most}} {{prominent}} Liberals, Peter Talbot and Frank Oliver, {{made it clear}} that they were not interested, DeVeber considered himself as a possible candidate. [...] Less than two months before Alberta's formal creation, he wrote to his colleague in the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories, Alexander Cameron Rutherford, that the possibilities [...] "practically came to <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I,</b> <b>both</b> of us weak enough God knows but we have the sense to see it." [...] DeVeber's belief that he may be appointed premier does not appear to have been well-founded: his opposition to the introduction of party lines earned him the enmity of some Liberals, not least because it aligned him with Haultain, a Conservative. [...] In the estimation of historian L. G. Thomas, DeVeber's fellow Liberals [...] "were not inclined to take him too seriously" [...] as a potential premier.|$|R
6000|$|... "Pierre {{would have}} us hide him in the shed. I know not how that may {{advantage}} us; {{but let me tell}} you, Saul Ogden, that little Frenchie has got more sound sense in one side of that head of his than <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> in <b>both</b> ours put together. Now do as he has said, and we will listen to him afterwards." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For you! For you I {{will throw}} away money, lives--all the lives but mine! What {{you want is}} a man, a master that will let you put the heel of your shoe on his neck; not that skulker, who will get tired of you in a year--and <b>you</b> of him. <b>And</b> then what? <b>You</b> are not the one to sit still; neither am I. I live for myself, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> shall live for yourself, too--not for a Swedish baron. They make a {{convenience}} of people like <b>you</b> <b>and</b> me. A gentleman is better than an employer, but an equal partnership against all the 'yporcrits is the thing for <b>you</b> <b>and</b> me. We'll go on wandering the world over, <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>both</b> free <b>and</b> both true. <b>You</b> are no cage bird. We'll rove together, for we are of them that have no homes. We are born rovers!" ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1997, the Accafellas {{released}} {{their debut}} album, Accafellas Volume I. It is currently out of print.In 1998, at the University of Michigan’s Monsters of A Cappella concert, the relatively new Accafellas received {{a standing ovation}} from a pro-wolverine crowd.In 2000, the Accafellas released a second album, appropriately [...] "Accafellas Volume II".In 2004, the Accafellas released [...] "Accafellas Volume III". The album feels much more produced than the first two albums, and {{would be a great}} influence on future Accafellas' members as a high-quality album to strive to outdo.In 2006, the Accafellas released [...] "Accafellas Volume IV". Their version of the song <b>You</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>Both</b> originally by Jason Mraz appeared on the Best of College a Cappella compilation that year.On April 4, 2009, the Accafellas released [...] "Accafellas Volume V". The album was recorded at Ryan Wert's Elm Street Recording Studio in Lansing, MI. Ryan Wert claimed that Volume V was [...] "The most ambitious of the CD's (he's) recorded." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Miss Bombien telegraphed me {{you were}} lost, so I came by the first train and have been searching {{everywhere}} for <b>you.</b> Thompson <b>and</b> <b>I</b> had <b>both</b> nearly despaired, for we feared our little ones had been drowned." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Last Monday," [...] Bellamy went on, {{leaning forward}} and {{speaking}} in a soft but very distinct undertone, [...] "a man was murdered late {{at night in the}} heart of the city--within one hundred yards of the Stock Exchange. The papers called it a mysterious murder. No one knows who the man was, or who committed the crime, or why. <b>You</b> <b>and</b> <b>I,</b> Laverick, <b>both</b> know a little more than the rest of the world." ...|$|R
6000|$|Howells condoled {{with him}} on his failure to see the President, [...] "but," [...] he added, [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> had <b>both</b> been there, our {{combined}} [...] skill would have no doubt procured us to be expelled from the White [...] House by Fred Douglass. But the thing {{seems to be a}} complete [...] failure as it was." [...] Douglass at this time being the Marshal of [...] Columbia, gives special point to Howells's suggestion.|$|R
