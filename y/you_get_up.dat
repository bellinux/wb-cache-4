Asked about her daily routine while at primary school, she replied that [...] "when you are young <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> at eight o'clock". In lieu of a solid breakfast she would have café au lait (coffee with milk) or chocolat (hot chocolate) and at noon her father would pick her up from school to have lunch at home before she returned to school for the afternoon.|$|E
500|$|According to Robert Simpson, {{there are}} no reasons for a Category6 on the Saffir–Simpson Scale because it is {{designed}} to measure the potential damage of a hurricane to human-made structures. Simpson stated that [...] "...when <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> into winds in excess of [...] you have enough damage if that extreme wind sustains itself for as much as six seconds on a building it's going to cause rupturing damages that are serious no matter how well it's engineered." [...] Despite his statements, the counties of Broward and Miami-Dade in Florida have building codes which require critical infrastructure buildings to be able to withstand Category5 winds, which contradicts Mr. Simpson's assessment of building strength.|$|E
500|$|MTV {{was first}} to name Lopez {{as one of the}} many {{performers}} to take to the stage at the 2009 American Music Awards. which aired on November 22, 2009. She later confirmed this on a KIIS-FM interview with DJ SKEE, saying that the performance would debut her new single, [...] "Louboutins". The performance took on a boxing theme, and featured famous ring announcer Michael Buffer introducing Lopez to the stage. Lopez performed in a boxing-like outfit and had a costume change halfway through the performance. The performance began in the ring and ended with Lopez walking through the audience. However the performance did not go as planned when the choreographed [...] "dramatic stunt of climbing up a human pyramid of semi-naked male dancers" [...] went wrong. [...] "She lost her balance after jumping off a dancer's back, and landed on her derriere." [...] In E! Online's [...] "Top Five Worst Concert Diggers", Lopez's fall was ranked at number five. However, according to The Daily Mail Natalie Trombetta, Lopez responded in a professional way, [...] "ever the professional, Jennifer quickly recovered her poise and carried on with the show." [...] Close friend and American TV presenter Ryan Seacrest, agreed calling it [...] "the greatest recovery ever!" [...] According to MTV, [...] "the tumble was edited out of the West Coast feed of the show, out of respect for Lopez, by the show's producers". Becky Bain of 'Idolator' suggested that the tumble was more talked about than the actually single itself, which was confirmed when MTV reported {{that it was one of}} the most searched things on the internet. After the incident will.i.am praised Lopez for being a true entertainer. [...] "That shows she's a true entertainer and devoted, She came out of it and still rocked it. It doesn't matter how you fall– just how <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>up.</b> She got up." ...|$|E

2500|$|Unlike most game shows, {{there is}} no minimum age {{necessary}} to participate in [...] "Family Feud." [...] Each round begins with a [...] "face-off" [...] question {{that serves as a}} toss-up between two opposing contestants. The host asks a survey question that was previously posed to a group of 100 people (e.g., [...] "Name the hour that <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> on Sunday mornings."). A certain number of answers are concealed on the board, ranked by popularity of the survey's responses. Only answers that receive two or more responses can appear on the board. The first contestant to buzz-in gives an answer; if it is the most popular, his/her family immediately wins the face-off. Otherwise, the opponent responds and the family member providing the higher-ranked answer wins. Ties are broken in favor of the contestant who buzzes-in first. If neither contestant's answer is on the board, the other eight contestants have a chance to respond, one at a time from alternating sides, until an answer is revealed. The family that wins the face-off may choose to play the question or pass control to their opponents (except on the Combs version, when the family who won the face-off automatically gained control of the question).|$|E
2500|$|The first single, [...] "It's Alright, It's OK", Tisdale said, [...] "is a strong, {{empowering}} {{song that}} kind of helps you move on" [...] and continued to say: I have definitely [...] on and with someone you really like, if they are cheating on you, you don't want to believe it. But, unfortunately, you either stay in the relationship and keep getting hurt because it keeps happening or <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> and you move on. You don't look back. Tisdale said the song [...] "Hot Mess" [...] is [...] "about hanging out with a motorcycle bad boy that makes life more interesting" [...] and the song [...] "How Do You Love Someone" [...] written by Porcelain Black (Alaina Beaton) is [...] "about a girl who deals with the split of her parents". Tisdale also said, the song could be about [...] "When you have been cheated on or you're in a relationship". Black was initially reluctant to let Tisdale record the song, but eventually green-lit the track. However, she recorded her RedOne-produced version which will feature guest vocals by Eminem for her upcoming debut album. Tisdale co-wrote several songs on the album such as [...] "What If", which was co-written with Kara DioGuardi. Tisdale described [...] "What If" [...] as the most personal song on the album, she said the song [...] "is about when you’re in a relationship and you say 'If I really needed you, would you actually be there?’" ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Friday" [...] was {{revealed}} as YouTube's No. 1 video of 2011, with Black hosting a short video called [...] "YouTube Rewind" [...] in the year-end recap. Despite the over 167 million views {{during its first}} four months, prior to its temporary removal, [...] "Friday" [...] had amassed more than 3,190,000 [...] "dislikes". After the fallout with Ark Music Factory, Black started an independent record label named RB Records. She released a self-produced single titled [...] "My Moment" [...] on July 18, 2011, the first on her label, with an accompanying music video published to her YouTube channel the same day. In the video, director Morgan Lawley features real life footage of Black from {{both before and after}} her fame. In late October 2011, production began on the music video for Black's third single, [...] "Person of Interest". About the song, Black stated [...] "The basis of it is that it's a love song but it's not a love song. It's about almost teenage crushes – when you're not in love yet but you really like a guy – which I'm really excited about because I don't think there are too many out like that. It's very much a dance type song. It will make <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> and dance and sing along in your car." [...] The single and its accompanying music video were released on November 15, 2011. Black released two more singles in 2012: [...] "Sing It" [...] in May, and [...] "In Your Words" [...] in November. Black was planning to release her debut album in late 2011, which she said would include [...] "a bunch of different kinds of stuff." [...] The album was being recorded at a studio belonging to music producer Charlton Pettus. However, the album was never released. Black was featured in an ABC Primetime Nightline: Celebrity Secrets special entitled Underage and Famous: Inside Child Stars' Lives.|$|E

2500|$|Wallace Wimple (Thompson, using a {{voice he}} later {{employed}} for the MGM-animated Droopy) – Wimple was a soft-spoken {{man in the}} Caspar Milquetoast vein. He would enter the episode uttering his mush-mouth catchphrase, [...] "Hello, folks!" [...] Wimple might recite a verse he'd written but more often would recount the latest incident in his ongoing battle with Sweetie-Face, his [...] "big old wife” who had the physique and demeanor of a drill sergeant on a bad day. Sweetie-Face was a regular unseen character (actually of course, this being radio, unheard character), appearing in the show only from Wallace's perspective. “Wimp,” as Fibber called him, often reported provoking an overreaction from Sweetie-Face, followed by his attempt at revenge {{in a way that}} could be prankish, painful, or in some stories potentially fatal. One day (03/09/48) when he asked Sweetie-Face what she was doing, Wallace said she told him she was [...] "practicing her weight-lifting." [...] Wallace said he told Sweetie-Face, [...] "My goodness, you do that every time <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> out of a chair.” [...] “Uh oh,” fretted Molly. “And then when I regained consciousness,” continued Wimple, “she'd left the room.” With a typically evil chuckle, Wallace said that he got even by bolting her 200-pound barbell to the floor, causing her to strain so hard the next time she lifted weights that she popped her girdle. Passive-aggressive behavior edging well over the line into domestic violence characterized Wimple's stories. Radio network censors in the 1940s blocked any reference to certain subjects including sex, but the dark humor about domestic violence that was allowed here and in The Honeymooners would likely not be written into a network-TV sitcom today. Though the term “wimp” as used to describe a weak-willed person predated Fibber McGee and Molly, the Wimple character and Fibber's nickname for him may have contributed to a surge in popular use.|$|E
