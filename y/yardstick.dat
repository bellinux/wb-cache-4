5|$|The club can cater for fleets of {{over one}} hundred boats and it hosts large {{national}} events. Normal club racing has fleet starts for the following dinghy classes: Flying Fifteen (keelboat), Laser (dinghy), Solo (dinghy) and Topper (dinghy) {{as well as a}} handicap fleet run under the Portsmouth <b>yardstick</b> scheme. Five slipways enable easy launching. Off the water, the clubhouse facilities include large changing rooms, hot showers, hot food at the weekends, a bar and terrace overlooking the lake. The club caters for disabled people with facilities on both floors and a lift. Royal Yachting Association sailing courses are held at the club for members including race training, youth training, powerboat training, race officer training as well as more informal training run within each fleet.|$|E
5|$|The highway was {{considered}} a <b>yardstick</b> by which limited-access highway construction would be measured. Commission chairman Jones called for more limited-access roads to be built across the country for defense purposes, and the turnpike was {{a model for a}} proposed national network of highways planned during World War II. The Pennsylvania Turnpike led to the construction of other toll roads, such as the New Jersey Turnpike and (eventually) the Interstate Highway System. It has been designated a National Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, {{straight}} {{after finishing}} Cold Feet, Bathurst went straight into filming My Dad's the Prime Minister, a series {{in which he}} portrays fictional British prime minister Michael Philips. The first series was broadcast in a Sunday afternoon CBBC slot in 2003. He watched debates in the House of Commons {{to prepare for the}} role but did not base his portrayal on Tony Blair. In 2003, he returned to theatre {{for the first time in}} four years to play Vershinin in The Three Sisters, opposite Kristin Scott Thomas and Eric Sykes. He had not seen The Three Sisters before starring in it. Director Michael Blakemore advised him to turn this to his advantage, as he would not feel he had to live up to previous portrayals. After its run concluded, a special edition of The Three Sisters was filmed with the same cast for television broadcast on BBC Four. In 2005, the second series of My Dad's the Prime Minister was broadcast, now moved to a Friday night time slot to take advantage of the adult humour. The same year, he starred in the ITV thriller The Stepfather playing Christopher Veazey, a man whose daughter goes missing. Bathurst was pleased that this white-collar worker had an emotional side, in comparison to David Marsden, whom he used as a <b>yardstick</b> when accepting those sorts of roles. Also in 2005, he played Mr Sesseman in an adaptation of Heidi and Dottore Massimo in The Thief Lord.|$|E

25|$|Regarding {{the debate}} {{about the role of the}} liberal {{democratic}} model in peacebuilding, one side contends that liberal democracy is a viable end goal for peacebuilding activities in itself but that the activities implemented to achieve it need to be revised; a rushed transition to democratic elections and market economy can undermine stability and elections held or economic legislation enacted are an inappropriate <b>yardstick</b> for success. Institutional change is necessary and transitions need to be incremental.|$|E

Interested in its ideas but repelled by some of its methods, he could never bring himself to accept Karl Marx's writings as revealed scripture.

25|$|The {{unemployment}} rate was 6.4% in April 2013. There are reported labor shortages in agriculture, mining, and construction.

25|$|Shiki may be {{credited}} with salvaging traditional short-form Japanese poetry and carving out a niche {{for it in}} the modern Meiji period.

He argued that haiku should be judged by the same <b>yardstick</b> that is used when measuring the value of other forms of literature — something that was contrary to views held by prior poets. Shiki firmly placed haiku in the category of literature, and this was unique.|$|E

40|$|In {{a bid to}} {{at least}} {{satisfying}} individual or collective interest in property negotiations, vendors and buyers tend to place <b>yardsticks</b> which inform their decision. These <b>yardsticks</b> {{have been described as}} the anchor and reference point in property negotiation. While the former affects the counteroffer a negotiator makes, the latter determines how an offer is perceived either as a loss or gain. The aim of this work is to determine the influence of the Estate Valuer in determining these <b>yardsticks.</b> A study of 92 Property development companies cutting across the various strata in the study area formed the sample size of this work. The respondents were grouped into two equal groups of vendors and purchasers. It was revealed by the use of the Relative Important Index that record of past similar sales and the total cost of the subject property form the anchor and reference point for vendors respectively, while record of past similar purchases is both the anchor and reference point for the purchasers. The study reveals that Estate Valuers have little or no influence in determining these decisive points and that at best they serve as Estate Agents during negotiations. The researcher opines that the regulatory bodies of The Nigeria...|$|R
25|$|Thus, in 1910, {{the village}} Koùmbi Bouilika {{was removed from}} the map. Its inhabitants, headed by the chief Louissi Sakala, said the elder son of the patriarch Nfouk'-Lassy, were {{expelled}} and expropriated from this land by the will of the settlers in the <b>yardstick</b> of the development of Pointe-Noire. The latter, having not found any suitable sites other than this plateau to build a runway that could accommodate aircraft, have therefore unfortunately relocated to this village which was on the current location of the Agostinho Neto airport of Pointe-Noire. It stretched between the current air base and the Tchinouka River, and was adjacent to the villages of Ntié-Tié, Mboukou, Mpaka, Mpolo, Tchimani, Ngoyo, Tchibambouka, Mpita, Tchinouka, Malala and Tchimbamba.|$|E
25|$|The {{value of}} Riis's {{autobiography}} {{lies in the}} description of his origins as a social reformer. His early experiences in Ribe gave Riis a <b>yardstick</b> with which to measure tenement dwellers’ quality of life. The account of the development of his powers of observation through his experiences as a poor immigrant lent authenticity to his news articles and larger works. Its themes about self-sufficiency, perseverance, and material success are prime examples of an archetype that successful Europeans like Riis used to demonstrate the exceptional opportunities that seem to exist only in the United States. In spite of its triumphalist outlook, The Making of an American remains useful as a source for students of immigration history and sociology who {{want to learn more about}} the author of How The Other Half Lives and the social reform movement that he helped to define.|$|E

These measurements are recorded on a length of a bamboo, which will serves as a kind of <b>yardstick</b> to create the layout of the house compound. The basic units are a depa (fathom), hasta (cubit), and musti (shaftment). Other variation are depa media (vertical version of depa), sedemak (hand), tampak (width of closed fist, with thumb hid) and lengkat (width between a tip of a thumb and the tip of the forefinger if stretched). Kaja-kangin concept is also used in construction. The first post to be erected in a pavilion is always the one at the kaja-kangin corner. An offering platform is attached {{near the top of the}} kaja-kangin post. After the erection of this post, the rest of the posts are erected following clockwise direction. This clockwise principle of erecting posts is a principle repeated all over Indonesia.|$|E

500|$|Much of Noether's work in {{the first}} epoch of her career was {{associated}} with invariant theory, principally algebraic invariant theory. Invariant theory is concerned with expressions that remain constant (invariant) under a group of transformations. As an everyday example, if a rigid <b>yardstick</b> is rotated, the coordinates (x1, y1, z1) and (x2, y2, z2) of its endpoints change, but its length L given by the formula [...] remains the same. Invariant theory was an active area {{of research in the}} later nineteenth century, prompted in part by Felix Klein's Erlangen program, according to which different types of geometry should be characterized by their invariants under transformations, e.g., the cross-ratio of projective geometry.|$|E
