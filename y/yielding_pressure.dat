A detailed analysis of the data makes it possible to extract a general expression for the pressure drop vs flow rate curve through a porous medium as a function of the flow rate and the characteristics of the system. This general law has a form similar to the Herschel-Bulkley model describing the rheological behavior of such fluids in simple shear, i. e. it expresses as the sum of a critical (<b>yielding)</b> <b>pressure</b> drop and a flow rate dependent term. This law involves the rheological parameters of the fluid, one characteristic length of the medium, and two coefficients which only depend on the structure of the porous medium. The first coefficient is related to the path of maximum width throughout the porous medium while the second coefficient reflects the pore size distribution.

Four different analyses were carried out on more than 350 finite element models to determine various failure pressure modes of these storage tanks. An elastic analysis considering potential buckling modes was developed to determine the <b>yielding</b> <b>pressure</b> of the tanks. The redistribution of stresses due to inelastic deformations and plastic collapse were evaluated through an elastic-plastic stress analysis considering the plastic hardening of the material. A wind load analysis was performed to evaluate the stress levels at all regions of the tank and estimate the uplift deformations. Moreover, the increase of the design pressure was investigated regarding the stress levels and bottom uplift. Additionally, an elastic stress analysis following the ASME Boiler 2 ̆ 6 Pressure Vessel Code Section VIII, Division 2, Design-by-Analysis rules was implemented to determine the fatigue life of the storage tanks.

40|$|The {{manufacturing}} {{of steel}} containment vessels {{starts with the}} forming of flat plates into curved plates. A steel containment structure is made by welding individual plates together to form the sections {{that make up the}} complex shaped vessels. The metal forming and welding process leaves residual stresses in the vessel walls. Generally, the effect of metal forming residual stresses can be reduced or virtually eliminated by thermally stress relieving the vessel. In large containment vessels this may not be practical and thus, the residual stresses due to manufacturing may become important. The residual stresses could possibly affect the response of the vessel to internal pressurization. When the level of residual stresses is significant it will affect the vessel's response, for instance the <b>yielding</b> <b>pressure</b> and possibly the failure pressure. This paper will address the effect of metal forming residual stresses on the response of a generic pressure vessel to internal pressurization.

In vitro measurements showed a three-fold increment in the linearly directed dilating force at the interface of the external guidewire and the balloon. ACC/AHA type A or B lesions (n= 10) underwent Gw facilitated PTCA using an 0. 012 ” guidewire as the “cutting wire,” and angiographic results were compare to a control group (n= 37) of lesions undergoing conventional PTCA. The lesions yielded (no “waist”) at 4. 3 Atm in the guidewire facilitated group and at 6. 7 Atm {{in the control group}} (p= 0. 005). During the first inflations, the balloon achieved 52 % of the maximal balloon size at 2 Atm and 82 % at 4 Atm. In the wire facilitated angioplasty group the final diameter stenosis was 21 % vs. 29 % in the control group (p= 0. 001) with a device efficiency (EFF) (final minimal lumen diameter ÷ maximum balloon size) of 0. 76 vs. 0. 60 for the controls (p= 0. 005).

40|$|The binary polymer {{system of}} {{polystyrene}} and poly(n-pentyl methacrylate) was recently found to exhibit closed-loop type phase behavior. This {{is the first}} known example of a weakly interacting system exhibiting such a phase diagram. At atmospheric pressure the block copolymer displays both a lower disorder-to-order and upper-order-to-disorder transition, representing the lower and upper bounds of the closed-loop phase diagram. The application of hydrostatic pressure served to shrink the closed-loop, <b>yielding</b> <b>pressure</b> coefficients of the lower disorder-to-order and upper order-to-disorder transitions of 725 °C/kbar and - 725 °C/kbar respectively. These pressure coefficients were consistent with those calculated from the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, using the experimentally determined ΔHdisorder and ΔV disorder for each transition. The χeff determined from small angle neutron scattering (SANS) was found to decrease, pass through a minimum, increase to a maximum, and then decrease with increasing temperature. Swelling the system with carbon dioxide served to promote {{an expansion of the}} closed-loop. This was due to the entropic nature of both transitions, with differential dilation of the copolymer domains resulting in dissimilar compressibilities of the blocks. In addition to influencing block copolymer phase behavior, carbon dioxide can have a profound impact on resulting morphological structure. A 42 / 58 PS-b-PnPMA diblock copolymer was found to exhibit lamellar morphology at ambient pressures. With the application of 2500 psi carbon dioxide the morphology shifted to hexagonally-packed cylinders due to preferential absorption into the PnPMA block. Furthermore, the influence of carbon dioxide sorption on the morphology of the PS/poly(n-alkyl methacrylate) block copolymer series was studied both in thin films and in the bulk. ...|$|E
40|$|As {{oil and gas}} {{reservoirs}} mature, larger {{volumes of}} water are produced. These large volumes of produced water need to be separated, processed, treated and re-injected into the reservoir. All of these processes impose extra costs to the hydrocarbon production. Water rates can increase until production from a certain field is no longer economical. Therefore, {{there is a need}} to reduce water production. Depending on the nature of the problem, mechanical or chemical methods can be applied to remediate the excessive water problem. This research focused on the use of chemical methods for water shut-off. More specifically, this work is concerned with polymer gels for totally blocking excessive water production. Polymer gels are widely utilized for water shut-off. These chemicals are based on a polymer, a cross-linker and water. The solution is mixed at the surface. In such a case, it is a liquid. Then, this liquid (referred to as gelant) is injected into the target zone of the reservoir. After that, the well is shut-in for a certain time. During this shut-in time, the polymer and the cross-linker of the said gelant react to form a gel. Once the well is put back on production, the formed gel blocks the water flow. In fact, gels can also be applied in injection wells to divert water flow to less permeable zones in order to improve reservoir sweep efficiency. Research presented in this thesis established a systematic investigation methodology for an existing water shut-off chemical. A widely applied chemical is the polyacrylamide tert-butyl acrylate (PAtBA) cross-linked with polyethyleneimine (PEI). First, the gelation mechanisms of this system were explored in terms of published literature. Then, Carbon- 13 Nuclear Magnetic spectroscopy (C- 13 NMR) was used for analyzing the structural changes of the PAtBA copolymer. Gas Chromatography was used for analyzing gas products of the PAtBA thermal decomposition with and without the presence of PEI. The NMR studies indicated that gelation can take place at the amide groups of the PAtBA. Therefore, a more cost-effective polymer to be cross-linked with PEI was proposed, namely, simple polyacrylamide homopolymer (PAM). Research was then devoted to detailed analysis of the proposed system (PAM cross-linked with PEI). Bulk studies were conducted to address its thermal stability and gelation time at various conditions. High temperature glass tubes were used for thermal stability studies and steady shear viscometry was used for measurement of gelation time. The investigation was extended to porous media where the ability of the PAM/PEI system to reduce permeability of reservoir cores was examined. The system was efficient in reducing permeability of reservoir cores to zero for 7 weeks at 90 oC (194 oF). The displacement of the gel from porous media with low viscosity brine was examined with the aid of Computed Tomography. The brine was found to create a flow path within the rock containing the gel after a certain <b>yielding</b> <b>pressure.</b> Then, brine followed this path where no multiple branched fingering was observed. The fingering brine saturation was measured from the CT measurements and compared to theoretical models. In addition, the pressure behavior during gel extrusion from the rock matrix was compared to existing models. The <b>yielding</b> <b>pressure</b> was found to be a function of polymer content of the cured gel. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E

40|$|The Arteriograph, {{a device}} {{basically}} {{consisting of a}} brachial cuff, has recently been launched as a new tool to measure pulse wave velocity (PWV). Brachial blood pressure is measured during supra-systolic pressure inflation of the cuff, <b>yielding</b> <b>pressure</b> waveforms with pronounced first and secondary peaks. The second peak is ascribed to a reflection from the aortic bifurcation, and PWV is calculated as the ratio of 2 times the jugulum-symphysis distance (~ aortic root – bifurcation) and the time {{difference between the two}} peaks (Ts 1 -s 2). To test this working principle, we used a numerical model of the arterial tree to simulate pressure and flow in the normal configuration, and in a configuration with an occluded brachial artery (~supra-systolic over-inflation). A pronounced second peak in the pressure signal was found at the location of the cuff for the occluded configuration. Wave intensity analysis showed that this peak was caused by a forward compression wave, confirming the Arteriograph hypothesis. Simulations with 6 different stiffness values showed a linear correlation between 1 /Ts 1 -s 2 and PWV (R²= 0. 97). It was, however, hard to locate the reflection site which, in combination with the transit time, reproduced the correct PWV. The distance to the aortic bifurcation was 45 cm, whereas the effective length of the simulated arterial tree was 27 ± 3 cm. The distance needed to reproduce PWV from Ts 1 -s 2 was 70 ± 6 cm. In conclusion, although the numerical model supports the basic working principle of the Arteriograph, measurement of actual PWV using the device might be more challenging...|$|E
