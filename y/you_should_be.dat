500|$|Criticism was {{leveled at}} the game's {{difficult}} gameplay {{due to the}} scarcity of health and ammunition. The weak artificial intelligence of enemies and superficial stealth mechanics were also noted. According to GameSpot, [...] "in theory <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> sneaking up on enemies, defusing bombs, and saving hostages. In practice, however, enemies turn around and attack even when you're sneaking up on them and defusing bombs requires no effort, so the suggestion of strategy is moot." [...] The size of the player character was also a subject of criticism {{because it does not}} allow players to properly see their immediate surroundings, prompting them to accidentally alert nearby enemies. Although the different mini-games were highlighted, reviewers felt that they were clearly imitative of games like Spy Hunter and Operation Wolf.|$|E

I would never do an impression of anybody else or try and improve on what they did. That would be a pointless exercise for me." [...] His own favourite Bond film is From Russia with Love. On an episode of The South Bank Show, Connery divulged his thoughts on Craig's casting as Bond, whom he described as [...] "fantastic, marvellous in the part". When told that Craig had taken particular note of his performances, Connery said that he was [...] "flattered" [...] and that Craig really gets the [...] "danger element" [...] to Bond's character.

500|$|Critics {{praised the}} {{departure}} from other popular titles such as Square Enix's Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts series.

[...] Some reviewers also complained that the Stride Cross Battle System was too complex for new players; Eurogamer's review felt the [...] "sink or swim" [...] reliance on learning the complex battle system was a significant stumbling block for the game.
