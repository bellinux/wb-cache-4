500|$|It is {{doubtful}} {{whether it was}} possible for Speyer to resign from the Privy Council or as a baronet, there being no normal mechanism to do so, but the Prime Minister's response was supportive: [...] "I have known you long, and well enough to estimate at their true value these baseless and malignant imputations upon your loyalty to the British Crown. The King is not prepared to take any step such as <b>you</b> <b>suggest</b> in regard to the marks of distinction which you have received in recognition of public services and philanthropic munificence." [...] On 26 May 1915, Speyer and his family left for America.|$|E

[...] From August 1903, Younghusband and his escort commander at Khamba Jong, Lt-Col Herbert Brander, tried to provoke the Tibetans into a confrontation. The British took a few months to prepare for the expedition which pressed into Tibetan territories in early December 1903 following an act of [...] "Tibetan hostility", which was afterwards established by the British resident in Nepal to have been the herding of some trespassing Nepalese yaks and their drovers back across the border. When Younghusband telegrammed the Viceroy, in an attempt to strengthen the British Cabinet's support of the invasion, that intelligence indicated Russian arms had entered Tibet, Curzon privately silenced him. [...] "Remember that in the eyes of HMG we are advancing not because of Dorjyev, or Russian rifles in Lhasa, but because of our Convention shamelessly violated, our frontier trespassed upon, our subjects arrested, our mission flouted, our representations ignored." ...|$|E

60|$|LEVER. I didn't want to come. I don't {{understand}} why <b>you</b> <b>suggested</b> it. [MRS. GWYN is silent.] It's been a mistake.|$|R
6000|$|... “You made {{a curious}} remark about boldness paying, when <b>you</b> <b>suggested</b> coming here. Did {{you know that}} young man was in charge?” ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Longdon {{considered}} this with visible intensity. [...] "What <b>you</b> <b>suggest</b> {{is that the}} things you speak of depend on other people?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But supposing {{all this}} turned out as <b>you</b> <b>suggest</b> it might, how could {{even the best}} {{disposed}} friend {{do anything to help}} us?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'I think I {{should tell}} you that I did as <b>you</b> <b>suggested</b> to me. I asked Alec MacKenzie pointblank, and he confessed that he was guilty of George's death.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because you are {{responsible}} for the whole affair. You introduced Douglas to her. <b>You</b> <b>suggested</b> that he should bring her home. Go to her to-morrow and ascertain her intentions." ...|$|R
