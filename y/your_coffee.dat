The Oakland Athletics talked about moving their stadium to this area. The large Asian population in Mission San Jose comes to Warm Springs for authentic Asian stores such as the 99 Ranch & Marina Food supermarkets, {{as well as more}} traditional supermarkets such as Safeway.

[...] He left two Confederate officers {{who had been}} wounded and captured by Averell's troops, a sack of coffee, and the following message: [...] "Dear Fitz, Here's <b>your</b> <b>coffee.</b> Here's your visit. How do you like it?" [...] Some of his fellow officers believed that he lost his nerve, concerned {{about the presence of}} Jeb Stuart on the battlefield and, hearing the sound of railroad cars approaching, imagining the possibility of a Confederate infantry force pinning him against the river. The Union advance had covered 2 miles over more than 12 hours and resulted in 78 casualties (6 killed, 50 wounded, 22 missing). The Confederates lost 133 (11 dead, 88 wounded, 34 captured); 71 Confederate horses were killed and 12 were captured. The loss of the youthful Pelham, age 24, well respected by Robert E. Lee, Stuart, and many veterans of the Battle of Fredericksburg, was a shock. Stuart wrote after the battle, [...] "The gallant Pelhamso noble, so truewill be mourned by the nation." ...|$|E

It's a diversion to take along with <b>your</b> after-meal <b>coffee</b> and dessert. Garner's western suavity is the only grace note. Few performers have generated the sort of good will that Garner has, and this may be the most solid work he's ever done in the movies. The figure he cuts is an evocative one.

We and the other things we see around us are part of a continuous whole, and we have direct access to them through vision, touch, etc. However, the philosophical tradition tries to drive a wedge between us and the world by insisting that the information we get from perception is the result of inference from indirect evidence that is about how things look and feel to us.
