A cut that is off-rhythm will be disturbing and you will feel it, unless <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be like that.

Out of our four records, I thought this might be the one where you're driving down the road listening to it on a sunny summer day." [...] Rawlings again produced the record. The album also reflected a change in the typically sparse instrumentation: Welch and Rawlings introduced a dobro, violin, electric bass and drums, and Welch later said, [...] "Everything's not supposed to sound the same, <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> reflect change and growth." ...|$|E

500|$|The nudity was {{optional}} for the performers. The French cast was [...] "the nudest" [...] of {{the foreign}} groups, while the London cast [...] "found nudity the hardest to achieve." [...] The Swedish cast was reluctant to disrobe, but in Copenhagen, the tribe thought the nudity too tame and decided to walk naked {{up and down the}} aisle during the show's prelude. In some early performances, the Germans played their scene behind a big sheet labeled [...] "CENSORED". Original Broadway cast member Natalie Mosco said, [...] "I was dead set against the nude scene at first, but I remembered my acting teacher having said that part of acting is being private in public. So I did it." [...] According to Melba Moore, [...] "It doesn't mean anything except what <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> mean. We put so much value on clothing. .... It's like so much else people get uptight about." [...] Donna Summer, who was in the German production, said that [...] "it was not meant to be sexual. ... We stood naked to comment on the fact that society makes more of nudity than killing." [...] Rado said that [...] "being naked in front of an audience, you're baring your soul. [...] Not only the soul but the whole body was being exposed. It was very apt, very honest and almost necessary." ...|$|E

2500|$|Dare {{was almost}} universally {{critically}} acclaimed in the UK, and featured {{strongly in the}} year end polls for 1981. In Melody Maker Steve Sutherland celebrated the fact the album would irritate the guitar-rock traditionalists, saying, [...] "All let's-pretend-pompous it's cornily consistent, cultured, crude, elegant, cheap... anything <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be. Me? I think it's a masterpiece. Sure to upset some, sell to millions more and so it should the way it tramps all over rock traditions. A trite sound, a retarded glam image and a mock respect. All the appeal in the world... Dare should show up the pathetic farce of pop mythology once and for all." [...] Smash Hits critic David Hepworth called it [...] "chock-full of precise, memorable melodies delivered with style and humour". Noted music critic Paul Morley wrote in the NME, [...] "Dare is the second intoxicating intervention to be produced out of the great split , and already it's the first Human League greatest hits collection... Much more than ABBA or whoever you like, The Human League signify that deliciously serious, sincerely disposable MOR music can possess style, quality and sophistication... I think that Dare {{is one of the}} GREAT popular music LPs." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some reviewers have criticised the game's control system. Eurogamers review {{stated that}} the jump timing {{sometimes}} feels [...] "off by {{a fraction of a}} fraction of a second" [...] and that this can be a minor annoyance when attempting challenges which require dexterity and timing. In IGNs review, Chris Roper also reported issues with the control system stating that the game's heavily physics-based gameplay [...] "left a few corners on {{what should have been a}} razor-sharp control scheme". He goes on to say that the character acceleration and deceleration [...] "isn't as quick as it could be" [...] but that his biggest complaint is the way the game handles player movement between foreground, middleground and background on the 2.5D plane. He says that [...] "there are instances where it doesn't do what <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> do, and these points stick out like a sore thumb." [...] This is an issue that has been raised by Media Molecule's co-founder Mark Healey who stated in an interview that [...] "The Z [...] movement is an incredibly hard thing for us to get right.

2500|$|In {{his text}} Buddho Ajahn Thate {{describes}} {{what it is}} like when the mind has finally rid itself of preoccupation with sensual distractions and is able to focus on the breath, mantra, or a part of the body, in meditation: [...] "When you first enter concentration, this is what it's like: [...] You'll have no idea at all of what concentration or one-pointedness of mind is going to feel like. You are simply intent on keeping mindfulness firmly focused on one object – and the power of a mind focused firmly on one object is what will bring you to a state of concentration. You won't be thinking at all that concentration will be like this or like that, or that <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be like this or like that. It will simply take its own way, automatically. No one can force it. At that moment you will feel as if you are in another world (the world of the mind), with a sense of ease and solitude to which nothing else in the world can compare. When the mind withdraws from concentration, you will regret that that mood has passed, and you will remember it clearly. All that we say about concentration comes from the mind which has withdrawn from that state. As long as it is still gathered in that state, we aren't interested in what anyone else says or does. You have to train the mind to enter this sort of concentration often, so as to become skilled and adept, but don't try to remember your past states of concentration, and don't let yourself want your concentration to be like it was before – because it won't be that way, and you will just be making more trouble for yourself." ...|$|E

5000|$|The trio knew {{director}} John Landis, {{who encouraged}} them to write a film based on their theatre sketches. They managed to put the film, called The Kentucky Fried Movie, in production in the late 1970s, and entered a movie set for the first time. David Zucker explains: [...] "It {{was the first time}} we had ever been on a movie set. We learned a lot. We learned that if <b>you</b> really <b>wanted</b> a movie to come out the way <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> <b>to,</b> <b>you</b> had to direct.
