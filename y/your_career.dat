Later that year, after he complained of numerous physical ailments, his doctors diagnosed him with diabetes, a disease that also afflicted his brothers. Although Robinson adopted an insulin injection regimen, the state of medicine at the time could not prevent the continued deterioration of Robinson's physical condition from the disease.|$|E

[...] Maxim has consistently ranked Kunis on its Hot 100 list, reaching a ranking of number 5 in both 2009 and 2011 and number 3 in 2012. Esquire magazine named her 2012's Sexiest Woman Alive.

She has credited Celia Franca, the Artistic Director, as being an important influence and coach during her development as a ballet dancer.

In an interview with Rose Eichenbaum, Van Hamel said, [...] "I think there is a small window in <b>your</b> <b>career</b> when you have some control."

500|$|Delany {{auditioned for}} the role of Bree for the series' pilot episode in 2004. Cherry offered her the role three times, but she {{rejected}} it, and Marcia Cross was hired soon after. Delany turned down the role because she believed the Bree character was too similar to her character on Pasadena. Cherry acknowledged that while Delany captured the slyness he had originally intended for the character, Cross ultimately became the better choice: [...] "Marcia, who {{will be the first to}} tell you, 'I'm not funny, I never get the joke,' her Bree was kind of oblivious to her own Breeness. Interestingly enough, when we went forward with the show, it became a much funnier character than I envisioned." [...] While developing the Katherine character, Cherry immediately offered the role to Delany. [...] "That's unusual in Hollywood," [...] Delany commented. [...] "Usually when you say 'no,' they hold it against you for the rest of <b>your</b> <b>career.</b> I've experienced that." ...|$|E

500|$|Before {{the show}} went on air, Osbourne bet Bruce and Utsler $50,000 that Insane Clown Posse's next album {{would not even}} sell 200,000 copies—a bet that Bruce accepted. On air Osbourne {{informed}} Bruce and Utsler that Coal Chamber filed a lawsuit for breach of contract. Osbourne stated that her group was to receive $12,500 per show for a scheduled two-month package tour. Bruce reiterated that Coal Chamber's music did not appeal to Insane Clown Posse fans, and that ticket refunds decreased after Coal Chamber {{had been removed from}} the tour. Osbourne then made public the bet with Bruce about Insane Clown Posse's next album, also stating that the duo would be subsequently dropped from their distributor. In Osbourne's words, [...] "You're dead. <b>Your</b> <b>career</b> is over." [...] Bruce predicted that the group's next album would sell at least 500,000 copies; however, the bet officially stood at 200,000 copies as agreed by both Bruce and Osbourne backstage.|$|E
500|$|Blink-182 was the band's first {{release on}} Geffen, which absorbed sister label MCA Records in 2003. Prior to it dissolving, MCA had {{attempted}} to penalize the band for breaking stipulations in their contract {{that they would have}} an album out by a specific quarter. MCA had previously rushed the band into recording Take Off Your Pants and Jacket, but the band had much more freedom with Geffen. [...] "Geffen came down and heard three songs and they said, 'This is the best record you've ever done, this is the record of <b>your</b> <b>career,</b> take as much time as you want, call us when it's done.' It just completely outlined the perspective of putting accounting before creative, and when you're in the entertainment business, you've got to put creative first. It's an art, you've got to look at it like an art, treat it like an art, and then you'll get the best product in the long run." ...|$|E
500|$|On January 8, 2002 Smith learned via a {{phone call}} he had been elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame on his first ballot by {{receiving}} 91.7% of the votes cast. As it happened, the Olympic torch was passing through St. Louis {{on its way to}} Salt Lake City for the 2002 Winter Olympics, and Smith served as a torchbearer in a ceremony with St. Louis Rams' quarterback Kurt Warner that evening. Smith was inducted into the Hall of Fame during ceremonies on July 28, 2002. During his speech, he compared his baseball experiences with the characters from the novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, after which his son Dustin presented his Hall of Fame plaque. Days later on August 11, Smith was back at Busch Memorial Stadium for the unveiling of a statue in his likeness made by sculptor Harry Weber. Weber chose to emphasize Smith's defensive skills by showing Smith stretched horizontal to the ground while fielding a baseball. At the ceremony Weber told Smith, [...] "You spent half of <b>your</b> <b>career</b> up in the air. That makes it difficult for a sculptor to do something with it." ...|$|E

500|$|The song's {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Nigel Dick and filmed on June 14 and 15, 1999 at the Redondo Beach, California. Spears conceptualized the video's treatment, and explained during an interview with MTV in 1999 that [...] "it would be cool {{to be in a}} club, and we're dorky waitresses, and we break out and start dancing." [...] At the time, Spears expected that the video would take her [...] "to the next level". To promote the film Drive Me Crazy, actors Adrian Grenier and Melissa Joan Hart were invited to make cameo appearances in the video, since the song had been included on the film's soundtrack, however, Grenier did not want to participate. Dick commented on the issue, saying, [...] "I was given instructions to ring him up and make sure he appeared in the video. I said, 'You know what, Adrian, I just think it would be great for <b>your</b> <b>career,</b> and Britney's a great girl and she's fun to work with.' Eventually he came around."

500|$|A remixed {{version of}} [...] "Till the World Ends", {{featuring}} Kesha and rapper Nicki Minaj, was leaked online on April 22, 2011. The same day, three countdowns with {{lines of the}} song appeared on the official websites of Spears, Kesha and Minaj. The Femme Fatale Remix was released on iTunes on April 25, 2011. The same day, Spears uploaded {{a picture of the}} cover art to her Twitter account. Kesha told MTV News, [...] "I'm a massive fan of both the ladies I share the track with. I wrote 'TTWE' for Britney [...] and she killed it and I loved it, but I just thought a supergroup of three hot, strong women could just take over the airwaves." [...] The remix adds heavier bass during the beginning, and starts with Minaj rapping with intensity about a female hater, in lines such as [...] "Told you they'd revive <b>your</b> <b>career,</b> but somebody lied/ I ain't talkin' poultry when I say this chicken's fried." [...] This continues by Spears singing the first verse, after which Minaj says [...] "It's Britney, bitch. I'm Nicki Minaj and that's Kesha!", and the first chorus is sung by the latter. Spears continues with the song and is accompanied by Kesha {{towards the end of the}} second verse and the bridge. The remix also features a dubstep breakdown, reminiscent of [...] "Hold It Against Me".|$|E
500|$|... "One Wonderful Day" [...] also {{introduced}} the second-season mystery surrounding Betty Applewhite (Alfre Woodard) and Matthew Applewhite (Mehcad Brooks). Cherry revealed, [...] "they {{come on the}} street; they seem like nice people — but they've got a secret. And it's pretty gothic. It's real and human and awful {{all at the same}} time." [...] Another scene featuring the Applewhite family, in which Betty brings food to a prisoner in their basement, was cut from this episode but was used in the second season premiere, [...] "Next". Cherry's inspiration for the Lynette storyline came from his own childhood experience when his mother returned to work. He commented: [...] "The predicament of any working woman is that you can love <b>your</b> <b>career,</b> but there is something... to be said for getting to stay home every day with your kids, and you don't want anyone else to be better at it than you are. Felicity Huffman expressed satisfaction with how her storyline was handled, explaining that Lynette [...] "didn't deal with [...] in the most straightforward way, but she was fighting for her family. They were noble motives." [...] While discussing the courtroom scene in which Carlos attacks John, Ricardo Antonio Chavira commented: [...] "People can see the full rage that is in my character. I'm yelling at him, 'I'm gonna kill you'... Then I broke into Spanish: [...] "Yo voy a matar!"... I just went for it... Then I looked, and Jesse [...] had the most honest look of sheer terror.
