5|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance is named {{when it reaches}} moderate tropical storm strength. If a {{tropical disturbance}} reaches moderate tropical storm status west of 55°E, then the Sub-regional Tropical Cyclone Advisory Centre in Madagascar assigns the appropriate name to the storm. If a tropical disturbance reaches moderate tropical storm status between 55°E and 90°E, then the Sub-regional Tropical Cyclone Advisory Centre in Mauritius assigns the appropriate name to the storm. A new annual list is used every <b>year</b> <b>so</b> no names are retired.|$|E

5|$|Again, {{this is a}} simplification, {{based on}} a {{hypothetical}} Earth that orbits at uniform speed around the Sun. The actual speed with which Earth orbits the Sun varies slightly during the <b>year,</b> <b>so</b> {{the speed with which}} the Sun seems to move along the ecliptic also varies. For example, the Sun is north of the celestial equator for about 185 days of each year, and south of it for about 180 days. The variation of orbital speed accounts for part of the equation of time.|$|E

5|$|The {{gestation}} period for cats is between 64 and 67 days, {{with an average}} of 66 days. The size of a litter usually is three to five kittens, with the first litter usually smaller than subsequent litters. Kittens are weaned between six and seven weeks old, and cats normally reach sexual maturity at 5–10 months (females) and to 5–7 months (males), although this can vary depending on breed. Females can have two to three litters per <b>year,</b> <b>so</b> may produce up to 150 kittens in their breeding span of around ten years.|$|E

5|$|To {{continue}} his studies, Champollion {{wanted to go}} to Paris, Grenoble offering few possibilities for such specialized subjects as ancient languages.

Before leaving however Champollion presented, on the 1st September 1807, his Essay on the Geographical Description of Egypt before the Conquest of Cambyses before the Academy of Grenoble whose members were so impressed that they admitted him to the Academy six months later.|$|E
5|$|Worldwide, {{there are}} now about 1800 botanical gardens and arboreta in about 150 {{countries}} (mostly in temperate regions) of which about 550 are in Europe (150 {{of which are in}} Russia), 200 in North America, and an increasing number in East Asia. These gardens attract about 150 million visitors a <b>year,</b> <b>so</b> {{it is hardly surprising that}} many people gained their first exciting introduction to the wonders of the plant world in a botanical garden.|$|E
5|$|As a freshman, he {{was given}} a redshirt <b>year</b> <b>so</b> he did not play during the team's 2005 {{national}} championship season. He served as the quarterback for the scout team in practice against the starting defense. During this time, Matt McCoy (no relation) was officially listed as the number three quarterback behind Vince Young and Matt Nordgren. When Brown chose to play Matt McCoy in four separate game situations where Texas had a commanding lead, confusion arose as to which McCoy was in the game. Many sportscasters mistakenly referred to Matt McCoy as Colt McCoy, as Colt was the more widely known player. The following year, with Young forgoing his senior year to enter the NFL and Nordgren graduating, the position of starting quarterback for the defending National Champion Texas Longhorns came down to a competition between redshirt freshman Colt McCoy and true freshman newcomer Jevan Snead.|$|E

Bolt enlisted in the Marine Corps Reserve in April 1941 to train as a pilot, but deferred his training when the Marine Corps offered him the chance to finish college and attend law school, paying him 500 a year to do so.|$|E
5|$|Busch {{studied for}} nearly four years at Hanover, despite initial {{difficulties}} in understanding the subject matter. A few months before graduation he confronted his parents with his aspiration to study at the Düsseldorf Art Academy. According to Bush's nephew Hermann Nöldeke, his mother supported this inclination. His father eventually acquiesced and Busch moved to Düsseldorf in June 1851, where, to his disappointment at not being admitted to the advanced class, he entered preparatory classes. Busch's parents had his tuition fees paid for one <b>year,</b> <b>so</b> in May 1852 he traveled to Antwerp to continue study at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts under Josephus Laurentius Dyckmans. He led his parents {{to believe that the}} Academy was less regimented than Düsseldorf, and had the opportunity to study old masters. At Antwerp he saw for the first time paintings by Peter Paul Rubens, Adriaen Brouwer, David Teniers and Frans Hals. The pictures aroused his interest, but made him doubt his own skills. Eventually, in 1853, after suffering heavily from typhus, he abandoned his Antwerp studies and returned penniless to Wiedensahl.|$|E
5|$|Disney was keen {{to promote}} Mulan to the Chinese, hoping to {{replicate}} their {{success with the}} 1994 film The Lion King, {{which was one of}} the country's highest-grossing Western films at that time. Disney also hoped it might smooth over relations with the Chinese government which had soured after the release of Kundun, a Disney-funded biography of the Dalai Lama that the Chinese government considered politically provocative. China had threatened to curtail business negotiations with Disney over that film and, as the government only accepts ten Western films per year to be shown in their country, Mulans chances of being accepted were low. Finally, after a year's delay, the Chinese government did allow the film a limited Chinese release, but only after the Chinese New <b>Year,</b> <b>so</b> as to ensure that local films dominated the more lucrative holiday market. Box office income was low, due to both the unfavorable release date and rampant piracy. Chinese people also complained about Mulan's depiction as too foreign-looking and the story as too different from the myths.|$|E

5|$|During a 1910s {{excavation}} for a sewer pipe, {{stones were}} unearthed that were suspected {{to be from}} the old van der Donck estate. During World War I, the Parade Ground was used to train soldiers. Eight tennis courts opened in 1914 with admission being $1 per person, and owing to the Van Cortlandt Golf Course's immense popularity, the Mosholu Links also opened that year. By 1917, the Parade Ground contained 10 out of the park's baseball diamonds. The park's recreational facilities were quite popular, with more than 10,000 people using them on a busy day. However, during and following World War I, the Parade Ground was used for war training. Until 1926, the baseball fields did not contain backstops, and had to be vacated by July 4 of every <b>year,</b> <b>so</b> the National Guard could use the field.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, Wilder {{relocated}} to Paris, accepting {{a leading role}} in Bud Yorkin's Start the Revolution Without Me, a comedy that took place during the French Revolution. After shooting ended, Wilder returned to New York, where he read the script for Quackser Fortune Has a Cousin in the Bronx and immediately called Sidney Glazier, who produced The Producers. Both men began searching for the perfect director for the film. Jean Renoir was the first candidate, but {{he would not be able}} to do the film for at least a <b>year,</b> <b>so</b> British-Indian director Waris Hussein was hired. With Margot Kidder co-starring with Wilder, it was filmed on location in Dublin, and at the nearby Ardmore Studios, in August and September 1969.|$|E
5|$|Mercator {{now turned}} to the modern maps, as author but no longer engraver: the practicalities of {{production}} of maps and globes had been passed to his sons and grandsons. In 1585 he issued a collection of 51 maps covering France, the Low Countries and Germany. Other maps may have followed in good order had not the misfortunes of life intervened: his wife Barbara died in 1586 and his eldest son Arnold died the following <b>year</b> <b>so</b> that only Rumold and the sons of Arnold were left to carry forward his business. In addition, {{the time he had}} available for cartography was reduced by a burst of writing on philosophy and theology: a substantial written work on the Harmonisation of the Gospels as well as commentaries on the epistle of St. Paul and the book of Ezekiel.|$|E

5|$|On September 25, manager Bruce Bochy {{decided to}} give Zito one final start with the Giants {{as a tribute to}} his tenure with the team. Zito responded by {{allowing}} two runs (one earned) over five innings and earning the win in a 7–4 victory over the Dodgers. However, because Zito was removed between innings during the Dodger game, Bochy sent him in to pitch in relief in the final game of the <b>year</b> <b>so</b> that Giants' fans could give him a standing ovation. Zito entered with two outs in the eighth inning on September 29 and struck out Mark Kotsay (playing his final game) as the Giants beat the Padres 7–6. He finished the 2013 season at 5–11 with a 5.74 ERA in 30 games, 25 of which were starts. Following the season, Zito took out a full-page ad in the San Francisco Chronicle thanking Giants fans for their support. The Giants declined Zito's 2014 option, buying it out for $7 million.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Atlus {{picking up}} the title, Vanillaware had {{encountered}} difficulties finding a publisher due to Kamitani's sparse record as a developer. Completed in 2006, Odin Sphere was delayed into the following <b>year</b> <b>so</b> it would not compete with Atlus' own titles. The localization was handled by Atlus USA, and proved challenging in multiple areas. Upon release, it garnered a positive reception from video game journalists: praise was given to its story, visuals and old-school gameplay, with criticism focused on its inventory system and framerate issues. Leifthrasir was praised for its improved performance and reworked mechanics. The game was a commercial success, contributing {{to the rise of}} Vanillaware as a developer.|$|E
5|$|The German Imperial Navy (Kaiserliche Marine) ordered Westfalen {{under the}} {{provisional}} name Ersatz Sachsen {{as a replacement}} for , the lead ship of the elderly s. The Reichstag secretly approved and provided funds for Nassau and Westfalen at the end of March 1906, but construction on Westfalen was delayed while arms and armor were procured. She was laid down on 12 August 1907 at the AG Weser shipyard in Bremen. As with her sister , construction proceeded swiftly and secretly; detachments of soldiers guarded both the shipyard and the major contractors who supplied building materials, such as Krupp. The ship was launched on 1 July 1908, underwent an initial fitting-out, and then in mid-September 1909 was transferred to Kiel by a crew composed of dockyard workers for a final fitting-out. However, the water level in the Weser River was low at this time of <b>year,</b> <b>so</b> six pontoons had to be attached to the ship to reduce her draft. Even so, it took two attempts before the ship cleared the river.|$|E
