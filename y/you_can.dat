60|$|Whose {{fault is}} it? Yours, gentlemen; yours only. <b>You</b> alone <b>can</b> feed them, and clothe, and bring into their right minds, for <b>you</b> only <b>can</b> govern--that is to say, <b>you</b> only <b>can</b> educate them.|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{was only}} one letter," [...] broke out Helen,--"only a very little one--only a few words. Here it is--Oh--how <b>can</b> <b>you,</b> how <b>can</b> <b>you</b> speak so?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There must be something," [...] {{continued}} Mrs. Oakley. [...] "When I {{was your}} age I had taught myself bookkeeping, shorthand, and typewriting. What <b>can</b> <b>you</b> do? <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> use a typewriter?" ...|$|R
5|$|I {{have already}} made {{investigations}} {{about you and your}} people and I have verified your ability to make a deal. Now then, I am prepared to sell you one million Jews... Goods for blood– blood for goods. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> take them from any country you like, wherever <b>you</b> <b>can</b> find them– Hungary, Poland, the Ostmark, from Theresienstadt, from Auschwitz, wherever you like.|$|E
5|$|It’s {{a deadly}} time {{in so many}} ways to be in a band; <b>you</b> <b>can</b> have so much control over your work if you’re clever; <b>you</b> <b>can</b> release it how and when you like and in our opinion, right now, Ireland is the healthiest it’s ever been in terms of talent and diversity.|$|E
5|$|Now, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> win. You {{will not}} be a favorite; you'll be rather a long shot. But given luck and money and {{a hell of a lot}} of work, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> win... but for Christ's sake don't commit suicide with no dough... Maybe you can't crucify mankind on a cross of gold, but <b>you</b> <b>can</b> sure as hell crucify a statewide {{candidate}} upon a cross of no-gold.|$|E
6000|$|... 'You do know all,' he {{at length}} exclaimed. 'And <b>can</b> <b>you,</b> knowing all, {{live under the}} same roof with me? <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> see me? <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> listen to me? Is not my voice torture to you? Do you not hate and despise me?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But she is true--truer {{even than}} truth--and I {{have come back}} to claim my {{unrivalled}} bride. <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> pardon me? <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> sympathise with me?' ...|$|R
60|$|HYPATIA. I {{like talking}} to <b>you.</b> I <b>can</b> let myself go with <b>you.</b> I <b>can</b> say things to you I cant say to other people.|$|R

Have you peace within yourself? {{and do you}} radiate {{it around}} you? That is called spiritual growth, which is stimulated by {{meditation}} inwardly, and by work done {{in a spirit of}} service outwardly." ...|$|R

5|$|I never agreed, {{even as a}} young person, {{with the}} Thomas Wolfe title You Can't Go Home Again. Instinctively I didn’t. But the truth is, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> never leave home. You take it with you; it’s under your fingernails; it’s in the hair follicles; it’s {{in the way you}} smile; it’s in the ride of your hips, in the passage of your breasts; it’s all there, no matter where you go. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> take on the affectations and the postures of other places and even learn to speak their ways. But the truth is, home is between your teeth.|$|E

6000|$|The {{merchant}} {{looked at}} his son in astonishment, and answered: 'What <b>can</b> <b>you</b> mean? How <b>can</b> <b>you</b> explain what the sparrows say? Do you consider yourself a soothsayer or a magician?' ...|$|R

5|$|No. There’s {{always going}} to be two sides to {{everything}}. For me, everything that I did with the Harajuku Girls was just a pure compliment and being a fan. You can’t be a fan of somebody else? Or another culture? Of course <b>you</b> <b>can.</b> Of course <b>you</b> <b>can</b> celebrate other cultures. That’s what Japanese culture and American culture have done. It’s like I say in the song: it’s a ping-pong match. We do something American, they take it and they flip it and make it so Japanese and so cool. And we take it back and go, “Whoa, that’s so cool!” That’s so beautiful. It’s a beautiful thing in the world, how our cultures come together. I don’t feel like I did anything but share that love. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> look at it from a negative point of view if you want to, but get off my cloud. Because, seriously, that was all meant out of love.|$|E

My name's Alf Gibson, and I want to go out with you." [...] I said, [...] "Well, <b>can</b> <b>you</b> shoe? <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> ride? <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> starve? <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> go without water? And how would you like to be speared by the blacks outside?" [...] He said he could do everything I had mentioned, and he wasn't afraid of the blacks. He was not a man I would have picked out of a mob, but men were scarce, and as he seemed so anxious to come, and as I wanted somebody, I agreed to take him." ...|$|R
