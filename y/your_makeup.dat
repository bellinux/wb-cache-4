Divine kept his involvement with Waters and these early underground films a secret from his conservative parents, believing {{that they would not}} understand them or the reason for his involvement in such controversial and bad-taste films; they would not find out about them for many years. Divine's parents had bought him his own beauty shop in Towson, hoping that the financial responsibility would help him to settle down in life and stop spending so extravagantly. While agreeing to work there, he refused to be involved in owning and managing the establishment, leaving that to his mother.

Again in drag, he took a lead role in both of Waters' early full-length movies, Mondo Trasho (1969) and Multiple Maniacs (1970), the latter of which began to attract press attention for the group. Divine next starred in Waters' Pink Flamingos (1972), which proved a hit on the U.S. midnight movie circuit, became a cult classic, and established Divine's fame within the American counterculture.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{suggests}} {{a structure that}} makes room for a class of solutions to the mental causation problem. 1 The mental causation problem The core of the mental causation problem, as I see it, {{is that there is}} more than one candi-date for what makes the effect of a mental event happen. One of those candidates seems to have the best possible credentials for making the effect happen. The rest have less good credentials. The best candidate wins; hence only it makes the effect happen. And, finally, the best candidate is not mental.

Similarly, you typically do not get to choose whether you will be raised in a religious environment, whether you will be encouraged to play sports, what languages you will be taught, or whether you will be offered 267 268 Developmental Psychopathology and Wellness the chance to play a musical instrument. Lastly, you have little control over what life events (good or bad) to which you will be exposed. Taken together, kids do not have a lot of choices about the early trajectory of their lives.

50|$|Maelcum Soul (born Patricia Ann Soul; September 22, 1940 - April 5, 1968) was a 1960s Baltimore, Maryland bohemian, artist, and {{an actress}} {{in two of}} filmmaker John Waters' {{earliest}} works, Roman Candles and Eat <b>Your</b> <b>Makeup.</b>|$|E
50|$|In the 1968 movie Eat <b>Your</b> <b>Makeup</b> {{directed}} by John Waters, Divine plays Jackie Kennedy in a re-enactment of the JFK assassination.

Pleasant Gehman later wrote, [...] "We were a crowd of groupies, teenage hustlers, bisexual schoolgirls, and fringy, juvenile sluts {{looking for a good}} time. We’d hang out at weird coffeeshops (like Arthur J’s, the Gold Cup, and Danielle’s, where drag-queen hookers would meet their tricks in the bathroom), or we’d go to Westwood to see the Rocky Horror Picture Show [...] for the millionth time. These places didn’t serve alcohol, so of course they didn’t card you. And you could feel totally at home in <b>your</b> fishnets, heavy <b>makeup,</b> and divinely decadent attitude. I mean, who was going to hassle you over your hair color? A drag queen? Rodney’s English Disco had closed down, and the Masque wasn’t yet open so these were our haunts." [...] Gehman further hinted at how the underground was splintering in 1975, with roughly half of the former glitter babies turning punk and wearing garbage bags at The Masque, the other half wearing designer jeans and getting swept up into the craze that became disco.|$|R

50|$|Typically Waters would {{discover}} {{an actor and}} continue to use them in subsequent films.

Mink Stole has appeared in every Waters film except for Hag in a Black Leather Jacket (1964), Eat <b>Your</b> <b>Makeup</b> (1967), and The Diane Linkletter Story (1969). Although many Dreamlanders have a prolific history with Waters, the distinction of being a Dreamlander is generally bequested upon anyone who has made more than one Waters film, such as Traci Lords who appeared in Cry-Baby (1990) and Serial Mom (1994). Danny Mills is sometimes considered a Dreamlander despite only appearing in the 1972 film Pink Flamingos.|$|E

Caillat's vocal range span from the low-note of A3 to the high-note of F5. As noted by Holly Williams of Contact Music, the song is [...] "full of gently plucked acoustic guitar, twinkling synths and minimal piano that adds a pleasantly uplifting touch, while Colbie's vocals are soft, yet understated - almost as if she's inviting you to sing along with her." [...] According to Billboard, [...] "the song resulted from a 'venting experience' for Caillat, who translated her disappointment about her scrapped album into a message of self-love aimed at women." [...] "Put <b>your</b> <b>makeup</b> on/ Get your nails done/ Curl your hair/ Run the extra mile/ Keep it slim so they like you, do they like you?" [...] she sings in the beginning.

[...] Meanwhile, The Guardians John Robinson considered Banks' style [...] "an appealing blend of Missy Elliott and dance-pop." [...] In regards to her musical style, Banks has frequently been noted {{for the use}} of profanity in many of her songs, particularly her reclamation of the word [...] "cunt", examples including her debut single [...] "212", in which she uses the word more than ten times, or other songs such as [...] "Fierce", in which she refers to herself as the [...] "cunt queen". Banks attributes this to her upbringing in Harlem, saying, [...] "...I'm from Harlem. I went to art school; I grew up with the cunts. And that term doesn't come from me! People think I invented it, but I didn't. To be cunty is to be feminine and to be, like, aware of yourself. Nobody's fucking with that inner strength and delicateness. The cunts, the gay men, adore that. My friends would say, 'Oh you need to cunt it up! You're being too banjee.' Banjee means unrefined and rough. You need your cunts: they fix your hair for you and do <b>your</b> <b>makeup.</b> They give you confidence and give you life." [...] She is also known for her often fast-paced rapping, or [...] "flow". In a review of Banks' debut EP 1991, Chris Dart of Exclaim! found Banks' rapping speed [...] "remarkable", commenting that she [...] "manages a feat that takes most rappers {{the better part of a}} career to master: the perfect marriage of bangin', club-friendly beats and smart, crisply delivered lyrics".|$|E
