25|$|Doctors {{have known}} of strong links between fish and healthy hearts {{ever since they}} noticed that {{fish-eating}} Inuit populations in the Arctic had low levels of heart disease. One study has suggested that adding one portion of fish a week to your diet can cut <b>your</b> <b>chances</b> of suffering a heart attack by half. Fish is thought to protect the heart because eating less saturated fat and more omega-3 can help to lower the amount of cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood – two fats that, in excess, {{increase the risk of}} heart disease. Omega-3 fats also have natural built-in anti-oxidants, which are thought to stop the thickening and damaging of artery walls. Regularly eating fish oils is also thought {{to reduce the risk of}} arrhythmia – irregular electrical activity in the heart which increases the risk of sudden heart attacks.|$|E
500|$|Although forty-five {{cars were}} {{entered in the}} qualifier, {{according}} to NASCAR's qualifying procedure, only forty-three could race. Each driver ran two laps, with the starting order determined by the competitor's fastest times. Travis Kvapil clinched the first pole position of his career {{with a time of}} 51.109 seconds. He was joined on the grid's front row by Mears in his best qualifying performance of the season. Aric Almirola qualified third, his Dale Earnhardt, Inc. teammate Regan Smith was fourth, and Paul Menard started fifth. Mike Wallace, Joe Nemechek, Tony Raines, Vickers and Martin Truex Jr. rounded out the top ten qualifiers. Of the other drivers in the Chase, Edwards was twelfth, Burton 17th and Johnson 20th. The two drivers that failed to qualify were Sam Hornish Jr. and Patrick Carpentier. After the qualifier Kvapil said, [...] "Definitely qualifying doesn't really mean much as far as <b>your</b> <b>chances</b> to win the race after 500 miles, but we got a good pit selection and we'll have less chance {{to get caught up in}} a wreck early on in the race. It doesn't take long to get shuffled to the back and I'm sure I'll be shuffled in and out throughout the field. But the first few laps we'll be up front and hopefully keeping it clean." [...] He also stated the pole was [...] "special", and this was the first time Ford had occupied that position at Talladega Superspeedway since 1997.|$|E
