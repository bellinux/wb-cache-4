25|$|Roast Beef's {{birthday}} is April 22. Some of his accomplishments include {{a program that}} determines how many eggs and how much milk you need to buy in a given week, and another that determines the amount of loose change lying around your house and makes a reservation at a restaurant accordingly. Roast Beef is partial to UNIX and his preferred programming language is Java. He likes Stella Artois beer and Guinness. He is perhaps the world's greatest historian of the Great Outdoor Fight, and drove Ray to compete (and win) in the 2006 Fight. He also managed {{to get into the}} Fight himself by hacking the Fight's database. He fully accepted the fact that Ray would have to beat him senseless in order to win, and was shocked beyond belief when Ray destroyed the Fight rather than fight him. He drives a 1965 Ford Galaxie (powered by Ford's rare 427 SOHC V8 engine) that was a gift from Ray. He has also gone to the moon, by stealing Pat's home-made rocket, and to the afterlife (both heaven and hell), via various methods including some of the aforementioned shooting incidents and vomiting into an electrical outlet. He has also produced his very own zine, titled Man Why <b>You</b> <b>Even</b> Got To Do A Thing.|$|E

500|$|Devil's Due {{released}} three-issue mini-series Halloween: The First Death of Laurie Strode in late 2008. Written by Hutchinson with artwork from Jeff Zornow, {{the story}} bridges {{the gap between}} Halloween II and Halloween H20 by focusing on Laurie Strode {{in the aftermath of}} the 1978 murders. Hutchinson explains that Laurie is [...] "trying to get better and trying to repair, but where do <b>you</b> <b>even</b> start after going through such horror? How do <b>you</b> <b>even</b> try to resume normality when you don't know what that is anymore?" [...] Although Michael appears in the series, it is not clear whether he is real or if the traumatised Laurie is seeing things. Hutchinson is not a fan of the revelation that Laurie and Michael are siblings and took steps to address that problem in the story. He wanted to avoid the [...] "bloodline plot of the middle sequels", which he felt demystified the character of the Shape, and approach the story so that [...] "it becomes almost incidental that she's his sister". Hutchinson believed that Laurie Strode's evolution into Keri Tate was fertile ground for a storyline; he says, [...] "it's not the faking of the death that's interesting at all, but it’s the fall that leads to that happening. The faked death is just simple mechanics and can be covered in a sentence, but the state of mind and events leading to that are full of rich character and dramatic potential." ...|$|E

Kennedy had been a fellow lodger two years earlier {{when he was working}} in a box factory, and had become one of her earliest students. She now asked him to join her in opening a Moral Science practice in Lynn; he would see patients and she would teach. He agreed to pay her $1,000 for the previous two years' tuition. Kennedy rented rooms in Lynn in June 1870, and placed a sign in the yard, [...] "Dr. Kennedy"; he was 21 and Eddy 49. The practice became popular. McClure's wrote that people would say: [...] "Go to Dr. Kennedy. He can't hurt <b>you,</b> <b>even</b> if he doesn't help you." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{keeping with}} Homogenics theme {{as a tribute}} to Björk's native Iceland, the track was {{inspired}} by Icelandic mythology, such as the Ragnarök. The previous track, [...] "Pluto", stands for death and destruction, whereas [...] "All Is Full of Love" [...] stands for a new beginning. Björk also called it a song about [...] "believing in love" [...] and expressed that [...] "love isn't just about two persons. It's everywhere around <b>you.</b> <b>Even</b> if you're not getting love from Person A, it doesn't mean there's not love there." [...] However, she also described it as [...] "taking the piss", considering it the most [...] "sugary song" [...] ever. As the song opposes the rest of Homogenics [...] "macho" [...] aesthethic, Björk has said it could have been included on Vespertine.|$|E

500|$|The song {{contains}} {{hints of}} flamenco pop and strong lyrics dominate the entire track. After opening with [...] "traditional flamenco sounds and generic Gypsy Kings-style guitarra riffs", [...] "Amor Gitano" [...] adds hints of pop music. As the song progresses, it transcends into a ballad, demonstrating romance, excitement and extreme emotions. [...] "Amor Gitano" [...] is completely dominated by flamenco guitars which is interlaced with alternating vocals. With {{what has been}} described as a [...] "thrilling blend of the stars" [...] by James P. Steyer of Common Sense Media, both Beyoncé and Fernández exchange [...] "heated declaration of love and passion." [...] Lyrically the song contains a broader, melodramatic concept of love with Beyoncé and Fernández exchanging words between verses, for instance in one part, Fernández sings [...] "I'm your gypsy, your pilgrimage" [...] and Beyoncé replies [...] "I'm your thief, I'm going to love <b>you</b> <b>even</b> if they tear my heart out." ...|$|E

You got an idea — boom! Idea, boom!" [...] Badu's iChat contacts, including hip hop producers Questlove, Madlib, 9th Wonder, and J Dilla, instant messaged her {{to get back into}} the studio and sent her tracks. Such exchanges inspired a creative spark for Badu, which she explained in an interview for the Dallas Observer, [...] "I started to accept that maybe it's OK for me to put out music, and it doesn't have to be something dynamic or world-changing. But just as I was accepting that, here comes this burst of light and energy and creativity. And that's the process, I guess, of life—the detachment and the release of something gives <b>you</b> <b>even</b> more room to grow or be creative." ...|$|E

[...] Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times summarised it as a [...] "characteristically peppy piece of high-gloss party pop." [...] Lansky praised its effectiveness and thought it was [...] "perfectly tailored to top the charts." [...] Andrew Unterberger of Popdust acknowledged that [...] "the song is smart to swipe the guitar-only opening pattern from The Clash's [...] "Should I Stay or Should I Go?"—akin to [...] "What Makes You Beautiful" [...] lifting the [...] "Summer Nights" [...] beginning—calling on pop history to get you excited for the song before <b>you</b> <b>even</b> really realise why." [...] Unterberger further highlighted the small lyrical plays for conveying [...] "an incredible amount of urgency and fun without much clunky verbage , making singing along something of an inevitability."

500|$|After Bradfield {{sent her}} a demo of the album track [...] "I Don't Need Anyone", Minogue was {{dissatisfied}} with the lyrical content and re-wrote the track herself. Despite this, Minogue found it [...] "difficult" [...] to write the song so Bradfield had taken pieces of the original demo lyrics and mixed them with other lyrics she had written to create the finishing product of [...] "I Don't Need Anyone". She found this method of writing [...] "intriguing" [...] and {{wanted to do it}} again, so she decided to do this with [...] "Some Kind of Bliss", writing it alongside Bradfield and Sean Moore. Minogue commented about this method, saying [...] "He took one half of one set [...] and took another half from another set of lyrics and merged them together, which I found interesting because it was something I wouldn't have done because, in my mind they're two separate things." [...] She later commented that she felt it worked together. Lyrically, the song is about her being happy and said [...] "To me the song is about being able, not necessarily shut your eyes and feel that someone is there but they way where you are close to someone [...] the ability to feel like they're with <b>you</b> <b>even</b> if they are a million miles away." ...|$|E
500|$|Idolator reviewers {{were divided}} in their {{opinion of the}} song. Christina Lee deemed it [...] "a {{surprisingly}} thrilling, high-stakes moment" [...] on the album, while Carl Williot felt Ora's hook overshadowed Azalea's verses on the song. Exclaim! journalist Erin Lowers wrote, [...] "'Black Widow' should pass the threshold between mediocrity and superstardom, but falls by the wayside with little personality." [...] Drowned in Sound's Giuseppe Zevolli negatively reviewed the song, writing, [...] "'Black Widow' is so preoccupied with its overfilled, catchall crescendo that it oozes away before <b>you</b> <b>even</b> notice". Kellan Miller of XXL felt that the song intended to be [...] "a hit-to-oliberate-all-other-hits-forever-and-ever-amen", but ultimately was [...] "a fourth quarter Hail Mary pass at best." [...] In his review, Miller added, [...] "Instead of remaining steadfast to the shimmer that made the early offerings bright spots, Iggy veers off course in an all too contrived effort to meet the quota of her colossal ambition." [...] Gigwise's Alexandra Pollard criticized the track's similarities with [...] "Dark Horse" [...] and dismissed Perry for repeating her [...] "tried-and-tested-formula". StarGate's involvement was panned by Alfred Soto of Spin, who said the song's hook was borrowed from the duo's previous production for Barbadian recording artist Rihanna's [...] "Hate That I Love You" [...] (2007). Additionally, Soto dismissed the track's synth line as being [...] "nicked" [...] from StarGate's production on American singer-songwriter Ne-Yo's Libra Scale (2010). The song was named the eighth worst song of 2014 by Time magazine.|$|E

Rajeev Masand gave the film a rating of 3 out of 5, and wrote, [...] "Fashion is an easy watch because the very subject lends itself to so much interest. Like the director’s own film Page 3 it is mostly sensational and on several occasions compromises authenticity {{for the sake of}} exaggerated drama". He praised the performances of the lead cast, writing that [...] "Chopra turns in a respectable performance, one that will inevitably go down as her best. The truth is, it’s one of those by-the-book characters that she understands only too well and performs just as easily. Ditto for Kangana Ranaut who plays the eccentric superdiva with such a practiced hand, it almost seems like an effortless delivery. It's...Godse who invests such sincerity into her role, that she makes the character a real flesh and blood person. Kitu Gidwani, as the agency head who mentors our protagonist, Kitu strikes all the right notes, never once slipping out of character." ...|$|E
