5|$|What Bethesda had {{originally}} disclosed to us, as an example: In {{that section of}} the game, there is a hanging corpse. What they disclosed to us was a hanging corpse in the dark, pretty far away and without much detail. And yet, when <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> <b>a</b> torch up to the hanging corpse in the actual game, {{you can see that}} it's very mutilated with lots of blood and bones. That was a very different depiction, far more intense, far more extreme than what had been disclosed to us.|$|E
25|$|B. F. Skinner, theorist of operant conditioning, {{shows how}} a pigeon has {{been taught to}} {{distinguish}} between two words and behaves appropriately depending on which one is being presented. It learned each response with a reward of food therefore its behaviour is being shaped by controlling its environment. An example of this conditioning in a consumer behaviour context is a cinema using a consumer incentive scheme. As a consumer, if one is given a card which entitles you to a free movie if <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> <b>a</b> friend and free popcorn on Tuesdays with {{the purchase of a}} ticket per se, one is more likely to go to a movie when perhaps you wouldn’t have otherwise.|$|E
500|$|Right {{in front}} of Hudson stepped Parker High School senior Walter Gadsden when a police officer grabbed the young man's sweater and a police dog charged him. [...] Gadsden had been {{attending}} the demonstration as an observer. [...] He {{was related to the}} editor of Birmingham's black newspaper, The Birmingham World, who strongly disapproved of King's leadership in the campaign. Gadsden was arrested for [...] "parading without a permit", and after witnessing his arrest, Commissioner Connor remarked to the officer, [...] "Why didn't <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> <b>a</b> meaner dog; this one is not the vicious one." [...] Hudson's photo of Gadsden and the dog ran across three columns in the prominent position above the fold {{on the front page of}} The New York Times on May 4, 1963.|$|E

500|$|As {{the matter}} {{involved}} the prince, Stacey consulted other {{officers in the}} regiment about what should be done, and found that opinion was divided between allowing Gordon-Cumming {{to remain in the}} regiment while he defended himself, or removing him straight away. The Colonel of the Scots Guards, the prince's younger brother, the Duke of Connaught, was also asked: according to Havers, Grayson and Shankland, the duke [...] "insisted that Gordon-Cumming must be crushed". Stacey disagreed, and thought that the whole story needed to be brought out before such a decision was taken. He reported the situation to the Adjutant-General to the Forces, General Sir Redvers Buller, and requested permission to let Gordon-Cumming retire on half-pay. Buller agreed to the request, but stated that if Gordon-Cumming's legal action failed, the permission would be reviewed. Stacey relayed the message to Gordon-Cumming and told him that signing the note was an error: [...] "Because you signed that document you will never put on a sword in the regiment. If <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> <b>a</b> successful action you will be allowed to retire: if you fail, you will be dismissed [...] the service". The Duke of Connaught strongly disapproved of Buller's decision, and he withdrew to Portsmouth, refusing to again be drawn on the affair, even after his brother requested further advice.|$|E

The Cavaliere was summoned, and he stook to receive her commands hat in hand, {{with his eyes}} cast down, {{as if she had}} been a princess addressing her major-domo.

Her spirits had risen with the occasion, and she talked irresistible nonsense. [...] "Bring the best they have," [...] she said, [...] "no matter if it ruins us! And if the best is very bad, it will be all the more amusing. I shall enjoy seeing Mr. Mallet try to swallow it for propriety's sake! Mr. Hudson will say out like a man that it 's horrible stuff, and that he 'll be choked first! Be sure <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> <b>a</b> dish of maccaroni; the prince must have the diet of the Neapolitan nobility. But I leave all that to you, my poor, dear Cavaliere; you know what 's good!
