2500|$|Originally, Fairey {{had claimed}} his HOPE poster {{was based on}} a 2006 copyrighted photo of then-Senator Barack Obama seated next to actor George Clooney, taken in April 2006 by Mannie Garcia on {{assignment}} for the Associated Press, which wanted credit and compensation for the work. Garcia believes that he personally owns the copyright for the photo, and has said, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>all</b> the legal stuff away, I’m so proud of the photograph and that Fairey did what he did artistically with it, and the effect it's had". Fairey said his use of the photograph fell within the legal definition of fair use. Fairey claims he used pieces of the photo as raw material to create a heroic and inspirational political portrait, the aesthetic of which was fundamentally different from the original photo. Lawyers for both sides tried to reach an amicable agreement.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the first}} series ended, ITV {{announced}} that Broadchurch would {{return for a}} second series. The show's creator, Chris Chibnall, told The Daily Mirror {{in the summer of}} 2013 that [...] "the focus of the next series will be on how the shattered community rebuilds itself after the grisly events" [...] of series one. Series one actor Will Mellor, who does not appear in series two, strongly implied in an interview that a new murder would not be the focus of the second series, while David Tennant told the Associated Press that the series would go in a [...] "very unexpected direction" [...] which he called [...] "as gripping as the first season." [...] Chibnall said he mapped out the show's plot and characters on several whiteboards in his office. [...] "You have to be very methodical," [...] he said about plotting Broadchurch. [...] "It's like a mathematical puzzle where <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>all</b> these blocks together and move them around for the most satisfying thing." [...] Chibnall ended series two with what he described as [...] "the cheekiest cliffhanger yet – a real shocker." ...|$|E

2500|$|Chibnall said he {{mapped out}} the show's plot and {{characters}} on several whiteboards {{in his office}} before beginning the writing process. [...] "You {{have to be very}} methodical," [...] he said about plotting Broadchurch. [...] "It's like a mathematical puzzle where <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>all</b> these blocks together and move them around for the most satisfying thing." [...] Chibnall was assisted in storyboarding series two by his good friend Sam Hoyle, a television script executive who also worked with him in laying out series one. [...] "By the time I sat down to type scenes and dialogue," [...] Chibnall said, [...] "I'd already done quite a lot of work." [...] As early as mid-July 2013, Chibnall told the Daily Mirror that he had finalised the plot and written the second series' first and last scenes, and was now working {{on the rest of the}} script. Chibnall also said that the second series' themes, story, and basic mysteries are clearly established by the end of the first episode. Much of series two draws on plot elements established in series one. Lead actor Olivia Colman noted [...] "You find out very early in the first episode which direction it's going in and it's an instant, 'Whoooa!'. Chris set up a lot of things we never even thought about in the first series and now they've come to the fore. At the read-through we were going, 'You sneaky b*****d'." [...] Chibnall ended series two with what he described as [...] "the cheekiest cliffhanger yet — a real shocker". Nevertheless, there were constant rewrites of the script as filming occurred.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, Ahmadinejad, in [...] {{a speech}} praising the Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khomeini, was {{translated}} by Iranian state-run media {{as saying that}} [...] "Israel must be wiped off the map." [...] A controversy erupted over the translation, with specialists such as Juan Cole of the University of Michigan and [...] Arash Norouzi of the Mossadegh Project {{pointing out that the}} original statement in Farsi did not say that Israel should be wiped off the map, but instead that it would collapse. The words [...] ‘Israel’, ‘map’, and ‘to wipe off’ [...] are non-existent in the Iranian speech's original. According to another IRNA translation, on the occasion of a commemoration of the anniversary of Khomeini's death on 3 June 2008, Ahmadinejad stated that [...] "The corrupt element will be wiped off the map." [...] Contextually, Ahmadinejad was quoting Khomeini's words about the imminent disappearance of the Soviet Union and the Shah's regime, and tacked on his remarks concerning Israel. In Katajun Amirpur's analysis, there is no implication in the text that Iran intended destroying Israel or annihilating the Jewish people, any more than Khomeini was suggesting with his words that the Russians, or the Iranian people themselves under the Shah would be extinguished. Ahmadinejad is on the record as stating that Iran had no plans to attack Israel. The statement itself was in fact a citation, with a minute verbal variation, of a remark made by Ayatollah Khomeini in 1979, which had created no furor at the time, but did so when Ahmadinejad quoted them in 2005. Dan Meridor, Israel's minister of intelligence and atomic energy said during an Al Jazeera interview that Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had repeatedly said [...] "that Israel is an unnatural creature, it will not survive. They didn’t say, ‘We’ll wipe it out,’ you’re right, but, ‘It will not survive.’" [...] adding [...] "If Iran says this, and continues to pile up uranium that they enrich, and build missiles in big numbers, and have a nuclear military plan -- if <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>all</b> this together, you can't say, they don't really mean it." [...] The Washington Post's fact-checker editor Glenn Kessler says the interpretation gets murkier when Ahmadinejad's quote is set against other Iranian propaganda. Karim Sadjadpour, an Iranian specialist at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, cites proof that the Iranian government releases propaganda that clearly says Israel should be [...] "wiped off." [...] Joshua Teitelbaum of the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs discovered pictures of Iranian propaganda banners that clearly say in English: [...] "Israel should be wiped out of the face of the world." [...] In March 2016, Iran tested a ballistic missile painted with the phrase [...] "Israel should be wiped off the Earth" [...] in Hebrew. The missile is reported to be capable of reaching Israel.|$|E

60|$|A little {{consideration}} of what takes place around us every day would {{show us that}} a higher law than that of our will regulates events; that our painful labors are unnecessary and fruitless; that only in our easy, simple, spontaneous action are we strong, and by contenting ourselves with obedience we become divine. Belief and love,--a believing love will relieve us of a vast load of care. O my brothers, God exists. There is a soul at the centre of nature and over the will of every man, so {{that none of us}} can wrong the universe. It has so infused its strong enchantment into nature that we prosper when we accept its advice, and when we struggle to wound its creatures our hands are glued to our sides, or they beat our own breasts. The whole course of things goes to teach us faith. We need only obey. There is guidance for each of us, and by lowly listening we shall hear the right word.

Certainly there is a possible right for you that precludes the need of balance and wilful election. For you there is a reality, a fit place and congenial duties.
