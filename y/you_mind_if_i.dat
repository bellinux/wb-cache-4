500|$|Drayton and Brown {{sat next}} to each other on the bus, Drayton by the aisle and Brown by the window. When Officer Lang arrived at their row, he {{identified}} himself as a police investigator and showed his badge. In a voice [...] "just loud enough" [...] to hear, he said he was a police officer [...] "conducting bus interdiction , attempting to deter drugs and illegal weapons being transported on the bus". When Lang asked Drayton and Brown if they had any luggage on the bus, they both pointed to the same green bag on the overhead luggage rack. Lang asked, [...] "o <b>you</b> <b>mind</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> check it?", and Brown replied, [...] "o ahead". The officers inspected the bag and discovered no contraband inside.|$|E
500|$|Officer Lang {{observed}} that Drayton and Brown were wearing [...] "heavy jackets and baggy pants", despite warm weather that day. Lang suspected Brown and Drayton {{might have been}} using their baggy clothing to conceal weapons or drugs, so he asked Brown, [...] "o <b>you</b> <b>mind</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> check your person?" [...] Brown responded, [...] "ure", leaned up in his seat, removed a cellular phone from his pocket, and opened his jacket. Lang patted down the outside of his clothing and felt small packages [...] "similar to drug packages detected on other occasions". Officer Lang then arrested Brown, handcuffed him, and Officer Hoover walked him off the bus. Lang then asked Drayton, [...] "ind if I check you?", to which Drayton responded [...] "by lifting his hands about eight inches from his legs". Lang detected similar objects during a pat down of Drayton's legs, placed him under arrest, and escorted him off the bus. A further search determined that Brown had duct-taped three bundles containing 483 grams of cocaine between several layers of boxer shorts, and Drayton had duct-taped two bundles between several layers of boxer shorts containing 295 grams of cocaine.|$|E
6000|$|Nanda {{looked about}} {{her as if}} {{weighing}} many things; after which her eyes came back to him. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>mind</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> don't sit down?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Carol smiled {{upon them}} ingratiatingly. [...] "Do <b>you</b> dears <b>mind</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> slip up to bed? I'm rather tired--cleaned the upstairs today." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No,' said Birkin, 'not about anything, in particular, that is. The day was dismal, and <b>I</b> thought <b>you</b> wouldn't <b>mind</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> called in.' ...|$|R
6000|$|She held {{me there}} a moment, then whisked up her apron again with her {{detached}} hand. [...] "Would <b>you</b> <b>mind,</b> miss, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> used the freedom--" ...|$|R
6000|$|CLARE. Do {{you think}} me an awful coward for coming? [She {{has taken a}} little plain {{cigarette}} case from her dress] Would <b>you</b> <b>mind</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> smoked? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{would it}} be--Would <b>you</b> <b>mind</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> {{just took a}} look at the rest of it myself? We could talk afterward, you know. I shan't be long." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>mind</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> {{tell you}} the dearest wish of my heart?" [...] he {{promptly}} returned. [...] "I long for it. I dream about it. It is my dearest desire." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think there's {{nothing to}} be said--the thing must be faced somehow. I feel rather badly hit; <b>you</b> won't <b>mind</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> go out and walk about a little?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then perhaps <b>you</b> won't <b>mind</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> walk on a {{bit with}} you and {{apologize}} for kicking your little dog?" [...] said John, artfully availing himself of this excuse.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thought of}} that," [...] he said. [...] "Of course, Phillsons are lawyers for Malcolmson, Wingrave's broker, so I daresay {{it came from}} him. Say, Aynesworth, <b>you</b> don't <b>mind</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> ask <b>you</b> something?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I say, I hate {{to bother}} you--dare say you're busy {{and all that}} sort of thing--but would <b>you</b> <b>mind</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> popped in for half a second and used your 'phone?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You bet. I {{told you}} you'd like 'em. Squarest people on earth. Uh, Carrie----Would <b>you</b> <b>mind</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> sneaked {{down to the}} office for an hour, {{just to see how}} things are?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Say," [...] {{he called}} out, as Daylight and Dede, astride their horses, were {{preparing}} to depart. [...] "Say--do <b>you</b> <b>mind</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> look you up next year? I'd like to tackle you again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{very good}} of you, Violet, to have sent for me at once," [...] he said. [...] "I know <b>you</b> won't <b>mind</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> hurry away. It is very {{important}} that I see Madame." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>mind,</b> dear, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> {{stay with}} Aunt Janet to-night? She is very upset and nervous, and when I offered {{to come to}} her she clung to me and cried with relief." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm sure <b>you</b> won't <b>mind</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> go to bed," [...] she said. [...] "I've been {{so used to}} {{the routine}} of--of the chickens." [...] She smiled. [...] "And I've spent {{the day in the}} open air." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lady Angela," [...] I said, [...] "would <b>you</b> <b>mind</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> abstained from expressing any opinion at all? It is {{a subject}} which I feel it is {{scarcely}} right for me to discuss." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I will {{go round}} to Highclose," [...] said Lettie. [...] "I am {{sure it will}} be stormy again. Are you coming down the road, Miss Slaighter, or do <b>you</b> <b>mind</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> leave you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|As {{she spoke}} {{her eyes had}} been roving up the path and down. [...] "He's coming," [...] she interrupted. She hesitated. [...] "Would <b>you</b> <b>mind</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> went and spoke to him first, Daddy?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Kate, {{after all}} he has done for us, of course I {{have nothing to say}} against it; and I don't suppose <b>you</b> would <b>mind,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had. Still, I do think you might have done better." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've touched nothing until I've reached what I {{consider}} sanctuary," [...] he observed. [...] "My nerves {{have gone}} rotten {{for the first}} time in my life. Do <b>you</b> <b>mind,</b> sir, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> lock the door?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your head. It is horribly cut. We saw {{you from}} the window, and I fancied I could tie it up for <b>you.</b> <b>You</b> wouldn't <b>mind</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> tried, Larry? I have some balsam here, and I only want a little water." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We sold 'em off, when we parted {{with the}} farm. Do <b>you</b> <b>mind</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> have another cigarette? That was when I {{was quite a}} little chap, you know, that we had this ostrich farm." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dad, I've been thinking. Would <b>you</b> <b>mind</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> {{could make}} a sort of home at Mildenham where poor {{children}} could come to stay and get good air and food? There are such thousands of them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you know," [...] she said, [...] "this {{afternoon}} I {{have had}} an idea? Some day I hope {{so much that it}} may come true. Do <b>you</b> <b>mind</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> tell it you? It concerns yourself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't see as you've got any call {{to thank}} me," [...] he replied. [...] "Brown ain't decided yet. Now <b>you</b> won't <b>mind</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> go away slow! It's no more'n fair, seein' I'll {{be out of}} sight inside a hundred yards." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That," [...] said Jordan, [...] "is {{just what}} I was thinking, though it's quite likely {{there are people}} who wouldn't let it grieve them. In fact, I was {{wondering}} whether <b>you</b> would <b>mind</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> asked myself over to supper with your husband this evening?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; that's just it. I do wish I {{had some}} money now. <b>You</b> won't <b>mind</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> am not home quite early? We all mean to dine {{there at the}} kitchen. The girls will bring something, {{and then we can}} stay out the whole afternoon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't be foolish," [...] she laughed. [...] "I decline {{absolutely}} {{to believe}} that you had a single thought of me when you turned in here. Do <b>you</b> <b>mind</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> say that I prefer not to believe it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not up to much,' he said. 'Look here, Grey, I've got {{rather an}} idea. It's my opinion Payne's not bucking up {{nearly as much}} as he might. Do <b>you</b> <b>mind</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> leave him out of the next game?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You see, I {{was brought}} up near here," [...] he explained. [...] "I was sent from Scotland to stop with my aunt. It is highly {{probable}} that I may die here. Do <b>you</b> <b>mind</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> light a pipe?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When I joined it, I {{hated the}} army; {{that sounds like}} high treason, doesn't it? However, I got used to things and made art my hobby instead of my vocation. <b>You</b> won't <b>mind</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> confess that a view of this kind makes me long to paint?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'We,' Penfentenyou replied ambassadorially, 'have come {{to have a}} Voice in Your Councils. By the way, the Voice {{is coming}} down on the evening train with my Agent-General. <b>I</b> thought <b>you</b> wouldn't <b>mind</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> invited 'em. <b>You</b> know We're going to share Your burdens henceforward. You'd better get into training.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you, Mr. Dewy, for I {{like the}} cup decidedly. Stop a minute; {{there are no}} spoons now!" [...] She dived into the hamper again, {{and at the end}} of two or three minutes looked up and said, [...] "I suppose <b>you</b> don't <b>mind</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> can't find a spoon?" ...|$|R
