30|$|Longwall mining {{began in}} 1995. Panels were {{developed}} 225  m wide in the 3  m thick seam. A three-entry <b>yield</b> <b>pillar</b> system, with entries on 15 by 36  m centers, separated the first longwall panel from the second. The cover above the tailgate {{of the second}} panel was about 480  m.|$|E
30|$|In {{the wake}} of this incident, the {{remainder}} of the second panel was abandoned. A new tailgate was driven for the third panel, leaving {{the remainder of the}} second panel as an interpanel barrier pillar protecting the third panel tailgate from abutment loads arising from the first panel. Subsequent panels were also developed with the interpanel barrier design, leaving solid pillars up to 180  m wide between adjoining panels. Two independent sets of two-entry <b>yield</b> <b>pillar</b> gates were driven for each new panel.|$|E
30|$|The {{experience}} at Mine A demonstrated both {{the advantages and}} limitations of the two Utah longwall pillar design techniques. While the <b>yield</b> <b>pillar</b> system used {{on the first two}} panels typically performs well at depths up 600  m or so, it concentrates the load on the tailgate corner of the longwall face, and this can make it unworkable at greater depths. After the interpanel barrier method was introduced at Mine A, it was adopted at several other Utah longwalls (Gilbride and Hardy 2004). In some cases, rather than leave a full barrier, these mines elected to make mid-panel moves around the area of deepest cover, thus providing a local interpanel barrier for the next panel (Maleki 2006).|$|E
30|$|The {{interpanel}} barrier effectively {{protects the}} tailgate {{corner from the}} influence of previous panels, but at greater depths the single-panel stresses on the longwall face reach the same levels as were present with abutment loads and <b>yield</b> <b>pillars.</b> This limitation led one major Utah operator to announce in 2008 that it would write off reserves at depths exceeding 900  m as unmineable (Foy 2008).|$|R

This precursor was prepared by reacting a Na+-montmorillonite with an intercalant containing A 1 and Fe oxo-hydroxides (A 1 /Fe = 1). Powder X-ray diffraction, elemental nalysis, 57 Fe Mrssbauer spectroscopy, catalytic activity measure-ments and surface area data {{were used to}} characterize the samples. On the basis of M 6 ssbauer spectra taken at temperatures between 4. 2 and 300 K, it is deduced that oxidizing steps produce A 1 substituted maghemite which converts into A 1 substituted magnetite upon reducing heat reatment. Firing the pre-cursor in oxidizing atmosphere forms pillars of few nm in diameter. However, heating under educing conditions <b>yields</b> <b>pillars</b> of smaller diameter.

30|$|Bursts {{were one}} reason why Sunnyside {{was one of the}} early {{longwall}} pioneers in the US. Through a lengthy process during which many gateroad configurations were trialed, Sunnyside engineers developed a two-entry, <b>yield</b> <b>pillar</b> system that virtually eliminated pillar bursts. The yield pillars were typically 9  m wide in 2.5 – 3  m thick seams (DeMarco et al. 1995). Mining engineers also learned to avoid “critical” pillars which are too large to yield non-violently yet too small to support large abutment loads. The width-to-height ratios of such burst-prone, critical pillars normally exceeded 4 or 5 (DeMarco et al. 1995). Longwall face bursts continued to be a problem however, typically once the cover depth exceeded 450  m.|$|E
40|$|An {{empirical}} method, {{based on}} U. S. Bureau of Mines field studies in several Western U. S. coal mines, is presented for sizing gate road yield pillars. Discriminant {{analysis was used}} to generate functions separating successful from unsuccessful case studies. These functions relate the pillar width-height and extraction ratios and a pillar development factor to the Coal Mine Roof Rating System (CMRR), and are assumed to establish three criteria that other entry systems, under similar conditions, must satisfy. A program, Pillar Sizer, from user-provided inputs, generates a range of pillar sizes that meets the proposed criteria. Although the analysis is based on a sample consisting primarily of two-entry systems, the derived expressions generate pillar sizes closely agreeing with observed, two-entry and three-entry in situ pillars.

40|$|This work {{involves}} {{the development and}} analysis of a new pump packing material, which utilizes coal washery refuse (CWR) as a raw material, for strata control in underground coal mining operations. A review {{on the state of}} the of pump packing systems is presented, together with an analysis of the cost effectiveness of the new pump packing material as compared to other commercial pump packing materials. A method is proposed for use in the design of cement and coal washery refuse (CCWR) material mixes to give a required early strength and degree of workability when incorporating CWR. The usefulness of the method is shown by comparison of the results from a large number of tests on CCWR specimens with previously published results. It is shown that the relationship between the strength and curing time of a mix can be accurately described by a simple equation. The effects of the compositions on the strength within the experimental regions are discussed. As expected an increase in the strength of CCWR materials can be obtained either by decreasing the water content or increasing the quantity of OPC used in the mixtures. This study also investigated the influence of moisture content on the mechanical properties of CCWR material. The unconfined compressive strength, Young 2 ̆ 7 s modulus, indirect tensile strength, triaxial strength and drying shrinkage were the primary properties investigated. Results indicate that the moisture content has a significant effect on both the strength and elasticity of CCWR material at all curing times. It is evident from the tests that the drying shrinkage of wet mixes is larger than that of dry mixes. In general, moisture content affects the shrinkage of CCWR material as it reduces the volume of the restraining CWR. An empirical criterion is proposed for predicting the strength and yield characteristics of CCWR materials. A numerical procedure has been developed to determine the parameters contained in the proposed yield function. It has been demonstrated that the proposed logarithmic yield function can accurately predict the strength and yield characteristics of CCWR materials. Preliminary tests have also been conducted to determine the influence of moisture content on the flow properties of CWR. The test results indicate that the presence of very fine grains in CWR enhances its flow ability remarkably. Further work investigated the effect of specimen geometry on the strength and elasticity of CCWR material. CCWR models were tested, simulating underground monolithic pack support with different widths in a coal seam of uniform height. The study also investigated the load deformation characteristics of CCWR models under the tests conditions. It is shown that geometry has a significant effect on both the mechanical properties and load deformation characteristics of CCWR models. A <b>yield</b> <b>pillar</b> technique analysed by the finite element method appears suitable for simulation of excavation of roadways under different virgin stress conditions.

40|$|In {{underground}} coal mining, particularly room-and-pillar methods, {{the coal}} pillars {{play a significant}} role in roof stability. If the pillar dimensions are increased, the pillar bearing capacity also increases, but more coal remains in the pillar and therefore the recovery of mining operation decreases. Therefore, determining the optimum pillar dimension based on technical, economical and performance parameters is important. In this paper, the coal pillar is designed by using the concept of ground reaction curve (GRC). For this purpose, the GRC for coal pillars is drawn and then the elastic and plastic zone of coal pillar behavior is determined. Based on elastic and plastic zone, different equations are presented to draw a pillar reaction curve and the process of coal pillar design based on GRC is explained. As a case study, this new technique is applied to study the coal pillar state in Tabas coal mine of Iran. The results show that the presented new approach is successfully used in the design of the optimum coal pillar dimensions, and also determines the elastic and plastic behavior limit, which is important especially for the logical design of <b>yield</b> <b>pillars...</b>|$|R

Bureau of Mines {{evaluated}} {{two different}} conventionallongwall gate entry {{systems in the}} Southern Appalachian Basin, where mining and geologic conditions are conducive for coal pillar bumps. These gate entry systems were in a coal mine located in the Pocahontas No. 3 Coalbed under approximately 2, 000 ft of overburden and a massive quartzite sandstone member, and both employed a center abutment <b>pillar</b> flanked by <b>yield</b> <b>pillars.</b> The 8 O-ft-square tailgate abutment pillars within the first study area began bumping 500 ft in advance of mining.

Coalbed stress change and abutment pillar dilation data demonstrated that a 15 -ft-wide perimeter of yielded coal surrounded a highly stressed core in both sizes of abutment pillars.

Various strata control issues relate to stress distribution around the longwall panels at depths approaching 900 m {{in different countries}} was discussed. Extent of abutment loading and need of advance support for more distances away from the longwall faces as compared to conventional practices at shallow depths is emphasized. Innovative design of barrier pillars at high stress conditions with <b>yield</b> <b>pillars</b> is illustrated. Mining options for various coalfields in India are presented. Issues regarding mining techniques, or need of innovative techniques is critically evaluated based on the experiences of different countries and the design implemented for safe and economically viable mining for the extraction of seams at greater depths.

Maximum strain energy storage in chain pillars appears to have occurred just prior to the first of four split cuts. At that point a 15 -ft-wide, highly fractured perimeter confined the core of the 55 -by 70 -ft pillars, permitting the pillar core to support tremendous pressures. Splitting the chain pillars into two 17. 5 -by 70 -ft wings removed the confinement load, resulting in <b>pillar</b> <b>yield.</b> Thus, the <b>pillar</b> splitting mining method successfully redistributed the weight of the roof away from the pillar line.

Currently, monitoring cellular traction forces is desired as new marker to monitor cell functionality. We developed a sensor system for cell force measurement based upon a polymer microchip covered with a micropillar matrix. The spring constant is chosen to enable pillar bending by cellular forces.

40|$|Classical density {{functional}} {{theory is}} applied to investigate the validity of a phenomenological force-balance description of {{the stability of the}} Cassie state of liquids on substrates with nanoscale corrugation. A bulk free-energy functional of third order in local density is combined with a square-gradient term, describing the liquid-vapor interface. The bulk free energy is parameterized to reproduce the liquid density and the compressibility of water. The square-gradient term is adjusted to model the width of the water-vapor interface. The substrate is modeled by an external potential, based upon Lennard-Jones interactions. The three-dimensional calculation focuses on substrates patterned with nanostripes and square-shaped nanopillars. Using both the force-balance relation and density-functional theory, we locate the Cassie-to-Wenzel transition {{as a function of the}} corrugation parameters. We demonstrate that the force-balance relation gives a qualitatively reasonable description of the transition even on the nanoscale. The force balance utilizes an effective contact angle between the fluid and the vertical wall of the corrugation to parameterize the impalement pressure. This effective angle is found to have values smaller than the Young contact angle. This observation corresponds to an impalement pressure that is smaller than the value predicted by macroscopic theory. Therefore, this effective angle embodies effects specific to nanoscopically corrugated surfaces, including the finite range of the liquid-solid potential (which has both repulsive and attractive parts), line tension, and the finite interface thickness. Consistently with this picture, both patterns (stripes and <b>pillars)</b> <b>yield</b> the same effective contact angles for large periods of corrugation. Comment: 13 pages 9 figure...|$|R
40|$|The {{compression}} deformation {{behavior of}} electrodeposited nanocrystalline copper pillars with average grain sizes (d) of 360, 100, and 34 nm {{has been investigated}} {{as a function of}} specimen size (D). The yield stress for nanocrystalline pillars with d = 360 and 100 nm does not depend on specimen size, exhibiting essentially the bulk yield stress until the specimen size is reduced down to the critical values ((D/d) ∗ = 35 and 85), below which the yield stress decreases with the decrease in specimen size. In contrast, the yield stress for nanocrystalline pillars with d = 34 nm does not depend much on specimen size, exhibiting the bulk yield stress value for all specimen sizes investigated. The dominant deformation mechanism changes from dislocation glide for pillars with d = 360 and 100 nm to grain boundary diffusional creep for pillars with d = 34 nm. Grain-size induced softening occurs for pillars with d = 34 nm being consistent with the occurrence of change in deformation mechanisms, whereas the bulk <b>yield</b> stress for <b>pillars</b> with d = 360 and 100 nm increases with the decrease in grain size according to the classical Hall–Petch relationship. The critical (D/d) ∗ values determined for nanocrystalline Cu pillars with d = 360 and 100 nm increases with the decrease in grain size so as to conform to the same power law scaling obtained for coarse-grained Cu polycrystals. This is the first indication that the specimen size-induced softening extends from micrometer to nanometer scales as far as the dominant deformation mechanism is dislocation glide. The considerably large critical (D/d) ∗ values determined for nanocrystalline Cu pillars with d = 360 and 100 nm are discussed in terms of strain continuity among neighboring grains and the generation of geometrically necessary dislocations to maintain strain continuity at the grain boundaries...|$|R

Lett. 9 : 366, 2014. Fifty randomly picked devices with sizes ranging from 8 [*]×[*] 8 to 0.4 [*]×[*] 0.4 μm 2 have been measured. The 8 -μm devices show 100 % <b>yield</b> of Cu <b>pillars,</b> whereas only 74 % successful is observed for the 0.4 -μm devices, because smaller size devices have higher Joule heating effect and larger size devices show long read endurance of 105 cycles at a high read voltage of - 1.5 V. On the other hand, the resistive switching memory characteristics of the 0.4 -μm devices with a 2 -nm-thick Al 2 O 3 film show superior as compared to those of both the larger device sizes and thicker (10 nm) Al 2 O 3 film, owing to higher Cu diffusion rate for the larger size and thicker Al 2 O 3 film.

40|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNTs) have exceptional mechanical, electronic, {{and thermal}} properties, which make them ideal {{for a variety}} of applications. Forests of CNTs have additional applications beyond individual CNTs, such as thermal interface layers and filtration membranes. In this dissertation, we present mathematical models that allow for greater understanding and control of the CNT synthesis process. We first describe an atomistic model of CNT growth, which focuses on carbon-carbon interactions and approximates the interaction of carbon atoms with the substrate and catalyst. We also describe a simplified one-dimensional atomistic model that preserves some features of the full model of CNT growth. This simple model has one global energy minimum and many competing local minima. We simulate this system and compare the non-equilibrium probability distributions with the equilibrium distribution. We calculate transition rates between the basins of different local minima, and use these in a master equation to calculate non-equilibrium distributions. To allow for further analysis, we approximate the rate matrix by a matrix with two parameters [...] a slow rate and a fast rate. We present the equilibrium distribution, hitting times, and eigenvalues of this matrix and describe how they depend on the rate parameters and the number of atoms in the chain. Finally, we describe the insights this simplified model provides regarding CNT growth. We also present a mathematical model for collective chemical effects in arrays of CNT pillars, which lead to non-uniformities in pillar height. This model involves coupling a kinetic model of CNT growth with a diffusion equation for the transport of a gaseous active species. We assume this species is produced during decomposition of the feedstock gas on the catalyst and enhances the CNT growth rate by lowering the activation energy of feedstock decomposition. We simulate the effect of catalyst spacing on pillar heights and compare with experiments. We introduce a threshold on active species concentration for pillar liftoff, with which the model is able to reproduce the absence of pillars seen in widely spaced arrays in experiments.

30|$|Research on MEMS pillars were {{extensively}} done in {{the early}} of year 2000. Concept of MEMS pillars, proposes simpler experimental approach to quantify the exerted force by a cell. As the name suggests, MEMS pillars consists of an arrays or bed of closely spaced compliant pillars made from silicon or polymer (Figure 3 B). Traction forces can be determined via optical microscopy resulting from deflection of pillars whenever contacts were made with cells and substrates [35]. Each <b>pillar</b> <b>yielded</b> an independent force vector favourable for subcellular traction force mapping and stiffness of each pillar can be varied through geometry of the pillars and substrate. An array of microfabricated elastometric needles reported on subcellular traction force surface mapping based on deflection of each micropost. Previous works adapting this device for study of cells interactions with substrate were conducted by [38],[39]. Work by Tan et al. investigated on adhesion control to the pillars, relationship between cell morphology and traction forces coating effects to promote adhesion {{at the top of}} pillars [40]. Moreover, a selective functionality of micropillars using microcontact printing was also being discussed in details [41]-[43]. Work by Sniadecki et al. further manifested the micropillars by adding cobalt nanowires which was excited externally by an applied magnetic field [30]. With this added actuation mechanism, thereby allowing for active control over pillars. Most importantly, this device is able to measure local substrate stiffness but in contrary the accuracy is mainly contributed from the accuracy of pillar stiffness estimation (calibration) and the limitation from optical displacement resolution still hindering its performance. The common problem of cell spreading between pillars also caused the force-deflection relationship of calibrated pillar to be no longer well defined. Former version of micropillars arrays was developed by Galbraith and Sheetz used the concept of traction pads in order to check the forces tractions by fibroblasts as it moves along an axis [44]. However, it is still hard to precisely quantify the forces generated neither by cell nor the force distribution map due to morphological reasons; cells are active while cytoskeletal structures are dynamics.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{gives an}} {{overview}} of the difficulties associated with determining the strength of hard-rock pillars. Although a number of pillar design tools are available, pillar collapses still occur. Recent examples of large-scale pillar collapses in South Africa suggest that these were caused by weak partings that traversed the pillars. Currently two different methods are used to determine the strength of pillars, namely, empirical equations derived from back analyses of failed and stable cases, and numerical modelling tools using appropriate failure criteria. The paper illustrates that both techniques have their limitations and additional work is required to obtain a better understanding of pillar strength. Empirical methods based on observations of pillar behaviour in a given geotechnical setting are popular and easy to use, but care should be exercised that the results are not inappropriately extrapolated beyond the environment in which they are established. An example is the Hedley and Grant formula (derived for the Canadian uranium mines), which has been used for many years in the South African platinum and chrome mines (albeit with some adaptation of the K-value). Very few collapses have been reported in South Africa for layouts designed using this formula, suggesting that in some cases it might <b>yield</b> estimates of <b>pillar</b> strength that are too conservative. As an alternative, some engineers strongly advocate the use of numerical techniques to determine pillar strength. A close examination unfortunately reveals that these techniques also rely on many assumptions. An area where numerical modelling is invaluable, however, is in determining pillar stresses accurately and for studying specific pillar failure mechanisms, such as the influence of weak partings on pillar strength. In conclusion, it appears that neither empirical techniques nor numerical modelling can be used solely to provide a solid basis for conducting pillar design. It is therefore recommended that both these techniques should be utilized to obtain the best possible insight into a given design problem. Owing to the uncertainties regarding pillar strength and loading stiffness, monitoring in trial mining sections and in established mining areas is also an essential tool to test the stability of pillar layouts in particular geotechnical areas.

40|$|Cave mining {{operations}} produce bulked ore from self-sustainable propagating caves in high stress regimes. Undercut development creates even higher abutment stresses and a stress-shadow which have {{significant impact on}} extraction level stability. Geotechnical assessment of the infrastructure is vital for the safety performance and continuity of production. Northparkes Mines (NPM) is a block caving operation located in New South Wales, Australia. They deployed a post-undercutting strategy to develop the E 48 deposit, exposing all tunnels and draw bells at the extraction level to high abutment stresses. Convergence of the extraction drifts and relative displacements in the brittle rock mass have been monitored during this process. The current industry standard for geotechnical analyses of hard rock in stressed environments is the non-linear Hoek-Brown failure criterion. It estimates the resistance to shear failure of jointed to heavily jointed rock masses by rock mass strength degradation. However, brittle rock masses fail in a tensile mode in low confinement zones around excavations. The most recently developed hypothesis in this field of work is the S-shaped failure criterion. It assumes spalling at low confinement and an inhibition of tensile failure processes at relatively high confinements, where shear bands are the dominant structures causing failure. In other words, it suggests that the Hoek-Brown failure criterion underestimates the rock mass strength in highly confined zones of brittle rock masses. Validated principles to establish the rate of degradation in high confinement zones are currently not available and the S-shaped approach is therefore not yet ready for engineering purposes. The aim of this project is to indicate differences in results derived from numerical modelling when either the Hoek-Brown or the S-shaped failure criterion is applied and relate those differences to geotechnical data obtained at NPM. A three-dimensional, parameterized environment has been created by applying the mesh generator KUBRIX Geo on a Computer-Aided Design of the extraction level. Undercut development was simulated by an adequate stress-path using the Finite Difference Method in FLAC 3 D. An evaluation of the response of extensometer stations to an advancing undercut front at NPM has revealed immediate and abrupt dilative behaviour of the rock mass once the cave line has passed. Scenarios using the S-shaped failure criterion were able to simulate this behaviour if rock mass degradation was sufficiently contained at high confinement, while the scenario using the Hoek-Brown failure criterion was unable to do so. The extent of <b>yield,</b> stresses in <b>pillar</b> cores and stress-strain responses of the rock mass indicate stronger pillars in scenarios using the S-shaped failure criterion. The S-shaped failure criterion is a state-of-the-art approach and although the basic concept is finding more support, the definition of its parameters will require more research in the coming years. This project improves {{the understanding of the}} application of the S-shaped failure criterion in continuum modelling and highlights its strengths and shortcomings.

MICE services currently account for an annual economic impact of more than 122 billion (Meetings 2 ̆ 6 Conventions, 2006), making it the 29 th largest contributor to gross national product (Power, 2005). In addition to the spending power associated with this sector, conventions and events employ over 1. 7 million full time workers annually.

This current study was designed to fill this gap in the literature. ^ The objective of this research was threefold: (1) conduct an analysis of convention industry human resource needs, (2) determine current MICE course offerings in undergraduate hospitality management programs, and (3) develop and test a Convention Career Readiness Model. Based on findings from these studies, a benchmarked convention curriculum guide was created. ^ This research followed a four step process. The initial study was designed to state the knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) necessary for individuals to be successful in MICE management positions. Qualitative surveys were distributed to convention industry professionals and faculty members. Results <b>yielded</b> a five <b>pillar</b> competency model of human resource needs: planning skills, professionalism, leadership qualities, personality traits, and self management. A Kruskal-Wallis Analysis by Ranks test was conducted to determine whether any of the categories were statistically significant. Though none of the variables within the categories were significant at the 0. 05 level, two categories; professionalism and personality traits were significant at the 0. 15 level. The emphasis placed on these qualities above others which emerged in the research is logical, particularly considering the importance placed upon personal relationships within the MICE segment. ^ Step two involved an assessment of current convention course offerings. A content analysis of course syllabi was conducted to determine the learning objectives, teaching methods, assessment techniques, topics of instruction, and textbooks used in MICE classes. Course syllabi were classified into six categories: General MICE Industry, Conventions and Meetings, Event Management, Catering/Banquets, Tradeshow Operations and Group Sales. Each category was further analyzed using CATPAC software and Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric statistics. Results demonstrated a statistically significant difference between courses characterized as General MICE Industry, Convention and Meeting Planning, and Event Management courses. ^ The third step was concerned with determining students 2 ̆ 7 mastery of important convention, hospitality, and business skill sets. A Convention Career Readiness Model (CCRM) was developed using extant literature and findings from steps one and two. The CCRM was tested using an online quantitative survey distributed to students currently enrolled in MICE courses in 28 hospitality programs throughout the United States. Confirmatory factor analysis was performed using Analysis of Moment Structures (AMOS) 4. 0. Results demonstrated students possessed significant convention industry knowledge with regard to management positions and industry standards. This was evidenced by the factor loading of 0. 98 on the Convention Management construct and 0. 99 on the Industry Standards construct. Factor loadings on the Hospitality Foundations (0. 62), Business Foundations (0. 64), Convention Stakeholders (0. 70) and Convention Industry Components (0. 82) suggested students were less proficient in these areas, thus indicating a need for more rigorous instruction in these subjects. ^ Based upon the results obtained in the articles produced in steps one, two, and three, a Convention Curriculum Guide was produced. The Curriculum Guide reflected those competencies and skill sets which emerged from the research conducted in the previous three steps. The Guide itself presented an overview of various topics, along with objectives and suggestions for execution and assessment of the curriculum. The Guide proposed business and hospitality foundations as supporting framework for a comprehensive MICE curriculum. The Convention Industry Curriculum proposed seven areas of expertise: base knowledge, best practices, stakeholders, processes, practical experience, innovation and specialization. This study is important as limited information is available regarding how to best prepare students for careers in the MICE industry. Additionally, there is no standardized framework for educating convention undergraduates. ^ This research suggests one potential model for instruction and evaluation. By understanding the human resource needs of the MICE industry and subsequently designing curriculum to meet these needs, students may be better prepared for entry into the workforce. In turn, this improved preparation may ease the current labor shortage felt by the {{convention and}} event sector. ...|$|R
40|$|Magnesium alloys {{have been}} of growing {{interest}} to various engineering applications, such as the automobile, aerospace, communication and computer industries due to their low density, high specific strength, good machineability and availability as compared with other structural materials. However, most Mg alloys suffer from poor plasticity due to their Hexagonal Close Packed structure. Grain refinement has been {{proved to be an}} effective method to enhance the strength and alter the ductility of the materials. Several methods have been proposed to produce materials with nanocrystalline grain structures. So far, most of the research work on nanocrystalline materials has been carried out on Face-Centered Cubic and Body-Centered Cubic metals. However, there has been little investigation of nanocrystalline Mg alloys. In this study, bulk coarse-grained and nanocrystalline Mg alloys were fabricated by a mechanical alloying method. The mixed powder of Mg chips and Al powder was mechanically milled under argon atmosphere for different durations of 0 hours (MA 0), 10 hours (MA 10), 20 hours (MA 20), 30 hours (MA 30) and 40 hours (MA 40), followed by compaction and sintering. Then the sintered billets were hot-extruded into metallic rods with a 7 mm diameter. The obtained Mg alloys have a nominal composition of Mg– 5 wt% Al, with grain sizes ranging from 13 μm down to 50 nm, depending on the milling durations. The microstructure characterization and evolution after deformation were carried out by means of Optical microscopy, X-Ray Diffraction, Scanning Electron Microscopy, Transmission Electron Microscopy, Scanning Probe Microscopy and Neutron Diffraction techniques. Nanoindentaion, compression and micro-compression tests on micro-pillars were used to study the size effects on the mechanical behaviour of the Mg alloys. Two kinds of size effects on the mechanical behaviours and deformation mechanisms were investigated: grain size effect and sample size effect. The nanoindentation tests were composed of constant strain rate, constant loading rate and indentation creep tests. The normally reported indentation size effect in single crystal and coarse-grained crystals was observed in both the coarse-grained and nanocrystalline Mg alloys. Since the indentation size effect is correlated to the Geometrically Necessary Dislocations under the indenter to accommodate the plastic deformation, the good agreement between the experimental results and the Indentation Size Effect model indicated that, in the current nanocrystalline MA 20 and MA 30, the dislocation plasticity was still the dominant deformation mechanism. Significant hardness enhancement with decreasing grain size, down to 58 nm, was found in the nanocrystalline Mg alloys. Further reduction of grain size would lead to a drop in the hardness values. The failure of grain refinement strengthening with the relatively high strain rate sensitivity of nanocrystalline Mg alloys suggested a change in the deformation mechanism. Indentation creep tests showed that the stress exponent was dependent on the loading rate during the loading section of the indentation, which was related to the dislocation structures before the creep starts. The influence of grain size on the mechanical behaviour and strength of extruded coarse-grained and nanocrystalline Mg alloys were investigated using uniaxial compression tests. The macroscopic response of the Mg alloys transited from strain hardening to strain softening behaviour, with grain size reduced from 13 ìm to 50 nm. The strain hardening was related to the twinning induced hardening and dislocation hardening effect, while the strain softening was attributed to the localized deformation in the nanocrystalline grains. The tension–compression yield asymmetry was noticed in the nanocrystalline region, demonstrating the twinning effect in the ultra-fine-grained and nanocrystalline region. The relationship k tensions < k compression failed in the nanocrystalline Mg alloys; this was attributed to the twofold effect of grain size on twinning. The nanocrystalline Mg alloys were found to exhibit increased strain rate sensitivity with decreasing grain size, with strain rate ranging from 0. 0001 /s to 0. 01 /s. Strain rate sensitivity of coarse-grained MA 0 was increased by more than 10 times in MA 40. The Hall-Petch relationship broke down at a critical grain size in the nanocrystalline region. The breakdown of the Hall-Petch relationship and the increased strain rate sensitivity were due to the localized dislocation activities (generalization and annihilation at grain boundaries) and the more significant contribution from grain boundary mediated mechanisms. In the micro-compression tests, the sample size effects on the mechanical behaviours were studied on MA 0, MA 20 and MA 40 micro-pillars. In contrast to the bulk samples under compression, the stress-strain curves of MA 0 and MA 20 micro-pillars were characterized with a number of discrete strain burst events separated by nearly elastic strain segments. Unlike MA 0 and MA 20, the stress-strain curves of MA 40 micro-pillars were smooth, without obvious strain bursts. The deformation mechanisms of the MA 0 and MA 20 micro-pillars under micro-compression tests were considered to be initially dominated by deformation twinning, followed by dislocation mechanisms. For MA 40 pillars, the deformation mechanisms were believed to be localized dislocation activities and grain boundary related mechanisms. The strain hardening behaviours of the micro-pillars suggested that the grain boundaries in the nanocrystalline micro-pillars would reduce the source (nucleation sources for twins/dislocations) starvation hardening effect. The power law relationship of the <b>yield</b> strength on <b>pillar</b> dimensions in MA 0, MA 20 supported the fact that the twinning mechanism was correlated to the pre-existing defects, which can promote the nucleation of the twins. Then, we provided a latitudinal comparison of the results and conclusions derived from the different techniques used for testing the coarse-grained and nanocrystalline Mg alloy; this helps to better understand the deformation mechanisms of the Mg alloys as a whole. At the end, we summarized the thesis and highlighted the conclusions, contributions, innovations and outcomes of the research. Finally, it outlined recommendations for future work...|$|R
