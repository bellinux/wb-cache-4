5000|$|Emmylou Harris {{covered the}} song on her 1977 album Luxury Liner, and Willie Nelson and Merle Haggard took the song to {{number one on}} the country charts in July 1983 on their duet album Pancho & Lefty. In the biopic Be Here To Love Me, Nelson states that when he asked Van Zandt what the song was about Van Zandt replied that he didnt know. Nelson also recalls how his album with Haggard was nearly {{completed}} but he felt they didnt have [...] "that blockbuster, you know, that one big song for a good single and a video, and my daughter Lana suggested that we listen to Pancho and Lefty. I had never heard it and Merle had never heard it." [...] Lana Nelson returned with a copy of the song and Nelson cut it immediately with his band {{in the middle of the}} night but had to retrieve a sleeping Haggard, who had retired to his bus hours earlier, to record his vocal part. Van Zandt appears in the video for the song playing one of the Mexican federales. [...] "It was real nice they invited me," [...] Van Zandt told Aretha Sills in 1994. [...] "They didn’t have to invite me and I made I think $100 dollars a day. I was the captain of the federales. And plus I got to ride a horse. I always like that. It took four and a half days and that video was four and a half minutes long...The money goes by a strange life, or elsewhere. I mean it doesn’t come to me. But money’s not the question. I would like if I could write a song that would somehow turn one five-year-old girl around to do right. Then I’ve done good. That’s what I care about." [...] The royalties would provide Van Zandt with some badly needed income, though by all accounts he remained impervious to the songs success. One story involving the song that Van Zandt loved to tell was when he got pulled over for speeding in Berkshire by two policeman, the first a blue-eyed Aryan type with a crew cut, and his partner a bronze, dark eyed Mexican. Although his drivers license was up-to-date, the inspection sticker had expired, and the bedraggled singer found himself in the back of the police cruiser. As Van Zandt recounted on Austin Pickers, [...] "We got stopped by these two policeman and...they said What do <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>living?,</b> and I said, Well, Im a songwriter, and they both kind of looked around like pitiful, pitiful, and so on to that I added, I wrote that song Pancho and Lefty. You ever heard that song Pancho and Lefty? I wrote that, and they looked back around and they looked at each other and started grinning..." [...] The policemen explained that their police-radio code names were Pancho and Lefty and they let Van Zandt off with a warning. The song is probably Van Zandts most recognizable and has become a staple for aspiring folksingers and country bar bands alike. Steve Earle told John Kruth in 2007, [...] "You wont find a song thats better written, that says more or impresses songwriters more." [...] In the film Be Here To Love Me, Kris Kristofferson recites the opening lines of the song - Livin on the road my friend was supposed to keep you free and clean, now you wear your skin like iron and your breaths as hard as kerosene - and then marvels, [...] "And I could think, That was me!" [...] Bob Dylan, whose album The Times They Are A-Changin had a major impact on Van Zandt, performed the song as a duet on television with Willie Nelson at Nelsons 60th birthday concert in 1993, which Andy Greene of Rolling Stone remembers as [...] "the highlight of the night".|$|E

It would be a pretty safe bet to say that one of those first few questions is always “What do <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>living?</b> ” Jobs and one’s identity with a job and workplace have much more than occupation of time and remuneration ramifications for many of us. Besides determining how much money we earn and what our remuneration potential may be, jobs structure our day and regulate a pattern of a required set of activities as we prepare for, go to, and finish our days work. Our jobs account for our status and identity, our sense of purpose and participation, and the social interaction and network that work brings (Jahoda, Lazerfield, & Zeisel, 1933). While losing one’s job under any circumstances can certainly be a crisis, losing ones job for absolutely no reason, or one {{that has nothing to do}} with job performance certainly is. In the new economic millennium, the possibility of economic restructuring and job loss is ever present no matter how diligent and faithful employees are (Newman, 1993). The ripple effects of job loss stretch out to the families of those employees and may result in a variety of pathological reactions as the primary breadwinner comes to realise that he or she is no...|$|E
