25|$|The first ostensive {{goal of a}} BMX racer is {{to become}} the number one amateur racer in your district. The racer's home state/province maybe divided up into several Districts {{depending}} how many participants and how spread out they are over the state/province. A balance is sought. Too many people in a single district could discourage new, inexperienced riders from having {{a sense of accomplishment}} if they are doing reasonably well but not advancing his point score up the list of total points in relation to other racers. Too small a district would cheapen any sense of accomplishment due to paucity of racers, producing an artificially high ranking for the following season for the racer(s) in the points race. Points determine how well <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> the district rankings. How high you go in the rankings depends on what skill level category you are in as well as how well <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> your particular races since it affects how many points you win, which adds to your total for your district ranking. The higher your skill level, the more points you will gather at any given race (providing that you have qualified for the Main).|$|E
25|$|I {{turned a}} face to him of such joy that no-one in that great crowd could have had one moment's doubt. I just said, Oh Tom, & he seized my hand, & said how do <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> <b>in</b> quite a loud voice. He walked {{straight}} on to the platform then & gave a most remarkably clever, well thought out lecture.... I stood the whole time, holding Polly up high in my arms. Polly was very excited & wild. I kept my eyes on Tom's face the whole time, & I kept nodding my head at him, & making encouraging signs. He looked a little older, more mature & smart, much thinner & not well or robust or rumbustious at all. No sign of a woman's care about him. No cosy evenings with dogs and gramophones I should say.|$|E
25|$|Semantic memory {{disorders}} {{fall into}} two groups. Semantic refractory access disorders are contrasted with semantic storage disorders according to four factors. Temporal factors, response consistency, frequency and semantic relatedness are the four factors used to differentiate between semantic refractory access and semantic storage disorders. A key feature of semantic refractory access disorders is temporal distortions. Decreases in response time to certain stimuli are noted when compared to natural response times. Response consistency is the next factor. In access disorders you see inconsistencies in comprehending and responding to stimuli that have been presented many times. Temporal factors impact response consistency. In storage disorders, you do not see an inconsistent response to specific items like <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> refractory access disorders. Stimulus frequency determines performance at all stages of cognition. Extreme word frequency effects are common in semantic storage disorders while in semantic refractory access disorders word frequency effects are minimal. The comparison of 'close' and 'distant' groups tests semantic relatedness. 'Close' groupings have words that are related because they are drawn from the same category. For example, a listing of clothing types would be a 'close' grouping. 'Distant' groupings contain words with broad categorical differences. Non-related words would fall into this group. Comparing close and distant groups shows that in access disorders semantic relatedness had a negative effect. This is not observed in semantic storage disorders. Category specific and modality specific impairments are important components in access and storage disorders of semantic memory.|$|E

500|$|Hugh Syme {{provided}} the artwork for Octavarium. The idea of depicting a giant Newton's cradle was {{born out of}} discussions between Syme and Portnoy. The two talked about how [...] "for everything <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> music you create either a cluster or triad", according to Syme. [...] "And then it became evident that for every action there is an opposite reaction. So I thought we could do something based on the Newton's cradle." [...] There are numerous references to the numbers five and eight throughout the artwork, alluding to the album's concept. For example, the Newton's cradle has eight suspended balls, and there are five birds on the cover. The album booklet features an octagonal maze, spider and octopus, among other references. The landscape on the cover is made up of a sky and grass from Indiana, and a background from the Lake District.|$|E

Blatty also worked on his own using the name [...] "Bill Blatty" [...] writing comedy screenplays such as those for the Danny Kaye film The Man from the Diners' Club (1963), and the Warren Beatty/Leslie Caron film Promise Her Anything (1965).

500|$|During {{the podium}} ceremony, Schumacher, Coulthard and Berger did not spray the {{traditional}} champagne as {{a mark of}} respect to Senna. Schumacher felt lucky to win the race, conceding that [...] "Damon {{was a little bit}} quicker than me...he ended up going off and that's racing, but I don't think I could have caught him." [...] He also believed that his good start was fortunate, as it was the first one he had made in the new Benetton car; the team had not practised starts previously due to being short of time. He also specified his evasion of Barrichello's slowing car in the pit-lane entry while making his first stop as a crucial moment of the race. Coulthard admitted that he had been affected by his tonsillitis: [...] "I wasn't able to match Michael and Damon's pace so I settled for running my own race". Berger, meanwhile, was frustrated to finish a lap down on Schumacher, saying that [...] "He was faster everywhere: down the straights, {{going in and out of}} the corners. What can <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> these conditions? Okay, the car's roadholding is not bad. We must work very hard now. But at least I finished, that's something." ...|$|E
500|$|Climax Studios {{began with}} the game's plot, which the {{development}} team considered the main appeal of the series. Early in the game's development, some team members visited a psychiatrist for research. The use of ice as a visual theme originated partly because the developers wanted to create an Otherworld for the game, as previous games in the series had featured the same theme as Silent Hill, and because snowfall is common in the northeastern or midwestern United States, where the fictional town is located. Falling snow was added to limit the player's visibility and build an atmosphere of dread. The developers included a system of psychological profiling that adjusted gameplay elements based on the player's interaction with the game. Writer Sam Barlow explained the system: [...] "ultimately every little thing <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> the game or piece of content you can interact with can be assigned a little personality score. This is all added into a very classical psychometric profile of your personality that can then be mapped onto research." [...] The opening questionnaire has little significance in the player's profile. Capturing the multiple variations of gameplay elements for submission to the Entertainment Software Rating Board proved to be difficult, according to the game's producer, Tomm Hulett. Loading times were eliminated from the game to maintain a sense of immersion for the player.|$|E

It's an enjoyable time, but most of the battles and quests feel rather trivial." [...] Matt Casamassina scored all other versions of the game 7.5 out of 10, feeling the gameplay was too similar to, and not as good as, Zelda games; [...] "try as this game may to copy Zelda, it lacks the intuitiveness and polish of the franchise, and this drawback is noticeable." [...] However, he praised the combat and the graphics. He concluded [...] "it's a well-made adventure game that will absolutely provide a good amount of entertainment and satisfaction for those seeking it. But {{at the same time the}} title falls a little short thanks to a general lack of polish and overall difficulty [...] Recommended to hardcore Tolkien fans or to younger players after a fun adventure. That said, the game has a long way to go to take on Link in battle." ...|$|E
