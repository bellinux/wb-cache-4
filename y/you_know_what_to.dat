500|$|Looking at how [...] "Steinman's old-fashioned teen-dream rock 'n' roll fantasies" [...] fits in {{with the}} music culture of 1993, Kerrang! {{suggests}} that it wouldn't appeal to [...] "Nirvana and Metallica fans, but there's an older generation of rockers out there who will, quite properly, worship this album." [...] Their four-star review declares that [...] "it {{is a work of}} genius, a ready made rock classic and arguably the last word in rock operas." [...] In The Tip Sheet, Jonathan King labelled it a [...] "glorious, splendid album," [...] celebrating Meat Loaf's [...] "operatically gorgeous" [...] voice and Steinman's [...] "superb" [...] songs, arrangements and production. [...] "You'll be blown away. Better still you'll catch yourself openly laughing out loud at times with delight. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> expect yet it's constantly better, fresher and brighter than you hope. If they had a Mercury Music Prize for American albums, this would win it hands down." ...|$|E
500|$|Eastwood {{is known}} for his {{economical}} film shoots; his regular camera operator, Steve Campanelli, indicated the rapid pace at which Eastwood films—and his intimate, near-wordless direction—also featured during Changelings shoot. Eastwood limited rehearsals and takes to garner more authentic performances. Jolie said, [...] "You've got to get your stuff together and get ready because he doesn't linger... He expects people to come prepared and get on with their work." [...] Campanelli sometimes had to tell Jolie what Eastwood wanted from a scene, as Eastwood talked too softly. To provide verisimilitude to certain scenes, Eastwood sometimes asked Jolie to play them quietly, as if just for him. At the same time he would ask his camera operator to start filming discreetly, without Jolie's seeing it. Malkovich noted Eastwood's direction as [...] "redefining economical", saying Eastwood was quiet and did not use the phrases [...] "action" [...] and [...] "cut". He said, [...] "Some —like Clint Eastwood or Woody Allen—don't really like to be tortured by a million questions. They hire you, and they figure <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do, and you should do it... And that's fine by me." [...] Ryan also noted the calmness of the set, observing that her experiences working with director Sidney Lumet on 100Centre Street and Before the Devil Knows You're Dead were useful due to his sharing Eastwood's preference for filming a small number of takes. Donovan said Eastwood seldom gave him direction other than to [...] "go ahead", and that Eastwood did not even comment on his decision to play Jones with a slight Irish accent: [...] "Actors are insecure and they want praise, but he's not there to praise you or make you feel better... All he's there to do is tell the story, and he hired actors to tell their story." [...] Gaffer Ross Dunkerley said he often had to work on a scene without having seen a rehearsal: [...] "Chances are we'll talk about it for a minute or two, and then we're executing it." ...|$|E
