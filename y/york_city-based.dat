5|$|In {{addition}} to playing the game, Adams {{was involved in}} the production of early baseball equipment. He personally manufactured baseballs for a period of time, supplying many New <b>York</b> <b>City-based</b> clubs. Adams found that when the ball was more tightly stitched, it traveled further when batted or thrown. According to author Peter Morris, Adams' ball-manufacturing efforts helped to keep the Knickerbockers in operation during their first few years, as they would otherwise have had difficulty finding balls. In later years Adams gathered rubber from old galoshes for the insides of baseballs. A tanner then used horsehide to create the balls. As late as 1863, Adams was one of the three most prominent makers of baseballs in New York, continuing to produce them by hand. Adams also played a role in producing baseball bats, choosing which wood to use and overseeing the manufacturing process.|$|E
5|$|The 1957 Yankees {{reached that}} year's World Series, but lost in seven games to the Milwaukee Braves. Following the Series, the Giants and Dodgers left New York City for California, leaving the Yankees as New York's only MLB team. Despite {{their status as}} the sole New <b>York</b> <b>City-based</b> franchise, the Yankees' 1958 {{attendance}} decreased from previous seasons as the team could not attract bereft Giants and Dodgers fans. In the 1958 World Series, the Yankees {{had an opportunity to}} avenge their defeat to the Braves. The Yankees fell behind by losing three of the first four games, but won the final three games of the Series to claim another championship. The Yankees were unable to defend their AL and World Series championships in 1959, as they ended up with a 79–75 record, their worst record since 1925, good for third place.|$|E

5|$|The first NCAA Tournament was {{organized}} by the National Association of Basketball Coaches. Oregon won the inaugural tournament, defeating Ohio State 46–33 in the first championship game. Before the 1941 tournament, control of the event {{was given to the}} NCAA. In {{the early years of the}} tournament, it was considered less important than the National Invitation Tournament (NIT), a New <b>York</b> <b>City-based</b> event. Teams were able to compete in both events in the same year, and three of those that did so—Utah in 1944, Kentucky in 1949, and City College of New York (CCNY) in 1950—won the NCAA Tournament. The 1949–50 CCNY team won both tournaments (defeating Bradley in both finals), and is the only college basketball team to accomplish this feat. By the mid-1950s, the NCAA Tournament became the more prestigious of the two events, and in 1971 the NCAA barred universities from playing in other tournaments, such as the NIT, if they were invited to the NCAA Tournament.|$|E

25|$|New <b>York</b> <b>City-based</b> Texas Is the Reason bridged the {{gap between}} indie rock and emo in their three-year {{lifespan}} on the East Coast, melding Sunny Day Real Estate's melodies and punk musicianship and singing directly to the listener.

25|$|In 1904, the Cleveland Trust Company invited architects {{from around}} the nation to {{participate}} in a competition to design the headquarters building it intended to build on the First Methodist/Wedge land.

25|$|In the United States many {{of those}} most anxious to help were those recent émigrés from Tsarist Russia, {{including}} {{hundreds of thousands of}} Jews who had escaped the anti-Semitic regime in seeking a better life in the new world. Many of these worked in the American garment trades, manufacturing clothing and participating in a burgeoning New <b>York</b> <b>City-based</b> trade union movement in such unions as the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America (ACWA) and the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU). Not only was there pressure from the rank-and-file below to do something to aid the embattled Soviet regime, but many union officials were themselves radically-minded immigrants to America who had departed Tsarist Russia some years previously with a strong interest in lending aid to the so-called proletarian dictatorship in Soviet Russia.|$|E
25|$|In 1939, Judith {{graduated}} from Morris High School in the Bronx at 16 and rethought her politics {{under the influence}} of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact (August 23), shifting to a Trotskyist outlook. She married Dan Zissman the next year, less than four months into a relationship that started when they met at a Trotskyist Fourth of July picnic in Central Park. Their daughter Merril Zissman was born in December 1942. In this period, she also became one of the few female members of the New <b>York</b> <b>City-based</b> group of science fiction writers, editors, artists and fans, the Futurians, which included Kornbluth. The Zissmans separated about 1945; in 1946 Frederik Pohl, another Futurian, began living with her.

25|$|NBC, whose {{relationship}} with channel 4 had been contentious at {{times over the}} previous half-century, had made many offers for channel 4 over the years, but the deYoungs turned them down each time. It finally saw {{the opportunity to get}} an owned-and-operated station in what was then the United States' fifth-largest television market and quickly jumped into the bidding war for KRON. NBC was seen as the frontrunner to buy the station, until it was outbid at the last second by New <b>York</b> <b>City-based</b> Young Broadcasting, then-owner of Los Angeles independent station KCAL-TV and several other stations in medium to small markets, on November 16, 1999. Young's purchase price for the station ($750 million at the outset, rising to $820 million by closing) was a record price for a single station that stands to this day. To help finance the down payment, Young was forced to sell La Crosse, Wisconsin CBS affiliate WKBT to Morgan Murphy Media.|$|E
25|$|After {{each country}} has {{designated}} its official entry, English-subtitled copies of all submitted films are {{shipped to the}} Academy, where they are screened by the Foreign Language Film Award Committee(s), whose members select by secret ballot the five official nominations. Final voting for the winner is restricted to active and life Academy members who have attended exhibitions of all five nominated films. Members who have watched the Foreign Language Film entries only on videocassette or DVD are ineligible to vote. These procedures were slightly modified for the 2006 (79th) Academy Awards, with the Academy deciding to institute a two-stage process in determining the nominees: {{for the first time}} in the history of the award, a nine-film shortlist was published one week before the official nominations announcement. In the meantime, a smaller thirty-member committee which included ten New <b>York</b> <b>City-based</b> Academy members was formed, and spent three days viewing the shortlisted films before choosing the five official nominees. Residents of the city hosting the country's second largest film industry were thus allowed to participate for the first time ever in the selection process for the Foreign Language Film Award nominees.|$|E
25|$|Laxalt was {{a partner}} in the New <b>York</b> <b>City-based</b> law firm of Finley, Kumble, Wagner, Underberg, Manley, Myerson & Casey and its {{successor}} law firm, Laxalt, Washington, Perito & Dubuc. He later formed a small government consulting firm known as The Paul Laxalt Group. After his retirement from the U.S. Senate, Laxalt was named by President George H.W. Bush to a prestigious deficit reduction panel that consisted of current and former members of Congress and other prominent Americans. The commission eventually deadlocked on how best to address federal budget deficits. Paul Laxalt was honored in various ways both during and after his public service career. The Paul Laxalt Mineral Engineering Center, an $11 million building that was completed in 1983, {{has been described as a}} giant step forward for the University of Nevada-Reno and the School of Mines. The 60,000-square-foot building houses classrooms and laboratories for mining engineering, chemical and materials engineering, and geological sciences. The Paul Laxalt State Building in Carson City was formerly the U.S. Post Office (built in 1891) and the first Federal building erected in Nevada. It is located in the center of the Carson City's Historic District.|$|E
