[...] Bono understood the cause of the Madres and COMADRES and wanted to pay tribute to it.

It is true that he has not been associated to any extent with the German espionage system in America, but he has been well-known always as a reckless adventurer, ready to sell his life in any doubtful cause, so long as it promised excitement and profit. It was known to us that he had come into touch with a certain man in Washington who has been looking after the interests of his country in America. It was to shadow Jocelyn Thew that I came on this steamer. His friends cleverly fooled Hobson and me, and landed us in Chicago too late, as they thought, to catch the boat. That is why I made that somewhat melodramatic journey after you on the seaplane. Do please consider this matter reasonably, Miss Beverley. It was perfectly easy for him to slip across and place these things in your luggage as soon as he found that his original scheme was likely to go wrong. You were the one person on the steamer whom he reckoned would be safe from suspicion. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> his plot from the very first, and no more than that." ...|$|E

5000|$|Stylistically the Convention resembled more of {{a public}} party than a {{commercial}} concert series. As festival organizer and K Records co-founder Candice Pedersen said, [...] "It {{was a way to}} combine music and dancing and fun without all the pseudo-business stuff.... We tried to keep passes as low as possible, thirty-five dollars for five days, just enough to make sure the bands and venues got paid. It was really very community oriented.... A lot of people came and didn't pay and just hung out. And that was totally encouraged; if you wanted to be there, <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the community." ...|$|E

5000|$|In France, besides Les Légions Noires (The Black Legions), a NSBM scene arose. Members of French band Funeral desecrated a {{grave in}} Toulon in June 1996, and a 19-year-old black metal fan stabbed a priest {{to death in}} Mulhouse on Christmas Eve 1996. According to MkM of Antaeus, the early French scene [...] "was quite easy to divide: either you were NSBM and you had the support from zine and the audience, or <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the black legions and you had that 'cult' aura".
