5|$|After {{producing}} several interactive games {{aimed at}} children, the Miller brothers {{decided to create}} an adult-targeted game with a non-linear story, believable characters, and an ethical dilemma. Initially turned down by Activision, Cyan was later approached by Sunsoft, who helped fund Myst. The game took two <b>years</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> and was Cyan's largest project.|$|E

5|$|Development {{began in}} November 1994 by the lead programmer, Simon Carter, and took {{two and a}} half <b>years</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop.</b> The game used the engine for Magic Carpet, and the first version was merely {{scrolling}} around a map and entering third-person. The engine was built by Glenn Corpes. Molyneux then developed a 2D prototype containing features that made it into the final game. The prototype focused on constructing the dungeon, and included the Treasure room, Hatchery, Training room, and Dungeon Heart. The characters were designed by the artist, Mark Healey.|$|E
5|$|Williams {{had long}} planned {{to design a}} horror game, but waited eight years for {{software}} technology to improve before doing so.

5|$|Because {{the maximum}} calibre of naval gun allowed under the Anglo-German Naval Agreement was 40.6cm (16inch), Hitler soon had second {{thoughts}} about the guns {{to be used for}} the new ships and ordered that they be armed with 38cm (15inch) weapons. However, the 28.3cm turrets were readily available; 38cm turrets would take <b>years</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop,</b> and Hitler wanted capital ships as soon as possible to fulfill his political ideals. He was also reminded that, despite the allowances of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, the British had historically been sensitive about increases in main gun calibers aboard German capital ships. He therefore acquiesced to the ships' being armed with 28.3cm guns, with the provision that they be upgunned to 38cm at the earliest opportunity. The 38cm turret was eventually used in the s.|$|E
5|$|Disney {{initially}} envisioned Toy Story 2 as a direct-to-video sequel. The film began {{production in}} a building separated from Pixar, on a small scale, {{as most of the}} main Pixar staff were busy working on A Bug's Life (1998). When story reels proved promising, Disney upgraded the film to theatrical release, but Pixar was unhappy with the film's quality. Lasseter and the story team redeveloped the entire plot in one weekend. Although most Pixar features take <b>years</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop,</b> the established release date could not be moved and the production schedule for Toy Story 2 was compressed into nine months.|$|E

Versions for the Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation were in development, but cancelled. The game received critical acclaim, with reviewers praising the uniqueness and depth. Dungeon Keeper was re-released on gog.com in 2011, and on Origin in 2016. A fan-made mod, KeeperFX, was released, which fixes bugs and adds features. Dungeon Keeper {{was followed by a}} sequel, Dungeon Keeper 2, in 1999, and influenced games such as Lego Rock Raiders and Ghost Master.|$|E

5|$|While Rand Miller stated Cyan {{would not}} make another sequel to Myst, Mattel (then {{the owner of the}} Myst franchise) offered the task of {{developing}} a sequel to several video game companies who created detailed story proposals and technology demonstrations. Presto Studios, makers of the Journeyman Project adventure games, was hired to develop Myst III. Presto spent millions developing the game and used the studio's entire staff to complete the project, which took two and a half <b>years</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop.</b> Soon after Myst III: Exile was released, Presto was shut down, and Exile publisher Ubisoft developed the sequel, Myst IV: Revelation, internally. Meanwhile, Cyan produced the spinoff title , which included an aborted multiplayer component allowing players to cooperatively solve puzzles.|$|E
5|$|On May 8, 2013, Universal Orlando {{announced}} {{the expansion of}} Wizarding World of Harry Potter, Diagon Alley, along with the Hogwarts Express attraction, to be located on the former site of the Jaws attraction. By the end of August 2013, all six passenger cars and both tenders had been spotted in the backstage area, waiting to be assembled on the track. The first of the two trains was installed on the track on October 24, 2013. By the beginning of December 2013, the second train had {{been placed on the}} track.

5|$|While New World Cabernets are {{characterized}} as being drinkable earlier than Bordeaux, premium producers {{such as the}} Californian cult wines will produce wines that need time to age and could potentially develop {{for two to three}} decades. Overall, the majority of Californian Cabernets are meant to be approachable after only a couple of years in the bottle but can still have the potential to improve further over time. Similarly many premium Australian Cabernet will also need at least ten <b>years</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> though many are approachable after two to five years. New Zealand wines are typically meant to be consumed young and will often maintain their green herbal flavors even with extended bottle aging. South American Cabernets have very pronounced fruit flavors when they are young and the best made examples will maintain some of those flavors as they age. South African wines tend to favor more Old World styles and typically require six to eight years' aging before they start to develop further flavors.|$|E
