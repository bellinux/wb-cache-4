Joan, my wife, said you better go. He sounded really desperate. There wasn't much he could do for such a long time. Of course, when he did start to get brave, he was too old for going around and picking up what he might enjoy. He was the first of our mega stars; there seem to be mega stars everywhere now. In those days, living in such a Sleepy Hollow like Melbourne, he found his life terribly, terribly difficult. And <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> in those days. The times have changed. It's almost compulsory to be homosexual now.|$|E

500|$|As he {{presented}} his lessons {{to a wide}} variety of students (he taught only one class, to a large audience), he began to study the perceptions of Africa in Western scholarship: [...] "Africa is not like anywhere else they know... there are no real people in the Dark Continent, only forces operating; and people don't speak any language <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand,</b> they just grunt, too busy jumping up and down in a frenzy".|$|E

In a video posted by Revolt, Combs urged viewers to see 12 Years a Slave by stating: [...] "This movie is very painful but very honest, {{and is a}} part of the healing process. I beg all of you to take your kids, everybody to see it.... You have to see this so <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand,</b> so you can just start to understand." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{his review}} for AllMusic, Bruce Eder {{wrote that the}} album [...] "shows a mature Elvis Presley [...] {{displayed}} the rich, deep vocalizing that would challenge critics' expectations of Elvis Presley playing rhythm guitar throughout". Eder concluded that on Elvis Is Back!, Presley [...] "comes off better than on any of his other albums since arriving at RCA". Will Hermes of Rolling Stone praised its [...] "wildly varied material, revelatory singing, impeccable stereo sound". [...] Writing for Rough Guides in 2004, Paul Simpson commented: [...] "Among the 1800 or so records in Elvis's collection at Graceland is a copy of Elvis Is Back!, almost white {{from the number of}} times it was played. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> why this would be his favourite album." [...] Simpson admired Presley's blues singing on [...] "Like a Baby" [...] and [...] "Reconsider Baby", and added, [...] "it's hard to believe that this commitment and exhilaration was to be heard only fitfully for most of the 1960s, often on songs buried on B-sides or as bonuses on dodgy soundtrack albums." ...|$|E
500|$|By 1792 Sophia and {{her sister}} Mary were being {{included}} in more family activities, and at age fourteen, Sophia debuted at court on her father's birthday, 4 June 1792. According to biographer Christopher Hibbert, in her young adulthood Sophia was a [...] "delightful though moody girl, pretty, delicate and passionate." [...] As within her childhood, Sophia was devoted to her father, though she occasionally found him exasperating. She wrote that [...] "the dear King is all kindness to me, and I cannot say how grateful I feel for it." [...] Prior to 1788, King George had told his daughters {{that he would take}} them to Hanover and find them suitable husbands despite misgivings he had, which stemmed from his sisters' own unhappy marriages. He remarked, [...] "I cannot deny that I have never wished to see any of them marry: I am happy in their company, and do not in the least want a separation." [...] However, the King suffered his first bout of madness that year, when Sophia was aged eleven. Sophia remarked of her father's behaviour, [...] "He is all affection and kindness to me, but sometimes an over kindness, if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> that, which greatly alarms me." [...] Further lapses into insanity occurred in 1801 and 1804, thus forestalling talk of marriage for his daughters. The question of matrimony was rarely raised; Queen Charlotte feared the subject, something which had always discomforted the King, would push him back into insanity. Furthermore, the queen, strained from her husband's illness, wanted the princesses to remain close to her.|$|E

2500|$|By February 1989 Hussey was in London {{working on}} James' second solo album, Hard Reyne, he co-produced the album with John Hudson. By April that year Hussey {{was married to}} Elisabeth Reyne, younger sister to the Reyne brothers. Besides song writing Hussey also {{provided}} keyboards and programming. Whitfield described how [...] "he lyrics (once <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> them) are not exactly brilliant and lack much of the depth which Reyne displayed in his Crawl days" [...] nevertheless Hussey made a [...] "big contribution" [...] to the album. The album peaked at No.7 in June while Braithwaite's Edge was still at No.1. Whilst in London, Hussey received his first ARIA Award nomination, {{in the category of}} Producer of the Year, at the ARIA Music Awards of 1989 for Edge.|$|E
2500|$|By 1975, {{the band}} began feeling stale and {{felt they had}} {{achieved}} as much success in the UK and Europe that they could. Furthermore, their 1975 movie Slade in Flame received a mixed reception and the band's latest UK tour had seen a less-than-frantic rush for tickets in contrast to their 1973 tour. Slade and their manager Chas Chandler decided that the next best career move was to try and crack America. The band agreed to move to there and build a reputation for their live performances from scratch, {{just as they had}} in the UK. Holder said in 1975: [...] "During the past five years when the band peaked, we did five major tours of Britain, six tours of Europe, two tours of Australia, two of Japan, visited the USA a few times, made a film... <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> why we felt more than a little jaded. We reckoned that we needed to undertake a fresh challenge to regain that old spark." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2002, {{shortly before}} the Iraq War, Schäuble accused German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder of [...] "strengthening Saddam Hussein" [...] by {{undermining}} the unanimity of international pressure on Iraq {{to open up to}} United Nations weapons inspectors. On Schröder's initiative to join forces with President Jacques Chirac of France and President Vladimir Putin of Russia in opposing the war, Schäuble commented: [...] "This triangular relationship involving Berlin, Paris and Moscow was a dangerous development. It was very dangerous for the small countries in Europe because they perceived it as an axis and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> why. We want good relations with Russia but we do not want those relations to be misunderstood." [...] Schäuble, in contrast to many German politicians, subsequently defended the United States' decision to invade Iraq. By 2006, he said he thought the overthrow of Saddam Hussein was in itself correct, but that he was [...] "doubtful" [...] from the outset about the Iraq war because it resulted from a unilateral decision by the US.|$|E
2500|$|Although her {{service was}} marred by her nervousness, and taxed her health, Jane Ely quickly {{became one of the}} Queen's most trusted attendants. The Queen {{referred}} to Jane as “almost one of ourselves”, which indicates the difference that Victoria liked to maintain between herself and non-royals. Jane became the most prominent of ladies that were recognised “agents” of the Queen, the others being Harriet Phipps and Horatia Stopford. The role was exploited, especially in the royal household, where they found in Jane a useful advocate to the Queen when requesting approval for a course of action. The use of Jane as an unofficial secretary was widely acknowledged in society, and references to her are found in many letters from the aristocracy. When the Earl of Beaconsfield fell out with the Queen after he refused to meet Lord Chelmsford, he wrote despairingly to Jane, with the probable intention that she would show it to the Queen, that “I love the Queen — perhaps the only person in this world left to me that I do love; and therefore <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> how much it worries and disquiets me, when there is a cloud between us.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1907, Cobb reached {{first and}} then stole second, third and home. He {{accomplished}} the feat four more times during his career. He finished the 1907 season with a league-leading [...]350 batting average, 212 hits, 49 steals and 119 runs batted in (RBI). At age 20, he was the youngest player to win a batting championship and held this record until 1955, when fellow Detroit Tiger Al Kaline won the batting title twelve days younger than Cobb when he did it. Reflecting on his career in 1930, two years after retiring, he told Grantland Rice, [...] "The biggest thrill I ever got came {{in a game against}} the Athletics in 1907 ... The Athletics had us beaten, with Rube Waddell pitching. [...] They were two runs ahead in the 9th inning, when I happened to hit a home run that tied the score. This game went 17 innings to a tie, and a few days later, we clinched our first pennant. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> what it meant for a 20-year-old country boy to hit a home run off the great Rube, in a pennant-winning game with two outs in the ninth." ...|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} in October 2001, Mundine said of the 11 September terrorist attacks, [...] "They call it an act of terrorism, but if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> religion, and our way of life, it’s not about terrorism. It’s about fighting for God’s law, and America’s brought it upon themselves". Offering some insight into his tendency to make controversial comments in the media, Mundine stated that [...] "If you want to toe the line, {{if you want to}} be some corporate guy and say the right things, do the right things, you might be okay in the media's eye, but it won't be real for me." [...] Mundine later claimed he was taken out of context stating: [...] "Those comments were just spun around like I was clapping my hands. I have a family too, I know what it is like to suffer the loss of someone close to me, and I would never wish that upon anyone. The point I was trying to get across was that it was in a war state of mind, and there is always going to be tit for tat, so why put yourself in a situation where you can endanger people. I have got nothing against any American, I have got nothing against any human being. It breaks my heart that people think I would even have that line of thought about being happy about people dying. That is crap and I want to clarify that because it is wrong." ...|$|E
