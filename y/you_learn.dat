25|$|The fact of {{the matter}} is that we’re in our thirties now and that breakup {{happened}} ten years ago. As a human being you just don't want that kind of karma. We did a lot of shit talking, and they did a lot of shit talking, so I just called everybody up and invited them to my house and said ‘hey, listen, we’re in our thirties now, I’m sorry for whatever I said, I'm sure you guys didn’t mean what you said–you guys were upset because I split up the band and we were upset because of whatever. Let’s be friends again. But do I want to reunite and play fucking 15-year old songs? Well, it would be like asking you, ‘do you want to get back together with your first girlfriend?’ <b>You</b> <b>learn</b> some amazing things together, but I just shudder at the thought. We were a band that went out on top, which is good, but it’s just a coincidence. We were also a band that had been together for seven years, and for six of those years played to nobody and had a great time but were also on the verge of splitting up many times before that. It’s an old relationship. People would like to think of it as unfinished business because to them we went out when we were most popular, but that has nothing to do with the creative element. As far as the creative element went, it very much was finished business. That’s why I ended the band! Now, thank god, fucking ten years later, we're not holding a grudge and we’re all cool with it. People pick up on the difference of attitude and think 'oh, this could mean a possible reunion', but that’s just them projecting their own desires upon us.|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, [...] "The Power of Good-Bye" [...] talks the {{strength}} {{that comes in}} letting go, and it was considered [...] "a sort of sonic sister to 'Frozen'", since both deal with themes of a heart closed towards love. This is emphasized in the lyrics, [...] "Your heart is not open so I must go" [...] as well as [...] "Freedom comes when <b>you</b> <b>learn</b> to let go, Creation comes when <b>you</b> <b>learn</b> to say no". The idea for using detachment as {{the inspiration for the}} song stemmed from Madonna's interest in Buddhist philosophy, as well as practicing Yoga. Nowels described the lyrics as [...] "stunning" [...] and commended its confessional nature. He also described the track as a [...] "meditation" [...] and [...] "a beautiful poem". Australian music critic and friend of Madonna, Molly Meldrum, claimed the lyrics were about the singer's former husband Sean Penn. The lyrical content was also compared to literary works of William Shakespeare, Sylvia Plath and Anne Sexton.|$|E
500|$|Later, {{speaking}} about the military mindset with which he went about the preparations, he said, [...] "You learn how to handle killing in the military.

500|$|... "Cuando" [...] (When), {{also in a}} minor key, is a pop R ballad {{featuring}} synthesizers and percussion with Caribbean {{roots and}} Afro-Latin influences. It uses electric-guitar riffs, an acoustic guitar, a string orchestra and a piano. In the song, Queen explores {{what happens when a}} relationship ends: [...] "Adam sinned because he loved Eve, the love of Celia and Pedro touched the stars, but only when <b>you</b> <b>learn</b> to value women, can you be happy". An editor for iTunes claimed the song's lyrics to be sultry. She stated that of the 16 tracks, [...] "Cuando" [...] means the most to her because it is an Rbolero track which would remind men to value women.|$|E

I went through a lot of personal turmoil right around the time Audioslave formed and unfortunately I think that affected the band a little bit in terms of me not really being grounded.... I think there was stuff that could have been resolved, and there was drama that was probably unnecessary, typical rock band stuff. I certainly played a role in it. I definitely feel like I was part of a lot of unnecessary stuff. It didn't need to become what it became. <b>You</b> <b>learn</b> with experience." ...|$|E
500|$|Moore {{frequently}} {{moved around}} the United States as a child, due to her father's occupation. She was close to her family as a result, but has said she never had the feeling of coming from one particular place. The family lived in multiple locations, including Alabama, Georgia, Texas, Panama, Nebraska, Alaska, New York, and Virginia, and Moore attended nine different schools. The constant relocating made her an insecure child, and she struggled to establish friendships. Despite these difficulties, Moore later remarked that an itinerant lifestyle was beneficial to her future career: [...] "When you move around a lot, <b>you</b> <b>learn</b> that behavior is mutable. I would change, depending on where I was... It teaches you to watch, to reinvent, that character can change." ...|$|E
500|$|Deus Ex {{features}} combat {{similar to}} first-person shooters, with real-time action, a first-person perspective, and reflex-based gameplay. As the player will often encounter enemies in groups, combat often tends toward a tactical approach, {{including the use}} of cover, strafing, and [...] "hit-and-run". A USA Today reviewer found [...] "At the easiest difficulty setting, your character is puréed again and again by an onslaught of human and robotic terrorists until <b>you</b> <b>learn</b> the value of stealth." [...] However, through the game's role-playing systems, it is possible to develop a character's skills and augmentations to create a tank-like combat specialist with the ability to deal and absorb large amounts of damage. Non-player characters will praise or criticize the main character depending on his use of force, incorporating a moral element into the gameplay.|$|E

500|$|With further releases, {{many games}} in the genre have drifted towards action by {{allowing}} the option of direct confrontations. The Hitman series, the first installment of which was released in 2000, allowed this play style, but rewarded the player for stealthy and elaborate assassination of antagonists. [...] {{was also the first}} 3D game to employ the genre's device of disguises. No One Lives Forever, an espionage themed parody also released in 2000, again allowed the player to combine or choose between stealth and overt violence. In 2000, the first-person action role-playing game Deus Ex also incorporated stealth elements in its gameplay. A USA Today reviewer found [...] "At the easiest difficulty setting, your character is pureed again and again by an onslaught of human and robotic terrorists until <b>you</b> <b>learn</b> the value of stealth." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1949, Dworsky was {{the first}} round draft pick of the Los Angeles Dons of the All-America Football Conference. The Dons were the first {{professional}} football team in Los Angeles. Dworsky played eleven games with the Dons in 1949, his only season in professional football. Dworsky played linebacker and blocking back for the Dons and had one interception and one kick return for 14yards. The AAFC disbanded after the 1949 season, and Dworsky turned down an offer from the Pittsburgh Steelers {{to return to the}} University of Michigan where he graduated in 1950 with a degree in architecture. Dworsky later noted: [...] "It was a toss-up whether I would become a pro football player or an architect. Being a linebacker is good conditioning for a young designer. <b>You</b> <b>learn</b> to block the bull coming at you from all sides." ...|$|E

500|$|After [...] "Within You Without You", [...] "The Inner Light" [...] was {{the second}} {{composition}} to fully reflect Harrison's immersion in Eastern spiritual concepts, particularly meditation, an interest that had spread to his Beatles bandmates and to the group's audience and peers. The lyrics espouse meditation {{as a means to}} genuine understanding. Theologian Dale Allison describes the song as a [...] "hymn" [...] to quietism and comments that, in their attempt to [...] "relativize and disparage knowledge of the external world", the words convey Harrison's enduring worldview. Author John Winn notes that Harrison had pre-empted the message of [...] "The Inner Light" [...] in an August 1967 interview, when he told New York DJ Murray Kaufman: [...] "The more <b>you</b> <b>learn,</b> the more you know that you don't know anything at all." [...] Writing in his study of Harrison's musical career, Ian Inglis similarly identifies a precedent in the song [...] "It's All Too Much", where Harrison sings: [...] "The more I learn, the less I know." ...|$|E

[...] Shirley Halperin from Entertainment Weekly shared a similar sentiment, describing it as [...] "pure pop candy". Bob Waliszewski and Bob Smithouser from Plugged In classified [...] "Nobody's Perfect" [...] as [...] "pro-social content", where [...] "rather than [...] herself up over mistakes, the singer acknowledges that 'Nobody's Perfect'" [...] through the lyrics [...] "Everybody has those days" [...] and [...] "You live and <b>you</b> <b>learn</b> it". [...] "Nobody's Perfect" [...] charted at number 27 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, and reached numbers 14 and 25 on the Billboard Digital Songs and Pop 100 charts, respectively. As of October 2010, the track has sold 906,000 copies in the United States, becoming the most successful song from the Hannah Montana franchise.
