5000|$|The 2007 {{game for}} Red Nose Day, [...] "Let It Flow", could be played online. This game was {{developed}} by Matmi, worldwide viral marketeers, and set in the African wilderness. Mischievous hyenas had messed up the water irrigation system which fed the crops. <b>You</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> re-arrange the pipes to let the water flow to the crops to keep them alive. Once the pipes were arranged, you needed to operate the elephant's trunk to pump the water through the water pipes.|$|R
60|$|Possibly Baptists and Independents {{like those}} whom Tooley Street {{sent out to}} enlarge the area of freedom beyond seas still people it; but I cannot say, {{and for the rest}} it is much crossed and recrossed by the viaducts of the London and South Eastern Railway, under which we walked the length of the long, dull, noisy thoroughfare. We were going to the church of St. Olave, or Olaus, a hallowed Danish king from whose name that of Tooley was most ingeniously corrupted, for the sake of knowing that we were in the parish that sweet Priscilla Mullins, and others of the Plymouth colony came from. The church is an uninteresting {{structure}} of Wrennish renaissance; but it was better with us when, {{for the sake of the}} Puritan ministers who failed to repent in the Clink prison, after their silencing by Laud, came out to air their opinions in the boundlessness of our continent. My friend strongly believed that some part of the Clink was still to be detected in the walls of certain water-side warehouses, and we plunged into their labyrinth after leaving St. Olave's or St. Tooley's, and wandered on through their shades, among trucks and carts in alleys that were dirty and damp, but somehow whitened with flour as if all those dull and sullen piles were grist-mills. I do not know whether we found traces of the Clink or not, but the place had a not ungrateful human interest in certain floury laborers who had cleared a space among the wheels and hoofs, and in the hour of their nooning were pitching pennies, and mildly squabbling over the events of their game. We somehow came out at Bankside, of infamous memory, and yet of glorious memory, for if it was once the home of all the vices, it was also the home of one of the greatest arts. The present filthy quay figuratively remembers the moral squalor of its past in the material dirt that litters it; but <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> it recall the fact that here stood such theatres as the Paris Garden, the Rose, the Hope, the Swan, and, above all, the Globe.|$|E

You can't root for the Marx Brothers because they're a bunch of zany kooks.

The boss of the game's Story and Arcade modes is Gig, an immense insect-like monster with an angel attached to its bottom half that doesn't have many details. The game has 21 playable characters in all, but only twenty story modes, for Robo-Ky has no story mode.|$|E

5000|$|Evidence {{emerged that}} Dwyer and O'Hara had {{embarked}} on a sexual relationship that involved bondage, violence and knives. The relationship was very intense throughout 2008. Violent homemade sex videos and fragments of emails were retrieved from their laptops. Their relationship dwindled for some time, but was rekindled in March 2011 when Dwyer contacted O'Hara through a prepaid mobile phone. Dwyer had a mobile phone number which began with 083, and both he and Elaine had mobile phones with numbers that began 086. Recovered texts sent by Dwyer during this period included: [...] I want to stick my knife in flesh while I am sexually aroused… I would like to stab a girl to death some time.

5000|$|Joseph Arthur {{began the}} {{recording}} of Our Shadows Will Remain shortly after tour dates supporting Tracy Chapman and worldwide solo tour dates (promoting his previous album Redemption's Son) in late 2003. The album was recorded across New Orleans, New York City, London and Prague. Joseph produced the album with Mike Napolitano, Ken Rich, and David Kosten. Joseph, who has battled with alcoholism and drug abuse throughout his entire life, said in an October 2004 interview with Paste Magazine: [...] "I got totally wasted {{for a while in}} New Orleans, then I went to L.A. and was going further that way, and I called up my friends in New Orleans and said, 'I'm coming back and I have to straighten out and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> me.'" [...] Joseph remained sober and returned to Mike Napolitano and his French Quarter apartment/studio to finish the album. The strings were arranged by Andrew Sherman, and were played by the City of Prague Philharmonic.|$|E
5000|$|According to a March 2013 Bloomberg News article, {{during the}} last five years Walmart added 455 United States stores for a 13% increase. During this same period, its overall United States {{employees}} including Sam's Clubs employees went down ever so slightly at 1.4% which translates to a reduction of 20,000 employees. In Wisconsin, an employee who oversees grocery deliveries and {{who is a member of}} OUR Walmart reports that the store is a long way from the previous mantra of [...] "in the door and to the floor." [...] Instead, merchandise ready for the sales floor remains on pallets and in steel bins in the back of the store with [...] "no passable aisles." [...] Prof. Zeynep Ton states that companies can get in a downward spiral where too few labor hours lead to operational problems and lower sales and these reduced sales then become a rationale to reduce labor hours even further. [...] "It requires a wake-up call at a higher level," [...] she said. A customer from Delaware states that the cosmetics section [...] "looked like someone raided it" [...] and [...] "You hate to see a company self-destruct, but there are other places to go." [...] A customer in California states, [...] "You wait 20, 25 minutes for someone to help you, then the person was not trained on mixing paint.
