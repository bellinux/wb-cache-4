500|$|Who's <b>Your</b> <b>Neighbor?</b> is a 1917 silent American {{propaganda}} and drama film directed by S. Rankin Drew. The film's plot focuses around reformers who {{pass a law}} to force prostitutes, including Hattie Fenshaw, out of the red light district. Fenshaw becomes Bryant Harding's mistress and lives in an apartment next door to a reformer, and continues to ply her trade. After Fenshaw becomes familiar with Harding, his son, daughter and the daughter's fiance, {{the climax of the}} film occurs as the cast assembles at Fenshaw's apartment. Harding returns and a fight breaks out that results in the reformers' arrival and concludes with the presumption that Fenshaw returns to a place of [...] "legalized vice". The drama was written by Willard Mack and was his first foray into screen dramas. The film proved controversial, but is noted as a great success. The film originally debuted on June 15, 1917, but it was rejected by the National Board of Review and was later approved after a revision, but the film continued to be labeled as an immoral production. The film is presumed to be lost.|$|E

500|$|Willard Mack had {{registered}} and copyrighted [...] "Who's Your Neighbor?" [...] on March 9, 1917. Speculation by Motography {{states that}} Mack's [...] "contribution {{to the screen}} drama was probably prompted by the distressing Ruth Cruger mystery, which was so cleverly solved by Mrs. Grace Humiston, and follows very closely many of the phases of drama in real life that shocked the world." [...] The April 17, 1917 issue of Motography profiled the film, the first production of Master Drama Features, noting {{that it would be}} shown on a [...] "stage-right" [...] basis after a New York City premier at a Broadway theater. H. D. Fretz noted {{that the majority of the}} scenes were shot indoors and described the photography as excellent. The film was described as breaking a record by Motoplay because of the use of a triple exposure. The brief note stated that it is a delicate and precise work that required perfect synchronization that [...] "(the film) had to be taken twenty times before the result was satisfactory to Director S. Rankin Drew." [...] Who's <b>Your</b> <b>Neighbor?</b> was the first film produced by Edward Small. According to the American Film Institute, the film was edited by Frank Lawrence.|$|E
500|$|The first movement, [...] "" [...] (You shall love God, your Lord), carries Bach's {{statement}} {{on the most important}} law, on which, according to the parallel , [...] "hang all the law and the prophets".

Bach had enlarged on the [...] "dualism of love of God and brotherly love" [...] already in his monumental cantata in 14 movements, , {{at the beginning of his}} first cycle. In order to show the law's universality, Bach introduces Martin Luther's chorale [...] "" [...] (These are the holy ten commandments), referring to the commandments of the Old Testament, as a foundation of the movement's structure. The tune is played in a strict canon, the most rigid musical law as one more symbol. The canon is performed [...] by the trumpet in the highest range, and the continuo, representing the lowest range. The tempo of the trumpet is twice as fast as the tempo of the continuo, therefore the trumpet has time to repeat first single lines and finally the complete melody of the chorale. The trumpet enters ten times, to symbolize once more the completeness of the law. The voices, representing the law of the New Testament, engage in imitation of a theme which is derived from the chorale tune and first played by the instruments. John Eliot Gardiner, who provides an extended analysis of the movement, concludes: ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{one popular}} {{interpretation}} of stage theory, {{each of the}} so-called levels of existence envelops those below it: an ethical person is still capable of aesthetic enjoyment, for example, and a religious person is still capable of aesthetic enjoyment and ethical duty. The difference between these ways of living are internal, not external, and thus there are no external signs one can point to determine at what level a person is living. This inner and outer relationship is commonly determined by an individual by looking to others to gauge one's action, Kierkegaard believed one should look to oneself and in that relationship look to Christ as the example instead of looking at others because the more you look at others the less you see of yourself. This {{makes it easier to}} degrade <b>your</b> <b>neighbor</b> instead of loving <b>your</b> <b>neighbor.</b> But one must love the person one sees not the person one wishes to see.
