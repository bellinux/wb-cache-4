25|$|Physical {{activity}} is body movement that works <b>your</b> <b>muscles</b> and requires {{more energy than}} resting. According to a blog by the American Intercontinental University, college students should make time for exercise to maintain and increase motivation. AIU states that regular exercise has impeccable effects on the brain. With consistent running routines, there are more complex connections between neurons, meaning the brain is able to access its brain cells more flexibly. By performing well physically, motivation will be present in education because of how well the brain is performing. After exercising, the brain can have more desire to obtain knowledge and better retain the information. In addition, exercise can relieve stress. Exercising can ease anxiety and relieve negative effects of stress on the body. Without stress factors, individuals can perform better and more efficiently, since their minds will have a more positive outlook. This positive mood will help keep students motivated and more open and willing to succeed academically. Lastly, exercise increases focus and concentration that could also help students maintain their motivation and focus on their studies. AIU claims that exercise may have improved the students' ability to participate and retain information during the class after they had exercised. Being able to retain information and being willing to participate keeps students motivated and performing well academically.|$|E

40|$|Introduction Spinal {{cord injury}} can affect normal breathing. The level of your injury will {{determine}} the effect it will have. It can be different for everyone. For example, the higher the level of your injury, the more complications you may face. Good pulmonary care can assist in keeping you healthy after your spinal cord injury. Normal The process of breathing (or respiration) is a two-step process: taking in air (inspiration) and exhaling the waste products. The process of taking in air (inhalation) is an active process, requiring the use of many muscles, while the process of exhaling is a passive process, which occurs when the muscles relax. The muscles of respiration include the diaphragm, {{and a group of}} muscles called the accessory muscles. The muscles included in the “accessory group” include <b>your</b> neck <b>muscles,</b> <b>your</b> chest wall <b>muscles</b> and <b>your</b> abdominal <b>muscles.</b> These muscles {{are the ones that are}} used when you run or are stressed and assist the diaphragm in taking in larger amounts of air. If your injury is high enough, the neck accessory muscles may become the primary muscles of respiration. By themselves, these muscles are unable to bring in enough air to maintain life on a daily basis. When this occurs, assisted ventilation is used. This assistance can be in the form of a ventilator, phrenic (a nerve that helps make the muscle of breathing work properly) pacers or other non-invasive methods of breathing. Assisted ventilation is used along with other therapies and treatments to try to maintain good pulmonary condition. Without this assistance, the person could suffer severe tissue damage, brain damage or death. (23 pages, 578 kb...|$|R
