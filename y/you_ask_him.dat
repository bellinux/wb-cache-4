2500|$|McCarver was {{not immune}} to {{criticism}} from outside sources, either, as Norman Chad wrote a critique of him in Sports Illustrated during the postseason. Chad said that McCarver was someone who [...] "when <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> the time, {{will tell you how}} a watch works", a reference to McCarver's perceived tendency to overanalyze things. Chad went further by saying [...] "What's the difference between Tim McCarver and appendicitis? Appendicitis is covered by most health plans." ...|$|E
2500|$|On March 26, Gun Runner {{returned}} in the $1 million Louisiana Derby, {{also at the}} Fair Grounds, {{where he was the}} third betting choice at odds of almost 4-1. He was close behind a slow early pace, then drew away in the stretch to win by [...] lengths in a dominant performance. [...] "The good thing is he's very easy to manage," [...] said Geroux. [...] "He has so many gears. He settles really nicely, and when <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> to go, he has a nice turn of foot." ...|$|E
2500|$|The 12th-century heresiographer al-Shahrastani {{describes}} the Majusiya into three sects, the Kayumarthiya, the Zurwaniya and the Zaradushtiya, among which Al-Shahrastani asserts {{that only the}} last of the three were properly followers of Zoroaster. As regards the recognition of a prophet, Zoroaster has said: [...] "They ask you as to how should they recognize a prophet and believe him to be true in what he says; tell them what he knows the others do not, and he shall tell you even what lies hidden in your nature; he shall {{be able to tell you}} whatever <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> and he shall perform such things which others cannot perform." [...] (Namah Shat Vakhshur Zartust, [...]5–7. 50–54) When the companions of Muhammad, on invading Persia, came in contact with the Zoroastrian people and learned these teachings, they at once came to the conclusion that Zoroaster was really a Divinely inspired prophet. Thus they accorded the same treatment to the Zoroastrian people which they did to other [...] "People of the Book".|$|E

2500|$|From 2003, when Varenne {{started his}} {{breeding}} career, until 2008, {{he stood at}} Allevamento Il Grifone in his homeland Italy. His first foal, delivered by the mare Vendee on January 5, 2004, was a colt named Icaro del Ronco. During the four years at Allevamento Il Grifone, Varenne sired between 126 and 168 foals per year. Among the offspring born 2004-2005 are Swedish star mare Lie Detector (SEK 4 886 131) with several wins in classic races to her name. Italian mare Lana Del Rio has won a number of Group 1 races, e.g. Gran Premio Nazionale. Lord Capar (Sweden/Italy) and Southwind Serena (USA) are two other successful trotters sired by Varenne. In 2008, Varenne was moved to Menhammar Stuteri outside Stockholm, Sweden, where Varenne's stands for c. €750 (insemination) + €15,000 (live foal). Menhammar veterinarian Johan Hellander, claims that Varenne is [...] "a marvellous stud stallion" [...] that [...] "does exactly what <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> to" [...] and that Varenne's service would be more expensive if he were not so fertile.|$|E
2500|$|After {{developing}} [...] "a random obsession" [...] with Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny, {{she took}} the morning off school during her Junior Certificate mock examinations and met the future Taoiseach as he campaigned in Millstreet ahead of the 2011 general election. Their meeting was filmed for television, with Kenny vowing he would not reduce disability funding if elected. O'Riordan later remarked, [...] "I thought he was honest. He looked like someone who wasn't {{going to tell a}} lie." [...] Upon election he cut disability funding and O'Riordan wrote a letter expressing her disappointment. Her public confrontation with Enda Kenny over his spending cuts to disability funding contributed to O'Riordan's rise to fame; the government later changed its mind. She later explained: [...] "I thought Enda Kenny was a cool guy, you know, he always seemed really relaxed, and easy going. So I only went up for a picture and one of our local people from home was like ‘why don't <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> about people with disabilities’, so I did and the local television were recording because it was a big thing for Millstreet, our Future Taoiseach coming. I suppose it was one really small thing that you just do and it just turned into a big thing." ...|$|E
2500|$|Monk had {{disappeared}} from the scene by the mid-1970s and made {{only a small number}} of appearances during the final decade of his life. His last studio recordings as a leader were made in November 1971 for the English Black Lion label, near the end of a worldwide tour with the Giants of Jazz, a group which included Gillespie, Kai Winding, Sonny Stitt, Al McKibbon, and Blakey. Bassist McKibbon, who had known Monk for over twenty years and played on his final tour in 1971, later said: [...] "On that tour, Monk said about two words. I mean literally maybe two words. He didn't say 'Good morning,' 'Goodnight,' 'What time?' Nothing. Why, I don't know. He sent word back after the tour was over that the reason he couldn't communicate or play was that Art Blakey and I were so ugly." [...] A different side of Monk is revealed in Lewis Porter's biography, John Coltrane: His Life and Music; Coltrane states: [...] "Monk is exactly the opposite of Miles : he talks about music all the time, and he wants so much for you to understand that if, by chance, <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> something, he'll spend hours if necessary to explain it to you." [...] Blakey reports that Monk was excellent at both chess and checkers.|$|E

6000|$|Of course {{his soul}} felt {{none of these}} emotions. [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> this famous man, who by himself was as well worth a journey to England to see, as all the wonders of Rome are worth a journey to Italy, if <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him,</b> I say, for the scene of The Little Baker's Boy, he played it; if <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> the next minute for the scene from Hamlet, he played that too for you, equally ready to sob over the fall of his pies, and to follow {{the path of the}} dagger in the air."[278] ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'He's {{refused to}} answer anyone. I tried to get {{something}} out of him, but I couldn't, and I lost my temper. He might give you the truth if <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> pointblank.' ...|$|R
