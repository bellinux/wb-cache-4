Why {{do you have to}} adhere to prescribed formulas that they have and people argue over them and they're all in a box. And <b>you</b> <b>watch</b> Fox claw CNN, and CNN claw Fox. Sometimes I catch a piece of the news and it seems insanity to me. I quietly support candidates. I'm not out there banging a drum for candidates. But I have supported a candidate and it's a whole other world. Once you've been exposed to it, once or twice or however many times, if you know the facts and see how they're presented, it's mind-boggling. It's a very scary arena to be in, but I do vote. I go in there and pull the lever. It's kind of like pulling the lever and watching the trap door fall out from beneath you. Why should we trust any of these people? None of them ever deliver on anything. It's always disappointing.|$|E

500|$|In contrast, Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph {{rated the}} film two stars {{out of five}} and called the plot [...] "a curate's egg, {{thoroughly}} scrambled". He concluded, [...] "The film squanders both of its casts, reeling from one fumbled set-piece to the next. It {{seems to have been}} constructed in a stupor, and <b>you</b> <b>watch</b> in a daze of future past". Simon Abrams, writing for RogerEbert.com, gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four, calling it a [...] "visually driven and paint-by-numbers-plot". Abrams was critical of the undeveloped subplots that built up because the film's pacing left little time to develop each element of the story set in the 1970s.|$|E

They did not plan to use the score in its entirety, but they used Steve Jablonsky to compose a score that was reminiscent of Manfredini's and created the atmosphere for the 2009 film. Nispel contacted Jablonsky to score Friday the 13th after having worked with him on the remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Nispel told Jablonsky [...] he wanted him to create something that Nispel could [...] "whistle when [...] left the theater", but was subtle enough that it would not immediately register while watching the film. Nispel said, [...] "I don't believe that, when <b>you</b> <b>watch</b> a Friday the 13th film, you want to feel like John Williams is sitting next to you with the London Symphony Orchestra".|$|E
