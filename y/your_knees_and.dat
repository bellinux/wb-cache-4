500|$|The {{perceived}} lack {{of remorse}} by Waddle, plus {{reports in the}} Japanese media that Greeneville had {{made no effort to}} assist Ehime Maru survivors as they waited for almost one hour for rescue angered many Japanese citizens, especially the family members of the missing. [...] One Japanese family member publicly referred to Waddle as, [...] "the most terrible criminal of them all." [...] Another family member, referring to Waddle said, [...] "If you're a man, you should fall on <b>your</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> ask for our pardon!" [...] In response, Waddle delivered letters of apology to the Japanese consulate in Hawaii for delivery to the victims' families during the last week of February.|$|E
500|$|Away {{from his}} expeditions, Shackleton's life was {{generally}} restless and unfulfilled. In {{his search for}} rapid pathways to wealth and security, he launched business ventures which failed to prosper, and he died heavily in debt. Upon his death, he was lauded in the press, but was thereafter largely forgotten, while the heroic reputation of his rival Scott was sustained for many decades. Later in the 20th century, Shackleton was [...] "rediscovered", and rapidly became {{a role model for}} leadership as one who, in extreme circumstances, kept his team together in a survival story described by cultural historian Stephanie Barczewski as [...] "incredible". In his 1956 address to the British [...] Association, Sir Raymond Priestley, one of his contemporaries, said [...] "Scott for scientific method, Amundsen for speed and efficiency but when disaster strikes and all hope is gone, get down on <b>your</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> pray for Shackleton", paraphrasing what Apsley Cherry-Garrard had written in a preface to The Worst Journey in the World.|$|E

2500|$|Lyrically, This Means War! {{took the}} {{implicit}} spiritual warfare theme {{that had been}} present in Petra's albums and tours since Never Say Die and emphasized it further. Although the album ended for good the band's longstanding tradition of featuring electric guitars as warcraft, its picture of a warrior on his knees complemented songs with titles such as [...] "Get on <b>Your</b> <b>Knees</b> <b>and</b> Fight Like a Man," [...] "All the King's Horses" [...] and the title track, a rousing rocker backed by a marching drumbeat that addressed Satan as the preordained loser of the war he had declared against Christ and his followers.|$|E
2500|$|The band's manager {{suggested}} they {{write a song}} with Green {{early on in the}} writing process. Gaskarth ended up writing [...] "Do You Want Me (Dead?)", [...] "Guts", [...] "Under a Paper Moon", [...] "A Daydream Away" [...] and [...] "Get Down on <b>Your</b> <b>Knees</b> <b>and</b> Tell Me You Love Me" [...] with Green within three days. Barakat said the pair had [...] "an amazing chemistry together. He added this sweet dynamic to the band we never had before. He made us think in ways we never would have thought before." [...] "Forget About It" [...] was written by Gaskarth and Fields. [...] "Time-Bomb" [...] was written by Gaskarth, Bouvier, Comeau and Squire. [...] "Just the Way I'm Not" [...] was written by Gaskarth and Butch Walker. [...] "Return the Favor" [...] was written by Gaskarth, Jacob Lutrell and Daniel Lutrell. [...] "No Idea" [...] was written by Gaskarth, Christopher [...] "Tricky" [...] Stewart and Terrius Nash. [...] "That Girl" [...] and [...] "My Only One" [...] were written by Gaskarth and Squire. Barakat said Gaskarth and Squire [...] "are great writers ... They just have an amazing chemistry together." [...] "Heroes" [...] was written by Gaskarth and John Feldmann. [...] "Merry Christmas, Kiss My Ass" [...] was written by Gaskarth, Book and Alexei Misoul.|$|E

John Fields produced [...] "Forget About It". Squire produced [...] "Time-Bomb" [...] and [...] "My Only One". Butch Walker produced [...] "Just the Way I'm Not". Kahne produced [...] "That Girl", {{to which}} Green provided additional production and was mixed by Chris Lord-Alge. U4L produced [...] "Merry Christmas, Kiss My Ass", which was mixed by Green. Asked about {{the choice of}} using several producers, Barakat said [...] "We're all about using multiple producers on our records. ... I'm not 100% into the one producer/one record thing because {{you get a lot}} of the same sounding songs. It's cool to have a bunch of variety." [...] Gaskarth added [...] "working with a lot of different producers is good, because it pulls you in all kinds of new directions." [...] He added that, similar to Nothing Personal, they [...] "kinda split up the [...] with different producers that we wanted to work with in the past, but for scheduling or monetary reasons, we couldn’t lock them in for the whole record." ...|$|E
