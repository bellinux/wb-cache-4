500|$|After {{less than}} five years as a judge, Denning was {{appointed}} a Lord Justice of Appeal on 14 October 1948. He was sworn in as a Privy Counsellor on 25 October 1948. As a Lord Justice of Appeal he continued to make reforming judgments in a variety of areas, particularly in family law and the rights of deserted wives. In 1952 the Court of Appeal heard Bendall v McWhirter [...] 2 QB 466 and ruled that a deserted wife occupying the marital home had a personal licence to stay there. The decision provoked disapproval among the judiciary and from the public; a correspondent wrote: Dear Sir: You are a disgrace to all mankind to let these women break up homes and expect us chaps to keep them while they rob us of what we have worked for and put us out on the street. I only hope <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> trouble as us. So do us all a favour and take a Rolls and run off Beachy Head and don't come back.|$|E
2500|$|Palin {{told the}} crowd that calls to {{transform}} the country were not enough; [...] "We must restore America and restore her honor." [...] Palin likened the rally participants {{to the civil rights}} activists from 1963, and said the same spirit that helped them overcome oppression, discrimination and violence would help this group as well. Palin's lines such as, [...] "Look around you. You're not alone. You are Americans! <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> steel spine and moral courage of Washington and Lincoln and Martin Luther King. It is in you. It will sustain you as it sustained them," [...] were greeted by the crowd's standing ovations and chants of [...] "U!–S!–A!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Other men as wise as <b>you</b> <b>have</b> done <b>the</b> <b>same</b> sort of thing. Miss Demolines is very clever, and I daresay {{you find}} it amusing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your {{father is}} so possessed and {{carried away by}} an idea that one can almost forgive him his {{injustice}} and cruelty. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> not <b>the</b> <b>same</b> excuse!" ...|$|R
6000|$|EGO. [...] "'Europe {{feels that}} your Majesty is not old; and your Majesty's look (PHYSIOGNOMIE) shows that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> still <b>the</b> <b>same</b> force as in your thirtieth year.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{sword and}} pistols, Master Rupert; and as <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same,</b> methinks any highwayman chaps we might meet would think twice ere they venture to cry 'Stand and deliver.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{beg your}} pardon, sir," [...] he said; [...] "I reckon that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> {{political}} sentiments as the Judge. Believe me, sir, I would not willingly offend a guest." ...|$|E
60|$|Thus {{in human}} life you have the two fields of {{rightful}} toil for ever distinguished, yet for ever associated; Truth first--plan or design, founded thereon; so in art, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> two fields for ever distinguished, for ever associated; Truth first--plan, or design, founded thereon.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{something}} also <b>you</b> <b>have</b> of <b>the</b> <b>same</b> animal's silent ways {{of going}} about its work. You give no warning; you come noiselessly behind, seize fast, and hold on." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Another of your cousins, Whitefoot, lives {{along the}} {{seashore}} of the East {{down in the}} Sunny South. He is called the Beach Mouse. In general appearance he is much like <b>you,</b> <b>having</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> shape, long tail and big ears, {{but he is a}} little smaller and his coat varies. When he lives back from the shore, in fields where the soil is dark, his upper coat is dark grayish-brown, but when he lives on the white sands of the seashore it is very light. His home is in short burrows in the ground.|$|R
60|$|So I <b>have</b> told <b>you</b> of {{that famous}} affair-at-arms betwixt Sir Launcelot and Sir Tristram, and I pray God that <b>you</b> may <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> {{pleasure}} in reading {{of it that}} I had in writing of it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I mean," [...] he said hastily, [...] "that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> {{opportunity}} {{to direct the}} lives of these young men into more regular, disciplined channels that I have to regulate and correct their foolish waste of industry and material here. It would at least beguile the time for you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "However, Tommy," [...] he continued, [...] "I'll not let <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> regrets {{in after}} life, my son: God helping me, you shall have a good; edication. Well, as I was sayin', John Rudyerd the runaway boy became Mister Rudyerd the silk-mercer on Ludgate Hill, London, and now he's goin' {{to build a}} noo light'ouse on the Eddystun." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{know the}} rascals, and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> {{way of looking}} at things," [...] said he. [...] "Our object is to keep things going for another twenty-four hours. After that it does not much matter what befalls us, for we shall be {{out of the reach of}} rescue. But how can we stave them off for another day?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'She did her best, but <b>you</b> <b>have</b> not <b>the</b> <b>same</b> opportunities. It can't {{be helped}} {{with a man}} of that age. Mark might have done something, but {{he is out of}} the {{question}} now, poor fellow!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Forgive me," [...] she implored; [...] "I {{thought they}} would {{distress}} <b>you,</b> and I <b>had</b> such a desire to bring you nothing but happiness. To bear them by myself seemed to be helping you, and I was glad, I was proud, to feel myself of use to you even to that little extent. I did not know <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> fears; I thought that perhaps they came only to women; <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> them before? Fears," [...] she continued, so wistfully, [...] "that it is too beautiful to end happily? Oh, <b>have</b> <b>you</b> heard a voice crying, 'It is too beautiful; it can never be'?" ...|$|R
60|$|Wherefore {{you shall}} now hear tell of the goodly adventures of Sir Tristram of Lyonesse; and God grant that <b>you</b> may <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> joy in reading thereof that I shall have in telling {{of them to}} you.|$|R
6000|$|... "I've spent a {{while on}} the high Albertan plains, and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> things yonder; the vast sweep of sky, the rolling waste running on forever. It's all in that picture; how expressed, I don't know--there are only the grades of color, {{scarcely}} a line to gage the distance by. Still, the sense of space is vivid." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why my consent? Your {{brother is}} coming at your invitation, and I suppose <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> right you {{exercise}} {{in his case}} to ask anyone you like without my permission. You may if you think proper invite all the people you have ever met in London, {{and tell them to}} bring their relations and friends with them. I am not the proprietor of Sidmouth." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] he {{said with}} a smile, [...] "I don't imagine for a moment that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> prejudices as our mutual friend M. le Comte de Cambray, who must have made a very violent {{sacrifice}} to his feelings when he admitted me as a guest to his own table. I am sure he must often think that the servants' hall is the proper place for me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then <b>you</b> <b>had</b> another <b>the</b> <b>same,</b> for I am {{weary of}} the sight of it. Let me never see you in it again. Monsieur de Remusat, I make you a good allowance. Why do you not spend it?' ...|$|R
6000|$|First, That {{your family}} and tenants have no {{dependence}} upon the said gentleman, further than by the old agreement, which obligeth <b>you</b> to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> steward, and to regulate your household by such methods as you should both agree to.[79] ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But if {{our money}} should {{by any means}} be {{rendered}} not so much--if we had to stint ourselves a little in purchases that we can afford to make now--would <b>you</b> still <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> confidence in my being quite contented, John?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good," [...] he said, as {{he watched}} the colour come back to her cheeks. [...] "Now listen. You go to your room and ring for your maid. I {{received}} a telegram, as you know, during dinner. It contains news of the serious illness of a near relation at Paris. Your maid has twenty minutes to pack your dressing case for one night, and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time to change into a travelling dress. In twenty minutes we meet in the hall, remember. I will tell you our plans {{on the way to the}} station." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{may call}} {{as often as}} he likes, O'Moore, and I shall be happy to {{converse}} with any friend of yours but, at present, that is all the satisfaction you will get out of me. Duelling is strictly forbidden on the Rock, and there is no getting across the Spanish lines to fight--unless, indeed, you can persuade the governor to send out a flag of truce with us. So we must let the matter rest, till the siege is over; and then, if both of us are alive, and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> mind, we will talk about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{talked with}} his attendants, as I suppose, upon the strange superficiality and {{unreasonableness}} of (man) {{who lives on}} the mere surface of a world, a creature of waves and winds, and all the chances of space, who cannot even unite to overcome the beasts that prey upon his kind, and yet who dares to invade another planet. During this aside I sat thinking, and then at his desire I told him of the different sorts of men. He searched me with questions. 'And {{for all sorts of}} work <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> sort of men. But who thinks? Who governs?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I {{could only}} persuade poor dear Ellen {{to think that}} even if a slight were real, {{it ought to be}} borne forgivingly, and not brooded over. Ah! you are laughing; perhaps <b>you</b> <b>have</b> said <b>the</b> <b>same</b> about me." ...|$|R
60|$|And so I seem To <b>have</b> <b>you</b> still <b>the</b> <b>same</b> In {{one world}} with me.|$|R

Different acts {{may be seen as}} face-threatening or non-face threatening depending on the social distance between speaker and listener ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why do {{we always}} think {{the things we}} had in {{childhood}} better than those we enjoy afterward?" [...] asked Margery, after making one of these comparisons, somewhat to the disadvantage of {{the part of the}} country in which she then was. [...] "I can scarce ever think of home--what I call home, and which was so long a home to me--without shedding tears. Nothing here seems as good of its kind as what I have left behind me. Do <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> longings for Pennsylvania that I feel for the sea-coast and for the rocks about Quincy?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{trust you}} will not," [...] said Lesley; [...] "but as I must, {{for my own}} sake, be anxious to divide so heavy a {{responsibility}} with a capable assistant, allow me to say, that Lieutenant Taffril's gun-brig is come into the roadstead, and he himself is now at old Caxon's, where he lodges. I think <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> degree of acquaintance with him as with me, and, as I am sure I should willingly have rendered you such a service were I not engaged on the other side, I am convinced he will do so at your first request." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Fan," [...] {{said her}} friend, holding {{her a little}} away {{in order to see}} her better, [...] "I have been {{distressing}} myself about you in vain. I could not help thinking that there would be one change after all this time, that your skin would lose that delicacy which makes you look so unfitted for work of any kind. There would be, I thought, a little of that unwholesome pallor and the tired look one so often sees in girls who are confined in shops and have to stand all day on their feet. But <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> fresh look and pure delicate skin; nothing alters you. I do believe that you will never change at all, however long you may live, and never grow old." ...|$|E
60|$|Such {{is the way}} {{the thing}} was done. I think <b>you</b> would <b>have</b> done <b>the</b> <b>same</b> under <b>the</b> circumstances.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes, I {{see what}} you mean. It was a great loss to you in one sense, but of course <b>you</b> couldn't <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> feeling about her {{as in the case}} of Mrs. Chance. She was, I understand, a toothless old hag, more than half-crazy--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "December 22d.--By the way, did {{you ever}} read a Novel? If you ever mean to do so hereafter, let it be Miss Martineau's Deerbrook. It is really very striking; and parts of it are very true and very beautiful. It is not so true, or so {{thoroughly}} clear and harmonious, among delineations of English middle-class gentility, as Miss Austen's books, especially as Pride and Prejudice, which I think exquisite; but it is worth reading. The hour and the Man is eloquent, but an absurd exaggeration.--I hold out so valorously against this Scandinavian weather, that I deserve to be ranked with Odin and Thor; and fancy I may go to live at Clifton or Drontheim. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> icy desolation as prevails here?" ...|$|R
