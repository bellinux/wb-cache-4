2500|$|On 22 May, Regenvanu was {{publicly}} criticised and ridiculed in Parliament by Internal Affairs Minister Patrick Crowby and Minister for Lands Harry Iauko, {{who read}} out an e-mail Regenvanu had been circulating, {{in which the}} young MP broadly accused his fellows of widespread corruption. He had also stated in the e-mail that Speaker of Parliament Maxime Carlot Korman would be [...] "buried" [...] if he attempted {{to stand in the}} 2012 general election. Carlot Korman addressed Regenvanu in these terms: [...] "I, along with your father are veteran politicians. I want you to explain to me what <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>when</b> you say you are going to bury me." [...] Regenvanu was compelled by the Speaker to offer an apology.|$|E
6000|$|... "Your {{terms are}} rather vague," [...] Dr. Hammerfield interrupted. [...] "Just {{precisely}} what do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>when</b> you call us metaphysicians?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Miss Townshead did {{not appear}} contented, but she changed the topic. [...] "Then what did <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>when</b> you spoke about the dress packet?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Lyrically, [...] "What Do You Mean?" [...] {{talks about}} looking for romantic clarity {{and not being}} able to figure out the {{opposite}} sex, with Bieber singing in the chorus: [...] "What do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> / <b>When</b> <b>you</b> nod your head yes, but you wanna say no? / What do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> / <b>When</b> <b>you</b> don't want me to move, but you tell me to go?." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why {{have you}} done this?" [...] he faltered. [...] "Tell me what <b>you</b> <b>mean,</b> man, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> {{say that you were}} {{responsible}} for his disappearance?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Poor Mitchy showed but for {{a moment}} that he felt pulled up. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> that <b>when</b> a girl liked by a fellow likes him so little in return--?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What did <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>when</b> {{you said}} I {{could have given}} you no worse news than that of his coming alone?" [...] she {{questioned}} suddenly.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes,' said Una gravely. 'It isn't {{what you}} say so much. It's what <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>when</b> you say it. Like calling Dan a beast in fun. Only grown-ups don't always understand.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's a {{nice way}} for a baptized Christian to talk," [...] said Barbara, adding, [...] "But Jeekie, what do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>when</b> {{you say that the}} god did not take you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's a {{young person}} comes to us," [...] the servant continued. [...] "I wonder whether <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> her, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> ask for Mrs. Vimpany? The name she gives is Henley." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> that <b>when</b> <b>you</b> {{asked me}} to marry you I should have refused you because I {{did not know what}} money papa would give me? Why did you not ask papa?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Blome, my {{experience}} with such men as you is that you all brag one thing behind my back an' <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> different <b>when</b> I show up. I've called you now. What do you mean?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, thanks," [...] Francis {{answered}}. [...] "The {{last was}} too good to spoil. But you haven't answered my question, Jimmy. What did <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>when</b> you asked if we were going down?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well, Louis," [...] I said. [...] "I am {{perfectly}} agreeable, {{only you}} must {{tell me who}} this Mr. Delora is, why he is in hiding, and who <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>when</b> you say 'we'." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is what <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>when</b> {{you tell}} me I am not wise. I tried it,--with all the power of thought and {{calculation}} that I could give to it, and I found that I could not marry Mr. Gilmore." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{a lovely}} stone floor!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "And your copper kettle, too, is delightful! Do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> that <b>when</b> <b>you</b> have not a lodger here, you cook and do {{everything}} for yourself?" ...|$|R
6000|$|There {{was another}} stillness, {{and then the}} tall man resumed: [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> that <b>when</b> a wise man has to hide a real diamond he {{has been known to}} hide it among sham ones?" ...|$|R
60|$|PURDIE. I will {{introduce}} you to him <b>when</b> <b>you</b> wake up--I <b>mean</b> <b>when</b> he wakes up.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{have heard}} you," [...] said Meyer, when Mr. Clifford had {{finished}} translating, [...] "and {{we wish to}} ask you a question. What do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>when</b> you say that the Spirit of the white woman has been seen?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I believe I did,' said Anne; 'other {{people do}} not know what <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>when</b> you set up your bristles, and I do. Besides, I was sorry for Lucy, who looks as if she had {{sensitiveness}} enough for the whole family.' ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{saw what}} she was driving at, and laughed in spite of myself. [...] "Yes," [...] I said, [...] "I know what <b>you</b> <b>mean.</b> <b>When</b> John Alden is {{pleading}} with Priscilla on behalf of Miles Standish, Priscilla cuts him short by saying----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A good landfall, Gervaise," [...] Ralph said. [...] "The pilot {{has done}} right well. I suppose <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> to anchor <b>when</b> <b>you</b> get there?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Kate {{had looked}} {{surprised}} that, {{as a matter}} of taste on such an adventurer's part, Densher shouldn't see it. But Densher was lost in another thought.

60|$|Q. What do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>when</b> {{you say it}} is {{a fearful}} state?--A. I mean, that it is the lot of those that are cast in thither to be tormented in most fearful manner, to wit, with wrath and fiery indignation (Rom 2:9; Heb 10:26,27).|$|E
6000|$|... "That's a sure thing," [...] Walthew agreed. [...] "However, I guess I {{know what}} <b>you</b> <b>mean.</b> <b>When</b> I pulled up I fancied your friends were {{watching}} for me, and I'd {{have found the}} road blocked if I'd gone on. Don't you think you had better tell me what it's all about?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Cannot leave Monte Carlo?" [...] she {{repeated}} derisively. [...] "Why, my dear man, {{you are a}} {{fish out of water}} here!

60|$|Dorriforth. I {{have already}} guessed those <b>you</b> <b>mean.</b> But <b>when</b> it isn't too much {{a matter of}} the {{paraphernalia}} it is too little a matter of the play. A play nowadays is a rare bird. I should like to see ¦ one. Florentia. There are lots of them, all the while--the newspapers talk about them. People talk about them at dinners.|$|R
6000|$|... "I reckon I {{preferred}} {{to have you}} for a wife than a daughter," [...] said Cranch, [...] "if that's what <b>you</b> <b>mean.</b> <b>When</b> you know me better, Juanita," [...] he continued, gravely, [...] "you'll know that I would never have let you believe I sought in you the one if I had not hoped to find in you the other." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think I {{know the}} one <b>you</b> <b>mean.</b> <b>When</b> I saw {{her she was}} talking to a man whose beating {{whiskers}} dashed high on a stern and rock-bound face.... Thank you, I like that fairly well, too, but unfortunately I stole it from a chap named Haviland. My own idea of witty conversation: is 'Some car you got. What's your magneto?'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{a strange}} faith," [...] said Aziel, [...] "which teaches that the Lord of Heaven can find a home in mortal breasts. But, lady, it is yours, so of it I say no more. Now tell me, if you will, what did <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>when</b> you said that this barbarian king, Ithobal, set the savage whom I slew to kidnap you? Do you know this, or do you suspect it only?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Silence, sir!' {{returned}} his father, 'what do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> by talking, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> see {{people that are}} {{more than two or}} three times your age, sitting still and silent and not dreaming of saying a word?' ...|$|R
6000|$|But {{at last he}} said to Pelias, ‘Why do {{you look}} so sad, my uncle? And what did <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> just now <b>when</b> <b>you</b> {{said that this was}} a doleful kingdom, and its ruler a miserable man?’ ...|$|R
60|$|Q. What do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> by that?--A. <b>When</b> faith, {{which a man}} saith he hath, proveth {{itself to}} be of the right kind by its acts and {{operations}} in the mind of a poor sinner (James 2:19-23).|$|R
