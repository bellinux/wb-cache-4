Bangalter stated: [...] "In Brian Wilson's music <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>really</b> feel the beauty—it was very spiritual. Like Bob Marley, too." [...] When {{questioned}} on the success of Daft Punk's debut album and the rising popularity of their associated musical genre, Bangalter responded, [...] "before us you had Frankie Knuckles or Juan Atkins and so on. The least you can do is pay respect to those who are not known and who have influenced people." [...] The Daft Punk track [...] "Teachers", from Homework, refers to several influences, such as Romanthony and Todd Edwards. Homem-Christo stated: [...] "Their music had a big effect on us. The sound of their productions—the compression, the sound of the kick drum and Romanthony's voice, the emotion and soul—is part of how we sound today." [...] A 2011 Bodytonic podcast featured tracks from all of the artists named in [...] "Teachers", the Brian Wilson speech quoted in the liner notes of Homework, and a Kraftwerk-like 1983 track produced by Daniel Vangarde, father of Bangalter.|$|E

[...] The first song, [...] "Look How I'm Doing", is described as a [...] "kiss off to a former flame", while [...] "Blackout" [...] ( [...] written by Taylor Momsen [...] ) is an ode to Montag's husband, Spencer Pratt.

[...] "Fanatic" [...] is an uptempo song with [...] "an 80's feel", and has been compared to works by Kylie Minogue.

2500|$|About ninety animators {{worked on}} the film {{at one point or}} another; some {{worked on the}} project for as long as two years. [...] In terms of the film's {{animation}} style and settings, the film combines Eastern world culture (predominantly Japanese) with Western world culture (predominantly California). In May 2013, Disney released concept art and rendered footage of San Fransokyo from the film. San Fransokyo, the futuristic mashup of San Francisco and Tokyo, was described by Hall as [...] "an alternate version of San Francisco. Most of the technology is advanced, but much of it feels retro … Where Hiro lives, it feels like the Haight. I love the Painted ladies. We gave them a Japanese makeover; we put a cafe on the bottom of one. They live above a coffee shop." [...] According to production designer Paul Felix, [...] "The topography is exaggerated because what we do is caricature, I think the hills are 1½ times exaggerated. I don't think <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>really</b> walk up them … When you get to the downtown area, that's when you get the most Tokyo-fied, that pure, layered, dense kind of feeling of the commercial district there. When you get out of there, it becomes more San Francisco with the Japanese aesthetic. … (It's a bit like) Blade Runner, but contained to a few square blocks. You see the skyscrapers contrasted with the hills." ...|$|E

As a result, Lillywhite was to told to raise the synthesiser track in the mix, as [...] "in 1986, we were very impressed that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> get <b>really</b> good sounding brass instruments out of a keyboard." ...|$|R

6000|$|Roughly, very roughly, speaking, our destroyers enjoyed {{three phases}} of [...] "prompt decisive action"--the first, {{a period of}} {{daylight}} attacks (from 4 to 6 P.M.) {{such as the one}} I have just described, while the battle was young and the light fairly good on the afternoon of May 31; the second, towards dark, when the light had lessened and the enemy were more uneasy, and, I think, in more scattered formation; the third, when darkness had fallen, and the destroyers had been strung out astern with orders to help the enemy home, which they did all night as opportunity offered. One cannot say whether the day or the night work was the more desperate. From private advices, the young gentlemen concerned seem to have functioned with efficiency either way.

6000|$|Nevertheless he is wrong. But if {{we attempt}} to trace his error in exact terms, we shall not find it quite so easy as we had supposed. Perhaps the nearest {{we can get to}} expressing it is to say this: that his mind moves in a perfect but narrow circle. A small circle is quite as {{infinite}} as a large circle; but, though it is quite as infinite, it is not so large. In the same way the insane explanation is quite as complete as the sane one, but it is not so large. A bullet is quite as round as the world, {{but it is not the}} world. There is such a thing as a narrow universality; there is such a thing as a small and cramped eternity; you may see it in many modern religions. Now, speaking quite externally and empirically, we may say that the strongest and most unmistakable MARK of madness is this combination between a logical completeness and a spiritual contraction. The lunatic's theory explains a large number of things, but it does not explain them in a large way. I mean that if you or I were dealing with a mind that was growing morbid, we should be chiefly concerned not so much to give it arguments as to give it air, to convince it that there was something cleaner and cooler outside the suffocation of a single argument. Suppose, for instance, it were the first case that I took as typical; suppose it were the case of a man who accused everybody of conspiring against him. If we could express our deepest feelings of protest and appeal against this obsession, I suppose we should say something like this: [...] "Oh, I admit that you have your case and have it by heart, and that many things do fit into other things as you say. I admit that your explanation explains a great deal; but what a great deal it leaves out! Are there no other stories in the world except yours; and are all men busy with your business? Suppose we grant the details; perhaps when the man in the street did not seem to see you it was only his cunning; perhaps when the policeman asked you your name it was only because he knew it already. But how much happier you would be if you only knew that these people cared nothing about you! How much larger your life would be if your self could become smaller in it; if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>really</b> look at other men with common curiosity and pleasure; if you could see them walking as they are in their sunny selfishness and their virile indifference! You would begin to be interested in them, because they were not interested in you. You would break out of this tiny and tawdry theatre in which your own little plot is always being played, and you would find yourself under a freer sky, in a street full of splendid strangers." [...] Or suppose it were the second case of madness, that of a man who claims the crown, your impulse would be to answer, [...] "All right! Perhaps you know that you are the King of England; but why do you care? Make one magnificent effort and you will be a human being and look down on all the kings of the earth." [...] Or it might be the third case, of the madman who called himself Christ. If we said what we felt, we should say, [...] "So you are the Creator and Redeemer of the world: but what a small world it must be! What a little heaven you must inhabit, with angels no bigger than butterflies! How sad it must be to be God; and an inadequate God! Is there really no life fuller and no love more marvellous than yours; and is it really in your small and painful pity that all flesh must put its faith? How much happier you would be, how much more of you there would be, if the hammer of a higher God could smash your small cosmos, scattering the stars like spangles, and leave you in the open, free like other men to look up as well as down!" ...|$|E

According to Rapf, Walt Disney [...] "ended every conference by saying 'Well, I think we've really licked it now.' Then he'd call you the next morning and say, 'I've got a new idea.'

To be sure, you might say that if a fellow came along and offered to pay you fifty cents for {{changing}} a ten-dollar bill, you had a right to take it; but there was a voice in Lemuel's heart which warned him that greed to another's hurt was sin, and that if you took too much for a thing from a necessitous person, you oppressed and robbed him. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> make it appear otherwise, but <b>you</b> <b>could</b> not <b>really</b> change the nature of the act. He owned this with a sigh, and he owned himself justly punished.
