Hanada waits at the gymnasium but Number One does not show. As a bedraggled Hanada rises to leave, a tape recorder switches on explaining, [...] "This is the way Number One works", he exhausts <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> kills you. Hanada puts a headband across his forehead and climbs into a boxing ring. Number One appears and shoots him. The headband stops the bullet and Hanada returns fire. Number One slumps to the ground but manages to shoot him a few times before dying. Hanada leaps and staggers around the ring declaring himself the new Number One. Misako enters the arena and, crazed, he instinctively shoots her dead, then falls from the ring.|$|E
500|$|Paige {{has gained}} herself a {{reputation}} as someone who can be [...] "difficult". [...] The Times Brian Logan wrote, [...] "Paige is not exactly known for her humility. In newspaper profiles, that dread word 'difficult' is often applied". On one occasion, she told a male interviewer {{that she was going}} to stop giving interviews to female reporters because, in her own words, [...] "I don't trust other women in these situations. They establish a sisterhood with <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> betray it every time". What has been seen as a cold side to her personality was also noted by Logan, but Paige has said that a common misconception of her is that she is confident and very serious. [...] Another editor found her [...] "refreshingly down-to-earth" [...] and [...] "very friendly".|$|E
500|$|After the {{distress}} of 1897, Victoria sought {{to reassure the}} Munshi. [...] "I have in my Testamentary arrangements secured your comfort," [...] she wrote to him, [...] "and have constantly thought of you well. The long letter I enclose which was written nearly a month ago is entirely and solely my own idea, not a human being will ever know of it or what you answer me. If you can't read it I will help <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> burn it at once." [...] She told Reid the squabbles placed her and the Munshi under strain, which he replied was unlikely in the latter's case [...] "judging from his robust appearance and undiminished stoutness". Lord Salisbury told Reid he thought it unlikely in her case too, and that she secretly enjoyed the arguments because they were [...] "the only form of excitement she can have".|$|E

5000|$|Paul Benjamin Lowney (March 25, 1917 [...] - [...] May 12, 2007) was a Seattle-based {{author and}} humorist. He wrote 29 books and three comic strips, most mixing humor, philosophy, and {{whimsical}} illustrations by his frequent collaborator Frank Renlie. Saturday Review described his work by saying, [...] "Sometimes Lowney makes <b>you</b> think <b>and</b> <b>then</b> laugh; <b>and</b> sometimes he makes <b>you</b> laugh <b>and</b> <b>then</b> think." ...|$|R

It's really about the obstacles of trying to let it go, but at the same time how great it makes you feel, so it's hard to let it go. Again, it goes back to a story that we all can relate to... It's not Rihanna's story; it's her story in the video, and she's acting. But everybody's [...] Obviously, there's a lot of comparisons to her real life, and that's not at all the intention. It's just that I guess people naturally go there because art imitates life, and it's a story we all relate to and we've all experienced. Like, it's based on my life; it's based on her life; it's based on your life, like, everybody.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "White Horse" [...] {{was directed by}} Trey Fanjoy, who directed the majority of Swift's prior videos. Swift commented that Fanjoy was her first choice to film the video because she understood the direction Swift wanted to take {{and how to make}} the video different than the prior ones they filmed. The video's plot centered on infidelity. However, because the theme had appeared on the video for [...] "Picture to Burn", the scenario was reversed, rather than removed entirely, for Swift thought it was inevitable to include it. It was conceptualized so that Swift was not the person who someone was unfaithful to, but rather the one who someone was unfaithful with: [...] "This girl falls in love with this guy and he's perfect. He's adorable. He's charming. He's endearing. She falls in love with him. Then, she comes to realize that he's been leading a double life. He was already in a relationship years before he ever met her [...] You find out that I'm the one that was ruining a relationship without even knowing it." [...] Swift chose actor Stephen Colletti to portray the role of her love interest. She had previously seen him on the reality television series , where she acknowledged him to be [...] "cute", and later on One Tree Hill, where she was impressed by his acting skills; thus, Colletti was contacted to portray the character. Swift chose Colletti primarily because of his sweet and endearing demeanor. As a result, the character would seem very loyal, as though he would never betray his partner. Therefore, others did not expect for him to betray Swift either. [...] "That's always the hardest thing, when someone has you fooled so much that you think they're never gonna hurt <b>you.</b> <b>And</b> <b>then</b> they do. That's when you get the worst heartbreak", Swift said.|$|E

The team's scrounger, he can get {{virtually}} anything he sets his mind to, usually exploiting women with sympathy-appeal and flirtation. However, he is not without integrity, as stated by Murdock in the episode [...] "Family Reunion": [...] "He would rip the shirt off his back for <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> scam one for himself." [...] Faceman is also the A-Team's accountant. He dresses suavely, often appearing in suits. Faceman carries a Colt Lawman Mk III revolver for protection, and drives a custom white 1984 Corvette with orange trim.|$|E

2500|$|Whenever {{shooting}} {{was taking place}} there was pressure on everyone involved, but the cast had a positive experience. Norton said that normally in movie production half the people can [...] "check out" [...] due to repetitive aspects, but during the shooting of Birdman [...] "everybody's on, the whole thing, and you're all on pins and needles because you're all relying on forty other people not to drop the ball." [...] Because of this, Stone said the director {{was able to get}} the best out of the cast, saying [...] " [...] creates this sort of fury in <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> you end up realizing that he just got so much out of you that you didn't even know you had". Naomi Watts commented that the atmosphere [...] "felt emblematic of how it feels onstageat least my long-time memories from long ago". Andrea Riseborough, meanwhile, described the process as [...] "wonderful", mentioning how it was possible to hear the filming of a sequence from far away before the camera arrived and then [...] "the magic happens with <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> everything leaves you, and everything's silent". Once they successfully completed a take though, it was obvious to everybody involved. Norton said [...] "I've never, ever been on a set where every day ended with an enormous, authentic sort of cheer at having made it. You're waiting for the scream from [...] and everybody was genuinely excited." ...|$|E

[...] In that supposed event, you say, you will destroy the Union; and then, you say, the great crime of having destroyed it will be upon us! [...] That is cool.

2500|$|By {{late fall}} {{his team was}} playing well against major Negro league teams. On September 22, 1939, {{in the second game}} of a double-header against the {{powerful}} American Giants, Paige won a 1–0 game, striking out 10 men in the seven innings before the game was called on account of darkness. Buck O'Neil, who had batted against Paige in 1935 and 1936 and faced him again in a game against the parent Monarchs, recalled a dropoff in speed but an improvement in deception. [...] "He could still throw hard. Not as hard as he had thrown, but you're talkin' about somebody thrown' ninety-eight, a hundred miles an hour. But now he's throwin' maybe ninety—which is still more than the average guy... He was the best and, actually, he was so deceptive! You'd look at that big ol' slow arm movin' and—chooo—that ball's just right by <b>you.</b> <b>And</b> <b>then</b> he'd come up and throw you a change of pace and, oh, man." ...|$|E
