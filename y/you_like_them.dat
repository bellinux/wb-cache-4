500|$|In {{contrast}} to the moderately negative feedback {{the third and fourth}} seasons received, Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said of the fifth season: [...] "Overall, it feels more like the good old days than Grey's Anatomy has in a long time." [...] Misha Davenport from the Chicago Sun-Times said season five [...] "hits on all the things the show does so well", adding: [...] "There is romance, heartbreak, humor and a few moments that will move fans to tears." [...] Brian Lowry of Variety, less impressed, opinionated that the season five displayed the show running out of storylines. Speaking of the sixth season, Bianco of USA Today wrote: [...] "Grey's has always loved grand gestures. <b>You</b> <b>like</b> <b>them</b> or you don't; the only real question is whether the show pulls them off or it doesn't. This year, it did." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{band was}} {{still searching for}} a lead singer. Chimes recalls one Billy Watts (who [...] "seemed to be, like, {{nineteen}} or eighteen then, as we all were") handling the duties for a time. Rhodes had his eye on Strummer, with whom he made exploratory contact. Jones and Levene had both seen him perform and were impressed as well. Strummer, for his part, was primed to make the switch. In April, he had taken in the opening act {{for one of his}} band's gigs—the Sex Pistols. Strummer later explained:I knew something was up, so I went out in the crowd which was fairly sparse. And I saw the future—with a snotty handkerchief—right in front of me. It was immediately clear. Pub rock was, [...] "Hello, you bunch of drunks, I'm gonna play these boogies and I hope you like them." [...] The Pistols came out that Tuesday evening and their attitude was, [...] "Here's our tunes, and we couldn't give a flying fuck whether <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>them</b> or not. In fact, we're gonna play them even if you fucking hate them."On 30 May, Rhodes and Levene met surreptitiously with Strummer after a 101'ers gig. Strummer was invited to meet up at the band's rehearsal location on Davis Road. After Strummer turned up, Levene grabbed his guitar, stood several inches away from Strummer, {{looked him in the eye}} and then began playing [...] "Keys to Your Heart", one of Strummer's own tunes.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his review}} for The Hollywood Reporter, Arthur Knight wrote [...] "Coonskin is not anti-black. Nor is it anti-Jewish, anti-Italian, or anti-American, {{all of whom}} fall prey to Bakshi's wicked caricaturist's pen as {{intensely}} {{as any of the}} blacks in his movie. What Bakshi is against, as this film makes abundantly clear, is the cheats, the rip-off artists, the hypocrites, the phonies, the con men, and the organized criminals of this world, regardless of race, color, or creed." [...] The film is most critical in its portrayal of the Mafia. According to Bakshi, [...] "I was incensed at all the hero worship of those guys in The Godfather; Pacino and Caan did such a great job of making <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>them.</b> [...] One thing that stunned me about The Godfather movie: here's a mother who gives birth to children, and her husband essentially gets all her sons killed. In Coonskin, she gets her revenge, but also gets shot. She turns into a butterfly and gets crushed. [...] These [...] guys don't give you any room." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Jack Benny Show had {{previously}} included a Jewish-accented character, [...] "Shlepperman [...] ", played by Sam Hearn, {{but it was}} discontinued in the late 1930s. In 1946 Auerbach {{was hired as a}} [...] permanent, although only occasional, character, Mr. Kitzel (sometimes spelled [...] "Kitzle [...] "). In January he made his first appearance as a hot dog vendor at the Rose Bowl game Jack was attending. His appearance went over so well with the audience and Benny himself that he returned the next week. As the hot dog vendor he became famous for the catch phrase [...] "The pickle in the middle with the mustard on top." [...] In 1946 this catch phrase was turned into a novelty song, written by Jack Benny Show writer John Tackaberry and songwriter Carl Sigman, featuring Auerbach as the singer. With the lyrics [...] "The pickle in the middle with the mustard on top. Just the way <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>them</b> and they're all red hot.", the song became popular in the late 1940s. The song led to his being named Man of the Year by the National Pickle Packers Association. His other catch phrase was the exclamation [...] "hoo hoo, hooo! [...] " [...] usually delivered {{in response to a question}} from Jack. Auerbach's Mr. Kitzel was unique among the characters on the show as being the only one not to treat Jack disparagingly. [...] His character moved with the show when it made the transition from radio to television and he continued to appear until his death.|$|E
