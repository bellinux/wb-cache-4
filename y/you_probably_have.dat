5|$|I {{wanted to}} speak a little about people who {{impressed}} the most, and somehow I kept on ignoring his performances in my previous two banters during this Olympiad, which is ridiculous, but I think pride of place goes to Eugenio Torre. You probably know who he is, and <b>you</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> read about his results by now, but what he achieved during this Olympiad is absolutely tremendous. He {{is by no means}} a young man by now and he... played a tremendous level of opposition. The Philippines are a decently strong team and they played very, very decent opposition almost throughout the tournament. The result Eugenio showed in this event is absolutely fantastic.|$|E
500|$|To {{understand}} {{his place in}} modern music <b>you</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> to first go back to punk rock and its misguided attempt to kick aside {{what remained of the}} psychedelic 1960s. Given that the Clash and Sex Pistols had made brutal social commentary obligatory, there seemed little room for any of the creative exotica that had defined the Love Decade - until, slowly but surely, singing about dead-end lives and dole queues began to pall, and {{at least some of the}} previous generation were rehabilitated. Barrett was the best example: having crashed out of Pink Floyd before the advent of indulgent [...] "progressive" [...] rock, and succumbed to a fate that appealed to the punk generation's nihilism, he underwent a revival." ...|$|E
500|$|It is {{very unusual}} {{to find a}} helmet of this type on a native {{ceremonial}} site. It was probably made between 25 and 50 AD, close to {{the date of the}} conquest of Britain in 43 AD; this makes it one of the earliest Roman helmets ever found in Britain. Other British examples of later date were found in isolation away from settlements, as in the cases of the Guisborough Helmet and Crosby Garrett Helmet, or on Roman sites, as with the Newstead Helmet. Various suggestions have been put forward as to why the helmet ended up at Hallaton; it may have been owned by a Briton who served in the Roman cavalry, {{it may have been a}} diplomatic gift from the Romans or it may have been captured in war. According to Dr Jeremy Hill of the British Museum, the first explanation is the most likely: [...] "Here <b>you</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> a situation where local Britons are fighting on the Roman side." [...] The Roman cavalry at this time was mostly recruited from native allies, not Italians, suggesting that Britons fought alongside the Romans as they carried out their conquest of Britain.|$|E

500|$|At {{the time}} of its initial release, Don't Look Now was {{generally}} well received by critics, although some criticised it for being [...] "arty and mechanical". Jay Cocks for Time, wrote that [...] "Don't Look Now is such a rich, complex and subtle experience that it demands more than one viewing", while Variety commented that the film's visual flourishes made it [...] "much more than merely a well-made psycho-horror thriller". Pauline Kael writing for The New Yorker was more reserved in her praise, considering the film to be [...] "the fanciest, most carefully assembled enigma yet put on the screen" [...] but that there was a [...] "distasteful clamminess about the picture", while Gordon Gow of Films and Filming felt that it fell short of the aspirations of Nicolas Roeg's previous two films, Performance and Walkabout, but it was nevertheless a thriller of some depth. Vincent Canby, reviewer for The New York Times, on the other hand, criticised the film for a lack of suspense which he put down to a twist that comes halfway through rather than at the end, and at which point it [...] "stops being suspenseful and becomes an elegant travelogue that treats us to second-sightseeing in Venice". Canby also suggested that second sight was not convincing on screen, since it appeared simply like flash-forward which is a standard story-telling device in films, and concluded that [...] "Not only do <b>you</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> better things to do, but so, I'm sure, do most of the people connected with the film." ...|$|E

60|$|In dismissing this subject, {{which is}} every way delicate, I shall merely say that usage tolerates a license of speech, of which <b>you</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> no idea, but that I think one hears very rarely from a French woman of {{condition}} little {{that would not}} be uttered by an American female under similar circumstances.

A fine mess it must have made in the minds of simple German maidens, in their notion of the Virgin at home! I cannot show you this Annunciation; but I have under my hand one of Holbein's Bible cuts, of the deepest seriousness and import--his illustration of the Canticles, showing the Church as the bride of Christ.|$|E

60|$|To {{begin with}} this matter of education. <b>You</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> nearly all seen the admirable lecture lately given by Captain Maxse, at Southampton. It {{contains}} a clear {{statement of the}} facts at present ascertained as to our expenditure in that respect. It appears that of our public moneys, for every pound that we spend on education we spend twelve either in charity or punishment;--ten millions a year in pauperism and crime, and eight hundred thousand in instruction. Now Captain Maxse adds to this estimate of ten millions public money spent on crime and want, {{a more or less}} conjectural sum of eight millions for private charities. My impression is that this is much beneath the truth, but at all events it leaves out of consideration much the heaviest and saddest form of charity--the maintenance, by the working members of families, of the unfortunate or ill-conducted persons whom the general course of misrule now leaves helpless to be the burden of the rest.|$|E
