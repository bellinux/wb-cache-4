5|$|After exhibiting {{in small}} {{galleries}} in Shoreditch, London, the Stuckists' first {{show in a}} major public museum was held in 2004 at the Walker Art Gallery, {{as part of the}} Liverpool Biennial. The group has demonstrated annually at Tate Britain against the Turner Prize since 2000, sometimes dressed in clown costumes. They have also come out in opposition to the Charles Saatchi-patronised <b>Young</b> <b>British</b> <b>Artists.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1993, Jake and Dinos Chapman of the <b>Young</b> <b>British</b> <b>Artists</b> {{movement}} created 82 miniature, toy-like sculptures modelled on The Disasters of War. The {{works were}} widely acclaimed and purchased that {{year by the}} Tate gallery. For decades, Goya's series of etching served as a constant point of reference for the Chapman brothers; in particular, they created a number of variations based on the plate Grande hazaña! Con muertos!.|$|E
5|$|The area is {{also home}} to a number of {{commercial}} and public art galleries; including the newly expanded Whitechapel Gallery. The artists Gilbert and George have long made their home and workshop in Spitalfields, and the neighbourhood around Hoxton Square has become a centre for modern British art, including the White Cube gallery, with many artists from the <b>Young</b> <b>British</b> <b>Artists</b> movement living and working in the area. This has made the area around Hoxton and Shoreditch fashionable, with many former residents now driven out by higher property prices, and a busy nightlife has developed, with over 80 licensed premises around Shoreditch.|$|E

25|$|In 1999, Thomson was the co-founder, with Billy Childish of the Stuckism art group, {{which set}} out to promote figurative painting, in {{opposition}} to conceptual art, which they identified with the Turner Prize (whose jury chairman was Sir Nicholas Serota) and the <b>Young</b> <b>British</b> <b>Artists,</b> of which Tracey Emin (who had once been {{in a relationship with}} Childish) was a leading representative.|$|E
25|$|Cohen {{is one of}} the world's most {{influential}} and prolific collectors of British and international contemporary art. He began collecting Modern British art in the 1970s and in the early 1990s became a patron and supporter of the <b>Young</b> <b>British</b> <b>Artists</b> (YBAs). He also collected American and German art of the 1980s and 1990s, contemporary Japanese art (especially the Superflat movement) and more recently has added contemporary Chinese and Indian art to his interests. Every year he is listed in ARTnews magazine's list of ‘The World's Top 200 Collectors’ and {{is often referred to as}} the Medici of the North.|$|E
25|$|Chadwick began exhibiting {{regularly}} from 1977, gradually building {{her reputation}} as an artist. Her rise into the public sphere was marked by the inclusion of her work Ego Geometria Sum (1983) in a group exhibition entitled Summer Show I (1983) at the Serpentine. In 1985 she began an active teaching career as a visiting lecturer across a number of London art schools. Her posts at Goldsmiths (1985–90), Chelsea College of Arts, London (1985–95), Central Saint Martins, London (1987–95) and the Royal College of Art (1990–94) ensured an important influence on contemporary British Art in the late 1980s and ‘90s, specifically on the <b>Young</b> <b>British</b> <b>Artists.</b>|$|E

25|$|In 1991, Charles Saatchi {{had offered}} to fund {{whatever}} artwork Hirst wanted to make, {{and the result was}} showcased in 1992 in the first <b>Young</b> <b>British</b> <b>Artists</b> exhibition at the Saatchi Gallery in North London. Hirst's work was titled The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living and was a shark in formaldehyde in a vitrine, and sold for £50,000. The shark had been caught by a commissioned fisherman in Australia and had cost £6,000. The exhibition also included In a Thousand Years. As a result of the show, Hirst was nominated for that year's Turner Prize, but it was awarded to Grenville Davey.|$|E
500|$|British {{attitudes to}} modern art were [...] "polarised" [...] {{at the end}} of the 19th century. Modernist {{movements}} were both cherished and vilified by artists and critics; Impressionism was initially regarded by [...] "many conservative critics" [...] as a [...] "subversive foreign influence", but became [...] "fully assimilated" [...] into British art during the early-20th century. Representational art was described by Herbert Read during the interwar period as [...] "necessarily... revolutionary", and was studied and produced to such an extent that by the 1950s, Classicism was effectively void in British visual art. Post-modern, contemporary British art, particularly that of the <b>Young</b> <b>British</b> <b>Artists,</b> has been pre-occupied with postcolonialism, and [...] "characterised by a fundamental concern with material culture... perceived as a post-imperial cultural anxiety".|$|E

2500|$|Under the {{direction}} of the former exhibitions secretary Norman Rosenthal, the Academy has hosted ambitious exhibitions of contemporary art. In its 1997 [...] "Sensation," [...] it displayed the collection of work by <b>Young</b> <b>British</b> <b>Artists</b> owned by Charles Saatchi. The show was controversial for its display of Marcus Harvey's portrait of Myra Hindley, a convicted murderer. The painting was vandalised while on display.|$|E

2500|$|Post-modern, {{contemporary}} British art, {{particularly that}} of the <b>Young</b> <b>British</b> <b>Artists,</b> has been said to be [...] "characterised by a fundamental concern with material culture... perceived as a post-imperial cultural anxiety". [...] The annual Turner Prize, founded in 1984 and organized by the Tate, has developed as a highly publicized showcase for contemporary British art. [...] Among the beneficiaries have been {{several members of the}} <b>Young</b> <b>British</b> <b>Artists</b> (YBA) movement, which includes Damien Hirst, Rachel Whiteread, and Tracey Emin, who rose to prominence after the Freeze exhibition of 1988, with the backing of Charles Saatchi and achieved international recognition with their version of conceptual art. This often featured installations, notably Hirst's vitrine containing a preserved shark. The Tate gallery and eventually the Royal Academy also gave them exposure. The influence of Saatchi's generous and wide-ranging patronage was to become a matter of some controversy, as was that of Jay Jopling, the most influential London gallerist.|$|E
2500|$|Tracey Emin, CBE, RA (born 3 July 1963) is an English {{contemporary}} artist {{known for}} her autobiographical and confessional artwork.

5000|$|In 1993, artists Sarah Lucas and Tracey Emin {{took over}} a disused shop in London's East End and, with other artists friends {{including}} Damien Hirst, sold T-shirts, mugs and other customized items as works of art. This artist-led approach to selling art directly to the public not only re-popularised the artists multiple, but was a key moment in the subsequent <b>Young</b> <b>British</b> <b>Artist</b> era, culminating in the Charles Saatchi collected [...] "Sensation" [...] exhibition.|$|R
5000|$|Michael Hogan {{wrote in}} The Daily Telegraph:A {{counterpoint}} to Waldemar Januszczak's Ugly Beauty treatise last week, which insisted that beauty exists in contemporary art {{if you know}} where to look, Scruton's view is much more conservative. ... En route, Scruton namechecks many of the same modern artists as Januszczak: Carl Andre's bricks, the kitsch of Jeff Koons and the <b>Young</b> <b>British</b> <b>Artist</b> movement. His is a passionate argument, eloquently put, if perhaps a reactionary one.|$|R
