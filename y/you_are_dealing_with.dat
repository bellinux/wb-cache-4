2500|$|Former {{executive}} producer Niall Mathews believes the soap's success {{is due to}} the large cast and the fact that no single character or group of characters dominates. [...] "Difficulties are inherent if <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> just one family", he says. [...] "Look at Dallas and Dynasty; both did well at the beginning, but because all the action was centred on a single family, the writers ran out of things to say." ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{were mixed}} reviews for the highly publicised storyline (dubbed [...] "Get Johnny Week") {{involving}} the Mitchell brothers reunion in 2006. It was criticised as [...] "patchy" [...] and [...] "awkwardly written... unveiling a common {{weakness in the}} EastEnders camp, that character continuity can often fall by the wayside when <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> larger characters". Additionally, the show was criticised for turning the brothers into a comical farce by incorporating uncharacteristic humour into their dialect, which was described as [...] "cringeworthy." ...|$|E
2500|$|During 1982, Mussolini {{released}} a pop music album of romantic songs {{under the title}} Amore on Alfa Records; the album was released only in Japan and has since {{become something of a}} collectors item. Mussolini also appeared as a glamour model, including on the cover of two European editions of Playboy, in Italy (August 1983) and Germany (November 1983).

5000|$|He often punctuated speeches with {{phrases like}} [...] "Dogs of the Fascist bourgeoisie," [...] "mad dogs of Trotskyism," [...] "dregs of society," [...] "decayed people," [...] "terrorist thugs and degenerates," [...] and [...] "accursed vermin." [...] This dehumanization aided in what {{historian}} Arkady Vaksberg calls [...] "a hitherto unknown type of trial {{where there was}} not the slightest need for evidence: what evidence did you need when <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> 'stinking carrion' and 'mad dogs'?" ...|$|R
2500|$|In January 2006, {{speaking}} to GameSpot, De Martini {{said of the}} delay, [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> a property like The Godfather, {{you have to take}} special care in making sure your work meets the level fans have come to expect from the franchise. With this fiction in our game, we had to hit a home run. I am tremendously thankful that EA gave our team the time we needed to get it right. I think it turned a good game into a great one." ...|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{after being}} appointed, he {{outlined}} {{his views on}} social security: [...] "Every party should want to see welfare spending come down. That should be an aspiration {{for all of us}} because what you're saying is we are working towards a society where there are fewer people caught in dependency, fewer people who are out of work and need that intervention from the state." [...] He also said: [...] "You have always got to handle issues of welfare with care because <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> support mechanisms for Britain's most vulnerable people".|$|E
2500|$|The US position, as {{presented}} to the UN General Assembly {{a month before the}} incident by President George W. Bush, was that sovereign states have [...] "an obligation to govern responsibly, and solve problems before they spill across borders. We have an obligation to prevent our territory from being used as a sanctuary for terrorism and proliferation and human trafficking and organized crime." [...] Anthony Cordesman, an analyst at the US Center for Strategic and International Studies, said about the raid that, [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> states that do not maintain their sovereignty and become a de facto sanctuary, the only way {{you have to deal with}} them is this kind of operation." ...|$|E
5000|$|But actually, {{he thought}} as he readjusted the Ministry of Plenty's figures, it was not even forgery. It was merely the {{substitution}} of one piece of nonsense for another. Most of the material that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> had no connection with anything in the real world, not even the kind of connection that is contained in a direct lie. Statistics were just as much a fantasy in their original version as in their rectified version. A great <b>deal</b> of time <b>you</b> <b>were</b> expected to make them up out of your head.|$|R

2500|$|A {{certain level}} of {{criticism}} was aimed at the character due to the stark personality change he underwent circa 2000. One reporter commented [...] "Formerly the milder-mannered sibling, Phil has gone from Abel to Cain without an intervening period of plausibility. And it doesn't suit him". His violent tendencies have also been spoofed by the television series 2DTV. There were mixed reviews for the highly publicised storyline (dubbed Get Johnny Week) involving the Mitchell brothers reunion in 2006. It was criticised as [...] "patchy" [...] and [...] "awkwardly written...unveiling a common weakness in the EastEnders camp, that character continuity can often fall by the wayside when <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> larger characters".

2500|$|After season 3, {{he decided}} to hand the project to Stephen Hillenburg, who {{performed}} most work for season 4; Murray continued to manage the cartoon. He {{said that he would}} completely leave the production after season 4. He said also that he encouraged the network to continue production, but Nickelodeon eventually decided to cancel the series. He described all fifty-two episodes as [...] "top notch", and in his view the quality of a television show may decline as production continues [...] "when <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> volume". On his website he said that, [...] "In some ways it succeeded and in some ways failed. All I know it developed its own flavor and an equally original legion of fans." [...] In a 1997 interview Murray said that he at times wondered if he could restart the series; he feels the task would be difficult.|$|E

Other guides include the Hitchhiker's Guide to Blogging, the Hitchhiker's Guide to Deadlines and the Hitchhiker's Guide to How to be Cool which discusses how an individual can truly be cool, instead of by following crowds, but concludes by suggesting the listener attend a showing of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. The Guide to Websites, which only appeared on the official UK movie website, described a website as [...] "a wonderful new invention that allows people you neither know nor care about to inform you what they had for breakfast this morning, without all that tedious mucking about in the postal system". The Guide to Fanboys, written by Touchstone Pictures' copywriters as part of their promotion of the movie, only ever appeared as website text. Though released {{at the same time as}} the iTunes entries, it was never intended to be recorded and is otherwise unconnected with the Fry/Talbot/Browse works.|$|E

25|$|Researchers from The Harvard Negotiation Project {{recommend}} that negotiators explore {{a number of}} alternatives to the problems they face {{in order to reach}} the best solution, but this is often not the case (as when <b>you</b> may <b>be</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> an individual using soft or hard bargaining tactics) (Forsyth, 2010).|$|R
2500|$|After this {{somewhat}} strained but greatly productive discussion concerning arms, {{the negotiations}} between the two delegations became more general, with Ford admitting the challenge posed by economic difficulties in the United States and Brezhnev explaining that some members of his Politburo did not think d√©tente was a prudent strategy, whom he knew would be highly critical of him if he made too many concessions to the Americans. Then, somewhat to Ford's surprise, Brezhnev began talking in considerable detail about the United States Congress, which the Soviets {{had come to see}} as potentially detrimental to their ability to negotiate with American presidents. Trying to plan for the future, Brezhnev asked Ford, [...] "What kind of a Congress will <b>you</b> <b>be</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> for the next two years?", to which Ford replied, [...] "Mr. General Secretary...I can only say that my fingers are crossed." ...|$|R
2500|$|Eugene {{crossed the}} Alps with some 30,000 men in May/June 1701. After {{a series of}} {{brilliant}} manoeuvres the Imperial commander defeated Catinat at the Battle of Carpi on 9 July. [...] "I have warned you that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> an enterprising young prince," [...] wrote Louis XIV to his commander, [...] "he does not tie himself down {{to the rules of}} war." [...] On 1 September Eugene defeated Catinat's successor, Marshal Villeroi, at the Battle of Chiari, in a clash as destructive as any in the Italian theatre. But as so often throughout his career the Prince faced war on two fronts‚Äîthe enemy in the field and the government in Vienna. Starved of supplies, money and men, Eugene was forced into unconventional means against the vastly superior enemy. During a daring raid on Cremona on the night of 31 January/1 February 1702 Eugene captured the French commander-in-chief. Yet the coup was less successful than hoped: Cremona remained in French hands, and the Duke of Vend√¥me, whose talents far exceeded Villeroi's, became the theatre's new commander. Villeroi's capture caused a sensation in Europe, and had a galvanising effect on English public opinion. [...] "The surprise at Cremona," [...] wrote the diarist John Evelyn, [...] "‚Ä¶ was the greate discourse of this weeke"; but appeals for succour from Vienna remained unheeded, forcing Eugene to seek battle and gain a 'lucky hitt'. The resulting Battle of Luzzara on 15 August proved inconclusive. Although Eugene's forces inflicted double the number of casualties on the French the battle settled little except to deter Vend√¥me trying an all-out assault on Imperial forces that year, enabling Eugene to hold on south of the Alps. With his army rotting away, and personally grieving for his long standing friend Prince Commercy who had died at Luzzara, Eugene returned to Vienna in January 1703.|$|E
