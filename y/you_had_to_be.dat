500|$|Romeo Void {{formed at}} the San Francisco Art Institute in February 1979. Vocalist Debora Iyall {{occasionally}} visited the Bay Area to see Patti Smith perform. She {{decided to pursue}} an art education after reading a fortune cookie. [...] "It was in the late '70s at the Indochina Friendship Booth at the annual Fourth of July streetfair in Eureka, California," [...] she said. [...] "I got a fortune cookie that said 'Art is your fate, don't debate.' That next January, I was enrolled in an art school in San Francisco." [...] She began frequenting the Mabuhay Gardens, a popular nightclub, to see local alternative rock groups like The Nuns, the Mutants, Crime, and the Avengers. She also formed the Mummers and Poppers, a punk parody band that covered 1960s tunes with guitarist Peter Woods, Charles Hagan and drummer Jay Derrah, [...] Iyall was originally hesitant to perform because she was overweight: [...] "After seeing Patti Smith, I still had it {{in my mind that}} <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> skinny to be up there , but after going to the Mabuhay [...] you just do whatever you want, be whoever you want, just make it happen." ...|$|E
500|$|You {{could say}} that five hundred years ago was the basis of blood quantum in Ibero-America. But in Anglo-America, while there was some preoccupation with it, it was not formalized until {{the passage of the}} General Allotment Act, mid-1880s. At that point they began to define Indian as being someone who was demonstrably and documentably of at least one-quarter by quantum blood {{indigenous}} in a given group. You couldn't be an eighth Cheyenne and an eighth Arapaho and be an Indian. <b>You</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a quarter Cheyenne or a quarter Arapaho or hopefully a quarter and a quarter. The reason for this was quite clear. They were identifying Indians for purposes of allotting them individual parcels of land in the existing reservation base at that point. If they ran out of Indians identifiable as such, then the rest of the land would be declared surplus. So it was clearly {{in the interests of the}} government to create a definition of Indianness that would minimize the number of Indians that were available. It was an economic motivation for the application of this genetic criteria to Indianness in the first place. It's become increasingly so ever since." [...] (...) ...|$|E
500|$|Still {{hoping to}} work on Cheers, Mirkin sent a spec script of an episode of Taxi to Cheers writers Ken Levine and David Isaacs. The two {{approved}} and offered Mirkin a freelance job writing one of the final nine episodes of the show's first season, pending their commissioning by NBC. The episodes were commissioned, but Mirkin's agent rejected the Cheers job without telling his client, failing to see why Mirkin would want {{to work on}} {{what was then the}} lowest-rated comedy on television. Mirkin sacked the agent and signed on with Robb Rothman. Rothman knew Dan Wilcox, the executive producer of Newhart, which like Cheers was more character-focused. Rothman persuaded Wilcox to hire Mirkin. Mirkin wrote a freelance script and in 1984 beat seven other writers to a staff position on the series. He served as a writer and supervising story editor, before being promoted to executive producer and showrunner after one and a half years. Mirkin [...] "felt [...] was where I belonged. I'd finally come to a place in my life where everything I'd ever wanted had come together." [...] In 1987, he received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series for Newhart. It was the first nomination the show had received in that category and for the first episode Mirkin wrote as the series' showrunner. Mirkin directed several of the Newhart episodes he wrote because he saw directing as [...] "a means of protecting the writing". A philosophy he carried into his later work, Mirkin felt that [...] "being the head writer... was not enough; you had to see the material through its execution– especially the weirder stuff. <b>You</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> right there to make sure every sick idea didn't lose any disturbing nuance." [...] Mirkin left Newhart in 1988, desiring to work on a single-camera sitcom.|$|E

2500|$|Buffett {{began calling}} his music [...] "drunken Caribbean rock 'n' roll" [...] {{as he says}} on his 1978 live album <b>You</b> <b>Had</b> <b>To</b> <b>Be</b> There. Later, Buffett himself and others have used the term [...] "gulf and western" [...] to {{describe}} his musical style and that of other similar-sounding performers. The name derives from elements in Buffett's early music including musical influence from country and western, along with folk rock and lyrical themes from the Gulf of Mexico coast. A music critic described Buffett's music as a combination of [...] "tropical languor with country funkiness into what some [...] called the Key West sound, or Gulf-and-western."
