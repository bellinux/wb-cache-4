25|$|Brake discs and pads require {{sometime}} {{to adhere}} to each other smoothly. The pads need to deposit an even transfer layer. For street and urban driving with new pads and rotors {{it is best to}} treat them as a break in period as <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>a</b> new car for 200 to 300 miles after this period the manufactures bedding procedure can be followed. This is typically some number of stops from a certain max speed to a minimum speed. For example 10 moderate stops from 60 mph to 10mph in a safe controlled environment where no hazards are present. The goal is to get the brake pads and brake discs hot. During this time it is ideal to keep the brake pressure and stops consistent without engaging the Anti lock braking system or skidding the tires. There will likely be smells and a light amount of smoke. This is normal. Once the brakes begin to suffer from fade(braking effectiveness slightly reduced) the process is complete. Continue to drive at moderate speeds to cool the brake discs and rotors avoiding the use of the brakes unless needed for emergency situations. Also take note when coming to a complete stop until everything has cooled not to hold your foot on the brakes which could create an imprint.|$|E

[...] Johnson took the book to his lawyer and said, [...] "I must {{get out of the}} business, or prove that this book is wrong. [...] Here, Russell, is a retainer of five hundred dollars [...] I want you to read this book and give me your honest opinion on it, as you would on a legal question. Treat this retainer as <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>a</b> fee." [...] Johnson then sought out George in New York at the first possible opportunity, and the two became close friends and political collaborators. Johnson abandoned his business of rail monopoly and spent much of his fortune promoting the ideas of Henry George.|$|E
