500|$|The {{total number}} of {{vascular}} species is low by world standards, {{partly due to the}} effects of Pleistocene glaciations (which eliminated all or nearly all species) and the subsequent creation of the North Sea (which created a barrier to re-colonisation). Nonetheless, {{there are a variety of}} important species and assemblages. Heather moor containing Ling, Bell Heather, Cross-leaved Heath, Bog Myrtle and fescues is generally abundant and contains various smaller flowering species such as Cloudberry and Alpine Ladies-mantle. Cliffs and mountains host a diversity of [...] arctic and alpine plants including Alpine Pearlwort, Mossy Cyphal, Mountain Avens and Fir Clubmoss. On the Hebridean islands of the west coast, there are plantago pastures, which grow well in locations exposed to sea spray and include Red Fescue, Sea Plantain and Sea Pink. The machair landscapes include rare species such as Irish Lady's Tresses, <b>Yellow</b> <b>Rattle</b> and numerous orchids along with more common species such as Marram and Buttercup, Ragwort, Bird's-foot Trefoil and Ribwort Plantain. Scots Lovage, (Ligusticum scoticum) first recorded in 1684 by Robert Sibbald, and the Oyster Plant are common plants of the coasts.|$|E

[...] Beautifully drawn, but, as I have {{described}} it, vigorously erect, {{and with no}} decumbency whatever {{in any part of}} it.

But Gerarde, who calls the plant Red Rattle, (it having indeed much in common with the <b>Yellow</b> <b>Rattle),</b> says, [...] "It groweth in moist and moorish meadows; the herbe is not only unprofitable, but likewise hurtful, and an infirmity of the meadows." ...|$|E

And I {{find that}} the Monacha Rosea (Red Rattle is its name, besides [...] the ugly one) is a perennial, {{and several of the}} other draconidæ, [...] foxglove, etc., are biennials, born this year, {{flowering}} and dying next [...] year, and the size of roots is generally proportioned to the life of [...] plants; except when artificial cultivation develops the root specially, [...] as in turnips, etc. Several of the Draconidæ are parasites, and suck [...] the roots of other plants, and have only just enough of their own to [...] catch with. The <b>Yellow</b> <b>Rattle</b> is one; it clings to the roots of the [...] grasses and clovers, and no cultivation will make it thrive without [...] them. My authority for this last fact is Grant Allen; but I have [...] observed for myself that the <b>Yellow</b> <b>Rattle</b> has very small white [...] sucking roots, and no earth sticking to them. The toothworts and broom [...] rapes are Draconidæ, I think, and wholly parasites. Can it be that the [...] Red Rattle is the one member of the family that has 'proper pride, and [...] is self supporting'? the others are mendicant orders.

6000|$|In the genera Geranium, Polygonum, Veronica, {{and several}} others there is a {{gradation}} of forms from large and bright to small and obscure coloured flowers, and in every case the former are adapted for insect fertilisation, often exclusively, while in the latter self-fertilisation constantly occurs. In the <b>yellow</b> <b>rattle</b> (Rhinanthus Crista-galli) there are two forms (which have been named major and minor), the larger and more conspicuous adapted to insect fertilisation only, the smaller capable of self-fertilisation; and two similar forms exist in the eyebright (Euphrasia officinalis). In both these cases there are special modifications in the length and curvature of the style {{as well as in}} the size and shape of the corolla; and the two forms are evidently becoming each adapted to special conditions, since in some districts the one, in other districts the other is most abundant.[159] ...|$|E

Economy {{of time is}} very {{important}} both to the insects and the flowers, because the fine working days are comparatively few, and if no time is wasted the bees will get more honey, {{and in doing so}} will fertilise more flowers. Now, it has been ascertained by several observers that many insects, bees especially, keep to one kind of flower at a time, visiting hundreds of blossoms in succession, and passing over other species that may be mixed with them. They thus acquire quickness in going at once to the nectar, and the change of colour in the flower, or incipient withering when fertilised, enables them to avoid those flowers that have already had their honey exhausted. It is probably to assist the insects in keeping to one flower at a time, which is of vital importance to the perpetuation of the species, that the flowers which bloom intermingled at the same season are usually very distinct both in form and colour. In the sandy districts of Surrey, in the early spring, the copses are gay with three flowers--the primrose, the wood-anemone, and the lesser celandine, forming a beautiful contrast, {{while at the same time}} the purple and the white dead-nettles abound on hedge banks. A little later, in the same copses, we have the blue wild hyacinth (Scilla nutans), the red campion (Lychnis dioica), the pure white great starwort (Stellaria Holosteum), and the yellow dead-nettle (Lamium Galeobdolon), all distinct and well-contrasted flowers. In damp meadows in summer we have the ragged robin (Lychnis Floscuculi), the spotted orchis (O. maculata), and the <b>yellow</b> <b>rattle</b> (Rhinanthus Crista-galli); while in drier meadows we have cowslips, ox-eye daisies, and buttercups, all very distinct both in form and colour. So in cornfields we have the scarlet poppies, the purple corn-cockle, the yellow corn-marygold, and the blue cornflower; while on our moors the purple heath and the dwarf gorse make a gorgeous contrast. Thus the difference of colour which enables the insect to visit with rapidity and unerring aim a number of flowers of the same kind in succession, serves to adorn our meadows, banks, woods, and heaths with a charming variety of floral colour and form at each season of the year.[149] ...|$|E
