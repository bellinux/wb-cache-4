50|$|Sumukan Limited, a London-based dot-com start-up, {{sued the}} Commonwealth for expropriating the {{ownership}} of its e-commerce software. The British company said it was asked to demonstrate its software to an African government government of Namibia {{as part of a}} Commonwealth aid program. The company said it was told that if the government liked the product they would subsequently license it in a three-year deal. It signed a very short consulting agreement for the demonstration for £15,000. The parties fell out because the Secretariat changed internal staff and the new programme office, questioned his predecessor’s actions and refused to pay travel expenses and fees for the consulting. Approximately two years later, the Secretariat additionally began to claim ownership of the website developed by the company as well as the software toolkit which Sumukan had used to create its demonstration to the Namibian and South African governments. Sumukan’s barrister, Rhodri Thomspon QC of Matrix Chambers described the situation thus at the hearing of 20 February 2006: ‘Imagine that you have engaged a painter to paint your house. When he has finished painting your house, <b>you</b> <b>decide</b> <b>you</b> own his brushes and ladder’. Sumukan values its software toolkit as worth over several hundreds of thousands of pounds.|$|E

40|$|Last weekend China Beat contributors—and {{longtime}} Beijing neighbors—Susan Jakes and Leslie T. Chang {{caught up}} to talk about Chang’s newly released book,Factory Girls: From Village to City in a Changing China. The book, which builds on stories Chang wrote as {{a correspondent for the}} Wall Street Journal (and currently garnering glowing reviews and widespread coverage), follows the lives of young rural women making new lives for themselves in the southern Chinese city of Dongguan. Susan Jakes: How did <b>you</b> <b>decide</b> <b>you</b> wanted {{to write a book about}} migrant workers in China? What did you want to try to figure out? Was there a weakness in the existing reporting on this subject that you wanted to address? Leslie Chang: The book project began with a bit of an agenda. I had already read some stories in the foreign press, including the Wall Street Journal, about how terrible the conditions in the factories were. The stories tended to focus on the worst cases, the abuses, the miseries, the horrible bosses, the injuries. They tended to portray migration as a desperate act without much of a pay-off for people. I had a suspicion that there must be more to this, that perhaps things were not so black and white. I also thought that, for a young person coming from a farming village this whole experience in the city might appear very different than it does to us as Western observers. What is it like to leave your village at 16 or 17, to come to a city where you don’t know a single person or only one person, to work in a factory, to earn money for the first time? How does your relationship with your family change? How do your friendships change? How does your worldview change? I thought there must be more to the story. And with that suspicion in mind, I went down to Dongguan in February of 2004...|$|E
