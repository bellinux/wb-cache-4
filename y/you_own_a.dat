500|$|GamePro {{gave the}} Tetris & Dr. Mario {{compilation}} a rave review. They praised the Mixed Match mode and the SNES enhanced graphics and sounds, and concluded [...] "Sharp controls and absorbing action are what make these two classics even {{better as a}} pair than they were alone." [...] Next Generation, in contrast, said the compilation was only significant for being the first appearance of Tetris on the SNES, summarizing that [...] "Yeah, it's great, but chances are <b>you</b> <b>own</b> <b>a</b> copy of {{one or both of}} these games already." [...] They did, however, praise Nintendo for having the [...] "cajones" [...] to package their Tetris-inspired game with Tetris itself.|$|E
500|$|Kirk Hamilton of Kotaku {{praised the}} game, writing, [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>own</b> <b>a</b> PC, you {{owe it to}} {{yourself}} to play Gravity Bone." [...] He said the game was [...] "one of the coolest things I've played on PC lately." [...] Kieron Gillen from Rock Paper Shotgun considered Gravity Bone to be an intellectual mix of Hitman, , and Team Fortress 2, stating that it is the [...] "wittiest game" [...] he has played since World of Goo. Gillen applauded every aspect of the game, stating that Gravity Bone was an [...] "indie art game whose main effect is to delight you at every turn." [...] It received the [...] "Best Arthouse Game" [...] award in Game Tunnel's Special Awards of 2008.|$|E

The main country in which we won't invest today is Russia. There's still too much risk for foreign (or even local) investors that you'll think <b>you</b> <b>own</b> <b>an</b> asset and then Mr. Putin decides you don't".|$|R
2500|$|Sumner {{returned}} to the Senate in 1859. When fellow Republicans advised taking a less strident tone than he had years earlier, he answered: [...] "When crime and criminals are thrust before us, {{they are to be}} met by all the energies that God has given us by argument, scorn, sarcasm and denunciation." [...] He delivered his first speech following his return on June 4, 1860, during the 1860 presidential election. In [...] "The Barbarism of Slavery", he attacked attempts to depict slavery as a benevolent institution, said it had stifled economic development in the South and that it left slaveholders reliant on [...] "the bludgeon, the revolver, and the bowie-knife". He addressed an anticipated objection on the part of one of his colleagues: [...] "Say, sir, in your madness, that you own the sun, the stars, the moon; but do not say that <b>you</b> <b>own</b> <b>a</b> man, endowed with a soul that shall live immortal, when sun and moon and stars have passed away." [...] Even allies found his language too strong, one calling it [...] "harsh, vindictive, and slightly brutal". He spent the summer rallying the anti-slavery forces and opposing talk of compromise.|$|E
2500|$|LittleBigPlanet has {{received}} wide critical acclaim from reviewers. The first major publication to review LittleBigPlanet was the UK edition of PlayStation Official Magazine. In their November edition {{they gave the}} game a score of 10/10 calling it [...] "a beautifully elegant and powerful creative tool that puts unlimited potential {{in the palm of}} your hand". Eurogamer scored the game 9/10. Reviewer Oli Welsh commented specifically on the game's [...] "unforgettable visuals" [...] and that the accurate lighting was [...] "as total a realisation of high-definition as you'll see anywhere in games this year". He similarly praised the multiplayer gameplay as [...] "a loosely-structured scrum of competition, collaboration and sheer, joyful mucking around". Speaking of the game's comprehensive creation and community tools in contrast with its classic platforming gameplay, he calls the game [...] "the future and the past of videogames, rolled into one". IGN (U.S.) scored it 9.5/10 and said the game was an [...] "instant classic". The reviewer, Chris Roper, also suggested that the game may even be a reason to purchase a PlayStation 3; [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>own</b> <b>a</b> PlayStation 3, you cannot miss this. If you donâ€™t have a PS3 yet, this is the reason to get one." [...] GamePro scored the game 5/5 and said that the real strength of the game [...] "is the tremendous sense of freedom and creativity that it instils in you." ...|$|E

50|$|By the 1880s, iron mines were {{operating}} at Clove and the Catholic families needed their <b>own</b> church since <b>a</b> trip of eight miles to St. Denis was a challenge, even if <b>you</b> <b>owned</b> <b>a</b> horse and wagon {{and many of}} the miners did not. In 1883 Father McSwiggan purchased one half acre in Clove. The chapel, named Our Lady of Mercy and seating about fifty at most, was erected, likely by the miners themselves by 1884. The Clove chapel, with its small steeple intact, stood on Dutchess Route 9 about 3.7 miles north of Route 55. Our Lady of Mercy at Clove was still functioning in 1945 according to the parish calendar for that year, but closed shortly after World War II.|$|R
