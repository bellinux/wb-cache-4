25|$|Six and Out - If {{you hit it}} {{over the}} fence you're out and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the ball. The 6 runs are usually not awarded to the batsman unless agreed to by both teams. This rule is {{especially}} popular in small backyards (where the rule may be applied to any ball that lands over the fence - not just 6's), and encourages the batsman to exercise control and restraint by aiming for 4's instead of 6's. Six-and-out is also often extended to include nearby fragile objects such as windows and cars which are declared out-of-bounds; if a ball hits an out-of-bounds object on the full it is deemed six-and-out, even if no damage is evident.|$|E

Commenting on the difficult process of adapting his book into a screenplay, McBride stated, “As a novelist, you tend to think internally.

500|$|Although firmly {{established}} as the Astros' first baseman from Opening Day in 1991, Bagwell remarked {{years later that}} transitioning from third base was not automatic. [...] First basemen approach fielding plays from their right side, which is opposite to playing third base. [...] He recounted one conversation that occurred during an Astros pitching change {{in a game against}} St. Louis. [...] Shortstop Ozzie Smith was on first and asked Bagwell, [...] "How's it going?" [...] Bagwell responded, [...] "I'm really struggling with my backhand." [...] Smith replied, [...] "Well, here's what you do. [...] You can't field the ball deep.

[...] Minaj has also expressed appreciation for Cyndi Lauper's style and how her videos inspired her as a teenager: [...] "When I first went to get my hair colored, I was about 14 and I wanted blonde highlights. The beautician said, 'No, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> your mother on the phone,' and I was just crying and begging. I've always been experimenting.

When the band finished recording their second album A Rush of Blood to the Head, Martin said that the album was complete. However, after guitarist Jonny Buckland played the song on his guitar, Martin said that they now needed to record it and include it on the album. Martin also said that: [...] "That's about where you're put in the world, and how you're given your position, {{and the way you}} look, and how <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> on with it." [...] In {{an interview}}, Buckland revealed that the song was hard to record, as the band had played the song live. He also commented that when they started recording the song, they did not know how it should sound, due to the band members' contrasting ideas.|$|E

It also happens to be one of Konami’s best products!" [...] They added that [...] "With superb Roland sound (the TV show theme and opening animations are quite good) and smooth animation, our only wish is that Konami would consider releasing this fine arcade delight with full VGA support sometime in the future. If you like Bart and really enjoy arcade games, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> this one." [...] William Burrill of Toronto Star commented that [...] "the graphics in House of Weirdness are sharp and colorful, and look much like the television show. Music from the real show is also included, along with digitized samples of Bart's rather whining voice." [...] Computer Gaming World liked the graphics' resemblance to the TV show, and concluded that [...] "House of Weirdness stands up as well as any 'Super-Maroid' arcade game".|$|E

2500|$|Rock altered Metallica's {{familiar}} recording {{routine and}} the recording experience was so stressful that Rock briefly swore never {{to work with}} the band again. The tension between band and producer was documented in A Year and a Half in the Life of Metallica and Classic Albums: Metallica – Metallica, documentaries that explore the intense recording process that resulted in Metallica. Despite the controversies between the band and Rock, he continued to work with Metallica through the 2003 album St. Anger. After the production of St. Anger (2003), the fourth and final Metallica record Rock would produce, a petition signed by 1,500 fans was posted online in an attempt to encourage the band to prohibit Rock from producing Metallica albums, saying he had too much influence on the band's sound and musical direction.

[...] Dickson later recalled Nash's involvement during a 1977 interview: [...] "Graham Nash said that the songs were charming baby pictures. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a little older before you can tolerate seeing your baby pictures out there.

[...] The album was reportedly near completion in mid-2000 when producer Roy Thomas Baker convinced Rose to re-record the entire album, causing further delays. In 2004, bassist Tommy Stinson stated that the album was [...] "almost done" [...] and that it was held back by [...] "legal issues". Stinson also said delays were caused by Rose making sure every band member had a say in each song, mentioning that [...] "it's a lengthy process because <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> eight people to basically write a song together that everyone likes." [...] Stinson also stated Rose was a perfectionist and an engineer involved on the album claimed that [...] "Axl wanted to make the best record that had ever been made. It's an impossible task. You could go on infinitely, which is what they've done." [...] Geffen A Tom Zutaut stated the record [...] "could have been out by September 2002".|$|E
