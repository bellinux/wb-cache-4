500|$|Drake {{ended his}} studies at Cambridge nine months before graduation, and in autumn 1969 moved to London. His father remembered [...] "writing him long letters, {{pointing}} out the disadvantages of going away from Cambridge... a degree was a safety net, if <b>you</b> <b>manage</b> <b>to</b> get a degree, at least {{you have something to}} fall back on; his reply to that was that a safety net was the one thing he did not want." [...] Drake spent his first few months in the capital drifting from place to place, occasionally staying at his sister's Kensington flat, but usually sleeping on friends’ sofas and floors. Eventually, in an attempt to bring some stability and a telephone into Drake's life, Boyd organised and paid for a ground floor bedsit in Belsize Park, Camden.|$|E
2500|$|Anime News Network {{contributor}} Jacob Hope Chapman {{was critical}} of the show's production quality in his review of episodes 1–3, stating that, [...] "Berserk 2016 is an abominably ugly and almost forcefully unpleasant realization of our dreams, with cut-rate CGI, questionable music choices, and disorienting camera work." [...] However, to him {{the strength of the}} source work helps to carry the show, and Itagaki's frenetic directing style at least keeps the action interesting: [...] "Once <b>you</b> <b>manage</b> <b>to</b> unclench your teeth at all those garish cel-shaded puppet bodies smacking against each other, Miura's compelling story and captivating world still shine as one-of-a-kind flights of dark imagination with poignant characterization, even as they struggle under such a lackluster production." ...|$|E
2500|$|GameTrailers also {{reviewed}} it favorably, though {{slightly less}} so, {{giving it a}} 7.6/10, citing issues with the narrative structure, difficulty and minor gameplay bugs, but applauding the multiplayer modes. Eurogamer gave 7/10, stating [...] "All the same, you can't escape the feeling that Rockstar just isn't as good at a pure third-person shooter {{as it is with}} the open worlds of Grand Theft Auto or Red Dead Redemption, and in this linear context it's much harder to put up with its usual missteps in mechanics and difficulty." [...] Edge also gave 7/10, stating [...] "Max Payne 3 might solve the problem of how <b>you</b> <b>manage</b> <b>to</b> reload when carrying more than one gun, but detailing alone can't change {{the fact that this is}} a surprisingly conservative game from Rockstar".|$|E

6000|$|... "Have <b>you</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> get up {{football}} {{on board}} ship, Skinner?" [...] Easton, who was stretched at full length on the ground, asked lazily.|$|R
5000|$|If <b>you</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> {{conquer the}} maze in record time, Merlin would say [...] "Congratulations! You are a Master!" [...] and {{displays}} {{your time in}} the dungeon maze.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes." [...] She spoke slowly. [...] "I haven't much {{doubt that}} when I'm away <b>you</b> <b>manage</b> <b>to</b> {{find people who}} {{properly}} appreciate you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How do <b>you</b> <b>manage</b> <b>to</b> breathe here, sir, {{now that}} the stone slab is down and the door closed? I see not how you obtain air." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have often}} wondered, Archie," [...] {{returned}} his brother with a languid smile, [...] "what a lot <b>you</b> <b>manage</b> <b>to</b> say sometimes with nothing in it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So <b>you</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> get {{yourself}} captured yesterday," [...] Doctor Michaeloff said to Charlie. [...] "I {{have not had}} the pleasure of seeing many of you gentlemen here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know how}} <b>you</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> {{make up your}} mind to come to Redmond at all, if you are really such an {{undecided}} person," [...] said amused Priscilla.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, {{you find}} it so, Mr. Lestrade!" [...] cried Gregson, triumphantly. [...] "I thought you would come to that conclusion. Have <b>you</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> find the Secretary, Mr. Joseph Stangerson?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But how the devil, man, did <b>you</b> <b>manage</b> <b>to</b> get at her? I'm told Barry {{watches her}} like a dragon, ever since he read his father's will." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Can't <b>you</b> <b>manage</b> <b>to</b> {{lift your}} body off from my {{commanding}} officers?" [...] inquired Files. [...] "From their cries I'm afraid your great weight is crushing them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good for you!" [...] Cummings shouted joyfully. [...] "We'll have a {{first-class}} supper now, with plenty to spare for breakfast. How did <b>you</b> <b>manage</b> <b>to</b> get both?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And how {{did this}} one come into your possession?" [...] I asked, all breathless. [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> lay your hands on one, why not on all six of them?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{we ought}} to be able <b>to</b> <b>manage</b> her, between us!" [...] Bob said, confidently. [...] "Look how <b>you</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> have Dr. Burke for me, and you know how well that turned out." ...|$|R
6000|$|But the {{old woman}} looked at her steadily, and knew her again, and said: 'How have <b>you</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> grow so young and {{beautiful}}? I should like to be young and beautiful too.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No {{doubt he}} is," [...] replied Sam; [...] "but how will <b>you</b> <b>manage</b> <b>to</b> haul {{him up and}} prove {{that he has been}} {{swindling}} the old woman?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Say! You, who {{are up to}} {{fighting}} a man with your bare hands, could you--eh?--could <b>you</b> <b>manage</b> <b>to</b> stick one with {{a thing like that}} knife of mine?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, tell us {{all about}} your adventures, and how you got down here {{just in time to see}} our fellows enter, in triumph. I suppose <b>you</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> give them the slip, somehow?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course not," [...] {{she agreed}} softly. [...] "I really am sorry that I bothered you. There {{is one thing}} I should like to know, though {{and that is how}} <b>you</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> escape?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is not for}} us," [...] {{the girl}} was saying. [...] "I beg you to take it away; it couldn't get into the house, even if <b>you</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> {{get it out of}} the van." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But how, papa,' Hubert asked, 'will <b>you</b> <b>manage</b> <b>to</b> {{make your}} rockets go {{straight}} at the Indians? All the rockets I ever saw went straight up into the air.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Jesson," [...] he said, [...] "I'll {{be frank}} with you. Either the chief's gone off his nut, or <b>you</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> offend him somehow. I can't {{understand}} it a bit, I'll confess. I'm fairly staggered." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I don't {{understand}} now, how <b>you</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> reach Paris, my dear Blakeney!" [...] said Déroulède at last, placing {{an anxious}} {{hand on his}} friend's shoulder. [...] "The government has not forgotten The Scarlet Pimpernel." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The savage in you got {{the mastery}} just then; I've seen it, and have often {{wondered}} how <b>you</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> control it so well. Now it has had a holiday and made a hero of you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, young men, however did <b>you</b> <b>manage</b> <b>to</b> get here?" [...] {{one of the}} bargemen asked. [...] "It's {{lucky for}} you you weren't taken out to sea with the tide." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "The deuce you did!" [...] {{the colonel}} said. [...] "I wonder <b>you</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> get up with it, or that Colonel Kelly gave you leave. I {{certainly}} should not, myself, {{have dreamed of}} taking a civilian with me on such an expedition." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Excellent!" [...] {{the general}} said, glancing over the plan. [...] "This {{will give us}} exactly the {{information}} we want. We must set to with our counter-works at once.
