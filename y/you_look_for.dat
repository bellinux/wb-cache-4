500|$|Mustaine has {{elaborated}} on {{the subject}} matter of several of the album's other songs as well. He has noted that [...] "Forget to Remember" [...] was intentionally written in an ambiguous way so that it could interpreted as being about either a person trying to forget about a relationship or someone who suffers from Alzheimer's disease and has memory problems. He also compared the concept behind the song to the film The Notebook. [...] "The Blackest Crow" [...] has a Southern influence and features a slide guitar, while the lyrics are about loss and subsequent depression. Mustaine initially hoped to have a guest feature on the song, and reached out to country musicians Willie Nelson and Miranda Lambert; however, neither appeared on the song. [...] "Don't Turn Your Back..." [...] was inspired by a friend of Mustaine, who described him as [...] "the kind of guy that will steal your dope and then help <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> it." ...|$|E
500|$|Metacritic {{gave the}} season a Metascore—a {{weighted}} average {{based on the}} impressions of a select fifteen critical reviews—of 81, signifying [...] "universal acclaim". James Poniewozik of Time labeled the series {{as one of the}} six best dramas on television. He praised Bell as [...] "a captivating star," [...] and said that the series [...] "uses its pulp premise to dramatize a universal teen experience: that growing up means sleuthing out the mystery of who you really are." [...] Kay McFadden of The Seattle Times called Veronica Mars an update to the [...] "classic California film noir". She felt that Veronica Mars was the best new series on UPN, and that the title character was potentially [...] "this season's most interesting character creation". McFadden described the series as [...] "Alias in its attitude, Raymond Chandler in its writing and The O.C. in its class-consciousness." [...] James South of Paste praised the [...] "crisp, clever writing", and noted the supporting characters were more than just plot devices. He commended Bell's portrayal of Veronica as [...] "simultaneously smart, vulnerable, tough and injured", and found the guest stars were well-utilized. South wrote the remaining cast was [...] "uniformly good", but gave Dohring a special mention for his acting. Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com praised the first-season finale for being [...] "just the sort of satisfying capper <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> in a series that, week after week, keeps you asking questions".|$|E
500|$|An Argyle Hall of Famer {{returned}} to Home Park on 18 October 2009, when former England international Paul Mariner was appointed as the club's new head coach. [...] "In football, {{there is not}} much sentiment. But, if sentiment is involved in this scenario, then they gave me my very first chance as a player so I grabbed it with both hands," [...] said Mariner on the New England Revolution website, the club he left to rejoin Argyle. [...] "Plymouth Argyle are in my blood. Obviously the teams you're associated with are the ones <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> every week, and when they came knocking on my door asking me to be employed there, I was delighted." [...] His first match in the dugout alongside Sturrock ended in disappointment as Argyle lost 3–1 to Bristol City at Ashton Gate. They faced Ipswich Town, another side struggling for form, at home in their next match and a first-half goal from Fletcher put Argyle ahead, but their hopes of claiming three points were dented when the visitors equalised through striker Jon Stead, who capitalised on a poor back pass from Gary Sawyer. Welshman Darcy Blake, on loan from Cardiff City, was shown a straight red card late in the game as it ended all square. Their final game of October took place on Halloween against Middlesbrough, in Gordon Strachan's first game as their new manager. Argyle came away from the Riverside Stadium with all three points, in a game that saw Adam Johnson miss from the penalty spot, thanks to a second-half goal from Mackie to lift them to 22nd in the league table, within three points of Doncaster Rovers.|$|E

500|$|Tippett {{described}} himself as the receiver of inspiration rather than its originator, the creative spark coming from a particular personal experience, which might take one of many forms but was most often associated with listening to music. [...] The process of composing was lengthy and laborious, the actual writing down of the music being preceded by several stages of gestation; as Tippett put it, [...] "the concepts come first, and {{then a lot of}} work and imaginative processes until eventually, when you're ready, finally ready, <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> the actual notes". Tippett elaborated: [...] "I [...] compose by first developing an overall sense of the length of the work, then of how it will divide itself into sections or movements, then of the kind of texture or instruments or voices that will be performing it. I prefer not to consider the actual notes of the composition until this process... has gone as far as possible". Sometimes the time required to see a project through from conception to completion was very lengthy—seven years, Tippett says, {{in the case of the}} Third Symphony. [...] In the earlier, contemplative stages he might be simultaneously engaged on other works, but once these stages were complete he would dedicate himself entirely to the completion of the work in hand. Tippett preferred to compose in full score; once the writing began, progress was often not fluent, as evidenced by Tippett's first pencil draft manuscripts which show multiple rubbings-out and reworkings. In this, the musicologist Thomas Schuttenhelm says, his methods resembled those of Beethoven, with the difference that [...] "whereas Beethoven's struggle is considered a virtue of his work, and almost universally admired, Tippett's was the source and subject of a debate about his competency as a composer".|$|E
500|$|Although not a ratings success, {{the series}} was a {{critical}} success from its first season. Robert Abele of LA Weekly said [...] "in this smart, engaging series about a former popular girl turned crime-solving high school outcast, the hard-boiled dialogue comes from its teen protagonist's mouth {{in a way that}} stabs any potential cutesiness in the heart with an ice pick." [...] In her review, Paige Wiser of the Chicago Sun Times said that [...] "on Veronica Mars, wholesome is out; gritty reality is in. The show never soft-pedals the timeless, fundamental truth that high school is hell." [...] Joyce Millman of The Phoenix felt that {{the series was}} [...] "a character study masquerading as a high-school drama". Joy Press of The Village Voice saw the series as [...] "a sharp teen noir in the making. Tinged with class resentment and nostalgia for Veronica's lost innocence, this series pulses with promise." [...] Michael Abernethy of PopMatters said that [...] "intrigue, drama, and humor, Veronica Mars is also a lesson book for the disenfranchised. Few TV series aim so high; even fewer succeed so well." [...] James Poniewozik of Time labeled it as one of the six best dramas on television. He praised Bell as [...] "a captivating star", and said that the series [...] "uses its pulp premise to dramatize a universal teen experience: that growing up means sleuthing out the mystery of who you really are." [...] Kay McFadden of The Seattle Times called the series an update to the [...] "classic California film noir".

However, because of his great building projects, his account of Siduri's advice, and what the immortal man Utnapishtim told him about the Great Flood, Gilgamesh's fame survived his death. His story has been translated into many languages, and in recent years has featured in works of popular fiction.|$|E

The Broncos had acquired the pick in a trade with the Baltimore Ravens on the first night of the draft [...] for the Broncos' second, third and fourth round picks. Broncos head coach Josh McDaniels said about drafting Tebow, [...] "He has all the traits <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>for.</b> It's a good pick." [...] When asked how Tebow will be used, McDaniels commented that Tebow probably wouldn't start at quarterback as a rookie, and that he'll, [...] "Play when he's ready." [...] The Denver Post columnist Woody Paige praised the pick, saying [...] "Tim Tremendous may be high risk, but he will be a Mile High Reward." ...|$|E
