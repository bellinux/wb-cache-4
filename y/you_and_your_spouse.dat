6000|$|The king, when he {{the happy}} change had seen, Trusted {{the ear of}} Constance, his fair queen, With Lisa's {{innocent}} secret, and conferred How they should jointly, by their deed and word, Honor this maiden's love, which, like the prayer Of loyal hermits, never thought to share In what it gave. The queen had that chief grace Of womanhood, a heart that can embrace All goodness in another woman's form; And that same day, ere the sun lay too warm On southern terraces, a messenger Informed Bernardo that the royal pair Would straightway visit him, and celebrate Their gladness at his daughter's happier state, Which they were fain to see. Soon came the king On horseback, with his barons, heralding The advent of the queen in courtly state; And all, descending at the garden gate, Streamed with their feathers, velvet, and brocade, Through the pleached alleys, till they, pausing, made A lake of splendor 'mid the aloes gray; When, meekly facing all their proud array, The white-robed Lisa with her parents stood, As some white dove before the gorgeous brood Of dapple-breasted birds born by the Colchian flood. The king and queen, by gracious looks and speech, Encourage her, and thus their courtiers teach How, this fair morning, they may courtliest be, By making Lisa pass it happily. And soon the ladies and the barons all Draw her by turns, as at a festival Made for her sake, to easy, gay discourse, And compliment with looks and smiles enforce; A joyous hum is heard the gardens round; Soon there is Spanish dancing, and the sound Of minstrel's song, and autumn fruits are pluckt; Till mindfully {{the king and queen}} conduct Lisa apart to where a trellised shade Made pleasant resting. Then King Pedro said,-- [...] "Excellent maiden, that rich gift of love Your heart hath made us hath a worth above All royal treasures, nor is fitly met Save when the grateful memory of deep debt Lies still behind the outward honors done: And as a sign that no oblivion Shall overflood that faithful memory, We while we live your cavalier will be; Nor will we ever arm ourselves for fight, Whether for struggle dire, or brief delight Of warlike feigning, but we first will take The colors <b>you</b> ordain, <b>and</b> for <b>your</b> sake Charge the more bravely where your emblem is: Nor will we claim from you an added bliss To our sweet thoughts of you save one sole kiss. But there still rests the outward honor meet To mark <b>your</b> worthiness; <b>and</b> we entreat That you will turn your ear to proffered vows Of one who loves <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> would be <b>your</b> <b>spouse</b> We must not wrong yourself and Sicily By letting all your blooming years pass by Unmated: you will give the world its due From beauteous maiden, and become a matron true." ...|$|R

40|$|We use “I’ll be glad I did it ” {{reasoning}} all the time. For example, {{last night}} I {{was trying to}} decide whether to work on this paper or go out to a movie. I realized that if I worked on the paper, then today I would be glad I did it; if I went out to the movie, today I would regret it. This enabled me to see that I should work on the paper rather than going out to a movie. This looks like excellent reasoning: Paper argument: 1. If I work on my paper, I’ll be glad I did it. 2. Therefore, I should work on my paper. When we’re having trouble making a big life decision, we often try to picture what will happen each way we might choose, and imagine how we’ll feel in that outcome. Consider a very different case in which one might use this reasoning. Suppose <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>spouse</b> have just had a baby, Stevie, and Stevie turns out to be deaf.

40|$|In this article, I {{explore the}} {{processes}} whereby, {{at the turn}} of the twelfth century, European aristocrats acknowledged clerics'prohibitions of divorce and close-kin marriages. I argue that this normative shift cannot be ad-equately accounted for by the rise of feudalism, the Gregorian reformers' moralist offensive or the development of canon law: These events do not ex-plain (I) why the Roman hierarchy thought it possible, at a certain moment in time, to impose their normative preferences on reluctant elites; or (2) why aristocrats eventually yielded to demands that undermined their autonomy of choice regarding marriage. I address both problems by-considering two analytically distinct transformative processes. One concerns the symbolic and institutional conditions that allowed Roman prelates to substantiate their normative claims: The Church hierarchy emphasized the sacramental and spiritual significance of the marital tie and implemented reforms intended to preclude collusive practices between lords and bishops. The second process highlights how canonical rules of marriage were converted into effective nor-mative constraints: In a context marked by the patrimonialization of feudal relations and an increase in competition, aristocrats relied on ecclesiastical standards for their own regulatory and strategic interests. "I shall not come (to your marriage) until I know if a general council has found that <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>spouse</b> are legitimately divorced and that you and her you wish to marry may be legitimately married. "-Yvo, Bishop of Chartres, from a letter written in 1092 to King Robert (quoted by Duby 1983 : 9) "A feeling of sinfulness [...] . is incompatible with the feudal lord's sense of dignity.
