25|$|Often {{criticized for}} the lack of {{character}} in their music, Fahrenheit finally moved towards carving a more distinct musical style with their third album, Love <b>You</b> <b>More</b> & More (越來越愛 Yue Lai Yue Ai) which features a new maturity that is brought out by rock ballads like the main track, Lonesome Sprint (寂寞暴走 Ji Mo Bao Zou) and Stay With Me (留下來 Liu Xia Lai)， of which the latter was written by Monster, the lead guitarist of popular Taiwanese band, Mayday. The album also features Artery (動脈 Dong Mai), theme song of Mysterious Incredible Terminator (霹靂MIT), Shining Star (恒星 Heng Xing), theme song of Rolling Love (翻滾吧！蛋炒飯) and the ending song of drama ToGetHer (愛就宅一起) featuring Jiro and Rainie Yang, The Love of Silence (默默 Mo Mo). The album is completed by slower ballads that showcases the quartet's improved vocals and chemistry in harmonization.|$|E

25|$|By {{the timing}} of collection, VAT (as well as {{accounting}} in general) can be either accrual or cash based. Cash basis accounting is a very simple form of accounting. When a payment is received {{for the sale of}} goods or services, a deposit is made, and the revenue is recorded as of the date of the receipt of funds—no matter when the sale had been made. Cheques are written when funds are available to pay bills, and the expense is recorded as of the cheque date—regardless of when the expense had been incurred. The primary focus is on the amount of cash in the bank, and the secondary focus is on making sure all bills are paid. Little effort is made to match revenues to the time period in which they are earned, or to match expenses to the time period in which they are incurred. Accrual basis accounting matches revenues to the time period in which they are earned and matches expenses to the time period in which they are incurred. While it is more complex than cash basis accounting, it provides much more information about your business. The accrual basis allows you to track receivables (amounts due from customers on credit sales) and payables (amounts due to vendors on credit purchases). The accrual basis allows you to match revenues to the expenses incurred in earning them, giving <b>you</b> <b>more</b> meaningful financial reports.|$|E
500|$|On February 4, 2009, The Walt Disney Company {{dedicated}} {{a tribute}} plaque at Walt Disney World near the [...] "Mad Tea Party" [...] attraction with a quote by Randy that reads [...] "Be good at something; It makes you valuable ...

500|$|The duet aria, [...] "" [...] (May the Lord bless <b>you</b> <b>more</b> and more, you {{and your}} children), {{is based on a}} single line of text. The violins play an {{imitative}} motif that does not align with the vocal phrases. the movement has been described as calm and [...] "gently-swaying". Mincham notes a subtle growth [...] "in the imitative opening motives of the violins taken, incidentally, from the sinfonia and dominating this movement throughout".|$|E
50|$|The {{version in}} Godspell follows more closely the wording in Hymn 429 of the 1940 Hymnal: Day by day, Dear Lord, of thee three things I pray: To see <b>thee</b> <b>more</b> clearly, Love <b>thee</b> <b>more</b> dearly, Follow <b>thee</b> <b>more</b> nearly, Day by day.|$|R
5000|$|The {{prayer was}} adapted {{for the song}} [...] "Day by Day" [...] in the musical Godspell (1971), with music by Stephen Schwartz. The words used, with a few embellishments, {{were based on the}} {{following}} from [...] "Songs of Praise, Enlarged Edition":Day by day,Dear Lord, of thee three things I pray:To see <b>thee</b> <b>more</b> clearly,Love <b>thee</b> <b>more</b> dearly,Follow <b>thee</b> <b>more</b> nearly,Day by Day.|$|R

500|$|... "Down Town" [...] was, after [...] "All You Need Is Love", {{the second}} of The JAMs' three 1987 singles to become NME [...] "single of the week". [...] The British music paper called it [...] "One massive hell-hating holler of a song", and concluded: [...] " [...] {{may not be the}} hippest, sanest or sweetest band to stalk the Earth this year but they're {{certainly}} the most imaginative... hey've fired a musical trail so shocking they couldn't have kept <b>you</b> <b>more</b> on your toes if they'd stuffed a handgrenade up your ass and sent you out to tap dance in a pair of stilettos".|$|E
500|$|... "Adore You" [...] is a pop and R ballad, which {{lasts for}} four minutes and 38 seconds. The song {{performs}} in common time, at a tempo of 60 beats per minute. Played {{in the key}} of C major, the chord structure of C—Fmaj7—Am is followed throughout, and Cyrus's vocal range spans from G3 to A4. Its lyrics discuss [...] "power imbalance in love"; in the chorus, she states her affection towards her boyfriend through the lines [...] "When you say you need me / Know I need <b>you</b> <b>more</b> / Boy, I adore you", although Kyle Fowle of Slant Magazine felt that Cyrus' reliance in her partner is admittedly detrimental to her personal well-being as the song continues.|$|E
500|$|The filmmakers found {{independently}} {{producing the}} film to have both benefits and challenges. Although {{they were given a}} great amount of creative control by their executive producer Maurice Kanbar, their small budget kept them from making potentially beneficial changes to the story once production was underway. Todd Edwards related that [...] "Money doesn't just buy <b>you</b> <b>more</b> talent and more machinery, it also buys you flexibility on a story level. At Disney, if they don't like the third act, they just throw the whole thing out and re-animate the whole thing, even if it's finished... We had no such luxury, and so in a way, you're watching our first version of the movie." ...|$|E

500|$|The lyrics {{talk about}} {{substance}} abuse and the yearning for a long lost love more than drugs. [...] "Just one last puff and two last regrets/Three spirits and 12 lonely steps", Gaga sings, before uttering the hook, [...] "I need <b>you</b> <b>more</b> than dope". The lyrics meant that the singer wanted her lost love more than an addict pines for drugs. [...] "Dope" [...] {{is one of the}} most personal songs of Gaga, according to Joe Lynch from Fuse. With lines like [...] "I promise this drink is my last one / I know I fucked up again / Because I lost my only friend", Lynch believed that Gaga was referring to her former assistant Jennifer O'Neil who had months ago moved to court against the singer for unpaid wages.|$|E
500|$|Fear of Scientology's {{litigiousness}} rendered American networks {{unwilling to}} license any {{material to the}} filmmakers, which Gibney found [...] "astounding". He commented that he [...] "found it interesting that universally this subject — {{more than any other}} — provoked all the networks to decline to license. I {{think at the end of}} the day, that tells <b>you</b> <b>more</b> about Scientology than it does about the networks, which is how ruthless they've been in trying to silence any criticism." [...] The church's reputation for harassing its critics made it necessary for Gibney to use burner phones to contact interviewees and film in secret: [...] "Sometimes for the on-camera interviews we'd set up gear in somebody's house and I'd make sure I'd be there hours before. Then the person would show up there so it was like they were just going to somebody’s house." ...|$|E
500|$|The third track, [...] "Blue Jeans", was {{influenced}} by hip hop and has a minimalist beat that recalls songs by Timbaland. Del Rey also raps in a few verses of the song such as [...] "You're so fresh to death and sick as cancer [...] Love <b>you</b> <b>more</b> than those bitches before". [...] "Off to the Races" [...] has been lyrically described as [...] "a freak show of inappropriate co-dependency", with a chorus that recalls Sheryl Crow's [...] "down and out drunken loner persona" [...] in her 1994 single [...] "Leaving Las Vegas". Pryia Elan of NME noted the track [...] "almost falls {{under the weight of}} this persona. There's none of 'Video Games' measured, piano-led reflection. Instead the psychosexual rumblings of the lyrics and the dual voices she uses off set the comparatively simple musical shades on display." ...|$|E

500|$|As Travolta did {{not attend}} to collect his trophies, an action figure of Terl, his character, {{accepted}} them in his place. Travolta responded a week later to the awards: [...] "I didn't even know there were such awards. I have people around me {{whose job it is}} to not tell me about such things. They're obviously doing their job. Not every film can be a critical and box office success. It would have been awful only if Battlefield Earth was neither. That's not the case. It is edging toward the $100m mark which means it has found an audience even if it didn't impress critics. I'd rather my films connect with audiences than with critics because it gives <b>you</b> <b>more</b> longevity as a performer." [...] He later insisted that he still felt [...] "really good about it. Here I was taking big chances, breaking a new genre." ...|$|E
500|$|The result {{marked the}} first time that Liverpool had lost at the Millennium Stadium. Wenger used his post-match news {{interview}} to praise goalscorer Gilberto Silva and asserted that the Brazilian would be a [...] "very strong player" [...] for the team, in the incoming future. He noted that Dudek had [...] "kept [...] in the game for a long time" [...] and was critical of Gerrard, who he felt was fortunate not to have been sent off for a [...] "reckless and dangerous" [...] challenge on Vieira. Wenger believed Arsenal's experience put the team in good stead for the upcoming season: [...] "There are two attitudes to being champions. One is to get respect, another is to get kicked more and to face more aggression as people want to beat <b>you</b> <b>more.</b> We are quite used to that though as we have had some big fights in the past four or five years." ...|$|E
500|$|Mansfield's funeral {{took place}} on July 3 in Pen Argyl, Pennsylvania. The service was {{conducted}} by Charles Montgomery, a pastor of the Zion Methodist Church. A private funeral service {{was held at the}} chapel of the Pullis Funeral Home. Mickey Hargitay {{was the only one of}} her three ex-husbands who was present at the funeral. She was interred in Fairview Cemetery, southeast of Pen Argyl, beside her father Herbert Palmer. Her heart-shaped gravestone reads, [...] "We Live to Love <b>You</b> <b>More</b> Each Day". A cenotaph was placed in the Hollywood Forever Cemetery in Hollywood by the Jayne Mansfield Fan Club, but incorrectly cites her year of birth as 1938 (Mansfield tended to provide incorrect information about her age). In 1968, two wrongful-death lawsuits were filed on behalf of Jayne Marie Mansfield and Matt Cimber, the former for $4.8 million ($ in [...] dollars) and the latter for $2.7 million ($ in [...] dollars).|$|E

500|$|Many of Bach's later church cantatas were {{composed}} for {{the requirements of}} the liturgical calendar, but the early ones, including Der Herr denket an uns, were written for special occasions. The text is taken from , speaking of a thoughtful and blessing God. The passage includes in verse 14: [...] "The Lord shall increase <b>you</b> <b>more</b> and more, you and your children". Many commentators, from his biographer Philipp Spitta onwards, have concluded that the cantata was written for a wedding. They have proposed weddings where it might have been performed, including Bach's own in October 1707, when he married his first wife Maria Barbara in Dornheim. The Bach scholar Alfred Dürr and others suggest that the cantata may have been written for the wedding of the minister Johann Lorenz Stauber, who had conducted the wedding ceremony for Bach, and Regina Wedemann, an aunt of Maria Barbara, in Dornheim on 5 June 1708. However, the wedding hypothesis is not proven, and the general text could fit other occasions.|$|E
500|$|Showrunner Steven Moffat {{said that}} putting dinosaurs on a {{spaceship}} was [...] "the secret of success". The idea to use dinosaurs in Doctor Who {{came from the}} special effects teams The Mill and Millennium FX. As [...] "Asylum of the Daleks" [...] was a darker opening episode, [...] "Dinosaurs on a Spaceship" [...] is more about fun. In Moffat's pitch to writer Chris Chibnall, he proposed, [...] "Maybe it's a ship heading towards Earth, and Earth is on alert". Chibnall had previously written the Doctor Who episodes [...] "42" [...] (2007), [...] "The Hungry Earth"/"Cold Blood" [...] (2010), as well as work for the spinoff series Torchwood. The Doctor had previously encountered dinosaurs in the 1974 serial Invasion of the Dinosaurs. Moffat suggested the spaceship was Silurian, and Chibnall, who had written {{the return of the}} Silurians in [...] "The Hungry Earth"/"Cold Blood", felt that it was [...] "a nice reveal and shows <b>you</b> <b>more</b> about them, even in a story that isn’t really about them".|$|E
500|$|The World's Most Phallic Building contest was {{a contest}} held in 2003 by Cabinet {{magazine}} {{to find the}} building which most resembled a human phallus. The contest originated when writer Jonathan Ames drew the ire of Slate readers by claiming, in a diary that was later published in his book I Love <b>You</b> <b>More</b> Than You Know, that the Williamsburg Bank Building in Brooklyn, New York City, New York, was the world's most phallic. This led Cabinet magazine to initiate a search of its own to find which building was truly the [...] "world's most phallic". Cities and readers subsequently poured in their views and staked their claims to the magazine's editors. After months of entries and discussion, the Ypsilanti Water Tower was announced as the winner, [...] although the winner of a readers' poll was the Florida State Capitol building in Tallahassee. Another notable nominee was the Torre Agbar of Barcelona.|$|E
