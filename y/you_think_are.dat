And in effect you are chained down by your inability to say what you feel or go after what you want. No matter how in control <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>are</b> about sexuality in a relationship there is always the power struggle... always a certain amount of compromise. Of being beholden, if you love them. You do it because you choose to. No one put the chain around this neck but me. I wrote 'Express Yourself' to tell women around the world that pick and choose the best for yourself, before that chain around your neck, kills you instead. It's my take on how man can express what they want, the same prerogative should be there for a woman too." ...|$|E

500|$|Although Noel rejoined Oasis a {{few weeks}} later, the band's {{management}} and handlers were worried. With an album's worth of songs already demoed, the general feeling among the Gallaghers was that they should record as soon as possible. Their manager, Marcus Russell, said in 2007 that [...] "in retrospect, we went in the studio too quickly. The smart move {{would have been to}} take {{the rest of the year}} off. But at the time it seemed like the right thing to do. If you're a band and you've got a dozen songs <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>are</b> great, why not go and do it." [...] Morris expressed opposite sentiments, arguing that [...] "It was a mistake on everyone's part, management very much included, that we didn’t record Be Here Now in the summer of 1996. It would have been a much different album: happy probably." [...] He described the Mustique demos as [...] "the last good recordings I did with Noel" [...] and had a good rapport with Gallagher before Knebworth, regarding the concert as having changed things for the worse.|$|E

[...] His evil side comes to the forefront when his marriage to Deb crumbles. Dan experiences rivalry with his brother throughout the early seasons. His relationships with Karen and Deb are also major storylines in the series, and he tries to make amends for his wrongdoings despite his occasional impulse not to.|$|E
2500|$|In a 1998 address, author, activist, {{and civil}} rights leader Coretta Scott King stated that [...] "Homophobia is like racism and anti-Semitism {{and other forms of}} bigotry in that it seeks to dehumanize a large group of people, to deny their humanity, their dignity and personhood." [...] One study of white {{adolescent}} males conducted at the University of Cincinnati by Janet Baker has been used to argue that negative feelings towards gay people are also associated with other discriminatory behaviors. According to the study, hatred of gay people, anti-Semitism, and racism are [...] "likely companions." [...] Baker hypothesized [...] "maybe it's a matter of power and looking down on all <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>are</b> at the bottom." [...] A study performed in 2007 in the UK for the charity Stonewall reports that up to 90 percent of the population support anti-discrimination laws protecting gay and lesbian people.|$|E
2500|$|On October 17, 2008, Bachmann gave an {{interview}} on MSNBC's Hardball with Chris Matthews {{in support of the}} presidential campaign of Senator John McCain that brought the Minnesota 6th Congressional District race national attention. During the interview she criticized Barack Obama for his association with Jeremiah Wright and Bill Ayers, saying [...] "...usually we associate with people who have similar ideas to us, and it seems that it calls into question what Barack Obama's true beliefs, and values, and thoughts are... I am very concerned that he [...] may have anti-American views." [...] She noted the bombing campaign orchestrated by Bill Ayers before discussing his association with Barack Obama, arguing that [...] "Bill Ayers is not someone the average American wants to see their president have an association with." [...] Matthews followed up by asking [...] "But he [...] is a Senator from the State of Illinois; he's {{one of the members of}} Congress you suspect of being anti-American. How many people in the Congress of the United States do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>are</b> anti-American? You've already suspected Barack Obama, is he alone or are there others?" [...] Bachmann answered, [...] "What I would say is that the news media should do a penetrating exposé and take a look... I wish they would... I wish the American media would take a great look at the views of the people in Congress and find out are they pro-America, or anti-America. I think people would love to see an exposé like that." ...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{investigates the}} {{conflict}} between thought and speech that is inherent in lying. This is the conflict of saying what <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> false. The chapter shows how stubbornly saying what <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> false resists analysis. In traditional analyses of lying, saying what <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> false is analyzed in terms of saying something and believing that it is false. But standard cases of unconscious or divided belief challenge these analyses. Classic puzzles about belief from Gottlob Frege and Saul Kripke show that suggested amendments involving assent instead of belief do not fare better. I argue that attempts to save these analyses by appeal to guises or Fregean modes of presentation will also run into trouble. I then consider alternative approaches to untruthfulness that focus on (a) expectations for one’s act of saying/asserting and (b) the intentions involved in one’s act of saying/asserting. Here I introduce two new kinds of case, which I call “truth serum” and “liar serum” cases. Consideration of these cases reveals structural problems with intention- and expectation-based approaches as well. Taken together, the string of cases presented suggests that saying what <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> false, or being untruthful, is no less difficult and interesting a subject for analysis than lying itself. Tackling {{the question of what}} it is to say what <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> false illuminates ways in which the study of lying is intertwined with fundamental issues in the nature of intentional action...|$|R
