5|$|Because if we'd gone to Baghdad {{we would}} have been all alone. There wouldn't have been anybody else with us. There would have been a U.S. {{occupation}} of Iraq. None of the Arab forces that were willing to fight with us in Kuwait were willing to invade Iraq. Once <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> Iraq and took it over, took down Saddam Hussein's government, then {{what are you going to}} put in its place? That's a very volatile part of the world, and if you take down the central government of Iraq, you could very easily end up seeing pieces of Iraq fly off: part of it, the Syrians would like to have to the west, part of it—eastern Iraq—the Iranians would like to claim, they fought over it for eight years. In the north you've got the Kurds, and if the Kurds spin loose and join with the Kurds in Turkey, then you threaten the territorial integrity of Turkey. It's a quagmire if you go that far and try to take over Iraq. The other thing was casualties. Everyone was impressed with the fact we were able to do our job with as few casualties as we had. But for the 146 Americans killed in action, and for their families—it wasn't a cheap war. And the question for the president, in terms of whether or not we went on to Baghdad, took additional casualties in an effort to get Saddam Hussein, was how many additional dead Americans is Saddam worth? Our judgment was, not very many, and I think we got it right.|$|E

500|$|A {{southern}} rock album, Move is {{also influenced}} by gospel music.

[...] "Make Your Move", which depicts evangelism {{from the perspective of a}} non-believer, has a grunge-influenced half time chorus.

[...] "Gone", which features vocals from Bear Rinehart of Needtobreathe, has an acoustic rock sound.

500|$|Dubbed an [...] "iconoclast" [...] by Boxoffice, Belle {{continues}} to garner media recognition {{for her role}} in Beauty and the Beast. Established as a cultural icon, the character maintains the distinction of being Disney's first feminist princess. Commentators believe that the character's role in Beauty and the Beast as one of Disney's first strong female characters is responsible for changing the way in which women would be depicted in subsequent animated films. According to Kevin Fallon of The Daily Beast, [...] "being a Disney princess meant singing songs about how much you love combing your hair with a fork and giving away your voice if it meant <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> marry the guy with that dreamy chiseled jaw" [...] prior to Belle's arrival. The Los Angeles Times Charles Solomon ranked Belle among the four Disney Princesses responsible for breaking [...] "the bonds of convention." [...] About.com's David Nusair agreed that Belle successfully [...] "updated the princess formula for an entirely new generation." [...] The Atlantics Lindsay Lowe echoed Nusair's sentiment, citing Belle as the character responsible for ending Disney's [...] "history of ... docile heroines." [...] The Daily Campus Cathy Schmidt recognized Belle and Ariel as [...] "the beginnings of the more modern Disney princesses." [...] Writing for Virgin Media, Limara Salt believes that the character [...] "proved that audiences could {{fall in love with a}} brown-haired intellectual." [...] A survey conducted by Disney after the film's release determined that Belle's love of books inspired young women to read. Justin Humphreys of The Hook expressed, [...] "Belle remains a most successful princess because people can relate" [...] to her. Elina Bolokhova of Parenting believes that Belle's [...] "bravery and independence helped redefine the meaning of a Disney princess." [...] According to Justine McGrath of Teen Vogue, Belle has [...] "become one of the most popular classic Disney princesses of all time." [...] Commending her intelligence and lack of vanity, the character was placed at number one on E!'s ranking of the Disney Princesses, while Cosmopolitan ranked her fourth. In the magazine's [...] "Definitive Ranking Of Disney Princesses", Seventeen ranked Belle fifth. Similarly, BuzzFeed also ranked the character fifth, praising her love of reading. A reader poll conducted by BuzzFeed also determined that Belle is the most popular Disney Princess, having garnered 18% of votes. Belle is the fifth most successful Disney Princess in terms of box office revenue, with Beauty and the Beast having grossed over $350 million. However, Belle was the lowest-selling Disney Princess on eBay in 2013, with sales of less than $7,000 despite the fact that she is often cited as a customer favorite.|$|E
