6000|$|... "Come in, come in," [...] the Prussians answered. [...] "We are all {{friends for}} tonight, for {{we are all}} in equally bad plight. Can <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>how</b> matters have gone, up there?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Will <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>how</b> it all happened?" [...] asked Sam, {{and then}} he added aside to Songbird. [...] "Don't say {{anything}} about Tom." [...] And the would-be poet of Brill nodded to show he understood.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well, then, Anne spelled with an E, can <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>how</b> this mistake {{came to be}} made? We {{sent word}} to Mrs. Spencer to bring us a boy. Were there no boys at the asylum?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Will <b>you</b> kindly <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> came here?" [...] {{continued}} the fat little man. [...] "You must excuse my curiosity, but I cannot remember ever having seen any real children before." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is {{the luncheon}} bugle. After we have done, <b>you</b> may <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> and Ryan {{got out of}} the hands of the French, for I suppose you were not exchanged." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes,' said Guy, not in {{the least}} {{conscious}} of the impression his words made on the others. 'By the bye, Philip, I wish <b>you</b> would <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> fared after we parted, and how you came here.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Travers {{was telling}} us the day after you left what a curious {{coincidence}} {{it was that the}} nun who threw him out a letter should {{turn out to be a}} cousin of yours. Will <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>how</b> you managed it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{will come}} and see him to-morrow. Can't <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>how</b> he manages to subdue these wild animals? I {{always wanted to know}} about it," [...] said Rose, {{wondering}} if she could not get some hints for the taming of men.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, your honour, will <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>how</b> you {{got away}} from the Protestant rebels, and how was it they didn't make short work of you, when they caught you? It's a puzzle to us entirely, for the Enniskilleners spare neither man, woman, nor child." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I {{beg your}} pardon, I {{hope you will}} forgive the liberty that we—perfect strangers in the neighbourhood—are taking, but my friend here and myself {{would be so much}} obliged if <b>you</b> would <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> caught that trout up there.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, well," [...] {{interrupted}} Cap; [...] "now {{this latter}} matter is settled {{to the satisfaction}} of all parties, perhaps <b>you</b> will <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>how</b> it happened to be known that there were spies near us so lately. This looks amazingly like a circumstance." ...|$|R
60|$|THE MAIDEN. But wait a moment. Why will <b>you</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> enjoy yourself? You {{must have}} secret pleasures that you hide from us, {{and that you}} never get tired of. I get tired of all our dances and all our tunes. I get tired of all my partners.|$|R
6000|$|... "You must {{maintain}} excellent discipline, Josh," [...] cried Rose, {{in one of}} the sweetest voices in the world, which was easily attuned to merriment--"and we are delighted to learn what <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us.</b> <b>How</b> do you manage to keep up these distinctions, and make such creatures know their places so well?" ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{handed me}} back the empty cup. [...] "I believe, sir, you have saved my life," [...] he said. [...] "Under Providence," [...] I put in--adding, [...] "But I would remark, {{looking to the}} state of your clothes, that I have yet another service to offer you, before <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>how</b> you came into this pitiable state." [...] With that reply, I led him upstairs, and set before him the poor {{resources}} of my wardrobe, and left him to do the best he could with them. He was rather a small man, and I am in stature nigh on six feet. When he came down to us in my clothes, we had the merriest evening that I can remember for years past. I thought Felicia would have had a hysteric fit; and even sister Judith laughed--he did look such a comical figure in the minister's garments.|$|E

And these differences occur even within ethnic groups? What kinds of factors affect individuals from racially and ethnically diverse backgrounds in the classroom? I'd like to turn for a moment to the issue of stereotyping. No one is entirely free of the impulse, of course, but teachers, it seems, have to be especially vigilant. How do stereotypes influence teacher expectations?...|$|E

Questions asked Leonard Baca in this audio: Professor Baca, can <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>how</b> you became involved in studying culturally and linguistically diverse exceptional learners? Will you talk a bit about the reason behind classroom teachers' using their students' native languages and connecting those students' culture to the curriculum?

50|$|Prime Minister Harold Wilson recast the {{alliance}} as a 'close relationship', but {{neither he nor}} President Lyndon B. Johnson had any direct experience of foreign policy, and Wilson's attempt to mediate in Vietnam, where the United Kingdom was co-chairman with the Soviet Union of the Geneva Conference, was unwelcome to the president. 'I won't <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> how to run Malaysia and <b>you</b> don’t <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>how</b> to run Vietnam,' Johnson snapped in 1965. However relations were sustained by US recognition that Wilson was being criticised at home by his neutralist Labour left for not condemning American involvement in the war.|$|R
