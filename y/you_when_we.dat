[...] He followed that up at 10:49 by reporting that, [...] "We have a report now that a large plane crashed this morning, north of the Somerset County Airport, which is in western Pennsylvania, not too terribly far from Pittsburgh, about 80 miles or so, a Boeing 767 jet. Don't know whose airline it was, whose airplane it was, and we don't have any details beyond that which I have just given you." [...] In the confusion, he also erroneously reported a second hijacked plane heading for the Pentagon after the crash of the first.|$|E
2500|$|Buchanan {{explained}} the song's concept and lyrical interpretation during a track by track {{analysis of the}} album on the group's official website, saying: [...] "This song is about reacting to the press when they slag you off, about how they judge <b>you.</b> <b>When</b> <b>we</b> heard the song we loved it. To be honest, any publicity is good publicity whether it's positive or negative, and it's taken us {{a while to get}} that. When the press write something negative and something that's untrue, it's hard to look at that in a positive way. We could really relate to the song." ...|$|E

When it comes to taxes we’ll prioritise not the wealthy but you." ...|$|E
5000|$|Since that time, the mizpah {{has come}} to connote an {{emotional}} bond between people who are separated (either physically or by death). Mizpah jewelry is often made {{in the form of}} a coin-shaped pendant cut in two with a zig-zag line bearing the words [...] "The LORD watch between me and <b>thee,</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> are absent one from another" [...] (Genesis 31:49).

[...] --Wordsworth.|$|R
2500|$|After {{she became}} Prime Minister, May's cabinet {{appointments}} tilted to the right, according to The Guardian; but her speech clearly targeted the left, {{with a promise}} to combat the [...] "burning injustice" [...] in British society and create a union [...] "between all of our citizens" [...] and promising to be an advocate for the [...] "ordinary working-class family" [...] {{and not for the}} affluent in the UK.

2500|$|Due {{to their}} low social status and {{language}} barrier, Korean Americans received very {{little if any}} aid or protection from police authorities. David Joo, a manager of the gun store, said, [...] "I {{want to make it}} clear that we didn't open fire first. At that time, four police cars were there. Somebody started to shoot at us. The LAPD ran away in half a second. I never saw such a fast escape. I was pretty disappointed." [...] Carl Rhyu, a participant in the Korean immigrants' armed response to the rioting, said, [...] "If it was your own business and your own property, would you be willing to trust it to someone else? We are glad the National Guard is here. They're good backup. But when our shops were burning we called the police every five minutes; no response." [...] At a shopping center several miles north of Koreatown, Jay Rhee, who estimated that he and others fired five hundred shots into the ground and air, said, [...] "We have lost our faith in the police. Where were <b>you</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> needed you?" [...] Koreatown was isolated from South Central Los Angeles, yet despite such exclusion it was the heaviest hit.|$|E

6000|$|... 'We {{are going}} inside for a minute,' said Manston to him, taking the keys unceremoniously. 'I {{will bring them}} to <b>you</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> return.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Aid us!" [...] exclaimed Gunrig in contempt. [...] "Surely we need no {{aid from}} <b>you,</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> have the king's head-huntsman as our guide." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, {{the second}} Sunday I knew <b>you,</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> {{drove out to}} Moraga Valley behind Prince and King. You spread the lunch that day." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "How can I go {{away with}} <b>you,</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> are losing by the farm, {{and when there}} is nobody to check the ruinous {{expenses}} but myself?" ...|$|E
60|$|GUNNER. Yes. Youre right. [Conceitedly] I'm a problem. And I tell <b>you</b> that <b>when</b> <b>we</b> clerks {{realize that}} we're problems! well, look out: thats all.|$|R

Set its poor gates ajar, I pray, and bethink <b>thee.</b> <b>When</b> <b>we</b> appear among men, scattering gold to satisfy their want, clad in terrifying power, in dazzling beauty and in immortality of days, will they not cry, 'Be ye our monarchs and rule over us!'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You silly man," [...] she answered. [...] "Do <b>you</b> suppose, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> {{can have}} only a few days together, that I want to waste time in theatres?" ...|$|R
60|$|STREPHON. You are maturing, as {{you call}} it--I call it ageing--from minute to minute. You are going much further than <b>you</b> did <b>when</b> <b>we</b> began this conversation.|$|R
