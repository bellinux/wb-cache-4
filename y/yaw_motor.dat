40|$|The paper {{deals with}} robust output control {{algorithm}} for multivariable plants under disturbances.

50|$|Multi-channel {{developments}} were {{of particular}} use to aircraft which really needed {{a minimum of}} three control dimensions (<b>yaw,</b> pitch and <b>motor</b> speed), as opposed to boats which can be controlled with two or one. Radio control 'channels' were originally outputs from a reed array, in other words, a simple on-off switch. To provide a usable control signal a control surface needs to be moved in two directions, so at least two 'channels' would be needed unless a complex mechanical link could be made to provide two-directional movement from a single switch. Several of these complex links were marketed during the 1960s, including the Graupner Kinematic Orbit, Bramco, and Kraft simultaneous reed sets.|$|R

50|$|In {{the case}} of Optiwind (now defunct), {{there appears to be}} a growing body of {{evidence}} that they believe have solved for both the acceleration and economic challenges posed by CWAT/DAWT designs. Where previous attempts at new designs in this category have focused purely on acceleration magnitude, Optiwind appears to have taken a more holistic approach to their design, considering cost as much as acceleration benefit. In addition, the ongoing operational and maintenance cost of the entire unit appears to be successfully addressed in this design. It is absent the significant cost drivers of HAWT systems - large composite blades, gearbox, <b>yaw</b> <b>motor,</b> pitch control, lubrication, etc. In addition, the novel foundation geometry appears to have mitigated the structural challenges of the conventional monopole foundation design, which was originally conceived to offset the counter-rotational effects ("wobbling") of large, three blade turbines. As such, it is reasonable to assume that Optiwind's holistic approach to systemwide costs have led to a series of designs and discoveries that can realistically deliver the economic advantages of accelerated wind at a cost that is less than the net system cost. This is accurate if the Optiwind system is compared to a HAWT purely on rating. The problem therein is, if one compares the Optiwind design based on its stack height (the distance from its lowest turbine to the highest turbine) to a traditional HAWT of the same diameter, the overall power output of the machine is 20% less than that of the HAWT, with all the attendant material and structural expenses generally associated with a CWAT/DAWT. On average a CWAT/DAWT system would need to produce at least 2-3 times the energy a HAWT could produce from the maximum area used by the CWAT/DAWT in order to offset the substantially larger material costs. There is no evidence yet that there are any DAWT/CWAT designs capable of this level of increase when compared on an apples to apples basis with HAWT's.|$|E

40|$|A {{control system}} has been {{designed}} to keep a balloon-borne scientific instrument pointed toward a celestial object within an angular error of the order of an arc second. The design is intended to be adaptable to a large range of instrument payloads. The initial payload to which the design nominally applies {{is considered to be a}} telescope, modeled as a simple thin-walled cylinder 24 ft (approx. = 7. 3 m) long, 3 ft (approx. = 0. 91 m) in diameter, weighing 1, 500 lb (having a mass of. 680 kg). The instrument would be mounted on a set of motor-driven gimbals in pitch-yaw configuration. The motors on the gimbals would apply the control torques needed for fine adjustments of the instrument in pitch and yaw. The pitch-yaw mount would, in turn, be suspended from a motor mount at the lower end of a pair of cables hanging down from the balloon (see figure). The motor in this mount would be used to effect coarse azimuth control of the pitch-yaw mount. A notable innovation incorporated in the design is a provision for keeping the gimbal bearings in constant motion. This innovation would eliminate the deleterious effects of static friction. something that must be done in order to achieve the desired arc-second precision. Another notable innovation is the use of linear accelerometers to provide feedback that would facilitate the early detection and counteraction of disturbance torques before they could integrate into significant angular-velocity and angular-position errors. The control software processing the sensor data would be capable of distinguishing between translational and rotational accelerations. The output of the accelerometers is combined with that of angular position and angular-velocity sensors into a proportional + integral + derivative + acceleration control law for the pitch and <b>yaw</b> torque <b>motors.</b> Preliminary calculations have shown that with appropriate gains, the power demand of the control system would be low enough to be satisfiable by means of storage batteries charged by solar batteries during the day...|$|R

40|$|Wind {{turbines}} {{have many}} parts that generate noise {{but they can}} be broadly classifi ed as either aerodynamic or mechani-cal. Mechanical sources of noise include the gearbox, cooling fans, the generator, the power converter, hydraulic pumps, the <b>yaw</b> <b>motor</b> and bearings. Modern turbines incorporate many mechanical noise-reducing features such as nacelle in-sulation, gearbox isolation, and silenced ventilation. Aerody-namic noise sources are a function of blade geometry (refer to Figure 1). Similar to a fan, the level of aerodynamic noise is highly correlated with the tip speed. Reducing aerodynam-ic noise is subject of current research [3]. Modern turbines often have the ability to control their noise emissions through a combination of reduced rotor (and tip) speed and blade pitch angle adjustment. This typically comes at the cost of a reduced electrical power output. Typical sound power values for commercial scale wind turbines are in the range of 96 - 108 dB(A), LWA between cut-in and rated power...|$|E

40|$|The {{application}} of conventional wind turbines {{on board a}} vessel creates {{a number of new}} challenges for turbine control systems. Thrust force is used in marine applications as an additional control variable for propulsion of the vessel. Variability of the wind speed and wind direction, together with the yaw rate and range constraints, impose strong requirements on the turbine control system. A new projection algorithm that projects the turbine thrust force on the heading direction of vessel is proposed in this paper for controlling propulsion. Variations in the wind direction and wind speed are counteracted via turbine yaw angle, making the turbine thrust force always aligned with the heading direction of the vessel. The conventional Kv 2 speed controller is modified for varying yaw offset and a combined algorithm for simultaneous control of the turbine speed and thrust force is proposed. Stability of the Kw^ 2 speed controller for varying yaw offset is proved via the Lyapunov method. The controller also takes into account the constraints on the yaw rate and minimizes the turbine gyroscopic effects via a proper choice of the virtual upper bound of the input voltage of the <b>yaw</b> <b>motor.</b> All of the results are illustrated by simulations using measurement data acquired from the Hönö turbine...|$|E
