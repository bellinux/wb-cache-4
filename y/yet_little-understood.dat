Their importance and the extent of their disappearance and damage were meaningfully identified only 30 years ago with the publication of the paper that called for and resulted in a flurry of follow-up studies. In their seminal 1984 Ciénegas - Vanishing Climax Communities of the American Southwest, ichthyologists Dean A. Hendrickson and W. L. Minckley focused on ciénagas in southeast Arizona and, for the first time, gave them prominence on the scholarly radar:We hypothesize the ciénaga to be an aquatic climax community …that act as traps for organic materials and nutrients in the aquatic ecosystem, and must be remarkably productive…In light of their continuing disappearance, cultural histories, and importance to aquatic faunas and floras, these dwindling, valuable, as <b>yet</b> <b>little-understood</b> ecosystems constitute a resource which merits further investigation…The technology that would be used to answer this call and the history it would uncover could have hardly been imagined. Hendrickson and Minckley's appeal for further study prompted a string of increasingly complex investigations. Diverse and ongoing scholarship is looking into ciénagas and associated landscape questions, not just changes in habitat composition and structure brought on by European arrival, but answers to the questions of growth rates, as well as when and how ciénagas, and in turn the Southwest, developed. Scientists are in the process of understanding their history, vegetation composition, the implications of climate change, and, importantly, the means and potential for restoration, conservation and management. They are slowly uncovering the evolution of these unique, one-of-a-kind, aridland, fresh water habitats.|$|E

While many changes have been observed in Jupiter's visual appearance, few, yet significant, changes have been detected in the principal atmospheric currents. Jupiter's ring system is strongly forward scattering at visual wavelengths and consists of a narrow annulus of highest particle density, within which is a broader region in which the density is lower. On Io, changes are observed in eruptive activity, plume structure, and surface albedo patterns. Europa's surface retains little or no record of intense meteorite bombardment, but does reveal a complex and, as <b>yet,</b> <b>little-understood</b> system of overlapping bright and dark linear features.

Although the upstream–downstream patterns of α diversity of stream fishes are numerously reported, β diversity has received less attention. In this study, we surveyed fishes along the upstream–downstream gradients in three headwater streams of the Qingyi River, China, which were affected by different extents of human activities. We aimed to assess how anthropogenic disturbances affect α and β diversity of stream fishes and their upstream–downstream patterns. We found that, compared with that in the Shuxi Stream disturbed less, endemic species decreased and cosmopolitan species increased in the Maxi and Puxi Stream disturbed heavily. The streams disturbed heavily showed lower α diversity and higher β diversity than that in the stream disturbed less. This among-stream variations in fish diversity only occurred at the mid-downstream, not upstream segments. α diversity increased downstream and β diversity decreased downstream from headwaters to mouth in the stream disturbed less, whereas this upstream–downstream pattern in fish diversity shifted in the streams disturbed heavily, in which both α and β diversity showed the quadratic distributions with the hump-shape for α diversity and the U-shape for β diversity respectively. Our results suggest that anthropogenic disturbances cause some cosmopolitan fishes replacing many endemic fishes in upland streams. This replacement processes result in α diversity decreasing and β diversity increasing, and shift the spatial patterns in fish diversity along the upstream–downstream gradient. No Full Tex...|$|E

We utilize the storytelling research method {{to obtain a}} nuanced understanding of this <b>little-understood,</b> <b>yet</b> important phenomenon. Our data was collected through in-depth narrative interviews with 32 Chinese managers (both senior and middle) with three to eight years of professional experience in African countries from 21 Chinese firms (both state-owned and privately owned). We found that Chinese managers’ crossvergence HRM practices are a blend of divergent local contextual factors and convergent cultural factors. Our findings reveal that the cultural proximity between African “Ubuntu” and Chinese Confucianism can significantly influence Chinese firm-local union inter-organizational relationship in managing African employees of Chinese firms. The crossvergence of Chinese managers’ HRM practices can gradually affect the work behaviors of African employees over time. The paper identifies importance of the cross-cultural training and mutual learning between Chinese managers and African employees to enhance mutual understanding {{against the backdrop of}} Chinese firms entering Africa countries. Our study contributes to the better understanding of HRM practices of emerging market multinational corporations, and has important practical implications for managing African employees...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMinimizing the {{clearance}} between turbofan blades and the surrounding casing is a key factor to achieving compressor efficiency. The deposition of an abradable coating on casings {{is one of the}} technologies used to reduce this blade-casing clearance and ensure blade integrity in the event of blade-casing contact. Aircraft in-service condi-tions may lead to interactions between the blade tip and the coated casing, during which wear of the abradable coating, blade dynamics and interacting force are critical <b>yet</b> <b>little-understood</b> issues. In order to study blade/abradable-coating interactions of a few tens of milliseconds, experiments were conducted on a dedicated test rig. The experi-mental data were analyzed with the aim of determining the friction-induced vibrational modes of the blade. This involved a time-frequency analysis of the experimental blade strain using the Continuous Wavelet Transform, combined with a modal analysis of the blade. The latter was carried out with two kinds of kinematic boundary conditions at the blade tip: free and modified, by imposing contact with the abradable coating. The interaction data show that the blade vibration modes identified during interactions cor-respond to the free boundary condition, due to the transitional nature of the phenomena and the very short duration of contacts. The properties of the Continous Wavelet Trans-form were then used to identify the occurence of blade-coating contact. Two kinds of blade/abradable-coating interactions were identified: bouncing of the blade over short time periods associated with loss of abradable material, and isolated contacts capable of amplifying the blade vibrations without causing significant wear of the abradable coat-ing. The results obtained were corroborated by high-speed imaging of the interactions...|$|E
40|$|There is {{a growing}} body of {{evidence}} for the origin of cratonic mantle eclogite xenoliths by low-pressure formation in now-recycled ocean floors. Because they have protoliths ultimately derived from the convecting mantle, their study can potentially yield unprecedented insights into as <b>yet</b> <b>little-understood</b> palaeo-geodynamic regimes, once primary (fractional crystallisation, accumulation, mixing) and secondary processes (kimberlite infiltration, metasomatism) affecting their compositions are understood. This is achieved using diagnostic concentrations or ratios of the analytically and geologically most robust elements (major and minor elements, transition metals, REE), and aided by comparison to natural and modelled analogues. Here, mineral compositions taken from the literature were used to reconstruct bulk rocks and assign the samples to eclogites (further divided into high-Mg, low-Mg and high-Ca types), pyroxenites and their gabbroic (Eu* > 1. 05) counterparts. Various protolith types - formed predominantly by < 1 GPa crystallisation from broadly picritic magmas leaving garnet-poor mantle sources - are identified: (1) Many high-Mg eclogites lie on modelled crystallisation trends between 0. 5 and < 1 GPa. Some have elevated FeO contents with lower SiO₂ and CaO possibly requiring Fe-rich pyroxenite heterogeneities in their mantle source. (2) Many high-Ca eclogites may be the differentiated (higher Na₂O, TiO₂ and FeO at lower MgO) equivalents of high-Mg eclogites, following modelled crystallisation trends at somewhat lower pressure (0. 05 to 0. 5 GPa). Other high-Ca eclogites with low FeO were produced during interaction with fluids and melts in mélange-type settings. (3) Low-Mg eclogites, with intermediate MgO content, are too FeO-rich to be intermediary crystallisation products of the same parental melt and are ascribed to melting out of Fe-rich lithologies possibly related to recycling of eclogite and/or contamination with ferromanganese sediments. (4) The positive Eu anomalies in gabbroic eclogites require accumulation of substantial amounts of plagioclase, consistent with their low FeO and TiO₂ contents, but their simultaneously low MgO contents suggest that they interacted with residual melts. (5) The elevated CaO and low Al₂O₃ in pyroxenite may indicate clinopyroxene-rich high- or low-pressure cumulate protoliths, but high Cr₂O₃ and MgO, combined with low HREE and high LREE in many of these samples, suggests formation by hybridisation of eclogite-derived melt with peridotite. 20 page(s...|$|E
40|$|The {{mammalian}} {{small intestine}} {{is a major}} site (second in total activity only to the liver) for the synthesis and secretion of plasma apolipoproteins, and contributes significantly to overall whole-body lipid dynamics. A prominent feature of the small intestine is its exposure to periodic loads of meals often containing dramatically varying amounts or types of food components, including lipids such as tri-acylglycerols, cholesterol and cholesteryl esters. Since the trans-epithelial transport of most of these latter materials requires the elaboration of particles partially covered by apolipoproteins, the regulation of the biosynthesis or, more correctly, the availability of these proteins is an important and as <b>yet</b> <b>little-understood</b> problem. Previous {{studies have been conducted}} on systems which, for one or the other reason, have not permitted the following questions to be satisfactorily or coherently answered: Does the ingestion of fat-containing meals, either acutely or chronically, increase the rate of biosynthesis of intestinal apolipoproteins such as apo B- 48, and is this the principal method of matching the "demand" with the supply of this "packaging material" needed for fat transport across the intestinal epithelial cells? Alternatively, does the maintenance of a large steady-state intracellular pool in the face of variations in intracellular apolipoprotein degradation, controlled by acute or chronic lipid ingestion, produce the required "match" between supply and demand for these proteins (as has recently been suggested in studies on liver cells) ? An in vitro system was therefore devised whereby sheets of intestinal epithelial cells (enterocytes) were freshly isolated from the jejuna of adult male Syrian golden hamsters and incubated for several hours in a medium supporting steady-state protein synthesis, in a manner which was assumed to be similar to the activity just before the killing of the donor animals. (Hamsters appear on various grounds to be a better small-animal model of human lipoprotein metabolism than the more commonly studied rats). The isolated epithelial cell sheets produced primary apolipoprotein products that could be extracted from the cells or detected in the incubation media, free from the subsequent modifications that they are known to undergo in vivo. Hamsters maintained on a low-fat chow were either studied as such or subjected to a variety of dietary treatments designed to maximize (over short or long time periods) intracellular apolipoprotein requirements for the "packaging" of tri-acylglycerol-rich lipoproteins, especially chylomicrons: acute bolus administration of lipid into the gut; overnight feeding of fat-enriched food; and chronic (six week) fat feeding. Using specific antisera and immuno-precipitation techniques, apo B- 48 and two other principal intestinal apolipoproteins were shown to be synthesized in the steady state by intestinal cell sheets derived from control animals and from those subjected to acute or chronic fat-containing diets. Secretion took place, however, only when prior fat exposure of the donor intestines had occurred. Pulse-chase labelling was used to compare the rates of apolipoprotein synthesis, degradation and secretion in the same cell sheet preparations. The rates of apolipoprotein B- 48 synthesis did not vary significantly under conditions of low or high trans-epithelial lipid flux, supporting findings derived from in vivo experimental systems. In contrast with data from other systems, however, the biosynthesis of apolipoprotein A-IV was not reproducibly increased on fat challenge. The rates of apo B- 48 degradation varied significantly and were markedly reduced under conditions of fat feeding. The experiments permit a choice between the two alternatives mentioned above: Ingestion of fatty foods, either acutely or over long periods of time, does not increase the rates of biosynthesis of apolipoproteins such as apo B- 48; but variations in the rate of intracellular degradation of this and probably other apolipoproteins allows the intestinal cells to match their requirements for lipid-transporting molecules to the demands of any given situation, relying in each case on a large steady-state intracellular pool maintained by "constitutive" biosynthesis. Importantly, there seems also to be a specific, possibly related effect of fat feeding on the secretion of lipoproteins into the intestinal extracellular fluid. These conclusions coincide with those obtained by other workers from studies of apolipoprotein B dynamics in isolated hepatocytes and in the hepatoma-derived liver cell line, Hep G 2. The mechanisms underlying these phenomena are as yet unresolved...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{traces the}} entrance of the financial industries – particularly private equity firms, corporate venture capital, and institutional investors – along with their corresponding financial logic and labor, into the film, television, and music industries from 2004 - 2016. Financialization – the growing influence of financial markets and instruments – is premised on highly-leveraged debt, labor efficiencies, and short-term profits; this project argues that it is transforming cultural production into a highly consolidated industry with rising inequality, further decreasing the diversity and heterogeneity it could provide the public sphere. In addition to charting this historical and industrial shift, this project analyzes the corresponding textual transformation, in which cultural products behave according to financial logic, becoming sites of capital formation where references, homages, and product placements form internal economies. The concept of ‘derivative media’ I employ to capture this phenomenon contains a double meaning: increasingly, the production process of popular culture ‘derives’ new content from old (sequels, adaptations, franchises, remakes, references, homages, sampling, etc.), just as the economic logic behind contemporary textuality behaves like a ‘derivative,’ a financial instrument to hedge risk. As we witnessed during the financial crash in 2007 - 2008, the derivative dismantles or unbundles any asset into individual attributes and trades them without trading the asset itself, in contracts such as futures, forwards, options, and swaps. This project demonstrates how cultural texts employ a similar ‘derivative’ logic, using intertextuality as a financial strategy, not just to sell products through brand integrations, but to maintain domination over the cultural sector through an interconnected referential economy. Through textual analysis and case studies, I explore the formal and interpretative implications that this financial shift has on cultural texts, arguing that popular digital media texts function as unbundled, risk-hedging derivatives through which capital accumulates in diversified cultural hedge funds operated by a handful of transnational media corporations. Utilizing a methodology combining political economy, data mining and visualization, ethnographic fieldwork, and textual analysis, this dissertation argues that financialization is a <b>little-understood,</b> <b>yet</b> profoundly transformative – and often destructive – force within the cultural industries...|$|R
