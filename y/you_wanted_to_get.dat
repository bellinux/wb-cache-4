Zumbrunnen stated that there was [...] "rewriting" [...] in a scene between Theodore and Samantha, after Theodore goes on a blind date. He {{explained}} that their goal in the scene was {{to make it clear}} that [...] " [...] was connecting with [...] and feeling for him. <b>You</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the sense that the conversation was drawing them closer". Steven Soderbergh became involved in the film when Jonze's original cut ran over 150 minutes, and Soderbergh cut it down to 90 minutes. This was not the final version of the film, but it assisted Jonze in removing unnecessary sub-plots. Consequently, a supporting character played by Chris Cooper that was the subject of a documentary within the film was removed from the final cut.|$|E
