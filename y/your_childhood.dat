[...] The character has also received positive attention from feminist critics; in her article [...] "12 Life Lessons 'Kim Possible' Taught Us That Are Still Pretty Relevant", Kadeen Griffiths of Bustle described Kim as an [...] "amazingly feminist" [...] character [...] "that taught girls that it was okay to overachieve, that worrying about boys didn't make you any less of a hero, and that you could invent your own slang and still sound (sort of) cool." [...] Griffiths went on to hail the character as [...] "our cartoon idol when it came to reaching for the stars and pulling it off flawlessly", concluding, [...] "at {{the end of the day}} Kim Possible could do anything. And so can all of us." [...] BuzzFeed ranked Kim ninth on its list of [...] "17 Characters From <b>Your</b> <b>Childhood</b> That Were More Feminist Than You Remember", with author Ellie Bate crediting the character with [...] "break the sexist stereotype that all cheerleaders are nothing but bimbos". Bustle writer Sarah Freymiller agreed that [...] "Kim offers a model for femininity that both bolsters and works against the typical 'high school cheerleader' stereotype." [...] Pride ranked Kim 11th on its list of [...] "13 Cartoon Characters Who Defied Gender Stereotypes". In her article [...] "Power feminism, mediated: Girl power and the commercial politics of change", Rebecca C. Hains of Salem State College cited Kim among several [...] "strong powerful girl [...] heroes" [...] who are responsible for [...] "breaking the mold by placing girls at the center of narratives with active agency and unfettered power" [...] during the early 2000s. MTV compared the character to American spy Virginia Hall in their article [...] "9 Cartoon Feminists Who Remind Us of Real-life Badass Women". While ranking Kim Possible: So the Drama the 12th most feminist Disney Channel Original Movie, Priya Krishna of BuzzFeed described Kim as [...] "obviously great". Comparing Kim to comic book superheroine Wonder Woman, Kathryn Shattuck of The New York Times wrote, [...] "MOVE over, boy wonders. The newest superhero on the block doesn't need a gimmicky mask or a jolt of testosterone to get the job done ... Kim Possible is ready and able to rescue humankind from evildoers without sacrificing her interest in boys and clothes." [...] However, in her book Girlfighting: Betrayal and Rejection, author Lyn Mikel Brown dismissed Kim as both a feminist and role model because of her alleged reliance on Ron's intelligence, as well as the observation that [...] "Her biggest threat is not evil, in fact, but the head cheerleader". Since her debut, Kim has proven herself a popular character among both girls and boys, although McCorkle admitted that [...] "whenever you have a girl in the lead doing all the action stuff, there’s a certain age group of boys who won’t admit they like the stuff. They really want to see the boy in that role." [...] McCorkle recalled an incident in which a fan of the show was very much surprised to learn that the writers were actually men upon meeting them; the fan had always just assumed that they were both young women because of the way in which they characterized Kim. At one point, fans of the character had sent her over one million e-mails via her interactive website.|$|E

Think of <b>your</b> early <b>childhood</b> experiences with this medium. How did you learn to distinguish the make-believe from the real, the commercial from the program, the drama from the news? Can you remember at what age? Are you still sometimes unsure? Did your parents use television characters and situations to teach you about the 2 ̆ 2 real 2 ̆ 2 world?
