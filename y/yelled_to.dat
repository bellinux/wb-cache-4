25|$|Earlier lineups of {{the band}} were sextets and octets {{employing}} extensive use of saxophones, percussion and live keyboards. From 1991 onwards, the band was a rock power quartet centred on two guitars (with the remaining keyboard and percussion parts sequenced on tape). Vocally, Cardiacs employ a distinctive singing style centred on Tim Smith's lead vocals (reedy and high-pitched, with a strong punk-styled Estuary English accent) and choral sections (varying from <b>yelled</b> <b>to</b> falsetto) involving most or all {{of the band}}. Smith's singing style has been described by music critics as 'skittish'; it has also been commented that his singing voice sounds very similar to his speaking one. The band's music is written almost entirely by Tim Smith, although contributions have been made by other group members.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the new {{propeller}} steamer Ogdensburg was heading the other way, from Cleveland to Ogdensburg, New York, carrying {{a load of}} wheat. At 2 am on 20 August, the paths of the two ships crossed near Long Point. On board Ogdensburg, the first mate, Degrass McNeil, was on duty. He spotted lights from Atlantic but was sure that Ogdensburg would pass {{at least a half}} mile ahead of the other ship. But then Atlantic changed course, turning north as though trying to pass in front of Ogdensburg. McNeil ordered Ogdensburg engines reversed and the ship turned to port, and since Ogdensburg steam whistle was broken, McNeil ran out onto the ship's deck and <b>yelled</b> <b>to</b> try and get the other ship to turn to starboard.|$|E

25|$|In {{the report}} Fireman Sim Webb {{states that he}} heard the torpedo explode, {{then went to the}} gangway on the engineer's side and saw the flagman with the red and white lights {{standing}} alongside the tracks. Going to the fireman's side, he saw the markers of the caboose of No. 83 and <b>yelled</b> <b>to</b> Jones. But it would have been impossible for him to have seen the flagman if the flagman had been positioned 500–800 feet (150–240 m) before the torpedoes as the report says he was. In any event, some railroad historians have disputed the official account over the years, finding it difficult if not impossible to believe that an engineer of Jones' experience would have ignored a flagman and fusees (flares) and torpedoes exploded on the rail to alert him to danger.|$|E

[...] With this, he gave special instructions to the cohorts to attack the horses' legs and thighs, since these were the only areas of the cataphracts which were not armored. Lucullus charged downwards along with his cohorts and his orders soon proved fatal: the lumbering cataphracts were caught by surprise and, in their attempts to break free from their attackers, careened into the ranks of their own men as the lines began to collapse.|$|E

[...] The few front rows of colonists, bound by the road and blocked from forming a line of fire, managed to fire over each other's heads and shoulders at the regulars massed across the bridge. Four of the eight British officers and sergeants, who were leading {{from the front of}} their troops, were wounded by the volley of musket fire. [...] At least three privates (Thomas Smith, Patrick Gray, and James Hall, all from the 4th) were killed or mortally wounded, and nine were wounded.

500|$|When the Rangers <b>yelled</b> <b>to</b> the POWs to {{come out}} and be rescued, many of the POWs feared that it was the Japanese {{attempting}} to trick them into being killed. Also, a substantial number resisted because the Rangers' weapons and uniforms looked nothing like those of a few years earlier; for example, the Rangers wore caps, earlier soldiers had M1917 Helmets and coincidentally, the Japanese also wore caps. The Rangers were challenged by the POWs and asked who they were and where they were from. Rangers sometimes had to resort to physical force to remove the detainees, throwing or kicking them out. Some of the POWs weighed so little due to illness and malnourishment that several Rangers carried two men on their backs. Once out of the barracks, they were told by the Rangers to proceed to the main, or front gate. Prisoners were disoriented because the [...] "main gate" [...] meant the entrance to the American side of the camp. POWs collided with each other in the confusion but were eventually led out by the Rangers.|$|E
500|$|On January 26, 2000, an altercation during {{filming of}} the video for [...] "Sleep Now in the Fire", {{directed}} by Michael Moore, caused {{the doors of the}} New York Stock Exchange to be closed and the band to be escorted from the site by security after band members attempted to gain entry into the exchange. The video shoot had attracted several hundred people, according to a representative for the city's Deputy Commissioner for Public Information. New York City's film office does not allow weekday film shoots on Wall Street. Moore had permission to use the steps of Federal Hall National Memorial but did not have a permit to shoot on the sidewalk or the street, nor did he have a loud-noise permit or the proper parking permits. [...] "Michael basically gave us one directorial instruction, [...] "No matter what happens, don't stop playing", Tom Morello recalls. When the band left the steps, police officers apprehended Moore and led him away. Moore <b>yelled</b> <b>to</b> the band, [...] "Take the New York Stock Exchange!" [...] In an interview with the Socialist Worker, Morello said he and scores of others ran into the Stock Exchange. [...] "About two hundred of us got through the first set of doors, but our charge was stopped when the Stock Exchange's titanium riot doors came crashing down." [...] "For a few minutes, Rage Against the Machine was able to shut down American capitalism", Moore said. [...] "An act that I am sure tens of thousands of downsized citizens would cheer".|$|E

2500|$|Pre-game rituals {{were very}} similar to rituals {{associated}} with war.' Players would decorate their bodies with paint and charcoal. [...] Players also decorated their sticks or stick racks with objects representing qualities desired in the game. [...] Strict taboos were held on what players could eat before a game, and the medicine man performed rituals to prepare players and their sticks.

At the time of Beckett's sentencing, his non-parole period was the longest ever given to a Victorian prisoner.

2500|$|On October 4, 1863 {{at the age}} of 35 Mark Lowrey was {{promoted}} to a Brigadier General.

In December 1864, during the Franklin-Nashville Campaign, an officer saw the flash of an enemy gun and <b>yelled</b> <b>to</b> Lowrey, who quickly lowered himself and the bullet stuck and killed a man behind him. Years of bad health and other reasons caused Lowrey to resign his commission as a brigadier general on March 14, 1865, almost one month before the Confederate forces surrendered at Appomattox Courthouse. Maj. Gen. Patrick Cleburne, Lowrey's divisional commander during the Franklin-Nashville Campaign, pronounced Lowrey [...] "the bravest man in the Confederate Army." ...|$|E

[...] Krempkau's first bullet struck Campbell's gun and broke his right wrist, while the second hit him in the foot. [...] Campbell screamed in pain and scooped up his gun from the ground with his left hand. [...] Stoudenmire whirled from Hale and instantly fired at Campbell who dropped his gun again, grabbed his stomach and collapsed onto the ground. [...] Stoudenmire walked slowly toward Campbell and coldly glared at him. [...] In agony, Campbell yelled, [...] "You big son of a bitch! You murdered me!" [...] Stoudenmire said nothing.

2500|$|On November 24, {{the grand}} jury decided not to indict Wilson in the {{shooting}} death of Brown.

[...] There were peaceful protests as well as rioting. A dozen buildings were burned down; there was gunfire, looting, vandalism, and destruction of two St. Louis County Police patrol cars, as well as burning of various non-police cars. Police in Ferguson deployed tear gas and ordered protesters in the street to disperse. There were 61 people arrested in Ferguson on charges including burglary and trespassing. In the hours following the grand jury decision, over 25 buildings and businesses were set on fire in the towns of Ferguson and Dellwood; many more were looted. In one case, firefighters evacuated the scene of a fire due to gunshots being heard, and for the same reason could not respond to other fires.|$|E

2500|$|Gein and {{his mother}} were now alone. Augusta had a paralyzing stroke shortly after Henry's death, and Gein devoted himself to taking care of her.

A woman inside the Smith home came outside and <b>yelled</b> <b>to</b> stop. Smith beat the dog to death. Augusta was extremely upset by this scene. What bothered her {{did not appear to be}} the brutality toward the dog but the presence of the woman. Augusta told Ed that the woman was not married to Smith so had no business being there. [...] "Smith's harlot", Augusta angrily called her. She had a second stroke soon after, and her health deteriorated rapidly. She died on December 29, 1945, at the age of 67.

2500|$|Finally, Zehaf-Bibeau {{reached an}} alcove by the {{entrance}} to the Library of Parliament, and hid out of sight of RCMP officers, who ordered him to drop his gun and surrender. The location of the alcove is near the office of the Sergeant-at-Arms of the House of Commons, Kevin Vickers. Vickers, a distinguished policeman, commander and administrator with the RCMP before he joined the staff of the House of Commons in 2005, obtained a 9mm handgun from a lock-box and entered the hall. Vickers' security team, which had been chasing Zehaf-Bibeau, <b>yelled</b> <b>to</b> Vickers that the suspect was hiding in the alcove. Vickers immediately ran behind {{the other side of a}} nearby column, then dove past the column and fired upward at Zehaf-Bibeau. [...] Witnesses and reports show RCMP Constable Curtis Barrett, leading the tactical formation, fired the shot that killed Zehaf-Bibeau after Bibeau fired in his direction. CBC television cameras on the scene recorded over 30 shots fired in the final gunfight. Footage showed a group of RCMP officers converging near the alcove; two loud gunshots are heard, then a large number of gunshots in rapid succession, then silence.|$|E
2500|$|A little-known {{example of}} Jones' heroic {{instincts}} in action {{is described by}} his biographer and friend Fred J. Lee in his book, Casey Jones: Epic of the American Railroad (1939). He recounts an incident in 1895 as Jones' train approached Michigan City, Mississippi. He had left the cab in charge of fellow Engineer Bob Stevenson, who had reduced speed sufficiently for Jones to walk safely out on the running board to oil the relief valves. He advanced from the running board to the steam chest {{and then to the}} pilot beam to adjust the spark screen. He had finished well before they arrived at the station, as planned, and was returning to the cab when he noticed a group of small children dart in front of the train some [...] ahead. All cleared the rails easily except for a little girl who suddenly froze in fear {{at the sight of the}} oncoming locomotive. Jones shouted to Stevenson to reverse the train and <b>yelled</b> <b>to</b> the girl to get off the tracks in almost the same breath. Realizing that she was still immobile, he raced to the tip of the pilot or cowcatcher and braced himself on it, reaching out as far as he could to pull the frightened but unharmed girl from the rails. The event was partially spoofed in The Brave Engineer, in which the hero rescued a damsel from a cliché bandit.|$|E
