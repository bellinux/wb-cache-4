500|$|The game {{introduces}} Yoshi, {{a dinosaur}} companion whom Mario can ride {{and who is}} able to eat most enemies. If Yoshi attempts to eat a Koopa or its shell, he will hold it in his mouth {{for a period of time}} before swallowing it; Yoshi can also spit out the shell and fire it at enemies. When holding any Koopa shell in its mouth, Yoshi gains the ability that corresponds to its own colour: a blue shell enables Yoshi to fly, a <b>yellow</b> <b>shell</b> causes Yoshi to emit dust clouds that kills nearby enemies, and a red shell allows Yoshi to produce three fireballs. Flashing Koopa shells produce all three abilities, while green shells produce none. The default Yoshi is green, but the game also contains hidden blue, yellow, and red Yoshis; the player can obtain each coloured Yoshi by finding its egg in hidden areas and feeding enemies to it until it matures.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the content of phytic acid (phytate) in soybeans (Glycine max), <b>yellow</b> <b>shelled</b> peas (Pisum sativum) and lentil (Lens esculenta). Dry seeds were grounded to a fine powder. The moisture of samples was determined according to the Official Journal of the European Union (2009). The moisture of the samples was 8. 42 % in soybeans, 11. 19 % in <b>yellow</b> <b>shelled</b> peas and 10. 07 % in lentil. The content of phytic acid was determined by the modified Holt's method (1955) using the spectrophotometer. Standard curve was measured using the Na phytate standard solution (0. 2 [*]mM). The phytate content in G. max varied from 1. 28 to 1. 86 % in dry matter and from 1. 17 to 1. 70 [*]g per 100 [*]g of the sample. The content of phytate in P. sativum ranged from 0. 49 to 0. 86 % and from 0. 43 to 0. 77 [*]g per 100 [*]g of the sample. The phytate content in L. esculenta varied from 0. 45 to 1. 39 % in dry matter and from 0. 40 to 1. 25 [*]g per 100 [*]g of the sample.

5000|$|... (Original description) The small, solid, pale <b>yellow</b> <b>shell</b> has a {{narrowly}} fusiform shape. it is tricarinate. The shoulder is sloping; The base of {{the shell}} is contracted. The siphonal canal is short and straight. The shell contains 5 whorls, of which two in the smooth, elevated protoconch. The body whorl contains three peripheral spiral keels. There are two such keels on each whorl of the teleoconch.Revolving threads occur in great numbers on the base and three or four on the shoulder. The interstices of the spirals are occupied by the broken lengths of close, fine, longitudinal, raised threads, which united described a double curve. The aperture is simple but probably underdeveloped in the specimens at hand.|$|E
5000|$|The pale <b>yellow</b> <b>shell</b> has an elongate-conic shape. (The whorls of the protoconch are decollated). The five {{to seven}} whorls of the teleoconch are {{flattened}} in the middle between the sutures, strongly contracted at the periphery, moderately roundly shouldered at the summit. They are marked by rather strong lines of growth and exceedingly fine, closely spaced, microscopic spiral striations. The sutures are strongly contracted. The periphery and {{the base of the}} body whorl are well rounded, the latter slightly inflated, marked like the spire. The aperture is ovate. The posterior angle is acute. The outer lip is thin. The columella is very strongly curved, somewhat revolute, reinforced by the base, and provided with a fold at its insertion.|$|E
5000|$|The light <b>yellow</b> <b>shell</b> has {{a broadly}} oval shape. Its length {{measures}} 4.7 mm.

The first whorl is marked by several slender strongly incised spiral lines, the remaining with numerous very fine closely crowded, wavy, spiral striations. The sutures are well impressed. The periphery and the base of the body whorl are well inflated. They are marked like the space between the sutures. The aperture is very large and very broadly ovate. The posterior angle is acute.

5000|$|Two species {{commonly}} known as [...] "horse clams" [...] inhabit the intertidal zone of the West Coast of the United States: the Pacific gaper, T. nuttallii, which is more abundant south to California; and the fat gaper, T. capax, which is more abundant north to Alaska. Both have oval and chalky-white or <b>yellow</b> <b>shells</b> with patches of brown periostracum (leather-like skin) on the shell. These clams are also commonly called [...] "gapers" [...] because their shells are flared around the siphon and do not completely close, rather like geoduck clams. Like geoducks, {{they are unable to}} completely retract the siphon within the shell, though less extremely, as the siphon on Tresus species is not as large.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: In Cepaea hortensis (O. F. Müller), {{the shell}} lip (peristome) is usually white. In most areas the lip col-our {{allows us to}} {{reliably}} distinguish this species from C. nemoralis (Linnaeus) in which the lip is usually dark brown. Populations polymorphic for lip colour are rare and occur only locally. Here I report on populations of C. hortensis containing dark-lipped individuals in north-western Poland and in north-central Germany. The fre-quency of dark-lipped individuals ranged from 3 % to 31 %. It was common in brown and pink shells, but oc-curred only sporadically in <b>yellow</b> <b>shells.</b> No selective factors promoting dark-lipped C. hortensis are evident. The occurrence of this phenotype is likely to reflect random events. KEY WORDS: colour polymorphism, land snails, population genetics, random event...|$|R
