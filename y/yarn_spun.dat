25|$|To make various yarns, besides adding novelty elements, spinners {{can vary}} {{all the same}} things as in a {{machined}} yarn, i.e., the fibre, the preparation, the colour, the spinning technique, {{the direction of the}} twist, etc. A common misconception is <b>yarn</b> <b>spun</b> from rolags may not be as strong, but the strength of a yarn is actually based on the length of hair fibre and the degree of twist. When working with shorter hairs, such as llama or angora rabbit, the spinner may choose to integrate longer fibres, such as mohair, to prevent yarn breakage. Yarns made of shorter fibres are also given more twist than yarns of longer fibres, and are generally spun with the short draw technique.|$|E

At that time, acetate dope was needed by the aircraft industry to coat and stretch the fabric on aircraft fuselages. [...] The American Cellulose & Chemical Manufacturing Company began construction of the Cumberland facility in 1918, but {{the war was over}} before the plant could be completed. [...] As a result, production at the Cumberland factory was shifted from producing acetate dope for the military to production of cellulose acetate yarn for the textile industry. The first acetate <b>yarn</b> <b>spun</b> in America was on Christmas Day, 1924, at the Cumberland plant. The company introduced the word [...] "Celanese," [...] a portmanteau of [...] "cellulose" [...] and [...] "ease," [...] as a trade name in 1925, and the company itself took this name in 1927. Celanese acetate was introduced as [...] "Artificial Silk." [...] In 1926, a weaving mill was established in the Cumberland plant to develop acetate-containing fabrics on a commercial scale. This mill included equipment that could dye and weave the new fibers successfully. In 1974, Celanese established a Cytrel Tobacco Supplement plant in Cumberland with a peak capacity of 20 million lbs a year. The company closed its Cumberland plant in 1983.|$|E
