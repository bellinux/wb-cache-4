However, critics argue that a trade-off between the environment and a need for food is not inevitable, and that pesticides simply replace good agronomic practices such as crop rotation. The UNEP introduces the Push–pull agricultural pest management technique which involves intercropping that uses plant aromas to repel or push away pests while pulling in or attracting the right insects. [...] "The implementation of push-pull in eastern Africa has significantly increased maize yields and the combined cultivation of N-fixing forage crops has enriched the soil and has also provided farmers with feed for livestock. With increased livestock operations, the farmers are able to produce meat, milk and other dairy products and they use the manure as organic fertiliser that returns nutrients to the fields." ...|$|E
40|$|Market {{access is}} a major {{constraint}} facing agricultural commercialization in Kenya. The pressure on arable land and market changes are mainly felt by the smallholder farmers who are faced with high transaction costs. In addition, these farmers face a number of institutional and technical factors putting their market survival at stake. To curb these challenges, formation of farmer groups and organizations has become important in bringing about collective action whose basis is social capital. However, this capital must be mobilized through group membership and other social dimensions to achieve collective action. This paper therefore, sought determine influence of the social capital dimensions, socio-economic and institutional factors on group’s performance. The {{study was conducted in}} Mwea sub-county, Kirinyaga County and a multistage sampling method was used to obtain a sample of 174 farmers (95 group members and 79 non-group members) who were interviewed using structured questionnaires. Descriptive statistics was utilized in characterizing socio-economic attributes of the smallholder French beans farmers. Tobit model was used to determine influence of the social capital dimensions and institutional factors on group’s performance. The results showed that gender, age, education level, French beans <b>yield,</b> <b>farming</b> experience, transport cost, off-farm income, initial social capital endowment, trust index and meeting attendance significantly influenced the extent of commercialization.

40|$|Application of the Sustainable Nitrogen Management Program in {{two small}} {{agricultural}} watersheds (Arquennes – Belgium) and impact evaluation by monitoring of nitrate fluxes at outlets and by numerical modeling. Four water catchments {{used by the}} Walloon Society of Water (SWDE) in the rural village of Arquennes (Province of Hainaut, Belgium) have been contaminated by nitrate (concentrations between 60 and 70 mg NO 3 -·l- 1) for several years. The catchment basins (31 ha and 47 ha) are located exclusively in a cultivated area on loamy soils. Since October 2004, these basins {{have been used as}} a pilot area for the environmental evaluation of good agricultural practices as regards nitrogen management (adaptation of amounts of mineral nitrogen fertilizers, farm manure management, soil cover after harvest, etc.) thanks to monitoring by farmers. This approach fits into the general pattern of the Sustainable Nitrogen Management Program (PGDA in French), which implements the European Nitrates Directive as part of Walloon legislation. The second objective of the working scheme is to study and to set up a decision-making tool aimed at preventing the contamination of water by agricultural nitrate around water catchments. Two numerical models (SWAT and FEFLOW®) were used together in order to simulate the passage of water and nitrogen from the soil surface to the water catchments outlets. Calibration and validation of models were based, among other things, on soil and subsoil characterization and on tracer testing in both saturated and unsaturated zones. Moreover crop <b>yield,</b> <b>farming</b> practices, water and nitrate fluxes in water catchments, groundwater levels and nitrate concentration in groundwater were monitored for eight years. The results of simulations show that the application of PGDA in Arquennes watersheds would lead to a decrease in nitrate concentration (to almost 50 mg NO 3 -·l- 1) in water catchments in 2012. This expected improvement in water quality has been visible since 2009 in water catchments, with mean nitrate concentrations of lower than 50 mg NO 3 -·l- 1 at the end of 2012...|$|E

40|$|To {{determine}} {{the most important}} production constraints and associated yield losses for six major food crops in 13 farming systems with high poverty in Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and East Asia, surveys were conducted with 672 experts representing a diversity of backgrounds and experience. Respondents reported large gaps between highest achieved crop yield on smallholder farms and average yield on farm. Yield gaps were smallest for rice (about 60 % of current average smallholder farm grain yields), mid size for wheat and cassava, and larger (sometimes double current farm yields) for sorghum, cowpea and chickpea. Gaps were also smaller in the high input and <b>yield</b> <b>farming</b> systems of East Asia and largest in the marginal, drier systems, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. Four categories of production constraint (abiotic, biotic, management and socio-economic) were considered important contributors to yield gaps. A diversity of specific constraints was reported for the crops in the different systems. The most severe and widespread specific constraints for wheat involved the deficiency, high cost and poor management of N fertilizer, and problems associated with drought stress at grain filling, mid season drought and irrigation management. Those for rice included N fertilizer problems, soil fertility depletion, various leaf, stem and head pests and diseases, weed competition and inadequate water management. Striga and weed competition, soil resource degradation, poor soil fertility management, and drought were the most severe specific constraints for sorghum. Insect pests of pod, leaf, stem and flower and {{the high cost of}} their control dominated the constraint set for cowpea. Helicoverpa pod borer, Botrytis grey mould and control costs were the most severe for chickpea. Unsuitable varieties/poor seed, soil infertility and fertilizer constraints were also widespread with the legumes. Marketing problems and lack of finance were concerns for cassava along with weed competition, African cassava mosaic virus and poor varieties/planting materials. The findings can help to inform priority setting for international agricultural research and development activities on important food crops in major farming systems occupying areas of high poverty.

40|$|Accurate {{estimates}} of farm-level crop yield probability density functions (PDF’s) are crucial for studying various crop insurance programs and production under risk and uncertainty. Unfortunately, farm-level crop yield PDF’s {{are difficult to}} estimate {{due to the lack}} of sufficient <b>farm</b> <b>yield</b> data. County yield data cover much longer time periods than <b>farm</b> <b>yield</b> data, but using county yield distributions to conjecture about <b>farm</b> <b>yield</b> distributions is dangerous. The theoretical reason is that county yield is the average of correlated <b>farm</b> <b>yields,</b> for which there is no recognizable probability density function (PDF). This paper investigates the relationship between <b>farm</b> and county <b>yield</b> distributions using both statistical theory and the Monte-Carlo simulation method. Results show that under suitable <b>farm</b> <b>yield</b> correlation and density structures, the shape of yield distribution at the farm level is similar to that at the county level. A method is then developed for estimating and simulating <b>farm</b> <b>yield</b> distributions based on county yield PDF estimates and information contained in <b>farm</b> <b>yield</b> data. Six candidate yield models: normal, beta, Weibull, inverse hyperbolic sine transformation, a mixture of normals, and kernel density estimators are applied to Branch County corn yields after detrending nonstationary yield data. Goodness-of-fit results for normal, beta and Weibull distributions show that Weibull best fits county yields.

40|$|This study {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} soil fertility maintenance in relation to crop <b>yield</b> and <b>farm</b> income growth in general in the west African semi-arid tropics. It describes the structural and the input-output characteristics of food crop production and soil fertility management inside a typical village of southern Upper-Volta and then proceeds to infer from cross-section variations the relationships among the existing soil fertility management practices, soil fertility, crop <b>yields,</b> <b>farm</b> income, resource productivities and the average intensity of land utilization. These inferences are used to identify the technical changes {{as well as the}} input and output substitutions that characterize the adjustment mechanism of the cropping system vis-a-vis land use intensification. The technical, social and economic factors that explain and constrain the maintenance and the improvement of soil fertility and thereby limit the growth and the development of the cropping system are pointed out together with the types of agricultural research orientations and rural development policy actions that are most needed to effectively and efficiently relax the major constraints. The cropping system {{has been shown to be}} composed of five soil-crop management rings, with varying intensities of land utilization, that conceptually surround the household's habitat. Physical measures of soil fertility suggested that the cropping system more or less maintains or improves the chemical fertility of soils on upland but fails to do so on lowland. However, on upland and over the long term, an intensification of cultivation may have some adverse effects on the physical status of the soil and lead to a decline in field capacity. Statistical measures of <b>yields,</b> <b>farm</b> income and resource productivities following the intensity of land use scale suggested than an increase in the intensity of land utilization caused by an increasing demand for arable lands has no adverse effect on crop <b>yields,</b> <b>farm</b> income and resource productivities. This is made possible by the adjustment mechanism of the cropping system vis-a-vis land use intensification. The main feature of the adjustment process is besides out-migration, a substitution of red sorghum for millet and white sorghum, accompanied by a substitution of mineral and organic fertilizers for fallow...|$|R

Yields of wheat, pea, bean, maize and potato predicted from data for climate, soil {{and land use}} technology were compared with observed <b>yields</b> from <b>farm</b> trials and from seed station and research station trials. The predicted range of yield for each crop suitability class enclosed the mean <b>farm</b> <b>yields</b> 13 times out of 16 and yields on seed stations and research stations 10 times out of 15 and 14 times out of 21 respectively.

40|$|AbstractVariations {{of climate}} {{are a major}} cause of {{uncertainty}} in crop yields. This paper analyses the impacts of extreme weather events on wheat yields reported in the German Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN). The FADN-sample has continuously encompassed about 11, 500 farms each year since 1995 / 96. While the average of <b>farm</b> <b>yields</b> within a county correspond to the official average county <b>yield,</b> <b>farm</b> <b>yields</b> show higher annual fluctuations over time. In order to assess the impacts of extreme weather events on wheat <b>yields,</b> the <b>farm</b> data is spatially joined with data on local natural site conditions on the municipality level. Soil data such as the field capacity is taken from soil maps and altitude above sea level from digital terrain maps. The variables are averaged over the arable land in the municipalities using GIS. Meteorological data observed at weather observation stations of the German Weather Service such as temperature (minimum, average, maximum), precipitation, and potential evaporation are interpolated on a 1 x 1 km grid and aggregated to municipalities. Various indicators reflecting extreme weather events such as the number of days with extreme frost, freeze-thaw cycles, drought and heat during the vegetation period and enduring rain and wet soil at harvest are derived {{on the basis of the}} soil and daily weather data. Multivariate regression analyses are applied for clustered homogenous soil-climate-regions to elicit the impacts of defined extreme climate events on wheat yields. First results reflect the regionally different exposure to extreme weather events in Germany. While farmers in the northern regions suffered rather from enduring rain and soil moisture at harvest, drought caused major problems on sandy soils in the eastern regions. Of course, due to the focus on weather extremes, a substantial part of weather-induced yield fluctuation remains unexplained. Nevertheless, the results provide valuable information regarding risk management for farms...|$|R
