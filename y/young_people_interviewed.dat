40|$|Drawing on data {{collected}} from nineteen qualitative semi-structured interviews with young lesbians and gay men, this thesis addresses the construction of sexual selves by those <b>young</b> <b>people</b> <b>interviewed</b> for this Ph. D. project. The interviews were conducted between January and December 2008. Participants were aged from sixteen to twenty-one, and all {{were living in the}} North-East of England at the time. This project is situated within what {{is considered to be a}} moment of social change in respect of the construction of lesbian and gay identities, notably due to the ‘normalization’ of those identities. This is a period in which the young lesbians and gay men interviewed for this project may be seen as growing up and coming out in. The study itself explores the ways in which the <b>young</b> <b>people</b> <b>interviewed</b> developed a sense of themselves as sexual, asking about the significance of lesbian and gay identities in the construction of those selves. Theoretically, a symbolic interactionist perspective is adopted, this project exploring the ‘everyday’ processes through which sexual selves were made and maintained. The {{data collected}} suggested a number of complex reflexive debates in which the young lesbians and gay men came to understand themselves as sexual. Addressing issues of desire and intimacy, the adoption of sexual identities, negotiations of sameness and difference, and the telling of sexual lives, this thesis discusses the complex, and at times paradoxical, ways in which lesbian and gay sexual selves were made.

40|$|Background and purpose: There {{is little}} {{documented}} evidence {{of young people}} with congenital cardiac disease being consulted as to what help, if any, they really need {{in relation to their}} condition. Most research concentrates on the medical aspects of the condition. There are studies of psychological and social functioning, but few have directly sought the opinions of the young people. More recent research has indicated a need for health professionals to develop services to meet both psychosocial and physical needs of young people with congenital cardiac disease. The findings of the recent Kennedy Report support this need. The {{purpose of this study was}} to explore the views of young people with a range of congenital cardiac conditions, on what would help them better deal with their condition, and when and how help might be provided. Methods: This was a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews. We interviewed 16 young people in their own home. Interviews were tape-recorded and transcribed. Analysis was conducted using the "Framework" method. Results: Whilst most of the <b>young</b> <b>people</b> <b>interviewed</b> actively manage their condition, they think more support from others would be beneficial. Issues of activity and communication were cited most often as areas requiring more understanding from people they interact with, for example teachers and peers. The discussion focuses on how health professionals might change or develop their practice to help young people better cope with their condition. Conclusions: Most of the <b>young</b> <b>people</b> <b>interviewed</b> in this study had developed their own strategies for coping with their condition.

This research aimed to provide {{a greater understanding of}} <b>young</b> <b>people</b> who leave full-time education and who are characterised as having entered jobs without training. A sample of <b>young</b> <b>people</b> who were in jobs without training and who were not working towards or did not have, an NVQ level two (or above) qualification were interviewed.

40|$|Issues {{related to}} {{multilingualism}} and its importance to each {{individual and the}} whole society {{are the subject of}} today’s school debate. The mere fact that the aspects of multilingualism are discussed actively not only in a school environment but even in the mass media and other communities proves that multilingualism is an important and complex phenomenon in our lives. The subject that I have chosen to study into is about the importance of multilingualism for minority individuals and the conditions for their multilingualism. The aim of this research is to investigate the importance of multilingualism for identity formation among several Russian-speaking young people who were born and raised in Estonia, as well as to try to understand the factors that were relevant to these young people's multilingualism and their view on it. Six young people aged 16 - 19 were considered in this study. The research method is based on a life history approach. The data has been collected through interviews and correspondence. Symbolic interactionism and social constructivism have provided the theoretical framework of the study and serve as tools for the analysis and interpretation of collected data. Based on the results of my research, it can be concluded that multilingualism are of great importance for identity formation among the individuals investigated. All young people have a positive attitude towards their multilingualism and see it as an asset. They try to maintain and further develop its multilingualism with the help of their school, family and friends as well as on their own. The results of the study also show that all of the <b>young</b> <b>people</b> <b>interviewed</b> have developed the reflexive identity thanks to their multilingualism. Multilingualism provides the young people with an opportunity to become proficient in several cultures, thereby enriching their lives and identity. Due to their multilingualism, reflexive identity and meta-knowledge about themselves, all the <b>young</b> <b>people</b> <b>interviewed</b> had an opportunity to get access to different contact surfaces, and be involved in several different contexts, which can be an asset in times of globalization...|$|E

The relevance of this research to the interests of <b>young</b> <b>people</b> themselves is not widely considered. The aim of this ongoing work is to create a collaborative adolescent health research charter between <b>young</b> <b>people,</b> funders, researchers and policymakers. METHODS: A collaborative session at the 2012 AYPH conference in Cardiff engaged 19 <b>young</b> <b>people</b> in a series of peer-led activities relating to both the content and infrastructure of adolescent health research in the UK. This included the <b>young</b> <b>people</b> <b>interviewing</b> a senior researcher and a senior health policymaker who were keynote speakers at the conference. Reflection points included: ♣ How can we make sure research about <b>young</b> <b>people’s</b> health is relevant, useful and helps improve their health? ♣ What five key areas of <b>young</b> <b>people’s</b> health {{do you want to see}} improved and why? RESULTS: The <b>young</b> <b>people</b> at the conference emphasised the importance of meaningful participation of <b>young</b> <b>people</b> in the design and development of research. They expressed concern about the research cycle, particularly how long it takes to get to dissemination work. As a group, we acknowledged that young research participants may well be adults by the time the research is published.
