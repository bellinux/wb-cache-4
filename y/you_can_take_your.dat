25|$|In January 2007, the European {{parliament}} {{adopted a}} motion decreeing that all international trains must carry bicycles. In some cities, bicycles {{may also be}} carried on local trains, trams and buses {{so that they may}} be used {{at either end of the}} trip. The Rheinbahn transit company in Düsseldorf permits bicycle carriage on all its bus, tram and train services at any time of the day,. In Munich bicycles are allowed on the S-Bahn commuter trains outside of rush hours, and folding bikes are allowed on city busses. In Copenhagen, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> bicycle with you in the S-tog commuter trains, all times a day with no additional costs. In France, the prestigious TGV high-speed trains are even having some of their first class capacity converted to store bicycles. There have also been schemes, such as in Victoria, British Columbia, Acadia, and Canberra, Australia to provide bicycle carriage on buses using externally mounted bike carriers.|$|E
2500|$|Island Records {{gave the}} band a choice: [...] "We're legally obliged {{to make your}} [...] but we’re not really up for it. So we either do it or do a half-arsed job of it or <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> full record advance and leave." [...] The band took the advance {{and used it to}} build a {{recording}} studio in Watford in July 2013. A friend of the band had a lease on a few rehearsal rooms. The band initially wanted the room as a storage area for their equipment, but this soon changed into a storage and rehearsal area, then into a storage, rehearsal and recording studio. Sansom spent a week looking up studio equipment on Gumtree, which the band would drive to pick up. Two items of gear the band acquired was a tape machine and a 1980s recording console.|$|E

6000|$|Jocelyn stooped and {{examined}} the cause of discomfiture. 'I think if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> boot off,' he said, 'your foot might slip out, leaving the boot behind.' ...|$|E

All further details you will learn from Colonel Wauchop, and the paymaster will have orders to issue two months' pay to each of you, in advance.

6000|$|... "I hoped you would," [...] Kendricks replied. [...] "You've got the {{atmosphere}} here. You're {{sitting in the}} heart of the France that belongs to the French. It isn't for nothing that I've taken you round a little with me since we were here. Chance was kind, too, when it brought us up against Freudenberg. Remember, Julien, journalism isn't the gentlemanly art it was ten or twenty years ago. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> up <b>your</b> pen and stab. That's what we want." ...|$|R

6000|$|The girl’s eyes flashed, and {{she slowly}} {{straightened}} herself. “It is fortunate for <b>you</b> that I <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> word, because I had formed my own conclusions,” she said. “Don’t suppose I should sit here {{talking to you}} if I had thought you were guilty. This, however, is quite between ourselves.” ...|$|R

I own that I felt rather uneasy at the charge of two such young cockerels, though I could not refuse when the countess, my aunt, begged me to let you ride with me; but in future I shall feel easy about you, seeing that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> both <b>take</b> <b>your</b> own parts stoutly.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘I believe with you, sir,’ Otto said; ‘and yet the {{parallel}} is inexact. For the farmer’s life is natural and simple; but the prince’s is both artificial and complicated. It {{is easy to}} do right in the one, and exceedingly difficult not to do wrong in the other. If your crop is blighted, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> off <b>your</b> bonnet and say, “God’s will be done”; but if the prince meets with a reverse, {{he may have to}} blame himself for the attempt. And perhaps, if all the kings in Europe were to confine themselves to innocent amusement, the subjects would be the better off.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, no,' said Logan. 'I {{have played}} second fiddle to you often, do {{let me take}} command this time--or, at all events, {{wait till you see}} my plot unfolded.

6000|$|... "Perhaps {{we may not}} {{be staying}} there," [...] Wulf said encouragingly. [...] "Maybe the earl is going to start on some expedition; though we have heard of no trouble, either in the North or in Wales. But even if I stay at court, Osgod, you will often be able to be away, and can spend some hours a day at the smithy, where, if <b>you</b> like, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> off <b>your</b> smock and belabour iron to your heart's content.

5000|$|The film {{opened to}} good reviews praising for its content. IBNLive.com {{reviewed}} and said, [...] "Despite its predictability, 'Nammanna Don' wins {{mainly because of}} its breezy narration. The film has space for both comedy and emotional sequences.

DNAIndia.com gave 2.5 stars out of 5 and said, [...] "One {{of the best things}} about the film is the complete absence of violence and being able to send a message through humour; yes, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> definitely <b>take</b> <b>your</b> family".|$|R
