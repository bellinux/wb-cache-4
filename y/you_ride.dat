A group of volunteer riders called WARBYs (We Are Right Behind <b>You)</b> <b>ride</b> throughout the field, providing emergency assistance for bicycle breakdowns and rider difficulties. A number of sag wagons accompany the ride to pick up riders and bikes {{who are unable to}} continue due to their bicycle being beyond roadside repair, injury, sickness, or general weariness.|$|E
500|$|Mulholland Drive {{has been}} {{compared}} with Billy Wilder's film noir classic Sunset Boulevard (1950), another tale about broken dreams in Hollywood, and early in the film Rita is shown crossing Sunset Boulevard at night. Apart from both titles being named after iconic Los Angeles streets, Mulholland Drive is [...] "Lynch's unique account of what held Wilder's attention too: human putrefaction (a term Lynch used several times during his press conference at the New York Film Festival 2001) {{in a city of}} lethal illusions". The title of the film is a reference to iconic Hollywood culture. David Lynch lives near Mulholland Drive, and stated in an interview, [...] "At night, <b>you</b> <b>ride</b> {{on the top of the}} world. In the daytime <b>you</b> <b>ride</b> on top of the world, too, but it's mysterious, and there's a hair of fear because it goes into remote areas. You feel the history of Hollywood in that road." [...] Watts also had experience with the road before her career was established: [...] "I remember driving along the street many times sobbing my heart out in my car, going, 'What am I doing here? ...|$|E
500|$|The indie pop album {{combines}} {{elements of}} high-quality recording common in pop music with lo-fi noise music styles, {{leading to a}} complicated sound of [...] "bombast and confusion" [...] and a feel of the tracks being [...] "disgusting" [...] yet [...] "catchy" [...] as the band described. Nows Carla Gillis gave style descriptions such as [...] "soul-grunge" [...] and [...] "sludge-pop" [...] to label this sound. Elements from a big number of genres are present on Weaves, such as neo-pop, R, soul, art rock, and psychedelic music. The lyrics on the songs are filled with sexual innuendo such as [...] "Won't <b>you</b> <b>ride</b> my motorcycle / Take a ride", which Gillis wrote [...] "can turn into both amusing nah-nah-nah insolence and wailing, dead-serious desperation on a dime." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "And {{the horse}} <b>you</b> <b>rode</b> in on" [...] was a {{favorite}} of Regan. He learned it from a poker buddy in Texas who said [...] "fuck you and the horse <b>you</b> <b>rode</b> in on." [...] Regan adopted {{the latter part of}} the phrase. [...] In the portrait of Regan that hangs on the third floor of the treasury, the title of a book in the background reads And the Horse You Rode In On.|$|R

[...] But Balaam's donkey asked Balaam (in the words of [...] ), [...] "Am I not your donkey?" [...] Balaam replied, [...] "Merely for carrying loads." [...] Balaam's donkey said (in the words of [...] ), [...] "Upon which you have ridden." [...] Balaam replied, [...] "That was only by chance." [...] Balaam's donkey insisted (in the words of [...] ), [...] "Ever since I was yours until this day." ...|$|E
2500|$|On the {{occasion}} of an anniversary of the October Revolution, Furmanov gives a political lecture to {{the rank and file}} soldiers: [...] "...And now we are on our glorious way to the shining horizons of Communism!"

[...] / [...] "See Petka, it is a line you may see far away in the steppe when the weather is good. And it's a tricky one – no matter how long <b>you</b> <b>ride</b> towards it, you'll never reach it. You'll only wear down your horse."

2500|$|Cao Cao's general Yu Jin was {{captured}} by Guan Yu during the Battle of Fancheng and was held captive in Nan Commandery. After Sun Quan seized control of Nan Commandery, he released Yu Jin and treated him with respect. One day, when Sun Quan travelling on horseback, he asked Yu Jin to ride beside him. Yu Fan saw that and shouted at Yu Jin, [...] "You're a surrendered prisoner-of-war. How dare <b>you</b> <b>ride</b> side-by-side with my lord!" [...] He wanted to hit Yu Jin with his horsewhip but Sun Quan ordered him to stop. Later, when Yu Jin joined Sun Quan in a feast with his subjects on board a ship, he shed tears when he heard music being played. Yu Fan mocked him, [...] "Are you trying to pretend to plead for mercy?" [...] Sun Quan was very unhappy with Yu Fan.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{two types}} of stance-direction used by snowboarders. A [...] "regular" [...] stance places the rider's left foot {{at the front of the}} snowboard. [...] "Goofy", the {{opposite}} stance direction, places the rider's right foot at the front, as in skateboarding. Regular is the most common. There are different ways to determine whether a rider is [...] "regular" [...] or [...] "goofy". One method used for first time riders is to observe the first step forward when walking or climbing up stairs. The first foot forward would be the foot set up at the front of the snowboard. Another method used for first time riders is to use the same foot that you kick a football with as your back foot (though this can be an inaccurate sign for some, as there are people who prefer goofy though are right handed, and therefore naturally kick a football with their right foot). This is a good method for setting up the snowboard stance for a new snowboarder. However having a surfing or skateboarding background will also help a person determine their preferred stance, although not all riders will have the same stance skateboarding and snowboarding. Another way to determine a rider's stance is to get the rider to run and slide on a tiled or wooden floor, wearing only socks, and observe which foot the person puts forward during the slide. This simulates the motion of riding a snowboard and exposes that persons natural tendency to put a particular foot forward. Another method is to stand behind the first-timer and give them a shove, enough for them to put one foot forward to stop themselves from falling. Other good ways of determining which way <b>you</b> <b>ride</b> are rushing a door (leading shoulder equals leading foot) or going into a defensive boxing stance (see which foot goes forward).|$|E
