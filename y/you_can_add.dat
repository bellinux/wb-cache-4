25|$|Any {{family of}} sets that {{satisfies}} (2–4) is called a filter (an example: the complements to the finite sets, {{it is called the}} Fréchet filter and it is used in the usual limit theory). If (1) also holds, U is called an ultrafilter (because <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>add</b> no more sets to it without breaking it). The only explicitly known example of an ultrafilter is the {{family of sets}} containing a given element (in our case, say, the number 10). Such ultrafilters are called trivial, and if we use it in our construction, we come back to the ordinary real numbers. Any ultrafilter containing a finite set is trivial. It is known that any filter can be extended to an ultrafilter, but the proof uses the axiom of choice. The existence of a nontrivial ultrafilter (the ultrafilter lemma) can be added as an extra axiom, as it is weaker than the axiom of choice.|$|E

To me, I think Martin Scorsese’s Goodfellas is that type of film for the gangster genre. In the 21 years since the film was released, so many filmmakers have {{tried so hard to}} copy Goodfellas success, and so few have gotten even close to capturing the magic that Scorsese did in one of his very best films. The 21 years have been littered with a bunch of pale imitations. To that list, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>add</b> Jonathan Hensleigh’s Kill the Irishman, which wants so desperately to be Goodfellas, and comes up so very, very short." ...|$|E

2500|$|The album {{features}} {{a variety of}} different musical styles in its tracks. As a testament to the amount of time of production, each song [...] "sounds different from the next," [...] according to Urie. In the beginning, the band had no direction for music or lyrics. However, after returning to the studio and restarting production, the band became excited to start [...] with a second chance. [...] "We've been working on music for {{about a year and a}} half, so I think that partly adds to why some of the songs have some varying styles," [...] Smith said. [...] "Part of it was us, at the beginning, trying to figure out what we wanted to do – we had a new opportunity with just the two of us – and as we sort of got a better hold on what that was, just kind of went from there." [...] The duo picked the best songs out of 30 written as time went on. Urie said the most exciting part of the recording process was [...] "...You get all the work done, record the song, arrange it and then <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>add</b> the fun little stuff, little pieces of voices and talking and weird instruments you hadn’t used before." [...] The band's musical experimentation stretched as far as employing an iPad to record synthesizers on the record.
