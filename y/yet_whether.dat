Such room temperature ferromagnetism in ZnO:Mn has been observed, {{but it is not}} clear <b>yet</b> <b>whether</b> it originates from the matrix itself or from secondary oxide phases.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{great degree}} of {{internal}} debate about which training program best prepares an MT for industry work. <b>Yet,</b> <b>whether</b> one has learned medical transcription from an online course, community college, high school night course, or on-the-job training in a doctor's office or hospital, a knowledgeable MT is highly valued. In lieu of these AHDI certification credentials, MTs who can consistently and accurately transcribe multiple document work-types and return reports within a reasonable turnaround-time (TAT) are sought after. TATs set by the service provider or agreed to by the transcriptionist should be reasonable but consistent {{with the need to}} return the document to the patient's record in a timely manner.|$|E
25|$|The {{timing of}} gas {{generation}} presents the greatest exploration risk. Maximum burial of, and primary gas migration from, the source rocks could have terminated {{as early as}} the Jurassic, whereas many of the tilted fault blocks were reactivated or created during Paleogene inversion of the basin. However, {{it is also possible that}} a secondary gas charge occurred during regional heating associated with intrusion of Paleogene dykes, such as those that crop out nearby on the coastline of north Wales. (Floodpage et al., 1999) have invoked this second phase of Paleogene hydrocarbon generation as an important factor in the charging of the East Irish Sea Basin's oil and gas fields. It is not clear as <b>yet</b> <b>whether</b> aeromagnetic anomalies in the southeast of Caernarfon Bay are imaging a continuation of the dyke swarm into this area too, or whether they are instead associated with deeply buried Permian syn-rift volcanics. Alternatively, the fault block traps could have been recharged by exsolution of methane from formation brines as a direct result of the Tertiary uplift (cf. Doré and Jensen, 1996).|$|E

25|$|Like other Neolithic societies, the Cucuteni-Trypillia culture {{had very}} little {{division}} of labor, other than the ubiquitous dualistic division based upon a person's gender. Although this culture's settlements sometimes grew to become {{some of the largest}} on earth at the time (up to 15,000 people), there is no evidence yet discovered of large-scale labor specialization. Their settlements were designed with the houses connecting with one another in long rows that circled around the center of the community. Some settlements did have a central communal building that was designated as a sanctuary or shrine, but there is no indication <b>yet</b> <b>whether</b> or not a separate group or individual would have been supported by the community as a full-time priest or priestess. Almost every home was a self-supporting unit, much as if isolated {{in the middle of the}} woods, rather than part of a large settlement. Most homes had their own ceramic kilns, baking ovens, and work centers, indicating that almost all of the work that needed to be done to maintain human existence at the Neolithic standard of living could be done within each household in the community.|$|E
500|$|... "Our Father" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics; some {{thought that it}} was dull, though Smits' performance received widespread critical acclaim. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said that he was [...] "frustrated" [...] by the episode despite not finding any faults with it, writing, [...] "I can't help thinking that I've seen as much of Dexter Morgan's world as I need to." [...] Matt Fowler, writing for IGN, thought that the revelation of Rita's pregnancy was [...] "an interesting development, but not necessarily something that instantly catapults me to the edge of my seat" [...] but that Smits as Miguel could improve [...] "even [...] great [...] like Dexter". The Australians Stephen Romei felt that, with the beginning of the third season, [...] "Dexter has gone from an eight to a six" [...] {{on a scale of one}} to ten, saying that the show [...] "has lost its edge" [...] with the hypocrisy of Dexter being a supposed sociopath despite holding several relationships. Los Angeles Times critic Claire Zulkey was [...] "not sure <b>yet</b> <b>whether</b> [...] good". Ray Ellis of Blogcritics felt that [...] "the series has settled into a state of complacency" [...] and could not [...] "escape the feeling I've seen this before". On the other hand, the San Francisco Chronicles Tim Goodman wrote that [...] "the whiff of normalcy for Dexter" [...] gives viewers [...] "a magnificent tease" [...] and likened the fast-moving plot to [...] "the urgency of brilliance". TV Squad critic Debra McDuffee was [...] "pleasantly surprised by Smits" [...] and said that, thus far, [...] "season three is a good one". TV Guides Paula Paige, who was [...] "thrilled" [...] to see Smits join the cast, said, [...] "What the Dexter season three opener lacked in explosive excitement, it certainly made up for in Jimmy Smits." [...] Daniel Fienberg, writing for Zap2it, said that the combination of Hall and Smits was [...] "as good as TV acting gets" [...] and that, in comparison to the second season's opening, [...] "the show's creative team appears to have done it again".|$|E
