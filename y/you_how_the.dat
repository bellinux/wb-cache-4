The greatness and the suddenness of the misfortune doth so perplex me, until I do hear from <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> matter standeth, or how this evil should light upon me, considering what the malicious world will bruit, as I can take no rest.|$|E
500|$|Peter, not cowardly {{enough to}} fear an old woman, nor superstitious {{enough to believe}} in her power, {{threaten}}s the old fairy, trying to chase her away. Unfortunately, she does indeed have fairy powers and casts a spell that forces Peter to threaten anyone he encounters or, if alone, to fight imaginary enemies. Peter flees before he can get himself into trouble by threatening anyone bigger than him, calling out challenges as he goes. Sergeant Klooque approaches the old woman next and tries to use his military charm to win her over. It turns out that she hates soldiers, and she strikes out with her stick, making him duck and dodge. She then casts a spell to make his cringing, dodging and ducking permanent, intending that he lose his reputation and be branded a coward. Pipette arrives and watches his behaviour in astonishment. [...] "He's showing you how he fought the enemy at Johannesburg," [...] exclaims the old lady, but he replies [...] "No, my dear!" [...] I'm showing <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> enemy fought us. This {{is the way they}} retreated". He leaves, cringing and pleading for imaginary attackers to stop as he goes.|$|E
500|$|The Los Angeles Times extolled the film's {{ensemble}} voice {{talent and}} elaborate musical sequences, and declared Frozen was [...] "a welcome return to greatness for Walt Disney Animation Studios." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Owen Gleiberman gave the film a [...] "B+" [...] grade and labeled it as a [...] "squarely enchanting fairy tale that shows <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> definition of what's fresh in animation can shift." [...] Richard Corliss of Time stated that: [...] "It's {{great to see}} Disney returning to its roots and blooming anew: creating superior musical entertainment that draws on the Walt [...] tradition of animation splendor and the verve of Broadway present." [...] Richard Roeper wrote that the film was an [...] "absolute delight from start to finish." [...] Both Michael Phillips of Chicago Tribune and Stephen Holden of The New York Times praised the film's characters and musical sequences, which also drew comparisons to the theatrics found in Wicked. Emma Dibdin of Digital Spy awarded the film five out of five stars and called the film [...] "a new Disney classic" [...] and [...] "an exhilarating, joyous, human story that's as frequently laugh-out-loud funny as it is startling and daring and poignant. Hot {{on the heels of}} the 90th anniversary, it's impossible to imagine a more perfect celebration of everything Disney is at its best." [...] Frozen was also praised in Norwegian Sámi media as showcasing Sámi culture to a broad audience in a good way. Composer Frode Fjellheim was lauded by Norwegian Sámi President Aili Keskitalo for his contributions to the film, during the President's 2014 New Year's speech.|$|E

2500|$|This melancholy song has {{fairly simple}} lyrics. Journalist Benoît Cachin {{said in this}} song, [...] "Farmer pays tribute to the words which have enabled her to write her songs, which are also used to express her love". About the song, French {{magazine}} Instant-mag made the following analysis: [...] "On an air melody and worthy flights of Boutonnat, the two voices, paradoxical but complementary, tell us the difficulty communicating and the immense power of words. Where the beautiful voice of Farmer will force up to the break, that of Seal evokes a quiet and sensual strength". One of the verses of [...] "Les Mots" [...] ("And to lives that stoop to notice mine", sung by Seal) resumed the first verse of the Farmer's song [...] "Nous souviendrons-nous" [...] ("Aux vies qui s'abaissent à voir la mienne") which is on her third studio album L'Autre.... The work by Emily Dickinson was also {{a source of inspiration}} for the song. Indeed, the phrase [...] "I will tell <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> sun rose", sung by Seal, is the title of her poem No. 318.|$|E
2500|$|Residents {{agreed to}} a strict code of conduct. They {{surrendered}} all personal possessions to the group, which provided food, clothing, and shelter. The rules also forbade consumption of alcohol and tobacco. Although the colony raised chickens in the beginning, eating any meat except fish was later prohibited. Ogden even said they must stop planting gardens, {{but they were still}} permitted to hire out as laborers to local farmers. Ogden received instructions for the settlement through her typewriter as well as in revelatory trips to the top of nearby Shay Mountain. She taught from the Aquarian Gospel and other theosophical works. Her doctrines included reincarnation, communication with the dead, and asceticism. It is said that she claimed to be the reincarnated Virgin Mary, identifying other group members as reincarnations of Brigham Young and the prophet Nathan. However, this was only reported by newspapers and never verified by credible sources from within the commune. Ogden also handled the colony's financial matters. In 1934, she purchased the local newspaper, the San Juan Record, made herself editor, and added a column in which she promoted her metaphysical ideas. In her first column of “Metaphysical Truths”, printed May 24, 1934, she describes metaphysics as [...] "that division of philosophy which relates to the science of being and to the hidden, or unseen things, which pertain to our spiritual rather than our material, or physical being which we KNOW because we are more conscious of the physical senses we have allowed to predominate. It also embraces that which tells <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> Universe came to being, what composes the Universe, and how life started to manifest on it. As one writer states: 'It's the science of exploring the Universe outside of the Finite.'" [...] Additionally, a column called the “Dry Valley News” gave a summary of the goings-on at Home of Truth. She used the press to print pamphlets about her beliefs to distribute out as well.|$|E
