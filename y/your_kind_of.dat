500|$|Vig {{recalled}} that the title [...] "Not <b>Your</b> <b>Kind</b> <b>of</b> People" [...] {{came to him}} when he was stuck in a traffic jam in Los Angeles; he texted Manson the idea for a title and she loved it. Manson wrote all the lyrics that night, and the next day the four of them gathered with acoustic guitars and wrote the music to the song in about half an hour. Manson explained that the album title Not <b>Your</b> <b>Kind</b> <b>of</b> People was [...] "a call to arms in a way to anyone who feels like we do about the world", saying that [...] "it can be great to be outsider." [...] She felt that this applied to them as the band [...] "never fit into a music scene" [...] and that [...] "in my life I've never been an insider." [...] Manson also described the title as [...] "a two-fingered salute to people who reject or criticize us", stating the band was [...] "only really interested in people who share our outlook" [...] as she considered that their fans were [...] "the people who connect with what you're saying and how you say it." ...|$|E
500|$|Recorded {{mostly at}} various {{recording}} studios in California, Not <b>Your</b> <b>Kind</b> <b>of</b> People {{was produced by}} Garbage, and was engineered and mixed by Billy Bush.

500|$|The band {{recorded}} {{the theme song}} of the 1999 James Bond film The World Is Not Enough. The band's third album, Beautiful Garbage (2001), failed to match the commercial success achieved by its predecessors. Garbage quietly disbanded in late 2003, but regrouped to complete their fourth album Bleed Like Me in 2005, peaking at a career-high number four on the Billboard 200. The band cut short their concert tour in support of Bleed Like Me announcing an [...] "indefinite hiatus". Garbage reconvened in 2007 and released a greatest hits compilation Absolute Garbage. The band's fifth studio album, Not <b>Your</b> <b>Kind</b> <b>of</b> People, was released on 14 May 2012 through the band's own label, Stunvolume.|$|E

500|$|Garbage {{later said}} that the album was {{released}} as a contractual obligation to Warner Music: [...] "This was the final straw that broke our backs", recalled Manson five years later. [...] "The record company we had been sold to in the U.K. demanded that we release a [...] "greatest hits" [...] {{in order to meet}} their quarterly requirements. We were {{not in a position to}} stop it. As a result, they shoved this collection out with no promotion whatsoever. It was right there and then that we realized how crazy and out of whack things had gotten." [...] Garbage remained on hiatus for a further three years until regrouping to record their fifth studio album, Not <b>Your</b> <b>Kind</b> <b>of</b> People, released in 2012.|$|E
500|$|In late 2011, Garbage {{announced}} {{their return to}} touring upon the release of Not <b>Your</b> <b>Kind</b> <b>of</b> People, marking the band's first live performances since 2007, and their first tour since 2005. [...] "Thinking about going {{back on the road}} is both thrilling and terrifying in equal measure," [...] Manson stated, [...] "...but we've always enjoyed a little pain mixed in with our pleasure." [...] Manson considered that self-reflection helped change the way the group approached touring, and, as a result, [...] "we're playing the best shows of our career." [...] Eric Avery, who performed with the band during their Bleed Like Me tour, rejoined them as the tour bassist. The band played concerts throughout North and South America, Europe, Oceania and Asia.|$|E
500|$|Not <b>Your</b> <b>Kind</b> <b>of</b> People is {{the fifth}} studio album by Scottish-American {{alternative}} rock band Garbage. It was released on May 11, 2012 through the band's own record label, Stunvolume. The album marks {{the return of the}} band after a seven-year hiatus that started with previous album Bleed Like Me. Guitarist Duke Erikson said at the launch of the record that [...] "working with Garbage again was very instinctual. Like getting on a bicycle...with three other people." [...] The band emphasized that {{they did not want to}} reinvent themselves, but embrace their sonic identity, reflecting their classic sound whilst updating it for 2012. Although Shirley Manson's morose dispositions have a presence on the record, many of the songs share a more optimistic outlook on life, influenced by some of Manson's personal experiences during their hiatus.|$|E

5000|$|... "Make <b>Your</b> Own <b>Kind</b> <b>of</b> Music" [...] is a pop song {{written by}} Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil, first {{recorded}} in 1968 by the New York City-based trio the Will-O-Bees (Janet Blossom, Steven Porter, and Robert Merchanthouse), who regularly performed Mann/Weil compositions. After Cass Elliot {{had a hit}} {{in the summer of}} 1969 with Mann/Weil's [...] "It's Getting Better", she recorded [...] "Make <b>Your</b> Own <b>Kind</b> <b>of</b> Music" [...] as the follow-up single, and her album Bubblegum, Lemonade, and... Something for Mama was re-released as [...] "Make <b>Your</b> Own <b>Kind</b> <b>Of</b> Music/It's Getting Better," [...] the title cut having been added to the original track listing. However, Elliot's [...] "Make <b>Your</b> Own <b>Kind</b> <b>of</b> Music" [...] single only just reached the Top 40 at #36. The similar chart impact of the follow-up single, another Mann/Weil composition entitled [...] "New World Coming," [...] which reached #42, signaled Elliot's challenges in maintaining a profile as a current hitmaker, as the 1960s turned into the 1970s. The Cass Elliot track is in the key of E major.|$|R
500|$|Not <b>Your</b> <b>Kind</b> <b>of</b> People {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, it received a weighted average score of 63 based on 28 reviews, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews". In his review for The Guardian, Dave Simpson gave the album {{four out of}} five stars, stating that it [...] "returns to the blueprint of their first two, best albums" [...] while lessening the electronics and augmenting the crunchy guitars, with a contemporary production. He praised the title track, deeming it a [...] "surprise" [...] and a [...] "beautiful, otherworldly cross between a John Barry Bond theme and a David Bowie outsider anthem." [...] Cameron Adams of The Courier-Mail wrote that [...] "musically, they still find that sweet spot between Motown and Nirvana, via the Pretenders and Prodigy", and considered it [...] "refreshing" [...] that the band is [...] "still pushing pop music to its darkest limits." ...|$|E
500|$|Unlike the {{previous}} albums, which were done at Vig's Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin, Not <b>Your</b> <b>Kind</b> <b>of</b> People was mostly recorded in Los Angeles, where both Vig and Manson live. Smart was only used {{for some of}} [...] Erikson's parts, as {{he was the only}} bandmember still in Wisconsin. The working process was also different; while {{the previous}} records had the band gathering for an entire year at Smart Studios, the band would instead work two weeks per month in Los Angeles, with Erikson and Marker flying in from Wisconsin and Colorado, respectively, then spend another two weeks in their home studios while e-mailing ideas back and forth to develop songs. Manson would also visit Vig's GrungeIsDead studio to experiment with vocals. Then they would get back together in the studio, which according to Marker [...] "would be fun again because we hadn't seen these people for a couple of weeks." ...|$|E
500|$|Toby Creswell {{argues that}} the [...] "Sex Pistols' agenda was inchoate, to say the least. It was a general call to {{rebellion}} that falls apart at the slightest scrutiny." [...] Critic Ian Birch, writing in 1981, called [...] "stupid" [...] {{the claim that the}} Sex Pistols [...] "had any political significance.... If they did anything, they made a lot of people content with being nothing. They certainly didn't inspire the working classes." [...] While the Conservative triumph in 1979 may be taken as evidence for that position, Julien Temple has noted that the scene inspired by the Sex Pistols [...] "wasn't <b>your</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> two-up, two-down working class normal families, most of it. It was {{over the edge of the}} precipice in social terms. They were actually giving a voice to an area of the working class that was almost beyond the pale." [...] Within a year of [...] "Anarchy in the U.K." [...] that voice was being echoed widely: scores if not hundreds of punk bands had formed across the country‚Äîgroups composed largely of working-class members or middle-class members who rejected their own class values and pursued solidarity with the working class.|$|E

500|$|According to Vig, Not <b>Your</b> <b>Kind</b> <b>of</b> People evokes ambient vibes of Garbage's {{first two}} albums, Garbage and Version 2.0: [...] "There's lots of {{elements}} of things we've always loved: noisy guitars, big electronic beats, atmospheric film moments", {{adding that the}} band [...] "wanted to make a record sound like something {{that we want to}} hear when we're driving the car." [...] While the record was reminiscent [...] "vibe-wise" [...] of the band's early work, the production aimed for a rawer sound, instead of cleaning up the sound through computers, to [...] "capture a performance" [...] and [...] "sound kind of trashy and for the songs to blow out a little bit." [...] Vig said, [...] "we tried to leave a lot of the performance raw on this album. A lot of the songs, we sort of throw paint at the wall and some of it sticks and some of it drips off." [...] He explained that the group avoided reinventing themselves: [...] "We wanted to just embrace exactly who we are and what we like to do and just sort of update it sonically for 2012. For better or worse, when we approach a song, it's going to end up sounding like Garbage. I think we have a strong sonic identity, and I think that's an asset these days." [...] Manson similarly noted that what mattered most was the record sounding authentic to who they are as a band. Manson considered that while the record recalled the band's classic sound [...] "it fits in with radio programming right now"; She said that they are interested in also reaching a new generation and, regarding their distinct sound, [...] "We don't sound like anyone else on the radio. Much to our surprise there hasn't been another band like ours since we came off the road." ...|$|E
