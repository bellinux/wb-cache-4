Alternative Press called it [...] "an undeniable hip-hop masterpiece" [...] showing [...] "DJ Shadow remembers that sampling is an art form", while David Bennun from The Guardian said the record was [...] "not only one of the most daring and original albums of recent times, but also one of the loveliest." [...] In Playboy, Robert Christgau claimed that while listeners unfamiliar with its style of music would not find the tracks as powerful, [...] "they are so rich and eclectic, and spun out with such a sense of flow, that this album establishes the kind of convincing aural reality other British techno experimenters only fantasize about." [...] Tom Wilkes of Melody Maker wrote: [...] "The album flips hip hop inside out all over again like a reversible glove, and again, and again, and each time it's sudden and new. I am, I confess, totally confounded by it. I hear a lot of good records, but very few impossible ones... <b>You</b> <b>need</b> <b>this</b> record. You are incomplete without it." [...] Author and rock critic Greil Marcus published a glowing review of the album in his [...] "Real Life Rock Top Ten" [...] column for Interview, where he called it [...] "absolutely modern – which is to say ambient-dreamy and techno-abstract" [...] and [...] "quite brilliant throughout".|$|E

[...] "Get a good one," [...] advises Aunt Charlotte; [...] "one that will last." [...] You do--and it does last. It lasts like a family curse. These great plain valuable things, as plain as good women, as complacently assured of their intrinsic worth--who does not know them? My Aunt Charlotte scarcely had a new thing in her life. Her mahogany was avuncular; her china remotely ancestral; her feather beds and her bedsteads!--they were haunted; the births, marriages, and deaths associated with the best one was {{the history of our}} race for three generations. There was more in her house than the tombstone rectitude of the chair-backs to remind me of the graveyard. I can still remember the sombre aisles of that house, the vault-like shadows, the magnificent window curtains that blotted out the windows. Life was too trivial for such things. She never knew she tired of them, but she did. That was the secret of her temper, I think; they engendered her sombre Calvinism, her perception of the trashy quality of human life. The pretence that they were the accessories to human life was too transparent. We were the accessories; we minded them for a little while, and then we passed away. They wore us out and cast us aside. We were the changing scenery; they were the actors who played on through the piece. It was even so with clothing. We buried my other maternal aunt--Aunt Adelaide--and wept, and partly forgot her; but her wonderful silk dresses--they would stand alone--still went rustling cheerfully about an ephemeral world.|$|E

Since then, Culture Kiosks were put up in Athens, Sion, New York City, Havana, Yerevan, Lisbon, São Paulo, Dunkirk, Milan and Geneva. The artists’ most egocentric dream would be that in 20 years, one speaks of the Culture Kiosk like of a table, a chair, or just some usual everyday object.|$|E
