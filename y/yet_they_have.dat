5|$|Cliff (Bill Cosby) {{comes home}} from a long day at work and tries to take a nap. Vanessa (Tempestt Bledsoe) {{disturbs}} him to say that Rudy's (Keshia Knight Pulliam) goldfish, Lamont, has died, {{but she does not}} realize it <b>yet.</b> <b>They</b> <b>have</b> a hard time explaining to Rudy what has happened. Once they do, Rudy becomes depressed. Later that day, the older kids start making fun of Lamont's death, Theo saying they should hold a memorial service for the fish around the family toilet. When Cliff feels {{that the rest of the}} family is insensitive to Rudy's loss, he requires the entire family to participate in a memorial service for Lamont in the bathroom in proper funeral attire. Rudy loses interest in the funeral and leaves to watch television, ending the ceremony abruptly. She later returns to the bathroom and asks for privacy, not because she wants to say goodbye to Lamont as Cliff thinks, but because she needs to use the toilet.|$|E

25|$|Guam's 173,000 {{residents}} are U.S. citizens, and must obey U.S. laws passed in Washington, <b>yet</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> neither a voting member of Congress, nor {{votes in the}} Electoral College. Since 1980, they have held a straw poll for president {{at the same time}} as the U.S. national elections. In 2007, Guam's legislature voted to move the straw poll up to September to draw attention to the choices of Guam's population and their continued disfranchisement, but the governor vetoed the bill. Obama won the 2008 Guam straw poll with 20,120 votes to McCain's 11,940.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after Masters and Johnson {{published}} their book, several scholars criticized {{their model}} of the human sexual response cycle. For example, Helen Singer Kaplan argued that Masters and Johnson only evaluated sexual response from a physiological perspective, and that psychological, emotional, and cognitive factors {{need to be taken}} into consideration. As a result, she proposed her {{model of the}} sexual response cycle which includes three phases: desire, excitement, and orgasm. She argues that these three phases are interconnected, <b>yet</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> different neurophysiological mechanisms. Similarly, Paul Robinson argued that the excitement and plateau phases are the same; he criticizes Masters and Johnson's work for not clearly distinguishing when the excitement phase ends, and when the plateau phase begins.|$|E
25|$|Much {{consolidation}} {{occurred in}} the financial services industry since, {{but not at the}} scale some had expected. Retail banks, for example, do not tend to buy insurance underwriters, as they seek to engage in a more profitable business of insurance brokerage by selling products of other insurance companies. Other retail banks were slow to market investments and insurance products and package those products in a convincing way. Brokerage companies had a hard time getting into banking, because {{they do not have a}} large branch and backshop footprint. Banks have recently tended to buy other banks, such as the 2004 Bank of America and Fleet Boston merger, <b>yet</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> had less success integrating with investment and insurance companies. Many banks have expanded into investment banking, but have found it hard to package it with their banking services, without resorting to questionable tie-ins which caused scandals at Smith Barney.|$|E
60|$|Tom and Sam {{saw that}} he was angry, <b>yet</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> to roar at the scene presented. They {{wondered}} what Aleck would say when he got back to the farm.|$|R

25|$|To perform artisanal logging, the logger {{needs to}} obtain permit {{from the local}} government. With {{approval}} by the community chief, loggers can obtain a permit; <b>yet,</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> to report the harvest to local forestry technicians. These local forestry offices are considered the appropriate entity for approving the logging permits while {{they do not have}} the capacity to conduct forest inventory and forest mapping. Since the forest code does not have comprehensive mechanism to stop such logging activities, loggers continue to purchase logging rights from the local community. Depending on the scale of the logging, the community would demand different types of payment from loggers. One community in the North Kivu area, they demanded the logger to give them a 4x4 truck and upgrade the public infrastructures, which are not well provided for by the local government. Although the logger did not accept the request, this illustrates why locals want artisanal logging to exist.|$|E
500|$|... "The Walk" [...] is {{the first}} X-Files script by John Shiban. He found it {{challenging}} to write, particularly Mulder and Scully's first scene where [...] "they have to come together on a case, <b>yet</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> to be at odds". [...] Shiban {{was inspired by the}} film The Men and realizing that the main character, who had been injured in war and lost his legs, wanted to walk more than anything. He stated that the paranormal concept of astral projection [...] "just sort of fit". Some members of the writing staff were concerned about killing Callahan's young son, Trevor, but Shiban was not bothered by it and felt that Rappo wanted to take everything from Callahan, and the worst blow would be to kill his son.|$|E
500|$|RZ Gruis is {{a binary}} system of {{apparent}} magnitude 12.3 with occasional dimming to 13.4, whose components—a white dwarf and main sequence star—are thought to orbit each other roughly every 8.5 to 10 [...] hours. It {{belongs to the}} UX Ursae Majoris subgroup of cataclysmic variable star systems, where material from the donor star is drawn to the white dwarf where it forms an accretion disc that remains bright and outshines the two component stars. The system is poorly understood, though the donor star has been calculated to be of spectral type F5V. These stars have spectra very similar to novae that have returned to quiescence after outbursts, <b>yet</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> not been observed to have erupted themselves. The American Association of Variable Star Observers recommends watching them for future events. CE Gruis (also known as Grus V-1) is a faint (magnitude 18–21) star system also composed of a white dwarf and donor star; {{in this case the}} two are so close they are tidally locked. Known as polars, material from the donor star does not form an accretion disc around the white dwarf, but rather streams directly onto it.|$|E
5000|$|Wartislaw II was {{a son of}} Bogislaw I, duke of Pomerania-Stettin and {{his first}} wife Walburga of Denmark. He was married to Sophia of Poland, <b>yet</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> no children. Wartislaw {{received}} Pomerania-Demmin after Casimir I of Pomerania-Demmin died in 1180.|$|R
60|$|The girls {{received}} this statement sullenly, <b>yet</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> no logical reply to controvert it. So Mary Louise, feeling that her {{explanation of the}} distasteful edict was not popular with her friends, quietly rose and sauntered to the gate, on her way home.|$|R
50|$|The first {{microcomputers}} {{were quite}} simple. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> a few kilobytes {{of memory and}} couldn't run large programs. Many didn't even have an operating system. <b>Yet</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> something valuable: understanding everything about their hardware and software was easy. simpleJ aims to make this possible while running on modern PC hardware.|$|R

2500|$|In {{a further}} letter of September 1975, Wallace writes that MI5 was backing {{a group of}} UVF hardliners who opposed the UVF's move toward politics. He adds:I believe much of the {{violence}} generated during {{the latter part of}} last year was caused by some of the new [...] people deliberately stirring up the conflict. As you know, we have never been allowed to target the breakaway UVF, nor the UFF, during the past year. <b>Yet</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> killed more people than the IRA! ...|$|E

50|$|It is {{said that}} the most {{powerful}} of Morgoth's servants, Balrogs, were the spirits of the same kind as Arien, <b>yet</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> been seduced by the Dark Lord. The Maia Olórin is also frequently associated with fire. Nothing is known about the other fiery spirits.|$|R

50|$|Blumberg's {{association}} with traditional right-wing middle class ideology, coupled with his demands and denunciations, have {{caused him to}} become unpopular {{in the eyes of}} many Argentines.

50|$|As Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was {{the face}} of {{integration}} {{during the civil rights}} movement, Malcolm X represented nationalism.

50|$|The Chinese {{authorities}} took {{little interest}} in these sects, since, {{at least until the}} early 20th century, they limited their activities to their temples.
