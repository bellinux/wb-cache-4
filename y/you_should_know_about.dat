You know that the Spaniards obtained their possessions in South America partly by right of discovery, and partly by the papal bull that settled the matter. The Portuguese were given the east coast, while to Spain were handed, besides the islands, the vast territories of Mexico and Central America and the whole of the western portion of South America. In extent it considerably surpassed that of Europe, and its natural wealth, had it been properly administered, would have been fabulous. The Spaniards, however, thought but of two things: one was to force the natives to embrace their religion, the other to wring all they possessed from them. The first caused the death of great numbers of the Indians; the second brought about the virtual enslavement of the whole of the native races.|$|R
5000|$|Brian Campbell of Starpulse opines that [...] "by {{the end of}} the {{tremendous}} opening track [...] "Life After Anger", <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>know</b> just <b>about</b> all <b>you</b> need to <b>know</b> <b>about</b> Emphatic’s Another Life. Chunky riffs, soaring vocals, and melodic hooks all coated in a glossy, radio ready sheen". However, in Campbell's opinion the album [...] "is plagued by more than a few flat filler tracks, instances in which the band wanders too far into middle-of-the-road hard rock". Also Eric May of New Noise notes the [...] "thundering chorus" [...] and radio potential of [...] "Life After Anger", and reminds his readers that [...] "if you can't get enough of pop-laden hard rock with catchy hooks and memorable choruses, then you might want to get your hands on this album." [...] Hart of Rock Relapse is less enthusiastic, stating that aside from the change {{at the head of the}} band, there's nothing alarmingly new about Emphatic's typical hard rock offerings: [...] "If you’ve heard one Emphatic song, you’ve heard them all".|$|R

2500|$|Ianulea's {{only option}} is to flee Bucharest in a haste and escape his creditors. As he rides past Cuțitul de Argint Church, he notices that he is being pursued by armed guards, sent by the Bucharest Aga to lock him into a debtors' prison. He {{abandons}} his horse and runs up a hill and into a vineyard, pleading with the keeper to provide him with shelter. The latter, who presents himself as Negoiță, reluctantly accepts to do so when Ianulea assures him that his pursuers are not boyars. In exchange for his help, Ianulea lets him on his secret identity, and promises to reward him. He explains: [...] "Whenever you hear that the devil's got into a woman, a wife, or a girl, whatever, {{no matter the place}} where they live and no matter what station in life they have, <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>know</b> it's <b>about</b> me that they're talking.

But, when my father signed that will, {{it was just after}} one of those fits he had lately; that could be proved, and he didn't know what he was doing, from Adam! He didn't know what was in the will, nor, that he was signing a will at all; so help me, he didn't. However, that's over.

40|$|When {{you think}} about the St. Joseph River and its tributaries, what's your vision? A {{peaceful}} way to spend an afternoon canoeing? A muddy brown catchall for the area's pollut-ants? A haven for wildlife, like bald eagles and endangered mussels? In fact, the St. Joseph River is all of these [...] and the primary source of water for over 250, 000 peo-ple. Few natural resources mean as much to you and your family as this river, so we think <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>know</b> more <b>about</b> what's in it and what the St. Joseph River Watershed Initiative is doing to make our river healthier. Since 1996, the St. Joseph River Watershed Initiative (SJRWI) has been working on your behalf to protect and improve water quality in the St. Joseph River. We have spent countless hours monitor-ing the quality of the water, conducting education and outreach events, producing and distributing educational materials, studying current conditions in the watershed, and planning for the future. Great strides have been made in understanding and treating water quality concerns. We have iden-tified pollutants of concern and know their sources, identified critical areas where conservation measures are needed, used grant money to install conservation measures, and organized stake-holders to work together to create Watershed Management Plans...|$|R
5000|$|While at Liberty Baptist Theological Seminary, Brewer studied church growth under Dr. Elmer Towns, who has {{authored}} numerous {{books on}} the subject of church growth. Towns wrote the foreword to Brewer's book Postmodernism: What <b>You</b> <b>Should</b> <b>Know</b> & Do <b>About</b> It. Upon completion of his doctorate, Brewer regularly spoke at Christian conferences regarding the implications of Postmodernism upon the North American church and how outreach and evangelistic methodologies could and should adjust for the transition of eras (i.e., Modern to Postmodern). [...] Prior to becoming the Lead Pastor of North Chapel Fountain Hills, Arizona, he served on the pastoral staff of two megachurches in Scottsdale, Arizona; Scottsdale Bible Church, and Hillsong Phoenix. Brewer was a founding team member for an extreme sports ministry founded by actor Stephen Baldwin and D'Ortenzio but restructured as [...] "Death to Life Revolution" [...] ministry.|$|R
25|$|Since I am anxious that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> all <b>know</b> {{something}} <b>about</b> my {{trip and}} {{the condition of}} the country as we find it in British East Africa, I am sending this general letter. I have had my first visit to a native village where goats, sheep and human beings occupy the same hut. The houses are built of bamboo and thatched with grass; the center or highest point is about ten feet, sloping to the outer edge until the door or hole to crawl through is about three feet high.... The chief occupation for the men is herding goats; the women do the gardening, wood chopping, carrying of heavy loads, etc. The women carried all our trunks and baggage from the depot up to the mission station, a distance of about three miles. It is considered a disgrace for a man to carry a load of wood, pail of water, etc.|$|R

6000|$|The reader may as {{well know}} at once that rumours {{prejudicial}} to the Askertons reached Belton before they had been established there for six months. At Taunton, which was twenty miles distant, these rumours were very rife, and there were people there who knew with accuracy,--though, probably without a grain of truth in their accuracy,--every detail {{in the history of}} Mrs. Askerton's life. And something, too, reached Clara's ears--something from old Mr. Wright, the rector, who loved scandal, and was very ill-natured. [...] "A very nice woman," [...] the rector had said; [...] "but she {{does not seem to have}} any belongings in particular." [...] "She has got a husband," [...] Clara had replied with some little indignation, for she had never loved Mr. Wright. [...] "Yes; I suppose she has got a husband." [...] Then Clara had, in her own judgment, accused the rector of lying, evil-speaking, and slandering, and had increased the measure of her cordiality to Mrs. Askerton. But something more she had heard on the same subject at Perivale. [...] "Before you throw yourself into close intimacy with the lady, I think <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>know</b> something <b>about</b> her," [...] Mrs. Winterfield had said to her. [...] "I do <b>know</b> something <b>about</b> her; I <b>know</b> that she has the manners and education of a lady, and that she is living affectionately with her husband, who is devoted to her. What more ought I to know?" [...] "If you really do know all that, you know a great deal," [...] Mrs. Winterfield had replied.|$|R

What can you <b>know</b> <b>about</b> the people who pass your time at London clubs or in fine country houses? I suppose you want the people to live as they do at a house dinner at Boodle's. I say that a family can live very well on seven shillings a-week, and on eight shillings very well indeed. The poor are very well off, at least the {{agricultural}} poor, very well off indeed. Their incomes are certain, {{that is a great}} point, and they have no cares, no anxieties; they always have a resource, they always have the House. People without cares do not require as much food as those whose life entails anxieties. See how long they live! Compare the rate of mortality among them with that of the manufacturing districts. Incendiarism indeed! If there had been a proper rural police, such a thing as incendiarism would never have been heard of!" ...|$|R

"Men," [...] he said, [...] "I {{dare say}} there is some wonderment among you, in finding yourselves so strong a crew, and at seeing the Swan so well {{provided}} with guns, and with all other necessaries. You will learn, in good time, all about it; but at present it is best, for many reasons, that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>know</b> nothing <b>about</b> the matter. We may be overhauled by a king's ship; we may meet with foul weather, and have to put back into port; and a loose tongue might do us grievous damage. It is {{enough for you to}} know that where the ship is going you are going; that she is stored with provisions of such quality as was never put on board a trader before; that everything will be done for your comfort. As to myself, I am content to know that I have a crew of eighty-five stout Devonshire lads under me, and that we can give an account of ourselves, whosoever may meet us. Those who have sailed with me before know that I do my best for my men, {{that there will be no}} harsh words or violence on board this ship, save they are well merited. Discipline, order, and obedience I will have, and that strictly. Above all, I will have no grumbling. A grumbling crew is a useless crew, and a sick crew; while a cheerful crew can meet, with confidence, whatever befalls them; but I think not that I have any grumblers on board, since every man has been carefully chosen. A merry heart goes all the way, as the saying has it, and I want this crew to be a happy one.|$|R
