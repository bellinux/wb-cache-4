500|$|Zvi Lederman, {{the other}} {{co-director of the}} dig, {{believes}} that Beth Shemesh was a cultural meeting point {{on the border of}} Israelite, Canaanite, and Philistine areas and calls the stories of Samson [...] "border sagas", noting that Samson could cross boundaries to seek out a Philistine wife, but also to fight and kill Philistines: [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>cross</b> the border, you have to fight the enemy and you encounter dangerous animals. You meet bad things. These are stories of contact and conflict, of a border that is more cultural than political." [...] According to Haaretz, [...] "excavation directors Prof. Shlomo Bunimovitz and Dr. Zvi Lederman of Tel Aviv University say they do not suggest that the human figure on the seal is the biblical Samson. Rather, the geographical proximity to the area where Samson lived, and the time period of the seal, show that a story was being told at the time of a hero who fought a lion, and that the story eventually found its way into the biblical text and onto the seal." ...|$|E
500|$|Half of {{the first}} day's footage came out {{overexposed}} and unusable. Before the financiers or studio bosses knew about the problem, Soderbergh was already doing reshoots. The insurers made him agree that any further mishaps resulting in additional filming {{would come out of}} the director's own pocket. Soderbergh shot in various cities in California, Ohio and Texas, on a 54-day schedule and came in $2 million under budget. The director operated the camera himself in an effort to [...] "get as close to the movie as I can," [...] and to eliminate the distance between the actors and himself. Soderbergh drew inspiration from the cinema verite style of Ken Loach's films, studying the framing of scenes, the distance of the camera to the actors, lens length, and the tightness of eyelines depending on the position of a character. Soderbergh remembers, [...] "I noticed that there's a space that's inviolate, that if you get within something, <b>you</b> <b>cross</b> the edge into a more theatrical aesthetic as opposed to a documentary aesthetic". Most of the day was spent shooting {{because a lot of the}} film was shot with available light.|$|E

Jackson said of this: [...] "Instead of being known for my {{basketball}} skills, all of these nudie shots are always the first thing you see." [...] She posed nude in an Australian magazine, Black+White, that featured Olympic athletes who were set to compete in Athens in the 2004 Summer Olympics. The expensively printed magazine/book has been produced for the last three Olympic Games and, by the 2004 edition, was considered uncontroversial in Australia with its [...] "artistic" [...] approach to nude photography, and its equal coverage of male and female athletes, although it did create a stir in the United States. She also posed for the 2005 edition of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue. Of posing nude, she said, [...] "if offered the opportunity, I think that it's a personal decision. Whether you do it for the money or whatever, again, I think it's a personal decision. I don't know whether I would say yes or no. I guess <b>you</b> <b>cross</b> that bridge when you come to it.

500|$|A University of Houston professor, Peter Nguyen, remarked in 2005, [...] "You almost get a {{different}} sense of feeling once <b>you</b> <b>cross</b> over to Bellaire." [...] Bellaire is an incorporated city consisting of single-family houses and a reputation for safety. Nguyen said that he believed the city should increase efforts to reduce crime in Gulfton. He added {{that it would be}} difficult to engage Gulfton's population of [...] "working people", living [...] "day to day", to participate in anti-crime activities like crime watches. Bruce Williams, a Houston Police Department Captain, states that it is difficult to fight crime with the reductions in manpower. Williams said that U.S. federal government agents began working with the Houston Police Department to arrest serious gang criminals in Gulfton, including Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) members who were operating in the neighborhood. In 2007, Tammy Rodriguez, head of the Gulfton Super Neighborhood department for the City of Houston, and the Fondren Patrol Division announced that the division would expand its Police Apartments Clergy Team (PACT) into three Gulfton complexes. PACT places married couples who are active in churches into the apartment complexes so they can work with tenants. The PACT program initially focused on the Napoleon Square and Chateaux Carmel complexes. In August 2009 a gang war erupted between the Southwest Cholos and other area gangs causing violence to increase in Gulfton and surrounding areas.|$|E
500|$|Unlike Angie, Den's first wife, Chrissie [...] "has {{a strong}} will and fights {{for what she}} wants". However, as Oberman noted, [...] "there is enough of Angie in Chrissie to see that Den likes {{a certain type of}} strong woman. Chrissie is Angie with 15 years of {{feminism}} behind her", explaining in an interview with Radio 4: [...] "I like to think of Chrissie as Angie with benefits... She's his [...] equal a bit more than Angie was." [...] Oberman later expanded: [...] "Chrissie, unlike Angie, won't hit the bottle as soon as Den starts playing away. She's proved she's ready to sit and wait for her revenge. She's a great, strong character". Talking to the Daily Mirror shortly after appearing on-screen {{for the first time in}} April, Oberman declared, [...] "Chrissie is the sort of woman I'd really like to be friends with... She's an Essex girl who was brought up in a family of brothers, so she knows how to work men. She understands that what they say is not always what they mean." [...] In her official character profile, Chrissie is portrayed as someone [...] "happy to play mind games" [...] and [...] "often two steps ahead of her husband", being described as [...] "the type of person to be your best friend. But if <b>you</b> <b>cross</b> her, she'll get her own back in the end." [...] Her strong-willed persona has led reviewers to label the character as [...] "venomous", [...] "sinister" [...] "devious", and [...] "hard as nails" [...] in [...] "the grand tradition of landladies of the Queen Vic", manipulating others to ensure matters go her way. As the [...] "scheming" [...] figure of the show, she was described as a [...] "witch" [...] and [...] "super-bitch", but was also represented as [...] "strong" [...] and [...] "clever" [...] woman. Executive producer Kate Harwood characterised Chrissie as a survivor, someone who [...] "thinks on her feet" [...] whatever the situation. Oberman has stated that she was thrilled to be [...] "playing such a strong female character", whom she described as not a bad person at heart but one willing to stand and [...] "fight in her corner".|$|E

2500|$|In June of that year, Romania {{joined the}} attack on the Soviet Union, led by Germany in {{coalition}} with Hungary, Finland, the State of Slovakia, the Kingdom of Italy and the Independent State of Croatia. Antonescu had been made aware of the plan by German envoys, and supported it enthusiastically even before Hitler extended Romania an offer to participate. On 18 June 1941, Antonescu gave orders to his generals about [...] "cleansing the ground" [...] of Jews when Romanian forces entered Bessarabia and Bukovina. Right from the start, Antonescu proclaimed the war against the Soviet Union to be a [...] "holy war", a [...] "crusade" [...] in the name of Eastern Orthodox faith and the Romanian race against the forces of [...] "Judo-Bolshevism". The propaganda of the Antonescu regime demonized everything Jewish as Antonescu believed that Communism was invented by the Jews, and all of the Soviet leaders were really Jews. Reflecting Antonescu's anti-Slavic feelings, {{despite the fact that the}} war was billed as a [...] "crusade" [...] in defense of Orthodoxy against [...] "Judeo-Bolshevism", the war was not presented as a struggle to liberate the Orthodox Russians and Ukrainians from Communism; instead rule by [...] "Judeo-Bolshevism" [...] was portrayed as something brought about the innate moral inferiority of the Slavs, who thus needed to be ruled by the Germans and the Romanians. The Romanian force engaged formed a General Antonescu Army Group under the effective command of German general Eugen Ritter von Schobert. Romania's campaign on the Eastern Front began without a formal declaration of war, and was consecrated by Antonescu's statement: [...] "Soldiers, I order <b>you,</b> <b>cross</b> the Prut River" [...] (in reference to the Bessarabian border between Romania and post-1940 Soviet territory). A few days after this, a large-scale pogrom was carried out in Iași with Antonescu's agreement; thousands of Jews were killed in the bloody Iași pogrom. Antonescu had followed a generation of younger right-wing Romanian intellectuals led by Corneliu Zelea Codreanu who in the 1920s-30s had rejected the traditional Francophila of the Romanian elites and their adherence to Western notions of universal democratic values and human rights. Antonescu made it clear that his regime rejected the moral principles of the [...] "demo-liberal world" [...] and he saw the war as an ideological struggle between his spiritually pure [...] "national-totalitarian regime" [...] vs. [...] "Jewish morality". Antonescu believed that the liberal humanist-democratic-capitalist values of the West and Communism were both invented by the Jews to destroy Romania. In a lengthy speech just before the war, Antonescu attacked democracy in the most violent terms as it allowed Jews equal rights and thus to undercut the Romanian [...] "national idea". As such, Antonescu stated what was needed was a [...] "new man" [...] who would be [...] "tough", [...] "virile" [...] and willing to fight for an ethnically and religiously [...] "pure" [...] Romania. Despite his quarrel with Sima, much of Antonescu's speech clearly reflected the influence of the ideas of the Iron Guard that Antonescu had absorbed in the 1930s. Antonescu's anti-Semitism and sexism went so far that he tacitly condoned the rape of Jewish women and girls in Bessarabia and northern Bukovinia by his forces under the grounds that he was going take away all of the property that the Jews had [...] "stolen" [...] from the Romanians, and as far he was concerned, Jewish females were just another piece of property. Since the Jewish women were going to exterminated anyway, Antonescu felt there was nothing wrong about letting his soldiers and gendarmes have [...] "some fun" [...] before shooting them.|$|E
