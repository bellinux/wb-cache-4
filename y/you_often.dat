25|$|We Will Rock <b>You</b> (<b>often</b> {{abbreviated}} as WWRY) is {{a musical}} {{based on the}} songs of British rock band Queen with a book by Ben Elton. The musical {{tells the story of}} a group of Bohemians who struggle to restore the free exchange of thought, fashion, and live music in a distant future where everyone dresses, thinks and acts the same. Musical instruments and composers are forbidden, and rock music is all but unknown.|$|E
25|$|The natives, whose {{presence}} causes so much disgust to <b>you,</b> <b>often</b> {{take pride in}} {{the fact that they are}} Italian subjects. In Libya, Somalia and in the recent war against their homeland, in foreign struggles, they have shielded you with their bodies, and sometimes paid with their lives. I can assure you that it is no exaggeration to say that the natives provided you the means with which you could overcome. The misinterpretation of so many merits and acts of heroism carried out for Italy can only be indicative of an essentially alien and imperial government.|$|E
500|$|Ruck and Broderick had {{previously}} acted {{together in the}} Broadway production of Biloxi Blues. Cameron's Mr. Peterson voice was an in-joke imitation of their former director Gene Saks. Ruck felt at ease working with Broderick, often crashing in his trailer. [...] "We didn't have to invent an instant friendship like <b>you</b> <b>often</b> {{have to do in}} a movie", said Ruck. [...] "We were friends." ...|$|E

500|$|.....so great {{was your}} {{foresight}} {{of what we}} have since by wofull experience seen and felt, and specially in the Church, (through the Presbyterian contagion, which then began violently to breake out) that <b>you</b> <b>often</b> and earnestly incited me to a speedy view of what Monuments I could, especially in the principall Churches of this Realme; to the end, that by Inke and paper, the Shadows of them, with their Inscriptions might be preserved for posteritie, forasmuch as the things themselves were so neer unto ruine.|$|E
500|$|... "Grief Counseling" [...] {{was written}} by co-executive {{producer}} Jennifer Celotta, and was directed by Roger Nygard, his only episode of The Office to date. In a later interview with Den of Geek, Nygard found that [...] "television episodes are {{the domain of the}} writer-producers. You are there to service their vision. The Office is fully scripted, but there's always a little room to play when it's warranted. The first cuts are around 45 minutes, so <b>you</b> <b>often</b> have to cut the episodes in half for air." [...] Though [...] "Grief Counseling" [...] broadcast before the fifth episode, [...] "Initiation", its filming took place after that episode due to the availability of shooting on Dwight's fictional beet farm.|$|E
500|$|As Milo {{struggles with}} words and begins {{the process of}} making himself their master, he also has {{difficulty}} with numbers, especially when he speaks with [...]58 of a child, who with parents and two siblings (whom Milo does not meet) makes up an average family. Milo has had difficulties in school with mathematics and problem solving; his reaction to this encounter is to protest that averages are not real. [...] The partial child enlightens Milo that there is beauty in math beyond the tedium of learning an endless set of rules, [...] "one of the nicest things about mathematics, or anything else you might care to learn, {{is that many of the}} things which can never be, often are". Late in the book, Princess Reason counsels Milo, who has much learning ahead of him, not to be discouraged by its complexity, [...] "You must never feel badly about making mistakes... as long as you take the trouble to learn from them. For <b>you</b> <b>often</b> learn more by being wrong for the right reasons than you do by being right for the wrong reasons". An index card in the Juster papers sets forth the germ of the princess' [...] "memorable" [...] counsel to Milo, [...] "Quite often the road to Rhyme + Reason is through the right mistakes." ...|$|E

500|$|Sheen's {{breakthrough}} {{role was}} as British politician Tony Blair in 2003's The Deal. The Channel 4 film explored the so-called Granita pact made by Tony Blair and Gordon Brown {{prior to the}} 1994 Labour Party leadership election, and was the actor's first collaboration with screenwriter Peter Morgan. Director Stephen Frears cast him because [...] "he was in Mary Reilly and I knew he was brilliant." [...] Filmed while he was playing Caligula nightly on stage, Sheen has remarked, [...] "It's interesting that in searching for monsters to play, <b>you</b> <b>often</b> end up playing leaders." [...] The Daily Telegraph praised his [...] "earnest, yet steely, portrayal" [...] while The Guardian found him [...] "excellent. This is intelligent and honest casting." [...] In 2004, Sheen starred in ITV's Dirty Filthy Love, a comic film about a man dealing with OCD and Tourette's after a marital separation. Sheen spoke of [...] "treading a fine line" [...] because [...] "a lot of the symptoms are intrinsically comical". He {{was nominated for a}} BAFTA Award for Best Television Actor and a RTS Best Actor Award. Also in 2004, Sheen played a pompous rock star in the romantic comedy Laws of Attraction and produced and starred in The Banker, which won a BAFTA Award for Best Short Film. In 2005, Sheen starred in the National Theatre's production of The UN Inspector, a David Farr adaptation of The Government Inspector. The Times wrote of [...] "a scathingly brilliant and inventive performance" [...] while Variety noted that the actor [...] "adds comic finesse to his apparently ceaseless repertoire". The Evening Standard, while conceding that the performance was [...] "technically brilliant", expressed bemusement as to why [...] "one of the most mercurial and inspiring actors we have seems set on impersonating Rik Mayall throughout". Also that year, he took part in the Old Vic's 24 Hour Play, in which The Telegraph felt he [...] "dazzled". In 2005 film work, Sheen starred in Dead Long Enough, a small-budget Welsh/Irish film, with his longtime friend, Jason Hughes. In addition, he had a supporting role in Ridley Scott's Kingdom of Heaven, made a cameo appearance in The League of Gentlemen's Apocalypse and starred in the short film The Open Doors.|$|E
2500|$|Cheng Yu, an {{advisor to}} Cao Cao, also once {{mentioned}} that Guan Yu and Zhang Fei were [...] "capable of fighting thousands of enemies". In the main text of Zhang Fei's biography, Chen Shou wrote that Zhang Fei respected virtuous persons and detested those of vile character. Liu Bei had constantly warned Zhang Fei about his barbaric behaviour {{as he once}} told the latter, [...] "You have dealt out far too excessive punishments. <b>You</b> <b>often</b> flog your men, who are actually the ones who will carry out your orders. Your behaviour will get you into trouble." [...] Zhang Fei still did not change his ways.|$|E
2500|$|Dembski has not {{explained}} {{the origin of}} the intelligent designer that created the universe, which he argues is unnecessary, since such an intelligent designer is likely outside the dimensions of space and time, or to have any of his pro-intelligent design articles published in the peer-reviewed mainstream scientific journals. While intelligent design proponents often claim that such failure to get articles published is due to an alleged pro-evolution bias or conspiracy, Dembski himself has said that he prefers to disseminate his ideas in non-peer-reviewed media: [...] "I've just gotten kind of blas√© about submitting things to journals where <b>you</b> <b>often</b> wait two years to get things into print. And I find I can actually get the turnaround faster by writing a book and getting the ideas expressed there. My books sell well. I get a royalty. And the material gets read more." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Your pardon, fair sir," [...] said he, [...] "but I {{know you}} the moment I clap eyes on you, though in sooth I have seen <b>you</b> <b>oftener</b> in steel than in velvet.

2500|$|Some {{critics have}} derided Friedman's {{idiosyncratic}} prose style, with its tendency to use mixed metaphors and analogies. [...] Walter Russell Mead described his prose as being [...] "an occasionally flat Midwestern demotic punctuated by gee-whiz exclamations {{about just how}} doggone irresistible globalization is ‚Äì lacks the steely elegance of a Lippmann, the unobtrusive serviceability of a Scotty Reston or the restless fireworks of a Maureen Dowd and is best taken in small doses." [...] Similarly, journalist Matt Taibbi has said of Friedman's writing that, [...] "Friedman came up with lines so hilarious you couldn't make them up {{even if you were}} trying ‚Äì and when you tried to actually picture the 'illustrative' figures of speech he offered to explain himself, what <b>you</b> <b>often</b> ended up with was pure physical comedy of the Buster Keaton/Three Stooges school, with whole nations and peoples slipping and falling on the misplaced banana peels of his literary endeavors." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 2006 interview, Cornell {{revealed}} {{that at the}} age of 14, he had a bad PCP experience and suffered from panic disorder and agoraphobia. [...] "I had a bad PCP [...] experience when I was 14 and I got panic disorder. And of course, I wasn't telling anyone the truth. It's not like you go to your dad or your doctor and say, 'Yeah, I smoked PCP and I'm having a bad time.' So I became more or less agoraphobic because I'd have flashbacks. From 14 to 16, I didn't have any friends. I stayed home most of the time. Up till then life was pretty great. The world was big and I felt I could do anything I wanted. Suddenly, I felt like I couldn't do anything. But in the isolation, my imagination really had time to run. I never did any drugs until my late 20s. Unfortunately, being a child of two alcoholics, I started drinking a lot, and that's what eventually got me back into drugs. <b>You</b> <b>often</b> hear that pot leads to harder drugs. But I think alcohol is what leads you to everything, because it takes away the fear. The worst drug experimentation I ever did was because I was drunk and didn't care." ...|$|E
