You have to turn this into music. You have to try, at least. I was so embarrassed by just everything. I just didn’t {{want to be that}} person that just went down after all of that. A lot of the time in the sessions, they weren’t letting me write. They were giving me tracks and doing it all. I was like, Why am I here? Then I got the perfect {{combination}} of people to really support me and make me feel confident. It was an amazing awakening. I walked into the session and I was like, You gotta know, I don’t care about anything except the truth right here.|$|E
500|$|Some critics {{disliked the}} unusual design, however, and criticized the {{reliance}} on triangles throughout the building. Others took issue with the large main lobby, particularly its attempt to lure casual visitors. In his review for Artforum, critic Richard Hennessy described a [...] "shocking fun-house atmosphere" [...] and [...] "aura of ancient Roman patronage". One of the earliest and most vocal critics, however, came to appreciate the new gallery once he saw it in person. Allan Greenberg had scorned the design {{when it was first}} unveiled, but wrote later to J. Carter Brown: [...] "I am forced to admit that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>right</b> and I was wrong! The building is a masterpiece." ...|$|E

[...] Hochuli finds similarities between the football field and courtroom saying, [...] "On the football field, people like that I'm in charge and know what I'm doing, {{but a lot of the}} time, it's just appearance. [...] I'm going to sell you on my decision. It's the same in the courtroom. You don't stand in front of a jury and say, 'I think my client is innocent.' You say, 'We're right!'" ...|$|E

500|$|Southerners, however, {{saw that}} Douglas' attempt was {{unlikely}} to result in legalization of slavery. While it allowed Nebraska to determine whether slavery would be legal there when it became a state, slavery was still forbidden under the Missouri Compromise {{as long as it}} remained a territory. If no slaveholders were allowed in the territory, it would be exceedingly unlikely that the state's voters would allow for slavery in their constitution. Following this line of thought, Dixon drafted an amendment to Douglas' bill that would repeal section eight of the Missouri Compromise, the section that prohibited slavery north of latitude 36°30'. After a promise of support from Tennessee senator James C. Jones, Dixon introduced the amendment on January 16, 1854. This forced Douglas to confront the Missouri Compromise issue outright, and two days later, he visited Dixon to discuss his position. Douglas was reluctant to repeal the Compromise, but was ultimately convinced by Dixon's logic. He concluded the interview by exclaiming [...] "By God, Sir, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>right.</b> I will incorporate it in my bill, though I know it will raise a hell of a storm." [...] Over the next several days, Douglas incorporated Dixon's suggestion and other pro-slavery measures into the Kansas-Nebraska Act, which President Franklin Pierce signed into law on May 30, 1854.|$|E
2500|$|... "The most {{important}} thing to bear in mind when arrested is that you are a volunteer of a revolutionary Army, that you have been captured by an enemy force, that your cause is a just one, that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>right</b> and that the enemy is wrong and that as a soldier you have taken the chance expected of a soldier and that there is {{nothing to be ashamed of}} in being captured.|$|E
2500|$|Before the First World War, {{the family}} moved to Shiplake, Oxfordshire where Eric became {{friendly}} with the Buddicom family, especially their daughter Jacintha. When they first met, he was standing on his head in a field. On being asked why, he said, [...] "You are noticed more if you stand on your head than if <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>right</b> way up." [...] Jacintha and Eric read and wrote poetry, and dreamed of becoming famous writers. He said that he might write a book in the style of H. G. Wells's A Modern Utopia. During this period, he also enjoyed shooting, fishing and birdwatching with Jacintha's brother and sister.|$|E

2500|$|Jamie Todd Rubin, {{reviewing}} {{the issue of}} Astounding in which the story originally appeared, writes [...] "f all the stories in the issue, de Camp’s is the best written. There is no feeling of pulp writing or story-telling. It is a smooth tale that comes alive in your imagination so that you feel like <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>right</b> there with the characters on their journey. Abou the only weakness in the story was the ending, which returns to the father and his adopted son. I didn’t think the ending {{lived up to the}} full potential of the story, and almost would have liked to seen the beginning and ending left off, and just go on the wonderful journey through the African wilderness." ...|$|E
2500|$|On April 11, 1873, {{after months}} of false starts and aborted meetings, Canby went to another parley, unarmed and with some hope of final resolution. Judge Elijah Steele of Yreka, California wrote later that when he warned Canby that the Modoc were {{volatile}} and he was at risk, Canby replied, [...] "I believe <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>right,</b> Mr. Steele, and I shall regard your advice, {{but it would not}} be very well for the general in command to be afraid to go where the peace commissioners would venture." [...] The peace talks were held midway between the army encampment and Captain Jack's stronghold near Tule Lake. It was discovered later that two members of Canby's party brought concealed weapons and Modoc warriors were also armed.|$|E
2500|$|Pete McCloskey gave {{an address}} to the Institute for Historical Review (IHR) in 2000. [...] When he ran in the 2006 Republican Party primary for congress, there was {{controversy}} over exactly what he said about the Holocaust at the event. According to the San Jose Mercury News McCloskey said at the time, [...] "I don't know whether <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>right</b> or wrong about the Holocaust," [...] and referred to the [...] "so-called Holocaust". McCloskey replied that he has never questioned the existence of the Holocaust, and the 2000 quote referred to a debate over the number of people killed. McCloskey {{said in an interview with}} the Contra Costa Times on January 18, 2006 that the IHR transcript of his speech was inaccurate. Journalist Mark Hertsgaard of The Nation, in response to criticism of an article he wrote praising McCloskey's campaign against Pombo, stated that a tape he had viewed of McCloskey's speech to the IHR did not contain the [...] "right or wrong" [...] wording present in the transcript.|$|E
