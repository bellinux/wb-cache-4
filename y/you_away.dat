5|$|Anyone who {{has ever}} studied the history of American diplomacy, {{especially}} military diplomacy, knows that you might start in a war with certain things on your mind as a purpose {{of what you are}} doing, but in the end, you found yourself fighting for entirely different things that you had never thought of before... In other words, war has a momentum of its own and it carries <b>you</b> <b>away</b> from all thoughtful intentions when you get into it. Today, if we went into Iraq, like the president would like us to do, you know where you begin. You never know where you are going to end.|$|E
25|$|Ilê Aiyê's {{success has}} {{continued}} ever since and their numbers have grown into the thousands. Even today, the black only bloco continues to exclude others {{because of their}} skin color. They do this by advertising exclusive parties and benefits for members, as well as physically shunning and pushing <b>you</b> <b>away</b> {{if you try to}} include yourself. Though the media has called it ‘racist’, to a large degree the black-only bloco {{has become one of the}} most interesting aspects of Salvador’s Carnaval and is continuously accepted as a way of life. Combined with the influence of Olodum in Salvador, musical protest and representation as a product of slavery and black consciousness has slowly grown into a more powerful force. Musical representation of problems and issues have long been part of Brazil's history, and Ilê Aiyê and Olodum both produce creative ways to remain relevant and popular.|$|E
500|$|Wonderland is {{a concept}} album loosely based on Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland. The album took the title from the book, and was created with the {{intention}} of taking listeners on a journey, as well as showcasing Smith's voice. She said that [...] "that's something I like to hear in music. Whether I listen to Beyonce or Vivaldi, music is supposed to transport <b>you</b> <b>away,</b> escape from the everyday." [...] Smith said that she sometimes felt like Alice chasing White Rabbit, and, for this reason, [...] "Wonderland" [...] was a suitable title track for the album.|$|E

It was registered with the U.S. Copyright Office on April 26, 2003 under the title of [...] "Everytime I Try" [...] and SRU000530591 registration number with a given recording year of 2002. Spears named it the most personal song of the album along with [...] "Touch of My Hand", explaining, [...] "It's one of the songs that when you hear, it's like the kind of song when you go to heaven. It kind of takes <b>you</b> <b>away.</b> You know, it takes you in to a very cool consciousness I think." ...|$|E

A review elaborated that the instrumental piece can [...] "carry <b>you</b> <b>away</b> like a track by Sébastien Tellier". Todd Edwards commented that the lyrics of [...] "Fragments of Time" [...] were inspired by his desire to capture the moments he experienced {{during his visit to}} the duo's studio sessions in California. [...] "Doin' It Right" [...] was the last song to be recorded and features vocals performed by Panda Bear. The duo referred to it as the only purely electronic piece on the album, with a modern style. The closing track, [...] "Contact", is co-produced by DJ Falcon and features a sample of the song [...] "We Ride Tonight" [...] by Australian rock band the Sherbs.|$|E
500|$|... "Blaze a 50" [...] {{features}} a violin-based instrumental and a complex narrative that follows {{a tale of}} murder, sex, and betrayal. Nas narrates the tale in conventional fashion until the ending, at which the track rewinds to an earlier point and he revises his original ending. [...] "Everybody's Crazy" [...] features complex rhymes and braggadocio rap by Nas: [...] "Gangsta see, gangsta do / A Langston Hughes predecessor / Gun in my dresser, slang I use." [...] In [...] "Purple"s narrative, Nas lights up a blunt and expresses his thoughts, including criticism of hoodlums and their effect on their neighborhoods: [...] "The 'hood love you, but behind your back they pray for the day / A bullet hit your heart and ambulance take <b>you</b> <b>away</b> / That ain't love it's hate / Think of all the mothers at wakes / Whose sons you've killed and you ain't got a cut on your face?"

500|$|Entertainment Weekly {{gave the}} film an [...] "A" [...] rating and praised Benicio del Toro's performance, which critic Owen Gleiberman called, [...] "haunting in his understatement, [...] becomes the film's quietly {{awakening}} moral center". Desson Howe, {{in his review}} for the Washington Post, wrote, [...] "Soderbergh and screenwriter Stephen Gaghan, who based this on a British television miniseries of the same name, have created an often exhilarating, soup-to-nuts exposé of the world's most lucrative trade". In his review for Rolling Stone, Peter Travers wrote, [...] "The hand-held camerawork [...] Soderbergh himself did the holdingprovides a documentary feel that rivets attention". However, Richard Schickel, in his review for Time, wrote, [...] "there is a possibly predictable downside to this multiplicity of story lines: they keep interrupting one another. Just as you get interested in one, Stephen Gaghan's script, inspired by a British mini-series, jerks <b>you</b> <b>away</b> to another". In an interview, director Ingmar Bergman lauded the film as [...] "amazing".|$|E
500|$|BioShock uses {{a heavily}} {{modified}} Unreal Engine 2.5 {{with some of}} the advanced technologies from Unreal Engine 3. Irrational had previous experience with modifying and expanding on the Unreal Engine in SWAT 4, and continued this advancement of the engine within BioShock. One major improvement they added was improved water effects, given the nature of the game's setting, hiring a programmer and artist just to focus on the water effects. This graphical enhancement has been lauded by critics, with GameSpot saying, [...] "Whether it's standing water on the floor or sea water rushing in after an explosion, it will blow <b>you</b> <b>away</b> every time you see it." [...] BioShock also uses the Havok Physics engine that allows for an enhancement of in-game physics, the integration of ragdoll physics, and allows for more lifelike movement by elements of the environment. The Windows version was built to work in both Direct3D 10 (DirectX 10) and DirectX 9, with the DirectX 10 version supporting additional water and particle effects.|$|E
500|$|Throughout the song, {{the narrator}} {{addresses}} an unidentified girl, asking [...] "When {{will you come}} with me", and lamenting {{the fact that she}} laughs at him for having nothing to his name. He tells her he wants to give her his hopes and bring her freedom, that [...] "the earth is turning under your feet" [...] and [...] "the waters of life are flowing free", yet she persists in scorning him. He asks why she laughs at the pack he carries on his back, and he wonders why he keeps on going, with nothing to his name. At last, he tells her that he has waited for a long time, and that this is his final plea: he wants to grab her by the hands, to [...] "take <b>you</b> <b>away</b> with me". As he sees her hands tremble, and her eyes [...] "overflow with tears", he asks her, [...] "Do you really mean to tell me, you love me as I am?" ...|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} {{features}} references to several alcoholic drinks {{which can be}} seen in the lyrics, [...] "I can't drink <b>you</b> <b>away.</b> I've tried Jack, I've tried Jim... Now, tell me baby, do they make a medicine for heartbreak." [...] Brad Stern of MTV News described it as a [...] "plethora of alcohol references, and a whole lot of bluesy sorrow." [...] According to Stacy-Ann Ellis of Vibe magazine, the song's lyrics continue the [...] "druggy love analogy" [...] which Timberlake started with some of the lyrical themes on The 20/20 Experience (2013) most particularly on, [...] "Pusher Love Girl"; she noted that he is [...] "trying to drown a bitter memory of her by opening up a bar tab and taking Tennessee whiskies to the head." [...] Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine described [...] "Drink You Away" [...] as a [...] "honky-tonking" [...] song on which the singer compares his love to alcoholism.|$|E
500|$|The audio of Escape from Butcher Bay was {{generally}} well received, and critics praised its voice acting; {{the performances of}} Vin Diesel and Cole Hauser were given special commendation. In regard to the music, FiringSquad's Jakub Wojnarowicz stated, [...] "It's {{not good enough to}} sweep <b>you</b> <b>away</b> but it's also not bad enough to stick out like a sore thumb". IGN said, [...] "The music isn't memorable, but it's not bad". The Sunday Herald Sun called the voice acting [...] "Surprisingly good". The game's length was commonly criticized. Reviewers noted that it could be completed in eight to fifteen hours, and IGN said, [...] "If you consider around 12 hours of gameplay short, then Riddick is just that." [...] Several reviewers were displeased by the game's lack of multiplayer components; Computer and Video Games referred to it as a [...] "missed opportunity". Game Informer said, [...] "Since the main quest is short [...] and there is no multiplayer, it’s not a ton of game for your money." ...|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} July, Wilson {{left the}} film because of {{scheduling}} conflicts {{brought on by the}} filming delay, and characters being played by Gerald and Kevin Weisman were cut in McKay's revised script. Also, Reed indicated that in addition to Georgia, filming would take place in San Francisco. The next month, Reed revealed that Scott Lang's daughter would appear in the film, and Gabriel Ferrari and Andrew Barrer were hired to make further revisions to the script. Eric Pearson, a member of Marvel Studios' writing program who had written the Marvel One-Shot films, did uncredited work on the film as well. After reading the revised script, Evangeline Lilly felt that the film was [...] "pulled" [...] more into the MCU than Wright's version which [...] "was much more in the Edgar Wright camp of films." [...] She added that, while Wright's version was [...] "incredible" [...] and would have been great to film and watch, [...] "it wouldn't have fit in the Marvel Universe. It would have stuck out like a sore thumb, no matter how good it was. It just would have taken <b>you</b> <b>away</b> from this cohesive universe they're trying to create. And therefore it ruins the suspended disbelief that they've built." ...|$|E

500|$|Raymond Fiore of Entertainment Weekly {{gave the}} album a B and commented, [...] "If Aaliyah had lived {{to make another}} CD, it might have sounded like Goodies," [...] and said that other album cuts [...] "prove she's no one-track pony." [...] Noting the singles [...] "Goodies," [...] "1, 2 Step," [...] and [...] "Oh" [...] as {{standout}} tracks, Allmusic gave the album {{three and a half}} out of five stars. Steve Jones of USA Today said, [...] "The voice doesn't blow <b>you</b> <b>away,</b> but as with Goodies, she takes a lyrically intriguing offbeat path from time to time. Though not every song is a goodie, she does have a few treats in store." [...] Even though he said the album wasn't a perfect work, Azeem Ahmad of musicOMH said, [...] "The talent is obviously there but if we are to carry out Ciara's wish of forgetting about [...] "the other chicks" [...] then there's some fine-tuning needed. For now there's no direct threat to any other hip-hop divas, but the void left by Aaliyah is still there for someone to try and fill. There's no reason why Ciara can't one day hold her own with the best." [...] Jalylah Burrell of PopMatters commented that [...] "Goodies is nothing new, but it is executed well." ...|$|E

Still, the fact that NBA 2K16 is a great basketball experience can’t be ignored.
