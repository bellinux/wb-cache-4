[...] "What Do <b>You</b> <b>Want</b> <b>from</b> Me" [...] is {{influenced}} by Chicago blues, and [...] "Poles Apart" [...] contains folksy overtones.

500|$|Despite decent sales, The Division Bell {{received}} mixed reviews. Tom Sinclair of Entertainment Weekly {{gave it a}} [...] "D", {{writing that}} [...] "avarice is the only conceivable explanation for this glib, vacuous cipher of an album, which is notable primarily for its stomach-turning merger of progressive-rock pomposity and New Age noodling". Rolling Stone Tom Graves criticised Gilmour's performance, stating that his guitar solos had [...] "settled into rambling, indistinct asides that are as forgettable {{as they used to}} be indelible ... only on 'What Do <b>You</b> <b>Want</b> <b>from</b> Me' does Gilmour sound like he cares". Nevertheless, the album was nominated in the 1995 Brit awards for the [...] "Best Album by a British Artist", but lost to Blur's Parklife. In March the same year the band was awarded with a Grammy for the [...] "Best Rock Instrumental Performance" [...] on [...] "Marooned".|$|E
500|$|Expressing honestly, in NVC, {{is likely}} to involve expressing an {{observation}}, feeling, need, and request. An observation may be omitted if {{the context of the}} conversation is clear. A feeling might be omitted if there is sufficient connection already, or the context is one where naming a feeling isn't likely to contribute to connection. It is said that naming a need in addition to a feeling makes it less likely that people will think you are making them responsible for your feeling. Similarly, it is said that making a request in addition to naming a need makes it less likely that people will infer a vague demand that they address your need. The components are thought to work together synergistically. According to NVC trainer Bob Wentworth, [...] "an observation sets the context, feelings support connection and getting out of our heads, needs support connection and identify what is important, and a request clarifies what sort of response you might enjoy. Using these components together minimizes the chances of people getting lost in potentially disconnecting speculation about what <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>from</b> them and why." ...|$|E

[...] Stan Hey of The Mail on Sunday observed that on the strength of the opening episode, the series' success seemed [...] "fairly assured". He noted that: [...] "characters are only skin–deep as yet, being subsidiary to the plot, but a successful graft should be achieved during the series." [...] Kathleen Morgan of the Daily Record praised the casting of French and Griffin, writing: [...] "It will take a couple of episodes before both actors shake off their soapy history, but with some decent plots and good lines, they should make the grade."

Mikeal Wood from the Los Angeles Times praised [...] "Your Body"'s musical diversity from her previous 2010 record Bionic and complimented Aguilera's [...] "powerhouse" [...] vocals on the track. Sarah Deen for Metro praised the single as [...] "a funky, thumping dance number that is one for the girls to dance around their handbags to".

500|$|The Two Towers {{received}} critical acclaim; film site aggregator Rotten Tomatoes {{reported that}} 96 percent of critics were positive.

[...] Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Owen Gleiberman remarked [...] "The Two Towers conjures an illusion of the gravity that <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>from</b> an emotionally charged storybook epic. Really, though, {{what it comes down to}} is superbly staged battle scenes and moral alliances forged in earnest yet purged of the wit and dynamic, bristly ego that define true on-screen personality."

500|$|Reviewing the Nintendo 64 {{version of}} Command & Conquer, Erik Reppen of Game Informer wrote that it [...] "has done an amazing job of {{completely}} reworking the old levels into a 3D polygonal format." [...] Although {{he said that}} the game [...] "offers plenty to keep you entertained", he disliked the heavy sound compression and the loss of the FMV cutscenes present in earlier versions. IGN's Aaron Boulding opened his review by saying: [...] "To their credit, Looking Glass developed Command & Conquer with all of the elements <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>from</b> a quality RTS." [...] Boulding praised the gameplay and the Special Ops missions, but noted that most of the units were distinct from the PC version. He was less happy with the port's graphics, calling them [...] "hit and miss", though he lauded the audio effects and voice work. Boulding also said the controls were well handled, though a bit complicated, and concluded: [...] "Command & Conquer is a fine game and may get a little addictive for anyone who never got into the PC version of the game. But for anyone who ran through the old version, the N64 won't offer {{much in the way of}} new thrills beyond the new N64 missions and the 3D world." ...|$|E

[...] To get the effect of Knowles riding the cat, Matsoukas used a large plastic cow covered in a black fur drape for Knowles to perform on.

It begins with Knowles showing cat-like eyes with leopard print make-up and fashion on. In some parts of the clip, Knowles plays with an oversized ball of pink yarn and later plays with an oversized black cat. The clip ends with Knowles pulling the oversized cat on a gold chain off set and just immediately after that, the music video for [...] "Green Light" [...] begins. Rohin Guha of BlackBook magazine described the video as [...] "deplorable". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine described the video for [...] "Kitty Kat" [...] as [...] "pure camp".

(How, for instance, did Emma learn that she could capture memories in dreamcatchers? [...] And why is that the craft she chose now that she doesn’t need to sleep?) Maybe all those assumptions and conclusions will be eventually explained in one of those “ohhhhh, I get it now” summations a couple of episodes down the road, but maybe not. Once’s writers and creators have a tendency to play fast and loose with their storylines, knowing their audience will just kind of accept it and move on. Thus, these kinds of leaps aren’t really out of the question for them. (You can’t blame them, really. We’re already watching a show about fairy tales, for crying out loud.) But I didn’t really get “Dreamcatcher.” I’m not sure that I’m supposed to yet, and down the road I might change my mind and say, “you know, that was the episode I need to go back and watch now that I know what I know.” But for now, it just left me a little cold.
