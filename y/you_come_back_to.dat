[...] McCartney subsequently passed her response to Lennon while visiting him in Los Angeles. [...] "John often said he didn't understand why Paul did this for us, but he did." [...] In 2012, McCartney revealed that he did not blame Ono for the breakup of the Beatles and credited Ono with inspiring much of Lennon's post-Beatles work.|$|E
500|$|Computer and Video Games {{predicted}} that the game [...] "will be the one <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> when you've got a full house", and appreciated its [...] "crazy genius" [...] gameplay. Nintendo World Report {{was pleased with the}} game's variety, but found the small number of unlockable items and lack of high scores disappointing. Although video game review website IGN noted that the game was not the best in the Wario series of video games, they still considered it an [...] "essential piece of the Wii collection". The website was also entertained by the single-player mode as well as the multiplayer, especially when [...] "shov the controller off on unsuspecting houseguests or non-gamers months and years down the road". They considered the game's use of the Wii Remote to be [...] "slick and intuitive", the graphics to be [...] "nearly inexplicable", and the sound to be [...] "totally off the wall". GameZone called the game [...] "original and addictive", but noted that it would not appeal to everyone. The Courier-Mail praised the game's use of the Wii's motion-sensitive controllers as one of its best features, which helps push it [...] "over-the-top" [...] as [...] "one of the most inventive games designed for the Wii's interactive controls". Canada's Toronto Sun also appreciated its [...] "novel use" [...] of the Wiimote.|$|E
500|$|There {{are many}} themes {{found in this}} book; some that are {{recurring}} are roles in society, religion, relationships, and also hybrid nature of American and Mexican ethnicities. Within these short stories Cisneros concentrates on the identities which women appropriate {{as a result of}} relationships, and how these are connected with their roles in society. [...] Critic Mary Reichart observes that in Cisneros's previous work as well as [...] "in Woman Hollering Creek (1991), the female characters break out of the molds assigned to them by the culture in search of new roles and new kinds of relationships. Cisneros portrays women who challenge stereotypes and break taboos, sometimes simply for the sake of shocking the establishment, but most often because the confining stereotypes prevent them from achieving their own identity." [...] An example of this is Cleófilas, who had hoped for a better life after leaving her home in Mexico to live in the United States. [...] The soap operas she had seen had led her to believe that her life {{was going to be a}} fairy tale. [...] Instead, with a failing marriage and another child on the way she sees that her life resembles only the saddest aspects of a soap opera. [...] Another example of this is found in the final section of this book, entitled [...] "There Was A Man, There Was A Woman", where Cisneros illustrates how women can use their bodies as political instruments in their attempts to fight against male domination. [...] The two female protagonists in [...] "Never Marry a Mexican" [...] and [...] "Eyes of Zapata" [...] use their bodies in attempts to gain recognition and acceptance from husband and lover. [...] However, in doing so, they face the problems of objectification and oppression; two issues which end up adversely shaping the characters' identities. [...] In the end, the illegitimate societal roles of these women influence their quest for female identity. For example, Inés, in [...] "Eyes of Zapata", talks about the role she plays as lover, not a wife: [...] "You married her, that woman from Villa de Ayala, true. But see, you came back to me. You always come back. In between and beyond the others. That's my magic. <b>You</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> me." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{contrast}} {{to the sound of}} R.E.M.'s previous two records, the music of Monster consisted of distorted guitar tones, minimal overdubs, and touches of 1970s glam rock. Peter Buck described Monster as [...] "a 'rock' record, with the rock in quotation marks." [...] He explained, [...] "That's not what we started out to make, but that's certainly how it turned out to be. There's a nudge, nudge, wink, wink feel to the whole record. Like, it's a rock record, but is it really?" [...] Mike Mills told Time, [...] "On past albums we had been exploring acoustic instruments, trying to use the piano and mandolin, and we did it about all we wanted to do it. And <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the fact that playing loud electric-guitar music is about as fun as music can be." [...] Stipe's vocals were pushed back in the mix. Buck's guitar work on the album was inspired by the tremolo-heavy guitar playing of Glen Johansson from Echobelly, who supported R.E.M. for some of the Monster Tour.|$|E
2500|$|Franklin's success {{expanded}} {{during the}} early 1970s in which she recorded top ten singles such as [...] "Spanish Harlem", [...] "Rock Steady" [...] and [...] "Day Dreaming" [...] {{as well as the}} acclaimed albums, Spirit in the Dark, Young, Gifted & Black and her gospel album, Amazing Grace, which sold over two million copies. In 1971, Franklin became the first R performer to headline Fillmore West, later recording the live album, Aretha Live at Fillmore West. Franklin's career began to experience problems while recording the album, Hey Now Hey, which featured production from Quincy Jones. Despite the success of the single, [...] "Angel", the album bombed upon its release in 1973. Franklin continued having R success with songs such as [...] "Until <b>You</b> <b>Come</b> <b>Back</b> <b>to</b> Me" [...] and [...] "I'm in Love" [...] but by 1975, her albums and songs were no longer top sellers. After Jerry Wexler left Atlantic for Warner Bros. Records in 1976, Franklin worked on the soundtrack to the film, [...] "Sparkle", with Curtis Mayfield. The album yielded Franklin's final top 40 hit of the decade, [...] "Something He Can Feel", which also peaked at number-one on the R chart. Franklin's follow-up albums for Atlantic including Sweet Passion, Almighty Fire and La Diva bombed on the charts and in 1979, Franklin opted to leave the company.|$|E
