But she was painfully shy, so that {{conversation}} with her was sometimes halting and unrewarding, for <b>you</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> she had {{so much more to}} say, but could not bring herself to say it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} {{a debate}} over banning gay and lesbian marriage occurred in the Minnesota Legislature. On the House floor Lindner claimed that allowing same-sex marriage would {{open the door to}} [...] "a man marrying a child or a man marrying a dog." [...] Openly gay State Rep. Karen Clark (whose partner, parents, and her partner's parents were attending the debate) expressed dismay at the comment. Lindner told her “I don't know why <b>you</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> was insulting. I was trying to make a point, that we've got a norm of one man, one woman. Once we begin to deviate...what's to keep us from having to pass laws to allow a man to marry several women, or a man and a boy relationship -- and there [...] are people who would like to have that. When we start changing that definition of marriage, that does open up the door to others who will say 'Why not us?'” He told Clark that while he saw her as “one of God’s creations. ...I personally don't think the lifestyle you've chosen and other homosexuals have chosen is really good [...] for you, your partner or society. ...I'm talking in general, the HIV/AIDS problem, other diseases. It probably affects more homosexual men. ...I don't know of any [...] couple, where they've been faithful to each other, a man and a woman, has any fear of any sexually transmitted disease unless they have to get a blood transfusion. ...you're living in sin." [...] He also stated [...] "I don't believe adoption of children by homosexual couples is [...] {{in the best interests of}} children." [...] (In 1997 Minnesota enacted the Marriage Protection Act defining marriage as a [...] "civil contract between a man and a woman" [...] and stating that [...] "Lawful marriage may be contracted only between persons of the opposite sex".) ...|$|E

I see, however, two ways out. One is this hypothesis: that every physical quality admired by men in women is in direct connexion with the manifold functions of women for the propagation of the species. It may be so. The world, it seems, is drearier than even you, Lynch, imagined. For my part I dislike that way out. It leads to eugenics rather than to esthetic. It leads you out of the maze into a new gaudy lecture-room where MacCann, with one hand on THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES and the other hand on the new testament, tells you that you admired the great flanks of Venus because <b>you</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> she would bear you burly offspring and admired her great breasts because <b>you</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> she would give good milk to her children and yours.|$|E
6000|$|The husband endeavoured {{to explain}} that the {{screaming}} might depend on the causes which had produced the coercion.
