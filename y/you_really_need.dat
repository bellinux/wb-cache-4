500|$|Also in 2014, Michael Stevens of the YouTube channel Vsauce devoted {{time to the}} {{discussion}} of irony in the episode [...] "Dord". In this video, Stevens considers {{the difference between the}} typically cited [...] "situational" [...] irony, versus [...] "dramatic" [...] irony. According to him, the irony of the song may not necessarily be in the situations themselves, but rather in the dramatic irony – when someone is unaware of the significance of the event while others are. The situations aren't ironic themselves, but life itself is ironic. It is a song about [...] "the difference between what life knows we need, and what life thinks we need. What's ironic is not 10,000 spoons when {{all you need is a}} knife, it's the fact that, as Alanis believes, you have all of those spoons because, unbeknownst to you, but known by life, what <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>need</b> right now is only spoons... or the last thing you need right now is a knife." ...|$|E
500|$|While Radiohead has {{expressed}} anti-war sentiments in the past—including {{a contribution to}} the 1995 War Child charity compilation The Help Album—"Harry Patch (In Memory Of)" [...] marks {{the first time that a}} Radiohead song explicitly refers to war in its lyrics, marking a departure from Yorke's typically abstract writing. The lyrics are from the perspective of a soldier in the midst of First World War trench warfare. Several lines, including [...] "Give your leaders each a gun and then let them fight it out themselves" [...] and [...] "The next will be chemical but they will never learn", are adapted from quotations by Patch. Both Luke Lewis of NME and Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly likened the lyrics to Wilfred Owen's First World War-era poem Dulce et Decorum est. Rice referred to Yorke's voice in the song as an [...] "innocent and youthful falsetto"; the NME said his singing is [...] "subdued to the point where <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>need</b> to read the lyrics".|$|E
500|$|In 1972, Gittings and Kameny {{organized}} {{a discussion with}} the American Psychiatric Association entitled [...] "Psychiatry: Friend or Foe to Homosexuals: A Dialogue", where a panel of psychiatrists were to discuss homosexuality. When Gittings' partner Kay Tobin Lahusen noticed that all the psychiatrists were heterosexual, she protested. Gittings remembered, [...] "My partner, Kay, said, 'This isn't right—here you have two psychiatrists pitted against two gays, and what <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>need</b> is someone who is both.' The panel moderator, Dr. Kent Robinson, agreed to add a gay psychiatrist if we could find one. In 1972 who would come forward? ... Kay and I wrote letters and made phone calls around the country." [...] A gay psychiatrist in Philadelphia finally agreed {{to appear on the}} panel in heavy disguise, and with a voice distorting microphone, calling himself [...] "Dr. H. Anonymous". He was [...] John E. Fryer, and he discussed how he was forced to be closeted while practicing psychiatry. Gittings read aloud letters from psychiatrists she had solicited who declined to appear for fear of professional ostracism. She described the event as [...] "transformative".|$|E

500|$|The adult fandom {{has been}} {{perceived}} negatively by others, with {{coverage of the}} brony fandom overshadowing the show itself. Much of the fandom's ridicule from others comes from {{the perception of the}} mostly adult male fanbase enjoying a show that is marketed to the young female demographic. Through this, the brony community has encountered ridicule through trolling on internet forums, not only from its inception at 4chan, but after moving away from the site. This has also been called out in popular media. The Fox News Channel comedy talk program Red Eye poked fun at the fandom because it largely consists of young adult males. Kurt Schlichter of BigHollywood.com called the phenomenon a [...] "terrifying new trend", and wrote, [...] "Hollywood, do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>need</b> to enable the creepy immaturity of these geebos? No. It's time to stop the insanity." [...] Commenting on Schlichter's article, Greg Pollowitz of the National Review Online wrote that considering the target audience he could not understand the show's appeal to adult men. Jerry Springer attempted to bring bronies onto his talk for a segment on [...] "Outrageously Guilty Pleasures", though the fandom warned others about the potential ridicule.|$|E
500|$|... "Stand Up for Love" [...] {{received}} negative reviews by most music critics. James Blake {{writing for}} BBC Online, described [...] "Stand Up for Love" [...] as a [...] "sugary ballad".

Fiona Mckinlay criticized {{the fact that the}} song was used as an opener for #1's and felt it wasn't [...] "really causing any kind of reaction before they get started properly with Independent Woman Pt.1". Houston Chronicles Michael D. Clark described the track as [...] "overwrought and overproduced; at best, it's a future prom theme". Matthew Jacobs of The Huffington Post felt it was [...] "great" [...] the song was used for World's Children day but described it as a [...] "total snoozefest". A writer for Billboard magazine commented that the song lacked the potential to become a chart-topper. He went on to describe it as a [...] "schmaltzy AC ballad aiming to display the individual talents" [...] of Destiny's Child's members, adding that it was [...] "ironic" [...] as the group's other songs on the disc focused mainly on production. He finished his review by saying that [...] "Stand Up for Love" [...] was a [...] "disappointing nonstarter".|$|E
