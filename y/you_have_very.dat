2500|$|When first released, [...] "Brand New Key" [...] {{was banned}} by some radio {{stations}} because some heard sexual innuendo in the lyrics. Melanie has acknowledged {{the possibility of}} reading an unintended sexual innuendo in the song, stating, [...] "I wrote [...] in about fifteen minutes one night. I thought it was cute; a kind of old thirties tune. I guess a key and a lock have always been Freudian symbols, and pretty obvious ones at that. There was no deep serious expression behind the song, but people read things into it. They made up incredible stories {{as to what the}} lyrics said and what the song meant. In some places, it was even banned from the radio [...] My idea about songs is that once you write them, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>very</b> little say in their life afterward [...] People will take it any way they want to take it." ...|$|E
6000|$|The Doctor laughed out. [...] "That {{must take}} a great deal off your hands! Your brother also knows, of course, that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>very</b> little money." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You may see {{something}} very comical in this information, Sir--but I {{can tell you}} this, Mr. Jinks, that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>very</b> little to laugh at,' said the magistrate.|$|E
60|$|Gwendolen. Of course I will, darling. How long <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{been about}} it! I am afraid <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>very</b> little {{experience}} {{in how to}} propose.|$|R
6000|$|... "So <b>you</b> <b>have</b> come," [...] she said; [...] "I {{thought that}} you would. But then <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>very</b> little choice, <b>had</b> you?" [...] she added with a little laugh.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes. I {{understood}} that <b>you</b> thought <b>you</b> <b>had</b> not treated your aunts rightly by not consulting them about your intercourse with the Whites, and that <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>very</b> properly resolved {{to tell them}} all. I hope you did so.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, come, Felix!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "Don't {{look at me}} {{as though}} I were a ghost. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>very</b> little {{confidence}} in me, after all, I see." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're a {{good man}} in a boat," [...] Redmond conceded. [...] "Still, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>very</b> little sense. Fancy making a run of that kind and coming ashore with--claret!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{should not}} indulge in morbid fancies, and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>very</b> little cause for gratitude. We were {{sincerely}} sorry for you, {{and tried to}} do what we could," [...] I said.|$|E
6000|$|... "For {{the sake}} of the woman whom the old man Hurd was {{shielding}} <b>you</b> <b>had</b> better not. <b>You</b> <b>had</b> <b>very</b> much better not," [...] was the hoarse reply. [...] "If you do, it may cost a woman her life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{suspect that}} {{in the midst of}} your perplexities at that time, <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>very</b> great {{amusement}} in tricking us all.--I am sure you had.--I am sure it was a consolation to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I told him, of course," [...] said Jimmy, [...] "that <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>very</b> kindly {{invited me}} to stay with you, {{and he told me}} all, about his trouble and implored me to plead for him. If <b>you</b> <b>had</b> seen him when I did, all gloom and repentance, <b>you</b> would <b>have</b> been sorry for him. Your woman's heart--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>very</b> much to learn, Colonel Campbell," [...] Madame de Chevreuse said. [...] "You {{will find}} plenty of ladies in the court here who will not object to give you lessons." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I {{find you}} so averse {{to let me}} see the lady by herself," [...] said I, [...] "I must suppose <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>very</b> good grounds to think me in the right about her unwillingness." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I need no thanks, my lad. I am still, {{and shall}} always remain, your debtor. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>very</b> {{much more than}} {{fulfilled}} my expectations, and I shall be glad to place some {{of the burden of}} my business upon your shoulders.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I will go!" [...] he said. [...] "Let me {{tell you}} this, sir," [...] he added, as he neared the door. [...] "Your {{decision}} is a wise one. If you knew whose cause <b>you</b> <b>had</b> been aiding, whose tool <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>very</b> nearly become, I think that your manner {{would be a little}} more apologetic." ...|$|R
6000|$|Laura laughed. [...] "Well," [...] she said, [...] "if {{one must}} be accurate, I do not exactly know. I {{may have been a}} little unwise in endeavouring to impress it on you. Why did you {{consider}} it worth while to explain <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>very</b> seldom been in the saddle?" ...|$|R
60|$|MISS P.--Well, no; I don't think <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a <b>very</b> bad temper, Mr. Milliken, a--Horace.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think a {{great deal}} of her, and must repeat what I said already. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>very</b> loyal friends. Miss Steel told me at length how kind you had been to her and her brother, and I think they will fully repay you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite so," [...] said Elizabeth. [...] "My dear Beatrice, why don't you tie up your hair? You {{look like}} a crazy Jane. Not but what <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>very</b> nice hair," [...] she added critically. [...] "Do you admire good hair, Mr. Bingham." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If you imagine," [...] I said, [...] "that I {{have the}} effrontery {{to go to}} that nunnery--for it is no more nor less than that--and ask the Lady Abbess to lend me one of her nuns to write at my dictation, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>very</b> much mistaken me." ...|$|E
6000|$|If <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{only been}} fancying {{that you are}} doing right, and suspect {{suddenly}} that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> been <b>very</b> likely doing wrong--What then? ...|$|R
60|$|Paul Ruttledge. I'm afraid <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a <b>very</b> bad {{opinion of}} me, Charlie. Well, maybe I earned it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am. It {{seems to}} me I sized you up {{correctly}} quite a while ago, and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> had about enough claim-jumping. Now, I don't know that I blame you, and, anyway, if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>very</b> little sense, it showed <b>you</b> <b>had</b> some grit. As the mining laws stand, it's a legitimate occupation, {{and you tell me}} you only figured on getting your dollars back. Well, if you want them, you can work for them at a reasonable salary." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As to falsehood, treachery and {{the other}} {{military}} virtues with which you threaten me, I shall go, in them, as far as you; but from arson and assassination I recoil with horror. You see <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>very</b> little to burn, {{and you are not}} more than half alive anyhow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Come, come, Sir,' {{said the}} {{magistrate}} sternly, 'don't {{let me see}} any of this levity here. It is very unbecoming, and I {{can assure you that}} <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>very</b> little to smile at. Was the account you gave me just now strictly true? Now be careful, sir!' 'Your Wash-up,' stammered Grummer, 'I-' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, you see, he may {{travel in}} the country to GIT 'em," [...] here shrewdly remarked the constable; [...] "and it's our belief that neither horse nor money is {{honestly}} come by. If his worship is satisfied, why so, in course, shall we be; but there is highwaymen abroad, look you; and, to our notion, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>very</b> much the cut of one." ...|$|E
6000|$|In sooth, a half-bred Pegasus, and {{far gone}} [...] In spavin, curb, {{and half a}} hundred woes. And Byron's style is 'jolter-headed jargon;' [...] His verse is 'only bearable in prose.' So living poets write of those that are gone, [...] And o'er the Eagle thus the Bantam crows; And Swinburne ends where Verisopht began, By owning <b>you</b> <b>'a</b> <b>very</b> clever man.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly not. Most {{certainly}} not. At present, however, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> got <b>very</b> {{little to}} go upon. And unless evidence is forthcoming--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps, after all," [...] Jocelyn Thew declared, [...] "you {{are right}} to go. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> been <b>very</b> useful, and <b>you</b> <b>have,</b> without a doubt, earned your {{thousand}} pounds." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Apropos of frivolity," [...] Rowland said, [...] "I 'm sure <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>very</b> {{little of}} it, unless at West Nazareth it is {{considered}} frivolous {{to walk in the}} woods and nod to the nodding flowers. Do kindly tell me a little about yourself." [...] And to compel her to begin, [...] "I know you come of a race of theologians," [...] he went on.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, then; {{no woman}} has what I may call the {{political}} instinct. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>very</b> great virtues; I am the first, I hope, to admit that; but I {{have never met}} a woman who even saw {{what is meant by}} statesmanship. I am going to make you still more angry. I hope that I never shall meet such a woman. Now, Miss Vinrace, are we enemies for life?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{naturally}} a wrench to us," [...] Lord Ashleigh confessed, [...] "especially as circumstances which {{you already know}} of prevent either your mother or myself from being with you {{during the first few}} months of your stay there. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>very</b> many friends in New York, however, and your mother tells me that there will be no difficulty about your chaperonage at the various social functions to which you will, of course, be bidden." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Very good, Colonel. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> said enough,' he cried, in a choking voice. 'You {{say that}} <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> a <b>very</b> {{distinguished}} career. I promise you {{also a very}} distinguished ending. Colonel Etienne Gerard of the Third Hussars shall have a death of his own.' ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{governor}} nodded. [...] "Yes, he is a thorough-paced villain; <b>you</b> <b>have</b> done <b>very</b> well, young man, and I {{shall not}} forget it." ...|$|R
60|$|Harry (Makes {{a gesture}} with his arm; speaks vaguely but with feeling). I believe <b>you</b> <b>have</b> been <b>very</b> good {{to my old}} man....|$|R
