She wore a white tube top and a tight white skirt and carried a bunch of notes in her left hand. At {{the end of the}} performance she asked the audience [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> I'm a material girl?...I'm not...Take it ... I don't need money... I need love." [...] As she began to strip off more clothes, she was apprehended and marched offstage by an extra posing as her father. In Detroit, Tony Ciccone himself did the honors.

500|$|One of {{the sensations}} of the Games was black American track star Jesse Owens, who won four gold medals. According to some American press stories, Hitler left the stadium rather than {{shake hands with}} him. This was not the case; Hitler {{had been told by}} IOC {{president}} Baillet-Latour not to shake hands with the winners unless he was prepared to shake hands with all gold medalists, which he was not; this, however was not publicized. According to Butterfield, in later years retellings of what Brundage termed [...] "a fairy tale" [...] roused the American to [...] "acute fury". Hitler was, however, asked by his youth leader, Baldur von Schirach, to meet Owens, and he refused, [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> that I'd allow myself to be photographed shaking hands with a Negro?" ...|$|E
500|$|Having {{qualified}} to swim for Australia, another obstacle arose with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, {{which resulted in}} a boycott of the Games by {{a large part of the}} Western world, led by the United States. The Australian prime minister, Malcolm Fraser, was also the patron of the Australian Olympic Committee, and significant political pressure came to bear on the athletes to boycott the Games. Evans' relay teammate Tonelli believed that only the sportspeople would suffer from a boycott and that trade relations would continue unabated. He took a leadership role among the athletes to fight for their right to compete and publicise their cause among the Australian public. Evans was fully supportive of Tonelli's campaign, reflecting that [...] "We were political tools, and the only ones to suffer would be us." [...] He rhetorically asked: [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> that if we didn't go someone would come up to us after the Games and pat us on the back for not going?" ...|$|E

500|$|New York Magazine {{praised the}} {{abortion}} storyline, {{saying that the}} show [...] "was brave enough to do what almost no other series will: show this one particular, totally legal medical procedure on TV" [...] and that the abortion was [...] "the only plausible resolution" [...] for Yang's pregnancy. Tanner Stransky, also of Entertainment Weekly, said of Yang's actions after Owen's affair: [...] "It alternately seems silly and not silly, when <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> about it." [...] Robert Bianco of USA Today praised Yang's storylines in the eighth season, saying: [...] "Their stories are effectively tied into that of a patient whose ability to move forward is complicated by a complex response to a hideous past." [...] HitFix writer Liane Bonin Starr applauded Yang's brief departure from Seattle Grace to Mayo Clinic in the ninth season, which was [...] "interesting" [...] as [...] "it showed us a new side of her—and after so many seasons, that was some welcome insight." ...|$|E
500|$|The rebel {{qualities of}} the group were on show in the lead-up to the Olympics.

500|$|In April 2008, Samson {{became a}} {{political}} correspondent on Fox News Channel's late-night talk show Red Eye w/ Greg Gutfeld. She had made several previous appearances on the show, and in 2007 had endorsed New York mayor Rudy Giuliani's Republican presidential candidacy. September 2008 saw {{the unveiling of}} her debut album, Possession, and her first single, a title track co-written by Samson during the breakup of her marriage. Commenting {{on the theme of}} the song, she said, [...] "People see me nude and having sex and think they know me and that I'm available, but I'm no more available than Angelina Jolie". Later in the month, she had a cameo role on The Daily Show, in which she portrayed CBS Evening News anchor Katie Couric in a commercial for a fictional action-adventure show. In the appearance, Samson asks Daily Show correspondent Jason Jones, [...] "Hey, Jones, <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> you've got the balls for that story?" [...] She began writing a sex-advice column for the adult entertainment site XCritic.com in June 2009, having previously written such columns for Men’s Fitness magazine and AdultFriendFinder.com. Samson made her mainstream acting debut in the 30 Rock episode, [...] "Into the Crevasse", which first aired on October 22, 2009. In the episode, she plays a porn version of Tina Fey's character, Liz Lemon. In 2011, Samson was inducted into the AVN Hall of Fame.|$|E

500|$|When Principal Skinner {{tells the}} {{children}} at school that Valentine's Day is not a joke (due to Bart fabricating candy hearts with mean insults), he has a flashback {{in which he is}} sitting in a PBR somewhere in Da Nang in 1969. On an oil drum next to him is a manila envelope and a photograph of Colonel Kurtz. Skinner sees Johnny, one of his army friends, holding a Valentine card and asks him, [...] "Sending your chick a Valentine?", to which Johnny replies [...] "Yep", right before he is shot to death. Cutting back to the present, Skinner repeatedly calls out Johnny's name in anguish, to which a perplexed Bart states [...] "Cool! I broke his brain." [...] After the episode aired, a Vietnam veteran sent {{in a letter to the}} show that read, [...] "I was watching the Valentine's Day episode of your cartoon and I saw the horrifying Vietnam flashback. Do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> this was funny, this horrible experience?" [...] The staff ignored the letter and, as Wes Archer pointed out, the scene was [...] "an obvious" [...] reference to Apocalypse Now even featuring characters that resembled Chef (Frederic Forrest) and Mr. Clean (Laurence Fishburne). In contrast, Mark Groening—the brother of Matt Groening and himself a Vietnam veteran—"loved" [...] the sequence as well as the episode.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to her live performances of [...] "Déjà Vu" [...] in awards ceremonies and televised shows, the song was included on the set list for her tours The Beyoncé Experience and I Am... World Tour. John Aizlewood of Daily Mail described {{the performance of the}} song during The Beyoncé Experience as [...] "head-spinning". During Beyoncé's performance of [...] "Déjà Vu" [...] at a concert in Toronto on August 25, 2007, she had a wardrobe malfunction as her dress flew over her head and was speculated to reveal her breast. However, a spokesperson for the singer denied speculations saying, [...] "She's wearing a flesh-tone bra! Do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> Beyoncé would go onstage like that?". The video which was uploaded to YouTube went viral. Ann Powers of Los Angeles Times discussed about the malfunction, saying: [...] "As a pop queen, Beyoncé is almost too perfect... 'wardrobe malfunction' in Toronto garnered far more attention than was warranted partly because these mistakes contradicted her fiercely athletic style." [...] During the I Am... World Tour, Beyoncé did not perform the whole song; she sang several of the opening lines of [...] "Déjà Vu" [...] after her entrance on stage. During the revue I Am... Yours which {{was a part of the}} tour, Beyoncé performed a jazz medley of [...] "Déjà Vu", [...] "It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)" [...] and [...] "Bootylicious" [...] and continued with a full version of the first song. Concert performances of [...] "Déjà Vu" [...] were included on her live albums The Beyoncé Experience Live (2007), [...] (2009) and I Am... World Tour (2010).|$|E
500|$|As {{the guitar}} intro of [...] "Gambler" [...] started, Madonna {{stood on the}} side-stage and started dancing energetically, as {{flashlights}} fell on her. While singing the song, she sometimes opened her jacket and sometimes straddled a steel structure present {{on the side of}} the stage. The performance ended with Madonna jumping off the side stage, onto the main one. She then performed [...] "Borderline", [...] "Lucky Star" [...] and [...] "Crazy for You"—while touching the hands of the audience members. Madonna then returned to the microphone and started singing [...] "Over and Over" [...] from Like a Virgin. It was followed by [...] "Burning Up" [...] during which she caressed one of the guitarist, ultimately disappearing for another constume change. As the music of the song [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] started, Madonna returned on the stage, wearing a wedding dress, holding a bouquet in her hand and a long white veil behind her. Accessorized by a white bow atop her head and lacy, three-quarter length gloves, she also had a crucifix on her waistband and another hanging from a long chain around her neck. Madonna asked the audience [...] "Will you marry me?" [...] When the audience answered affirmatively, she threw the bouquet towards them and started singing the song. Madonna continued singing the song while rolling around the floor, and added a snippet of Michael Jackson's Motown-style single, [...] "Billie Jean". Balloons floated out towards the audience again as she pulled apart her veil and threw it towards the audience. She returned to the stage in the arms of one of the backup dancers, wearing a boob tube and a tight white skirt, carrying a bunch of notes in her left hand, and a number of garlands around her neck. In a self-parodying performance of the song [...] "Material Girl", at the end of the performance Madonna asked the audience [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> I'm a material girl?... I'm not... Take it ... I don't need money... I need love." [...] As she began to strip off more clothes and jewelry, she was apprehended and marched offstage by an extra posing as her father. In Detroit, her father Tony Ciccone himself did the honors. The show ended with Madonna returning onstage once more to take her fur coat and doing a curtsey.|$|E

500|$|On July 8, 2007, {{during the}} concert in St. Louis, {{two people in}} the crowd who {{attended}} the show suffered burns after pyrotechnics meant for the stage tumbled into the audience; Knowles visited them in the hospital after the show. During the performance of [...] "Ring the Alarm" [...] at the Orlando, Florida show on July 24, Knowles fell down a flight of stairs. Her heel got caught in the bottom on her long coat and she tripped down; she quickly picked herself up and carried on with the show. After the incident Knowles jokingly asked the audience, not to post the footage on YouTube although she knew they would; several clips were posted on the video-sharing website and went viral. On July 26 YouTube removed many of the clips as they were infringing copyright terms. After an initial removal spree, clips of the incident reappeared on YouTube, and were uploaded to other content-sharing websites such as Dailymotion and eBaum's World. A spokesperson for the singer said she was not injured during the fall, which she described as a [...] "mere spot on an otherwise sensational, flawless show" [...] adding, [...] "Miss Knowles picked herself right up, without missing a beat, showing to all that she is the best." [...] When asked about the fall on CNN, Knowles said that she hit her head and chin and was bruised up. She further noted that she immediately started thinking to get up and continue performing the show harder as an athlete due to the adrenaline she had: [...] "Whenever I do something like that I always perform really, really hard cause it makes me little mad at myself so I just go crazy. So they got a really good show in the end." [...] During her performance in Toronto on August 25, while performing [...] "Déjà Vu", Knowles had a wardrobe malfunction as her dress flew over her head and was speculated to reveal her breast. However, a spokesperson for the singer revealed that the speculations weren't true, [...] "She's wearing a flesh-tone bra!

2500|$|Many {{physicists}} {{and philosophers}} have {{objected to the}} Copenhagen interpretation, both {{on the grounds that}} it is non-deterministic and that it includes an undefined measurement process that converts probability functions into non-probabilistic measurements.

2500|$|After the 2002 election, the SPD {{steadily}} lost {{support in}} opinion polls. Many increasingly perceived Schröder's Third Way {{program to be}} a dismantling of the German welfare state. Moreover, Germany's high unemployment rate remained a serious problem for the government. Schröder's tax policies were also unpopular; when the satirical radio show The Gerd Show released [...] "Der Steuersong", featuring Schröder's voice (by impressionist Elmar Brandt) lampooning Germany's indirect taxation with the lyrics [...] "Dog tax, tobacco tax, emissions and environmental tax, did <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> more weren't coming?", it became Germany's 2002 Christmas No. 1 chart hit and sold over a million copies.

[...] She concentrates on one novel at a time, writing eight hours a day, every day, even while on vacation. Rather than begin with an outline or plot summary, Roberts instead envisions a key incident, character, or setting. She then writes a short first draft that has the basic elements of a story. After finishing the first draft, Roberts goes {{back to the beginning of}} the novel. The second draft usually sees the addition of details, the [...] "texture and color" [...] of the work, as well as a more in-depth study of the characters. She then does a final pass to polish the novel before sending it to her agent, Amy Berkower.|$|E
