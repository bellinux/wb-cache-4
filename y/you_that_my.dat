She replied sarcastically: [...] "Why yes, I always send bibles and {{philosophy}} books to my biographers." [...] Motioning to her then husband Guy Ritchie she continued, [...] "Just ask my husband, he'll tell <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> greatest concern these days is not this fucking tour, or him or even our kids, why, it's Andrew Morton's spiritual enlightment of course." [...] Her publicist Liz Rosenberg released a statement that [...] "None of this [...] is true. I never saw a groom walk down an aisle with a bigger smile than Guy Ritchie," [...] adding that Morton's claims were a retread of [...] "tired old gossip. It's same old, same old." [...] Morton remained unabashed, saying that he wrote the book because of {{his interest in the}} star, not least because she has made a [...] "difference" [...] to pop culture and modern culture. He added: ...|$|E
500|$|After their marriage, Montgomery leased {{his farm}} to a tenant. His wife's grandfather, Judge Beekman, {{gave them a}} cottage on the Post Road north of the Beekman Arms in Rhinebeck in which to reside. Montgomery bought some {{surrounding}} land and set to work fencing, ploughing fields, building a grain mill, and laying {{the foundation for a}} larger home called [...] "Grasmere", though it was yet to be completed {{at the time of his}} death and the tiny cottage was his only residence in Rhinebeck. He said that he was [...] "Never so happy in all my life", but followed that up by saying [...] "This cannot last; it cannot last." [...] Three months after their marriage, Janet told him of a dream she had in which Montgomery was killed in a duel by his brother. Montgomery replied by saying [...] "I have always told <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> happiness is not lasting... Let us enjoy it as long as we may and leave the rest to God." ...|$|E

500|$|Both Edward's {{sisters were}} {{attentive}} to their brother and often visited him – on one occasion, Elizabeth {{gave him a}} shirt [...] "of her own working". Edward [...] "took special content" [...] in Mary's company, though he disapproved of her taste for foreign dances; [...] "I love you most", he wrote to her in 1546. In 1543, Henry invited his children to spend Christmas with him, signalling his reconciliation with his daughters, whom he had previously illegitimised and disinherited. The following spring, he restored them to {{their place in the}} succession with a Third Succession Act, which also provided for a regency council during Edward's minority. This unaccustomed family harmony may have owed much to the influence of Henry's new wife, Catherine Parr, of whom Edward soon became fond. He called her his [...] "most dear mother" [...] and in September 1546 wrote to her: [...] "I received so many benefits from <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> mind can hardly grasp them." ...|$|E
500|$|On 11 June 1847, {{the young}} prince {{was playing in}} the library of the palace when he {{experienced}} a series of strong convulsions and died, not quite {{two and a half years}} old. His death revealed that Afonso suffered from epilepsy, as did his father. The grief of PedroII and his wife was enormous. It was feared that the shock might affect Teresa Cristina's health, as she was pregnant at the time with her third child. She later gave birth without complications on 13 July to a girl, who was christened Leopoldina. The devastated emperor wrote a letter to his stepmother, the Empress Amélia, dated 11 July 1847, telling her of Afonso's death: [...] "With the most piercing grief I tell <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> little Afonso, your godson, unfortunately died of convulsions, which he suffered during five hours on the 4th of last month; and a few days ago little Isabel was put at risk by a strong attack of convulsions that greatly frightened me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{criminal}} trial, Cheney Mason, one of Casey Anthony's defense attorneys, blamed {{the media for}} the passionate hatred directed toward Anthony. He {{described it as a}} [...] "media assassination" [...] of her before and during the trial, saying, [...] "I hope that this is a lesson to {{those of you who have}} indulged in media assassination for three years, bias, and prejudice, and incompetent talking heads saying what would be and how to be." [...] Mason added: [...] "I can tell <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> colleagues from coast to coast and border to border have condemned this whole process of lawyers getting on television and talking about cases that they don't know a damn thing about, and don't have the experience to back up their words or the law to do it.
