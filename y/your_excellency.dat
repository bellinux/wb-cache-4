25|$|I {{have the}} honour to confirm to <b>your</b> <b>Excellency</b> that the {{proposal}} of the German Government is correctly {{set forth in}} the foregoing note, and I note with pleasure that His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom accept this proposal.|$|E
25|$|During {{the last}} few days the representatives of the German Government and His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom have been engaged in conversations, the primary purpose of which has been to prepare the way for the holding of a general conference {{on the subject of the}} {{limitation}} of naval armaments. I have now much pleasure in notifying <b>your</b> <b>Excellency</b> of the formal acceptance by His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom of the proposal of the German Government discussed at those conversations that the future strength of the German navy in relation to the aggregate naval strength of the Members of the British Commonwealth of Nations should be in the proportion of 35:100. His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom regard this proposal as a contribution of the greatest importance to the cause of future naval limitation. They further believe that the agreement which they have now reached with the German government, and which they regard as a permanent and definite agreement as from to-day between the two Governments, will facilitate the conclusion of a general agreement on the subject of naval limitation between all the naval Powers of the world.|$|E
25|$|Count Benedetti {{spoke to}} me on the promenade, in order to demand from me, finally in a very importunate manner, that I should authorize him to {{telegraph}} at once that I bound myself for all future time never again to give my consent if the Hohenzollerns should renew their candidature. I refused at last somewhat sternly, as it is neither right nor possible to undertake engagements of this kind à tout jamais. Naturally I told him that I had as yet received no news, and as he was earlier informed about Paris and Madrid than myself, he could clearly see that my government once more had no hand in the matter. His Majesty has since received a letter from the Prince. His Majesty having told Count Benedetti that he was awaiting news from the Prince, has decided with reference to the above demand, upon the representation of Count Eulenburg and myself, not to receive Count Benedetti again, but only to let him be informed through an aide-de-camp that his Majesty had now received from the Prince confirmation of the news which Benedetti had already received from Paris, and had nothing further to say to the ambassador. His Majesty leaves it to <b>your</b> <b>Excellency</b> whether Benedetti's fresh demand and its rejection should not be at once communicated both to our ambassadors and to the press.|$|E

If {{we throw}} {{ourselves}} unasked at <b>your</b> <b>Excellency's</b> feet (courtesy), if we appear unsought before {{the light of}} <b>your</b> <b>Excellency's</b> eyes (courtesy), if we err in maidenly decorum in thus seeking unbidden <b>your</b> <b>Excellency's</b> presence (courtesy), believe us, it is the fear of some greater, some graver indecorum in our conduct that has withdrawn <b>your</b> <b>Excellency's</b> person from us since you have graced our roof with your company. We know, Senor Commander, how superior are the charms of the American ladies. It is in no spirit of rivalry with them, but to show--Mother of God!--that we are not absolutely ugly, that we intrude upon <b>your</b> <b>Excellency's</b> solitude. (Aside.)

500|$|I {{am sorry}} to inform <b>your</b> <b>Excellency</b> that this Country has got a severe stroke {{by the loss of}} Colonel Lochry and about one hundred (tis said) of the best men of Westmoreland County, {{including}} Captain Stockely & his Company of Rangers. They were going down the Ohio on General Clarke's Expedition, many accounts agree that they were all killed or taken {{at the mouth of the}} Miame [...] River. I believe [...] chiefly killed. This misfortune, added to the failure of General Clarke's Expedition, has filled the people with great dismay. Many talk of retiring to the East side of the Mountain early in the Spring. Indeed there is great reason to apprehend that the Savages, & perhaps the British from Detroit will push us hard in the Spring, and I believe there never were Posts—nor a Country—in a worse state of defence.|$|E
500|$|Slaton opened {{hearings}} on June 12. In addition to receiving presentations {{from both sides}} with new arguments and evidence, Slaton visited the crime scene and reviewed over 10,000 pages of documents. This included various letters, including one written by Judge Roan shortly before he died asking Slaton to correct his mistake. Slaton also received more than 1,000 death threats. During the hearing, former Governor Joseph Brown warned Slaton, [...] "In all frankness, if <b>Your</b> <b>Excellency</b> wishes to invoke lynch law in Georgia and destroy trial by jury, {{the way to do}} it is by retrying this case and reversing all the courts." [...] According to Tom Watson's biographer, C. Vann Woodward, [...] "While the hearings of the petition to commute were in progress Watson sent a friend to the governor with the promise that if Slaton allowed Frank to hang, Watson would be his 'friend', which would result in his 'becoming United States senator and the master of Georgia politics for twenty years to come.'" ...|$|E

500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the speech's poor reception, Pitt effectively promised Cornwallis carte blanche to build support for union. [...] Portland wrote to Cornwallis, [...] "I hope it is unnecessary to assure <b>your</b> <b>excellency</b> that whatever your decisions may be you may depend upon their receiving the unreserved sanction and support of His Majesty's servants." [...] On the basis of these assurances, Cornwallis and Castlereagh developed a plan to coopt or convince enough of the propertied interests that controlled the parliament to support the union. [...] Cornwallis found this task, which occupied much of the next year, to be extremely distasteful: [...] "My occupation is now of the most unpleasant nature, negotiating and jobbing with the most corrupt people under heaven. [...] I despise and hate myself every hour for engaging in such dirty work, and am supported only by the reflection that without an Union the British Empire must be dissolved." [...] The task was made somewhat more pleasant by the arrival of his son for a short visit in July 1799.|$|E

2500|$|The {{structure}} {{had a large}} {{influence on}} contemporary architecture immediately after its completion.

The palace was built between 1645 and 1650, and its construction had cost the equivalent of 30 villages. The property was owned by the Tarło family till 1842, and changed its owners several times in the following years. After a fire in the mid-19th century the palace turned into a ruin. Legend has it that during the banquet furnished by bishop Jakub Zadzik in his newly built palace in Kielce, the host rejected the invitation of Jan Aleksander Tarło, saying [...] "I'm not staying in huts" [...] and offended Tarło said - [...] "I invite <b>Your</b> <b>Excellency</b> to Piekoszów for two years, to the same palace as <b>Your</b> <b>Excellency</b> have here".|$|E

There being no iron ballast sent out for the schooners is of great inconvenience and the Navy Board have positively forbid any being purchased.
