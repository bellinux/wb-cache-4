You can be your own person, treat people with respect, be very demanding but demanding in a way that doesn't trample on people. And you don't have to give up <b>your</b> <b>faith</b> to win in the NFL. It confirmed and re-affirmed an awful lot of the beliefs I held about coaching....|$|E

25|$|I {{really wanted}} to show people you can win all kinds of ways. I always coached the way I've wanted to be coached. I know Lovie has done the same thing. For guys to have success where it maybe goes against the grain, against the culture.... I know I {{probably}} didn't {{get a couple of}} jobs in my career because people could not see my personality or the way I was going to do it.... For <b>your</b> <b>faith</b> to be more important than your job, for your family to be more important than that job.... We all know that's the way it should be, but we're afraid to say that sometimes. Lovie's not afraid to say it and I'm not afraid to say it.|$|E

500|$|For me, in my {{mind the}} {{accomplishment}} is just that much sweeter. In terms of my ethnicity, always feeling like an outsider, always feeling different ... for me it's about saying, 'Thank you Lord, for giving me the faith to believe in myself when other people had written me off.' I've gone through enough of my life worrying {{about that kind of}} thing. I want to encourage anyone else out there who feels like maybe they can't overcome an obstacle, I feel like I'm living proof ... never lose <b>your</b> <b>faith.</b> I'm seriously a grateful individual right now.|$|E
500|$|Welsh singer Paul Child {{conducted}} {{an interview with}} Desmond Child in Nashville in April 2013 to discuss his work with Bonnie Tyler, both with [...] "Believe in Me" [...] and in the beginnings when he wrote her hit single [...] "If You Were a Woman" [...] in the 1980s. Paul Child drew similarities between the lyrical and rhythmic structure of [...] "Believe in Me" [...] and the Labelle song [...] "Lady Marmalade", specifically with the lines [...] "Voulez-vous coucher avec moi (ce soir)?" [...] and [...] " [...] and you laugh {{at the thought of}} putting <b>your</b> <b>faith</b> in stuff, like love". Desmond stated that they (Child, Christy and Braide) wanted to write a song that would [...] "uplift the world, and we're so thrilled that Bonnie sang it and that it got chosen to represent the UK." ...|$|E

5000|$|Vague {{impressions}} of something indefinable {{have no place}} in the rationalistic system.... Nevertheless, if we look on man's whole mental life as it exists ..., we have to confess that the part of it of which rationalism can give an account of is relatively superficial. It is the part that has the prestige undoubtedly, for it has the loquacity, it can challenge you for proofs, and chop logic, and put you down with words.... Your whole subconscious life, <b>your</b> impulses, <b>your</b> <b>faiths,</b> <b>your</b> needs, your divinations, have prepared the premises, of which your consciousness now feels the weight of the result; and something in you absolutely knows that that result must be truer than any logic-chopping rationalistic talk, however clever, that may contradict it.|$|R
500|$|Much of {{the lyrics}} were {{composed}} by Batmanglij and Koenig in Batmanglij's apartment (a former factory building in Brooklyn) and at a rented cottage on Martha's Vineyard. The lyrics explore more mature, world-weary themes such as growing old and disillusionment with American foreign policy. The album eschewed the theme of privileged youth from their first two albums in favor of characters with adult responsibilities and reflections on the passage of time. Faith and mortality are recurring themes on songs such as [...] "Unbelievers", [...] "Worship You", and [...] "Everlasting Arms". Koenig likened their first three albums to Brideshead Revisited: [...] "The naïve joyous school days in the beginning. Then {{the expansion of the}} world, travel, seeing other places, learning {{a little bit more about}} how people live. And then the end is a little bit of growing up, starting to think more seriously about your life and <b>your</b> <b>faith.</b> If people could look at our three albums as a bildungsroman, I’d be O.K. with that." [...] According to Brice Ezell from PopMatters, Modern Vampires of the City is [...] "very much an indie rock record" [...] because of Koenig's voice and diction, which reveals [...] "the youth that he and his bandmates so often strive to shrug off." [...] Ezell asserts that, on songs such as [...] "Unbelievers", the [...] "reckless abandon" [...] expressed by the lyrics reveals [...] "the group's grasp on the genuine rebellion that indie rock ought to strive for." ...|$|E

[...] (...) Paul further asserted [...] "And if Christ has not been raised, <b>your</b> <b>faith</b> is futile and you are still in your sins. Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished. If in Christ we have hope in this life only, we are of all people most to be pitied." [...] (...) ...|$|E
