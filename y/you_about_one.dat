They {{have heard of}} other places, such as Waco, and Paris, and Hot Springs, and London; but they don't believe in 'em. They think that town is all Merino.

[...] "Just {{imagine him}} with a smooth coat of grayish-brown instead of a white woolly one, and immense curling horns many times larger than those he now has. Give him a large whitish or very light-yellowish patch around a very short tail.

Your niece, when you had, as she thought, gone to your room, slipped down and talked to her lover through the window which leads into the stable lane. His footmarks had pressed right through the snow, so long had he stood there. She told him of the coronet. His wicked lust for gold kindled at the news, and he bent her to his will. I {{have no doubt that}} she loved you, but there are women in whom the love of a lover extinguishes all other loves, and I think that she must have been one. She had hardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming downstairs, on which she closed the window rapidly and told <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>one</b> of the servants' escapade with her wooden-legged lover, which was all perfectly true.|$|E
6000|$|She {{gave me a}} look of pity. [...] "You {{always were}} so dense, Reggie. I will tell you the whole thing from the beginning. You {{remember}} what I spoke to <b>you</b> <b>about,</b> <b>one</b> day when we were lunching together? Well, I don't suppose you have noticed it--I know what you are--but things have been getting steadily worse. For one thing, Harold insisted on lengthening his visits to the top room, and naturally Ponsonby complained. Hilda tells me that she had to plead with him to induce him to stay on. Then the climax came. I don't know if you recollect Amelia's brother Percy? You must have met him when she was alive--a perfectly unspeakable person with a loud voice and overpowering manners. Suddenly, out of a blue sky, Harold announced his intention of inviting him to stay. It was the last straw. This afternoon I received a telegram from poor Hilda, saying that she was leaving Harold and coming to stay with me, and a few hours later the poor child arrived at my apartment." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "We {{did have}} the best times, Carl. I must tell <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>one</b> awfully naughty thing Carrie--she was my chum in school--and I did. There was a stock company on Twenty-third Street, {{and we were all}} crazy about the actors, {{especially}} Clements Devereaux, and one afternoon Carrie told the principal she had a headache, and I asked if I could go home with her and read her the assignments for next day (they called the lessons 'assignments' there), and they thought I was such a meek little country mouse that I wouldn't ever fib, and so they let us go, {{and what do you think}} we did? She had tickets for 'The Two Orphans' at the stock company. (You've never seen 'The Two Orphans,' have you? It's perfectly splendid. I used to weep my eyes out over it.) And afterward we went and waited outside, right near the stage entrance, and what do you think? The leading man, Clements Devereaux, went right by us as near as I am to you. Oh, Carl, I wish you could have seen him! Maybe he wasn't the handsomest thing! He had the blackest, curliest hair, and he wore a thumb ring." ...|$|E

5000|$|Ultimately, 360 Degrees of Billy Paul reached #1 on the Billboard soul {{chart and}} #17 on the pop chart. Despite the {{disappointment}} over the chart performance of [...] "Am I Black Enough", {{there was no}} reason to believe that he could not replicate the album's success or reach even greater heights. In May 1973, while still promoting 360 Degrees of Billy Paul, he was asked about a follow-up LP: [...] "I'm afraid that there will be something of a delay. As of right now, there are two sides actually completed. I have to tell <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>one</b> of them — Kenny and Leon wrote it especially and it's a definite single at some point. It's called [...] "I Was Married" [...] and I honestly think it will be bigger than [...] "Me and Mrs. Jones". But for me, there are still two singles from the 360 Degrees album — [...] "Brown Baby" [...] and [...] "I'm Just a Prisoner". But, we are starting to work on the album more seriously from May 15." [...] Despite Paul's enthusiasm, neither [...] "Brown Baby" [...] or [...] "I'm Just a Prisoner" [...] were released in U.S., although [...] "Brown Baby" [...] was issued in the UK but failed to chart.|$|E
