[...] The book was written with the help of Tigers' public relations director Dan Ewald. Anderson noted that he wrote the book by recording his immediate reactions after each game: [...] "It was fun.

Look at video games - 'hostiles' is the name given to the enemy. They're given no back story. There's no humanity. Yet they're given human shape."

When the door is closed and you sit {{face to face with}} a psychiatrist, then all written by the psychiatrist will be a proof of your madness for a judge in court.

But the game's design is bollocks." [...] The Sydney Morning Herald also gave it a similar score of two-and-a-half stars out of five and said, [...] "The artificial intelligence of other characters is often dim.

5000|$|Understaffing {{meant that}} the Armed Offenders Squad rarely had a {{permanent}} supervisor, operating instead under a succession of acting managers and short-term appointees. The Office of Police Integrity's investigation found that [...] "informal Squad culture ... gained such strength and impenetrability that {{the chain of command}} was effectively reversed, to the point where some Squad members considered themselves immune from managerial accountability or authority." [...] When, in 2003, a newly appointed Inspector drew up a comprehensive and detailed action plan to improve the day-to-day operations of the squad, his proposals were ignored until he was transferred out, at which point they were permanently shelved.

Richard Propes of ‘The Independent Critic’ writes “It's the kind of film where <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>sit</b> there thinking to yourself - How has this film not been discovered?” He further writes - “Capital I is stellar a case of a talented writer/filmmaker with a clarity of vision and an ability to communicate that vision to his cast and crew {{in such a way that}} the talent involved far transcends the film’s meager budget. The film is visually appealing, narratively involving and thought-provoking, and nicely constructed by cast and crew.” Shirley Rodriguez of ‘Independent Film Now’ writes “The gift of Capital I is the space it leaves for the audience to think for themselves. Relax and go for the ride.” Film critic Misty Layne of Rogue Cinema expresses “Capital I is one of those films where every sentence spoken has meaning.” She goes on to say - “Seriously, this is a Must Watch, particularly if surrealism is your thing. I think this may be my first Indian film (Bollywood has never quite appealed) but if this is what’s coming out of India right now, I am SO there.” ...|$|E

His trainer, West Coast veteran Reggie Cornell, said [...] "I've never seen a horse in my life, or heard of one either, go faster." [...] Cornell trained horses for movie star Betty Grable and her husband, bandleader Harry James. He was the uncle and mentor of Hall-of-Famer Ron McAnally, who trained John Henry. Willie Shoemaker once said of Silky Sullivan, [...] "You can't do a thing with him, {{you just have to}} allow him to run his own race, at his own speed, in his own style in the first quarter or maybe the first three eighths.

I found {{it much easier to}} play every day." [...] —The Associated Press {{interviewing}} Stein in March 1977 on the subject of his new team, the Mariners. During the 1976 Major League Baseball expansion draft, Stein was selected by the Seattle Mariners, who took him with their third pick in the draft. Stein stated he was [...] "glad" [...] that the Mariners drafted him, because he did not like playing at Comiskey Park, the home of his previous team, the Chicago White Sox. He was profiled by the Associated Press during spring training in 1977, and was interviewed about his new team and his unique versatility in the field. Stein mentioned to the reporter that although he had played a wide verity of positions in the past, he hoped he would get a chance to be the Mariners starting third baseman. In a win against the Boston Red Sox on May 3, Stein hit two home runs in the same game. In June, Stein commented on how he liked starting every day at third base for the Mariners. The Mariners manager, Darrell Johnson, Praised Stein for playing [...] "good ball" [...] with Seattle. On July 8, in a game against the Minnesota Twins, Stein had another two-home run performance, his second of the season. In early-September, Stein got hit in the shoulder by a baseball, which was later revealed to have caused a hairline fracture. With the Mariners that year, he batted [...]259 with 53 runs scored, 144 hits, 26 doubles, five triples, 13 home runs, and 67 RBIs in 151 games played. Defensively, the vast majority of his games (147) were played at third base, but he also played limited time at shortstop. He led the American League in putouts by a third baseman with 146. Stein was also fifth in the league in defensive games at third base.|$|E
5000|$|The album {{features}} {{songs of}} different genres. While technically {{a rock and}} pop offering, the basis {{of many of the}} tracks lies in R&B with light funk influences especially in [...] "I'm Not Moving", for which Collins sang his backgrounds with the vocoder. The two instrumentals, [...] "Droned" [...] and [...] "Hand in Hand", were progressive rock instrumentals with the first featuring an exotic African sound, while [...] "Hand in Hand" [...] featured jazz elements and a children's choir humming the music and improvisational instrumentation by Collins and the Phenix Horns. [...] "The Roof Is Leaking" [...] had Delta blues and country elements. [...] "Behind the Lines" [...] was originally released by Genesis on their Duke album as a progressive rock number, yet Collins worked up a new, horn-driven R&B/funk-inspired arrangement after speeding up the tape on the Genesis version and thinking that the sped-up version sounded like a Michael Jackson song. The album featured a cover of The Beatles' [...] "Tomorrow Never Knows", which included instruments and vocals playing in reverse while Collins provided multi-layered background vocals and sparse drumming. After the song ends, Collins can be heard quietly singing [...] "Over the Rainbow" [...] in reference to the recent murder of John Lennon; this final song is unlisted on most releases of the album (the original US cassette version being an exception), and would be the only time Collins used a [...] "hidden" [...] track on one of his own releases. Three of the most notable songs that Collins wrote during the Face Value sessions, but were ultimately omitted were [...] "Misunderstanding" [...] - later reworked as a Genesis song on their 1980 album Duke, [...] "How Can <b>You</b> <b>Just</b> <b>Sit</b> There", which evolved into [...] "Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now)", and what would become [...] "Don't Lose My Number", which wouldn't appear until Collins' third album No Jacket Required in 1985.|$|E
