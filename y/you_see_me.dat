500|$|Although Morrison {{was less}} {{involved}} in the Doors' studio sessions at this point, he demanded the band receive individual writing credits after initially refusing to sing Robby Krieger's lyric, [...] "Can't <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>me</b> growing, get your guns" [...] on the track [...] "Tell All the People".

Midway, [...] "Reunion" [...] develops a refrain of [...] "did I ... see <b>you</b> ... <b>see</b> <b>me</b> ... in a new light?", and pulsating steel drums lead to a somber, rhythmic dance section. Its pulsating beat transitions into [...] "Sunset", a song about the pain shared by estranged ex-lovers. The song's muted beat adds tension to the narrative, which Calvert interprets to be [...] "the couple's final farewell – the beat serves to denote the passing of time." [...] "Sunset" [...] also has a subtle UK garage beat, funky house elements, and {{was inspired by the}} music from Smith's DJing gigs; Croft cited it as [...] "an example of the idea of a kind of song we're all really into, which is heartbreaking dance music".
