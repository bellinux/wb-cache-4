500|$|Rayner {{described}} Scherger as [...] "the most quoted {{and best}} known of contemporary military leaders" [...] in Australia from 1957 to 1966, recognised and admired by civilian and soldier alike. Detractors accused him of cunning and excessive politicking, Air Marshal Williams declaring that Scherger favoured his friends in the service and later in TAA and CAC, and Prime Minister John Gorton famously calling him [...] "a politician in uniform". Scherger was also labelled a self-publicist, but argued [...] "...you can't sell your ideas unless <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>sell</b> yourself, and if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>sell</b> yourself you're half way to selling the ideas that you've got". The newest of the northern air bases he proposed while CAS, near Weipa in Cape York, was opened in 1998 and named RAAF Base Scherger in his honour. His name is also borne by Sir Frederick Scherger Drive in North Turramurra, New South Wales.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2012, a Starbucks {{executive}} {{stated that}} the company supports the legalization of same-sex marriage. This resulted in a boycott by the National Organization for Marriage, a political organization that opposes same-sex marriage, who received 22,000 signatures in favor of their boycott. In response, CEO Howard Schultz had this to say: [...] "If you feel, respectfully, {{that you can get}} a higher return than the 38 percent you got last year, it's a free country. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>sell</b> your shares of Starbucks and buy shares in another company. Thank you very much." [...] In addition, 640,000 people also signed a petition thanking Starbucks for its support. (As of June 26, 2015, same-sex marriage in the United States is legal in all states following the Supreme Court ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges.) ...|$|E
2500|$|After an {{investigation}} of the test, Australian psychologist Gina Perry re-evaluated Milgram's data and stated that Milgram had manipulated his results. [...] "Overall, over half disobeyed," [...] Perry stated. She found, contrary to the popular version, that there is a [...] "troubling mismatch between (published) descriptions of the experiment and evidence of what actually transpired". She concludes, that many subjects didn't in fact believe in the reality of the experiments, that [...] "at some level, they'd seen through the ruse" [...] and that it is [...] "more truthful to say that only half of the people who undertook the experiment fully believed it was real, and of those, two-thirds (i.e. some 66 percent of all) disobeyed the experimenter". On the Holocaust connection, Perry writes: [...] "You have this neat analogy (with the Holocaust). But without that rhetorical framework, Milgram's experiments become no more than reality TV. It's clothed as science and, once clothed as science, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>sell</b> it as science. The rhetorical framing is crucial to the survival of the obedience studies." ...|$|E

2500|$|Meirelles {{originally}} envisioned {{doing the}} film in Portuguese similar to the novel's original language, but instead directed {{the film in}} English, saying, [...] "If {{you do it in}} English <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>sell</b> it to the whole world and have a bigger audience." [...] Meirelles set the film in a contemporary large city, seemingly under a totalitarian government, as opposed to the novel that he believed took place in the 1940s (actually, the book is more likely to take place in the 80s or later, as evident {{by the fact that the}} characters stumble upon a store with modern appliances like microwave ovens and dishwashers, and referral to AIDS as a feared disease). Meirelles chose to make a contemporary film so audiences could relate to the characters. The director also sought a different allegorical approach. He described the novel as [...] "very allegorical, like a fantasy outside of space, outside the world", and he instead took a naturalistic direction in engaging audiences to make the film less [...] "cold." ...|$|E

50|$|Some of the {{underlying}} ideas in Brain Gym are sensible: regular breaks, intermittent light exercise and drinking plenty of water are likely to help children learn.

That is, turn it into something that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> patent, own, <b>sell</b> and make profit from. He sees this trend particularly strongly among nutritionists. The corrosive side effect of this ‘privatisation of common sense’ is that we become dependent on outside systems and people, instead of taking control ourselves.|$|R
