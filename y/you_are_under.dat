500|$|Just after 17:00 all {{was ready}} along the Allied front. Marlborough's {{two lines of}} cavalry had now moved {{to the front of}} the Duke's line of battle, with the two {{supporting}} lines of infantry behind them. Mérode-Westerloo attempted to extricate some French infantry crowded in Blenheim, but Clérambault ordered the troops back into the village. The French cavalry exerted themselves once more against the first line – Lumley's English and Scots on the Allied left, and Hompesch's Dutch and German squadrons on the Allied right. Tallard's squadrons, lacking infantry support, were tired and ragged but managed to push the Allied first line back to their infantry support. With the battle still not won, Marlborough had to rebuke one of his cavalry officers who was attempting to leave the field – [...] "Sir, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>under</b> a mistake, the enemy lies that way ..." [...] Now, at the Duke's command, the second Allied line under Cuno Josua von Bülow and Bothmer was ordered forward, and, driving through the centre, the Allies finally put Tallard's tired horse to rout, not without cost. The Prussian Life Dragoons' Colonel, Ludwig von Blumenthal, and his 2nd in command, Lt. Col. von Hacke, fell next to each other. But the charge succeeded and with their cavalry in headlong flight, the remaining nine French infantry battalions fought with desperate valour, trying to form square. But it was futile. The French battalions were overwhelmed by Colonel Blood's close-range artillery and platoon fire. Mérode-Westerloo later wrote – [...] " [...] died to a man where they stood, stationed right out in the open plain – supported by nobody." ...|$|E
2500|$|As prime minister, {{he visited}} Sicily in May 1924 and passed through Piana dei Greci {{where he was}} {{received}} by mayor/Mafia boss Francesco Cuccia. At some point, Cuccia expressed surprise at Mussolini's police escort and whispered in his ear: [...] "You are with me, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>under</b> my protection. What do you need all these cops for?" [...] Mussolini rejected Cuccia's offer of protection, and the sindaco {{felt that he had}} been slighted and instructed the townsfolk not to attend the duces speech. Mussolini felt humiliated and outraged.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{track on}} the album is [...] "Manos al Aire", an uptempo dance-influenced track, which Furtado says is about [...] "having a heated argument" [...] with her love interest. During the chorus, she puts up the [...] "white flag" [...] and [...] "surrenders" [...] to him. Another song from the album entitled, [...] "Bajo Otra Luz", Furtado proclaimed, is about [...] "when {{you are in a}} {{relationship}} and <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>under</b> a light. You feel like something is glowing on you and there is something different about the world. You can’t put your finger on it." [...] The seventh track, [...] "Suficiente Tiempo", is a description of the busy life of an overworked wife who is [...] "trying to make time for a date night". Furtado said that the album was [...] "purposefully collaboration-heavy" [...] because she [...] "want it to sound like a community effort. I wanted it to have all those layers of experience" [...] She also collaborated with Josh Groban on a song entitled, [...] "Silencio" [...] and called the collaboration a [...] "huge blessing." [...] She felt it was important to feature [...] "an artist that people know more for their English recordings" [...] because she wanted to demonstrate that [...] "language isn't a barrier when it comes to music." ...|$|E

2500|$|When he {{appeared}} before the Foreign Affairs Select Committee on 15 July 2003, Kelly appeared to be under severe stress which was probably increased by the televising of the proceedings. He spoke with a voice so soft that the air-conditioning equipment had to be turned off {{even though it was}} one of the hottest days of the year. His evidence to the committee was that he had not said the things Gilligan had reported his source as saying, and members of the committee came to the conclusion that he had not been the source. Some of the questioning was very precise. The Labour MP Andrew MacKinlay, in particular, used a forceful tone in his cross-examination. For example, when asked to simply list the journalists that he met, Kelly declined to answer and requested that such a list be sought from the MoD, which triggered a response: [...] "...This is the high court of Parliament and I want you to tell the Committee who you met... <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>under</b> an obligation to reply". [...] The Chairman of the Committee (Donald Anderson) underscored the validity of MacKinlay's question telling Kelly: [...] "It is a proper question... If you have met journalists there is nothing sinister in itself about meeting journalists, save in an unauthorised way." [...] Mackinlay offered his opinion that Kelly had been used by Gilligan telling Kelly: [...] "I reckon you are chaff; you have been thrown up to divert our probing. Have you ever felt like a fall-guy? You have been set up, have you not?" ...|$|E
