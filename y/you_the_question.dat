He {{grew up in a}} catholic church but has said he didn't have a personal relationship with God until about 2013. In his own words 'To cut a long story short, ...we were touring Sri Lanka and myself, AB De Villiers, Faf Du Plessis and David Miller started a little Bible study together in the national team. One of the sessions was called ‘Salvation’ {{and at the end of}} the chapter it asked <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of whether you are willing to commit yourself to God. On that night all four of us committed our lives to him, this all happened in a marine boat place in Sri Lanka somewhere. Months later I got baptised along with my wife.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Since you insist, then," [...] he declared, [...] "I {{will ask}} <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> which I {{should have asked}} your sister. That is what you desire?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{handed me}} the very paper which I have here, Watson, {{and this is the}} strange {{catechism}} to which each Musgrave had to submit when he came to man's estate. I will read <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> and answers as they stand.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is little}} that Ishmael Bush regards, {{who or what}} is damaged in {{claiming}} his own. But put <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> in straight-going Indian, and when you speak of yourself, make such a sign as a white man will understand, in order that I may know there is no foul play." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Mary. What answer do {{you think}} I ought to give? I wish to ask <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>question,</b> as you are the person the most concerned." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Enough," [...] replied Albert; [...] "I give up to <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>question,</b> as to {{a person}} whose {{knowledge}} of such important affairs, not to mention your age and experience, is more intimate and extensive than mine can be." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You will pardon my having asked <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> again," [...] De Rebers said; [...] "but really, {{it seemed}} well-nigh {{impossible}} that a gentleman who, as I take it, can yet be scarcely of age, should have slain Raoul de Fontaine." ...|$|E
5000|$|What Do <b>You</b> Seek?: <b>The</b> <b>Questions</b> of Jesus as Challenge and Promise (Eerdmans, 2016).|$|R
5000|$|... "Who is a God like unto <b>thee?</b> <b>The</b> <b>question</b> {{seems to}} recall the prophet's own name (micha-yah), which means, [...] "Who is like Jehovah?" [...] and the clause in Moses' song (...) , [...] "Who is like unto thee, O Lord, among the gods?" [...] Such {{comparisons}} are made {{from the standpoint of}} the nations who believe in the real existence of their false gods.|$|R
6000|$|Trethaway parted {{his lips}} in a {{superior}} smile. [...] "It {{is not necessary}} that <b>you</b> should. <b>The</b> <b>question</b> is, Will <b>you</b> stand up with me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps," [...] he said, [...] "I {{preferred}} {{to keep up}} my reputation as an eccentric person. At any rate, you must remember that it was open to me at any moment to ask <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> I have asked you now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{did not do}} so. She simply bade me ask yourself. And she was right. On such {{a matter}} {{there is no one}} to whom I can with propriety address myself, but to yourself. Therefore I now ask <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>question.</b> May I venture to have any hope?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Merry, my darling!' {{said the}} fair Miss Pecksniff, {{opening the door}} of the usual sitting-room. 'Here are Mr Pinch and his sister come to see you! I thought we should find you here, Mrs Todgers! How do you do, Mrs Gamp? And how do you do, Mr Chuffey, though it's of no use asking <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>question,</b> I am well aware.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't <b>you</b> think <b>the</b> <b>question</b> might {{stand over}} for a while?" [...] {{suggested}} Mr. Boothby. [...] "Matters would become smoother {{in a month or}} two." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, certainly!' said Bounderby. 'If <b>you</b> put <b>the</b> <b>question</b> {{whether your}} ridiculous and {{improbable}} account was true or not, I am bound to say it's confirmed.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, but {{how long}} is it going to last?" [...] Dredlinton asked fretfully. [...] "Did <b>you</b> see <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> that were asked in the House yesterday?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Humph! Well, I'm here to {{tell you}} what I've seen wasn't any nightmare," [...] {{returned}} Pepper, with his shrewd gaze on Lane. [...] "But we needn't discuss that. If it made an old bum like me sick what might not it do to a sensitive high-minded chap like <b>you....</b> <b>The</b> <b>question</b> is are you going to bust up that club." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I had {{not heard}} of the raid up yonder," [...] said the priest. [...] "I {{am not sure that}} I am sorry. After all, one hears enough. Still, it no doubt took place. Herrero's {{companion}} would have no motive for deceiving <b>you.</b> <b>The</b> <b>question</b> is {{what is to be done}} with the woman. To be frank, she cannot stay here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{expected}} {{that you would}} say that," [...] he remarked coolly. [...] "Still, our meeting like this induced me to ask <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>question.</b> If I can be of any service to you in London, I hope you will not fail to let me know. Your uncle would never forgive me if I did not do everything I could {{in the way of}} looking after you." ...|$|E
60|$|HARNESS. [Sardonically.] The men are {{far more}} in <b>the</b> right than <b>you</b> are. <b>The</b> <b>question</b> with us is whether we shan't begin to support them again.|$|R
6000|$|Barbara laughed softly. [...] "Don't <b>you</b> think <b>the</b> <b>question</b> is {{a little}} difficult, or {{do you expect me}} to present you with a {{catalogue}} of your virtues?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are not {{to decide}} the question," [...] said Beechnut. [...] "I was only {{explaining}} to <b>you</b> what <b>the</b> <b>question</b> is. <b>You</b> must carry <b>the</b> paper to Mr. Wallace and get his opinion." ...|$|R
6000|$|Your bays may {{hide the}} baldness of your brows-- [...] Perhaps some virtuous blushes;--let them go-- [...] To you I envy neither fruit nor boughs-- [...] And for the fame you would engross below, [...] The field is universal, and allows [...] Scope to all such as feel the {{inherent}} glow: [...] Scott, Rogers, Campbell, Moore, and Crabbe, will try [...] 'Gainst <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> with posterity.|$|E
6000|$|Nanda had a fresh hesitation, but evidently unaccompanied {{at present}} by any pain. [...] "Don't you still LIKE mamma?" [...] she {{at any rate}} quite {{successfully}} brought out. [...] "I must tell you," [...] she quickly subjoined, [...] "that though I've mentioned my talk with her as having finally led to my writing to you, it isn't in the least that she then suggested my putting <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>question.</b> I put it," [...] she explained, [...] "quite off my own bat." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{hope you}} will say from me in as strong {{language}} as you may [...] choose to use, that in all our dealings with sedition I could not [...] be more strongly supported than I have been by <b>you.</b> <b>The</b> <b>question</b> [...] of the control of Indian administration by the Secretary of State, [...] mixed up {{as it is with}} the old difficulties of centralisation, we [...] may very possibly look at from different points of view. But that [...] {{has nothing to do with}} the support the Secretary of State gives [...] to the Viceroy, and which you have given to me in a time of great [...] difficulty, and for which I shall always be warmly grateful." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I am {{not going}} to answer that, no matter how <b>you</b> put <b>the</b> <b>question.</b> I will discuss {{everything}} unless it hurts my people, my friends and the army." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, Tattycoram,' {{returned}} Mr Meagles, 'since <b>you</b> ask <b>the</b> <b>question,</b> {{and we are}} all friends here, {{perhaps you}} may as well mention it, if you are so inclined.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I risk it, at any rate," [...] Lord John went on--"I put <b>you,</b> Bender, <b>the</b> <b>question</b> {{of whether}} <b>you</b> wouldn't Move,' as you say, to acquire that Moretto." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{came because}} I {{was told that}} you were {{to be married to}} this man. I asked <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>question,</b> and you would not deny it. Then I said to myself that I would wait and see.' When he had spoken she had nothing farther to say to him. The charges which he made against her were all true. They seemed at least to be true to her then in her present mood,--in that mood in which all that she now desired was his forgiveness. The wish to defend herself, and to stand before him as one justified, had gone from her. She felt that having still possessed his love, having still been the owner of the one thing that she valued, she had ruined herself by her own doubts; and she could not forgive herself the fatal blunder. 'It is of no use to think of it any more,' he said at last. 'You have to become this man's wife now, and I suppose you must go through with it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Vagrant Lackalls, foolish most of you, {{criminal}} many of you, miserable all; {{the sight}} of you fills me with astonishment and despair. What {{to do with you}} I know not; long have I been meditating, and it is hard to tell. Here are some three millions of you, as I count: so many of you fallen sheer over into the abysses of open Beggary; and, fearful to think, every new unit that falls is loading so much more the chain that drags the others over. On the edge of the precipice hang uncounted millions; increasing, I am told, at the rate of 1200 a day. They hang there on the giddy edge, poor souls, cramping themselves down, holding on with all their strength; but falling, falling one after another; and the chain is getting heavy, so that ever more fall; and who at last will stand? What to do with <b>you?</b> <b>The</b> <b>question,</b> What to do with you? especially since the potato died, is like to break my heart! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{is that to}} me? Is {{your duty}} to him higher than your duty to me? Can you be bound by any promise to so great a crime as that would be? I will ask <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> once more, and I will be governed by your answer. If you will promise to discard this man, you shall return home with me, and shall then choose {{everything}} for yourself. We will go abroad and travel if you wish it, and all things shall be prepared to give you pleasure. You shall have at once the full enjoyment of all that has been won for you; and as for your cousin,--you shall not for a while be troubled even by his name. It is the dear wish of my heart {{that you should be}} the wife of Earl Lovel;--but I have one wish dearer even than that,--one to which that shall be altogether postponed. If you will save yourself, and me, and all your family from the terrible disgrace with which you have threatened us,--I will not again mention your cousin's name to you till it shall please you to hear it. Anna, you knelt to me, just now. Shall I kneel to you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Since <b>you</b> ask <b>the</b> <b>question,</b> I may say this--If Miss Chisholm has two lady {{visitors}} {{during the}} next few days, you might make sure that she sees them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Who are YOU, sir?" [...] {{retorted}} Phipps. [...] "Who are <b>you?</b> That's <b>the</b> <b>question.</b> What are <b>YOU,</b> {{and what}} are you doing, wandering at large with a young lady under age?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is my affair," [...] and Coulthurst {{glanced at}} him sharply. [...] "It is a little {{difficult}} to understand why <b>you</b> raised <b>the</b> <b>question</b> only when they had found the gold." ...|$|R
