25|$|Color of {{the beam}} (for visible wavelengths). In general, the eyes of pilots in an {{illuminated}} nighttime cockpit are most sensitive to greenish-yellow light (of wavelength around 500600 nanometers, peaking at 555nm). A blue or red laser will appear much dimmer—and thus less distracting—than a green or yellow laser of equal power (wattage). To give a specific example, a 10-watt continuous-wave <b>YAG</b> <b>laser</b> at 532 nanometers (green) can appear brighter to the eye than an 18-watt continuous-wave argon-ion laser that outputs 10 watts of 514nm (green-blue) light plus 8 watts of 488nm (blue) light.|$|E
25|$|Laser vitreolysis is a {{possible}} treatment option {{for the removal of}} vitreous strands and opacities (floaters). In this procedure an ophthalmic laser (usually a yttrium aluminium garnet (<b>YAG)</b> <b>laser)</b> applies a series of nanosecond pulses of low-energy laser light to evaporate the vitreous opacities and to sever the vitreous strands. During this process, the laser energy evaporates the collagen and hyaluronin molecules to form a gas. (It {{is important to note that}} the laser energy applied during vitreolysis treatment does not simply break the floater into smaller pieces. Instead, the laser energy converts the floater material to a gas, which is then absorbed into the eye.) The end result is that the floater is removed and/or reduced to a size that no longer impedes vision.|$|E
2500|$|When {{performed}} with a <b>YAG</b> <b>laser</b> {{designed specifically for}} vitreolysis, reported side effects and complications associated with vitreolysis are rare. However, YAG lasers have traditionally been designed {{for use in the}} anterior portion of the eye, i.e. posterior capsulotomy and iridotomy treatments. As a result, they often provide a limited view of the vitreous, which can make it difficult to identify the targeted floaters and membranes. They also carry a high risk of damage to surrounding ocular tissue. Accordingly, vitreolysis is not widely practised, being performed by very few specialists. One of them, John Karickhoff, has performed the procedure more than 1,400 times and claims a 90 percent success rate. However, the MedicineNet web site states that [...] "there is no evidence that this [...] is effective. The use of a laser also poses significant risks to the vision in what is otherwise a healthy eye." [...] A <b>YAG</b> <b>laser</b> optimized for use in the posterior segment, in addition to use in the anterior segment, is recommended for vitreolysis. In order to visualize the floater and target accordingly, the laser's light source must be positioned in the same optical axis as the ophthalmologist's visual axis. Most conventional YAG lasers, in contrast, use a lower angle of illuminating light. Whilst these lasers are well-suited to use in the anterior part of the eye, they are ill-equipped for use in the vitreous chamber, and thereby make it difficult for the ophthalmologist to visualize (and treat) the floater(s).|$|E
25|$|The {{technique}} of using <b>YAG</b> <b>lasers</b> to treat vitreous strands and opacities {{dates to the}} 1980s, when professors Aron Rosa (Paris, France) and Franz Fankhauser (Berne, Switzerland), pioneers {{in the use of}} <b>YAG</b> <b>lasers,</b> both published on their success with vitreolysis.|$|R

2500|$|In a Dutch {{study by}} Cees van der Windt, MD, and colleagues, 100 eyes, with PVD-related {{floaters}} persisting {{for more than}} nine months, were treated with <b>YAG</b> <b>laser</b> vitreolysis (n=65) or pars plana vitrectomy (n=35). After all eyes were treated, both the YAG and vitrectomy groups reported an improvement in vision at 85% and 90% respectively. Furthermore, over a follow-up period of eight years, no complications were observed among YAG-treated patients. These findings support those of two small-scale 1990s studies conducted by Tsai, et al., and Toczolowski, et al.. In both studies, a near 100% rate of floater removal was achieved with [...] vitreolysis, and no intra- or post-operative complications occurred in any patient.|$|E
2500|$|Protective eyewear in {{the form}} of {{spectacles}} or goggles with appropriately filtering optics can protect the eyes from the reflected or scattered laser light with a hazardous beam power, as well as from direct exposure to a laser beam. Eyewear must be selected for the specific type of laser, to block or attenuate in the appropriate wavelength range. For example, eyewear absorbing 532nm typically has an orange appearance (although one should never rely solely on the lens color when selecting laser eye protection), transmitting wavelengths larger than 550nm. Such eyewear would be useless as protection against a laser emitting at 800nm. Furthermore, some lasers emit more than one wavelength of light, and this may be a particular problem with some less expensive frequency-doubled lasers, such as 532nm [...] "green laser pointers" [...] which are commonly pumped by 808nm infrared laser diodes, and also generate the fundamental 1064nm laser beam which is used to produce the final 532nm output. If the IR radiation is allowed into the beam, which happens in some green laser pointers, it will in general not be blocked by regular red or orange colored protective eyewear designed for pure green or already IR-filtered beam. Special <b>YAG</b> <b>laser</b> and dual-frequency eyewear is available for work with frequency-doubled YAG and other IR lasers which have a visible beam, but it is more expensive, and IR-pumped green laser products do not always specify whether such extra protection is needed.|$|E

50|$|The Doppler shift {{limits the}} maximum {{obtainable}} {{velocity of the}} accelerating mirror and its accommodating spacecraft. Doppler shift effect on the active resonant cavity behavior is an extremely complicated issue. Optical gain in the laser cavity can only occur for a finite range of optical frequencies.
