500|$|Eminem, born Marshall Bruce Mathers III, began rapping at age fourteen. In 1996, {{his debut}} album Infinite, which was {{recorded}} at the Bassmint, {{a recording studio}} owned by the Bass Brothers, was released under their independent record label Web Entertainment. [...] Infinite achieved very little commercial success and was largely ignored by Detroit radio stations. [...] The disappointment from this experience greatly influenced his lyrical style: [...] "After that record, every rhyme I wrote got angrier and angrier. A {{lot of it was}} because of the feedback I got. Motherfuckers was like, 'You're a white boy, what the fuck are you rapping for? Why don't <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> rock & roll?' All that type of shit started pissing me off." [...] After the release of Infinite, Eminem's personal struggles and abuse of drugs and alcohol culminated in an unsuccessful suicide attempt.|$|E
500|$|In {{evaluating}} {{the impact of}} the public's reaction to Parker's alleged 1999 rape of a fellow Penn State student, a film producer told The Hollywood Reporter, about Parker's directing career, [...] "His inability to act like he cared that people invested a whole lot of money in him — sorry. <b>You</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> the 'life is too short' category." [...] Noting that {{the first half of the}} New York Times review of The Birth of a Nation is taken up with the controversy, this person adds, [...] "No matter what Nate Parker makes, ... this will always be the first paragraph." [...] Other industry insiders note that, [...] "unlike Gibson — or Roman Polanski or Woody Allen, both accused of sexual assault (Polanski pled guilty to unlawful sexual intercourse) — Parker is just beginning his directing career and has not built up an acclaimed body of work that might encourage some to say they are willing to separate the artist from the art." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, Gaga explained {{that she wanted to}} put together an expensive looking, beautiful show which would be affordable for her fans. She asserted that the tour was a [...] "pop-electro opera" [...] because the theatrics and the story elements interwoven in it were played like an opera. According to her, the design of the show was innovative and forward in terms of creativeness. Gaga wanted to change the shape of the stage and designed one with Haus of Gaga that was [...] "essentially a frame with forced perspective, and the frame is put inside the stage." [...] The stage had a triangular inset, like a diamond, and everywhere the show took place, the dimensions were measured {{in such a way that}} the box fit any stage. [...] "So no matter where I go, my fans get the same experience. So often <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> theaters and there's ambient light flying in from all sorts of places, and the audience is in different spots, and the stage is in different shapes and lengths and widths and depths, so this is a way for me to control all the light and all of the different elements of the show", she added.|$|E

2500|$|Chuck Berry {{said that}} [...] "Yesterday" [...] was {{the song that}} he wished that he had written. [...] "Yesterday" [...] has also been criticised for being mundane and mawkish. Bob Dylan had a marked dislike for the song, stating that [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> the Library of Congress, {{you can find a}} lot better than that. There are {{millions}} of songs like 'Michelle' and 'Yesterday' written in Tin Pan Alley." [...] Accompanied by Harrison, Dylan recorded his own version of [...] "Yesterday" [...] four years later, but it was never released.|$|E
2500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{rated the}} film 3 stars out of 4, saying, [...] "Real Steel {{is a real}} movie. It has characters, it matters who they are, it makes sense of its action, it has a {{compelling}} plot. Sometimes <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> a movie with low expectations and are pleasantly surprised." [...] Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly gave the film an A-, saying director Levy [...] "makes good use of his specialized skill in blending people and computer-made imaginary things into one lively, emotionally satisfying story".|$|E

2500|$|In August 2007, President George W. Bush {{appointed}} Dungy {{a member}} of the President's Council on Service and Civic Participation. The 25-member council represents leaders from government, business, entertainment, athletics and non-profit organizations committed to growing the spirit of service and civic participation. The two-year appointment requires attendance at two in-person meetings per year and quarterly phone conversations with assigned committees. After receiving the call from President Bush, Dungy remarked [...] "It was something that was really hard to believe. Certainly, when <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> football coaching, you’re not expecting to get presidential appointments to anything." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked if}} it was {{difficult}} to take on a role that [...] "so many fans" [...] associate with another actress, Baker stated, [...] "It was. I fortunately had the opportunity to work with her on her last day, which was my first day." [...] Baker said that it [...] "was kind of bittersweet, but when <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> a character who has been established by another actor, it's hard to take on." [...] "You want everybody to love you {{but a lot of people}} don't like change. In time, though, people get used to it," [...] she said.|$|E
2500|$|She is, however, {{at pains}} to stress the {{differences}} between Narnia and her world: [...] "Narnia is literally a different world", she says, [...] "whereas in the Harry books <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> a world within a world {{that you can see}} if you happen to belong. A lot of the humour comes from collisions between the magic and the everyday world. Generally there isn't much humour in the Narnia books, although I adored them when I was a child. I got so caught up I didn't think CS Lewis was especially preachy. Reading them now I find that his subliminal message isn't very subliminal." [...] New York Times writer Charles McGrath notes the similarity between Dudley Dursley, the obnoxious son of Harry's neglectful guardians, and Eustace Scrubb, the spoiled brat who torments the main characters until converted by Aslan.|$|E

In virtue of the power which has come down to us from St. Peter, the Prince of the Apostles, we might inflict a punishment upon you, but since you have invoked one on yourself, have that, you and the counsellors you have chosen... though you have so excellent a high priest, our brother Germanus, whom you ought to have taken into your counsels as father and teacher[...] [...] [...] The dogmas of the Church are not a matter for the emperor, but for the bishops.” ...|$|E
2500|$|J. K. Rowling, {{author of}} the Harry Potter series, has {{said that she was}} a fan of the works of Lewis as a child, and cites the {{influence}} of The Chronicles on her work: [...] "I found myself thinking about the wardrobe route to Narnia when Harry is told he has to hurl himself at a barrier in King's Cross Station— it dissolves and he's on platform Nine and Three-Quarters, and there's the train for Hogwarts." [...] Nevertheless, she is at pains to stress the differences between Narnia and her world: [...] "Narnia is literally a different world", she says, [...] "whereas in the Harry books <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> a world within a world that you can see if you happen to belong.

2500|$|On June 19, 1942 O'Hare assumed {{command of}} VF-3, {{relieving}} Lieutenant Commander Thach. He was relocated to Maui, Hawaii, to instruct other pilots in combat tactics.

[...] "Whitey" [...] Feightner, who served with O'Hare in July 1942, later said that one of the best pieces of information O'Hare passed on to him, was [...] "If you ever jump one of these Zeros and you surprise him, remember, the first thing he's going to do is a loop. Don't follow him into it! By the time <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> it a second time, he'll be behind you. The first thing you should do when he starts up the loop is make a hard right turn and keep turning. You'll come right around, and when he bottoms out of the loop, you'll be right on his tail!" [...] O'Hare also related [...] "First of all, remember, in today's world, whenever you take off and engage the enemy, you're going to be outnumbered. If you want to survive this War, you have to look behind you every chance you get. Even when you pull the trigger, be sure to look behind because there's gonna be someone back there." ...|$|E
