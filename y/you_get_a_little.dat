500|$|Longworth {{notes that}} the {{dramatic}} success of Out of Africa led to a backlash of critical opinion against Streep {{in the years that}} followed, especially as she was now demanding $4million a picture. Unlike other stars at the time such as Sylvester Stallone and Tom Cruise, Streep [...] "never seemed to play herself", and certain critics felt her technical finesse led people to literally see her acting. Her next films did not appeal to a wide audience; she co-starred with Jack Nicholson in the dramas Heartburn (1986) and Ironweed (1987), in which she sang onscreen {{for the first time since}} the television movie Secret Service (1977). In Evil Angels (1988), she played Lindy Chamberlain, an Australian woman who had been convicted of the murder of her infant daughter despite claiming that the baby had been taken by a dingo. Filmed in Australia, Streep won the Australian Film Institute Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role, a Best Actress at the Cannes Film Festival, and the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress. Streep has said of perfecting the Australian accent in the film: [...] "I had to study a little bit for Australian because it's not dissimilar , so it's like coming from Italian to Spanish. <b>You</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> mixed up". Vincent Canby of The New York Times referred to her performance as [...] "another stunning performance", played with [...] "the kind of virtuosity that seems to redefine the possibilities of screen acting".|$|E

So people {{used to say to}} me, 'You're like a whoopee cushion.' And that's where the name came from." [...] She said in 2011, [...] "My mother did not name me Whoopi, but Goldberg is my name, it's part of my family, part of my heritage. Just like being black." [...] Henry Louis Gates, Jr., in his book In Search of Our Roots: How 19 Extraordinary African Americans Reclaimed Their Past, found that all of Goldberg's traceable ancestors were African Americans, that she has no known Jewish ancestry, and that none of her ancestors were named Goldberg. Results of a DNA test, revealed in the 2006 PBS documentary African American Lives, traced part of her ancestry to the Papel and Bayote people of modern-day Guinea-Bissau. Her admixture test indicates that she is of 92% sub-Saharan African origin and of 8% European origin.|$|E

These incidents, {{along with many other}} perfidious actions of the Japanese {{throughout}} the Pacific War, led to an American tendency to shoot the dead or wounded Japanese soldiers and those who were attempting to surrender and not take them as prisoners of war easily. Two Marines of Iwo Jima told cautionary tales. One confided: [...] "They always told you take prisoners but we had some bad experiences on Saipan taking prisoners, you take them and then as soon as they get behind the lines they drop grenades and you lose a few more people. <b>You</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit leery of taking prisoners when they are fighting to the death and so are you." [...] The other reported, [...] "Very few of them came out on their own; when they did, why, usually one in the front he'd come out with his hands up and one behind him, he'd come out with a grenade." ...|$|E

2500|$|A Chicago house album, Virgos music draws {{elements}} {{from the local}} deep house and acid house styles, and bears influence and similitaries {{with the work of}} Larry Heard, Fingers Inc. and Armando. Parallelisms can be established between its [...] "futuristic grooves" [...] and other contemporary dance styles such as techno and Balearic beat. However, Virgo has been noted for its idiosyncratic sound, more introspective and dreamy than other mechanically intense styles from its era, Phuture's [...] "Acid Trax" [...] for example. In a 2009 interview, Merwyn Sanders stated: [...] "We were into a lot of classic stuff, Kraftwerk and Gary Numan and a lot of jazz stuff. That’s what I grew up around, listening. My dad was a huge jazz fan, so that was just engrained in my head without me even knowing it. So I guess that’s what <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> sense of with that album we did." [...] Fact called it a [...] "deep post-acid" [...] album, and wrote that despite being similar to other contemporary house releases, [...] "it stands alone, and its cerebral but generously groovy evocation of the urban nightscape has never been matched for elegance or acuity." [...] Alexis Petridis of The Guardian described it as [...] "music you might make the day after a drugged-out bacchanal – wistful and contemplative, shot through with a creeping, contagious melancholy." [...] Joe Muggs described Virgo as [...] "archetypal house music through and through: it is design {{as much as it is}} art, absolutely attuned to the proportions and metabolism of the human body in a technological society." [...] He also noted that despite the [...] "soulfulness and the spindly stripping down of its production", the album is not [...] "less powerful than noisier, bassier or thicker music." ...|$|E
2500|$|Graffin: [...] "Yeah. When {{it first}} came out, we all liked it, you know? We were little kids {{and we thought}} 'Yeah, {{this is a great}} idea, it'll piss people off.' You know, when you're fifteen years-old, the first thing you think about is 'How can I piss people off?', you know? And it's very good to...it's very easy to piss people off when you're fifteen, {{especially}} it's easy to piss off your parents and adults, in general. But as <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> older, or as I've gotten older, I've looked back on the symbol of Bad Religion as still having some meaning, but I wish it wasn't so offensive to other people, because other people could benefit from the ideas, I think, that we've laid down. For instance, what we look at it today as is just a symbol...the cross is sort of the international symbol [...] as this parking symbol, the no parking is...everybody in the world can recognize it. The cross we look at as an international symbol for religion, and it's not anti-Christian, it's not anti-Buddhist, it's not anti-Jewish, it's not anti-anything. It's simply is [...] showing...it's our way of showing that we don't like to subscribe to dogmatic ways of life and dogmatic views on life and that religion, in general, is founded in dogma and in restriction of ideas, restriction of thought and it's these things that I feel are bad about religion, it's also very bad about nationalistic views, it's very bad...it's something that mankind, as a group, is not going to benefit from; it's only something that mankind will... it's something mankind will...I'm sorry, it's something that will instill violence, and it will instill fighting, and it will instill non-cooperation of different groups of humans." ...|$|E

5000|$|Christian Music Zines Tyler Hess {{said that}} [...] "if you’re {{looking for some}} contemplative folk rock about water and its {{relation}} to God and man, then oh boy we have found the album for <b>you!</b> You’ll <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> guitar action, <b>a</b> <b>little</b> key action and a whole bunch of reflection." ...|$|R

"I {{see in the}} Gazette of to-day," [...] she said, [...] "as {{his ship}} was {{signaled}} off Deal yesterday, and with this ere wind he will be up at the docks to-morrow; so off I goes. He's been away nigh eighteen months; and I know what men is. Why, bless you, if I wasn't there to meet him when he steps ashore, as likely as not he would meet with friends and go on the spree, and I shouldn't hear of him for a week; and a nice hole that would make in his earnings.

When <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> older I think that you will see things differently. The beauty of a great city thronged with men and women is a more subtle thing than the mere joy of meadows and hills and country lanes--but it exists all the same.

[...] "There's loadin' a cranky vessel wi' grain in bulk without usin' {{partition}} boards. If <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> water in, as you are bound {{to do with a}} ship o' that kind, the grain will swell and swell until it bursts the seams open, and down ye go. Then there's ignition o' coal gas aboard o' steamers. That's a safe game, for nobody can deny it. And there are accidents to propellers. If the shaft o' a propeller breaks in heavy weather it's a bad look-out. I've known ships leave the docks with their propellers half sawn through all round. Lor', there's no end o' the tricks o' the trade." ...|$|E

"I am too big, sir; gentlemen like {{to learn}} from someone about their own weight, or perhaps a bit lighter, and {{there are not many}} of them who would care to stand up against a man who has been champion, and so I have plenty of time on my hands. I am a hard hitter, too, even with the gloves; that is one reason why Jack had best take you on until <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> handy with your fists. I do more in the dog fancier line than I do with boxing, but there is nothing I like better than getting the gloves on with an amateur who {{is likely to be a}} credit to me. That is my card, sir; you will find me in pretty nearly any time of the day, and I have got a place behind the house where I do {{teaching}} when I get a chance. It is handy in one way, because you can drop in and take a lesson any time you like." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course, I am seeing {{rather more}} of Charlie," [...] Letitia went on, [...] "but people won't take any notice of that. There have been rumours of our {{engagement}} {{at least half}} a dozen times already.
