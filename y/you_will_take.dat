500|$|Endecott's {{instructions}} {{were to go}} to Block Island, where he was to kill all of the Indian men and take captive the women and children. He was then {{to go to the}} Pequots on the mainland, where he was to make three demands: first, that the killers of Oldham and the other trader be surrendered; second, that a payment of one thousand fathoms of wampum be made; and third, that some Pequot children be delivered to serve as hostages. Endecott executed these instructions with zeal. Although most of the Indians on Block Island only briefly opposed the English landing there, he spent two days destroying their villages, crops and canoes; most of the Indians on the island successfully eluded English searches for them. English reports claimed as many as 14 Indians were killed, but the Narragansetts only reported one dead. Endecott then sailed for Saybrook, an English settlement {{at the mouth of the}} Connecticut River.
