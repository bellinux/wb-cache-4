500|$|In {{some early}} first season episodes, Barney had <b>yellow</b> <b>hair.</b> Later in the {{production}} of that season, the producers had it changed to brown, because they thought that his hair looked like his skin; as well, during an artistic convention of the show, Groening stated that he wanted only the Simpsons to have <b>yellow</b> <b>hair.</b> Animation director Rich Moore modeled Barney's apartment on one he and several other animators who worked on the show shared, particularly the Farrah Fawcett poster and the cable spool table. The writers originally intended for the character to be the owner of Barney's Bowl-A-Rama. However, after making him [...] "pathetic", they could not regard him as a business owner any longer, and it was explained seasons later in [...] "And Maggie Makes Three" [...] that his Uncle Al owns the alley and named it after him.|$|E

Hank Azaria was at the time credited as a guest star for portraying Moe Szyslak. In this episode Moe was originally voiced by Christopher Collins, but when Azaria came with his version, they decided to overdub Collins' voice. Azaria became a regular cast member in the second season.|$|E

500|$|During Bomar's {{senior season}} (when {{he moved to}} halfback), the Commodores tied the Quantico Marines 13–13. Bomar, picking up a fumble, ran 84 yards for a touchdown. According to a {{newspaper}} account, [...] "It was Lynn Bomar's gigantic figure that broke up {{what looked like a}} Marine cakewalk. After receiving the kickoff, the Marines drove steadily to Vanderbilt's 10-yard line as Goettge repeatedly completed short passes. At the 10, Groves dropped back. The pass from center was low. He missed it. He reached for the ball. It trickled off his fingers. The Commodores were boring in. Wakefield was in there. Then Bomar came charging through. He picked up the ball and with a twist was out of Groves' grasp. He came out of the bunch with a long, charging run. Then he seemed a little undecided. One fleeting glance behind him and he struck out. Up came his free arm to brush off his headgear. His thin, <b>yellow</b> <b>hair</b> stood out. On he swept like a thundercloud of vengeance across the goal. Bedlam broke loose." [...] Captain and guard Tuck Kelly was injured during the game, making Bomar the interim captain two weeks later against the Georgia Bulldogs.|$|E

[...] This group was led by the Fox warrior society chief Last Bull. [...] The small band, however, was unable to hunt sufficient food and slowly became weaker. [...] Eventually they too travelled to the agency and surrendered. [...] At first they were satisfied with their situation, but then came word that they were to be moved south to Oklahoma. [...] Along with many others, Wooden Leg was shocked and angered by this news. [...] They had expected to be able to continue to live in their homeland. [...] However, there was nothing that could be done, as they had all given up their guns and horses on entering the agency.|$|E
