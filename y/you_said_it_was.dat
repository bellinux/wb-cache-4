6000|$|ISABEL. But <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{the shape}} that made things be crystals; therefore, oughtn't their shape {{to be their}} first virtue, not their second? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{what has}} mademoiselle {{to do with}} it? I don't care for the fairy: <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> mademoiselle you would take to the moon?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is pretty," [...] Wilfrid agreed; [...] "I am sure {{my father}} and mother will <b>be</b> delighted with <b>it.</b> As <b>you</b> <b>said,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> just like a piece of park land at home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I didn't {{mean that}} the letter was funny," [...] Lina hastened to explain, [...] "only that, as <b>you</b> <b>said,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> odd {{to think of it}} coming so soon after our talk." ...|$|R
60|$|THE YOUNG LADY. Because <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> would <b>be</b> five shillings extra.|$|R
6000|$|... "I was {{thinking}} about the compass; <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> in a nice little box. They use things like that on small yachts and boats." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Carp-tail {{and round}} egg. Two noises mixed! Yo, bad water,' said Taffy. ''Course I wouldn't drink that water because I'd know <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> bad.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Were there, then, a {{troop of}} these hyenas?" [...] asked Miriam, innocently. [...] "I thought <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a solitary beast that took the sheep." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{understand}} well enough," [...] was the reply. [...] "When {{that girl}} came whistling {{over the fence}} last night <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a bird." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Come, as <b>you</b> <b>said,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> no {{time for}} fooling. Give me your word and troth to be my wife so soon as we have the good luck to come by a Christian priest by our Lady's help, and I'll outface them all--were it Mohammed the Prophet himself, that you are my espoused and betrothed, and woe to him that puts a finger on you.' ...|$|R
60|$|JOB ARTHUR. Oh, excuse me, excuse me, sir. <b>You</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> would <b>be</b> {{all right}} about the clerks. This lady heard you say it.|$|R

6000|$|... "I forced that wretched {{creature}} to go {{with you}} that day when <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> going to be rough; and I shall have her blood upon my hands if she dies." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is a {{fault that}} can be remedied. There's only one {{question}} I'd like to ask you. <b>You</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> inconceivable that any man should stop a train on your road?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The Abbey burns. Why, Nurse, {{they told}} me that <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> would <b>be</b> so, yonder amid the ashes of Cranwell Towers. Surely you are foresighted." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>You</b> <b>Said</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> {{a musical}} by Harold Arlen (music) and Jack Yellen (lyrics) {{that uses a}} musical book by Yellen and Sid Silvers.

The production notably launched the career of Lyda Roberti.|$|R
6000|$|... "To kill you, white lords--oh! how hot is this holy drink, yet pleasant. <b>You</b> <b>said</b> that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not catching, did you not? For I feel----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{never knew}} it; {{and no one}} ever knew it but you. <b>You</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> our deeds that judged us. Didn't Ben go away when he {{realized}} his feeling for her?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What?" [...] {{said the}} Mugger angrily, for {{he could feel}} that the others knew more than he did. [...] "What might it be? I never {{finished}} my words. <b>You</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a bullock." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{think there}} is another man in the district," [...] {{continued}} the matron, [...] "who would take so long to write a short letter. <b>You</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> going to be short didn't you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{be glad to}} {{have her}} here," [...] was the mother's reply. [...] "Poor dear, I know just how lonely she feels. Of course <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> would <b>be</b> all right." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{remember}} <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> those Kay's chaps who did <b>it.</b> I've <b>been</b> thinking <b>it</b> over, and I believe you're right. You see, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> probably somebody who'd been to camp before, or he wouldn't {{have known}} that dodge of loosing the ropes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! but I {{must tell}} <b>you!</b> They <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> for the King, {{and that he}} had the right. Yes they did, and they swore that they would hurt no one." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was {{you gave}} me the idea," [...] {{interrupted}} Harris again. [...] "You know <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a mistake {{for a man to}} get into a groove, and that unbroken domesticity cloyed the brain." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, it's the cow as I drenched, {{whatever}} it is," [...] pursued the farrier, angrily; [...] "and it was Mr. Lammeter's cow, else you told a lie when <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a red Durham." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, it's enormous," [...] said Lucille. [...] "I didn't know Mr. Wheeler ever painted {{pictures}} that size. When <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> one of his, I thought {{it must be}} the original of a magazine drawing or something like--Oh!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> would <b>be</b> two {{or three}} weeks before she could be repaired," [...] and Harry choked back a sob lest the evidences of his own grief should make Walter's sorrow greater.|$|R
6000|$|... "Meelissy, ye were {{speaking}} of the revolutions of this yer yearth, and its movements {{with regard to the}} sun, and I think <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> had <b>been</b> a-doin' of <b>it</b> since the creation, eh?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'If he {{had been}} worth {{anything}} at all, he would have moved heaven and earth to find her!' cried Nuttie; 'and <b>you</b> <b>said</b> yourself <b>it</b> <b>was</b> all that Mark's doing!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then," [...] {{continued}} Moon, [...] "he {{asked you}} why not, and <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> because you didn't see that birth was anything to rejoice over. Agreed? Now {{is there any}} one who doubts that our tale is true?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now {{you know}} it all, and may imagine whether or no I am very happy. I think <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> time to dress;--suppose we go?" [...] And without further speech the two went off to their {{separate}} rooms.|$|E
6000|$|Lady Davenant got {{up again}} and went to her; drawing off her glove she felt her cheek {{with the back of}} her hand. 'You are ill, you are in a fever. I'm sure that {{whatever}} <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> very charming.' ...|$|E
60|$|Algernon. But <b>you</b> {{have just}} <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{perfectly}} heartless to eat muffins.|$|R
6000|$|... 'But {{your father}} has settled it long ago, and <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> should <b>be</b> as soon as I became a partner. So, dear, you must not mind a plain man wanting a plain answer. Come, name your time.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'How I was praising and rejoicing in {{my heart}} as the dear boy was speaking: [...] "Yes, I am feeling calm again now. When people die at Mota, you know they make a great shouting, but soon forget the dead person. But I am able to be quiet and calm now, as {{you talk to me}} about God and Jesus Christ. Yes, He rose again. Death is not the end. I know <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> for those who repent and believe in Christ the Door to enter into life eternal. How {{different}} it all seems then!" ...|$|R
