Planning to present the paper at the Fourth International Information Hiding Workshop of 2001 in Pittsburgh, Felten was [...] threatened with legal action by SDMI, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and , {{under the terms of}} the DMCA, on the argument that one of the technologies his team had broken was currently in use in the market. Felten withdrew the presentation from the workshop, reading a brief statement about the threats instead. SDMI and other copyright holders denied that they had ever threatened to sue Felten. However, SDMI appears to have threatened legal action when spokesman Matt Oppenheim warned Felten in a letter that [...] "any disclosure of information gained from participating in the Public Challenge....could subject you and <b>your</b> <b>research</b> team to actions under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.".|$|E

She says, [...] "Death is not deviant, it's actually the most normal and universal act there is." [...] She is working to overcome the belief that dead bodies are dangerous and can only be handled by trained professionals using technical equipment and specialized facilities. She says {{the most important thing}} she wants the public to know is that the corpse is the family's legal quasi-property, and that you have the power over what happens to that body. Don't let anyone, funeral home, hospital, coroner, etc., pressure you into making a quick decision you might regret. Take the time to do <b>your</b> <b>research</b> and understand your options. The dead person will still be dead in 24 hours; you have time to make the right decision for you. While a body is not commercial property, which can be transferred or held for a debt, for purposes of burial the body is treated as the next of kin's property. Her highest priority changes that she would like to see in US law would be the repeal of the laws in eight states that require a funeral home for at least some part of the process, and to make alkaline hydrolysis available in more than the current eight states.|$|E

40|$|As a new {{researcher}} you {{may have}} a recent PhD degree but little other research experience.

Alternatively you may be doing a research degree now or in the near future. This puts you in the same position as the PhD graduate who wishes to move into a new field - you first need to select a general area and then the specifics of <b>your</b> intended <b>research</b> program.
