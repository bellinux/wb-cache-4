We {{study the}} {{complexity}} of consistency checking and query answer-ing on incomplete databases for languages ranging from non-recursive Datalog to disjunctive Datalog with negation under the stable model semantics. We consider both possible and certain answers and both closed- and open-world interpreta-tion of C-databases with and <b>without</b> <b>conditions.</b> By reduction to stable models of logic programs we find that, under closed-world interpretation, adding nega-tion to (disjunctive) Datalog does not increase {{the complexity of}} the considered problems for C-databases, but certain answers for databases <b>without</b> <b>conditions</b> are easier for Datalog without than with negation. Under open-world interpreta-tion, adding negation to non-recursive Datalog already leads to undecidability, but the complexity of certain answers for negation-free queries is the same as under closed-world interpretation. ...|$|R
