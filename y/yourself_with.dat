25|$|The castle may be {{approached}} from two directions. From Llangollen the path starts from Canal Bridge and runs beside Ysgol Dinas Brân. It gradually climbs past several cottages before opening {{out onto the}} lower slopes of the hill. A zigzag path then climbs to the summit. The other route starts from 'Offa's Dyke Path' on the north {{western side of the}} hill. This route is shorter but steeper. Official advice is to equip <b>yourself</b> <b>with</b> stout walking shoes and warm, waterproof clothing before climbing to the castle.|$|E

The {{sinking of the}} battle cruiser Hood has not only military, but psychological value, for she was the pride of Great Britain. Henceforth the enemy will try to concentrate his forces and bring them into action against us. I therefore released Prinz Eugen at noon yesterday {{so that she could}} conduct commerce warfare on her own. She has managed to evade the enemy. We, on the other hand, because of the hits we have received, have been ordered to proceed to a French port. On our way there the enemy will gather and give us battle. The German people are with you, and we will fight until our gun barrels glow red-hot and the last shell has left the barrels. For us, seamen, the question is victory or death.|$|E

The song was written by Sebastian Arman, Borislav Milanov, Joacim Persson, Jahmmi Youth and Alex Zaidec, while production was handled by Arman and Persson. It was mixed and mastered by Zino Mikorey.

500|$|Reactions {{to the red}} culture {{movement}} were divided.

One student quoted in The Washington Post embraced the ethos of the campaign, saying, [...] "When I sing red songs, I find a kind of spirit I never felt when singing modern songs…To surround <b>yourself</b> <b>with</b> material stuff is just a waste of time." [...] A group of retired participants in a red song routine told the Los Angeles Times [...] "We know these songs from our youth. We grew up with revolutionary spirit {{and we want to}} pass that on to our children.” Another noted that he felt compelled to participate in order to express appreciation to the Communist Party for the country’s strong economy.|$|E

500|$|Fallout 3 {{received}} universal acclaim, {{according to}} video game review aggregator Metacritic. 1UP.com's Demian Linn praised its open-ended gameplay and flexible character-leveling system. While the V.A.T.S. system was called [...] "fun", enemy encounters {{were said to}} suffer {{from a lack of}} precision in real-time combat and little variety in enemy types. The review concluded, Fallout 3 is a [...] "hugely ambitious game that doesn't come around very often". IGN editor Erik Brudvig praised the game's [...] "minimalist" [...] sound design, observing, [...] "you might find <b>yourself</b> <b>with</b> nothing but the sound of wind rustling through decaying trees and blowing dust across the barren plains ... Fallout 3 proves that less can be more". The review noted that the [...] "unusual amount of realism" [...] combined with the [...] "endless conversation permutations" [...] produces [...] "one of the most truly interactive experiences of the generation". In a review of the game for Kotaku, Mike Fahey commented that [...] "While Inon Zur's score is filled with epic goodness, the real stars of Fallout 3s music are the vintage songs from the 1940s".|$|E
500|$|Kruger {{resolved}} {{that war}} was inevitable, comparing the Boers' position {{to that of}} a man attacked by a lion with only a pocketknife for defence. [...] "Would you be such a coward as not to defend <b>yourself</b> <b>with</b> your pocketknife?" [...] he posited. Aware of the deployment of British troops from elsewhere in the Empire, Kruger and Smuts surmised that from a military standpoint the Boers' only chance was a swift pre-emptive strike. Steyn was anxious that they not be seen as the aggressors and insisted they delay until there was absolutely no hope of peace. He informed Kruger on 9 October that he also now thought war unavoidable; that afternoon the Transvaal government handed the British envoy Conyngham Greene an ultimatum advising that if Britain did not withdraw all troops from the border within 48 hours, a state of war would exist. The British government considered the conditions impossible and informed Kruger of this on 11 October 1899. The start of the Second Boer War was announced in Pretoria that day, at 17:00 local time.|$|E
500|$|At {{the podium}} interview, {{conducted}} by former {{track and field}} athlete Edwin Moses, race winner Lewis Hamilton acknowledged [...] "a fantastic job by the team" [...] and expressed disappointment over the late safety car, calling it [...] "kind of an anti-climax {{when you have a}} good race like that". During the press conference after the race, Nico Rosberg accused his teammate of deliberately slowing down during the middle stint of the race and compromising his race in the process. Hamilton declared, when asked about the radio message telling him to speed up, that he [...] "wasn't controlling his [...] race, I was controlling my own race". Rosberg reacted to that statement by saying: [...] "It's just now interesting to hear from you, Lewis, that you were just thinking about <b>yourself</b> <b>with</b> the pace in front, and necessarily that was compromising my race." [...] Hamilton was subsequently backed up by Mercedes non-executive chairman Niki Lauda, who said: [...] "Sure, everyone drives selfish. [...] What do you think these guys are here to do? I call them egocentric bastards. That {{is the only way to}} win and the only way to win the Championship, they are all the same." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Still Into You" [...] was {{acclaimed}} {{by music}} critics, who commended the song as fun and catchy, and praised Williams' vocals. Marc Zanotti at Music Feeds called the song [...] "a poppy, upbeat, sugary sweet number". Scott Heisel of Alternative Press {{referred to it}} one of the best songs on Paramore, saying [...] "There's no question that this is still Paramore, only it's better. The chorus hook will stay in your brain for days at a time, ... and when you throw in the band's newfound embracing of electronics, you find <b>yourself</b> <b>with</b> what will ideally be one of the biggest hits of 2013." [...] Maura Johnston from Popdust gave the song a 5 out of 5, declaring [...] "If there’s any justice in the world this’ll be a song of the summer, or at least of the late spring". Joseph R. Atilano at Inquirer.net noted that [...] "“Still Into You” is really directed to their youngest fans with its happy-go-lucky lyrics that are as cheerful as they can get and somewhat disarming in their simplicity", considering it better than the previous single [...] "Now".|$|E
500|$|Her second studio album, One of the Boys, was {{released}} in June 2008. The pop-rock album was composed {{over a period of}} five years. The lead single, [...] "I Kissed a Girl", was co-written by Perry with Dr. Luke, Max Martin and Cathy Dennis, and alludes to bisexuality. Perry was the sole writer of [...] "Thinking of You", [...] "Mannequin", and the album's title track. The songs [...] "Mannequin" [...] and [...] "Lost" [...] have themes of determination and self-belief. The track [...] "Ur So Gay" [...] opens with the lyrics [...] "I hope you hang <b>yourself</b> <b>with</b> your H scarf," [...] which BBC critic Lizzie Ennever believed was Perry's response to people who may have [...] "wronged her in the past". During the recording process of the album, Perry had written the songs [...] "I Do Not Hook Up" [...] and [...] "Long Shot" [...] with Kara DioGuardi and Greg Wells, but decided not to include them on the final track list. They were later recorded by American singer Kelly Clarkson for her album All I Ever Wanted (2009). In 2009, she released a live album titled MTV Unplugged, which featured acoustic performances of five tracks from One of the Boys along with two new recordings, [...] "Brick by Brick" [...] and [...] "Hackensack".|$|E
500|$|Thief began {{development}} in April 1996. For the game's original designer and writer Ken Levine, credited by The Telegraph as [...] "a {{key figure in}} the creation" [...] of Thief, inspirations came from two of his favourite games, Castle Wolfenstein and Diablo. The initial concept was to make an action role-playing game and Levine was given the job of designing the game's world and story. Levine said the initial ideas and projects that have later morphed into Dark Camelot, before eventually evolving into The Dark Project, included School of Wizards, Dark Elves Must Die and Better Red Than Undead, the latter of which was [...] "a campy story" [...] about communist zombies. The game {{was supposed to be}} a first-person sword fighting simulator, but [...] "the marketing [...] killed the idea," [...] to his disappointment. According to programmer Marc LeBlanc, [...] "The first proposal was Better Red Than Undead, a '50s Cold War game where the Soviet Union is overrun with zombies and you have to go hack them to pieces as the loner from the CIA because bullets don't work on the undead." [...] Doug Church said the game's design was built around the idea [...] "of having factions who you could ally with or oppose <b>yourself</b> <b>with</b> or do things for or not." ...|$|E

500|$|Lavigne's {{feature film}} debut was voicing an {{animated}} {{character in the}} 2006 film Over the Hedge, based on the comic strip of the same name. She voiced the character Heather, a Virginia opossum. Recording the characters' voices was devoid of interaction with other actors. Lavigne stated, [...] "All the actors went in individually, and [...] Tim and [...] and directors were there with me every time I went in, and they made it go so smoothly; they made me feel comfortable.... That was the interesting part, going in by <b>yourself,</b> <b>with</b> {{no one else to}} kind of feed off of." [...] Lavigne found the recording process to be [...] "easy" [...] and [...] "natural", but she kept hitting the microphone as she gestured while acting. [...] "I'd use my hands constantly and, like, hit the microphone stand and make noises, so Tim and Karey had to tell me to hold still.... It's hard to be running or falling down the stairs and have to make those sounds come out of your mouth but keep your body still." [...] Lavigne believed she was hired to perform Heather because of her rock-star status. [...] " [...] thought I'd give my character... a bit of attitude". The film opened on 19 May 2006, making $38million over its opening weekend. It went on to gross $336million worldwide.|$|E
500|$|Metalholic said 'I’m back…” [...] I can’t {{think of}} a more {{appropriate}} way to flow into the second track “Tragic Magic.” [...] Ronnie Radke is most definitely back {{and he is not}} afraid to tell you so.' This fairly slow tempo song obviously takes a few jabs at Radke’s former band Escape the Fate, but overall is a solid melodic song, [...] The third track “The Drug in Me is You” was the second single and the band’s first video and might I add a very entertaining video. “The Drug in Me is You,” is a nicely constructed musical performance that is just flat out catchy. [...] To me the song is about something most people can relate to, the battle you have with <b>yourself,</b> <b>with</b> your morality, with your demons. [...] We all know that we can be our own worst enemy and the only person that you truly have to blame in many instances is yourself. [...] “Trying to consume, the drug in me is you and I’m so high on misery can’t you see,” evokes the feeling that you are your own drug, the creator of your misery and if you need to point fingers at someone try looking in the mirror first. [...] “If we are born to die and we all die to live, then what’s the point of living life if life just contradicts?” [...] Questions we all ask when we pick ourselves up off the floor and do the only thing we can do, try again. [...] Life is what you make of it, if you have lost yourself, it is up to you to find your way again. [...] I got all profound there for a second, it happens.|$|E
