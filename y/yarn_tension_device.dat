40|$|Abstract. Compared {{to other}} {{spinning}} system, the ring spinning {{process has been}} used to produce higher quality yarns, but with a much lower spinning efficiency, resulted from the relatively high spinning tension that leads to increased yarn breakage rates and makes high power consumption. Thus, depressing <b>yarn</b> <b>tension</b> is essential to change the status. In this paper, we design a movable balloon controller system to reduce <b>yarn</b> <b>tension.</b> The system is automatic, composed of powder switch, touch screen, PLC (Programmable Logic Controller), pulling-thread displacement sensor, controller of step motor, step motor and linear module. PLC, the core of the system, controls the position of the balloon controller by a series of programs. Then <b>yarn</b> <b>tension</b> was tested while spinning with movable balloon control ring, fixed balloon control ring and no balloon control ring, respectively.

40|$|The ring {{spinning}} {{process has been}} used to produce fine and high quality staple fibre yarns. The stability of the rotating yarn loop (i. e. balloon) between the yarn-guide and the traveller-ring is crucial to the success and economics of this process. Balloon control rings are used to contain the yarn-loop, by reducing the <b>yarn</b> <b>tension</b> and decreasing the balloon flutter instability. Flutter instability here refers to the uncontrolled changes in a ballooning yarn under dynamic forces, including the air drag. Due to the significant variation in the length and radius of the balloon during the bobbin filling process, the optimal location for the balloon control ring is not easily determined. In order to address this difficulty, this study investigates the variation in the radius of a free balloon and examines the effect of balloon control rings of various diameters at different locations on <b>yarn</b> <b>tension</b> and balloon flutter stability. The results indicate that the maximum radius of a free balloon and its corresponding position depend not only on the yarn-length to balloon-height ratio, but also on yarn type and count.

Each yarn element during unwinding performs a complex motion that involves a movement along the yarn axis and rotation about the package axis.
