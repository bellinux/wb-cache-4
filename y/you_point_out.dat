500|$|Law {{professor}} and legal commentator Eugene Volokh commented in 2003 {{that regardless of}} the behavior of real frogs, the boiling frog story is useful as a metaphor, comparing it to the metaphor of an ostrich with its head in the sand. Economics Nobel laureate and New York Times op-ed writer Paul Krugman used the story as a metaphor in a July 2009 column, while pointing out that real frogs behave differently. Journalist James Fallows has been advocating since 2006 for people to stop retelling the story, describing it as a [...] "stupid canard" [...] and a [...] "myth". But following Krugman's column, he declared [...] "peace on the boiled frog front" [...] and said that using the story is fine as long as <b>you</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> it's not literally true.|$|E
