5|$|Denard Robinson broke Beau Morgan's major-college {{record for}} <b>yards</b> <b>rushing</b> by quarterbacks {{and became the}} first player in NCAA history with 1,500 <b>yards</b> <b>rushing</b> and 1,500 yards passing in one year.

5|$|On November 26, in {{a victory}} over Ohio State, Fitzgerald Toussaint joined Robinson with 1,000 yards for the season, marking {{the first time since}} the 1975 team that Michigan had two 1,000-yard rushers. Robinson posted a five-touchdown {{performance}} (three passing and two rushing) and became the fourth player in NCAA history to gain 2,000 yards passing and 1,000 <b>yards</b> <b>rushing</b> in a season twice in his career.

5|$|In {{the preseason}} polls, LSU opened the 2011 {{season as the}} No.4 team in both the AP and Coaches' Polls. In week one, the Tigers met the No.3 Oregon Ducks in the Cowboys Classic. Against the highly {{regarded}} Oregon running attack, the LSU defense held the Ducks to less than 100 <b>yards</b> <b>rushing</b> and won the game 40–27. With their win, they moved up to No.2 and No.3 in the AP and Coaches' Polls. After they held the Northwestern State Demons of the Football Championship Subdivision to minus 4 <b>yards</b> <b>rushing</b> at Baton Rouge, LSU faced ranked opponents {{on the road in}} consecutive weeks against the Mississippi State Bulldogs and the West Virginia Mountaineers. Against the No.25 Bulldogs, the Tigers only managed to score a single touchdown, but behind a third strong defensive performance won 19–6.|$|E

5|$|Perry {{became the}} first player to eclipse 1,000 rushing yards in {{consecutive}} seasons, when he did so in 1953 and 1954. His 1,018 <b>yards</b> <b>rushing</b> in 1953 and 1,049 in 1954 were the third and second highest totals for a single season in the NFL, respectively, behind only Steve Van Buren's 1,146 yards in 1949. He led the league in carries, rushing <b>yards,</b> <b>rushing</b> yards per game, and yards from scrimmage in both seasons. His ten rushing touchdowns and 13 total touchdowns in 1953 were both the most in the NFL that year. Perry, McElhenny, and Tittle comprised the offensive backfield of that year's Pro Bowl. The Associated Press (AP), United Press (UP), and New York Daily News each named Perry their first-team All-Pro fullback. Morabito awarded Perry an extra five dollars for every yard he gained in 1953, for a total bonus of $5,090.|$|E
5|$|The Davidson Wildcats, which {{scored the}} most points against Tech (10), {{included}} future Tech running back Buck Flowers in his freshman year.

5|$|Delaney {{finished}} {{his career at}} Northwestern State with 3,047 <b>yards</b> <b>rushing,</b> 31 touchdowns, and 188 points.

5|$|Despite those players' {{performance}}s, {{the game}} was decided in the running game {{and the performance of}} the two teams' offensive and defensive lines. Stanford coach Jim Harbaugh was praised for adjusting his team's strategy at halftime, allowing it to succeed in the second half. Stanford's rushing offense accounted for 247 yards, while its defensive line limited Virginia Tech to just 67 <b>yards</b> <b>rushing.</b> The Stanford defense also sacked Virginia Tech quarterback Tyrod Taylor eight times, denying him time to pass the ball accurately.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{traveling}} without {{key players}} Marion Motley and Bill Willis because of Florida's segregation laws, Cleveland beat Miami in a shutout {{for the second}} time in the season, winning 34–0. Fueled by the ire the entire team felt because of leaving friends behind, Otto Graham opened the scoring with a 37-yard interception return for a touchdown and the Browns never looked back. Three other Browns players – Edgar Jones, Gaylon Smith and Gene Fekete – ran for touchdowns. Fekete's touchdown was the only one of his short professional career. Groza kicked two field goals, giving him 12 on the season and tying the all-time professional record set in 1926 by Paddy Driscoll. Cleveland led Miami in all phases of the game, amassing 159 <b>yards</b> <b>rushing</b> to Miami's eight and 233 yards of total offense. Miami gained a total of 46 <b>yards</b> <b>rushing</b> and passing. As the Browns prepared to face the Dodgers in the last game of the regular season, they looked ahead to a matchup in the AAFC championship in Cleveland on December 22 with the New York Yankees, the winners the eastern division.|$|E
5|$|Michigan totaled 574 {{yards of}} total offense against Indiana, with Denard Robinson being the team's {{offensive}} leader.

5|$|Notre Dame outgained Michigan {{in total}} offense {{by a margin of}} 354 yards to 345 yards. Notre Dame's {{offensive}} standouts were Powlus (177 passing yards) and Malcolm Johnson (106 receiving yards). However, Notre Dame was penalized 10 times for 92 yards, including six holding infractions, one of which nullified a pass interference penalty against Woodson. Michigan's offensive stars of the game were Griese (16-of-22 passing for 177 yards), Howard (91 rushing <b>yards</b> <b>rushing</b> on 16 carries) and Streets (3 receptions for 77 yards).|$|E
5|$|Three first-half {{possessions}} deep in Detroit Lions territory led to zero Buccaneer points {{en route}} to another blowout loss. Lions receiver Jeff Chadwick took a 73-yard reception to the Buccaneers' 1-yard line when Rod Jones fell down while covering him. Jones also got beaten by Leonard Thompson on a jump ball in the end zone. Vito McKeever was outrun by Chadwick on the Lions' third score. James Wilder had 130 <b>yards</b> <b>rushing</b> and 71 yards receiving for the Buccaneers.|$|E
5|$|With his {{performance}} against Indiana, Robinson {{became the first}} player in Division I FBS history to have two regular season games with 200 <b>yards</b> <b>rushing</b> and 200 yards passing. Seven others have accomplished the feat (including Pat White, Vince Young and Antwaan Randle El), but none have done so {{more than once in}} the regular season.

5|$|Against Arkansas, Cody {{dominated}} Razorbacks center Jonathan Luigs—the 2007 Rimington Trophy winner—and {{helped the}} Crimson Tide to a 49–14 win. In a memorable {{play on a}} fourth-and-goal from the 1-yard line {{late in the first}} half, Cody blasted past Luigs and left guard Wade Grayson to grab running back Michael Smith before he could reach the end zone. In Alabama's rout over Georgia at Sanford Stadium, Cody was instrumental in holding Doak Walker award candidate Knowshon Moreno to just 34 <b>yards</b> <b>rushing.</b> In the seventh game of the season against Ole Miss, he received a knee injury during the third quarter which sidelined him for two weeks.|$|E
5|$|Blount {{started off}} the 2011 season with only 5 carries for 15 yards against the Detroit Lions. The next week Blount {{reestablished}} his strong running ability with 13 carries for 71 {{yards and two}} touchdowns against the Minnesota Vikings. This includes the game-winning touchdown with 30 seconds left to play. In a Week 5 against the 49ers, Blount injured his knee after accumulating only 15 <b>yards</b> <b>rushing</b> and was forced to miss weeks 6 and 7. Blount would ultimately return for the matchup with the New Orleans Saints. On November 20, 2011, Blount broke free from eight Green Bay Packers tacklers and scored on a 54-yard touchdown run.|$|E
5|$|Denard Robinson had {{perhaps his}} worst game {{up to this}} point in the season: he threw three interceptions and was held to only 84 <b>yards</b> <b>rushing.</b> This marked the first time that Michigan State had {{defeated}} Michigan {{three years in a row}} since they accomplished this feat from 1965–1967. The announced crowd of 113,065 was, at the time, the second largest crowd ever at Michigan Stadium. As a testament to Michigan's ongoing kicking woes, the field goal in the first half was Michigan's first attempt since the game against UMass and the first converted kick since the game against Connecticut.|$|E
