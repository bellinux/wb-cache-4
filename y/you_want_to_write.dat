25|$|Canadian {{pianist and}} musical thinker Glenn Gould {{composed}} So <b>You</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Write</b> a Fugue?, a full-scale fugue set to a text that cleverly explicates its own musical form.|$|E
25|$|As a teenager, Gould wrote {{chamber music}} and piano {{works in the}} style of the Second Viennese school of composition. His only {{significant}} work was the String Quartet, Op. 1, which he finished when he was in his 20s, and perhaps his cadenzas to Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 1. Later works include the Lieberson Madrigal (SATB and piano), and So <b>You</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Write</b> a Fugue? (SATB with piano or string quartet accompaniment). The majority of his work is published by Schott Music. The recording Glenn Gould: The Composer contains his original works.|$|E

[...] "You <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>write,</b> and <b>you</b> tried <b>to</b> <b>write,</b> and you had nothing in you <b>to</b> <b>write</b> about. What did you have in you?--some childish notions, a few half-baked sentiments, a lot of undigested beauty, a great black mass of ignorance, a heart filled to {{bursting}} with love, and an ambition as big as your love and as futile as your ignorance. And <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>write!</b> Why, you're just {{on the edge of}} beginning to get something in <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> about. <b>You</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> create beauty, but how could you when you knew nothing about the nature of beauty? <b>You</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> about life when you knew nothing of the essential characteristics of life. <b>You</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> about the world and the scheme of existence when the world was a Chinese puzzle to you and all that you could have written would have been about what you did not know of the scheme of existence. But cheer up, Martin, my boy. You'll write yet. You know a little, a very little, and you're on the right road now to know more. Some day, if you're lucky, you may come pretty close to knowing all that may be known. Then you will write." ...|$|R

He tries to write 1,000 words a day. Commenting on the rigidity of his routine, Chabon said, [...] "There have been plenty of self-destructive rebel-angel novelists over the years, but writing is about getting your work done and getting your work done every day. If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> novels, they take a long time, and they're big, {{and they have a}} lot of words in them.... The best environment, at least for me, is a very stable, structured kind of life." ...|$|E
500|$|Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club {{labeled the}} duet as [...] "eminently danceable paean to {{forbidden}} love". Lyrically, the couple proclaims their eternal fealty, make {{out in a}} Lexus and acknowledge {{the world that the}} romantic relationship between them is only their business. According to Billboards reviewer, in lines like [...] "you'll always be the one I want to come home to" [...] and [...] "you'll always be my baby", [...] "it makes the beyond-complicated circumstances of their history impossible to ignore." [...] Stacy-Ann Ellis of Vibe magazine, wrote that the song, like the couple’s first post-makeup collaboration, [...] "Birthday Cake (Remix)", is about the history they share and [...] "refuse to let go of—it’ll irk some people". Digital Spy's Robert Copsey noted that vocally Brown does his best to achieve a Jackson impression. Robert Leedham of Drowned in Sound stated that [...] "Nobody's Business" [...] "makes <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> a long, worthy think piece so you can come to terms with your own moral standing on it." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{spending}} {{two years}} on tour promoting Brown Sugar, D'Angelo found himself stuck with writer's block. On the setback, D'Angelo later stated [...] "The thing about writer's block is that <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> so f---king bad, [...] the songs don't come out that way. They come from life. So you've got to live to write." [...] During this time, he generally released cover versions and remakes, including a cover-collaboration with Erykah Badu of the Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell duet song [...] "Your Precious Love" [...] for the soundtrack to High School High (1996). D'Angelo also covered Prince's [...] "She's Always in My Hair" [...] for the Scream 2 soundtrack (1997), {{as well as the}} Ohio Players' [...] "Heaven Must Be Like This" [...] for the Down in the Delta soundtrack (1998). He also appeared on a duet, [...] "Nothing Even Matters", with Lauryn Hill for her debut solo album The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998). He also spent the time lifting weights, smoking weed, and making music.|$|E

500|$|On February 1, 2008, Bako {{signed a}} minor league {{contract}} with an invitation to spring training with the Cincinnati Reds. At the end of spring training, he {{was added to the}} 40-man roster. Though he batted only [...]217, Bako appeared in a career-high 99 games in 2008, hitting six home runs and notching 35 RBIs. On January 30, 2009, the Chicago Cubs signed Bako to a one-year contract. However, he was unconditionally released near the end of spring training. On May 18, Bako signed {{a minor league}} deal with the Philadelphia Phillies, and was called up from the Reading Phillies to the Major League roster on June 9. He became the Phillies only backup catcher when the Phillies waived [...] "folk hero" [...] Chris Coste on July 10; Coste had broken into the big leagues {{for the first time with}} Philadelphia at age 33. The next day, Bako came to the plate in the bottom of the ninth inning against Pittsburgh Pirates closer Matt Capps with the score tied, 7–7; the Phillies had been behind by four runs before home runs by Matt Stairs and Ryan Howard tied the game. With the bases loaded, Bako hit a single through the left side of the infield, driving in the winning run (Raúl Ibañez) and sealing the Phillies fourth consecutive victory in a season-high ten-game winning streak. After the acquisition of starting pitcher Cliff Lee, Bako caught all of his first five starts with the Phillies, when Lee posted a 5–0 record and an 0.68 earned run average. Bako said, [...] "With as many strikes as he throws and as many weapons as he has, it's a lot of fun to catch him." [...] Manager Charlie Manuel, however, denied that Bako was scheduled to be Lee's personal catcher, as he had done for Maddux in 2001. [...] "'s [...] not his personal catcher... Of course you guys will write whatever <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>write.</b> If you want him to be his personal catcher, go right ahead. But I'll handle it anyway, so it doesn't matter." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{starting}} qualification for UEFA Euro 2008 {{well with}} two wins, England hit a poor run of form between October 2006 and March 2007 {{with only one}} goal scored in five matches, by which time they had fallen to fourth in their qualification group. During a match against Andorra in March 2007, McClaren and the England team received abuse from supporters during a poor performance in a 3–0 win. McClaren {{walked out of the}} post-match press conference after only two minutes of questions, saying, [...] "Gentlemen, if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> whatever <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>write,</b> you can write it because that is all I am going to say.

[...] "I laughed and laughed.... That's the worst idea in the world! [...] Why would <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> a musical based on a horror story?....

5000|$|Another {{improvement}} {{introduced in}} their core design involved {{the handling of}} the read wire. Reading a location in core works by powering the address in question, as if <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> a [...] "1" [...] to that location. If the core was already holding a [...] "1" [...] nothing will happen. However, if the core was holding a [...] "0", the power will cause the core to [...] "flip" [...] polarity to a [...] "1". The small amount of energy used to do this causes a pulse to be output on a different wire, the read line. So to read data, you write [...] "1" [...] {{and if there is a}} pulse the memory held [...] "0", and no pulse means [...] "1".|$|R

Have <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> a global macro that can be used with {{different}} data sets without having to know the content of key variables? For example, in the pharmaceutical industry, standardization is always a goal. The same reports are repeatedly needed but the study data that is used in the reports is often slightly different with a different study design or different number of arms or cohorts. The macro facility is helpful in achieving standardization and one tool within this facility that makes this possible is indirect referencing to macro variables. It is a very useful and powerful concept but may not be well known to even the most experienced SAS ® programmers. This paper uses examples to demonstrate this concept, along with how the macro processor resolves macro variables with multiple ampersands, {{and the use of the}} SYMPUT routine using DATA step variables and expressions for both arguments to produce multiple macro variables. It will show the progression of taking awkward code and condensing it with use of the SYMPUT routine and indirect referencing. All examples shown were done in the SAS system for PCs, version 8. 2. The intended audience for this paper is advanced level SAS programmers...|$|R
