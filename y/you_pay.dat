While campaigning for the presidency in 2012, he argued that students should not expect government handouts to fund their education. In response to {{a high school senior}} who had asked what kind of college tuition assistance Romney would seek to provide as president, Romney replied, “I know that it would be popular for me {{to stand up and say}} I’m going to give you government money to make sure <b>you</b> <b>pay</b> for your college. But I’m not going to promise that. What I’m going to tell you is shop around, get a good price.... Don’t take on too much debt, and don’t expect the government to forgive the debt that you take on. Recognize that you’re going to have to pay it back.” He similarly told a law student who had asked what kind of federal assistance might be available in a Romney presidency for graduate students struggling to repay education loans: “I wish I could tell you that there’s a place to find really cheap money or free money and we could pay for everyone’s education. That’s just not going to happen.” He encouraged young people to be entrepreneurially-minded and to take risks, even to consider borrowing money from their parents if necessary to further their careers.|$|E

500|$|Conway {{continued}} McConnell's line {{of attack}} on Bevin's finances, specifically the issue of delinquent taxes. While McConnell's charges involved delinquent taxes against Bevin Brothers Manufacturing, Theo Keith of Louisville's WAVE reported in June that Bevin had been late at least 10 times paying property taxes on his vacation homes in Maine and Louisiana between 2002 and 2009. He further reported in July that Bevin's company, Integrity Holdings, also had multiple past delinquency issues. In total, Keith estimated that Bevin had paid about $1,800 in penalties for late tax payments. Bevin became irritated with Keith's reporting and refused to answer questions from him at subsequent press conferences; he did not buy ads on WAVE, despite running ads on Louisville's other three network broadcast stations. The Associated Press' Adam Beam eventually reported that Bevin had paid his taxes late on 30 different occasions. In an October interview with Beam, Bevin said, [...] "Sometimes you do pay it late and <b>you</b> <b>pay</b> interest on having paid it late. But <b>you</b> <b>pay</b> the taxes. ... You do {{this all the time}} in business." [...] He added that his critics [...] "could have done just as breathless a story of all the times I paid my taxes early and gotten a discount on it." [...] He also reiterated that, as of the time of the interview, he had paid all of his taxes: [...] "Do I actually owe taxes to anyone, anywhere? The answer is no." ...|$|E

[...] Williamson attempted to justify the release of the game by noting the intellectual elements of both the game and the film franchise. He pointed out: I think they reviewed the game based on everything that was in it, not just on a couple of minutes of it, just like the Saw movies themselves aren't really pure torture porn. If <b>you</b> <b>pay</b> attention, there's actually usually a big twist in them. He went on to comment that the Saw films would not continue to appeal to fans if they were stereotypical torture porn.|$|E

500|$|The {{restaurant}} did {{not receive}} universal acclaim, however. In a negative review for The Portland Mercury in 2000, Robin Rosenberg wrote: ... one expects the food at Esparza's to be something special; You might think that the line trickling out the door on a Thursday night {{is an indication of}} exceptional Tex-Mex, worth a considerable sum. Well, certainly, Esparza's dècor, an amalgam of Western nostalgia, Texan brawn, and Tijuana cheese is executed with flair. Unfortunately though, no thematic coup can compensate for the fact that Esparza's food rarely exceeds mediocre, and never lives up to its price... The bulk of the clientele resides in a comfortable economic bracket and come down to the gritty Eastside to quaff top shelf margaritas and feast on manic kitsch. The hot corn chips and fresh salsa, which come fast and free, are the height of the meal. Smoked salmon enchiladas are just wrong; No quantity of barbecue sauce (in this case, cloying and acrid) is going to improve a tough, dry brisket. The pork tacos are equally dry, but the ground buffalo enchiladas are very macho and spicy (though they will linger painfully)... The beans and rice that accompany most entrees are utterly flavorless, a gratuitous use of space on the plate. Some people like beans and rice; Esparza's doesn't seem to care. It's a troublesome adage, 'you get what <b>you</b> <b>pay</b> for,' when you've gorged on flash and formula—and yet, you're starved for a good meal.|$|E
500|$|... "We {{did a lot}} of work on {{character}} and set-up, and then kept changing the set up while we were doing the animation," [...] Hui noted. [...] "In Antz, we had a facial system that gave us all the facial muscles under the skin. In Shrek, we applied that to whole body. So, if <b>you</b> <b>pay</b> attention to Shrek when he talks, you see that when he opens his jaw, he forms a double chin, because we have the fat and the muscles underneath. That kind of detail took us {{a long time to get}} right." [...] One of the most difficult parts of creating the film was making Donkey's fur flow smoothly so that it didn't look like that of a Chia Pet. This fell into the hands of the surfacing animators who used flow controls within a complex shader to provide the fur with many attributes (ability to change directions, lie flat, swirl, etc.). It was then the job of the visual effects group, led by Ken Bielenberg, to make the fur react to environment conditions. Once the technology was mastered, it was able to be applied to many aspects of the Shrek movie including grass, moss, beards, eyebrows, and even threads on Shrek's tunic. Making human hair realistic was different from Donkey's fur, requiring a separate rendering system and a lot of attention from the lighting and visual effects teams.|$|E
500|$|Unlike Music, Madonna had enlisted Ahmadzaï {{also as a}} {{songwriter}} on American Life hence what transpired was Madonna's wholesale adaptation of the producers style and sound. He explained {{that there are some}} influences from his work, but Madonna mostly wanted a minimalist structure for the album. This was beneficial for him since he did not like working with a lot of people, and hence it became a close collaboration. Since electronic music was already popular, Ahmadzaï felt that it was necessary to go back to its underground roots and focus on the songwriting, rather than the technical aspects of recording and mixing. Describing it as modified songwriting, he said that although the concept [...] "might sound simple at first, even rough. But when <b>you</b> <b>pay</b> attention, {{there is a lot of}} technology underneath". This approach was an imperative for American Life. Recorded at three different studios using Ahmadzaï's own gear along with the studio's SSL mixing consoles, the album's recording process was often laborious but was sparse in the musical arrangements of the songs. About the musical composition, Ahmadzaï told to Remix magazine that they [...] "tried to under-produce many tracks to make them sound rougher than the average international pop production. We wanted to do something totally modern and futuristic but not very apparent. You have to be very minimalist and choose every sound very carefully. Some tracks were composed in the big studio; that can be very dangerous because you can lose perspective. But all initial directions of the tracks were made in my home studio." ...|$|E
