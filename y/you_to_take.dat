25|$|I {{have written}} this letter {{to you on}} a happy day to me, {{which is also the}} last day of my life. For I have been {{attacked}} by a painful inability to urinate, and also dysentery, so violent that nothing can be added to the violence of my sufferings. But the cheerfulness of my mind, which comes from the recollection of all my philosophical contemplation, counterbalances all these afflictions. And I beg <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> care of the children of Metrodorus, in a manner worthy of the devotion shown by the young man to me, and to philosophy.|$|E
25|$|I deem it {{important}} to direct your attention to Article 2 of the Constitutional Amendments of the United States—'the {{right of the people}} to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.' This you should comply with immediately. Every (local) union should have a rifle club. I strongly advise you to provide every member with the latest improved rifle, which can be obtained from the factory at a nominal price. I entreat <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> action on this important question, so that in two years we can hear the inspiring music of the martial tread of 25,000 armed men in the ranks of labor.|$|E
25|$|O People, {{just as you}} {{regard this}} month, this day, this city as Sacred, so regard the life and {{property}} of every Muslim as a sacred trust. Return the goods entrusted to you to their rightful owners. Hurt no one {{so that no one}} may hurt you. Remember that you will indeed meet your LORD, and that HE will indeed reckon your deeds. ALLAH has forbidden <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> usury (interest), therefore all interest obligation shall henceforth be waived. Your capital, however, is yours to keep. You will neither inflict nor suffer any inequity. Allah has Judged that there shall be no interest and that all the interest due to Abbas ibn 'Abd'al Muttalib (Prophet's uncle) shall henceforth be waived...|$|E

25|$|I {{will say}} {{to you and to}} the colored race that men who bore arms and {{followed}} the flag of the Confederacy are, with very few exceptions, your friends. I have an opportunity of saying what I have always felt – that I am your friend, for my interests are your interests, and your interests are my interests. We were born on the same soil, breathe the same air, and live in the same land. Why, then, can we not live as brothers? I will say that when the war broke out I felt it my duty to stand by my people. When the time came I did the best I could, and I don't believe I flickered. I came here with the jeers of some white people, who think that I am doing wrong. I believe that I can exert some influence, and do much to assist the people in strengthening fraternal relations, and shall do all in my power to bring about peace. It has always been my motto to elevate every man- to depress none. (Applause.) I want to elevate <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> positions in law offices, in stores, on farms, and wherever you are capable of going.|$|E
500|$|During its {{marketing}} campaign, 12 Years a Slave received unpaid endorsements by celebrities such as Kanye West and Sean Combs. In a video posted by Revolt, Combs urged viewers to see 12 Years a Slave by stating: [...] "This movie is very painful but very honest, {{and is a}} part of the healing process. I beg all of <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> your kids, everybody to see it.... You have to see this so you can understand, so you can just start to understand." ...|$|E
500|$|As Frances Cleveland {{left the}} White House, {{she told a}} staff member, [...] "Now, Jerry, I want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> good {{care of all the}} {{furniture}} and ornaments in the house, for I want to find everything just as it is now, when we come back again." [...] When asked when she would return, she responded, [...] "We are coming back four years from today." [...] In the meantime, the Clevelands moved to New York City where Cleveland took a position with the law firm of Bangs, Stetson, Tracy, and MacVeigh. This affiliation was more of an office sharing arrangement, though quite compatible. Cleveland's law practice brought only a moderate income, perhaps because Cleveland spent considerable time at the couple's vacation home Gray Gables at Buzzard Bay, where fishing became his obsession. While they lived in New York, the Clevelands' first child, Ruth, was born in 1891.|$|E

500|$|The {{rehearsal}} {{process is}} really understated. It's funny because it's not really needed. It's not needed for us anyway. Because {{we know how}} to play the songs, and the [...] charts don't change the songs structurally at all. But the symphony charts are something that you're not used to hearing. And then the symphony doesn't need the rehearsal because they sight-read. They sight-read better than we could even imagine. So when we get there, they already know how to play our songs better than we do... The purpose of the rehearsal is really, honestly to prepare the band for exactly how powerful the concert is going to be. When the symphony jumps in during those moments where all of a sudden you're singing a song you sing every night and then 30 more musicians start playing, it's so powerful that it causes <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> pause, and you can't take pause. And that's what the rehearsal really is for.|$|E
500|$|Lydiard's next {{opportunity}} to distinguish himself came in June 1796. On 9 June a French corvette was sighted entering Hyères bay, and Vice-Admiral Sir John Jervis, {{commander of the}} Mediterranean Fleet, summoned Macnamara to his flagship, [...] He asked Macnamara {{to bring out the}} French ship if he could. Recognising the difficulty and risk that would be involved, he did not make it a formal written order, instead instructing Macnamara 'bring out the enemy's ship if you can; I'll give you no written order; but I direct <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> care of the king's ship under your command.' Macnamara promptly took his ship in under the guns of the batteries, and apparently having been mistaken for a French or neutral frigate, closed to within pistol shot of the French ship, and demanded her captain surrender. The captain replied with a broadside, and Macnamara brought Southampton alongside and sent Lydiard over in command of the boarders. [...] After subduing fierce resistance Lydiard took possession of the French ship and together he and Macnamara escaped out to sea under heavy fire from the French shore batteries. Macnamara {{wrote in a letter to}} Jervis ...|$|E
500|$|When {{the head}} of {{household}} finds a suitable tree, he {{stands in front of}} it facing east. After throwing grain at the tree, he greets it with the words [...] "Good morning and happy Christmas Eve to you", makes the Sign of the Cross, says a prayer, and kisses the tree. He may also explain to the badnjak why it will be cut: [...] "I have come to <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> to my home, to be my faithful helper to every progress and improvement, in the house, in the pen, in the field, and in every place." [...] He then cuts it slantwise on its eastern side, using an axe. Some men put gloves on before they start to cut the tree, and from then on never touch the badnjak with their bare hands. The tree should fall to the east, unhindered by surrounding trees. It must not be left half-cut, as then it will curse the house of the man. In some regions, if the tree is not cut down after the third blow of the axe, then it must be pulled and twisted until its trunk breaks. The resulting badnjak has a so-called [...] "beard", the part of the trunk at which it broke off {{from the base of the}} tree. In Šumadija, half of a circular loaf of bread is left on the stump, the other half being eaten on the way back home. In Zagarač, the stump is covered with moss or dry leaves, and it will be visited again in spring: the stump sprouting through the cover is an omen of good luck and prosperity.|$|E

What can you get by war, when we can hide our provisions and fly to the woods? Whereby you must famish by wronging us your friends.

2500|$|After Smith officiated in Brigham Young's {{endowment}} in 1842 Smith told him, [...] "Brother Brigham, {{this is not}} arranged perfectly; however we {{have done}} {{the best we could}} under the circumstances in which we are placed. I wish <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> this matter in hand: organize and systematize all these ceremonies". Young did as Smith directed, and under Young's direction the Nauvoo endowment ceremony was introduced to the church at large in the Nauvoo Temple during the winter of 184546. A spacious hall in the temple's attic was arranged into appropriate ordinance [...] "rooms" [...] using canvas partitions. Potted plants were used in areas representing the Garden of Eden, and other areas were furnished appropriately, including a room representing the celestial kingdom. Over 5,500 persons received their endowments in this temple.|$|E

Abagnale was told the bar needed more lawyers and was offered a chance to apply. After making a fake transcript from Harvard, he prepared himself for the compulsory exam. Despite failing twice, he claims to have passed the bar exam legitimately on the third try after eight weeks of study, because [...] "Louisiana, at the time, allowed <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the Bar over and over as many times as you needed. It was really a matter of eliminating what you got wrong." ...|$|E

2500|$|On October 1, 2011, Douglas County, Colorado, sheriff's deputies arrested Davis in Highlands Park, Colorado, at the Town Center in Highlands Ranch, for third-degree {{assault and}} disorderly conduct, both misdemeanors, {{stemming}} from a dispute between Davis and 50-year-old Jeff Maes about a parking space. Maes and his family got to a parking spot first and parked in it. A witness told police that Davis then confronted Maes and said, [...] "I was waiting for that spot and it wasn't right for <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> it." [...] When Maes refused to move, Davis struck Maes. The blow sent Maes to the ground. Davis was released on a $1,750 bail bond. When prosecutors later learned that Maes may have suffered a broken vertebra in the incident, they increased one {{of the charges against}} Davis to second-degree assault (a felony), a crime of violence that carries a five-year mandatory minimum, and Davis's bond was raised to $10,000. Neither Maes nor a third man present at the scene have been charged in the incident. Davis later pleaded guilty to misdemeanor third-degree assault and received a two-year probationary sentence.|$|E
