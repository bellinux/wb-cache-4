The total was again the highest in the CSU system, as well as one of the highest among all universities in the nation. In addition to being one of the three impacted CSU schools for both freshmen and transfers, the lack of state funding due to California's continuing budget crisis meant that CSULB could only offer admission to 25,142 (31.5%) of the applicants; that again marked the lowest percentage in school history.

25|$|VATS (video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery) is a minimally-invasive {{technique}} to resect lung nodules that saves the patient {{the trauma of}} a thoracotomy. Thereby, small ports are used to access the pulmonary lobes and introduce a camera on a thoracoscope, along with the necessary instruments. While this procedure speeds up recovery and potentially reduces complications, the loss of natural vision and tactile sensing {{makes it difficult for}} the surgeon to locate the nodules, especially in cases of non-superficial, ground-glass opaque, and small lesions. The <b>yield</b> <b>rate</b> for nodules < 1nbsp&cm can be below 40% as studies show. As a consequence sometimes more healthy tissue is resected than actually necessary in order to avoid missing (parts of) the lesion. Using advanced intra-operative imaging in the OR helps to precisely locate and resect the lesion in a potentially tissue-sparing and quick fashion. In {{order to be able to}} use image guidance during VATS, rotational angiography has to be performed before the introduction of ports, thus before the lobe in question deflates. This way the lesion is visible through the natural contrast of air. In a second step, hook wires, thread needles, or contrast agent (Lipiodol, Iopamidol) are introduced into or next to the lesion to ensure visibility on the angiogram after lung deflation. Then, the conventional part of VATS starts with the introduction of thoracoscopes. The imaging system is used in fluoroscopic mode now, where both the inserted instruments and the previously marked lesion are well visible. A precise resection is now possible. In case contrast agent has been used to mark the lesion, it will also drain into the regional lymph nodes, which then can be resected within the same procedure.|$|E
