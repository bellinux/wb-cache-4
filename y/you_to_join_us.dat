6000|$|... "Then {{come into}} the drawing-room for a few minutes, will you?" [...] Lord Langerdale said. [...] "Good-night, Eugène! No use asking <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>us,</b> I know." ...|$|E
60|$|SECRETARY--[Sharply.] Just {{what was}} it made <b>you</b> want <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>us?</b> Come out with that straight.|$|R

6000|$|Eddie Klemm called, with business-like cordiality: [...] "H'lo, Fatty! Come in. How's {{your good}} health? Haven't reformed, have <b>you?</b> Going <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>us</b> rough-necks? Come on; I'll teach <b>you</b> <b>to</b> play pool. Won't {{cost you a}} cent." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is enough}} for me that we have got it," [...] resumed Mr. Tredgold. [...] "Now, we want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>us</b> in fitting out a ship and {{recovering}} the treasure. Equal expenses; equal shares." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{are both}} in the cabin. I {{was going to ask}} <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>us,</b> in a general talk," [...] said Sack Todd, {{catching}} his cue from Gasper Pold as to how best to proceed.|$|E
60|$|THE BISHOP. Not at all. [He {{opens the}} study door and calls] Soames! Anthony! [To Mrs George] Call him Father: he likes it. [Soames {{appears at the}} study door]. Mrs Collins wishes <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>us,</b> Anthony.|$|E

[...] "However, you have barely time to get into dry things before supper will be ready. We expect <b>you</b> all <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>us,</b> prairie fashion." ...|$|R
40|$|No, this is {{not coming}} from the church but it {{is related to the}} theme of this issue. There’s a great deal to be thankful for but there is not enough time in the day or in the month of November 2013. What a memorable month it will be. Our Spotlight is on the 2014 Annual Meeting. We hope <b>you</b> plan <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>us</b> in the sunny city of Sa...|$|R
2500|$|Giuliani {{continued}} {{to maintain that}} his strategy of focusing on later, larger primaries would result in his winning the nomination. Before the New Hampshire votes had been counted, Giuliani's campaign moved to Florida {{in preparation for the}} state's January 29 primary. [...] "I want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> come <b>join</b> <b>us</b> there and help us", he said. [...] "And help us in Connecticut. Help us in New York. Help us in New Jersey." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Acton laughed. [...] "Oh, no!" [...] she contradicted. [...] "We are {{all going}} for a sail on the straits to-morrow, and we {{certainly}} expect <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>us.</b> In the meanwhile, I believe there are two young women waiting for partners." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I must beg {{you to come}} downstairs again," [...] he said. [...] "It is Fosco's fault, Miss Halcombe, not mine. He {{has started}} some {{nonsensical}} objection to his wife {{being one of the}} witnesses, and has obliged me to ask <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>us</b> in the library." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We do not {{war against}} our own people. The Egyptians are our only enemies. Some {{of you may}} know me. I am Jethro, and I call upon <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>us</b> and make common cause against the Egyptians, who are even now being {{attacked}} by our young king." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How reassuring!" [...] she exclaimed, with a {{brilliant}} smile. [...] "Lord Wolfenden {{is going to be}} at the 'Milan' to-night," [...] she added, turning to Mr. Sabin. [...] "Why don't <b>you</b> ask him <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>us?</b> I shall feel so much more comfortable." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should never}} accept {{the task of}} forming a government," [...] Dartrey said quietly, [...] "unless I am {{absolutely}} driven to do so. I have shown the truth to the world. I have shown to the people whom I love their destiny, but I have not the gifts to lead them. I am asking <b>you,</b> Tallente, <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>us,</b> <b>to</b> enter Parliament {{as one of our}} party and to lead for us in the House of Commons." ...|$|R
30|$|The MSc in Advanced Gynaecological Endoscopy {{not only}} {{sets out to}} provide the {{appropriate}} training and skills to help gynaecologists build this clinical-based research, but ultimately it encourages participants to contribute effectively to the evidence that underpins this growing subspecialty. We commend the students for their intellectual curiosity and sharing of their time and intellect, often at their own expense, to become the thinking, enquiring, and research-based clinicians of the future. We welcome <b>you</b> all <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>us</b> on this quest.|$|R
6000|$|We shall {{start for}} Glenbogie on the 10th of next month.

We shall be a little [...] crowded at first, and {{therefore}} cannot name an earlier [...] day.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{shall be}} very glad, for I suppose we shall join, {{as he passes}} along. It has been dull work here, and we {{are looking forward to}} gaining our share of the loot.

6000|$|... "Eve, dear," [...] he said, [...] "I {{suppose we}} {{may as well}} obey this very autocratic person. The sooner we go the sooner we shall be back to supper. Mr. Walmsley, I owe you my most {{profound}} apologies. I had no idea when I asked <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>us</b> that you would become involved in anything disagreeable." ...|$|E

Seeing we was sailor-men, she told us all about it, an’ ’ow she still ’opes for him to walk into ’er arms afore she dies.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is a rule," [...] he said, [...] "with {{masters in}} the art of making tea, that one {{infusion}} ought never to be used twice. If we want any more, we will make more; and if <b>you</b> feel inclined <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>us,</b> Miss Cristel, we will fill the third cup." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! I am so glad," [...] she said. [...] "It {{seemed so}} {{shocking}} that <b>you</b> should refuse <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>us.</b> And mind and be early, Maurice; for I shall {{want to explain}} it all.

6000|$|... "You touch me," [...] {{said the}} Prince, [...] "and I {{have all the}} will {{in the world to}} rescue you from this dilemma, but upon one condition.

6000|$|... "Not so, M. Larochejaquelin; {{it was to}} seek {{council that}} I and Foret came hither; it was to throw {{ourselves}} {{at the feet of}} my Lord the Marquis, and at yours, and at those of M. de Lescure; and to implore <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>us,</b> to fight with us, and to save us; to lead us against the republicans, and to help us to save our homes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Father {{has just}} bought the Sea Dream, a {{beautiful}} steam yacht of an hundred feet in length, and I don't {{know how many}} tons.

6000|$|... "I am. It is pre-eminently a woman's question, {{and this}} is a great opportunity. I shall talk to every one. Little Pettitt, the hair- dresser, has some ground there, and he is the most {{intelligent}} of the tradesmen. I gave him one of those excellent little hand-bills, put forth by the Social Science Committee, on sanitary arrangements. I thought of asking <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>us</b> in ordering some down, and never letting a woman leave our work-room without one." ...|$|E
6000|$|Several of {{the party}} shook hands with me frankly, while the names the {{surveyor}} mentioned were already well-known in Winnipeg and Montreal, and have since become famous throughout the Dominion. One with gray hair and an indefinable stamp of authority touched my shoulder with a friendly gesture. [...] "I have {{had the pleasure of}} meeting Mr. Lorimer before," [...] he said. [...] "We have some business together, and expect <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>us</b> in the opening ceremony. Meantime, you will excuse me--Jardine, I'm thankful it is your turn. There is evidently a deputation coming." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The Major wants <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>us,</b> Bathurst; we {{are having}} a talk over things, and he wishes to have your opinion. I had better tell you that as to {{yourself}} the camp {{is divided into two}} parties. On one side are the Major, Wilson, and myself, and all the ladies, who take, I need not say, a common sense view of the matter, and recognize that you have done all a man could do to overcome your constitutional nervousness, and that there is no discredit whatever attached to you personally. The rest of the men, I am sorry to say, at present take another view of the case, and are disposed to show you the cold shoulder." ...|$|E
