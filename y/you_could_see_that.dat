[...] I just wanted to do the best job I could do for her. When we would play back 'Holiday' or 'Lucky Star', <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> she was overwhelmed by how great it all sounded. You wanted to help her, you know? As much as she could be a bitch, when you were in groove with her, it was very cool, very creative." ...|$|E
500|$|Appearing [...] "frail and {{slightly}} bent", {{she appeared in}} public {{for the opening of}} the Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace (now Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum) in Yorba Linda, California on July 19, 1990. The dedication ceremony included 50,000 friends and well-wishers, as well as former Presidents Ford, Reagan, and Bush and their wives. The library includes a Pat Nixon room, a Pat Nixon amphitheater, and rose gardens planted with the red-black Pat Nixon Rose developed by a French company in 1972, when she was first lady. Pat also attended the opening of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California in November 1991. Former First Lady Barbara Bush reflected, [...] "I loved Pat Nixon, who was a sensational, gracious, and thoughtful First Lady", and at the dedication of the Reagan Library, Bush remembered, [...] "There was one sad thing. Pat Nixon did not look well at all. Through her smile <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> she was in great pain and having a terrible time getting air into her lungs." ...|$|E
500|$|As late as July 1997, U2 were {{pressured}} {{to accept an}} offer of approximately $4million to perform in Basel, Switzerland on the date scheduled for the Sarajevo show. At the time, rumours about the region's instability persisted. To ensure the Sarajevo show was not canceled, Sacirbey appeared at many of the band's preceding shows to lobby {{on behalf of the}} city. For the stage to reach Sarajevo, the road crew had to drive the equipment and stage through war-torn Bosnia. Although the trip was without incident, they had to pass through towns such as Mostar, which had been [...] "obliterated" [...] during the war. Stage and lighting designer Willie Williams commented that [...] "when the truck drivers arrived <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> they were changed men". The only trouble in transporting the stage came when a border control agent prevented them from crossing the border for hours. The trucks reached Sarajevo two days prior to the concert, arriving to the cheers and applause of the city's residents; their arrival was the first concrete evidence that the band were keeping their promise to play there. McGuinness explained, [...] "This is a city that's been disappointed so many times {{there were a lot of}} people who weren't prepared to believe the gig was going to take place until they saw the stage going up." [...] Until then, tickets had sold very slowly, but within 24 hours of the trucks' arrival, another 8,000tickets were sold. Despite this, a day before the concert, 15,000tickets remained unsold. Three-hundred local residents were employed to help assemble the stage and promote the show.|$|E
6000|$|... "Famous? Yes," [...] {{answered}} Campbell, with an abstracted voice, {{and then}} rejoined quickly, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>could</b> but <b>see</b> <b>that,</b> what then?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And she rather likes being {{helped by}} <b>you.</b> I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> when she brought the coffee to you. She likes to stand close--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't {{believe that}} she really cares for him; in fact, from things she said to-night, I think she fears him. He was furiously jealous of <b>you,</b> I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that.</b> And I must say you gave him cause." ...|$|R
60|$|She exhibited, however, {{no signs}} of violence. More a sort of frozen calm, {{if you know what}} I mean. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> she was a woman who had suffered.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Lesher {{wanted to}} be leader, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> right off," [...] {{declared}} Tom. [...] "And Baxter {{will do anything to}} make it disagreeable for us boys," [...] he continued.|$|E
60|$|<b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> Joey (if {{you caught}} {{him with his}} hand in your plate) was a bit ashamed of himself, and he {{admitted}} to us that sausages were a passion with him.|$|E
6000|$|... "'But {{you were}} {{regularly}} hiding, Mr. Crow!' I cried, {{and do you}} know, that mixed him up so much that if there hadn't been feathers on his head I really believe <b>you</b> <b>could</b> have <b>seen</b> <b>that</b> he was blushing.|$|R
60|$|THE GENTLEMAN. Charge! I make no charge. [To {{the note}} taker] Really, sir, {{if you are}} a detective, you need not begin {{protecting}} me against molestation by young women until I ask <b>you.</b> Anybody <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> the girl meant no harm.|$|R
60|$|Alas! I am {{giving the}} moral before the fable; and yet I hardly think <b>that</b> {{otherwise}} <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> all <b>that</b> I mean in that enormous {{vision of the}} ploughed hills. These great furrowed slopes are the oldest architecture of man: the oldest astronomy was his guide, the oldest botany his object. And for geometry, the mere word proves my case.|$|R
6000|$|You see, I {{was working}} up the interest. It was getting pretty high, too; <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> by the craning necks all around, and the half-suspended breathing. So now I climaxed it: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not exactly; but <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> {{she meant}} it. Do {{you think it}} would do for them to change from their hotel, and go to the Grand Union or the States or Congress Hall?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't {{suppose you}} were. But I {{have had a}} note to-day which I must answer. Mrs. Andrews has asked us to dinner on Saturday. Philip, if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> sweet girl as I do, in all her {{goodness}} and sincerity--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ain't it funny," [...] said Trotter, digging {{his toes}} in the sand, [...] "what a chump {{a man is}} {{when it comes to}} {{paddling}} his own canoe? I don't know. Of course, I'm not making a living here. I'm on the bum. But--well, I wish <b>you</b> <b>could</b> have <b>seen</b> <b>that</b> Timotea. Every man has his own weak spot." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{just wish}} <b>you</b> <b>could</b> have <b>seen</b> <b>that</b> {{squirrel}} when I found him {{sitting at the}} front door of Sonny Hedgehog's hole, ready to get under cover {{at the first sign of}} danger! Do you know, he really believed he had tired out the 'Squire and that there wasn't any danger he could come to harm! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't be silly, Patsy," [...] said Beth. [...] "You're {{genuine and}} frank, {{and the child}} likes <b>you.</b> I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> yesterday. All <b>you</b> {{have to do is}} to be nice to her and win her confidence; and then, when the climax comes, you must be the {{spokesman}} and talk straight out from the shoulder. You can do that all right." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Forgive me," [...] I said, [...] "but I wish <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> child's face. There is {{something}} wrong, I am sure. She is terrified to death. Look, that brute {{is trying to}} force her to drink her wine. I really can't sit and watch it any longer." ...|$|E
6000|$|Elma let {{her eyes}} drop, {{and her heart}} beat hard. She laid her hand upon the easel to steady herself as she {{answered}} slowly, [...] "You know I like you, Mr. Waring; I like you very, very much indeed. You were so kind {{to me in the}} tunnel. And I felt your kindness. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> day I was--very, very grateful to you." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was a funny}} room, of course, but not {{so funny}} as you might expect; there were droll things in it, but they did nothing funny, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> they were just waiting for Joey. There were padded chairs with {{friendly}} looking rents {{down the middle of}} them, and a table and a horse-hair sofa, and we sat down very cautiously on the sofa but nothing happened to us.|$|E
6000|$|... "What's {{the social}} {{position}} of Mrs. Steuben?" [...] {{it occurred to}} him to ask while he meditated. He had an earnest artless literal way of putting such a question as that; <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> from it <b>that</b> he was very thorough.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, then, I wish he wouldn't {{come about}} any more. He has {{perfectly}} obsessed <b>you.</b> I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> {{the last two}} Sundays you were preaching right at him." [...] He had vainly hoped she had not noticed this, though he had not concealed from her that his talk with Hilbrook had suggested his theme. [...] "What {{are you going to}} do about him?" [...] she pursued relentlessly.|$|R
3000|$|Um, we took Gatorade, {{and mixed}} it with salt. So, {{it was like}} a Gatorade salt solution, and we put it in our mouth so it could absorb some DNA from like our cheeks without {{bursting}} it. And we take that and we put it in some detergent, and then we added some clear liquid. I think it was some sort of rubbing alcohol I donâ€™t know. Then <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> like <b>that</b> parts of your DNA like build up. (Interview 2017) [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{give you}} four barrels, {{if you can}} hold it," [...] replied the other proudly; [...] "and some the mates can, pretty near. They got an awful tank, as a general rule, the pards has. There ain't {{anything}} mean about this house. They don't scamp the broth, and they don't shab the measure. I do wish <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> refrigerator, oncet. Never been much at sea, have you, mate?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Tommy slept {{badly that}} night. The {{following}} morning the indefatigable Albert, having cemented {{an alliance with}} the greengrocer's boy, took the latter's place and ingratiated himself with the cook at Malthouse. He returned with the information that she was undoubtedly [...] "one of the crooks," [...] but Tommy mistrusted the vividness of his imagination. Questioned, he could adduce nothing {{in support of his}} statement except his own opinion that she wasn't the usual kind. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> at a glance.|$|E
6000|$|He {{went away}} with her thanks, {{and then she said}} to her husband, [...] "Well, he's {{perfectly}} charming, and I don't wonder she's taken with him; that kind of cold girl would be, though I'm not sure that she is cold. She's interesting, and <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> he thought so, the more he looked at her; I could see him looking at her from the very first instant; he couldn't keep his eyes off her; she piqued his curiosity, and made him wonder about her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When I {{read the}} texts to the chiefs, Judith, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> not have <b>seen</b> <b>that</b> they made any changes on their minds," [...] she said, [...] "but if seed is planted, it will grow. God planted {{the seeds of}} all these trees--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Can {{you tell}} me if a craft about this size, a {{schooner}} or brigantine, has put in here during the last fortnight? I don't know whether she is still flying yacht colours, or has gone into trade, but at any rate <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> at once <b>that</b> she had been a yacht." ...|$|R
60|$|But on the {{occasion}} in question, those dents looked deeper, even as his nervous step that morning left a deeper mark. And, so full of his thought was Ahab, that at every uniform turn that he made, now at the main-mast and now at the binnacle, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> almost <b>see</b> <b>that</b> thought turn in him as he turned, and pace in him as he paced; so completely possessing him, indeed, that it all but seemed the inward mould of every outer movement.|$|R
60|$|DEAR HOWELLS,--I'm ashamed. It {{happened}} in this way. I was proposing to acknowledge the receipt of the play and the little book per phonograph, so that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> the instrument {{is good enough for}} mere letter-writing; then I meant to add the fact that you can't write literature with it, because it hasn't any ideas and it hasn't any gift for elaboration, or smartness of talk, or vigor of action, or felicity of expression, but is just matter-of-fact, compressive, unornamental, and as grave and unsmiling as the devil.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, they're not so {{much better}} than women," [...] said Fulkerson, with a nervous jocosity. [...] "I guess March would have backed down if it hadn't been for his wife. She was as hot as pepper about it, and <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> she would have sacrificed all her husband's {{relations}} sooner than let him back down an inch from the stand he had taken. It's pretty easy for a man to stick to a principle if he has a woman to stand by him. But when you come to play it alone--" ...|$|E
6000|$|Now just at this moment, {{a little}} bird, {{no bigger than}} a sparrow, flew along by and lit on a sage-bush about thirty yards away. Steve whipped out his {{revolver}} and shot its head off. Oh, he was a marksman--much better than I was. We ran down there to pick up the bird, and just then, sure enough, Mr. Laird and his people came over the ridge, and they joined us. And when Laird's second saw that bird, with its head shot off, he lost color, he faded, and <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> he was interested. He said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{guessed it}} long ago, {{and there was}} a time when I was pleased," [...] she said. [...] "However, it was doubtless well for you that, when contact with the world taught me what we both were, I knew it was impossible. When we met again on the prairie, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>that</b> I was not the girl you knew in England. She had, in the meantime, bought {{enlightenment}} dearly; though whether it or her earlier fancies were nearer the hidden truth she does not know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Petty and sordid cares!" [...] {{repeated}} Lysbeth wonderingly, {{then she}} {{added with a}} kind of cry: [...] "Oh! Adrian, have you no heart that you can watch a saint burn and come home to philosophise about his agonies? Will you never understand? If <b>you</b> <b>could</b> have <b>seen</b> <b>that</b> poor woman this morning who only three months ago was a happy bride." [...] Then bursting into tears Lysbeth turned and fled from the room, for she remembered that what was the fate of the Vrouw Jansen to-day to-morrow might be her own.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I do {{not think}} <b>you</b> <b>could</b> make me <b>see</b> <b>that</b> as a greater {{difficulty}} than it has appeared to me." [...] He paused with a confused and daunted air, as if some important point had slipped his mind. [...] "But I must take the step; {{the burden of the}} double part I play is unendurable, is it not?" ...|$|R
