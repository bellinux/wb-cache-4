25|$|In 1894, Boyce {{was elected}} to the Idaho state senate as a Populist from Shoshone County, Idaho. Boyce battled for the eight-hour day for miners, the {{establishment}} of an arbitration board to settle labor disputes, and an investigation of the 1892 mining war. He objected to appropriations for the state militia, charging that it was a tool used by the state and mine owners to suppress labor. He called for legislation to forbid employment of aliens, to outlaw yellow-dog contracts and prohibit company stores. In {{one of the most dramatic}} speeches he ever made, Boyce denounced the blacklist:Senate bill fifty six provides for no class, no special legislation, but under its provisions those relentless persecutors, known as corporations, are prevented when they discharge an employee from following him with a blacklist and depriving him of the means of earning an honest living in another part of the state….Why do you not produce some argument against it to show that it should not become a law? No, it is not necessary: you of the Republican party have the votes to kill the bill and that is all you desire. But remember these words: the laboring men of Idaho have asked you for bread and you give them a stone: we ask you for justice and <b>you</b> <b>treat</b> us with scorn, but the day is fast approaching when your action will be condemned by every man who has one drop of manly blood in his veins.|$|E

Having dignity is something you work on your whole life, in how <b>you</b> <b>treat</b> people and how <b>you</b> <b>treat</b> yourself. I hope I always strive to have it." [...] She continued, [...] "It's not {{something that you can}} be given or that you can just get or that you're born with. It's something that you have to work on." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{dialogue}} {{preceding the}} Act II finale, starting with [...] "Here, take her sir, and mind <b>you</b> <b>treat</b> her kindly", was originally recitative. The music for this passage was {{printed in the}} first edition of the vocal score as No. 20a. Shortly after opening night, the recitative was dropped, and the lines thereafter were performed as spoken dialogue. In modern productions, the recitative is occasionally restored in place of the dialogue.|$|E

500|$|During the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s the Churches of Christ {{struggled}} with changing racial attitudes. [...] Some leaders, such as Foy E. Wallace Jr., railed against racial integration. Others, including the influential evangelist, Jimmy Allen from Harding University, opposed segregation and encouraged those {{working with his}} evangelistic campaigns to [...] "Treat them {{exactly the same way}} <b>you</b> <b>treat</b> white people." [...] Schools and colleges associated with the movement were {{at the center of the}} debate. [...] Abilene Christian College first admitted black undergraduate students in 1962 (graduate students had been admitted in 1961). [...] Desegregation of other campuses followed.|$|E
500|$|During {{her time}} with the band No Doubt, Stefani began making solo {{appearances}} on albums by artists including Eve and Moby. In the production of its fifth studio album, Rock Steady (2001), No Doubt collaborated with Prince, the Neptunes and David A. Stewart and had Mark [...] "Spike" [...] Stent mixing the album. While the band was on tour to promote the album, Stefani listened to Club Nouveau's 1987's single [...] "Why <b>You</b> <b>Treat</b> Me So Bad" [...] and considered recording material that modernized 1980s music. No Doubt's bassist and her former boyfriend, Tony Kanal, introduced her to music by Prince, Lisa Lisa and Cult Jam, and Debbie Deb, and they talked about producing songs from Kanal's bedroom.|$|E
500|$|On {{the first}} night of the 2008 Democratic National Convention, Craig Robinson {{introduced}} his younger sister. She delivered her speech, during which she sought to portray herself and her family as the embodiment of the American Dream. Obama said she and her husband believe [...] "that you work hard for what you want in life, that your word is your bond, and you do what you say you're going to do, that <b>you</b> <b>treat</b> people with dignity and respect, even if you don't know them, and even if you don't agree with them." [...] She also emphasized loving her country, in response to criticism for her previous statements about feeling proud of her country for the first time, where the original statement was seen as a gaffe. That keynote address was largely well-received and drew mostly positive reviews. A Rasmussen Reports poll found that her favorability among Americans reached 55%.|$|E

500|$|Starting on the {{electric}} piano, Charles played what felt right: {{a series of}} riffs, switching then to a regular piano for four choruses backed up by a unique Latin conga tumbao rhythm on drums. The song changed when Charles began singing simple, improvised unconnected verses ("Hey Mama don't <b>you</b> <b>treat</b> me wrong / Come and love your daddy all night long / All right now / Hey hey / All right"). Charles used gospel elements in a twelve-bar blues structure. Some of the first lines ("See the gal with the red dress on / She can do the Birdland all night long") are influenced by a boogie-woogie style that Ahmet Ertegun attributes to Clarence [...] "Pinetop" [...] Smith who used to call out to dancers {{on the dance floor}} instructing what to do through his lyrics. In the middle of the song, however, Charles indicated that the Raelettes should repeat what he was doing, and the song transformed into a call and response between Charles, the Raelettes, and the horn section in the orchestra as they called out to each other in ecstatic shouts and moans and blasts from the horns.|$|E
500|$|In {{his other}} works he experimented {{more with less}} {{traditional}} approaches to reality, so that [...] "the most frightful, the most unusual things are told with the deadpan expression". A commonly cited example is the physical and spiritual ascending into heaven of a character while she is hanging the laundry out to dry in One Hundred Years of Solitude. The style of these works fits in the [...] "marvellous realm" [...] described by the Cuban writer Alejo Carpentier and was labeled as magical realism. Literary critic Michael Bell proposes an alternative understanding for García Márquez's style, as the category magic realism is criticized for being dichotomizing and exoticizing, [...] "what is really at stake is a psychological suppleness which is able to inhabit unsentimentally the daytime world while remaining open to the promptings of those domains which modern culture has, by its own inner logic, necessarily marginalised or repressed." [...] García Márquez and his friend Plinio Apuleyo Mendoza discuss his work in a similar way,"The way <b>you</b> <b>treat</b> reality in your books ... has been called magical realism. I have the feeling your European readers are usually aware of the magic of your stories but fail to see the reality behind it ..." [...] "This is surely because their rationalism prevents them seeing that reality isn't limited {{to the price of}} tomatoes and eggs." ...|$|E
500|$|Describing {{the tone}} of the season, Loeb said, [...] "When we first started talking about Daredevil, we promised that we were telling a story that was first a crime drama and then a superhero show. This is more of a {{psychological}} thriller. This speaks to when you think about what happened to Jessica and what sort of destroyed her life and how she tried to put it together, and then to have to confront the person who deconstructed her world, that’s a very powerful, emotional place to start from." [...] On approaching rape and trauma in the season, Rosenberg wanted to avoid actually showing rape, which she called [...] "lazy storytelling" [...] and often a way to [...] "spice up" [...] male characters, and preferred to just make the trauma a part of the characters' everyday lives rather than an [...] "issue" [...] for the season to tackle. When asked about the adult nature of the season, including the use of sex, Rosenberg explained that Marvel would only not allow showing nudity {{and the use of the}} word 'fuck' in the season. Regarding all of the social issues the season covered, such as [...] "issues of choice, interracial relationships, domestic violence, [...] issues of consent" [...] while also exploring [...] "feminism and being a woman in this world", Rosenberg said, [...] "It was never our intention going in , and I think the minute you intend to do that, you’re stepping up on a soap box. If you’re digging into the dark side of the human psyche and all the different experiences we go through, and as women we go through, you’re going to find those things. If <b>you</b> <b>treat</b> them honestly and with respect, you’re also going to hit social issues." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2010, {{during an}} {{interview}} with Simon Armitage, he said [...] "ou can't help but feel that the Chinese are a subspecies" [...] due to their [...] "horrific" [...] treatment of animals. Armitage said: [...] "He must have known it would make waves, he's not daft. But clearly, {{when it comes to}} animal rights and animal welfare, he's absolutely unshakable in his beliefs. In his view, if <b>you</b> <b>treat</b> an animal badly, you are less than human." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with the Belfast Telegraph published on 10 May 1969 he stated: [...] "It is frightfully hard to explain to Protestants that if you give Roman Catholics a good job and a good house they will live like Protestants because they will see neighbours with cars and television sets; they will refuse to have eighteen children. But if a Roman Catholic is jobless, and lives in the most ghastly hovel he will rear eighteen children on National Assistance. If <b>you</b> <b>treat</b> Roman Catholics with due consideration and kindness they will live like Protestants in spite of the authoritative nature of their Church".|$|E

In 1779, while the American colonies were fighting Britain for their independence, Benjamin Franklin wrote to captains of colonial warships at sea, recommending {{that if they}} {{came into contact with}} Cook's vessel, they were to [...] "not consider her an enemy, nor suffer any plunder to be made of the effects contained in her, nor obstruct her immediate return to England by detaining her or sending her into any other part of Europe or to America; but that <b>you</b> <b>treat</b> the said Captain Cook and his people with all civility and kindness, ... as common friends to mankind."

You just don’t treat women the way <b>you</b> <b>treat</b> fellow cadets. If you did, it would be ungentlemanly, it would be improper."

2500|$|Starting in September 2006, O'Brien was stalked by Father David Ajemian of the Archdiocese of Boston, who, despite {{multiple}} {{warnings to}} stop, sent O'Brien letters signed as [...] "your priest stalker" [...] and {{came into contact}} with O'Brien's parents. O'Brien and Ajemian had attended Harvard University at the same time. Frustrated that he had been denied a spot in the Late Night audience, Ajemian sent a letter to O'Brien stating that he flew to New York [...] "in the dimming hope that you might finally acknowledge me." [...] He stated in another letter, [...] "Is this the way <b>you</b> <b>treat</b> your most dangerous fans??? You owe me big time, pal." [...] In another letter, Ajemian seemed to make a death threat, saying, [...] "Remember Frank Costello once dodged a bullet in your building and so can you." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sun Ce told Taishi Ci, [...] "In the past, when Liu Yao criticised me {{for helping}} Yuan Shu conquer Lujiang, he didn't have good {{intentions}} and his reasons were not convincing. Why? Yuan Shu had {{control over the}} thousands of troops {{which used to be}} under my father's command. I wanted to make great achievements, so I {{had no choice but to}} submit to Yuan Shu and ask him to give me control of my father's troops. Even then, he only gave me back about 1,000 men. When he ordered me to attack Lujiang, the circumstances I was in were so desperate that I had no choice but to obey him. Later on, he turned evil and wanted to commit treacherous acts. I tried to dissuade him but he wouldn't listen. That was when I decided to sever ties with him. My relationship with Yuan Shu is only up to this extent. Now that Liu Yao is dead, there is no chance for me to explain to him anymore. However, his son still lives in Yuzhang. I don't know how Hua Ziyu treats him, and whether Liu Yao's former followers have decided to serve Hua Ziyu. You are from the same commandery as Liu Yao, and you served under him before. I hope you can visit his son and convey my wishes to his followers. If they wish to join me, I will welcome them; if they don't, do treat them kindly. At the same time, you can assess how strong Hua Ziyu's defences are, and see if the peoples of Luling and Poyang are willing to join me. You can bring along as many men as you wish." [...] Taishi Ci replied, [...] "I have committed unpardonable acts. Yet, <b>you</b> <b>treat</b> me as generously as how Duke Huan of Qi and Duke Wen of Jin treated former enemies who surrendered to them. The ancients lived by a code of loyalty until death. I don't need too many men to accompany me. Just a dozen or so will be sufficient." ...|$|E
