500|$|The {{ghosts of}} actor Charles Macklin and clown Joseph Grimaldi are also {{supposed}} to haunt the theatre. Macklin appears backstage, wandering the corridor which now {{stands in the}} spot where, in 1735, he killed fellow actor Thomas Hallam in an argument over a wig ("Goddamn <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> blackguard, scrub, rascal!" [...] he shouted, thrusting a cane into Hallam's face and piercing his left eye). Grimaldi {{is reported to be}} a helpful apparition, purportedly guiding nervous actors skilfully about the stage on more than one occasion. The comedian Stanley Lupino claimed to have seen the ghost of Dan Leno in a dressing room.|$|E

500|$|In 2000, Ripley {{appeared}} in the British dogme film The Announcement, as well as playing lead female character Grace Bingley—opposite Paul Rhys—in the Granada television pilot I Saw You, which used {{many of the same}} production staff as Cold Feet. David Belcher of The Herald called Ripley [...] "perfectly scatty, tousled and self-sufficient" [...] in the role, and Joe Joseph of The Times complimented her comic timing. Ripley returned to I Saw <b>You</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> three-episode miniseries in 2002. She considers I Saw You, in which she acted alongside her husband Daniel Lapaine, the television show she is most proud to have worked on.|$|E
500|$|The {{biography}} is comprehensive, covering {{many different}} aspects of its subject's life. The author discusses Morrison's early life in Belfast, Northern Ireland, and how this influenced his perspective of [...] "no surrender", a reference to Ulster Unionism. Rogan writes how, a young boy, Morrison exhibited [...] "poor communication skills, aggressive impatience, and absence of empathy", and yearned for positive relations between his Protestant and Catholic friends. The author notes that a theme of Morrison's youth was his appreciation of music and his pleasure of creating music influenced by gospel and love. He cites Morrison's cousin Jackie Stitt who said: [...] "He {{could have been a}} good sportsman but he had no interest in it at all. He'd play along with <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> while until he got bored – he seemed to tire of it quickly. He'd go indoors." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{references}} to the larger MCU, Ramirez said [...] "those little Easter eggs that come along the way are fun", but {{there were times when}} the writers did not take opportunities to reference the rest of the universe because they felt like distractions from the series' narrative and characters. Petrie stated that the writers wanted to [...] "keep it in Hell's Kitchen" [...] and focus on issues such as [...] "the air conditioner doesn’t work at Nelson and Murdock. That’s really what we’re interested in." [...] He explained that the real life New York City [...] "has a larger than life presence" [...] with celebrities that live there—"If you see Derek Jeter walking down the street, that’s great, but then you turn the corner and you get into an argument with the guy who overcharged <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> pretzel. We want our guys to be real New Yorkers." ...|$|E

500|$|Canada {{entered the}} final facing {{pressure}} {{to defeat the}} Soviets. [...] The Soviet national team's easy victory over the National Hockey League's all-stars in the 1979 Challenge Cup left the Canadians searching to regain command of their rivalry with the Soviets. [...] Coach Scotty Bowman called it a [...] "must win game" [...] for Canada: [...] "We really are favorites in the final. [...] Nobody in this country will tolerate a loss." [...] The players also spoke of their desire to show the Soviets {{that they were the}} world's top hockey nation. During their pre-game preparations, Tikhonov called upon his team to play the finest games of their lives: [...] "Today you got to play so well that the entire Canadian population will talk about you afterwards and remember <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long time. [...] Play so well that the Canadian fans when they will leave Forum will wait for you when you get on the bus after the game and admire you." ...|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} was {{described}} by critics as a [...] "larger than life anthem", and an [...] "inspirational lighter-in-the-air ballad", where Carey remembers both her father, {{as well as any}} lost loved ones. [...] "Bye Bye" [...] begins with an understated chorus, then working into the first verse, in which Carey retells her childhood, and her relationship with her father years ago: [...] "As a child there were them times / I didn't get it, but you kept me alive / I didn't know why you didn't show up sometimes / And its more than saying 'I miss you' / But I'm glad we talked through / All them grown full things separation brings / You never let me know it, you never let it show". Then, the pre-chorus continues describing Carey's emotions in the present, [...] "And everyday life goes on / I wish I could talk to <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> while", and how the loss of her father still affects her day-to-day life.|$|E
500|$|An authoritative, combative stylist, Macartney's élan {{and devastating}} strokemaking led Kent cricketer Kenneth Hutchings to dub him [...] "The Governor-General". Fingleton noted that, {{early in his}} innings, Macartney had a {{strategy}} of aiming a shot straight at the bowler's head, in order to rattle him and seize a psychological advantage. On one occasion, after reaching a century before lunch {{on the first day}} of a match, he immediately called for a bat change. He selected the heaviest bat from the batch that his team-mate brought out and stated [...] "Now I'm going to have a hit". His rate of scoring and boundary-hitting subsequently increased. He possessed powerful hands, strong forearms and broad shoulders. Leg spinning Test team-mate Arthur Mailey recalled that Macartney would often hit him for six in Sydney Grade Cricket matches. Grinning, he would say [...] "Pitch another one there and I'll hit <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few more". On the occasions when he lost his wicket attempting further long hits, Macartney's grin remained, and he would remark [...] "Wasn't it good fun?" [...] The famed cricket writer RC Robertson-Glasgow said ...|$|E

500|$|Critical {{response}} to [...] "Stronger" [...] was generally positive. Andy Strickland of Yahoo! Music {{described it as}} having [...] "splashes of pure Massive Attack". Stuart McCaighy of This Is Fake DIY wrote that it [...] "sounds ace", while Birmingham Post writer Andrew Cowen described the track as [...] "defiant". Dean Piper from Daily Mirror considered it the Sugababes' best release and applauded the group's vocals on the song. Hot Press writer Phil Udell characterised [...] "Stronger" [...] as [...] "an elegant ballad way beyond their tender years". Akin Ojumu of The Guardian was complimentary about the track's R elements, writing: [...] "When they get it right on tracks such as 'Stronger' and 'Supernatural' the Sugababes are cool". Fiona Shepherd of The Scotsman praised the song's composition, calling it [...] "tastefully restrained". However, Barry Nicholson from NME named it the weaker track on the double A-side and stated that it [...] "leers at <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> bit, then staggers off to puke up that last Bacardi Breezer". [...] Marianne Gunn from The Herald called the track's strings [...] "inferior" [...] and wrote that it contains [...] "the same cheesy sentiment" [...] as American singer Britney Spears' song of the same name.|$|E
500|$|The Manhattan Engineer District (MED) was {{formally}} {{established by the}} Chief of Engineers, Major General Eugene Reybold on 16 August 1942. The name was chosen by Groves and MED's district engineer, Colonel James C. Marshall. Like other engineer districts, it was named after the city where its headquarters was located, at 270 Broadway. Unlike the others, however, it had no geographic boundaries, only a mission: to develop an atomic bomb. Moreover, Marshall had the authority of a division engineer head and reported directly to Reybold. Although Reybold was satisfied with the progress being made, Dr. Vannevar Bush was less so. He felt that aggressive leadership was required, and suggested {{the appointment of a}} prestigious officer as overall project director. Somervell, now Chief of Army Service Forces, recommended Groves. Somervell met Groves outside the hearing room where Groves had been testifying before a United States Congress committee on military housing and informed him that [...] "The Secretary of War has selected <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> very important assignment, and the President has approved the selection... If you do the job right, it will win the war." [...] Groves could not hide his disappointment at not receiving a combat assignment: [...] "Oh, that thing," [...] he replied.|$|E
500|$|Flight {{attendant}} CeeCee Lyles {{called her}} husband at 09:47:57 and left him a message saying the plane had been hijacked. Marion Britton called her friend, Fred Fiumano, at 09:49:12. Fiumano recalled, [...] "she said, 'We're gonna. They're gonna kill us, you know, We're gonna die.' And I told her, 'Don't worry, they hijacked the plane, they're gonna take <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> ride, you go to their country, and you come back. You stay there for vacation.' You don't know what to say—what are you gonna say? I kept on saying the same things, 'Be calm.' And she was crying and—you know—more or less crying and screaming and yelling." [...] Flight attendant Sandra Bradshaw called {{her husband at}} 09:50:04 and {{told him she was}} preparing scalding water to throw at the hijackers. Passenger Lauren Grandcolas called her husband twice, once before takeoff and once during the hijacking. He missed both of her calls. She then passed her phone to Honor Elizabeth Wainio. Wainio called her stepmother at 09:53:43 and concluded, four and a half minutes later, by saying, [...] "I have to go. They're breaking into the cockpit. I love you." [...] Jarrah dialed in the VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) frequency for the VOR navigational aid at Reagan National Airport at 09:55:11 to direct the plane toward Washington, D.C. Bradshaw, on the phone with her husband, said [...] "Everyone is running up to first class. I've got to go. Bye." [...] Beamer told Jefferson that the group was planning to [...] "jump on" [...] the hijackers and fly the plane into the ground before the hijackers' plan could be followed through. Beamer recited the Lord's Prayer and the 23rd Psalm with Jefferson, prompting others to join in. Beamer requested of Jefferson, [...] "If I don't make it, please call my family and let them know how much I love them." [...] After this, Jefferson heard muffled voices and Beamer clearly answering, [...] "Are you ready? Okay. Let's roll." [...] These were Beamer's last words to Jefferson.|$|E

500|$|Leonard Maltin of IndieWire {{praised the}} {{animation}} and art direction, but {{wrote that he}} wished [...] "the movie was funnier and wasn't so plot-heavy" [...] and that [...] "Pixar has raised the bar for animated features so high that when they turn out a film that's merely good, instead of great, they have only themselves to blame for causing critics to damn them with faint praise." [...] Michael Phillips of Chicago Tribune gave the film two stars out of four, saying [...] "Monsters University, the weirdly charmless sequel to the animated 2001 Pixar hit Monsters, Inc., is no better or worse than the average (and I mean average) time-filling sequel cranked out by other animation houses." [...] Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a negative review, saying that it [...] "never surprises, goes off in unexpected directions or throws <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> loop {{in the manner of}} the best Pixar stories. Nor does it come close to elating through the sheer imagination of its conceits and storytelling." [...] Claudia Puig of USA Today gave the film three stars out of four, and said it [...] "may not be as inventive as Inc., but it's an amusing and amiable addition to Pixar's roster of animated coming-of-age stories." [...] Michael O'Sullivan of The Washington Post gave the film three stars out of four, saying [...] "It may be children's terror that powers the movie's fictional universe, but it's the energy of its stars that lights up Monsters University." [...] Chris Nashawaty of Entertainment Weekly gave the film an A− and said it [...] "is exactly the rebound Pixar needed after 2011's Cars 2 left some wondering if the studio had lost its magic. The delightful story of when Mike met Sulley puts those concerns to rest." [...] James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film three stars out of four and wrote [...] "Although it falls short of the best Pixar has brought to the screen over its long association with Disney, it's nevertheless worth a trip to the theater, especially for kids." ...|$|E
500|$|Michael Scott (Steve Carell) {{calls an}} {{emergency}} meeting asking everyone {{to come up}} with an idea to [...] "re-invigorate" [...] the office. Michael asks Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker) for ideas, but Stanley is preoccupied with a crossword puzzle and says he's busy. Michael keeps asking him, and Stanley finally snaps at Michael, and says the titular [...] "Did I stutter?" [...] in a very loud, threatening tone. Michael, who is visibly shaken, ends the meeting. Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) encourages Michael to take disciplinary action against Stanley, and Michael, initially resistant, decides to pretend to fire him to teach him a lesson. Michael first tells everyone in the office that he is not really firing him, and does so in front of all of them. Stanley responds by threatening to sue him and tell corporate of Michael's antics. When Michael tells Stanley that the firing was actually an attempt at teaching him a lesson, Stanley is angered and goes on a rant, yelling and insulting Michael. Michael suddenly barks at him to stop it, and tells everyone to leave the office, making everyone think he is about to berate Stanley. The camera crew sneak back in to film the exchange, where Michael tearfully (much to Stanley's annoyance) but calmly asks Stanley why he picks on him. Stanley states that he simply does not respect him, and when Michael suggests that Stanley does not know him very well he replies [...] "Michael, I've known <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> very long time. And the more I've gotten to know you, the less I've come to respect you." [...] Michael then takes an uncharacteristically professional tone with Stanley, and says that, while he accepts that Stanley does not respect him, he cannot take such a disrespectful tone with him, because he is his boss. Stanley responds by saying, [...] "Fair enough," [...] and the two shake hands.|$|E
