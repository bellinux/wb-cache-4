The analysis of such data sets arise commonly in genetical genomics, with X linked to the DNA characteristics and Y corresponding to measurements of fundamental biological processes such as transcription, protein or metabolite production. Building on the Bayesian variable selection set-up for the linear model and associated efficient MCMC algorithms developed for single responses, we discuss the generic framework of hierarchical related sparse regressions, where parallel regressions of y k on the set of covariates X are linked in a hierarchica...|$|E

In this case, we improve the constant by which the general problem is harder than the discrepancy one from 2 down to 2 (23) ff. We also find that a random vector x has expected linear discrepancy 2 (12) ffCnff only. Hence in the typical situation that the discrepancy is decreasing for smaller matrices, the linear discrepancy problem is even less difficult compared to the discrepancy one than assured by previous results. We also obtain the bound lindisc(A; x) ^ 2 2 ff 21 Γ ffΓ 1 Ckxk ff 1. Our proofs use a reduction to Pusher-Chooser games. Key words: rounding, discrepancy, games. 1 Introduction This paper addresses rounding problems, in particular the question how much {{easier it is to}} round a vector with all entries 12 compared to the general case of arbitrary [0; 1]-vectors. A famous result of Beck and Spencer [5] and Lov'asz, Spencer and Vesztergombi [11] shows that the general problem can be reduced to the 12 -case. We refine their result for the typical case that the rounding problem for smaller matrices can be solved better than for larger ones. 1. 1 Linear Discrepancy For a given matrix A 2 RmΘ n and a vector x 2 Rn we are interested in finding a vector y 2 Zn such that (1) kx Γ yk 1 ^ 1 and (2) the rounding error kA(x Γ <b>y)</b> <b>k</b> <b>1</b> is small.

40|$|Tesis {{doctoral}} inédita leida en la Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Facultad de Ciencias, Departamento de Biología Molecular. Fecha de lectura: 30 - 06 - 2006 Killer-cell Immunoglobulin-like Receptors (KIR), upon {{recognition of}} their MHC class I ligands, regulate the response of NK cells against potential target cells. KIR genes are located in chromosome region 19 q 13. 4, in a cluster composed by up to 15 genes and 2 pseudogenes, all of them showing a substantial degree of polymorphism and alternative splicing forms. KIR 2 DL 5 is the most recently described KIR, whose gene is present in only some individuals. We have studied its intrinsic variability and the involvement of this on the haplotypic diversity of KIR genes. This study has identified KIR 2 DL 5 as a "hot spot" of KIR diversity, in which different recombinations have taken place. We have demonstrated the existence of two loci encoding KIR 2 DL 5 (K 1 R 2 DL 5 A <b>y</b> <b>K</b> <b>1</b> R 2 DL 5 B), which can appear either separately or {{together in the same}} haplotype. We have also discovered three novel KIR 2 DL 5 alleles (KIR 2 DL 5 A* 005, KIR 2 OL 58 * 006 and * 007) and an unequal crossing-over between KIR 2 DL 5 and KIR 3 DP 1, which is presumably the origin of two unusual haplotypes: those carrying a duplication of the conserved genes KIR 3 DP 1 -KIR 2 DL 4 -KIR 3 DL/S 1 or a deletion of the same genes. These haplotypes enabled us to rule out an essential function of KIR 2 DL 4, an HLA-G receptor, in reproduction; and to identify a functional chimeric alíele of the KIR 3 DP 1 pseudogene that might encode a soluble receptor. The expression of KIR 2 DL 5 is variable: it has alleles expressed in NK and T lymphocytes and others that behave as nontranscribed pseudogenes. This divergence correlates with polymorphisms in their promoter regions. We have analysed the binding of RUNX transcription factors to the promoter of KIR 2 DL 5 alleles, the activity of this in vitro and the effect of a demethylating drug on KIR 2 DL 5 expression. These assays demonstrate that nonexpressed KIR 2 DL 5 alleles have potentially functional promoters, but they are silenced in vivo by epigenetic mechanisms, in which RUNX transcription factors might be involved...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} several basic {{problems of}} algebraic topology, with connections to combinatorial and geometric questions, {{from the point}} of view of computational complexity. The extension problem asks, given topological spaces X, Y, a subspace A ⊆ X, and a (continuous) map f: A → Y, whether f can be extended to a map X → Y. For computational purposes, we assume that X and Y are represented as finite simplicial complexes, A is a subcomplex of X, and f is given as a simplicial map. In this generality the problem is undecidable, as follows from Novikov’s result from the 1950 s on uncomputability of the fundamental group π 1 (Y). We thus study the problem under the assumption that, for some <b>k</b> ≥ 2, <b>Y</b> is (<b>k</b> − <b>1)</b> -connected; informally, this means that Y has “no holes up to dimension <b>k</b> − <b>1</b> ” (a basic example of such a Y is the sphere Sk).
