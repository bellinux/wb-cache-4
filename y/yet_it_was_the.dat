25|$|Argentina {{collected}} {{a maximum of}} six points from their opening two games after beating Greece 4–0 in Foxboro before coming from behind to overcome the feisty Nigerians 2–1 on the same field four days later, yet still only finished third. The game against Greece had been won in style thanks mainly to a hat-trick from Gabriel Batistuta, <b>yet</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> other goal in the game – from Diego Maradona – that hit the headlines. Nigeria had been very impressive on their World Cup debut, and despite the narrow loss to Argentina, had emerged as group winners following victories against Bulgaria and Greece, the latter in which Nigeria doubled its lead late on a goal from Daniel Amokachi – a goal that would allow Nigeria to top its group. Maradona only played with Argentina during their first two games, both in Foxborough (playing Greece and Nigeria); he {{was thrown out of}} the tournament after testing positive for ephedrine.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} years of the 16th century the church was patronized and under the special {{protection}} of Álvaro Lopes do Vulcão and his wife D. Mecia Afonso (who were later buried near the altar of São Pedro). From these references and his testament, there were just five curia in 1543. After Mecia Afonso's death (22 October 1523) her 1518 will order the creation of a silver chalice for Our Lady of the Rosary. Frutuoso went on to mention that the church was expanded between 1583 and 1586; at about mid-century it was supported by five brotherhoods at the church: the Brotherhood of Santa Cruz, the Brotherhood of the Fiéis de Deus, the Brotherhood of Santa Maria do Rosário, the Brotherhood of Nossa Senhora da Conceição and Brotherhood of São Sebastião, each with their own initiatives (by the 19th century only two brotherhoods existed, Nossa Senhora do Rosário and Fiéis de Deus). <b>Yet,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> nearby hermitage of Nossa Senhora do Rosário that functioned as the parochial church of Lagoa, suggesting that Santa Cruz was under construction or remodelling. On 3 January 1692, vicar Salvador de Sousa suggested constructing a clock for the church, and during the 1844 remodelling, the frontispiece and tower were extended to make way for such a project.|$|E

2500|$|While the {{cartridge}} revolver {{was known in}} Europe, Rollin White's famous patent combined a cylinder and a box magazine. It was a completely unworkable design which never went into production (only one sample was built which malfunctioned dramatically), [...] <b>Yet</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> first US patent to include a cylinder bored through so that a revolver could be loaded from the breech. White's original solution for the misfires that plagued early revolvers was to plug {{the rear of the}} chambers with pieces of leather. The patent drawings imply that a percussion cap would have had to be applied to the single nipple for each shot, so it would have been far slower than the existing cap-&-ball revolvers.|$|E

2500|$|Kapampangans {{have played}} a dynamic yet {{conflicting}} role in Philippine history. It was the Kapampangans of Macabebe who {{were the first to}} defend the Luzon Empire from Spanish domination in 1571. <b>Yet</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Kapampangans that the Spaniards relied on to defend their new colony from the Dutch. It was at this time that [...] "one Castillan plus three Kapampangans" [...] were considered as [...] "four Castillans" [...] as long they gallantly served in the colonial armed forces. Such behaviour earned them the stereotype of being quislings in exchange for personal wealth and self-aggrandisement all throughout the archipelago. After their successful battle against the Dutch in 1640, only Kapampangans were allowed to study {{side by side with the}} Spaniards in exclusive Spanish academies and universities in Manila, by order of Governor-General Sebastián Hurtado de Corcuera. In 1896, Kapampangans were one of the principal ethnic groups to push and fuel the Philippine revolution against Spain. Yet it was also the Kapampangans of Macabebe that fiercely defended the last Spanish garrison against the revolutionaries.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Yet</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Kansas-Nebraska Act, {{rather than}} the Compromise of 1850, that would serve as the {{catalyst}} to partisan re-alignment. Pierce demanded that all loyal Democrats support the act, hoping that the Kansas-Nebraska Act and debates over {{the development of the}} West would reinvigorate partisan conflict and distract from intra-party battles. But the bill instead polarized legislators sectional lines, with Southern Whigs providing critical votes in the House as a narrow majority of Northern Democrats voted against it. Congressional Democrats suffered huge losses in the mid-term elections of 1854, voting instead for a wide array of new parties opposed to the Democrats and the Kansas-Nebraska Act. In many Midwestern states, a coalition of Free Soilers and Northern Whigs, many of whom were no longer willing to cooperate with Southern Whigs {{in the aftermath of the}} latter's support of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, formed a new coalition that became known as the Republican Party. The party lambasted the institution of slavery and opposed the Fugitive Slave Act and the extension of slavery into the territories. In other Midwestern states, opponents of the Kansas-Nebraska Act and the Democratic Party merely labeled themselves the [...] "Opposition." [...] In other parts of the country, many Whigs refused to abandon their party. But the Know Nothing movement, seizing on growing fears of Catholic immigrants, defeated numerous Northeastern and Southern congressional candidates from both the Whig and Democratic parties. In Pierce's home state of New Hampshire, hitherto loyal to the Democratic Party, the Know-Nothings elected the governor, all three representatives, dominated the legislature, and returned John P. Hale to the Senate. The elections left Democrats in the minority in the House, although they retained control of the Senate. Nathaniel Banks, a member of the Know Nothings and the Free Soil Party, won election as Speaker of the House after a protracted battle.|$|E
2500|$|At 12:01 AM on February 1, 1968, the Penn Central began operation. The Penn Central was {{the largest}} {{corporation}} in the United States. It had over $5 billion in assets, 20,000 miles of track, 180,000 employees, and projected $17 billion in operating revenue for 1968---all on paper. To the public and to Wall Street, the Penn Central projected an image of modernity and stability. In reality, the merged Penn Central was little better off than its constituent railroads were before. On {{the first day of}} operation, the Penn Central only had $13.3 million of cash. Everything else they owned was on paper. The added burden imposed by the ICC of adding the bankrupt New York, New Haven and Hartford to the Penn Central made a bad situation worse. [...] A decade of merger talks and agreements between the NYC and the PRR led to an implementation plan, but it was never carried out. Attempts to integrate operations, personnel and equipment were not very successful, due to sharply clashing corporate cultures, incompatible computer systems, and overly generous union contracts that loaded the PC with staff they did not need. [...] All of the cost savings and reduction in expenses that was supposed to occur to a merged railroad never materialized with the Penn Central. [...] The NYC had cultivated a corporate culture of openness where ideas were freely exchanged and managers did not operate in a top-down fashion. At the PRR there was a clearly defined hierarchy, management was slow to embrace new technologies and ideas, and lower level people deferred to those above them. The two corporate cultures were 180-degrees opposite each other. The merger technically was supposed to be two equals joined together, <b>yet</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> PRR management team that ended up dominating the new Penn Central, which made the merger technically an acquisition of the NYC by the PRR. The NYC management team (the Green Team) was subordinated to the PRR management team (the Red Team). The merged Penn Central's corporate headquarters was in the former Pennsylvania Railroad head office at Six Penn Place in Philadelphia.|$|E
