Inside and out, dear Miss Emily, our house is just a little dull. I say our house, and why not--when the management of it is all thrown on me. We are built of stone; and we are much too long, and are not half high enough. Our situation is on the coldest side of the county, away in the west. We are close to the Cheviot hills; and if you fancy there is anything to see when you look out of window, except sheep, you will find yourself woefully mistaken. As for walks, if you go out {{on one side of the}} house <b>you</b> <b>may,</b> <b>or</b> <b>may</b> not, be gored by cattle. On the other side, if the darkness overtakes you, <b>you</b> <b>may,</b> <b>or</b> <b>may</b> not, tumble down a deserted lead mine. But the company, inside the house, makes amends for it all," [...] Mrs. Rook proceeded, enjoying the expression of dismay which was beginning to show itself on Emily's face. [...] "Plenty of excitement for you, my dear, in our small family. Sir Jervis will introduce you to plaster casts of hideous Indian idols; he will keep you writing for him, without mercy, from morning to night; and when he does let you go, old Miss Redwood will find she can't sleep, and will send for the pretty young lady-secretary to read to her. My husband I am sure you will like. He is a respectable man, and bears the highest character. Next to the idols, he's the most hideous object in the house. If you are good enough to encourage him, I don't say that he won't amuse you; he will tell you, for instance, he never in his life hated any human being as he hates his wife. By the way, I must not forget--in the interests of truth, you know--to mention one drawback that does exist in our domestic circle. One of these days we shall have our brains blown out or our throats cut. Sir Jervis's mother left him ten thousand pounds' worth of precious stones all contained in a little cabinet with drawers. He won't let the banker take care of his jewels; he won't sell them; he won't even wear one of the rings on his finger, or one of the pins at his breast. He keeps his cabinet on his dressing-room table; and he says, 'I like to gloat over my jewels, every night, before I go to bed.' Ten thousand pounds' worth of diamonds, rubies, emeralds, sapphires, and what not--at the mercy of the first robber who happens to hear of them. Oh, my dear, he would have no choice, I do assure you, but to use his pistols. We shouldn't quietly submit to be robbed. Sir Jervis inherits the spirit of his ancestors. My husband has the temper of a game cock. I myself, in defense of the property of my employers, am capable of becoming a perfect fiend. And we none of us understand the use of firearms!" ...|$|E

That's what you ARE, gentlemen; that's what you'll continue TO BE until the job's finished; and," [...] he added, with a sudden dominance that they all felt, [...] "the man who forgets it will have to reckon with me. Now," [...] he continued, resuming his former ironical manner, [...] "now, what are the cold facts of the case? The Marshalls worked this claim ever since '49, and never got anything out of it; then they dropped off or died out, leaving only one brother, Tom Marshall, to work what was left of it. Well, a few days ago HE found indications of a big lead in the rock, and instead of rushin' out and yellin' like an honest man, and callin' in the boys to drink, he sneaks off to 'Frisco, and goes to the bank to get 'em to take a hand in it. Well, you know, when Jim Stacy takes a hand in anything, IT'S BOTH HANDS, and the bank wouldn't see it until he promised to guarantee possession of the whole abandoned claim,--'dips, spurs, and angles,'--and let them work the whole thing, which the d----d fool DID, and the bank agreed to send an expert down there to-morrow to report. But while he was away some one on our side, who was an expert also, got wind of it, and made an examination all by himself, and found it was a vein sure enough and a big thing, and some one else on our side found out, too, all that Marshall had promised the bank and what the bank had promised him. Now, gentlemen, when the bank sends down that expert to-morrow I expect that he will find YOU IN POSSESSION of every part of the deserted claim except the spot where Tom is still working." ...|$|E

A matter of eighty years ago, there was first kindled {{in the country}} places of France that fire which ultimately blazed over the whole land, devastating, murderous, anarchic, yet purifying. The family seat {{of the house of}} Seyre was near Orléans. In that region were many oppressors of the poor who, when they heard the mutterings of the storm, shivered for their safety. Upon not one of them did that furious mob of men and women pause to waste a single moment of their time. Without even a spoken word save one simultaneous, unanimous yell, they grouped together from all quarters--from every hamlet, from every homestead, men and women and even children--and moved in one solid body upon the Château de Seyre. The old prince would have been burned alive but for a servant who threw him a pistol, with which he blew out his brains, spitting at the mob. One of the sons was caught and torn almost to pieces. Only the father of our friend, the present Prince of Seyre, escaped." ...|$|R

I have no fear that it will be a failure. If our party in Poland triumph, or if our army here advances, or if Augustus, finding his position hopeless, leaves the country, the good people of Warsaw will join their voices to those of the majority. If matters go the other way, <b>you</b> <b>may</b> be sure that they will not risk imprisonment, confiscation, and perhaps death, by getting up a revolt on their own account.

40|$|My {{motivation}} for {{this paper is}} to make heared for people ideas that I was researched and studied, about problems concerned with the many aspects of our existence. My idea was find an unity between answers to existence problems from areas as psychology, philosophy, theology, together. The structure of book is philosophical. Separates in some chapters four themes that I found in the deep meaning of every thinking and feeling in our exif ours, as: distance, absence, awaiting (wishing) and unity. They are following an order in psychological, theological and both philosophical meaning. The analysis in every one chapter starts with the beggining of the signification of the central concept, as for example absence, and asks questions followed by answers, it establishes conclusions and main ideas, and finally it comes a conclusion about the main aspects that followed analysis. Purpose is to clarify all aspects onto the deepest meaning of problem resumed that has the title of every chapter. This book, offers a kind of answers for problems that forming the meaning of our existence, and the answer consists, in the end, in the clarification of every problem for the theme that it is a part of, together with other problems of the same theme put together. The answer I wanted to be for fundamental problems of existence. Anyone can find himself in this, because book watches philosophical and other kind of problems, also rational, but, both emotional, experiential, clearly said. Main problems in our existence are wishes, missing, and comunication with people in our life. The book is searching into a large area of feelings, emotions and questions answers about making clearer some of the particular problems of this type. My point is that it must be a connection between a large area of inner experiences that we have in any life situations and some answers and general lines that we search for understanding of inner experience, and so, all that we live and experience. My point of view is large, and it allows associations between domains that study the components of human being and human existence. I wanted, from all those, to find an deeper meaning wich answers to all type of life questions, for every in the most adequate way. Conclusions for those analyses are that there exists limits in our understanding about things, but it is positive that never a no is a end, like a way that never ends if you see the limit and also what the fact that you see it reveals, as something unique. How far can you reach? Pass limit, is come back with a new and surprising view for something you thought that was just passing, meaningless. The key of the book is that everyone can put himself in this place, and question himself, with an open mind and emotions, to find something that may be revealed, to an end. And this thing is some kind of signification for a life of thoughts, feelings and events and beyond all, is revealed some kind of events that gives them an unique value, for those who wanted to make this try. The answer is a signification that at any moment things have, <b>or</b> <b>may</b> not have, as <b>you</b> <b>may</b> see, <b>or</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> not see. But who sees the limit, rather than to be consciousness that a limit exists and you must see something new after that?Existence, problems, separation, unity, absence, wish, Solutions...|$|R
