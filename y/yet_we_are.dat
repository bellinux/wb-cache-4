500|$|At {{the end of}} the [...] "February Revolution" [...] of 1917, Tsar Nicholas II {{was forced}} to abdicate and {{political}} turmoil followed. Victoria wrote to Queen Marie of Romania in February 1917 that their home was surrounded by a mob, [...] "yet heart and soul we are with this movement of freedom which at the time probably signs our own death warrant ... We personally are losing all, our lives changed at one blow and <b>yet</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> almost leading the movement." [...] By March 1917, the revolution had spread all over Petrograd (Saint Petersburg). During this period Victoria, almost 41 years old, discovered she was again pregnant, which worried her because of her previous miscarriages and difficult pregnancies.|$|E
500|$|The brief [...] "Sea Song" [...] of 1907 was {{an early}} attempt by Grainger to write [...] "beatless" [...] music. This work, {{initially}} set over 14 irregular bars and occupying about 15 seconds of performing time, was a forerunner of Grainger's free-music experiments of the 1930s. Grainger wrote: [...] "It seems to me absurd {{to live in an}} age of flying, and yet not be able to execute tonal glides and curves". The idea of tonal freedom, he said, had been in his head since as a boy of eleven or twelve he had observed the wave-movements in the sea. [...] "Out in nature we hear all kinds of lovely and touching [...] "free" [...] (non-harmonic) combinations of tones; <b>yet</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> unable to take up these beauties... into the art of music because of our archaic notions of harmony." [...] In a 1941 letter to Scott, Grainger acknowledged that he had failed to produce any large-scale works {{in the manner of a}} Bach oratorio, a Wagner opera or a Brahms symphony, but excused this failure on the grounds that all his works before the mid-1930s had been mere preparations for his free music.|$|E

500|$|Besides word {{of mouth}} and {{opinions}} in letters, {{there were only a}} few published contemporary reviews. The writer and journalist John Stoddart (1773–1856), in a review of Lyrical Ballads, described [...] "Strange fits" [...] and [...] "She dwelt" [...] as [...] "the most singular specimens of unpretending, yet irresistible pathos". An anonymous review of Poems in Two Volumes in 1807 had a less positive opinion about [...] "I travell'd": [...] "Another string of flat lines about Lucy is succeeded by an ode to Duty". Critic Francis Jeffrey (1773–1850) claimed that, in [...] "Strange fits", [...] "Mr Wordsworth, however, has thought fit to compose a piece, illustrating this copious subject by one single thought. A lover trots away to see his mistress one fine evening, staring all the way at the moon: when he comes to her door, 'O mercy! to myself I cried, / If Lucy should be dead!' And there the poem ends!" [...] On [...] "A slumber did my spirit seal", Wordsworth's friend Thomas Powell wrote that the poem [...] "stands by itself, and is without title prefixed, <b>yet</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> to know, from the penetration of Mr. Wordsworth's admirers, that it is a sequel to the other deep poems that precede it, and is about one Lucy, who is dead. From the table of contents, however, we are informed by the author that it is about 'A Slumber;' for this is the actual title which he has condescended to give it, to put us out of pain as to what it is about." ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{the same}} time, Richard North {{argues that the}} Beowulf poet {{interpreted}} [...] "Danish myths in Christian form" [...] (as the poem would {{have served as a}} form of entertainment for a Christian audience), and states: [...] "As <b>yet</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> no closer to finding out why the first audience of Beowulf liked to hear stories about people routinely classified as damned. This question is pressing, given... that Anglo-Saxons saw the Danes as 's' rather than as foreigners."

2500|$|In 1998, McCain {{supported}} {{an unsuccessful}} {{bill that would}} have imposed a federal tax of $1.10 per pack on cigarettes to fund programs to cut underage smoking. [...] "I still regret we did not succeed", he said in October 2007. In 2007, McCain voted against legislation that would have used a 61-cents-per-pack tax to expand a children's health program, saying that he disagreed with the concept: [...] "We are trying to get people not to smoke, and <b>yet</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> depending on tobacco to fund a program that's designed for children's health?" [...] In February 2008 he said that he would have a [...] "no new taxes" [...] policy as president.|$|E
2500|$|To Robert Boyle in the 17th century, {{shortly before}} Isaac Newton, the aether was a {{probable}} hypothesis {{and consisted of}} subtle particles, one sort of which explained the absence of vacuum and the mechanical interactions between bodies, and the other sort of which explained phenomena such as magnetism (and possibly gravity) that were inexplicable {{on the basis of}} the purely mechanical interactions of macroscopic bodies, [...] "though in the ether of the ancients there was nothing taken notice of but a diffused and very subtle substance; <b>yet</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> at present content to allow that there is always in the air a swarm of steams moving in a determinate course between the north pole and the south".|$|E
2500|$|Constitution {{typically}} {{has implications}} for views on persistence: [...] how does an object persist over time if any of its parts (materials) change or are removed, {{as is the case}} with humans who lose cells, change height, hair color, memories, and <b>yet</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> said to be the same person today as we were when we were first born. For example, Ted Sider is the same today as he was when he was born—he just changed. But how can this be if many parts of Ted today did not exist when Ted was just born? Is it possible for things, such as organisms to persist? And if so, how? There are several views that attempt to answer this question. Some of the views are as follows (note, there are several other views): ...|$|E

2500|$|Is {{it seriously}} contemplated, may I ask, to repress these aspirations, {{to hold this}} aggrieved and angry {{multitude}} down by force? Because – let us make no mistake - it will come {{to that in the}} end. This is not a mere denial of liberty; it is a case of taking away liberty which has been long enjoyed. That process, however disguised, is an act of spoliation dependent on force but force is not solvent of human problems. One would think that in South Africa there would be no need to press home that truth. And <b>yet</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> apt to forget, in dealing with this problem, that you cannot kill the soul of the people; and that the spirit of man will not tamely submit to the loss of rights which materially and spiritually he values. ...|$|E

It was the pairs first title since coming back together after the 2012 Olympics. The win was commended by the Indian media as the duo were the only women's doubles pair from the country to win a Grand Prix title. Jwala expressed her concerns for lack of support for doubles in the country and prompted the association and the government to promote doubles. Jwala told NDTV in an interview, [...] "We though big wins would wake up concerned people but it hasn't happened <b>yet.</b> <b>We</b> <b>are</b> still confident of representing India at an international level but here, extra support is needed as we can't afford it on our own.|$|E
2500|$|On 5 January, as {{countries}} jockeyed to make large donations, Jan Egeland said, [...] "I'd {{rather see}} competitive compassion than no compassion", adding {{that too many}} countries were making pledges without any guarantee that the funds would arrive. Following the earthquake the previous year in Iran in Bam which killed 26,000 people, Iranian officials claimed to have received just US$17.5 million of the US$1 billion originally pledged. In mid-March 2005, the Asian Development Bank reported that the provision of over US$4 billion in aid promised by governments was behind schedule. Sri Lanka criticised the nations and organisations that clamoured to pledge donations, [...] "Not a penny had come through <b>yet.</b> <b>We</b> <b>are</b> doing the relief work with our government money. Sri Lanka is {{still waiting for the}} money pledged by the donors. Money pledged by the people has been pledged to the NGOs." ...|$|E

2500|$|Other {{parallels}} {{are presented}} and the article concludes, [...] "Solomon {{is said to}} have had 'a thousand and four hundred' chariots (1 Kings 1:26). This represents a prodigious army by ancient standards, and one which could only have been amassed {{over a long period of}} time by an established civilization. <b>Yet</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> told that only five years after the great King Solomon's death, the Egyptian Pharaoh Shishak and his allies invaded Judah and captured its fortified cities with little or no military resistance (2 Chron. 12). The Bible adds that Jerusalem itself was spared only after delivering up the entirety of King Solomon's accumulated wealth to Shishak. The rapidness with which Solomon's empire was established, as described by the Bible, and the ease with which it shortly thereafter submitted to a foreign power is also not consistent with the pattern set by other great ancient civilizations." ...|$|E
2500|$|In January 2011, the Armenian National Cinema Center {{announced}} that it was holding talks with world-known film director Steven Spielberg and Armenian American screenwriter Steven Zaillian to produce a full-length feature film about the Armenian Genocide. The cinema center director Gevorg Gevorgyan stated that [...] "On the 100th anniversary of the Genocide, we must have a film to demonstrate to the world. We want more than the films Mayrig or Ararat." [...] Over a year later, in February 2012 the center declined the claims that Spielberg is involved in producing such on the 100th anniversary of the genocide. Vardan Abovian, the deputy director of the Armenian National Film Academy, said that they [...] "indeed have plans on a movie on the Armenian genocide, however, this is still in the 'idea' phase and nothing has been decided <b>yet.</b> <b>We</b> <b>are</b> trying to find the budget."

2500|$|The {{incident}} occurred {{several months after}} the Secret Service's pledge in ACORN v. Secret Service not to discriminate against protesters. [...] "The charges against the Ranks were ultimately dismissed in court and the mayor and city council publicly apologized for the arrest. City officials also said that local law enforcement was acting {{at the request of}} Secret Service." [...] ACLU Senior Staff Attorney Chris Hansen pointed out that [...] "The Secret Service has promised to not curtail the right to dissent at presidential appearances, and <b>yet</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> still hearing stories of people being blocked from engaging in lawful protest," [...] said Hansen. [...] "It is time for the Secret Service to stop making empty promises." [...] The Ranks subsequently filed a lawsuit, Rank v. Jenkins, against Deputy Assistant to the President Gregory Jenkins and the Secret Service. [...] "The lawsuit, Rank v. Jenkins, is seeking unspecified damages as well as a declaration that the actions leading to the removal of the Ranks from the Capitol grounds were unconstitutional." [...] In August 2007, the Ranks settled their lawsuit against the Federal Government. The government paid them $80,000, but made no admission of wrongdoing. The Ranks' case against Gregory Jenkins is still pending in the District of Columbia.|$|E

2500|$|In his 1989 posthumous book, The Global Village, McLuhan, {{collaborating with}} Bruce R. Powers, {{provided}} a strong {{conceptual framework for}} understanding the cultural implications of the technological advances associated {{with the rise of}} a worldwide electronic network. This is a major work of McLuhan's because it contains the most extensive elaboration of his concept of Acoustic Space, and it provides a critique of standard 20th century communication models like the Shannon–Weaver model. McLuhan distinguishes between the existing worldview of Visual Space – a linear, quantitative, classically geometric model – and that of Acoustic Space – a holistic, qualitative order with a complex intricate paradoxical topology. [...] "Acoustic Space has the basic character of a sphere whose focus or center is simultaneously everywhere and whose margin is nowhere." [...] The transition from Visual to Acoustic Space was not automatic {{with the advent of the}} global network, but would have to be a conscious project. The [...] "universal environment of simultaneous electronic flow" [...] inherently favors right-brain Acoustic Space, <b>yet</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> held back by habits of adhering to a fixed point of view. There are no boundaries to sound. We hear from all directions at once. Yet Acoustic and Visual Space are in fact inseparable. The resonant interval is the invisible borderline between Visual and Acoustic Space.
