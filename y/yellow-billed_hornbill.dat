50|$|The eastern <b>yellow-billed</b> <b>hornbill</b> (Tockus flavirostris), {{also known}} as the {{northern}} <b>yellow-billed</b> <b>hornbill,</b> is a species of hornbill in the Bucerotidae family. It is found in Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda. It resembles the southern <b>yellow-billed</b> <b>hornbill,</b> but has blackish (not pinkish) skin around the eyes.|$|E
50|$|The {{southern}} <b>yellow-billed</b> <b>hornbill</b> flies powerfully. It alternates short gliding periods {{with heavy}} wing beats. The southern <b>yellow-billed</b> <b>hornbill</b> lacks the underwing coverts which enhances {{the flow of}} air when it flies.|$|E
50|$|The {{southern}} <b>yellow-billed</b> <b>hornbill</b> lives {{mostly in}} the dry, open savannas, {{but they are also}} very partial to woodlands when they can find them. When in woodlands, they seem to prefer acacia and broadleaved woodlands. The highest reported concentration of southern <b>yellow-billed</b> <b>hornbill</b> is in open mopane scrub.|$|E
50|$|Southern <b>yellow-billed</b> <b>hornbills</b> have a {{piercing}} cry. However {{it has a}} wide variety of sounds it can make such as, whistling, grunting and caqueting. They will use their loud calls to either delimit their territory or for long-distance communication. Like other Tockus, they will often accompany their calls with conspicuous physical displays.|$|R
50|$|Breeding season starts {{when the}} first autumn rain falls. The {{breeding}} season goes from September to march with the egg-laying peak between October and December. Eggs are laid during the wet season so different areas will have different peaks according to the local rainy season. For example, the peak generally occurs from November to February in the eastern regions and from December to March in the northwest regions of the southern <b>yellow-billed</b> <b>hornbill’s</b> range. These peaks coincide with the peak rainfall of the year.|$|R

50|$|Among {{creatures that}} prey on C. jonesii are large centipedes {{of the genus}} Scolopendra, the ground {{foraging}} red-billed hornbill (Tockus erythrorhynchus) and eastern <b>yellow-billed</b> <b>hornbill</b> (T. flavirostris), bushveld gerbil (Gerbilliscus leucogaster), Cape porcupine (Hystrix africaeaustralis) and lesser red musk shrew (Crocidura hirta).|$|E
50|$|The {{southern}} <b>yellow-billed</b> <b>hornbill</b> {{is often}} seen searching for food {{on the ground or}} in shrubs. It will not dig the ground, but it will overturn debris to find insects. It can also be seen pursuing insects by hopping heavily after it.|$|E
50|$|There {{are over}} 350 species of bird. These include grey-headed kingfisher, sunbirds, bee-eaters, Marabou stork, tawny eagle, Verreaux's eagle, bateleur, vulturine guineafowl, yellow-necked spurfowl, lilac-breasted roller, {{secretary}} bird, superb starling, northern red-billed hornbill, <b>yellow-billed</b> <b>hornbill,</b> and various vultures including the palm-nut vulture.|$|E
50|$|Southern <b>yellow-billed</b> <b>hornbill</b> eats mostly arthropods, {{particularly}} termites, beetles, larvae (beetles and termites), grasshoppers and caterpillars. It {{has also}} been seen eating centipedes and scorpions. They will occasionally eat small mammals when they can. To complete the diet, they will regularly eat berries, fruits, nuts and eggs from other species.|$|E
50|$|The {{southern}} <b>yellow-billed</b> <b>hornbill</b> (Tockus leucomelas) is a hornbill {{found in}} southern Africa. Yellow-billed hornbills feed {{mainly on the}} ground, where they forage for seeds, small insects, spiders and scorpions. This hornbill species is a common and widespread resident of dry thornveldt and broad-leafed woodlands. They can often be seen along roads and water courses.|$|E
50|$|The {{southern}} <b>yellow-billed</b> <b>hornbill</b> {{is active}} during morning, day and evening. At night, it will sleep {{high in a}} tree so it won’t be preyed on. They can be found alone, in couples or in small groups. They generally tend to be loners unless it is breeding season, nesting season or if there is local migration during dry season.|$|E
50|$|The casque {{that characterizes}} all {{hornbills}} is {{of a very}} modest size in the southern <b>yellow-billed</b> <b>hornbill.</b> It is small, but it covers almost {{the entire length of}} the beak in males (less so in females), and may give the impression that they do not actually have a casque. As in all hornbills, the size of the beak actually intrudes on the frontal vision of the bird and the first two neck vertebrae are fused together.|$|E
5000|$|Southern <b>yellow-billed</b> <b>hornbill</b> {{use their}} beaks {{as a pair}} of forceps. They will grasp their food between the tips and then toss it back in their throat where the short, stubby tongue will assist in {{swallowing}} the food. The inner cutting edges of the beak are serrated to facilitate the crushing and fragmentation of food. Most of the food is picked from the ground or from low vegetation. Their diet has some overlap with that of the southern ground hornbill [...]|$|E
50|$|They have white belly, grey neck, {{and black}} back plumage with {{abundant}} white spots and stripes. The neck has gray spots and the chest is lightly striated with black. Southern yellow-billed hornbills have no plumage pigmentation save for melanin, {{which can only}} produce shades of black and white. The eyes are usually yellow, though brown has also been seen. The skin around the eyes and in the malar stripe is pinkish. The related eastern <b>yellow-billed</b> <b>hornbill</b> from north-eastern Africa has blackish skin around the eyes.|$|E
50|$|HornbillsThe largest {{species is}} the {{southern}} ground hornbill. It occurs only in nature reserves. Other well-known species include the southern <b>yellow-billed</b> <b>hornbill,</b> the southern red-billed hornbill, the African grey hornbill and the trumpeter hornbill. Hornbills are characterised {{by a large}} downcurved bill which is frequently brightly colored and sometimes has a casque on the upper mandible. They are omnivores, eating both fruit and small animals such as chameleons; the ground hornbill is an adept hunter and will forage in packs, flushing out prey such as locusts, lizards and even tortoises.|$|E
50|$|Once {{the male}} {{southern}} <b>yellow-billed</b> <b>hornbill</b> has mated, {{it will stay}} with his mate and establish a territory that it will defend. The nests are placed in natural cavities in trees, cliffs or earth banks between 1 and 12 meters from the ground. The male then proceeds to bring bark, leaves and grass which will {{be put on the}} bottom of the nest. During this time, the female will seal herself inside the nest by blocking the entry with a wall made from her droppings and food remains. The male will help by bringing mud for her to work with.|$|E
40|$|Beaks are {{increasingly}} recognised as important contributors to avian thermoregulation. Several studies supporting Allen’s rule demonstrate how beak size is under strong selection related to latitude and/or air temperature (Ta). Moreover, active regulation of heat transfer from the beak {{has recently been}} demonstrated in a toucan (Ramphastos toco, Ramphastidae), with the large beak acting as an important contributor to heat dissipation. We hypothesised that hornbills (Bucerotidae) likewise use their large beaks for non-evaporative heat dissipation, and used thermal imaging to quantify heat exchange over a range of air temperatures in eighteen desert-living Southern Yellow-billed Hornbills (Tockus leucomelas). We found that hornbills dissipate heat via the beak at air temperatures between 30. 7 °C and 41. 4 °C. The difference between beak surface and environmental temperatures abruptly increased when air temperature was within ~ 10 °C below body temperature, indicating active regulation of heat loss. Maximum observed heat loss via the beak was 19. 9 % of total non-evaporative heat loss across the body surface. Heat loss per unit surface area via the beak more than doubled at Ta > 30. 7 °C compared to Ta < 30. 7 °C and at its peak dissipated 25. 1 Wm- 2. Maximum heat flux rate across the beak of toucans under comparable convective conditions was calculated to {{be as high as}} 61. 4 Wm- 2. The threshold air temperature at which toucans vasodilated their beak was lower than that of the hornbills, and thus had a larger potential for heat loss at lower air temperatures. Respiratory cooling (panting) thresholds were also lower in toucans compared to hornbills. Both beak vasodilation and panting threshold temperatures are potentially explained by differences in acclimation to environmental conditions and in the efficiency of evaporative cooling under differing environmental conditions. We speculate that non-evaporative heat dissipation may be a particularly important mechanism for animals inhabiting humid regions, such as toucans, and less critical for animals residing in more arid conditions, such as Southern Yellow-billed Hornbills. Alternatively, differences in beak morphology and hardness enforced by different diets may affect the capacity of birds to use the beak for non-evaporative heat loss. S 1 Data. Numerical data.
