500|$|Chelsea manager José Mourinho {{used his}} pre-match {{interview}} {{to state that}} his previous wins in the tournament had changed the way that clubs approach the League Cup: [...] "Lots of teams have followed us since then when we took the League Cup as a real competition, as a real challenge. It is a big competition." [...] He separated the final from the league season, saying, [...] "I don't think if we win the cup final we will win the league, or if we lose it we will lose the league." [...] He refused to discuss the suspension of Matić, dismissing it with [...] "If I speak to <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> I promise you I will be in big trouble". Despite opining that the two teams and the match officials would act fairly, he criticised players who dive, despite not naming any names. Mourinho also claimed that in after leaving Chelsea {{for the first time}} in September 2007, he was approached to manage Tottenham by chairman Daniel Levy, and again in 2012.|$|E
2500|$|Often the {{minister}} reads passages from well-known historical, sociological, or anthropological works, and finds in them inconspicuous {{references to the}} Blackman’s true history in the world.... Occasionally {{the minister}} chides the audience for its scepticism: “I know you don't believe me because I {{happen to be a}} Black man. Well, you can look it up in a book I’m going to tell <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> was written by a white man.” He then reads off references that his hearers are challenged to check for themselves. A single documented statement, however, may become the basis {{of a wide range of}} generalized non-sequiturs. The fact that a North Carolina slaveholder had an Arabic-speaking Muslim slave of unusual mathematical ability may be offered as evidence that all slaves brought to America were Moslem, Arabic-speaking, and learned. Similarly, historical facts may be indiscriminately mingled with myths and countermyths. (The Black Muslims in America, pp. 120–121) ...|$|E
