500|$|Given {{the large}} number of FMV games and Genesis ports, the Sega CD's game library has been criticized for its lack of depth. Full motion video quality was {{substandard}} on the Sega CD due to poor video compression software and the system's limited color palette, and the concept never caught on with the public. According to Digital Pictures founder Tom Zito, [...] "Sega CD could only put up 32 colors at a time, so <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>this</b> horrible grainy look to the images," [...] though the system was able to put up 64 colors at one time. Likewise, most Genesis ports for the Sega CD featured additional full motion video sequences, extra levels, and enhanced audio, but were otherwise identical to their Genesis release. The video quality in these sequences has also been criticized as comparable to an old VHS tape.|$|E
500|$|However, {{the extent}} that Ignition were {{willing to go to}} control access to the album {{generated}} more hype than could normally have been expected, and served to alienate members of both the print and broadcast media, as well as most Creation staff members. When [...] "D'You Know What I Mean?" [...] was planned as the first single, Ignition decided on a late release to radio so as to avoid too much advance exposure. However, three stations broke the embargo, and Ignition panicked. According to Greengrass: [...] "we'd been in these bloody bunker meetings for six months or something, and our plot was blown. 'Shit, it's a nightmare'." [...] BBC Radio 1 received a CD containing three songs ten days before the album's release, on condition that disc jockey Steve Lamacq talked over the tracks to prevent illegal copies being made by listeners. The day after Lamacq previewed the album on his show, he {{received a phone call from}} Ignition informing him that he would not be able to preview further tracks because he didn't speak enough over the songs. Lamacq said, [...] "I had to go on the air the next night and say, 'Sorry, but we're not getting any more tracks.' It was just absurd." [...] According to Creation's head of marketing John Andrews, [...] " [...] made people despise Oasis within Creation. <b>You</b> <b>had</b> <b>this</b> Oasis camp that was like 'I'm sorry, you're not allowed come into the office between the following hours. You're not allowed mention the word Oasis.' It was like a fascist state." [...] One employee recalled an incident [...] "when somebody came round to check our phones because they thought The Sun had tapped them." ...|$|E
