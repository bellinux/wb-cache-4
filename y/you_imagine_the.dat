500|$|As {{the longest}} living known orca, Granny is {{employed}} {{as an example}} in arguments against keeping whales in captivity, referencing the allegedly reduced lifespan of captive animals. The oldest orca in captivity is the 50-year-old Lolita {{who is at the}} Miami Seaquarium. The average lifespan for a captured orca is 20 to 30 years. Of Granny's age, Captain Pidcock of Ocean Ecoventures Whale Watching said [...] " [...] it’s mind-blowing to think that this whale is over 100 years old. [...] She was born before the Titanic went down. Can <b>you</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>the</b> things she’s seen in her lifetime?" ...|$|E

Harold Hobson wrote, [...] "Sir Ralph is an actor who, whatever his failure in heroic parts, however short of tragic grandeur his Othello or his Macbeth may have fallen, has nevertheless, in unromantic tweeds and provincial hats, received a revelation. There are more graceful players than he upon the stage; there is none who has been so touched by Grace." ...|$|E

He had at first wanted {{to call it the}} [...] "dungeon of despair", and also used terms like [...] "well of despair", and [...] "well of loneliness". Blum writes that his colleagues tried to persuade him not to use such descriptive terms, that a less visual name would be easier, politically speaking. Gene Sackett of the University of Washington in Seattle, one of Harlow's doctoral students who went on to conduct additional deprivation studies, said, [...] "He first wanted to call it a dungeon of despair.

In a late September interview on English DJ Tim Westwood's Radio show, Nas said, [...] "Hip-hop is dead because we as artists {{no longer have}} the power." [...] He went on to say, [...] "Could you imagine what 50 Cent could be doing, Nas, Jay, Eminem, if we were the Jimmy Iovines? Could <b>you</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>the</b> power we'd have? I think that's where we're headed." [...] He has described the album as a mixture of [...] "street" [...] records, [...] "political" [...] records and collaborations.
