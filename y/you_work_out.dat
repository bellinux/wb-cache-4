500|$|Kasongo and Thomas Kanza, {{a member}} of Lumumba's government, had been {{requested}} to visit Lumumba at his private house {{on the morning of}} 30 June {{before the start of the}} ceremonies to look over an early draft of Lumumba's planned speech. Also present were two secretaries of state and two Belgians. (One of the latter may have been the pacifist Jean Van Lierde.) Lumumba asked Kanza, [...] "Will <b>you</b> <b>work</b> <b>out</b> here with these others here to tidy up the text, and make it acceptable – a bit less explosive?" ...|$|E

[...] Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune commented that the lyric [...] "God gave you style and gave you grace," [...] Martin sings as if [...] "cataloguing the attributes he only wishes he had".

6000|$|... "Come inside {{just a few}} minutes," [...] {{repeated}} Cherry, deeply thoughtful. [...] "I've got {{a proposition}} to make to you that will reduce our expenses a lot and help <b>you</b> <b>work</b> <b>out</b> your own future and help me work out mine--and all on business principles." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he uttered finally, [...] "all you gotta do is write Bud Strothers, an' tell 'm {{not on the}} Boss's ugly tintype.--An' while you're about it, I'll send 'm {{the money}} to get my watch out. <b>You</b> <b>work</b> <b>out</b> the interest. The {{overcoat}} can stay there an' rot." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{dear old}} boy," [...] he said earnestly, [...] "there's {{nothing wrong with}} my figures. It's a {{mathematical}} certainty. What's the good of mathematics if not to help <b>you</b> <b>work</b> <b>out</b> that sort of thing? No, there's something deuced wrong with the machine itself, and I shall probably make a complaint to the people I got it from. Where did we get the incubator, old girl?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "If your prophecy {{be likely}} of fulfilment," [...] remarked the Philosopher, [...] "I console {{myself with the}} {{reflection}} that I am {{the oldest of the}} party. Myself; I never read these full and exhaustive reports of the next century without revelling in the reflection that before they can be achieved I shall be dead and buried. It may be a selfish attitude, but I should be quite unable to face any of the machine-made futures our growing guild of seers prognosticate. You appear to me, most of you, to ignore a somewhat important consideration--namely, that mankind is alive. <b>You</b> <b>work</b> <b>out</b> your answers {{as if he were a}} sum in rule-of-three: 'If man in so many thousands of years has done so much in such a direction at this or that rate of speed, what will he be doing--?' and so on. You forget he is swayed by impulses that can enter into no calculation--drawn hither and thither by powers that can never be represented in your algebra. In one generation Christianity reduced Plato's republic to an absurdity. The printing-press has upset the unanswerable conclusions of Machiavelli." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{desire to}} speak with the utmost respect of that science--philology--of which grammar is a part and parcel; yet {{everybody}} knows that grammar, as it is usually learned at school, affords no scientific training. It is taught just as you would teach the rules of chess or draughts. On the other hand, if I am to understand by a literary education the study of the literatures of either ancient or modern nations--but especially those of antiquity, and especially that of ancient Greece; if this literature is studied, not merely {{from the point of view}} of philological science, and its practical application to the interpretation of texts, but as an exemplification of and commentary upon the principles of art; if you look upon the literature of a people as a chapter in the development of the human mind, if <b>you</b> <b>work</b> <b>out</b> this in a broad spirit, and with such collateral references to morals and politics, and physical geography, and the like as are needful to make you comprehend what the meaning of ancient literature and civilisation is,--then, assuredly, it affords a splendid and noble education. But I still think it is susceptible of improvement, and that no man will ever comprehend the real secret of the difference between the ancient world and our present time, unless he has learned to see the difference which the late development of physical science has made between the thought of this day and the thought of that, and he will never see that difference, unless he has some practical insight into some branches of physical science; and you must remember that a literary education such as that which I have just referred to, is out of the reach of those whose school life is cut short at sixteen or seventeen.|$|E

5000|$|There is an {{interesting}} mathematical problem—if a set of objects consists {{of a large number}} of sub types—how does one count how many sub types there are?

5000|$|The precise {{meaning of}} the final scene is left to the audience. In his {{commentary}} on the Umbrella Entertainment DVD release, writer/producer Sam Pillsbury states, [...] "...we all thought it was quite simple; I mean, our intention was just that, what happened was, he died {{at the moment of}} the effect for a second time and he's now found himself in another world, what the hell's he gonna do...", he then says, more or less jokingly, that director Geoff Murphy being [...] "a Catholic or lapsed Catholic, it may well have been something to do with purgatory, and y'know, you being trapped in cyclical and going back into having to relive your thing until <b>you</b> <b>work</b> <b>out</b> your karma, possibly 'if I'm not' mixing my metaphors; anyway, enigmatic is good, I think, to a certain extent..." ...|$|E
5000|$|The song is not {{an attempt}} at some sort of wide-sweeping {{political}} statement, it's just about just seeing things from a personal level - what {{are you supposed to}} believe, what is actually right? How can <b>you</b> <b>work</b> <b>out</b> what is the truth, and what {{is the right thing to}} do? And there's so many different opinions, and you're supposed to have an opinion on what your country is doing, and yet it is so hard to even begin to gather all the facts. It's really distressing thing for people of our generation I think, the feeling of not being able to do anything about that. I guess that was something we were all feeling very acutely in the song. And I think the sounds of the song sum that up in a very tangible way.|$|E

Every time I see a beautiful sunset or a sunrise — and I've seen a bunch of them — I always think of the song, [...] "How Great Thou Art."

5000|$|By 4 May 1794, Desjardin had command over a 31,736-strong {{army that}} {{consisted}} of François Muller's division, 14,075 men, Jacques Fromentin's division, 10,619 soldiers, and Eloi Laurent Despeaux's division, 7,042 troops. One month later, Desjardin's Right Wing of the Army of the North had grown to a strength of 37,147 men. There were 43 infantry battalions, nine cavalry regiments, and three artillery companies under his orders. The French strategy for 1794 called for Desjardins to join the Right Wing with Louis Charbonnier's Army of the Ardennes to form a 60,000-man army to strike toward Mons. The objective was later changed to Charleroi. Unfortunately, the Army of the North's commander Jean-Charles Pichegru neglected {{one of the basic}} principles of warfare by failing to appoint a single overall commander for the army. Between 11 May and 3 June this force crossed the Sambre River three times and was driven back each time. In one overheard conversation between the co-commanders, Charbonnier sounded like a buffoon. He noted that the troops were starving and they needed to cross the river to feed them, to which Desjardin replied that the crossing must be arranged in a military fashion. Charbonnier answered, [...] "Good, <b>you</b> <b>work</b> <b>out</b> the details. As for me, I'm in charge of eating vegetables and pumping oil". One political agent attached to the army remarked, [...] "I did not see the shadow of treason, but the incapacity of the leaders was flagrant". Nevertheless, the oft-beaten army returned to the fray each time [...] "as if it had come fresh from the barracks".|$|E
5000|$|On 12 March {{he gave a}} {{presentation}} at an event hosted by the Committee for Economic Development of Australia (CEDA) called the SA Nuclear Energy Review. The event was intended to [...] "lead discussion around what a Nuclear Energy future in South Australia could look like and provide opportunity for CEDA members to feed into the Royal Commission into Nuclear Energy." [...] At the event, Stone claimed that nuclear energy was cheaper to generate than renewable energy, saying:"When <b>you</b> <b>work</b> <b>out</b> {{the cost of the}} electricity {{over the life of the}} (nuclear) kit…it is a lot cheaper than the honest number for renewables... If you add the cost of that (production) plus the cost of intermittency support, it’s a lot more expense and this is the issue where we need to get rational conversations."On 17 March, Stone presented at an event hosted by the South Australian Chamber of Mines & Energy. Nuclear power advocates Ben Heard of ThinkClimate Consulting and Ian Hore-Lacy of the World Nuclear Association also spoke at the event. Stone introduced himself as [...] "kind of Chief Trouble-maker" [...] before saying [...] "I'm not actually pro-nuclear- provided it's cheap, safe and low carbon, I'm very happy and this is where nuclear fits in the process." [...] His presentation provided background on nuclear power in the United Kingdom and offered advice for Australia. He said:"You only get one chance at this, this is a really important point here in South Australia. You've now kicked this process off. This is a once in a generation discussion. If it goes wrong now, it's your kids who will have it next time round. It won't slip for an election period, because people's memories for this stuff are long."He noted that polling in the UK had showed that women are more cautious than men when considering supporting nuclear power, and said that he would like to see more women enter the industry. He told the attendees that:"Everything you do is about creating trust and confidence. People opening their mouths and coming up with bright ideas that in any way damage that, need taking outside and dealing with... This is about national economic competitiveness. This isn't about politics. This is really big stuff."On 20 March, Stone gave {{a presentation}} at the Energy State of the Nation forum held by the Energy Policy Institute of Australia in Sydney. His presentation was entitled Challenges for future energy regulation and covered three topics: [...] "Structural changes in energy markets, technological changes including nuclear technology and regulatory responses and accountability including implications for the SA Nuclear Royal Commission." ...|$|E
