40|$|The {{design of}} mineral {{processing}} circuits is a complex, open-ended process. While several tools and methodologies are available, extensive data collection accompanied with trial-and-error simulation {{are often the}} predominant technical measures utilized throughout the process. Unfortunately, this approach often produces sub-optimal solutions, while squan-dering time and financial resources. This work proposes several new and refined method-ologies intended to assist during all stages of circuit design. First, an algorithm has been developed to automatically determine circuit analytical solutions from a user-defined circuit configuration. This analytical solution may then be used to rank circuits by traditional derivative-based linear circuit analysis or one of several newly proposed objective functions, including a <b>yield</b> <b>indicator</b> (the yield score) or a value-based indicator (the moment of iner-tia). Second, this work presents a four-reactor flotation model which considers both process kinetics and machine carrying capacity. The simulator is suitable for scaling laboratory data to predict full-scale performance.

Poor security often prevents access to sample locations and puts pressure on field surveyors, resulting in biased sampling and errors in data recording. Supportive methods using aerial digital photography for improving yield estimates were investigated in the UK in 2004, 2005, and 2010.

40|$|The B-CGMS project, {{started in}} 1998, is the {{adaptation}} to Belgian Conditions of the European Crop Growth Monitoring System (CGMS). This project involved 3 Belgian scientific institutes: the Walloon agricultural research Centre (CRA-W), the Flemish Institute for Technological Research (VITO) and the University of Liège (ULg). The main difference with the European {{system is that}} more detailed inputs (meteorological, soil and NUTS inputs) are used. Crop yields predictions are realised {{on a monthly basis}} during the growing season (from April to September) for 6 crops (winter wheat, winter barley, maize, Potato, sugar beet, winter rapeseed). Yields predictions as well as analyses of meteorological situation of the month and RS information {{on the state of the}} crops are published in agrometeorological bulletins sent by e-mail since 2002. The information is also available on the Internet website of the project ([URL] Crop yields predictions are produced through a combination of linear regression models which may include different categories of <b>yield</b> <b>indicators</b> (trend, meteo, RS and agrometeorological model outputs). Crop yields predictions procedure is currently semi-automated by the use of a statistical calibration toolbox (StatCaT). The evaluation of the project after 5 years of monitoring and prediction has first shown that final yields predicted B-CGMS as well as the ones predicted by MARS are coherent compared with official yields: no significant differences are observed. As far as the accuracy according to the month for which the prediction is made is concerned, we can notice that at agricultural circumscriptions level and for winter crops a lower precision of B-CGMS is observed before June and that there is no improvement in July (in comparison with June). The same evolution is observed for summer crops before July but in August and September, the prediction accuracy decreases. Even if calibration models present high adjusted coefficient of determination, the technological trend explains an important part of the variability and it is therefore necessary to consider the effect of a year factor on the quality of prediction in order to clearly the interest of the agrometeorological model. For some crops (as potato), adding agrometeorological yield outputs to models including already the technological trend allow to improve the quality of prediction especially for “extreme” year i. e. years where official yields move away significantly from the technological trend. For others crops as winter wheat, this improvement of the quality of prediction is not observed.

This research assesses {{the sustainability of}} different types of tourists in New Zealand by using the concept of yield and by developing <b>yield</b> <b>indicators</b> in the areas of financial, public sector and sustainable yield. The concept and indicators have been developed in cooperation with the New Zealand tourism sector and therefore provide a sector-driven approach to implement a sustainability assessment. The analysis shows that there are numerous 'trade-offs' between indicators when attempting to define the 'ideal visitor type'. Coach tourists, for example, are the largest spenders and generate the greatest Value Added in tourism on a per-day basis, but they contribute less to the financial sustainability of tourism when the costs of capital are accounted for. Coach tourists are highly concentrated in a few key destinations {{and at the same time}} produce substantial amounts of CO 2 emissions due to their air travel component. In contrast, backpacker and camping tourists provide greater financial yield and are more dispersed, but they are also the greatest user of publicly provided tourist attractions and therefore come at a higher cost to government than other tourist types.

To {{overcome this problem}} the following measures were taken, however without success: adaptation of the biomass with uncontaminated easily degradable substrates, pH control at very low levels, and a different form of inoculation (natural fermentation of the feed medium). The problem was solved by cooling the feed medium to 4 ºC to prevent acidification in the storage container, by eliminating nutrient supplementation to prevent possible formation of H 2 S by sulfate-reducing bacteria and by periodic washing of the support material to improve the food/microorganism ratio.

The aims of this paper are: (1) to investigate the effects of floodplain Roughened Strips for reducing and delaying flood peaks, (2) to compare the results of models (one- and two-dimensional hydraulic models) to find the limitations of application of the 1 D model. First, we assessed the effect of roughened strips on the propagation of flood hydrographs without/with roughened strips installed in four configurations of compound channels differing by width and slope. The regime always stayed subcritical. To quantify the effects of the roughened strips, proper indicators, such as relative attenuation and relative delay of peak, are proposed. For simple symmetrical arrangement of roughened strips, results of 1 -D and 2 -D models are quite similar: the effects are proportional to the roughened surface and the relative indicator values are almost constant with the flood return period. But in the case of more complex arrangements, it appeared that a 2 D model should be used to obtain accurate results. Finally, a test on river Hogneau was carried out. A simple interpolation method was devised to estimate a priori effects on flood mitigation of Roughened Strips implementation, using the results of simulation on the compound channels.

The dynamical quark molecular dynamics (qMD) model which is used is sketched, and results for exotica made of up to six (anti-) quarks are shown. The second part focuses on pentaquarks. The rapidity distribution are shown, {{and the distribution of}} strangeness is found to <b>yield</b> an <b>indicator</b> of thermalization and homogenisation of the deconfined quark system. Relative Theta^+ yields are found to be lower than thermal model estimates. Comment: 4 pages, 5 figures, to appear in the proceedings of Strangeness in Quark Matter 2004 (SQM 2004), Cape Town, South Africa, 15 - 20 September 200...|$|R
40|$|Milk {{recording}} (MR) is {{an essential}} breeder measure. Results are important for inheritance check. The occurrence of errors in the data may compromise the efficiency of breeding of dairy cows. The aim was possibility to {{reduce the incidence of}} MR database errors. Analyses of frequency distribution of MR data deviations from different sources and estimations of limits of difference acceptability in milk recording were performed. The results of MR control days of flowmeter in parlor (DMY) were paired to the AVG 7 results (average for 7 days) from the same flowmeter (n = 16, 247, original recordings of complete lactations). The individual differences in milk <b>yield</b> <b>indicators</b> were calculated between successive MR control days (DMY – R, monthly interval, the reference value (R) = previous DMY) for MR data file. A statistically significant correlation coefficient (AVG 7 and DMY) was 0. 935 (P < 0. 001) and was higher in comparison to the previous assessment under AMS conditions (automatic milking system; 0. 898; P < 0. 001). This means that 87. 3 % of the variability in the ​​milk yield values for MR (DMY) can be explained by variations in the AVG 7 values and vice versa. Difference tests confirmed significant differences (P < 0. 001) 0. 76 and 0. 55 kg between DMY (in MR) and AVG 7 for original and also refined data file. Mentioned differences, although statistically significant, correspond only to 2. 96 and 2. 15 % relatively. The use of multi–day milk yield average from the electronic flowmeter is an equivalent alternative to the use of record from one MR control day. Results are used in MR practice...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. To {{establish}} correlation {{dependence of}} influence of {{such factors as}} seeding rate, sowing time and seeding methods on <b>yield</b> <b>indicators,</b> {{as well as individual}} response of winter wheat varieties to them in case of the ecological system of seed production, that would allow to form elements of intensive varietal technology and obtain the genetically determined productivity potential of the variety in the future. Methods. Weight measuring was used to determine seed yield; the reliability of the experiment results was identified by statistical evaluation, analysis of variance and regression procedure. Results. During the period of investigation, the weather conditions differed significantly both for the temperature regime and the amount of precipitation, but the stability of grain and seed yield over years was the main requirement to varieties, that allowed to study the intergenotypic correlation relationships of crop yield indices and the dynamics of their changes under the effect of ecological factors. In the course of investigation, winter wheat yield indices were fixed annually from 684 plots, which were grouped and analyzed for factors of influence in order to ensure the complete certainty. Conclusions. Variants of investigation were defined for the certified seed yield and environmental factors (sowing time and seeding method, seeding rate), that had strong positive correlation relationships. Seeding rate and seeding method had the greatest impact on 1000 kernel weight. For tille­ring coefficient, varieties depending on the variant of the investigation had a negative close correlation relationship, which was greatly affected by seeding rate. For correlation relationships, winter wheat varieties ‘Bohdana’ and ‘Slavna’ appeared to be the most stable, ‘Chorniava’ and ‘Astarta’ were the most plastic...|$|R
