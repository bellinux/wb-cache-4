5|$|As Jennings {{was also}} {{achieving}} success in country {{music in the}} early 1970s, the pair were combined into a genre called outlaw country, since it did not conform to Nashville standards. The album Wanted! The Outlaws in 1976 with Jessi Colter and Tompall Glaser cemented the pair's outlaw image and became country music's first platinum album. Later that year Nelson released The Sound in <b>Your</b> <b>Mind</b> (certified gold in 1978 and platinum in 2001) and his first gospel album Troublemaker (certified gold in 1986).|$|E
5|$|The lyrics {{focus on}} how the bonding of two lovers can become so strong that they {{practically}} become one entity, through the act of sexual intercourse. Apart from the sexual connotations, there is an aspirational undercurrent to the lyrics, and like many of their subsequent songs, desire is explicitly linked to ambition–"Free <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> of doubt and danger/Be for real don't be a stranger/We can achieve it/We can achieve it".|$|E

60|$|Make up <b>your</b> <b>minds</b> to do right, to be right, to keep {{right by}} the help of God's Right and Holy Spirit, in the right road.

5|$|Anyone who {{has ever}} studied the history of American diplomacy, {{especially}} military diplomacy, knows that you might start in a war with certain things on <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> as a purpose {{of what you are}} doing, but in the end, you found yourself fighting for entirely different things that you had never thought of before... In other words, war has a momentum of its own and it carries you away from all thoughtful intentions when you get into it. Today, if we went into Iraq, like the president would like us to do, you know where you begin. You never know where you are going to end.|$|E
5|$|Harvey Greenberg {{presents}} a Freudian reading in his The Movies on <b>Your</b> <b>Mind,</b> {{in which the}} transgressions which prevent Rick from returning to the United States constitute an Oedipus complex, which is resolved only when Rick begins {{to identify with the}} father figure of Laszlo and the cause which he represents. Sidney Rosenzweig argues that such readings are reductive and that {{the most important aspect of}} the film is its ambiguity, above all in the central character of Rick; he cites the different names which each character gives Rick (Richard, Ricky, Mr. Rick, Herr Rick and boss) as evidence of the different meanings which he has for each person.|$|E
