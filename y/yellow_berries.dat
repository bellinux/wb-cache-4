To attract and protect the local Greek Orthodox population, he granted it special privileges, such as special administrative status as a waqf (a religious endowment) of the Sharif of Mecca, tax exemptions and the prohibition of Ottoman troops from passing through the town. He also endowed it with both a mosque (destroyed after the Greek annexation of Thessaly in 1881) and a church, St Nicholas Turahan, which survives to this day. Turahan also endowed many other public buildings such as mosques, monasteries, madrasas, schools, caravanserais, bridges and baths across the province. He also took care to maintain and foster the Thessalian cotton, silk and wool textile industry, to the extent that later generations attributed to him the introduction of new dye techniques based on <b>yellow</b> <b>berries,</b> madder and the kali plant, used in the manufacture of potash. From there these materials spread to the rest of Rumelia and thence to Western Europe.|$|E
25|$|The {{color of}} the berries can vary {{depending}} on the species, but most produce a white berry with slight tones of green. Some produce orange berries and others <b>yellow</b> <b>berries,</b> though. Still others will produce berries that start off white, but then change to another color with time. Philodendrons that produce orange berries tend to be members of the section Calostigma. Contained within the berries are the seeds which are extremely small compared to other members of the Araceae family. The berries often give off odors to attract animals to eat and disperse them. For example, Philodendron alliodorum berries are known to emit an odor similar to that of garlic. The animals that distribute the seeds depends on the species, but some possible dispersers include bats and monkeys. Insects also may be responsible for dispersing seeds, as beetles and wasps have been seen feeding on philodendron berries.|$|E

Three twigs on this bush grew close together; the first bore three <b>yellow</b> <b>berries</b> and one red; the second twig bore four yellow and one red; and the third four red and one yellow.

60|$|Many {{analogous}} facts {{could be}} given, showing how apparently capricious {{is the principle}} of inheritance. All the seedlings {{from a variety of}} the Barberry (B. vulgaris) with red leaves inherited the same character; only about one-third of the seedlings of the copper Beech (Fagus sylvatica) had purple leaves. Not one out of a hundred seedlings of a variety of the Cerasus padus, with yellow fruit, bore yellow fruit: one-twelfth of the seedlings of the variety of Cornus mascula, with yellow fruit, came true (12/44. These statements are taken from Alph. De Candolle 'Bot. Geograph.' page 1083.): and lastly, all the trees raised by my father from a yellow- berried holly (Ilex aquifolium), found wild, produced <b>yellow</b> <b>berries.</b> Vilmorin (12/45. Verlot op. cit. page 38.) observed in a bed of Saponaria calabrica an extremely dwarf variety, and raised from it a large number of seedlings; some of these partially resembled their parent, and he selected their seed; but the grandchildren were not in the least dwarfed: on the other hand, he observed a stunted and bushy variety of Tagetes signata growing {{in the midst of the}} common varieties by which it was probably crossed; for most of the seedlings raised from this plant were intermediate in character, only two perfectly resembling their parent; but seed saved from these two plants reproduced the new variety so truly, that hardly any selection has since been necessary.|$|E
6000|$|After all we {{got little}} of the sargasso. Only in a sailing ship, and in calms or light breezes, can its treasures be explored. [...] Twelve knots an hour is a pace {{sufficient}} to tear off the weed, as it is hauled alongside, all living things which are not rooted to it. We got, therefore, no Crustacea; neither did we get a single specimen of the Calamaries, {8} which may be described as cuttlefish carrying hooks on their arms as well as suckers, the lingering descendants of a most ancient form, which existed {{at least as far}} back as the era of the shallow oolitic seas, x or y thousand years ago. A tiny curled Spirorbis, a Lepraria, with its thousandfold cells, and a tiny polype belonging to the Campanularias, with a creeping stem, which sends up here and there a yellow-stalked bell, were all the parasites we saw. But the sargasso itself is a curious instance of the fashion in which one form so often mimics another of a quite different family. When fresh out of the water it resembles not a sea-weed so much as a sprig of some willow-leaved shrub, burdened with <b>yellow</b> <b>berries,</b> large and small; for every broken bit of it seems growing, and throwing out ever new berries and leaves-- or what, for want of a better word, must be called leaves in a sea- weed. For it must be remembered that the frond of a sea-weed is not merely leaf, but root also; that it not only breathes air, but feeds on water; and that even the so-called root by which a sea-weed holds to the rock is really only an anchor, holding mechanically to the stone, but not deriving, as the root of a land-plant would, any nourishment from it. Therefore it is, that to grow while uprooted and floating, though impossible to most land plants, is easy enough to many sea-weeds, and especially to the sargasso.|$|E
60|$|In {{the mean}} time Helen walked on alone, a little behind {{the rest of}} the party; for by this time Elizabeth and Anne had come up with the others, and had passed her. As they entered a little copse, she began to {{recollect}} herself. She had from her infancy been accustomed to give way to fits of peevishness and fretfulness, thinking that as long as her ill-humour did not burst forth in open name, as Elizabeth's used formerly to do, there was no great harm in letting it smoulder away, and make herself and everyone else uncomfortable. Some time ago, something had brought conviction to her mind that such conduct was not much better than bearing malice and hatred in her heart, and she had resolved to cure herself of the habit. Then came her visit to Dykelands, where everything went on smoothly, and there was little temptation to give way to ill-humour, so that she had almost forgotten her reflections on the subject, till the present moment, when she seemed suddenly to wake and find herself in the midst of one of her old sullen moods. She struggled hard against it, and as acknowledging ill temper is one great step towards conquering it, she soon recovered sufficiently to admire the deep pink fruit of the skewer-wood, and the waxen looking red and <b>yellow</b> <b>berries</b> of the wild guelder rose, when suddenly the rear of the darkness dim which over-shadowed her spirits was scattered by the lively din of a long loud whistle from Rupert, who was concealed from her by some trees, a little in advance of her. She hastened forwards, and found him and all the others just emerged from the wood, and standing on an open bare common where neither castle nor cottage was to be seen, nothing but a carpet of purple heath, dwarf furze, and short soft grass upon which a few cows, a colt, and a donkey, were browsing. The party were standing together, laughing, some moderately, others immoderately.|$|E

The objective of this research was to analyze the genetic relationships of AGK- 1 cultivar with 11 red berries Arabica coffee cultivars based on simple sequence repeats (SSR) markers to find polymorphisms and clustering. The research was carried out at the Molecular Laboratory of Indonesian Industrial and Beverage Crops Research Institute and Biology Molecular Laboratory of Indonesian Center for Agricultural Biotechnology and Genetic Resources Research and Development, from January to March 2015. These twelve Arabica coffee cultivars were obtained from Garut Regency. A total of 12 SSR primers were used to investigate the genetic relationships of the plant. The result showed that 12 SSR markers were adequate to identify the relationships among 12 Arabica coffee cultivars. The genetic clustering obtained in this study is related to plant morphology, particularly plant growth characters, such as tall, semi dwarf and dwarf. AGK- 1 cultivar genetically related to ABP- 2, one of red berries cultivars that originated from Brazil. Both of these cultivars have the same growing type characters (i. e. semi dwarf). AGK- 1 cultivar that has <b>yellow</b> <b>berry</b> color presumably derived from an open pollinated red berries parents, mainly ABP- 2 cultivar.
