50|$|The rugs tend to {{be based}} on a cotton warp and have a thin, tightly knotted pile. Most Abadeh rugs are closely cut making them very flat. Although some of the older Abadehs vary in style, many of the new designs are easily recognisable. These new designs, known as Heybatlu consist of a single diamond shaped {{medallion}} in the centre with smaller medallions on each corner. The pattern is typically geometrical flowers or animals and the main colours are light reds or burnt orange on top of a dark blue background with strong green details. The corners or borders are generally ivory in colour. Although some Abadeh and Shiraz rugs appear similar Abadeh can normally be differentiated by their higher knot counts as well as the fact that the warp is invariably cotton. The rugs are almost always exclusively medium in size and the KPSI of an average Abadeh is around 90. As always in the rug-world <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>pay</b> for however in general Abadeh are well made and fairly popular items, particularly in modern interiors or those with a Mediterranean or North African style.|$|E

We analyze this principle in an experiment in which ‘managers ’ make one-period investment decisions and ‘owners ’ predict these decisions. Three alternative per-formance measures are considered: earnings, ROI, and residual income. We find that, although managers overinvest (underinvest) on average when they are eval-uated at earnings (ROI), owners do not get what they pay for from the majority of managers when using earnings or ROI as performance measures. Without information about managers ’ decisions, owners overestimate {{the effectiveness of these}} performance measures for inducing individually rational behavior. When confronted with managers ’ decisions in early rounds, owners consistently revise their beliefs, but their overall estimation quality remains relatively low...|$|E

40|$|No {{drainage}} {{work should be}} carried out before the drainage characteristics of the soil are established by a site and soil test pit investigation. • Two types of drainage system exist: a groundwater drainage system and a shallow drainage system. The design of the system depends entirely on the drainage characteristics of the soil. • Distinguishing between {{the two types of}} drainage systems essentially comes down to whether or not a permeable layer is present (at a workable depth) that will allow the flow of water with relative ease. If such a layer is evident, a piped drain system at that depth is likely to be effective. If no such layer is found during soil test pit investigations, {{it will be necessary to}} improve the drainage capacity of the soil. This involves a disruption technique such as moling, gravel moling or subsoiling in tandem with collector drains. • Drains are not effective unless they are placed in a free draining soil layer or complimentary measures (mole drainage, subsoiling) are used to improve soil drainage capacity. If water is not moving through the soil in one or other of these two ways, the water table will not be lowered. • Outfall level must not dictate the drainage system depth. If a free draining layer is present, it must be utilised. • Drain pipes should always be used for drains longer than 30 m. If these get blocked it is a drainage stone and not a drainage pipe issue. • Drainage stone should not be filled to the top of the field trench except for very limited conditions (the bottom of an obvious hollow). Otherwise it is an extremely expensive way of collecting little water. • Most of the stone being used for land drainage today is too big. Clean aggregate in the 10 – 40 mm (0. 4 to 1. 5 inch approx) grading band should be used. Generally <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>pay</b> for. • Subsoiling is not effective unless a shallow impermeable layer is being broken or field drains have been installed prior to the operation. Otherwise it will not have any long-term effect and may do more harm than good. • Most land drainage systems are poorly maintained. Open drains should be clean and as deep as possible and field drains feeding into them should be regularly rodded or jetted. Technical manua...|$|E

30|$|The Fair Benchmarking project, {{funded by}} the EPSRC (EP/I 034408 / 1), was {{conducted}} at the University of Surrey between 1 st April 2011 and 31 st January 2012 to attempt to address this vexed question of value-for-money. The project aimed at the practical characterisation of IaaS Cloud resources by assessing the performance of three public Cloud providers and one private Cloud system. Performance was assessed {{in relation to a}} set of established, reasonably informative, and relatively straightforward to run, benchmarks (so-called micro-benchmarks). Our intention was not to create a single league table in respect to “best” performance on an individual benchmark, d although we do envisage that such data could be constructed into something like a Cloud Price-Performance Index (CPPI) which offers at least one route to future work. We were more interested in whether Cloud resource provision was consistent and reliable, or whether it presents variability – both initially and over time - that would be expected to impact on any application running on such resources. This becomes a matter of Quality of Service (QoS), and leads further to questions regarding the granularity of the Service Level Agreement (SLA). Arguably, variable performance should be matched by variable price - <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>pay,</b> in contrast to paying for what you get – but there would be little gain for providers already operating at low prices and margins in such a market. Given an appropriate set of benchmark measurements as a means to undertake a technical assessment, and deliberately making no attempt to optimize performance against such benchmarks, we consider it should become possible for a Cloud Broker to rapidly assess provisioned resources, and either discard those not meeting the QoS required, or retain them (for the present payment period) in case they become suitable for lesser requirements. Whilst {{it may be possible to}} make matches amongst similar “labels” on virtual machines (advertised memory of a certain number of GB, advertised storage of GB/TB, and so on), such matching can rapidly become meaningless with many appearing above or below some given value or within some given price range. The experiments undertaken were geared towards obtaining better insights about differences in performance across providers, but also indicated several areas for further investigation. These insights could also be of interest to those setting up private Clouds - in particular built using OpenStack - in terms of sizing such a system, to users to obtain an understanding of relative performance of different systems, and to institutions and funding councils seeking to de-risk commitments to Cloud infrastructures.|$|E
40|$|Two Guys from Lincoln: Cameron Shaw and Craig Roper {{offers the}} work of two {{contemporary}} artists who are inheritors of the anti-art tradition that continued {{in the wake of}} Duchamp with Warhol 2 ̆ 7 s use of popular imagery and, more recently, Koons 2 ̆ 7 controversial kitsch sculpture. Though distinct in their visions of art and the world, Shaw and Roper share more than their home town. As social and aesthetic contemporaries these two artists arrive at conclusions that suggest a generational commonality. Both artists use assemblage to address issues such as the disillusionment of youth, emblems of male dominance, the ambiguity of history, and the death of the American dream. And both artists have developed iconographies that convey multiple meanings about our collective memory. Shaw 2 ̆ 7 s highly crafted constructions and his interest in history complement Roper 2 ̆ 7 s irreverent objects and his investigations of popular culture. Together they form a compelling commentary on contemporary values. A combination of found and made elements, Craig Roper 2 ̆ 7 s objects are at once casual and confrontational. But their informal appearance belies serious content. Cheap Art, Cheap Bourbon # 2 incorporates a photographic diptych representing ajackalope labeled 2 ̆ 2 cheap art 2 ̆ 2 and the image of a framed wildlife painting of a duck inscribed as 2 ̆ 2 cheap bourbon. 2 ̆ 2 The two photos are mounted with thumb tacks onto a crude sheet of Styrofoam. Beneath this quirky union is a wooden shelf displaying two corresponding bottles of 2 ̆ 2 Bourbon de Luxe 2 ̆ 2 and a pair of shot glasses. The mixed metaphors of Cheap Art, Cheap Bourbon make explicit connections between the fantastic deception of the mythical creature, the jackal ope, and the implied manipulation of the art market and the promotion of rote representation {{in the form of the}} duck picture as 2 ̆ 2 art. 2 ̆ 2 By juxtaposing these two images with the bottles of whiskey, Roper suggests that all these things are aesthetically related, that cheap bourbon and cheap art are equally accessible at the lower echelons of consumerism. This 2 ̆ 2 <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>pay</b> for 2 ̆ 2 message was delivered with a twist when Roper offered an earlier version of the piece for sale at a price of merely 100. By making the work so readily available, the artist relegated his own work to the level of the kitsch objects he parodies. Also, the raw construction of Cheap Art, Cheap Bourbon challenges the elevated standards of traditional fine art. The viewer concludes that cheap art (a. k. a. bad art) is incestuously related to inferior values, and ultimately contributes to the deterioration of our culture...|$|E
