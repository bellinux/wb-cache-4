25|$|His term as rector was brief, though, for on June 9, 1982, he was {{appointed}} coadjutor bishop to the then controversial and prophetic Bishop Francisco Claver, of Diocese of Malaybalay, Bukidnon. In this moment of difficulty, Rosales recalled that a stampita (holy picture) dropped from his breviary (liturgy of the hours). It was from Mother (now Blessed) Teresa of Calcutta. When he picked it up, he saw the writing at the back. It read: “Allow God to use <b>you</b> <b>without</b> first consulting you.” These words brought peace to his soul. On September 14, 1984, Rosales succeeded the Bishop of Malaybalay taking complete authority over the diocese. He started his ministry in Malaybalay by forming with his people, especially the priest and religious there, {{a vision of the}} diocese: that of the total development of every person and all persons, brought about by Jesus Christ. In that difficult assignment, he was able to bring about the unity of the clergy as they struggled especially for justice, peace and environmental protection. He often looks back to his days there as the golden moments of his ministry.|$|E

500|$|... "Within <b>You</b> <b>Without</b> You" [...] was {{included}} on the 2006 remix album Love, which was created for the Cirque du Soleil stage show of the same name. Harrison's vocal appears over the rhythm section from [...] "Tomorrow Never Knows", after the track opens with Lennon's lyric from the latter song. Reviewing the album for PopMatters, Zeth Lundy writes: [...] "The 'Within <b>You</b> <b>Without</b> You'/'Tomorrow Never Knows' mash-up, perhaps the most thrilling and effective track on the entire disc, fuses two especially transcendental songs into one:... a union of two ambiguous, open-ended declarations of spiritual pursuit." [...] Paul Moody of Uncut similarly considers {{it to be the}} [...] "best of all" [...] the mashups on Love, with the two tracks' [...] "cosmic drones... fitted together like a glove". In their chapter on the Beatles' psychedelic period in The Cambridge Companion to the Beatles, authors Russell Reising and Jim LeBlanc describe [...] "Within <b>You</b> <b>Without</b> You/Tomorrow Never Knows" [...] as [...] "the most musically and visually stunning segment" [...] of the Cirque du Soleil show.|$|E
500|$|Writing for Rolling Stone in 2002, David Fricke {{included}} [...] "Within <b>You</b> <b>Without</b> You" [...] on {{his list}} of the [...] "25 Essential Harrison Performances". He described it as, variously, the Beatles' [...] "purest excursion... into raga", and [...] "at once beautiful and severe, a magnetic sermon about materialism and communal responsibility {{in the middle of}} a record devoted to gentle Technicolor anarchy". In his review of the 50th anniversary edition of Sgt. Pepper for the same publication, Mikal Gilmore said that only [...] "Within <b>You</b> <b>Without</b> You" [...] and Lennon's [...] "A Day in the Life" [...] transcend the album's legacy as [...] "a gestalt: a whole that was greater than the sum of its parts".|$|E
500|$|Musicologist Walter Everett lists Spirit's [...] "Mechanical World" [...] and the Incredible String Band's [...] "Maya", both {{released}} in 1968, {{and much of}} the Moody Blues' 1969 album To Our Children's Children's Children as works that were directly influenced by the Beatles' song. Dead Can Dance's 1996 album Spiritchaser includes the track [...] "Indus", the melody of which was found to be very similar to that of [...] "Within <b>You</b> <b>Without</b> You". The duo's singer, Lisa Gerrard, told The Boston Globe that they had obtained Harrison's blessing but [...] "the [...] pushed it", with the result that they were forced to give the former Beatle a partial songwriting credit. In their 1978 television film satirising the Beatles' history, All You Need Is Cash, the Rutles parodied [...] "Within <b>You</b> <b>Without</b> You" [...] on the track [...] "Nevertheless", performed by Rikki Fataar in the role of Stig O' Hara. Harrison himself included musical quotations from [...] "Within <b>You</b> <b>Without</b> You" [...] in his 1987 song [...] "When We Was Fab" [...] and in the instrumental [...] "Marwa Blues", {{released in}} 2002 on his final studio album, Brainwashed.|$|E

500|$|Harrison {{recorded}} [...] "Within <b>You</b> <b>Without</b> You" [...] for the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, {{an album}} based around Paul McCartney's {{vision of a}} fictitious band that would serve as the Beatles' alter egos, after their decision to quit touring. Harrison {{had little interest in}} McCartney's concept; he later admitted that, following his return from India, [...] "my heart was still out there", and working with the Beatles again [...] "felt like going backwards". Harrison presented the song after it was decided to exclude his composition [...] "Only a Northern Song", which the Beatles recorded in February 1967. In contrast to his prominence as a songwriter on Revolver, [...] "Within <b>You</b> <b>Without</b> You" [...] was Harrison's sole composition on Sgt. Pepper.|$|E

The education Harrison received in India, particularly regarding the illusory nature of the material world, resonated following his experiences with the hallucinogenic drug LSD (commonly known as [...] "acid") and informed his lyrics to [...] "Within <b>You</b> <b>Without</b> You". Having considered leaving the Beatles {{after the completion of}} their third US tour, on 29 August 1966, he instead gained a philosophical perspective on the effects of the band's international fame. He later attributed [...] "Within <b>You</b> <b>Without</b> You" [...] to his having [...] "fallen under the spell of the country" [...] after experiencing the [...] "pure essence of India" [...] through Shankar's guidance.|$|E

500|$|Ian Inglis {{writes that}} the emotion Harrison conveys on the track [...] "belies its {{apparently}} trivial lyrics" [...] and that, together with the instrumentation and backing vocals, his pleas [...] "create an unusually atmospheric and strangely moving song". Writing for Rough Guides, Chris Ingham deems the song to be [...] "essential Beatlemusic"; he views it as Harrison's [...] "most haunting and convincing musical contribution of the period", after [...] "Within <b>You</b> <b>Without</b> You", as well as [...] "possibly the most unnerving of all Beatles tracks". In a 2002 review for Mojo, Charles Shaar Murray described the song as [...] "eerie, serpentine" [...] and [...] "a fine and worthy companion for Peppers Within <b>You</b> <b>Without</b> You". Writing in Uncut that same year, Carol Clerk called it [...] "a weirdly atmospheric triumph".|$|E
500|$|According to the Beatles' {{official}} biographer, Hunter Davies, {{writing in}} 1968, some contemporary reviewers {{speculated that the}} burst of laughter {{at the end of}} [...] "Within <b>You</b> <b>Without</b> You" [...] was inserted by Harrison's bandmates to mock the song. Davies corrected this misconception, saying: [...] "It was completely George's idea." [...] In a review published five months after the release of Sgt. Pepper, Hit Parader considered that the album had not endured as well as the Beatles' previous works, and opined: [...] "Harrison has produced a soothing, sinuous, exotic sound for 'Within <b>You</b> <b>Without</b> You'. But even though his repetitious recitation of elementary Far Eastern philosophy is probably intended to reflect the infinity of the universe, it soon becomes a bit monotonous. The laughter at the end seems to be deflating the pretentiousness of the lyrics." ...|$|E

500|$|Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band was {{released}} on 26 May 1967, with [...] "Within <b>You</b> <b>Without</b> You" [...] sequenced as the opening track on side two of the LP. Greene notes that for many listeners at the time, the song provided their [...] "first meaningful contact with meditative sound". In his 1977 book The Beatles Forever, Nicholas Schaffner likened [...] "Within <b>You</b> <b>Without</b> You" [...] to Hermann Hesse's Siddhartha – an influential novel among the counterculture during the Summer of Love – {{in terms of the}} song's evocation of Hesse's [...] "idealization of individuality" [...] and [...] "vision of a mysterious East".

500|$|Having covered [...] "Within <b>You</b> <b>Without</b> You" [...] in 1967, the Soulful Strings {{included}} [...] "The Inner Light" [...] {{on their}} album Another Exposure the following year.

500|$|Musicologist Allan Moore {{says that}} Harrison's [...] "command of the quasi-Indian medium is {{of a very}} high order" [...] and, {{with regard to the}} song's message, he writes: [...] "In its explicit, prescient call to the me-generation, perhaps 'Within <b>You</b> <b>Without</b> You' is a key track ... expressing the deepest {{commitment}} to the counter-culture."
