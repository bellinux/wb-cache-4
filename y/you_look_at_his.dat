2500|$|In a December {{interview}} manager Joe Maddon said: [...] "I'm {{still a big}} Gabe Kapler fan. <b>You</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> OPS {{over the}} last couple of years versus left-handed pitching, it's among the best in all of baseball".|$|E
2500|$|On March 23, 2008, Breslow was claimed off {{outright}} waivers [...] by the Cleveland Indians and {{was added}} to the 40-man roster. Breslow was out of minor league options, so the Indians had to keep him on their big league club out of camp, or expose him to waivers again. Breslow won the final spot on the Indians' Opening Day roster. [...] "He's strong", Cleveland manager Eric Wedge said. [...] "I {{want to be able to}} use him two innings. He's done that—if <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> innings pitched the last couple of years versus appearances." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{never even}} heard his name till {{last week when he}} made threats and rants. The guy is a fucking idiot, making threats to me, Clooney, Eli Roth, says he has a doctorate—but uses the word [...] "retard" [...] in his vocabulary, come on. When <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> videos, what is {{interesting}} are the backgrounds. I guess his low rent offices, with 15 year old 3/4 machines, archaic computers, this is just some dumb chump trying to get some fame when he has none, so he has to make YouTube lame quality anger rants. This guy just wants attention because he can't get any for the so called movies he makes. Nothing sadder when he had his screening in LA to an over half empty movie house.|$|E
6000|$|Rhoda nodded. ''E needs one, too, but 'e ain't {{entitled}} to it. <b>You</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>'is</b> lease--third drawer {{on the left}} in that Bombay cab'net--an' next time 'e comes you ask 'im to read it. That'll choke 'im off, because 'e can't!' ...|$|R

6000|$|BLUNTSCHLI (with a boyish laugh of delight). That'll do. Thank <b>you.</b> (<b>Looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> {{watch and}} {{suddenly}} becomes businesslike.) Time's up, Major. You've managed those regiments {{so well that}} you are sure {{to be asked to}} get rid of some of the Infantry of the Teemok division. Send them home by way of Lom Palanka. Saranoff: don't get married until I come back: I shall be here punctually at five in the evening on Tuesday fortnight. Gracious ladies--good evening. (He makes them a military bow, and goes.) ...|$|R
2500|$|Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament said of Cornell: [...] "I’ve {{always said}} that Chris was the {{greatest}} songwriter to ever come out of Seattle. Jimi Hendrix could play the guitar like crazy, but Chris had the song-writing chops that we all sort of hoped to get to {{at different points in}} our songwriting careers. He had a way he could wrap a melody around odd time signatures and weird parts and make them catchy. He was a beautiful wordsmith. If <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> lyrics, he obviously was processing his pain and depression, and all of those things. I think that’s part of what people, myself included, responded to when he was singing. With the songwriting he had that voice, there’s not too many people that have that many options with their voice. He could do {{a lot of different things}} with it, and have a lot of different characters in that voice. I feel so lucky that I got to be in a project with him, got to hang out with him, and just sort of witness his greatness." ...|$|E
60|$|THE BYSTANDER. He ain't a tec. He's a {{blooming}} busybody: that's what he is. I tell <b>you,</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> boots.|$|E
6000|$|He stepped {{close to}} Erick, looking keenly into his face. [...] "Who are <b>you?</b> <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> chin--he never shaved with a {{sharpened}} stone! Something is wrong here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed, I say, dear Lady Penelope," [...] {{answered}} Miss Digges, whose ready chatter we {{have already}} introduced to the reader, [...] "he is a very handsome man, though his nose is too big, and his mouth too wide--but his teeth are like pearl--and he has such eyes!--especially when your ladyship spoke to him. I don't think <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> eyes--they are quite deep and dark, and full of glow, like what you read {{to us in the}} letter from that lady, about Robert Burns." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{must take}} care, however, in {{neither of these}} last two particulars, to do {{injustice}} to our little English friend here; and before we come to his feathers, must ask <b>you</b> to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> bill and his feet.|$|R
6000|$|... 'If {{the cousins}} {{come in from}} Ormersfield, I shall tell Louis to take <b>you</b> to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> farm. It would be very good for you--My dear, what is it?' for Mary's ears and neck, all that she could see, were crimson.|$|R
6000|$|... "He was {{a common}} seaman, sir," [...] said the mate. [...] "You can see that if <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> fingers." [...] He turned out his pockets as he spoke and brought to light a pack of cards, some tarred string, and a bundle of Brazilian tobacco.|$|E
6000|$|... "A brute I {{never put}} my leg on yet. He was sent down to Wilcox here, out of Lincolnshire, because they couldn't get anybody to ride him there. They say he goes {{with his head}} up in the air, and won't look at a fence that isn't as high as his breast. But I think he'll do here. I never saw a better made beast, or one with more power. Do <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> shoulders. He's to be had for seventy pounds, {{and these are the}} sort of horses I like to buy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are dreadfully hard to please," [...] {{said the}} Very Imp. [...] "I have offered {{them to you}} loose, and I have offered them {{fastened}} to a wall, and now the best thing I {{can do is to}} give you a chance at one of them that can't move at all. It is the Ghastly Griffin and is enchanted. He can't stir so much as the tip of his whiskers for a thousand years. You can go to his cave and examine him just as if he were stuffed, and then you can sit on his back and think how it would be if you should live to be a thousand years old, and he should wake up while you are sitting there. It would be easy to imagine a lot of horrible things he would do to you when <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> open mouth with its awful fangs, his dreadful claws, and his horrible wings all covered with spikes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're wrong," [...] {{said the}} other, excitedly. [...] "It was that big chief there, {{with his head}} in a blanket, that sent those dogs to the right about. Hell! did you see them run <b>at</b> just a <b>look</b> from him? He's a high and mighty feller, <b>you</b> bet. <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> dignity!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I believe I could paint <b>you</b> without <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> you"--and <b>his</b> lighted face shone down on her. [...] "You do {{excuse me}} then from those dreary places?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Jeff Chandler {{looked as}} though he had been dreamed up by one of those artists who specialise in male {{physique}} studies or, a mite further up the artistic scale, he might have been plucked bodily from some modern mural on a biblical subject. For that he had the requisite Jewishness (of which he was very proud) - and he was not quite real. Above all, he was impossibly handsome. He would never have been lost in a crowd, with that big, square, sculpted 20th century face and his prematurely grey wavy hair. If the movies had not found him the advertising agencies would have done - and in fact, whenever you saw a still of him <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> wrist-watch or pipe before realising that he wasn't promoting something. In the coloured stills and on posters his studio always showed his hair as blue, heightening the unreality. His real name was Ira Grossel and his film-name was exactly right.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, Hilda," [...] replied Kenyon, [...] "you do not know, for {{you could}} never learn it from your own heart, which is all purity and rectitude, what a mixture of good there may be in things evil; and how the {{greatest}} criminal, if <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> conduct from his own point of view, or from any side point, may seem not so unquestionably guilty, after all. So with Miriam; so with Donatello. They are, perhaps, partners in what we must call awful guilt; and yet, I will own to you,--when I think of the original cause, the motives, the feelings, the sudden concurrence of circumstances thrusting them onward, {{the urgency of the}} moment, and the sublime unselfishness on either part,--I know not well how to distinguish it from much that the world calls heroism. Might we not render some such verdict as this?--'Worthy of Death, but not unworthy of Love! '" ...|$|E
60|$|I stated to your Lordships on Saturday {{last the}} {{principles}} upon which Mr. Hastings governed his conduct in India, and upon which he grounds his defence. These may all {{be reduced to}} one short word,--arbitrary power. My Lords, if Mr. Hastings had contended, as other men have often done, that the system of government which he patronizes, and on which he acted, was a system tending on the whole to the blessing and benefit of mankind, possibly something might be said for him for setting up so wild, absurd, irrational, and wicked a system,--something might be said to qualify the act from the intention; but it is singular in this man, that, {{at the time he}} tells you he acted on the principles of arbitrary power, he takes care to inform you that he was not blind to the consequences. Mr. Hastings foresaw that the consequences of this system was corruption. An arbitrary system, indeed, must always be a corrupt one. My Lords, there never was a man who thought he had no law but his own will, who did not soon find that he had no end but his own profit. Corruption and arbitrary power are of natural unequivocal generation, necessarily producing one another. Mr. Hastings foresees the abusive and corrupt consequences, and then he justifies his conduct upon the necessities of that system. These are things which are new in the world; for there never was a man, I believe, who contended for arbitrary power, (and there have been persons wicked and foolish enough to contend for it,) that did not pretend, either that the system was good in itself, or that by their conduct they had mitigated or had purified it, and that the poison, by passing through their constitution, had acquired salutary properties. But if <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> defence before the House of Commons, you will see that that very system upon which he governed, and under which he now justifies his actions, did appear to himself a system pregnant with a thousand evils and a thousand mischiefs.|$|E
6000|$|I have {{mentioned}} the cathedral first, but the prime treasure of Milan {{at the present}} hour is the beautiful, tragical Leonardo. The cathedral is good for another thousand years, but we ask whether our children will find in the most majestic and most luckless of frescoes {{much more than the}} shadow of a shadow. Its fame has been for a century or two that, as one may say, of an illustrious invalid whom people visit to see how he lasts, with leave-taking sighs and almost death-bed or tiptoe precautions. The picture needs not another scar or stain, now, to be the saddest work of art in the world; and battered, defaced, ruined as it is, it remains one of the greatest. We may really compare its anguish of decay to the slow conscious ebb of life in a human organism. The production of the prodigy was a breath from the infinite, and the painter's conception not immeasurably less complex than the scheme, say, of his own mortal constitution. There has been much talk lately of the irony of fate, but I suspect fate was never more ironical than when she led the most scientific, the most calculating of all painters to spend fifteen long years in building his goodly house upon the sand. And yet, after all, may not the playing of that trick represent but a deeper wisdom, since if the thing enjoyed the immortal health and bloom of a first-rate Titian we should have lost one of the most pertinent lessons in the history of art? We know it as hearsay, but here is the plain proof, that there is no limit to the amount of [...] "stuff" [...] an artist may put into his work. Every painter ought once in his life to stand before the Cenacolo and decipher its moral. Mix with your colours and mess on your palette every particle of the very substance of your soul, and this lest perchance your [...] "prepared surface" [...] shall play you a trick! Then, and then only, it will fight to the last--it will resist even in death. Raphael was a happier genius; <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> lovely [...] "Marriage of the Virgin" [...] at the Brera, beautiful as some first deep smile of conscious inspiration, but to feel that he foresaw no complaint against fate, and that he knew the world he wanted to know and charmed it into never giving him away. But I have left no space to speak of the Brera, nor of that paradise of book-worms with an eye for their background--if such creatures exist--the Ambrosian Library; nor of that mighty basilica of St. Ambrose, with its spacious atrium and its crudely solemn mosaics, in which it is surely your own fault if you don't forget Dr. Strauss and M. Renan and worship as grimly as a Christian of the ninth century.|$|E
5000|$|On August 20, 1942, Pechersky {{was sent}} to a SS-operated arbeitslager, a work camp, in Minsk. The camp housed 500 Jews from the Minsk Ghetto, as well as Jewish Soviet POWs; there were also between 200-300 Soviet inmates whom the Germans labeled as incorrigible: people who were {{suspected}} of contacting the Soviet partisans and those who were repeatedly truant while working for the Germans. The prisoners were starved and worked from dawn till dusk. Pechersky wrote about the Minsk work camp: The German Nazi camp commandant didn't let a single day pass without killing someone. If <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> face <b>you</b> could tell he was a sadist. He was thin, his upper lip shaking and his left eye bloodshot. He always had a hangover or was drunk and committed unspeakable horrors. He shot people for no reason and his favorite hobby was commanding his dog to attack random people who were ordered not to defend themselves. — Pechersky ...|$|R

6000|$|The {{last act}} was a desperate one; {{you can guess}} it: I pretended [...] to have seen Quinton dead and rushed to his room.

500|$|Producers {{cultivated}} {{an element}} of virtual reality through QuestWorld, a cyberspace simulation rendered with three-dimensional computer animation and motion capture. QuestWorld {{was designed as a}} futuristic application of contemporary technology, similar to the classic series' high-tech lasers, satellites, and robots. Seibert traced its origin to [...] "the same problem that James Bond has... When <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> even <b>his</b> newest gadgets, they're somewhat quaint." [...] H-B marketers polled children on their familiarity with virtual reality, discovering that each child was aware of the concept.

5000|$|The studio {{had a big}} window, {{which you}} passed when walking up {{the front of the}} house to the iron gates at the arched entrance. The window was splashed with paint because Lloyd would stand in front of his wet {{painting}} holding half a gallon of turps in one hand and put his other hand into the turps and throw it over the painting. As it ran down the painting, washing color with it, he would pick up a cloth and wipe back the selected areas.

5000|$|Nine days later, he was {{appointed}} coach of struggling Nakambala Leopards of Mazabuka but he discovered that the club did not match his ambition and he resigned after a year to join Nchanga Rangers on a three-year deal. Rangers chairman Blackwell Siwale said they were excited to have acquired {{the services of a}} top coach like Simukonda.

5000|$|On 22 June 2015, Eustace {{was linked}} with {{a move to}} Scottish giants Rangers, with newly {{appointed}} manager Mark Warburton claiming [...] "People like John Eustace {{are few and far}} between, people like John are ultra-professional on and off the pitch. They are great role models. If <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> record and the win ratio when John's playing, it's really important.

5000|$|In {{explaining}} {{his opposition to}} Samuel Alito, Obama further evaluated the qualities he found important in a Supreme Court justice: I {{have no doubt that}} Judge Alito has the training and qualifications necessary to serve. He's an intelligent man and an accomplished jurist. And there's no indication he's not a man of great character. But when <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> record - {{when it comes to his}} understanding of the Constitution, I have found that in almost every case, he consistently sides on behalf of the powerful against the powerless; on behalf of a strong government or corporation against upholding Americans' individual rights.|$|E

[...] The Telegraph's executive foreign editor Con Coughlin wrote an article saying [...] "Don’t be fooled by all the tributes that are pouring out following the death in Beirut at the weekend of Sheikh Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, the so-called spiritual leader of the radical Shi’ite Muslim militia Hizbollah. The U.S. State Department’s classification of Fadlallah as a terrorist was spot on, and when <b>you</b> <b>look</b> back <b>at</b> <b>his</b> track record you can see he was right up there with other infamous terror masterminds, such as Abu Nidal and Carlos the Jackal." ...|$|R

He isn't fond of the open Green Meadows or of damp places as Danny is, but likes best the edge of the Green Forest and brushy places. He is very much at home in a poorly kept orchard where the weeds are allowed to grow and in young orchards he does a great deal of damage by cutting off the roots of young trees and stripping off the bark as high up as he can reach.
