2500|$|Some {{countries}} in Asia are theoretically {{in danger of}} yellow fever epidemics (mosquitoes with the capability to transmit yellow fever and susceptible monkeys are present), although the disease does not yet occur there. To prevent introduction of the virus, some countries demand previous vaccination of foreign visitors if they have passed through yellow fever areas. Vaccination has to be proven in a vaccination certificate which is valid 10 days after the vaccination and lasts for 10 years. Although the WHO on 17 May 2013 advised that subsequent booster vaccinations are unnecessary, an older (than 10 years) certificate may not be acceptable at all border posts in all affected countries.

Large travel clinics serve an increasing number of customers with specific pre-travel needs including uncommon destinations and preexisting medical conditions. This study aims to identify health characteristics and travel patterns of travelers seeking advice in the largest Swiss travel clinic so that tailored advice can be delivered.; A descriptive analysis was performed on pre-travel visits between July 2010 and August 2012 at the Travel Clinic of the Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Zurich, Switzerland.; A total of 22, 584 travelers sought pre-travel advice. Tourism was the main reason for travel (17, 875, 81. 5 %), followed by visiting friends and relatives (VFRs; 1, 715, 7. 8 %), traveling for business (1, 223, 5. 6 %), and "other reasons" (ie, volunteer work, pilgrimage, study abroad, and emigration; 1, 112, 5. 1 %). The main travel destination was Thailand. In the VFR group, the highest proportions of traveling children (258, 15. 1 %) and of pregnant or breastfeeding women (23, 3. 9 %) were observed.

5000|$|On 28 March, ProMED-mail moderators Jack Woodall and Tom Yuill {{issued a}} {{strongly}} worded warning on {{the threat of}} <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> for countries that have endemic dengue fever (and thus the mosquito vector of <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> and dengue fever, Aedes aegypti), and particularly for countries in Asia, where until recently <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> has never appeared. Urban populations and mosquito-infested slums in Asia and Africa are much larger than in the past. A commentary and accompanying article published in May stressed the potential for spread to Asia by international air travel. Other {{parts of the world}} where <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> is present but usually in the quiescent jungle cycle, and where there is regular air travel, such as Brazil, may also be vulnerable. They stressed that world stocks of 7 million doses of vaccine have been exhausted in the vaccination campaign against the outbreak in Angola. If <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> spread to the 18 countries in Asia where the mosquito vector is present, more than 2 billion people would be at risk. They stated: [...] "Apocalyptic forecasts of the numbers of fatalities from Ebola turned out to be wildly wrong, and we can hope that will again be the case here, but given the way Zika has exploded in the Western hemisphere, we can't count on it." [...] CDC said they could not assist as much in the outbreak because all its experts were involved in efforts against the Zika virus outbreak in the Americas.

Because the cases were unusual and adverse events following YF vaccination {{had not been}} studied, we estimated age-related reporting rates for systemic illness following YF vaccination. We found {{that the rate of}} reported adverse events among elderly vaccinees was higher than among vaccinees 25 to 44 years of age. We also found two additional deaths among elderly YF vaccinees. These data signal a potential problem but are not sufficient to reliably estimate incidence rates or to understand potential underlying mechanisms; therefore, enhanced surveillance is needed. YF remains an important cause of severe illness and death, and travel to disease-endemic regions is increasing.

40|$|Analysis of {{the records}} of {{instances}} in which non-immune persons contracted <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> notwithstanding <b>vaccination</b> shows that the onset of disease occurs soon after vaccination, the longest period being 13 days. Since the average incubation period in <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> is 6 days, it seems that infection must {{have taken place in}} some instances during the period while protection was developing. These instances led to a study of the possibility of immediate protection by means of the anti-icteroides serum. It had already been shown that the immune serum protects at once against experimental Leptospira icteroides infection, but it remained to determine how long the protection would last. Guinea pigs were given different quantities of the immune serum and subsequently injected, at various intervals, with a virulent strain of Leptospira icteroides. Complete protection enduring 5 days was obtained with as minute a quantity of serum as 0. 002 cc. per 1, 000 gm. of body weight. After 5 days, however, the immune substance rapidly diminished, and to keep the animal protected for as long as 10 days it was necessary to give 100 times as much, or 0. 2 cc. For a man weighing 80 kilos, 0. 16 cc. (0. 002 x 80) would theoretically be sufficient to protect for at least 5 days, 1. 6 cc. for 7 days, and 16 cc. for 10 days. This temporary protection may be a valuable antecedent to that furnished by vaccination, since the final effect of the latter cannot be expected until at least 9 to 10 days have passed...|$|R
5000|$|The {{outbreak}} of <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> in Angola in January 2016 has {{raised concerns about}} whether the global supply of vaccine is adequate to meet the need during a large epidemic or pandemic of the disease. Routine childhood immunization has been suspended in other African countries to ensure an adequate supply in the vaccination campaign against the outbreak in Angola. Emergency stockpiles of vaccine diverted to Angola, which consisted of about 10 million doses {{at the end of}} March 2016, had become exhausted, but were being replenished by May 2016. [...] However, in August it was reported that about 1 million doses of 6 million shipped in February had been sent to the wrong place or not kept cold enough to ensure efficacy, resulting in shortages to fight the spreading epidemic in DR Congo. As an emergency measure, experts have suggested using a fractional dose (1/5 or 1/10 of the usual dose) to extend existing supplies of vaccine. Others have noted that switching manufacturing processes to modern cell-culture technology might improve vaccine supply shortfalls. Manufacture of the current vaccine is slow and laborious. A new vaccine under investigation is made by a different means. On June 17, the WHO agreed to the use of 1/5 the usual dose as an emergency measure during the ongoing outbreak in Angola and the DR Congo. The fractional dose would not qualify for a <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> certificate of <b>vaccination</b> for travelers.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background In November 2009, Sierra Leone {{conducted}} a preventive <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> (YF) <b>vaccination</b> campaign targeting individuals aged nine months and older in six health districts. The campaign was integrated with a measles follow-up campaign {{throughout the country}} targeting children aged 9 – 59 months. For both campaigns, the operational objective was to reach 95 % of the target population. During the campaign, we used clustered lot quality assurance sampling (C-LQAS) to identify areas of low coverage to recommend timely mop-up actions. Methods We divided the country in 20 non-overlapping lots. Twelve lots were targeted by both vaccinations, while eight only by measles. In each lot, five clusters of ten eligible individuals were selected for each vaccine. The upper threshold (UT) was set at 90 % and the lower threshold (LT) at 75 %. A lot was rejected for low vaccination coverage if more than 7 unvaccinated individuals (not presenting vaccination card) were found. After the campaign, we plotted the C-LQAS results against the post-campaign coverage estimations to assess if early interventions were successful enough to increase coverage in the lots that were {{at the level of}} rejection {{before the end of the}} campaign. Results During the last two days of campaign, based on card-confirmed vaccination status, five lots out of 20 (25. 0 %) failed for having low measles vaccination coverage and three lots out of 12 (25. 0 %) for low YF coverage. In one district, estimated post-campaign vaccination coverage for both vaccines was still not significantly above the minimum acceptable level (LT[*]=[*] 75 %) even after vaccination mop-up activities. Conclusion C-LQAS during the vaccination campaign was informative to identify areas requiring mop-up activities to reach the coverage target prior to leaving the region. The only district where mop-up activities seemed to be unsuccessful might have had logistical difficulties that should be further investigated and resolved. </p...|$|R
