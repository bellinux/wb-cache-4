Daniel Ricciardo issued apologies to the Australian fans after what he felt was a [...] "boring" [...] race. Red Bull quarreled with their engine manufacturer Renault and lamented the dominance of their rivals, calling for the FIA {{to step in and}} apply rule changes to level the field, fearing that the public would lose interest in the sport if nothing happened. Mercedes chief Toto Wolff reacted furiously, telling his rivals to [...] "get your fucking head down and work to sort it out", but later {{made it clear that he}} [...] "didn't mean the f-word in relation to him" [...] regarding the comments by Christian Horner. Nico Rosberg voiced hopes that their rivals would get closer over the course of the season, saying during the post-race press conference: [...] "I hope we can have a good fight.

Rolling Stone magazine praised it as [...] "the best performance of the entire show", while The New York Times editor Katie Rogers highlighted Timberlake's crossover appeal. Entertainment Weekly declared it as one of the best performances of 2015 and wrote, [...] "In an unapologetic display of talent, Nashville met Motown during country music’s biggest night for a hands-in-the-air, take-us-to-church mash-up that was everything <b>you</b> <b>hope</b> for from an all-star duet." ...|$|E

500|$|The film's ending {{was changed}} shortly before its {{theatrical}} release. Originally, Burrows's character would escape the shark infested water and live. However, the test audience, {{who saw the}} film {{less than a month}} before its release, disapproved of the ending because she was behind the shark experiments and was seen as the film's villain. As a result, the production team did a one-day reshoot in the Universal Studios tank and did some computer generated work on the sharks to change it. In 2009, Harlin explained that Deep Blue Sea was the hardest film he had ever made because most of the shooting days involved the team standing in water or being under water for long periods. According to him, [...] "Just the practicality of putting a wet suit on in the morning, being in the water all day. Your script, all your paperwork has to be made of plastic paper.

Claudia Puig of USA Today stated of the film, [...] "Jennifer's Body is not as hot as <b>you</b> <b>hope</b> it would be". Where others praised the film's dialogue, MSNBC's Alonso Duralde called the writing lazy and [...] "orse still, all of Cody's trademark pop-culture–infused dialogue stands out as artificial and precious". Jennifer's Body, he said, wants [...] "so badly" [...] to be a Heathers-esque dark comedy, [...] "but its shortcomings makes you appreciate why that earlier film was so great". Ty Burr of The Boston Globe also said the film wants to be like Heathers, and reminded him [...] "a lot" [...] of Heathers but the only scene in the film that [...] "actually feels dangerous" [...] is when the possessed Jennifer initiates a long and passionate kiss with Needy, which the film [...] "very, very nervously backs away from" [...] and that [...] "Jennifer's Body falls into the dispiriting category of dumb movies made by smart people, in this case a glibly clever writer and a talented director who think a few wisecracks are enough to subvert the teen horror genre".|$|E

[...] Bruce's relationship with Andrea, which at first shows promise, eventually turns into turmoil. At first, Bruce and Andrea are set for marriage, but then Bruce is given a farewell note from Andrea cutting off their relationship. This eventually leads into Bruce's decision to become Batman. Richard Corliss of Time felt this scene paralleled Andrea's decision to avenge her own parents and reject love, when she finds her own father murdered. Both events transform the two people (Bruce becomes Batman, Andrea becomes the Phantasm). One scene depicts Bruce Wayne at his parents' tombstone saying [...] "I didn't count on being happy." [...] According to Reaves, this scene {{was to be a}} pivotal moment in Bruce's tragic life, as he denies himself the opportunity to live a normal life. Reaves also stated: [...] "When Bruce puts on the mask for the first time, , and Alfred says 'My God!' he's reacting in horror, because he's watching this man he's helped raise from childhood, this man who has let the desire for vengeance and retribution consume his life, at last embrace the unspeakable." ...|$|E

Robert Aramayo (young Eddard Stark) spoke about the filming of the scene in an interview following the airing of the episode and stated, [...] "We all went through a bunch of training, which continued through our three- or four-day shoot in Spain.

Likewise, in a fight, if you're going to chop somebody's arm off or stab them in the gut — the intention is to chop that arm off or stab someone in the gut, and you have to play that intention fully.

At least 18,000 people attended the unveiling ceremony (although one estimate claims that approximately 250,000 people attended) including Shirley Chisholm, the first African-American woman elected to Congress.

[...] However, [...] a season-long American Idol-like talent-search show with a sole focus on dance had never been broadcast on American network television. [...] Producers and judges associated with the show have stated on numerous occasions, both {{within the context of the}} show and in interviews, that the series was meant to rejuvenate the visibility and appreciation of dance as an art form in the U.S. and to give exposure to struggling dancers. [...] Series judge Mary Murphy says, for example, [...] "Of course <b>you</b> <b>hope</b> you can make a living at it, because you don't want to give up on something that you do, but the honest truth is most dancers have to carry one or two jobs and dance as much as they can on the side -- it's a very lucky dancer who gets a full scholarship."

[...] Casting directors suggested Evans to Bong, who initially had misconceptions of Evans before they met due to the [...] "caricature of the American all muscle", but quickly departed from that notion and described Evans as [...] " [...] he's actually very sensitive and has a quiet and introverted side.

2500|$|A {{key play}} {{occurred}} in the following Game 5 which changed {{the outcome of the}} series. With 2.1 seconds left in the fourth quarter, the Knicks' Hubert Davis attempted a 23-foot shot which was defended by Pippen, who was called for a personal foul by referee Hue Hollins, who determined that Pippen made contact with Davis. Television replays indicated that contact was made after Davis had released the ball. Davis successfully made both free throw attempts to assist in the Knicks victory, 87–86, and gave the Knicks a three games to two advantage in the series. the resulting incident was described as the most controversial moment of Hollins' career by Referee magazine. Hollins defended the call after the game saying, [...] "I saw Scottie make contact with his shooting motion. I'm positive there was contact on the shot." [...] Darell Garretson, the league's supervisor of officials and who also officiated in the league, agreed with Hollins and issued a statement, [...] "The perception is that referees should put their whistles in their pockets in the last minutes. But {{it all comes down to}} what is sufficient contact. There's an old, old adage that refs don't make those calls in the last seconds. Obviously, <b>you</b> <b>hope</b> you don't make a call that will decide a game. But the call was within the context of how we had been calling them all game." [...] Garretson later changed his stance of the call the next season. Speaking to a Chicago Tribune reporter, Garretson described Hollins' call as [...] "terrible".
