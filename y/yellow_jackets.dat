Georgia Tech head coach Paul Johnson, entering his second season {{as head of the}} <b>Yellow</b> <b>Jackets,</b> had high hopes that Georgia Tech would be able to improve upon its 2008 performance. Others agreed with Johnson's assumption, as the <b>Yellow</b> <b>Jackets</b> were ranked No. 15 in the preseason Associated Press and USA Today coaches' polls.|$|E
5|$|Georgia Tech {{had another}} {{significant}} {{win over the}} Clemson Tigers on October 29, 2011 at Bobby Dodd Stadium. Clemson was ranked nationally No. 5 at the time, and the Tigers suffered their first defeat of the season {{at the hands of}} the <b>Yellow</b> <b>Jackets.</b> Tevin Washington led the <b>Yellow</b> <b>Jackets</b> to a 31–17 upset victory by rushing for 176 yards on 27 carries and a touchdown, which was the most rushing yards ever by a Georgia Tech quarterback. In addition, Clemson's offense was almost completely shutdown by Georgia Tech's defense in the first half, and the Tigers were plagued by turnovers, which contributed to the win for the <b>Yellow</b> <b>Jackets.</b>|$|E

5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1934, Brimsek was invited to the Detroit Red Wings {{training}} camp for a shot at playing in the National Hockey League (NHL). Jack Adams, the Red Wings' coach and manager, made a bad impression on Brimsek. He felt that Adams {{had a habit of}} favoritism. This led him to try out for another professional team, the Baltimore Orioles of the Eastern Amateur Hockey League (EAHL). Unfortunately for Brimsek, the Orioles decided to cut him. Disappointed, Brimsek hitchhiked back to Eveleth. On his way back home, he had a chance meeting with the owner of the Pittsburgh <b>Yellow</b> <b>Jackets,</b> John H. Harris. The <b>Yellow</b> <b>Jackets</b> were in need for a goaltender and Harris proceeded to sign Brimsek to the team. Brimsek started for the <b>Yellow</b> <b>Jackets</b> {{for the first time in}} 1934–35 by playing 16 games exhibition games. Out of those 16 games, he won 14 of them.|$|E

The Bergers honored his request, so that Little <b>Yellow</b> <b>Jacket</b> could live at Teague Bucking Bulls in North Carolina instead of North Dakota and enjoy milder winters. Joe Berger's son Chad was managing the bulls by this time. Little <b>Yellow</b> <b>Jacket</b> spent his last five years at Teague's ranch.

5|$|Because Clemson {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, Georgia Tech {{received the}} ball to begin the second half. Chris Tanner returned the kickoff to the Tech 29-yard line, and the <b>Yellow</b> <b>Jackets</b> began the first offensive drive of the half. Jones opened the drive with a 16-yard run, then the <b>Yellow</b> <b>Jackets</b> converted a fourth down to continue down the field. Six plays after the fourth-down conversion, Tech quarterback Nesbitt ran {{into the end zone}} for a touchdown. The following extra point gave Tech a 23–13 lead with 9:12 remaining.|$|E
5|$|Clemson's post-score kickoff was {{returned}} to the Georgia Tech 15-yard line, where the <b>Yellow</b> <b>Jackets</b> began their first offensive possession. On the first two plays of the game, Georgia Tech running back Roddy Jones escaped the Clemson defense for gains of 21 yards and 22 yards, respectively. Those plays advanced the <b>Yellow</b> <b>Jackets</b> to the Clemson 42-yard line, where Georgia Tech began advancing by small gains. In three plays, Georgia Tech gained a first down, but two subsequent plays lost yardage before kicker Scott Blair came onto the field to attempt—and convert—a 48-yard field goal. The score narrowed Clemson's lead to 7–3 with the quarter exactly half elapsed.|$|E
5|$|Gailey's most {{successful}} year at Georgia Tech was in 2006 with nine victories and the ACC Coastal Division championship.

Tashard Choice led the ACC in rushing yards and Calvin Johnson led the ACC in receptions and receiving yardage. After an impressive 33-3 victory at Notre Dame to open the 2007 season, the team slid to finish 7-6. On the morning of Monday, November 26, 2007, Gailey was fired from the <b>Yellow</b> <b>Jackets,</b> two days after another heartbreaking loss to the University of Georgia.|$|E

50|$|Little <b>Yellow</b> <b>Jacket's</b> owners, a {{partnership}} of Joe and Nevada Berger, Bernie Taupin, and Tom Teague, retired {{him at the}} end of 2005. Little <b>Yellow</b> <b>Jacket</b> was kept in a pen when the truck/trailer would pull up to take the other bulls away for the bull riding events. He would throw a fit because he wanted to go with them. Other times he spent in the pasture so he had exercise, company, and breeding with the cows. Berger also sold his sperm for artificial insemination at $700 per straw. Little <b>Yellow</b> <b>Jacket</b> would wake up mornings in his pen and command the other bulls to come join him for a drink of water. He was definitely the dominant bull at the ranch. Occasionally, adult visitors were guided to the ranch to view Little <b>Yellow</b> <b>Jacket.</b>|$|R
5|$|With an 80 {{record and}} a No. 5 {{national}} ranking, Clemson hosted Georgia Tech. In the game, the <b>Yellow</b> <b>Jackets</b> posted a school-record offensive effort in an upset victory over the Tigers. Clemson took a 2824 lead with 1:52 remaining in the game, but the <b>Yellow</b> <b>Jackets</b> drove 80 yards in 11 plays before ending with a one-handed catch for a touchdown, giving Clemson its first loss of the season. The defeat eliminated the Tigers from national championship contention, but they still {{had a chance to}} win the conference championship if they defeated Florida State the following week.|$|E
5|$|Clemson fielded the {{following}} kickoff, and its offense continued {{with the success}} it found in its final drive of the first half. As in that drive, C. J. Spiller was a key performer. Clemson's drive began at its 40-yard line, and it took just five plays for the Tigers to score a touchdown. Four of those plays, including the culminating one, came from Spiller, who covered 40 yards during them. Spiller's touchdown cut Georgia Tech's lead to 23–20. But as quickly as Clemson scored, Georgia Tech moved even more quickly. From its 30-yard line, the <b>Yellow</b> <b>Jackets</b> needed only three plays, the keystone coming on a 70-yard throw from Nesbitt to Thomas for a touchdown. With 5:10 remaining in the quarter, the <b>Yellow</b> <b>Jackets</b> restored the 10-point margin, 30–20.|$|E
5|$|Clemson's post-touchdown kickoff was {{returned}} to the Tech 14-yard line, where the <b>Yellow</b> <b>Jackets</b> began their game-winning drive. The offense began slowly; Georgia Tech gained only nine yards in three plays, setting up a crucial fourth-down conversion. A failed try would give Clemson the ball deep in Georgia Tech territory, with little time remaining in the game for Georgia Tech to reply to any score. Instead, the <b>Yellow</b> <b>Jackets</b> converted the fourth down, keeping their drive alive. On the first play after the fourth-down conversion, Nesbitt completed a 21-yard pass to Dwyer, pushing Tech to near midfield. Eight plays later, Dwyer breached the Clemson defense for a 15-yard gain and the go-ahead score. A false start penalty on Georgia Tech's two-point conversion try prevented any extra points, but the touchdown's six points were enough to give Georgia Tech a 39–34 lead.|$|E
50|$|Little <b>Yellow</b> <b>Jacket's</b> most {{significant}} riders, Chris Shivers, Michael Gaffney, and Ty Murray, who all had high {{praise for the}} bull were all later awarded the prestigious award in bullriding, the Professional Bull Riders: Heroes and Legends Ring of Honor.

5|$|Several {{weeks after}} Johnson's defeat of rival Georgia, Georgia Tech rewarded Johnson {{with a new}} {{contract}} worth $17.7 million, a 53% raise that made him the second highest paid coach in the ACC before he had even completed {{his first year in}} the conference. In 2009, Johnson led the <b>Yellow</b> <b>Jackets</b> to their first win over Florida State in Tallahassee in school history, a 49-44 shootout that featured over 1000 total yards between the two teams. One week later, Johnson defeated No. 4 Virginia Tech 28-23 at Bobby Dodd Stadium. The win broke an 0–17 losing streak to top five opponents at Grant Field in the past 47 years. On October 24, 2009, Johnson led the <b>Yellow</b> <b>Jackets</b> to their first win against the Virginia Cavaliers in Charlottesville, Virginia since 1990. At Duke University Johnson and his team clinched the ACC Coastal Division {{for the first time since}} 2006. Still, Johnson and company could not win their second game in a row over hated Georgia as the Bulldogs upset Tech 30–24 in the final home game of the season in 2009. On December 5 the Jackets defeated the Clemson Tigers to make them ACC champions, a title that would be vacated on July 14, 2011 due to NCAA infractions. The <b>Yellow</b> <b>Jackets</b> went on to lose to Iowa in the Orange Bowl, 24-14.|$|E
5|$|The Tigers {{began their}} second drive {{of the game}} from their 26-yard line and {{advanced}} the ball through short gains. The Tigers needed three plays to gain a first down, then running back Andre Ellington advanced 18 yards and into Georgia Tech territory. Clemson could not gain another first down, and kicker Richard Jackson missed a 52-yard field goal attempt. After the miss, Georgia Tech's offense resumed the field. From the Tech 35-yard line, the <b>Yellow</b> <b>Jackets</b> advanced to the Clemson 48-yard line before running back Jonathan Dwyer gained 20 yards to the 28-yard line. Two plays later, as the <b>Yellow</b> <b>Jackets</b> advanced to the 18-yard line, the quarter ended with Clemson leading, 7–3.|$|E

5|$|This rivalry {{lost some}} luster when the Georgia Tech Athletics {{discarded}} its {{membership in the}} Southeastern Conference in 1963 to become an independent institute. However, the <b>Yellow</b> <b>Jackets</b> continued their annual series of football games with the Auburn Tigers through 1987, and with the University of Georgia though the present day. Georgia Tech and Auburn play football games in occasional years, and games in other sports regularly. Even though the <b>Yellow</b> <b>Jackets</b> have joined the Atlantic Coast Conference for all sports in recent decades, from a historical perspective, the Auburn Tigers are Georgia Tech's second-highest sports rivalry, behind only the Georgia Bulldogs. Georgia Tech trails Auburn in the all-time series 41-47-4, but beat Auburn at Tech's Bobby Dodd Stadium in 2003 and in Auburn to open the 2005 season.|$|E
5|$|With a solid {{lead and}} time running {{down in the}} game, Georgia Tech began a {{sequence}} of running plays intended to keep the game clock running while gaining ground. From their 25-yard line, the <b>Yellow</b> <b>Jackets</b> gained 38 yards on seven plays, advancing into Clemson territory in the process. Facing fourth down at the Clemson 37-yard line, the <b>Yellow</b> <b>Jackets</b> attempted to gain a first down rather than kick a long field goal. When they were stopped short of the first-down line, Clemson's offense returned to the field. Spiller again drove the Tigers down the field, opening the drive with a 54-yard run on its first play. Three plays later, Ellington capitalized the drive with a one-yard run for a tying touchdown. The following extra point gave Clemson a one-point lead, 34–33, with 6:11 remaining in the game.|$|E
