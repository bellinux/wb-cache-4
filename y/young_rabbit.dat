40|$|International audienceRabbit Haemorrhagic Disease (RHD) {{is caused}} by a {{calicivirus}} (RHDV) that kills 90 % of infected adult European rabbits within 3 days. Remarkably, <b>young</b> <b>rabbits</b> are resistant to RHD. We induced immunosuppression in <b>young</b> <b>rabbits</b> by treatment with methylprednisolone acetate (MPA) and challenged the animals with RHDV by intramuscular injection. All of these <b>young</b> <b>rabbits</b> died within 3 days of infection due to fulminant hepatitis, presenting a large number of RHDV-positive dead or apoptotic hepatocytes, and a significant seric increase in cytokines, features that {{are similar to those of}} naïve adult rabbits infected by RHDV.

40|$|Foi conduzido um experimento com o objetivo de estudar as influências do padrão alimentar de coelhos durante a fase de lactação, em função do nível de amido nas dietas e da disponibilidade de leite modulada pelo tamanho da ninhada, sobre o desempenho de láparos até a desmama (35 dias). Cem ninhadas foram mantidas com oito láparos ao nascer até o 16 º dia de vida. A partir do 16 º dia de idade até a desmama, 60 ninhadas foram reduzidas para quatro láparos, enquanto as demais foram mantidas com oito, recebendo dietas contendo nível alto (24 %) ou normal (15 %) de amido. As ninhadas com quatro láparos apresentaram maior ganho de peso diário, independentemente dos intervalos analisados, sendo desmamados com maior peso em relação aos mantidos em ninhadas mais numerosas. Este efeito também foi observado naqueles que receberam dietas com alto teor de amido somente a partir do 24 º dia de lactação. Os láparos mantidos em ninhadas mais numerosas apresentaram maior consumo diário de ração até 26 º dia de idade. À medida que os láparos mantidos em ninhadas menores apresentaram superioridade no crescimento e a disponibilidade de leite pela coelha foi diminuída pela proximidade do final da lactação, o consumo de ração na fase final de lactação passou a ser maior para os láparos mantidos em ninhadas menores. Por outro lado, a dieta mais rica em amido proporcionou maior consumo diário, independentemente do intervalo analisado. O consumo {{individual}} de leite foi maior para láparos mantidos em ninhadas menores, não havendo diferença em relação aos níveis de amido nas dietas disponibilizadas aos animais. The {{experiment was}} carried out to study the influences of the feeding pattern of rabbits during the lactation phase according function of the starch level in the diets and availability of milk modulated by litter size on performance <b>young</b> <b>rabbits</b> before weaning (35 days). One hundred litters were maintained to eight rabbits at birth until the 16 day old. From 16 to 35 days old, 60 litter were reduced for four <b>young</b> <b>rabbits,</b> while the others were maintained with eight <b>young</b> <b>rabbits,</b> feeding with high (24 %) or normal (15 %) starch level. The litters with four <b>young</b> <b>rabbits</b> presented higher daily weight gain, independently of the analyzed intervals, and were weaned with higher weight than <b>young</b> <b>rabbits</b> maintained in more numerous litters. This effect was also observed only for <b>young</b> <b>rabbits</b> feeding diets with high starch level, from 24 days to weaning. The <b>young</b> <b>rabbits</b> maintained in more numerous litters presented the higher daily consumption of ration until 26 days of age. As <b>young</b> <b>rabbits</b> maintained in smaller litter presented superiority in the growth {{and the availability of}} milk for the does was decreased by the proximity of the end lactation, the feed intake in the final phase of lactation became the higher for the <b>young</b> <b>rabbits</b> maintained in smaller litters. The diet with high level starch showed higher feed intake, independently of the analyzed interval. The individual milk intake was the higher for <b>young</b> <b>rabbits</b> maintained in smaller litters, but no difference was observed in relation to the starch levels in diets...|$|R

According to Norma Crandall, her [...] "warm, human aspect" [...] was [...] "usually revealed only in {{her love of}} nature and of animals". In a similar description, Literary news (1883) states: [...] " [...] loved the solemn moors, she loved all wild, free creatures and things", and critics attest that her love of the moors is manifest in Wuthering Heights.

40|$|There is {{a dearth}} of {{relevant}} information in general about certain production parameters of domestic rabbits in general in eastern Nigeria. Thus some basic hematological parameters of young and adult out bred domestic rabbits, from villages in eastern Nigeria, were determined using standard methods in hematology. Individual values of Hb and PCV were very variable. The Hb values were 6. 50 - 17. 80 g% (mean 11. 20 ± 1. 59 g%) in <b>young</b> <b>rabbits</b> and 9. 50 - 16. 20 g% (mean 11. 50 ± 1. 61 g%) in adult rabbits.

The difference between PCV values in <b>young</b> and adult <b>rabbits</b> was not significant. The total WBC counts were 3371 - 19400 c/μl (mean 8512. 4 ± 3914. 87 c/μl) in <b>young</b> <b>rabbits</b> and 4320 - 20200 c/μl (mean 7914 ± 3090 c/μl) in adults.

40|$|The {{reactions}} of the previously described neuro-epithelial bodies (NEB) (Lauweryns et al., 1969, 1970, 1972 a, b, 1973 a, b, c 1974, 1975) in <b>young</b> <b>rabbits</b> to: (1) hypoxia with normoxaemia in the arteria pulmonalis on the one hand, and (2) hypoxaemia in the arteria pulmonalis with normoxic aeration on the other hand, has been investigated by means of cross-circulation experiments and light microscopical, electron microscopical and morphometrical techniques. Hypoxically aerated <b>young</b> <b>rabbits,</b> which received normoxaemic blood in their arteria pulmonalis from a donor rabbit {{by means of an}} arterio-arterial cross-circulation with mutal exchange transfusion, revealed an increased exocytosis of the dense-core vesicles of their NEB. Normoxically aerated <b>young</b> <b>rabbits</b> which received hypoxaemic blood in an identical manner, did not exhibit an increased exocytosis. It is concluded that the NEB apparently react directly to the hypoxia of the inhaled air and not to the hypoxaemia of the pulmonary blood. By the release of serotonin and a polypeptide substance, they may produce a local vasoconstriction in hypoxically aerated lung areas, enabling an intrapulmonary regulation of the V/Q ratio. This is regarded as additional proof that the NEB [...] while being modulated by the CNS [...] probably are intrapulmonary chemoreceptors with local secretory activities, reacting to the composition of the inhaled air. status: publishe...|$|R
