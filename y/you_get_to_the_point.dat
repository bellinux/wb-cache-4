5000|$|After {{three years}} living in Uruguay, Barrott sold his minimoog {{and the couple}} moved to Ibiza in October 2012, given that [...] "We wanted to live as best we could without possessions" [...] {{and he wanted to}} live closer to his parents in England who were {{becoming}} very old. He began making balearic downtempo recordings when he moved to Ibiza. He reasoned that [...] "Anything over 110bpm sounds like gabba to me so, over the years, I guess I naturally gravitated to slow music and Balearic, cos it means I can do anything I want as a musician and a label owner.” His first studio album to be released under the Mark Barrott moniker, Sketches from an Island, is based on the quiet nature of Ibiza, using Leonardo da Vinci's technique of [...] "Sophistication through simplicity" [...] to represent this concept. In 2014, he stated that he was unwilling to release music from other artists on his label, and preferred to make his own content for the imprint at the moment: [...] "when you're releasing other people's music and they deliver it late or they don't like the artwork, and they have expectations because the last track sold 2,000… <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> where you'd just rather be responsible for yourself." ...|$|E
5000|$|Cole made a {{conscious}} decision to change and evolve his lyrical style from that which he used in the Commotions. A new approach saw him less afraid to attempt more obvious themes and simpler narratives, <b>You</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point,</b> in writing, where the obvious is the best thing to do. I shied away from that for a long time. I {{think you have to be}} a better writer to use the obvious, and still make it sound fresh.The album opens with the track 'Don't Look Back', which is about how people become more attracted to faith the older they become and the closer to death they get. The song's protagonist is based on character traits Cole feared he could attain. 'No Blue Skies' was the first song released, It is a simple song; boy leaves girl or girl leaves boy, bitterness. That's what I like about it, it's so simple said Cole. The song was the last to be written and recorded for the album after Cole was told the album needed a lead single. After writing most of what would become 'No Blue Skies', he was so pleased with it that he arranged for the song to be recorded immediately. Still in the process of writing the lyrics and structuring the song, in the studio he performed a rough vocal track to guide the other musicians. This would be the only vocal track recorded, after he was reluctantly convinced by the other musicians that it could not be bettered. 'A Long Way Down' is based on the themes of excess and materialism but also serves as a song about a comedown. It was written for an unreleased film about a Glaswegian artist who becomes entangled in the New York high life, losing his values and sense of perspective in the process. [...] The song 'Undressed' has a double meaning, Cole explained: Half the song is about nakedness, and the other half about emotional nakedness and, vulnerability. That's why it opens with the line, 'You look so good when you're depressed', because women do. It's really unfair! ...|$|E
