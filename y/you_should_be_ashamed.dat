6000|$|... "It {{has been}} said that a good {{critique}} on a poem may be written by one who is no poet himself. This, according to your idea and mine of poetry, I feel to be false-the less poetical the critic, the less just the critique, and the converse. On this account, and because there are but few B-'s in the world, I would <b>be</b> as much <b>ashamed</b> of the world's good opinion as proud of your own. Another than yourself might here observe, 'Shakespeare is in possession of the world's good opinion, and yet Shakespeare is the greatest of poets. It appears then that the world judge correctly, why <b>should</b> <b>you</b> <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> of their favorable judgment?' The difficulty lies in the interpretation of the word 'judgment' or 'opinion.' The opinion is the world's, truly, but it may be called theirs as a man would call a book his, having bought it; he did not write the book, but it is his; they did not originate the opinion, but it is theirs. A fool, for example, thinks Shakespeare a great poet-yet the fool has never read Shakespeare. But the fool's neighbor, who is a step higher on the Andes of the mind, whose head (that is to say, his more exalted thought) is too far above the fool to be seen or understood, but whose feet (by which I mean his everyday actions) are sufficiently near to be discerned, and by means of which that superiority is ascertained, which but for them would never have been discovered-this neighbor asserts that Shakespeare is a great poet--the fool believes him, and it is henceforward his opinion. This neighbor's own opinion has, in like manner, been adopted from one above him, and so, ascendingly, to a few gifted individuals who kneel around the summit, beholding, face to face, the master spirit who stands upon the pinnacle.|$|R
6000|$|Nay, {{you might}} answer, {{speaking}} for them--'We {{do not let}} these wars come to pass for our play, nor by our carelessness; we cannot help them. How can any final quarrel of nations be settled otherwise than by war?' I cannot now delay, {{to tell you how}} political quarrels might be otherwise settled. But grant that they cannot. Grant that no law of reason can be understood by nations; no law of justice submitted to by them: and that, while questions of a few acres, and of petty cash, can be determined by truth and equity, the questions which are to issue in the perishing or saving of kingdoms can be determined only by the truth of the sword, and the equity of the rifle. Grant this, and even then, judge if it will always be necessary for you to put your quarrel into the hearts of your poor, and sign your treaties with peasants' blood. You would <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> to do this in your own private position and power. Why <b>should</b> <b>you</b> not <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> also to do it in public place and power? If you quarrel with your neighbour, and the quarrel be indeterminable by law, and mortal, you and he do not send your footmen to Battersea fields to fight it out; nor do you set fire to his tenants' cottages, nor spoil their goods. You fight out your quarrel yourselves, and at your own danger, if at all. And you do not think it materially affects the arbitrement that one of you has a larger household than the other; so that, if the servants or tenants were brought into the field with their masters, the issue of the contest could not be doubtful? You either refuse the private duel, or you practise it under laws of honour, not of physical force; that so it may be, in a manner, justly concluded. Now the just or unjust conclusion of the private feud is of little moment, while the just or unjust conclusion of the public feud is of eternal moment: and yet, in this public quarrel, you take your servants' sons from their arms to fight for it, and your servants' food from their lips to support it; and the black seals on the parchment of your treaties of peace are the deserted hearth and the fruitless field. There is a ghastly ludicrousness in this, as there is mostly in these wide and universal crimes.

Not your companions, the other boys, but Mrs. Parsons again, whom I found you embracing in that foolish fashion, yes, and mingling your tears with hers, of which at your age <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>ashamed.</b> Indeed I believe that you feel being separated from that garrulous person, who is but a servant, more than you do from me, your father." ...|$|E

'Nay! now that's a foul slander, and <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> {{of doing}} my father such wrong,' said Philip, 'Listen;' and he read: 'I will believe no ill of the lad {{no more than}} of thee, Phil. It is but a wild-goose chase, and the poor young woman is scarce like to be above ground; but, as I daily tell them, 'tis hard a man should forfeit his land for seeking his wife. My Lord North sends rumours that he is under Papist guiding, and sworn brother with the Black Ribaumonts; and my Lady, his grandmother, is like to break her heart, and my Lord credits them more than he ought, and never a line as a token comes from you. Then there's Dame Annora, as proud of the babe as though neither she nor woman born ever had a son before, and plains over him, that both his {{brothers}} should be endowed, and he but a younger son. What will be the end on't I cannot tell. I will {{stand up for the}} right as best man may do, and never forget that Berry is her first-born, and that his child may be living; but the matter is none of mine, and my Lord is very aged, nor can a man meddle between his wife and her father. So this I tell you that you may make your brother lay it to heart. The sooner he is here the better, if he be still, as I verily believe and maintain him to be, an honest English heart that snaps his fingers at French papistry.' 'There,' conclude Philip triumphantly, 'he knows an honest man! He's friend and good father to you as much as ever. Heed none of the rest. He'll never let this little rogue stand in your light.' ...|$|E
5000|$|He {{was elected}} on 1 August 1559 but, given the {{turbulence}} and executions that had preceded Elizabeth's accession, {{it was difficult}} to find the requisite four bishops willing and qualified to consecrate Parker, and not until 19 December was that ceremony performed at Lambeth by William Barlow, formerly Bishop of Bath and Wells, John Scory, formerly Bishop of Chichester, Miles Coverdale, formerly Bishop of Exeter, and John Hodgkins, Bishop of Bedford. The allegation of an indecent consecration in the Nag's Head Fable seems first to have been made by the Jesuit Christopher Holywood in 1604, and has since been discredited. Parker's consecration was, however, legally valid only by the plenitude of the royal supremacy; the Edwardine Ordinal, which was used, had been repealed by Mary Tudor and not re-enacted by the parliament of 1559. Although the Papal Commission which pronounced Anglican Orders [...] "null and void" [...] in 1896 could not dispute that the 'manual' succession, that is, the actual laying on of hands and prayer, had not been broken in as much as two of the four consecrators of Parker, Barlow and Hodgkins, had been ordained with the Roman Pontifical in the Latin Rite in the 1530s, and all of them had been made bishops by bishops who were consecrated with the Roman Pontifical, the Roman Catholic Church asserted in the condemnation of 1896 that [...] "defect of form and intent" [...] of consecration were insufficient to make a bishop, and therefore represented a break in the apostolic succession, but the Church of England has rejected this, arguing that the form of words used made no difference to the substance or validity of the act, and that the words in the Rite itself gave plenty of evidence as to the intent. The Roman Catholic viewpoint stated that the Rite to be valid had to include the intent to make a sacrificing priest. The Anglicans retorted that the only things that ordination rites had in common throughout the history of the Church was the laying on of hands and prayer. In any case Parker was already a 'sacrificing' priest as he had been ordained as such in 1527 in the Latin Rite and before the break with Rome. Elizabeth wanted a moderate man, so she chose Parker. There was also an emotional attachment. Parker had been the favourite chaplain of Elizabeth's mother, Anne Boleyn. Before Anne was arrested in 1536, she had entrusted Elizabeth's spiritual well-being to Parker. A few days after this, Anne had been executed following charges of adultery, incest and treason. Parker also possessed all the qualifications Elizabeth expected from an archbishop, except celibacy. Elizabeth had a strong prejudice against married clergy, and in addition she seems to have disliked Margaret Parker personally, often treating her so rudely that her husband was [...] "in horror to hear it." [...] After a visit to Lambeth, the Queen duly thanked her hostess but maliciously asked how she should address her, [...] "For Madam I may not call <b>you,</b> mistress I <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> to call you".|$|R
