500|$|Lyrically, Aguilera compares {{her love}} to office equipment, from paperclips to rubber-bands, {{as a metaphor}} for a relationship. The lyric [...] "A rubber band is what I call your love for me, cause it comes and goes and pins me like a trampoline" [...] was spoken by Aguilera at the beginning. The part [...] "If I was a ruler I'd try to set <b>you</b> <b>straight,</b> but your love is like a sharpener, it really grates" [...] was praised by several critics, while the lines [...] "A rubber band was an analogy, you can even say it's a metaphor" [...] were {{described}} by others as unnecessary, with Becky Bain for Idolator calling it [...] "dumber-than-dumb". Toward the closing moments, she sings, [...] "Paper clips they couldn't even hold us together... when your love hits, it sticks me like a stapler." ...|$|E
500|$|Two {{months prior}} to her death, Alcorn sought out help on the social media website Reddit, asking users whether the {{treatment}} perpetrated by her parents was considered child abuse. There, she revealed that while her parents had never physically assaulted her, [...] "they always talked {{to me in a}} very derogatory tone" [...] and [...] "would say things like 'You'll never be a real girl' or 'What're you going to do, fuck boys?' or 'God's going to send <b>you</b> <b>straight</b> to hell'. These all made me feel awful about myself, I was Christian at the time so I thought that God hated me and that I didn't deserve to be alive." [...] Further, she explained, [...] "I tried my absolute hardest to live up to their standards and be a straight male, but eventually I realized that I hated religion and my parents." [...] On Reddit, Alcorn also disclosed that she was prescribed increasing dosages of the anti-depressant Prozac. In concluding her post, she wrote, [...] "Please help me, I don't know what I should do and I can't take much more of this." ...|$|E
500|$|Blige's {{seasoned}} soul {{coupled with}} Bey's creamy delivery is a mood to behold." [...] Andy Gill of The Independent wrote that Beyoncé [...] "act as a Greek chorus" [...] to the song. Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle noted that [...] "Love a Woman" [...] is a soulful, old-school ballad [...] "that {{brings out the}} best in both singers". Writing that Blige is [...] "particularly heavy" [...] on the R vibes of the song, Andrew Martin of Prefix Magazine further commented that [...] "without a doubt, it's sure to gain some stream whenever radio DJs catch wind of it. Why? Because 'Love a Woman' features silky production, strong harmonies, and guest vocals from Beyoncé. Yeah, there's no stopping this one." [...] Katie Hasty of HitFix commented that [...] "It's actually a pretty standard list of grievances and explanations, but the real guts of the thing is when the two light up, to bring out the best vocal performances in each other, shooting <b>you</b> <b>straight</b> back to the 1990s." [...] Kevin Ritchie of Now gave a mixed review for the song saying that it aims [...] "for posterity rather than chemistry". Similarly, Adam Markovitz of Entertainment Weekly described the duet as [...] "snoozy".|$|E

2500|$|In 2011, Kevin D. Williamson, {{reviewing}} The Thomas Sowell Reader for Commentary, said [...] "If a mad scientist were {{to repair}} to his laboratory {{to design a}} machine that would make white liberals uncomfortable, that machine would be Thomas Sowell, whose input is data and whose output is socioeconomic criticism in several grades, ranging from bemused observation to thorough debunking to high-test scorn—all of which are represented in The Thomas Sowell Reader". Williamson says [...] "Thomas Sowell is that rarest of things among serious academics: plainspoken... His plain speaking also makes him dangerous, and that danger is intensified {{by the fact that}} Sowell is black. And not just black, but unassailably black: He's Southern-born, Harlem-raised, brought up poor, and the first of his family to be educated beyond the sixth grade... Because he is black, his opinions about race are controversial. If he were white, they probably would be unpublishable. This is a rare case in which we are all beneficiaries of American racial hypocrisy. That he works in the special bubble of permissiveness extended by the liberal establishment to some conservatives who are black (in exchange for their being regarded as inauthentic, self-loathing, soulless race traitors) must be maddening to Sowell, even more so than it is for other notable black conservatives. It is plain that the core of his identity, his heart of hearts, is not that of a man who is black. It is that of a man who knows a whole lot more about things than you do and is intent on setting <b>you</b> <b>straight,</b> at length if necessary, if you'd only listen." ...|$|E
