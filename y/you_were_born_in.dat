2500|$|Despite the {{existence}} of Obama's Hawaii certification of live birth, Terry Lakin's attorney, among others, have claimed that anyone, including foreign-born children, could acquire a Hawaiian certification of live birth, and so Obama's possession of such a certificate does not prove that {{he was born in}} Hawaii. However, the suggestion that this could have applied to Obama was rejected by Janice Okubo, director of communications for the Hawaii Department of Health: [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>born</b> <b>in</b> Bali, for example, you could get a certificate from the state of Hawaii saying <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>born</b> <b>in</b> Bali. You could not get a certificate saying <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>born</b> <b>in</b> Honolulu. The state has to verify a fact like that for it to appear on the certificate". Another fact that refutes this specific claim is that the law allowing foreign-born children to obtain Hawaiian birth certificates did not exist until 20 years after Obama was born, while Obama’s published birth certificate says his birth information was recorded four days after his birth in 1961, and explicitly states that he was born in Honolulu.|$|E

I come from a once dark land – a land of cannibal cruelty – but Christianity has raised us from the lowest degradation, and now we are a Christian people. We are now trying to establish law and order in our land, and I ask you to help us. We most earnestly desire the establishment of law, and if you will help us it can be done. We want to govern Fiji in every respect as this land is governed. I have come to white man's land to be trained at Newington College. I am anxious to be taught. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>born</b> <b>in</b> the light, I in the darkness. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>born</b> <b>in</b> a Christian land, I in a heathen country. I wish to be trained here that I may be of service in the government of my own country. Again I thank you for so heartily drinking prosperity to Fiji." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{scale of}} {{inequality}} {{around the world}} is almost unfathomable. The average inhabitant of Norway, Qatar and Switzerland earns more in one day than what the average inhabitant of Malawi and Burundi earns in an entire year 1. If you get pregnant in Sierra Leone, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> 300 times more likely to die from pregnancy related causes than if you get pregnant in Sweden 2. If <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>born</b> <b>in</b> Angola or the Central African Republic, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> 50 times more likely to die within your first year of life than if <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>born</b> <b>in</b> Singapore. Currently, about 60 % of the variation in income across the globe is explained by country citizenship alone, while parental income class within the country where <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>born</b> explains another 20 % (Milanovic, 2011). This means that at least 80 % of the variation in income (and other income related factors) is already determined by birth, leaving less than 20 % to be determined by a person's own effort, ingenuity, planning, determination, risk-taking and passion. Thus, the world is not just a place of huge inequality of outcomes, but also of huge inequality of opportunity. Inequality is becoming an increasingly concerning issue and recently 176 countries agreed that one of the Sustainable Development Goals for the next 15 years should be to "reduce inequality within and among countries. " One of the specific targets associated with this goal is to "facilitate orderly, safe, regular and responsible migration and mobility of people, including through the implementation of planned and well-managed migration policies. ...|$|R
