5|$|After {{the science}} fiction-focused Moonraker, the {{producers}} wanted {{a return to}} the style of the early Bond films and the works of 007 creator Fleming. For <b>Your</b> <b>Eyes</b> Only followed a grittier, more realistic approach and a narrative theme of revenge and its consequences. Filming locations included Greece, Italy and England, while underwater footage was shot in The Bahamas.|$|E

5|$|Following For <b>Your</b> <b>Eyes</b> Only, Roger Moore had {{expressed}} a desire to stop playing James Bond. His original contract had been for three films, a requirement fulfilled with The Spy Who Loved Me. Subsequent films had been negotiated on a film-by-film basis. The producers engaged in a semi-public quest for the next actor to play Bond, which would be for Octopussy. However, when Kevin McClory announced his re-working of Thunderball as Never Say Never Again, the producers re-contracted Moore in the belief that an established actor in the role would fare better against McClory's choice of Bond, Sean Connery. Before For <b>Your</b> <b>Eyes</b> Only had been released, Albert Broccoli had asked John Glen to return and direct Octopussy. George MacDonald Fraser wrote an initial treatment that was extensively revised by Michael G. Wilson and Richard Maibaum.|$|E
5|$|For <b>Your</b> <b>Eyes</b> Only is a 1981 British spy {{film and}} the twelfth in the James Bond series to be {{produced}} by Eon Productions, and the fifth to star Roger Moore as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond. It marked the directorial debut of John Glen, who had worked as editor and second unit director in three other Bond films.|$|E
5|$|For <b>Your</b> <b>Eyes</b> Only is a {{collection}} of short stories by the British author Ian Fleming, featuring the fictional British Secret Service agent Commander James Bond. It was first published by Jonathan Cape on 11 April 1960. It marked a change of format for Fleming, who had previously written James Bond stories only as full-length novels.|$|E

5|$|For <b>Your</b> <b>Eyes</b> Only was {{released}} on 24 June 1981, ten years after release of Diamonds Are Forever (1971), to a mixed critical reception; the film was a financial success, generating $195.3 million worldwide. This was the final Bond film to be distributed solely by United Artists; the studio merged with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer soon after this film's release.|$|E
5|$|In 1984 Michael G. Wilson joined Albert R. Broccoli as co-producer at Eon. Wilson {{had first}} {{worked on a}} Bond {{production}} in February 1964 with the filming of Goldfinger. He had worked on every production since The Spy Who Loved Me, and had been executive producer on Moonraker, For <b>Your</b> <b>Eyes</b> Only and Octopussy.|$|E
5|$|The {{assistant}} {{director for the}} Italian locations, Victor Tourjansky, had a cameo as a man drinking his wine as Bond's Lotus emerges from the beach.

5|$|A {{number of}} Moore's {{personal}} preferences were transferred into his characterisation of Bond: his taste for Cuban cigars and his wearing of safari suits {{were assigned to}} the character. Moore's use for cigars in his early films put him in contrast to the cigarette-smoking Connery, Lazenby and Dalton. By the time of Moore's fifth film, For <b>Your</b> <b>Eyes</b> Only, released in 1981, his characterisation had come to represent an old-fashioned character, in contrast to the fashionability Connery had brought to the role in the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} {{merchandising}} of For <b>Your</b> <b>Eyes</b> Only, Marvel Comics {{published an}} adaptation of the movie as issue 19 of Marvel Comics Super Special; this was also repackaged as a two-issue comic book adaptation of the film. The first issue was released in October 1981 and was soon followed by the second issue in November of the same year. The adaptation was written by Larry Hama, pencilled by Howard Chaykin, inked by Vincent Colletta, and edited by Dennis O'Neil.|$|E
5|$|Bernard Lee died in January 1981, after filming {{had started}} on For <b>Your</b> <b>Eyes</b> Only, {{but before he}} could film his scenes as M, the head of MI6, as he had done in the {{previous}} eleven films of the series. Out of respect, no new actor was hired to assume the role and, instead, the script was re-written so that the character is said to be on leave, letting Chief of Staff Bill Tanner take over the role as acting head of MI6 and briefing Bond alongside the Minister of Defence.|$|E
