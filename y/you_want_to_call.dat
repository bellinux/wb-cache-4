500|$|Steve Harris, Dave Murray and Doug Sampson {{spent the}} summer and autumn of 1978 rehearsing while they searched for a singer to {{complete}} the band's new line-up. A chance meeting at the Red Lion pub in Leytonstone in November 1978 evolved into a successful audition for vocalist Paul Di'Anno. Steve Harris has stated, [...] "There's sort of a quality in Paul's voice, a raspiness in his voice, or whatever <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> it, that just gave it this great edge." [...] At this time, Murray would typically act as their sole guitarist, with Harris commenting, [...] "Davey was so good he {{could do a lot}} of it on his own. The plan was always to get a second guitarist in, but finding one that could match Davey was really difficult." ...|$|E

500|$|Al Kooper {{recalled}} {{that both the}} album title, Blonde on Blonde, and song titles arrived during the mixing sessions. [...] "When they were mixing it, we were sitting around and Bob Johnston came in and said, 'What do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> this?' And [...] just like said them out one at a time... Free association and silliness, I'm sure, played a big role." [...] Another Dylan chronicler, Oliver Trager, notes that besides spelling out the initials of Dylan's first name, the album title is also a riff on Brecht on Brecht, a stage production based on works by German playwright Bertolt Brecht that had influenced his early songwriting. Dylan himself has said of the title: [...] "Well, I don't even recall exactly how it came up, but I know {{it was all in}} good faith... I don't know who thought of that. I certainly didn't." ...|$|E

[...] Tolle has mentioned texts such as the Tao Te Ching, the Bhagavad Gita and other Hindu scriptures, the Buddhist scriptures, the Old Testament, the New Testament, and A Course in Miracles; he has mentioned various individuals such as Zoroaster, Lao Tzu, Mahavira, Gautama Buddha, Heraclitus, Parmenides, Jesus, Epictetus, Marcus Aurelius, Rumi, Meister Eckhart, Hafiz, Rinzai Gigen, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Carl Gustav Jung; and he has emphasized the mystical schools within religions such as Gnosticism in Christianity, Sufism in Islam, Hasidism and Kabbala in Judaism, Advaita Vedanta in Hinduism, and Zen and Dzogchen in Buddhism.|$|E
500|$|The term [...] "Obamacare" [...] was {{originally}} coined by opponents as a pejorative. The term emerged in March 2007 when healthcare lobbyist Jeanne Schulte Scott {{used it in}} a health industry journal, writing [...] "We will soon see a 'Giuliani-care' and 'Obama-care' {{to go along with}} 'McCain-care', 'Edwards-care', and a totally revamped and remodeled 'Hillary-care' from the 1990s". According to research by Elspeth Reeve, the expression was used in early 2007, generally by writers describing the candidate's proposal for expanding coverage for the uninsured. It first appeared in a political campaign by Mitt Romney in May 2007 in Des Moines, Iowa. Romney said, [...] "In my state, I worked on healthcare for some time. We had half a million people without insurance, and I said, 'How can we get those people insured without raising taxes and without having government take over healthcare?' And let me tell you, if we don't do it, the Democrats will. If the Democrats do it, it will be socialized medicine; it'll be government-managed care.

500|$|Costa's first {{recording}} {{as leader}} was in 1956, with his trio featuring bassist Vinnie Burke and drummer Nick Stabulas. This was released under slightly differing titles by Josie Records and Jubilee Records, and was well received: critic John S. Wilson, for instance, {{commented on the}} [...] "roaring, spitting piano solos by Eddie Costa". Around this time, Costa was nicknamed [...] "The Bear" [...] by Burke for his powerful playing. Also in 1956, Costa and Burke joined guitarist Tal Farlow, forming a resident trio {{to play at the}} Composer, a club on West 58th Street in New York. Farlow's comment on the absence of a drummer from the trio was that [...] "Eddie's feeding, comping or whatever <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> it was so fierce that there was no doubt at all where the time was, so I didn't miss the drums at all". The trio stayed together, recording several albums under Farlow's name, until, in 1958, the Composer closed. Costa was often in recording studios as a sideman around this time: he appeared on approximately 20 albums in both 1956 and 1957. These included small group settings with Herbie Mann, Oscar Pettiford, and Phil Woods, and accompanying vocalists such as Tony Bennett and Chris Connor.|$|E
500|$|... "Don't You Wanna Stay" [...] is {{a country}} pop song with a length of four minutes and sixteen seconds. It {{incorporates}} melancholic guitar riff which is accompanied by classical elements such as violin. Mikael Wood of Billboard described the song as [...] "a dramatic, slow building power ballad {{in the style of}} Bonnie Tyler's [...] "Total Eclipse of the Heart"", a view held similar by John Hill of About.com who considered the song as a [...] "classic power ballad", writing [...] "whether <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> the song country, pop, or something in between doesn't matter because the chorus is so catchy that it doesn't matter if you use an electric guitar or a steel guitar." [...] It is set in common time and has a steady tempo of 72 beats per minute. It is written in the key of G-sharp minor and both Aldean and Clarkson's vocals span two octaves, from A♯3 to G♯5. It follows the chord progression G♯m–E–B. Bob Peacock of Roughstock thought that the structure of the song was interesting with its brief four-line verses and [...] "don't you wanna stay's throughout the chorus. As the chorus of the song starts in, the sound of electric and slide guitars are prominent as Aldean and Clarkson sing, [...] "Don't you wanna hold each other tight / Don't you wanna fall asleep with me tonight?" ...|$|E
500|$|A deluxe edition {{included}} a DVD with a making-of {{feature of the}} recording process, {{as well as a}} track-by-track commentary by the band. The iTunes edition included [...] "Long Time Comin'" [...] and the music video for [...] "Sink into Me" [...] as bonus tracks. In promoting the album, Warner Bros. Senior Vice-President of Marketing Rob Gordon said the promotional campaign would accomplish two objectives: [...] "No. 1 is energizing the fan base. No. 2 is taking this band from the world of ... whatever <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> it to an arena-rock band," [...] such as the Foo Fighters. To help with the first point, the label worked with Myspace to hold listening sessions aboard the band's tour bus in various cities. The album's release was followed by a European tour in July. [...] "New Again" [...] was released as a single on July 24 with an acoustic version of [...] "Sink into Me" [...] as the B-side. In late July and early August, the band toured the UK with support from Twin Atlantic. In August and September, the band supported Blink-182 on their North American tour and performed at Virgin Mobile FreeFest. [...] "Where My Mouth Is" [...] was released to radio on September 1. In late October, the band went on a brief tour of the US.|$|E

50|$|Comm South Companies {{was created}} and opened for {{business}} in the late 1990s. They offered prepaid home phone service to anyone regardless of credit, past due bills, or proof of identity. When the company started all dial tone lines were completely blocked meaning that only local telephone calls could be made and no collect, 900, or other toll calls could be made. If <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> long distance <b>you</b> {{would be required to}} buy a prepaid long distance card from a local store. Over time, Comm South Companies acquired a long distance plan which would allow you to make long distance calls from your home phone which was prepaid in advance. Each bill you received from Comm South was a bill for the next month of service and the due date was before that next month of service which is why the service was prepaid before you even used it to prevent people from running up high bills and not paying.|$|R
500|$|In the {{subsequent}} decade, two pioneers {{of the style}} became increasingly commercially viable. According to Nielsen Soundscan, Napalm Death sold 367,654 units between May 1991 and November 2003, while Carcass sold 220,374 units in the same period. The inclusion of Napalm Death's [...] "Twist the Knife (Slowly)" [...] on the Mortal Kombat soundtrack brought the band much greater visibility, as the compilation scored a Top 10 position in the Billboard 200 chart and went platinum {{in less than a}} year.< The originators of the style have expressed some ambivalence regarding {{the subsequent}} popularity of grindcore. Pete Hurley, the guitarist of Extreme Noise Terror, declared that he had no interest in being remembered as a pioneer of this style: [...] "'grindcore' was a legendarily stupid term coined by a hyperactive kid from the West Midlands, and {{it had nothing to do}} with us whatsoever. ENT were, are, and - I suspect - always will be a hardcore punk band... not a grindcore band, a stenchcore band, a trampcore band, or any other sub-sub-sub-core genre-defining term you can come up with." [...] Lee Dorian of Napalm Death indicated that [...] "Unfortunately, I think the same thing happened to grindcore, if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> it that, as happened to punk rock - all the great original bands were just plagiarised by a billion other bands who just copied their style identically, making it no longer original and no longer extreme." ...|$|E
500|$|Teri VanHorn of MTV {{said that}} with [...] "Her body newly toned and her smile beaming, she looked every bit like {{a woman who had}} emerged from her quarter-life crisis {{stronger}} than yesterday." [...] She also said Spears performed with [...] "a naughty, free-spirited attitude", as though she [...] "had invited 900 friends to her dirty little dance party, and too bad for you if you couldn't roll with the fun." [...] SuChin Pak, also from MTV stated the show was [...] "no huge revelation", explaining, [...] "It {{was not the kind of}} show that says: 'She's back. She's going to come out with the biggest album of her career.' Nor did it say that she's lost forever and we'll never see the old Britney back again. These are all really tiny baby steps." [...] Thomas K. Arnold of USA Today said the show [...] "turned out to be more rehearsal than comeback", although [...] "all those post-rehab workouts were worth the effort." [...] On May 2, 2007, scalpers outside the House of Blues in San Diego were selling tickets with a face value of $35 for prices between $200 and $500. Chris Lee of the Los Angeles Times wrote that [...] "her 'comeback'– if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> it that– cemented Spears' place as pop music's reigning drama queen, capable of capturing worldwide tabloid headlines with a bare minimum of creative expenditure." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Greg Kot, 808s & Heartbreak {{initiated}} the [...] "wave of inward-looking sensitivity" [...] and [...] ""-inspired rappers {{during the late}} 2000s: [...] " [...] presaged everything from the introspective hip-hop of Kid Cudi's [...] (2009) to the wispy crooning, plush keyboards and light mechanical beats of Bon Iver's Justin Vernon and British dub-step balladeer James Blake." [...] Consequence of Sound credited it with shaping subsequent developments in [...] "indie R or electropop or whatever <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> it": [...] "808s is flooded with R and it digitizes the raw emotion and isolated feelings that [...] have carved their brands out of today." [...] Craig D. Linsey from The Village Voice wrote that the album's [...] "naked humanity ... practically set off the emo-rap/r boom that everyone from Drake to Frank Ocean to The Weeknd now traffic in." [...] Marcus Scott of GIANT said rappers such as B.o.B, Drake, and Kid Cudi followed West's album with similarly-minded works, citing West's introspective, emotional themes and synthpop/"Vangelis-inspired" [...] music as influences. In the opinion of Billboard senior editor Alex Gale, the album was [...] "the equivalent of (Bob) Dylan going electric, and you still hear that all the time, in hip-hop and outside of hip-hop." [...] Drake's 2009 mixtape So Far Gone received comparisons from critics to 808s & Heartbreak. Todd Martens of the Los Angeles Times cited 808s & Heartbreak as [...] "the template [...] for essentially the entirety of Drake's young career", and that wrote that he [...] "shares West's love for mood and never-ending existential analysis". In a 2009 interview, Drake cited West as [...] "the most influential person" [...] in shaping his own sound. In 2014, Rolling Stone named 808s & Heartbreak one of the 40 most groundbreaking albums of all time. On September 26, 2015, West performed the album in its entirety at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles.|$|E
