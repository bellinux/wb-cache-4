40|$|Contemporary {{discussions of}} young women's {{relationship}} to feminism rest on assumptions that position both <b>young</b> <b>women</b> and feminism in particular ways. Feminism is constructed as irrelevant to <b>young</b> <b>women,</b> and/or <b>young</b> <b>women</b> are represented as antagonistic or apathetic towards feminism, {{at least in}} contemporary western societies. Such representations position <b>young</b> <b>women</b> and feminism as distinct and separate entities, each with their own internal cohesion, so that diversity between <b>young</b> <b>women</b> [...] and between feminisms [...] is overlooked. These assumptions comprise the discursive arena in which discussion of the possible meanings and relevance of feminism for <b>young</b> <b>women</b> takes place. In this article I take a critical look at the discursive construction of 'feminism' and 'young women' in the popular domain, going on to consider the implications for debates about young women's relationship with feminism.

40|$|Gateshead Young Women’s Outreach Project (GYWOP) offers support, {{information}} and empowering learning opportunities for <b>young</b> <b>women,</b> including <b>young</b> mothers, aged 13 to 19. The research team, including peer researchers, worked with <b>young</b> <b>women</b> accessing GYWOP, {{as well as}} 58 other services, to ascertain what excellent integrated working practice looks like and feels like for <b>young</b> <b>women.</b> Six focus groups, comprising approximately 30 <b>young</b> <b>women,</b> {{were involved in the}} research. The first was peer researchers. Two of the groups consisted of <b>young</b> <b>women</b> who were pregnant, or mothers {{who were involved in the}} project as they were not yet ready to move on to other more formal education, employment or training. Another consisted of mothers or expectant mothers who were of statutory school age. Another was made up of <b>young</b> <b>women</b> of statutory school age but not mothers, who either did not attend school or attended very little due to circumstances often related to bullying. The last group consisted of <b>young</b> <b>women,</b> some of whom were mothers, who had issues in their lives, resulting in isolation and low selfesteem. The main findings were as follows. • The importance of the ethos and general environment of the service. This impacts on the engagement of <b>young</b> <b>women</b> and adds to their confidence and general wellbeing, contributing to positive outcomes and progression. • The value of the service and a holistic approach are important, as is ease of access, varied communication methods, a range of social interaction and learning opportunities. • Being treated with respect is paramount. • Perceptions - <b>young</b> <b>women</b> can ‘pick up’ on things that are not necessarily intended - workers need to be extra sensitive and aware of the impact on <b>young</b> <b>women.</b> • It is vital that <b>young</b> <b>women</b> feel that they can trust workers. For <b>young</b> <b>women</b> in care, confidentiality is a serious concern, leading to the feeling that ‘everyone knows their business’. • <b>Young</b> <b>women</b> need to feel in control of what is happening to them and value voluntary engagement with services. • Affirmation by workers has an extremely positive impact, giving feelings of pride and self-worth.
