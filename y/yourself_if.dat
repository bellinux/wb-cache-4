25|$|Yes, I suppose. The {{violence}} {{served a}} therapeutic purpose. It's unsettling {{to think that}} at any moment life can flare up into senseless violence. But it can and does, and {{people need to be}} ready for it. What you make for others is first of all what you make for <b>yourself.</b> <b>If</b> I’m persuaded that our life is predicated upon violence, that the entire structure of what we call civilization, the scaffolding that we’ve built up over the millennia, can collapse at any moment, then whatever I write is going to be affected by that assumption. The process of life presupposes violence, in the plant world the same as the animal world. But among the animals only man can conceptualize violence. Only man can enjoy the idea of destruction.|$|E

They don't hear your accent and make assumptions. All they see are your words." ...|$|E

500|$|Hepburn {{is one of}} {{the most}} celebrated American actresses, but she has also been criticized for a lack of versatility. Her {{on-screen}} persona closely matched her own real personality, something Hepburn admitted herself. In 1991 she told a journalist, [...] "I think I'm always the same. I had a very definite personality and I liked material that showed that personality." [...] Playwright and author David Macaray has said, [...] "Picture Katharine Hepburn in every movie she ever starred in and ask <b>yourself</b> <b>if</b> she's not playing, essentially, the same part over and over... Icon or no icon, let's not confuse a truly fascinating and unique woman with a superior actress." [...] Another repeated criticism is that her demeanor was too cold.|$|E
500|$|... "The {{ultimate}} thing {{behind the}} song {{is that if you}} don't express <b>yourself,</b> <b>if</b> you don't say what you want, then you're not going to get it. And in effect you are chained down by your inability to say what you feel or go after what you want. No matter how in control you think are about sexuality in a relationship there is always the power struggle... always a certain amount of compromise. Of being beholden, if you love them. You do it because you choose to. No one put the chain around this neck but me. I wrote 'Express Yourself' to tell women around the world that pick and choose the best for yourself, before that chain around your neck, kills you instead. It's my take on how man can express what they want, the same prerogative should be there for a woman too." ...|$|E
500|$|Postmodern {{cultural}} critic bell hooks {{cited the}} interaction in the Memphis train station between Thomas and the Japanese couple {{as one of}} the few examples of nuanced, deconstructive and subversive treatment of blackness in American film. In his original review for the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert proclaimed that [...] "he best thing about Mystery Train is that it takes you to an America you feel you ought to be able to find for <b>yourself,</b> <b>if</b> you only knew where to look." [...] He later included the movie in his Great Movies collection, comparing the movie favorably to Jarmusch's later efforts like Dead Man and The Limits of Control. In an April 2000 retrospective of Jarmusch's work for Sight & Sound, Shawn Levy concluded that the film was [...] "as much a valentine to the allure of the American way of pop culture as it is a cheeky bit of structural legerdemain without terribly much resonating significance".|$|E

500|$|Nine Inch Nails toured North America as {{an opening}} act for The Jesus and Mary Chain in 1990, and later for Peter Murphy. During these tours, Reznor began to smash {{equipment}} while on stage, and Rockbeat interviewer Mike Gitter attributed the band's early success to this aggressive attitude. In 1991, the band undertook a world tour that {{continued through the}} first Lollapalooza festival, where, according to biographer Martin Huxley, they [...] "stole the show". New Musical Express had a sentiment after the performance, describing the show as [...] "genuinely frightening", and asking the reader to [...] "decide for <b>yourself</b> <b>if</b> it's choreographed chaos or unbridled grievous bodily harm". Nine Inch Nails was then invited to open for Guns N' Roses on their European Tour, though they were reportedly poorly received yet again. [...] Before the Lollapalooza date, Chris Vrenna left the band due to a fall out with Reznor, and was replaced {{for the remainder of}} the tour by drummer Jeff Ward. Vrenna would rejoin the band for the Self-Destruct tour in 1994. [...] At the conclusion of the Pretty Hate Machine tour, Richard Patrick left the group to form his own band, Filter.|$|E
500|$|De Lucía was {{influenced}} primarily by Niño Ricardo, a leading {{figure in the}} history of flamenco guitar, and Sabicas, {{regarded as one of the}} most influential musicians involved in the development and refinement of the flamenco guitar as a concert instrument at a time when the guitar was considered an instrument meant to merely accompany a singer. Sabicas was a mentor to Paco in developing his flamenco guitar technique, as well in honing Paco's skills as a composer, characterized by melodic structure, rhythmic and harmonic, perfectly consistent from beginning to end, and non-lyrical phrased guitar falsetas when the singer stops singing. Esteban de Sanlúcar and Mario Escudero were also major influences on him and sources of inspiration. According to biographer Pohren, de Lucía was [...] "fascinated with jazz" [...] and held a deep respect for high-tech jazz musicians, regarding Di Meola, McLaughlin, Coryell and Corea as highly as musicians as he did his flamenco mentors. Despite these influences, according to the Jazz Times, [...] "Most flamenco fans can trace the music's history to either Before Paco or After Paco." [...] In 2004 interview with El País he said [...] "I have always found that the more technique you have the easier it is to express <b>yourself.</b> <b>If</b> you lack technique you lose the freedom to create." [...] Like many other flamenco guitarists he often played a Hermanos Conde guitar and had his own signature model, but had a range of guitars in his collection.|$|E

2500|$|October – On October 25, the Mormons and Gays website was {{revised and}} moved to mormonandgay.lds.org where it states, [...] "If you {{experience}} same-sex attraction, you may choose to use a sexual orientation label to describe <b>yourself.</b> ... <b>If</b> you decide to... openly identify as gay, you should be supported."

Wellington then stood up in Copenhagen's stirrups, and waved his hat {{in the air to}} signal an advance of the Allied line just as the Prussians were {{overrunning}} the French positions to the east. What remained of the French army then abandoned the field in disorder. Wellington and Blücher met at the inn of La Belle Alliance, on the north-south road which bisected the battlefield, and it was agreed that the Prussians should pursue the retreating French army back to France. The Treaty of Paris was signed on 20 November 1815.|$|E

2500|$|For {{the ending}} of the film, Iliadis {{and the rest of the}} {{creative}} team chose to include the song [...] "Dirge", by psychedelic rock band Death in Vegas. Iliadis was hoping to find something that was both [...] "ironic" [...] and [...] "innocent" [...] at the same time, given the events in the film that would precede its usage. To the director, the choice helped to illuminate the fact that nothing will be the same for this family again. Craven comments on the choice to have John Collingwood return to finish off Krug at the end. Craven explains, [...] "I also found it interesting that the Dr., whose oath 'does no harm', intentionally [...] and that it kinda shows that when seeking revenge you can become something evil <b>yourself</b> <b>if</b> you don't stop once what's been necessary is done. So I also found it intriguing that we're just seeing these wonderful, perfect people but the father comes back and goes out of his way to do this." ...|$|E
2500|$|Speaking of Lopez's image, Andrew Barker of Variety observed: [...] "Despite a {{carefully}} cultivated image as an imperious pop empress in ludicrously expensive outfits, her signature hits bear the titles [...] "I'm Real" [...] and [...] "Jenny From the Block". She managed the perilous transition from actress to music star without ever seeming to pick {{either as a}} primary gig. She established herself as an oft-provocative sex symbol while her demeanor made it abundantly clear that she's {{not asking you to}} come hither." [...] In 2002, Lynette Holloway of The New York Times described Lopez as overexposed. She wrote: [...] "Forgive <b>yourself</b> <b>if</b> you are seeing Jennifer Lopez in your sleep. She is everywhere." [...] Holloway noted her image to be [...] "a dash of ghetto fabulousness" [...] and [...] "middle-class respectability" [...] for mass appeal. Entertainment Weekly observed a change in her public profile upon joining American Idol in 2011, writing: [...] "Gone was her old cut-a-bitch swagger; J. Lo 2.0 is an all-embracing, Oprahfied earth [...]" [...] Lopez is considered an icon of popular culture. Television presenter Ray Martin describes her as a [...] "showbiz phenomenon".|$|E
2500|$|Pravit {{reflected}} that while tyranny can be opposed {{when it is}} easily observed and palpable, {{it is harder to}} oppose when it takes the form of an [...] "invisible tyranny subtly embedded within us as a result of culture, norms, political and religious ideology, the palpable pressure of social conformity and our own personal biases". He explained, [...] "You can't readily observe the tyranny within <b>yourself</b> <b>if</b> you do not consciously try to examine or observe it. Some may think they can accept equal rights for people of various gender persuasions but may, deep down, be homophobic due to the deeply ingrained culture and popular discourse inculcating hatred or at least dislike towards gays, transsexuals, and lesbians. Some may think they are for democracy, but may have a hard time acting democratically when it comes to domestic relations, because inside they believe in some form of social hierarchy. Some may think they are for free speech and against censorship, but can hardly bear any hate speech or unfounded criticisms and accusation against them because they have little tolerance for differing views and in themselves believe in feeding others only the 'right' information." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ewell led his corps in the May 1864 Battle of the Wilderness and {{performed}} well, enjoying the rare circumstance of a slight numerical superiority over the Union corps that attacked him. In the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House, Lee {{felt compelled to}} lead {{the defense of the}} [...] "Mule Shoe" [...] on May 12 personally because of Ewell's indecision and inaction. At one point Ewell began hysterically berating some of his fleeing soldiers and beating them over the back with his sword. Lee reined in his enraged lieutenant, saying sharply, [...] "General Ewell, you must restrain yourself; how can you expect to control these men when you have lost control of <b>yourself?</b> <b>If</b> you cannot repress your excitement, you had better retire." [...] Ewell's behavior on this occasion undoubtedly was the source of a statement made by Lee to his secretary, William Allan, after the war that on May 12 he [...] "found Ewell perfectly prostrated by the misfortune of the morning, and too much overwhelmed to be efficient." [...] In the final combat at Spotsylvania, on May 19, 1864, Ewell ordered an attack on the Union left flank at the Harris Farm, which had little effect beyond delaying Grant for a day, at the cost of 900 casualties, about one-sixth of his remaining force.|$|E
2500|$|A {{tradition}} of Highland hospitality and chivalry concerns Clan Lamont and Clan Gregor. The story {{is supposed to}} take place around the year 1600. The son of the chief of Clan Lamont and the only son of MacGregor of Glenstrae, chief of Clan Gregor, went hunting together {{on the shores of}} Loch Awe. After the two men had made camp at nightfall they eventually became embroiled in a quarrel {{at the end of which}} Lamont grabbed his dirk and MacGregor was mortally wounded. Lamont then fled, hotly pursued by MacGregor's furious retainers, until losing his way and eventually making it to the house of the MacGregor chief himself. On hearing that Lamont was fleeing for his life, MacGregor promised the lad protection. Soon, though, the old MacGregor guessed it was his own son who had been slain, but considered himself bound to the Highland laws of hospitality, saying [...] "Here this night you shall be safe". With the arrival of the furious MacGregor clansman who pursued the young Lamont, the MacGregor chief was true to his word and protected Lamont from his clansmen's vengeance. Later, while it was still dark, the chief had Lamont personally conducted to Dunderave on Loch Fyne and provided him with a boat and oars. The chief bid him leave quickly, saying [...] "Flee for your life; in your own country we shall pursue you. Save <b>yourself</b> <b>if</b> you can!" ...|$|E
