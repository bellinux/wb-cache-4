500|$|The album's title {{comes from}} a saying which Fanning {{explained}} to The Age as [...] "you offer someone tea and sympathy, <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> with them, {{have a cup of}} tea and you just talk." [...] He noted that there is a credit on an album by The Rolling Stones for the provision of [...] "tea and sympathy". [...] The album cover photography and album inlay photography is by Ami Barwell ...|$|E
500|$|This {{would cause}} {{problems}} for the studio, Universal and partner MGM. [...] "The studio is just back from the holiday and is regrouping based on the news, and has no cohesive game plan at the moment," [...] said Kevin Misher, Universal's President of Production. Misher added that, [...] "It {{was one of those}} moments when <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> and think, 'Can Clarice be looked upon as James Bond for instance? A character who is replaceable?' Or was Jodie Foster Clarice Starling, and the audience will not accept anyone else?" [...] Foster said in December 1999 that the characterization of Starling in Hannibal had [...] "negative attributes" [...] and [...] "betrayed" [...] the original character.|$|E
500|$|The film {{opened in}} 3,929 theaters in the United States and Canada on May 16, 2008. The Motion Picture Association of America gave the film a PG. To earn this rating, which the filmmakers were contractually bound by Disney to do, Adamson altered {{a shot of}} a fallen helmet {{to make clear that}} it did not contain a severed head. Adamson made {{numerous}} edits to the film beforehand after showing the film to a young audience, explaining [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> and you're watching it, and you see the kids' faces while making the film, you're just making an attempt, you're making it exciting, you're doing all of these things because you're essentially making the film for yourself. When you start showing it to an audience, that then influences how you feel about the film." ...|$|E

It's the old {{joke about the}} part of Hamlet. I'll just step round to Aunt Mary's house--why, I'll be back in three minutes." ...|$|R

500|$|In March 2004, Biden {{secured the}} brief release of Libyan {{democracy}} activist and political prisoner Fathi Eljahmi, {{after meeting with}} leader Muammar Gaddafi in Tripoli. [...] In May 2008, Biden sharply criticized President George W. Bush for his speech to Israel's Knesset in which he suggested that some Democrats were acting {{in the same way}} some Western leaders did when they appeased Hitler in the runup to World War II. Biden stated: [...] "This is bullshit. This is malarkey. This is outrageous. Outrageous {{for the president of the}} United States to go to a foreign country, sit in the Knesset ... and make this kind of ridiculous statement." [...] Biden later apologized for using the expletive. Biden further stated, [...] "Since when does this administration think that if <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down,</b> you have to eliminate the word 'no' from your vocabulary?" ...|$|E
500|$|In [...] "How Orlo Got His Book", he {{described}} Orlo, a fictional, archetypal young {{child who was}} turned off of reading by the poor selection of simple reading material. To save Orlo the frustration, Geisel decided {{to write a book}} for children like Orlo but found the task [...] "not dissimilar to... being lost with a witch in a tunnel of love". He tried to write a story called [...] "The Queen Zebra" [...] but found that both words did not appear on the list. In fact, like Geisel wrote in [...] "My Hassle with the First Grade Language", the letters [...] "q" [...] and [...] "z" [...] did not appear on the list at all. He then tried to write a story about a bird, without using the word bird as it did not appear on the list. He decided to call it a [...] "wing thing" [...] instead but struggled as he discovered that it [...] "couldn't have legs or a beak or a tail. Neither a left foot or a right foot." [...] On his approach to writing The Cat in the Hat he wrote, [...] "The method I used is the same method you use when <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> to make apple stroodle [...] without stroodles." ...|$|E
500|$|The lyrics for Wasting Light were {{completed}} {{during the week}} each song was being recorded. Grohl said that the words were [...] "what was on my mind each week", most being [...] "written {{from the perspective of}} who I was then and who I am now", with references to the past, life and death, and [...] "time, but questioning whether it matters at all. There's so much focus on the before that people forget there's an after." [...] The frontman said this was helped by the environment - [...] "a lot of retrospection and introspection and nostalgia going back to the way we used to make records" [...] - and working with Vig again, which [...] "made me think a lot about starting over, and rebirth, and making your way through tragedy and coming out the other side." [...] An example was [...] "I Should Have Known", partially inspired by former Nirvana bandmate Kurt Cobain - [...] "a song like 'I Should Have Known' is about all the people I've lost, not just Kurt". Grohl still tried to do laid-back songs such as [...] "White Limo", which had its lyrics written in just two minutes, specially after Mendel sent him an e-mail saying, [...] "I really like it when you write songs that are silly and mean nothing, too. You don't have to try to write 'Imagine' every time <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> with a pen and paper".|$|E

2500|$|... "You should {{bend your}} knees from the thighs down. [...] As your knees bend, {{the upper part of}} the trunk remains {{normally}} erect, just as it does when <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> in a chair. In golf, the sit-down motion is more like lowering yourself onto a spectator-sports-stick. [...] Think of the seat of the stick as being about two inches or so below your buttocks." ...|$|E
2500|$|Then verse 7 goes on {{to remind}} the {{community}} to remember all the commandments and to [...] "teach them diligently to your children and speak of them when <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> and when you walk, when you lie down and when you rise", to recite the words of God when retiring or rising; to bind those words [...] "on thy arm and thy head" [...] (classically Jewish oral tradition interprets as tefillin), and to [...] "inscribe them on the door-posts of your house and on your gates" [...] (referring to mezuzah).|$|E
2500|$|Overall {{critical}} {{reception for}} Mega Man V has been average to positive. While {{many aspects of}} the game were commended, critics found very little change from previous installments in the series. VideoGames summarized, [...] "If you don't have a Mega Man game for your Game Boy, this one is a good as any. It's entertaining...it's Mega Man. If you're thinking 'rehash', you might be right and it's still a pretty fun game, though." [...] Nintendo Power was impressed by its gameplay and graphics, but felt that the game is too short, [...] "especially when <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> with the Super Game Boy and cruise". GamePro was contrastingly unimpressed with the controls on the SNES, considering the use of Game Boy much simpler.|$|E
