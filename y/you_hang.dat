500|$|Hawke has {{repeatedly}} denounced what he perceives {{to be an}} overemphasis placed {{on the importance of}} monogamy in romantic relationships: [...] "People have such a childish view of monogamy and fidelity. 'He's cheated so he's bad, she's cheated so she's bad', as opposed to a recognition that our species is not monogamous...Sexual fidelity can't be the whole thing <b>you</b> <b>hang</b> your relationship on. If you really love somebody you want them to grow, but you don't get to define how that happens. They do." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of World was {{created as a}} means to have an imaginary friend that was an entire world instead of the usual [...] "sentient being that <b>you</b> <b>hang</b> out with." [...] Baker suggested that the character should be portrayed as a young child, which McCracken agreed because it brought originality to the story, and allowed him to [...] "be more emotional, to not understand the bigger picture, to be confused and vulnerable and like a kid, to throw a fit when they don't get their way." ...|$|E

He wrote, [...] "The bar's been upgraded in recent years, but this mostly just means the diner-style food's edible and there's no pay phone. But if <b>you</b> <b>hang</b> around past 11 pm on a Friday, the wild union boys of Woodstock again arrive {{to reclaim the}} place, smokin', hootin', hollerin', who cares? It's the Lutz." ...|$|E
500|$|Her second studio album, One of the Boys, was {{released}} in June 2008. The pop-rock album was composed {{over a period of}} five years. The lead single, [...] "I Kissed a Girl", was co-written by Perry with Dr. Luke, Max Martin and Cathy Dennis, and alludes to bisexuality. Perry was the sole writer of [...] "Thinking of You", [...] "Mannequin", and the album's title track. The songs [...] "Mannequin" [...] and [...] "Lost" [...] have themes of determination and self-belief. The track [...] "Ur So Gay" [...] opens with the lyrics [...] "I hope <b>you</b> <b>hang</b> yourself with your H scarf," [...] which BBC critic Lizzie Ennever believed was Perry's response to people who may have [...] "wronged her in the past". During the recording process of the album, Perry had written the songs [...] "I Do Not Hook Up" [...] and [...] "Long Shot" [...] with Kara DioGuardi and Greg Wells, but decided not to include them on the final track list. They were later recorded by American singer Kelly Clarkson for her album All I Ever Wanted (2009). In 2009, she released a live album titled MTV Unplugged, which featured acoustic performances of five tracks from One of the Boys along with two new recordings, [...] "Brick by Brick" [...] and [...] "Hackensack".|$|E
500|$|Former {{president}} of the Czech Republic and writer VÃ¡clav Havel characterized the phrase among [...] "commonly canonized demagogical tricks." [...] The Economist popularized the term whataboutism in a 2008 article, for the repeated usage of this rhetorical tactic by the Soviet Union. The magazine wrote that the tactic became overused, {{and by the time}} of the 1991 dissolution of the Soviet Union, it had become a figure of speech referring to the entirety of Soviet propaganda. The book Exit from Communism edited by Stephen Richards Graubard made a similar point, that the term encapsulated an overall divorce from reality: [...] "Perhaps there are and perhaps there are not prison camps in Siberia, perhaps in the United States they do or perhaps they do not lynch blacks... Ultimately it does not matter whether we are for real or just pretending: it is all just part of the story." [...] With the election of Barack Obama as U.S. president in 2008, The New York Times reported that the tactic could see decreased usage: [...] "In Russia, for example, where Soviet leaders used to respond to any American criticism of human rights violation with 'But <b>you</b> <b>hang</b> Negroes,' analysts note that the election of Mr. Obama removes a stain." [...] Journalist George Feifer recounted in a 2009 article how when he traveled to Moscow in 1959 to cover the American National Exhibition, he faced those using the phrase against him. Feifer wrote: [...] "Skilled propagandists stationed among the listeners regularly interrupted to repeat questions intended to discredit me. Why did America tolerate shameful poverty and lynch Negroes?" [...] In 2011, author Michael Dobson wrote that the phrase was a form of the pot calling the kettle black, and a [...] "famous example" [...] of the tu quoque reasoning derived from a [...] "famous 1960s era Russian joke." ...|$|E

500|$|From 1998 to 1999, Sheen starred as Mozart in a {{successful}} revival of Amadeus. The Peter Hall-directed production was staged at the Old Vic, London and later {{transferred to the}} Music Box on Broadway. Ben Brantley, chief theatre critic for The New York Times, was particularly vocal in his praise. He noted that [...] "Mr. Sheen elicits a real poetry from the role" [...] and felt that, while watching him, [...] "you start to appreciate the derivation of the term star. This actor is so luminous it's scary!" [...] The Independent found him [...] "quite stunning as Mozart. His fantastically physical performance convinces you of his character's genius and the play catches fire whenever he's on stage." [...] Sheen {{was nominated for a}} Laurence Olivier Award for Best Supporting Performance and an Outer Critics Circle Award for Outstanding Actor. In 1999, Sheen explored the role of Jimmy Porter in the National Theatre's production of Look Back in Anger. In 2003, Sheen described the production as [...] "the most enjoyable thing I've ever done ... everything came together". The Daily Mail declared him a [...] "definitive Jimmy Porter... simply exhilarating in his great jazz riffs of speeches, mercurial and irresistible." [...] "Sheen has cornered the market in explosive energy", said The Independent, [...] "but this thrilling performance is his finest yet." [...] The Financial Times noted: [...] "As Jimmy Porter, a role of staggering difficulty in every way, Michael Sheen gives surely the best performance London has yet seen from him ... <b>You</b> <b>hang</b> on every word he utters ... This is a dazzlingly through-the-body performance." [...] He was nominated for a Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor and an Evening Standard Award for Best Actor.|$|E
500|$|Journalist Catherine Putz {{commented on}} the phrase in a 2016 article for the {{international}} news magazine The Diplomat, and compared it to use of whataboutism by businessman and politician Donald Trump: [...] "Criticisms {{of human rights in}} the Soviet Union were often met with what became a common catchphrase: 'And you are lynching Negroes'." [...] She pointed out the folly of its use: [...] "It demands, by default, for a state to argue abroad only in favor of ideals it has achieved the highest perfection in." [...] Writing for the liberal Israeli newspaper Haaretz, Israeli journalist Chemi Shalev made a similar comparison: [...] "Trump told the New York Times this week that America is in such a mess in terms of civil liberties that it cannot lecture foreign countries anymore, which is an echo of old Soviet propaganda that responded to American reprimands with the retort 'And you are lynching Negroes'." [...] Shalev followed-up on this analysis in a subsequent article, writing: [...] "Trump conducts pro-Russian propaganda along the same lines as the old retort 'And <b>You</b> <b>Hang</b> Blacks' with which the Soviets tried to deflect U.S. criticism of their human rights abuses. He isn't troubled by Putin's political opponents being murdered, because 'people get killed here too'." [...] Writing for ChinaFile after Trump won the 2016 U.S. election, James Palmer feared an increase in racism [...] "would give a brutal new credibility to the old Soviet whataboutism whenever they were challenged on the gulag: 'But in America, you lynch Negroes'." [...] In her work Security Threats and Public Perception, Elizaveta Gaufman characterized the phrase as a form of reversing someone's line of reasoning against them. Gaufman wrote that by using this phrase in an argument, one was tacitly refusing to answer queries posted to them and instead responding with condemnations.|$|E
