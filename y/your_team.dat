25|$|As {{an emotion}} {{regulation}} strategy, people can bet against a desired outcome. A New England Patriots fan, for example, could bet their opponents to win {{to reduce the}} negative emotions felt if the team loses a game. People typically do not bet against desired outcomes {{that are important to}} their identity, due to negative signal about their identity that making such a gamble entails. Betting against <b>your</b> <b>team</b> or political candidate, for example, may signal to you that you are not as committed to them as you thought you were.|$|E

In an address to charismatics he reemphasizes this: “You are able to shout out when <b>your</b> <b>team</b> scores a goal, and you cannot sing the Lord’s praises and leave behind your composure a little to sing”.

500|$|Championship runner-up Fernando Alonso {{expressed}} {{pride for}} his team, {{going so far}} as to call the 2012 season [...] "the best season of my career". During the podium interview with Nelson Piquet, he asserted: [...] "Obviously we lost the championship now, but I don't think, as you said, that we lost here in Brazil, we lost in some races where we were a little bit unlucky. But this is a sport, but when you do something with your heart, when you do something with 100 per cent, you have to be proud of <b>your</b> <b>team,</b> happy for them, and we will try next year." [...] The press later pointed out Alonso's [...] "grace after the race", contrasting him to Vettel who had criticized the competition's [...] "dirty tricks" [...] during his post-race press conference.|$|E
500|$|The {{situation}} escalated into {{a diplomatic}} incident. Figures {{high up in}} both the British and Australian government saw bodyline as potentially fracturing an international relationship that needed to remain strong. The Governor of South Australia, Alexander Hore-Ruthven, who was in England at the time, expressed his concern to British Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs James Henry Thomas that this would cause {{a significant impact on}} trade between the nations. The standoff was settled when the Australian prime minister, Joseph Lyons, met with members of the Australian Board and outlined to them the severe economic hardships that could be caused in Australia if the British public boycotted Australian trade. Following considerable discussion and debate in the English and Australian press, the Australian Board sent a cable to the MCC which, while maintaining its opposition to bodyline bowling, stated [...] "We do not regard the sportsmanship of <b>your</b> <b>team</b> as being in question". Even so, correspondence between the Australian Board and the MCC continued for almost a year.|$|E

Krone specifically praised the Jim and Pam subplot and Dwight's character, adding, [...] "It's a pretty perfect way to unwind – or, if <b>your</b> <b>team</b> lost, to become reanimated – after the Super Bowl." [...] Rick Ingebritson of The Palm Beach Post said the episode [...] "was funny from start to finish", particularly praising Dwight Schrute's role and the Michael Scott roast. However, Ingebritson said he was disgusted by the Leachman nude scene from Mrs. Albert Hannaday. Will Leitch of New York magazine, said the episode was funny, but [...] "curiously unfocused [...] two half-hour episodes awkwardly spliced together. He praised the Black/Leachman film, the trouble Dwight kept getting in, and the Jim and Pam subplot, which he called [...] "a rare Pam-Jim plot point that worked". However, he called the Michael roast [...] "yet another Michael-wanting-to-be-loved-and-still-be-the-Boss subplot that takes over the second half".|$|E
500|$|Mass Effect 2 was {{developed}} by BioWare and directed by Casey Hudson, who previously led {{the production of the}} first Mass Effect game. Before actual production began, BioWare created a list of goals to work towards based on feedback from fans, reviewers and internal people. The company's main goal was to [...] "create an experience that was less about being a game and more about being an experience." [...] In contrast to the exclusive focus on the main story of the original Mass Effect, Hudson explained that BioWare was interested in a plot where optional stories had as much intensity as the main story and decided that the idea of recruiting people and making them loyal to the player so that they could survive a suicide mission allowed to explore these possibilities. He noted, [...] "the funny thing is that people will say 'other than gathering your crew and building <b>your</b> <b>team</b> and getting ready for this mission, there's not much story there.'

500|$|England {{eventually}} won by 338 runs; Larwood's {{total of}} seven wickets in the match was exceeded by Allen's eight, earned by orthodox style fast bowling. While {{the game was}} still in progress, the Australian Board of Control cabled the MCC, protesting the English tactics with a direct accusation of unsportsmanlike conduct. In reply, MCC rejected the Australian Board's charges and insisted that they withdraw the charge of bad sportsmanship. The row escalated into high diplomatic and political circles, and drew in the Australian prime minister, Joseph Lyons, the governor of South Australia, Sir Alexander Hore-Ruthven, and the British Dominions secretary, J.H. Thomas. Ultimately {{it was decided that}} the matter should be referred to the Imperial Cricket Conference (ICC), with a view to a possible change in the rules relating to bowling. Jardine had stated that he would not lead his team in another Test unless the [...] "unsportsmanlike" [...] charge was withdrawn.

500|$|The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) {{announced}} in September 2009 that it [...] " [...] to prioritise" [...] and {{would most likely}} be sending a weakened squad to tour Bangladesh. The press theorised that possible candidates to be rested included captain Andrew Strauss, Paul Collingwood, Stuart Broad and James Anderson. When the squad was officially {{announced in}} January 2010, only Strauss and Anderson were omitted from the touring squad. The reason given for Anderson's break was to give him opportunity to undergo a specialist review and rehabilitation for a chronic injury to his right knee, to enable {{him to return to}} full fitness for the 2010 ICC World Twenty20. The decision to rest Strauss was rationalised by national selector Geoff Miller as [...] "the selectors feel it is important that he takes a break ahead of an extremely busy programme of international cricket". This decision was not universally accepted, with former England captains Ian Botham and Michael Atherton among those who spoke out against the move; Botham claimed: [...] "As captain you need to be there with <b>your</b> <b>team</b> ...

500|$|By 1949, Van Buren's {{annual salary}} was $15,000. Despite the Eagles {{franchise}} struggling financially the previous season, Neale {{was willing to}} pay him more, but Van Buren declined. [...] "I could have gotten a good deal more," [...] he said. [...] "But you acted a little different when <b>your</b> <b>team</b> lost money." [...] He came into his sixth NFL season needing 104 rushing yards to break Clarke Hinkle's career record of 3,860, which he set after ten seasons with the Packers. Van Buren passed Hinkle's mark against the Detroit Lions in the second game of the season, {{and by the end of}} the year had broken his own single-season record as he rushed for 1,146 yards. He became the first running back in NFL history to achieve three consecutive rushing titles. Jim Brown twice, Earl Campbell, and Emmitt Smith have since managed the feat. The Eagles clinched the Eastern Division title in the tenth game of the season with a win over the Steelers. With Pittsburgh's defense designed to stop him, Van Buren ran for 205 yards on 27 carries, setting an Eagles single-game franchise record for rushing yards that stood for over sixty years. The Eagles won their final two games and advanced to their third NFL championship game in as many seasons.|$|E

He had a strong start to the season recording seventeen disposals, seven marks and three goals in the club's twenty-six point win against Gold Coast at the MCG in round one and was named in Melbourne's best players by AFL Media. After a buoyant start to the season, he quickly found himself facing negativity from the media after the round three loss to Adelaide at the Adelaide Oval where he dropped two marks in quick succession, with one leading to an Adelaide goal. Multiple media figures called {{for him to be}} dropped with David Schwarz stating he [...] "might have to sit out a week" [...] and Dermott Brereton professing [...] "you have to make a stand as to what <b>your</b> <b>team</b> stands for, and that means you can't bring him back in until you are convinced he will not do that again"; Jason Dunstall supplemented these statements by noting [...] "he can't relapse into these kind of performances", adding [...] "I don't like using the word, but he looked a little soft at times".|$|E

It introduces themes referenced on the majority of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, including comments on decadence and hedonism, with West musing how [...] "the plan was to drink until the pain was over / but what’s worse, the pain or the hangover?". His lyrics on the track contain numerous musical and cultural references, including those to the song [...] "Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)", the Lamborghini Murciélago sports car, rapper Nas, fashion designer Phoebe Philo, short story [...] "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow", the band the Kings Of Leon and their song [...] "Sex on Fire", singers Celine Dion and Leona Lewis, and television character Steve Urkel.

500|$|Playing {{the final}} year of his {{contract}} in 2012–13 and with the team languishing {{near the bottom of the}} NHL standings, speculation about Iginla's future in Calgary was again raised as April 3, 2013, trade deadline neared. National media outlets reported that Iginla, who had a clause in his contract preventing the Flames from moving him to another team without his permission, had given the organization a list of four teams he would be willing to accept a trade with: the Chicago Blackhawks, Los Angeles Kings, Boston Bruins or Pittsburgh Penguins. The Bruins were considered the leading contender to acquire Iginla's services, and after he was held out of the line-up of Calgary's March 27, 2013, game against the Colorado Avalanche, it was reported that a trade between the two teams had been completed. Instead, Iginla's 16-year career in Calgary ended when he was sent to the Penguins in exchange for Pittsburgh's first round selection at the 2013 NHL Entry Draft and college prospects Kenny Agostino and Ben Hanowski. Iginla stated that playing with Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin played a factor in his decision to move to the Penguins. The Bruins and Penguins met in the 2013 Eastern Conference Finals. Despite having the top scoring offence in the league, the Penguins lost the series without winning a game. Iginla, along with Crosby, Malkin, James Neal and Kris Letang, registered a combined 0 points in the series. Iginla was moved to the third line after a 6–1 Game2 loss. Bruins forward Milan Lucic said after the series that Iginla's spurning of Boston ignited the series sweep: [...] "When a guy chooses another team over <b>your</b> <b>team,</b> it does light a little bit of a fire underneath you." ...|$|E
