This an illusion, of course. Canvas rots. Paint changes color. But you keep trying to freeze the world as if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> last forever. In a sense, what I've tried to capture is the reality of flux, to keep art an open, incomplete situation, to get at the rapture of seeing." ...|$|E

6000|$|Winston {{looked at}} Courthorne, but the latter smiled. [...] "The visit {{has nothing to}} do with me.

'I think, my dears,' {{observed}} the cherub, 'that if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> convenient to sit {{one on one}} side of me, and the other on the other, we should get on rather more consecutively, and make things rather plainer.

5000|$|The L85A1 was {{improved}} in 1997 after constant complaints from the troops. The main problems were difficult maintenance and low reliability. These problems led British troops to nickname the weapon the [...] "civil servant", as, in their estimation, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> not <b>make</b> <b>it</b> work and <b>could</b> not fire it. Improvements were made during 2000 - 2002 when 200,000 {{of the existing}} 320,000 L85A1 Automatic Rifles were upgraded.

No, {{you shall}} send it to Hartfield, if you please. But then, Mrs. Goddard will want to see it.--And I could take the pattern gown home any day. But I shall want the ribbon directly--so it had better go to Hartfield--at least the ribbon. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> into two parcels, Mrs. Ford, could not you?" ...|$|E

60|$|Do {{you think}} that a very {{interesting}} supplementary exhibition might be got up, say at Trafalgar Square, and retained there?--Yes, and all the more useful because you would put few works, and <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> complete in series--and because, on a small scale, you would have the entire series.

I should be glad, Lestrade, if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> convenient to meet us at Baker Street at six o'clock this evening.

Turn all the Bellevue patients and the barbers' convention and the Tuskegee school loose in the streets, and run the thermometer up to 120 in the shade.

60|$|TARLETON. [manipulating the syphon] Whats the use {{of telling}} {{children}} to read the Bible when you know they wont.

Better than most halfpenny papers, anyhow, if only <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> people believe <b>it.</b> [He sits down by the writing-table, near his wife].

60|$|Breakfast was difficult, but not impossible. Mr. Pope loomed like a thundercloud, but Marjorie pleaded a {{headache}} very wisely, {{and was taken}} a sympathetic cup of tea. The pseudo-twins scented trouble, but Theodore was heedless and over-full of an entertaining noise made by a moorhen as it dived in the ornamental water that morning. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> practically sotto voce, and it amused Syd. He seemed to think the Times opaque to such small sounds, and learnt better only to be dismissed underfed and ignominiously from the table to meditate upon the imperfections of his soul in the schoolroom.

30|$|The {{notion of}} {{vocational}} schooling as safety valve or sinkhole {{has been discussed}} in previous literature. Arum and Shavit ([2]) consider whether vocational schooling in the United States “is simply the crude mechanism of social exclusion” (i.e., a sinkhole), but conclude that “vocational education is a safety net that {{reduces the risk of}} falling {{to the bottom of the}} labor queue” (p. 187). For South Africa, Needham and Papier ([32]) refer to a stigma attached to vocational schooling, and the common perception that it is a sinkhole: “Some school [general education] students saw FET college [Further Education and Training, or vocational secondary] education as a second choice education that would result in low-paying jobs with no career prospects” (p. 36). They also reference vocational schooling’s safety valve role, citing qualitative evidence of poor previous schooling outcomes among vocational students: “[S]tudents viewed vocational education, particularly FET colleges, as second chance programmes that you went to if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> not <b>make</b> <b>it</b> at [traditional] school” (p. 37) 3. This paper contributes to the literature by formalizing the safety valve and sinkhole concepts in a human capital investment model, documenting the patterns of differential selection into vocational and academic schooling in South Africa, and estimating the wage and employment returns to each type of schooling. These returns estimates, while observational in nature, use high-quality panel data that include complete schooling histories, measures of ability, and actual (rather than potential) work experience, allowing for bias reductions relative to similar estimates from a census or labor force survey.|$|R
