But after you got one, <b>you</b> <b>began</b> to gnaw a crust of bread. It {{was not long before}} another came pop. At ten months you had four pretty white teeth, and you used to bite me. Poor mamma! Still I did not cry, because I am not a child, but you hurt me very much. So I said to papa, it is time the little girl should eat. She is not naughty, yet she hurts me. I have given her a crust of bread, and I must look for some other milk.|$|E

In March 1994, she released Amor Prohibido; in interviews {{she said her}} English-language album was still being developed. Recording sessions for Dreaming of <b>You</b> <b>began</b> in December 1994; Selena recorded four tracks slated for the album.

500|$|... "Secrets That I Never Want to Know" [...] {{was written}} by {{executive}} producer Bob Daily and directed by David Grossman. Filming for the episode began on July 11, 2011. The episode {{is only one of}} two season premieres Cherry did not write himself, as he took on a reduced production role for the eighth season in order to develop several new series while Daily was given more creative authority. According to Daily, the series' ending allowed the writers more artistic freedom while developing storylines. [...] "You get to do story lines that you wouldn't otherwise do because you don't {{have to worry about the}} ramifications," [...] he explained. [...] "So people can move, people can die, people can have babies and you don't have to worry about the babies growing up." [...] The episode introduced Bree's blackmail storyline, which recalls the first season's mystery storyline surrounding series narrator Mary Alice's suicide. Daily stated that the similarity between the storylines was intentional: [...] "We’re kind of just diving into the DNA of the series a little bit. Are there any unanswered questions floating around out there? Any characters we need to check in with one more time?" [...] Cherry noted that the [...] "mystery hearkens back to the first season, going back to the roots of Mary Alice [...] This feels right for that mystery to take us out this year." [...] Brenda Strong commented that [...] "It’s the smartest way to end the series, to finish where <b>you</b> <b>began.</b> I think it really cements it in the psyche of the audience and gives them a sense of completion." ...|$|E

2500|$|But Martin {{himself had}} not hesitated to wield {{military}} power against the Cherokees, {{especially when they}} killed several colonists at the instigation of Loyalist and English agents during the Revolution. In 1781, following a running battle between Indian forces {{and those of the}} colonists, Colonel Arthur Campbell, Lieutenant Colonel John Sevier and Martin addressed a letter to the Indian chiefs, warning them about their actions. [...] "You know <b>you</b> <b>began</b> the war," [...] the bulletin began, [...] "by listening to the bad councils of the King of England and the falsehoods told you by his agents." [...] Further hostilities, the three colonial leaders warned, would result in a military campaign against the Indian villages. Seven years later, in 1788, Martin again fought the Overmountain Cherokee, as well as the Chickamauga Cherokee, in a battle at Lookout Mountain, during the Cherokee–American wars.|$|E
2500|$|His {{breakthrough}} as {{a television}} performer came in 1988 with Channel 4's improvised comedy show Whose Line Is It Anyway?, which moved to TV from BBC Radio 4, though he had previously performed on the channel's Saturday Live and compered its series Comedy Wavelength in 1987. He remained on Whose Line until 1993. Have I Got News for <b>You</b> <b>began</b> in 1990, and two series of his own sketch show, , followed soon after. [...] In 1995 he presented a documentary series celebrating {{the history of the}} London Palladium, entitled Paul Merton's Palladium Story. In 1996, Merton performed updated versions of fifteen of Ray Galton and Alan Simpson's old scripts for an ITV series, Paul Merton in Galton & Simpson's…. Six of these scripts were previously performed by Tony Hancock. These were very badly received by critics, and although a selection of episodes was initially released on VHS, it was not until June 2007 that the complete series was released on DVD.|$|E

2500|$|In April 2015, {{during a}} video conference {{to promote the}} {{documentary}} Terminal F about Edward Snowden, Bolivia's ambassador to Russia, María Luisa Ramos Urzagaste, accused Assange of putting the life of Bolivian president Evo Morales at risk by intentionally providing the United States with false rumours that Snowden was on the president's plane when it was forced to land in Vienna in July 2013. [...] "It is possible that in this wide-ranging game that <b>you</b> <b>began</b> my president did not play a crucial role, but what you did was not important to my president, but it was to me and the citizens of our country. And I have faith that when you planned this game you took into consideration the consequences", the ambassador told Assange. Assange stated that the plan [...] "was not completely honest, but we did consider that the final result would have justified our actions. We weren't expecting this outcome. The result {{was caused by the}} United States' intervention. We can only regret what happened." [...] Later, in an interview with Democracy Now!, Assange explained the story of the grounding of Morales' plane, saying that after the United States cancelled Snowden's passport, WikiLeaks thought about other strategies to take him to Latin America, and they considered private presidential jets of those countries which offered support. The appointed jet was that of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, but Assange stated that [...] "our code language that we used deliberately swapped the presidential jet that we were considering for the Bolivian jet [...] and in some of our communications, we deliberately spoke about that on open lines to lawyers in the United States. And we didn’t think much more of it. [...] We didn’t think this was anything more than just distracting." [...] Eventually, the plan was not pursued and, under Assange's advice, Snowden sought asylum in Russia.|$|E
