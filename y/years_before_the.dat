5|$|A {{subsequent}} {{investigation by}} the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) confirmed the aircraft had impacted birds during take-off.

5|$|A {{thousand}} <b>years</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> {{events of}} the game, three entities known as the Warring Triad initiated a conflict that would {{come to be called}} the War of the Magi. This quarrel grew to catastrophic proportions, unleashing magical energy into the world which transformed afflicted humans into espers—magical beings who themselves were used as soldiers in the war. Eventually realizing the horrific calamity wrought by their hands, the Triad returned free will to the espers and sealed their own powers, becoming stone statues. Their only request was that the espers ensure their power remain locked away so it might never be used again. The espers carried their stone gods to a hidden land, sealing both the statues and themselves off from the realm of humans. The concept of magic gradually faded to legend and myth as mankind built a society extolling science and technology. At the game's opening, the most advanced nation is the Empire, a cruel and expanding dictatorship led by Emperor Gestahl and his clownish general Kefka Palazzo. Approximately eighteen <b>years</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> {{events of the}} game begin, the barrier between the espers' land {{and the rest of the}} world weakened. Soon after, Gestahl takes advantage of this and attacks the espers' land, capturing several of them.|$|E

5|$|According to the backstory {{provided}} by the play, Sycorax, while pregnant with Caliban, was banished {{from her home in}} Algiers to the island on which the play takes place.
