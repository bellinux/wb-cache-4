During the trial, it emerged that plans to kill Ogilby had been formulated by the UDA unit several months before her kangaroo court [...] "trial". Douglas was lambasted by Justice McGonigle, [...] "You ordered and directed the punishment of this girl. You chose and chose well those who were to carry out your directions. When <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>what</b> had happened you organised the cover-up and disposal of the body. Your concern was that these happenings should not come to light. You were the commander of these women; your responsibility was great. You are no stranger to crime. You have a record of smuggling, forgery, assault and actual bodily harm and aiding and abetting the keeping of a brothel. Though the last of these was in 1961 it is an indication of your character." [...] The Northern Irish press dubbed Elizabeth Douglas [...] "the Sandy Row executioner".|$|E

60|$|I {{doubt whether}} Sir Damask {{would have said}} a word about it to his wife as he was {{dressing}} for dinner, had he calculated what might be the result to himself. But he came home open-mouthed, and made no calculation. 'Have <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>what's</b> up, Ju?' he said, rushing half-dressed into his wife's room.|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear, I {{think you}} had better say nothing further about it. If you cannot bring {{yourself}} at the present moment to promise that there shall be an end of it, you had better hold your tongue. <b>You</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>what</b> I say, and <b>you</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>what</b> mamma says. I do not for a moment suppose that you dream of carrying on a communication with this gentleman in opposition to our wishes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have said}} that you {{recognized}} them as being the voices of angels the third time that <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> them. <b>What</b> angels were they?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Then, since <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>what</b> Sproatly said, {{you would}} be willing to do {{anything}} that appeared possible to prevent Gregory throwing Harry's dollars away?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I'm {{glad to hear}} it,' {{replied the}} ogre, 'but words are women, deeds are men. <b>You</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>what</b> I said, and forewarned is forearmed.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hey <b>you</b> ever <b>heard</b> <b>WHAT</b> {{the highest}} {{watermark}} was?" [...] {{said the first}} speaker, turning to another of the loungers without looking at the secretary.|$|R

6000|$|... "Certainly {{you ought}} not, Ciceley. If <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>what</b> {{you were not}} meant to hear, you ought never {{to say a word}} about it to anyone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You couldn't {{have done}} {{anything}} if you'd been here. <b>You</b> <b>heard</b> <b>what</b> the woman said. If Margaret died of heart disease, your suspicions were quite without ground.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Have <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>what</b> {{that fellow}} {{has been saying}} to me?" [...] demanded Miss Cringle, with a spice of the old temper {{leavening}} her voice once more.|$|E
6000|$|Later {{in the day}} Sam, the turf-cutter, entered. [...] "I've come a-borrowing, Mrs. Yeobright. I suppose <b>you</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>what's</b> been {{happening}} to the beauty on the hill?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Nope. I'm goin'. <b>You</b> <b>heard</b> <b>what</b> Benson told me. Alloway wouldn't give me {{the benefit}} of any doubts. Buck, a last word--look out fer thet Bland woman!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So you {{are really}} there, Sobber," [...] put in Dick. [...] "I thought as much. Well, <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>what</b> I said to Crabtree. It applies to you as well." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You're wise," [...] Frobisher agreed. Then {{his eyes}} twinkled. [...] "Carnally, however, {{seems to have}} seen {{a way out of}} the difficulty. <b>You</b> haven't <b>heard</b> <b>what</b> {{happened}} at the settlement?" ...|$|R

6000|$|MAGGIE. <b>You</b> <b>heard</b> <b>what</b> he said, John. It's the combination. Is it {{so terrible}} {{to you to}} find that my love for you had made me {{able to help you}} in the little things? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That, my dear,' said Aunt Polly, 'is {{because you}} do not {{interest}} yourself about such matters. If <b>you</b> had <b>heard</b> <b>what</b> the Archdeacon said of him the other day, you would think differently.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Mother, I must. <b>You</b> <b>heard</b> <b>what</b> Captain Keith said. Let that comfort you. It {{would be}} brutal cruelty and cowardice {{to stay away}} from her to night. Good night, Grace, make mother see that it must be so." ...|$|E
