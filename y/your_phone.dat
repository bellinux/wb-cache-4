[...] Dylan's Super Bowl commercial generated controversy and op-ed pieces discussing the protectionist implications of his words, and whether the singer had [...] "sold out" [...] to corporate interests.|$|E
500|$|The lyrics {{begin with}} a promise of {{protection}} and caretaking: [...] "You'll be given love / You'll {{be taken care of}} / You'll have to trust it".

[...] On August 9, 2005 the Presnensky Court of Moscow ruled against Bay, although she did attempt to appeal the result. One Russian physicist said that the impact had no effect on Earth and [...] "the change to the orbit of the comet after the collision was only about 10cm (3.9in)." ...|$|E

2500|$|Several {{publications}} and analysts predicted {{the failure of}} Apple Stores. It was thought {{that because of the}} stores' diminutive size and non-aggressive sales team, Apple would succeed in presenting the Mac but fail in making a significant number of sales. However, the Apple retail program established its merits, bypassing the sales-per-square-foot measurement of competing nearby stores, and in 2004 reached $1 billion in annual sales, the fastest of any retailer in history. Sales continued to grow, reaching $1 billion a quarter by 2006. Then-CEO Steve Jobs said that [...] "People haven't been willing to invest this much time and money or engineering in a store before", adding that [...] "It's not important if the customer knows that. They just feel it. They feel something's a little different." [...] In 2011, Apple Stores in the United States had an average revenue of $473,000 for each employee. According to the research firm RetailSails, the Apple Store chain ranked first among U.S. retailers in terms of sales per unit area in 2011, with sales of $3,085per square feet, almost doubling Tiffany & Co., the second retailer on the list. On a global level, all Apple Stores had a combined revenue of US$16billion. Under the leadership of Ron Johnson, the former senior Vice President of Retail Operations, the Apple Stores have, according to an article in The New York Times, been responsible for [...] " [...] the boring computer sales floor into a sleek playroom filled with gadgets". The Apple Stores have also been credited with raising the company's brand equity, with Scott Galloway stating that the Stores are the [...] "temple to the brand which is this unbelievable experience called an Apple Store, and then you have this very mediocre experience called an AT or Verizon connect <b>your</b> <b>phone</b> experience for Samsung and the other Android players".|$|E
