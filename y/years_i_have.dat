5|$|Over the <b>years</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{found that}} it is {{difficult}} if not impossible to bring to consciousness of another person the nature of his tacit assumptions when, by some special experiences, I have been made aware of them. This became painfully evident to me in my attempts during the 1950s to convince geneticists that the action of genes had to be and was controlled. It is now equally painful to recognize the fixity of assumptions that many persons hold on the nature of controlling elements in maize and the manners of their operation. One must await the right time for conceptual change.|$|E
25|$|In {{the whole}} of the ten <b>years</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been working on radio and television, I have been working to a {{majority}} of women. I think women prefer men to be well-mannered, so I always try to watch my manners. They like men to be well dressed, so I do my best to observe this. Others bring to my notice the fact that I sometimes make grammatical errors in my speech; so, because of this, I try to watch my grammar – {{but at the same time}} I bear in mind that it's more profitable for me to be entertaining than to be perfect in my use of English.|$|E

500|$|Film critics Roger Ebert and Richard Roeper {{gave the}} film [...] "two thumbs up". Ebert said, [...] "In 39 <b>years,</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> never written these {{words in a}} movie review, but here they are: You owe it to {{yourself}} to see this film. If you do not, and you have grandchildren, you should explain to them why you decided not to," [...] calling the film [...] "horrifying, enthralling and [...] the potential, I believe, to actually change public policy and begin a process which could save the Earth." ...|$|E
500|$|Morgan met {{his first}} wife in Kent in the early 1980s. They married in 1982, but he left her when she became {{pregnant}} with twins. He met another woman after moving to Dorset. She also became pregnant, giving birth to a son, and they married in 1994, after living together for several years. Morgan {{had a reputation as}} a womaniser, seducing customers while working as an engineer. He continued this activity after becoming a lorry driver. Following Morgan's conviction, brother Ray Morgan said, [...] "He has had so many affairs over the <b>years</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> lost count." [...] He also had a violent temper. One friend, Dave Moemken, described him as being [...] "on a short fuse".|$|E

She acts as a spokeswoman for Avon's cosmetic products and serves as the honorary chair of the Avon Foundation, a charitable organization that supports women and focuses on breast cancer research and the prevention of domestic violence. Witherspoon is also committed to participating in cosmetics product development and appearing in commercial advertisements.

500|$|When {{asked why}} he had not asked Meckiff to bowl {{at the other end}} to gauge the {{judgment}} of the other umpire, Lou Rowan, Benaud replied [...] "over the <b>years</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> always accepted the umpire's decision". The Australian captain was criticised for being acquiescent, and one of his predecessors Lindsay Hassett believed Meckiff should have been used at reduced speed. Rowan later indicated his concurrence with Egar, writing in his book The Umpire's Story, [...] "There is nothing I can now say that will alter the opinions already expressed that his [...] delivery was unfair". For his part, Meckiff said: [...] "the game is bigger than the individual" [...] and he backed Benaud's decision because doing otherwise [...] "could only have added fuel to the controversy".|$|E
500|$|The {{opening track}} on the album, [...] "Con los Años Que Me Quedan" [...] ("With the <b>Years</b> <b>I</b> <b>Have</b> Left"), is a Cuban bolero song. Three other bolero tracks on Mi Tierra are [...] "Mi Buen Amor" [...] ("My True Love"), [...] "Volverás" [...] ("You'll Be Back"), and [...] "Hablas de Mí" [...] ("You're Talking About Me"). The title track details {{the passion of}} Estefan's {{homeland}} in a salsa arrangement. In [...] "Ayer" [...] ("Yesterday") the singer finds a flower given to her by a lover and yearns for him to return, since life is short. Its music combines bolero and son music. [...] "No Hay Mal Que Por Bien No Bien" [...] ("Out of All Bad, Some Good Things Come") is a danzón recalling a brief love affair.|$|E
500|$|The Dalai Lama, who had {{recently}} visited Chennai, expressed sadness at the unprecedented destruction and the disruption of normal life, and expressed his sympathy with {{the thousands of people}} displaced by the flooding in Tamil Nadu.

500|$|Brownlee denied {{absolutely}} MacMillan's claims. [...] He {{said that}} there had been no sexual activity between him and MacMillan, likening their relationship instead to that of an uncle and his favourite niece. [...] To claims that he had induced MacMillan to move to Edmonton and arranged a position for her in the Attorney General's office, he asserted [...] "in the thirteen <b>years</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been in public life I have never promised any person in this Province a position." [...] He denied having convinced MacMillan to move to Edmonton and stated that he had not even known that she had done so until Christopher Pattinson, Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) for Edson, told him. [...] He further claimed that his sex life with Mrs. Brownlee was what he would consider normal for a husband and wife (which was corroborated by his wife).|$|E
500|$|In {{preparation}} for the 2008 U.S. Olympic Trials, Tarwater trained at Michigan with Phelps, Peter Vanderkaay, and Erik Vendt, coached by Bowman and Urbanchekf. Shortly before the trials, he went the Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs, Colorado to train at altitude. [...] "I'm better mentally than I've ever been," [...] Tarwater said of his preparation. [...] "Physically I'm stronger than four years ago." [...] He entered the Trials as the number two seed in the 200-meter butterfly and was widely expected to make the U.S. Olympic team as the second qualifier behind Phelps. [...] "For the last two <b>years</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> completely put everything in my life aside {{to try to make}} [...] dream come true," [...] he told a reporter. He also entered the trials as the fourth seed in the 100-meter butterfly and qualified for the 100- and 200-meter freestyle.|$|E
500|$|In July 2011, Horsfield {{stepped down}} as {{assistant}} manager to concentrate on his coaching qualifications, remaining at Port Vale as a coach. Later in the month he scored in a friendly against Stone Dominoes, but dismissed speculation {{that he would make}} a return to the playing side of the game. In December 2011, loan striker Guy Madjo celebrated his first goal for the club by running over to Horsfield on the touchline, [...] "to say thank you for all the finishing (practice) that we have been doing. He has shown me {{a lot of things that}} I haven't done in the past. In seven <b>years,</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been so many places, to so many clubs and I haven't done that with anyone else, so I just feel it was a good dedication for him." [...] Horsfield retired completely from football in May 2012 to pursue business interests.|$|E

500|$|Having won both races, Biden made a {{point of}} holding off his {{resignation}} from the Senate so that he could be sworn in for his seventh term on January 6, 2009. [...] He became the youngest senator ever to start a seventh full term, and said, [...] "In all my life, the greatest honor bestowed upon me has been serving the people of Delaware as their United States senator." [...] Biden cast his last Senate vote on January 15, supporting the release of the second $350billion for the Troubled Asset Relief Program. [...] Biden resigned from the Senate later that day; in emotional farewell remarks on the Senate floor, where he had spent most of his adult life, Biden said, [...] "Every good thing I have seen happen here, every bold step taken in the 36-plus <b>years</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been here, came not from the application of pressure by interest groups, but through the maturation of personal relationships." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2002, West became {{general manager}} of the Memphis Grizzlies. He {{explained}} his decision with the desire for exploring something new: [...] "After being a part of the Lakers success for so many <b>years,</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> always wondered how it would be to build a winning franchise that has not experienced much success. I want to help make a difference." [...] West's Memphis stint was not as spectacular as his Los Angeles stint, but he turned a franchise which was about to be sold into a reliable playoffs team, practically making no trades but getting the maximum from the players he had available (e.g. Pau Gasol, James Posey and Jason Williams) and signing coach Hubie Brown, who became Coach of the Year in 2004. West himself won his second NBA Executive of the Year Award in the same year. At age 69, West retired as a Grizzlies general manager in 2007 and turned over managing duties to Chris Wallace, from Buckhannon, West Virginia.|$|E
500|$|Bellew's {{successor}} as Garter, Sir Anthony Wagner, {{referred to}} him in his 1988 memoirs; he wrote that Bellew seemed [...] "in early years a temperamental, combative Irishman not easy to live with though always possessed of great feeling for ceremonial and heraldic design and a skillful pen and pencil. In later <b>years</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> found him ever more charming". According to The Independent, Bellew enjoyed creating colourful grants of arms, drew inspiration from medieval heraldry and allowed multi-coloured wreaths to be used and adorned with badges {{for the first time}} in English heraldry. As Garter, he managed the financial affairs of the College well, maintaining [...] "a firm hand on the tiller", and, when faced with the task of organising the Coronation, his knowledge of tradition was complemented by his eye for design: [...] "At heart he was a designer, an artist and a perfectionist in all things", remarks his obituary in The Times.|$|E

500|$|... 2001: A Space Odyssey is now {{considered}} one of the major artistic works of the 20th century, with many critics and filmmakers considering it Kubrick's masterpiece. Director Martin Scorsese has listed it as one of his favourite films of all time. In the 1980s, critic David Denby compared Kubrick to the monolith from 2001: A Space Odyssey, calling him [...] "a force of supernatural intelligence, appearing at great intervals amid high-pitched shrieks, who gives the world a violent kick up the next rung of the evolutionary ladder". Poet and critic Dan Schneider wrote that 2001: A Space Odyssey [...] "has one of the greatest screenplays ever penned", countering accusations of the film's coldness by saying, [...] "I recall the HAL ‘death scene’ {{as one of the few}} filmic moments to ever cause me to tear up in sadness. [...] And, in the intervening <b>years,</b> <b>I</b> <b>have,</b> in film talks, found that the same scene caused the same emotional reaction in many other viewers. I was not alone. Any film that can both enhance one’s consciousness and touch one’s emotions, simultaneously, evinces greatness." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{title of}} the song comes from an epitaph on a plaque at Eva Perón's grave in the La Recoleta Cemetery in Buenos Aires. The plaque was {{presented}} by the city's taxi drivers' union and roughly translates as: [...] "Don't cry for me Argentina, I remain quite near to you." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote [...] "For <b>years</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> wondered, during 'Don't Cry for Me, Argentina,' why we were not to cry. Now I understand: We need not cry because (a) Evita got everything out of life she dreamed of, and (b) Argentina should cry for itself. Even poor Juan Peron [...] should shed a tear or two; he is relegated...to {{the status of a}} 'walker,' a presentable man who adorns the arm of a rich and powerful woman as a human fashion accessory." [...] The song's lyrics are a [...] "string of meaningless platitudes" [...] according to Rice, who felt that it worked as an emotionally intense but empty speech by a [...] "megalomaniac woman" [...] trying to win the favor of the Argentines. It features the lyrics [...] "And as for fortune, and as for fame / I never invited them in / Though it seemed to the world they were all I desired / They are illusions".|$|E
500|$|After the {{parliamentary}} party agreed {{on this issue}} 12–8, Hall resigned the leadership on 16 March 1972, stating that [...] "I cannot continue to lead a Party that will not follow; I cannot lead a Party which has lost its idealism and which has forgotten that its purpose for existence is to govern successfully {{for the welfare of}} all South Australians. Our Party is still deeply cleft by the persuasive influence of a number of its members in the Legislative Council." [...] Later in the speech, he said [...] "Over the last three <b>years</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been subject to a great deal of disloyalty on a continuing basis ... I had hoped this afternoon to move a motion of no confidence in the Government; instead, I found out Party had moved a vote of no confidence in itself." [...] Premier Dunstan, with whom Hall had never had amiable relations, crossed {{the floor of the house}} and shook Hall's hand in a gesture of solidarity. Hall said he [...] "was knifed" [...] and said the conservatives' actions were [...] "a clear example of how deeply the wooden horses of the Legislative Council have entrenched themselves in the ranks of the Assembly membership". The LCL President Ian McLachlan put on a brave face, saying [...] "Mr Hall had some personal problems with the party, but these differences do not make a divided party" [...] but he was quoted the next day as saying that the proposal was mooted to gauge Hall's power. The obscure and low-key conservative Bruce Eastick was installed as the new leader, as some more prominent figures such as Millhouse were seen as too sympathetic to Hall. In the meantime, there was a strong reaction to Hall's departure among the public, and segments of the LCL, notably the youth wings, demonstrated against the events and made motions of objection. Hall had expected to become a normal backbencher, but the groundswell of support prompted a change of heart.|$|E
