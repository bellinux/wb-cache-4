5|$|After the war, of course, {{the roads}} were all bad. There were cobbles from the moment you left Paris, or Senlis where we started in those days. There'd be {{stretches}} of surfaced roads and often there'd be a cycle path or a pavement and sometimes a thin stretch of something smoother. But <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> where was best to ride and you were for ever switching about. You could jump your bike up on to a pavement but that got harder the more tired you got. Then you'd get your front wheel up but not your back wheel. That happened to me. And then you'd go sprawling, of course, and you could bring other riders down. Or they'd fall off and bring you down with them. And the cycle paths were often just compressed cinders, which got soft {{in the rain and}} got churned up by so many riders using them and then you got stuck and you lost your balance. And come what may, you got covered in coal dust and other muck. No, it's all changed and you can't compare then and now.|$|E

500|$|Andy Battaglia {{compared}} {{the feeling of}} the music to the online virtual world Second Life, the city-building game SimCity, and the work of experimental filmmaker Ryan Trecartin. Adam Harper of Dummy called it a [...] "pastiche [...] a kind of music <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> you knew existed: techno-capitalist stock promotional music for the era of the personal computer ... Each track is bristling with the maximalist promise of a world of possibilities waiting behind the screen for your double-click, and evokes a time when we were much less familiar with and cynical about the virtual world technology has brought us into." ...|$|E
500|$|... "True North" [...] was co-written by co-executive {{producers}} David H. Goodman and Liz Tigelaar, {{while being}} directed by The Shield veteran Dean White. In {{an interview with}} Comic Book Resources, co-creator Edward Kitsis noted {{that it was difficult}} to pick iconic stories such as Cinderella and Hansel and Gretel because [...] "the challenge becomes revealing a piece <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> before or putting a fun twist on it." [...] According to actress Jennifer Morrison, they chose this particular story as a way to further reveal Emma's history, as she lacked a fairytale counterpart. Morrison explained, [...] "They’re using Hansel and Gretel as they did Cinderella to reveal some of Emma’s backstory. So what Emma goes through to try to help these children ends up becoming very personal for her, as her own life [...] is in a sense revealed." ...|$|E
500|$|Presley's {{physical}} attractiveness {{and sexual}} appeal were widely acknowledged. [...] "He was once beautiful, astonishingly beautiful", {{in the words}} of critic Mark Feeney. Television director Steve Binder, no fan of Presley's music before he oversaw the '68 Comeback Special, reported, [...] "I'm straight as an arrow and I got to tell you, you stop, whether you're male or female, to look at him. He was that good looking. And if <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> he was a superstar, it wouldn't make any difference; if he'd walked in the room, you'd know somebody special was in your presence." [...] His performance style, as much as his physical beauty, was responsible for Presley's eroticized image. Writing in 1970, critic George Melly described him as [...] "the master of the sexual simile, treating his guitar as both phallus and girl." [...] In his Presley obituary, Lester Bangs credited him as [...] "the man who brought overt blatant vulgar sexual frenzy to the popular arts in America." [...] Ed Sullivan's declaration that he perceived a soda bottle in Presley's trousers was echoed by rumors involving a similarly positioned toilet roll tube or lead bar.|$|E

500|$|The Green Goblin {{debuted in}} The Amazing Spider-Man #14. At this time his {{identity}} was unknown, but he proved popular and reappeared in later issues, which {{made a point}} of his secret identity. According to both Stan Lee and John Romita, Sr., who replaced Ditko as the title's artist, Lee always wanted the Green Goblin to be someone Peter Parker knew, while Ditko wanted his civilian identity to be someone who hadn't yet been introduced. Lee elaborated: [...] "Steve wanted him to turn out to be just some character that we had never seen before. Because, he said, in real life, very often a villain turns out to be somebody that <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>knew.</b> And I felt that that would be wrong. I felt, in a sense, it would be like cheating the reader. ... if it's somebody you didn't know and had never seen, then {{what was the point of}} following all the clues? I think that frustrates the reader." [...] However, Lee prefaced this statement by admitting that, due to his self-professed poor memory, he may have been confusing the Green Goblin with a different character, and in an earlier essay he had said that he could not remember whether Norman Osborn being the Green Goblin was his idea or Ditko's. Ditko has maintained that it was his idea, even claiming that he had decided on it before the first Green Goblin story was finished, and that a character he drew in the background of a single panel of Amazing Spider-Man #23 was meant to be Norman Osborn (who is not introduced until issue #37).|$|E

2500|$|Burgniard {{recalled}} that the hijackers, mostly Lotfi, {{did not like}} seeing a lack of adherence to their Islamic beliefs; according to Burgniard, the hijackers objected {{to men and women}} sitting together and sharing the same toilets and women having uncovered heads. Once they took control of the aircraft, the hijackers forced women with uncovered heads, including the cabin crew members, to cover their heads. Women who did not have veils used aircraft blankets to cover their heads. An elderly Algerian man told the TF1 network that the hijackers [...] "had a kind of art in their terror.

2500|$|Their live {{performances}} were notoriously hit-or-miss, and were usually far more rough-edged than their recordings; the Horrible Truth of their live album (The Horrible Truth About Burma) being an in-joke about their inconsistency. Boston critic Tristam Lozaw described Mission of Burma live: [...] "When they were good, {{they were very}} very good, but when they were bad they were horrid ... But that {{was the nature of}} the beast ... Because they took chances, <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> whether {{you were going to get}} one of the most spectacular experiences of your life or if it was going to be a ball of incomprehensible noise." [...] While the band's improvisational side and the unpredictable chaos of Swope's tape work contributed a little to this inconsistency, the two main factors were (as Lozaw implies) the live sound and the pacing and timing of their sets. When faced with a venue where the sound system or room acoustics weren't up to the task of conveying clarity along with the band's trademark volume, Swope always refused to compromise, and opted for volume. The band's set lists (composed by committee a few minutes before going on stage) could range from well-constructed to seemingly picked at random, and (aside from [...] "Secrets" [...] as a frequent opener and [...] "All World Cowboy Romance" [...] or a cover as an encore) there was a general reluctance to repeat any song placement or sequence that had worked in the past.|$|E
