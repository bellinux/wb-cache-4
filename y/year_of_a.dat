5|$|Use {{of the era}} {{name was}} {{formally}} adopted {{during the reign of}} Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141–87 BC), yet its origins can be traced back further. The oldest method of recording years—which had existed since the Shang—set the first <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> ruler's reign as year one. When an emperor died, the first <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new reign period would begin. This system was changed by the 4th century BC when the first <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new reign period did not begin until {{the first day of the}} lunar New Year following a ruler's death. When Duke Huiwen of Qin assumed the title of king in 324 BC, he changed the year count of his reign back to the first year. For his newly adopted calendar established in 163 BC, Emperor Wen of Han (r. 180–157 BC) also set the year count of his reign back to the beginning.|$|E
5|$|Charlotte's brother succeeded {{their father}} as Emperor Wilhelm II in 1888, {{increasing}} her social influence.

She became Duchess of Saxe-Meiningen in 1914, only for her husband to lose his title {{with the end of}} World War I in 1918. Charlotte died the following <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> heart attack in Baden-Baden. She had suffered from a lifetime of ill-health. Most historians now believe she had porphyria, a genetic disease that afflicted other members of the British Royal Family.|$|E

5|$|By 1910, the Regia Marina {{had decided}} {{to dispose of the}} {{obsolescent}} cruiser. Rumors that <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> potential sale to the Ecuadorian Navy prompted Peru to buy the old French cruiser , though Ecuador did not end up purchasing Umbria. Instead, in December 1910, the Regia Marina sold Umbria to the Haitian Navy, but she did not arrive in Port-de-Paix, Haiti, until 13 June 1911. After the sale, the ship was renamed Consul Gostrück. The ship was rumored to be carrying Cipriano Castro, the deposed president of Venezuela, though they later proved to be false. A German captain, Willy Meyer, was hired to take command of the ship upon its arrival in Haiti, but due to the lengthy delays, he quit. The cruiser sank shortly after entering service because her crew was not experienced in handling the ship. Umbria was eventually raised and towed to Rotterdam, the Netherlands, for disposal in 1913.|$|E
5|$|By early 1896, {{many in the}} Democratic Party were bitterly {{opposed to}} President Cleveland and his policies. The United States was by then in the third <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> deep recession, the Panic of 1893. Cleveland was a firm {{supporter}} of the gold standard, and soon after the recession began forced through repeal of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act, which he believed had helped cause it. Sherman's act, although not restoring bimetallism, had required the government to purchase and coin large quantities of silver bullion, and its repeal outraged supporters of free silver. Other Cleveland policies, such as his forcible suppression of the Pullman strike, led to the Democrats losing control of both houses of Congress in the 1894 midterm elections, and to a revolt against him by silver supporters within his party.|$|E

5|$|In {{the last}} 37seasons since Durocher, the Cubs have had 22 managers. Jim Frey and Don Zimmer {{led the team}} to the National League Championship Series (NLCS) in 1984 and 1989, respectively. In both of those seasons, the team's manager won a Manager of the Year Award. Jim Riggleman managed the team for five years from 1995 through 1999, earning the team's first and only wild card playoff spot in 1998. Dusty Baker's Cubs lost in the 2003 NLCS during the first <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{four-year}} managing tenure. Baker's successor, Lou Piniella, led the team to two consecutive National League Central Division titles during {{his first two years}} with the team and was awarded the 2008 Manager of the Year Award. On July 20, 2010, Piniella announced his intention to retire as manager of the Cubs following the end of the season. However, on August 22, 2010, Piniella announced he would resign after that day's game with the Atlanta Braves, citing family reasons. Third base coach Mike Quade would finish {{the rest of the season}} as manager. The Cubs' current general manager is Jed Hoyer, who replaced Jim Hendry.|$|E
5|$|Once {{passed by}} the Senate, a bill {{is sent to the}} House of Delegates for consideration. If the House also approves the bill without amendment, it is sent to the Governor. If there is amendment, however, the Senate may either reconsider the bill with {{amendments}} or ask {{for the establishment of a}} conference committee to work out differences in the versions of the bill passed by each chamber. Once a piece of legislation approved by both houses is forwarded to the Governor, it may either be signed or vetoed. If it is signed, it takes effect on the effective date of the legislation, usually October 1 of that year. If it is vetoed, both the Senate and the House of Delegates must vote by a three-fifths majority to overturn the veto. They may not, however, overturn a veto in the first <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new term, since the bill would have been passed during the previous session. Additionally, joint resolutions and the budget bill may not be vetoed, although the General Assembly is constitutionally limited in the extent to which it may influence the latter; it may only decrease the Governor's budget proposal, not increase it.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{begins in}} an {{abandoned}} warehouse, where Dean (Ackles) is attacked by the djinn that he is hunting. He suddenly finds himself {{in a world in}} which his mother (Smith) was not killed by the demon Azazel. He and his brother Sam (Jared Padalecki) were not raised to be hunters of supernatural creatures, but are no longer close, as Dean is irresponsible, disloyal, and drinks too much in this alternate reality; when a confused Dean calls him for help, Sam thinks that he is drunk. In the new reality, Dean is dating the beautiful Carmen (Michelle Borth), and Sam is at law school and engaged to Jessica (Palicki)another victim of Azazel. Although Dean enjoys his new life, a ghostly young woman seems to be haunting him and he is confronted by an image of corpses in his closet. He realizes that all the people that he and Sam had saved as hunters are now dead, that he and Sam have a distant and somewhat adversarial relationship. After visiting the grave of his father John, who died the previous <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> stroke, Dean decides that he must give up his new-found happiness to save them.|$|E

5|$|The {{trial of}} Pierre Frugoli and Lucien Mattei opened on 30 November 1987 in Pau, France. Mattei, {{who had been}} {{previously}} been released after serving one <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 20-year sentence for armed assault, retracted his previous confession. Frugoli, however, acknowledged that he had set out to kill ETA members. He stated {{that he had been}} recruited by members of the Spanish secret services, codenamed Francis and Miguel, in La Samaritaine bar in Marseilles port. With Mattei, he made several trips to San Sebastián to receive instructions for the attack, the last in the city's Orly Hotel three days before the attack. He claimed that Francis had offered him 100,000 francs for carrying out the attack and 50,000 more for each person killed. Francis then met them in Bayonne, supplying them with the weapons used in the attack and the identities of the desired targets.|$|E
5|$|The {{widespread}} Yellow Turban Rebellion {{also occurred}} in 184 CE, its leaders {{claiming that they}} were destined {{to bring about a}} utopian era of peace. Like the Five Pecks of Rice society, the Yellow Turbans of the Huai and Yellow River valleys also believed that illness was a sign of wrongdoing that necessitated confession to church leaders and faith healers. However, the Yellow Turbans typically utilized holy water as a ramification for sickness; if this did not cure the sick, the latter's sins were deemed too great to be exculpated. Since the year 184 CE was the first (and very auspicious) <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new sexagenary cycle, the Yellow Turban's supreme leader Zhang Jue (d. 184 CE) chose the third month of that year as the time to rebel; when this was leaked to the Han court, Zhang was forced to initiate the rebellion prematurely. Although the Yellow Turbans were able to muster hundreds of thousands of troops, they were overpowered by the combined force of imperial troops and independent generals. By {{the end of the year}} their leadership—including Zhang Jue—had been killed and only scattered groups remained until they were amalgamated into the forces of Cao Cao in 192 CE.|$|E
5|$|Tronstad {{spent the}} first <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{research}} period {{as an assistant to}} Herbert Freundlich in Dahlem, Berlin. He studied the passivity of metal surfaces, and made a breakthrough when he managed to measure extremely thin oxide surface coatings, thus solving a problem dating from the time of Michael Faraday. He continued to Stockholm to study metallography under Carl Benedicks, and to elaborate further on his results from Berlin. The work was completed in 1931 and his thesis, spanning 250 pages, was published in German as Optische Untersuchungen zur Frage der Passivität des Eisens und Stahls. For it, he received the doctorate degree. He was hired at the Norwegian Institute of Technology as a lecturer in the summer of 1931, although he {{spent the first}} year at the University of Cambridge, conducting further research with a scholarship from a memorial fund of Christian Michelsen. The research at Cambridge was a continuation of his thesis work, but this time he tested his method on mercury.|$|E
