500|$|The related [...] rosy spike-cap (Gomphidius roseus) {{is found}} {{exclusively}} with this species, {{and is now}} thought to be parasitic upon the mycelium of Suillus bovinus. This is evidenced by microscopic examination, which shows that G.roseus inserts haustoria in plant root cells and does not produce significant mycelium itself. Furthermore, G.roseus is never found growing in isolation, only with S.bovinus though the latter species is found without the former. Dicranophora fulva is a <b>yellow</b> <b>mould</b> that has been found growing on decaying S.bovinus fruit bodies in Europe and the United States.|$|E

The asci contains eight spores that are typically unarranged while the perithecia are typically <b>yellow.</b> The <b>mould</b> can appear as either yellow or in patches of green.|$|R
25|$|Hittorff lectured in Paris in 1829-1830 that Greek temples had {{originally}} been painted ochre <b>yellow,</b> with the <b>moulding</b> and sculptural details in red, blue, green and gold. While this {{may or may not}} have been the case with older wooden or plain stone temples, it was definitely not the case with the more luxurious marble temples, where colour was used sparingly to accentuate architectural highlights.|$|R
40|$|Onychomycosis {{accounts}} {{for half of}} all nail pathologies. Never prescribe a local or a systemic antifungal without confirmation of the diagnosis. The quality of the sampling {{is the cornerstone of}} mycological analysis. If the results of the mycology are negative, do not hesitate to harvest a new specimen if the clinical features are highly suggestive. Otherwise, think to another cause. Identify the clinical presentations at high risk of failure to classical treatments (thick hyperkeratosis, onycholysis, lateral disease, <b>yellow</b> spikes, <b>moulds).</b> Always eradicate as much as possible of the infected keratin (mechanically, chemically or surgically). A mycologic cure means a return to a complete normal nail with a negative culture. Prevent recurrences. SCOPUS: sh. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

It is likely that Penson, whose offices were at Oswestry was using the experimental terracotta that was being produced at the brickyards connected with the Oswestry Coalfield between Trefonen and Morda.

40|$|Periorbital necrotizing {{fasciitis}} {{is a rare}} but potentially fatal infection. It is most commonly caused by Gram-positive group A β-haemolytic Streptococci and rarely by fungal infections. In this report, we present a rare case of periorbital {{necrotizing fasciitis}} caused by Aspergillus species in an immunocompromised patient. He presented to us {{with a history of}} a slowly progressive eyelid necrosis leading to a loss of vision in one eye. The patient was started on an antibiotic and subsequently, surgical debridement and enucleation were performed. A few days post-operatively, <b>yellow</b> white <b>mould</b> colonies were noted to grow on the wound surface. Microbiology cultures identified them as Aspergillus species and intravenous amphotericin B 10  mg was added daily. However, despite the extensive medical and surgical treatments, he failed to respond and succumbed from septicaemia and multi-organ failure...|$|R
6000|$|Fifty hulls, at least, moulded on {{lines of}} beauty and speed--hulls of wood, of iron, expressing in their forms the highest {{achievement}} of modern ship-building--lay moored all in a row, stem to quay, as if assembled there for an exhibition, not of a great industry, but of a great art. Their colours were gray, black, dark green, with a narrow strip of <b>yellow</b> <b>moulding</b> defining their sheer, or with a row of painted ports decking in warlike decoration their robust flanks of cargo-carriers that would know no triumph but of speed in carrying a burden, no glory other than of a long service, no victory but that of an endless, obscure contest with the sea. The great empty hulls with swept holds, just out of dry-dock, with their paint glistening freshly, sat high-sided with ponderous dignity alongside the wooden jetties, looking more like unmovable buildings than things meant to go afloat; others, half loaded, far {{on the way to}} recover the true sea-physiognomy of a ship brought down to her load-line, looked more accessible. Their less steeply slanting gangways seemed to invite the strolling sailors in search of a berth to walk on board and try [...] "for a chance" [...] with the chief mate, the guardian of a ship's efficiency. As if anxious to remain unperceived amongst their overtopping sisters, two or three [...] "finished" [...] ships floated low, with an air of straining at the leash of their level headfasts, exposing to view their cleared decks and covered hatches, prepared to drop stern first out of the labouring ranks, displaying the true comeliness of form which only her proper sea-trim gives to a ship. And for a good quarter of a mile, from the dockyard gate to the farthest corner, where the old housed-in hulk, the President (drill-ship, then, of the Naval Reserve), used to lie with her frigate side rubbing against the stone of the quay, above all these hulls, ready and unready, a hundred and fifty lofty masts, more or less, held out the web of their rigging like an immense net, in whose close mesh, black against the sky, the heavy yards seemed to be entangled and suspended.|$|R
5000|$|Mills became wider, Houldsworth Mill, Reddish (1865) was 35 m {{wide and}} {{accommodated}} 1200 spindle mules. It was of four storeys and had sixteen bays {{on each side}} of a central engine house; a double mill. The central block provided offices and warehousing. A mill had a range of ancillary buildings. [...] Stair columns often extending above the mill and housed a water tank for the sprinkler system. The floors were higher allowing for taller windows. Accrington brick was used from 1890, decorated with <b>yellow</b> sandstone with <b>moulded</b> brick and terracotta features. Etched and stained glass was used in the offices. Mills were designed by specialist architects and architectural quality became a major consideration.|$|R
