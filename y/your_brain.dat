500|$|Steiger was so {{devoted to}} his craft that during the 1970s he turned to many foreign productions, {{especially}} in Italy, to obtain the sort of roles he desired, but often clashed with directors over his method acting techniques.

Because that gets into <b>your</b> <b>brain</b> and therefore into your life, so to speak.

500|$|The song {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics. In 2011, Rolling Stone {{called it the}} second greatest Gaga song of all time, praising the song's theme and beat.

[...] Alexis Petridis of The Guardian said that, [...] "You may quickly tire of hearing the album's theme constantly reiterated, but the tune of 'Paparazzi' takes up residence in <b>your</b> <b>brain</b> and refuses to budge." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called the song clever and said that it [...] "functions simultaneously as glorious pop trash and a wicked parody of it." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} glowing critical reception. Charlie Jane Anders of io9 {{called the}} episode [...] "one {{of the most}} intense things I've seen in ages."

It's rare that any television show gets its hooks into <b>your</b> <b>brain</b> like that, but especially a kid's cartoon." [...] She concluded that the main reason that the ending was so powerful was that it showed the viewers the [...] "immediate aftermath of the Mushroom War" [...] and allowed the viewers to see [...] "the way Marceline's personal loss mirrors the wider loss {{of the end of}} the entire world" [...] following the war.|$|E

[...] In June 2016, Kjellberg announced he had been evicted from his recording studio after his landlord confronted him for being too loud.

He believed his playing intelligence improved by playing against more attack-minded full backs in the Championship, saying that [...] "They are still quick to react and {{you have got to}} use <b>your</b> <b>brain</b> {{a little bit more than}} in League One. It's developed me as a player because you need to learn how to perform in different situations against different players". Pugh made 45 appearances and scored 5 goals in 2013–14 as Bournemouth finished in 10th place in the Championship, which at the time was the highest league ranking in the club's history.|$|E
500|$|Brain Age 2: More Training in Minutes a Day! (stylized as Brain Age2), {{also known}} as More Brain Training from Dr. Kawashima: How Old Is <b>Your</b> <b>Brain?</b> in PAL regions, is an {{edutainment}} puzzle game and the sequel to [...] (2005). It was published and developed by Nintendo for the Nintendo DS handheld game console. Before the game begins, the player must perform a Brain Age Check to determine their brain age, which ranges from 20 to 80, to determine approximately their brain's responsiveness. A brain age of 20, the lowest age that the player can achieve, indicates that the player's brain is as responsive as that of an average 20-year-old. After the player is told their initial brain age, they can complete a series of minigames to help improve their brain's responsiveness, after which they can run Brain Age Check again to determine their updated brain age.|$|E
