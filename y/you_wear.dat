500|$|Beautiful Heartache was {{marketed as}} [...] "grown-up, piano-led pop, heavy on {{classical}} motifs". The first single released for {{the album was}} titled, [...] "Say My Name". A music video for the second single released from the album featured Grigorieva on the piano, as well as portraying an assistant to a knife-thrower. The album includes a title track, [...] "Beautiful Heartache", with lyrics including: [...] "I love the way <b>you</b> <b>wear</b> your skin."

500|$|Most of the band's lyrics {{were written}} by MacKaye. Like the group's appearance, their lyrical subject matter reacted against the then {{dominant}} new wave scene, and the perceived complacency that many first-wave punk bands, including the Clash and the Damned, seemed to have fallen into by the early 1980s. In [...] "Fleeting Fury", Strejcek pleads, [...] "The clothes <b>you</b> <b>wear</b> have lost their sting / So's the fury in the songs you sing". The Teen Idles were strongly influenced by punk bands in Washington and California, such as Bad Brains, Black Flag, and the Germs. These influences were reflected in the Teen Idles' songs, which consisted mostly of Strejcek shouting over a one-two hardcore beat, with MacKaye and Grindle providing short and speedy riffs, interspersed with quick guitar solos from Grindle.|$|E
500|$|A {{different}} client, Jantzen swimwear, {{asks for}} help to maintain a family-friendly image in a field where bikinis are becoming more common and more revealing. They insist they do not sell bikinis, which they call underwear <b>you</b> <b>wear</b> to the beach; they sell two-piece bathing suits. Don Draper tries to sell a pitch wherein the model's breasts are obscured by the slogan, [...] "So well built, we can't show you the second floor". The Jantzen representatives reject the ad as overly risqué, and Draper - exasperated by the clients' refusal to acknowledge a changing culture and the realities of their business - ends up throwing the men out of the meeting room. As they leave, he finally agrees to do the interview with The Wall Street Journal. As the episode ends, Don is seen telling the journalist the swashbuckling story of how he instigated the formation of SCDP by having Lane Pryce fire them.|$|E
500|$|In {{the final}} weeks, the band decided {{to exclude the}} {{traditional}} rock songs and guitar-driven tracks they had written in favour of an [...] "album of disjointed, experimental pop". The Edge received a production credit—his first on a U2 record—for the extra level of responsibility he assumed for the album. Twenty songs were recorded during the sessions, but ultimately 10 were chosen for the final track listing. One piece that was left off the record was [...] "In Cold Blood", which featured somber lyrics written by Bono {{in response to the}} Bosnian War and was previewed prior to the album's release. Other tracks that were left off the album included [...] "Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me", [...] "If God Will Send His Angels", [...] "If <b>You</b> <b>Wear</b> That Velvet Dress", and [...] "Wake Up Dead Man". The first was later released as a single from the Batman Forever soundtrack in 1995, and the latter three were included on the band's following studio album, Pop, in 1997.|$|E

500|$|Around this period, the Ravens {{decided on}} a new, {{permanent}} name: the Kinks. Numerous explanations of the name's genesis have been offered. In Jon Savage's analysis, they [...] "needed a gimmick, some edge to get them attention. Here it was: 'Kinkiness'—something newsy, naughty but just on the borderline of acceptability. In adopting the 'Kinks' as their name at that time, they were participating in a time-honoured pop ritual—fame through outrage." [...] Manager Robert Wace related {{his side of the}} story: [...] "I had a friend... He thought the group was rather fun. If my memory is correct, he came up with the name just as an idea, as a good way of getting publicity... When we went to [...] with the name, they were... absolutely horrified. They said, 'We're not going to be called kinky! Ray Davies' account conflicts with Wace's—he recalled that the name was coined by Larry Page, and referenced their [...] "kinky" [...] fashion sense. Davies quoted him as saying, [...] "The way you look, and the clothes <b>you</b> <b>wear,</b> you ought to be called the Kinks." [...] "I've never really liked the name", Ray stated.|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} [...] "Pretty Hurts" [...] {{are related to}} third-wave {{feminism}} and self-empowerment. It confronts society's standards and stereotypes with regard to female beauty. The song opens with a recorded snippet of a beauty pageant judge questioning Beyoncé on her life aspirations, to which she replies, [...] "My aspiration in life would be... to be happy". The sample is used to frame the song {{in the context of}} the singer's childhood. According to Michael Cragg from The Guardian, the snippets were used to question the singer's [...] "drive and desire that's got her to where she is today, and whether the struggle was entirely worth it". The song then transcends into a depiction of Beyoncé as a beauty pageant contest awaiting judgment in the lyrics, [...] "Mama said, 'You're a pretty girl, what's in your head, it doesn't matter. Brush your hair, fix your teeth. What <b>you</b> <b>wear</b> is all that matters". The second verse of [...] "Pretty Hurts"—"Blonder hair, flat chest/ TV says bigger is better/ South Beach, sugar free/ Vogue says thinner is better"—serve as an analysis of female body image and society's obsession with physical perfection.|$|E

500|$|On his hiring, Baker explained, [...] "I did the Dino De Laurentiis {{version of}} King Kong in 1976 {{and was always}} {{disappointed}} because I wasn't {{able to do it}} as realistically as I wanted. I thought Apes would {{be a good way to}} make up for that." [...] In addition to King Kong, Baker previously worked with designing ape makeup on , , and the 1998 remake of Mighty Joe Young. The makeup took 4.5 hours to apply and 1.5 hours to remove. Burton explained, [...] "it's like going to the dentist at two in the morning and having people poke at you for hours. Then <b>you</b> <b>wear</b> an ape costume until nine at night." [...] Burton was adamant that the apes should be substantially [...] "more animal-like; flying through trees, climb walls, swing out of windows, and go ape shit when angry." [...] For a month and a half before shooting started, the actors who portrayed apes attended [...] "ape school". Industrial Light & Magic, Rhythm and Hues Studios and Animal Logic were commissioned for the visual effects sequences. Rick Heinrichs served as the production designer and Colleen Atwood did costume design.|$|E
500|$|In the {{interlude}} {{before the}} first encore, U2 had a worried discussion over the introduction to [...] "Miss Sarajevo". [...] The song had only been played once prior—at a benefit concert in 1995 with Bono, The Edge, Eno, and Pavarotti. They returned to the stage and played [...] "Discothèque", [...] "If <b>You</b> <b>Wear</b> That Velvet Dress", [...] "With or Without You", and a rough version of [...] "Miss Sarajevo". Pavarotti {{was not at the}} concert to sing his part and so an antique gramophone was brought onto the stage in his place. Eno came on stage to sing backing vocals, and Bono invited Nogić on stage during the chorus. During the song, the video screen showed images from Carter's Miss Sarajevo documentary, including footage of the girls taking part in the beauty contest and the banner reading [...] "Please don't let them kill us". Bono apologized for the rocky performance {{at the end of the}} song, saying [...] "Sarajevo, this song was written for you. I hope you like it, because we can't fucking play it." [...] The concert concluded with a second encore of [...] "Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me", [...] "Mysterious Ways", [...] "One", and an abbreviated cover of [...] "Unchained Melody".|$|E
500|$|Midnight Heat was {{released}} in July 2012 following Heat Rush. It is packaged in a purple bottle. According to Beyoncé's official website, [...] "For , fragrance is an essential accessory to highlight your inner radiance, confidence and sex appeal. Midnight Heat is the ultimate evening scent, sensual and enticing with {{just a hint of}} mystery." [...] The perfume's top notes are described as dragonfruit, apricot and starfruit; middle notes of orchid, tulip and peony; and base notes of sandalwood, patchouli and amber. A poster for the fragrance {{was released}} on July 18, 2012, and shows Beyoncé wearing a purple mini-dress. Idolator's writer X. Alexander wrote that she looked [...] "appropriately regal in purple in her new fragrance art" [...] while Julee Wilson of The Huffington Post wrote that the advertisement [...] "definitely screams sensual". Gaby Wilson of MTV commented that the photo appropriately sets the mood for the midnight perfume further praising Beyoncé's look. Ambika Mutto of VH1 gave a negative review for the poster, writing that she was [...] "really disappointed" [...] because the image was [...] "boring and literal". She noted, [...] "Sexy hair flying, sexy dress in a color reminiscent of midnight, on a rooftop against the midnight sky — we get it." [...] A writer of the website Digital Spy praised the scent, writing that it empowers [...] "your inner diva" [...] and added that [...] "there will be no Single Ladies left if <b>you</b> <b>wear</b> this". At the 2013 StyleBistro Awards, Midnight Heat was nominated in the category for Best New Fragrance.|$|E

500|$|Portman and Kunis started {{training}} {{six months}} before the start of filming in order to attain a body type and muscle tone more similar to those of professional dancers. Portman worked out for five hours a day, doing ballet, cross-training, and swimming. A few months closer to filming, she began choreography training. Kunis engaged in cardio and Pilates, [...] "train seven days a week, five hours, for five, six months total, and ... was put on a very strict diet of 1,200 calories a day." [...] She lost 20 pounds from her normal weight of about 117 pounds, and reported that Portman [...] "became smaller than I did." [...] Kunis said, [...] "I did ballet as a kid like every other kid does ballet. <b>You</b> <b>wear</b> a tutu and you stand on stage and you look cute and twirl. But this is very different because you can't fake it. You can't just stay in there and like pretend you know what you're doing. Your whole body has to be structured differently." [...] Georgina Parkinson, a ballet mistress from the American Ballet Theatre (ABT), coached the actors in ballet. ABT soloists Sarah Lane and Maria Riccetto served as [...] "dance doubles" [...] for Portman and Kunis respectively. Dancer Kimberly Prosa also served as a double for Portman. She stated: [...] "Natalie took class, she studied for several months, from the waist up is her. Sarah Lane a soloist at ABT, did the heavy tricks, she did the fouettés, but they only had her for a limited time, a couple of weeks, so I did the rest of whatever dance shots they needed." ...|$|E
500|$|The sleeve was {{designed}} by Works Associates of Dublin {{under the direction of}} Steve Averill, who had created the majority of U2's album covers. Brian Williams was the graphic designer and created the digital images and layout. Inspired by the Zoo TV Tour's [...] "highly charged electronic TV images in all of their saturated colours and fizz", Works Associates conceived a [...] "kind of electronic flag" [...] for Zooropa. The cover features a sketch of the circle of stars from the Flag of Europe with an [...] "astrobaby" [...] drawing in the center. The illustration, created by Shaughn McGrath, was an alteration of the [...] "graffiti babyface" [...] by Charlie Whisker that was originally {{on the face of the}} Achtung Baby compact disc/vinyl record. The cover's drawing was meant to represent an urban legend of a Soviet cosmonaut supposedly left floating in orbit for weeks after the collapse of the Soviet Union. In the background is a montage of blurred images, similar to the arrangement of images on Achtung Babys sleeve. The images include shots of a woman's face and mouth, as well as photographs of European leaders, including Vladimir Lenin, Benito Mussolini, and Nicolae Ceauşescu. These images are obscured by distorted purple text comprising the names of songs planned for the record that were provided to Works Associates during the sleeve design process. However, the album's track listing was eventually changed and the titles of several songs withheld from the album were accidentally left in the cover image; the songs include [...] "Wake Up Dead Man", [...] "Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me", and [...] "If <b>You</b> <b>Wear</b> That Velvet Dress". Author Višnja Cogan described this text as giving the impression of a [...] "torn veil".|$|E
