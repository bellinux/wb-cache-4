2500|$|Before the war, Aziz {{claimed he}} would rather die than be a U.S. {{prisoner}} of war: [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> <b>me,</b> after all my history as a militant and {{as one of the}} Iraqi leaders, to go to an American prison – to go to Guantanamo? I would rather die", he told Britain's ITV.|$|E
2500|$|Bouazizi, {{angered by}} the confrontation, went to the governor's office to {{complain}} and to ask for his scales back. The governor refused to see or listen to him, even after Bouazizi was quoted as saying, [...] "If you don't see me, I'll burn myself." [...] Bouazizi then acquired a can of gasoline from a nearby gas station {{and returned to the}} governor's office. While {{standing in the middle of}} traffic, he shouted, [...] "How do <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> to make a living?" [...] He then doused himself with the gasoline and set himself alight with a match at [...] local time, less than an hour after the altercation.|$|E
2500|$|New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, {{who flew}} back to the state from New Hampshire during his presidential campaign, left to resume campaigning shortly after the storm passed. He was criticized for his quick {{departure}} and heated responses to questions about why he left the state. He stated that while there was some locally significant flood damage in Southern New Jersey, the overall effects across the state did not warrant his presence. He responded to one person by saying, [...] "I don’t know what <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> to do. You {{want me to go}} down there with a mop?" [...] A Stockton University graduate started up a fund to provide 1,000mops to Christie in response to his comment. On January26, Christie apologized to North Wildwood Mayor Patrick Rosenello for calling him [...] "crazy" [...] during his response to criticism the day prior. Christie also requested that Rosenello apologize on his behalf to first responders, residents, and business owners.|$|E
6000|$|... “I don’t remember. You {{said very}} little about it; you seemed to make a kind of mystery. I knew of course <b>you</b> <b>expected</b> <b>me</b> to live here, but I didn’t know <b>you</b> <b>expected</b> <b>me</b> to like it.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, good heavens, {{you talk}} as if I made {{a habit of}} {{blacking}} up! You talk as if <b>you</b> <b>expected</b> <b>me</b> to come to the altar smothered in burnt cork." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's all right. It {{was only}} my whim {{to see if}} you would give up a secret as easily as <b>you</b> <b>expected</b> <b>me</b> to give up my secret of the new catacomb. You wouldn't, and I didn't <b>expect</b> <b>you</b> to. But why should <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> {{otherwise}} of <b>me?</b> There's Saint John's clock striking ten. It is quite time that I was going home." ...|$|R
2500|$|French {{at first}} {{reported}} to Kitchener that the German attacks by Fourth and Sixth Armies were their [...] "last card" [...] and the BEF were holding them off. [...] He was unimpressed by Smith-Dorrien telling him (midnight on 25 October) that his Corps [...] "might go during the night", {{although he did}} send reinforcements. Generals Macdonogh and Radcliffe later testified to the Official Historian Edmonds in the early 1920s that French [...] "believed what he wished to believe" [...] and [...] "never could believe that the Germans were not at their last gasp". [...] He thought [...] "everything was going splendidly" [...] and [...] "the Germans were exhausted" [...] until warned of the arrival of German reinforcements, at which point he (allegedly) grew angry and banged his fist on the table shouting [...] "How do <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> to carry out my campaign if you carry on bringing up these blasted divisions?" ...|$|E
2500|$|One {{remaining}} competitor was Octave Lapize. In {{the fifth}} stage, Defraye {{had problems with}} his knees, and was more than fifteen minutes behind Lapize. Defraye came back, and kept Lapize one point behind him in the general classification. In the sixth stage, Defraye attacked and only Lapize could follow, as they climbed the major Alp mountains together. Then Defraye punctured, and Lapize won the stage, so Lapize shared the lead with Defraye. In the seventh stage, Defraye punctured again, but {{he came back and}} won the stage. The eighth stage was a flat stage, and the fight was expected to continue in the ninth stage. Before the ninth stage, Lapize was only 2 points behind. During that stage in the Pyrénées, Defraye broke away on the Col de Portet d'Aspet, and Lapize could not follow. Later, Lapize stopped in protest because all the Belgians were riding for Defraye. Lapize said: [...] "How can <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> to challenge in such conditions?" [...] The rest of his team La Française, the two remaining Charles Crupelandt and Marcel Godivier did not start the next stage, also in protest.|$|E
6000|$|... "Home!" [...] he sneered, looking about. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> to {{call this}} place home? Do <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> to hang about this scrubby hole to be disciplined by your Voices?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm sorry, sir," [...] he said. [...] "Perhaps I was extravagant, but if {{you don't}} {{want to be an}} outsider, you must do like the rest, and I {{understood}} <b>you</b> <b>expected</b> <b>me</b> to make friends among our own set. We can't be shabby." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{ask your}} pardon, sir,' rejoined the locksmith. 'I didn't say I {{understood}} her. I wouldn't have the presumption {{to say that}} of any woman. It's not so easily done. But I am not so much surprised, sir, as <b>you</b> <b>expected</b> <b>me</b> to be, certainly.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good Lord, George, {{you don't}} suppose it's any novelty {{to me to}} find that we hustlers, that think we're so all-fired successful, aren't getting much out of it? You look as if <b>you</b> <b>expected</b> <b>me</b> to report <b>you</b> as seditious! You know what my own life's been." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know," [...] {{said the}} general relentlessly, [...] "that {{you have never}} {{attempted}} any defence. That has been to your credit with me. It inclined me to overlook your unwarranted course in writing to my daughter, when you told her you would never see her again. What did <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> to think, after that, of your coming back to see her? Or didn't <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> to know it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The question's rather indefinite, isn't it?" [...] she said. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> to be {{acquainted with}} all your recent actions?" ...|$|E
60|$|HARRY. I don't know. How do <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> {{to guess}} what is {{at the back of}} a Chinese brain? She's hated me always.|$|E
6000|$|She {{opened the}} door. Agnes called her back. There was {{something}} in the woman's apology that appealed irresistibly to her just and generous nature. 'Come,' she said; 'we must not part in this way. Let me not misunderstand you. What is it that <b>you</b> <b>expected</b> <b>me</b> to do?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Now I am all right,' said Mr Meagles, after {{a minute}} or so. 'Now it's over. Arthur, my dear fellow, confess at once that <b>you</b> <b>expected</b> <b>me</b> before.' 'I did,' said Arthur; 'but Amy told me--' 'Little Dorrit. Never any other name.' (It was she who whispered it.) ...|$|R
60|$|SIR HOWARD. I do. And I suppose <b>you</b> will <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> to {{accompany}} <b>you.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Major, {{stand up}} {{straight}} and behave yourself! How do <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> to sponge your vest when you're wriggling around in that way?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Campbell, triumphantly: [...] "Exactly! And now do <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> {{to believe}} you haven't been at that decanter? Where do you suppose you put it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am {{not aware}} what {{description}} of good <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> {{to do with}} it, Will,' coolly answered the elder brother in a disconcerting tone.|$|E
60|$|GEORGE. But we are--aren't we? <b>You</b> couldn't <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> to keep quiet, {{under the}} circumstances.|$|R
6000|$|Miss Prism. I {{was told}} <b>you</b> <b>expected</b> <b>me</b> in the vestry, dear Canon. I {{have been waiting}} for you there for an hour and three-quarters. [Catches sight of Lady Bracknell, who has fixed her with a stony glare. Miss Prism grows pale and quails. She looks anxiously round as if desirous to escape.] ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Willis Campbell, in the doorway: [...] "Oh, Amy, indeed! How d' y' do, Edward! Glad to see {{you back}} alive, and {{just in time for}} Agnes to kill you with Mrs. Miller's musicale. May I ask, Agnes, how long <b>you</b> <b>expected</b> <b>me</b> to freeze to death down in that coupé before you came?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Did <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> to be haggard and wrinkled? I {{never let}} myself grow old. One only needs {{strength}} {{of mind to}} keep young indefinitely." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Can <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> to be, {{with the}} whole place {{jingling}} and shaking? If I’m to get better it must be away from the mill.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No liqueurs, thanks," [...] he said. [...] "I wonder, did <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> to-night? I don't {{think that}} I {{ought to have}} come, ought I?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{would not}} {{consider}} our projected union a secret engagement, if, after passing to-morrow with your father, <b>you</b> <b>expected</b> <b>me</b> {{on the next}} day to communicate to him our position. Is it any more a secret engagement because six or seven days are to elapse before this communication takes place, instead of one? My Henrietta is indeed fighting with shadows!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh dear," [...] said Maggie, smiling, and {{flushed with}} pleasure, [...] "what a queer little girl I was! I {{remember}} myself with my hair in that way, in that pink frock. I really {{was like a}} gypsy. I dare say I am now," [...] she added, after a little pause; [...] "am I like what <b>you</b> <b>expected</b> <b>me</b> to be?" ...|$|R
60|$|BOBBY. Well, <b>you</b> cant <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> {{to approve}} of it, can you, Meg? I {{never thought you}} were that sort of girl.|$|R
6000|$|VALENTINE (obstinately). Yes, lies. (He {{sits down}} again beside her.) Do <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> {{to believe that}} you are the most {{beautiful}} woman in the world? ...|$|E
6000|$|Señor Perkins {{shrugged his}} {{shoulders}} respectfully as to Donna Dolores, but scornfully of an unbusiness-like sex. [...] "How did <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> to institute a comparison?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are you reciting a {{catalogue}} of your crimes, or do <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> {{to get up and}} cheer? What is a rugger blue, to start with?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If you {{are quite}} {{convinced}} of that, {{there is nothing}} more to be said. <b>You</b> couldn't <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> to appreciate your attitude." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{it is in}} Somersetshire.--I cannot go into Somersetshire.--There, where I {{looked forward}} to going...No, Elinor, <b>you</b> cannot <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> to go there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think not," [...] she said. [...] "Perhaps <b>you</b> are <b>expecting</b> <b>me</b> to {{come down}} with the lunch and {{compliment}} you all upon your prowess." ...|$|R
