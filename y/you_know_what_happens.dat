Perhaps it is a good thing that he does, for he might grow too fat to keep {{out of the way of}} Reddy Fox. You see when the snow is deep Peter is forced to eat {{whatever}} he can, and very often there isn't much of anything for him but the bark of young trees.

It dies for the simple reason that it is up the inner layer of bark that the life-giving sap travels in the spring and summer.

And we were like, 'Wow! This man can speak. And this is going to be amazing, because he's so vocal and has like zero filter and he's just going to say all this shit that's going to be awesome'. And, obviously, if you've seen the film, <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens,</b> so that changed the entire dynamic of how this documentary got made. Originally Milius was going to be our driving force in this picture and that totally got derailed. And we had to find this voice now, because we have to hear him speak, obviously. That's what made it a bit more difficult.|$|E

5000|$|At Borneo Thailand, Reggie {{is seen in}} his lair, while he's taunting Shelly (who {{is still}} in her Heruka form) {{who is in a}} cage. Albino and Octavio arrive and Octavio has {{reported}} Reggie about the Chupacabra (spelled [...] "Chupakabra" [...] in the game) in Puerto Rico. Reggie forces Octavio to take Meg and Steppenwolf to Puerto Rico to get a blood sample from the Chupacabra. Octavio soon arrives at Puerto Rico with Meg and Steppenwolf. Octavio tells them to be careful by an evil group of villains called [...] "the Cult". Soon, Meg and Steppenwolf have stayed in a house and are seen at the balcony seeing a very nice view. Steppenwolf then had to leave for a while to see if Octavio has returned from his meeting at the Hotel Santo. Before going to the hotel, he knockes on several doors on houses, but the Puerto Rican villagers won't let him inside, because the Chupacabra is out there. Steppenwolf then head to the Hotel Santo. He enters one of the rooms and finds a scared man. He tells Steppenwolf to leave, because the Chupacabra apparently attacked Octavio at the other room. However he goes to the other room where Octavio is stabbed, not bitten and is badly wounded. He calls Meg for help to get here as soon as possible. Suddenly, Steppenwolf finds the man running in the hall. Steppenwolf has realized man attacked Octavio. After he leaves the hotel and breaks into the house, he finds the same person who was running into the hallway at the hotel. The man blocks Steppenwolf's path and tries to stab him with a dagger. Steppenwolf uses plates to hit the man. Steppenwolf then used a trash can lid and runs into the man who crashes into some of the glass objects and the objects breaks into sharp pieces and the wounded thief runs for his life. Steppenwolf chases the man while he finds the man's trail of blood. Steppenwolf goes into the sewer (thieves are blocking his path at the buildings and rats are blocking the sewers, until he scares them off with flames) and finds himself leading to the beach. Steppenwolf then finds a symbol where a cult has been. He uses the dagger into the doorway. As the secret door opens, Steppenwolf enters and he falls into a trapdoor. He falls into a cage and accidentally smashed his communicator that was on his left glove. He suddenly sees the Chupacabra growling at him. Meanwhile, back at the Santio Hotel, Meg and a doctor are giving aid to Octavio. Meg said that Steppenwolf isn't answering his calls, but she'll find him. As Meg leaves the hotel, a boy named Pedro then spotted her. He asks if she seen the Chupacabra. Meg said yes and asked how did he knew. Pedro said that a local farmer's goats were killed by the monster and its tracks are still fresh. He said he will take her to the area. As they reached there, the farmer told the two to leave, because he said there was [...] "nothing" [...] to see here. Meg needs to get inside to see what the farmer's hiding and Pedro will attract the farmer's attention by throwing rocks. After Pedro distracted the farmer, Meg gets inside and locks one of the Dobermen in a car. When Meg reached to the garden, she noticed dead goats with the same cult symbol on them and with a dagger next to them. However, the farmer noticed his dog locked in the car and the gate leading to dead goats is open. He releases his dog and tries to find Meg, but she keeps hiding in the tall grass. Meg then trapped the dog in a box. She then reaches to a farm and the farmer follows her. When Meg got in, the farmer was searching for her. Meg distracted him by running a lot of water and she climbs up a ladder where it leads to another room. Meg then finds a note that says "Now, <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> to those who refused to cooperate. Don't bother asking for help; you won't get it, and you never know when you'll be asking one of us. We're everywhere. So, from now on, do exactly what we say, and don't whisper a word to anyone - or next time, it won't be your livestock lying shredded {{in a pool of blood}} and gore." There was also a drop of blood on the note. Back at Donovan's lair, his nurse putting cosmetic on his face. He said that he was having enough of the disgusting concoctions. The nurse tells him to quit moving or she'll mess up his [...] "beautiful" [...] face. We see Reggie has some slight wrinkles on himself and a red spot on his forehead. He tells the nurse that he'll only accept orders from a babe like her if she gets a little closer to him and he chuckles. The nurse laughs with joy. Donovan told Albino to ask if a man can have some fun, but maybe not. Albino feels a bit nervous and clears his throat. Donovan then told Albino that he doesn't trust Octavio and tells him to go to Puerto Rico to keep a close eye on their team.|$|E

40|$|On {{the first}} Mega-Store trip on move-in day at Midwest University, Sally {{and her mom}} picked up {{groceries}} for the dorm. Sally’s mom insisted on getting bottled water for her daughter because of her firm belief that bottled water was safer and cleaner than tap water. Back at the dorm, however, Sally’s new roommate, Jane, a sophomore Environmental Studies major, argued against this with facts she had learned in class. “Did you know that while tap water is frequently tested to maintain public health and safety, bottled water has no guidelines for testing? The fda can’t regulate water that is bottled and sold within the same state, which accounts for 60 – 70 % of bottled water. ” Sally was taken aback by her new roommate’s comments {{on the first day}} that they met. “Ummmm, ok, but it can’t be that bad, ” she mumbled. Sally’s mother, on the other hand, admired Jane’s enthusiasm and passion for the environment, and her knowledge of bottled water. “So what you’re saying is you want to pay a lot more for untested water sealed in bottles that are horrible for the environment, especially since people don’t recycle? ” said Jane. “Water bottles are convenient … anyway, I recycle … sometimes, ” stuttered Sally.
