Tubb, who remained editor {{to the end of}} the magazine's life. Tubb had contributed a great deal of material to the magazine under various pseudonyms, often amounting to more than half of an issue's fiction, and he later recalled that Campbell's way of hiring him as editor was to say to him, [...] "As you're practically writing it, <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> edit it." ...|$|E
500|$|In April 2005, while captaining the Crusaders, McCaw again {{suffered}} a concussion. He was stretchered {{off the field}} two minutes into the game after attempting a tackle on Bulls prop Richard Bands. After the incident, McCaw visited a young boy in hospital who had broken his neck playing rugby and started to question whether he should be playing the game. Another paraplegic in the ward {{told him he had}} broken his neck swimming on holiday in Fiji, convincing McCaw that it could happen anywhere, and <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> [...] "do what you enjoy". A month later, in May 2005, McCaw returned to training with the Crusaders and led them in their semi-final and final victories.|$|E
500|$|Powderfinger {{went on a}} {{nationwide}} tour {{after the release of}} Internationalist, performing with British band Swervedriver and fellow Brisbane band Not From There in capital cities across Australia. In 1999, the band also toured with Something for Kate and Alex Lloyd. Collins described the process of choosing who the band would play with as a simple matter of choosing whose music the band preferred, stating [...] "we had played with most of the bands, and if you're going on tour with someone <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> go with someone you get along with and whose music you enjoy." [...] Despite being fans of Swervedriver, who were renowned for [...] "their capability to reproduce their album sound perfectly in the live setting" [...] according to Beat Magazine's Neala Johnson, Fanning said Powderfinger would never attempt to replicate them, because he believed their live shows to be much more [...] "emotionally powerful" [...] than recordings.|$|E

2500|$|Barry Commoner {{has criticized}} Ehrlich's 1970 {{statement}} that [...] "When {{you reach a}} point where you realize further efforts will be futile, <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> look after yourself and your friends and enjoy what little time you have left. That point for me is 1972." [...] Gardner has criticized Ehrlich for endorsing the strategies proposed by William and Paul Paddock in their book Famine 1975!. They had proposed a system of [...] "triage" [...] that would end food aid to [...] "hopeless" [...] countries such as India and Egypt. In Population Bomb, Ehrlich suggests that [...] "there is no rational choice except to adopt some form of the Paddocks' strategy as far as food distribution is concerned." [...] Had this strategy been implemented for countries such as India and Egypt, which were reliant on food aid at that time, they would almost certainly have suffered famines. Instead, both Egypt and India have greatly increased their food production and now feed much larger populations without reliance on food aid.|$|E

2500|$|Critic website Stereo Board {{stated that}} [...] "Alesha's fearlessly {{powerful}} vocals with an unforgettable, anthemic chorus that {{is set to}} make it a sure-fire radio sensation." [...] Female First gave the single four out of five stars, stating there were [...] "in love with it". Others criticised the song, saying it sounded like [...] "Dixon [...] unknowingly sample Robyn's 'Dancing on My Own'". Another positive review, came from Robert Copsey from Digital Spy who gave 4/5 stars for the song, saying [...] "Upon further listening, the reason for her apathetic approach towards ear candy becomes all too clear. [...] "I'm turning up the radio / I'll drown you out / 'Cause I don't want to let you go," [...] she mourns over a combination of jagged beats and throbbing synths that sounds suspiciously like Robyn's own weepy club ballad 'Dancing on My Own'.

2500|$|Similarly, if {{you have}} a lost {{position}} and can manage to induce your opponent to play quickly, you maximize the chances of a swindle. As Benko explains, [...] "{{if you have}} a lost position, <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> try speed chess—you can only lose a game once. Maybe your opponent will get rattled and blow his advantage." [...] GM Larry Christiansen successfully used this strategy in Burden–Christiansen, Las Vegas 1992 (diagram at left). Down a queen for a knight and pawn against an opponent rated about 2200 (master-level), he managed to outplay his opponent and win! National Master Todd Barwick explains, [...] "Christiansen hung his queen (!) in the early middle game and had a hopelessly lost position. He then moved quickly, hoping to get Jim [...] caught up in a faster paced game where the probability of Jim making a mistake was increased. The idea worked as the game actually speeded up to a blitz pace where Jim ended up blundering away a game he would have never lost had he taken his time." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nevertheless, Hungerford {{made the}} right choice in {{breaking}} professional ties with George W. Patterson Jr., who took over as the President of the Geo. Washington Bank. On November 2, 1868, Patterson left work, placing his eighteen-year-old teller, George Eaton, in charge of the bank. Some time after three o'clock, a man came in and announced that he was a government detective there to arrest Eaton and Patterson for counterfeiting money. Eaton managed to lock the vault before being handcuffed. The so-called detective placed a revolver to Eaton's head and said to him: [...] "Young man, <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> know my business at once. I want the money of this bank or I will blow your brains out." [...] Eaton told him to go ahead and a struggle ensued. The two compromised and Eaton, who was still in handcuffs, allowed the man to escape in exchange for his life. Eaton ran around Corning until he eventually found Patterson. By then, of course, the would-be robber escaped. Patterson offered a $100 reward for the assailant's arrest. Patterson was fortunate that he did not find his bank vault empty upon his return.|$|E

2500|$|Boat 13 was {{partially}} filled from the Boat Deck and partially from A Deck {{after it had}} been lowered to that level when it was launched {{under the supervision of}} Murdoch and Moody at 1:40a.m. Again, it was heavily occupied, with 65 people aboard and Leading Fireman Frederick Barrett in charge. The occupants were mainly Second and Third Class women and children. Among the men aboard was Lawrence Beesley, who subsequently wrote a popular book about the disaster. Dr. Washington Dodge was also aboard, having earlier seen his wife and young son aboard Boat 5. He owed his presence aboard the boat to the apparent guilty feelings of Steward F. Dent Ray, who had urged the Dodges to sail on Titanic in the first place. Just before Boat 5 was lowered, Ray bundled Dodge aboard. 12-year-old Second Class passenger Ruth Becker was placed in this boat by Moody after being prevented from entering the heavily overloaded lifeboat number 11 which her mother and two siblings had boarded. She {{was one of the few}} passengers who brought blankets from her stateroom into a boat, which were later used to keep stokers, who were wearing sleeveless shirts, warm while rowing. Others did not want to board at all. A woman on deck became hysterical, crying, [...] "Don't put me in that boat! I don't want to go in that boat! I've never been in an open boat in my life!" [...] Ray told her, [...] "You have got to go and <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> keep quiet." ...|$|E
