Jonze explained, [...] " [...] said he wanted to try to write everything he was thinking about in that moment – all the ideas and feelings at that time – and put it into the script. I was very inspired by that, and tried to do that in [...] And a lot of the feelings <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>about</b> relationships or about technology are often contradictory." ...|$|E
