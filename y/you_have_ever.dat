The series, created by ITV Studios, was green-lit on July 15, 2014, with Davis and Bailey being announced as co-hosts of the show.

500|$|Washington saw Tomjanovich {{running toward}} the altercation. Not knowing that he {{intended}} to break up the fight, Washington hit Tomjanovich with a roundhouse punch. The blow, which took Tomjanovich by surprise, fractured his face about one-third of an inch (8mm) away from his skull and left Tomjanovich unconscious {{in a pool of blood}} in the middle of the arena. Abdul-Jabbar likened the sound of the punch to a melon being dropped onto concrete. Tomjanovich had a reputation around the league as a peacemaker. Players involved say that right after Tomjanovich collapsed the absence of sound at the arena, which was filled with shocked fans, was [...] "the loudest silence <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> heard." [...] Reporters heard the sound of the punch all the way in the second floor press box, and some rushed to the playing floor in disbelief.|$|E

500|$|During Beyoncé's 2009 Las Vegas revue show, I Am... Yours, she {{performed}} the song {{live for the}} first time. Before performing the song, the singer described its meaning depth, stating: [...] "How many of <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> been lied to? I'm sure everyone has —we all have. But this next song is from my last album, B'Day. And I never performed this song before, this is especially for Encore It talks about a relationship after you've been lied to. And you're trying your best to forgive. But it's difficult because you never forget. It's called 'Resentment'." [...] She additionally included the song on the 2009 [...] as the ninth track of the DVD/CD's first disc. During a Thanksgiving TV Special, Beyoncé aired I Am... Yours in its entirety which also featured her performance of [...] "Resentment". Nate Chinen of The New York Times said, [...] "There's exactly one human-scale moment in the concert, when she sits at {{the lip of the}} stage to sing an acoustic treatment of 'Resentment,' from her album 'B'Day.' And even then she makes it a showstopper." ...|$|E
500|$|Rob McNichol at the United Kingdom's The Sun {{rated the}} event {{nine and a}} half out of ten, {{describing}} it as a [...] "flawless exercise in the booking, promotion and performance of a wrestling show... full of excitement, emotion and great wrestling". McNichol described Bryan's win in the [...] "very good" [...] opener as memorable and [...] "a great way to inspire the crowd, who would become so important during the night". He said of the Orton–Christian match, [...] "Christian’s character development was excellent" [...] and that while the audience were initially [...] "pro-Christian, {{who was supposed to be}} playing the heel" [...] (a villainous character), they eventually cheered Orton's post-match beatdown of Christian. McNichol described the main event as [...] "professional wrestling at [...] finest" [...] and [...] "probably the most gripping angle in wrestling this century". He said the audience's [...] "astonishing" [...] reception to the main event was as good as [...] "any major match <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> seen or cared about in history", and the match itself [...] "was methodical, played to both wrestlers' strengths, and was beautifully paced".|$|E
500|$|Each {{section is}} linked by a refrain or {{recurring}} chorus. It {{functions as a}} hook and it differs from the usual [...] "free-associative aspect" [...] of traditional blues. [...] Writer Benjamin Filene sees this and Dixon's desire to tell complete stories, with the verses building on each other, as sharing elements of pop music. [...] The chorus, [...] "But you know I'm here, everybody knows I'm here, Well you know I'm the hoochie coochie man, everybody knows I'm here", confirms the narrator's identity as both {{the subject of the}} gypsy's prophecy as well as an omnipotent seer himself. [...] Dixon felt that the lyrics expressed part of the audience's unfulfilled desire to brag, while Waters later admitted that they were supposed to have a comic effect. [...] Music historian Ted Gioia points to the underlying theme of sexuality and virility as sociologically significant. [...] He sees it as challenge to the fear of miscegenation in the dying days of racial segregation in the United States. [...] Record producer Marshall Chess took a simpler view: [...] "It was sex.

500|$|Chivers is {{best known}} for his {{association}} with Edgar Allan Poe and, in fact, it is through this relationship that Chivers and his work was rediscovered in the 20th century. The first interaction between the two was in 1840 though they did not meet until 1845 in New York. The two became friends and Chivers was willing to give Poe lifetime financial support if he moved to the South. Chivers appreciated Poe's ability and wrote that George Rex Graham was seriously underpaying Poe for his work on Graham's Magazine. [...] "He ought to give you ten thousand dollars a year... It is richly worth it... is greatly indebted to you. It is not my opinion that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> been, or ever will be, paid for your intellectual labours. You need never expect it, until you establish a Magazine of your own", he wrote, referring to Poe's plans to begin The Stylus. Even so, Chivers was concerned about Poe's reputation as a severe literary critic, cautioning him about [...] "when you tomahawk people". Poe, in fact, had been hoping Chivers would lend his wealth as a financial backer for The Stylus and possibly even serve as a co-editor in its early planning stages. Chivers considered Poe's proposal but was not able to accept because of the death of his three-year-old daughter just over a week later.|$|E

2500|$|Around 1202, {{he joined}} a {{military}} expedition against Perugia and was taken as a prisoner at Collestrada, spending {{a year as a}} captive. An illness caused him to re-evaluate his life. It is possible that his spiritual conversion was a gradual process rooted in this experience. Upon his return to Assisi in 1203, Francis returned to his carefree life. In 1205, Francis left for Apulia to enlist in the army of Walter III, Count of Brienne. A strange vision made him return to Assisi, having lost his taste for the worldly life. According to hagiographic accounts, thereafter he began to avoid the sports and the feasts of his former companions. In response, they asked him laughingly whether he was thinking of marrying, to which he answered, [...] "Yes, a fairer bride than any of <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> seen", meaning his [...] "Lady Poverty".|$|E
2500|$|In 1924, a {{new project}} to enlarge the organ began. Marcel Dupré and Charles M.

Use everything <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> dreamed about." [...] They were told there was no limit to the budget. This project resulted in, among other things, the celebrated String Division, which occupies the largest organ chamber ever constructed, 67 feet long, 26 feet deep, and 16 feet high. During this project, the organ's current console was constructed in Wanamaker's private in-house pipe-organ factory, with six manuals and several hundred controls. By 1930, when work on expanding the organ finally stopped, the organ had 28,482 pipes, and, if Rodman Wanamaker had not died in 1928, the organ would probably be even bigger.|$|E

At the par-5 17th hole with Nicklaus leading by the score of 1 up, Jacklin made a [...] eagle putt to square the match. With the entire competition outcome riding on this match, Nicklaus made a five-foot par putt on the last hole before controversially conceding Jacklin's par putt, ensuring that this game, and the overall match, ended in a tie.

2500|$|From 1922 to 1940, Stevens made {{numerous}} {{visits to}} Key West, Florida, where he generally lodged at the Casa Marina, a {{hotel on the}} Atlantic Ocean. He first visited in January 1922, while on a business trip. [...] "The place is a paradise," [...] he wrote to Elsie, [...] "midsummer weather, the sky brilliantly clear and intensely blue, the sea blue and green beyond what <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> seen." [...] The influence of Key West upon Stevens's poetry is evident {{in many of the}} poems published in his first two collections, Harmonium and Ideas of Order. In February 1935, Stevens encountered the poet Robert Frost at the Casa Marina. The two men argued, and Frost reported that Stevens had been drunk and acted inappropriately. The following year, Stevens allegedly assaulted Ernest Hemingway at a party at the Waddell Avenue home of a mutual acquaintance in Key West. Stevens broke his hand, apparently from hitting Hemingway's jaw, and was repeatedly knocked to the street by Hemingway. Stevens later apologized. In 1940, Stevens made his final trip to Key West. Frost was at the Casa Marina again, and again the two men argued.|$|E
