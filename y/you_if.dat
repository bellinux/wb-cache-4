5|$|In {{response}} to Clement's visit, moreover, the Pope had empowered the Bishops of Dunkeld, Brechin and St Andrews {{to take action}} to rescue the bishopric. He told these bishops that, Since the continual care of all the churches is our daily burden, we grant to the said Church , so far as we personally can, and authorise <b>you,</b> <b>if</b> you find the situation to be as described, to assign to the said Bishop, if it can be done without scandal, a quarter of the teinds of all the parish churches of the Diocese of Dunblane, so that under your guidance and that of upright men, he may set aside a suitable portion of them for his own maintenance, and thereafter assign revenues for a dean and canons whom we wish and authorise you to institute there. Failing this, the Pope wrote, The quarter teinds of all the churches of the Diocese assigned to the Bishop, which are held by laymen, you shall transfer with the episcopal seat to the Canons Regular of St. John in the Diocese , who shall have power to elect a Bishop in any vacancy.|$|E

25|$|This is {{something}} that a Muslim gynecologist can tell <b>you</b> <b>if</b> you need to or not… There {{used to be a}} lady who used to do this for women, or, I mean, young girls. She is expected to cut only the tip of the sexual sensitive part in the girl, so that she is not hypersexually active. This is the purpose... you see in societies where circumcision of girls is completely prohibited, hypersexuality takes over the entire society, and a woman is not satisfied with one person, or two, or three. This, God forbid, is now happening even in Muslim societies where they prohibit circumcision. They use a mistake in practice to prohibit the tradition, and they end up causing a lot of damage on the extreme side of the sexual life of the woman.|$|E
