2500|$|The duet {{part was}} {{and still is}} {{performed}} regularly on stage by Meat Loaf with his current featured female vocalist Patti Russo. However, with the passing years and the consequent greater maturity of both singers, their interplay during the coda has gradually taken on ironic overtones, if not overtly comedic ones, which were totally absent from the original album version. For example, in the 2007 show 3 Bats Live, after Russo sings [...] "After a while you'll forget everything, it was a brief interlude and a midsummer night's fling", Meat Loaf stops the band and asks her (half-sung, half-spoken): [...] "Why do you say this to me? Why do <b>you</b> <b>keep</b> <b>saying</b> these things to me every single night?", and she replies innocently (again half-sung): [...] "It's in the lyrics". More funny exchanges of the same kind occur during their other live duets, such as the famous Bat Out of Hell track [...] "Paradise by the Dashboard Light".|$|E

[...] Maxwell looked foolish; he wished to assert himself, but he did not know how. Ricker went on: [...] "Those charming little sarcasms and innuendoes of yours would have killed your article for really intelligent readers. They would have suspected a young fellow having his fling, or an old fool speaking out of the emptiness of his heart.

I ask you, how do you expect a woman to <b>keep</b> up what <b>you</b> call her {{sensibility}} when this sort of thing has happened to her about three times a week ever since she was seventeen? It used to upset me and terrify me at first. Then I got rather a taste for it. It came to a climax with Gregory: that was why I married him. Then it became a mild lark, hardly worth the trouble. After that I found it valuable once or twice as a spinal tonic when I was run down; but now it's an unmitigated bore.

5000|$|According to the band, {{the song}} {{addresses}} people who can't think for themselves. Williams told Spin: [...] "To {{me there was}} this thread throughout the album of wanting {{to be able to}} grow up and move forward. And when you do that in your life, there's always people that {{are going to try to}} hold you back. Or they're going to try to tell you, 'You don't need to do this, because this is the right way to go.' Or you don't need to grow up, because this or that. And it's about those people, and it's about not listening to that but listening to your heart, and what do you want out of life? Who do you want to be? Versus all this outside influence that I think we get so caught up in, especially in the age of the Internet and all the different opinions that we hear so loudly every day.". Williams explained to Kerrang! Magazine that the song is about [...] "embracing who you are, your differences and quirks."Some people wanna pull you down and say you're wrong," [...] she continued. [...] "But <b>you</b> <b>keep</b> fighting and <b>say,</b> 'No, this is who I am.'".|$|R
5000|$|As part of Adventure Ecology’s ARTiculate series, de Rothschild led a {{field trip}} {{expedition}} to Ecuador in 2007. The group spent time in the Ecuadorian rain forest, documenting the damage international oil companies had caused by drilling the vast oil reserves. In November 2011 de Rothschild and a small crew mounted an expedition to Brazil’s Amazon rainforest {{as part of the}} ARTiculate series, with the goal of better understanding and publicizing the effects of the controversial Belo Monte dam project. This expedition was supplemented by articles on Myoo.com and culminated in an art project developed with local children. When asked by Outside Magazine reporter Caty Enders about whether an expedition could make a difference in a pressing issue like the Belo Monte dam de Rothschild replied that [...] "it would be naïve to think that this mini art-based adventure into the Amazon is going to change what has been in motion for the last 36 years. But when you see someone in the road and they're dying, do <b>you</b> <b>keep</b> walking and <b>say,</b> Oh, they'll be dead soon?
