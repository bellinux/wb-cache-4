500|$|Following the match, Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier {{claimed he}} had a premonition that goalkeeper Dudek would be {{the hero of the}} final: [...] "I told Jerzy three days ago 'I can feel you will be the hero. You were too unlucky when we played them, today he was man of the match. But {{football}} can be like that. Sometimes you can be at the bottom and then be a hero again. I just had a feeling. I'm a great believer that when <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> attitude everything else follows. He had a good run after the World Cup but then he made some mistakes and we had to support him. The squad get on very well. There was no finger-pointing after that game. He has saved us before in games and we had to keep faith in him." [...] Houllier also praised Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson: [...] "I wished him the best in the Champions League because he represents the best in English football, he congratulated every Liverpool player after the final whistle and that shows that he is not just a great manager but a great man." ...|$|E
500|$|It {{has been}} noted {{generally}} that natural justice is a fundamental element {{of the rule of}} law. In administrative law, the two principles of natural justice, which constitute a framework for common law procedural rights, are the rule against bias (nemo iudex in causa sua, or [...] "no man a judge in his own cause") and the right to be heard (audi alteram partem, or [...] "hear the other side"). In the Australian case Gas and Fuel Corporation of Victoria v. Wood Hall Ltd. & Leonard Pipeline Contractors Ltd. (1978), the Supreme Court of Victoria said that the ideas underlying both principles are that of [...] "fairness and judgement only after a full and fair hearing given to all parties." [...] Speaking in Parliament on 24 November 1999, MP Toh See Kiat expressed the view that the Singapore legal system does apply the rules of natural justice, which he described thus: [...] "atural justice requires essentially two basic principles. One is that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to be heard and to explain your case, and, two, is the right to equal treatment. A right to have your case heard also means that there is a review." ...|$|E

2500|$|Aviva Chomsky (daughter of famed {{academic}} Noam Chomsky) in the Providence Journal {{suggests that}} Harry Potter is a parable on immigration rights, noting that US [...] "immigration, citizenship and naturalization laws are based explicitly on {{discrimination on the}} basis of national origin.

2500|$|In July 1959, Matos {{denounced the}} {{direction}} the revolution was taking by giving openly anti-communist speeches in Camagüey. This launched a months-long dispute between him and Castro, then Prime Minister of Cuba, When Castro replaced President Manuel Urrutia with the more radical Osvaldo Dorticós Torrado, Matos tendered his resignation {{in a letter to}} Castro. On 26 July, Castro and Matos met at the Hilton Hotel in Havana, where, according to Matos, Castro told him: [...] "Your resignation is not acceptable at this point. We still have too much work to do. I admit that Raúl [...] and Che [...] are flirting with Marxism... but you have the situation under control... Forget about resigning... But if in a while you believe the situation is not changing, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to resign." ...|$|E

2500|$|Tenpenny {{is quoted}} as saying, [...] "The anti-free-speech terrorists have voiced bomb threats and have {{threatened}} violence against venue owners and their families." [...] It was later revealed that one bomb threat actually came from an [...] "anti-vaccination advocate who was disturbed {{by the thought that}} Tenpenny’s event might not go ahead." [...] The pro-vaccination group Stop the AVN spokesman, John Cunningham, stated that he calls this a win for Australians: [...] "Australia should be proud that as a nation, {{we have the ability to}} recognise when someone is trying to mislead us, and react accordingly. Free speech in Australia does not mean <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to say anything you like without fear of criticism. Rather, anyone from politicians to health practitioners to journalists should be prepared to face vigorous criticism whenever they try and spread lies and, in this case, what amounts to ideologically driven rubbish." ...|$|E

5000|$|Chomsky's essay sparked an {{even greater}} controversy. Critics such as Pierre Vidal-Naquet {{attacked}} him not for defending the principle of freedom of speech, but for allegedly defending Faurisson personally against charges of anti-Semitism and upholding his work as historical inquiry:The simple truth, Noam Chomsky, is that you were unable to abide by <b>the</b> ethical maxim <b>you</b> <b>had</b> imposed. <b>You</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to say: my worst enemy <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to be free, on condition that he not ask for my death or that of my brothers. <b>You</b> did not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to say: my worst enemy is a comrade, or a [...] "relatively apolitical sort of liberal."
