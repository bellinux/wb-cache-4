5|$|Feynman was a keen popularizer {{of physics}} through both books and lectures, {{including}} a 1959 talk on top-down nanotechnology called There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom, and the three-volume {{publication of his}} undergraduate lectures, The Feynman Lectures on Physics. Feynman also became known through his semi-autobiographical books Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! and What Do <b>You</b> <b>Care</b> What Other People Think? and books written about him, such as Tuva or Bust! and Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman by James Gleick.|$|E

Anyone wrestling with creating a female character who is multifaceted and real needs only to study Veronica. We see many different sides, and there isn't any stereotyping.

500|$|Blakeman {{said that}} she read the book in a single sitting, before [...] "crying her eyes out". The film {{includes}} the themes of bullying, youth crime, domestic violence, unwanted pregnancy, and teenage angst. For Blakeman, April's [...] "heartbreaking journey in searching for her real mum is also about being brave enough to let love in." [...] Tom Sutcliffe, writing for The Independent, spoke {{of the limits of}} taboo themes in family dramas, and said the film's [...] "account of a life lived in care couldn't have had swearing, or casual drug use, and when a shadow fell over a child's bed at night, it wasn't the care-home manager coming to exercise some horrible , as it might have been in an adult drama". The film also addressed the theme of Asperger syndrome through the character of Poppy. The BBC claimed that Clark, who has the condition herself, was able to offer [...] "a unique take" [...] on the role. Steveson summarised the themes of the film, saying that [...] "At the centre of the story, Marion finds out that she loves this girl. And that is an amazing liberation when you discover someone more important to you than you are. That is what is incredible about becoming a parent – <b>you</b> <b>care</b> about your child more than <b>you</b> <b>care</b> about yourself." ...|$|E
500|$|The song {{begins with}} the sound of a finger-picked {{acoustic}} guitar, reminiscent of [...] "More Than Words" [...] (1991) by American rock band Extreme. The composition has an organic arrangement, devoid of any synths and sequencing, and only based on guitars and subdued strings. A number of chord changes happen throughout the song as Madonna sings the lyrics, accompanied by an interval gap after the end of each chorus with the line [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>care</b> for me". The bridge section portrays a combination between the harmonies and the guitars, as the key changes. [...] "One More Chance" [...] ends with a brief pause of Madonna's solo vocals, couple of guitar chords and then it dissipates with a final strung of a major chord on the instrument.|$|E

50|$|I Didn't Know <b>You</b> <b>Cared</b> is a British {{television}} comedy set in {{a working-class}} household in South Yorkshire in the 1970s, written by Peter Tinniswood loosely based upon his books A Touch of Daniel, I Didn't Know <b>You</b> <b>Cared</b> and Except You're a Bird. It was broadcast by the BBC in four series (seven episodes each in series 1, 3 and 4 and six in series 2) from 1975 to 1979.|$|R
500|$|... "Ike's Wee Wee" [...] {{raises the}} {{question}} of who really can be considered one's family. At first, Kyle's implicit idea is that family consists of [...] "those for whom we care that are related by blood". Based on this viewing of family, he no longer feels the need to help Ike when he learns that they are not related by blood. As the story progresses, Kyle questions his initial beliefs, and forms the episode's central moral by saying that [...] "Family isn't about whose blood you have. It's about who <b>you</b> <b>care</b> about." [...] Thus, Kyle's reformed view of family not only includes his adopted brother, but his friends as well. Kyle's questioning of his own morals has been likened to engaging in the dialectical Socratic method of inquiry.|$|E
500|$|In his {{biography}} of the author, Bare-Faced Messiah (1987), Russell Miller characterized Typewriter in the Sky as one of Hubbard's works which [...] "would come {{to be regarded as}} classics", along with Fear and Final Blackout. In a biography of Hubbard written by Kent State University professor Donald M. Hassler in The New Encyclopedia of Science Fiction (1988), he noted, [...] "Typewriter in the Sky (1940/1951), which anticipates plot gimmicks now popular among experimental metafictionists, ought to be taken seriously by the critics who will evaluate his strange genius". In a review upon the 1995 re-release of the book, Ann Patterson-Rabon of the Spartanburg Herald-Journal concluded: [...] "A short novel, 'Typewriter' is a perfect afternoon read: quick, fun and only as deep as <b>you</b> <b>care</b> to go." [...] Sandy Bauers of Knight News Service called the 1995 audio publication of the work [...] "swashbuckling fun".|$|E
500|$|On {{his return}} to St. James's Palace, Churchill's {{attention}} was drawn towards other matters, and to a fresh face at court. [...] "I beg you will let me see you {{as often as you}} can", pleaded Churchill in a letter to Sarah Jennings, [...] "which I am sure you ought to do if <b>you</b> <b>care</b> for my love..." [...] Sarah Jennings' social origins were in many ways similar to Churchill's – minor gentry blighted by debt-induced poverty. After her father's death when she was eight, Sarah, together with her mother and sisters, moved to London. As Royalist supporters (despite the fact that Sarah's great uncle, James Temple, was convicted of regicide), the Jennings' loyalty to the crown, like the Churchill's, was repaid with court employment, and in 1673 Sarah followed her sister Frances into the household of the Duchess of York, Mary of Modena, second wife to James, Duke of York.|$|E

500|$|The {{songs on}} the album are {{identical}} to those performed on Garland's 1961 album, Judy at Carnegie Hall, except Wainwright's album included [...] "Get Happy" [...] as a bonus track in the UK and on iTunes in the US. [...] "Hail from a golden era dotted with trolley cars, Cadillacs, and glitzy jazz clubs", the set list included more than 25 American swing tunes, jazz and pop standards, including two Rodgers and Hart classics ("This Can't Be Love", [...] "You're Nearer"), three from brothers George and Ira Gershwin ("Who Cares? (As Long as <b>You</b> <b>Care</b> for Me)", [...] "How Long Has This Been Going On?" [...] and [...] "A Foggy Day"), two from duo Howard Dietz and Arthur Schwartz ("Alone Together", [...] "That's Entertainment!"), Harold Arlen, Irving Berlin, Noël Coward and more. Wainwright performed the songs nearly identically to Garland, even [...] "flubb" [...] the lyrics purposely on [...] "You Go to My Head" [...] to mimic the mistake made by Garland years before.|$|E
500|$|Feynman devoted {{the latter}} half of his book What Do <b>You</b> <b>Care</b> What Other People Think? to his {{experience}} on the Rogers Commission, straying from his usual convention of brief, light-hearted anecdotes to deliver an extended and sober narrative. Feynman's account reveals a disconnect between NASA's engineers and executives that was far more striking than he expected. His interviews of NASA's high-ranking managers revealed startling misunderstandings of elementary concepts. For instance, NASA managers claimed that there was a 1 in 100,000 chance of a catastrophic failure aboard the shuttle, but Feynman discovered that NASA's own engineers estimated the chance of a catastrophe at closer to 1 in 200. He concluded that NASA management's estimate of the reliability of the space shuttle was unrealistic, and he was particularly angered that NASA used it to recruit Christa McAuliffe into the Teacher-in-Space program. He warned in his appendix to the commission's report (which was included only after he threatened not to sign the report), [...] "For a successful technology, reality must take precedence over public relations, for nature cannot be fooled." ...|$|E
500|$|In a less {{enthusiastic}} {{review for}} The New York Times, Jon Pareles felt West's innovative transfiguration of his music—with unrefined electronica and drill elements—was undermined by his distasteful lyrics and appropriation of 1960s civil rights slogans [...] "to his own celebrity or to bedroom exploits". In Robert Christgau's opinion, {{the combination of}} harsh rock and hip hop sounds on Yeezus was as bold as Public Enemy's music during the 1980s, but West's lyrics were grotesquely off-putting. [...] "He's wordsmith enough to insure that his sexist imagery {{is very hard to}} take", Christgau wrote in The Barnes & Noble Review, describing the album as an [...] "alt-rap also-ran". Chris Richards from The Washington Post found West's lyricism perhaps [...] "his least compelling" [...] yet and [...] "drunk on bitterness", while Alex Griffin of Tiny Mix Tapes described the record as [...] "a nebulous, dense, paranoid web of utterly unfiltered expression that's utterly or negligibly fascinating depending on how much <b>you</b> <b>care</b> about Yeezy". In The Times, Will Hodgkinson surmised that Yeezus could have been West's masterpiece had he not become [...] "so hopelessly self-important".|$|E

500|$|The album's {{characters}} {{include the}} [...] "Dogs", representing fervent capitalists, the [...] "Pigs", symbolising political corruption, and the [...] "Sheep", {{who represent the}} exploited. Croskery described the [...] "Sheep" [...] as being in a [...] "state of delusion created by a misleading cultural identity", a false consciousness. The [...] "Dog", in his tireless pursuit of self-interest and success, ends up depressed and alone {{with no one to}} trust, utterly lacking emotional satisfaction after a life of exploitation. Waters used Mary Whitehouse {{as an example of a}} [...] "Pig"; being someone who in his estimation, used the power of the government to impose her values on society. At the album's conclusion, Waters returns to empathy with the lyrical statement: [...] "You know that I care what happens to you. And I know that <b>you</b> <b>care</b> for me too." [...] However, he also acknowledges that the [...] "Pigs" [...] are a continuing threat and reveals that he is a [...] "Dog" [...] who requires shelter, suggesting the need for a balance between state, commerce and community, versus an ongoing battle between them.|$|E
500|$|... "All Mixed Up" [...] {{was well}} {{received}} by television critics. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club issued the episode a B+ grade, {{and felt that}} the episode was superior {{to those of the}} show's first season. He asserted: [...] "Cougar Town hasn't taken as big of a step up from season one to season two as it did from the first part of season one to the last part of season one. But the step from 'average' to 'good' was the easy part. Season two is the season where viewers are going {{to find out if the}} show has what it takes to make the small steps needed to get from 'good' to 'great'. There's every indication that it's on the way there in the premiere because it's finally started to wrestle with some of the knottier questions at its center." [...] HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall opined that the show averted from its original premise; [...] "It's become one of my favorite comedies, and whether <b>you</b> <b>care</b> about Aniston or not, tonight is a good time to sample it if you dismissed it last year because of the title, the original premise or some of those early episodes." ...|$|E
500|$|Goldsmith's {{party was}} the biggest spender on press {{advertising}} in the 1997 campaign; it spent {{three times as much}} as the Conservatives and five times as much as Labour on press adverts. Its media profile greatly eclipsed that of UKIP. Goldsmith also used his financial resources to deliver a videocassette to five million UK households in March 1997. This was a novel strategy in British politics, and was conceived as a way of reaching the electorate while bypassing the mass media. The packaging of the videocassette did not specify that it was produced by the Referendum Party but rather carried several slogans: [...] "The most important video you'll ever watch", [...] "The story the politicians don't want you to hear", and [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>care</b> about Britain, please pass this video on." [...] The 12-minute film, presented by the former That's Life! presenter Gavin Campbell, warned of a coming [...] "federal European super-state". In his analysis of the video, scholar David Hass argued that the film was deliberately designed to elicit fear in the viewer, something achieved through [...] "eerie sound effects", the image of a blue stain spreading across a map of Europe, and slow-motion shots of German Chancellor Helmut Kohl striding towards the screen. In Hass' view, the film [...] "manifestly reduced that complex issue of Europe to the lowest common denominator, and aimed to shock." ...|$|E
