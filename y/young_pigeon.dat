The feather's fundament was held to the swelling and would draw out the venom. However, if the swelling dropped and became black in appearance since it had taken in coldness, the physician had to be cautious when drawing the cold from the swelling. If it was too late to prevent, the physician would take the <b>young</b> <b>pigeon,</b> cut her open from breast to back, break her open and apply the pigeon (while still alive) over the cold swelling. The cupping therapy was an alternative method which was heated and then placed over the swellings. Once the sore was broken, the physician would apply Mellilot Plaister with Linimentum Arcei and heal the sore with digence.|$|E

[...] The Midrash deduced that God thus showed Abraham three kinds of bullocks, three kinds of goats, and three kinds of rams that Abraham’s descendants would need to sacrifice. [...] The three kinds of bullocks were: (1) the bullock that [...] would require the Israelites to sacrifice on the Day of Atonement ( [...] , Yom Kippur), (2) the bullock that [...] would require the Israelites to bring on account of unwitting transgression of the law, and (3) the heifer whose neck [...] would require the Israelites to break.

60|$|The {{nature of}} the bond is {{frequently}} quite obscure. M. Is. Geoffroy St. Hilaire has forcibly remarked that certain malconformations frequently, and that others rarely, coexist without our being able to assign any reason.

With respect to this latter case of correlation, I think it can hardly be accidental that the two orders of mammals which are most abnormal in their dermal covering, viz., Cetacea (whales) and Edentata (armadilloes, scaly ant-eaters, etc.), are likewise on the whole the most abnormal in their teeth, {{but there are so many}} exceptions to this rule, as Mr. Mivart has remarked, that it has little value.|$|E

The wonder grew when he began to find more young pigeons, all young birds almost of an age to have left the nest, and only one or two out of half a dozen with any flesh eaten.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{have used}} a {{scanning}} laser technique to measure in vitro changes in back vertex distance of chick and pigeon lenses. Enucleated eyes were dissected, leaving the lens naturally suspended by the ciliary body and intraocular muscles. Ray tracing techniques were {{used to measure the}} resting back vertex distance of the lenses by passing a laser beam through the lens and scanning it across the pupillary aperture. The pupil diameter was measured videographically. The measurements were repeated while the intraocular muscles were pharmacologically stimulated with increasing concentrations of either nicotine or carbachol. Drug stimulation caused changes in pupil diameter and changes in the back vertex distance of the lenses. These experiments were conducted on the eyes of <b>young</b> chicks, <b>young</b> <b>pigeons,</b> and on the eyes of three pigeons older than 10 yr. The lenses from the eyes of the old pigeons had the greatest resting back vertex distance, followed by those of the <b>young</b> <b>pigeons</b> and finally those of the young chicks. Lenses from the eyes of young chicks and <b>young</b> <b>pigeons</b> underwent similar drug-induced changes in back vertex distance, but the lenses from old pigeon eyes showed an almost complete absence of such changes. Further, we demonstrated that, just as in the chick eye, lenticular changes in pigeon eyes are due to a contraction of the iris muscle. This is evident because after the iris has been removed the lens undergoes no change in back vertex distance during stimulation. We conclude with a discussion of the lenticular accommodative ability of the pigeon eye with reference to the recently reported accommodative mechanism of the chick eye and a comparison of chick and pigeon iris morphology...|$|R

Live birds, carcasses, and equipment were targeted for sampling dur-ing the preslaughter, pre-evisceration, and posteviscera-tion stages of processing. The three trials represented 18 farms (1, 110 squab), 1 farm (250 squab), and 23 farms (2, 900 squab). The overall prevalence of positive samples in Trial 1 was 1. 4 % for Salmonella spp. and 11. 1 % for C. jejuni; in Trial 2, 4. 3 and 0 % for Salmonella spp. and C. jejuni; and in Trial 3, 4. 1 and 4. 8 % for Salmonella spp. and C. jejuni, respectively.

40|$|Pigeon circovirus (PiCV) is an {{immunosuppressive}} agent widespread throughout the world, which causes a disease in pigeons called <b>Young</b> <b>Pigeon</b> Disease Syndrome. The {{aim of the}} study was to evaluate the prevalence of PiCV in Poland and investigate the genetic diversity relative to other known PiCV isolates. Samples from 152 pigeon flocks (88 flocks of racing pigeons and 64 flocks of fancy pigeons) from various regions of Poland were tested by polymerase chain reaction and an approximately 326 -base fragment of the capsid protein gene (Cap gene) of the virus was amplified. The average viral prevalence was found to be 70. 3 % (76. 13 % in racing pigeons and 62. 5 % in fancy pigeons). Among the obtained positive samples, 21 were selected for sequencing and a phylogenetic analysis was performed. It was found that the majority of Polish PiCV isolates, to varying degrees, are related to isolates occurring in Europe.
