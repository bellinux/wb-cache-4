5|$|The main mode {{of play in}} the Guitar Hero {{games is}} Career Mode, where the player and in-game band travel between various fictional {{performance}} arenas and perform sets of four to six songs. It is by completing songs in this mode that the songs are unlocked for play across {{the rest of the}} game. Players can choose their on-stage character, their guitar of choice, and the venue in which they wish to play. In this mode, the player can earn money from his/her performances that is redeemable at the in-game store, where bonus songs, additional guitars and finishes, <b>your</b> <b>characters</b> clothing and bonus content can be unlocked. Quick Play mode is a quicker method of playing songs, as it allows the player to select a track and difficulty, selecting the character, venue, and guitar and guitar skin for the player based on the song chosen. After successfully completing a song, the player is given a score, a percentage of how many notes they hit and a rating from three to five stars, and two in rare cases depending on his/her final score on the song, with money being awarded in Guitar Hero World Tour.|$|E

[...] Brideshead, which questions the meaning of human existence without God, is the first novel in which Evelyn Waugh clearly presents his conservative religious and political views. In the LIFE magazine article, [...] "Fan Fare" [...] (1946), Waugh said that [...] "you can only leave God out [...] by making <b>your</b> <b>characters</b> pure abstractions" [...] and that his future novels shall be [...] "the attempt to represent man more fully which, to me, means only one thing, man in his relation to God." [...] As such, the novel Helena (1950) is Evelyn Waugh's most philosophically Christian book.|$|E

500|$|The aim {{of most of}} {{the stages}} in Dynasty Warriors 4 is to defeat the enemy commander. The player must make their way through the stage, {{defeating}} enemy officers and troops while trying to keep their own commander alive. Some stages have secondary objectives for the player to complete to make the stage easier, unlock new features, or help in later stages. [...] Each playable character has their own unique weapon and individual superhuman abilities. The scope of each stage allows for each side to have thousands of soldiers in the battlefield. The game uses a fairly simple combination system so that players can chain attacks together; the highest possible attack combo being 10.

500|$|Pool of Radiance was {{the first}} in a four-part series of {{computer}} D adventures set in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting. The others were released by SSI one year apart: Curse of the Azure Bonds (1989), Secret of the Silver Blades (1990), and Pools of Darkness (1991). The 1989 game Hillsfar was also created by SSI but was not a sequel to Pool of Radiance. Hillsfar is described instead, by the reviewers of Dragon, as [...] "a value-added adventure for those who would like to take a side trip while awaiting the sequel". A player can import characters from Pool of Radiance into Hillsfar, although the characters are reduced to their basic levels and do not retain weapons or magical items. Original Hillsfar characters cannot be exported to Pool of Radiance, but they can be exported to Curse of the Azure Bonds. A review for Curse of the Azure Bonds in Computer Gaming World noted that [...] "you can transfer <b>your</b> <b>characters</b> from Pool of Radiance and it's a good idea to do so. It will give you a headstart in the game." ...|$|E
500|$|He {{wished to}} set the film in a field he {{understood}} and opted for broadcast journalism. After talking with network journalists at the 1984 Republican National Convention, Brooks realised it had [...] "changed so much since I had been near it", and so [...] "did {{about a year and}} a half of solid research," [...] into the industry. When he began writing the screenplay, Brooks felt he [...] "didn't like any of the three [...] characters", but decided not to change them and after two months had reversed his original opinion. Brooks stated that this also happens to the audience: [...] "You're always supposed to arc <b>your</b> <b>characters</b> and you have this change and that's your dramatic purpose. But what I hope happens in this film is that the audience takes part in the arc. So what happens is that the movie doesn't select its own hero. It plays differently with each audience. The audience helps create the experience, depending on which character they hook onto." [...] He did not decide on the ending of the film until the rest of it had been completed. Brooks was nominated for the Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay for Broadcast News. At the 38th Berlin International Film Festival, the film was nominated for the Golden Bear and Holly Hunter won the Silver Bear for Best Actress.|$|E

500|$|On {{his return}} he was {{appointed}} captain of the 64-gun [...] on 20 August, still in an acting capacity. Monmouth {{had been one of}} the most mutinous ships of the whole fleet, and was heavily involved in the Nore mutiny. Walker took her to join Admiral Adam Duncan's fleet in the North Sea. Within a short time he was able to restore good order aboard her, and was able to play a significant role in the Battle of Camperdown on 11 October. As she approached the Dutch fleet Walker gathered the crew and addressed them saying 'My lads, you see your enemy; I shall lay you close aboard and give you an opportunity of washing the stain off <b>your</b> <b>characters</b> in the blood of your foes. Now, go to your quarters and do your duty.' During the battle Monmouth engaged the Dutch ships Delft and Alkmaar for an hour and a half, forcing both of them to surrender. Monmouth, which had lost five men killed and 22 wounded, took Alkmaar in tow, and despite sailing through a strong gale, reached the shelter of Yarmouth roads five days later. The battle was a decisive victory for the British over the Dutch, and Walker was among those captains rewarded, having his post rank confirmed on 17 October, and receiving the Naval Gold Medal and the thanks of parliament. He attended the service of thanksgiving at St Paul's Cathedral on 19 December, and assisted in depositing the captured enemy colours.|$|E
500|$|While {{reviews of}} the film were mostly {{positive}} (receiving an 83% rating on film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes), Mulholland Drive was not without its detractors. Rex Reed of The New York Observer {{said that it was}} the worst film he had seen in 2001, calling it [...] "a load of moronic and incoherent garbage." [...] In New York, Peter Rainer observed, [...] "Although I like it more than some of his other dreamtime freakfests, it's still a pretty moribund ride... Lynch needs to renew himself with an influx of the deep feeling he has for people, for outcasts, and lay off the cretins and hobgoblins and zombies for a while." [...] In The Washington Post, Desson Howe called it [...] "an extended mood opera, if you want to put an arty label on incoherence." [...] Todd McCarthy of Variety found much to praise—"Lynch cranks up the levels of bizarre humor, dramatic incident and genuine mystery with a succession of memorable scenes, some of which rank with his best"—but also noted, [...] "the film jumps off the solid ground of relative narrative coherence into Lynchian fantasyland... for the final 45minutes, Lynch is in mind-twisting mode that presents a form of alternate reality with no apparent meaning or logical connection to what came before. Although such tactics are familiar from Twin Peaks and elsewhere, the sudden switcheroo to head games is disappointing because, up to this point, Lynch had so wonderfully succeeded in creating genuine involvement." [...] James Berardinelli also criticized it, saying: [...] "Lynch cheats his audience, pulling the rug out from under us. He throws everything into the mix with the lone goal of confusing us. Nothing makes any sense because it's not supposed to make any sense. There's no purpose or logic to events. Lynch is playing a big practical joke on us." [...] Film theorist Ray Carney notes, [...] "You wouldn't need all the emotional back-flips and narrative trap doors if you had anything to say. You wouldn't need doppelgangers and shadow-figures if <b>your</b> <b>characters</b> had souls." ...|$|E

2500|$|This is at {{the heart}} of the tetralogy's achievement. Updike once said of the Rabbit books that they were an {{exercise}} in point of view. This was typically self-deprecating, but contains an important grain of truth. Harry's education extends no further than high school, and his view is further limited by a range of prejudices and a stubborn, combative spirit, yet he is the vehicle for a half-million-word meditation on postwar American anxiety, failure and prosperity. A mode had to be devised to make this possible, and that involved pushing beyond the bounds of realism. In a novel like this, Updike insisted, you have to be generous and allow <b>your</b> <b>characters</b> eloquence, [...] "and not chop them down to what you think is the right size." ...|$|E

2500|$|GameSpot's Bethany Massimilla {{scored the}} game 7.7 out of 10.

[...] However, she praised the graphics and sound, concluding [...] "The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age molds Middle-earth into a traditional turn-based frame, and while the results aren't all that great, the game carries some pretty good features and should appeal to fans of the source material." ...|$|E

2500|$|In these {{difficult}} times {{the one person}} who continuously provided moral support to Pisemsky was Ivan Turgenev. In 1869 he informed Pisemsky that his One Thousand Souls had been translated into German and enjoyed [...] "great success in Berlin". [...] "So now {{the time has come for}} you to step outside the borders of your motherland and for Aleksey Pisemsky to become a European name," [...] Turgenev wrote on October 9, 1869. [...] "The best Berlin critic, Frenzel, in National Zeitung devoted a whole article to you where he calls your novel 'a rare phenomenon', and I tell you, now you are well known in Germany," [...] wrote Turgenev in another letter, enclosing clips from other papers, too. [...] "The success of One Thousand Souls encourages [...] to start upon the novel Troubled Seas and I am so happy both for you and for Russian literature in general… Critical reviews of One Thousand Souls here in Germany are most favourable, <b>your</b> <b>characters</b> are being compared to those of Dickens, Thackeray, etc, etc", he continued. Julian Schmidt’s large article in Zeitgenossensche [...] Bilder, part of the series devoted to first class European authors, provided for Pisemsky another cause to celebrate, and following Turgenev's advice, in 1875 he visited Schmidt to thank him personally.|$|E

2500|$|Wide-scale {{growth in}} the {{religion}} across Sub-Saharan Africa was observed to begin in the 1950s and extend in the 1960s. After the conference in February 1953 Bill and Marguerite Sears arrived in September 1953 visiting from Johannesburg for an extended stay into October giving many classes and traveling to many villages. It was also during this time the first pioneer from Uganda went to Mwanza, Tanganyika. In 1954 Uganda had 500 Bahá'ís in 80 localities, including 13 Local Spiritual Assemblies, representing 30 tribes, and had dispatched 9 pioneers to other African locations. In 1955 there were over 800 Bahá'ís having just added seventeen assemblies. In 1956 Olinga was elected as Chairman of the North West regional Bahá'í National Spiritual Assembly and the Ugandan Bahá'í community came under the newly formed regional National Spiritual Assembly of Central & Eastern Africa, of which Nakhjavani was the Chairman and the Ugandan community alone topped 1000 members. The {{other members of the}} regional assembly over Uganda were Philip Hainsworth, Hassan Sabri, Oloro Epyeruj, Aziz Yazdi, Jalal Nakhjavani, Tito Wanantsusit, Sylvester Okurut, and Max Kenyerezi. In early 1957 Olinga attended the laying of the foundation stone of the first Bahá'í House of Worship of Africa (which was in Uganda) and in the fall he was appointed a Hand of the Cause and Knight of Bahá'u'lláh Clare Gung, formerly of Germany, moved from Tanganyika to Uganda where she founded a multi-racial kindergarten nursery. Systems were initiated to deal with the rate of growth of the religion - weekend Bahá'í schools were set up for any Bahá'í who could attend and individuals who were judged to have a substantial understanding of the religion and were able to travel were selected for training as presenters who would then travel locally in their area to make presentations on many of the same themes. By the summer of 1957 13 weekend schools had been held. It was believed these schools lent impetus to the continued growth of the religion in the area by empowering local members of the religion and the schools were repeated in 1958. And the same year regional and local assemblies were registered with the civil government. In 1957 a lone Bahá'í, a member of the Tesa, Yokolamu Okello, reached the relatively remote and pagan region of Moroto in Karamoja and in 1958 the first spiritual assembly was formed there. Conversions to the Bahá'í Faith in Uganda even reached into the prisons where Shoghi Effendi, then head of the religion, responded to letters by encouraging the inmates to use their [...] "stumbled" [...] history not to become [...] "embittered or defeated" [...] but [...] "determined to make it a means of purifying your natures, improving <b>your</b> <b>characters,</b> and enabling you to become better citizens in the future." [...] The quick growth of the religion in Uganda was attributed by Bahá'ís to the sincerity of their purpose and to the demonstrated lack of racial prejudice.|$|E
