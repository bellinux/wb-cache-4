500|$|Other {{characters}} include Kirstie Alley as Saavik, Spock's protégée and a Starfleet commander-in-training {{aboard the}} Enterprise. The movie was Alley's first feature film role. Saavik cries during Spock's funeral. Meyer said that during filming someone asked him, [...] "'Are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> her do that?' And I said, 'Yeah,' and they said, 'But Vulcans don't cry,' and I said, 'Well, that's {{what makes this}} such an interesting Vulcan.'" [...] The character's emotional outbursts can be partly {{explained by the fact}} that Saavik was described as of mixed Vulcan-Romulan heritage in the script, though no indication is given on film. Alley was so fond of her Vulcan ears that she would take them home with her at the end of each day. Bibi Besch plays Carol Marcus, the lead scientist working on Project Genesis, and the mother of Kirk's son, David (played by Merritt Butrick). Meyer was looking for an actress who looked beautiful enough that it was plausible a womanizer such as Kirk would fall for her, yet who could also project a sense of intelligence. Meyer liked that Butrick's hair was blond like Besch's and curly like Shatner's, making him a plausible son of the two. John Winston reprises his series role as Kyle, the Enterprise transporter chief now Commander Kyle aboard Reliant.|$|E
2500|$|Asquith {{was one of}} {{five people}} given a free pass by the Coalition but the East Fife Unionist Association defied {{national}} instructions and put up a candidate, Sprot, against him. Sprot was refused a Coalition [...] "coupon." [...] Asquith assumed his own seat would be safe and spent only two and half days there, speaking only to closed meetings; in one speech there on 11 December he conceded {{that he did not}} want to [...] "displace" [...] the current government. He scoffed at press rumours that he was being barracked by a gang of discharged soldiers. Postwar reconstruction, the desire for harsh peace terms, and Asquith's desire to attend the peace talks, were campaign issues, with posters asking: [...] "Asquith nearly lost you the War. Are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> him spoil the Peace?" [...] James Scott, his chairman at East Fife, wrote of [...] "a swarm of women going from door to door indulging in a slander for which they had not a shadow of proof. This was used for such a purpose as to influence the female vote very much against you." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> him {{go without}} doing anything?" [...] demanded Ralph. [...] "I'm sure you wouldn't {{if it was}} your deer!" [...] he added, bitterly.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, I {{really think}} I am," [...] replied Mrs. Vervain, playfully. [...] "Considering that <b>you</b> were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> me leave Venice without {{even trying to}} say good-by to me, I think I'm very good indeed." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Boys," [...] he said, [...] "if we {{stop here}} talking, there won't be {{much time left}} for a jag when we make the Butte. Are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> him bluff you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|When {{he spoke}} again {{his voice was}} less friendly, and he prodded Denton by way of address. [...] "Look see!" [...] he said: [...] "are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> me show you 'ow to scrap?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Now, Clarence, I am {{simply not}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>you</b> go in. You are sick enough as it is, and if <b>you</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> that awful old man {{spend the whole}} evening here, and drain {{the life out of}} you! I will see him, and tell him"-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It’s {{the mystery}} we don’t like," [...] said Brisket, at last. [...] "How {{are we to}} know what desperate venture <b>you</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> us in for? Follow you {{faithful}} we will, but we don’t like going in the dark; it ain’t quite fair to us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Little girl," [...] he said, [...] "you {{are very}} good to me, and I think you understand. Are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> me feel that I have found a friend on my first evening in London?" ...|$|E
6000|$|BARNABAS. Yes, do. There must be {{dozens of}} these people in existence. Are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> them do what the two who have just left us mean to do, and crowd us {{off the face of}} the earth? ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Maybe not. But I reckon I'll ask, anyhow. You {{want me to}} join your I.W.W., and I'm asking questions. Labor strikes--standing up {{for your}} rights--is one thing, and burning wheat or {{slugging}} young farmers is another. Are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> this Dorn go?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Charlie shot a {{quick look}} at his mother, who exclaimed, as if in spite of herself, [...] "Now, Alec, are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> that girl squander a fine fortune on all sorts of {{charitable}} nonsense and wild schemes for the prevention of pauperism and crime?" ...|$|E

6000|$|DAISY. [Violently.] Do <b>you</b> think I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>you</b> go so easily? Do {{you think}} I've done all I have <b>to</b> <b>let</b> you marry that silly little English girl? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sam," [...] says he, [...] "what's {{two hundred}} and fifty dollars, after all? We've got the money. One more night of this kid will send me to a bed in Bedlam.

"It's such a {{beautiful}} evening," [...] said Mara, [...] "and {{we are all in}} such good spirits about Moses's ship, and I told him you must come down and hold counsel with us as to what was to be done about the launching; and the name, you know, that is to be decided on--are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> it be called after you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why not? Are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> a {{man like}} Mr. Bonteen bowl you over? Did you ever know Lady Glen fail in {{anything}} that she attempted? She is preparing a secret with the express object of making Mr. Ratler her confidant. Lord Mount Thistle is her slave, but then I fear Lord Mount Thistle is not of much use. She'll do anything and everything,--except flatter Mr. Bonteen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, sir," [...] said Pinney, [...] "I don't {{know that}} that follows. My wife and myself talked that up a good deal at the time, and we {{concluded}} that it was about an even thing. You see it's pretty {{hard to believe that}} a friend is dead, even when you've seen him die; and I don't understand how people that lose friends at a distance can ever quite realize that they're gone. I guess that even if the ladies went upon the theory of the accident, there was always a kind of a merciful uncertainty about it, and that was my wife's notion, too. But that's neither here nor there, now, Mr. Northwick. Here you are, alive and well, in spite of all theories to the contrary--though they must have been pretty well exploded by your letter to the Events--and the question is what answer are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> me take back to your family? You want to send some word, don't you? My instructions were not to urge you at all, and I won't. But if I was in your place, I know what I should do." ...|$|E
