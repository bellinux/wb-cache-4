It has rained all day, {{and there was no}} walking. I read prayers to Sir Andrew Fountaine in the forenoon, and I dined with three Irishmen, at one Mr. Cope's(3) lodgings; the other two were one Morris an archdeacon,(4) and Mr. Ford. When I came home this evening, I {{expected}} that little jackanapes Harrison would have come to get help about his Tatler for Tuesday: I have fixed two evenings in the week which I allow him to come. The toad never came, and I expecting him fell a reading, and left off other business.--Come, what are you doing? How do you pass <b>your</b> <b>time</b> <b>this</b> ugly weather? Gaming and drinking, I suppose: fine diversions for young ladies, truly! I wish you had some of our Seville oranges, and we some of your wine. We have the finest oranges for twopence apiece, and the basest wine for six shillings a bottle. They tell me wine grows cheap with you. I am resolved to have half a hogshead when I get to Ireland, if it be good and cheap, as it used to be; and I will treat MD at my table in an evening, oh hoa, and laugh at great Ministers of State.|$|E

5000|$|The Mangler fared {{somewhat}} better with modern critics. Bloody Disgusting rated it 3/5 stars and {{wrote that the}} film [...] "is not good by any objective standards, but it’s a fun little gory time-killer with a possessed refrigerator and an evil laundry press. That can’t be all bad." [...] Jon Condit of Dread Central rated it 3.5/5 stars and wrote, [...] "The Mangler is a true test for the guilty pleasure connoisseur. Bad in every respect, there are definitely worse ways to blow two hours of <b>your</b> <b>time</b> (<b>this</b> film's sequel comes to mind); it's just a shame Hooper was implicated in it." [...] Mike Long of DVD Talk rated it 0.5/5 stars and wrote, [...] "There have been many bad, throw-away projects based on material from Stephen King, but The Mangler {{has to be one}} of the worst. The movie's laughable premise is only brought down by the inept filmmaking on display here." [...] David Johnson of DVD Verdict wrote that the film [...] "features a lot of gore, a solid, creepy atmosphere, some wonky special effects, all set against a really dumb premise." ...|$|E
