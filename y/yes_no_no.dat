50|$|In Spanish, {{the words}} sí (<b>yes)</b> and <b>no</b> (<b>no)</b> are {{unambiguously}} classified as adverbs: {{not only do}} they serve as answers to questions; they also modify verbs. The affirmative sí can replace the verb after a negation (Yo <b>no</b> tengo carro, pero él sí = I dont own a car, but he does) or intensify it (I dont believe he owns a car. / He does own one! = <b>No</b> creo que él tenga carro. / ¡Sí lo tiene!). The word <b>no</b> is the standard adverb placed next to a verb to negate it (Yo <b>no</b> tengo carro = I dont own a car). Double negation is normal and valid in Spanish, and it is interpreted as reinforcing the negation (<b>No</b> tengo ningún carro = I own <b>no</b> car).|$|R

She {{knew that he was}} asking her to consent to the sacrifice, and he knew that she was imploring him to spare her. This was not what Madame Voss had meant by {{speaking}} softly. Could she have been allowed to dilate upon her own convictions, or had she been able adequately to express her own ideas, she would have begged that there might be <b>no</b> sentiment, <b>no</b> romance, <b>no</b> kissing of hands, <b>no</b> looking into each other's faces,--no half-murmured tones of love. Madame Voss believed strongly that the every-day work of the world was done better without any of these glancings and glimmerings of moonshine. But then her husband was, by nature, of a fervid temperament, given to the influence of unexpressed poetic emotions;--and thus subject, in spite of the strength of his will, to much weakness of purpose. Madame Voss perhaps condemned her husband in this matter the more because his romantic disposition never showed itself in his intercourse with her. He would kiss Marie's hand, and press Marie's wrist, and hold dialogues by the eye with Marie. But with his wife his speech was,--not exactly yea, yea, and nay, nay,--but <b>yes,</b> <b>yes,</b> and <b>no,</b> <b>no.</b> It was not unnatural therefore that she should specially dislike this weakness of his which came from his emotional temperament.
