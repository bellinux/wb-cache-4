500|$|Washington's party reached Fort LeBoeuf on December 11, in {{the middle}} of a raging snowstorm. [...] The French commander, Captain Jacques Legardeur de Saint-Pierre, {{received}} them with hospitality; however, in response to Dinwiddie's demands, he pointed out that the letter was more properly addressed to his superior, New France's governor the Marquis Duquesne. [...] The letter Legardeur drafted in response to Dinwiddie's was clear and to the point: [...] "as to the summons <b>you</b> <b>send</b> <b>me</b> to retire, I do not think myself obliged to obey it." [...] Washington took careful notes of the military arrangements at both forts before departing on December 16. [...] He was somewhat concerned by the fact that Tanacharison and his men remained behind for further discussions with the French; he wrote, [...] "I saw that every strategem which the most fruitful brain could invent, was practiced to win Half King to their interest". [...] He returned to Williamsburg after a month of difficult travel. [...] Dinwiddie had Washington's account of the expedition widely distributed to emphasize the French threat. It was printed on both sides of the Atlantic, giving Washington an international reputation.|$|E

Over dinner, Washington presented Saint-Pierre with the letter from Dinwiddie demanding an immediate French withdrawal from the Ohio Country. Saint-Pierre said, [...] "As to the Summons <b>you</b> <b>send</b> <b>me</b> to retire, I do not think myself obliged to obey it." [...] He told Washington that France's claim to the region was superior {{to that of the}} British, since Ren√©-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle had explored the Ohio Country nearly a century earlier.|$|E
