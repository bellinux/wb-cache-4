500|$|Besides Wait Till Your Father Gets Home (1972–1974) and Hong Kong Phooey (1974), Nichola Dobson {{wrote in}} The A to Z of Animation and Cartoons that Help!... It's the Hair Bear Bunch! {{was one of}} Hanna-Barbera's more {{successful}} shows. However, in The Encyclopedia of Guilty Pleasures: 1001 Things <b>You</b> <b>Hate</b> <b>to</b> Love, three different authors labeled the series as one of Hanna-Barbera's [...] "lesser-known efforts" [...] but ultimately called it a [...] "guilty pleasure" [...] and enjoyed that it had its own score. In a retrospective view of older cartoons, the staff at MeTV included the show on their list of [...] "15 Forgotten Cartoons from the Early 1970s You Used to Love". Deirdre Sheppard from Common Sense Media rated it three out of five stars and noted that it has [...] "no educational content"; however, she also said that [...] "other than the mildest of mild violence, and the characters' tendency to poke fun at each other, the series is fun and inoffensive".|$|E
500|$|In May 1970, Clancy {{was traded}} by the Dolphins to the Green Bay Packers for tight end Marv Fleming. [...] Clancy had begun a {{business}} selling {{real estate in}} Miami during the offseason, {{but he also had}} ties to Green Bay. [...] He had attended St. Matthew's Grade School there in the 1950s. [...] Clancy expressed mixed emotions about the trade: [...] "I don't like to leave Miami. [...] <b>You</b> <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> have to pick up and move and I definitely plan to come back (to Miami) in the offseason. [...] But most of my dad's family are still up in Green Bay. [...] He's always wanted me to play for the Packers." [...] Clancy was greeted as the first Green Bay native to play for the Packers since Wayland Becker in 1938. [...] Wisconsin columnist Lee Remmel said Clancy [...] "surveys the football scene with a pair of cool, calculating blue eyes and a computer-type mind." ...|$|E
500|$|Mirror's Edge has {{received}} mostly positive reviews, with score aggregator Metacritic reporting scores of 81/100 for the PC version and 79/100 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions. Official Xbox Magazine gave the game 9.5 out of 10, praising its [...] "brilliant sense of motion and gameplay". Play awarded it 9 out of 10, while GameTrailers.com gave it 8.3 out of 10. Computer and Video Games was also positive, calling it [...] "A brilliant and unique experience, {{even if the}} small shooting parts aren't quite up to scratch." [...] IGN awarded the game 8.3 out of 10, calling it a [...] "thrilling and stylish venture", but [...] "the first chapter of a franchise that's still finding its feet." [...] GameSpot praised the immersive gameplay environments, but criticised the inconsistency of gameplay speed. Ian Bogost of Gamasutra commended the game for being unconventional, calling it [...] "a shooter that makes <b>you</b> <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> shoot".|$|E

2500|$|Hillel the Elder [...] {{formulated}} {{a version}} of the Golden rule: [...] "What is hateful to you, do not do unto others." [...] (Talmud, tracate Shabbat 31a; Midrash Avot de Rabbi Natan.) [...] Rabbi Akiva, a 1st-century CE rabbi, [...] states [...] "Whatever <b>you</b> <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> have done unto you, do not do to your neighbor; wherefore do not hurt him; do not speak ill of him; do not reveal his secrets to others; let his honor and his property be as dear to thee as thine own" [...] (Midrash Avot deRabbi Natan.) ...|$|E

60|$|There {{was nothing}} exaggerated or unintelligible in the poets now. They {{ceased to be}} {{inhabitants}} of another world, swayed by curiously complex emotions. They were her brothers--ordinary men with ordinary feelings and a strange gift for expressing them. She knew {{now that it was}} possible <b>to</b> <b>hate</b> the man <b>you</b> loved and to love the man <b>you</b> <b>hated,</b> <b>to</b> ache for the sight of someone even while you fled from him.|$|R
5000|$|President William Howard Taft named Lehmann as United States Solicitor General in 1910. In the Supreme Court of the United States Lehmann {{established}} {{the right to}} tax corporation incomes. He considered national bank affiliates to be illegal. About Lehmann's oral arguments, Justice Louis Brandeis said: [...] "He was so eloquent, <b>you</b> <b>hated</b> <b>to</b> rule against Lehmann; you felt as though you were ruling against God." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One didn't," [...] Flora pointed out. [...] "A knife-thrust, {{like the}} one you avoided, or a pistol-shot would have obviated any risk they ran. But of course <b>you</b> <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> be thanked." ...|$|E
6000|$|Lucy {{stopped him}} with a gesture. [...] "We {{are not going to}} talk about the sawmill. It was your--I mean our--troubles Jake plunged into, and pluck that can't be daunted is better than genius. But you're an English Borderer and {{therefore}} half a Scot; <b>you</b> <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> let people guess your feelings." ...|$|E

"I {{know that}} you have all engaged in this affair for love of Sir Marmaduke or myself, and because <b>you</b> <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> see a loyal gentleman made the victim of lying knaves; {{but when we come back}} with the king, you may be sure that Sir Marmaduke and I will well reward the {{services}} you have rendered." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You see, {{the fates}} against whom {{you have so}} great a {{grievance}} have done something to atone," [...] she declared. [...] "No doubt <b>you</b> <b>hated</b> <b>to</b> leave your work to come and speak {{to me in the}} street that afternoon. No doubt your red-headed journalist friend hated me also. Yet if you had not come, if my automobile had been detained a few minutes on the way--ah! it is terrible indeed to think what might not have happened!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Turner looked dubious. [...] "Well, {{you know}} Ike Harkey. He {{looks as though}} sugar wouldn't melt in his mouth, but I tell <b>you</b> I'd <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> have dealin's with him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I won't tell <b>you.</b> I <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> {{think of}} it. And I tell you, the Lord {{only knows what}} we may see tomorrow, if that poor fellow holds out as he's begun." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps you didn't. It {{was your}} Scottish reserve that made <b>you</b> <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> {{talk about your}} family affairs; but Jim, who counts you as his partner, has told me something. Then I don't mind telling you that I like you and admire what {{you are trying to}} do. However, we'll keep to the point.

I ain't any more an' haven't been for a long time; but before I took a tumble to myself I'd have hated you, Bridge. I'd a-hated your fine talk, an' your poetry, an' the thing about you that makes <b>you</b> <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> touch a guy for a hand-out.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is well {{to confess}} all sins before the Eucharist, and I will confess mine. I have been unjust to you.

They did say you was faint-hearted, but I never thought to see the like of that in a thing that called itself a man." [...] And so saying, she took herself off.|$|E
6000|$|She {{suddenly}} {{broke into}} laughter, and ejaculated: [...] "Say, {{that was hard}} work! Don't <b>you</b> <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> have to be serious? Let's trot down, and I'll make Tom or Duncan rush us a growler of beer to welcome you to our midst.... I'll bet your socks aren't darned properly.

Why do you seek to keep me, then? Let me gang back--let me gang back to the friends I have, and that like me!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, there's no hurry," [...] he said lazily. [...] "Life {{is rather}} a long affair--if you live. There {{appears to be}} plenty of time, though people say not, and I {{think it would be}} rather odious to make every day of use. Let a few of them go by without doing {{anything}} for you!

6000|$|... "Nay, m'dear," [...] he said gently, [...] "'tis not ten {{thousand}} lives that call to me to-day... only one at best.... Don't <b>you</b> <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> {{think of that}} poor little old cure sitting {{in the midst of}} his ruined pride and hopes: the jewels so confidently entrusted to his care, stolen from him, he waiting, perhaps, in his little presbytery for the day when those brutes will march him to prison and to death....

I don't believe there's {{a man on the}} ship that wouldn't feel personally flattered to know that you liked being here. Even that poor fellow who parted from us at Messina was anxious that you should think as kindly of him as you could. He knew that he had behaved in a way to shock you, and he was very sorry. He left a message with me for you. He thought you would like to know that he was ashamed of himself." ...|$|E
