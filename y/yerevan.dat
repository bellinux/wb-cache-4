On 28 August 1999, the first Pan-Armenian Games began in <b>Yerevan.</b> Over 1,400 Armenian athletes from 23 countries {{participated in the}} games. The closing ceremony {{took place in the}} <b>Yerevan</b> Sports and Concerts Complex on September 5, with President Robert Kocharyan and Vazgen Sargsyan in attendance. Just after the Games, which involved thousands of diaspora Armenian youth, the preparations for the eighth anniversary of Armenia's independence began.|$|E

5|$|Numerous {{streets and}} squares {{both inside and}} outside Armenia, {{including}} in Córdoba, Argentina, Plovdiv and Varna in Bulgaria, Meudon, Paris and a section of Connecticut Route 314 state highway running entirely within Wethersfield, Connecticut are named after Andranik. General Andranik Station of the <b>Yerevan</b> Metro was opened in 1989 as Hoktemberyan Station and was renamed for Andranik in 1992. In 1995, General Andranik's Museum was founded in Komitas Park of <b>Yerevan,</b> but was soon closed because the building was privatized. It was reopened on 16 September 2006, by Ilyich Beglarian as the Museum of Armenian Fedayi Movement, named after Andranik.|$|E
5|$|St. Toros Manuscript Library, {{founded in}} 1897, holds 3,890 {{inventoried}} and cataloged Armenian manuscripts, {{making it the}} second largest in the world, after the Matenadaran in <b>Yerevan,</b> Armenia. In 1931, the number of cataloged manuscripts stood at 2,720.|$|E

5|$|A second air {{transport}} incident occurred {{the following day}} at <b>Yerevan</b> (capital of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic) when an Antonov An-12 from Yugoslavia crashed, killing all seven crew on board. The crash was blamed on the pilots' failure to properly adjust the altimeter following a miscommunication with the air traffic controllers.|$|E
5|$|Antananarivo has {{established}} sister city agreements with four cities. The city was twinned with <b>Yerevan,</b> Armenia in 1981. The city is also twinned with Vorkuta, Russia; Suzhou, China; and Montreal, Quebec, Canada. A sister city relationship between Antananarivo and Nice, France, established in 1962, is not currently active.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} February 1919, Andranik {{was ready}} to leave Zangezur. Gibbon {{suggested}} Andranik and his soldiers leave by Baku-Tiflis railway at Yevlakh station. Andranik rejected this plan and on 22 March 1919, he left Goris and traveled across Sisian through deep snowdrifts to Daralagyaz, then moved to the Ararat plain with his few thousand irregulars. After a three-week march, his men and horses reached the railway station of Davalu. He was met by Dro, the Assistant Minister of Military Affairs and Sargis Manasian, the Assistant Minister of Internal Affairs, who offered {{to take him to}} visit <b>Yerevan,</b> but he rejected their invitation as he believed the Dashnak government had betrayed the Armenians and was responsible for the loss of his homeland and the annihilation of his people. Zangezur became more vulnerable to Azerbaijani threats after Andranik left the district. Earlier, before Andranik's and his soldiers' dismissal, the local Armenian forces had requested support from <b>Yerevan.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1998, the Central Bank of Armenia issued 50-dram {{banknotes}} depicting Khachaturian's portrait and the <b>Yerevan</b> Opera Theater on the obverse and {{an episode}} from the ballet Gayane and Mount Ararat on the reverse. It remained in use until 2004 {{when it was}} replaced by a coin. He is the only composer to be depicted on Armenian currency.|$|E
5|$|Khachaturian died in Moscow on 1 May 1978, {{after a long}} illness, {{just short}} of his 75th birthday. He was buried at the Komitas Pantheon in <b>Yerevan</b> on 6 May, next to other {{distinguished}} Armenians. He was survived by his son, Karen, and daughter, Nune, and his nephew, Karen Khachaturian, {{who was also a}} composer.|$|E
5|$|On {{the day of}} the robbery, 26 June 1907, the 20 organizers, {{including}} Stalin, met near <b>Yerevan</b> Square (just 2 {{minutes from}} the seminary, bank and viceroy's palace) to finalize their plans, and after the meeting, they went to their designated places in preparation for the attack. The Russian authorities had become aware that some large action was being planned by revolutionaries in Tiflis, and had increased the security presence in the main square; just prior to the robbery, they had been tipped off and were guarding every street corner in <b>Yerevan</b> Square. To deal with the increased security, gang members spotted patrolling gendarmes and police prior to the robbery and lookouts were posted looking down on the square from above.|$|E
5|$|Such was {{the degree}} and {{scale of the}} requisitioning and terror imposed by the local Cheka that in February 1921 the Armenians, led by former leaders of the republic, rose up in revolt and briefly {{unseated}} the communists in <b>Yerevan.</b> The Red Army, which was campaigning in Georgia at the time, returned to suppress the revolt and drove its leaders out of Armenia.|$|E
5|$|The 65 page manuscripts of General Andranik, {{the only}} known memoir written by him, were {{returned}} to Armenia in May 2014 {{and sent to the}} National History Museum in <b>Yerevan</b> through Culture Minister Hasmik Poghosyan, almost a century after Andranik had parted with them.|$|E
5|$|The {{day of the}} National Flag of Armenia {{is marked}} on 15 June every year. The day is chosen {{for the reason that}} the Armenian law on the National Flag of Armenia was passed on 15 June 2006. The day of the Armenian tricolour was celebrated {{for the first time on}} 15 June 2010 in <b>Yerevan.</b>|$|E
5|$|With the {{collapse}} of the Transcaucasian Federation, the Armenians were left to fend for themselves as the Turkish army approached the capital of <b>Yerevan.</b> At first, fearing a major military defeat and massacre of the population of Armenia, the Dashnaks wanted to evacuate the city of <b>Yerevan.</b> Instead, the Military Council headed by Colonel Pirumian decided that they would not surrender and would confront the Turkish army. The opposing armies met on May 28, 1918, near Sardarapat. The battle was a major military success for the Armenian army as it was able to halt the invading Turkish forces. The Armenians also stood their ground at the Battle of Kara Killisse and at the Battle of Bash Abaran. The creation of the First Republic of Armenia was proclaimed on the same day of the Battle of Sardarapat, and the ARF became the ruling party. However, the new state was devastated, with a dislocated economy, hundreds of thousands of refugees, and a mostly starving population.|$|E
5|$|<b>Yerevan</b> Square, {{where the}} robbery took place, was renamed Lenin Square by the Soviet {{authorities}} in 1921, {{and a large}} statue of Lenin was erected in his honor in 1956. Despite being convicted of the bloody robbery, Kamo was originally buried and had a monument erected in his honor in Pushkin Gardens, near <b>Yerevan</b> Square. Created by the sculptor Iakob Nikoladze, it was removed during Stalin's rule, and Kamo's remains were moved to another location. The statue of Lenin was torn down in August 1991—one of the final moments of the Soviet Union—and replaced by the Liberty Monument in 2006. The name of the square was changed from Lenin Square to Freedom Square in 1991.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the power}} {{struggle}} after Stalin's death in 1953, Nikita Khrushchev {{emerged as the}} country's new leader. In a secret speech he gave in 1956, Khrushchev denounced Stalin and his domestic policies largely loosened the government's grip over the country. Khrushchev put more resources into the production of consumer goods and housing. Almost immediately, Armenia underwent a cultural and economic rebirth. Religious freedom, to a limited degree, was granted to Armenia when Catholicos Vazgen I assumed the duties of his office in 1955. One of Khrushchev's advisers and close friends, Armenian Politburo member Anastas Mikoyan, urged Armenians to reaffirm their national identity. In 1954, he gave a speech in <b>Yerevan</b> where he encouraged them to republish the works of writers such as Raffi and Charents. The massive statue of Stalin that towered over <b>Yerevan</b> was pulled down from its pedestal by troops literally overnight and replaced in 1962 with that of Mother Armenia. Contacts between Armenia and the Diaspora were revived, and Armenians from abroad began to visit the republic more frequently.|$|E
5|$|In 1956 Mikoyan helped Khrushchev {{organize}} the Secret Speech, which Khrushchev {{delivered to the}} 20th Party Congress, that denounced Stalin's personality cult. It was he, and not Khrushchev, who made the first anti-Stalinist speech at the 20th Congress. Along with Khrushchev, he helped roll {{back some of the}} stifling restrictions on nationalism and culture imposed during Stalin's time. In 1954, he visited his native Armenia and gave a speech in <b>Yerevan,</b> where he encouraged Armenians to republish the works of Raffi and the purged writer Yeghishe Charents.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, the <b>Yerevan</b> Studio {{produced}} a TV documentary film on Khachaturian. In 2003, an 83-minute-long documentary about Khachaturian with unique footage {{was directed by}} Peter Rosen and narrated by Eric Bogosian. The film won the Best Documentary at the 2003 Hollywood Film Festival. In 2004, TV Kultura, Russia's government-owned art channel, made a documentary on Khachaturian entitled Century of Aram Khachaturian (Век Арама Хачатуряна).|$|E
5|$|In May 2016, {{during his}} visit to <b>Yerevan,</b> FIDE President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov said that, after talking to the Armenian Chess Federation {{chairman}} Serzh Sargsyan (also President of Armenia), he heard no refusal about their participation. The vice-president of the Armenian Chess Federation Smbat Lputian responded that Armenia was still discussing the matter and had not decided on the matter yet. In July 2016, Lputian announced that (based upon discussion within the federation) the Armenian chess team would not participate in the Chess Olympiad.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to its parliamentary seats, the following governmental ministries were also headed by ARF members: Ministry of Agriculture, Davit Lokian; Ministry of Education and Science, Levon Mkrtchian; Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, Aghvan Vardanian; Ministry of Healthcare, Norair Davidian. On July 13, 2007, the ARF History Museum was inaugurated in <b>Yerevan,</b> displaying {{the history of the}} party and of its notable members.|$|E
5|$|On 20 February 1988, the Nagorno-Karabakh Supreme Council (the {{regional}} legislature) {{issued a}} request to transfer the region from Soviet Azerbaijan to Soviet Armenia. The Moscow government declined the claims, while {{hundreds of thousands of}} people demonstrated in <b>Yerevan</b> in support of the idea. Few days later, on 26 February, an anti-Armenian pogrom broke out in the Azerbaijani seaside industrial city Sumgait, forcing thousands of Armenians to leave Azerbaijan en masse.|$|E
5|$|On 28 October 1999, President Kocharyan {{declared}} a three-day mourning period. The state funeral ceremony {{for the victims}} of the parliament shooting took place from 30 October to 31 October 1999. The bodies of the victims, including Vazgen Sargsyan, were placed inside the <b>Yerevan</b> Opera Theater. A number of high-ranking officials from some 30 countries, including Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and the Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze, attended the funeral. Karekin II, the Catholicos of All Armenians and Aram I, the Catholicos of the Holy See of Cilicia, gave prayers.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} attack, {{hundreds}} of policemen and army forces personnel and two {{armored personnel carriers}} were brought into <b>Yerevan,</b> positioned on Baghramyan Avenue surrounding the National Assembly building. An anti-terrorist squad from Russia also participated in the operation. Meanwhile, ambulance vehicles rushed {{to the site of}} the shooting. President Robert Kocharyan was directing the operation of the security forces around the parliament building. While holding around 50 hostages inside the building, the men demanded a helicopter and airtime on national television for a political statement.|$|E
5|$|The conspirators {{took over}} the Tilipuchuri tavern facing the square in {{preparation}} for the robbery. A witness, David Sagirashvili, later stated that he had been walking in <b>Yerevan</b> Square when a friend named Bachua Kupriashvili, who later {{turned out to be one}} of the robbers, invited him into a tavern and asked him to stay. Once inside the tavern, Sagirashvili realized that armed men were stopping people from leaving. When they received a signal that the bank stagecoach was nearing the square, the armed men quickly left the building with pistols drawn.|$|E
5|$|The renovations of Etchmiadzin {{continued}} {{during the}} 18th century. In 1720, Catholicos Astvatsatur and then, in 1777–83 Simeon I of <b>Yerevan</b> took actions in preserving the cathedral. In 1770, Simeon I established a publishing house near Etchmiadzin, {{the first in}} Armenia. During Simeon's reign, the monastery was completely walled and separated {{from the city of}} Vagharshapat. Catholicos Ghukas (Lukas) continued the renovations in 1784–86.|$|E
5|$|The {{structure}} {{of government in}} the Armenian SSR was identical {{to that of the}} other Soviet republics. The highest political body of the republic was the Armenian Supreme Soviet, which included the highest judicial branch of the republic, the supreme court. Members of the Supreme Soviet served for a term of five years, whereas regional deputies served {{for two and a half}} years. All officials holding office were mandated to be members of the Communist Party and sessions were convened in the Supreme Soviet building in <b>Yerevan.</b>|$|E
5|$|Vazgen Sargsyan {{was born}} in Ararat village, Soviet Armenia, near the Turkish border, on 5 March 1959, to Greta and Zaven Sargsyan. After {{finishing}} secondary school in his village, he attended the <b>Yerevan</b> Institute of Physical Culture from 1976 to 1979. He worked as a physical education teacher at the secondary school in Ararat from 1979 to 1983. Therefore, he was exempt from conscription in the Soviet army. From 1983 to 1986, he was the Young Communist League (Komsomol) leader at the Ararat Cement Factory.|$|E
5|$|In September 1937 Stalin {{dispatched}} Mikoyan, {{along with}} Georgy Malenkov and Lavrentiy Beria, {{with a list}} of 300 names to <b>Yerevan,</b> the capital of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic (ASSR), to oversee the liquidation of the Communist Party of Armenia (CPA), which was largely made up of Old Bolsheviks. Mikoyan tried, but failed, to save one from being executed during his trip to Armenia. That person was arrested during one of his speeches to the CPA by Beria. Over a thousand people were arrested and seven of nine members of the Armenian Politburo were sacked from office. In several instances, he intervened on behalf of his colleagues; this leniency towards the persecuted may have been one reason why he was selected by Stalin to oversee the purges in the ASSR.|$|E
5|$|In late May 1988, amid rising {{nationalist}} tensions from glasnost and perestroika, Armenia's new Communist {{party leader}} allowed the banned tricolour of the DRA {{to fly in}} <b>Yerevan</b> {{for the first time}} in over sixty years. A year later, following a Nagorno-Karabakh-themed mass demonstration where the tricolour was flown, he urged its official recognition. This came on August 24, 1990, a day after the Armenian Supreme Soviet declared the republic's sovereignty and renamed the country the Republic of Armenia. At that point, just over a year before Armenia declared its formal independence from the USSR, the tricolour replaced the 1952 flag.|$|E
5|$|The French {{arrived in}} Armenia {{in the late}} evening on Friday, December 9 and {{relieved}} the exhausted Armenian workers who then returned to <b>Yerevan.</b> Japan sent a monetary gift of $9 million while Italy had {{plans to build a}} prefabricated village for the victims, and West Germany offered to send more than a dozen heavy cranes. The Americans donated generously as well, with Washington dispatching eight official planeloads of official relief aid plus a Lockheed C-141 Starlifter from Italy. Private donations from the United States were also significant. Chrysler chairman Lee Iacocca arranged for a fund drive, and in Chicago (one of five major Armenian population centers in the US) the community raised $800,000 and donated 20,000 pounds of supplies.|$|E
5|$|The world responded {{rapidly to}} the {{disaster}} in Leninakan and Spitak, {{with much of}} Europe sending cargo aircraft loaded with medical supplies, rescue equipment, and trained personnel {{to assist in the}} recovery, and even more reinforcement came in from Latin America and the Far East. Mikhail Gorbachev was in New York on his first day of visits with Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush {{at the time of the}} earthquake, and once the scale of the disaster was realized, a quick departure was made back to Armenia, with the Kremlin formally asking for American help. Washington immediately responded with offers of doctors, medical equipment, and rescue teams, and by the first weekend the first US plane arrived in <b>Yerevan</b> with search and rescue teams and detection dogs.|$|E
