25|$|By {{the will}} of my {{commander}} in chief, I have come to release the ownership over the Talysh regions {{from the hands of}} the Persians and therefore must take Lankaran. Knowing you are a valiant and prudent leader, I consider it necessary to warn that your resistance will be in vain. Even though you may be a great military leader, but you are no better than Abbas Mirza, who lost at Aslanduz and with that ten thousand soldiers, 500 men as prisoners, all the banners, weapons of which the troops don't have to their disposal right now. As it was at Aslanduz, where here barely escaped along with the 20th horsemen regiment and fled to Tabriz, while he had thirty thousand men at his disposal, and we had just two thousand men. Warriors of the great almighty in the world the Russian emperor crashed Abbas Mirza to pieces, and now they are located here, at the Talysh Khanate. So, when Abbas Mirza could not resist our victorious weapons, despite the fact that his troops outnumbered ours by fifteen times, you reflect that you won't be able either to inflict us a mortal blow here; so I suggest that <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> voluntarily surrender the fortress to avoid harmful and unnecessary bloodshed, sparing both Abbas Mirza's as well as my warriors. Consider of what you will reach by following sanity, namely saving lives, dignity, and both your property and all affiliated parties' properties in this conflict; otherwise, you will lose everything, if you won't attend the voice of common sense. But it is my duty to tell you, as you will be the one to choose; only I shall be justified in front of God and humanity. I'm ordered not to bombard yet by this letter until I receive response and receipt within three hours.|$|E

Confiscated {{from its original}} owners, the German authorities permitted [...] to reopen under the directorship of Belgian editor Raymond de Becker, although it remained firmly under Nazi control, supporting the German war effort and espousing anti-Semitism. After joining [...] on 15 October, Hergé created its new children's supplement, [...] Appointed editor of this supplement, he was aided by old friend Paul Jamin and the cartoonist Jacques Van Melkebeke. The first issue of [...] was published with a large announcement across the cover: [...] "Tintin et Milou sont revenus!" [...] ("Tintin and Snowy are Back!"). Some Belgians were upset that Hergé was {{willing to work for}} a newspaper controlled by the occupying Nazi administration; he received an anonymous letter from [...] "the father of a large family" [...] asking him not to work for , fearing that The Adventures of Tintin would now be used to indoctrinate children in Nazi ideology, and that as a result [...] "They will no longer speak of God, of the Christian family, of the Catholic ideal... can <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> collaborate in this terrible act, a real sin against Spirit?" [...] Hergé however was heavily enticed by the size of s readership, which reached 600,000, far more than what Le Vingtième Siècle had been able to accomplish. Faced with the reality of Nazi oversight, Hergé abandoned the overt political themes that had pervaded much of his earlier work, instead adopting a policy of neutrality. Without the need to satirise political types, Harry Thompson observed that [...] "Hergé was now concentrating more on plot and on developing a new style of character comedy. The public reacted positively." ...|$|E
2500|$|Australian quadruple Olympic {{gold medal}} winning swimmer Dawn Fraser called for Australia {{to boycott the}} games event, citing fears of a tragedy similar to that which {{unfolded}} in the Munich Olympics of 1972. Fraser pronounced that reports of missed construction deadlines and other irregularities in games planning meant Indian authorities' [...] "word for providing security {{should not be taken}} at its face value." [...] However, the Australian Commonwealth Games Organising Committee was quick to dismiss Fraser's fears with ACGA chief executive, Perry Crosswhite saying he believed there will be no security issues during the games event. John Coates, Australia's Olympic chief, came down hard on the organisers, alleging teams were being forced to temporary accommodation at hotels. [...] "I don't think it is a cultural thing. When <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> host , you are required to provide the basics in terms of health and hygiene for the athletes. The Games shouldn't have been awarded to Delhi in hindsight." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Certainly, dearest. I {{promised that}} before <b>you</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> be mine. My reputation--what is it! Perhaps I shall be dead and {{forgotten}} {{before the next}} transit of Venus!' ...|$|R
6000|$|Laura hesitated, {{and then}} gave him her hand. [...] "After all, I {{think you want to}} help, and if <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> leave Frank alone--" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I am, Mr. Fogg," [...] was the answer. [...] "I believe <b>you</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> accept six dollars. If {{you will}} make out a receipt for the amount I will give you Doctor Wallington's check." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly; and law is an {{invention}} to enforce it. It is right I should {{do exactly what}} my grandfather <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> do for me, five-and-twenty years ago, in relation to these mills; and it is right you should do what <b>you</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> do, for yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But you did {{not think}} it was wrong when <b>you</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> come, at our last meeting," [...] said the young man, with that {{persistent}} logic which exasperates the inconsequent feminine mind. [...] "It cannot be any more wrong to-day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'For example,' {{said the}} Emperor. 'It {{is one of}} my whims that when a man enters my service I shall marry him to whom I like. Do <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> that?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, you can't see her unless <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> our terms," [...] said Arnold Baxter decidedly. [...] "If {{we bring}} her up now she {{may try to}} get away from us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Paid subordinates! What! {{you are my}} paid subordinate, are you? Oh yes, I had {{forgotten}} the salary! Well then, on that mercenary ground, will <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> let me hector a little?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{just as you}} say," [...] Fulkerson cheerfully assented. [...] "I {{understand}} <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> {{the general}} principle of a little dinner?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "If {{you promise}} not to let his thoughtlessness {{distress}} you, my love, I {{promise not to}} speak to him about it. Do <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> that bargain? If you do, give me a kiss." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is no {{question}} about persuadin' that idiotic squire to give all hands a few hours' liberty, if <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> return here as soon as the performance is ended," [...] the manager began.|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't {{understand}} navigation, I fancy, Master Burns," [...] said Swinton to Paul, [...] "but {{as you can}} set broken bones, {{and things}} of that sort, we will spare you if <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> serve us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Hush!' said Clennam, {{smiling and}} {{touching}} her lips with his hand. 'Forgetfulness in you who remember so many and so much, would be new indeed.

6000|$|Mrs. Hardy {{had long}} {{suspected}} that an attachment had sprung {{up between the}} Irishman and her servant, so she only smiled and said, [...] "Well, Sarah, {{and what did you}} say to Terence?

6000|$|There was a groan of execration {{from the}} {{interior}} of the vehicle, a hysterical little shriek, and one or two shrill expressions of feminine disapprobation, but the driver moved not. At last a masculine head expostulated from the window: [...] "Look here; <b>you</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> take us to the house. Why, it's a mile away at least!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "According to {{the plan}} I have formed we should be back in less than ten days {{from the time we}} begin the journey, and if <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> the scheme it should make us all wealthy." ...|$|E
60|$|MRS. H. I {{tell you}} quite plainly: I will only consent to holding my tongue about her, if <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> Hornblower being told. It's a scandal {{to have a}} woman {{like that in the}} neighbourhood.|$|E
60|$|I {{hope that}} <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> that reasoning; for by it I think we arrive most surely at {{a belief in}} the unity of the human race, and that the Negro is {{actually}} a man and a brother.|$|E
6000|$|... "You are {{the last}} person living who has any right to say that. Oscar is in a false {{position}} towards Lucilla, with your knowledge and consent. In your brother's interests, <b>you</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> the fraud that has been practiced on her. In your brother's interests, again, you are asked to leave Dimchurch. Why do you refuse?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{been looking}} into accounts, Judson," [...] Wannop began abruptly. [...] "After {{deducting}} your commission {{and the cost of}} the repairs <b>you</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>to,</b> I find that the return on my property for the past year is small. Now I met Maxwell the other day and he hinted that it might be managed to better advantage." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Bideawhile shouldn't {{have asked}} <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> {{anything}} in my absence,' said Squercum indignantly. 'It was a very unprofessional thing on his part, and so I shall take an opportunity of telling him.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he resumed, [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> my proposition, we'll get {{a lawyer}} to fix it up. In a way, it's some relief to know Helen has enough, and now I'm {{going to talk to}} her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! father," [...] {{returned}} the boy, remonstratively, [...] "you are severe. However, I will take one, if <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> leave your woollen comforter behind. You won't need that, you see, {{as long as}} I am with you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There needn't be any {{confusion}} {{to speak}} of. <b>You</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> {{a number of}} rules and conventions and laws, for social purposes. But in private you feel just as you do feel, without occasion for trying to feel something else." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So I had supposed. It is a {{privilege}} for which <b>you</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> pay a certain price, and now it seems you have been guilty of filching something back. It seems so, I say. For I cannot think but that the arrest was inadvertently effected, {{and that it will}} suffice that I draw your attention to the matter of Master Leigh's detention." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hasn't it though, really? That's so {{good of you}} again! Now {{the truth}} is--but it's pretty nearly just what I told you that day after dinner, when <b>you</b> <b>agreed,</b> <b>you</b> know, <b>to</b> what we had done." ...|$|R
