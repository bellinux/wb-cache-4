[...] Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian called its music [...] "savvy R with a gloss <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>check</b> your reflection in", but ultimately observed [...] "a lack of both memorable tunes and the steely spined ardour that makes Beyoncé so compelling." [...] Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine was ambivalent towards {{its use of}} sampling on certain songs, but praised [...] "the mix of organic, old-school instrumentation and more electronic elements", which he felt make it [...] "a loose, fun and reverent record." [...] In MSN Music, Robert Christgau gave the album an [...] "honorable mention" [...] and deemed Knowles [...] "privilege's child" [...] who [...] "runs through her options" [...] in a defiant but frothy manner, while naming [...] "Would've Been the One" [...] and [...] "I Decided" [...] as highlights.

Suppose {{you know that}} there exists some real number x with p(x)=0 (for instance if n is odd and a'n is non-zero, then p(−M) and p(M) have opposite sign for sufficiently large absolute values of M, and then, because of the intermediate value theorem, there exists a root in between). The only possible rational roots of this polynomial equation are of the form r/s where r is a divisor of a0 and s is a divisor of a'n; there are only finitely so many such candidates <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>check</b> by hand. If neither of them is a root of p, then x must be irrational. For example, this technique can be used to show that x=(21/2+1)1/3 is irrational: we have (x3−1)2 = 2 and hence x6−2x3−1=0, and this latter polynomial does not have any rational roots (the only candidates to check are ±1).|$|E

"Hotel California" [...] and its lyrics {{have become}} {{absorbed into the}} wider culture around the world, and {{have been used by}} various writers and {{commentators}} to reflect on issues ranging from politics to social media and welfare, or as an observation on a particular situation.

Basic principal of ultrasonic distance measurement is based on ECHO. When sound waves are transmitted in environment then they return back to the origin as ECHO after striking on any obstacle.
