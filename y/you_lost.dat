There'd be {{stretches}} of surfaced roads and often there'd be a cycle path or a pavement and sometimes a thin stretch of something smoother. But you never knew where was best to ride and you were for ever switching about. You could jump your bike up on to a pavement but that got harder the more tired you got. Then you'd get your front wheel up but not your back wheel. That happened to me. And then you'd go sprawling, of course, and you could bring other riders down. Or they'd fall off and bring you down with them. And the cycle paths were often just compressed cinders, which got soft {{in the rain and}} got churned up by so many riders using them and then you got stuck and <b>you</b> <b>lost</b> your balance. And come what may, you got covered in coal dust and other muck. No, it's all changed and you can't compare then and now.|$|E
500|$|According to Josh Tyrangiel of Time magazine, {{the meaning}} to [...] "Talk" [...] {{is based on}} how Martin [...] "wants to teach us how to feel better about ourselves, and his lessons have the moral superiority {{disguised}} as sensitivity that marked Bono's mighty mullet period." [...] Tyrangiel interpreted the lyrics, [...] "Are <b>you</b> <b>lost</b> or incomplete/ Do {{you feel like a}} puzzle, you can't find your missing piece/ Tell me how you feel", with Martin begging in the song.|$|E

500|$|Another {{recurrent}} {{theme in}} the album is that everything is broken, out of place or missing; This is apparent in nearly all songs in the album. Examples include [...] "Fix You" [...] ("When you lose something you can't replace") and also in [...] "X" [...] ("When something is broken, {{and you try to}} fix it, trying to repair it, any way you can") and [...] "Talk" [...] ("Are <b>you</b> <b>lost</b> or incomplete? Do you feel like a puzzle, you can't find your missing piece?"). This theme is also reflective of the random, incomprehensible pattern on the album's cover (until you [...] "fix" [...] it using the Baudot Code).|$|E

Nina Bertok of Rip It Up, an Adelaide street press magazine, called the album a collection of [...] "tear-jerking ballads... pop nuggets... dance bangers" [...] and [...] "quirkier numbers". Bertok recommended the CSS remix of [...] "Buttons" [...] and awarded the compilation three out of five stars. One reviewer from the Sydney Star Observer wrote that [...] "Breathe Me" [...] stands as Sia's best song but thought her songs [...] "Don't Bring Me Down" [...] and [...] "I'm in Here" [...] should have been included on the album.|$|E
60|$|Why {{there should}} be more joy over the repenting sinner than over the just man who needs no repentance, we cannot explain in words: but our hearts tell us that it is true, beautiful; that it is reasonable, though we can give no reason for it. You know that if <b>you</b> had <b>lost</b> a sheep; if <b>you</b> had <b>lost</b> a piece of money; if you had had a child run away from you, it would be far more {{pleasant}} to find that thing which <b>you</b> had <b>lost,</b> than never to have lost it at all. You do not know why. God tells you that it is a part of his image and likeness in you; that you rejoice over what <b>you</b> have <b>lost</b> and found again, because God rejoices over what he has lost and found again.|$|R

500|$|Lansky was {{disappointed}} with the track, and wrote in his Idolator article that [...] "Aura" [...] consisted of all [...] "the best and worst things about Lady Gaga amplified"; it was [...] "weird and frustrating and great and terrible and brilliant and a failure all at once". Umema Aimem of The Washington Post criticized the song's lyrics: [...] "The song actually started out well ... but then <b>you</b> <b>lost</b> me when you proceeded to turn such a sacred symbol of [...] into an exotic costume". Mark Hogan of Spin called it [...] "a grasping EDM mess" [...] and [...] "all over the place"; he disliked the burqa lyrics, [...] "along with plenty of moments that bring to mind all the 'blog house' producers following {{in the path of}} Crystal Castles or Simian Mobile Disco circa 2007". Max Kessler of Paper gave [...] "Aura" [...] a lukewarm review; the song had [...] "all the classic Gaga attributes", including [...] "controversial and mildly clever lyrics set to a throbbing, almost-grating dance beat that's at times great and at times horrible". Its lyrics were controversial, with some Muslims accusing Gaga of degrading the burqa by sexualizing it. According to Aimem, [...] "Auras lyrics imply that women want to flirt with men; this contradicts Gaga's previous song, [...] "Monster", in which she condemns date rape.|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} music critics. While analyzing [...] "Unapologetic Bitch" [...] and [...] "Bitch I'm Madonna", Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote that [...] "their titles suggesting vulgarity, their execution flinty and knowing," [...] and also picked [...] "Unapologetic Bitch" [...] {{as one of}} the album's highlights. Kitty Empire of The Guardian noted that the songs on Rebel Heart with the word [...] "bitch" [...] in the title [...] "bode well", expressing that [...] "Unapologetic Bitch" [...] is even better than [...] "Bitch I'm Madonna", where [...] "Diplo lays Madonna down over some dancehall. Santigold was doing similar things in ’08, but the method remains sound." [...] Annie Zaleski of The A.V. Club also noticed that it [...] "resembles watered-down Santigold." [...] Amy Pettifer of The Quietus applauded the line, [...] "you never really knew how much you loved me till <b>you</b> <b>lost</b> me", calling it [...] "the killer nugget of this track," [...] which she labelled [...] "icked good," [...] while Time's Jamieson Cox thought that it was [...] "fun to hear Madonna deliver a line like, 'It might sound like I’m an unapologetic bitch / but sometimes you know I gotta call I like it is' because she has three’ decades worth of unapologetic bitchiness in her back pocket. It’s an easy score, sure, but it’s effective." [...] Lewis Corner of Digital Spy called it [...] "brilliant", while Lee DeVito [...] of Metro Times called it [...] "one of the more enjoyable tracks" [...] on the album.|$|E

[...] "Ladies, how would you keep your man if <b>you</b> <b>lost</b> your vagina?," [...] O'Neal would ask of his audience. When the women would invariably reference oral and anal sex, the comedian would respond, [...] "See, I gave you the chance to talk and you qualified yourself as a series of holes."
