5000|$|......The Answer to Both <b>Your</b> <b>Questions</b> <b>is</b> a 1996 EP by Something for Kate. The album {{reportedly}} title {{came from}} the bands' frontman Paul Dempsey asking a friend for suggestions for what to name the EP. His response was, [...] "The answer to both <b>your</b> <b>questions</b> <b>is</b> 'Porn'". Although Dempsey didn't take this advice, he thought the answer was [...] "a good title".|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, dear, no! <b>your</b> <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> {{so easily}} answered. I never {{encouraged}} {{the doctor to}} speak of my brother and his wife. The subject was too distasteful to me--and I don't doubt that Doctor Benjulia felt about it as I did." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Ask not; <b>your</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> agony!" [...] She {{tried to}} {{withdraw}} her hand, he pressed it with renewed energy, it remained in his, {{she turned away}} her head, and both were silent.|$|E

5000|$|Avatars such as IKEA's Anna have {{generated}} interest {{both in the}} business community and among the public. The idea of an artificial intelligence able to respond in an intelligent manner to <b>your</b> <b>questions</b> <b>is</b> indeed an exciting one. However, do these bots really manage it?

6000|$|... "By no means. My only {{difficulty}} in answering <b>your</b> <b>question,</b> <b>is</b> {{the difficulty of}} explaining myself. May I trust to your patience, if I refer once more to Mr. Candy's illness: and if I speak of it this time without sparing you certain professional details?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sure enough, brother Cap, <b>your</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> {{more easily}} put than answered. Is there {{no such thing}} as {{figuring}} it out by navigation? I thought you salt-water mariners were able to do as small a thing as that. I have often read of their discovering islands, surely." ...|$|E
6000|$|The Altrurian {{thought a}} moment. [...] "With us {{there is so}} little {{ambition}} for distinction, as you understand it, that <b>your</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> hard to answer. But I should say, speaking largely, that it was some man who had been able for the time being to give the greatest happiness to the greatest number-- some artist or poet or inventor or physician." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Caroline," [...] said Mr. Helstone, {{bringing}} his hand slowly down to {{within an inch}} or two of the table, and then smiting it suddenly on the mahogany, [...] "understand this: it is vulgar and puerile to confound generals with particulars. In every case there is the rule and there <b>are</b> the exceptions. <b>Your</b> <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> stupid and babyish. Ring the bell, if you have done breakfast." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're {{right to}} put it {{as if we had}} a big bill to pay, but, as I've told you before, <b>your</b> <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> rather terrible. They come, these mere {{exercises}} of genius, to a great sum total of poetry, of philosophy, a mighty mass of speculation, notation, quotation. The genius is there, you see, to meet the surrender; but there's no genius to support the defence." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{answer to}} <b>your</b> <b>question</b> may <b>be</b> there," [...] he said. [...] "Read the letter while {{you have the}} chance. And if I can advise you, say so at once." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{does not}} advance you much in your inquiry," [...] he went on. [...] "And in truth <b>your</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> unanswerable; but facts {{have a certain}} {{positive}} value, and I will tell you a fact. One day I met a cornered man. I use the word because it expresses the man's situation exactly, and because you just used it yourself. You know what that means?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Doubtless, and--pardon me if I say it--slay you as he slew your cousin, {{for he is}} a fine swordsman, who {{has studied}} the art in Egypt, where it is understood, and your {{strength}} would not avail against him. But <b>your</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> already answered, for though the prince would be glad enough to fight you, Sakon will have none of it. Have you nothing else to ask me, King?" ...|$|E
60|$|What are {{relevant}} ways {{depends upon the}} nature and purpose of the instrument. In {{the case of a}} weather-cock, the direction of the wind is relevant, but not its strength; {{in the case of the}} boy, the meaning of the words of <b>your</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> relevant, but not the loudness of your voice, or whether you are his father or his schoolmaster If, however, you were a boy of his own age, that would be relevant, and the appropriate response would be different.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well, darling: so I will. Perhaps {{you were}} right. As to <b>your</b> <b>question,</b> we <b>were</b> not obliged to prove anything. That was their business. Anyhow {{we are living}} together." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Truly, sir," [...] replied Rochecliffe, [...] "you {{found me}} {{but in my}} duty as a clergyman, interring the dead; and {{respecting}} answering <b>your</b> <b>questions,</b> I <b>am</b> determined myself, and do advise my fellow-sufferer on this occasion"-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Chug-a-rum!" [...] said he. [...] "You and <b>your</b> <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> a nuisance, Peter Rabbit, and I may as {{well get}} rid of you now as to have you keep coming down here and pestering me to death. Besides, any {{one who has to}} keep such a sharp watch for Reddy Fox as you do ought to know why he wears a red coat. If you'll promise to sit {{perfectly}} still and ask no foolish questions, I'll tell you the story." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is I {{who will}} answer you," [...] she said. [...] "My adopted son--for {{he is my}} adopted son if I choose to make him so--will explain nothing. He has, in fact, nothing more to say to you. You and he are quits so far as regards obligations. Your paths in life lie apart. You {{are one of the}} self-centred, {{sedentary}} loiterers by the way. For him," [...] she added, throwing out suddenly her brown, withered hand, aflame with jewels, [...] "there lie different things. Something he knows; something he has learned; much there is yet for him to learn. He will go on his way, undisturbed by you or any friends of yours. As for his means, <b>your</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> an impertinence. Ask at Rothschilds concerning the Comtesse de Vestignes, and remember that what belongs to me belongs to him. Measure your wits against his, to-day, to-morrow, or any time you choose, and the end is certain. Show your patron out, Bertrand. He has amused me for a little time, but I am tired." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As I am {{the only}} other {{unmarried}} man on board, Colonel, <b>your</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> somewhat pointed. No; I hope there {{may be one of}} these days, but I don't {{think that it would be}} fair to ask her here, where I am her host, and she is under the glamour of the sea. I doubt whether she has the slightest idea of what I want. That is the worst of being very old friends; the relations get so fixed that a woman does not recognise that they can ever be changed. However, I shall try my luck one of these days. I don't think that I shall meet with any serious opposition on her mother's part, if Bertha likes me, but I know that Lady Greendale has very much more ambitious views for her, and has quite set her mind upon her making a good match. No doubt she has a right to expect that she will do so. However, I think she is too fond of Bertha to thwart her, however disappointed she might feel. At present I don't think that she has any more suspicion than Bertha herself of my intentions." ...|$|E

5000|$|Fantasia Diamond is a text {{adventure}} game by Kim Topley {{and published}} by Hewson Consultants.

5000|$|In December 2013, {{she moved}} to New York because Russian {{authorities}} had begun to talk about taking children away from gay parents. In March, [...] "the St Petersburg legislator Milonov who had become {{a spokesman for the}} law ‘homosexual propaganda' towards children started mentioning me and my ‘perverted family’ in his interviews," [...] and Gessen contacted an adoption lawyer asking [...] "whether I had reason to worry that social services would go after my family and attempt to remove my oldest son, whom I adopted in 2000." [...] The lawyer told Gessen [...] "to instruct my son to run if he is approached by strangers and concluding: ‘The answer to <b>your</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> at the airport.’" [...] In June 2013, Gessen was beaten up outside of the Parliament [...] "and I realised that in all my interactions, including professional ones, I no longer felt I was perceived as a journalist first: I am now a person with a pink triangle." [...] She stated that [...] "a court would easily decide to annul Vova's adoption, and I wouldn't even know it." [...] Given this potential threat to her family, Gessen [...] "felt like no risk was small enough to be acceptable," [...] she later told the CBC. [...] "So we just had to get out." [...] In a January 2014 interview with ABC News, Gessen said that the Russian gay propaganda law had [...] "led to a huge increase in antigay violence, including murders. It's led to attacks on gay and lesbian clubs and film festivals...and because these laws are passed supposedly to protect children, the people who are most targeted or have the most to fear are LGBT parents." ...|$|E
