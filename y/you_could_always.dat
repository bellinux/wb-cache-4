They became the uniform of the era, with the added bonus of that whatever you bought, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>always</b> get accessories to match.|$|E
500|$|In February 2011, {{music video}} blog Yes, We've Got a Video! ranked both the marching band video and the Rube Goldberg machine video at number 3 in their top 30 videos of 2010. The latter in {{particular}} was praised for [...] "the cleverness {{of it and the}} fact that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>always</b> pick up something new upon each and every view." ...|$|E
500|$|Scottish {{mezzo-soprano}} Karen Cargill summarized [...] "Maria Radner, {{my beloved}} friend" [...] in The Guardian: [...] "She {{was the most}} generous-spirited person I have ever met. Hysterical laughter, an obsession with all things Burberry, unadulterated passion for Bayern Munich and the warmest of hugs were things <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>always</b> be guaranteed of when you were with her. Her son and partner were her whole life." [...] Further down Cargill qualified the latter, in that [...] "Music was Maria's entire life until she met her partner and they had their son." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let me help," [...] {{she cried}} eagerly. [...] "You have another {{typewriter}} {{in the corner}} there. I can work it, and <b>you</b> know I <b>could</b> <b>always</b> read your shorthand." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never! There's {{always a}} kind of intensity. When <b>you</b> laugh I <b>could</b> <b>always</b> cry; {{it seems as if}} it shows up your suffering. Oh, you make me knit the brows of my very soul and cogitate." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You know, <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>could</b> make me do {{anything}} you wanted in the old days, Joan. I suppose I have got to look on this as quite settled now?" ...|$|R
500|$|St Hill {{possessed a}} {{presence}} which compelled attention {{when he was}} batting. James wrote: [...] "Fires burned in St Hill and <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>always</b> see them glow." [...] When playing for Shannon, he insisted on the highest standards, {{and even though he}} was not captain, he would take over if the game was going against his team. James also wrote that he never understood St Hill as he did others: [...] "His eyes used to blaze when he was discussing a point with you; but even within his clipped sentences there were intervals when he seemed to be thinking of other things, far removed." ...|$|E
500|$|Brown's {{partnership}} with Fingleton {{was regarded as}} one of the great opening pairings in Australian Test cricket history. In ten Tests as an opening combination, the pair averaged 63.75 for the first wicket, higher than any other Australian duo with more than 1000 runs. Brown was known for his self-effacing nature and was well liked among teammates and opponents alike. Of his batting, Brown joked that [...] "My wife said <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>always</b> tell when I was batting by the number of people leaving the ground". During a domestic match at the Adelaide Oval in December 1938, he deflected a ball onto his stumps without dislodging a bail. He added a further 147 runs to end unbeaten on 174, eternally apologising for his luck.|$|E
500|$|Albert Brooks {{plays the}} foul-mouthed, morose Bernie Rose. When Refn {{suggested}} him, Gosling agreed, but thought the actor {{would not be}} up for playing a character who is violent and sullen, or for appearing in a film {{that he did not}} work on himself. Brooks accepted the role to go against type, and because he loved that Bernie was not a cliché. [...] "There are six people <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>always</b> get to play this kind of part, and I like that the director was thinking outside of the box. For me, it was an opportunity to act outside the box. I liked that this mobster had real style. Also, he doesn't {{get up in the morning}} thinking about killing people. He's sad about it. Upset about it. It's a case of, 'Look what you made me do.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I hope I am. I {{believe you}} {{would soon be}} {{intimate}} with them; but then <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>could</b> get on {{with all sorts of}} people, and I have a shrinking from getting under the surface--if I could.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thought or no thought, all's {{well that}} ends well," [...] broke in Mr. Clifford impatiently. [...] "And thank Heaven {{we are not}} more than three miles away from home. Will you lead the way, Jacob? <b>You</b> <b>always</b> <b>could</b> see in the dark?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Whitwell, when he came, {{attempted}} a larger {{view of the}} artist's work, but apparently more out of kindness for him than admiration of the picture. He said he presumed <b>you</b> <b>could</b> not <b>always</b> get {{a thing like that}} just right the first time, and that you had to keep trying till you did get it; but it paid in the end. Jeff had stolen down from the house with his dog, drawn by the fascination which one we have injured always has for us; when Whitwell suddenly turned upon him and asked, jocularly, [...] "What do you think, Jeff?" [...] the boy could only kick his dog and drive it home, as a means of hiding his feelings.|$|R
500|$|The {{magazine}} Private Eye made regular {{use of the}} Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells pseudonym to satirise {{the stereotypical}} conservative Middle Englander, {{and it became a}} running joke for several years. In 1978, BBC Radio 4 called its new listener feedback programme Disgusted, Tunbridge Wells, though it was renamed Feedback in 1979. This was following Radio 4 broadcasting the Take It From Here radio series in 1954 where [...] "Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells" [...] was prominently featured. In politics, the people behind [...] "Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells" [...] letters have strong conservative views and are commonly viewed to support the Conservative Party. However, most UK Independence Party (UKIP) members in the party's early days were viewed by commentators as being [...] "'Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells' pensioners", of which the UKIP leader Nigel Farage stated in 2013 [...] "I used to say <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>always</b> tell it was a UKIP meeting by the number of Bomber Command ties in the room." ...|$|E
500|$|McCartney later said, [...] "We lived {{backstage}} in the Bambi Kino, {{next to the}} toilets, and <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>always</b> smell them. The {{room had}} been an old storeroom, and there were just concrete walls and nothing else. No heat, no wallpaper, not a lick of paint; and two sets of bunk beds, with not very much covers—Union Jack flags—we were frozen." [...] Lennon remembered: [...] "We were put in this pigsty. We {{were living in a}} toilet, like right next to the ladies' toilet. We'd go to bed late and be woken up next day by the sound of the cinema show and old German fraus [...] pissing next door." [...] After having been awoken in this fashion, the group were then obliged to use cold water from the urinals for washing and shaving. They were paid £2.50 each a day, seven days a week, playing from 8:30-9:30, 10 until 11, 11:30-12:30, and finishing the evening playing from one until two o'clock in the morning. German customers found the group's name comical, as [...] "Beatles" [...] sounded like [...] "Peedles", which meant a small boy's penis.|$|E
2500|$|Beyoncé penned a {{personal}} note: [...] "Donna Summer made music that moved me both emotionally and physically {{to get up}} and dance. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>always</b> hear the deep passion in her voice. She was so much more than the queen of disco she became known for, she was an honest and gifted singer with flawless vocal talent. I've always been a huge fan and was honored to sample one of her songs. She touched many generations and will be sadly missed. My love goes out to her family during this difficult time. Love, B".|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Glenarm was conquered again, for the {{hundredth}} time at least. She said, softly, [...] "Oh, Geoffrey, if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> only be <b>always</b> like this!" [...] Her eyes lifted themselves admiringly to his. She took his arm again of her own accord, and pressed it with a loving clasp. Geoffrey prophetically felt the ten thousand a year in his pocket. [...] "Do you really love me?" [...] whispered Mrs. Glenarm. [...] "Don't I!" [...] answered the hero. The peace was made, and the two walked on again.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{it would}} be much better if you would not be married," [...] said Celia, drying her eyes, and {{returning}} to her argument; [...] "then there would be nothing uncomfortable. And you would not do what nobody thought <b>you</b> <b>could</b> do. James <b>always</b> said you ought to be a queen; but this is not at all being like a queen. You know what mistakes you have always been making, Dodo, and this is another. Nobody thinks Mr. Ladislaw a proper husband for you. And you said you would never be married again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{now that}} I {{know what you}} have been doing all this time, Mark, I must admit that you have been very good to have been with us as much as you have. I often used to wonder how you passed your time. Of course I knew that you were trying to find that man out, but it did not seem to me that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> be <b>always</b> at that, and I never dreamt that you had become a regular detective. I am very glad I did not know it till a short time before you gave it up. In the first place, I should have been horrified, and, in the second place, I should have been {{constantly}} uneasy about you. However, as this is to be the last time, I will let you go without grumbling." ...|$|R
2500|$|One {{consequence}} of the experience curve effect is that cost savings should be passed on as price decreases rather than kept as profit margin increases. [...] The BCG strategists felt that maintaining a relatively high price, although very profitable in the short run, spelled disaster for the strategy in the long run. They felt that it encouraged competitors to enter the market, triggering a steep price decline and a competitive shakeout. If prices were reduced as unit costs fell (due to experience curve effects), then competitive entry would be discouraged and one's market share maintained. [...] Using this strategy, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>always</b> stay {{one step ahead of}} new or existing rivals.|$|E
6000|$|... "That made no difference," [...] she inquired with {{a generous}} derision, [...] "because <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>always</b> imagine? Of course <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>always</b> imagine--which is {{precisely}} what is the matter with you! But I'm surprised at your coming to me with it once more as evidence of anything." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I had thought," [...] said John, hesitatingly, [...] "of {{going into}} your office and {{becoming}} your {{partner in the}} business. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>always</b> look after me, you know." ...|$|E
500|$|Dante Bert Joseph [...] "Gluefingers" [...] Lavelli (February 23, 1923 – January 20, 2009) was an American {{football}} end {{who played}} for the Cleveland Browns in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) and National Football League (NFL) from 1946 to 1956. Starring alongside quarterback Otto Graham, fullback Marion Motley, placekicker Lou Groza and fellow receiver Mac Speedie, Lavelli {{was an integral part}} of a Browns team that won seven championships during his 11-season career. Lavelli was known for his sure hands and improvisations on the field. He was also renowned for making catches in critical situations, earning the nickname [...] "Mr. Clutch". [...] "Lavelli had one of the strongest pairs of hands I've ever seen," [...] Browns coach Paul Brown once said of him. [...] "When he went up for a pass with a defender, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> almost <b>always</b> count on him coming back down with the ball." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{walked on}} my ten toes!" [...] cried John; [...] "tramped {{the whole way}} from Browndean; and begged! I {{would like to see}} you beg. It's not so easy as you might suppose. I played it on being a shipwrecked mariner from Blyth; I don't know where Blyth is, do you? but I thought it sounded natural. I begged from a little beast of a schoolboy, and he forked out a bit of twine, and asked me to make a clove hitch; I did, too, I know I did, but he said it wasn't, {{he said it was a}} granny's knot, and I was a what-d'ye-call-'em, and he would give me in charge. Then I begged from a naval officer--he never bothered me with knots, but he only gave me a tract; there's a nice account of the British navy!--and then from a widow woman that sold lollipops, and I got a hunch of bread from her. Another party I fell in with said <b>you</b> <b>could</b> {{generally}} <b>always</b> get bread; and the thing to do was to break a plate-glass window and get into gaol; seemed rather a brilliant scheme.--Pass the beef." ...|$|R
60|$|A {{quotation}} from the Bible {{came to my}} lips, but I held my tongue, for I know that clergymen think it a little blasphemous when the laity poach upon their preserves. My Uncle Henry, for twenty-seven years Vicar of Whitstable, was on these occasions {{in the habit of}} saying that the devil <b>could</b> <b>always</b> quote scripture to his purpose. He remembered the days when <b>you</b> <b>could</b> get thirteen Royal Natives for a shilling.|$|R
6000|$|... "What do you say, lads? You {{would have}} a chance of {{crossing}} swords with the Enniskilleners, and <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>always</b> come back here when the war is over." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{like to see}} ladies about," [...] {{said the}} mate, who was trying desperately for a return invitation. [...] "I wish <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>always</b> sit there. You quite {{brighten}} the cabin up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{might be}} {{easy enough to}} say what you think if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>always</b> be sure just what you DO think," [...] said the Story Girl. [...] "So often I can't be sure." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Hush, children, this is shocking,' said Wilmet, {{in the low}} {{impressive}} voice {{by which}} she <b>could</b> <b>always</b> still a tumult. 'How <b>could</b> <b>you</b> take advantage of my absence to do this?' ...|$|R
60|$|Now, thirdly--and here is {{much the}} worst phase of the crisis. This past system of misgovernment, {{especially}} {{during the last three}} hundred years, has prepared, by its neglect, a class among the lower orders which it is now peculiarly difficult to govern. It deservedly lost their respect--but that was the least part of the mischief. The deadly part of it was, that the lower orders lost their habit, and at last their faculty, of respect;--lost the very capability of reverence, which is the most precious part of the human soul. Exactly in the degree in which you can find creatures greater than yourself, to look up to, in that degree, you are ennobled yourself, and, in that degree, happy. If <b>you</b> <b>could</b> live <b>always</b> in the presence of archangels, you would be happier than in that of men; but even if only in the company of admirable knights and beautiful ladies, the more noble and bright they were, and the more <b>you</b> <b>could</b> reverence their virtue the happier you would be. On the contrary, if you were condemned to live among a multitude of idiots, dumb, distorted and malicious, you would not be happy in the constant sense of your own superiority. Thus all real joy and power of progress in humanity depend on finding something to reverence; and all the baseness and misery of humanity begin in a habit of disdain. Now, by general misgovernment, I repeat, we have created in Europe a vast populace, and out of Europe a still vaster one, which has lost even the power and conception of reverence;[139]--which exists only in the worship of itself--which can neither see anything beautiful around it, nor conceive anything virtuous above it; which has, towards all goodness and greatness, no other feelings than those of the lowest creatures--fear, hatred, or hunger a populace which has sunk below your appeal in their nature, as it has risen beyond your power in their multitude;--whom you can now no more charm than you can the adder, nor discipline, than you can the summer fly.|$|R
5000|$|I was a chancellor, and I <b>could</b> {{not have}} <b>always</b> carried 200 taels of gold around with me. If <b>you</b> <b>could</b> find {{that someone had}} paid, and someone had {{received}} it, please go ahead and carry out judgment according to law.|$|R

6000|$|To {{say that}} {{anything}} was a quotation {{was an excellent}} method, in Eleanor's eyes, for withdrawing it from discussion, just as <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>always</b> defend indifferent lamb {{late in the season}} by saying [...] "It's mutton." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "An hour, if you prefer," [...] said he. [...] "I do {{not seek}} to deny that the money for your seat is an object to me; and <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>always</b> get the first to Glascow with saddle-horses." ...|$|E
60|$|CONFUCIUS. I {{did not say}} <b>you</b> <b>could</b> do nothing. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> fight. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> eat. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> drink.

5000|$|Frederic Halford was wealthy {{enough to}} take winter {{vacations}} in Europe and the Mediterranean to escape the English winter weather. He was also an amateur photographer and liked to capture the people and places he visited during his winter trips abroad. Much of his work still survives today and shows that he visited Spain in 1908, Pontresina in 1909, Egypt in 1910 and Biskra in 1911. In February 1914 he was in Tunis. During the return voyage he fell ill with pneumonia on the P&O liner Morea. He died aboard on 5 March 1914 as the ship was arriving in London on the River Thames. He was 69 years old. After his funeral, praise for Halford in the mainstream British press {{as well as the}} sporting press was overwhelming. William Senior, editor of The Field, and a close personal friend of Halford wrote: He was a delightful companion-generous, big-hearted, amusing, a sayer of good things in a human way, and finely opinionated, which of course, was not a serious matter when he expected and liked you to be opinionated also. He was a dangerous man to tackle in an argument if your knowledge of the subject was rickety. He was emphatically what is termed a well-informed man, for that thoroughness of his stamped his knowledge and ruled his memory. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> not <b>always</b> agree with him, but could seldom floor him, the ground he stood upon being rock-solid. As both a giver and taker of chaff he was an adept. He had the courage of his opinions, and none wiser that he when it was best to keep his opinions an unknown quantity. In travelling or by the waterside he was wonderfully helpful if help was good for you-perhaps, if anything, too helpful, though I cannot conceive a more pardonable fault than that. William Senior, The Field, 1914 ...|$|R
6000|$|And {{he answers}} her: [...] "I {{believe you are}} the only one now alive who {{remember}}s me as a child. I have heard of you from time to time, but I wonder what sort of person you are now. Perhaps if I did know I wouldn't dare put pen to paper. But I don't know. I only remember that we were great chums. In fact, I chummed with you even more than with your brothers. But I am like the pigeon that went away in the fable of the Two Pigeons. If I once start to tell you I would want you to feel that you have been there yourself. I may overtax your patience with the story of my life so different from yours, not only in all the facts but altogether in spirit. You may not understand. You may even be shocked. I say all this to myself; but I know I shall succumb! I have a distinct recollection that in the old days, when you were about fifteen, <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>could</b> make me do whatever you liked." ...|$|R
