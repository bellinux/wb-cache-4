2500|$|The event left {{a lasting}} {{impression}} on many worldwide. As with the December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor before it and the September 11 attacks after it, asking [...] "Where were you when <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> President Kennedy's assassination" [...] would become a common topic of discussion.|$|E
2500|$|Did {{you watch}} the {{television}} show about the local drug problem {{a few days ago}} when a local policeman appeared for a long time? Have <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> that show? Have you read or heard about recent newspaper articles to the effect that the local drug problem is bad? Would you try this case {{solely on the basis of}} the evidence presented in this courtroom? Would you be influenced by the circumstances that the prosecution’s witness, a police officer, has publicly spoken on TV about drugs? ...|$|E
30|$|Breast {{cancer and}} BSE {{awareness}} questions (yes/no response) included: “Have <b>you</b> ever <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> breast cancer?”, “Have <b>you</b> ever <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> BSE?”, “Do <b>you</b> {{know how to}} do BSE?”, and “What is the age of BSE?”.|$|R

6000|$|... 'Have <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> {{anything}} <b>about</b> it?' continued Mr. Cassilis. 'Young Coningsby {{brought it}} from abroad; didn't you you say so, Jemmy?' ...|$|R
2500|$|Having been {{introduced}} to Georgescu during {{the final stage of}} the critic's career, Manea retold one of his confessions from the time: [...] "I suppose what <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> me is that I am a Stalinist. I'm not a Stalinist, Mr. Norman, know that. I was with Leiba Trotsky." [...] Manea also wrote: [...] "What struck about [...] was the contradiction between the extraordinary mobility of spirit and the Affixed Idea. [...] How did he pacify his disappointments and regenerate his militantism after having seen with his eyes, and his mind, and his heart the nightmarish masquerade of the totalitarian state?" [...] He added: [...] "The socialist tension between the 'conserved' ideal and the putrid reality maintained in those who gave up neither contempt nor complicity a sort of narcissistic and megalomaniac blindness." ...|$|E
2500|$|After Ott {{become the}} {{ambassador}} to Japan in April 1938, Sorge had a breakfast with him everyday {{where the two}} discussed in detail German-Japanese relations, and Sorge sometimes drafted the cables that Ott sent under his name to Berlin. Ott trusted Sorge {{so much that he}} sent him out as a German courier to carry secret messages to the German consulates in Canton, Hong Kong, and Manila. Sorge himself noted about his influence in the German Embassy: [...] "They would come to me and say, 'we have found out such and such a thing, have <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> it and what do you think?'". Of all of Sorge's various relationships with women, the most durable and lastingly was with a Japanese woman Hanako Ishii who tried to curb Sorge's heavy drinking and his habit of recklessly riding his motorcycle around the Japanese countryside in a manner that everyone viewed as almost suicidal.|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} it was about, or why he should have made such a brute of himself. <b>You</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> those people at Allington?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Of course, Miss Layard, <b>you</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> {{the wreck}} of the Trondhjem, and how those foreign sailors saw the light in my {{workshop}} and brought Mr. Fregelius to the Abbey." ...|$|R
6000|$|Ten {{minutes of}} palaeontology ensued; {{and she was}} leading {{the way back to}} the drawing-room, when he exclaimed, 'Have <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> the match, Miss May?' ...|$|E
6000|$|Isabel {{thought her}} a very {{attractive}} person, but nevertheless spoke with a certain abruptness in reply to this speech. [...] "From whom have <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Have <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> that affair at Clamart," [...] {{they demanded}} eagerly. [...] "They say the line behaved shamefully, and that Trochu {{declares}} they shall be decimated." ...|$|E

6000|$|Peters nodded. [...] "I expect <b>you</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> {{the black}} Napoleon who founded a negro {{state in the}} Antilles? Well, it's not {{impossible}} the Bat will make himself as powerful as the other." ...|$|R
