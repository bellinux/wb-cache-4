Alexandra reassured her that she was as dearly loved as her siblings. At age eleven, Maria apparently developed a painful crush on one of the young men she had met. [...] "Try not to let your thoughts dwell too much on him, that's what our Friend said," [...] Alexandra wrote to her on December 6, 1910. Alexandra advised her third daughter to keep her feelings hidden because others might say unkind things to her about her crush.

The two-year building programme, the ever-rising costs, which escalated from the initial estimate of £7,000 to over £18,000, {{and a series of}} construction difficulties, particularly relating to damp, soured relations between architect and client, and by 1924 Churchill and Tilden were barely on speaking terms. Legal arguments, conducted through their respective lawyers, rumbled on until 1927. Clementine's anxieties about the costs, both of building and subsequently living at Chartwell also continued. In September 1923 Churchill wrote to her, [...] "My beloved, I beg <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> worry about money, or to feel insecure. Chartwell is to be our home (and) we must endeavour to live there for many years."

500|$|By {{the fifth}} Test, the Australian team {{was in sight}} {{of being the first}} Australian team to remain unbeaten {{throughout}} a tour of England. [...] Once again, much of the first day was lost to rain. Determined not to lose, Armstrong attempted to delay commencement after the rain and was heckled by English supporters. [...] He told his three main bowlers, [...] "I won't ask <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> get a man out, but as long as Mead (a notoriously slow scoring batsman) remains at the wicket we can't be beaten". [...] In the last three hours of the Test, Armstrong decided to rest his key bowlers and allowed his part-time bowlers to rotate as they pleased and fielders to configure themselves. During this time, Armstrong picked up a newspaper that had been blown across the field and began to read. [...] When asked about this later, Armstrong was said to have replied, [...] "I wanted to see who we were playing", although this is claimed to be apocryphal. [...] The Australians drew the Test and won the series three–nil, however they could not maintain their unbeaten record, losing by 28runs to an English XI at Eastbourne and again to C. I. Thornton's XI at Scarborough.|$|E

Marrit Ingman of The Austin Chronicle said the film indicates [...] "a community-based, cooperative model of group success," [...] while Justin Chang of Variety said it [...] "focuses ... on the bee's community-uniting impact." [...] Hodges said Akeelah goes to the spelling bee because she recognizes it [...] "proves that someone from their neighborhood can achieve success, and her achievementis, in a real sense, their own". In contrast, Bernard Beck wrote for Multicultural Perspectives that it depicts [...] "the success of individual perseverance", while Red Feather Journalls Kathryn Linder expressed a similar opinion about individual success. Nevertheless, Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times commented [...] "it raises important points about the ... obstacles to success that kids from poor neighborhoods face." [...] The New York Presss reviewer went further and said social class was its [...] "real subject" [...] as it [...] "depicts the basics of class mobility that are routinely taken for granted". However, Chang asserted it shows the spelling bee contest as [...] "a democratizing force", while Rob Asghar, for The Seattle Times, wrote it treats English as [...] "the quintessential American tool for success." ...|$|E

AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine praised it for capturing [...] "Pharrell Williams' flair for slim, sleek grooves" [...] and labelled it a highlight from Hard Candy. Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone, {{noted that the}} [...] "creative tension between Madonna and the Neptunes' Pharrell Williams crackles on the innuendo-laden opener 'Candy Shop'". Writing for Idolator, Bradley Stern criticized the lyrics but praised its catchiness, [...] "set to a nice, punchy beat, Madonna weaves her voice around a hypnotic groove that practically dares <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> sing along. [...] is all about letting loose {{and having a good}} time". He also opined that while it wouldn't work as a single [...] "it more than serves its purpose as an introduction to Hard Candy". Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine wrote, [...] "Pharrell makes his presence known a little too much [...] he manages to get Madonna to stretch vocally in ways she hasn't since Evita. That is, when she's not doing cheeky drag queen impersonations, with trannie-fierce moments sprinkled liberally throughout 'Candy Shop' (“My sugar is raw”) [...] The song is neither sexy nor campy, and somewhere, Dita is throwing her head back, laughing hysterically, and cracking her whip in disapproval", the last part being a reference to the alter ego Madonna incorporated for her fifth studio album, Erotica (1992).|$|E
500|$|Lester {{was offered}} {{producing}} credit but refused, going uncredited for his work.

[...] "Being there all the time meant he [...] could take over," [...] Salkind admitted. [...] " [...] couldn't make up his mind on stuff." [...] On Lester, Donner reflected, [...] "He'd been suing the Salkinds for his money on Three and Four Musketeers, which he'd never gotten. He won a lot of his lawsuits, but each time he sued the Salkinds in one country, they'd move to another, from Costa Rica to Panama to Switzerland. When I was hired, Lester told me, 'Don't do it. Don't work for them. I was told not to, but I did it. Now I'm telling <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>to,</b> but you'll probably do it and end up telling the next guy.' Lester came in as a 'go-between'.

500|$|Stockhausen's two early Electronic Studies (especially the second) had a {{powerful}} influence on the subsequent development of electronic music in the 1950s and 1960s, particularly {{in the work of}} the Italian Franco Evangelisti and the Poles Andrzej Dobrowolski and Włodzimierz Kotoński [...] The influence of his Kontra-Punkte, Zeitmasse and Gruppen may be seen in the work of many composers, including Igor Stravinsky's Threni (1957–58) and Movements for piano and orchestra (1958–59) and other works up to the Variations: Aldous Huxley In Memoriam (1963–64), whose rhythms [...] "are likely to have been inspired, at least in part, by certain passages from Stockhausen's Gruppen" [...] Though music of Stockhausen's generation may seem an unlikely influence, Stravinsky said in a 1957 conversation: I have all around me the spectacle of composers who, after their generation has had its decade of influence and fashion, seal themselves off from further development and from the next generation (as I say this, exceptions come to mind, Krenek, for instance). Of course, it requires greater effort to learn from one's juniors, and their manners are not invariably good. But when you are seventy-five and your generation has overlapped with four younger ones, it behooves <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> decide in advance [...] "how far composers can go," [...] but to try to discover whatever new thing it is makes the new generation new.|$|E

500|$|The {{years from}} 1801 to 1804 are {{something}} of a blank space for Austen scholars as Cassandra destroyed all of her letters from her sister in this period for unknown reasons. In December 1802 Austen received her only known proposal of marriage. She and her sister visited Alethea and Catherine Bigg, old friends who lived near Basingstoke. Their younger brother, Harris Bigg-Wither, had recently finished his education at Oxford and was also at home. Bigg-Wither proposed and Austen accepted. As described by Caroline Austen, Jane's niece, and Reginald Bigg-Wither, a descendant, Harris was not attractive – he was a large, plain-looking man who spoke little, stuttered when he did speak, was aggressive in conversation, and almost completely tactless. However, Austen had known him since both were young and the marriage offered many practical advantages to Austen and her family. He was the heir to extensive family estates located {{in the area where}} the sisters had grown up. With these resources, Austen could provide her parents a comfortable old age, give Cassandra a permanent home and, perhaps, assist her brothers in their careers. By the next morning, Austen realised she had made a mistake and withdrew her acceptance. No contemporary letters or diaries describe how Austen felt about this proposal. In 1814, Austen wrote a letter to her niece, Fanny Knight, who had asked for advice about a serious relationship, telling her that [...] "having written so much {{on one side of the}} question, I shall now turn around & entreat <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> commit yourself farther, & not to think of accepting him unless you really do like him. Anything is to be preferred or endured rather than marrying without Affection". The English scholar Douglas Bush wrote that Austen had [...] "had a very high ideal of the love that should unite a husband and wife... All of her heroines... know in proportion to their maturity, the meaning of ardent love". A possible autobiographical element in Sense and Sensibility occurs when Elinor Dashwood contemplates that [...] "the worse and most irremediable of all evils, a connection for life" [...] with an unsuitable man.|$|E

Surprisingly well informed about the correspondence between Saint Petersburg and Warsaw, Rostovtsev advised Nicholas to go to Warsaw himself rather than wait for Constantine. His report, [...] "a candle to the Lord and to Satan", sounded like an ultimatum: [...] "You have seriously irritated a great number against you. In {{the name of your}} own glory I entreat <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> hasten to reign." [...] Nicholas did not heed Rostovtsev's proposals which ran completely contrary to his plans.

In the typescript, the name of the poem is [...] "Gerousia", referring to the name of the Council of the Elders at Sparta. Pound, who was living in London in 1919, acted as Eliot's editor and influenced many of his works. When Eliot considered publishing the poem as the opening part of The Waste Land, Pound discouraged him from doing so saying, [...] "I do not advise printing Gerontion as preface. One don't miss it at all as the thing now stands. To be more lucid still, let me say that I advise <b>you</b> <b>NOT</b> <b>to</b> print Gerontion as prelude."
