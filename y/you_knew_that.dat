I loved Cristina's Stepford wife joke and how everyone, {{including}} Derek, couldn't help but stare at her hair. Yet, no one had the balls to tell her it was bad." [...] Pascua also enjoyed Leigh's performance as Lexie, commenting: [...] "This was one episode I felt that Lexie was a genuine character. She still maintained that book-smart ability to repeat facts (like the merger cases) and shows a command of medical situations." [...] He too found Oh's bear voice comical, adding: [...] "I laughed when Cristina attempted to do her voice for Mr. Bear because <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> she didn't {{know what she was}} doing." [...] Pascua was shocked with the departure of Utterbacks' character, writing: [...] "I can't believe that they cut Nurse Olivia. I understand that she wasn't really around, but having her as a tertiary character was nice. It was kind of ass-y of the chief not to personally tell these people that they were being cut, but it made Derek look really chivalrous." ...|$|E

This detail was {{suggested}} by actor Victor Magnotta, a friend of Scorsese's who had a small role as a Secret Service agent and who had served in Vietnam. Scorsese later noted: [...] "Magnotta had talked about certain types of soldiers going into the jungle.

5000|$|The {{doctrine}} of tawhid, {{in the words}} of the prominent Mu’tazili scholar Chief Justice Qadi Abd al-Jabbar (d. 415 AH/1025 AD), is: [...] the knowledge that God, being unique, has attributes that no creature shares with Him. This is explained by the fact <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> the world has a creator who created it and that: He existed eternally in the past and He cannot perish while we exist after being non-existent and we can perish. And <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> He was and is eternally all-powerful and that impotence is not possible for Him. And <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> He is omniscient of the past and present and that ignorance is not possible for Him. And <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> He <b>knows</b> everything <b>that</b> was, everything that is, and how things that are not would be if they were. And <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> He is eternally in the past and future living, and that calamities and pain are not possible for Him. And <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> He sees visible things, and perceives perceptibles, and that He does not have need of sense organs. And <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> He is eternally past and in future sufficient and it is not possible for Him to be in need. And <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> He is not like physical bodies, and that it is not possible for Him to get up or down, move about, change, be composite, have a form, limbs and body members. And <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> He is not like the accidents of motion, rest, color, food or smells. And <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> He is One throughout eternity and there is no second beside Him, and that everything other than He is contingent, made, dependent, structured, and governed by someone/thing else. Thus, if <b>you</b> <b>know</b> all of <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> the oneness of God.|$|R
2500|$|He {{then turns}} {{to the subject of}} morality, {{maintaining}} that we do not need religion to be good. Instead, our morality has a Darwinian explanation: altruistic genes, selected through the process of evolution, give people natural empathy. He asks, [...] "would you commit murder, rape or robbery if <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> no God existed?" [...] He argues that very few people would answer [...] "yes", undermining the claim that religion is needed to make us behave morally. In support of this view, he surveys the history of morality, arguing that there is a moral Zeitgeist that continually evolves in society, generally progressing toward liberalism. As it progresses, this moral consensus influences how religious leaders interpret their holy writings. Thus, Dawkins states, morality does not originate from the Bible, rather our moral progress informs what part of the Bible Christians accept and what they now dismiss.|$|E
2500|$|Buñuel's {{style of}} {{directing}} was extremely economical; he shot films {{in a few}} weeks, rarely deviating from his script (the scene in Tristana where Catherine Deneuve exposes her breasts to Saturno – but not the audience – being a noted exception) and shooting in order {{as much as possible}} to minimize editing time. [...] He remained true throughout his working life to an operating philosophy that he articulated {{at the beginning of his}} career in 1928: [...] "The guiding idea, the silent procession of images that are concrete, decisive, measured in space and time—in a word, the film—was first projected inside the brain of the filmmaker". [...] In this, Buñuel has been compared with Alfred Hitchcock, another director famous for precision, efficiency and preplanning, for whom actually shooting the film was an anticlimax, since each man would know, in Buñuel's words, [...] "exactly how each scene will be shot and what the final montage will be". [...] According to actress Jeanne Moreau: [...] "He was the only director I know who never threw away a shot. He had the film in his mind. When he said 'action' and 'cut,' <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> what was in between the two would be printed." ...|$|E
