5|$|SCI is {{extremely}} disruptive to sexuality, and it most frequently happens to <b>young</b> <b>people,</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> at a peak in their sexual and reproductive lives. Yet {{the importance of}} sexuality {{as a part of}} life is not diminished by a disabling injury. Although for years people with SCI were believed to be asexual, research has shown sexuality to be a high priority for people with SCI and an important aspect of quality of life. In fact, of all abilities they would like to have return, most paraplegics rated sexual function as their top priority, and most tetraplegics rated it second, after hand and arm function. Sexual function has a profound impact on self-esteem and adjustment to life post-injury. People who are able to adapt to their changed bodies and to have satisfying sex lives have better overall quality of life.|$|E

Therefore, political applications of social networking sites are crucial, particularly to engage with the youth, who perhaps are the least educated in politics and the most in social networking sites. Social media is therefore a very effective way in which politicians can connect with a younger audience through their political campaigns.|$|E

500|$|When President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva {{took office}} in January 2003, he chose Gil as Brazil's new Minister of Culture, only the second black person {{to serve in the}} country's cabinet. The {{appointment}} was controversial among political and artistic figures and the Brazilian press; a remark Gil made about difficulties with his salary received particular criticism. Gil is not a member of Lula's Workers' Party and did not participate in creating its cultural program. Shortly after becoming Minister, Gil began a partnership between Brazil and Creative Commons. As Minister, he has sponsored a program called Culture Points, which gives grants to provide music technology and education to people living in poor areas of the country's cities. Gil has since asserted that [...] "You've now got <b>young</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> becoming designers, who are making it into media and being used more and more by television and samba schools and revitalizing degraded neighborhoods. It's a different vision of the role of government, a new role." [...] Gil has also expressed interest in a program that will establish an Internet repository of freely downloadable Brazilian music. Since Gil's appointment, the department's expenditures have increased by over 50percent. In November 2007 Gil announced his intention to resign from his post due to a vocal cord polyp. Lula rejected Gil's first two attempts to resign, but accepted another request in July 2008. Lula said on this occasion that Gil was [...] "going back to being a great artist, going back to giving priority to what is most important" [...] to him.|$|E

Some of the negative commentary surrounding the program has been attributed to the belief that <b>young</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> exposed to LGBTIQ issues might then change their sexuality. There is no evidence that sex education can make a student turn gay. The current federal governments policy is to not fund the program beyond 2017.

The trust currently has four full-time salaried staff and 12 trustees, who are all residents of the Isles.
