In the current project first we have evaluated the performance of candidate DNA barcode regions of flowering plants for distinguishing Dioscorea species. Important markers were identified that fulfill better the criteria for good DNA barcode regions in terms of PCR amplification, sequence quality and discriminatory power. The second research question demonstrated genetic relationship, variation in ploidy level, pattern of heterozygosity and allele sharing, contribution of wild relatives to cultivated species and confirmation on the previous and new suggestions in guinea yams taxonomy utilizing next generation sequencing based genotyping, GBS (genotyping by sequncing), combined with ploidy level and morphological data.

40|$|ABSTRACT Wild <b>yams</b> (<b>Dioscorea</b> <b>spp.)</b> are {{primordial}} {{sources of}} carbohydrates for many hunter-gatherers of African forests. Yams {{play a key}} role in the symbolic perception of the forest by the Baka Pygmies of Southern Cameroon. The Baka have elaborated an original form of wild yam exploitation that I have termed “paracultivation”. Paraculti-vation defines a set of technical, social and cultural practices aiming at managing wild resources while keeping them in their natural environment. In 1994, I undertook an experimental survey to estimate the effect of paracultivation on survivol and growth of yam plants. Preliminary results presented here demonstrate that paracultivation increases the production of tubers without affecting plant survivorship. Furthermore, it allows a better control of the spatial and temporal availability of yam resources by the Baka. This study has opened up new perspectives on the evolutionary ecology of tuber-producing tropical forest plants. Paracultivation encourages us to reconsider the interac-tive process between forest dwellers and their environment.

In general, Meloidogyne spp. caused little galling to roots and tubers, and limited reduction in plant growth and yield. Of three species tested, D. rotundata was the most susceptible and most heavily affected by Meloidogyne spp. infection, D. alata was the least affected, and D. cayenensis was intermediately affected yam species. Meloidogyne spp. infection of tubers significantly exacerbated yam tuber weight loss during storage, particularly during the first 2 months, and moreover reduced and delayed tuber sprouting.

We also show that wild species show a stronger genetic structure than cultivated species, which potentially reflects the management of the yam germplasm by farmers. These findings show that phylogenetic diversity is a promising approach for an initial investigation of genetic diversity in a crop consisting of closely related species...|$|E
40|$|Arbuscular {{mycorrhizal}} fungi (AMF) {{are widely}} distributed in nature. They {{live in the}} roots of higher plants, in a symbiotic relationship. In this study, five commercial species of <b>yams</b> (<b>Dioscorea</b> <b>spp.)</b> were inoculated with six species of AMF, Glomus clarum, G. etunicatum, G. fasciculatum, Gigaspora sp., G. mosseae, and Acaulospora sp., in field cultivation conditions to investigate the influence of AMF inoculation on tuber weights and secondary metabolite content in yam tubers. The results showed that mycorrhizae formation rates ranged from 63. 33 % to 90 %. G. etunicatum inoculation treatment increased the tube weights of the five species of yam tubers by 39 %, 35 %, 20 %, 56 %, and 40 % for Tainung 1, Tainung 2, Ercih, Zihyuxieshu, and Tainung 5, respectively. The content of secondary metabolites, such as polyphenols, flavonoids, and anthocyanin, was significantly increased by the AMF treatment in tuber flesh and peel of all the tested yam species. Specifically, the maximums exchange of secondary metabolite contents increased to 40 %, 42 %, and 106 % for polyphenols, flavonoids, and anthocyanin, respectively, in the tuber fresh. This study revealed that different species of yam had varying degrees of affinity with various AMF species; selecting effective AMF species is necessary to facilitate yam growth and improve {{the quality and quantity}} of yam tubers...|$|E
40|$|<b>Yam</b> (<b>Dioscorea</b> <b>spp.)</b> is an {{important}} food and cash crop in the Guinea-Sudan zone of Benin. The genetic diversity of about 70 cultivars of Dioscorea cayenensis/Dioscorea rotundata (Guinea yam) and about 20 cultivars of <b>Dioscorea</b> alata (water <b>yam)</b> was analysed using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD). The amplified bands revealed high polymorphism. These polymorphic DNA fragments were used to construct dendrograms, clustering all accessions into 18 groups: 12 for D. cayenensis/D. rotundata and six for D. alata. The analysis of molecular variance revealed highly significant variation among species, among groups within species, and among cultivars within groups. The study showed that the genetic diversity changed along a spatial gradient. In general, there was a tendency {{that most of the}} varieties from the north-east and north-west of the zone investigated appeared to be distinctive from the ones of the centre. However, few varieties were distributed randomly and did not reflect any specific relation to their zone of collection. The current study suggests that the Guinea-Sudan zone of Benin has a large gene pool of yam varieties. Yam farmers may have {{played a significant role in}} the enrichment and the maintenance of the genetic diversity of yam...|$|R
40|$|Published online: July 2017 The yam nematode, Scutellonema bradys, is a {{major threat}} to <b>yam</b> (<b>Dioscorea</b> <b>spp.)</b> {{production}} across yam-growing regions. In West Africa, this species cohabits with many morphologically similar congeners and, consequently, its accurate diagnosis is essential for control and for monitoring its movement. In the present study, 46 Scutellonema populations collected from yam rhizosphere and yam tubers in different agro-ecological zones in Ghana and Nigeria were characterised by their morphological features and by sequencing of the D 2 -D 3 region of the 28 S rDNA gene and the mitochondrial COI genes. Molecular phylogeny, molecular species delimitation and morphology revealed S. bradys, S. cavenessi, S. clathricaudatum and three undescribed species from yam rhizosphere. Only S. bradys was identified from yam tuber tissue, however. For barcoding and identifying Scutellonema spp., the most suitable marker used was the COI gene. Additionally, 99 new Scutellonema sequences were generated using populations obtained also from banana, carrot, maize and tomato, including the first for S. paralabiatum and S. clathricaudatum, enabling the development of a dichotomous key for identification of Scutellonema spp. The implications of these results are discussed.

40|$|Background: <b>Yam</b> (<b>Dioscorea</b> <b>spp.)</b> {{is a very}} {{important}} common food crop in West Africa. Beyond its food and nutritious values, the ownership and cultivation of yam have many cultural, religious, and social meanings, which may vary between specific ethnic groups and regional areas. This study explored the diverse social, cultural, and religious perspectives associated with yam and its cultivation in southeastern Nigeria. Methods: We used a comparative approach and utilized in-depth, semistructured interviews, local narratives, and our experiential background to understand the similarities and differences in the local notions of yam and their impacts on the general societal structure across three ethnic regions in southeastern Nigeria. We discussed the findings on a thematic basis to reflect the social and cultural issues associated with the ownership and cultivation of yam. The themes ranged from religious practices, impact on social status, and gender relations. Results: We found no significant differences in the incidence of local perceptions and practices between the study areas. Conclusion: This study has demonstrated the importance and functions of yam crop in structuring the social, economic, religious and cultural fabric of the society...|$|R
