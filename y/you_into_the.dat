Walker described her score as [...] "very theme-driven, conservative music that covers the range from bizarre animal noises with stronger visceral impact to stirring emotional music with well-defined melodies that evolve through the storytelling". The [...] "Main Title" [...] piece, used for the opening credits, was rare for opening a film aimed at a youth audience at the time.

Alex Fletcher of Digital Spy said that unlike the usual seventh single release by an artist, [...] "Disturbia" [...] is one Rihanna's stronger releases {{and that it}} proves that she is ruling '08 much like she did '07. He went on to describe it as a [...] "fun-packed electro treat filled with sizzling beats and crazy vocal effects." [...] Fletcher further highlighted the song's strong intro hook {{and said that the}} chorus is her catchiest since [...] "Umbrella". Spence D of IGN felt that the track has an infectious [...] "Bum-bum-be-dum-bum-bum" [...] hook that sucks <b>you</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> detached electronic bounce of the track. Jaime Gill from Yahoo! Music highlighted the song's [...] "insistent hook, sturdy beat and weaving, winding melody." [...] Fraser McAlpine from the BBC Music deemed the song's plus points to be Rihanna's icy whine, the frosty-rave chorus and the Eiffel 65-like refrain.|$|E
500|$|Later, Rose {{explained}} his intent further in The Washington Post: [...] "The cartoonists treated Islam {{the same way}} they treat Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism and other religions. And by treating Muslims in Denmark as equals they made a point: We are integrating <b>you</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Danish tradition of satire because you are part of our society, not strangers.

[...] The publication of the cartoons was also accompanied by an editorial titled 'Truslen fra mørket ('The Threat from [...] the Darkness) condemning Islamic spiritual leaders [...] "who feel entitled to interpret the prophet's word, and cannot abide the insult that comes from being the object of intelligent satire." [...] In October 2005, Politiken, another leading Danish newspaper, published its own poll of thirty-one of the forty-three members of the Danish cartoonist association. Twenty-three said {{they would be willing to}} draw Muhammad.

500|$|... "The One {{with the}} Embryos" [...] was Courteney Cox and Matt LeBlanc's {{favorite}} {{episode of the}} series. Cox liked the episode because she enjoys playing Monica at her most competitive, while LeBlanc spoke fondly of {{the pace of the}} episode and the information about the characters that came out. He identified scenes that featured just the six core cast as the best, [...] "because you don't have to introduce a character–you don't have to lay any pipeline–you just get right to the funny". On the DVD audio commentary for the episode, Marta Kauffman cited the episode being [...] "so much fun to do" [...] and enjoyed the writing process. The scene involving Phoebe talking to the embryos was Kevin S. Bright's favorite in the show's history because of Kudrow's ability to [...] "draw <b>you</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> scene ... even though it's only her talking to the dish".

500|$|Upon release, {{the film}} {{generally}} received positive reviews, with most critics calling the film [...] "summer entertainer" [...] and lauding its technical aspects.

The reviewer praised the [...] "loveable lead pair" [...] for their [...] "credible performance, which makes up for the plot holes". He said that technically the film was Linguswamy's his best, with Mathi's [...] "eye-catching camera work", Antony's [...] "crisp editing", Rajeevan's [...] "exotic set designs", and praised composer Yuvan Shankar Raja, whose [...] "foot-tapping" [...] songs [...] "scorch just like the desert sun" [...] and were all [...] "rocking", while his background score was a [...] "perfect co-ordination with the narration". A reviewer from the Times of India, Bhama Devi Ravi, gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, writing that [...] "the story is not earth-shatteringly new, but what pulls <b>you</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> movie is the different spin that Lingusamy gives to the familiar story". She praised the lead pair's performance, particularly Karthi, who [...] "comes up with an enjoyable performance", as well as the film's technical values, describing the camera work as [...] "mind-blowing", Brinda Sarathy's dialogues as [...] "thoroughly enjoyable" [...] and Yuvan Shankar Raja's songs as [...] "a real treat". Indiaglitz described the film as a [...] "racy action adventure" [...] and [...] "undeniably an entertainer this summer", writing that Linguswamy has brought out [...] "a classy entertainer" [...] and Karthi and Tamannaah's performances are [...] "absolutely great".

500|$|As early reviews {{focused on}} Ben Hawkins, Brother Justin Crowe {{and the meaning}} of Carnivàle, the show's {{supporting}} characters received little to no attention other than having their freak appearances mentioned, according to Varietys Phil Gallo because [...] "they don't play significant parts in the first few episodes." [...] Critics who reviewed full seasons gave more credit. Wendy Tuohy of the Australian newspaper The Age stated that show creator Daniel Knauf [...] "sprinkled enough magical gifts over the carnival's cast of mind readers, fortunetellers, snake charmers, catatonic psychics, conjoined twins, bearded ladies and lizard men to make the bizarre and the macabre appear just about routine." [...] Matt Casamassina of IGN added that [...] "from the opening sequence to the fade out on episode 12 , Carnivàle successfully draws <b>you</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Depression-engulfed world of its many oddly likeable characters.

[...] MSNBC acknowledged the characters [...] "speak in a dialogue that feels authentic, even if that authenticity is a modern interpretation [...] Carnivàle manager Samson, Michael J. Anderson gets the best dialogue, dropping terrifically incomprehensible lines." [...] DVD Talk lauded Amy Madigan (Iris), Tim DeKay (Jonesy), and Clea DuVall (Sofie) as [...] "fantastic choices" [...] with particularly convincing 1930s looks. They highlighted Carnivàles status as an ensemble show, with [...] "the performances of all the supporting characters [...] essential to the show's success.

In addition, the writer also found the track's content to be [...] "refreshing" [...] for displaying women [...] "muddy up right and wrong in a relationship." [...] From the same publication, Benjamin Chesna and Edwin Ortiz gave credits to the song for making infidelity sound [...] "empowering" [...] while praising Austin's [...] "silky smooth production," [...] concluding their article with a claim: [...] " [...] forced <b>you</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> arms of another lady, now you just have to keep it on the down low." [...] Slant Magazines editor Sal Cinquemani was reviewing the greatest hits album 20 when he observed that both of the girls' [...] "finest" [...] singles, [...] "Creep" [...] and [...] "Ain't 2 Proud 2 Beg", had them [...] "proudly flipping accepted modes of female sexual behavior and consent on their heads." [...] To boot the idea, Idolator journalist Robbie Daw explained the song's [...] "staying power" [...] was perhaps owed {{to the fact that it}} was a [...] "provocative" [...] track dared to expose the [...] "taboo, down-low" [...] aspects of a relationship. In the 2014 biopic CrazySexyCool: The TLC Story, [...] "Creep" [...] was served as the backdrop to a dramatic scene where Lopes' character set her then-boyfriend Rison's bathtub filled with tennis shoes on fire and destroyed their joint mansion due to his infidelity. Vibe Clover Hope watched the whole scene and realized how [...] "perfectly sexy and unapologetic" [...] the song was at the time of its first releasing. In contrary, one of Pitchfork contributors, Jess Harvell, felt its lyrics were [...] "unconscionable," [...] instead, he praised the song's groove that was [...] "so seductive you barely register what you're singing along to." [...] Harvell continued to say that Austin even managed to make scratching, [...] "that emblem of noisy hip-hop ruckus", sound [...] "smooth." [...] "No mean feat.," [...] he gave out an endnote. With Charles Aaron's review for Spin, he fictionalized a short story:After that, Aaron also went on to call the track as a whole a [...] "commercial/artistic apex" [...] for the producer. Including it on her list of best tracks that make people dance, Bernadette McNulty from The Telegraph claimed: [...] "The Dallas Austin groove on this is so deep, it might give you vertigo." [...] Ebony writer Michael A. Gonzales agreed, he said the girls' song [...] "put the sonic scientist that much closer to [...] dreams of making tracks as enticing and sexy as the ones his hero Prince created for Vanity 6 and Apollonia 6."
