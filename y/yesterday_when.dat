500|$|The gradual {{nature of}} the {{disaster}} was also more comforting, in some respects, compared {{with the nature of}} modern technological failures such as air crashes. Times reviewer made this point explicitly: [...] "This air age, when death comes too swiftly for heroism or with no survivors to record it, can still turn with wonder to an age before <b>yesterday</b> <b>when</b> a thousand deaths at sea seemed the very worst the world must suffer." [...] It was, as Steven Biel comments, [...] "a quainter kind of disaster" [...] in which the victims had time to prepare and chose how to die.|$|E
500|$|Crosby also {{fought to}} have the song [...] "Why" [...] (co-written with McGuinn) {{included}} on the album, despite it having already been issued as the B-side of the band's [...] "Eight Miles High" [...] single, some eleven months earlier. [...] However, the version of [...] "Why" [...] included on Younger Than Yesterday was recorded during sessions for that album and is a totally different take from the previously released B-side version. [...] Exactly why Crosby insisted on resurrecting the song, when there was newer original material in reserve, remains a mystery, although the Byrds' roadie, Jimmi Seiter, has speculated {{that it was an}} attempt to increase Crosby's share of the songwriting on the album. [...] Author Peter Lavezzoli has commented that [...] "Why" [...] features verses with a chord structure reminiscent of [...] "(Love Is Like a) Heat Wave" [...] by Martha and the Vandellas and a raga-flavored lead guitar solo inspired by the music of sitarist Ravi Shankar. [...] However, Rogan has noted that the song's Indian classical music influences were considerably watered down on the re-recorded version that appeared on Younger Than <b>Yesterday</b> <b>when</b> compared to the earlier B-side recording.|$|E

The singer laments for <b>yesterday</b> <b>when</b> {{he and his}} love were together, before she left because of something he said. McCartney is {{the only member of}} the Beatles to appear on the recording. The final recording was so different from other works by the Beatles that the band members vetoed the release of the song as a single in the United Kingdom, although other artists were quick to do so. It was issued as a single in the US in September 1965 and later released as a single in the UK in 1976.|$|E

2500|$|In the 13th century, Rabbi Isaac ben Samuel of Acre {{made the}} insight that, since Sabbatical cycles existed before man was created, time before Adam and Eve must be {{measured}} in divine years, not human years.

[...] Rabbi Isaac of Akko - who held like Livnat Ha-Sapir, {{that we are in}} the seventh Sabbatical cycle - therefore took the above figure of 42,000 years and multiplied it by 365,250 (he was using a 365.25-day year) to get 15,340,500,000 years for the age of the universe when Adam was created.|$|E

2500|$|The annual East-West Shrine Game of 1931 was {{replaced}} by a raucous Knights of Columbus game featuring the Savoldi All-Stars. [...] Prescott Sullivan, noted San Francisco Chronicle sportswriter, recounted the day's events in his January 26 column. [...] "Jumping Joe" [...] Savoldi gave some very sound reasons why Knute Rockne calls him [...] "modern football's greatest fullback" [...] <b>yesterday</b> <b>when</b> he led a team composed largely of California and U.S.C. stars to a 13-0 victory over Ernie Nevers and a supporting cast of St. Mary's players at Kezar Stadium. [...] More than 30,000 customers put the Knights of Columbus’ grid finales over in a big way and saw “Jumping Joe” and his playmates cinch their victory with two spectacular fourth period touchdowns. [...] These runs, end to end, constituted a very sizable day's work for [...] "Jumping Joe," [...] and the crowd showed it's deep appreciation by mobbing him at the finish of the ball game. Savoldi managed to escape by throwing his headgear to the milling throng, and long after the players had left the field of action, Joe's helmet was still {{at the center of a}} battle royal. [...] More than 200 enthusiastic souvenir hunters joined in the fight, which continued to rage unabated outside the stadium after police had managed to chase the combatants from the big bowl. Numerous black eyes were exchanged before mounted police finally quelled the uprising. [...] Such is Savoldi's fame!" ...|$|E

[...] Many of his colleagues in both newspaper and television reporting also offered tribute to Russert in this and other programs. Other major news agencies, including CBS, ABC, CNN, Fox News, and the BBC spent large segments of their programming on June 13 reporting about Russert's life and career. President George W. Bush stated in a news conference with French president Nicolas Sarkozy: [...] "America lost a really fine citizen <b>yesterday</b> <b>when</b> Tim Russert passed away. I’ve had the privilege of being interviewed by Tim Russert. I found him to be a hardworking, thorough, decent man. And Tim Russert loved his country, he loved his family, and he loved his job a lot."

2500|$|... 18 December 1940 :Boeing Y1B-17 Flying Fortress, 36–157, c/n 1981, {{formerly}} of the 2d Bomb Group, Langley Field, Virginia, transferred to the 93d Bomb Squadron, 19th Bomb Group, March Field, California, in October 1940, crashed E of San Jacinto, California, 3.5 miles NNW of Idyllwild, while en route to March Field. Pilot was John H. Turner. [...] "Six officers and men of the army's 93rd bombardment pursuit squadron , March field , were killed <b>yesterday</b> <b>when</b> their 22-ton B-17 four-motored bomber crashed and burned at the 6,700-foot snow line of Marion mountain in the San Jacinto range. Four bodies were hurled from the giant flying fortress as it plunged into the boulder-strewn, heavily-wooded mountain slope, three miles northeast of Idyllwild, in the San Bernardino national forest. The victims: First Lieut. Harold J. Turner, pilot, Riverside, {{formerly of}} Corning, Iowa. First Lieut. Donald T. Ward, co-pilot, Riverside, formerly of West Los Angeles. First Lieut. Vernon McCauley, navigator, Riverside. Staff Sergt. Thomas F. Sweet, engineer, Riverside. Corp. Frank J. Jirak, assistant engineer, Salem, Ore. Pvt. James C. Sessions, radioman, Bisbee, Ariz. At 10:45 a.m. yesterday the plane appeared to encounter mechanical trouble. Ground witnesses at the Idyllwild inn and at Pine Cove, nearby, reported that it circled several times, its engines seemingly missing. Clouds closed in on the bomber at 8,000 feet, {{and in a few}} minutes, it roared earthward at full throttle. A rescue party arrived 20 minutes later from Pine Cove to find the plane a mass of red-hot, fused metal. Two bodies were in the smashed fuselage. The 105-foot [...] wing had sheared through a big pine tree. Residents of the two resort towns said they had heard a loud explosion, indicating that the gasoline tanks ignited with the impact. The noise was heard as far as six miles. The crash occurred approximately 400 yards from the Banning-Idyllwild highway, near the home of Harris Marchant, writer. It was the first accident to one of the new Boeing four-motored bombers since the army air corps adopted them as standard equipment, although the original model smashed up at Dayton, Ohio, in 1935. Members of an army board of inquiry said at least two, and possibly three or all of the four motors were cut out {{at the time of the}} crash, although there was no apparent indication that any of the occupants had attempted to bail out. They expressed the theory that pilot Turner was attempting to shift gasoline tanks when he ran into a cloud bank that concealed the side of the mountain. Fliers in the squadron described the wrecked bomber as a ship which had caused difficulty in stalled motors twice in flights when it was stationed at Langley Field, Virginia. Lieutenant Turner was an army air corps reseve veteran of six years experience and was on a practice flight with the B-17. March field [...] operates 36 of these bombers. With a full load, they can climb to 30,000 feet. Lieutenant Turner is survived by his widow, Kathryn, Riverside, and his father, J. H. Turner, Corning, Iowa. He was the nephew of former Iowa Gov. Dan W. Turner. Co-Pilot Ward leaves a widow in Riverside and a father, E. A. Ward, West Los Angeles. Navigator McCauley leaves his widow, Mrs. Virginia McCauley, Riverside. Sweet's widow, Mrs. Anna M. Sweet, lives in Riverside. Jirak's father, Frank J. Jirak, lives in Salem, Ore., and Session's mother lives in Bisbee, Ariz." ...|$|E
