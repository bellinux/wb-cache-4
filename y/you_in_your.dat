He {{continued}} his frequent travels and casual homosexual liaisons, and was hostile to her efforts to control or change any aspect of his life. In 1961 she wrote to him: [...] "I have tried for ten years to make a compromise with <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> extraordinary mode of life and have now given up." [...] Thereafter they often lived apart, though they never formally separated. Even after a final breach in 1971, they remained legally married.|$|E
500|$|... "Birthday" [...] {{contains}} elements of funk-pop, synthpop, and disco house. The song {{is backed by}} a [...] "busy but buoyant" [...] instrumentation featuring a [...] "deeply rhythmic impulse". Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times felt [...] "Birthday" [...] was a musically updated version of disco, achieved by replacing [...] "cheesy strings" [...] with [...] "jerky breaks and synth washes". Its [...] "joyful" [...] lyrics present the commemoration of her partner's birthday {{as a metaphor for}} sexual intercourse. The bridge section of [...] "Birthday", which sees Perry singing [...] "Let me get <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> birthday suit / It's time to bring out the big balloons", was found by Ben Rattliff to resemble French duo Daft Punk's works.|$|E

Someone once said to me, 'If you have no shadows then you're not standing in the light.' So the song is about washing the feet of both good and evil and understanding and forgiving the demons from your past in order to move into the greatness of your future. I just like really aggressive metaphors—harder, thicker, darker—and my fans do as well. So it is a very challenging and aggressive metaphor, but it {{is a metaphor}}.|$|E

500|$|The first interracial kiss on {{television}} {{is a much}} debated topic concerning who the first two persons of different races to kiss {{on television}} were. For a time, it was understood to have occurred during an episode of the British soap opera Emergency– Ward 10 in 1964. However, in November 2015, a Granada Play of the Week, <b>You</b> <b>in</b> <b>Your</b> Small Corner, was uncovered which was broadcast in June 1962; that quickly led to the rediscovery of another play featuring the same young Jamaican actor, Hot Summer Night, televised in Britain on 1 February 1959. The first interracial kiss on U.S. television was broadcast in a 1960 episode of Adventures in Paradise, [...] "Makaha Surfing", also known as [...] "The Big Surf", between star Gardner McKay and Filipina Pilar Seurat.

500|$|One of the {{earliest}} interracial kisses on television occurred in a July 1964 episode of British soap opera Emergency Ward 10, during which characters Louise Mahler (portrayed by Joan Hooley) and Giles Farmer (portrayed by John White) kissed. The scene in which Mahler and Farmer kissed was originally scripted to occur in Mahler's bedroom, but was rewritten so as to occur outdoors, due to concerns it would otherwise be too risqué (the earlier Lloyd Reckord plays had both been shown well after the 9pm adult-content watershed). According to an issue of the Daily Express published after the episode aired, [...] "not a viewer rang-up to complain". In a 2015 interview, conducted prior {{to the discovery of}} the <b>You</b> <b>in</b> <b>Your</b> Small Corner footage, Hooley noted that the historic importance of what had been known as the [...] "first interracial kiss on television" [...] had been inflated in popular memory: ...|$|E

500|$|Themes of {{religious}} salvation and allusions to the Bible appear only briefly in Barton Fink, but their presence pervades the story.

[...] This passage reflects Barton's inability {{to make sense of}} his own experiences (wherein Audrey has been [...] "cut in pieces"), as well as the [...] "hopes and dreams" [...] of [...] "the common man". Nebuchadnezzar is also the title of a novel that Mayhew gives to Barton as a [...] "little entertainment" [...] to [...] "divert <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> sojourn among the Philistines".|$|E

After this reappearance, Patrick Day from the Los Angeles Times {{hoped they would}} be featured more often, saying [...] "If they brought these two back ... just to kill them, it will be anti-climactic". Entertainment Weeklys Jeff Jensen called their return a [...] "sight-for-sore-eyes". Maureen Ryan from the Chicago Tribune thought Rose was speaking for the fans when she said [...] "If you say 'live together, die alone' to me, Jack, I'm going to punch <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> face", and hoped Rose and Bernard would feature more often in future episodes. The couple were ranked twelfth in IGN's list of the top fifteen characters from the first three seasons. The critics from IGN also liked Rose's [...] "live together, die alone" [...] line, which they called [...] "both surprising comic relief and the stuff of solid character development; characters like Rose remember and evolve, even if they {{spend most of their}} time on the sidelines". The couple were called [...] "the unofficial heart of the show" [...] by the critics, who noted every appearance made by them was a welcome one. Erin Martell from TV Squad thought Rose's role in [...] "Something Nice Back Home" [...] was [...] "awesome", because she asked all the questions fans have been asking.|$|E
500|$|Brooks {{suffered}} {{from a lack of}} motivation after the Olympics. He was recruited to the Australian Institute of Sport by swimming coaches Bill Sweetenham and Dennis Pursley, but his stay was brief. The inaugural director Don Talbot, a former head coach of the Australian swimming team, expelled him for indiscipline. He then won the 1981 Australian title in the 100m freestyle without training, but his time of 52.61s was substantially slower than his personal best. Brooks then accepted a scholarship to go to the University of Arkansas to train under Sam Freas. He enjoyed the more liberal culture in the American collegiate system, particularly the relationship between swimmers and their coaches. He enjoyed the less paternalistic treatment that the coaches accorded to their swimmers, saying that [...] "In Australia, after a race they want to lock <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> room. In America, you can share a beer after the meet with the coach." [...] The shortcourse pools used in the United States played into the hands of Brooks, as his strong legs gave him an advantage in pushing away from the turns, which came twice as often in comparison to longcourse (50m) pools. He had initially planned to stay in the United States for only a year, but decided to extend his stay by a year, having enjoyed the high frequency of racing and the recognition accorded to university athletes in the United States. In both years, he won the 50m and 100m freestyle double in the Southwest Conference, and was fourth in the 100m freestyle at the 1981 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Championships. He also came second in the 100m freestyle at the AACC Championships to Rowdy Gaines, who {{went on to win the}} event at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics.|$|E

Official Nintendo Magazine UK praised the Wii version's puzzles, story, and art direction, and complimented the new hint system, finishing with: [...] "One of the best point-and-click games ever, this will appeal to both newcomers and fans". Gaming and technology journalist James Woodcock said of the iPhone version: [...] "There {{are quite a few}} point and click adventures to choose from on the Apple iTunes Store and Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars is one of the finer selections if not the best to give your heartfelt attentions to and best of all travels with <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> pocket." [...] He also praised its story, puzzles, writing and art direction. Slide to Play also complimented the iPad version, saying: [...] "Broken Sword: Director's Cut HD is a great game that nearly anyone can enjoy. Our one caveat is that if you played through it on the iPhone, then the HD version probably doesn't offer enough new content to warrant another purchase. But if you're new to the game or you haven't played it in a while, this is the version to get. The iPad truly is the ideal platform for adventure games."
