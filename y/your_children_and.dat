First, Kennedy himself had spoken of the {{importance}} of planting trees in Israel, when he had addressed a 1958 Jewish National Fund meeting while serving as a junior Senator from Massachusetts, saying, [...] "What work could be more heartwarming or more enduring than the great forest at Jerusalem. <b>Your</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> grandchildren when they visit Israel will find your monument". [...] Second, Warren recalled that Kennedy had visited Israel twice, the first time in 1939 when it was still part of the British Mandate, and the second time in 1951. Speaking in 1951 {{of the differences between the}} people he witnessed during those two visits, he said that [...] "Perhaps the greatest change of all I found in the hearts and minds of the people, For unlike the discouraged settlers of 1939 they looked to the future with hope. I found a revival of an ancient spirit". Warren concluded his remarks by saying he would use the same word that President Kennedy would have used: [...] "Shalom." ...|$|E
500|$|In the New Testament, the messianic {{expectations}} {{found in}} early Judaism were fulfilled {{on the day}} of Pentecost as recorded in Acts. The Christian community was gathered together in Jerusalem when a sound from heaven like rushing wind was heard and tongues like tongues of flame rested on everyone. They were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in tongues, miraculously praising God in foreign languages. A crowd gathered and was addressed by the Apostle Peter who stated that the occurrence was the fulfillment of the prophecy of Joel 2, [...] "And in the last days it shall be, God declares, that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy". He then explained how the Spirit came to be poured out, recounting Jesus’ ministry and passion and then proclaiming his resurrection and enthronement at the right hand of God. In response, the crowd asked Peter what they should do. He responded that they should repent and be baptized for the forgiveness of sins in order to receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. Peter finished his speech stating that the promise [...] "is for you and for <b>your</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> for all who are far off, everyone whom the Lord our God calls to himself".|$|E

Thorough its spokesman, the group anticipated that [...] " [...] ineptitude and impotency" [...] the government would exploit the crisis to privatize profits and socialize losses, citing the privatization of the turnpike system, Luis Munoz Marin Airport, the Puerto Rico Telephone Company and the Teodoro Moscoso Bridge as previous examples of this tendency. The EBP expressed dissatisfaction in what they perceived as [...] "an environment of indifference" [...] within sectors of local society that [...] "still expect magic solutions" [...] from those responsible for the crisis, which serves as a hindrance to the militant action that they pursue. Commander Guasábara then offers an alliance that oversees previous differences. In asking the rhetoric question [...] "What would you do for yourself, <b>your</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> your country?" [...] the Macheteros urged the public to hold an investigation and [...] "judge those responsible" [...] for what they consider an [...] "irresponsible and unnecessary debt [...] the corrupt administrations that we have tolerated for 50 years". The EPB concluded this press release by urging the public to [...] "take the streets and manifest their anger {{in the way that they}} prefer", but not before stating that the time for marches was gone and that it is [...] "time to take action".|$|E

500|$|EastEnders has {{received}} {{praise for the}} handling of Peggy's breast cancer storyline, as she was a rare media portrayal of an older matriarchal woman with the disease. Older women are at higher risk of being diagnosed; however, in 2001, {{it was reported that}} media representation of breast cancer is skewed towards younger women in their 20s or 30s, as they are seen as [...] "more tragic" [...] or [...] "more sexy" [...] in media terms. A 2000 study by Kitzinger and Henderson showed that 94% of newspaper coverage on non-celebrity women with breast cancer was on those aged under 50. Source organisations working with EastEnders on the storyline have commented: [...] " [...] decided {{it was going to be}} [...] and very rightly so. Bang on, the right age [...] perfect dramatic licence in terms of her sons that she was going to have to share this terrible news with, and how would she share it? Every female would have that problem. How would you tell <b>your</b> <b>children?</b> <b>And</b> they followed that with her. She was exactly the right person." [...] The storyline also received media criticism, for the use of a breast care nurse, who was used to counsel Peggy and translate medical terminology into lay terms for viewers; a character who could provide both a dramatic and educational purpose. However, not all oncology units in the UK offer breast care nurses, and the character presented [...] "particularly positive messages" [...] concerning patient choice and control over treatment options. Because of this, the UK press dubbed the storyline [...] "didactic". The storyline was also criticised because Peggy received her cancer test results after six days, which prompted cancer charities to warn that not all patients would receive the same treatment.|$|E
2500|$|A Baraita deduced {{from the}} words [...] "you shall make them known to <b>your</b> <b>children,</b> <b>and</b> your children's children" [...] in [...] {{that if a}} parent teaches a child Torah, Scripture ascribes merit as though the parent had taught the child, the child's children, and so on, {{until the end of}} all time. Rabbi Joshua ben Levi taught that if a parent teaches a child (or some say a grandchild) Torah, Scripture {{accounts}} it as if the parent had received the Torah at Mount Sinai, as [...] says, [...] "And you shall make them known to <b>your</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> your children's children," [...] and immediately thereafter, [...] says, [...] "The day that you stood before the Lord your God in Horeb." [...] Rabbi Hiyya bar Abba once found Rabbi Joshua ben Levi, who had hurriedly thrown a cloth upon his head, taking his child (or some say grandchild) to the synagogue to study. When Rabbi Hiyya asked Rabbi Joshua what was going on, Rabbi Joshua replied that it was no small thing that the words [...] "you shall make them known to <b>your</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> your children's children" [...] are immediately followed by the words [...] "The day that you stood before the Lord your God in Horeb." [...] From then on, Rabbi Hiyya bar Abba did not eat breakfast before revising the previous day's lesson with his child (or some say grandchild) and adding another verse. And Rabbah son of Rav Huna did not eat breakfast until he took his child (or some say grandchild) to school.|$|E

You have already established between <b>your</b> <b>child</b> <b>and</b> yourself the dynamic relation in the further plane of consciousness.
