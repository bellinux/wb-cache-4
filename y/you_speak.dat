25|$|In the Dialogi de Vita Martini I, 26 by Sulpicius Seuerus (AD 363–425), {{one of the}} {{partners}} in the dialogue utters the rhetorical commonplace that his deficient Latin might insult the ears of his partners. One of them answers: uel Celtice aut si mauis Gallice loquere dummodo Martinum loquaris ‘speak Celtic or, if you prefer, Gaulish, as long as <b>you</b> <b>speak</b> about Martin’.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{long history}} of using both fag and faggot in popular culture, usually in {{reference}} to lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people. Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman's 1995 documentary The Celluloid Closet, based on Vito Russo's book of the same name notes the use of fag and faggot throughout Hollywood film history. The Think Before <b>You</b> <b>Speak</b> campaign has sought to stop fag and gay being used as generic insults.|$|E
25|$|Haydée Santamaría and Melba Hernandez {{were the}} only women {{who participated in the}} attack on the Moncada Barracks, {{afterward}} acting alongside Natalia Revuelta, and Lidia Castro (Fidel Castro’s sister) to form alliances with anti-Batista organizations, as well as the assembly and distribution of “History Will Absolve Me”. Celia Sanchez and Vilma Espin were leading strategists and highly skilled combatants who held essential roles throughout the revolution. Tete Puebla, founding member and second in command of the Mariana Grajales Platoon, said of Celia Sanchez, “When <b>you</b> <b>speak</b> of Celia, you’ve got to speak of Fidel, and vice versa. Celia’s ideas touched almost everything in the Sierra.|$|E

25|$|<b>You</b> <b>speak</b> truly, O Achilli, and {{we cannot}} answer you a word. You are a Priest; {{you have been}} a Friar; you are, it is undeniable, the scandal of Catholicism, and the palmary {{argument}} of Protestants, by your extraordinary depravity. You have been, it is true, a profligate, an unbeliever, and a hypocrite. Not many years passed of your conventional life, and you were never in the choir, always in private houses, so that the laity observed you. You were deprived of your professorship, we own it; you were prohibited from preaching and hearing confessions; you were obliged to give hush-money to the father of one of your victims, as we learned from an official document of the Neapolitan Police to be 'known for habitual incontinency;' your name came before the civil tribunal at Corfu for your crime of adultery. You have put the crown on your offences, by as long as you could, denying them all; you have professed to seek after truth, when you were ravening after sin.|$|E

500|$|... "What's Your Name" [...] is an midtempo electro song, and bases its melody on {{thrusting}} new wave-influenced synths. It {{contains a}} [...] "whimsical" [...] beat that utilizes sirens and wind instruments. Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune compared the song's synth riff {{to the music}} that was popular during the 1980s MTV generation, while John Soeder from The Plain Dealer noted its similarity to British duo the Eurythmics. Usher monotonously repeats the pick-up line hook, [...] "What's your name?", and thereby pays homage to his bachelor history. The song's lyrics describe [...] "the feeling {{you get when you}} run into a woman that makes <b>you</b> <b>speak</b> gibberish".|$|E

You hear from my tone it's appropriate to feel sorry for me. As I drop to a faint whisper (which she does), you'll feel the sorrow yourself. I'm going to finish now, pretend to cry", which she does as she walks off.|$|E
500|$|Lennon gave Mimi an {{allowance}} of £30 per week, {{but when she}} found out that his wife's mother was being given the same amount, she phoned the Lennons' house and said, [...] "What has she [...] done to deserve anything? Tell John, when <b>you</b> <b>speak</b> to him, that I am very, very annoyed", before slamming down the phone. Lennon moved to New York in 1971, and never returned to England again. Despite losing touch with several family members, he kept in close contact with her and telephoned her every week. On 5 December 1980, three days before Lennon was murdered, he called her to say he was homesick and was planning a trip back to England. After Lennon's death, Mimi was furious to find out that he had never transferred the ownership of the house over to her, which meant that Ono owned the house, and could sell it at any time.|$|E

When we tell them about our experience, Saudi Arabia listens as somebody who is {{not in any way}} an enemy of Pakistan, but a friend of Pakistan and, therefore, will listen with sympathy and concern to a matter of this nature". He was asked whether India expected Saudi Arabia, given its close ties with Islamabad, to help address the terror threat from Pakistan. The remark about Saudi Arabia being a [...] "valuable interlocutor" [...] raised a strong reaction within the Indian political circle. The Pakistani press even went on to report that he had proposed that Saudi Arabia play a mediator's role in improving India's relationship with Pakistan. In response, Tharoor denied that 'interlocutor' meant 'mediator', and tweeted an explanation, saying, [...] "An [...] is someone <b>you</b> <b>speak</b> to. If I speak to you, you are my interlocutor. I mentioned the Saudis as our interlocutors, i.e. the people we are here to speak to".|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} on The John and Ken Show on KFI, Headley {{was asked if he}} experienced retaliation from Scientology for speaking critically about the organization. He said that he had been issued a declaration that he was to be considered a [...] "Suppressive Person" [...] by members of the organization, and explained, [...] "That's basically the thing that goes out to anyone and everyone who is in Scientology, saying, 'This person is a Suppressive Person, and you can no longer speak to him ever again.' If you are in Scientology, and <b>you</b> <b>speak</b> to somebody who is a Suppressive Person, you yourself can be declared a Suppressive Person." [...] Headley said when he left Scientology the organization gave him a [...] "freeloader statement", a bill for US$62,000, for courses he had received in Scientology. [...] "It's actually illegal, because they are basically charging me for on-the-job training – in California you can't charge somebody for on-the-job training. It's of no real value, but you don't know that, when you're in Scientology. You think, 'Are they going to garnish my wages, are they going to sue me?' You don't know," [...] said Headley.|$|E
500|$|Seward {{had mixed}} {{feelings}} {{about the man who}} had blocked him from the presidency. One story is that when Seward was told that to deny Carl Schurz an office would disappoint him, Seward angrily stated, [...] "Disappointment! [...] <b>You</b> <b>speak</b> of me of disappointment! [...] To me, who was justly entitled to the Republican nomination for the presidency, and who had to stand aside and see it given to a little Illinois lawyer!" [...] Despite his initial reservations about Lincoln's abilities, he came to admire Lincoln as the president grew more confident in his job. [...] Seward wrote to his wife in June 1861, [...] "Executive skill and vigor are rare qualities. The President is the best of us, but he needs constant and assiduous cooperation." [...] According to Goodwin, [...] "Seward would become his most faithful ally in the cabinet... Seward's mortification at not having received his party's nomination never fully abated, but he no longer felt compelled to belittle Lincoln to ease his pain." [...] Lincoln, a one-term congressman, was inexperienced in Washington ways, and relied on Seward's advice on protocol and social etiquette.|$|E

500|$|Eccleston {{stated in}} April 2004 {{that he did}} not believe his Doctor would be [...] "as {{eccentric}} and as foppish as he was in some of his incarnations". Russell T Davies characterised the character as a [...] "stripped down" [...] version of previous Doctors. Regarding the Ninth Doctor's less eccentric character, Davies stated: [...] "He travels in time and space, he's got two hearts, he's a Time Lord— that's eccentric enough to be getting on with". In contrast with previous Doctors, the Ninth Doctor speaks with a distinct Northern accent. Remarking on this aspect of his characterisation Eccleston states that the character [...] "is a scientist and an intellectual, {{and a lot of people}} seem to think you can only be those things if <b>you</b> <b>speak</b> with received pronunciation which, of course, is rubbish." [...] In regards to the Doctor's costume, consisting of simply a black leather coat and dark trousers, Eccleston stated, [...] "I didn't want the costume to be my performance" [...] and that [...] "I wanted any flamboyance and colour to come out of my acting." [...] Eccleston thought that as the Doctor he should show a [...] "slight dark side" [...] but also bring out a lighter side. Executive producer Julie Gardner observed that the Ninth Doctor gave Eccleston the chance to be [...] "very intense but also frivolous as well." ...|$|E
500|$|Even by the {{standards}} of the British Army, the Regiment (and the 1st Battalion in particular) seems to have gained a reputation during the First World War for profane language. When the 1st Battalion was relieved in the front line following its defence of Delville Wood in September 1916, one of the advanced posts was missed out by mistake. The Lance-Corporal in command, suspecting something was amiss, sent a man back to the front-line trench to investigate. The soldier realised he was at some risk of being shot by his own side, and so [...] "when he had crawled within shouting distance he enquired politely but firmly what —— bastards were holding that —— trench. The 9th East Surreys, who were the troops thus addressed, recognised the North Stafford idiom and let him in unhurt". Bernard Martin, who served as a 2nd Lieutenant with the 1st Battalion, records another incident which probably took place in 1917, when (very unusually) the battalion was addressed at a church parade by a general, who railed against [...] "the disgusting word many of you utter every time <b>you</b> <b>speak.</b> ... I tell you again this indecent word is not to be used any longer. It is so common amongst you that it has become the shameful nickname by which your battalion is known throughout my Division". As the parade ended, one soldier was heard to ask, [...] "What was that bugger gassing about?"; to which another replied, [...] "Buggered if I know, I was having a kip. Where's the old bugger gone now?".|$|E
