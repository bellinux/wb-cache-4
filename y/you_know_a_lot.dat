500|$|Ben Stein's famous {{monotonous}} lecture {{about the}} Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act was not originally in Hughes's script. Stein, by happenstance, was lecturing off-camera to the amusement {{of the student}} cast. [...] "I {{was just going to}} do it off camera, but the student extras laughed so hard when they heard my voice that (Hughes) said do it on camera, improvise, something <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> about. When I gave the lecture about supply-side economics, I thought they were applauding. Everybody on the set applauded. I thought they were applauding because they had learned something about supply-side economics. But they were applauding because they thought I was boring...It was the best day of my life", Stein said.|$|E
500|$|A {{spinster}} {{for many}} years, Mavis resisted the advances of men, often {{too shy to}} allow dating to progress beyond {{the initial stages of}} courtship. Ian Randall comments that [...] "Many a man has been smitten with Mavis Riley, but unfortunately she always seemed to attract the drippier of the male species". In 1976 a love interest was introduced for Mavis in the form of Derek Wilton (Peter Baldwin), {{but it was more than}} a decade before the couple finally married in 1988, after simultaneously jilting each other four years earlier. Barbara Knox, who plays Rita, said, [...] "She [...] was quite a tough little character. <b>You</b> <b>know,</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of girls would have gone through with , and she stuck to her guns and said 'No, no this isn't right.' Again, dithering and weepy, but she was tough enough to do it. That scene [...] is reflective of the two of them. That was the essence of the friendship, they stuck up for each other and [...] great friends, all the way through." ...|$|E
500|$|On January 15, 1996, Yankovic began {{recording}} the lead single for the album, [...] "Amish Paradise". Yankovic felt that parodying Coolio would pay off, because Coolio had [...] "such an identifiable image {{that a lot}} of things could be done [...] ". He noted, [...] "I like to play around with people that have some- <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of style as opposed to somebody who's kind of homogonized [...] and bland and has no personality, and Coolio certainly kind of sticks out in a crowd." [...] Yankovic felt that juxtaposing the original song's [...] "gangsta" [...] themes with the Amish lifestyle would produce a humorous end result. After Yankovic revealed to his label that he would be doing a Coolio parody, they requested that the album artwork for the release also parody Coolio. Yankovic had been toying with the name Bad Hair Day for a time and felt that he could adequately use the name and lampoon Coolio – who was known for his distinct hair style – at the same time. The final parody recorded for the album, [...] "Syndicated Inc.", is a parody of [...] "Misery" [...] by Soul Asylum, a loving ode to syndicated television.|$|E

5000|$|... "That {{includes}} Chinese, Middle Easterners.

And they mix. They mix in. And those people, their only goal in life is to, to cause harm to the United States. So why do we want them here, either legally or illegally? When they come across the border, besides the trash that they leave behind, the drug smuggling, the killings, the beheadings. I mean, you are seeing stuff. It’s a war out there." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I don't {{think it}} is worth while trying to follow them up," [...] said the senator's son.

50|$|Dizzy Gillespie has stated,He has the flow, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> which <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of guys don't {{have and}} won't ever get. Yeah.

6000|$|... "I hope so," [...] replied Dotty. [...] "I {{certainly}} shall if {{the snow}} {{does not get}} so deep that I cannot get enough to eat. Some of these weeds are so tall {{that it will take}} a lot of snow to cover them, {{and as long as the}} tops are above the snow I will have nothing to worry about. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of seeds remain in these tops all winter. But if the snow gets deep enough to cover these I shall have to move along farther south." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Where do {{you think}} that dreadful baby has turned up? Over at Pat Floyd's. He found her in the water pipes. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of those big ones are lying in the back street ready to use as soon as the place is dug. Well, that little rascal crept in, and then couldn't turn round, so she went on till she came out by Pat's house, and nearly scared him out of his wits. The pipes were not joined, so she had light and air, but I guess she had a hard road to travel. Such a hot, dirty, tired baby you never saw. Mrs. Floyd is washing her up. You'd better go and get her, Bess." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is {{no fear of}} that, Mark; and as {{the ring}} is all the fashion now, I can assure you it would be {{considered}} in good taste, though I own that in point of art most of these things leave a good deal to be desired. Now that that important thing is settled, suppose you come and lunch with me in Covent Garden? I don't belong to a club yet, though I have got my name down {{at a couple of}} them, but as far as I can see they are slow sort of places unless <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of people. The coffee houses are much more amusing; you see people of all sorts there--fellows like myself, who have no clubs to go to; country gentlemen up for a week; a few writers, who, by the way, are not the best customers of these places; men whom nobody knows, and men whom everybody knows. Of course, the best time to see them is of an evening." ...|$|E

5000|$|His father {{arranged}} {{for him to}} study with jazz percussionists Bill Douglass and Chuck Flores. Despite his jazz roots he admits that his interest in performing rock music {{was an act of}} rebellion. [...] "I used to drive my parents crazy with this. I told my father a few years before he died, <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of times I played that music 'cause I just wanted to see the look on your face.".|$|E
5000|$|... "I {{wrote the}} song {{right after we}} did the interview, {{inspired}} by that and also some of the criticism we’ve received {{over the past couple}} years. If we tried to record some song that was a response to criticism as it happened, that would be too heavy-handed. The lyrics stayed true to the original off-the-cuff feel, what you call a rant. But it's not such a big deal, <b>you</b> <b>know.</b> <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> of that stuff just doesn't merit a response." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No. That is, they hadn't up to {{the time}} we left. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> it takes <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> {{of time and money}} to sink an oil well. But they did us out of our farm, and that's bad enough." ...|$|R

5000|$|As <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of {{my music}} is compositional, and there's {{a lot of}} arpeggiated guitar parts.

I've studied it very precisely. I can't play it, but I understand it. What Deborah has {{is a little different}} because she has a strap-on harp with a particular range. ...

5000|$|Following the {{broadcast}} of the sixth episode, wholesale chain Makro and manufacturer Wyke Farms both criticised the programme over negative comments made about its cheese. In the episode, Paul Callaghan was verbally blasted by Alan Sugar for taking the inexpensive product to sell in France, which led both parties to refute {{the belief that the}} cheese was not popular in the country. Richard Clothier, the Managing Director of Wyke Farms, was quoted in regards to the matter by stating: [...] "Alan Sugar, <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> about electronics, but not that much about cheese, and for that reason, you're fired!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Then Soames, without {{lifting his}} eyes, began: [...] "I've had this letter from Bosinney. You {{see what he}} says; I thought I'd let <b>you</b> <b>know.</b> I've spent <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> more than I {{intended}} on this house, and I want the position to be clear." ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{four members}} {{appeared}} on stage together on October 1, 2006, following a Gnarls Barkley show, stating {{that they were}} back together and on good terms. They officially announced {{they were working on}} an album and the group's reunion November 19, 2007, on Atlanta's V-103 radio station. On September 19, 2009, Goodie Mob performed for the first official reunion concert at the Masquerade in Atlanta, Georgia.

5000|$|Bogdanovich {{later said}} he [...] "got paid <b>you</b> <b>know</b> not <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of money" [...] {{for the book}} [...] "and it was much reviled upon its appearance.
