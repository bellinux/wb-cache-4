[...] The Book of Abraham makes explicit reference to this facsimile, noting: [...] "That <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> {{knowledge of this}} altar, I will refer you to the representation at the commencement of this record." [...] Egyptologists, however, claim {{that it is a}} vignette taken from a version of The Book of Breathings, also known as the [...] "Breathing Permit", copied for a Theban priest named Hôr. A comparison of Smith’s interpretation of the facsimile, and that of Egyptologists is as follows: ...|$|E

A squadron of British vessels stationed there stopped the Tonquin and detained {{it for a}} day. The following day, orders from Commodore Pellew arrived, detailing that the Tonquin was to be freed immediately and sent Fanning [...] "his apology for your detention, and his good wishes, that <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> pleasant and safe passage." [...] Prior to {{the departure of the}} principal British officers, a toast to the United States and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland was held.

2500|$|A {{central theme}} in Catherine Doherty's spirituality is [...] "the {{duty of the}} moment". As she herself put it:The duty of the moment is what you should be doing at any given time, in {{whatever}} place God has put you. You may not have Christ in a homeless person at your door, but <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> little child. If you have a child, your duty of the moment may be to change a dirty diaper. So you do it. But you don't just change that diaper, you change it {{to the best of}} your ability, with great love for both God and that child.... There are all kinds of good Catholic things you can do, but whatever they are, you have to realize that there is always the duty of the moment to be done. And it must be done, because the duty of the moment is the duty of God.|$|E

2500|$|Disjunction resembles {{conjunction}} in that {{it forms}} a proposition out of two simpler propositions. [...] We write it , and it is read [...] " [...] or [...] ". [...] It expresses that either [...] or [...] is true. [...] Thus, in the cases listed above, the disjunction of [...] with [...] is true in all cases except case 4. [...] Using the example above, the disjunction expresses that it is either raining outside or there is a cold front over Kansas. [...] (Note, this use of disjunction is supposed to resemble {{the use of the}} English word [...] "or". [...] However, it is most like the English inclusive [...] "or", which can be used to express the truth of at least one of two propositions. [...] It is not like the English exclusive [...] "or", which expresses the truth of exactly one of two propositions. [...] That is to say, the exclusive [...] "or" [...] is false when both [...] and [...] are true (case 1). [...] An example of the exclusive or is: [...] <b>You</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> bagel or a pastry, but not both. Often in natural language, given the appropriate context, the addendum [...] "but not both" [...] is omitted but implied. In mathematics, however, [...] "or" [...] is always inclusive or; if exclusive or is meant it will be specified, possibly by [...] "xor".) ...|$|E

60|$|So, therefore, when I now repeat {{my former}} statement, {{that the first}} main {{opposition}} between the Northern and Southern schools is in {{the simplicity of the}} one, and the scholarship of the other, that statement may imply sometimes the superiority of the North, and sometimes of the South. <b>You</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> heavenly simplicity opposed to a hellish (that is to say, a lustful and arrogant) scholarship; or <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> barbarous and presumptuous ignorance opposed to a divine and disciplined wisdom.
