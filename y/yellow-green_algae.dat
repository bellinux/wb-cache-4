40|$|Abstract. Photosynthesis {{in plants}} {{is a very}} {{complicated}} process, utilizing two photosystems in series {{to carry out the}} very energy-demanding process of oxidizing water to molecular oxygen and reducing carbon dioxide to organic compounds. The first photosynthetic organisms, living more than 3. 4, perhaps even 3. 8 Ga, i. e. American billion (10 9) years ago, carried out a simpler process, without oxygen production and with only one photosystem. A great variety of such one-photosystem photosynthesizers are living even today, and by comparing them, and from chemical fossils, researchers are trying to piece together a picture of the course of the earliest evolution of photosynthesis. Chlorophyll a probably preceded bacteriochlorophyll a as a main pigment for conversion of light into life energy. The process of carbon dioxide assimilation, today taking place mainly in conjunction with photosynthesis, is even older than photosynthesis itself. Oxygenic photosynthesis, i. e. photosynthetic production of molecular oxygen, first appeared in ancestors of present-day cyanobacteria more than 2. 7, perhaps already 3. 7 Ga ago. Cyanobacteria entered into close association with other organisms more than 1. 2 Ga ago, and chloroplasts in green algae and green plants as well as those in algae on the "red " line of evolution (red algae, cryptophytes, diatoms, brown <b>algae,</b> <b>yellow-green</b> <b>alga...</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{degree of}} the {{negative}} effects of the morphology of cyanobacterial filaments on daphnids is usually explained by the density of filaments and only one morphological parameter, such as length. Several authors have reported that Daphnia prefer short filaments (Holm and Shapiro 1984; Oberhaus et al. 2007) because they are easier to ingest (Dawidowicz 1990). Panosso and Lürling (2010) studied the role of filament length of C. raciborskii on the grazing of D. magna. These authors did not support hypothesis that long filaments affect more negatively on Daphnia clearance rate than short filaments. In their view, only filaments longer than 200  μm should reveal the importance of filament length for Daphnia. Recently, Bednarska et al. (2014) demonstrated that filaments of C. raciborskii longer than 50  μm caused reduction in growth and fecundity of several clones of Daphnia. However, the effect of the thickness of filaments has been overlooked, and {{there is a lack of}} knowledge concerning the importance of filament thickness to the life history of Daphnia. Various species of filamentous cyanobacteria can have substantially different filament widths. For example, morphological analyses of planktonic cyanobacteria from Belgium and Luxemburg carried out by Willame et al. (2006) revealed clear differences in cell widths among filamentous cyanobacteria such as Aphanizomenon issatschenkoi (mean[*]±[*]SD: 2.8 [*]±[*] 0.3  μm), Aphanizomenon gracile (3.6 [*]±[*] 0.3  μm), Planktothrix agardhii (5.5 [*]±[*] 0.5  μm) and Lyngbya sp. (8.5 [*]±[*] 0.7  μm). The results of Nadin-Hurley and Duncan (1976) suggest that filament thickness, rather than length, appears to be a limiting factor for Daphnia grazing. These authors observed long but narrow and pliant filaments of the <b>yellow-green</b> <b>alga</b> Tribonema sp. in Daphnia’s guts, while wider filaments became stuck and crowded closely together in the mouth. Moreover, Cerbin et al. (2013) observed a widening of A. gracile’s filaments in the presence of Daphnia, which was interpreted as a defence mechanism against grazing. These results suggest that filament width can shape the interactions between Daphnia and filamentous cyanobacteria. Considering the above-mentioned reports, we hypothesised that, when the biomasses of two non-toxic cyanobacteria are similar, the species with thicker filaments will have a stronger negative effect on the life history of Daphnia than the species with thinner filaments.|$|R

These “kleptoplasts” stay active in the digestive tract of the sea slug for several months. Chloroplasts from Vaucheria litorea are also reported to be significantly more stable after in vitro isolation than chloroplasts of other algae or of higher plants. In organello assays with isolated chloroplasts are used in studies on photosynthetical and biochemical processes in these organelles, chloroplast-nucleus communication, plant development and plant responses to environmental changes. The major limiting factor of the chloroplast in organello systems is the rapid decline in function and intactness of the plastids. This study is investigating the stability and longevity of chloroplasts isolated from V. litorea and its relative V. bursata in comparison to an angiosperm Pisum sativum. The structural intactness of the chloroplasts was investigated by phase contrast microscopy and the overall transcriptional activities were analyzed by run-on transcription assays. The recently completed sequence of the plastid genome from V. litorea has made it possible to investigate also the specific changes in isolated chloroplasts on the transcriptional level. The expression patterns of chloroplast-encoded genes trnE, rrn 23, rrn 16, rbcL, psbD, psbA and psaA directly after isolation and 4 hours post-isolation time were analyzed using dot blot hybridization. The ability of isolated chloroplasts to incorporate 35 S-methionine into de novo synthesized proteins at 0, 4 and 24 hours after isolation was tested by translational assays. The chloroplasts of Vaucheria litorea were both transcriptionally and translationally stable {{over an extended period of}} time. However, the culturing limitations and low plastid yields diminish the potential of this alga as a chloroplast donor for in organello assays. Chloroplasts of Pisum sativum, previously suspected to be more unstable, did not show a decline in transcription rate until 4 hours after isolation. The decrease in incorporation of 35 S-methionine between time 0 and 4 hours after isolation was only minor, between 4 and 24 hours more significant but the radioactive signal was still readily detectable at 24 hours. Pisum sativum has simple growth requirements and offers high yields of isolated chloroplasts. Chloroplasts from this plant should therefore be in the centre of further investigations into their suitability to express foreign genes and their potential for in organello assays...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MSc (Environmental Sciences)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} the algal genera found in the different freshwater bodies on Marion Island, to relate the presence or absence of the genera to the chemistry of the water bodies and to group the genera according to their limno-chemical preferences. The Island's freshwater algal genera were also compared with genera found on other Southern Ocean islands. The major factors influencing the chemical composition of the freshwaters of the island are the surrounding ocean and the manuring of seals and seabirds. The Western and Southern lakelets and wallows had higher mean conductivity values than most of the other water bodies. Eastern Inland lakelets, crater lakes and glacial lakes had low ion and nutrient concentrations, since they are mainly situated inland, away from bird or seal colonies. The chemical composition of wallows was influenced by manuring of seals and seabirds. The freshwaters are acidic and lakelets tend to be more acidic than glacial lakes. The lentic waters were more acidic than the stream. In total, 106 genera, mainly belonging to Chlorophyta (60 genera; 56 % of total) and Cyanophyta (29 genera; 27 % of total), were found in the freshwaters on the island. Other algal divisions found were Chrysophyta (7 genera), Euglenophyta (4 genera), Pyrrophyta (2 genera) and Xanthophyta (4 genera). Mean number of genera per sample ranged from 8 (in wallows) to 16 (in Eastern Inland lakelets). Filamentous algae were present in all the samples. Abundant green algae were Cosmarium, Klebsormidium, Mougeotia and Oedogonium. The most common cyanobacteria were Lyngbya and Chroococcus. The filamentous <b>yellow-green</b> <b>alga,</b> Tribonema, was also common. There were distinct differences in the algal composition between the southern, western and northern lakelets and the lakelets on the eastern side of the island. Sixty percent of the algal genera were present in waters with low conductivity values. Trichodesmium, Sphaerocystis and Tolypothrix occurred in freshwater bodies with higher conductivity values. Variance analysis showed that 87 of the 106 genera were less likely to occur in nitrogen and phosphate containing waters. Chlamydomonas, Prasiola, Spirogyra Trachelomonas, Tribonema, Ulothrix and Xanthidium were among the genera commonly found in nitrogen and phosphate containing waters. Diversity (number of genera per sample) was negatively correlated with conductivity, PO 4 -P, NH 4 -N and NO 3 -N. Diversity declined significantly with increasing salinity and eutrophication. Genera likely to occur in acidic waters include Binuclearia, Chlamydomonas, Chroococcus, Cosmarium, Klebsormidium, Microspora, Oedogonium, Oocystis, Prasiola, Scenedesmus, Staurastrum, Stigeoclonium, Tetrastrum, Ulothrix, Lyngbya, Synura and Tribonema. Marion Island’s algal flora shows a high affinity with that of Îles Kerguelen and Crozet, both located in the same biogeographical province (South Indian Ocean Province) of the sub-Antarctic than Marion Island, and a lesser affinity with islands in other sub-Antarctic provinces.

40|$|A {{number of}} karst springs {{rise in the}} Carboniferous strata of the Mells Valley, Somerset which is an area {{surrounded}} by many active and disused quarries. Some of these karst springs actively deposit tufa, a secondary precipitate of calcium carbonate, {{and they have been}} identified by the Environment Agency as potentially vulnerable to the effects of local sub-water table quarrying. A comparative study of a tufa-depositing spring, Whitehole Farm Spring, and a non tufa-depositing spring, St. Dunstan's Well, was carried out {{in order to determine the}} influence of hydrogeology, hydrogeochemistry and environmental biology on the processes of tufa deposition. The two springs are approximately 2 km apart and located within the same outcrop of Carboniferous Limestone strata. A series of qualitative dye-tracing tests established a positive hydraulic connection between a feeder stream which rose in the Old Red Sandstone of the upper hydrological catchment, a sinkhole at the junction with the Lower Limestone Shales and Whitehole Farm Spring resurgence in the Carboniferous Limestone. The sinkhole was shown to have two separate channels to the water table. The tests demonstrated that structural geology and the water table had definable effects on the subterranean route and travel time of the allogenic recharge water. The recharge water to Whitehole Farm Spring was guided by the SE - NW Downhead Fault and did not follow the SW - NE course of the natural dry valley. The water velocity was dependent on the height of the local water table at the time of the tests. Hydrograph analysis of flow data combined with the dye-tracing tests illustrated the rapid response of the springs to storm events (< 24 hrs). The results gave an indication of the shallow nature of the Carboniferous Limestone aquifer and the different stages of development of fissures and conduits in the two spring systems, St. Dunstan's Well being a more mature karst system than Whitehole Farm Spring. Analysis of 18 monthly water samples from both springs at their resurgences and 100 metres downstream revealed temporal and spatial differences in the hydrogeochemistry of the springs and their streams. Ca 2 + and HCOs' were the dominant ions in both spring waters, however, neither of the spring resurgences were supersaturated with respect to calcite (Whitehole Farm Spring, mean - 0. 17 ± 0. 08 Sic; St. Dunstan's Well, mean - 0. 33 ± 0. 08 Sic). The resurgence water at Whitehole Farm Spring was higher in Ca 2 + (mean 112 ± 3. 35 mg I" 1) than at St. Dunstan's Well and became supersaturated as it flowed downstream (mean 0. 43 ± 0. 10 Sic). Lower Ca 2 + levels at St. Dunstan's Well (80 ± 2. 7 mg I" 1) were influenced by the degassing of recharge water and the deposition of calcite as speleothem within the open system of caves behind the resurgence. Downstream supersaturation was also lower (- 0. 011 ± 0. 079 Sic). There was a highly significant difference (p < 0. 001) between mean daily flow at Whitehole Farm Spring (0. 95 ± 0. 19 ML d" 1) and St. Dunstan's Well (11. 58 ± 1. 93 ML d" 1). Electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids, alkalinity, Na, K, and NO 3 were also higher at Whitehole Farm Spring, the differences being significant (p < 0. 01). There were major differences in the biodiversity and environment of the two sites. Petrographic examination of field-collected tufa samples from Whitehole Farm Spring demonstrated that the stream flora, in particular lower plants, and the surrounding riparian vegetation were a major influence on the formation and morphology of the tufa deposits. Newly accreted tufa which had formed on artificial substrates placed in the stream, revealed calcite crystals surrounding the empty moulds of filamentous cyanobacteria. Hydrological conditions within the stream also influenced the micromorphology of calcite crystals forming on two filamentous algal species, Vaucheria longata and Zygnema stellinum. Whitehole Farm Spring was also found to be the more stable environment where biodiversity was higher. The shaded conditions created by Whitehole Farm Spring's woodland environment were beneficial to the growth of filamentous algae, cyanobacteria and bryophytes. The dominant species upstream was a crustose epilithic red alga Hildenbrandia rivularis. Downstream, in and on the tufa deposits the dominant aquatic flora were a number of species of the filamentous <b>yellow-green</b> <b>alga</b> Vaucheria and the cyanobacterium Lyngbya and the moss species Palustriella (Cratoneuron) commutatum. These species were either absent or growing under different ecological conditions at St. Dunstan's Well where there was sparse woodland. The dominant species at St. Dunstan's Well was the filamentous green alga Cladophora glomerata which was not present at Whitehole Farm Spring. Debris from the surrounding riparian vegetation at Whitehole Farm Spring acted as substrates for colonisation by microorganisms which enhanced the nucleation and growth of tufa in the stream. Hydrological and environmental conditions at St. Dunstan's Well prevented the accumulation of organic debris within the stream flow. The study highlighted the need for conservation of the natural environment and biota in order to maintain actively-depositing tufa springs...|$|R
40|$|Turgor {{regulation}} {{is the process}} by which walled organisms alter their internal osmotic potential to adapt to osmotic changes in the environment. Much of what we know regarding turgor regulation and osmotic adjustment in algae is limited to the green characean and chlorphytan algae. This thesis is an investigation of turgor regulation in two species of the <b>yellow-green</b> xanthophycean <b>alga,</b> Vaucheria. The first part of this study involved the collection and identification of species of Vaucheria from contrasting habitats in New Zealand. Seven species of Vaucheria were identified based on the morphology of their reproductive structures. Two were described as new species (V. aestuarii and V. edaphica) and two others were reported for the first time from New Zealand (V. erythrospora and V. litorea). The genetic variation and phylogenetic position of these species were studied using phylogenetic analyses of rbcL sequences. Two of the species from contrasting habitats were selected for a comparative study on turgor regulation. These were Vaucheria erythrospora, isolated from an estuarine habitat, and Vaucheria repens, isolated from a freshwater habitat. Using a single cell pressure probe to directly measure turgor after hyperosmotic shock, V. erythrospora was found to recover turgor after a larger shock than V. repens. Threshold shock values for this ability were > 0. 5 MPa for V. erythrospora and < 0. 5 MPa for V. repens. Recovery was more rapid in V. erythrospora than V. repens after comparable shocks. Growth studies showed that V. erythrospora was able to grow and maintain turgor over a wider range of NaCl concentrations. These responses are thought to underlie the ability of V. erythrospora to survive in an estuarine habitat and restrict V. repens to freshwater. xi The final part of this study investigated the mechanisms underlying turgor regulation in V. erythrospora. Different responses were observed depending on whether NaCl or sorbitol was used to elicit the shock. Membrane potential (Em) measurements showed a rapid depolarization of the plasma membrane in response to a NaCl-induced hyperosmotic shock, followed by a slower repolarization, and recovery almost back to the resting Em. MIFE recordings indicate a net K+ efflux, a response that has been reported in other systems. While recordings of Na+ fluxes were not possible due to the high external Na+, these may account for the depolarisation and recovery of turgor as turgor recovery was inhibited by the non-selective cation channels (NSCCs) inhibitor Gd 3 + and was dependant on the external Na+ concentration. An equivalent sorbitol-induced hyperosmotic shock hyperpolarized the Em, followed by depolarization and recovery back to the resting Em. Net flux recordings showed that both K+ and Na+ were taken up in response to a sorbitol shock when there was a low external Na+ concentration (1 mM). K+ was possibly taken up through inward rectifying K+ channels activated by membrane hyperpolarization. The ability of V. erythrospora to rapidly regulate turgor by taking up ions during hyperosmotic stress is the possible reason for its survival in an estuarine habitat...|$|R

50|$|Because of {{the shallow}} waters, the {{development}} of aquatic life in the Sea of Azov is more characteristic of a lagoon, and the plankton patterns are rather similar in the open sea and near the shores. Despite its shallowness, the water has low transparency, so bottom plants are poorly developed and most algae are of planktonic type. The sea is characterised by high concentrations of organic matter and long blooming periods. Another specific feature of the sea is the variable salinity - low in the large bays and higher in the open sea, especially near the Kerch Strait. Therefore, the plankton species are distributed inhomogeneously in the Sea of Azov. Although many additional species are brought in from the saltier Black Sea, most of them cannot adjust to the variable salinity of the Sea of Azov, except for the euryhaline species. About 600 species of planktonic algae are known in the Sea of Azov. The number of species is dominated by diatoms and green algae; blue-green algae and pyrophites are significant, and euglena and <b>yellow-green</b> <b>algae</b> form only 5% of the species.

30|$|Metazachlor is {{classified}} as H 400 and H 410 designating acute and chronic aquatic hazard. Algae and higher aquatic plants, possessing high and constant amounts of VLCFAs are the most prone organisms to damage. Mohr et al, for example, showed that single exposure of several aquatic macrophytes to metazachlor at nominal concentrations of > 5  µg/L, had pronounced long-term effects on the aquatic biota [14]. In this study, even after 140 – 170  days, the macrophytes did not recover from punctual metazachlor treatments. Applied metazachlor concentrations of 20  µg/L in pond- and stream mesocosms led to a decrease in macrophyte wet weight of 25 and 77 %, respectively. In the same study [14], it was shown that filamentous green algae dominated by Cladophora glomerata and Spirogyra spec. were also extremely sensitive to metazachlor with EC 50 values of 3 and 9  µg/L (median effective concentration) in stream- and pond indoor mesocosms, respectively. These algae were replaced by the filamentous <b>yellow–green</b> <b>algae</b> Vaucheria spec, but only at metazachlor concentrations higher than the ones observed in the lake of the Upper-Sûre (> 80  µg/L).

40|$|Algae are a {{large group}} of aquatic, {{typically}} photosynthetic, eukaryotes that include species from very diverse phylogenetic lineages, from those similar to land plants to those related to protist parasites. The recent sequencing of several algal genomes has provided insights into the great complexity of these organisms. Genomic information has also emphasized our lack of knowledge of the functions of many predicted genes, as well as the gene regulatory mechanisms in algae. Core components of the machinery for RNA-mediated silencing show widespread distribution among algal lineages, but they also seem to have been lost entirely from several species with relatively small nuclear genomes. Complex sets of endogenous small RNAs, including candidate microRNAs and small interfering RNAs, have now been identified by high-throughput sequencing in green, red, and brown algae. However, the natural roles of RNA-mediated silencing in algal biology remain poorly understood. Limited evidence suggests that small RNAs may function, in different algae, in defense mechanisms against transposon mobilization, in responses to nutrient deprivation and, possibly, in the regulation of recently evolved developmental processes. From a practical perspective, RNA interference (RNAi) is becoming a promising tool for assessing gene function by sequence-specific knockdown. Transient gene silencing, triggered with exogenously synthesized nucleic acids, and/or stable gene repression, involving genome-integrated transgenes, have been achieved in green algae, diatoms, <b>yellow-green</b> <b>algae,</b> and euglenoids. The development of RNAi technology in conjunction with system level “omics” approaches may provide the tools needed to advance our understanding of algal physiological and metabolic processes...|$|E
40|$|Photosynthesis {{in plants}} {{is a very}} {{complicated}} process, utilizing two photosystems in series {{to carry out the}} very energy-demanding process of oxidizing water to molecular oxygen and reducing carbon dioxide to organic compounds. The first photosynthetic organisms, living more than 3. 4, perhaps even 3. 8 Ga, i. e. American billion (109) years ago, carried out a simpler process, without oxygen production and with only one photosystem. A great variety of such one-photosystem photosynthesizers are living even today, and by comparing them, and from chemical fossils, researchers are trying to piece together a picture of the course of the earliest evolution of photosynthesis. Chlorophyll a probably preceded bacteriochlorophyll a as a main pigment for conversion of light into life energy. The process of carbon dioxide assimilation, today taking place mainly in conjunction with photosynthesis, is even older than photosynthesis itself. Oxygenic photosynthesis, i. e. photosynthetic production of molecular oxygen, first appeared in ancestors of present-day cyanobacteria more than 2. 7, perhaps already 3. 7 Ga ago. Cyanobacteria entered into close association with other organisms more than 1. 2 Ga ago, and chloroplasts in green algae and green plants as well as those in algae on the "red" line of evolution (red algae, cryptophytes, diatoms, brown algae, <b>yellow-green</b> <b>algae</b> and others) stem from a single early event of endosymbiotic uptake of a cyanobacterium into a heterotrophic organism. Only ecologically unimportant exceptions from this rule have been found. The chloroplasts on the "red line", excepting those of red algae, stem from a single event of secondary endosymbiosis, in which a red alga was taken up into another organism. There are also examples of tertiary (third level) endosymbiotic events. Thylakoids in land plants are partially appressed and forming grana, while those of, e. g., red algae do not have this structure, and this difference {{can be explained by the}} different spectra of ambient light. At the end of the chapter a brief review is given of the evolution of the assimilation of carbon dioxide, the adaptation to terrestrial life, and the impact of photosynthesis on the terrestrial environment...|$|E
