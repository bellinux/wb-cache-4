Called buffet flats, they offered alcohol, music, dancing, prostitutes, and, commonly, gambling, and, less often, rooms to which a couple could go. Their location in residential buildings, typically on cross streets above 140th Street, away from the nightclubs and speakeasies on the avenues, offered a degree of privacy from police, and from whites: <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> find a buffet flat if you knew the address and apartment number, which hosts did not advertise.|$|E

Beer was against the law. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> drink shit like pints of peach schnapps". It consists of a two-note piano figure and a banjo part, over which Smith played a tape recording he had made of the wind howling outside his bedroom window. According to guitarist Marc Riley, [...] "He [...] just said he needed a tune, something Dylanish, and we knocked around on the piano {{in the studio and}} came up with that. But we hadn't heard the words until he suddenly did them." [...] The line [...] "Fall down flat in the Cafe Iol without a glance from the clientele" [...] describes an incident that had happened to Smith that morning. He had tripped in a nearby cafe and fallen across several tables. He was surprised by the lack of response from the other customers, who seemed to have dismissed him as just another drunk.|$|E
500|$|Side Two {{opens with}} the young man's dying {{thoughts}} turning to his recent breakup with the unnamed lover ("Two Out of Three Ain't Bad"); the song was written quite late in the album's production, shortly before the album was released. The song documents the breakup of a relationship where {{despite the fact that}} the man wants and needs the woman, he will never love her; he tries to be positive and supportive, however, in emphasizing that wanting her and needing her are very positive things—i.e., [...] "ain't bad"—which gives the song an ironic twist. A further twist is that the reason the man will never love the woman is because he already loves another woman, who broke up with him because she already loved another man. Rundgren identifies how the song was influenced by the Eagles, who were successful at the time. The producer also highlights the [...] "underlying humor in the lyrics", citing the line [...] "There ain't no Coupe de Ville hiding at the bottom of a Cracker Jack box." [...] He says <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> [...] "get away" [...] with that lyric [...] "in a Meat Loaf song".|$|E

500|$|IGN {{gave the}} games a 9/10, a higher rating {{than any of}} the other Nintendo DS Pokémon games. The review praised the games for {{renewing}} interest in the series, though criticized some of the new Pokémon designs, explaining that [...] "aside from a weaker lineup of monsters (largely an aesthetic complaint), this is the best Pokémon has to offer on every level, renewing my waning interest in monster battling". Jeremy Parish of Retronauts criticized Black and White, commenting that he grew tired of it shortly after starting and feeling like it was too similar to all previous Pokémon games. He further went on to say that EVs and IVs, invisible mechanics in the game, are not necessarily beneficial. By contrast, he noted that it would be great to new players. He also compared it to the Pokémon Mystery Dungeon games and Final Fantasy XIII, arguing that they all share the common element of being bad before they get good. Fellow Retronauts contributor Justin Haywald criticized the games' release on the DS, which had received two main Pokémon series games published before them. GamesRadar editor Carolyn Gudmundson stated [...] "It may not break the Pokemon mold, but Black/White offers enough new content coupled with the series' classic, deep battle mechanics to make it endlessly playable. If <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> play one game for the rest of your life, this would be a wise choice." ...|$|E
500|$|Several collaborations between Rakoto Frah {{and other}} {{international}} artists have been recorded. Rakoto Frah is featured on tracks recorded with Manu Dibango, jazz artists David Lindley and Henry Keiser, Kassav', and Ladysmith Black Mambazo, whom he met while performing in India. As a musician who played by ear, he would join an ongoing performance by listening carefully to determine the key of the song. The American composer and jazz saxophonist Ornette Coleman described Rakoto Frah as having [...] "some of the best phrasing of any musician in the world". He was also cited as a key influence by Ian Anderson, the flutist and leader of 1970s British rock group Jethro Tull. In the liner notes for the 1991 compilation A World Out of Time, producers David Lindley and Henry Kaiser expressed their admiration for the artist, stating: [...] "He {{is one of the}} most amazing master musicians and individuals that we have ever met. His mastery of the sodina is on a level that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> compare to great, western instrumental masters like John Coltrane, Ornette Coleman, Billy Pigg or Miles Davis. Rakoto Frah certainly seems to know mysterious things about the phrasing of melodies that nobody else knows." [...] Contemporary Malagasy artists performing in diverse genres ranging from heavy metal and hip hop to jazz and the traditional mangaliba have cited the sodina master as an inspiration and legend in the pantheon of Malagasy cultural figures.|$|E
2500|$|Teaming with {{producer}} Jack Joseph Puig, Tonic released {{their debut}} album Lemon Parade on July 15, 1996. Music critic Shawn M. Haney {{said of the}} album that, [...] "The record {{as a whole is}} full of the heavy, distortion-laden Tonic sound, and guitars that make them who they are." [...] Singles for the songs [...] "Open Up Your Eyes" [...] and [...] "If <b>You</b> <b>Could</b> <b>Only</b> See", were released in 1996 and 1997 respectively. The single [...] "If <b>You</b> <b>Could</b> <b>Only</b> See" [...] received the honor of being Rock Radio's most played song of 1997, and Lemon Parade as an album reached platinum status. Music videos were created for the songs [...] "Open Up Your Eyes," [...] "If <b>You</b> <b>Could</b> <b>Only</b> See," [...] and [...] "Soldier's Daughter." [...] The Lemon Parade album spent 57 weeks on the Billboard 200 chart, reaching a peak of No.28 during the week of August 2, 1997. By February 2003 Lemon Parades running total of albums sold had reached 1.3 million copies.|$|E

2500|$|Tonic is an American {{rock band}} that has earned two Grammy nominations. The band {{was formed in}} 1993 by Emerson Hart and Jeff Russo.

The single [...] "If <b>You</b> <b>Could</b> <b>Only</b> See" [...] reached No.11 on the Billboard Airplay Hot 100, and Lemon Parade itself reached platinum status.|$|E
2500|$|Officially active again, Tonic {{had already}} played their first show {{together}} {{in many years}} on September 16, 2008 at a venue in Antioch, Illinois. As part of the band's 2009 tour, a greatest hits compilation titled A Casual Affair:The Best of Tonic was released. The album featured live versions of the songs [...] "Irish" [...] and [...] "Sugar" [...] {{in addition to an}} acoustic version of [...] "You Wanted More." [...] November 2009 marked the band's inclusion in the video game Band Hero, as the track [...] "If <b>You</b> <b>Could</b> <b>Only</b> See" [...] was a playable song in the game.|$|E
2500|$|In 1935, at age 34, Arthur starred {{opposite}} Edward G. Robinson in {{the gangster}} farce The Whole Town's Talking, also directed by Ford, and her popularity began to rise. It {{was the first}} time Arthur portrayed a hard-boiled working girl with a heart of gold, the type of role she would be associated with {{for the rest of her}} career. She enjoyed the acting experience and working opposite Robinson, who remarked in his biography that it was a [...] "delight to work with and know" [...] Arthur. By the time of the film's release, her hair, naturally brunette throughout the silent film portion of her career, was bleached blonde and would mostly stay that way. She was known for maneuvering to be photographed and filmed almost exclusively from the left; Arthur felt that her left was her best side, and worked hard to keep it in the fore. Director Frank Capra recalled producer Harry Cohn's description of Jean Arthur's imbalanced profile: [...] "half of it's angel, and the other half horse." [...] Her next few films, Party Wire (1935), Public Hero No. 1 (1935) and If <b>You</b> <b>Could</b> <b>Only</b> Cook (1935), did not match the success of The Whole Town's Talking, but they all brought the actress positive reviews. In his review for The New York Times, critic Andre Sennwald praised Arthur's performance in Public Hero No. 1, writing that she [...] "is as refreshing a change from the routine it-girl as Joseph Calleia is in his own department." [...] Another critic wrote of her performance in If <b>You</b> <b>Could</b> <b>Only</b> Cook that [...] " [...] outstanding as she effortlessly slips from charming comedienne to beautiful romantic." [...] With her now apparent rise to fame, Arthur was able to extract several contractual concessions from Harry Cohn, such as script and director approval and the right to make films for other studios.|$|E

2500|$|Harding {{is first}} {{recorded}} in May 1751 {{when he played}} for All-England v Kent at the Artillery Ground. [...] All-England won by 9 runs and Harding made a significant contribution. [...] Although he had been picked as a bowler, he and [...] "A N Other" [...] (an unnamed Chertsey player) opened All-England's second innings and scored 51 for the first wicket, which is like a double century partnership nowadays. [...] Harding apparently made 50 of these himself and had one hit {{out of the ground}} and against a house on Bunhill Row opposite. [...] He was given four for this mighty effort. [...] <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> score six if you were actually able to run that many and to do that you would need the help of overthrows.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Late Night host David Letterman was {{preparing}} to leave, prompting executive producer Lorne Michaels {{to search for a}} new host. Michaels approached O'Brien to produce; then-agent Gavin Polone stressed that O'Brien wanted to perform, rather than produce. He arranged with Michaels that O'Brien would do a test audition on the stage of The Tonight Show. Jason Alexander and Mimi Rogers were the guests, and the audience was composed of Simpsons writers. Wolodarksky recalled the experience: [...] "Seeing this friend of yours, this guy that you worked with, walk out from behind that curtain and deliver a monologue was like something <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> dream up that you couldn’t ever imagine actually happening." [...] The performance was beamed by satellite to New York, where Lorne Michaels and NBC executives watched. O'Brien was picked as the new host of Late Night on April 26, 1993. As the writers headed to the voice record for [...] "Homer Goes to College", O'Brien {{received a phone call from}} Polone informing him of the decision. [...] "He was passed out facedown into this horrible shag carpet. He was just quiet and comatose down there on that carpet," [...] recalled postproduction supervisor Michael Mendel. [...] "I remember looking at him and saying, 'Wow. Your life is about to change, in a really dramatic way.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Dan Lavery {{replaced}} Rothchild on bass in December 1996, {{and around}} this {{same time period}} drummer Shepard ceased full-time activity with the band for family and personal reasons. The year 1997 marked the band's first contribution to an original soundtrack, recording the song [...] "Eyes of Sand" [...] for the Scream 2 soundtrack. Continuing their work on film soundtracks into 1998, Tonic recorded the song [...] "Flower Man" [...] for , and performed a cover of the song Everybody's Talkin' for the Clay Pigeons soundtrack. Tonic also performed a cover of the song [...] "Second Hand News" [...] for the album [...] "Legacy: A Tribute to Fleetwood Mac's Rumours." [...] The band finished 1998 by contributing a live version of the song [...] "Open Up Your Eyes" [...] to the charitable album Live in the X Lounge. On March 1, 1999 the band released the now out-of-print Live and Enhanced CD, which featured an acoustic version of [...] "If <b>You</b> <b>Could</b> <b>Only</b> See" [...] and the previously unreleased music video of [...] "Soldier's Daughter". In 2000, Tonic allowed their song [...] "Mean To Me" [...] from their album Sugar to be released as a single from the soundtrack album for the Warner Bros. film Gossip, which was directed by Academy Award-winning director Davis Guggenheim. The band appeared in the music video for the song, which featured clips from the film as well as actors from it, who seemingly appear to be interacting with the band via webcam as they perform the song.|$|E
