500|$|A {{charter of}} 831, which Wiglaf calls [...] "the first <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> second reign", was issued at Wychbold near Droitwich; it is {{significant}} that Wiglaf makes no reference to any overlordship of Egbert's in this charter, issued within a year of his recovery of power, and that he acknowledges his temporary deposition. In East Anglia, King Æthelstan minted coins, possibly as early as 827, but more likely c. 830 after Egbert's influence was reduced with Wiglaf's return to power in Mercia. [...] This demonstration of independence on East Anglia's part is not surprising, as it was probably Æthelstan who was responsible for the defeat and death of both Beornwulf and Ludeca.|$|E
500|$|Later in 2010 when {{recording}} {{her third}} album, Here I Am (2011), Rowland credited both Guetta {{and the song}} for inspiring her to pursue a new sound.

'When Love Takes Over' it was my first introduction to dance music [...] it was a whole other monster. It's really a culture and I love it." [...] In 2010, following the success of [...] "When Love Takes Over" [...] and the duo's musical chemistry, Guetta was asked to work on Rowland's third studio album. He co-produced a couple of the songs including the album's first single, [...] "Commander".|$|E

500|$|Among the {{accessories}} shown, {{the wings}} worn {{in the video}} were made by Jim Henson Studios and her own creative team, Haus of Gaga, created the arrows. Gaga told Access Hollywood about the shoot at Hearst Castle and the main idea behind the video: [...] "It was a great experience writing the treatment working with everyone and I was like, 'Don't touch anything, and if you knock over a sculpture I'm going to pass out!'. The intention of the video was to create something that was a true sort of road map of my journey, being an artist, a pop singer, a creative person..... It's interesting because in this video the fashion and the psychotic sort of whimsy is all happening around me and it's me almost like Alice in Wonderland going through my own rabbit hole in my brain and re-experiencing the past <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> life.

500|$|The Arcadia Conference, {{which was}} held in Washington, D.C., December 1941 and January 1942, {{mandated}} {{the creation of the}} Joint Chiefs of Staff as a counterpart to the British Chiefs of Staff Committee, and Smith was named as its secretary on 23 January 1942. The same conference also brought about the creation of the Combined Chiefs of Staff, which consisted of the (American) Joint Chiefs of Staff and the (British) Chiefs of Staff Committee meeting as a single body. Brigadier Vivian Dykes of the British Joint Staff Mission provided the secretarial arrangements for the new organization at first, but General Marshall thought that an American secretariat was required. He appointed Smith as the secretary of the Combined Chiefs of Staff {{as well as of the}} Joint Chiefs of Staff. Since Dykes was senior in service time to Smith, and Marshall wanted Smith to be in charge, Smith was promoted to brigadier general on 2 February 1942. He assumed the new post a week later, with Dykes as his deputy. The two men worked in partnership to create and organize the secretariat, and to build the organization of the [...] Combined Chiefs-of-Staff into one that could coordinate the war efforts of the two allies, along with the Canadians, Australians, French and others. Smith's duties involved taking part in discussions of strategy at the highest level, and he often briefed President Roosevelt on strategic matters. However Smith became frustrated as he watched other officers receive operational commands that he desired. He later remarked: [...] "That year I spent working as secretary of the general staff for George Marshall was one of the most rewarding of my entire career, and the unhappiest <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> life." ...|$|E

2500|$|Thanks {{largely to}} the {{research}} of John Harley, knowledge of Byrd's biography has expanded in recent years. According to Harley, Thomas Byrd, the grandson of Richard Byrd of Ingatestone, Essex, probably moved to London in the 15th century. Thereafter succeeding generations of the family are described as gentlemen. William Byrd was born in London, the son of another Thomas Byrd about whom nothing further is known, and his wife, Margery. The specific year of Byrd's birth is uncertain. In his will, dated 15 November 1622, he describes himself as [...] "in the 80th <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> age", suggesting a birthdate of 1542 or 1543. [...] However a document dated 2 October 1598 written in his own hand states that he is [...] "58 yeares or ther abouts", indicating an earlier birthdate of 1539 or 1540. [...] Byrd had two brothers, Symond and John, who became London merchants, and four sisters, Alice, Barbara, Mary, and Martha.|$|E
2500|$|At the 1976 US Open, Evert faced {{off against}} Goolagong {{again for the}} second-time in a slam final in 1976. The match was {{basically}} a systematic trouncing by Evert against Goolagong, {{the only thing in}} question was a suspect line call that went in Evert's favor, but being a good sport Evert asked the umpire to reassess the call and gave it to her opponent. From two games to three advantage Goolagong in the first set, Evert took the next ten games off her opponent and took the title and championship. Goolagong could not give any competition to Evert in the final, which she lost {{for the second year in}} a row to Evert, which made Evert's record against her 18 to 11. She would lose only 12 games at this US Open on her way to the title. It is the least amount of games lost by a Grand Slam Champion. Evert would say after this win, which was her second slam title of the year that [...] "this has to be the best <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> life." ...|$|E
2500|$|British author Nicholas Hagger {{writes that}} after seizing control of Libya, Muammar Gaddafi [...] "declared" [...] on 1 December 1978 [...] "that the Muslim {{calendar}} should {{start with the}} death of the prophet Mohammed in 632 rather than the hijra (Mohammed's 'emigration' from Mecca to Medina) in 622". This put the country ten solar years behind the standard Muslim calendar. However, according to the 2006 Encyclopedia of the Developing World, [...] "More confusing still is Qaddafi's unique Libyan calendar, which counts the years from the Prophet's birth, or sometimes from his death. The months July and August, named after Julius and Augustus Caesar, are now Nasser and Hannibal respectively." [...] Reflecting on a 2001 visit to the country, American reporter Neil MacFarquhar observed, [...] "Life in Libya was so unpredictable that people weren't even sure what year it was. The <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> visit was officially 1369. But just two years earlier Libyans had been living through 1429. No one could quite name for me the day the count changed, especially since both remained in play.... Event organizers threw up their hands and put the Western year in parentheses somewhere in their announcements." ...|$|E

2500|$|Carl Frederick Buechner, {{the eldest}} son of Katherine Kuhn and Carl Frederick Buechner Sr., was born on July 11, 1926 in New York City. During Buechner's early {{childhood}} the family moved frequently, as Buechner's father searched for work. In The Sacred Journey Buechner recalls: [...] "Virtually every <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> life until I was fourteen, I lived in a different place, had different people {{to take care of}} me, went to a different school. The only house that remained constant was the one where my maternal grandparents lived in a suburb of Pittsburgh called East Liberty...Apart from that one house on Woodland Road, home was not a place to me when I was a child. It was people." [...] This changed in 1936, when Buechner's father committed suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning, a result of his conviction that he had been a failure. Immediately afterwards, the family moved to Bermuda, where they remained until World War II forced the evacuation of Americans from the island. [...] In Bermuda, Buechner experienced [...] "the blessed relief of coming out of the dark and unmentionable sadness of my father's life and death into fragrance and greenness and light." ...|$|E

She said: [...] "I’m not prepared to be 70 and absolutely broke. I realised last year that I have no safety net at all and I’m {{going to have to}} get one. So I need to change my attitude to life, which means I have to put away 10 per cent every <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> old age. I want to be in a position where I don’t have to work. I should have thought about this a long time ago but I didn’t." [...] However, she still lived in her flat in Paris (located in one of the most expensive streets of the capital) and had a house in County Waterford, Ireland.

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with The Independent, Rowland admitted that with her first two records she struggled to find her sound. [...] "I was in a stage with the first two records where I was searching and I was like, let me try a rock-dance approach, the label [...] wanted me to try it and I did it... And then after that came a more urban approach with Ms. Kelly in 2007." [...] She further described the songs on her previous albums as sounding very much the same, which {{led her to the}} realisation that she [...] "needed refreshing". She told Entertainment Focus that meeting French DJ David Guetta [...] "changed her perspective and helped to inspire the new sound". She then spent more time in Europe in 2009, something which she said had influenced her. [...] "It's different being over here in Europe and just being able to look at different magazines and fashion shows and things like that. And just thinking about the look and working with different stylists as well. I wanted {{to make sure it was}} a look that was all me, you know?."
