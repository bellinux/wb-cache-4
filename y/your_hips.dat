5|$|I never agreed, {{even as a}} young person, {{with the}} Thomas Wolfe title You Can't Go Home Again. Instinctively I didn’t. But the truth is, you can never leave home. You take it with you; it’s under your fingernails; it’s in the hair follicles; it’s {{in the way you}} smile; it’s in the ride of <b>your</b> <b>hips,</b> in the passage of your breasts; it’s all there, no matter where you go. You can take on the affectations and the postures of other places and even learn to speak their ways. But the truth is, home is between your teeth.|$|E

25|$|An {{extended}} abdominoplasty is {{a complete}} abdominoplasty plus a lateral thigh lift. The resulting scar runs from the posterior axillary line (when placing your open hands on <b>your</b> <b>hips,</b> the thumbs lie along the posterior axillary line.) The operation does all of the abdominal contouring of a complete abdominoplasty and allows further improvement of the flank (waist), as well as smoothing the contour of the upper lateral thigh.|$|E

5000|$|Swivels: Swivels {{are similar}} to Lollies, but are {{executed}} at twice the rate. Lollies is tap-and-kick-and-tap-and-kick-and, swivels is swivel-swivel-down-hold-swivel-swivel-kick-step. The key to swivels is using <b>your</b> <b>hip</b> rotation to drive the move.|$|R
25|$|The Bigfoot {{researchers}} {{say that no}} human can walk that way in the film. Oh, yes they can! When you're wearing long clown's feet, you can't place the ball of your foot down first. You have to put your foot down flat. Otherwise, you'll stumble. Another thing, when {{you put on the}} gorilla head, you can only turn your head maybe a quarter of the way. And to look behind you, you've got to turn your head and your shoulders and <b>your</b> <b>hips.</b> Plus, the shoulder pads in the suit are {{in the way of the}} jaw. That's why the Bigfoot turns and looks the way he does in the film. He has to twist his entire upper body.|$|E
500|$|Young's full frontal on the rings, shown during Bounty Killer's line [...] "The way you rock <b>your</b> <b>hips,</b> {{you know}} that it amaze me," [...] was controversial.

[...] Bounty Killer {{cancelled}} his performances with No Doubt because of the incident, stating that [...] "they did not understand because they are from America and they accept gay people … If Jamaica is upset, I ain't going to accept no success that my culture is not proud of." ...|$|E
500|$|Uncuts and The Guardians reviews {{were less}} enthusiastic. Uncut {{commented that the}} album sounds dry and superficial, and the songs are too similar {{to each other and}} other Franz Ferdinand songs. The Guardian stated that [...] "if Franz's songwriting is broader than it was, it is still no deeper" [...] and that [...] "they'll keep trying to move <b>your</b> <b>hips</b> because they know they'll never win your heart." [...] This was echoed by the review in the Daily Mail, which {{described}} the album as [...] "a sterile, unwelcoming affair that fails to pack the band's usual punch." [...] Paste was similarly severe, stating that the vocals are [...] "leering", the production [...] "horrific", and that the lyrics [...] "seem to lack both heart and brain" [...] and conclude by writing that [...] "the layoff suggests that Franz is either too confused or too lazy to move forward".|$|E

2500|$|... "As {{you begin}} the backswing, you must {{restrain}} <b>your</b> <b>hips</b> from moving until the turning of the shoulders starts {{to pull the}} hips around…It is this increased tension that unwinds {{the upper part of}} the body. [...] It unwinds the shoulder, the arms and the hands in that order, the correct order. [...] It helps the swing so much it makes it almost automatic." ...|$|E
2500|$|Harlem's {{got a new}} rhythm, man it's {{burning up}} the dance floors because it's so hot! They took a little rhumba rhythm and added boogie woogie and now look what they got!

2500|$|Their Top of the Pops dancing {{style was}} {{critically}} {{described by a}} later performer as [...] "very typical of the 1960s: hands on <b>your</b> <b>hips,</b> wiggle from side to side, wave your {{arms in the air}} and shake your head madly till it almost comes off", though Cook herself said of working on the Doonican show (of which she was dance director) comparing to Top of the Pops, [...] "Pop steps are limited...With Val we have more scope, and we can work to get more of the feel of ballet into our numbers." ...|$|E
5000|$|The dance {{position}} for nightclub two step {{is with a}} more relaxed hold, or [...] "what people tend to do without lessons". The lead rocks back on their left foot, the follow on their right, for one beat. [...] "The toe is to the heel, but not further. Don't twist <b>your</b> <b>hip.</b> If <b>your</b> <b>hip</b> opens up, you have gone too far." [...] A gentle but noticeable resistance is maintained during the rock step. Then both partners replace weight on {{the second part of}} the first beat. On the next beat, the lead takes a step to the left and the follow to the right. Then both partners repeat, but on opposite feet (the lead rocks back on their right foot and moves to the right).|$|R

[...] "Except {{on a very}} long journey, when he has got squaws and baggage with him, a red-skin never goes at a walk, and the horses will keep on at this lope for hours. That is right. Don't sit so stiffly; you want your legs to be stiff and keeping a steady grip, but from <b>your</b> <b>hips</b> {{you want to be}} as slack as possible, just giving to the horse's action, the same way you give on board ship when vessels are rolling.

Your feet must be a little higher than your head; you really sleep down hill, which breaks the wind. So you never catch cold. All you need do is to change your position according to {{the direction of the}} wind. Pull up the blankets, and then the long end of the tarpaulin. If it rains or snows cover your head, and sleep, my lad, sleep to the song of the wind!" ...|$|E
