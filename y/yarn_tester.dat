40|$|This paper {{presents}} the main characteristics and functionalities {{of a system}} based on image processing techniques applied to quality assessment of yarns. In Textile Industry we used image processing to determine yarn mass parameters as well as yarn production characteristics. A low cost solution based on a web-pc camera plus the optics of a low cost analogue microscope and a software tool based on IMAQ Vision from LabVIEW was designed. Several tests were performed and compared with other methodologies of yarn parameterization validating the proposed solution. With the results one can support {{that this can be}} an alternative solution to the traditional <b>yarn</b> <b>testers,</b> with several advantages (among others, low cost, weight, volume, easy maintenance and reduced hardware). Moreover, this yarn parameterization can be used to assess the quality of the fabrics resultant...|$|R

The instrument is a single <b>yarn</b> strength <b>tester</b> and operates at a constant rate of extension. Following BS EN ISO 2062 : 1995, with a sample length of 50  cm, the cross head moving speed has been adjusted to give a yarn failure time of 20 [*]±[*] 3  seconds. Twenty tests {{have been carried out}} for each package and the average strength, tenacity and elongation results have been obtained from five packages where possible.|$|R

40|$|In {{their effort}} to measure yarn {{hairiness}} at high speed, the commercially available <b>yarn</b> hairiness <b>testers</b> resort to indirect techniques. Measurement of true length of all hairs can only be done by observing the yarn under a microscope and obtaining a trace of hairs. An attempt was made in this work to automate this task using digital image processing. The challenges were two-fold. The first was development of an algorithm capable of analysing yarn images taken under varying lighting conditions and varying yarn positions. The second was determination of minimum requirement of the image-capturing instrument. Both of these {{have been reported in}} this work. A new hairiness index has been proposed and suggested as a better indicator of hairiness than the traditional definition...|$|R

Travellers of 8 different weights and 4 different coatings were used working with two spindle speeds of 7000 rpm and 10, 000 rpm. Yarn hairiness was evaluated {{with the use of a}} Shirley <b>Yarn</b> Hairiness <b>Tester.</b> The values of tension, break-age rate, count, twist, evenness, elongation and tensile strength of the yarn produced were measured. In addition the yarns were knitted into fabrics to observe and evaluate pilling. Some conclusions were drawn considering yarn hairiness...|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] Traveller has a {{great impact}} on yarn quality {{parameters}} specially hairiness. Yarn quality varies due to different traveller number. The traveller imparts twist to the yarn and enables winding of the yarn on the cop. However, cooperating assembly, the spindle is required for the winding operation. High contact pressure (up to 35 N/mm 2) is generated between the ring and traveller during winding, mainly due to centrifugal force. This research was established according to yarn parameter of hairiness, U%, IPI, i. e. imperfection index and end breakage rate per 1000 spindle-hr. It is very important for the technologist to understand this and act on them to optimize the yarn production. Specific number of traveller should be used for a particular count of yarn.

40|$|Abstract. Effect of {{different}} gauge of pin carding plate and saw-tooth carding plate respectively installed under the licker-in of carding machine on polyester yarn hairiness was studied. The hairiness of polyester yarns {{produced in the}} condition of installing pin carding plate and saw-tooth carding plate under the licker-in at four different gauges were tested by YG 172 <b>yarn</b> hairiness <b>tester.</b> The {{results show that the}} two kinds of carding plate at the gauge of 0. 7 mm are most beneficial to reducing the number of polyester yarn hairiness. When the pin carding plate gauge is 1. 0 mm and the saw-tooth carding plate gauge is 0. 3 mm, the number of polyester yarn hairiness is the most. As a whole, installing saw-tooth carding plate under the licker-in is more favorable for reducing the number of polyester yarn hairiness...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} avoid the {{inherent}} photo-catalysis and aggregation of TiO 2 in PPS, TiO 2 nanoparticles were coated with SiO 2 layers, which were chosen as the UV absorbent to improve the UV stability of polyphenylene sulfide (PPS) fiber. The PPS–TiO 2 @SiO 2 nanocomposites fibers were prepared via melt spinning, and the nanocomposites fibers displayed different crystallization behaviors on variation of the diameters of TiO 2 @SiO 2 nanoparticles, as confirmed by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). The spinnability, breaking strength and UV-resistance properties of PPS nanocomposites fibers, as measured by homemade melt spinning machine, Xenon-lamp Weather Resistance Test Chamber and <b>Yarn</b> Tensile <b>Tester,</b> manifested the dependence on the diameters. The addition of nanoparticles with the diameter of 25 nm improved the spinnability and the mechanical performance of PPS most, which is attributed to the heterogeneous nucleation effect of nanoparticles. The UV-resistance properties of the PPS nanocomposites were improved by the addition of TiO 2 @SiO 2 nanoparticles. After aging for 180 h, PPS nanocomposites fiber still maintained a high strength...|$|R

According to the standard, the sample breaking time of 20  ±  3  s was achieved at the extension rate of 100  mm/min on the CRE type machine. The load cell used had the maximum loading capacity of 500  N, which is recommended for yarn testing according to the standard. The recommended type of yarn clamping jaws with the gauge setting of 250  mm was used. The yarns were tested and compared to their basic {{tensile properties}}, which includes tensile strength, elongation and initial modulus.|$|R
40|$|The {{audio signals}} of {{polyester}} filament and ring-spun yarn were collected respectively during tensile failure by self-built Acoustic Emission detection system (AE for short), {{which is based}} on the conventional <b>yarn</b> tensile strength <b>tester.</b> And then the Hilbert Huang transform (HHT) program was compiled by Matlab software to analysis and process the collected signals, {{in order to get the}} time-frequency characteristics of each damage source in the yarn tensile fracture process. The results show that, AE signal via HHT can be identified two modes involved in polyester ring-spun yarn tensile fracture process, which are fiber fracture and fiber slippage. And the characteristic frequencies of the modes are 30, 20 kHz and 6, 3 kHz respectively. Thus, this paper provides an effective new approach for the analysis and further research of yarn tensile fracture mechanism...|$|R
