25|$|Standard proverbs are {{essentially}} defined phrases, well-known to many people, as e. g. Don't bite {{the hand that}} feeds <b>you.</b> <b>When</b> this sequence slightly changed ("Don't bite the hand that looks dirty") it becomes an anti-proverb.

25|$|One notable {{consequence}} {{of the decline in}} use of the second person singular pronouns thou, thy, and thee is the obfuscation of certain sociocultural elements of Early Modern English texts, such as many character interactions in Shakespeare's plays, which were mostly written from 1589 to 1613. Although Shakespeare is far from consistent in his writings, his characters primarily tend to use thou (rather than <b>you)</b> <b>when</b> addressing another who is a social subordinate, a close friend, or a hated wrongdoer.|$|E

[...] "Breathing" [...] {{is written in}} the key of B♭ minor and is set in common time with a tempo of 120 beats per minute. Derulo's vocal range spans from the note of F4 to the note of F6. The song features [...] "tribal vocal chorales" [...] in the background, and samples the song [...] "Pilentze Pee", which is sung by the Bulgarian State Television Female Vocal Choir. The song contains lyrical content about winning back a past love. [...] "Breathing" [...] opens with a [...] "slow build-up of synths and a quick club beat" [...] before Derulo sings: [...] "I only miss <b>you</b> <b>when</b> I'm breathing / I only miss <b>you</b> <b>when</b> my heart is beating / You are the color that I'm bleeding / I only miss <b>you</b> <b>when</b> I'm breathing." [...] Scott Shetler of PopCrush noted that {{he appears to be}} screaming the vocals during the chorus line: [...] "I only miss <b>you</b> <b>when</b> I'm breathing", writing that [...] "his final note [...] stretched out for several seconds".|$|E

500|$|The episode {{continued}} Lynette's cancer storyline, which Cherry {{intended to}} be both emotional and comical. He notes, [...] "we established from very early on that she's suffering from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, so we never once let the audience think she's going to die. It's more about examining how {{your friends and family}} react to <b>you</b> <b>when</b> you're sick." [...] "We don't want to do some ridiculous she-might-die thing.

500|$|Harrison's musical biographer, Simon Leng, {{considers}} {{it to be}} an [...] "emotionally complex lyric that ponders how love will even survive, 'when every soul is free'". Christian theologian Dale Allison interprets {{the subject matter of the}} song as moksha, or liberation from rebirth, in the Hindu faith. He writes: [...] "'I'll Still Love <b>You</b> (<b>When</b> Every Song Is Sung)' looks forward to the time when all souls are 'free,' when all eyes will 'see,' and when all human beings will be of the same mind. 'All Things Must Pass,' but no one really ever passes away." ...|$|E

500|$|The generally-accepted {{explanation}} of the state's name {{is that it is}} derived from the Sarawak Malay word serawak, which means antimony.

James Brooke later became the first of the White Rajah dynasty to govern Sarawak. However, the latter explanation is incorrect: the territory had been named Sarawak before the arrival of James Brooke, and the word awak was not in the vocabulary of Sarawak Malay before the formation of Malaysia.|$|E
500|$|The lyrical {{process was}} a {{collaborative}} effort consisting of Vinnie, Darrell, and Lachman. Themes explored on the album included the brothers' experiences, Darrell commented, [...] "the crumbling of one empire and then starting over... So {{there are a lot}} of lyrics about being reborn in a sense, about it being a new day, moving forward, letting go of the past and becoming something new." [...] This is exemplified in the songs [...] "Reborn", [...] "Wake up", and [...] "Breathing New Life". [...] "Blunt Force Trauma" [...] is about when someone or something comes up behind <b>you</b> <b>when</b> you least expect it, [...] "it could be a situation in your life, it could be a person you know with a beer bottle".|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, it {{discusses}} American {{culture and}} greed, focusing on Hollywood {{as a place}} of pop stars and illusory dreams. The bridge opens with Madonna saying, [...] "Music stations always play the same songs/I'm bored with the concept of right and wrong". Contemporary author Ben Shapiro noted the verse [...] "seems to be Madonna's credo. Her purposeful degradation of morality has led to monumental success for her-and created a monumentally bad influence for her teenage fans." [...] Further, Madonna questions the Hollywood experience, singing, [...] "How could it hurt <b>you</b> <b>when</b> it looked so good?". Alexis Petridis of The Guardian noted Madonna's vocals in the song are [...] "high-pitched [...] little-girl", with the intention of [...] " [...] the notion of innocence lost".|$|E
