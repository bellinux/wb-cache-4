5000|$|First Developer: All exposed {{silver halide}} {{crystals}} are developed to metallic silver via a PQ developer. The <b>yellow</b> <b>filter</b> <b>layer</b> becomes opaque {{because it has}} a combination of Lippmann emulsion (very tiny grains) and Carey Lea silver (metallic silver particles that are small enough that they are yellow rather than gray.) ...|$|E
5000|$|Louis Ducos du Hauron had {{suggested}} using a sandwich of three differently color-recording emulsions on transparent supports {{which could be}} exposed together in an ordinary camera, then taken apart and used like any other set of three-color separations. The problem was that although two of the emulsions could be in contact face-to-face, the third {{would have to be}} separated by the thickness of one transparent support layer. Because all silver halide emulsions are inherently sensitive to blue, the blue-recording layer ought to be on top and have a blue-blocking <b>yellow</b> <b>filter</b> <b>layer</b> behind it. This blue-recording layer, used to make the yellow print which could most afford to be [...] "soft," [...] would end up producing the sharpest image. The two layers behind it, one sensitized to red but not green and the other to green but not red, would suffer from scattering of the light as it passed through the topmost emulsion, and one or both would further suffer by being spaced away from it.|$|E
50|$|Color {{films have}} {{multiple}} layers of silver halide emulsion to separately record the red, green and blue thirds of the spectrum. For every silver halide grain there is a matching color coupler grain (except Kodachrome film, to which color couplers were added during processing). The top layer of emulsion is sensitive to blue; below it is a <b>yellow</b> <b>filter</b> <b>layer</b> to block blue light; and under that is a green-sensitive layer followed by a red-sensitive layer. Just as in black-and-white, {{the first step in}} color development converts exposed silver halide grains into metallic silver - except that an equal amount of color dye will be formed as well. The color couplers in the blue-sensitive layer will form yellow dye during processing, the green layer will form magenta dye and the red layer will form cyan dye. A bleach step will convert the metallic silver back into silver halide, which is then removed along with the unexposed silver halide in the fixer and wash steps, leaving only color dyes.|$|E
5000|$|Blue light re-exposure {{from the}} top: This makes the {{remaining}} undeveloped grains {{in the blue}} sensitive layer (the yellow layer) developable. The now opaque <b>yellow</b> <b>filter</b> <b>layers</b> prevents the blue light from exposing the magenta layer (the green sensitive layer, which is also sensitive to blue light). It is important to avoid stray printing light exposing the film base of film.|$|R
50|$|C-41 film {{consists}} of an acetate or polyester film base, onto which multiple emulsions are coated. Each layer is only sensitive to a certain color of visible light. In the classic illustrative example, there are three emulsions: one is red sensitive, another is green sensitive, and the top is blue-sensitive. Beneath the blue <b>layer</b> is a <b>yellow</b> <b>filter,</b> composed of dyes or colloidal silver. All silver-based photographic emulsions have some sensitivity to blue light, regardless of what other colors they may be sensitized for. This <b>filter</b> <b>layer</b> serves to remove the blue light, which would expose the layers beneath it. Beneath the blue-sensitive <b>layer</b> and the <b>yellow</b> <b>filter</b> are the green and red sensitive layers.|$|R

50|$|In {{black-and-white}} {{photographic film}} {{there is usually}} one layer of silver halide crystals. When the exposed silver halide grains are developed, the silver halide crystals are converted to metallic silver, which blocks light and appears as the black part of the film negative. Color film has at least three sensitive layers, incorporating different combinations of sensitizing dyes. Typically the blue-sensitive layer is on top, followed by a <b>yellow</b> <b>filter</b> <b>layer</b> to stop any remaining blue light from affecting the layers below. Next come a green-and-blue sensitive layer, and a red-and-blue sensitive layer, which record the green and red images respectively. During development, the exposed silver halide crystals are converted to metallic silver, just as with black-and-white film. But in a color film, the by-products of the development reaction simultaneously combine with chemicals known as color couplers that are included either in the film itself or in the developer solution to form colored dyes. Because the by-products are created {{in direct proportion to}} the amount of exposure and development, the dye clouds formed are also in proportion to the exposure and development. Following development, the silver is converted back to silver halide crystals in the bleach step. It is removed from the film during the process of fixing the image on the film with a solution of ammonium thiosulfate or sodium thiosulfate (hypo or fixer). Fixing leaves behind only the formed color dyes, which combine to make up the colored visible image. Later color films, like Kodacolor II, have as many as 12 emulsion layers, with upwards of 20 different chemicals in each layer.|$|E

The spectral reflectivity data of 1269 Munsell matte color chips were used as reference data.

40|$|Breakwaters are {{important}} objects to protect coastal- and harbour areas. To minimalize {{the probability of}} failure of breakwaters, {{a lot of research}} has been conducted concerning the stability of breakwaters. After Iribarren and Hudson, an influential research is conducted by Van der Meer. The literature research of this report will provide more background information concerning their researches on the stability of breakwaters. Van der Meer tested three sorts of breakwater constructions. The first breakwater structure contained a homogeneous construction (P= 0. 6) The second and third structure consisted of respectively a construction with impermeable core (P= 0. 1) and a structure with a <b>filter</b> <b>layer</b> and a permeable core (P= 0. 5). These variants of breakwaters were constructed with different slopes angles to require as much information possible concerning the stability of breakwaters. Van der Meer discovered two formulas for the stability of breakwaters. The first formula is used for plunging waves while the second formula is used for surging waves. Within these formulas, important factors as damage, wave height and notional permeability are included. The most important parameter of the formulas of Van der Meer is the notional permeability factor P. Van der Meer conducted his research on three different constructions and has designed a fourth construction based on the stability curves. This fourth construction has a value of permeability of 0. 4. This value is estimated based on curve fitting. Following the research done by Van der Meer, Kik has subsequently researched the notional permeability of three breakwater constructions. Firstly, Kik repeated the test with a construction of impermeable core (model 1 /P= 0. 08) and the test with the construction of <b>filter</b> <b>layer</b> and permeable core (model 2 / P= 0. 05) of Van der Meer. Lastly, Kik did a third test existing of a variant of the design of the fourth construction of Van der Meer (model 3 / P= 0. 35). Concluding from his research, Kik stated that the ‘Root mean square equation’ is a reliable method to determine the notional permeability P. During this research the influence of the thickness of the <b>filter</b> <b>layer</b> on the notional permeability P is studied. This research will also try to answer the question whether other relevant aspects might influence the notional permeability as well. The elaboration of this research is performed in a practical way in a wave flume in the water laboratory of the faculty of civil engineering of the TU Delft. Scale models of the breakwaters were constructed to test the notional permeability of the breakwaters. In the water laboratory three models were tested. Firstly, model 3 of Kik is repeated as model 3 A, with a calculated value of notional permeability P 0. 38. The construction of model 3 A is build with a top <b>layer,</b> <b>filter</b> <b>layer</b> 1, <b>filter</b> <b>layer</b> 2 and a impermeable core. Second, another variant of model 3 of Kik is designed and tested (model 4). However, the measured damage figures were too low and therefore they could not be used to calculate a value for the notional permeability P. The construction of model four is build with a top <b>layer,</b> <b>filter</b> <b>layer</b> 1, <b>filter</b> <b>layer</b> 2 which is thicker as model 3 A and an impermeable core. Finally, model 5 is tested with a calculated value of notional permeability of P 0. 45. This model is designed from the fourth construction of Van der Meer. The construction of model 5 is build with a top <b>layer,</b> <b>filter</b> <b>layer</b> 1 and a permeable core with the same material of <b>filter</b> <b>layer</b> 2 of model 3 A and model 4. The results of this research show that the influences of the notional permeability P exists of the ratio of the armour layer thickness and the thickness of the second <b>filter</b> <b>layer.</b> If the layer thicknesses are equal the value for notional permeability P is 0. 38, which follows from model 3 A. If the second layer has an infinite thickness (permeable core), the value for notional permeability P is 0. 45, which follows from model 5. The value of the notional permeability P of model 5 corresponds to the design calculations of the computer model HADEER. Van der Meer discovered using this computer model that the ratio of dn 50 a/ dn 50 f = 5 has a value on the notional permeability P of 0. 43 – 0. 44. During this research, while using two different methods, a value of the notional permeability P of 0. 45 was calculated. coastal engineeringHydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
