[...] "Just one last puff and two last regrets/Three spirits and 12 lonely steps", Gaga sings, before uttering the hook, [...] "I need <b>you</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> dope". The lyrics meant that the singer wanted her lost love more than an addict pines for drugs. [...] "Dope" [...] {{is one of the}} most personal songs of Gaga, according to Joe Lynch from Fuse. With lines like [...] "I promise this drink is my last one / I know I fucked up again / Because I lost my only friend", Lynch believed that Gaga was referring to her former assistant Jennifer O'Neil who had months ago moved to court against the singer for unpaid wages.|$|E

500|$|The third track, [...] "Blue Jeans", was {{influenced}} by hip hop and has a minimalist beat that recalls songs by Timbaland. Del Rey also raps in a few verses of the song such as [...] "You're so fresh to death and sick as cancer [...] Love <b>you</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> those bitches before". [...] "Off to the Races" [...] has been lyrically described as [...] "a freak show of inappropriate co-dependency", with a chorus that recalls Sheryl Crow's [...] "down and out drunken loner persona" [...] in her 1994 single [...] "Leaving Las Vegas". Pryia Elan of NME noted the track [...] "almost falls {{under the weight of}} this persona. There's none of 'Video Games' measured, piano-led reflection. Instead the psychosexual rumblings of the lyrics and the dual voices she uses off set the comparatively simple musical shades on display." ...|$|E
500|$|The World's Most Phallic Building contest was {{a contest}} held in 2003 by Cabinet {{magazine}} {{to find the}} building which most resembled a human phallus. The contest originated when writer Jonathan Ames drew the ire of Slate readers by claiming, in a diary that was later published in his book I Love <b>You</b> <b>More</b> <b>Than</b> You Know, that the Williamsburg Bank Building in Brooklyn, New York City, New York, was the world's most phallic. This led Cabinet magazine to initiate a search of its own to find which building was truly the [...] "world's most phallic". Cities and readers subsequently poured in their views and staked their claims to the magazine's editors. After months of entries and discussion, the Ypsilanti Water Tower was announced as the winner, [...] although the winner of a readers' poll was the Florida State Capitol building in Tallahassee. Another notable nominee was the Torre Agbar of Barcelona.|$|E
500|$|Throughout {{his career}} Ketèlbey {{composed}} songs, providing {{the words for}} most of those written after 1913. His first, unpublished, song, [...] "Be Still, Sad Heart" [...] dates from 1892, and {{during the rest of}} the 1890s he wrote songs for children as well as sentimental ballads like [...] "Believe Me True" [...] (1897) for their seniors. Many had words by Florence Hoare, whose other lyrics included English words for songs by Tchaikovsky, Gounod and Brahms. Ketèlbey's popular ballads included [...] "The Heart's Awakening" [...] (1907), [...] "My Heart-a-dream" [...] (1909), [...] "I Loved <b>You</b> <b>More</b> <b>Than</b> I Knew" [...] (1912), [...] "My Heart Still Clings to You" [...] (1913), [...] "Will You Forgive?" [...] (1924), and [...] "A Birthday Song" [...] (1933). He wrote patriotic songs for use in three wars: [...] "There's Something in the English After all" [...] (1899, during the Boer War), [...] "The Trumpet Voice of Motherland is Calling" [...] (1914, for the First World War) and [...] "Fighting for Freedom" [...] (1941, during the Second World War). His sole Shakespeare setting, [...] "Blow! Blow! Thou Winter Wind" [...] (1898, revised 1951), was written as incidental music for a production of As You Like It.|$|E

500|$|Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine was {{initially}} dismissive of the version {{performed at the}} iTunes Festival due to its [...] "bland" [...] arrangement and [...] "elementary" [...] melody, but reacted well to the new version on Artpop, saying: [...] "Gaga has been very public about her supposed battle with addiction, {{and whether or not}} it's just another costume for the singer to wear, she's nonetheless composed a convincing anthem of remorse." [...] Idolator reviewer Christina Lee believed that with [...] "Dope", Gaga had found another novel way of stripping herself down in the song, and complimented the singer's vocals in the song. Michael Cragg from The Guardian, who was granted an early listen to Artpop, felt that the song was an emotional highlight of the album, denoting it as the record's [...] "one real moment of calm" [...] and [...] "the album's most tender moment". However, Cragg was skeptical about the line [...] "I need <b>you</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> dope", feeling it to be a less impressive comparison. Jon Pareles from The New York Times found [...] "Dope" [...] to be similar to piano ballads by singer Elton John.|$|E
500|$|Sinatra did {{not serve}} in the {{military}} during World War II. On December 11, 1943, he was officially classified 4-F ("Registrant not acceptable for military service") by his draft board because of a perforated eardrum. However, army files reported that Sinatra was [...] "not acceptable material from a psychiatric viewpoint", but his emotional instability was hidden to avoid [...] "undue unpleasantness for both the selectee and the induction service". Briefly, there were rumors reported by columnist Walter Winchell that Sinatra paid $40,000 to avoid the service, but the FBI found this to be without merit. Toward the end of the war, Sinatra entertained the troops during several successful overseas USO tours with comedian Phil Silvers. During one trip to Rome he met the Pope, who asked him if he was an operatic tenor. [...] Sinatra worked frequently with the popular Andrews Sisters in radio the 1940s, and many USO shows were broadcast to troops via the Armed Forces Radio Service (AFRS). In 1944 Sinatra released [...] "I Couldn't Sleep a Wink Last Night" [...] as a single and recorded his own version of Crosby's [...] "White Christmas", and the following year he released [...] "I Dream of <b>You</b> (<b>More</b> <b>Than</b> You Dream I Do)", [...] "Saturday Night (Is the Loneliest Night of the Week)", [...] "Dream" [...] and [...] "Nancy (with the Laughing Face)" [...] as singles.|$|E
500|$|Georgina Littlejohn from Entertainmentwise {{called the}} track [...] "a passionate love song that proves that Gaga {{is as much}} a {{songwriter}} as an entertainer." [...] Alex Young from Consequence of Sound praised Gaga's vocals and deemed the track [...] "easily the best track to surface from Artpop thus far". Jason Lipshutz from Billboard called the song a [...] "Broadway show-stopper", adding that Gaga's broken vocals are brilliant and bruising. Jim Farber from New York Daily News felt the song expressed [...] "great need in the lyrics while displaying only bravado in her delivery." [...] Bradley Stern from MuuMuse found the [...] "wailing piano ballad" [...] to be among the weakest tracks from Artpop. Kory Grow of Rolling Stone felt that the emotional high point of [...] "Dope" [...] is its chorus, and is a turning point for the song. While reviewing Artpop, Jerry Shriver from USA Today commented that amongst the loud music of the other songs, [...] "Dope" [...] sounded like [...] "too much of a slog" [...] to provide any change of pace while listening to the record. Leila Brilson from Refinery29 felt that with [...] "Dope" [...] Gaga allowed her [...] "operatic voice" [...] to soar; the song itself is a heart-aching ballad and an unforgettable moment on Artpop. This view was shared by Spencer Kornhaber from The Atlantic who added that the song was [...] "a histrionic piano ballad". London Evening Standards John Aizlewood criticized the song's lyrics for being submissive, instead of Gaga's empowerment themes. Another negative review came from Chris Bosman from Time, saying that although [...] "Dope" [...] was the most [...] "streamlined" [...] release of Gaga's discography, [...] "the effect would be more powerful if 'Dope' didn't hit every excruciating piano ballad cliché (and feature the hilariously clunky line 'I need <b>you</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> dope')." ...|$|E

500|$|Swift became {{inspired}} to write [...] "You Belong with Me" [...] after she overheard a male {{friend of hers}} speaking to his girlfriend through a phone call. He acted defensive as his girlfriend yelled at him, and said to her, [...] "No, baby...I had {{to get off the}} phone really quickly... I tried to call you right back... Of course I love <b>you.</b> <b>More</b> <b>than</b> anything! Baby, I’m so sorry." [...] Out of the sympathy she felt towards him in the situation, Swift developed a concept for a song. In a writing session with co-writer Liz Rose, Swift explained the situation along with her idea and conceived the song's opening line, [...] "You’re on the phone with your girlfriend / she’s upset / she's going off about something that you said." [...] Together, they developed a story line, which described Swift being in love with the male friend and her having the desire for him to break up with his current girlfriend for her. Swift described the song's concept as [...] "basically about wanting someone who is with this girl who doesn't appreciate him at all. Basically like 'girl-next-door-itis.' You like this guy who you have known for your whole life, and you know him better than she does but somehow the popular girl gets the guy every time." [...] Swift recalled, [...] "It was really fun for us to write the line, 'She wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts'." [...] "You Belong with Me" [...] was first released as a promotional single from Fearless on November 4, 2008, as part of Countdown to Fearless, an exclusive campaign by the iTunes Store; the song was then released as the third single from Fearless on April 18, 2009.|$|E

2500|$|The most {{complete}} {{text of the}} Gospel of Mary is contained in Berolinensis 8502, but even so, it is missing six manuscript pages {{at the beginning of}} the document and four manuscript pages in the middle. As such, the narrative begins in the middle of a scene, leaving the setting and circumstances unclear. King believes, however, that references to the death of the Savior and the commissioning scene later in the narrative indicate the setting in the first section of the text is a post resurrection appearance of the Savior. As the narrative opens, the Savior is engaged in dialogue with his disciples, answering their questions on the nature of matter and the nature of sin. At the end of the discussion, the Savior departs leaving the disciples distraught and anxious. According to the story, Mary speaks up with words of comfort and encouragement. [...] Then Peter asks Mary to share with them any special teaching she received from the Savior, “Peter said to Mary, ‘Sister, we know that the Savior loved <b>you</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> the rest of the women. Tell us the words of the Savior which you remember—which you know (but) we do not, nor have we heard them.’” [...] Mary responds to Peter’s request by recounting a conversation she had with the Savior about visions.|$|E
