2500|$|The Party {{threatened}} {{to take away}} many right leaning voters from the Conservatives. Furthermore, about 200 candidates broke with official Conservative policy to oppose British membership of the single European currency. Major fought back, saying: [...] "Whether <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> or disagree with me; like me or loathe me, don't bind my hands when I am negotiating {{on behalf of the}} British nation." [...] The moment is remembered as one of the defining, and most surreal, moments of the election.|$|E
60|$|LUBIN. I am glad <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> that Socialism and Votes for Women {{are signs}} of decay.|$|E
60|$|GILBERT. Ah! don't {{say that}} <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> When people {{agree with me}} I always feel that I must be wrong.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{understand}} you, mother. I thought <b>you</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> {{about the}} writer of that letter--her sincerity, simplicity." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{much more}} serious? Well, {{what can you}} do? We had this out when you were here in the summer, and <b>you</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> then {{that we could do}} nothing. The {{situation}} hasn't changed at all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What did {{you mean}} by that look of {{kindness}} you bestowed upon me just now, when I said <b>you</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> on all subjects but one?' asked De Stancy half humorously, as he held open a little door for her, the others having gone ahead.|$|R
60|$|LADY HUNSTANTON. Ah! we {{women should}} forgive everything, shouldn't we, dear Mrs. Arbuthnot? I am sure <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> in that.|$|E
6000|$|... "An {{autograph}} letter," [...] Lutchester repeated firmly. [...] "Now don't <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> that Fischer's game is just {{a little}} too daring?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Kate, if she {{perceived}} his abstraction, ignored it. [...] "Well, I hope <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> now. Clarke is her control, {{her black}} beast." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's all then I invite you--a mistake, as you {{properly}} call it--to {{allow me}} to impute to you. I'm not accusing you of having made fifty. You made none whatever, I hold, when <b>you</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> such eagerness about the striking change in him." ...|$|R
6000|$|BOHUN (again {{interrupting}} him). My {{specialty is}} being right when {{other people are}} wrong. If <b>you</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> I should be of no use here. (He nods at him to drive the point home; then turns suddenly and forcibly on Crampton.) Now you, Mr. Crampton: what point in this business have you most at heart? ...|$|R
60|$|<b>You</b> always <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> and there's {{an end of}} it. So I have to rack my brains again.|$|R
6000|$|TANNER. Oh, England {{will survive}} your disapproval. Meanwhile, I {{understand}} that <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> {{as to the}} practical course we are to take? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{opinion is}} that no {{circumstances}} whatever would justify such an act," [...] said Sam with indignation. [...] "Don't <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> Robin?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That, I think," [...] {{he murmured}} to himself, [...] "is true." [...] And {{suddenly}} he addressed his daughter. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> my dear?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When {{you have}} read that," [...] replied Miss Bulstrode, handing her the letter, [...] "perhaps <b>you</b> will <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> that Herring is--an ass." ...|$|R
6000|$|HESTER. I didn't {{know you}} had heard it. But I knew <b>you</b> would <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> A woman who has sinned should be punished, shouldn't she? ...|$|R
60|$|THE COUNT. Whatever we {{may think}} of the play, gentlemen, I'm sure <b>you</b> will <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> {{that there can be}} only one opinion about the acting.|$|R
6000|$|... "Two {{or three}} days, {{if we can}} get camels," [...] the other replied. [...] "I see <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> then, as to Craig's {{probable}} destination?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{had better}} not. You have been abominably treated; {{but this is}} no time for collisions. <b>You</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> Phoebe; his absence would be the wisest course.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Lydgate {{had really}} {{lost sight of}} the fact that Mr. Chichely was his Majesty's coroner, and ended innocently with the question, [...] "Don't <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> Dr. Sprague?" ...|$|E
60|$|I hope, meanwhile, that <b>you</b> will <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> {{that there}} is plenty of {{geological}} matter to be seen and thought over in the neighbourhood of any town.|$|R
6000|$|... "I know, but {{the poor}} souls----Well, I'm sure <b>you</b> will <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> in one thing: The chief task of a {{librarian}} {{is to get}} people to read." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I won't be {{put down}} on that point," [...] said Erskine. [...] "I admire a man that kills a king. <b>You</b> will <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> there, Trefusis, won't you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{country which}} neglects {{the laws of}} {{progress}} is not a country which can ever hope for prosperity. Don't <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> sir?" [...] he asked the King.|$|E
6000|$|... 'If he {{were like}} other youths, I should {{know how to}} deal with him. But <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> he is not fit to have a larger sum in his hands.' ...|$|E
60|$|PERCIVAL. [patiently] Please try to {{get your}} mind clear, Mr Brown. I pointed out {{to you that you}} could not, as a gentleman, disparage a lady's character. <b>You</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> I hope.|$|E
6000|$|... "It was you who {{discovered}} this little accident," [...] I remarked. [...] "I think <b>you</b> will <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> {{that it is}} best to say nothing more about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is {{as may be}} necessary. A man of his art and {{character}} may have recourse to other means to gratify his malice. Do <b>you</b> not <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> Signore?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{young lady}} is that gentleman's daughter, sir," [...] said I, [...] "before whom, I think <b>you</b> will <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> {{it is not}} very {{becoming}} to discuss his character." ...|$|R
6000|$|JOHNNY. So I say. It's {{really a}} great {{encouragement}} to me to find <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> For of course if nobody agrees with you, how are {{you to know that}} youre not a fool? ...|$|E
6000|$|JOHNNY. Well, obviously, that {{independence}} {{for women is}} wrong and shouldnt be allowed. For their own good, you know. And {{for the good of}} morality in general. <b>You</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> Lord Summerhays, dont you? ...|$|E
6000|$|Dick {{has been}} {{teaching}} me to take life flippantly. And I have learnt that things are only serious if you take them seriously, and that is desperately stupid. [To LUCY.] Don't <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>me?</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are awfully good," [...] said Cicely, [...] "but <b>you</b> must <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> more prudently {{now that}} we are out here, and I will not tell mother until Miriam knows." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I thought <b>you</b> would <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> when <b>you</b> understood," [...] murmured Diana, and her {{expression}} was so smug and satisfied that Patsy was seized with an irresistible spirit of mischief.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why {{should one}} say what {{one does not}} think," [...] Mary said, sturdily, [...] "it {{would be much better}} if we all did so. Do <b>you</b> not <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> Mr. Hartington?" ...|$|R
