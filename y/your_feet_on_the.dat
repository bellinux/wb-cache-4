2500|$|On May 28, Minogue's 45th birthday, she {{announced}} the buzz single [...] "Skirt", {{and it was}} made available on Beatport on June 24. Whilst the track attracted positive commentary from critics, mainly for Minogue's newly experimented sound of electronic dance music, she revealed {{that it would not}} feature on the then-upcoming studio album. In February 2014, Minogue confirmed Furler as the album's executive co-producer's. Minogue stated in an interview with American website Idolator that [...] "I got on with her so well... I asked her if she would executive-produce. I was hoping she would say yes. I didn’t know if it was something she had done or was interested in, or if maybe she just preferred writing and doing her own music." [...] That same month, she commented to American Billboard magazine; [...] "I felt like I needed a new landscape, and once you've got <b>your</b> <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground you're raring to go. [...] So far the support has been great, and it's just another part of this amalgamation of 'new' that I had wished for and was struck by." ...|$|E

[...] At the time, top 40 radio {{was on the}} decline as DJs preferred to play album-oriented progressive rock. [...] Loosely based on the TV program Your Hit Parade, the show counted down from #40 on the pop charts to #1—the first #1 was Three Dog Night's [...] "Mama Told Me (Not to Come)"—based on the Billboard Hot 100 each week. [...] The show, however, was {{not just about the}} countdown. [...] Kasem mixed in biographical information about the artists, flashback, and [...] "long-distance dedication" [...] segments where he read letters written by listeners to dedicate songs of their choice to far away loved ones. [...] He often included trivia facts about songs he played and artists whose work he showcased. Frequently, he mentioned a trivia fact about an unnamed singer before a commercial break, then provided the name of the singer after returning from the break. [...] Kasem ended the program with his signature sign-off, [...] "Keep <b>your</b> <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground and keep reaching for the stars." ...|$|E

60|$|When {{we reached}} the pier we found an army of Egyptian boys with donkeys no larger than themselves, waiting for passengers--for donkeys are the omnibuses of Egypt. We {{preferred}} to walk, but {{we could not have}} our own way. The boys crowded about us, clamored around us, and slewed their donkeys exactly across our path, no matter which way we turned. They were good-natured rascals, and so were the donkeys. We mounted, and the boys ran behind us and kept the donkeys in a furious gallop, as is the fashion at Damascus. I believe I would rather ride a donkey than any beast in the world. He goes briskly, he puts on no airs, he is docile, though opinionated. Satan himself could not scare him, and he is convenient--very convenient. When you are tired riding you can rest <b>your</b> <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground and let him gallop from under you.|$|E

6000|$|Oxford still {{retains a}} memory of the hideous crime of this reign. In Broad Street, under the windows of Balliol, {{there is a small}} stone cross in the pavement. This marks the place where, some years ago, a great heap of wooden ashes was found. These ashes were the remains of the fire of October 16th, 1555--the day when Ridley and Latimer were burned. [...] "They were brought," [...] says Wood, [...] "to a place over against Balliol College, where now stands a row of poor cottages, a little before which, under the town wall, ran so clear a stream that it gave the name of Canditch, candida fossa, to the way leading by it." [...] To recover the memory of that event, let the reader fancy himself {{on the top of the}} tower of St. Michael's, that is, {{immediately}} above the city wall. No houses interfere between him and the open country, in which Balliol stands; not with its present frontage, but much farther back. A clear stream runs through the place where is now Broad Street, and the road above is dark with a swaying crowd, out of which rises the vapour of smoke from the martyrs' pile. At <b>your</b> <b>feet,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> top of Bocardo prison (which spanned the street at the North Gate), Cranmer stands manacled, watching the fiery death which is soon to purge away the memory of his own faults and crimes.

6000|$|... 'Judge, then,' {{returned}} Francis, {{adopting the}} style of the story- book, 'with what success. I go to a region which is a bit of water-side Bristol, with a slice of Wapping, a seasoning of Wolverhampton, and a garnish of Portsmouth, and I say, [...] "Will YOU come and be idle with me?" [...] And it answers, [...] "No; for I am a great deal too vaporous, and a great deal too rusty, and a great deal too muddy, and a great deal too dirty altogether; and I have ships to load, and pitch and tar to boil, and iron to hammer, and steam to get up, and smoke to make, and stone to quarry, and fifty other disagreeable things to do, and I can't be idle with you." [...] Then I go into jagged up-hill and down-hill streets, where I am in the pastrycook's shop at one moment, and next moment in savage fastnesses of moor and morass, beyond the confines of civilisation, and I say to those murky and black-dusty streets, [...] "Will YOU come and be idle with me?" [...] To which they reply, [...] "No, we can't, indeed, for we haven't the spirits, and we are startled by the echo of <b>your</b> <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sharp pavement, and we have so many goods in our shop- windows which nobody wants, and we have so much to do for a limited public which never comes to us to be done for, that we are altogether out of sorts and can't enjoy ourselves with any one." [...] So I go to the Post-office, and knock at the shutter, and I say to the Post-master, [...] "Will YOU come and be idle with me?" [...] To which he rejoins, [...] "No, I really can't, for I live, as you may see, in such a very little Post-office, and pass my life behind such a very little shutter, that my hand, when I put it out, is as the hand of a giant crammed through the window of a dwarf's house at a fair, and I am a mere Post-office anchorite in a cell much too small for him, and I can't get out, and I can't get in, and I have no space to be idle in, even if I would."

60|$|THERE {{were two}} {{branches}} of the Hydraulic: one followed {{the course of the}} Miami, from some unknown point to the northward, on the level of its high bank, and joined the other where it emptied into the river just above the bridge. This last came down what had been a street, and it must have been very pretty to have these two swift streams of clear water rushing through the little town, under the culverts, and between the stone walls of its banks. But what a boy mainly cares for in a thing is use, and the boys tried to make some use of the Hydraulic, since it was there to find what they could do with it. Of course they were aware of the mills dotted along its course, and they knew that it ran them; but I do not believe any of them thought that it was built merely to run flour-mills and saw-mills and cotton-mills. They did what they could to find out its real use, but they could make very little of it. The current was so rapid that it would not freeze in winter, and in summer they could not go in swimming in it by day, because it was so public, and at night the Basin had more attractions. There was danger of cutting <b>your</b> <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> broken glass and crockery which people threw into the Hydraulic, and though the edges of the culverts were good for jumping off of, the boys did not find them of much practical value. Sometimes you could catch sunfish in the Hydraulic, but it was generally too swift, and the only thing you could depend upon was catching crawfish. These abounded so that if you dropped a string with a bit of meat on it into the water anywhere, you could pull it up again with two or three crawfish hanging to it. The boys could not begin to use them all for bait, which was the only use their Creator seemed to have designed them for; but they had vaguely understood that people somewhere ate them, or something like them, though they had never known even the name of lobsters; and they always intended to get their mothers to have them cooked for them. None of them ever did.|$|E
