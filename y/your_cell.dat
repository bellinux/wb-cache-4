He went on to explain that, after a show of force and a threat to also drop a nuclear bomb on Tehran, the U.S. should then say: if [...] "You [...] want to be peaceful, just reverse it all and we will guarantee that you can have a nuclear power plant for electricity purposes, energy purposes."

They are particularly excited about topics that are immediately rel-evant to them—topics around {{the human body and}} what it is made of, basic bodily functions, how and why they look the way they do, and why they get sick and how they get better. As such, science is a powerful tool for getting students ex-cited about reading and for challenging them to apply their developing reading skills to deepen their understanding of topics that are of interest. Author and cancer researcher Fran Balkwill and artist Mic Rolph have teamed up to bring these topics to children in their beautifully illustrated series Enjoy <b>Your</b> <b>Cells.</b> This series includes four books. Enjoy <b>Your</b> <b>Cells</b> introduces readers to “an amazing hidden world just beneath your skin.

At least, so thought Arthur, as he sat in the private parlour smoking his pipe and reflecting on the curious vicissitudes of existence. Now, here he was, with all the hopes and interests of his life utterly changed in a single space of six-and- twenty hours. Why, six-and-twenty hours ago, he had never met his respected guardian, nor Sir John and Lady Bellamy, nor Philip and his daughter. He could hardly believe that it was only that morning that he had first seen Angela. It seemed weeks ago, and, if time could have been measured on a new principle, by events and not by minutes, it would have been weeks. The wheel of life, he thought, revolves with a strange irregularity. For months and years it turns slowly and steadily under the even pressure of monotonous events. But, on some unexpected day, a tide comes rushing down the stream of being, and spins it round at speed; and then tears onward to the ocean called the Past, leaving its plaything to creak and turn, to turn and creak, or wrecked perhaps and useless.|$|E
