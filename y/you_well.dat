25|$|In 1968, Callas told Lord Harewood, De Hildalgo had {{the real}} great {{training}}, {{maybe even the}} last real training of the real bel canto. As a young girl—thirteen years old—I was immediately thrown into her arms, meaning that I learned the secrets, the ways of this bel canto, which of course as <b>you</b> <b>well</b> know, is not just beautiful singing. It is a very hard training; it {{is a sort of}} a strait-jacket that you're supposed to put on, {{whether you like it or}} not. You have to learn to read, to write, to form your sentences, how far you can go, fall, hurt yourself, put yourself back on your feet continuously. De Hidalgo had one method, which was the real bel canto way, where no matter how heavy a voice, it should always be kept light, it should always be worked on in a flexible way, never to weigh it down. It is a method of keeping the voice light and flexible and pushing the instrument into a certain zone where it might not be too large in sound, but penetrating. And teaching the scales, trills, all the bel canto embellishments, which is a whole vast language of its own.|$|E
500|$|In {{terms of}} {{advanced}} technology, the Soviet Union was {{far behind the}} United States, Western Europe, and Japan. Vacuum tube electronics remained in use long after they became obsolete elsewhere, and many factories in the 80s still used 1930s-vintage machine tools. General Nikolai Ogarkov in an unusually candid interview with an American journalist in 1982 admitted that [...] "In America, even small children play with computers. We do not even have them in all {{the offices of the}} Defense Ministry. And for reasons <b>you</b> <b>well</b> know, we cannot make computers widely available in our society." [...] Soviet manufacturing was not only primitive by Western standards, but extremely inefficient, often requiring 2-3 times the labor force of a mill or factory in the US.|$|E

If you can't read it I will help you and then burn it at once." [...] She told Reid the squabbles placed her and the Munshi under strain, which he replied was unlikely in the latter's case [...] "judging from his robust appearance and undiminished stoutness". Lord Salisbury told Reid he thought it unlikely in her case too, and that she secretly enjoyed the arguments because they were [...] "the only form of excitement she can have".|$|E

500|$|Critics responded {{positively}} to the film. In {{an article in}} The Times David Chater awarded the programme the TV choice of the day, describing it as [...] "tremendous", and [...] "the wonderful surprise of Christmas". The film was described in The Telegraph as a [...] "rare treat", as it is [...] "something that teenagers and parents can watch together". This view was shared by producer Anne Brogan, {{who said that the}} film was something [...] "that parents and children will enjoy watching while giving them much to talk about". Tom Sutcliffe, writing for The Independent, said Stevenson was [...] "good as a woman who was far more comfortable in the past than the present", and that [...] "her performance was more than matched by that of Dakota Blue Richards as April, mostly banked-down and wary but prone to sudden wild flashes of anger". He criticised some of the [...] "implausibilities", saying that the plot was, at times, [...] "a lot kinder than the world might have been", but said that [...] "it still made <b>you</b> <b>well</b> up with its final reconciliation" [...] with emotion that had been [...] "honestly earned". Euan Ferguson, in an article in The Guardian, said that the film [...] "hooked and haunted", and added that Stevenson played Marion like [...] "a kind of updated" [...] Jean Brodie.|$|E

[...] The accident is also {{referred to in the}} 1998 film One of Them. In Money, Love: A Novel by Brad Barkley, the character Roman organizes a show of Celebrity Death Cars, including that of Dean and Mansfield, to win back his love interest Gladys. In the song Movie Star by the rock band Cracker sang, [...] "Well the movie star, well she crashed her car, but everyone said she was beautiful even without her head, everyone said she was dangerous", making an allusion to the accident. In the 2003 single, [...] "Overdrive," [...] Katy Rose sang, [...] "I'm sitting in Jayne Mansfield's car." [...] The Hollywood Forever Cemetery, where her cenotaph is located, is described as one of the sights to see in California by the regional tourist guide by Lonely Planet. In the episode In Escrow of Dead Like Me, George orders a [...] "Jayne Mansfield" [...] for breakfast. When Kiffany the waitress gives George her order it is a pastry in the shape of breasts with blueberries as nipples.

2500|$|Art Modell, a 35-year-old {{advertising}} executive from Brooklyn, purchased {{the team in}} 1961 {{from a group of}} shareholders led by National Insurance Company. The beginnings of a power struggle between Paul Brown and Art Modell took its toll. Journalist D.L. Stewart recounted in Jeff Miller's book on the AFL, Going Long, [...] "As <b>you</b> <b>well</b> can imagine, Jimmy Brown and Paul were not thick. The buzz was that Jimmy had Modell working for him, and Paul took exception to that." [...] The season otherwise was typical: a fifth consecutive league-leading season from Jim Brown and a half-decent performance in the standings, but again, at 8–5–1, they were two games out of a berth in the championship.|$|E

The union's constitution required the convention to be held in May, but AFL leaders (including the influential Executive Council member, Matthew Woll) demanded that Shachtman delay the meeting until such time as he could guarantee that a large majority of delegates would be pro-AFL. [...] "As <b>you</b> <b>well</b> know, your International Union is today being financed to a great part by the reorganizing activities going on here in New York City," [...] Woll and two others wrote Shachtman, [...] "and that without this income your organization would be practically bankrupt."

He was buried by Quddús—who dressed him for burial using one of his own shirts—in a grave to the south of the shrine, while thirty six other Bábís were buried to the north. Quddús gave a brief sermon at the burial calling all Bábís to see Mullá Husayn and the other dead as martyrs of exemplary character and bravery.|$|E

He said, 'A pen which I have made ready for Allah and His Messenger.' The Prophet said. 'May Allah repay <b>you</b> <b>well</b> on behalf of your Prophet! By Allah, I will only ask you to write down revelation from heaven."

2500|$|In 1282 Louis's eldest brother, Thomas, died, and in {{the summer}} of 1283 his mother followed. This {{provoked}} a succession crisis, since the ruling count of Savoy, Philip, had no sons, and the sons of Thomas, thitherto his heir, were too young to hold the reins of government. In accordance with tradition, Amadeus was recognised as Philip's heir. Louis was promised an apanage, which he did not find sufficient, and the later Savoyard chroniclers Jehan Servion and Jean d'Oronville portray him as fighting his brother for the succession or for a larger share of the inheritance while their uncle was dying. Servion puts into Philip's mouth the following denunciation of Louis's motives, before he gathered together his barons and made them recognise Amadeus as his successor: [...] "I have bestowed upon you more of my possessions than you deserve, and you are not in the least grateful. I know <b>you</b> <b>well,</b> for it is always you who complain of things. Your whole being is full of clamor, which makes you unwilling to hold to my will and commandment." [...] It is more probable that [...] "Louis felt inadequately rewarded for his efforts in the wars against the emperor and the dauphin in 1282–84", than that he was a person [...] "full of clamor".|$|E

That appears to be happening now." [...] Jeff Immelt, CEO of General Electric and a member of Obama's Economic Recovery Advisory Board, stated [...] "It is natural to assume that people are angry, and I {{think we have to be}} empathetic and understand that people are not feeling great." [...] Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, the world's largest hedge fund, stated in an interview with Charlie Rose, [...] "I think the number one problem is that we're not having a quality dialogue...I certainly understand the frustration, I understand the dilemma, I understand the discontent."
