2500|$|Mazda of Japan ceased {{production}} of direct drive Wankel engines within their model range in 2012, leaving the motor industry worldwide with no production cars using the engine. The company is continuing {{development of the}} next generation of their Wankel engines, the SkyActiv-R, with a new rear-wheel-drive sports car model announced in October 2015. The company later withdrew this proposed model. Mazda states that the SkyActiv-R solves the three key issues with previous rotary engines: fuel economy, emissions and reliability. Takashi Yamanouchi, the global CEO of Mazda said: [...] "The rotary engine has very good dynamic performance, but it's not so good on economy when you accelerate and decelerate. However, with a range extender <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> rotary engine at a constant 2,000rpm, at its most efficient. It's compact, too." [...] No Wankel engine in this arrangement has yet been used in production vehicles or planes. However, in November 2013 Mazda announced to the motoring press a series-hybrid prototype car, the Mazda2 EV, using a Wankel engine as a range extender. The engine, located under the rear luggage floor, is a tiny, almost inaudible, single-rotor 330cc unit, generating [...] at 4,500rpm, and maintaining a continuous electric output of 20kW. In October 2017 Mazda announced that the rotary engine would be utilised in a hybrid car with 2019 the introduction date.|$|E
