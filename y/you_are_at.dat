She cited her then-husband Marc Anthony as being that person for her. Monica Herrera of Billboard picked up on this, with the lyrics: [...] "I feel the beat again, stronger than before". Scott Shetler of PopCrush pointed out the song's optimistic viewpoint, with the lyrics: [...] "I'm alive, I can breathe, I can feel, I believe." ...|$|E

He added a [...] "high" [...] melody containing the lines [...] "If you're keeping your promise I'm keeping mine" [...] as he felt it seemed [...] "like a shame something more melodic didn't happen in the song". When Beyoncé's creative team was widely searching for {{the concept of the}} song's music video, the singer sent a clip of a song called [...] "Roach Cock" [...] by Hanni El Khatib to Boots. Inspired by its feel, she requested from him to bring elements of that track to [...] "Jealous". He added a [...] "gnarly fuzz guitar ripping in the background" [...] to the song also present in its final version. Beyoncé explained the meaning of [...] "Jealous" [...] on her iTunes Radio channel, [...] " [...] a song about being human. We all get jealous.

500|$|The album {{opens with}} an orchestral intro that {{introduces}} the first track [...] "Honeymoon Avenue", a downtempo song composed {{in the key}} of F-sharp major and set in a [...] time signature at a moderate tempo of 63 beats per minute. The song explores the 1950s musical style mixing doo-wop with an urban-inspired sound. Lirically, [...] "Honeymoon Avenue" [...] uses several metaphors to speaks about someone in a car being driven by her (romantic) partner. The driver is stuck to the same old route and driving mode that may make them crash. In interview with MTV, Grande explained its lyrics saying that [...] "Honeymoon Avenue" [...] "is about knowing <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> {{the end of a}} relationship and wishing it could not be the end {{and go back to the}} beginning and start over." [...] The second track [...] "Baby I" [...] is drenched in a [...] "retro sound" [...] from 1990s R and pop sonority. Lyrically, [...] "Baby I" [...] is a confession on Grande's behalf admitting a special love for someone and how she can't formulate her strong feelings into words. The elements of [...] "Baby I" [...] are further illustrated by its use of finger snaps, a syncopated beat, horns and drums.|$|E
500|$|Wyatville's {{most famous}} work are those rooms {{designed}} in a Rococo style. These rooms take the fluid, playful {{aspects of this}} mid-18th-century artistic movement, including many original pieces of Louis XV decoration, but project them on a [...] "vastly inflated" [...] scale. Investigations after the 1992 fire have shown though that many Rococo features of the modern castle, originally {{thought to have been}} 18th-century fittings transferred from Carlton House or France, are in fact 19th-century imitations in plasterwork and wood, designed to blend with original elements. The Grand Reception Room is the most prominent of these Rococo designs, 100ft (30m) long and 40ft (12m) tall and occupying the site of Edward III's great hall. This room, restored after the fire, includes a huge French Rococo ceiling, characterised by Ian Constantinides, the lead restorer, as possessing a [...] "coarseness of form and crudeness of hand... completely overshadowed by the sheer spectacular effect when <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> a distance". The room is set off by a set of restored Gobelins French tapestries. Although decorated with less gold leaf than in the 1820s, the result remains [...] "one of the greatest set-pieces of Regency decoration". The White, Green and Crimson Drawing Rooms include a total of 62 trophies: carved, gilded wooden panels illustrating weapons and the spoils of war, many with Masonic meanings. Restored or replaced after the fire, these trophies are famous for their [...] "vitality, precision and three-dimensional quality", and were originally brought from Carlton House in 1826, some being originally imported from France and others carved by Edward Wyatt. The soft furnishings of these rooms, although luxurious, are more modest than the 1820s originals, both on the grounds of modern taste and cost.|$|E

500|$|In 1976 Hordern {{joined the}} RSC in Stratford-upon-Avon, where he {{appeared}} as Prospero for Trevor Nunn in The Tempest, an engagement which the actor {{found to be}} unpleasant because of his poor relationship with the show's director, Clifford Williams. After that came a short run of Love's Labour's Lost in which he played Don Adriano de Armado opposite Alan Rickman and Zoë Wanamaker. Hordern was the oldest member {{of the company and}} found it difficult to adjust to the behaviour and attitudes of some of the younger and less experienced actors. He found it different from the 1950s: non-intimate, characterless, and lacking in morale because management preferred discipline rather than offering guidance and assistance to their young actors. Writing in his 1993 biography, Hordern wrote: [...] "Being at Stratford again after all these years was rather like being on a battleship or an aircraft carrier that doesn't often come into harbour. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> sea for long periods and away from the rest of your service and if the captain of your ship is a good one then the ship is happy; if not, then the commission you serve is very unhappy because you are a long way from land. At Stratford that season I was a long way from land." [...] Later, in 1976, Hordern portrayed the kingly father of the Prince (played by Richard Chamberlain) in the musical film adaptation of Cinderella, The Slipper and the Rose, and returned to the role of George in Stoppard's Jumpers at the Lyttelton Theatre. The theatre critic Kenneth Hurren [...] "enjoyed it immoderately" [...] and thought the revival revealed a [...] "tidier play than it look". Hordern compared it to the 1972 version by saying: [...] "It is unquestionably a busy little number, and my first impression of the piece, back in 1972, was that it had more decoration than substance, and that the decoration was more chaotic than coherent." ...|$|E

2500|$|Quicksilver was {{originally}} {{presented as a}} mutant capable of moving and thinking at superhuman speeds. Originally capable of running {{at the speed of}} sound, exposure to the High Evolutionary's Isotope E made it possible for the character to run at supersonic speeds of up to Mach 10 and resist the effects of friction, reduced oxygen, and kinetic impact while moving at super-speeds. Also, he has a fast metabolism and can heal more rapidly than the average human. The character's speed allows him to perform such feats as creating cyclone-strength winds and running up walls or across bodies of water. Pietro's mind can perceive information with a photographic memory short term, becoming faster than the speed of thought, because he can shift his thoughts at a speed faster than normal thought. Also, he can cause vibrations in his body to transfer to solid material, and has superior agility and reflexes compared to other mutants. It has been revealed {{that one of the reasons}} for his abrasive and impatient personality is that it seems to him that the rest of the world is moving in slow motion and that he is constantly waiting for it to catch up. As he once explained, [...] "Have you ever had a day where <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> the ATM and you are in a hurry because you're running late but the person in front of you doesn't know how to use the ATM and they're taking forever? Now imagine what it must be like to spend every day surrounded by people who don't know how to use the ATM." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sackville-West {{constantly}} {{sought to}} improve Woolf's self-esteem, telling {{her not to}} think of herself as a sickly semi-reclusive who needed to hide herself from the world, but rather praised her for her health, her liveliness and sense of wit, her intelligence and achievements as a writer. Sackville-West led Woolf to a reappraisal of herself, helping her to develop a more positive self-image, and a sense that her writings were the products of her strengths, rather than her weakness. From the age of 15 on, Woolf had been led to believe by her father's doctor and her father that reading and writing had a deleterious effect on her nerves, and she needed to engage in physical labour like gardening to prevent a total collapse of her nerves, leading Woolf to spend her time obsessively engaging in physical labor. Woolf tended to push herself relentlessly until illness, whether real or imagined, became the only way that she could relax without guilt. Sackville-West was the first to persuade Woolf that her nervous aliments had been misdiagnosed, and she was better to engage in reading and writing to calm her nerves, advice that was taken. Under her influence, Woolf learned to spend her time switching from one form of intellectual activity to another, from writing a novel to a book review to reading a book, instead of spending her time in physical activities that sapped her strength. In 1925, Sackville-West wrote to Woolf: [...] "Why do you give so much of your energies to the manuscripts of other people? You told me in London that you had at least six novels in your head but were being severe with yourself until you should go to Rodmell. Now <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> Rodmell and what of the six novels? Between Ottoline, Gertrude Stein, and bridal parties which cause you to faint, what time is there for Virginia?" [...] Sackville-West tried to persuade Woolf to learn to relax without guilt, telling her she would feel better if she only learned to rest.|$|E
