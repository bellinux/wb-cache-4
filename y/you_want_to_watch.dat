500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{after the end}} of the series. Keith DeCandido of Tor.com said it was [...] "A mostly {{harmless}} episode that lifts quite a bit from The Cliché Handbook". He thought the performances were fairly solid and that the overall message about the ozone layer was [...] "unsubtle but not too sledgehammery". DeCandido praised Patrick Stewart's performance of Captain Picard, noting that his [...] "anger and outrage and justified self-righteousness at the kidnapping of children modulates nicely into diplomacy when negotiating with the Aldeans and amusingly into total discomfort when he has to actually deal directly with the children". He gave the episode a score of six out of ten. James Hunt, writing for Den of Geek, said that it was [...] "a decent enough story, but not in a way that makes <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> it". He also felt that it was [...] "a complete throwaway episode and contains almost nothing unique to the franchise".|$|E
500|$|The American Broadcasting Company (ABC) {{characterized}} Robbins as [...] "confident", [...] "ambitious", and [...] "cheerful". Shortly {{after her}} {{arrival in the}} show, Robbins became a love-interest for Torres (Ramirez). The {{relationship between the two}} is referred to by fans by the portmanteau [...] "Calzona". Torres' previous girlfriend Erica Hahn (Brooke Smith) was written out of Grey's Anatomy in 2008, {{due to a lack of}} chemistry between the characters. Rhimes praised the chemistry between Robbins and Torres in contrast, comparing it to that between the show's primary couple Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) and Shepherd (Dempsey), and stating: [...] "They have that little thing that makes <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> them." [...] Rhimes named the addition of Capshaw to the cast as one of the elements of the season she was most proud of, commenting that she wished she could have found Callie a love interest that [...] "sparkled" [...] sooner, but was pleased with eventually having found one in Robbins.|$|E
500|$|Hawley's {{first thought}} when [...] "looking at the genre {{is if we}} remove the genre, is there a {{compelling}} show <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> there?" [...] He decided to center the series on the [...] "idea of this epic love story and then putting the genre back into it" [...] and layering elements such as mental illness and special abilities on that foundation Hawley's initial script for Legion was described by Donner as [...] "less fractured", [...] "cohesive [...] much more regular." [...] However, he quickly reconceived the series [...] "and decided more Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Terrence Malick, more whimsy, more impressionistic and went in that direction." [...] This was {{in part due to}} Hawley's desire to depict a [...] "more existential exploration" [...] and a [...] "surreal or dreamlike quality where it's not just about running and kicking." [...] He was inspired by the works of David Lynch to have the series' structure reflect the content of the story. Explaining, Hawley noted that the series' protagonist [...] "doesn't know what's real and what’s not real, [...] the audience should have the same experience". Hawley added that [...] "there is this Alice in Wonderland quality to it, of a story within a story." [...] To acclimatize audiences to the different style of the series, taking into consideration that the show was given a late airtime and so [...] "it’s on {{at the end of their}} very long day", Hawley had several of the early episodes begin with a [...] "hypnotic quality ... often [...] a little ethereal voice-over, to give the sense that we are not rooted in a physical time and place." [...] The intent was to put audiences [...] "in the state of mind to watch Legion." ...|$|E

Another bonus is that Juhi looks stunning in every scene". Her other release of the year was Rakesh Roshan's delayed release , the film was in the making for over five years and when it was released it flopped at the box office, though Chawla's performance was praised. Planet Bollywood wrote [...] "While watching Karobaar, Juhi Chawla's transformation as an actress from a perky-and-cute Juhi of the early 90s to the voluptuous beauty she is today is apparent.
