[...] Referring to his free-market ideology, Greenspan said: [...] "I have found a flaw. I don't know how significant or permanent it is. But I have been very distressed by that fact." [...] When Representative Henry Waxman (D-CA) pressed him to clarify his words.

[...] "You know, that's precisely the reason I was shocked, because I have been going for 40 years or more with very considerable evidence that it was working exceptionally well." [...] Greenspan admitted fault in opposing regulation of derivatives and acknowledged that financial institutions didn't protect shareholders and investments as well as he expected.|$|E
