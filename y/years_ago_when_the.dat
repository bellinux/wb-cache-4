5|$|A vast {{marshland}} {{could only}} have been formed due to the underlying rock formations in southern Florida. The floor of the Everglades formed between 25million and 2million <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Florida peninsula was a shallow sea floor. The peninsula has been covered by sea water at least seven times since the earliest bedrock formation. The rock that makes up the Everglades floor was created as layers of calcium carbonate were compressed by ocean water, making limestone. Fossilized bryozoans and tiny shells, or ooids, make the limestone porous. Water is stored in the rock, sometimes from one year to the next. The length of time that a region in the Everglades remains flooded, called a hydroperiod, determines what particular soils and vegetation are present.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{settlement}} of the Americas occurred some 20,000 <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> first Asians crossed the Bering Strait into Alaska, the earliest archaeological evidence of human habitation of the Bay Area dates to around 3,000 B.C. along {{the shores of the}} bay, with evidence pointing to even earlier settlement in Point Reyes in Marin County. The Miwokan and Costanoan Ohlone people, who were living in the Bay Area at the time of first European contact, were possibly descended from Siberian tribes who arrived at around 1,000 BC by sailing over the Arctic Ocean and following the salmon migration. The Ohlone lived in about forty or so tribes spread throughout the lands adjacent to the San Francisco Bay and as far south as Point Sur in near Monterey Bay.|$|E

5|$|Based on {{microsatellite}} DNA evidence, the sicklefin {{lemon shark}} {{is thought to}} have diverged from its sister species N. brevirostris 1014 million <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> closure of the Tethys Sea separated lemon sharks in the Indian Ocean from those in the Atlantic. The ancestral lemon shark species may have been N. eurybathrodon, the fossilized teeth of which occur in both the United States and Pakistan. Morphological and molecular phylogenetic analyses suggest that Negaprion is grouped with the whitetip reef shark (Triaenodon) and the sliteye shark (Loxodon) in occupying an intermediate position on the carcharhinid evolutionary tree, between the most basal genera (Galeocerdo, Rhizoprionodon, and Scoliodon) and the most derived (Carcharhinus and Sphyrna).|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{extinction}} of Plesiorycteropus, but MacPhee assumed it may have happened around 1000 <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> extinction {{of the rest of the}} subfossil fauna of Madagascar is thought to have concluded. Nothing like it was reported by 17th-century European explorers of the island, and one bone has been radiocarbon dated to around 2150 Before Present (200 BCE). Its extinction is somewhat anomalous, as other recently extinct Madagascan animals—such as subfossil lemurs, Malagasy hippopotamuses, the giant fossa, and elephant birds—were generally larger and not exclusively insectivorous; also, some species with likely more specialized diets, such as the falanouc (Eupleres goudoti) and aye-aye (Daubentonia madagascariensis), did survive. Early human colonists of Madagascar may have caused the extinction of Plesiorycteropus through the destruction of the forest and other disturbances.|$|E
5|$|The Allegheny Plateau {{formed in}} the Alleghenian orogeny some 300million <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> part of Gondwana that became Africa {{collided}} with the landmass that became North America, forming Pangaea. In the dissected plateau, years of erosion have cut away the soft rocks, forming the valleys, and leaving the hardest rocks relatively untouched. The land on which Quehanna Wild Area sits {{was part of the}} coastline of a shallow sea that covered a great portion of what is now North America in the Pennsylvanian subperiod. The high mountains to the east of the sea gradually eroded, causing a buildup of sediment made up primarily of clay, sand and gravel. Tremendous pressure on the sediment caused the formation of the rocks that are found today.|$|E

5|$|In the soil, {{the roots}} {{encounter}} the hyphae of fungi. Many {{of these are}} known as mycorrhiza and form a mutualistic relationship with the tree roots. Some are specific to a single tree species, which will not flourish {{in the absence of}} its mycorrhizal associate. Others are generalists and associate with many species. The tree acquires minerals such as phosphorus from the fungus while it obtains the carbohydrate products of photosynthesis from the tree. The hyphae of the fungus can link different trees and a network is formed, transferring nutrients from one place to another. The fungus promotes growth of the roots and helps protect the trees against predators and pathogens. It can also limit damage done to a tree by pollution as the fungus accumulate heavy metals within its tissues. Fossil evidence shows that roots have been associated with mycorrhizal fungi since the early Paleozoic, four hundred million <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> first vascular plants colonised dry land.|$|E
5|$|The {{village is}} built beside four sandy bays; Minnis Bay to the west, Grenham Bay and Beresford Gap towards the centre and Epple Bay to the east. The village is {{situated}} on the Isle of Thanet, which was a separate island from mainland Kent until around two hundred <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> channel in between became silted up. The area {{to the west of}} the village, between Birchington and Herne Bay, was once part of the channel and is now low-lying marshland. In the east of the village the land rises, forming chalk cliffs and cliff stacks around the beaches at Grenham Bay, Beresford Gap and Epple Bay. A sea wall stretches along the foot of the cliffs to prevent further erosion. The geology of Thanet consists mainly of chalk, deposited when the area was below the sea. Isle of Thanet became exposed above sea-level once the English Channel broke through between Kent and France, causing the sea-level to fall. The whole of the northeast Kent coast has been designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest.|$|E

Containing fragments of shale, siltstone, conglomerates, and breccias, the debris flows entombed plants and animals caught in their paths; the remnants of these ancient flows comprise the rock formations exposed in the Clarno Unit. Preserved in the Clarno Nut Beds are fossils of tropical and subtropical nuts, fruits, roots, branches, and seeds. The Clarno Formation also contains bones, palm leaves longer than , avocado trees, and other subtropical plants from 50million <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> climate was warmer and wetter than it is in the 21stcentury.
