One person makes a mistake and this happens. You [...] have to get killed if <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake.</b> It was madness." [...] Former Formula One and IndyCar driver Mark Blundell agreed, claiming that the Las Vegas circuit was unsuitable for IndyCar racing – this was the last race for the Dallara IR05 – while NASCAR Sprint Cup Series champion Jimmie Johnson called for the series to leave oval racing altogether, though he clarified his statement by saying that the open-wheel type cars on a resurfaced [...] track built for the heavier Sprint Cup and Nationwide Series cars was a bad idea. However, former champion Mario Andretti said that the accident was a [...] "freakish" [...] one-off incident and that facilities at the circuit were adequate for racing. While he admitted surprise that more drivers were not seriously injured, he also cautioned against what he called [...] "knee-jerk reactions" [...] to the accident, calling for any changes to the sport to be carefully considered before being introduced, rather than being rushed into action. Former Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) President Max Mosley, a long-time advocate of increased safety in motorsport, agreed with Andretti, urging a [...] "calm and scientific" [...] approach to any proposed changes, particularly when asked about the proposed introduction of closed canopies for open-wheel racing cars.|$|E
2500|$|In 1964, {{director}} Yuri Lyubimov invited Vysotsky to {{join the}} newly created Taganka Theatre. [...] "'I've written some songs of my own. Won't you listen?' – he asked. I agreed to listen to just one of them, expecting our meeting to last {{for no more than}} five minutes. Instead I ended up listening to him for an entire 1.5 hours," [...] Lyubimov remembered years later of this first audition. On 19 September 1964, Vysotsky debuted in Bertholt Brecht's The Good Person of Szechwan as the Second God (not to count two minor roles). A month later he came on stage as a dragoon captain (Bela's father) in Lermontov's A Hero of Our Time. It was in Taganka that Vysotsky started to sing on stage; the War theme becoming prominent in his musical repertoire. In 1965 Vysotsky appeared in the experimental Poet and Theater (Поэт и Театр, February) show, based on Andrey Voznesensky's work and then Ten Days that Shook the World (after John Reed's book, April) and was commissioned by Lyubimov to write songs exclusively for Taganka's new World War II play. The Dead and the Living (Павшие и Живые), premiered in October 1965, featured Vysotsky's [...] "Stars" [...] (Звёзды), [...] "The Soldiers of Heeresgruppe Mitte" [...] (Солдаты группы [...] "Центр") and [...] "Penal Battalions" [...] (Штрафные батальоны), the striking examples of a completely new kind of a war song, never heard in his country before. As veteran screenwriter Nikolay Erdman put it (in conversation with Lyubimov), [...] "Professionally, I can well understand how Mayakovsky or Seryozha Yesenin were doing it. How Volodya Vysotsky does it is totally beyond me." [...] With his songs – in effect, miniature theatrical dramatizations (usually with a protagonist and full of dialogues), Vysotsky instantly achieved such level of credibility that real life former prisoners, war veterans, boxers, footballers refused to believe that the author himself had never served his time in prisons and labor camps, or fought in the War, or been a boxing/football professional. After the second of the two concerts at the Leningrad Molecular Physics institute (that was his actual debut as a solo musical performer) Vysotsky left a note for his fans in a journal which ended with words: [...] "Now that you've heard all these songs, please, don't <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> of mixing me with my characters, I am not like them at all. With love, Vysotsky, 20 April 1965, XX c." [...] Excuses of this kind he had to make throughout his performing career. At least one of Vysotsky's song themes – that of alcoholic abuse – was worryingly autobiographical, though. By the time his breakthrough came in 1967, he'd suffered several physical breakdowns and once was sent (by Taganka's boss) to a rehabilitation clinic, a visit he on several occasions repeated since.|$|E

5000|$|To put Kahneman's {{regression}} fallacy {{story in}} simple terms, {{it means that}} when <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> severe <b>mistake,</b> later your performance will usually return to average level anyway. This will seem as an improvement and as a [...] "proof" [...] of a belief {{that it is better}} to criticize than to praise (held especially by a person who will criticize you at that [...] "low" [...] moment). In the contrary situation when you happen to do something high above average performance (performance will also return to the average level later on), the change will be perceived as a deterioration and if being praised, as a cause of that deterioration. Just because criticizing or praising precedes the change (regression toward the mean) they are falsely attributed causality. In one case a positive and in the other negative (both false of course). The regression fallacy is also later explained in Rolf Dobelli - The Art of Thinking Clearly.|$|R
