McConnell responded [...] "I'd say that that's inaccurate. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> the community bankers in Kentucky." [...] The Democratic Party's plan for financial reform is actually a way to institute [...] "endless taxpayer funded bailouts for big Wall Street banks", said McConnell.

60|$|By degrees {{a certain}} number of people began to come down the stairs and to pass through the hall, and in this dim light their figures possessed a sort of grace and beauty, {{although}} they were all unknown people. Sometimes they went straight through and out into the garden by the swing door, sometimes they stopped {{for a few minutes and}} bent over the tables and began turning over the newspapers. Terence and Rachel sat watching them through their half-closed eyelids--the Johnsons, the Parkers, the Baileys, the Simmons', the Lees, the Morleys, the Campbells, the Gardiners. Some were dressed in white flannels and were carrying racquets under their arms, some were short, some tall, some were only children, and some perhaps were servants, but they all had their standing, their reason for following each other through the hall, their money, their position, whatever it might be. Terence soon gave up looking at them, for he was tired; and, closing his eyes, he fell half asleep in his chair. Rachel watched the people for some time longer; she was fascinated by the certainty and the grace of their movements, and by the inevitable way in which they seemed to follow each other, and loiter and pass on and disappear. But after a time her thoughts wandered, and she began to think of the dance, which had been held in this room, only then the room itself looked quite different. Glancing round, she could hardly believe that it was the same room. It had looked so bare and so bright and formal on that night when they came into it out of the darkness; it had been filled, too, with little red, excited faces, always moving, and people so brightly dressed and so animated that they did not seem in the least like real people, nor did you feel that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> them. And now the room was dim and quiet, and beautiful silent people passed through it, to whom you could go and say anything you liked. She felt herself amazingly secure as she sat in her arm-chair, and able to review not only the night of the dance, but the entire past, tenderly and humorously, as if she had been turning in a fog for a long time, and could now see exactly where she had turned. For the methods by which she had reached her present position, seemed to her very strange, and the strangest thing about them was that she had not known where they were leading her. That was the strange thing, that one did not know where one was going, or what one wanted, and followed blindly, suffering so much in secret, always unprepared and amazed and knowing nothing; but one thing led to another and by degrees something had formed itself out of nothing, and so one reached at last this calm, this quiet, this certainty, and it was this process that people called living. Perhaps, then, every one really knew as she knew now where they were going; and things formed themselves into a pattern not only for her, but for them, and in that pattern lay satisfaction and meaning. When she looked back she could see that a meaning of some kind was apparent in the lives of her aunts, and in the brief visit of the Dalloways whom she would never see again, and in the life of her father.|$|E

40|$|A feature-length documentary, {{directed}} by Gavin Butt and Ben Walters, edited by Tom Frederic with music by Morgan Quaintance. Through the moving, funny, provocative and inspirational stories of 12 unique figures, This Is Not a Dream charts a path across {{four decades of}} avant-garde experiment and radical escapism. It traces the influences of Andy Warhol, John Waters and Jack Smith to the perverted frontiers of YouTube and Chatroulette, taking in subverted talk shows and soap operas, streetwalker fashions and glittery magic penises along the way. The film is based on exclusive interviews shot in London, New York and Berlin with Dickie Beau, Dara Birnbaum, Nao Bustamante, Vaginal Davis, Cole Escola, Vincent Fremont, Alp Haydar, Holestar, David Hoyle, Kalup Linzy, Glenn O’Brien, and Scottee. The video revolution of the 1970 s offered unprecedented access to the moving image for artists and performers. New worlds began <b>to</b> unfold: <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> back <b>to</b> the mainstream by hijacking its images and upending its values; <b>you</b> <b>could</b> reach out, through the camera, to fellow freaks; and <b>you</b> <b>could</b> create dreamscapes to explore other ways of being. This Is Not a Dream charts the lineage of this revolution and its continued impact on contemporary art and performance. The final live presentation of This Is Not a Dream accompanied by bespoke live work by drag fabulist Dickie Beau, winner of the Oxford Samuel Beckett Theatre Trust Award, 2014, was at Hackney Attic, London on 28 and 29 November 2013...|$|R

50|$|Much of Raya's artwork is {{influenced}} by his Mexican roots. When Raya was a child, he met Mexican street artist Jose Chavez Morado. Raya believes that his encounter with Chavez Morado helped him better understand his goals through painting. Raya remembers his encounter with Chavez Morado, who was known for creating street murals with strong political meaning, and recalls his sentiment towards him and his work, “"I {{talked to him about}} how he mixed his paint and his beautiful images. Muralists were men <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> and relate to. They painted history and denounced war, political corruption, you name it. And they were also active politically.” Influenced by his encounter with Chavez Morado, Raya moved to Chicago and enrolled at Crane High School where he met an art teacher named Jeff Gottlieb. Gottlieb got Raya interested in art, and took him on a field trip one day to the Art Institute of Chicago, where his interest in art was further piqued. Being an immigrant from Mexico, and having moved to United States, Raya had a mixed sense of nationality where he was old enough to remember what Mexico was like, but simultaneously be molded by American values.|$|E

5000|$|The {{match was}} played in hot, dry and blustery {{conditions}} {{in front of}} 116,956 spectators, the fourth-largest crowd in VFL/AFL history. Richmond rover Kevin Bartlett, a renowned finals performer, was prominent early, gathering kicks at will. The first key incident in the match occurred at the 4-minute mark of the quarter. Carlton captain-coach John Nicholls, who had masterminded Richmond's demise in the previous year's Grand Final, was coming out to mark a long kick from Alex Jesaulenko when he was sensationally felled with a high shirtfront by Richmond defender Laurie Fowler, who was running back with the flight of the ball. Fans and players were stunned {{at the sight of}} one of football's most imposing figures laying groggy on the ground and unable to rise. Teammate David McKay reflected thus on the incident: To see someone who was a colossus knocked out like that really stung. He was such an enormous presence on the ground as a leader that we thought, [...] "Shit, what's going to happen now?" ... <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> any player from that day and they'd tell you we were stunned. I'm not saying that was the reason Richmond won on the day, but we were starting to think twice about what the hell was happening out there. The impact of that incident still resonates decades later, and has been replayed on television many times since. As Fowler recalled of that incident a few years later:I was keyed up at the time and all I remember is that I had my eyes on the ball. If Nick had run through me the whole thing would have been forgotten. Nicholls lay motionless for at least three minutes, whilst being attended to by trainers. He was awarded a 15-yard penalty, and scored a goal from the free kick, but suffered double vision and had no impact {{for the remainder of the}} match.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Development of trainable {{policies}} for spoken dialogue systems Thanh Le In human­human interaction, speech {{is the most}} natural and effective manner of communication. Spoken Dialogue Systems (SDS) {{have been trying to}} bring that high level interaction to computer systems, so with SDS, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> machines rather than learn to use mouse and keyboard for performing a task. However, as inaccuracy in speech recognition and inherent ambiguity in spoken language, the dialogue state (user's desire) can never be known with certainty, and therefore, building such a SDS is not trivial. Statistical approaches have been proposed to deal with these uncertainties by maintaining a probability distribution over every possible dialogue state. Based on these distributions, the system learns how to interact with users, somehow to achieve the final goal in the most effective manner. In Reinforcement Learning (RL), the learning process is understood as optimizing a policy of choosing action conditioned on the current belief state. Since the space of dialogue [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{examines}} a {{study which}} developed and began testing {{a process to}} assist instructional designers in eliciting unfamiliar content from subject matter experts and in conceptualizing that content. It explored the development, trial, training and application of the “Content Production Process ” (CPP). Three major insights were gained into {{the use of the}} CPP. Firstly, the novice instructional designer found that knowledge map construction was useful for assisting him to think carefully about the unfamiliar content. Secondly, the knowledge map {{appears to have been a}} useful "communication prop " for assisting the instructional designer in interacting with the subject matter experts. Thirdly, the instructional designer found that combining a “teachback ” procedure with the knowledge map provided a powerful means of checking his understanding of the content against that of the expert. The CPP offers a process for improving the interviewing process in multimedia instructional design.

40|$|When we {{consider}} buying food, clothes or furniture we normally appraise the goods based upon our personal needs {{independent of the}} number of other people who have bought or use the same type of item. Some types of goods, however, have a quality that makes them more valuable to us as the number of other users’ increases. Classical examples are telephone and fax-machine; a more recent one is video phone. These goods were of little value to the first individual who acquired them. The value increased with the total number of items in the network, because the total number of people with whom <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> or send and receive documents to, increased. This phenomenon raises some questions relevant for the providers of these goods or services. Are the commercial and/or organizational challenges different when commercializing goods, which value depend on the amount of users, compared to when commercializing goods with an intrinsic value independent of other users? The theory of positive network effect has revealed that commercialization of network products can present difficulties that are specific for these types of products. The strong impact of direct network effects from inter-customer communication accentuates the importance of distribution rate, i. e. a rapid rollout, and reaching critical mass in order for customers to experience value. The question is whether these challenges require peculiar capabilities. Operational capabilities enabling product innovation in general have been identified, but the capability to commercialize network products and the dynamics of resources and new products in telecommunication contexts have not been examined. The main concern of this thesis is capabilities fostering commercialization of network products...|$|E
