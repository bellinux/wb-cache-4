2500|$|Bedouin tracks linked {{wells and}} the easier traversed ground; {{navigation}} was by sun, star, compass and [...] "desert sense", good {{perception of the}} environment gained by experience. When Italian troops advanced into Egypt in September 1940, [...] the Maletti Group got lost leaving Sidi Omar, disappeared {{and had to be}} found by aircraft. In spring and summer, days are miserably hot and nights very cold. The Sirocco (Gibleh or Ghibli), a hot desert wind, blows clouds of fine sand, which reduces visibility to a few <b>yards</b> and <b>coats</b> eyes, lungs, machinery, food and equipment; motor vehicles and aircraft need special oil and air filters and the barren ground means that water and food as well as military stores, have to be transported from outside.|$|R
50|$|The {{remaining}} operational locomotives {{are still}} used for freight trains, but often they just stand about in larger shunting <b>yards.</b> After the <b>coats</b> of arms {{were found to}} be being stolen repeatedly (mostly as a souvenir, because it is generally assumed that the Ae 6/6 won't stay in service much longer and will eventually be scrapped), SBB Cargo ordered their removal in March 2005 and will presumably turn them over to SBB Historic.|$|R

40|$|The {{planning}} {{and execution of}} offshore construction projects such as pipelaying traditionally rely to a great extend on the expertise of the offshore personnel. The state of practice that is facilitated by this expertise often leads to good solutions, but it has the following limitations: (1) the expertise resides with a few experienced {{people who are not}} always available, (2) communication between the contractor and the customer is based on opinions and past experiences, and not necessarily on objective information, (3) consideration and comparison of alternative solutions and their impact on cost and time is not straightforward, (4) estimation, {{planning and}} control under new conditions and different ones from the past are not always effective leading to either conservative or inadequate solutions. In this paper, simulation is used as a decision support, planning, control, and process improvement tool. The simulation model developed is applied to the loading of the barge at the <b>coating</b> <b>yard,</b> the transportation of the material to the pipelaying site, and the pipelaying activity performed by the pipelaying vessel. The model captures the expertise of the offshore personnel and addresses effectively the limitations listed above. An object-oriented environment is used to develop the simulation model that is proven to be very effective for the particular project for which it was developed and easily adjustable to any new pipelaying project...|$|R
