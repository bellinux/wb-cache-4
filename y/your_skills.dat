25|$|The Transfer System on {{the other}} hand, was never popular with the racers. While very {{efficient}} and less error prone than the cumulative method (and allowing the ABA to run much quicker events with fewer finish line scores), the good racers generally did not like it since they would only get to race once, win their transfer moto and wait for hours if the races are big enough to race the mains ({{on the other}} hand you get to relax a little without the anxiety of doing poorly {{in the next two}} qualifying motos). This means the racers race less often in the ABA and the fun of BMX is in the racing, even if you are losing. Even racers who do not do well did not like the transfer system because the fewer actual races you are in, the less chance you will have to improve <b>your</b> <b>skills</b> in actual race conditions You also race two times less for your money paid for in entrance fees in the ABA in the Transfer system if you win your first moto.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a review}} of the Come and Get It compilation, Douglas Wolk of Pitchfork Media {{includes}} the Temple {{as an example of the}} Beatles' [...] "willingness to go to bat for totally uncommercial ideas" [...] on their short-lived record label; music historian Colin Larkin similarly highlights the devotees' album among an [...] "eccentric catalog" [...] that included the composer John Tavener and the Modern Jazz Quartet. This adventurousness, Wolk continues, provides the [...] "really fun" [...] aspect of the 2010 compilation, just as it [...] "made the Beatles' own Apple releases particularly entertaining". According to David Fricke of Rolling Stone, Harrison viewed the Radha Krishna Temple's presence on Top of the Pops as [...] "one of the greatest thrills of his life". In the same 1980s interview, Harrison added: [...] "That was more fun really than trying to make a pop hit record. It was the feeling of utilizing <b>your</b> <b>skills</b> to do some spiritual service for Krishna." [...] The track [...] "Govinda" [...] continues to be played every morning at ISKCON temples around the world, to greet the deities.|$|E
