6000|$|... "Heard Flockley, Koswell and Larkspur talking together. Koswell {{said he had}} fixed you, {{and that}} <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>having</b> a bad half hour with the president." ...|$|E

6000|$|Twinkling at her, he managed, {{somewhat}} magically, {{to dispel}} her temper of pessimism, {{and she was}} moved to reply:--"You know <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>having</b> a beautiful time, all by yourself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Eh? What? Oh, yes! I {{come from}} Palembang. Ha, ha, ha! You {{know what your}} father said? He said he was afraid <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>having</b> a very dull time of it here." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Then, as you say, Albert, <b>you</b> <b>were</b> not {{to blame}} in the matter. But what about the blood with which, as I see, Edgar is even more deeply stained than <b>you</b> <b>are?</b> <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>been</b> in a brawl?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It {{would be}} strange and hard indeed if I did not,' said Clennam, 'when <b>you</b> <b>are</b> all so forgiving. What I {{was going to}} ask <b>you</b> <b>was,</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> thought of that Miss Wade?' ...|$|R

You were taken, if I remember aright, but did afterwards brain the sentry {{with your}} fetters, and swam the Rhine under {{the fire of}} a regiment.

6000|$|... "No, sir. It was {{to prevent}} any such {{contingency}} that I suggested that you should bicycle to Kingham Manor.

6000|$|... "No, but I've heard {{something}} from Mr. Lawrence, Phil's uncle. Isn't it {{the strangest thing}} ever! I was talking to him after you left, and told him what trouble <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>having,</b> and mentioned Ward Porton and that man the Fords told you about, Obadiah Jones.

You know how chummy he always gets after a couple of smiles. Well, he was talking about--I was saying you're a good man and hoping <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>having</b> a good time--and he said, `Yes,' he says, `he's a good man, but he sure did lay himself wide open by taking this trip. I've got him dead to rights,' he says to me. `I've got a hunch he'll be back here in three or four months,' he says to me. `And do you think he'll walk in and get what he wants? Not him. I'll keep him waiting a month before I give him back his job, and then you watch, Rabin,' he says to me, `you'll see he'll be tickled to death {{to go back to work}} at less salary than he was getting, and he'll have sense enough to not try this stunt of getting off the job again after that. And the trip'll be good for him, anyway--he'll do better work--vacation at his own expense--save us money all round. I tell you, Rabin,' he says to me, `if any of you boys think you can get the best of the company or me you just want to try it, that's all.' Yessir, that's what the old rat told me. You want to watch out for him." ...|$|E
