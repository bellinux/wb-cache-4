2500|$|On March 10, 2004 Lindner {{complained that}} critics of his remarks were not {{focusing}} on the real motives of his bill and his speech. He said [...] "that homosexuality, the rise in sexually transmitted diseases, and comprehensive sexual health education could prompt a future 'holocaust' in Minnesota". On the House floor he said, [...] "hat I am trying to prevent is the holocaust of our children getting STDs, AIDS, and various other diseases {{that are going to}} affect their lives. If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> around here and wait until America becomes another African continent, well, then, you do that, but I'm {{going to do something about}} it." [...] Whatever his intentions, Lindner’s new remarks only managed to offend more Jews and Gays, while upsetting many African-Americans within Minnesota.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am not {{surprised}} then, that <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> together,--though, {{to tell the}} truth, that is rather a reason why I should separate you." ...|$|E
60|$|EILEEN (dully--without {{opening her}} eyes). There's no pain. (There is another pause--then she murmurs indifferently.) There are {{chairs in the}} room you can bring out if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> down.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{might just}} as well have done that before you opened the thing," [...] he remarked. [...] "Anyway, if <b>you</b> merely <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> down, it would have been quite as {{comfortable}} in the shanty." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think one}} {{ought to make}} the most of oneself, just as <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> rise in your profession! No, indeed, I could not bear <b>you</b> if <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> me <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> down and idle, or to dawdle yourself." ...|$|R
60|$|EVE. Why should I? Are you {{eager to}} be rid of me? Only just now <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> me <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> still and never move lest I should stumble and die like the fawn. Now you no longer care.|$|R
6000|$|... "Never, {{and never}} will: it's against my principle. Go and get another chair from the kitchen, Tinker, if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> down; and then we'll {{have a bit}} of supper." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hello, Sammy Jay! I see {{you don't}} feel {{any better than}} usual this morning," [...] said Paddy. [...] "Don't <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> up in this tree while I cut it down?" ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{had it on}} {{his tongue}} to say, [...] "Well, not unless <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> down on some enemy," [...] {{but he did not}} venture this: when it comes to daring of that sort, the boldest man is {{commonly}} a little behind a timid woman.|$|E
6000|$|CHARTERIS (rising). As a favour to me, dearest, {{change the}} subject. Come {{away from the}} piano: I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> here with me. (Takes a step towards her.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, Rollo," [...] said Waldron, [...] "I am {{glad you}} have come. I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> {{on the top}} of my trunk with me, and make it shut down." ...|$|R
3000|$|... “There are {{not many}} places where Asian women can go at night. <b>You</b> don’t <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> {{surrounded}} by all western people in a foreign bar at night. But at Casino, {{there are lots of}} Asians so it makes me feel comfortable. No one would bother you. Also there are cameras everywhere. It makes me feel safe to be in there as an Asian woman.” [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{and your}} ghosts!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> there, {{thinking}} like an owl, you'd better try {{and think of}} some of your funny stories for to-night. You'll have to sit next that stuck-up Mrs. Bomford, and she takes a bit of amusing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{really are}} a queer person," [...] she declared. [...] "You have been playing golf this morning as though your very life {{depended}} upon it. You have scarcely missed a shot or spoken a word. And now, all of a sudden, <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> on a sand hummock and watch the tide." ...|$|E
60|$|I don't want {{to bother}} about {{describing}} to you his appearance; but, {{if you are a}} man reader, I will say that Stickncy looked precisely like the young chap that you always find sitting in your chair smoking a cigarette after you have missed a shot while playing pool--not billiards but pool--when <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> down yourself.|$|E
6000|$|... "If you please, Mr. Andrew," [...] she begged, [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> by me {{and tell}} me how you came to live in so strange a place. Do you really not mind the solitude?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Winston flung two {{bundles of}} straw {{down beside the}} stove, and stood looking at her gravely. [...] "Yes," [...] he said. [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> down and let me wrap this sleigh robe about you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> {{down here}} quietly {{and open the}} envelope," [...] he said, {{switching}} on the electric lamp. [...] "That is what he told you to do, isn't it? There may be a message for you inside." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There, lad! Now, if {{you feel}} at all tired or shaky, all {{you have got to}} do is to hook this on to one of the steps. Do you see? One hook {{on each side of the}} cord. That way you can rest as long as you like, and then go on again. You say you can go down a rope with your hands only. I should advise you to do that, if you can, and not to use your legs unless <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> down on one of the long steps; for, as you know, if you use your feet the rope will go in till they are almost level with your head; while, if you use your arms only, it will hang {{straight}} down." ...|$|E
6000|$|I might {{answer to}} this; Well, what else should he do? If {{you want to}} feel as if you were in a shower, cannot you go and get wet without help from Constable? If you want {{to feel as if}} you were walking in the fields, cannot you go and walk in them without help from De Wint? But if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> in your room and look at a {{beautiful}} picture, why should you blame the artist for giving you one? This was the answer actually made to me by various journalists, when first I showed that Turner was truer than other painters: [...] "Nay," [...] said they, [...] "we do not want truth, we want something else than truth; we would not have nature, but something better than nature." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{had had a}} sort of vague idea, don't you know, that if I stuck {{close to}} Motty and went about the place with him, I might act as a bit of a damper on the gaiety. What I mean is, I thought that if, when he was being the life and soul of the party, he were to catch my reproving eye he might ease up a trifle on the revelry. So the next night I took him along to supper with me. It was the last time. I'm a quiet, {{peaceful}} sort of chappie who has lived all his life in London, and I can't stand the pace these swift sportsmen from the rural districts set. What I mean to say is this, I'm all for rational enjoyment and so forth, but I think a chappie makes himself conspicuous when he throws soft-boiled eggs at the electric fan. And decent mirth and all that sort of thing are all right, but I do bar dancing on tables and having to dash all over the place dodging waiters, managers, and chuckers-out, just when <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> still and digest.|$|E
6000|$|... "Who says {{steak and}} kidney pie?" [...] bawled Mr. Voules. [...] "Who says steak and kidney pie? You 'ave {{a drop of}} old Tommy, Martha. That's what <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> steady <b>you....</b> <b>Sit</b> down {{everyone}} and don't all speak at once. Who says steak and kidney pie?..." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{shall never}} dream of turning you away; I shall cherish you till the latest {{possible}} hour. I'm {{only trying to}} keep myself {{in tune with the}} logic of things. The proof of how I cling is that precisely I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>to</b> me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps I am, dear," [...] he confessed. [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> just <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> up {{and lose}} that unnatural look. I am not really full of cheap bravado, but I am a philosopher. Something has {{happened}} to postpone--the end. Good luck to it, I say!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then the raw {{material}} is handed over to a cook. He is a common soldier who has been made into a cook by a simple ceremony. He is told, 'You are a cook.' He does his best to be. Usually he roasts or bakes to begin with, guessing when the joint is done, afterwards he hacks up {{what is left of}} his joints and makes a stew for next day. A stew is hacked meat boiled up in a big pot. It has much fat floating on the top. After you have eaten your fill <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> about quiet. The men are fed usually in a large tent or barn. We have a barn. It is not a clean barn, and just to make it more like a picnic there are insufficient plates, knives and forks. (I tell you, no army people can count beyond eight or ten.) The corporals after their morning's work have to carve. When they have done carving they tell me they feel they have had enough dinner. They sit about looking pale, and wander off afterwards to the village pub. (I shall probably become a corporal soon.) In these islands before the war began there was a surplus of women over men of about a million. (See the publications of the Fabian Society, now so popular among the young.) None of these women have been trusted by the government with the difficult task of cooking and giving out food to our soldiers. No man of the ordinary soldier class ever cooks anything until he is a soldier.... All food left over after the stew or otherwise rendered uneatable by the cook is thrown away. We throw away pail-loads. We bury meat....|$|E
5000|$|Cattrall later recalled, [...] "There's {{no way to}} play a {{mannequin}} except if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> there as a dummy... I {{did a lot of}} body-building because I wanted to be as streamlined as possible. I wanted to match the mannequins as closely as I could." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{high altitudes}} of Everest {{can have a}} {{dramatic}} effect on the human body. One climber who summited Everest in 2016 described his coming back down this way: Words can't describe how tired you feel. You want to do one thing, <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> down (and) go to sleep, and yet from {{all the things you}} have read, your experience and the lessons you've learned from others' mistakes, if you sit down and rest for a long time you are never getting up again. Especially if you should fall asleep. You'll just never wake up. Robert Kay ...|$|E
5000|$|Julaybib, {{the one who}} {{had spent}} a {{lifetime}} in despair, had now found a loving wife. But he replied to his father in law's request and said, [...] " [...] 'O my father you say a strange thing, my Beloved Prophet is in the battlefield facing the enemies of Islam and <b>you</b> <b>want</b> me <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> at home with my wife, nay I will sacrifice my blood and my soul rather than see my Prophet facing hardship while I sit at home in luxury".|$|R
6000|$|Lane did {{not watch}} the dancers this time. Again Bessy Bell refused {{to get up}} from the lounge. The youth was insistent. He pawed at her. And manifestly {{she did not like}} that, for her face flamed, and she snapped: [...] "Stop it--you bonehead! Can't <b>you</b> see I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> here by Mr. Lane?" ...|$|R
5000|$|In your {{relationship}} as {{husband and wife}} do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> just <b>sit</b> and look at one another and smile? Or would you rather have a love relationship that is so tight, so sweet, so strong that you would become totally one like a rubber ball, and roll around together? Once you become totally one and begin rolling together like a round ball, when you roll too fast you will shout and scream and God will hear you and come down and enjoy watching you. Interesting? Exciting? Sun Myung Moon, from The Palace of True Love ...|$|R

50|$|Within sociology, {{sociometry}} has {{two main}} branches: research sociometry, and applied sociometry. Research sociometry is action research with groups exploring the socio-emotional networks of relationships using specified criteria e.g. Who {{in this group}} do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> beside you at work? Who in the group {{do you go to}} for advice on a work problem? Who in the group do you see providing satisfying leadership in the pending project? Sometimes called network explorations, research sociometry is concerned with relational patterns in small (individual and small group) and larger populations, such as organizations and neighborhoods. Applied sociometrists utilize a range of methods to assist people and groups review, expand and develop their existing psycho-social networks of relationships. Both fields of sociometry exist to produce through their application, greater spontaneity and creativity of both individuals and groups.|$|E
5000|$|Kenneth Copeland and his wife, Gloria Copeland, were {{featured}} in a 2015 episode of Last Week Tonight with John Oliver that gained media attention. Comedian John Oliver criticized the Copelands for using tax laws {{to live in a}} $6.3 million mansion as the parsonage allowance for their home is not subject to income taxes, for using church donations to buy a $20 million jet that was used for trips to a ski resort and a private game ranch, and for promotion of healing through faith and skepticism of medicine, which Oliver highlighted with a video of Gloria Copeland saying that doctors give patients [...] "poison that will make you sicker" [...] and that the church is an alternative to medical treatment: [...] "Which do you want to do? Do you want to do that," [...] Copeland asked of the doctor's [...] "poison" [...] treatment, [...] "or do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> here on a Saturday morning, hear the word of God, and let faith come into your heart and be healed?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{glad she}} thinks so then--though really her {{interests}} are so various. But {{come to my}} baby. I don't make HER come," [...] she explained as she swept him along, [...] "because I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> just <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> down by her there and keep the place, as one may say--!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{may sound}} very foolish," [...] he said, {{with a faint}} smile, [...] "but I have a fancy, and I am sure that you will do as I ask. I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> where she sat night after night. You will find some flowers in her chair. Keep them. They were the ones she preferred." ...|$|R
