6000|$|... "Then get up {{and ride}} for the settlement. Mail an order for some harness or {{anything}} useful to Regina by the night train, when you get there; <b>you</b> <b>can</b> let Svendsen have the bill.

6000|$|He {{glanced at}} Lincoln again. [...] "I know now what <b>you</b> think--I <b>can</b> <b>guess</b> {{something}} {{of what you}} mean to do. Even now {{it is not too}} late to warn you.
