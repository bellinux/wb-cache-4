6000|$|There is a {{ponderous}} old two-handed sword kept here, said to {{have belonged}} to Sir William Wallace.

And when you've got it, you want--oh, you don't quite know what it is you DO want, but it just fairly makes your heart ache, you want it so! It seems to you that mainly what you want is to get away; get away from the same old tedious things you're so used to seeing and so tired of, and set {{something}} new. That is the idea; you want to go and be a wanderer; you want to go wandering far away to strange countries where everything is mysterious and wonderful and romantic. And if you can't do that, you'll put up with considerable less; you'll go anywhere you CAN go, just so as to get away, and be thankful of the chance, too.|$|E

60|$|We came to Sidmouth for two months, {{and you see}} we {{are here}} still; and when {{we are likely to}} go is as {{uncertain}} as ever. I like the place, and some of its inhabitants. I like the greenness and the tranquillity and the sea; and the solitude of one dear seat which hangs over it, and which is too far or too lonely for many others to like besides myself. We are living in a thatched cottage, with a green lawn bounded by a Devonshire lane. Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> <b>is?</b> Milton did when he wrote of 'hedgerow elms and hillocks green.' Indeed Sidmouth is a nest among elms; and the lulling of the sea and the shadow of the hills make it a peaceful one. But there are no majestic features in the country. It is all green and fresh and secluded; and the grandeur is concentrated upon the ocean without deigning {{to have anything to do}} with the earth. I often find my thoughts where my footsteps once used to be! but there is no use in speaking of that....|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{know what}} you mean,' said Christopher, hastily anticipating all {{that she might be}} going to say; 'and I am glad you have given me the {{opportunity}} of speaking upon that subject. It has been very good and considerate in you to allow me to share your society so frequently as you have done since I have been in town, and to think of you as an object to exist for and strive for. But I ought to have remembered that, since you have nobody at your side to look after your interests, it behoved me to be doubly careful. In short, Ethelberta, I am {{not in a position to}} marry, nor can I discern when I shall be, and I feel it would be an injustice to ask you to be bound in any way to one lower and less talented than you. You cannot, from what you say, think it desirable that the engagement should continue. I have no right to ask you to be my betrothed, without having a near prospect of making you my wife. I don't mind saying this straight out--I have no fear that you will doubt my love; thank Heaven, <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> well enough! However, as things are, I wish you to know that I cannot conscientiously put in a claim upon your attention.' ...|$|E

60|$|L. A {{little of}} {{everything}} there's always flint and clay, and magnesia in it, {{and the black}} is iron, according to its fancy, and there's boracic acid if <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> and if you don't, I cannot tell you today, and it doesn't signify and there's potash, and soda, and, on the whole, the chemistry of it {{is more like a}} mediaeval doctor's prescription, than the making of a respectable mineral but it may, perhaps, be owing to the strange complexity of its make, that it has a notable habit which makes it, to me {{one of the most interesting}} of minerals. You see these two crystals are broken right across, in many places, just as if they had been shafts of black marble fallen from a ruinous temple, and here they lie, imbedded in white quartz, fragment succeeding fragment keeping the line of the original crystal, while the quartz fills up the intervening spaces Now tourmaline has a trick of doing this, more than any other mineral I know here is another bit which I picked up on the glacier of Macugnaga; it is broken, like a pillar built of very flat broad stones, into about thirty joints, and all these are heaved and warped away from each other sideways, almost into a line of steps, and then all is tilled up with quartz paste. And here, lastly is a green Indian piece, in which the pillar is first disjointed, and then wrung round into the shape of an S.|$|E
6000|$|... 21.--We {{have had}} a great alarm. Last evening {{we went to the}} parish church; Horace Druce had been asked to preach, and the rain, which had fallen all the morning, cleared off {{just in time for the}} walk. Emily, Margaret, two of her children, and I sat in the gallery, and Avice and Isa in the free seats below. Avice had been kept at home by the rain in the morning, but had begged leave to go later. Darkness came on just as the first hymn was given out, and the verger went round with his long wand {{lighting}} the gas. In the gallery we saw plainly how, at the east end, something went wrong with his match, one which he thought had failed, and threw aside. It fell on a strip of straw matting in the aisle, which, being very dry, caught fire and blazed up for a few seconds before it was trampled out. Some foolish person, however, set the cry of 'Fire!' going, and <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> in a crowded church. The vicar, in his high old-fashioned desk with a back to it, could not see. Horace in a chair, in the narrow, shallow sanctuary, did see that it was nothing, but between the cries of 'Fire!' and the dying peal of the organ, could not make his voice heard. All he could do was to get to the rear of the crowd, together with the other few who had seen the real state of things, and turn back all those whom they could, getting them out through the vestry. But the main body were quite out of their reach, and everybody tried to rush scrambling into the narrow centre aisle, choking up the door, which was a complicated trap meant to keep out draughts. We in the gallery tried vainly to assure them that the only danger was in the crowd, and the clergyman in his desk, sure that was the chief peril, at any rate, went on waving and calling to them to wait; but the cries and shrieks drowned everything, and there was a most terrible time, as some 600 people jammed themselves in that narrow space, fighting, struggling, fainting.|$|E
6000|$|LANCASTER bore him--such {{a little}} town, [...] Such a great man. It doesn't see him often [...] Of late years, though {{he keeps the}} old {{homestead}} [...] And sends the children down there with their mother [...] To run wild in the summer--a little wild. [...] Sometimes he joins them {{for a day or}} two [...] And sees old friends he somehow can't get near. [...] They meet him in the general store at night, [...] Pre-occupied with formidable mail, [...] Rifling a printed letter as he talks. [...] They seem afraid. He wouldn't have it so: [...] Though a great scholar, he's a democrat, [...] If not at heart, at least on principle. [...] Lately when coming up to Lancaster [...] His train being late he missed another train [...] And had four hours to wait at Woodsville Junction [...] After eleven o'clock at night. Too tired [...] To think of sitting such an ordeal out, [...] He turned to the hotel to find a bed. [...] "No room," [...] the night clerk said. [...] "Unless----" [...] Woodsville's a place of shrieks and wandering lamps [...] And cars that shook and rattle--and one hotel. [...] "You say 'unless.'" [...] "Unless you wouldn't mind [...] Sharing a room with someone else." [...] "Who is it?" [...] "A man." [...] "So I should hope. What kind of man?" [...] "I know him: he's all right. A man's a man. [...] Separate beds of course you understand." [...] The night clerk blinked his eyes and dared him on. [...] "Who's that man sleeping in the office chair? [...] Has he had the refusal of my chance?" [...] "He was afraid of being robbed or murdered. [...] What do you say?" [...] "I'll have to have a bed." [...] The night clerk led him up three flights of stairs [...] And down a narrow passage full of doors, [...] At the last one of which he knocked and entered. [...] "Lafe, here's a fellow wants to share your room." [...] "Show him this way. I'm not afraid of him. [...] I'm not so drunk I can't take care of myself." [...] The night clerk clapped a bedstead on the foot. [...] "This will be yours. Good-night," [...] he said, and went. [...] "Lafe was the name, I think?" [...] "Yes, Layfayette. [...] You got it the first time. And yours?" [...] "Magoon. [...] Doctor Magoon." [...] "A Doctor?" [...] "Well, a teacher." [...] "Professor Square-the-circle-till-you're-tired? [...] Hold on, there's something I don't think of now [...] That I had on my mind to ask the first [...] Man that knew anything I happened in with. [...] I'll ask you later--don't let me forget it." [...] The Doctor looked at Lafe and looked away. [...] A man? A brute. Naked above the waist, [...] He sat there creased and shining in the light, [...] Fumbling the buttons in a well-starched shirt. [...] "I'm moving into a size-larger shirt. [...] I've felt mean lately; mean's no name for it. [...] I just found what the matter was to-night: [...] I've been a-choking like a nursery tree [...] When it outgrows the wire band of its name tag. [...] I blamed it on the hot spell we've been having. [...] 'Twas nothing but my foolish hanging back, [...] Not liking to own up I'd grown a size. [...] Number eighteen this is. What size do you wear?" [...] The Doctor caught his throat convulsively. [...] "Oh--ah--fourteen--fourteen." [...] "Fourteen! You say so! [...] I can remember when I wore fourteen. [...] And come to think I must have back at home [...] More than a hundred collars, size fourteen. [...] Too bad to waste them all. You ought to have them. [...] They're yours and welcome; let me send them to you. [...] What makes you stand there on one leg like that? [...] You're not much furtherer than where Kike left you. [...] You act as if you wished you hadn't come. [...] Sit down or lie down, friend; you make me nervous." [...] The Doctor made a subdued dash for it, [...] And propped himself at bay against a pillow. [...] "Not that way, with your shoes on Kike's white bed. [...] You can't rest that way. Let me pull your shoes off." [...] "Don't touch me, please--I say, don't touch me, please. [...] I'll not be put to bed by you, my man." [...] "Just as you say. Have it your own way then. [...] 'My man' is it? You talk like a professor. [...] Speaking of who's afraid of who, however, [...] I'm thinking I have more to lose than you [...] If anything should happen to be wrong. [...] Who wants to cut your number fourteen throat! [...] Let's have a show down as an evidence [...] Of good faith. There is ninety dollars. [...] Come, if you're not afraid." [...] "I'm not afraid. [...] There's five: that's all I carry." [...] "I can search you? [...] Where are you moving over to? Stay still. [...] You'd better tuck your money under you [...] And sleep on it the way I always do [...] When I'm with people I don't trust at night." [...] "Will you believe me if I put it there [...] Right on the counterpane--that I do trust you?" [...] "You'd say so, Mister Man.--I'm a collector. [...] My ninety isn't mine--you won't think that. [...] I pick it up a dollar at a time [...] All round the country for the Weekly News, [...] Published in Bow. You know the Weekly News?" [...] "Known it since I was young." [...] "Then you know me. [...] Now we are getting on together--talking. [...] I'm sort of Something for it at the front. [...] My business is to find what people want: [...] They pay for it, and so they ought to have it. [...] Fairbanks, he says to me--he's editor-- [...] Feel out the public sentiment--he says. [...] A good deal comes on me when all is said. [...] The only trouble is we disagree [...] In politics: I'm Vermont Democrat-- [...] <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> <b>is,</b> sort of double-dyed; [...] The News has always been Republican. [...] Fairbanks, he says to me, 'Help us this year,' [...] Meaning by us their ticket. 'No,' I says, [...] 'I can't and won't. You've been in long enough: [...] It's time you turned around and boosted us. [...] You'll have to pay me more than ten a week [...] If I'm expected to elect Bill Taft. [...] I doubt if I could do it anyway.'" [...] "You seem to shape the paper's policy." [...] "You see I'm in with everybody, know 'em all. [...] I almost know their farms as well as they do." [...] "You drive around? It must be pleasant work." [...] "It's business, but I can't say it's not fun. [...] What I like best's the lay of different farms, [...] Coming out on them from a stretch of woods, [...] Or over a hill or round a sudden corner. [...] I like to find folks getting out in spring, [...] Raking the dooryard, working near the house. [...] Later they get out further in the fields. [...] Everything's shut sometimes except the barn; [...] The family's all away in some back meadow. [...] There's a hay load a-coming--when it comes. [...] And later still they all get driven in: [...] The fields are stripped to lawn, the garden patches [...] Stripped to bare ground, the apple trees [...] To whips and poles. There's nobody about. [...] The chimney, though, keeps up a good brisk smoking. [...] And I lie back and ride. I take the reins [...] Only when someone's coming, and the mare [...] Stops when she likes: I tell her when to go. [...] I've spoiled Jemima in more ways than one. [...] She's got so she turns in at every house [...] As if she had some sort of curvature, [...] No matter if I have no errand there. [...] She thinks I'm sociable. I maybe am. [...] It's seldom I get down except for meals, though. [...] Folks entertain me from the kitchen doorstep, [...] All in a family row down to the youngest." [...] "One would suppose they might not be as glad [...] To see you as you are to see them." [...] "Oh, [...] Because I want their dollar. I don't want [...] Anything they've not got. I never dun. [...] I'm there, and they can pay me if they like. [...] I go nowhere on purpose: I happen by. [...] Sorry there is no cup to give you a drink. [...] I drink out of the bottle--not your style. [...] Mayn't I offer you----?" [...] "No, no, no, thank you." [...] "Just as you say. Here's looking at you then.-- [...] And now I'm leaving you a little while. [...] You'll rest easier when I'm gone, perhaps-- [...] Lie down--let yourself go and get some sleep. [...] But first--let's see--what was I going to ask you? [...] Those collars--who shall I address them to, [...] Suppose you aren't awake when I come back?" [...] "Really, friend, I can't let you. You--may need them." [...] "Not till I shrink, when they'll be out of style." [...] "But really I--I have so many collars." [...] "I don't know who I rather would have have them. [...] They're only turning yellow where they are. [...] But you're the doctor as the saying is. [...] I'll put the light out. Don't you wait for me: [...] I've just begun the night. You get some sleep. [...] I'll knock so-fashion and peep round the door [...] When I come back so you'll know who it is. [...] There's nothing I'm afraid of like scared people. [...] I don't want you should shoot me in the head. [...] What am I doing carrying off this bottle? [...] There now, you get some sleep." [...] He shut the door. [...] The Doctor slid a little down the pillow.|$|E
