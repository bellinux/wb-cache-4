25|$|The Clive Davis's pre-Grammy {{party that}} Houston was {{expected}} to attend, which featured many {{of the biggest names}} in music and movies, went on as scheduled although it was quickly turned into a tribute to Houston. Davis spoke about Houston's death at the evening's start: By now <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> learned of the unspeakably tragic news of our beloved Whitney's passing. I don't have to mask my emotion in front of a room full of so many dear friends. I am personally devastated by the loss of someone who has meant so much to me for so many years. Whitney was so full of life. She was so looking forward to tonight even though she wasn't scheduled to perform. Whitney was a beautiful person and a talent beyond compare. She graced this stage with her regal presence and gave so many memorable performances here over the years. Simply put, Whitney would have wanted the music to go on and her family asked that we carry on.|$|E

And usually women feel stupid and silly and they blame themselves 'cause <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> the signs most of the time, but you love the guy so you don't {{want to see them}} go.

500|$|Musician and filmmaker Rob Zombie observes, [...] "Most of {{the kids}} who come to my shows seem like really imaginative kids with a lot of {{creative}} energy they don't know what to do with" [...] and that metal is [...] "outsider music for outsiders. Nobody wants to be the weird kid; you just somehow end up being the weird kid. It's kind of like that, but with metal <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> the weird kids in one place". Scholars of metal have noted the tendency of fans to classify and reject some performers (and some other fans) as [...] "poseurs" [...] "who pretended {{to be part of the}} subculture, but who were deemed to lack authenticity and sincerity".|$|E

500|$|In September 2015, Tancharoen {{stated the}} overall {{theme for the}} season {{explored}} with each character was them [...] "trying {{to get back in}} touch with their humanity in a world where Inhumans are popping up," [...] with Whedon adding that the nature of couples–some having broken up in previous episodes, some getting back together, and potential for new ones–would be explored. Later that month, Bell talked about some of the new character pairings in the season, saying [...] "Putting Mack and Daisy together; putting Hunter and May together; putting Bobbi and Fitz together—suddenly <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> these different dynamics, all these different stories that you didn't have before." [...] Tancharoen later highlighted the number of characters in the season compared to previous, stating that [...] "There's more scale and scope, but at the same time, I think we're diving into each character's internal struggle a little bit more." ...|$|E
500|$|Also in 2014, Michael Stevens of the YouTube channel Vsauce devoted {{time to the}} {{discussion}} of irony in the episode [...] "Dord". In this video, Stevens considers {{the difference between the}} typically cited [...] "situational" [...] irony, versus [...] "dramatic" [...] irony. According to him, the irony of the song may not necessarily be in the situations themselves, but rather in the dramatic irony – when someone is unaware of the significance of the event while others are. The situations aren't ironic themselves, but life itself is ironic. It is a song about [...] "the difference between what life knows we need, and what life thinks we need. What's ironic is not 10,000 spoons when {{all you need is a}} knife, it's the fact that, as Alanis believes, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> of those spoons because, unbeknownst to you, but known by life, what you really need right now is only spoons... or the last thing you need right now is a knife." ...|$|E

500|$|Their debut EP, How Am I Supposed to Kill You If <b>You</b> <b>Have</b> <b>All</b> the Guns?, Recorded by Lee Boylan and {{released}} by Irish indie label FIFA Records in early 2007, sold out and generated {{a significant amount}} of interest in the media and in the Irish blogging community in the process. In May 2007, Fight Like Apes won Phantom FM's Topman Unsigned Band Search; their prize was to be a support act of The Holloways at show in Dublin. Fight Like Apes played both Electric Picnic (their first major Irish festival) and Hard Working Class Heroes in 2007 and also performed at the CMJ Music Marathon in New York City. They were also chosen to play the Futureshock stage at EXIT in Serbia after sending a demo of their songs to the organisers. On 13 October 2007, Fight Like Apes performed [...] "Jake Summers" [...] on television chat show, Tubridy Tonight.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} Tom Haverford also undergoes {{changes during}} the final episodes of the season, in which the character begins to consider leaving his city hall position to pursue his own business ambitions. The storyline is advanced particularly strongly in [...] "The Bubble", when Tom becomes frustrated with an assignment by Chris, and culminates in the season finale [...] "Li'l Sebastian", in which he ultimately quits the parks department to form an entertainment company. [...] "Li'l Sebastian" [...] ends with several cliffhanger twists including Tom's departure from city hall, Leslie being approached to run for office, {{and the arrival of}} Ron's first ex-wife Tammy, although the actress who will play her was not revealed. Schur said the writing staff had a general idea of where the newly introduced storylines should go, but the exact stories had not been completely worked out yet when the episodes broadcast. Schur said they sought to [...] "write the juiciest, most exciting cliffhanger-y possible scenario you can write, and then <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> summer {{to figure out how to}} get yourself out of it".|$|E
500|$|The final {{few minutes}} of [...] "Li'l Sebastian" [...] {{introduced}} major developments for several of the characters, including Leslie being approached with the idea to run for elected office, {{which has been a}} lifelong dream for her. Additionally, Tom decides to leave city hall to pursue his entrepreneurial ambitions, a progression of his character that had been building throughout the third season. Series co-creator Michael Schur said he believes characters should change and their situations should change throughout the season, so he wanted them to be in a very different place {{at the end of the}} season than where they were from the beginning. Schur also described his fellow co-creator Greg Daniels' theory about finale episode as: [...] "write the juiciest, most exciting cliffhanger-y possible scenario you can write, and then <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> summer to figure out how to get yourself out of it". Although Schur said the writing staff had a general idea of where the newly introduced storylines should go, the exact stories had not been completely worked out yet and the writers would be brainstorming how to handle them over the summer.|$|E

500|$|The rivalry, {{which is}} the oldest in the sport, is fueled by history, competitiveness, and {{cultural}} implication. Both schools {{are located in the}} state of Maryland, a historical hotbed for lacrosse, and have traditionally been two of the sport's powerhouses. Many of the opposing players have had past associations in grade school, high school, or youth club sports. Hopkins' current coach and former player Dave Pietramala said, [...] "Everybody knew each other; we had all played together at some point or another. It was a fierce, intense game and there was no love lost on the field." [...] Additionally, Johns Hopkins is a private university, while Maryland is a public institution. Former Terrapins coach Dick Edell said:"To get the juices flowing before the game, [...] kids that it was the blue-collar guys against the future executives—that this was their only chance to get them before they got into the real world. Plus, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> the kids who came from the same high school, or worked the camps together, so there was that closeness that you have to live with for the other 364 days, no matter who wins." ...|$|E
500|$|Starting with Madonna's voice multi-tracked {{questioning}} – [...] "Am I gonna be a star?", [...] "Should I {{change my}} name?"

She also questions the shallowness of modern life and the [...] "American dream." [...] "I know it sounds clichéd," [...] she admitted. [...] "But I've had 20 years of fame and fortune, and I feel that I {{have the right to}} an opinion on what it is and isn't. All everyone is obsessed about now is being a celebrity.

Before it happens, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> kinds of notions about how wonderful celebrity is and how much joy it's going to bring you. Then you arrive... In America, more than any other place in the world, you have the freedom to be anything you want to be. Which is all well and good, but it only works if you have a value system – and we seem not to have one anymore. It's, 'Whatever it takes to get to the top, that's what you gotta do.' It's the allure of the beautiful life: 'Look like this, you're gonna be happy. Drive this car, you're gonna be popular. Wear these clothes and people are gonna want to fuck you.' It's a very powerful illusion and people are caught up in it, including myself. Or I was." ...|$|E
500|$|Owing to the {{combination}} of Pink Floyd's partial breakup and Waters' dominance on the project, The Final Cut is sometimes viewed as a de facto Waters solo album. [...] The personal quality assigned to the lyrics are related to Waters' struggle to reconcile his despair at the changing social face of Britain, and also {{the loss of his}} father during the Second World War. [...] Gilmour's guitar solos on [...] "Your Possible Pasts" [...] and [...] "The Fletcher Memorial Home" [...] are, however, sometimes considered the equal of his best work on The Wall. [...] More recent reviews of the album have weighed its importance alongside the band's breakup. [...] Writing for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine said [...] "with its anger, emphasis on lyrics, and sonic textures, it's clear that it's the album that Waters intended it to be. [...] And it's equally clear that Pink Floyd couldn't have continued in this direction...", [...] Stylus Magazine wrote: [...] "It's about pursuing something greater even when <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> the money that you could ever want. [...] And either failing or succeeding brilliantly. [...] It's up to you to decide whether this record is a success or a failure, but I'd go with the former every time." [...] Rachel Mann of The Quietus said [...] "flawed though it is, The Final Cut remains a tremendous album" [...] and [...] "still has something fresh to say". [...] Mike Diver of Drowned in Sound was less generous: [...] "Rays of light are few and far between, and even on paper the track titles – including 'The Gunner's Dream' and 'Paranoid Eyes' – suggest an arduous listen. [...] Q Magazine once compiled a top ten list of depressing records, and this was on it. [...] Enough said, I think." ...|$|E

2500|$|Parsimony {{methods are}} {{intuitively}} appealing and highly efficient, {{such that they}} are still used in some cases to seed maximum likelihood optimization algorithms with an initial phylogeny. However, the underlying assumption that evolution attained a certain end result as fast as possible is inaccurate. Natural selection and evolution do not work towards a goal, they simply select for or against randomly occurring genetic changes. Parsimony methods impose six general assumptions: that the phylogenetic tree you are using is correct, that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> of the relevant data, in which no mistakes were made in coding, that all branches of the phylogenetic tree are equally likely to change, that the rate of evolution is slow, and that the chance of losing or gaining a characteristic is the same.
