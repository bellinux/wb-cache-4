40|$|First and foremost, I {{would like}} to thank my thesis advisor, Melinda Plastas. Thank you for your endless patience, {{guidance}} and support this year. Thank you for giving me the encouragement I needed to keep going when it seemed like I had hit a dead end. Thank you for reading, and re-reading my many drafts and responding to my frequent late-night emails with calm positivity and wise, helpful words. This thesis could not be what it is today without your help. I {{would also like to thank}} Chris Schiff. Your jolly attitude and remarkable skills as a research librarian and citation expert helped to relieve much of my stress and anxiety throughout this project. I would also like to thank my parents, for making it possible for me to attend Bates College. Without your loving support I would never have had this remarkable opportunity. Thank you for the many encouraging emails and positive, supportive phone calls and texts, I love <b>you</b> <b>both</b> <b>so</b> <b>much.</b> I would also like to thank both of my brothers for being endlessly available to hear my complaints and frustrations while also helping to remind me to enjoy college, as it does not last forever.

60|$|HOTCHKISS. Ah, youre {{quoting the}} Baptism service. Thats {{not a bit}} real, you know. If I may say <b>so,</b> <b>you</b> would <b>both</b> feel <b>so</b> <b>much</b> more at peace with yourselves if you would {{acknowledge}} and confess your real convictions. You know you dont really think a Bishop the equal of a curate, or a lieutenant in a line regiment the equal of a general.|$|R
40|$|Many {{people in}} many places mark my path. First, mom and dad, thank you. You brought me into this world and taught me to search for justice and love in the work I do and the {{relationships}} I build. We may not always see eye-to-eye on how this work is possible, but I know that my heart is born from both of yours. Thank you for everything you have done and continue to do for me as I walk into this new phase of life—as a husband and father. I love <b>you</b> <b>both</b> <b>so</b> <b>much.</b> Sis: I love you and your family. We may not talk often, and {{we see each other}} even less, but you are always in my heart and thoughts. To everyone in Kalia’s family, thank you, Ua Tsaug. My heart has grown in knowing you. Thank you for sharing your lives with mine. I have learned <b>so</b> <b>much.</b> Bic, Sonja, Tim, Thom, Walt—you all have been instrumental in my ability to allow my interests and ideas to shape my doctoral journey. To all of the other faculty and staff who {{have played a role in}} my journey, especially Misty, John W., Lynn, Nance, Peter, Alexs, Jerry, Michael, John C., Nan and Nan, each of you has in one way or another affected my perspective and helped me mature as a scholar and person. To everyone who agreed to be a part of my journey in this dissertation, thanks go to you as well. Even if you don’t show up here, our conversations were invaluable in me realizing what it was I was really doing (or trying to do) ...|$|R

Lady Breton exclaimed, drawing {{herself up}} with much dignity; 'how on earth you, who have always {{pretended to be}} a {{religious}} person, can utter such a shocking and wicked sentiment as that, really passes my comprehension. What {{in the world is}} religion for, I should like to know, if it isn't to teach us how to save our own souls? But the particular thing I want to speak to you about is just this: couldn't you manage to induce Ernest to see the Archdeacon a little, and let the Archdeacon speak to him about his deplorable spiritual condition? I thought about <b>you</b> <b>both</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> at church yesterday, when the dear Archdeacon was preaching such a beautiful sermon; his text was like this, as far as I can remember it. [...] "There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death." [...] I couldn't help thinking all the time of my own two poor rebellious boys, and of the path that their misguided notions were leading them on. For I believe Ernest does really somehow persuade himself that he's in the right--it's inconceivable, but it's the fact; and I'm afraid the end thereof will be the ways of death; and then, as the dear Archdeacon said, [...] "After death the judgment." [...] Oh, Ronald, when I think of your poor dear brother Ernest's open unbelief, it makes me tremble for his future, so that I couldn't rest upon my bed until I'd been to see you and urged you to go and try to save him.' ...|$|R

40|$|First and foremost, I want {{to thank}} {{my mom and dad}} for {{supporting}} me, both emotionally and financially, as I continued to embark on strengthening my educational career. Your quest to encourage me to continue my education has gotten me to the where I am today. The value <b>you</b> <b>both</b> place on education and how you continued to instill this value in me while growing up has provided me with a significant motivation to continue this journey. We have been through <b>so</b> <b>much,</b> but our strong, little family has not faltered as we continue to support and love one another unconditionally. Thank you for everything you have given me [...] . <b>you</b> are <b>both</b> truly an inspiration. I love <b>you</b> <b>both</b> <b>so</b> very <b>much.</b> To my sister, Megan. Although you are not physically here, I felt your support through your strong and ever-present spirit.

You embraced life for what it was worth and because of that, you have taught me to love, cherish, and value the short life we are given. I know that you are proud of my accomplishments. Thank you for always being there for me [...] . you will always be in my heart. I love you...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is dedicated}} to my parents, Marie and Harry Eller, and my sisters, Rhonda, Chrystal and Suzannah, who have always supported me. I {{would not have made}} it this far without them. Acknowledgements First and foremost, I would like to thank my supervisor, Jonathan Sessler. Thank you, Jon, for giving me a home in your group and hanging in there with me. I have learned <b>so</b> <b>much</b> from you over the years and I have loved being a part of the Sessler group. I must thank several previous members of the who provided support in my early graduate school career. Thank you to Chris Fowler for recruiting me into the Sessler group and for later training me in radiation techniques at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Fowler, I don’t think I ever told you how much I appreciated you, so I will do it now. Thank you. Rebecca Zimmerman and Sathiosatham Muhunthan {{and the members of the}} Chilly Chill Chill Lab made my early years both fun and rewarding. Thanks, guys. Anna and Piotr Piatek, <b>you</b> <b>both</b> helped me <b>so</b> <b>much</b> in the last year of my graduate training. Your wisdom and humor touched and strengthened me. Don’t thin...|$|R

6000|$|Miriam vaguely smiled. [...] "I know <b>you</b> <b>both</b> <b>so</b> little." [...] But she {{presented}} {{them with a}} great stately air to each other, {{and the two men}} shook hands while Madame Carré observed them.|$|R
25|$|After seven years, {{the two men}} {{started to}} fight again but both died from their wounds. But, Hilda loved <b>both</b> <b>so</b> <b>much,</b> <b>so</b> that she used spells to conjure up the dead each night, and so the battle went on and on.|$|R
6000|$|... "Master Sedley Archfield!" [...] {{said the}} Doctor; [...] "welcome home, sir! 'Tis {{a meeting of}} old acquaintance. You and this gentleman are <b>both</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> altered {{that it is no}} wonder if you do not {{recognise}} one another at once." ...|$|R
60|$|Well, it was printed, and she {{got three}} hundred dollars for it, {{likewise}} plenty of praise and blame, <b>both</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> greater than she expected that she was thrown {{into a state of}} bewilderment from which it took her some time to recover.|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{would it}} be, then," [...] I asked, [...] "but what {{you speak of}} as what I've 'found out'? The effort you {{distinguish}} in her is the effort of concealment--vain, as I gather it strikes <b>you</b> <b>both,</b> <b>so</b> far as I, in my supernatural acuteness, am concerned." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly. I'm glad to find <b>you</b> <b>both</b> <b>so</b> {{interested}} in it. Let me {{know about this}} mistake at lunch-time, Morton," [...] he added, smiling.

"She says," [...] {{proceeded}} Mr. Brewster, {{referring to}} the letter again, [...] "that they were <b>both</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> in love that they simply had to slip off and get married, and she hopes I won't be cross. Cross!" [...] gasped Mr. Brewster, gazing wildly at his friend.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] I repeated, with emphasis, [...] "'of all {{responsibility}} in the premises.' I hope that is plain English, and good English, although I know that Mr. Hardinge {{has been trying to}} make <b>you</b> <b>both</b> <b>so</b> simple in your language, that you turn up your noses at a profound sentiment, whenever you hear one." ...|$|R
50|$|Hydrogen (density 0.090 g/L at STP, average {{molecular}} mass 2.016 g/mol) and helium (density 0.179 g/L at STP, average {{molecular mass}} 4.003 g/mol) {{are the most}} commonly used lift gases. Although helium is twice as heavy as (diatomic) hydrogen, they are <b>both</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> lighter than air that this difference only results in hydrogen having 8% more buoyancy than helium.|$|R
60|$|I am, unhappily, off my style, and can {{do nothing}} well; indeed, I fear I have marred ROADS finally by {{patching}} at it when I {{was out of the}} humour.

60|$|Then {{she begged}} for her last communion, saying, 'I do pray for that poor Gregorio. Isn't that {{forgiving}} him?' And {{the attempt to}} exchange forgiveness with the Canon for their mutual behaviour {{at the time of}} her marriage overcame them <b>both</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> that they had to leave it not half uttered.

6000|$|... 'Ah, my sons, {{it is too}} feeling-full to see <b>you</b> <b>both</b> <b>so</b> {{happy and}} again in the old home. I haf no words to outpour my gratitude, and can only ask of the dear Gott in Himmel to bless and keep you all,' cried Professor Bhaer, trying to gather all four into his arms at once, while tears rolled down his cheeks, and his English failed him.|$|R
60|$|I am {{delighted to}} find <b>you</b> <b>both</b> <b>so</b> well {{pleased with the}} Blind Book scheme.[94] I said nothing of it to you when we were together, though I had made up my mind, because I wanted to come upon you with that little burst from a distance. It seemed {{something}} like meeting again when I remitted the money and thought of your talking of it.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh! I'm glad of that. I wish poor Mysie {{had done}} the same. I believe it was what Lady Merrifield intended, <b>you</b> <b>both</b> looked <b>so</b> knocked up.' ...|$|R

60|$|Then the invalid clergyman {{stood up}} and prayed, and read a chapter of God's Word, after which he preached--ay, preached {{in a way that}} drew tears from some, and hearty exclamations of thankfulness from others. It was not the power of rhetoric or of eloquence though he possessed <b>both,</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> as that mighty power, which {{consists}} in being thoroughly and intensely earnest in what one says, and in using a natural, conversational tone.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wonder it didn't {{come to your}} ears," [...] he said. [...] "It was the queerest thing. You {{remember}} that girl whom we <b>both</b> admired <b>so</b> <b>much</b> at the Academy?" ...|$|R

But I was so ignorant, and there was <b>so</b> <b>much</b> else, too, to distract. I shall never forget our {{first few months of}} travel--Paris, the Riviera, Italy. I was impressionable, too, and I loved it all so--the colour and the beauty, the rich, warm stream of life, after that wretched village school. I was so aching to understand, and you were such a good tutor. You fed my brain wonderfully. Oh, I suppose I ought to be content!" ...|$|R
60|$|A {{man and a}} woman {{were alone}} beside the marble basin, face to face, eye to eye, yet finding not one word to say. <b>Both</b> had <b>so</b> <b>much</b> to atone for, <b>so</b> <b>much</b> to forgive, that mere words were but the poor {{expression}} of all that filled their hearts.|$|R
