5|$|Hancock {{served in}} a number of {{assignments}} as an army quartermaster and adjutant, mostly in Fort Snelling, Minnesota and St. Louis, Missouri. It was in St. Louis that he met Almira ("Allie") Russell and they married on January 24, 1850. Allie gave birth to two children, Russell in 1850 and Ada in 1857, but both children died before their parents. Hancock was promoted to captain in 1855 and assigned to Fort Myers, Florida.

5|$|In 1886, Malone married Elinor Lucy (née Penn). The couple would {{eventually}} have five children, {{a daughter and}} four sons.

He was a member of the Hawera County Council as well as the Taranaki Hospital and Charitable Aid Board. From 1890, in addition to his farming, Malone also worked as a land agent. Later, he helped found the Stratford County Council and served as its first clerk and treasurer from 1891 to 1900.|$|E

50|$|Approximately {{one-fifth of}} all enlisted 18-year-olds and {{one-third of all}} junior {{personnel}} in the United States Army are married, compared to less than 5% of civilian 18-year-olds. As a result, <b>young</b> military <b>families</b> experience {{many of the same}} hardships that can accompany the start of a family in greater numbers than <b>young</b> civilian <b>families.</b> Like <b>young</b> civilian <b>families,</b> <b>young</b> military <b>families</b> may also experience maturity issues, life inexperience, low incomes, and living away from home. But these issues are {{compounded by the fact that}} <b>young</b> military <b>families</b> also experience special hardships not experienced by <b>young</b> civilian <b>families.</b> For example, while many <b>young</b> <b>families,</b> both military and civilian, often endure difficulties, civilian families are more likely to have the support of family and friends which is less likely to be an option for military families (e.g. on a military base stationed in a foreign country).|$|R

5|$|In 1848, Blaine {{was hired}} as a {{professor}} of mathematics and ancient languages at the Western Military Institute in Georgetown, Kentucky. Although he was only eighteen years old and younger than many of his students, Blaine adapted well to his new profession. Blaine grew to enjoy life in his adopted state and became an admirer of Kentucky Senator Henry Clay. He also made the acquaintance of Harriet Stanwood, a teacher at the nearby Millersburg Female College and native of Maine. On June 30, 1850, the two were married. Blaine once again considered taking up the study of law, but instead took his new bride to visit his family in Pennsylvania. They next lived with Harriet Blaine’s family in Augusta, Maine for several months, where their first child, Stanwood Blaine, was born in 1851. The <b>young</b> <b>family</b> soon moved again, this time to Philadelphia where Blaine took a job at the Pennsylvania Institution for the Instruction of the Blind (now Overbrook School for the Blind) in 1852, teaching science and literature.|$|E
5|$|Like her mother, Ellen Ewing Sherman was {{a devout}} Roman Catholic, and the Shermans' eight {{children}} were reared in that faith. In 1864, Ellen took up temporary residence in South Bend, Indiana, {{to have her}} <b>young</b> <b>family</b> educated at the University of Notre Dame and St. Mary's College. In 1874, with Sherman having become world-famous, their eldest child, Marie Ewing ("Minnie") Sherman, also had a politically prominent wedding, attended by President Ulysses S. Grant and commemorated by a generous gift from the Khedive of Egypt. (Eventually, one of Minnie's daughters married a grandson of Confederate general Lewis Addison Armistead.) Another of the Sherman daughters, Eleanor, was married to Alexander Montgomery Thackara at General Sherman's home in Washington, D.C., on May 5, 1880. To Sherman's great displeasure and sorrow, his oldest surviving son, Thomas Ewing Sherman, joined the religious order of the Jesuits in 1878 and was ordained as a priest in 1889.|$|E
