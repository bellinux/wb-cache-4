6000|$|... "I'm {{going to}} ask <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>questions,</b> Anderson, and I want you to answer me straight, too. If I learn you've given it to me crooked, I'll fix you for it, {{remember}} that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is not so}} easy," [...] {{said the}} Doctor, smiling. [...] "You will have {{gathered}} from my letter that I wish to ask <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>questions,</b> {{and you may not}} find it very comfortable to answer them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will now}} ask <b>thee</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>questions,</b> old man," [...] said the General, {{when they had}} arrived in the room; [...] "and I warn thee, that hope of pardon for thy many and persevering efforts against the Commonwealth, can be no {{otherwise}} merited than by the most direct answers to the questions I am about to ask." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do not {{understand}} you," [...] said Bradley; [...] "and now suppose <b>you</b> answer <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>questions.</b> Who are <b>you?</b> What country is this? Why did you bring me here?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hearing {{that the}} man who took Ticonderoga was here in Pendennis Castle, I've ridden twenty-five miles to see him; and to-morrow my brother will ride forty for the same purpose. So let me have first look. Sir," [...] he continued, {{addressing}} the captive, [...] "will you let me ask <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> plain <b>questions,</b> and be free with you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When I am sane, I am very sane; that I admit," [...] M. de Bellegarde answered. [...] "But I didn't {{come here}} to talk about myself. I should like to ask <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>questions.</b> You allow me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have come}} over, sir," [...] the man continued, [...] "according to {{instructions}} received {{by telephone from}} Scotland Yard. My business is to ask <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>questions</b> concerning {{the disappearance of the}} Honourable Anthony Palliser, who was, I am given to understand, your secretary." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That'll do," [...] he said. [...] "I'll {{take care}} of you for a time, young lady, and I'll ask <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>questions</b> later on. My men are searching the house. You and I will be getting on, if you can tear {{yourself}} away." ...|$|E
6000|$|Old Mother Nature {{waited until}} he had {{finished}} his feast. [...] "Now then, Billy," [...] said she, [...] "I want <b>you</b> to answer <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>questions.</b> Which do <b>you</b> like best, night or day?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't praise me!" [...] he exclaimed, hastily. [...] "Only help me.... Mary, will <b>you</b> answer <b>a</b> <b>few</b> little <b>questions,</b> if I {{swear by}} my honor I'll never reveal {{what you tell}} me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Coulson," [...] the Inspector said, [...] "I am visiting you {{on behalf}} of Scotland Yard. We {{understand}} that you had some acquaintance with Mr. Hamilton Fynes, {{and we hope that}} <b>you</b> will answer <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>questions</b> for us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! ah! I'm glad you're come, Mr Gazebee; very glad," [...] said Sir Louis; acting {{the part}} of the rich, great man with all the power he had. [...] "I want to ask <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>questions</b> so as to make it all clear sailing between us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} {{instructed}} to call and ask <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>questions</b> with reference to your journey from Accreton on February 10th last," [...] he continued. [...] "I am sorry to trouble you, but from information which we have received, it seemed possible {{that you might be}} able to help us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{young woman}} that came before and a stout {{woman with a}} little dark {{moustache}} and earrings. They’re going to wait until {{you come back to}} ask <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>questions</b> about Mr. Robinson. They’ve been asking me a few. I’ve locked the door of your state-room and here’s the key." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{of all the}} simpletons!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "So that's the way {{you give}} {{yourself}} away, is it? Just here from Jamaica, eh! Nothing to do with Douglas Romilly! Never heard of the Elletania, did you! I'd {{like to see you}} on the grid at police headquarters for five minutes, with one of our men asking <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> friendly <b>questions!</b> You'd look well, you would! You ought to go about with a nurse!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then {{we must do}} {{our best}} without him,' Sir Jasper said in a fatherly voice, inexpressively comforting to the desolate wounded spirit. 'I will not keep you long from your mother, but will <b>you</b> answer me <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>questions?</b> Your brother tells me---' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's a {{long trip}} to make for nothing," [...] said the director. [...] "And that's what it amounts to now. I thought I'd need <b>you</b> to answer <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>questions</b> for me. But you'll not be {{questioned}} officially, and so you'd better keep a close mouth... We've raised the money. The completion of the U.P.R. is assured." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Angry! My dear child, I am never angry," [...] Lady Medlincourt declared. [...] "I {{have arrived}} {{at that time in}} life when one cannot afford the luxury of giving way to emotion. You won't mind my asking <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>questions,</b> though, both of you. To begin with, I do not know your name. Who are you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope so, my dear boy. For a beginning, then, let me {{say that}} Lady Arabella's letter makes clear some things which she intended--and also some things which she did not intend. But, before I begin to draw deductions, let me ask <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>questions.</b> Adam, are you heart-whole, quite heart-whole, in the matter of Lady Arabella?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, we'll try the bobby, then," [...] she said. [...] "There's {{a horrible}} murder {{this morning on}} the placards. How do I know that you're not the chap? It looks {{suspicious}} when you come out in a new suit of clothes and throw the old ones into the river. Anyway, the bobby would want to ask <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>questions</b> about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We have no evidence, I understand, {{that you}} are in the {{smallest}} degree connected with the enemies of this country; but as you have been found out of the king's highway, or, rather, on a by-path, which I must confess is frequently used by the people of the neighborhood, but which is nevertheless nothing but a by-path, it becomes no more than what self-preservation requires of us, to ask <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> such <b>questions</b> as I trust will be satisfactorily answered. To use your own nautical phrases, 'From whence came ye, pray?' and 'whither are ye bound?'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is never}} worth while," [...] Harcutt said, [...] "to reject <b>a</b> {{possibility}} until <b>you</b> have tested and proved it. What you say, however, settles this one. They are not adventurers {{in any sense}} of the word. Now, will <b>you</b> answer me <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>questions?</b> It {{may be just as}} much to your advantage as to mine to go into this matter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We regret {{exceedingly}} {{to have to}} {{use force}} to a gentleman in his own house," [...] began the orator blandly; [...] "but we feel it our duty to prevent a repetition of the unhappy incident which occurred as we entered. We desire that <b>you</b> should answer <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>questions,</b> and are deeply grateful that you are still able to do so,--which seemed extremely improbable a moment or two ago." [...] He paused, coughed, and leaned back against the chimney. [...] "How many men have you here besides yourself?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And now, sir, I {{want to ask}} <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>questions</b> as to {{the road}} on the other side. By your report, I see that you {{consider}} the road through Campo Mayor {{to be the only}} one by which an army could move, and that a large body of workmen must be employed to make the other road fit for the passage of cannon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You were punctual, Miss Muir, which pleases me. I'm a sad invalid, as Lady Sydney told you, I hope; so that Miss Coventry's lessons will be {{directed}} by my niece, {{and you will}} go to her for directions, as she knows what I wish. You will excuse me if I ask <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>questions,</b> for Lady Sydney's note was very brief, and I left everything to her judgment." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now then," [...] said he, {{resuming}} his seat, [...] "the next favor I'll ask will be {{to allow}} me to fill my pipe, and put to <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>questions</b> as to the way the land lies about here at present. I've been away {{for a year and a}} half, and don't know what's going on, or who's dead or alive. By the way, have you happened to hear anybody speak of me?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Stay," [...] said he. [...] "Now {{that you}} are here, the {{mischief}} is done, and you cannot repair it by hastening away. You have interrupted me in my mood of thought, and must pay the penalty by suggesting other thoughts. I am a lonely man here, having {{spent most of my}} life abroad, and am separated from my neighbors by various circumstances. You seem to be an intelligent man. I should like to ask <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>questions</b> about your country." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And now, sir," [...] {{continued}} the vice-admiral; [...] "it {{is necessary to}} ask <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>questions,</b> in order that Atwood may know what next to write. Is it your desire to bequeath any real estate?" [...] Sir Wycherly assented. [...] "Do you wish to bequeath all your real estate?" [...] The same sign of assent was given. [...] "Do you wish to bequeath all to one person?" [...] The sign of assent was given to this also. [...] "This makes plain sailing, and a short run,--hey! Atwood?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We are {{inspired}} with none but Christian sentiments," [...] said Mr. Striker; [...] "Miss Garland perhaps most of all. Miss Garland," [...] and Mr. Striker {{waved his hand}} again as if to perform an introduction which had been regrettably omitted, [...] "is {{the daughter of a}} minister, the granddaughter of a minister, the sister of a minister." [...] Rowland bowed deferentially, and the young girl went on with her sewing, with nothing, apparently, either of embarrassment or elation at the promulgation of these facts. Mr. Striker continued: [...] "Mrs. Hudson, I see, is too deeply agitated to converse with you freely. She will allow me to address <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>questions.</b> Would you kindly inform her, as exactly as possible, just what you propose to do with her son?" ...|$|E
60|$|Since these confidences were thrust on me, I saw no harm {{in asking}} <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>questions.</b>|$|R
