500|$|Additional {{references}} {{are based on}} sight gags. The residents of Niceland and the bartender from Tapper are animated using a jerky motion that spoofs the limited animation cycles of the sprites of many eight- and sixteen-bit arcade games. King Candy uses the Konami Code on an NES controller to access the programming of Sugar Rush. Throughout Game Central Station is graffiti that includes [...] "Aerith lives" [...] (referencing the character of Aerith Gainsborough from Final Fantasy VII), [...] "All <b>your</b> <b>base</b> are belong to us" [...] (an Engrish phrase popularized from the game Zero Wing), [...] "Sheng Long Was Here" [...] (referencing an April Fool's joke around a made-up character Sheng Long from Street Fighter), and [...] "Jenkins" [...] (a nod to the popular Leeroy Jenkins meme from World of Warcraft). There is also {{a reference to the}} Metal Gear series when Ralph is searching for a medal in Tapper's Lost and found, finding first a Super Mushroom from the Mario franchise, and then Metal Gear Solids [...] "Exclamation point" [...] (with the corresponding sound effect from the game). Mr. Litwak wears a black and white striped referee's shirt, a nod to the iconic outfit of Twin Galaxies founder Walter Day. One of the songs in the credits is an original work from Buckner and Garcia, previously famous for writing video game-themed songs in the 1980s. The Walt Disney Animation Studios opening logo is animated in an 8-bit pixelated fashion, whereas the Walt Disney Pictures closing production logo appears in a glitched state, a reference to the kill screen from many early arcade games such as Pac-Man.|$|E

2500|$|Leet {{has its own}} colloquialisms, many {{of which}} {{originated}} as jokes based on common typing errors, habits of new computer users, or knowledge of cyberculture and history. Leet is not solely based upon one language or character set. Greek, Russian, and other languages have leet forms, and leet in one language may use characters from another where they are available. As such, {{while it may be}} referred to as a [...] "cipher", a [...] "dialect", or a [...] "language", leet does not fit squarely into any of these categories. The term leet itself is often written 31337, or 1337, and many other variations. After the meaning of these became widely familiar, 10100111001 came to be used in its place, because it is the binary form of 1337 decimal, making it more of a puzzle to interpret. An increasingly common characteristic of leet is the changing of grammatical usage so as to be deliberately incorrect. The widespread popularity of deliberate misspelling is similar to the cult following of the [...] "All <b>your</b> <b>base</b> are belong to us" [...] phrase. Indeed, the online and computer communities have been international from their inception, so spellings and phrases typical of non-native speakers are quite common.|$|E

Two levels in [...] "vasebreaker" [...] puzzles, [...] "Scary Potter" [...] and [...] "Ace of Vase", take their names from Harry Potter and Ace of Base. Similarly, the [...] "I, Zombie" [...] (a reference to Isaac Asimov's [...] "I, Robot") puzzles have levels called [...] "Dead Zeppelin" [...] (resembling Led Zeppelin) and [...] "All your brainz r belong to us" [...] (a play on the gaming meme [...] "All <b>your</b> <b>base</b> are belong to us"). The name of the Torchwood plant is a reference to Doctor Who and its spin-off show Torchwood. Originally, the dancing zombie resembled Michael Jackson from the short film [...] "Thriller". Though the Jackson-inspired zombie was present in the game before Jackson's death, the estate of Michael Jackson objected to its inclusion {{more than a year}} after his death; PopCap agreed to remove the Jackson-inspired zombie and replaced it with a more generic disco-dancing one for all future patches and releases of the game. [...] A [...] "disclaimer" [...] in the game's almanac states [...] "Any resemblance between Dancing Zombie and any persons living or dead is purely coincidental." [...] Some Plants vs. Zombies advertisements parody controversial Evony ads, showing a drooling zombie instead of a voluptuous woman.|$|E
