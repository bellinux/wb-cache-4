40|$|Objective: The primary aim of {{this study}} was to assess {{self-reported}} frequencies of selected condom use errors and problems, using a retrospective recall period of 2 months, among <b>young</b> <b>Black</b> <b>men</b> attending sexually transmitted infection clinics. A secondary objective was to determine whether more errors/problems occurred among men reporting sex with multiple partners compared with those reporting one sexual partner. Methods: Data were collected in clinics treating patients with sexually transmitted infections in three Southern US cities. Men, 15 – 23 years of age who identified as Black/African American and reported recent (past 2 months) condom use were eligible (N?=? 475). Results: Condom use errors and problems were common, with some of the most critical errors occurring for greater than one of every five <b>young</b> <b>Black</b> <b>men,</b> such as late application, early removal, slipping off during sex, and re-using condoms. For 8 (33. 3 %) of the 24 errors/problems assessed, <b>young</b> <b>Black</b> <b>men</b> reporting more than one sexual partner in the previous 2 months experienced more errors and problems than men reporting only one partner. Conclusion: The disease protective value of condoms may be sub-optimal in this population. A need exists to improve the quality of condom use among <b>young</b> <b>Black</b> <b>men</b> at risk of sexually transmitted infection acquisition or transmission. Intensified clinic-based intervention that helps <b>young</b> <b>Black</b> <b>men</b> improve the quality of their condom use behaviors is warranted...|$|R

LeRoi is a <b>young</b> <b>black</b> <b>man</b> in his early 20s from a well-to-do black family and son of a preacher, off for the summer and ready for college. Mary Anne is a young white woman courted by Charles, but who falls in love with LeRoi. When Charles discovers what has happened while he was away at college, he beats Mary Anne and reports to the sheriff that LeRoi beat and raped her. The town forms a lynch mob and the governor is set to attend. Feeling some remorse for what he had brought about, Charles confesses to the sheriff that he had beaten Mary Anne and that she never had been raped. The sheriff, unwilling to cancel due to the visit of the governor, allowed the lynching to proceed anyway.|$|E

He encountered Sarah Page, the 17-year-old white elevator operator who was on duty.

25|$|A {{few blocks}} away on Greenwood Avenue, members of the black {{community}} gathered to discuss the situation at the courthouse. Given the recent lynching of Belton, a white man accused of murder, they believed that Rowland was greatly at risk. The community was determined to prevent the lynching of the <b>young</b> <b>black</b> <b>man,</b> but divided about tactics. Young World War I veterans were preparing for a battle by collecting guns and ammunition. Older, more prosperous men feared a destructive confrontation that likely would cost them dearly. O. W. Gurley walked to the courthouse, where the sheriff assured him {{that there would be no}} lynching. Returning to Greenwood, Gurley tried to calm the group, but failed. About 7:30pm, a mob of approximately 30 black men, armed with rifles and shotguns, decided to go to the courthouse and support the sheriff and his deputies to defend Rowland from the mob. Assuring them that Rowland was safe, the sheriff and his black deputy, Barney Cleaver, encouraged the men to return home.|$|E

[...] Their group dynamic visually depicts a gender neutral equality, with Jackson [...] "performing asexually and anonymously in front of, but {{as one of the}} members of the group." [...] It is also noted that the success of the film is not only the final product, but in the commercial and social implications of its development. In selecting an unknown street dancer, Anthony Thomas, to develop her choreography, [...] "Janet Jackson secures a threefold achievement: she satisfies the dictates of the commercial pop music industry by creating a dance image which is significantly different from her earlier work; she demonstrates that, despite fame, she is still in touch with contemporary youth pop culture and its fashions; and finally, she , not the dance traditions of Hollywood musical... but the work of a <b>young</b> <b>black</b> <b>man</b> whose training is outside the institutions of Western theatre and clearly an Afro-American cultural expression of the late 1980s." [...] The film received positive reception. Jefferson Graham in USA Today commented that [...] "she dances up a storm in the moody black-and-white video's three songs... and plays the role of a mystical figure to young kids." [...] Jon Pareles remarked that [...] " [...] juxtaposes her dance routines with grim urban imagery and a plot line about drugs versus dreams." [...] It was later released on VHS as the Rhythm Nation 1814 Compilation, and reissued the following year with each of the album's promotional music videos.

2500|$|Cultural factors {{affecting}} youth exclusion include reactions to socially constructed categories like race and gender.

Some academics argue that youth are marginalized because they choose to separate themselves from mainstream society, opting instead to participate in alternative lifestyles and subcultures. Others, however, view this choice as a [...] "forced choice", motivated by the fear of racial, gender {{and other types of}} discrimination. McDonald presents the example of a <b>young</b> <b>black</b> <b>man</b> in the UK who chooses not to go to university because [...] "he fears discrimination as a university student". McDonald says, [...] "This is a negative externality imposed by the socially included that is influencing the choice of the <b>young</b> <b>black</b> <b>man</b> in the direction of social exclusion". [...] In this example both structural and cultural barriers influenced this student so he felt excluded from society; he felt pressure from society to remain on the periphery, and in doing so denying himself access to an education. In this situation education failed as an established social structure to provide this individual with inclusion into society.|$|E

40|$|The {{decline in}} the {{employment}} status of <b>young</b> <b>black</b> <b>men</b> relative to their white peers in the post- 1970 U. S. Labor market is the impetus for this research. This paper examines the effects of recent employment restructuring on young workers by race and sex. In {{the case of the}} least educated group of <b>young</b> <b>black</b> <b>men</b> (aged 25 - 34), the employment-to-population ratio declined by almost 35 percent (equivalent to 28 percentage points) from 1970 tol 985. Moreover, the 1980 s were a stark reversal to the decades-long trend of a narrowing of the black/white earnings gap. Recent literature on demand-side trends for black employment has employed aggregate Census industry and occupation classifications: A more accurate depiction of change among various demographic groups is represented in an increasingly consistent segregation of job classifications. The findings indicate that job segments with the highest concentration of <b>young</b> <b>black</b> <b>men</b> had the lowest employment and earnings growth, but the highest growth in educational requirements, between 1979 and 1989. Furthermore, while the distributions of moderately educated <b>young</b> <b>black</b> and white women among segments converged during this time, the black and white male distributions diverged sharply. Hence, the results imply a strong link between changes in rates of labor market discouragement and changes in job opportunities, job quality, and educational requirements. A lingering question remains for future research: Given that the distribution of <b>young,</b> moderately educated <b>black</b> and white women has narrowed substantially, why have <b>young</b> <b>black</b> <b>men</b> failed to redistribute themselves toward higher-quality, growing job segments as effectively as their white counterparts?...|$|R
40|$|The term "disconnected youth" {{refers to}} {{young people who have}} been out of school and out of work for {{considerable}} periods of time  like a year or more.

Of all racial and gender groups, <b>young</b> <b>black</b> <b>men</b> are by far the most likely to become "disconnected" from school and work.
