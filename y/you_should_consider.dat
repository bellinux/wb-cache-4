[...] Daily Nexus columnist Nina Love Anthony views the practice of facials in a non-threatening light, feeling that it adds variety to the sexual experience. In one of her weekly articles she wrote [...] "But let's give credit where credit is due: The money shot, by itself, is great {{for a number of}} reasons. Blowing it on someone's face is like a change-up pitch – if you've been throwing the heat for a while, maybe <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>consider</b> hooking the curve ball." [...] She continues with [...] "Also, being {{on the receiving end of}} the shot can satisfy the secret porn star in everyone and it's minor kink for beginners".|$|E

[...] The White House, and Camp David were wired for sound. [...] Nixon and Kissenger were eavesdropping on their aides and on reporters. Nixon's [...] "plumbers" [...] included former CIA officials Howard Hunt and Jim McCord. [...] On July 7, 1971, John Ehrlichman, Nixon's domestic policy chief, told DCI Cushman, Nixon's hatchet-man in the CIA, to let Cushman [...] "know that [...] was in fact doing some things for the President... <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>consider</b> he has pretty much carte blanche" [...] Importantly, this included a camera, disguises, a voice altering device, and ID papers furnished by the CIA, {{as well as the}} CIA's participation developing film from the burglary Hunt staged on the office of Pentagon Papers leaker Daniel Ellsberg's psychologist.|$|E

"I {{knew that}} Mrs. Lapham {{would know what}} was going on," [...] said Rogers more candidly, but not more virtuously, for that he could not, [...] "and I wished her to {{understand}} a point that I hadn't put to you at the hotel, and that I want <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>consider.</b> And I want <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>consider</b> me a little in this business too; you're not the only one that's concerned, I tell you, and I've been telling Mrs. Lapham that it's my one chance; that if you don't meet me on it, my wife and children will be reduced to beggary." ...|$|E

"That is {{not what}} I care about," [...] said Rachel, [...] "you are both of you so {{cautious}} that {{you tell me what}} amounts to nothing! <b>You</b> <b>should</b> <b>consider</b> {{how important it is to}} me to know something about the person in whose power my cousin's affairs are left." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You men," [...] she sighed, [...] "are all alike! You judge only by what happens. You {{never look}} inside. That is why your justice is so {{different}} from a woman's.

6000|$|Poor Rosier's face assumed an {{expression}} of alarm; a suit for the hand of Pansy Osmond was even a more complicated business than his taste for proper transitions had allowed.

"Without admitting {{the truth}} of a single word you have said, my dear Prince," [...] the Prime Minister remarked, [...] "there is {{another aspect of the}} whole subject which I think that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>consider.</b> If you find us in so parlous a state, it is surely {{scarcely}} dignified or gracious, {{on the part of a}} great nation like yours, to leave us so abruptly to our fate.

50|$|These Blanda PLUS {{designs are}} {{sometimes}} called BONER BASSES {{because of the}} longer horns required to get good balance due to the 22 fret necks. Besides the missing pick-guard, the Precision Plus Deluxe will have a slightly smaller body than the Plus version also. The Plus Deluxe is a really nice instrument. They used select woods on both PLUS versions too. I hardly ever see one of either version come up for sale. If you can find one in original condition <b>you</b> <b>should</b> seriously <b>consider</b> it {{as it is a}} playable collectible.
