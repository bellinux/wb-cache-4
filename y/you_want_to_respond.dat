In an interview with The Lighthouse Electronic Magazine in April 1996, he said:You know, the thing I like about Awesome God is that it's one of the worst-written songs that I ever wrote; it's just poorly crafted. But the thing is that sometimes, I think, that when you become too conscientious about being a songwriter, the message becomes a vehicle for the medium. This is a temptation that I think all songwriters have. I think a great songwriter is someone who is able to take a very meaningful piece of wisdom - or of folly or whatever - and say {{it in a way that}} is most likely <b>to</b> make people <b>respond.</b> But, what <b>you</b> <b>want</b> them <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> is not how cleverly you did that; what <b>you</b> <b>want</b> them <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> is your message.|$|R

The two-year college itself is still a relatively new concept and reading programs designed to fit the still evolving function of these schools offer the reading specialist both freedom and frustrations. To date, I have taught reading courses at a junior college which was affiliated with a university and at a community college with an open door policy. In the first instance, the courses were offered through the continuing education department and dealt largely with marginal admittance students. Presently I am within the English department and the reading courses are credit courses, some of which carry transfer credit to local universities. At this point, there are probably many more questions than answers. In this article, I would like to discuss these questions and perhaps this will lead to an exchange of ideas from other reading specialists w-ho may have solutions. Particularly at this level, it is easy to become isolated from dialogue with other reading personnel. What my questions may serve to do is offer an outline of topics <b>to</b> which <b>you</b> may <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond...</b>|$|R
40|$|Adverse {{selection}} {{is an important}} problem for marketers. To reduce the chances of acquiring an unprofitable customer, companies may screen prospects who <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> a marketing offer. Prospects who respond are often not approved. At the same time, prospects {{who are likely to}} be approved are unlikely <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> a given marketing offer. Using data from a firm’s customer relationship management system, the authors show how to target prospects who are likely <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> and be approved. This approach increases the number of customers who are approved and reduces the number of applicants who may defect after being turned down. This method can be extended to new customer acquisition and more effective targeting of costly promotions to migrate customers to higher levels of lifetime value. In many businesses, the customers most likely to sign on are precisely the worst customers you could possibly find. —Reichheld (1996, p. 76) The customers <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> attract don’t <b>respond,</b> and the ones <b>you</b> don’t <b>want</b> <b>to</b> attract do. —Richard E.

40|$|Objectives {{define what}} you will have the {{students}} do. Objectives provide a link between expectations, teaching and grading. Stating clear course objectives is important because: Objectives guide the content materials and the teaching methods. You can use objectives {{to make sure you}} reach your goals. Students will understand expectations. Assessment and grading is based on the objectives. Basic Information As you develop a course, a lesson or a learning activity, you have <b>to</b> determine what <b>you</b> <b>want</b> the students <b>to</b> learn and how you will know that they learned. Learning objectives, also called behavioral objectives and instructional objectives, are a requirements for highquality course development. What are Goals? Goals are broad, generalized statements about what is to be learned. Think of them as a target to be reached, or "hit. " Questions you need to think about Who are your students? Basics? Paramedics? A mix of different prior knowledge and experience? Is this course a general education course or a course to refresh/review for relicensure? The A. B. C. D. method The ABCD method of writing objectives is an excellent starting point for writing objectives (Heinich, et al., 1996). In this system, "A " is for audience; "B " is for behavior, "C " for conditions and "D " for degree of mastery needed. 1. Audience – Who? Who are your learners? 2. Behavior – What? What do you expect {{them to be able to}} do? This should be an overt, observable behavior, even if the actualbehavior is covert or mental in nature. If you can't see it, hear it, touch it, taste it, or smell it, you can't be sure your audience really learned it. 3. Condition – How? Under what circumstances or context will the learning occur? What will the student be given or already be expected to know to accomplish the learning? 4. Degree – How much? How much will be accomplished, how well will the behavior need to be performed, and to what level? Do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> total mastery (100 %), do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> them <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> correctly 80 % of the time, etc. A common (and totally nonscientific) setting is 80 % of the time...|$|R
