500|$|Postmodern {{cultural}} critic bell hooks {{cited the}} interaction in the Memphis train station between Thomas and the Japanese couple {{as one of}} the few examples of nuanced, deconstructive and subversive treatment of blackness in American film. In his original review for the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert proclaimed that [...] "he best thing about Mystery Train is that it takes you to an America <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>you</b> ought to be able to find for yourself, if you only knew where to look." [...] He later included the movie in his Great Movies collection, comparing the movie favorably to Jarmusch's later efforts like Dead Man and The Limits of Control. In an April 2000 retrospective of Jarmusch's work for Sight & Sound, Shawn Levy concluded that the film was [...] "as much a valentine to the allure of the American way of pop culture as it is a cheeky bit of structural legerdemain without terribly much resonating significance".|$|E

500|$|After a one-yard Mike Pruitt run, Rutigliano {{called a}} timeout. A short field goal {{would have been}} the safe bet — that was all Cleveland needed to win. Rutigliano, ever the risk-taker, decided to go for a touchdown. The coach was {{reluctant}} to stake the game's outcome on the usually sure-footed Cockroft, who had missed two field goals and an extra point earlier in the game. The play he called was Red Right 88, a passing formation in which a slanting Logan would be Sipe's primary target, while Newsome was insurance. If everyone was covered, Rutigliano told Sipe on the sidelines, [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>you</b> have to force the ball, throw it into Lake Erie, throw it into some blonde's lap in the bleachers." [...] Sipe took the snap, dropped back and threw to Newsome as he crossed to the left. But Oakland safety Mike Davis leaped in front and intercepted the ball, cementing the Oakland win. The Raiders went on to win Super Bowl XV, while Red Right 88 became an enduring symbol of Cleveland's postseason stumbles.|$|E
500|$|Chuck Taylor also {{reviewed}} [...] "I Want You to Need Me" [...] {{and wrote}} that linking Dion and Diane Warren {{has always been}} about [...] "as fine a fit as a trusty pair of Thom McAn's." [...] Between Warren's [...] "heart-drenched" [...] words and dramatic melody writing and Dion's [...] "potent vocals straight from soulside, divadom has never sounded so mighty." [...] According to him, for fans of Dion's [...] "high-caliber" [...] power ballads, this is truly among the best ever and a highlight on All the Way... A Decade of Song. Longing for romantic attention, Dion sings, [...] "I want you [...] to need me, like the air you breathe/I {{want you to feel}} me, in everything/I want you to see me, in your every dream/The way that I taste <b>you,</b> <b>feel</b> <b>you,</b> breathe you, need you." [...] Taylor stated that Warren's trusty melody is wholly natural and free-flowing, while production from the usually rock-oriented Matt Serletic is [...] "sheer perfection". It all peaks from the glorious midsection through to the end, where Dion delivers exactly what we've come to expect: a crescendo as [...] "spine-tingling" [...] as those first few times we heard [...] "My Heart Will Go On".|$|E

[...] He struck out five, while giving up five singles, raising his record to 16–4, and tying Sabathia and Verlander for the AL lead in victories. [...] He {{became the first}} Rangers pitcher to win 16 games since Kevin Millwood in 2006. [...] It was his seventh win in a row, eighth {{straight}} road victory (a new Texas record), and 12th road win overall in 2009 (another new club record, and tops in the AL). [...] "I'm not doing anything different on the road than I am at home", said Feldman, who had allowed only one run in the last 26.1 innings. [...] "The preparation is the same. [...] I think it's a pretty humbling game, so you can't get too high or too low." [...] He became the first Rangers right-hander to allow just one run over four consecutive starts. [...] Outfielder Marlon Byrd said: [...] "When you have your ace on the mound, you expect to win. You {{get a couple of}} runs early, and <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>you</b> have a 'W' in hand. [...] He has been unbelievable this year when he steps on the mound.... He just keeps getting better." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews from television critics. Aaron Kinney from Salon magazine {{said that the}} episode title showed that the creators at least still {{had a sense of}} humor, but that the episode demonstrated some of the flaws that caused the series to jump the shark in the first place: [...] "cheesy melodrama, deathly slow pacing, and a lack of coherence". John Keegan from Critical Myth was also negative about the episode and awarded it a 4 out of 10. He called it [...] "one of the worst episodes of the season", and hoped that it was no indication of what the series finale was going to be like. Furthermore, Keegan criticized the fact that David Duchovny did not make a cameo appearance [...] "either full frame or in the distance", given his history with the Lone Gunmen. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one star out of five, and noted that [...] "there's nothing celebratory" [...] about the entry. The two were highly critical of the episode's conclusion, calling it [...] "such a bland way of dying that for a moment, <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>you</b> must have missed the point". Shearman and Pearson, furthermore, argued that [...] "The Lone Gunmen deserved better. No, worse than that—we deserved better." [...] M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, criticized the [...] "goofy tone" [...] of the episode, saying it felt [...] "very out of place" [...] {{within the context of the}} series.|$|E
500|$|According to The Sunday People, [...] "though {{critics said}} it was an affectionate tribute about a nice man. Van went on to urge fans not to buy it." [...] According to The Boston Globe, Van Morrison [...] "disdained the book". In an {{interview}} with The Boston Globe, Turner commented on this: [...] "He considers anything that reveals details of family background or anything like that an invasion of his privacy. He doesn't believe in biographies, and I do." [...] When the biography came out in hardcover, Van Morrison sent Turner 36 statements from the book that he called [...] "lies, gross exaggerations and innuendo". Van Morrison told Turner that none of the 40 individuals the author had interviewed for the biography were currently friends of his. The letter from Van Morrison to Turner concluded with: [...] "I am very sorry that <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>you</b> are entitled to earn a living by peddling distortions and inaccuracies about me personally." [...] In his reply letter to Van Morrison, Turner wrote: [...] "You may not think you are 'difficult' or 'introvert' but other people do and have the right to express their opinions." [...] The Sunday Times reported that [...] "Allegedly, Van's management even considered buying up all 25,000 copies of the book to pulp them," [...] and this was also reported in The Independent. The Evening Times wrote that Van Morrison [...] "reportedly tried to buy all the copies of a biography by Steve Turner." [...] Representatives for Van Morrison did not confirm whether he attempted to purchase the 25,000 copies of the biography, and confirmed that [...] "representatives of the singer discussed various possibilities". Van Morrison's manager, Chris O'Donnell, said of the musician: [...] "He is not happy about books, period. He is an artist and stands up for himself – he doesn't want his private life raked over." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of its release, Animal House {{received}} mixed reviews from critics but several immediately recognized its appeal, and it has since been {{recognized as one of the}} best films of 1978. The film holds a 91% positive rating on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes. Its consensus states [...] "The talents of director John Landis and Saturday Night Lives irrepressible John Belushi conspired to create a rambunctious, subversive college comedy that continues to resonate." [...] Roger Ebert gave the film four stars out of four and wrote, [...] "It's anarchic, messy, and filled with energy. It assaults us. Part of the movie's impact comes from its sheer level of manic energy. ... But the movie's better made (and better acted) than we might at first realize. It takes skill to create this sort of comic pitch, and the movie's filled with characters that are sketched a little more absorbingly than they had to be, and acted with perception". Ebert later placed the film on his 10 best list of 1978, the only National Lampoon film to have received this honor. In his review for Time, Frank Rich wrote, [...] "At its best it perfectly expresses the fears and loathings of kids who came of age in the late '60s; at its worst Animal House revels in abject silliness. The hilarious highs easily compensate for the puerile lows". Gary Arnold wrote in his review for The Washington Post, [...] "Belushi also controls a wicked array of conspiratorial expressions with the audience. ... He can seem irresistibly funny in repose or invest minor slapstick opportunities with a streak of genius". David Ansen wrote in Newsweek, [...] "But if Animal House lacks the inspired tastelessness of the Lampoon's High School Yearbook Parody, this is still low humor of a high order". Robert Martin wrote in The Globe and Mail, [...] "It is so gross and tasteless <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>you</b> should be disgusted but it's hard to be offended by something that is so sidesplittingly funny". Time magazine proclaimed Animal House one of the year's best.|$|E

But if the Spirit of God so moves you that <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>you</b> simply must give utterance to what is in your heart, then do not hesitate. We have time for that kind of praying.

You're galloping through gopher holes, etc. And they got the mares down at the far end. The stallion {{getting ready to go}} is smelling the mares and he's running like a bat out of hell and Linda's behind me saying, 'I'm very nervous about this horse.' And I said, 'Join the club.
