500|$|The Telegraphs Nigel Farndale {{praised the}} film's {{balanced}} {{view of the}} director: [...] "ven though he was portrayed in this exquisite drama as a manipulative, vindictive martinet, the portrait was not unsympathetic." [...] The Daily Mirrors Jane Simon echoed this view, praising Jones's Hitchcock and writing that the actor [...] "managed to give [...] touches of humanity, too. There are moments when <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> real pang of sympathy for Hitchcock, although admittedly they don't last long". [...] "liding gracefully through it all (and with an impeccable American accent) Sienna Miller brings untouchable beauty and icy glamour, but also captures the extraordinary resilience Hedren must have had to withstand everything Hitchcock threw at her." [...] In The Telegraph, Clive James said [...] " [...] better choice [...] {{could not have been}} made than Sienna Miller, who is even lovelier than Hedren was...Toby Jones, quite believably looked stunned". John Doyle of Canada's The Globe and Mail was less impressed with the actors' performances. Of Miller (whom he described as [...] "good but not great") he wrote, [...] "She doesn't have the iciness that Hedren had in her youth and she struggles to convey Hedren's enormous strength of character as a woman unwilling to let Hitchcock have his way". Doyle was equally critical of Jones, describing him as someone who [...] "seems to be imitating Hitchcock rather than inhabiting the role".|$|E
500|$|The same year, Garfield co-starred {{opposite}} Jesse Eisenberg in The Social Network, a drama {{based on}} the founders of Facebook. On his character, Garfield remarked that [...] "No one knows who Eduardo Saverin is, and I don't either. Of course, the fact he's a real-life human being, breathing on this Earth somewhere, creates a whole new dimension to my approach because <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> greater sense of responsibility". Initially, the film's director, David Fincher, had met Garfield {{under the auspices of}} him playing Mark Zuckerberg, having been referred to him by Mark Romanek. However, Fincher did not like Garfield for the part as he found Garfield's [...] "incredible emotional access to his kind of core humanity" [...] better tailored for the role of Saverin. Garfield's performance was very well received; he earned wider recognition and numerous nominations, including BAFTA nominations for Best Actor in a Supporting Role and Rising Star, as well as a Golden Globe nomination for Best Performance in a Supporting Role. Mark Kermode of the BBC expressed his surprise that Garfield had been overlooked for an Academy Award nomination, opining that [...] "everyone knows he's one of the very best things about the Social Network". Writing in The Wall Street Journal, Joe Morgenstern thought the role was portrayed with [...] "great subtlety and rueful charm". Rolling Stone said Garfield delivered [...] "a vulnerability that raises the emotional stakes in a movie", and proclaimed: [...] "Keep your eyes on Garfield — he's shatteringly good, the soul of a film that might otherwise be without one." [...] He received similar plaudits of the Los Angeles Times, Entertainment Weekly, and The New Yorker.|$|E

[...] which was {{a reference to the}} alleged involvement of Hawke in the resignation of former Labor leader, Bill Hayden. The question outraged Hawke, who criticised Carleton for his [...] "damned impertinence".|$|E
2500|$|Hirokazu Koike of Rockin' On Japan {{praised the}} song {{developing}} from its minor chord progression into a bold chorus. He was deeply {{impressed by the}} song's ability to make <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> sense of a tough life force. CDJournal reviewers described [...] "Wildflower" [...] as a [...] "medium" [...] rock song, that was simple and driven with strong vocals. They praised the song's subltle guitar riff introduction which lead into a firmly charming song, {{as well as the}} [...] "international atmosphere" [...] caused by the mandolin accents. They felt that the song had strong imagery of a flower rooted firmly in desolate earth, caused by the song's strong sound and heart-resonating vocals.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1836 she {{accompanied}} her husband to Malta, busying herself while there with investigations into the remains of Maltese art. On their return from that island, {{she and her husband}} returned to Germany. Thence they passed to Paris, where they remained until they were driven home by the revolution of 1848. In 1840 she translated Ranke's History of the Popes, which was warmly praised by Thomas Babington Macaulay and Henry Hart Milman. When this translation was published, her intimate friend Sir George C. Lewis wrote to her saying, [...] "Murray is very desirous that you should undertake some original work. Do <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> 'Beruf' of this sort?" [...] However, she felt no such [...] "Beruf" [...] and most of her subsequent works were translations.|$|E

2500|$|When {{the joint}} album leaked on February 22, 2002 it caused the label, Roc-A-Fella, {{to push the}} album's release date up from the initial date, March 26, to March 19. Jay-Z {{expressed}} his frustration about the album leak to MTV News: [...] "It's the gift and the curse. It's an honor that everybody wants your music fast, {{but on the other}} hand, it's another thing when the music gets out before you [...] Because that's your art. You feel attached to it. <b>You</b> <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> certain way and you want people to go out and support it. The time that you take, it's like a piece of your life. You take parts of your life and you put it on these records and then for it to just be traded and moved around [...]|$|E
2500|$|Todd and Marty's {{relationship}} became {{based on}} a psychiatrist/patient dynamic and not something physical. When asked if romance could be a possibility, Carlivati stated, [...] "I'd like to watch it unfold a beat at a time, a day at a time, {{a week at a}} time and not have the audience jump to, 'Are they going to kiss? Are they going to fall in love? Are they going to sleep together?' The goal is more to take these two characters who have an unbelievable, dark history with each other and explore where it would or could go if they didn't have that obstacle [...] the rape [...] between them." [...] However, Carlivati said that this obstacle would always be there and that the audience would see close moments. These close moments include Todd helping Marty walk and physical contact between the two while he nurses her back to health. [...] "I think the thing about the two of them, the characters and the actors, is <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> chemistry when they're just talking, so I don't necessarily categorize it as romantic," [...] stated Carlivati. [...] "They're definitely forming a relationship and it continues to grow and build through the fall." ...|$|E
2500|$|Puciato later {{commented on}} the act saying; “It was {{early in the day}} and as most people, you kind of get that out of the way early in the day but I never did. I made a point to hold onto it. And you know the turtle, the {{malicious}} turtle, was pretty easy to fire that fucker right out of the hole. There was no way in hell that I thought that we were ever going make a living doing this or that in fourteen years I would still be having a conversation as Greg from Dillinger Escape Plan. I just thought this was a ball of fire that’s gonna implode or it’s got a shelf life, there’s no way this can continue. So when we would get asked to play something like that in my head I was like ‘well, this is never going to happen again, when am I ever going to play a festival with bands I don’t like. That was kind of the other thing, {{that was the first time}} we ever played with bands we don’t like. Up until then it was like you go on tour with bands <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> kinship with and we had never been exposed to some like mass thing where you’re playing with a band like Puddle of Mudd or whoever it was at the time who made me feel like [...] "Oh I got to make some kind of a statement." [...] So it was kind of a combo of kind of wanting to cause the biggest ruckus imaginable, since we’re obviously never going to do this again anyway, I might as well make sure that we’re never allowed to do this again anyway. And then just kind of making a statement in a way that I felt would be unavoidable for people to pay attention to.” ...|$|E

Catherine Gee of The Telegraph credited Capaldi's acting in [...] "The Woman Who Lived" [...] noting [...] "he has grown into the role utterly and completely. He embodies {{the weight of the}} Doctor's responsibility; his face wears every nuanced expression with a flickering ease". His performance in [...] "The Zygon Inversion" [...] was heavily praised by fans and critics most specifically his anti-war speech, with Dan Martin of The Guardian stating [...] "this Doctor has never been written better, Capaldi has never channelled Tom Baker more". Most prominently Capaldi's performance in [...] "Heaven Sent" [...] received universal widespread acclaim, with Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times noting that [...] "Peter Capaldi's one-man show is an instant classic", and that [...] "Capaldi delivers 100%, carrying every scene and showing every facet of his Doctor: anger, terror, playfulness, intensity, resignation and, finally, a fierce refusal to do anything other than do what he has always done: find a way to win". In a review for [...] "Hell Bent", Catherine Gee stated [...] "Peter Capaldi proved that {{he is one of the}} greatest Doctors". Den of Geek praised the dynamic between the Doctor and River Song in [...] "The Husbands of River Song", with Simon Brew noting the pair as a [...] "strong double act", with Morgan Jeffery of Digital Spy stating [...] "this, combined with Capaldi and Kingston's sensitive work, means <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> weight of history between these two people who've never shared a screen before". Andrew Billen of The Times praised the Twelfth Doctor for being at his [...] "warmest" [...] in [...] "The Return of Doctor Mysterio", along with The Guardian applauding the dynamic between the Doctor and Nardole noting [...] "Peter Capaldi and Matt Lucas are 'a pantomime treat'". In June 2016, Peter Capaldi was shortlisted for a national TV Choice Award for Best Actor. He had also been submitted for a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series. In addition, Capaldi was announced as a BAFTA Scotland Awards nomination as Best Actor on Television.|$|E
