40|$|Preferred Habitat Theory is {{a theory}} on the {{investing}} behavior of bond buyers. It states that individual investors have a preferred range of bond maturity lengths, and will only go outside of this range if a higher yield is promised. This theory also states that investors prefer shorter-term bonds to longer-term bonds. The preferred Habitat Theory is the modern interest theory explaining the yield curve. It {{was developed in the}} post Nixon era to meet the difficulties arising in the fiat currency systems. Modigliani and Sutch were primarily concerned with an empirical investigation of the effects of a particular policy of the US government and Federal Reserve, “Operation Twist”, which aimed at “twisting” the yield curve by raising the <b>yield</b> <b>of</b> <b>bonds</b> with short term to maturity and lowering simultaneously long-term rates. It was believed that this policy would help to reduce the balance of paymentsof the US. In order to give a rationale for the linear model they estimated, they reviewed the existing theories of the term structure, mainly the Expectations and the Liquidity Premium Hypothesis, and they developed their own theory, which has become known under the name of “Preferred Habitat Theory”.

40|$|The use {{of credit}} ratings in {{financial}} and other legal documents — {{both in the}} USA and Europe —, {{has led to a}} situation in which the major rating agencies have become (largely unwilling) participants in the legislative process. This situation has become partly formalized in the US (and is being repeated elsewhere in the European Union, Eastern Europe and Latin America) through the creation of officially 'recognized' agencies whose ratings now carry the imprimatur of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the debate on the necessity for formal legal status to be sustained in the market for bond credit ratings. In this context, the criteria for a credible rating agency are examined and evidence is provided on one element of the criteria which is under-researched: namely, the impact of the ratings in the market place. The influence of rating agencies in international capital markets is assessed through an analysis of the impact of ratings on the <b>yields</b> <b>of</b> <b>bonds,</b> represented by a comprehensive sample of actively traded debt. The sample contains analysis of ratings introductions on both new and seasoned debt and also examines the impact of ratings revisions. It is concluded that official recognition has no market-based role and it is argued that ratings are used by regulators because of the success of the major agencies in performing their market function.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The paper {{estimates}} the fiscal {{cost of an}} increase in the Brazilian policy interest rate - the SELIC - by considering not only the direct effect on the <b>yield</b> <b>of</b> public <b>bonds</b> that are indexed to the SELIC, but also indirect effects on: (i) the <b>yield</b> <b>of</b> public <b>bonds</b> that are indexed to the exchange rate and inflation, and (ii) the stock of public net debt through adjustments in the value of international reserves measured in domestic currency. Projections are based on the estimation of the relationship between interest rates, exchange rates and inflation by means of a vector auto-regression. We conclude that the inclusion of such indirect effects has an ambiguous effect on the response of the implicit interest rate on public net debt to shocks in the SELIC, when adjustments in the value of international reserves are not considered. However, the inclusion of the latter amplifies the fiscal cost of a more restrictive monetary policy. These results call for a better coordination between monetary, fiscal and exchange rate policies in Brazil...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{estimates of}} the impact of debt issued by one government in a monetary union on the <b>yields</b> <b>of</b> <b>bonds</b> issued by other governments in the union. These debt spillovers may occur if there is a risk of monetary accommodation, implicit or explicit inter-jurisdictional bailout provisions, or interdependent revenue sources. The analysis empirically distinguishes between two channels through which debt spillovers may affect bond yields: currency depreciation risk and default risk. Data on the <b>yields</b> <b>of</b> individual Canadian provincial government bonds for the period 1983 - 2003 are employed. No evidence is found of debt spillover effects between provinces, but a 1 percentage point increase in the central government’s debt to GDP ratio raises the yield on provincial government bonds by 4. 3 basis points — 3. 0 basis points by increasing the expected depreciation rate of the Canadian dollar and 1. 3 basis points by raising the risk of provincial government default. These results imply that a rise in the Canadian central government debt to GDP ratio from. 25 to. 58, equivalent to the rise that occurred between 1983 and 1995, would lead to an increase in provincial government <b>bond</b> <b>yields</b> <b>of</b> 142 basis points...|$|R

40|$|The {{financial}} crisis {{that started in}} mid- 2007 {{had a significant impact}} on the European government’s bond market. While sovereign debt increased severely only in a few EU countries, the latter became a major problem for the area as a whole. When the spread between the <b>yields</b> <b>of</b> sovereign <b>bonds</b> issued by European Monetary Union (EMU) countries and the <b>yields</b> <b>of</b> <b>bonds</b> with similar characteristics issued by the German government (which virtually is free of default risk) increases, market perceptions of the default risk inside these countries increase as well. The paper investigates the main drivers <b>of</b> EMU sovereign <b>yield</b> spreads. The analysis is performed over the period 2002 - 2013 and uses Germany as the reference. We employ dynamic panel estimation techniques: panel cointegration and panel–based Vector Error Correction Models (VECM), including the Pooled Mean Group estimator (Pesaran and Smith, 1995; Pesaran, Shin and Smith, 1999). Therefore, our analysis overcomes two drawbacks characterizing the traditional dynamic panel-data literature: it does not allow only the intercept to differ across the groups, on the contrary, it permits the heterogeneity in the slope parameters. The advantage of using these approaches is that it permits taking a step forward with respect to the traditional literature on dynamic panels, by estimating a different slope parameter for each country, and by taking into account the non-stationarity of variables. Results reveal that large public debt, liquidity and political risks, are likely to put substantial upward pressures on sovereign bond yields, especially in advanced-core euro area economies. Findings are robust to different specifications and are qualitatively similar across different groups of countries...|$|R
