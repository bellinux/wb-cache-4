500|$|The Symphonic Fantasies album {{garnered}} universal praise {{upon its}} release. Patrick Gann of RPGFan {{said that it}} was [...] "the best game music arranged album of 2010. It may be the best in years, with the only things rivaling it being other recordings from the WDR." [...] Audun Sorlie of Original Sound Version called it [...] "the best symphonic game arrangement CD <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>your</b> hands on," [...] and further added [...] "for every game music fan out there, especially the ones with a taste for Square Enix, this is the definitive pick for you." [...] Chris Greening of Square Enix Music Online gave the album the score of 10 out of 10, and stated that it [...] "offers a definitive tribute to Square Enix" [...] and [...] "certainly deserves a perfect score and an unconditional recommendation." [...] Benjamin Schmädig of the German site 4players.de said of the album [...] "Symphonic Fantasies represents memories of great emotional moments. The orchestra and choir put in all their strength, all their subtlety in these moments." [...] He further complimented Jonne Valtonen, saying that he [...] "knows exactly how to arrange the known motifs in such an imaginative way that they tell the familiar stories from scratch." [...] Denis Brown of the German site OnlineWelten said that for Square Enix fans, it is an obligatory purchase.|$|E
500|$|For {{the role}} of Edward Bloom, Burton spoke with Jack Nicholson, Spielberg's initial choice for the role. Burton had {{previously}} worked with Nicholson on Batman (1989) and Mars Attacks! (1996). In order to depict Nicholson as the young Bloom, Burton intended to {{use a combination of}} computer-generated imagery and prosthetic makeup. The director then decided to cast around for the two actors in question. Jinks and Cohen, who were then working with Ewan McGregor on Down with Love (2003), suggested that Burton cast both McGregor and Albert Finney for Edward. Burton later compared McGregor's acting style to regular colleague Johnny Depp. Viewing Finney's performance in Tom Jones (1963), Burton found him similar to McGregor, and coincidentally found a People magazine article comparing the two. McGregor, being Scottish, found it easier performing with a Southern American English accent. [...] "It's a much easier accent to do than a standard American accent because you can really hear it. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>your</b> teeth into it. Standard American is much harder because it's more lyrical." [...] The same dual casting applied to {{the role of}} Bloom's wife, Sandra, who would be played by Jessica Lange and Alison Lohman. Burton commented that he was impressed with Lohman's performance in White Oleander (2002). Burton's girlfriend, Helena Bonham Carter, was also cast in two roles. Her prosthetic makeup for The Witch took five hours to apply. [...] "I was pregnant throughout filming, so it was weird being a pregnant witch," [...] the actress reflected. [...] "I had morning sickness, so all those fumes and the make-up and the rubber...it was hideous." ...|$|E

As an actress you want to get roles <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>your</b> teeth into. I leave it at the gates when I leave work. Years ago, with the storyline when Kat told Zoe Slater she was her real mother, I found it tougher because I was new to the game.

[...] On a lighter note, Wallace added: [...] "There are two babies playing Tommy, called Ralph and Shane, and they're dressed in outfits like zebra-skin babygros and little denim jackets – that's the Alfie (Shane Richie) influence. They keep going for Kat's big earrings and they're always grabbing at the chicken fillets I have to wear." ...|$|E
