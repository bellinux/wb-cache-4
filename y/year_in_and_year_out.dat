25|$|Bunning's 2,855 career strikeouts put him {{in second}} place on the all-time list {{at the time of}} his retirement, behind only Walter Johnson. His mark was later surpassed by other pitchers, and he is {{currently}} 17th all-time. Despite <b>year</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>year</b> <b>out</b> putting up excellent numbers, Bunning rarely led the league in any pitching categories. He never led the league in ERA; the only year he led the league in wins (20, in 1957, with the Detroit Tigers) was the only year he ever won 20 or more games; he did, however, lead the league in strikeouts three times (with 201 in 1959 and 1960, and 253 in 1967). He never won a Cy Young Award; the closest he would come was in 1967, his best year, when at age 35, he came in second behind Mike McCormick. He finished with a middling 17–15 record, but posted a career-best ERA (2.29), and led the league in shutouts (6), games started and innings pitched (40/302.1), and strikeouts (253). It was the only year in his career he earned any Cy Young Award votes. He did, however, win the NL Player of the Month Award June 1964, the month of his perfect game (3–0, 2.20 ERA, 42 SO).|$|E
500|$|Following the Master of Reality {{world tour}} in 1972, Black Sabbath took its first break in three years. As Ward explained: [...] "The band started to become very {{fatigued}} and very tired. We'd {{been on the}} road non-stop, <b>year</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>year</b> <b>out,</b> constantly touring and recording. I think Master of Reality was kind of like the end of an era, the first three albums, and we decided to take our time with the next album." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bill Meek, coach from 1968 to 1973, {{failed to}} {{substantially}} improve the Utes, {{and they went}} 33–31 (.516) over his six seasons before he was fired. The Utes' best season under Meek was an 8–2 campaign in 1969. Meek, like his predecessor, Giddings, failed to get any sort of recruiting momentum which resulted in subpar and mediocre team performances <b>year</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>year</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E

They offer something for everyone, from advocacy groups looking for role models to indignation-seeking conservatives, from goggle-eyed male viewers to progressive female ones, from tyrants who demand psychological complexity to plot buffs.|$|R

2500|$|As a {{conservative}} risk-averse financier, Thomson avoided disaster during the panics of 1837, 1857, and 1873, while rival lines often went bankrupt. [...] His Pennsylvania Railroad was worth about $400 {{million in the}} early 1870s (before the Panic of 1873 depressed values), with $25 million in traffic revenue and a profit of $8.6 million. It paid steady dividends <b>year</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>year</b> <b>out</b> and was a favorite for cautious investors, while speculators who were so numerous in the postwar era looked elsewhere. Thomson {{had a vision of}} a transcontinental line, invested his own money in several ventures, and briefly in 1871 the Pennsylvania controlled the Union Pacific.|$|E

2500|$|After 1920, the National Woman's Party {{authored}} over 600 {{pieces of}} legislation fighting for women's equality; over 300 of these were passed. In addition, the NWP continued to lobby for {{the passage of the}} Equal Rights Amendment.Scholar Mary K. Trigg has noted, [...] "...the NWP {{played a central role in}} the women's rights movement after 1945. It stuck to its laser-like focus on the ERA, doggedly lobbying <b>year</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>year</b> <b>out</b> for the amendment's introduction in Congress." [...] In 1997, the NWP ceased to be a lobbying organization. Instead, it turned its focus to education and to preserving its collection of first hand source documents from the women's suffrage movement. The NWP continues to function as an educational organization, maintaining and interpreting the collection left by the work of the historic National Woman's Party.|$|E
2500|$|Florida State {{maintains}} two traditional {{rivals in}} all sports with the Florida Gators and the Miami Hurricanes.

The rivalry with Miami dates back to 1951, when the Hurricanes defeated the Seminoles 35–13 in their inaugural meeting.
