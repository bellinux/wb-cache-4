Flow was later developed into a PlayStation 3 game by Thatgamecompany in 2007 and a PlayStation Portable game by SuperVillain Studios in 2008. Flower was Thatgamecompany's [...] "first game outside the safety net of academia". It was first announced at the Tokyo Game Show on September 24, 2007, and was released on the PlayStation Network on February 12, 2009. Flower was intended primarily to provoke positive emotions in the player, and to act as [...] "an emotional shelter". Six to nine people were involved at varying stages of development. Chen, who co-founded Thatgamecompany with game producer Kellee Santiago, was the creative director {{in charge of the}} game, while Clark was the lead designer. Chen described the game as [...] "an interactive poem exploring the tension between urban and nature".

500|$|Ivan Kreilkamp of Spin {{gave the}} album an {{eight out of}} ten. The review said that the album is [...] "as {{sprawling}} and generous-spirited as Superunknown, but... is a looser and live-er-sounding affair, not seeking {{the same level of}} aural precision". Alternative Press gave the album a three out of five. The review said that Soundgarden are [...] "now fully capable of penning some damned spiffy pop songs", and added that [...] "they sound more human here, like they're playing in <b>your</b> <b>living</b> room". Rolling Stone staff writer David Fricke gave Down on the Upside three out of five stars, observing that the album has [...] "some quality frenzy", but criticizing it for [...] "lack defining episodes of catharsis". Fricke said, [...] "Soundgarden seem to be digging in their heels rather than kicking up dirt, relying too much on drone-y impressionism and clever (as opposed to cleaving) guitar motifs." [...] Neil Strauss of The New York Times called the album the [...] "rawer, looser follow-up to Superunknown." [...] He added, [...] "Generally, identifying with animals in song lyrics is a sign of low self-esteem, and Soundgarden is no exception. For all the virility and macho power that rock singers have tried to wring from the , Soundgarden remains more interested in {{the fact that it is}} the only animal cursed to spend its days slithering on the ground." ...|$|E
500|$|The next game, Flower, was Chen and Thatgamecompany's [...] "first game {{outside the}} safety net of academia". Chen was the {{creative}} director {{in charge of the}} game, while Santiago was the producer and Clark was the lead designer. The company ranged in size from six to nine people at varying stages of the game's development. Flower was intended by Chen to provoke positive emotions in the player, and to act as [...] "an emotional shelter".

I thought; wouldn't it be nice if it was a portal that would allow you to be embraced by nature." [...] Chen designed the game around the idea that the primary purpose of entertainment products like video games was the feelings that they evoked in the audience, and that the emotional range of most games was very limited. To make Flower have the [...] "emotional spectrum" [...] that he wanted, Chen looked at the development process as creating a work of art, rather than a [...] "fun" [...] game, which would not provoke the desired emotions. In 2008, during Flowers development, Chen was named to the MIT Technology Review TR35 {{as one of the top}} 35 innovators in the world under the age of 35.|$|E

2500|$|Most of the {{circuits}} {{currently in}} use are specially constructed for competition. The current street circuits are Monaco, Melbourne, Montreal, Singapore, Sochi and Azerbaijan although races in other urban locations {{come and go}} (Las Vegas and Detroit, for example) and proposals for such races are often discussed—most recently New Jersey. Several circuits have been completely laid out on public roads in the past, such as Valencia in Spain, though Monaco {{is the only one}} that remains. The glamour and history of the Monaco race are the primary reasons why the circuit is still in use, even though it does not meet the strict safety requirements imposed on other tracks.

2500|$|In literature, Fleetwood co-authored Fleetwood – My Life and Adventures with Fleetwood Mac with writer Stephen Davis, {{published}} by William Morrow & Co. in 1990.
