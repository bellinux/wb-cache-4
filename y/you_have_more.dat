500|$|In June 2007, Forward Edge, Inc. {{announced}} that Woolfolk {{had joined the}} company as its new business developer. The company stated {{at the time that}} Woolfolk would help the company's development and implementation of steroid testing for Texas high school athletes. At the time, Woolfolk said: [...] "There's a lot more to this than just passing a law. Kids are using steroids and they are doing so at dangerous levels. ... I've been there. I've watched it. Once you've watched it, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> of a commitment to get the kids off of the steroids. It's not just a business for me. It's a passion of mine." [...] Woolfolk remains active in the Houston football community as a Houston Texans ambassador. [...] Various ambassadors sign autographs at locations throughout Reliant Stadium during games.|$|E

In the footage, her stylist said that the {{inspiration}} for the video was [...] "trailer-trash, ghetto fabulous, out-there, [...] edgy." [...] During the footage Beyoncé said [...] "I like this video. It's no choreography, no pressure. All I have to do is party and have a good time." [...] She also revealed that the video is supposed to reflect her simplistic childhood, adding: [...] "Growing up, I had really amazing parents and I had a great childhood. We went from nicer homes to being in apartments with our lights cutting off. It didn't matter where we were 'cause we had love and we had so much fun. It's great when you don't have as much how you improvise and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> fun." ...|$|E

500|$|With three races {{remaining}} in the Championship and a fourteen-point advantage, Webber said he would continue his pursuit of the title; [...] "I need to keep racing hard and going for victories. Clearly, if my rivals have a rough weekend {{it makes it a}} bit harder for them and it gives me a bit more scope, but I'm not looking to abuse that because it can all go pear-shaped very fast." [...] Vettel said his season had been fraught with car problems but he remained positive about his chances; [...] "I think it's normal to have ups and downs – and sometimes <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>more,</b> sometimes less – but, as I said, the expectation was probably {{to be in a position}} to fight for the championship and I think we're in a very strong and very good position." [...] Alonso urged his teammate Massa to help him in his title bid and said the Korean Grand Prix could become [...] "decisive" [...] for his championship rivals. He favoured Hamilton to win the Korean Grand Prix. With Hamilton twenty-eight points behind Webber and with Button a further three points behind his teammate, McLaren's team principal Martin Whitmarsh said his drivers would keep their focus in the season's remaining three races and produce consistent performances. Karun Chandhok, who raced for Hispania in the first ten races of the season, said Red Bull were the favourites to win, and that he thought the circuit's three long straights would suit the McLaren cars.|$|E
500|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the 2008–09 NHL season, Panthers head coach Peter DeBoer, who first saw Horton play at seven years old, said about his hopes for Horton, [...] "If I'm looking for guys to do more, he wouldn't be at the top of the list. If he can give us 30-plus, I'd be happy with Nathan. There's a group of guys {{underneath}} him that I think can make a lot bigger jumps than I need out of Nathan Horton goal-wise." [...] Horton was also moved from his position of right wing to centre before the season. After playing a few games at centre, Horton said, [...] "It's not as easy as wing. You can play wing and all you have to concentrate on is getting the puck and shooting it. At center, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> responsibilities." [...] Against the Nashville Predators on November 1, Horton played in his 300th career game, but failed to record a point. On November 26, Horton suffered a deep cut in his leg after it was stepped on by a skate. At the time of the injury, Horton had 6 goals and 7 assists. In early December, the Ottawa Sun reported that the Panthers might have been looking to trade Horton after he was reportedly unhappy playing for the team. Horton returned to the lineup on December 17 after missing eight games. After the game, Horton commented, [...] "I'm excited to play. It's kind of a different Panthers team than the past. It's really changed in a matter of a month. Things are going good now, and everybody's really buying into what Pete has been telling us all year." [...] On January 17, Horton recorded 3 assists to help the Panthers defeat Tampa Bay, 43. For the second time during the season, Horton's name came up in trade rumours, this time with the Chicago Blackhawks. In early March, days after the trade deadline, Horton suffered a finger injury that forced him to have surgery. He returned to the lineup on March 23, recording an assist in a Panthers loss to the Carolina Hurricanes. Horton ended the season with 22 goals and 23 assists in 67 games.|$|E

2500|$|Blocked by the National Assembly, Louis-Napoleon {{decided to}} take a {{different}} route. in public he blamed Thiers and the Assembly for restricting the right to vote and for refusing to alter the Constitution for a second term, and secretly brought loyal army forces to Paris. Early in the morning of 2 December 1851, in {{what became known as the}} December 1851 coup d'état, the army took up positions in key positions in Paris, and at six a.m. the commissioner of police, Hubault, appeared at his residence at Place Saint-Georges and placed him under arrest. [...] "But don't you know the law?" [...] Thiers protested. [...] "Do you know that you're violating the Constitution?" [...] Hubault replied, [...] "I do not have the mission of discussing this with you, and moreover <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> knowledge than me." [...] A carriage took Thiers to Mazas Prison. From his jail cell he could hear the sound of gunfire as the soldiers loyal to Louis-Napoleon secured the city. On 9 December, he was transported to the German border and sent into exile.|$|E
