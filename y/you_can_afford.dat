500|$|Commander (originally {{known as}} Elder Dragon Highlander or EDH) is a casual format, {{but can be}} played competitively. In this format each player {{constructs}} a 100 singleton deck that has a legendary creature {{that acts as a}} commander. The deck construction is limited to the colors that are represented by the chosen commander and there cannot be two or more cards with the same name with the exception of basic lands. The legendary creature chosen as commander is kept in a special [...] "command zone" [...] and may be cast at any time <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> to cast the creature. If the commander card would enter any zone other than the battlefield from anywhere, its owner has the choice to return that card to the [...] "command zone", where it can be cast again for an additional two generic mana to its regular cost. The banned list and unique rules are governed by an [...] (not by Wizards of the Coast). [...] Wizards of the Coast releases [...] on a yearly basis.|$|E
500|$|In Buddhist texts {{further details}} {{are given in}} what way {{and to what extent}} a meritorious deed will bring results: this depends on the spiritual quality of the recipient, the spiritual {{attitude}} of the giver, the manner in which one gives and the object given. If the recipient is a human, the gift yields more fruits than if the recipient is an animal, but a gift to a [...] (a young monk), a monk, many monks, and the Buddha yield even more fruits, in ascending order. If the giver is motivated by greed or other defilements of the mind, the merit gained will be much less than if the giver is motivated by loving-kindness or other noble intentions. Even the intention of going to heaven, though in itself not considered wrong, is not seen as lofty as the intention to want to develop and purify the mind. If the recipient is spiritually [...] "not worthy of the gift", the gift will still be meritorious provided the giver's intention is good, and this is also valid the other way around. Good thoughts must also be maintained after the good deed is done, as regretting the gift will also decrease the merit. Whether the giver pronounces a certain wish or intention also affects the meritorious deed, as the power of the merits can be channeled toward a certain purpose. The manner in which people give is also important: whether someone gives respectfully or not, and whether by giving someone is harming anyone. With regard {{to the size of the}} gift, a larger gift is usually more meritorious than a smaller one, but purity of mind affects merit more than the gift's size. It is therefore recommended to give as much as <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>afford,</b> no more and no less. Such care in choosing who to give to and how to give, is called being 'skilled in merit' (...)

2500|$|New Testament {{discussion}} promotes {{giving and}} does not mention tithing. [...] talks about giving cheerfully, [...] encourages giving what <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>afford,</b> [...] discusses giving weekly (although this is a saved amount for Jerusalem), [...] exhorts supporting the financial needs of Christian workers, [...] promotes feeding the hungry wherever they may be and [...] states that pure religion is to help widows and orphans.|$|E
2500|$|In his 2015 book, Farage {{reflected}} {{that based on}} his experiences, [...] "the NHS is so over-stretched that if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> private health care, you should take it, particularly for diagnostics and preventative medicine. In the NHS, the system is so battered and poorly run that unless you are really lucky, you will fall through the cracks. The NHS is, however, astonishingly good at critical care. But what testicular cancer taught {{me is that the}} NHS will probably let you down if you need screening, fast diagnosis and an operation at a time that suits you". He supports reform within the NHS, saying that its resources have become stretched due to increased immigration, and blaming Labour for high costs of new hospitals built through private finance initiatives.|$|E
2500|$|A Senate {{report on}} {{intelligence}} failures would later detail the intense debate {{that went on}} behind the scenes on what to include in Powell's speech. State Department analysts had found dozens of factual problems in drafts of the speech. Some of the claims were taken out, but others were left in, such as claims based on the yellowcake forgery. The administration came under fire for having acted on faulty intelligence, particularly what was single-sourced to the informant known as Curveball. Powell later recounted how Vice President Dick Cheney had joked with him before he gave the speech, telling him, [...] "You've got high poll ratings; <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> to lose a few points." [...] Powell's longtime aide-de-camp and Chief of Staff from 1989–2003, Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson, later characterized Cheney's view of Powell's mission as to [...] "go up there and sell it, and we'll have moved forward a peg or two. Fall on your damn sword and kill yourself, and I'll be happy, too." ...|$|E
