50|$|The yellow-tailed {{woolly monkey}} {{is one of}} the least known of the primate species. It {{is also one of the}} largest neotropical primates. They are {{regularly}} found in the tropical Andes. Their habitat is characterized as rough terrain consisting of steep mountain sides and deep river gorges, with canopy heights of 20-25 m. Cloud forest, the habitat of this monkey, are in high altitudes and often have cloud coverage near or in them. The last estimated population count was less than 250 individuals. The current habitat of the yellow-tailed monkey is fragmented due to deforestation, as is the population. This can hinder reproduction, as it limits an already limited population. The <b>Yellow-Tailed</b> monkey has never been subject to a full census so exact numbers vary. A study was done to exam the population however the terrain and fragmented populations made this difficult.|$|R

5000|$|Pseudotropheus sp. [...] "acei" [...] (also {{known as}} <b>yellow-tail</b> acei) is a Mbuna cichlid from Lake Malawi that grows to around 7 in in length. Although known for many years, {{it has not}} been {{formally}} described. There are two different varieties: The most common yellow-tailed Pseudotropheus sp. [...] "acei" [...] (Msuli), and the white-tailed Pseudotropheus sp. [...] "acei" [...] (Ngara). Like most Mbuna, it dwells in shallower waters, however it will sometimes go near the surface, which is very uncommon for Mbunas. It is a very common fish for fish-keepers. It gets its common name from its blue body and yellow tail. Originally discovered in 1922 by Regan, the acei was originally believe to be a Pseudotropheus, but was later changed to Gephyrochromis and then back again. It prefers the sandy and rock filled shoreline where sunken logs are easily accessed. This species has developed the advantage of being able to harvest algae from submerged logs and roots. They are equipped with typical Gephyrochromid cuspid-like teeth that are flat for removing epixlyic or epilithic algae from wood. In the lake, schools of 30-50 individuals surrounding a large log are not uncommon, however in the rocky areas; schools usually consist of 3-10 individuals ...|$|E
50|$|The {{steep sides}} of the plateau cause deep-water {{currents}} to rise up {{when they hit the}} bank; this upwelling brings with it nutrients and minerals from the bottom, feeding the local ecosystem. Over 130 species from numerous classes of the animal kingdom call the bank home at least temporarily. Some such fish are the Atlantic cod, silver hake, <b>yellow-tail</b> flounder, blue-fin and yellow-fin tuna, striped bass, blue fish and numerous species of shark including the great white shark. Shellfish such as the American lobster, sea scallops, squid and ocean quahogs are also prevalent. Many marine birds call the bank home including gannets, shearwaters, storm petrels, fulmars, puffins and razorbills. Reptiles are even present, primarily being represented by the leatherback sea turtle. Possibly the most famous animals on Stellwagen Bank are the mammals. Five species of seals (harp seal, gray seal, harbor seal, hooded seal, and ringed seal), and numerous whale species swim in the waters of Stellwagen. Whale watchers can frequently see humpback whales, minke whales and fin whales. There are occasional sightings {{of one of the most}} critically endangered whale species, North Atlantic right whale. Several other whale species can also be seen here including the sperm whale, beluga, orca, pilot whale, White-beaked dolphin, Atlantic white-sided dolphin, common dolphin, bottlenose dolphin, Risso’s dolphin, harbor porpoise, blue whale, and sei whale.|$|E
40|$|Three {{kinds of}} fishes, mackerel, <b>yellow-tail</b> and bream {{were used as}} materials. Whole fishes were frozen in a sharp-freezer and stored in a cold box at - 10 and - 20 °C.

40|$|An {{attempt was}} made to {{determine}} the rate-constants for the decomposition of adenosine-phosphates (Adp), inosinic acids (IMP) and their combination, apparent IMP (App-IMP), in cold stored carp and <b>yellow-tail</b> muscle cubes. 1) Both the degradations of Adp and App-IMP were essentially of the first order and the degradation of IMP the consecutive first order. The rate-constants (k_a, k_i, and k_i’) could be estimated, using each rate-equation. 2) The rate-constants, k_a and k_i, varied with storage-temperature. Maximum values of IMP and the time required to reach them were also affected by the temperature. 3) The k_i’, rate-constant of App-IMP, was generally smaller than k_i, but the relative magnitude for different temperature in the former was approximated to that in the latter. Then, the application of above calculations may be of some use in discussing the relation of temperature to nucleotides-degradation. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to show the history of the {{management}} technology of marine aquaculture and the present problems of management technology. We have dealt with the <b>Yellow‐Tail</b> aquaculture, the Sea‐Bream aquaculture, the Kuruma‐Prawn aquaculture and Oyster aquaculture. The following results were obtained: (1) There were no new fishing grounds; (2) the fishing production exceeds the market demand; (3) senescence of fishiig grounds are going on; (4) Total production of the marine aquaculture in Japan has become stable over the last 5 years; (5) Now, only such phenomenon as the red tide and low oxygen mass is not the cause of a large depletion in the marine aquaculture. The environmental problems of the fishing grounds were simple in 1960 ‐ 1970 's. The main existing management technology were to change fishing grounds and feed. However, now the environmental problems of the fishing grounds has become complicated. Also, the existing management technology can not solve the problem of suivival rate, etc. After this, fishery associations need a framework for environmental risk management to reduce environmental impact from aquaculture systems. 本論文の目的は，海面養殖業における管理技術の歴史的過程を把握し，現段階での問題点を明らかにすること である。 本論文では主要海面養殖業であるプリ養殖業，マダイ養殖業，クルマエビ養殖業，カキ養殖業を取り上げた。 分析の結果，次のような結論が得られた。 1 ）新規漁場がない， 2 ）過剰生産となっている， 3 ）漁場老朽化が 進んでいる， 4 ）全国の養殖総生産量はここ 5 年間停滞している， 5 ）現在では，赤潮や低酸素水塊が直接の原 因である大量へい死は少ない。 1960 ～ 1970 年代の漁場環境問題は単純なものであり，これまでの主要な管理技術は新規漁場への転換や餌料転 換であった。しかし，現在の漁場環境問題は，複雑であり，歩留まりの低下等の問題は既存の管理技術では解決 が困難な状況にある。今後は，養殖業からの漁場環境へのインパクトを減らすために環境リスク管理が必要とな る...|$|E
40|$|Author abstract]By {{means of}} the <b>yellow-tail</b> which had been raised at Kinki University Fish. Inst. during the period between May, 1962 and August, 1963 and its faststicking gill trematode, we made {{experiments}} on how to exterminate the gill trematode. 1. So far as {{the density of the}} sea water with salt added to it by 6 ～ 1. 0 percent. at an average temperature is concerned, the thicker the density is, the sooner the gill trematode die out. When the sea water is as thick, the gill trematode die out most quickly at a high temperature of 23. 5 ℃～ 26 ℃, followed in the order of rapidity by at a lower temperature of 5. 1 ℃～ 6. 3 ℃, but die out most slowly at a temperature of 12. 7 ℃～ 12. 9 ℃, quite near the normal temperature. 2. In the normal sea water, the gill trematode have stronger resisting power at lower temperature than at higher ones. 3. It is quite impossible for us to destroy all the gill trematode of the <b>yellow-tail</b> in six or seven minutes by {{means of the}} salt water of the same den. sity as mentioned above, even when the water is adulterated with CuSO_ 4, Bitin or Negbon. 4. The best way of exterminating all the gill trematode is, we believer, to soak the fish thoroughly for several minutes in the sea water with salt added to it by 6 ～ 9 percent. 5. We had 50 ～ 60 yellow-tails put at a time into a cistern or a water tank with a capacity of 300 litres for 3 ～ 5 minutes which had been filled with 200 litres of the sea water with salt added to it by 6 ～ 8 percent., keeping the cistern supplied with fresh air. By repeating the same process five times, we contrived to get some quantity of the used solution replaced by a new one. Doing the same thing about ten times over enabled us to have all the used solution replaced by quite a new one. This done, we came to obtain a very good result of ridding the yellow-tails of their gill trematode.

In this study, carried out primarily in the 1980 s, we examined various aspects of life history for the nearshore rockfishes and for cabezon, kelp greenling, and lingcod off central California. The following species of rockfishes were those primarily considered within this study: black, black-and-yellow, blue, canary, China, copper, gopher, grass, green spotted, kelp, olive, rosy, starry, vermilion, yelloweye, and <b>yellow-tail.</b> During the study, 21 species of rockfish and 8 additional species of fish, including cabezon, kelp greenling, and lingcod, were tagged and released to study patterns of movement. Of 7332 tagged fish, 197 (3 %) representing 15 species, were recaptured. Of these, only three species (canary and yellowtail rockfishes and lingcod) manifested substantial movement. Most nearshore rockfishes appear to be highly residential. Age and growth parameters were determined for 15 species of rockfish. Whole otoliths were the primary structure utilized for ageing. Most nearshore rockfishes examined appear to have lifespans of moderate longevity, with maximum ages between 20 and 30 years. Weight-length relationships were calculated for 16 species of rockfish and for cabezon, kelp greenling, and lingcod. Reproductive patterns were determined for 18 species of rockfish and size at sexual maturation for 17 of these species. The majority of nearshore rockfishes appear to release larvae during the winter-spring period. However, timing of larval extrusion is species specific and must be examined on a case-by-case basis. General food habits were described for 11 species of rockfish. An Appendix, summarizing life-history characteristics for the 17 most commonly encountered species in this study, is included. We conclude that the nearshore rockfishes are a valuable marine resource to the State of California and should be managed with the realization that, as with many of the world's fishery resources, they are vulnerable to human impacts and over exploitation...|$|E
40|$|An unarmored chain-forming dinoflagellate Cochlodinium polykrikoides Margalef {{is one of}} {{important}} harmful red tide organisms causing mass mortality of cultured fish in western Japanese and southern Korean coastal waters. This species was first recognized in the Yatsushiro Sound in Kyushu, West Japan, in 1978 with serious economic damages to <b>yellow-tail</b> aquaculture industries. Thereafter this species has been continuously expanding its habitat and giving damages to aquaculture industries in coastal waters, mainly in the Kyushu. However, its biological characteristics such as optimum environmental conditions for reproduction and lifehistory are still unclear. Using clones of nine strains of C. polykrikoides isolated from coastalwaters Kyushu in 2002 - 2005, the growth rates of C. polykrikoides were examined in 60 different combinations of temperature (10 - 32. 5 °C) and salinity (16 - 36 psu) under a lightcondition of 80 μmol m- 2 s- 1 with a 14 h light and 10 h dark cycle. C. polykrikoides grew wellat a temperature range of 15 - 30 °C, a salinity range of 16 - 36 psu. The highest growth rate wasobtained in the combination of 25 - 27. 5 °C and 28 - 32 psu with the maximum growth rate (μm) of 0. 56 - 0. 64 day- 1. The effect of light intensity on the growth of C. polykrikoides was studied atseven different levels ranging from 10 to 140 jamol m- 2 s- 1 with 14 h: 10 h light: dark photo cycleat 25 °C. C. polykrikoides grew well at an irradiance of 20 umol m- 2 s- 1 and its growth wassaturated at 120 μmol m- 2 s- 1. The half-saturation constant {{for the growth of}} light intensity(Ks), μm and threshold value (I 0) were 29. 2 u. mol m- 2 s- 1, 0. 54 day- 1 and 4. 5 μmol m- 2 s- 1,respectively. According to incubation experiments, C. polykrikoides can form red tides at thewarm and high salinity environment. To understand an initial growth of this species, it isimportant to clarify the seasonal occurrence particularly low temperature periods. C,polykrikoidesccurred from February 2004 to March 2005 in Usuka Bay, west Kyushu. The highest cell densitywas recorded in September, with water temperature and salinity being about 25 °C and 33. 5 psu. From April of 2004 to March of 2005, the motile cells of C. polykrikoides were continuouslyobserved at the temperature range of 12. 3 - 27. 6 °C and salinity range of 32. 52 - 34. 40 psu. Thesefiled evidences suggest that C. polykrikoides can form red tides during warm water seasons withthe high salinity environment and its vegetative cells can be over winter in enclosed bays such asUsuka Bay in West Japan. 長崎大学学位論文　学位記番号:博(生) 甲第 83 号 博士（水産学） 学位授与年月日:平成 18 年 3 月 20...|$|E
