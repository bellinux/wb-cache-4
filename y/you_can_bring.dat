500|$|As the song's {{popularity}} {{continued to}} rise, it caused {{the share price}} of the song's music label YG Entertainment to gain as much as 50% on the Korea Exchange. DI Corporation, whose executive Chairman Park Won-Ho is Psy's father, saw its share price increase by 568.8% {{within a few months}} of the song's release despite making a year-over-year loss. Soon, [...] "Gangnam Style" [...] began {{to attract the attention of}} several business and political leaders, including UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon who recognized the song as a [...] "force for world peace". During his meeting with Psy at the United Nations Headquarters, he commented, [...] "We have tough negotiations in the United Nations. In such a case I was also thinking of playing Gangnam Style-dance so that everybody would stop and dance. Maybe <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>bring</b> UN style." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a post commemorating his {{birthday}} in 2011, blogger and literary critic Christy Potter called Updike [...] "...THE Writer, {{the kind of}} writer everyone has heard of, the one whose name <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>bring</b> up at a party {{and people who have}} never read one thing he wrote will still nod their heads knowingly and say, 'Oh yes, John Updike.

2500|$|Elizondo {{asked the}} band, [...] "What are {{the songs that}} only <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>bring?</b> What are the songs that only Switchfoot can deliver?" [...] And it was with that lens that the band chose the final track listing for Hello Hurricane. The {{inspiration}} for the album title comes from {{the story of a}} woman the band worked with during post-Hurricane Katrina who had lost her leg during the evacuation. [...] "Her statement was, 'I walked out of my old house, I'm gonna walk into this new one,'" [...] recalls Butler.|$|E
2500|$|On December 1, 2009, it was {{confirmed}} that Kelis had signed to Interscope Records through will.i.am Music Group, {{and that her}} then-untitled fifth studio album featured production from will.i.am, Free School, Boys Noize, Burns, DJ Ammo, and David Guetta. She played the album to a few record labels before choosing will.i.am's label. [...] "I think that he's brilliant", Kelis said of will.i.am. [...] "As far as this generation goes, there's not a single song that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>bring</b> up to him or a reference or an artist or an era of music that he is not privy to or that he doesn't understand. [...] He's not afraid to push the limits and kinda go further than everyone else and that's exciting. He still seems to be having fun doing it and that's what it's all about." [...] In response, will.i.am said, [...] "Kelis represents the kind of edge that pushes all of us not just musically but stylistically as well. She has always opened new doors for her audience and we're ready to walk through this next one with her." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sun Ce told Taishi Ci, [...] "In the past, when Liu Yao criticised me {{for helping}} Yuan Shu conquer Lujiang, he didn't have good {{intentions}} and his reasons were not convincing. Why? Yuan Shu had {{control over the}} thousands of troops {{which used to be}} under my father's command. I wanted to make great achievements, so I {{had no choice but to}} submit to Yuan Shu and ask him to give me control of my father's troops. Even then, he only gave me back about 1,000 men. When he ordered me to attack Lujiang, the circumstances I was in were so desperate that I had no choice but to obey him. Later on, he turned evil and wanted to commit treacherous acts. I tried to dissuade him but he wouldn't listen. That was when I decided to sever ties with him. My relationship with Yuan Shu is only up to this extent. Now that Liu Yao is dead, there is no chance for me to explain to him anymore. However, his son still lives in Yuzhang. I don't know how Hua Ziyu treats him, and whether Liu Yao's former followers have decided to serve Hua Ziyu. You are from the same commandery as Liu Yao, and you served under him before. I hope you can visit his son and convey my wishes to his followers. If they wish to join me, I will welcome them; if they don't, do treat them kindly. At the same time, you can assess how strong Hua Ziyu's defences are, and see if the peoples of Luling and Poyang are willing to join me. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>bring</b> along as many men as you wish." [...] Taishi Ci replied, [...] "I have committed unpardonable acts. Yet, you treat me as generously as how Duke Huan of Qi and Duke Wen of Jin treated former enemies who surrendered to them. The ancients lived by a code of loyalty until death. I don't need too many men to accompany me. Just a dozen or so will be sufficient." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'What do I think? Why, {{that your}} idea is capital, and you shall {{be rewarded for}} it. Come, guards, hurry as fast as <b>you</b> <b>can</b> and <b>bring</b> the seventh Simon before me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If more {{is needed}} to {{convince}} <b>you,</b> I <b>can</b> <b>bring</b> a hundred witnesses from France, who have known me from infancy. You may take it that I can establish my identity beyond all doubt." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You know <b>you</b> <b>can</b> always <b>bring</b> Benny. There's {{plenty of}} room for both of you in your bed. But now when you go back with him be careful of the lamp.

6000|$|... "A Commissary Court business," [...] {{said the}} writer, going off again upon a false scent.
