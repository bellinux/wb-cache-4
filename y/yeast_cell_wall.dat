Isolation of wall-decomposing {{organisms and}} separation and purification of lytic enzymes. J.

A bacterium, identified as Bacillus circulans, and a species of Streptomyces produced clear, lysed zones when grown on an agar medium containing baker's <b>yeast</b> <b>cell</b> <b>walls.</b> The streptomycete formed glucanase, mannanase, and protease, but B. circulans produced only glucanases.

Twelve other carbon sources were ineffective as inducers. Among a number of polysaccharides tested, the crude enzymes of B. circulans hydrolyzed only β- 1 → 3 glucan (laminarin) and β- 1 → 6 glucan (pustulan), both by a random mechanism, to a mixture of dimer and glucose. The β- 1 → 3 and β- 1 → 6 glucanases were separated from each other by diethylaminoethyl cellulose column chromatography. Water-soluble oat glucan, which contains in the linear chain both β- 1 → 3 and β- 1 → 4 bonds, was also hydrolyzed by the bacterial β- 1 → 3 glucanase.

Eosinophils were attracted to and readily engulfed such diverse materials as <b>yeast</b> <b>cell</b> <b>walls,</b> foreign erythrocytes, and antigen-antibody precipitates.

40|$|According to {{different}} studies, yeast cell walls can positively influence the performance parameters, the intestinal microbiota and immune reaction of animals. However, {{the results of}} the different studies are inconstant. Differences seem to be dependent on origin of the yeast sources, production processes and amounts of β-glucans and MOS in the different <b>yeast</b> <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> preparations. This study was conducted to investigate whether a <b>yeast</b> <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> product can carry out dose-dependent effects on animal performance, the composition and activity of the intestinal microbiota, the immune system and the nutrient digestibility in broiler chickens. For that purpose one day-old male broiler chickens (Cobb Germany Avimex GmbH) were divided into two consecutive trial runs and samples were taken during {{as well as at the}} end of the 35 -day-lasting fattening period for immunological, microbiological and digestibility analysis. All animals received as diet a starter (d 1 - 14) and grower mixture (d 15 - 35) based on soybean meal, maize and wheat. Four experimental groups were fed the product Immunowall® in rising concentrations (0. 05 %, 0. 10 %, 0. 20 % and 0. 30 %) over the whole fattening period, while the fifth experimental group served as control. Seventeen broiler chickens per floor pen each representing a single experimental unit. The animals received water and feed ad libitum. The performance parameters were recorded weekly. On day 21 the animals were orally vaccinated against NDV and blood samples were taken directly before as well as seven and 13 days after the vaccination for the quantification of the antibody titer against NDV, the determination of the phagocytic acitivity of the monocytes and complete blood counts. At the end of each trial run one broiler chicken from each experimental unit was slaughtered. To quantificate the lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, enterobacteria and Escherichia/Hafnia/Shigella spp. digesta samples were taken from the crop, ileum and caeca. These samples were also used for the measurement of the pH-value and the determination of the bacterial metabolites. Digesta from the duodenum were collected to measure the intestinal IgA concentration. Thymus, spleen and bursa fabricii were removed and weighed to determine the relative organ weights. In order to examine the effect of the <b>yeast</b> <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> product on the nutrient digestibility, five animals of each experimental unit were randomly selected, slaughtered and samples of the ileum were collected to determine the dry matter content and the apparent ileal digestibility of protein, fat and starch on day 36. All collected data were analyzed by using a one-factorial analysis of variance or a Kruskal-wallis-test as well as a polynomial contrast analysis. The <b>yeast</b> <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> product had an impact on the performance parameters. Chicken fed the <b>yeast</b> <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> product showed dose-dependent effects on the body weight in the second and third week of age (p = 0. 029 and p = 0. 089). This was reflected in a better feed conversion ratio in the third week of age (p = 0. 083). In the last two weeks of the fattening period the chickens of the control and the experimental group, which were fed 0. 05 % of the <b>yeast</b> <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> product showed a higher body weight gain in the analysis of variance and contrast analysis and tended to have a better feed conversion ratio in the linear contrast analysis in the last week. The feed intake in the first seven days of age was higher (p = 0. 002) and the feed conversion ratio tended to be lower (p = 0. 081) in the experimental group, which received 0. 30 % of the <b>yeast</b> <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> product. Over the whole fattening period there were no differences regarding the performance parameters between the five experimental groups. Concerning the quantification of the different bacteria species, only the concentration of the lactobacilli was different between the experimental groups (p = 0. 027). A positive dose-dependent effect was detected for the lactobacilli in the digesta of the crop and ileum in the experimental groups with the <b>yeast</b> <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> supplementation. Similar trends were observed regarding the lactate and acetic acid concentration in the digesta of the crop and ileum. Inverse dose-dependent effects were noticed in the pH-value of the crop digesta. The ammonia concentration in the crop, ileum and caeca were not affected by the addition of the <b>yeast</b> <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> product. The concentration of propionic acid was reduced in the experimental group, which received 0. 30 % of the <b>yeast</b> <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> product in contrast to the groups with the addition of 0. 05 % and 0. 10 % of the <b>yeast</b> <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> product (p = 0. 047). The relative immune organ weights, the intestinal IgA concentration, the phagocytic acitivity of the monocytes, the antibody titer against NDV as well as the concentrations of the monocytes and heterophils in the blood of the broiler chickens were not affected by the addition of the <b>yeast</b> <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> product, whereas the concentrations of the lymphoyctes in the blood were numerically higher at all three collection time points. Furthermore, the lymphocytes and the T- and B-lymphocytes were partly tendentially and significantly higher on day 28 and 34 in the experimental groups with the addition of the <b>yeast</b> <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> product. Neither the dry matter content of the ileum digesta nor the apparent ileal digestibility of fat and starch were affected by the <b>yeast</b> <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> product. In contrast, the apparent ileal digestibility of protein tended to be higher in the supplemented groups. To conclude, the results illustrate that the addition of the <b>yeast</b> <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> product had a dose-dependent impact on the performance parameters, the composition and acitivity of the intestinal microbiota, the adaptive immune system and the apparent ileal digestibility ofprotein in healthy broiler chickens. The results indicate that the <b>yeast</b> <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> product could be used to improve the immune response, the composition and activity of the intestinal microbiota and the performance parameters in the first three weeks of age of the chickens. It should be clarified, how far the addition of the <b>yeast</b> <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> product can be used in broiler chickens under less favourable housing conditions in order to improve the health and performance of the animals...|$|E
40|$|The {{use of a}} <b>yeast</b> <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> extract {{derived from}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Actigen(®)) has been {{proposed}} {{as an alternative to}} in-feed antibiotics. This experiment was conducted to investigate the efficacy of yeast cell extract as an alternative to zinc bacitracin or salinomycin using a necrotic enteritis challenge model. A feeding study was conducted using 480 -day-old male Ross 308 chicks assigned to 48 floor pens. A 2 × 4 factorial arrangement of treatments was employed. The factors were: challenge (- or +) and feed additive (control, zinc bacitracin at 100 / 50 mg/kg, <b>yeast</b> <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> extract at 400 / 800 / 200 mg/kg, or salinomycin at 60 mg/kg in starter, grower, and finisher, respectively). Diets based on wheat, sorghum, soybean meal, meat and bone meal, and canola meal were formulated according to the Ross 308 nutrient specifications. Birds were challenged using a previously established protocol (attenuated Eimeria spp oocysts) on d 9 and 10 (8) to 10 (9) Clostridium perfringens (type A strain EHE-NE 18) on d 14 and 15). Challenged and unchallenged birds were partitioned to avoid cross contamination. Challenged birds had lower weight gain, feed intake and livability compared to unchallenged birds on d 24 and d 35 (P < 0. 05). Birds given zinc bacitracin, <b>yeast</b> <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> extract, or salinomycin had improved weight gain and livability when compared to control birds given no additives. Challenge × additive interactions were observed for feed intake and weight gain on d 24 and d 35 (P < 0. 01). The additives all had a greater positive impact on feed intake, weight gain, and livability in challenged than unchallenged birds. All challenged birds showed higher necrotic enteritis lesion scores in the small intestine sections when compared to unchallenged birds (P < 0. 01). Birds fed <b>yeast</b> <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> extract exhibited increased villus height, decreased crypt depth, and increased villus:crypt ratio when challenged. <b>Yeast</b> <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> extract, zinc bacitracin, and salinomycin were effective in preventing performance decline from necrotic enteritis in the current study. This study indicates that <b>yeast</b> <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> extract has promise as a tool for controlling necrotic enteritis. Shawkat A.

40|$|Transglycosylases have an import {{function}} in <b>yeast</b> the <b>cell</b> <b>wall.</b> These enzymes cleave a molecule of donor, which {{is followed by}} transferring a newly created reducing end to a non-reducing end of a molecule of an acceptor. This process enables a growth, expansion and shaping of the <b>yeast</b> <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> during their life. The aim of this Bachelor Thesis is to characterise the role of Phr 2 recombinant protein of Candida albicans in a transglycosylase activity. Using fluorescent paper method, optimal pH and optimal temperature of transglycosylase activity of Phr 2 protein were found. The same method was used to establish the acceptor and donor specificity of Phr 2 p was performed as another method for substrate specificity measurement. High donor and acceptor specificity of Phr 2 protein to - 1, 3 -glucan was confirmed. HPLC products of transglycosylase reaction catalysed by Phr 2 p with laminarin as a donor and L 5 -SR as an acceptor containing a fluorescent marker were detected by TLC and MALDI-TOF...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The fungal <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> confers <b>cell</b> {{morphology}} {{and protection}} against environmental insults. For fungal pathogens, the <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> {{is a key}} immunological modulator and an ideal therapeutic target. <b>Yeast</b> <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> possess an inner matrix of interlinked -glucan and chitin that is thought to provide tensile strength and rigidity. <b>Yeast</b> <b>cells</b> remodel their <b>walls</b> over time in response to environmental change, a process controlled by evolutionarily conserved stress (Hog 1) and cell integrity (Mkc 1, Cek 1) signal-ing pathways. These mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways modulate <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> gene expression, leading to the con-struction of a new, modified <b>cell</b> <b>wall.</b> We show that the <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> is not rigid but elastic, displaying rapid structural realignments that impact survival following osmotic shock. Lactate-grown Candida albicans cells are more resistant to hyperosmotic shock than glucose-grown cells. We show that this elevated resistance is not dependent on Hog 1 orMkc 1 signaling and that most cell death occurs within 10 min of osmotic shock. Sudden decreases in cell volume drive rapid increases in <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> thickness. The elevated stress resistance of lactate-grown cells correlates with reduced <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> elasticity, reflected in slower changes in cell vol-ume following hyperosmotic shock. The <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> elasticity of lactate-grown cells is increased by a triple mutation that inactivates the Crh family of <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> cross-linking enzymes, leading to increased sensitivity to hyperosmotic shock. Overexpressing Cr...|$|R
40|$|When {{inserted}} in the correct orientation at the BamHI site of plasmid YRp 7, an 8. 6 -kilobase BamHI fragment of Arthrobacter sp. strain YCWD 3 DNA gave Escherichia coli HB 101 cells harboring the recombinant plasmid pBX 20 the ability to lyse bakers' <b>yeast</b> <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> or bakers' <b>yeast</b> glucan in agar medium. An extract of the transformed E. coli cells contained an endo-beta-(1 [...] 3) -glucanase with the same activity pattern as that of glucanase I produced by Arthrobacter sp. strain YCWD 3. Although part of the glucanase activity was contributed by apparently defective molecules, two protein species were found which had high lytic activity on <b>yeast</b> <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> and adsorbed to microcrystalline cellulose, and both had a single constituent polypeptide with a molecular weight of about 55, 000, as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In these properties the protein species were indistinguishable from those glucanase I protein species of Arthrobacter sp. strain YCWD 3 which we believe are nearly the intact molecule. We conclude that the cloned fragment of Arthrobacter sp. strain YCWD 3 DNA contains the structural gene for glucanase I. A recombinant plasmid obtained by subcloning a PstI fragment of pBX 20 into pBR 322 caused the transformed E. coli cells to produce apparently defective glucanase molecules only. This observation serves as additional supporting evidence for our conclusion...|$|R
