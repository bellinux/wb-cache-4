When Hutch asks {{him if he had}} ever heard of the archery-champion-turned-actor Howard Hill, Dillon replies: [...] "I don't think so... <b>You</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> Zhou Tong".

Later in chapter fifty, while Hutch is trailing a killer through an airport, a page goes out over the intercom system for a [...] "Mr. Zhou Tong".

2500|$|Byrd {{served in}} the Senate Democratic leadership. He succeeded George Smathers as {{secretary}} of the Senate Democratic Conference from 1967 to 1971. He unseated Ted Kennedy in 1971 to become majority whip, or the second highest-ranking Democrat, until 1977. Smathers recalled that, [...] "Ted was off playing. While Ted was away at Christmas, down in the islands, floating around having a good time with some of his friends, male and female, here was Bob up here calling on the phone. 'I want to do this, and would you help me?' He had it all committed so that when Teddy got back to town, Teddy didn't know what hit him, but it was already all over. That was Lyndon Johnson's style. Bob Byrd learned that from watching Lyndon Johnson." [...] Byrd himself had told Smathers that [...] " [...] I have never in my life played a game of cards. I have never in my life had a golf club in my hand. I have never in life hit a tennis ball. I have—believe it or not—never thrown a line over to catch a fish. I don't do any of those things. I have only had to work all my life. And every time <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> swimming, I don't know how to swim." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, mother, I {{thought as}} <b>you</b> had <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> all the beauty places in Thrums, and <b>you</b> ain't never <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> the Den." ...|$|R
60|$|TREHERNE. Man alive, <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> all <b>about</b> it {{soon after}} we were wrecked.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, but <b>you</b> haven't <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> the schools,' said Gillian, in elder sisterly propriety, {{thinking}} the subject {{had better be}} abandoned.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you mean}} that piece about your picture--that <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> when you went with him again to see it?" [...] Delia demanded.|$|E
6000|$|... "'I see,' the {{stranger}} might say by this time, 'that {{there is a}} great difference among these boys; have <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> them all?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] said Susan; [...] "I {{remember}} his picture on your bureau at Sutcliffe. He {{had such a}} good face. And <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> nothing <b>about</b> it," [...] Kendricks replied, {{leaning forward}} with interest. [...] "What {{sort of an}} offer? Go on, tell <b>me</b> <b>about</b> it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Do {{you mean}} to say,' I demanded, 'that you {{have the nerve to}} come back to Sanstead after what <b>you</b> have <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> yourself?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Slidder," [...] said I, as {{we turned}} {{down into the}} mean-looking alley where Mrs Willis, my little old woman, dwelt, [...] "I am greatly {{interested}} in what <b>you</b> have <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> my little dog, and I am interested still more in what <b>you</b> have <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> yourself. Now, I {{want you to do}} me a favour. I wish you to go with me to visit an old woman, and, after that, to walk home with me--part of the way, at least." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Before <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> him, Mr. Medlin, I {{should have}} thought it would quite spoil the holiday. But I do not feel it so bad, now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is always}} the girl," [...] Mr. Waddington reflected. [...] "The girl with the blue eyes, I suppose, whom <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about?</b> The girl of the garden?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... [Taking his hand.] Good-bye, John. You're {{not angry}} with me because I was horrid.... I'm glad <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> his wife. Now I shall know what to do.|$|E
6000|$|Her brother puffed {{his cigar}} again in silence. [...] "These {{delicate}} qualities have survived his vicissitudes, eh? All this while <b>you</b> haven't <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> his misfortunes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And I don't regret it,' said Mr. Barkis. 'Do you {{remember}} what <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> once, <b>about</b> her making all the apple parsties and doing all the cooking?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't think I am; I've {{been told}} I'm not; I'm {{said to have}} too many theories. But <b>you</b> haven't <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> the ghost," [...] she added.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, well," [...] said Lawrence, [...] "I suppose I {{wanted to}} recall the thing {{and see how it}} looked in the light of what <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> your {{exploits}} in Scotland." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, I won't tell him, anyway. But I'm glad <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> him. Dudley was so eloquent about burglars that {{he almost}} had me going. I wonder where he rushed off to?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I think I know to {{what you}} refer, Phil," [...] cried Dave, quickly. [...] "I {{remember}} now that <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> your old Uncle Lester. Didn't you ever hear from him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a good thing, Phil, {{that you}} knew Mr. Cameron," [...] said Dave, on the way. [...] "But <b>you</b> never <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> {{stopping}} a runaway horse for Mrs. Cameron." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear, dear," [...] sighed my mother; [...] "how many {{compounds}} <b>you</b> have <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about,</b> Jeff, since <b>you</b> took to chemistry! Are {{there no}} uncompounded things--no simple {{things in the}} world?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he observed, [...] "I'm glad <b>you</b> have <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> the thing; but I'm {{somewhat}} {{surprised that}} you didn't {{realize that you}} could have disarmed Nevis--and freed yourself--by mentioning it earlier." ...|$|R
6000|$|It was {{moreover}} as if, thus unprecedentedly positive, {{his child}} {{had an effect}} upon him that Mr. Verver really felt as a new thing. [...] "Why then haven't <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> her before?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nevertheless," [...] I added, as I {{paid the}} bill, [...] "I {{have really been}} profoundly {{interested}} in what <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> the New Shaving. Have {{you ever heard of}} a thing called the New theology?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Plain, indeed," [...] Penelope assented, and {{she spoke}} in a low tone because there was fear in her heart. [...] "Why have <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> them? They throw a new light upon everything,--an awful light!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Clara now recurred {{to these}} {{words of his}} as she sat looking at him through her tears across the breakfast table. [...] "Was that the reason <b>you</b> never <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> poor Ben before?" ...|$|R
6000|$|There {{was also}} another curious {{point about the}} man. Once {{in the course of}} some quarrel the sailor {{threatened}} him: [...] "What's to prevent me reporting ashore what <b>you</b> have <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> that silver?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Carl's scalp tickled, but {{he tried}} to be very offhand in remarking: [...] "You must have gotten that dress in New York, didn't you? Why haven't <b>you</b> ever <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> New York? You've hardly <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{anything}} at all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] she answered. [...] "Besides, <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> it, did you not, {{yesterday}} afternoon? I {{know one}} of his sisters quite well, and I {{was looking forward to}} seeing something of him down here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do as {{you feel}} right at the moment," [...] said Ermine, after a moment's pause. [...] "I cannot tell how it may be. I have been {{thinking}} over what <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> the Major and Lady Temple." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> it. I {{found him}} useful here, {{especially}} when I wanted the place cleared; {{but it would}} not do, he broke one fellow's shoulder throwing him out, and it was getting me a bad name.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am mad, Lady Lundie. You {{bear with}} mad people. Bear with me. I have been {{hardly more than}} a {{fortnight}} married. I love him--I love her--with all my heart. Remember what <b>you</b> have <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> them. Remember! remember! remember!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Several of {{the things}} <b>you</b> have <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> your life in Canada {{interest}} me. It must have been bracing to feel that you depended upon your own efforts and stood on your own feet, free from the hampering customs that are common here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was a gallant action indeed, uncle. <b>You</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{something}} <b>about</b> it {{soon after}} I came here, when I happened {{to ask you}} how it was that you walked so stiffly, but you did not tell it so fully. And what {{is he going to}} do now?" ...|$|R
