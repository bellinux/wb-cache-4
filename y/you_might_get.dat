2500|$|Hall of Fame player Larry Bird, who is white, {{stated in}} 2004 {{that the league}} needed more white players since the league's fans are mostly white. [...] "And if you just {{had a couple of}} white guys in there, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> them [...] a little excited. But it is a black man's game, and it will be forever. I mean, the {{greatest}} athletes in the world are African-American," [...] said Bird.|$|E
2500|$|In a 2014 {{review for}} Uncut, Richard Williams said {{that just as}} the Beatles' fan-club Christmas records were {{inspired}} by the Goons, Harrison's inspiration for Electronic Sound {{appears to have been}} [...] "another BBC institution of their formative years: the Radiophonic Workshop". According to Williams, the album conveys [...] "the joy of a boy with a new toy" [...] and [...] "sounds like what <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> if you taped a contact microphone to the stomach of a digestively challenged robot". He concluded by saying that the self-deprecating sleeve note from Arthur Wax [...] "still sums it up". Scott Elingburg of PopMatters welcomed its Apple Years reissue and described the album as the artist's [...] "most 'experimental' work" [...] and, like the remastered Wonderwall Music, [...] "raw and gorgeous, alive and capable of sparking ingenuity". He said that while Harrison was [...] "no Brian Eno or Jeff Lynne" [...] in terms of synthesizer innovation, [...] "the intention behind Electronic Sound is one of exploration and discovery, an artist limbering up his musical mind to discover how far the boundaries of modern instrumentation could take him. Out of context, Electronic Sound would sound maudlin, even dull. Here, as a key step in the progression of Harrison the solo artist, it sounds audacious in its primitiveness ..." ...|$|E

5000|$|Never utter foul or vulgar {{words or}} <b>you</b> <b>might</b> risk <b>getting</b> your baby cursed.|$|R
6000|$|... “I understand. I’ve {{been too}} much of a comrade. But if I were very patient, <b>you</b> <b>might,</b> perhaps, <b>get</b> to like me in the other way?” ...|$|R
5000|$|Various ukay-ukay {{stores in}} Bag-ong Lungsod {{is a good}} place to shop for second hand fashion items. Befriend the saleslady and <b>you</b> <b>might</b> just <b>get</b> a discount.|$|R
6000|$|... "On the rest," [...] {{declared}} Shackleby, coolly. [...] "We {{would pay}} down the money now, and advance you enough on interest to place you beyond all risks in completing operations. Though <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> more for the land, without this assistance, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> nothing, {{and it will be}} a pretty heavy check. I suppose I needn't say it was not until lately that we decided to meet you this way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] replied Forester, [...] "I don't {{think you}} would; but <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> killed. The risk {{would be too}} great for the benefit." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I was {{so afraid}} one of <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> shot or something," [...] said Mrs. Rover. [...] "Some of those, {{chickens}} thieves are desperate characters." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{are giving}} you {{a great deal of}} trouble," [...] said Billy. [...] "You must be losing money over this job. All this while <b>you</b> <b>might</b> be <b>getting</b> fares down-town." ...|$|R
5000|$|Vento {{said that}} no one has been refused service for not {{speaking}} English, but said, [...] "If I can't understand <b>you,</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> not <b>get</b> the sandwich you thought you ordered." ...|$|R
60|$|BENNET. I thought I {{would let}} you know he had arrived, in case <b>you</b> <b>might</b> be <b>getting</b> anxious about him. I propose giving him a glass of beer and sending him away again.|$|R
6000|$|... "What! By Jove, nor he is. That's queer. All {{the better}} for us. <b>You</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> a bit finer, Challis, in case they snick 'em." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "People don't allers pay {{cash for}} what they buy. <b>You</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> it {{for two or three}} hundred dollars down, with a {{mortgage}} for the balance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'I think <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> away,' I whispered back. 'I {{will cut}} your bonds. When you are free, {{slip through the}} window and I will guide you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just {{a prairie}} fire," [...] he replied,--"very dangerous, though, these dry seasons. The flames move {{so quickly that}} {{if you happen to}} be in a certain {{position}} <b>you</b> <b>might</b> easily <b>get</b> cut off." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We thought <b>you</b> <b>might</b> {{possibly}} <b>get</b> {{an offer}} from Porton or Crapsey, or both of them, to return the miniatures for a certain amount," [...] went on Dave. [...] "But you say no such offer has come in?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, then? Don't <b>you</b> {{think we}} <b>might</b> hear him again? Don't <b>you</b> think we <b>might</b> <b>get</b> {{him to play}} for us?--But I should love it more than anything." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{depends upon}} the size. We pay seven shillings a week, but <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> one without the kitchen and bedroom over it behind for six shillings." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I {{think that}} <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> {{your heart out}} of that grave," [...] said he, with playful sadness. [...] "It has been there a long time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Colonel Ray {{was telling}} me," [...] she said, [...] "how unfortunate {{you have been}} with your pupils. I wonder--don't you think perhaps that <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> some others?" ...|$|E
60|$|And {{so there}} was such a {{jam-making}} as had never been seen before, and if you like to go and help in it, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> perhaps <b>get</b> a little, for they must surely be making jam still to this very day.|$|R
6000|$|... "I agree, {{something}} should be done," [...] said the captain. [...] "Perhaps {{you had better}} go to the nearest telegraph office, Richard, and telegraph to your folks. <b>You</b> <b>might</b> also <b>get</b> {{some of the local}} authorities to take up the hunt for this criminal." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But consider, Bee," [...] said Henrietta, [...] "how {{much too}} tall I am for a fairy. It {{would be too}} absurd to make Titania as large as Bottom himself--spoil the whole picture. <b>You</b> <b>might</b> surely <b>get</b> some little girls to be the other fairies, and take Titania yourself." ...|$|R
60|$|MRS O'FLAHERTY [as {{she comes}} from the porch]. Oh, it's a shame for you to keep the girl from her juties, Dinny. <b>You</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> her into trouble.|$|E
6000|$|... "Be careful, Larry," [...] {{warned the}} captain. [...] "If a case should shift {{with the ship}} <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> a crushed leg. You had better take a candle along." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I hate {{to think}} of you all {{battered}} up," [...] she temporized. [...] "If I didn't love you so, it might be different. And then, too, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> hurt." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And I think <b>you</b> <b>might</b> {{chance to}} <b>get</b> a proper good licking for not holding your tongue," [...] said Norman, which hint reduced Harry to silence.|$|R
60|$|Fuzzy was drunk--not riotously or helplessly or loquaciously, as <b>you</b> or I <b>might</b> <b>get,</b> but decently, appropriately, and inoffensively, as {{becomes a}} gentleman {{down on his}} luck.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{seems to}} me," [...] she said, [...] "that {{where there are}} so many of you in the same boat, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> manage to <b>get</b> ashore somehow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Did {{you read}} the {{description}} {{of them in the}} Quarterly? I am sure <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> some ideas there. Shall I find it for you? It is in an old number." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, lad, that wouldn't do; though I {{thank you}} for your offer. <b>You</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> a ship back to England, but I should have very little chance of getting one for France." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your chances don't {{look very}} good," [...] Graham agreed. [...] "If you could cross the range {{to the park}} valley, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> away south, but I doubt if you could make it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The captain thinks <b>you</b> <b>might</b> {{manage to}} <b>get</b> aft now. I will send Bill and Dick Whistler with you, {{to help you}} move any boxes or bales." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Phew! {{that is too}} bad. Well, I wouldn't {{sit down}} to mope about it. <b>You</b> <b>might</b> as well <b>get</b> to work and earn the amount over again." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{question}} {{seemed to}} amuse Ovid. [...] "If Doctor Benjulia had a wife, <b>you</b> think we <b>might</b> <b>get</b> at his secrets? There {{is no such}} chance for us--he manages his domestic affairs for himself." ...|$|R
