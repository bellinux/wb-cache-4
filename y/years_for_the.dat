5|$|Along {{with the}} Lundy cabbage, Psylliodes luridipennis has been {{listed in the}} United Kingdom Biodiversity Action Plan, and an action plan for its {{conservation}}, along with the conservation of other endemic species, has been prepared.

Though it is quicker than P. napi to recolonise new growth after bad <b>years</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> cabbage, it is slower to recover than the cabbage itself.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{high-profile}} start of Henry's cultus, {{it took more}} than 100 <b>years</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> veneration of Saint Henry to gain widespread acceptance throughout Sweden. As of 1344 there were no relics of the bishop in the Cathedral of Uppsala. According to one biographer, Henry's veneration was rare outside the Diocese of Turku throughout the 14th century. Vadstena Abbey near Linköping seems to have {{played a key role in}} establishment of Henry's legend elsewhere in Sweden in the early 15th century. Henry never received the highest totum duplex veneration in Uppsala nor was he made a patronus of the church there, which status he had both in Turku and Nousiainen.|$|E
