The party had {{characterized}} the main railway union of the time, Unión Ferroviaria, as a <b>yellow</b> <b>union.</b> Until 1927 all FSF general secretaries and joint secretaries were Communist Party cadres; Florindo Moretti, Luis Cechini and José Morales.|$|E

5000|$|The first <b>yellow</b> <b>union</b> in France, the Fédération {{nationale}} des Jaunes de France ("National Federation of the Yellows of France") {{was created}} by Pierre Biétry in 1902. The yellow color was deliberately chosen {{in opposition to the}} red color associated with socialism. Yellow unions, in opposition to red unions such as the Confédération Générale du Travail, rejected class struggle and favored the collaboration of capitaland labor, and were opposed to strikes. According to Zeev Sternhell, the <b>yellow</b> <b>union</b> of Biétry had a membership of about a third of that of the Confédération Générale du Travail, and was funded by corporate interests. Moreover, also according to Sternell, there were close relationships between Pierre Biétry and Maurice Barrès and the Action Française. This makes the <b>yellow</b> <b>union</b> of Biétry seem a precursor of fascist corporatism. During the Nazi occupation of France, unions were banned and replaced by corporations organized along the fascist model by the Vichy Regime. The labor secretary of Philippe Pétain's administration from 1940 to 1942 was René Belin. After the war, René Belin was involved in 1947 with the creation of the Confédération du Travail indépendant (CTI), renamed Confédération Générale des Syndicats Indépendants (CGSI) in 1949 as the original acronym was already used by Confédération des Travailleurs intellectuels. The movement was joined by former members of the Confédération des syndicats professionnels français, a union created by François de La Rocque in 1936. The CGSI declared that it was formed by [...] "des hommes d’origine et de formation différentes qui se sont trouvés d’accord pour dénoncer la malfaisance de la CGT communisée" [...] (men of different origins who agreed to denounce the malfeasance of the communist CGT). CGSI developed mostly in the automobile industry, for instance in the Simca factory of Poissy.|$|E

However, in {{the absence}} of clear and stringent rules on the representativeness of social partners and without a national minimum wage, “pirate agreements” with <b>yellow</b> <b>unions</b> are legal as far as they respect the procedural requirements of the law (see Tomassetti, 2016 for the case of Italy).|$|R
5000|$|Officially {{founded on}} 1 May 1925. The Second National Labour Congress convened in Guangzhou with 277 delegates {{representing}} 540,000 workers and adopted the Constitution of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. Between 1922 and 1927, the organization flourished, {{as did the}} Communist Party of China’s control over the trade union movement. The labour movement had grown enormously, particularly in the three industrial and commercial centres of Guangzhou, Hong Kong and Shanghai, but it also had some organizational success in other cities, such as Wuhan. [...] The ACFTU was restricted in 1927 by the newly established rule of the Nationalist regime under Chiang Kai-shek ordering the execution of thousands of CPC cadres and trade unionists. All CPC-led unions were banned and replaced with <b>yellow</b> <b>unions</b> loyal to him.|$|R
5000|$|On 15 November 1918 {{he signed}} the Stinnes-Legien-Agreement with {{industrialist}} Hugo Stinnes, an agreement in which the German employers {{for the first time}} accepted nationwide unions as legitimate workers-organisations and which introduced an eight-hour day, workers councils in plants with more than 50 employees and parity employment offices. The employers agreed to stop discrimination of union members and their support of [...] "house unions" [...] (<b>yellow</b> <b>unions)</b> while the unions rejected radical socialists’ demands. Most of the agreement's regulations became part of the Weimar German constitution.In 1919 he became the first Chairman of the Allgemeiner Deutscher Gewerkschaftsbund. To Legien the expected loss of Upper Silesia to Poland after World War I would intensify the 'psychological' impact of the [...] "draconian peace" [...] on the German working class.|$|R
50|$|The Swedish Workers Union (Svenska arbetareförbundet, {{abbreviated}} SvA) was a labour {{organization in}} Sweden active between 1899 and 1919. Josef P. Nilsson {{was one of}} the key leaders of the organization. SvA sought to compete with the Swedish Trade Union Confederation (LO) for dominance of the Swedish labour movement, but remained a largely marginal feature. Being sponsored by corporate interests, SvA was commonly denounced as a <b>yellow</b> <b>union.</b> Following the 1909 general strike SvA faded away.|$|E
50|$|SvA was {{declared}} as a politically and religiously neutral organization. It was modelled after the German Hirsch-Duncker trade unions. SvA {{was the first}} <b>yellow</b> <b>union</b> organizing project that gained some degree of success in Sweden. According to the organization itself, it sought to improve the living conditions of {{working men and women}} by peacefully preventing and resolving disputes between labourers and employers. The organization argued that its foremost responsibility was to provide coverage for unemployment, caused by strikes or lock-outs.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{important}} cooperatives, notably El Hogar Argentino (1911) and La Internacional (1914), opened in the town during that era, as did La Idea, a news daily, in 1915, and the Unión Ferroviaria, a nationally prominent <b>yellow</b> <b>union</b> organized as a counterweight to the intransigent La Fraternidad, in 1921. The Roman Catholic Parish of Nuestra Señora de los Remedios ("Our Lady of Remedies") was consecrated in 1924, and in 1933, Villa Galíndez and the Argentine Eden were incorporated as Remedios de Escalada (in honor of María de los Remedios de Escalada, wife of {{the leader of the}} Argentine War of Independence, General José de San Martín).|$|E

40|$|Dominance {{effects are}} {{normally}} associated with multinational corporations (MNCs). However, {{we argue that}} a strong local competitor can create `dominance effects' setting the institutional parameters for employment relations in multinational subsidiaries. Moreover such an effect can be persistent. In this case the Spanish-owned El Corte Inglés (ECI) used its power and influence to establish an employer's federation and two `yellow unions'. These <b>yellow</b> <b>unions</b> infiltrated the French-owned MNC Carrefour {{and most of the}} Spanish supermarket sector by the early 1980 s and continue to dominate collective bargaining rounds and works council elections, marginalizing the main independent trade unions. This has resulted in poor pay and working conditions and a lack of effective employee representation across most of the Spanish supermarket sector. The fact that Carrefour established an international framework agreement to observe union rights in 2001 has as yet not changed this situation...|$|R

50|$|UGTAN {{came into}} {{conflicts}} with local governments {{in several of}} the colonies. In Niger, Dahomey and Upper Volta the authorities sought to suppress the movement. In Niger the UGTAN leader and former Minister of Labour Saloum Traoré was exiled. In Ivory Coast tension between the trade union movement (UGTAN and CATC) and the government of Félix Houphouët-Boigny arose, as the government sought to build a <b>yellow</b> <b>union</b> in the public sector. The conflict escalated {{in the second half of}} 1959, as the leader of the Ivorian UGTAN branch Yao N'go Blaise was exiled to Guinea. UGTAN called for strikes (which never materialized), while the government declared martial law. Many union leaders were arrested and many public employees were fired from their jobs. In Senegal the UGTAN branch (i.e. the 'orthodox' UGTAN) was banned by the government on November 22, 1960. Several key UGTAN leaders were imprisoned. The remnants of the orthodox UGTAN would later form the Union sénégalaise des travailleurs in 1962.|$|E
5000|$|They {{were founded}} on 10 October 1919 in Barcelona, {{during a time}} of severe and violent class {{conflict}} between employers and workers in the city, with the practice of [...] "pistolerismo" [...] widespread. With employers feeling that the police and Army were inefficient in their attempts to stop the left-wing agitation they sponsored the growth of the Sindicatos Libres, seeking to use them as violent militia groups. Formed by highly conservative Catholic workers, they took on some of the features of a <b>yellow</b> <b>union</b> as employer subsidies to the groups grew. Vilified by anarcho-syndicalist rivals as strikebreaking thugs, the Sindicatos Libres sided with the Police in the 1920−1922 period, when Civil Governor Severiano Martínez Anido and Chief of Police Miguel Arlegui unleashed a campaign of State Terror against trade unionists. Aside from a small Carlist core, their militancy was not particularly ideological, with members often returning to the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo. They reached 150,000 members in the 1920-21 period. However, as strike action declined in 1921 and beyond so too did the influence of the Sindicatos Libres as their violent activity became of less value to the employers.|$|E
5000|$|The Hock Lee Amalgamated Bus Company {{was one of}} {{the eleven}} Chinese bus {{companies}} in Singapore that was in operation. In February, 1955, the workers started their own union and joined with the Singapore Bus Workers’ Union (SBWU), the company instantly fired the organisers of the union in an attempt to dissolve the union. On February 24, the company went a step further to set up a rival <b>yellow</b> <b>union</b> and hired 200 new workers in the process. Feeling threatened, on April 22, 1955, the bus workers’ union put up a notice to strike. The company proceeded to unemploy more than 200 workers who were related to the SBWU on April 24, 1955. This angered the workers further which prompted them to set up human blockades at the bus depot, stopping the buses from leaving. This injustice was not only felt by the workers but also by Chief Minister David Marshall who tried to plead their case with the company’s management, but his efforts were futile. As the anniversary of the May 13 National Service Incident was approaching, the workers, many of whom were ex-Chinese school students would have also been reminded of what happened the year before. On May 12, 1955, multilateral talks to mediate the workers’ disputes were hampered as police clashed with strikers which resulted in the death of four people and thirty-one people injured.|$|E

50|$|By {{the time}} Ghana became {{independent}} in 1957 - leading the Gold Coast Trades Union Congress {{to become the}} Trades Union Congress of Ghana - there were splinter labor groups in all regions of the country. Many were much more militant than the TUC and violent demonstrations and strikes were no rarity in Ghana. Employers responded by creating <b>yellow</b> <b>unions.</b> In 1958, the Ghanaian government responded as well by passing the Industrial Relations Act of 1958 in order to strengthen the TUC. It not only gave legal recognition to the TUC - the only national center to receive recognition - {{for the first time}} and even provided it with buildings for headquarters for its unions, but also made collective bargaining compulsory. The Industrial Relations Act of 1965, which replaced that of 1958, forced anyone wishing to register a trade union to do so via the TUC, a move many considered to contravene the ILO Convention No. 87. In 1960, a law making union membership compulsory for civil servants followed. At the time the TUC's relations to the CPP were very close, sometimes at the cost of its autonomy, leading to some resentment among the workers.|$|R
