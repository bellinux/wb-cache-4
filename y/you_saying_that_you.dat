[...] "The only {{document}} {{found in}} the pocket of the deceased was a letter from <b>you</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> would be with him on the night of his death. It was the envelope of this letter which gave us the dead man's name and address. It was after nine this morning when we reached his house and found neither you nor anyone else inside it. I wired to Mr. Gregson to run you down in London while I examined Wisteria Lodge. Then I came into town, joined Mr. Gregson, and here we are." ...|$|E

When we passed south he received messengers from <b>you,</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{were ready to}} enter into an alliance with him. To this he agreed, and sent presents. Since then you have done nothing, although he has sent to you urging you to aid him by making {{an attack on the}} tribes allied to Rome. In every battle which he has fought with the Romans he has defeated them with great slaughter; but, owing to the aid which they have received from the tribes in alliance with them, they are enabled continually to put fresh armies in the field. Therefore it is that he has sent me to you and to the other chiefs of the tribes inhabiting the mountains, to urge you to descend with your forces into the plains, and so oblige the tribes there to turn their attention to their own defence rather than to the sending of assistance to Rome. He has sent by my hands many valuable presents, and has authorized me to promise you, in his name, such lands as you may wish to obtain beyond the foot of the hills. He promises you, also, a share in the booty taken at the sack of the Italian cities." ...|$|E

To me the whole adventure seems perfectly mad, {{but at the same}} time I believe in our luck, or rather in the Providence which watches over us, and I don't believe that you, or I either, will come to any harm. If you stop here, you will only eat your heart out and communication between us must become increasingly difficult. My uncle is furious with you, and since he discovered that we were talking over the telephone, to his own great inconvenience he has had the wires cut outside the house. That horrid letter of his to <b>you</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> had 'compromised' me in pursuance of a 'mercenary scheme' is all part and parcel of the same thing. How are you to stop here and submit to such insults? I went to see my friend the lawyer, and he tells me that of course we can marry if we like, but in that case my father's will, which he has consulted at Somerset House, is absolutely definite, and if I do so in opposition to my uncle's wishes, I must lose everything except £200 a year. Now I am no money-grubber, but I will not give my uncle the satisfaction of robbing me of my fortune, which may be useful to both of us by and by. The lawyer says also that he does not think that the Court of Chancery would interfere, having no power to do so as far as the will is concerned, and not being able to make a ward of a person like myself who is over age and has the protection of the common law of the country. So it seems to me that the only thing to do is to be patient, and wait until time unties the knot.|$|E

Before he too was killed, Ferreira {{allegedly}} yelled: [...] "Now I want to see <b>you</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> screwed me." [...] (Quero ver agora você dizer por aí que me comeu.) The bodies of Marcolino, de Lima, and Nascimento were later found together in a thicket near Guajiru, a hamlet 2 km from Santo Antônio do Potengi, all of them killed with shots to the head and chest. According to dos Santos and da Silva Ferreira laughed frantically while killing them, and asked god for forgiveness afterwards.|$|E
50|$|Alexander {{wrote in}} his memoir {{that he did not}} shy away from voting with the Liberal {{government}} if an issue warranted his support. As an example, he threatened to break ranks with his own party to vote in favour of anti-hate legislation, saying “screw you” to his party's argument that it would curtail freedom of speech. “Are <b>you</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can call my son or daughter a nigger and that is free speech?” he asked during debate on the bill. Heath MacQuarrie, then a Tory MP from Prince Edward Island, stood up and said, “I'm not going to let Linc stand alone on this.” Together they led 17 members of their caucus in support of the government’s legislation.|$|E
