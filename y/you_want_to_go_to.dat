This {{was an effort}} organized by Joe Hickerson, who would become director of the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress. [...] We've Got Some Singing to Do and its accompanying songbook were distributed {{to a number of}} summer camps, and were responsible for the popularization of several freedom-longing African-American songs such as [...] "Kum Ba Yah". [...] The song was circulating in folk circles in other forms as well, and Pete Seeger published a variant with a more explicitly political message, called [...] "If <b>You</b> <b>Want</b> <b>To</b> <b>Go</b> <b>To</b> Freedom", in the mimeographed-but-influential Broadside Magazine in 1963.|$|E
500|$|During World War I, Prokofiev {{returned}} to the Conservatory and studied the [...] organ to avoid conscription. He composed The Gambler based on Fyodor Dostoyevsky's novel of the same name, but rehearsals were plagued by problems, and the scheduled 1917 première had to be cancelled because of the February Revolution. In the summer of that year, Prokofiev composed his first symphony, the Classical. It was his own name for the symphony, which {{was written in the}} style that, according to Prokofiev, Joseph Haydn would have used if he had been alive at the time. It is more or less Classical in style but incorporates more modern musical elements (see Neoclassicism). The symphony was also an exact contemporary of Prokofiev's Violin Concerto No. 1 in D major, Op. 19, which was scheduled to premiere in November 1917. The first performances of both works had to wait until 21 April 1918 and 18 October 1923, respectively. He stayed briefly with his mother in Kislovodsk in the Caucasus. After completing the score of Seven, They Are Seven, a [...] "Chaldean invocation" [...] for chorus and orchestra, Prokofiev was [...] "left with nothing to do and time hung heavily on my hands". Believing that Russia [...] "had no use for music at the moment", Prokofiev decided to try his fortunes in America until the turmoil in his homeland had passed. He set out for Moscow and Petersburg in March 1918 to sort out financial matters and to arrange for his passport. In May he headed for the US, having obtained official permission to do so from Anatoly Lunacharsky, the People's Commissar for Education, who told him: [...] "You are a revolutionary in music, we are revolutionaries in life. We ought to work together. But if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> America I shall not stand in your way." ...|$|E

2500|$|Developed by Parroty Interactive, the self-professed National Lampoon of the {{interactive}} media industry, Microshaft Winblows 98 became the company's fourth interactive comedy video game, after Pyst, Star Warped, and The X-Fools, which parodied adventure video game Myst, science fiction film series Star Wars, and supernatural television series The X Files, respectively. Ed Bernstein, founder and CEO of Palladium Interactive had long-wanted to create works that emulated the parody found in Mad Magazine, and felt this game {{could be his}} [...] "piece de resistance", further commenting that his company {{would have been able}} to [...] "sell the empty boxes" [...] due to the game cover humour alone. Elizabeth Wasserman of Knight Ridder/Tribune Business News cited various examples of this including the tagline [...] "Who does he want to own today?", a parody of Microsoft's own [...] "Where do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> today?", and the version, listed as [...] "98 or 99 or 00 or 01". The game was written by Tony Camin, Ian Deitchman, J. P. Manoux and Kristin Rusk. In addition to containing a series of minigames for the player to explore, the software also offered enhancements to Windows 95, while additional content was available via the game's official website. Microshaft Winblows 98s animation and programming were outsourced to WayForward Technologies while Chronic Music handled the music and sound effects. The product was also released in the French language.|$|E
