6000|$|Dowd {{shook his}} head. [...] "You mean that <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>wife</b> {{want to have}} the {{spending}} of six or eight thousand a year," [...] he said.|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly not," [...] replied his lordship. [...] "It's {{much too}} late. Ask Mr. Luke to call again to-morrow. And <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>wife</b> {{can go to}} bed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You stchewpids!' he began. 'There {{is nothing}} to fuss for. Of course, your eyes will smart and be red to-morrow. You will look as if <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>wives</b> had drunk too much, but {{in a little while}} you will see again as well as before. I tell <b>you</b> this, <b>and</b> I--I am Pirolo. Victor Pirolo!' ...|$|R
60|$|We join in affectionate {{loves to}} <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> dear <b>wife.</b> She well deserves your praise, I am sure.|$|R
6000|$|... "So be it," [...] Van Voorden said, [...] "and {{it will be}} {{far more}} {{pleasant}} to be with <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> good <b>wife</b> than in a strange place. How about the horses, of which we have six?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I felt I {{must get}} him back to Hannah at any cost. I said, 'I suppose <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>wife</b> are {{still living in the}} old place?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{need not}} be so rude,' said Don Giovanni; 'I am not a beggar, and if I chose I could force <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>wife</b> to leave your house.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{struck me}} as a foolish and inconsiderate little person. But why should <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>wife</b> take to heart so {{strongly}} mere folly--or even a want of consideration?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good night, William," [...] he said, in {{a really}} soft voice, while his face looked benevolently compassionate. [...] "Good night, lad. I wish <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> future <b>wife</b> much prosperity; and I hope she will satisfy your fastidious soul." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So be it," [...] I said carelessly; [...] "all time {{is before}} us, for {{we do not}} die. We are ready, lead on. But Infadoos, and thou Scragga, beware! Play us no monkey tricks, set for us no foxes' snares, for before your brains of mud have thought of them we shall know and avenge. The light of the {{transparent}} eye of him with the bare legs and the half-haired face shall destroy <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> go through <b>your</b> land; his vanishing teeth shall affix themselves fast in <b>you</b> <b>and</b> eat <b>you</b> up, <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>wives</b> <b>and</b> children; the magic tubes shall argue with <b>you</b> loudly, <b>and</b> make <b>you</b> as sieves. Beware!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope," [...] said Mr. Archibald, [...] "that our example has {{not made}} a real hermit of him. Good-bye. I am very sorry that Mrs. Archibald is not at home; but in both our names I wish <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> future <b>wife</b> the best of good fortunes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{have done}} it. I have said you managed capitally. <b>You</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>wife</b> both. If you'll go on {{managing}} capitally, I'll go on doing my part. Only don't crow.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A boat! A sort of 'Rob Roy' arrangement, I suppose. Well, I {{would not}} have thought that of <b>you.</b> <b>And</b> <b>your</b> <b>wife,</b> I suppose, has gone home to her people?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{hope to have}} <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>wife</b> and children, {{come and}} [...] pay us a visit this coming summer,--say in {{raspberry}} time, [...] which will be just after haying." ...|$|E
25|$|Mr. Arar, I wish to {{take this}} {{opportunity}} to express publicly to <b>you</b> <b>and</b> to <b>your</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> to <b>your</b> children how truly sorry I am for whatever part the actions of the RCMP {{may have contributed to the}} terrible injustices that <b>you</b> experienced <b>and</b> the pain that <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> family endured.|$|R
6000|$|... "And I do not {{see that}} I am at all bound to provide for <b>you</b> <b>and</b> for <b>your</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> children. <b>You</b> have seen many ups and downs, and will be doomed to see many more, {{as long as you}} can get hold of a bottle of wine." ...|$|R
5000|$|Nathan replied, [...] "You are the man! This is {{what the}} Lord, the God of Israel, says: 'I anointed you king over Israel, <b>and</b> I {{delivered}} <b>you</b> from the hand of Saul.

6000|$|... "I {{never touched}} your money, {{and you know}} it," [...] ses Henery Walker, finding his breath at last. I don't believe it was there. <b>You</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>wife</b> 'ud swear anything." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{gives me}} pleasure, sir," [...] said she, [...] "to meet with <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>wife.</b> It is so seldom {{that we find}} any one--" [...] She was {{interrupted}} by Mrs. Perkenpine, who stood behind her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] {{said the}} Patchwork Girl, [...] "I'm {{going to serve}} <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>wife</b> by helping Ojo find the things you need. You need a lot, you know, such as are not easily found." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot say. It is {{certainly}} odd, {{when she had}} forgiven <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> had forgiven <b>your</b> <b>wife,</b> <b>and</b> {{was going to see}} ye on purpose to make friends." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, my friend, so we meet once more! Have you {{forgotten}} me? I am Shepherd Paul, and I {{have come}} to wrestle with <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> to free <b>your</b> <b>wife</b> from <b>your</b> clutches.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Hayward,' {{said the}} Baron, 'I {{swear to you}} that I will disturb <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>wife</b> by my {{presence}} no more. And he took Jim's hand, and pressed it within his own upon the hilt of Jim's sword.|$|E
60|$|R.C. No, no, it is {{your own}} moving pious {{arguments}} to her, has made conscience fling them back upon you. But pray, Atkins, inform us what passed between <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>wife,</b> and in what manner you did begin.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, that's it, is it?" [...] Miss Montressor remarked, with a toss of her head. [...] "Well, <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>wife</b> {{and your}} little chit of a {{daughter}} are welcome to him {{so far as we}} are concerned, aren't they, Flossie?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I should say," [...] {{said the}} student {{of human nature}} with unpardonable hesitation, [...] "that you was, say, in the {{contracting}} business--or maybe worked in a store--or was a sign-painter. You stopped in the park to finish <b>your</b> cigar, <b>and</b> thought you'd get a little free monologue out of me. Still, {{you might be a}} plasterer or a lawyer--it's getting kind of dark, <b>you</b> see. <b>And</b> <b>your</b> <b>wife</b> won't let <b>you</b> smoke at home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have five}} hundred still left, Mikail, {{which will be}} ample for me. You will grieve me if you refuse to take it. It will be {{pleasant}} to me, whether I am taken again or whether I escape, to think that I have made one home happier for my stay here, <b>and</b> that <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> brave <b>wife,</b> in <b>your</b> comfortable home, think sometimes of the young fellow you were kind to." ...|$|R
50|$|On September 28, 2006, RCMP Commissioner Giuliano Zaccardelli {{issued an}} apology to Arar {{and his family}} during the House of Commons {{committee}} on public safety and national security:Mr. Arar, I wish {{to take this opportunity}} to express publicly to <b>you</b> <b>and</b> to <b>your</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> to <b>your</b> children how truly sorry I am for whatever part the actions of the RCMP {{may have contributed to the}} terrible injustices that <b>you</b> experienced <b>and</b> the pain that <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> family endured.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I do, though; and I'll {{tell you}} what it is, Bellamy, they say that <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>wife</b> went to Madeira and trumped up a story about her lover's death in order to take the girl in. I tell you this as an old friend." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tchah! It's {{of no use}} to be {{anything}} but free with you, I see," [...] said Tackleton. [...] "Why, then, the truth is, you have a--what tea-drinking people call a sort of a comfortable appearance together, <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>wife.</b> We know better, you know, but----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>wife</b> lead a {{cat and dog}} {{existence}} is a disgrace to both of you. At least you might have the decency to try and hide it from the world--not make a jest of your shame to every passing stranger. You are a cad, sir, a cad!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{spite of}} scanty {{communications}} from England (owing to {{the uncertainty of}} my position), {{a word or two}} concerning <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> dear <b>Wife</b> have reached me. Lately it has often occurred to me, that the sight of the Bay of Naples, of the beautiful coast from that to this place, and of Rome itself, all bathed in summer sunshine, and green with spring foliage, would be some consolation to her. [29] Pray give her my love.|$|R

Lady Martindale, too eager to heed that her lord would fain not broach the question till his deliberations were mature, rose up at once, exclaiming, 'Arthur my dear, I am glad you are come. We wish, when Theodora leaves us, that <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> dear <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> children should come and live at home always with us. Will you, my dear?' Arthur looked {{from one to the}} other in amaze.|$|R
5000|$|... "Remember this moment. If we don't {{convince}} the field marshal (Fedor von Bock) {{to fly to}} Hitler at once and have these orders (Commissar Order) canceled, the German people will be burdened with a guilt the world will not forget in a hundred years. This guilt will fall not only on Hitler, Himmler, Göring, and their comrades but on <b>you</b> <b>and</b> me, <b>your</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> mine, <b>your</b> children <b>and</b> mine, that woman crossing the street, and those children over there playing ball."
