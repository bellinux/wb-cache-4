500|$|... "Baby, Please Don't Go" [...] {{is likely}} an {{adaptation}} of [...] "Long John", an old folk theme which {{dates back to the}} time of slavery in the United States. Blues researcher Paul Garon notes that the melody is based on [...] "Alabamy Bound", composed by Tin Pan Alley writer Ray Henderson, with lyrics by Buddy DeSylva and Bud Green in 1925. The song, a vaudeville show tune, inspired several other songs between 1925 and 1935, such as [...] "Elder Greene Blues", [...] "Alabama Bound", and [...] "Don't <b>You</b> <b>Leave</b> <b>Me</b> Here". [...] These variants were recorded by Charlie Patton, Lead Belly, Monette Moore, Henry Thomas, and Tampa Red.|$|E
500|$|... "Moments" [...] is a mid-tempo pop ballad. Written {{in the key}} of D major, {{the beat}} is set in common time and moves at a {{moderate}} 150 beats per minute. One Direction's vocal range in the song span from the note of D4 to A5. [...] "Moments" [...] utilises a gently strummed guitar and intermediate piano lines. Inspired by the breakdown of a relationship between Sheeran and an unnamed woman, the song's lyrics revolve around an unrequited love. The chorus of the song is essentially built on the hook, [...] "You know I'll be your life, your voice, your reason to be/ My love, my heart is breathing for this moment in time/I'll find the words to say/ Before <b>you</b> <b>leave</b> <b>me</b> today." ...|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} is about a brokenhearted man who moves on from his past. A Rolling Stone {{reviewer}} called the song a [...] "breakup aria". According to Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian, [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] stands out for its [...] "slow-building sense of drama", which highlights Timberlake at his [...] "husky best". The song begins with the phrase [...] "You were my sun, you were my earth", which according to Timbaland was Timberlake's inspiration to write the song. Tanya L. Edwards of MTV News observed that Timberlake was wronged and said this is demonstrated by the lyrics: [...] "You don't have to say whatcha did / I already know, I found out from him / Now there's just no chance." [...] The chorus contains the lines: [...] "Told me you loved me, why did <b>you</b> <b>leave</b> <b>me</b> all alone / Now {{you tell me you}} need me when you call me on the phone." [...] Slant Magazines Sal Cinquemani called Timberlake's 2007 single [...] "What Goes Around... Comes Around" [...] an ostensible sequel to [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] both lyrically and musically. Jason Lipshutz of Billboard stated that aside from the presence of Timbaland's [...] "fantastically cluttered production", the difference between [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] and Timberlake's 2013 single [...] "Mirrors" [...] is clear: [...] "10 years ago, Timberlake was broken, and now he is whole".|$|E

2500|$|American {{experiments}} in 1978 and 1982 found {{the great majority}} of men were willing to have sex with women they did not know, of average attractiveness, who propositioned them. No woman, by contrast, agreed to such propositions from men of average attractiveness.

It was the group's first number-one single, and won Chicago their only Grammy Award to date, the 1976 Best Pop Vocal Performance by a Duo, Group or Chorus, at the 19th Annual Grammy Awards held on February 19, 1977. The single was certified gold by the RIAA the same year of its release. The song almost {{did not make the}} cut for the album. [...] "If <b>You</b> <b>Leave</b> <b>Me</b> Now" [...] was recorded at the very last minute. The success of the song, according to William James Ruhlmann, foreshadowed a later reliance on ballads. The album was commercially successful. It reached number three on the Billboard 200, was certified both gold and platinum by the RIAA the same year of its release and two times multi-platinum since, and was also nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year.
