40|$|How {{many times}} have you got frustrated, because your code from last month refuses to run and your past self didn't bother to leave you any guidelines? 	 	 	Are you scared that one day a {{colleague}} will ask you the data/results of a paper, and you will have to excavate them out of a folder named 'allDataResultsVersion 8 bFinalizedRecheckedPleaseEnd'? 	 	 	Are <b>you</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>that</b> your contributions will not have much impact, because people {{may not be able to}} access them properly? 	 If yes, you are in the same shoes with me, when I started my PhD! In this talk, I present how I embraced reproducibility to avoid some of these common problems. I explain some best practices, simple tricks and habits I have learned throughout my doctoral research, which improved the quality of my research, made it reusable by others (and myself), and hence improved the accessibility and visibility of my work. I give practical examples in where I failed (and then gradually improved) on organizing, developing, versioning, documenting, licensing and publishing the research material (data, code, experimental setups and results etc.). I also introduce some of the available software tools and services, which would help you to achieve these goals. I hope that this talk will convince you to consider reproducibility as a major criteria in academic research, and give you a head start on achieving this objective...|$|E

40|$|In {{choosing}} {{to read this}} book, you have taken the first step on a journey toward greater strength and vitality. Growing Stronger was written for you—the older adult who wants to grow stronger, healthier, more active, and more independent. You may be inactive or only mildly active at the moment. You may know that regular exercise is important for your health and well-being and want to get started on a program of physical activity. But you may feel that you don’t have the necessary information. Perhaps <b>you</b> are <b>concerned</b> <b>that</b> because of your age or health problems physical activity may not be safe for you. Or perhaps you have had trouble finding or staying with a suitable program. This book gives you a safe, simple, and highly effective exercise program based {{on the principles of}} strength training. Studies at laboratories around the world have shown that strength training benefits women and men of all ages and all levels of fitness. According to Physical Activity and Health: A Report of the Surgeon General (1996), experts agree that aerobic activities should be supplemented with strength-developing exercises at least twice per week...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{just because}} of {{that part of my}} offence which <b>concerned</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> I come to you. I knew how generous you were, and after you told me that you had no resentment--I {{acknowledge}} that it is indelicate, if you choose to look at it in that light, but a man like me can't afford to let delicacy stand in his way. I don't want to flatter you, or get you to do this thing for me on false pretences. But I thought that if you went to Mrs. Hasketh for me, she would remember that you had overlooked something, and she would be more disposed to--to--be considerate." ...|$|R

"Delora," [...] I said, [...] "from {{the moment}} when you {{disappeared}} from Charing Cross I have had but one idea <b>concerning</b> <b>you,</b> and <b>that</b> {{is that you are}} engaged in some nefarious if not criminal undertaking. I believe so at this minute. On the other hand, there is, of course, the chance that you may be, as you say, engaged in carrying out some enterprise, political or otherwise, which necessitates these mysterious doings on your part. I have no wish to be your enemy, or to interfere in any legitimate operation. If you care to take me into your confidence you will not find me unreasonable." ...|$|R
6000|$|In this {{it may be}} {{necessary}} to say, Charles spoke very truly; nor would he have parted with it in the way he did, had he suspected it would be easily recognised.

If you mean to arrest me, you must do so here, and at your own peril, for I will neither walk farther your way, nor permit you to dog me on mine. If you let me pass, I will thank you: if not, take to your weapon." ...|$|R

We succeeded in putting these spies off the scent, but only for a moment... within a few hours--less perhaps--Heron will repent him of his carelessness; he'll come back--I know that he will come back. He may leave me, personally, alone; but he will be on your track; he'll drag you to the Conciergerie to report yourself, and there your true name and history are bound to come to light. If you succeed in evading him, he will still be on your track. If the Scarlet Pimpernel keeps you in Paris now, your death will be at his door." ...|$|R

40|$|At Yale for {{the last}} two years, I 2 ̆ 7 ve been working with Professor Gayl Westerman, sitting here on my right, who is a {{professor}} at Pace University School of Law and holds a doctorate from Yale on maritime boundaries. In {{the course of the last}} year, we have become more and more concerned with the complete deterioration of any disciplined regime with regard to baselines, and it has become quite apparent that the consequences are very deleterious for any effective public order of the oceans. We have been doing some work on this, and it seemed that it would be appropriate to present it to a group of experts in international law in general and specialists in international maritime law in particular, to see what the reactions might be. I know that many of <b>you</b> here are <b>concerned</b> with this problem in a professional or scholarly fashion, and I know that some of <b>you</b> share the <b>concerns</b> <b>that</b> Gayl Westerman and I have. The seminar might proceed best if I were given 25 or 30 minutes to set out the basic thesis of our concern, and perhaps a brief bibliographical review for those of you who are working on this, and then try to move our discussion on to an inquiry into a variety of problems that we think, as yet, are unresolved...|$|R

6000|$|There is no {{animal fibre}} {{that will not}} yield itself up to long-continued, steady heat. But the {{difficulty}} with almost any of the common servants who call themselves cooks is, {{that they have not}} the smallest notion of the philosophy of the application of heat. Such a one will complacently tell <b>you,</b> <b>concerning</b> certain meats, <b>that</b> the harder you boil them the harder they grow,--an obvious fact, which, under her mode of treatment by an indiscriminate galloping boil, has frequently come under her personal observation. If you tell her that such meat must stand for six hours in a heat just below the boiling-point, she will probably answer, [...] "Yes, ma'am," [...] and go on her own way. Or she will let it stand till it burns {{to the bottom of the}} kettle,--a most common termination of the experiment. The only way to make sure of the matter is either to import a French kettle, or to fit into an ordinary kettle a false bottom, such as any tinman may make, that shall leave a space of an inch or two between the meat and the fire. This kettle may be maintained as a constant habitué of the range, and into it the cook may be instructed to throw all the fibrous trimmings of meat, all the gristle, tendons, and bones, having previously broken up these last with a mallet.|$|R
