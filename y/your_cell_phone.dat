He went on to explain that, after a show of force and a threat to also drop a nuclear bomb on Tehran, the U.S. should then say: if [...] "You [...] want to be peaceful, just reverse it all and we will guarantee that you can have a nuclear power plant for electricity purposes, energy purposes." [...] Adelson's spokesman told reporters that Adelson [...] "was obviously not speaking literally" [...] about using an atomic bomb in the desert, and that he was [...] "using hyperbole to make a point that … actions speak louder than words".|$|E

ABSTRACT: The concept of mobile learning was proposed by Revans from England in 1982 which {{has been more than}} 25 years (Revans, 1982). Revans offers an iterative model, successively alternating experience and preparation/reflection, which is a useful paradigm for mobile learning (McDermott et al., 2000). However, scholars perceive mobile learning in different ways. The following section contributes to various explanations of mobile learning by international scholars: m-learning is e-learning through mobile computational devices: Palms, Windows CE machines, even <b>your</b> digital <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> (Quin, 2001). Mobile learning is a context-based learning by using mobile technology medium and is learner-centered. The flexibility of mobile learning in a proper location allow learners to interact with other learners and instructors and conduct technology-learning, content learning or context-based learning that is proactive, instant, distant /approximate, individual or group-centered. Moreover, learner will experience meaningful knowledge construction through this process (Young et al., 2005). Mobile learning is defined as any educational provision where the sole or dominant technologies are handheld or palmtop devices (Traxler, 2005) ...|$|R
