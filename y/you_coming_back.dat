[...] In IGN's review the game was given a 9.1 overall rating ("Outstanding") out of 10, and was called [...] "one of the best shooters of the year". Eurogamer gave the game {{a score of}} 8 out of 10, and called it [...] "thoroughly commendable." [...] Computer Games Magazine gave the game 5 stars out of 5, and claimed that [...] "No One Lives Forever combines a fantastic sense of style with great animation and voice acting, clever AI, industry-leading interactive music, a wry sense of humor, and gameplay that keeps <b>you</b> <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> for more." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{overwhelmingly}} negative reviews, a few reviewers {{had positive}} {{things to say}} about the song and video. Entertainment Weekly writer Joseph Lynch noted that there was [...] "something sickeningly catchy about this tune that keeps <b>you</b> <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> for more." [...] Rolling Stones Perpetua stated, [...] "When you see this video, you immediately notice everything that it does 'wrong', but it actually gets {{a lot of things about}} pop music right, if just by accident." [...] OK! Magazine also noted that [...] "some are calling the 13-year-old signed singer the next Justin Bieber." [...] After watching the video, singer Chris Brown said: [...] "Honest opinion? It was great. I'll be jammin' to it on Friday, Friday." [...] Fellow teenage singer Miley Cyrus denied that she had criticized Black, saying [...] "I am a fan" [...] and that she sang [...] "Friday" [...] while driving. Simon Cowell praised Black, saying [...] "I love her [...] the fact that she's gotten so much publicity. People are so upset about the song, but I think it's hysterical. [...] Anyone who can create this much controversy within a week, I want to meet. I love people like that." [...] He observed that [...] "any song to do with the weekend annoys you. It reminds me of 'Saturday Night'... It's what we call a 'hair-dryer song,' a song girls sing into their hair dryers as they're getting ready to go out. But the fact that it's making people so angry is brilliant." [...] Cowell advised Black not to [...] "listen to anyone over the age of 18. I'm being deadly serious. Whatever she's done has worked. Whether you like her or not, she's the most talked-about artist in America right now. Nobody over the age of 18 should understand her or like her. So she should just do it her way." ...|$|E
2500|$|GameSpot did not {{review the}} game until after its release {{so that they}} could {{experience}} its online multiplayer features in more depth. Reviewer Kevin VanOrd gave Killzone 2 a 9/10 saying: [...] "Killzone 2 boasts amazing visuals, an intense campaign, and extraordinary online play that will keep <b>you</b> <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> for more." [...] but described the game's story and characters as [...] "forgettable" [...] and said that the motion controls seemed [...] "tacked-on".|$|E

2500|$|David Adair of Contactmusic.com {{wrote that}} Conley's vocals [...] "take on greater pangs of passion ... to deliver lyrics {{that more than}} likely sum up the way the guys felt during their time in music's wilderness". He said Sound the Alarm is [...] "exactly what those who like their music to be a bed of roses will do". Entertainment Weekly {{reviewer}} Leah Greenblatt wrote that the album is [...] "as turgidly epic as the tenets of the genre demand" [...] with Conley [...] "mak no bones about his bad mood". She added that the band [...] "have rediscovered their riff-heavy melodics {{to go along with}} Alarm impressively righteous indignation". Gigwise staff member David Renshaw wrote that the instrumentation is [...] "nothing spectacular," [...] while noting that [...] "there are riffs piled on top of riffs ... and a few funky basslines ... but the thing that keeps <b>you</b> <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> to this album is the lyrics". He said that with the album's [...] "heart on sleeve honesty set to a riff-tastic backdrop there is no reason that this album will not bring them the success expected of them on Stay What You Are".|$|E
2500|$|The {{film was}} met with mostly {{positive}} reviews. Nollywood Reinvented commended the cinematography, the subtle comedy and the romance. Though it noted that the film portrayed an unrealistic situation, it gave a 68% rating and concluded: [...] "One great thing about the movie is the emotional connect it creates between the viewers and the ‘couple’, the viewers and the individual characters, the characters and each other and not just Mary and Akin. At {{the end of the}} movie you don’t just feel like you’ve seen another movie. It has a lasting impact that only a few movies can create. It’s one of those movies that will have <b>you</b> <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> to it time after time." [...] Augusta Okon of 9aija books and movies also praised the cinematography, use of language, production design, editing and soundtrack but talked down on the obvious commercials exhibited in the film. He gave the film a rating of 4 out of 5 stars and concluded: [...] "Phone Swap is incontrovertibly a first class comedy movie in Nollywood, sailing on the seas of dynamism and ingenuity, with its mast of professionalism beating proudly in the air and pointing to one fact…It has raised the movie bar in Nollywood once again!". Kemi Filani praised the cinematography, editing, character development, scripting and props of the film; she concluded: [...] "Phone Swap is full of laugh out loud moments and shows how the most unlikely people [...] can adapt to unexpected situations and circumstances. A film I can definitely recommend." [...] NollywoodForever gave it a Watch Definitely rating and concluded that [...] "...It was funny, it was witty, it was heart warming and more." [...] Dami Elebe of Connect Nigeria commended the directing and scripting of the film and stated [...] "Without a doubt, this is the movie you are proud to show off. It is a beautifully done film and we can’t wait for another collaboration from them (the lead actors) in the future".|$|E

6000|$|... "It {{certainly}} wasn't fair, {{but about}} its being robbery, that's questionable. You shouldn't have left your game without leaving something {{on top of}} it, a knife or anything, just to show that <b>you</b> were <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> for it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And so you {{are going}} abroad; and when do you return? But that's a useless question. You hardly know when <b>you</b> are <b>coming</b> <b>back,</b> <b>You</b> will find so much to learn." [...] My smile falls heavily among the bric-a-brac.|$|R
6000|$|MISS REED, laughing: [...] "You {{will have}} to go out for a walk, you poor thing; and I'm not going to have <b>you</b> <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> in five or ten minutes. You have got to stay out a good hour." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are <b>you</b> <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> to that,--just {{like a big}} child? Do let us {{consider}} that as settled. I'm sure you'll let mamma and me have {{the use of the}} phaeton." [...] Of course the little contest was ended in the manner proposed by Arabella.|$|E
6000|$|Another paler flash lit up {{the prairie}} as they carried Redmond in, and, when a wagon came {{bouncing}} up to the fence, Steel said: [...] "Here's Mrs. Gordon; they have lost no time. Are <b>you</b> <b>coming</b> <b>back,</b> Ormesby? I've had about enough of this." ...|$|E

6000|$|Haldane smiled good-humoredly; but, {{in spite}} of this, his face was inscrutable. [...] "'When I might at least have run the price up,' you wish to add. Well, I had to redeem a promise made {{somewhat}} against my better judgment, and I stopped--when it seemed advisable. This, as you may discover, Ormesby, {{is not the end}} of the affair, and, if I could have helped you judiciously, you may be sure that I would.

6000|$|... "Are <b>you</b> <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> this way, doctor?" [...] asked Dora.

I have thought it over. He had left me in charge that evening; but he was in the habit of coming back suddenly, lest I should have fallen asleep. That night I saw nothing of him, though he had promised to return. He must have returned, and--found reason to keep in hiding. It is all plain. The next thing is that the Vicar went to him two hours ago. Further than that I have not heard.' ...|$|E

"Here is Gilbert, and <b>you</b> are <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> with us," [...] said Anne, {{who had no}} {{intention}} of leaving Leslie to wander alone on the sand-bar on such a night and in such a mood.
