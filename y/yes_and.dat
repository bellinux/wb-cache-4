5|$|Most of the genre's major bands {{released}} {{their most}} critically acclaimed albums {{during the years}} 1971–1976. The genre experienced {{a high degree of}} commercial success during the early 1970s. Jethro Tull, ELP, <b>Yes</b> <b>and</b> Pink Floyd combined for four albums that reached number one in the US charts, and sixteen of their albums reached the top ten. Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells (1973), an excerpt of which was used as the theme for the film The Exorcist, sold 16 million copies.|$|E
5|$|A {{vote was}} taken {{after a long}} day of speeches, each colony casting a single vote, as always. The {{delegation}} for each colony numbered from two to seven members, and each delegation voted amongst themselves to determine the colony's vote. Pennsylvania and South Carolina voted against declaring independence. The New York delegation abstained, lacking permission to vote for independence. Delaware cast no vote because the delegation was split between Thomas McKean (who voted <b>yes)</b> <b>and</b> George Read (who voted no). The remaining nine delegations voted in favor of independence, which meant that the resolution had been approved by the committee of the whole. The next step was for the resolution to be voted upon by Congress itself. Edward Rutledge of South Carolina was opposed to Lee's resolution but desirous of unanimity, and he moved that the vote be postponed until the following day.|$|E

5|$|The band's second LP Ars Longa Vita Brevis {{featured}} {{an arrangement}} of the Intermezzo from the Karelia Suite by Jean Sibelius, which the band's friend Roy Harper had recommended they covered, and the album's second side was a suite which included {{an arrangement of}} a movement from J.S. Bach's Brandenburg Concerto No.3. The group used an orchestra {{for the first time}} on some parts of the suite. The band were on the bill at the 1969 Isle of Wight Festival and briefly toured Ireland with <b>Yes</b> <b>and</b> Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band which, by all accounts, was fraught with logistical problems.|$|E
5|$|Dylan {{introduced}} a literary element to rock through {{his fascination with}} the Surrealists and the French Symbolists, and his immersion in the New York City art scene of the early 1960s. The trend of bands with names drawn from literature, such as the Doors, Steppenwolf and the Ides of March, were a further sign of rock music aligning itself with high culture. Dylan also {{led the way in}} blending rock with folk music styles. This was followed by folk rock groups such as the Byrds, who based their initial sound on that of the Beatles. In turn, the Byrds' vocal harmonies inspired those of <b>Yes,</b> <b>and</b> British folk rock bands like Fairport Convention, who emphasised instrumental virtuosity. Some of these artists, such as the Incredible String Band and Shirley and Dolly Collins, would prove influential through their use of instruments borrowed from world music and early music.|$|E

The polls tightened further after the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, stated in February that the UK government was opposed to a currency union; the average yes support increased to 43%, once 'don't knows' had been excluded. There was little movement in the following months, with the average continuing to show 43% <b>yes</b> <b>and</b> 57% no (excluding don't knows) in July 2014 and August 2014.|$|E
