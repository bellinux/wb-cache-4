500|$|... "Amor Puro" [...] (Pure Love) is {{in a minor}} key with romantic lyrics, {{a string}} {{ensemble}} and techno synthesizers. Its lyrics focus {{on the meaning of}} true love. Queen sings: [...] "Pure love does not fight, it does not hurt you, love that is pure does not cause you to fall", and described the song as [...] "an honest statement of what love is". [...] "I Do" [...] is a minor-key, mid-tempo pop and R power ballad built on a handclapped rhythm and piano. Lyrically, the song is a message to men and women; Queen sings: [...] "My ladies, if you know better, if he loves <b>you,</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> come back. My fellas, if you love her, don't let nothing hold you back, run out and look for her". Queen recorded the song in English because she felt the language worked well with the beat. According to an editor for iTunes, the song [...] "puts her message of female empowerment into a glossy pop ballad, complete with English lyrics and Auto-Tuned vocal." [...] The minor-key [...] "Acércate" [...] (Get Closer) features vocals by Wisin & Yandel and synthesizers; it has been described as [...] "pure reggaeton". The song was praised for the presence of Wisin & Yandel and its hook. Queen previously collaborated with Wisin & Yandel on their seventh studio album, La Revolución (2009), with [...] "Perfecto" [...] (which also featured Yaviah).|$|E
500|$|In February 1988, the State of California Board of Medical Quality charged Landy with {{ethical and}} license code {{violations}} {{stemming from the}} improper prescription of drugs and various unethical personal and professional relationships with patients, citing one case of sexual misconduct with a female patient, along with Wilson's psychological dependency on Landy. Landy denied the allegations, but later admitted {{to one of the}} seven charges which accused him of wrongfully prescribing drugs to Wilson. Landy surrendered his psychological license, complying with an agreement made with the state of California, and was not allowed applications for reinstatement for the next two years. An August 1988 board meeting with the Beach Boys had Landy promising that Brian would reconnect with the group, which Love says: [...] "was a ruse to get us to write a letter in his defense against the California authorities. We never wrote the letter, and Brian's public behavior continued to unsettle." [...] Landy and his colleagues claimed that his treatment of Wilson ended in February 1988 {{at the request of the}} state attorney general's office, but the deputy attorney who drafted the complaint reported that he was not aware of any such request, nor was the office advised that they sever Landy's relationship with Wilson. Others witnessed no changes, and Landy's assistants remained with Wilson. Samuels believed, [...] " [...] still has an oral drive. He would still overeat and overdose if <b>you</b> <b>let</b> <b>him.</b> He has total freedom in every other way." ...|$|E
500|$|In the Protestant Christian tradition, Martin Luther insisted in the Diet of Worms {{that his}} {{conscience}} was captive to the Word of God, {{and it was}} neither safe nor right to go against conscience. To Luther, conscience falls within the ethical, rather than the religious, sphere. John Calvin saw conscience as a battleground: [...] " [...] the enemies who rise up in our conscience against his Kingdom and hinder his decrees prove that God's throne is not firmly established therein". Many Christians regard following one's conscience as important as, or even more important than, obeying human authority. A fundamentalist Christian view of conscience might be: 'God gave us our conscience so we would know when we break His Law; the guilt we feel when we do something wrong tells us {{that we need to}} repent.' This can sometimes (as with the conflict between William Tyndale and Thomas More over the translation of the Bible into English) lead to moral quandaries: [...] "Do I unreservedly obey my Church/priest/military/political leader or do I follow my own inner feeling of right and wrong as instructed by prayer and a personal reading of scripture?" [...] Some contemporary Christian churches and religious groups hold the moral teachings of the Ten Commandments or of Jesus as the highest authority in any situation, regardless {{of the extent to which}} it involves responsibilities in law. In the Gospel of John (7:53–8:11) (King James Version) Jesus challenges those accusing a woman of adultery stating: [...] "'He that is without sin among <b>you,</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> first cast a stone at her.' And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground. And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one" [...] (see Jesus and the woman taken in adultery). In the Gospel of Luke (10: 25–37) Jesus tells the story of how a despised and heretical Samaritan (see Parable of the Good Samaritan) who (out of compassion and conscience) helps an injured stranger beside a road, qualifies better for eternal life by loving his neighbor, than a priest who passes by on the other side.|$|E

2500|$|According to the New Testament, Christ saved a woman {{accused of}} {{adultery}} from an angry mob seeking to punish her, by saying: [...] "He that is without sin among <b>you,</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> first cast a stone at her".|$|E
2500|$|Hitchens {{points out}} the {{problematic}} implications of the scriptural proclamation [...] "he that is without sin among <b>you,</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> cast a first stone" [...] {{with regard to the}} practical legislation of retributive justice: [...] "if only the non-sinners have the right to punish, then how could an imperfect society ever determine how to prosecute offenders?" [...] Of the adulterous woman whom Jesus saved from stoning, the author contends that Jesus thus forgives her of sheer sexual promiscuity, and, if this be the case, that the lesson has ever since been completely misunderstood. Closing the chapter, he suggests that advocates of religion have faith alone to rely on—nothing else—and calls on them to [...] "be brave enough" [...] to admit it.|$|E
2500|$|Sellers was {{executed}} {{by lethal injection}} at 12:17a.m. on February 4, 1999. He spoke to his step-siblings, saying, [...] "All {{the people who are}} hating me right now and are here waiting to see me die, when {{you wake up in the}} morning, you aren't going to feel any different. You are going to hate me as much tomorrow as you do tonight. Reach out to God and he will hear <b>you.</b> <b>Let</b> <b>him</b> touch your hearts. Don't hate all your lives.". Sellers did not mention his mother or apologize for what he had done. His statement outraged his step-siblings. Noelle Terry, his stepsister, later said, [...] "He basically addressed the fact that we would still feel the same. It is very presumptuous that he would know how we would still feel." [...] His last words were a modern Christian music song: [...] "Set my spirit free that I might praise Thee. Set my spirit free that I might worship Thee." ...|$|E

2500|$|However, the Fu Zi gave a {{completely}} different account of Guo's advice to Cao Cao {{on how to handle}} Liu Bei. Guo Jia told Cao Cao, [...] "Liu Bei has great ambitions and has won the hearts of many people. Zhang Fei and Guan Yu are formidable fighters and they have pledged to serve him with their lives. From what I observe, Liu Bei will never truly submit to anyone, and his intentions are unclear. The people in the past once said, 'If you let the enemy off today, they will become a threat to you for a long time.' You should settle (Liu Bei) soon." [...] At the time, Cao Cao was using Emperor Xian as a figurehead to command respect and had attracted many heroes to serve under him so he did not heed Guo Jia's advice. When Cao Cao later sent Liu Bei with an army to attack Yuan Shu, Guo Jia and Cheng Yu warned Cao, [...] "Liu Bei will rebel if <b>you</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> go!" [...] By then, Liu Bei had already left and he really did rebel against Cao Cao as he later seized control of Xu Province from Che Zhou, the provincial governor appointed by Cao Cao. Cao Cao regretted not following Guo Jia's advice.|$|E
2500|$|Out of high school, Anderson was {{considered}} capable of playing any of four {{positions on the}} court, from point guard to power forward, drawing comparisons to basketball legends Magic Johnson and Larry Bird. Anderson's high school coach Bob Hurley said, [...] "I think he's a modern-day Magic Johnson. I think that let him play the point. He gets everybody shots. You don’t have him back defensively balancing the floor, you’re wasting him. But <b>you</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> {{do a lot of}} what the point guard stuff entails. But then also defensively you don’t bother guarding him on the little guy. Put him on maybe the three man or even sometimes the four man if he’s a step-out player. And now you have a guy like Larry Bird who anticipates. He gets a lot of deflections and steals. He’s long, he blocks shots. And then when he gets a defensive rebound, you got a fast-break started already." [...] During his sophomore year in UCLA, CBSSports.com wrote that Anderson was [...] "starting to look more and more like the Magic Johnson of the 2013–14 season in college basketball." [...] ESPN analyst Dick Vitale warned against calling him the next Magic Johnson, but stated that [...] "he has the mini-version of that kind of skill.” USA Today commented that he was [...] "kind of a poor man's Magic Johnson".|$|E
2500|$|Newark {{burned in}} 1967, where {{six days of}} rioting left 26 dead, 1500 injured, and the inner city a burned out shell. In Detroit in 1967, Governor George Romney sent in 7400 {{national}} guard troops to quell fire bombings, looting, and attacks on businesses and on police. Johnson finally sent in federal troops with tanks and machine guns. Detroit continued to burn for three more days until finally 43 were dead, 2250 were injured, 4000 were arrested; property damage ranged into the hundreds of millions. The biggest wave of riots came in April 1968 in over a hundred cities after the assassination of Martin Luther King. Johnson called for even more billions to be spent in the cities and another federal civil rights law regarding housing, but this fell on deaf ears. Johnson's popularity plummeted as a massive white political backlash took shape, reinforcing the sense Johnson had {{lost control of the}} streets of major cities as well as his party. Johnson created the Kerner Commission to study the problem of urban riots, headed by Illinois Governor Otto Kerner. According to press secretary George Christian, Johnson was unsurprised by the riots, saying: [...] "What did you expect? I don't know why we're so surprised. When you put your foot on a man's neck and hold him down for three hundred years, and then <b>you</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> up, what's he going to do? He's going to knock your block off." ...|$|E
