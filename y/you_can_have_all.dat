500|$|Before {{he played}} in {{first-class}} cricket, Boycott played for the successful Barnsley Cricket Club, making his debut in 1959 and becoming a regular team member that year alongside Dickie Bird, Bill Foord and Michael Parkinson. In one match, Boycott faced a delivery from Foord which he dispatched to the boundary for four. Foord turned to Parkinson and asked: [...] "Christ almighty, what's this lad's name?" [...] Bird remembered his [...] "application, concentration and absolute belief in himself. He had one great gift, mental strength. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> the coaching {{in the world but}} the most important thing is to be mentally strong." ...|$|E

For you'll be the same till it is cracked, like an insect in its skin. If one cracked your skull perhaps one might get a spontaneous, passionate woman out of you, with real sensuality.

Unremarkable ridges of moor-like hills running away, perhaps {{to a bunch of}} {{dramatic}} peaks on the southwest. This gives a sense of space, which is so lacking in Italy. Lovely space about one, and traveling distances--nothing finished, nothing final. It is like liberty itself, after the peaky confinement of Sicily.

I mean, people keep saying they don't want any tax increases, but they don't want to have their Medicare cut, they don't want to have their Medicaid cut or they don't want to have their Social Security touched an inch. Well, it's about time someone tells them, you can't have it, baby...You have to make a choice. And I fear that—and I always thought, you see, that that was the Conservative position. The Conservative is the Grinch who says no. And, in some ways, I think this in the long run, looking back in history, was Reagan's {{greatest}} bad legacy, which is he tried to tell people <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> it <b>all.</b> We can't <b>have</b> it all." ...|$|R

For this, the young princess is the dance of the seven veils for King Herod and proves that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> it <b>all</b> with her ​​beauty and sensuality, even if it might be worth his life. This article aims to show how eroticism, desire, death and the body lead the direction of Wilde’s version, based on the works as Eroticism, George Bataille (1987), The double flame, Octavio Paz (1994), The dangerous body of Linda Hutcheon. Therefore, {{it can be seen}} that often, that desire can be matched is required great sacrifices, even if it takes death as a result and consummation...|$|R

6000|$|... "But {{when you}} come in sight of Moffitt--my, oh, my! Well, you come in smell of it about as soon. That gas out there ain't odorless, like the Pittsburg gas, and so it's {{perfectly}} safe; but the smell isn't bad--about as bad as the finest kind of benzine. Well, the first thing that strikes you {{when you come}} to Moffitt is the notion {{that there has been a}} good warm, growing rain, and the town's come up overnight. That's in the suburbs, the annexes, and additions. But it ain't shabby--no shanty-farm business; nice brick and frame houses, some of 'em Queen Anne style, and all of 'em looking as if they had come to stay. And when you drive up from the depot you think everybody's moving. Everything seems to be piled into the street; old houses made over, and new ones going up everywhere. You know the kind of street Main Street always used to be in our section--half plank-road and turnpike, and the rest mud-hole, and a lot of stores and doggeries strung along with false fronts a story higher than the back, and here and there a decent building with the gable end to the public; and a court-house and jail and two taverns and three or four churches. Well, they're all there in Moffitt yet, but architecture has struck it hard, and they've got a lot of new buildings that needn't be ashamed of themselves anywhere; the new court-house is as big as St. Peter's, and the Grand Opera-house is in the highest style of the art. You can't buy a lot on that street for much less than you can buy a lot in New York--or you couldn't when the boom was on; I saw the place just when the boom was in its prime. I went out there to work the newspapers in the syndicate business, and I got one of their men to write me a real bright, snappy account of the gas; and they just took me in their arms and showed me everything. Well, it was wonderful, and it was beautiful, too! To see a whole community stirred up like that was--just like a big boy, all hope and high spirits, and no discount on the remotest future; nothing but perpetual boom to the end of time--I tell you it warmed your blood. Why, there were some things about it that made you think what a nice kind of world this would be if people ever took hold together, instead of each fellow fighting it out on his own hook, and devil take the hindmost. They made up their minds at Moffitt that if they wanted their town to grow they'd got to keep their gas public property. So they extended their corporation line so as to take in pretty much the whole gas region round there; and then the city took possession of every well that was put down, and held it for the common good. Anybody that's a mind to come to Moffitt and start any kind of manufacture can have all the gas he wants free; and for fifteen dollars a year <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> the gas you want to heat and light your private house. The people hold on to it for themselves, and, as I say, it's a grand sight to see a whole community hanging together and working for the good of all, instead of splitting up into as many different cut-throats as there are able-bodied citizens. See that fellow?" [...] Fulkerson broke off, and indicated with a twirl of his head a short, dark, foreign-looking man going out of the door. [...] "They say that fellow's a Socialist. I think it's a shame they're allowed to come here. If they don't like the way we manage our affairs let 'em stay at home," [...] Fulkerson continued. [...] "They do a lot of mischief, shooting off their mouths round here. I believe in free speech and all that; but I'd like to see these fellows shut up in jail and left to jaw one another to death. We don't want any of their poison." ...|$|E

5000|$|The series finale {{received}} unanimous acclaim from {{critics and}} from {{fans of the}} series. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix opined that [...] "the finale gave these ridiculous cartoon characters three dimensions {{for at least a}} few moments so they could say proper goodbyes to each other, and to us." [...] He elaborated that [...] "Liz and Tracy back at the strip club was a blunt but heartfelt summation of their whole relationship, and Jack on the boat giving a long preamble about the true nature of their friendship before saying that he loved Liz (which Liz spared him from actually having to do by saying it to him first) was a thing of beauty." [...] In conclusion, he wrote that [...] "would miss this show, but this ending felt close to perfect." [...] Roth Cornet of IGN gave the episode a [...] "masterpiece" [...] 10 out of 10 and commented [...] "30 Rock had the rare ability to provide both comedy and earned sentiment. That has never been more true than in these final two episodes" [...] and concluded that [...] "Jack goes back to his roots, his true-love, after a gloriously short-lived soul searching sea adventure: housewares. Liz, once and for all, embraces the fact that, yes, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> it <b>all,</b> but [...] "having it all" [...] ultimately means truly knowing and accepting yourself, and having the willingness to compromise. And with that, a series that could have been an ingenious bit of comedy, but not much more, became a show about people and relationships that will stay with us well past the final fade to black tonight." ...|$|R

[...] "It's written in my own hand {{and there are two}} witnesses to my signature--one a clergyman, sir, and the other a doctor, they thinking it was a will or something. I had it in my mind to send that to Scotland Yard, and then I remembered that I hadn't a penny to leave my little girl. I began to wonder--think as meanly of me as you like, sir--how I could still make some money out of this. I happened to know that you were none too friendly disposed towards Sir Timothy. This confession of mine, if it wouldn't mean hanging, would mean imprisonment {{for the rest of his}} life. You could make a better bargain with him than me, sir. Do you want to hold him in your power? If so, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> this confession, <b>all</b> signed and everything, for two hundred pounds, and as I live, sir, that two hundred pounds is to pay for my funeral, and the balance for my little girl." ...|$|R
5000|$|After the tour, band manager Steve Sesnick {{managed to}} get a {{recording}} deal with Polydor UK to record a final Velvet Underground album. Alexander, Powers and Tucker were sent back to the United States by Sesnick, however, presumably for him to retain maximum control over the finished product. Thus, although Squeeze was released nominally as a Velvet Underground album, Yule was the only Velvet to actually perform on it. Yule later said, [...] "I don’t think Moe Tucker would have been expensive in money, but too costly in terms of 'management', meaning that she didn’t take a lot of bullshit and would have taken a lot of 'handling' on Sesnick's part." [...] Yule also recalled that the album [...] "was done with just me. All the basic tracks were laid down with drums and me. Ian Paice of Deep Purple played the drums. So he and I would lay down a track. How much interplay <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> when <b>all</b> it is is one guitar or a piano? <b>You</b> <b>can</b> hear that, it's kind of dead.

6000|$|Miss Crawford's uneasiness {{was much}} {{lightened}} by this conversation, {{and she walked}} home again in spirits which might have defied almost another week of the same small party in the same bad weather, had they been put to the proof; but as that very evening brought her brother down from London again in quite, or more than quite, his usual cheerfulness, she had nothing farther to try her own. His still refusing {{to tell her what}} he had gone for was but the promotion of gaiety; a day before it might have irritated, but now it was a pleasant joke--suspected only of concealing something planned as a pleasant surprise to herself. And the next day did bring a surprise to her. Henry had said he should just go and ask the Bertrams how they did, and be back in ten minutes, but he was gone above an hour; and when his sister, who had been waiting for him to walk with her in the garden, met him at last most impatiently in the sweep, and cried out, [...] "My dear Henry, where <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> been <b>all</b> this time?"

"Dear, dear Hetty, {{sweet as}} our love {{has been to}} me, sweet {{as it would be}} to me for you to love me always, I feel {{that it would have been}} better for us both if we had never had that happiness, and that it is my duty to ask you to love me and care for me as little as <b>you</b> <b>can.</b> The fault <b>has</b> <b>all</b> been mine, for though I have been unable to resist the longing to be near you, I <b>have</b> felt <b>all</b> the while that your affection for me might cause you grief.

40|$|Business have {{invested}} heavily toward business system applications {{in an effort}} toward process standardization and having a single version of the truth data-wise to no avail. Most businesses application architecture is littered with various enterprise business application solutions without ever achieving the promise of standardization on a single application footprint, or ever achieving the single version of the truth. ^ We can walk into Home Depot today and buy a standard bathroom sink faucet that we like from any manufacturer, bring it home and install it on our bathroom sink. This is the same with practically all the components used in our homes, from the windows, to the tubs, to the sinks and so on. This is achieved obviously because of standards, but the standards do not limit one {{to the point where}} they are difficult to implement. For example, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> bathrooms of <b>all</b> sizes using standard components. The standards in this case do not limit the size of the bathroom that one desires. We have made great strides in Information Technology (IT) in the area of object reusability applications and data integrations. However, we are constantly building and rebuilding databases/applications, moving data from one database/application to another over and over again. ^ This research will show how to we can utilize the Structured Query Language (SQL) Interceptor to help rational data movement among business application, and a mechanism toward business applications functionality interchangeability. The Interceptor deployed as a web services application, provides the middleware interoperability framework we are looking for to seamlessly integrate disparate business applications without impinging on the sources application or the target application. The Enterprise Interceptor: A Framework for Applications Interchangeability can be utilized to transform not only the way we build applications today, but the way we build applications in the future and how to better integrate our existing disparate business applications. By introducing the same principles and concepts as used in the construction of our homes, we can streamline applications deployment to the assembly of components from different vendors. Business application architect can then map the data to the targeted base repository. ...|$|R
