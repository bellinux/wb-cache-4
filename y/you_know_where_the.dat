500|$|Before {{starting}} a book Wodehouse would write {{up to four}} hundred pages of notes bringing together an outline of the plot; he acknowledged that [...] "It's the plots that I find so hard to work out. It takes {{such a long time}} to work one out." [...] He always completed the plot before working on specific character actions. For a novel the note-writing process could take up to two years, and he would usually have two or more novels in preparation simultaneously. After he had completed his notes, he would draw up a fuller scenario of about thirty thousand words, which ensured plot holes were avoided, and allowed for the dialogue to begin to develop. When interviewed in 1975 he revealed that [...] "For a humorous novel you've got to have a scenario, and you've got to test it so that <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> comedy comes in, where the situations come in... splitting it up into scenes (you can make a scene of almost anything) and have as little stuff in between as possible." [...] He preferred working between 4 and 7pm—but never after dinner—and would work seven days a week. In his younger years, he would write around two to three thousand words a day, although he slowed as he aged, so that in his nineties he would produce a thousand. The reduced speed in writing slowed his production of books: when younger he would produce a novel in about three months, while Bachelors Anonymous, published in 1973, took around six months.|$|E
