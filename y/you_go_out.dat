Each driver ran two laps, with the starting order determined by the competitor's fastest times. Martin Truex, Jr. clinched his third pole position of the season, {{with a time of}} 26.643. He was joined on the grid's front row by Kurt Busch. Johnson qualified third, Kahne took fourth, and Hamlin started fifth. Biffle, Kyle Busch, Stewart, Casey Mears and Martin completed the top ten positions. The three drivers that failed to qualify were Regan Smith, Kevin Conway and Brandon Ash. After the qualifier Truex said, [...] "(Today) we were pretty good in practice.

500|$|Madonna's {{version of}} the song begins {{with the sound of}} {{acoustic}} guitars and synth strings. Madonna's voice sounds high-pitched, eluding the deeper resonance of the tune. After the first verse, Tony Thompson starts playing the drums, which moves along the rhythm of the song. Towards the end, Madonna sings the song like a soul singer and the song ends with a gasp of breath. The song was recorded at Power Station Studio in Manhattan, New York. Rodgers recalled: [...] "Madonna had never performed with a live orchestra before. I was very much into doing everything live, so I just said, 'Madonna, <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> there and sing and we will follow you.' At first Madonna was hesitant, but the live setting ended up producing memorable results. She sang and she was overcome with emotions and she started crying, but I left it on the record." ...|$|E
500|$|Booker T. Jones {{is cited}} {{as being the}} bridge from rhythm and blues to rock. British organist James Taylor said the Hammond [...] "became popular [...] when people such as Booker T. & the M.G.'s and artists on the Stax Records label came over to London and played gigs." [...] Matthew Fisher first {{encountered}} the Hammond in 1966, having heard the Small Faces' Ian McLagan playing one. When Fisher {{asked if he could}} play it, McLagan told him, [...] "They're yelling out for Hammond players; why don't <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> and buy one for yourself?" [...] Fisher went on to play the organ lines on Procol Harum's [...] "A Whiter Shade of Pale", which topped the UK charts in the summer of 1967. Steve Winwood started his musical career with the Spencer Davis Group playing guitar and piano, but he switched to Hammond when he hired one to record [...] "Gimme Some Lovin'".|$|E
500|$|In [...] "Over and Over", Madonna sings about {{determination}} and picking yourself up from disappointments. The song consists of instrumentation from drums, synths {{and has a}} three-chord progression. An emotional moment occurred in the recording studio when Madonna covered the 1978 Rose Royce song [...] "Love Don't Live Here Anymore". Rodgers recalled: [...] "Madonna had never performed with a live orchestra before. I was very much into doing everything live, so I just said, 'Madonna, <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> there and sing and we will follow you.' At first Madonna was hesitant, but the live setting ended up producing memorable results. She sang and she was overcome with emotions and she started crying, but I left it on the record." [...] The song features Madonna's vocals supported by acoustic guitars and synth strings, with Thompson playing the drum in the second verse.

500|$|Wilkinson felt a deep bond {{of sympathy}} {{with the people of}} Jarrow and the loss of the {{shipyard}} which was the life-source of the town. [...] Early in 1934 she led a deputation of Jarrow's unemployed to meet the prime minister, MacDonald, in his nearby Seaham constituency. She records {{that at the end of}} the meeting MacDonald said to her: [...] "Ellen, why don't <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> and preach socialism, which is the only remedy for all this?" [...] This [...] "priceless remark", she says, brought home the [...] "reality and sham... of that warm but so easy sympathy". She became Jarrow's MP [...] in the general election of November 1935, when she won the seat with a majority of 2,360. In the opening debate of the new parliamentary session, on 9 December 1935, she pleaded on behalf of her new constituents: [...] "These are skilled fitters, men who have built destroyers and battleships and the finest passenger ships... The years go on and nothing is done... this is a desperately urgent matter and [...] something should be done to get work to these areas which, Heaven knows, want work." ...|$|E
500|$|The album's {{opening track}} [...] "Airbag" [...] was {{inspired}} by the music of DJ Shadow and is underpinned by an electronic drum beat programmed from a seconds-long recording of Selway's drumming. The band sampled the drum track with a digital sampler and edited it with a Macintosh computer, but admitted to making approximations in emulating Shadow's style due to their programming inexperience. The bassline in [...] "Airbag" [...] stops and starts unexpectedly, achieving an effect similar to 1970s dub. The song's references to automobile accidents and reincarnation were inspired by a magazine article titled [...] "An Airbag Saved My Life" [...] and The Tibetan Book of the Dead. Yorke wrote [...] "Airbag" [...] about the illusion of safety offered by modern transit, and [...] "the idea that whenever <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> on the road you could be killed." [...] The BBC wrote of the influence of J. G. Ballard, especially his 1973 novel Crash on the song's lyrical content. Music journalist Tim Footman notes the song's technical innovations and lyrical concerns demonstrate the [...] "key paradox" [...] of the album: [...] "the musicians and producer are delighting in the sonic possibilities of modern technology; the singer, meanwhile, is railing against its social, moral, and psychological impact.... It's a contradiction mirrored in the culture clash of the music, with the 'real' guitars negotiating an uneasy stand-off with the hacked-up, processed drums." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Till the World Ends" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Dr. Luke and Max Martin, with additional writing by American recording artist Kesha and Alexander Kronlund, and additional production by Billboard. In {{an interview for}} Spin on February 11, 2011, Kesha announced she had co-written the song with Luke and Martin for Femme Fatale. She explained it was inspired by [...] "me imagining [...] and any female musician touring the world. When <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>out,</b> and you're having an amazing, magical night and you don't {{want to go to}} sleep and you want it to last until the world ends." [...] On March 2, 2011, the single's cover art, in which Spears appears sitting on a couch in a sweater and heels, was posted at Deezer.com. This was followed by a 30-second snippet of the song, which appeared at Amazon.de. [...] "Till the World Ends" [...] leaked online on March 3, 2011, which prompted Spears to post hours later on her Twitter account, [...] "Looks like the cat's out of the bag..." [...] She formally premiered the single at On Air with Ryan Seacrest, on March 4, 2011, at 10:00 EST (15:00 UTC). [...] "Till the World Ends" [...] was made available on iTunes the same day, several days earlier than originally planned. Following the announcement, Kesha spoke to MTV News stating that [...] "I consider myself a songwriter before and above everything else, so it's an honor to write for one of pop music's biggest icons." [...] During an interview with Seacrest, Spears described [...] "Till the World Ends" [...] as [...] "fun. I like it. It's good energy.

500|$|In 2005, good-girl Cassie {{becomes a}} rebellious teenager; Nick and Sharon have a {{difficult}} time dealing with her. Cassie has a crush on bad-boy Daniel Romalotti (Michael Graziadei), who is dating Lily Winters (Christel Khalil). One night, against her parents' wishes she sneaks out to a party. In a ploy to impress a drunken Daniel she attempts to drive him home, despite being underage. The car crashes, leaving them with no memory of the accident. Daniel is thought to have been driving, and is blamed for the accident. Cassie becomes hospitalized and escapes to find Daniel to tell him she was driving, but is soon re-admitted. During the May 24 episode, Cassie dies with Nick and Sharon at her side. Grimes said she did not think Cassie would die, but if it was [...] "meant to happen, it's meant to happen". The actress found filming her last scenes with Case and Morrow [...] "ridiculously hard". Case also found taping the scenes devastating: [...] "It was too real for Joshua and me to even go through it. We did it in one take. [...] The scene is still devastating in my mind and Joshua’s. [...] It’s almost not watchable. [...] If it comes on, I can’t get through it". Daniel is cleared of all charges and Nick and Sharon begin Cassie's Foundation, a movement to prevent teenage drinking and driving. According to Case, when Sharon loses something in her life it [...] "reminds her and reactivates Cassie’s death for her". After Nick cheats on Sharon following Cassie's death, Case said it [...] "makes you so fearful {{that you are going to}} be alone for the rest of your life; that no matter what <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> in life to create, it’s going to be ruined anyway". The actress also believed that Sharon lost her identity after Cassie's death. In 2012, during a court battle over Newman Enterprises (the family company), Nick stated that Sharon's mental problems date to Cassie's death.|$|E

2500|$|Independent prostitutes {{who worked}} the street were on the next higher level. Besides {{directly}} displaying their charms to potential clients they had recourse to publicity; sandals with marked soles have been found which left an imprint that stated [...] AKOLOUTHEI ("Follow me") on the ground. They also used makeup, apparently quite outrageously. Eubulus, a comic author, offers these courtesans derision: [...] "plastered over with layers of white lead, … jowls smeared with mulberry juice.

2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 2002, Roth and Hagar teamed up in the Song for Song, the Heavyweight Champs of Rock and Roll tour (also known as the 'Sans-Halen' or 'Sam & Dave' Tour). The joint tour {{headlining}} both former lead singers attracted media and audience fascination because it seemed more improbable than even a Van Halen tour with Roth or Hagar could be. The tour drew large crowds and featured no opening acts, Roth and Hagar alternating opening as the first act during the tour. In an interview, Roth contrasted his personality with Hagar's, saying, [...] "He's {{the kind of guy}} <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> with to split a bottle with a friend. I'm the kind of guy <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> with if you want to split your friend with a bottle." [...] Michael Anthony guested with Hagar's band, The Waboritas, numerous times and sometimes even sang lead vocals. During performances, Hagar would tease Anthony by asking, [...] "Do the brothers know you're here?" [...] Anthony never played with Roth. Cherone appeared on occasion. Hagar released a live album (Hallelujah), featuring vocals by Mike and Gary, and a documentary DVD, Long Road to Cabo, about touring with Roth. Next, Hagar joined with Joe Satriani and Journey guitarist Neal Schon to form a side project, Planet Us, along with Michael Anthony and Deen Castronovo (also of Journey) on drums. The band recorded just two songs and played live a few times before dissolving when Hagar and Anthony rejoined Van Halen. While the two lead singers promoted the tour and publicly claimed mutual respect, rumors of bitter acrimony and mutual loathing between the two singers swirled. The allegations were later supported in back stage video, which showed Roth and Hagar camps maintaining strict separation.|$|E

He {{selected}} Tinderbox for his [...] "5 albums forever" [...] list, saying, [...] "They played so well together; I saw them in concert and I never forgot that moment". Billy Howerdel of A Perfect Circle rated {{it as his}} all-time favourite album [...] Howerdel described it as [...] "one of the spookiest records I've ever heard. Some of the songs on there have such a dense atmosphere. Sometimes when I'm stuck, I'll listen to that. It's like sometimes when you have no inspiration and <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> {{and look at the}} moon, that's kind of what that record is for me". Jenny Lee Lindberg [...] of Warpaint cited the band among her influences, as well as the song [...] "Umbrella", initially included in the track listing of the 1986 CD version. She said: [...] "This is a song that my husband and I bonded over – we’d definitely heard it individually before, but one day we were just playing the album and that song stopped us in our tracks… played it on repeat for the whole night. I understand why some people can hear a little Siouxsie in what we do." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gartside's {{change in}} beliefs {{directly}} affected {{the music and}} particularly the lyrics of Songs to Remember. In one interview with NME in October 1981 he told the paper, [...] "The politics have moved from an essentialist and reductionist position in which we believed in a history of science which could {{make sense of the}} future to one that realized that what you've got is needs, demands, and desires, and <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> and you fight for them. Which means that your music will at points be indexed fairly clearly to Politics with a big 'P' and at other points will cut across it completely." [...] In another interview with The Face the following year Gartside said, [...] "My loss has been political conviction, the idea of a correct understanding of the past, present and future (Marxism). I've always been obsessively concerned that my understanding of political truth should be scientifically grounded. Many songs [...] are about what happens when the anchor points of political, moral or religious understanding fall away." [...] For example, he stated that the track [...] "Faithless" [...] was about [...] "how living without faith brings you both happiness and sadness. I've never had any religion, except maybe politics, although I am interested in having some means of achieving social order and progress." ...|$|E
