500|$|Bowie himself remembered {{almost nothing}} of the album's production, not even the studio, later admitting, [...] "I know it was in LA because I've read it was". The singer {{was not alone in}} his use of cocaine during the sessions, Carlos Alomar commenting, [...] "if there's a line of coke which is going to keep <b>you</b> <b>awake</b> till 8 a.m. so that you can do your guitar part, you do the line of coke... the coke use is driven by the inspiration." [...] Like Bowie, Earl Slick had {{somewhat}} vague memories of the recording: [...] "That album's a little fuzzy—for the obvious reasons! We were in the studio and it was nuts—a lot of hours, a lot of late nights." ...|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} general acclaim from critics. Manny Faces from BirthPlace {{cited the}} song as an improvement from her previous material, writing [...] "It’s a little harder, {{a little less}} sloppy {{and a little more}} promising than some of her previous efforts, many of which have drowned in sonic experimentation that, in some opinions (mine), haven’t done her any favors". A writer for PAPER hailed the track as [...] " [...] first 2013 party jam", adding that the song [...] "will jolt <b>you</b> <b>awake</b> this Wednesday morning more quickly than that venti coffee you've been nursing since 9 am". Rolling Stone writer Jody Rosen gave [...] "BBD" [...] three-and-a-half stars out of five, describing the song as [...] "a typically fleet, flashy collection of disses and boasts that glory in estrogen power, Sapphic delights, and the fun of cuckolding stupid dudes". Spin writer Marc Hogan thought that the track reflected well on Banks' sense of style, writing [...] "With the squiggly high-end and wobbly sub-bass of what we’re really calling trap-rave now, huh, plus some masterfully timed quiet-loud dynamic shifts, the track displays the virtuosically foul-mouthed rapper’s usual immaculately stylish beat selection".|$|E
500|$|To find {{a record}} label, the band says [...] "we pretty much just sent {{packages}} to every record label, a shit load {{of phone calls}} harassing people." [...] In 2001, From Autumn to Ashes performed in Long Island with Ferret Music bands Skycamefalling and Martyr AD, where the founder of Ferret Music, Carl Severson, attended. The following day, Severson contacted the group and they were soon signed in 2001. The band's debut full-length album, Too Bad You're Beautiful, was released on August 14, 2001. Too Bad You're Beautiful, which was written entirety about a relationship Perri had, sold over 100,000 records in the United States, and thus, From Autumn to Ashes became the highest selling band on Ferret Records. It had also featured vocals on the song [...] "Short Stories With Tragic Endings" [...] from Melanie Wills of the band One True Thing. A reviewer on Punk News stated the album {{had the ability to}} [...] "put you to sleep like a baby's lullaby, then smash <b>you</b> <b>awake</b> with the most gut wrenching, floor pounding hardcore this side of the Mississippi freakin' river." [...] In 2000 under the music label Tribunal, the band released the Sin, Sorrow and Sadness EP on March 5, and later took part in the Warped Tour during the summer months. In 2002 the band employed a live drummer for a number of songs so that Mark could focus on songs that he did more vocals in.|$|E

2500|$|In {{his review}} for The Washington Post, Gary Arnold called the film [...] "a wretched excess." [...] Jay Scott, {{in his review}} for the Globe and Mail, called the film [...] "a hell of an {{antidote}} to E.T." [...] In his review for Newsweek, David Ansen wrote, [...] "Astonishingly, Carpenter blows it. There's {{a big difference between}} shock effects and suspense, and in sacrificing everything at the altar of gore, Carpenter sabotages the drama. The Thing is so single-mindedly determined to keep <b>you</b> <b>awake</b> that it almost puts you to sleep." [...] David Denby of New York magazine wrote that the original story may have influenced Invasion of the Body Snatchers and Alien, but a new adaptation seems derivative. [...] In his book Science Fiction (1984), Phil Hardy described the film as a [...] "surprising failure" [...] and [...] "Carpenter's most unsatisfying film to date." [...] The review noted that the narrative [...] "seems little more than an excuse for the various set-pieces of special effects and Russell's hero {{is no more than a}} cypher compared to Kenneth Tobey's rounded character in Howard Hawks' The Thing".|$|E
