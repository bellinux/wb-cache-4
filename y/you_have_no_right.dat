500|$|After enrolling Kaliokalani as a {{permanent}} student, his step-grandmother and hānai mother Kaiahua removed him from the school. She was initially supportive of his enrollment. But after learning {{that he was being}} asked to do chores such as watering the plants in the school yard which she considered servant's work, Kaiahua detained him at her home when he and the other children visited her home during a school outing, on November 7, 1841. In order to bring Kaliokalani back to school, kahu John Papa ʻĪʻī openly confronted the high chiefess, stepped on her lap and seized the boy from her hands. ʻĪʻī told the chiefess: [...] "Not only is it asked of your moʻopuna [...] but of all the boys, of me, and of their teachers. This strengthens the body like all other kinds of exercise, to the benefit of the child. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>right</b> in this matter, as the children are placed in my care by the king, and only the personal needs of the child are your affair." ...|$|E
2500|$|Australian Major General Jim Molan (retired), {{who served}} as chief of {{operations}} of the Iraq multinational force in 2004–05, stated that [...] "The Goldstone report is an opinion by one group of people putting forward their judgments, with limited access to the facts, and reflecting their own prejudices. The difference in tone and attitude in the report when discussing Israeli and Hamas actions is surprising." ... "as a soldier who has run a war against an opponent not dissimilar to Hamas, facing problems perhaps similar to those faced by Israeli commanders, my sympathies tend to lie with the Israelis." ... "But having stated my prejudice, I think I may be more honest than Goldstone, who seems to pass off his prejudices in a report that cannot be based on fact, and uses judicial language and credibility to do so. It comes down to equality of scepticism: if you refuse to believe anything the Israelis say, then <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>right</b> to unquestioningly accept what Hamas says." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, sir? But <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>right</b> {{to speak}} to me in that style. You know that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>right</b> to call me by my name in that way!" ...|$|E
60|$|GLORIA. <b>You</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>right</b> {{to give me}} your sister's name. I don't know her.|$|R
6000|$|... "I see," [...] she said. [...] "I see. I am {{bringing}} this fate upon you. When you sent Lionel upon that errand you voluntarily offered up {{your life to}} restore me to my own people. <b>You</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>right</b> to do this without first consulting me. <b>You</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>right</b> to suppose I would be a party to such a thing. I will not accept the sacrifice. I will not, Sir Oliver." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, but you know," [...] said Jonas, [...] "that <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>right</b> to {{stop him}} by violence. That always makes the {{difficulty}} worse." ...|$|R

60|$|RIDGEON [sharply] Yes, {{of course}} I should mind very much. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>right</b> to ask.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{hate the}} very name of John Caryll, Earl of Ostermore," [...] said he, [...] "as must every decent {{man who knows}} {{the truth of what}} the life of that satyr holds. If I have {{suffered}} you to bear his name, it is to the end that it should remind you daily that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>right</b> to it, that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>right</b> to any name." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'But <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>right</b> to think, sir,' {{retorted}} the other. 'What {{the devil}} has {{a man at}} your time of life to do with thinking?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{but after}} it was done, instead of getting praise--that is, if you weren't killed--you'd be simply told <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>right</b> to {{undertake}} such an affair." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{not touch}} her, man," [...] called de Marmont {{in a loud}} voice, [...] "a coward like <b>you</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>right</b> to touch {{the hand of a}} good woman." ...|$|R

60|$|I don't want to seem unkind to you, mother, but I think <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>right</b> to {{ask about}} my private affairs.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{nobody would}} <b>have</b> thought <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>right</b> who saw your face." [...] He replied by {{asking her to}} make room for him, and talking of the play.|$|R
6000|$|... "We'll have a {{policeman}} settle this," [...] answered the oldest Rover boy. [...] "This is our property, {{and we can}} easily prove it. <b>You</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>right</b> to touch it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, it wasn't me, and <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>right</b> {{to pounce}} on me as you did," [...] grumbled Nat Poole. [...] "I am going to report it to Doctor Clay." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Stop that!" [...] {{cried the}} King Squirrel, {{chattering}} and whisking about. [...] "You mustn't release our prisoners. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>right</b> to." ...|$|E
