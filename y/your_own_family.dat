2500|$|Advice on cousin {{marriage}} in the Middle East {{has not always been}} positive, however. Al-Maydani makes the following exhortation: [...] "Marry the distant, but not the near." [...] The reason given for the inadvisability of cousin marriages is most frequently the belief that the offspring of such marriages will be feeble. An early Arab author, Ibn 'Abd Rabbihi, states in his work Kitab al-'iqd al-farid of a hero that [...] "He is a hero not borne by the cousin (of his father), he is not weakly; for the seed of relations brings forth feeble fruit." [...] Abu Hamid al-Ghazali (1059â€“1111) in his principal ethical work, the Ihya 'ulum al-din, gives the different reason that [...] "the woman should not be a near relative of the husband, because near relationship diminishes the sensuous desire." [...] Finally the ancient Arabic poet 'Amr b. Kulthum states, [...] "Do not marry in <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>family,</b> for domestic enmity arises therefrom." [...] Similar sentiments are expressed by certain Moroccan and Syrian proverbs.|$|E

5000|$|Judge Reddihough:The {{prosecution}} rightly made {{it plain}} {{that there was}} no allegation against you, Munir Hussain, in respect of the force you used against Salem in defending <b>your</b> <b>own</b> home and <b>family</b> or of the force used by either of you in apprehending Salem. However, the attack which then occurred was totally unnecessary and amounted to a very violent revenge attack on a defenceless man. It may be that some members of the public or media commentators will assert that Salem deserved what happened to him, and that you should not have been prosecuted and need not be punished. The courts must make it clear that such conduct is criminal and unacceptable ... If persons were permitted to take the law into their own hands and inflict their own instant and violent punishment on an apprehended offender rather than letting the criminal justice system take its course, then {{the rule of law and}} our system of criminal justice, which are hallmarks of a civilised society, would collapse.|$|R
5000|$|Fox, an {{apprentice}} coach builder from the Falls Road in Belfast, Northern Ireland, joined the IRA in 1969 aged eighteen. He explained his motivation for joining the IRA in a 1998 {{interview with the}} Irish News, stating: [...] "I was almost shot in a gun attack at Norfolk Street. I came away wanting a gun. It was survival. You wanted to protect <b>your</b> <b>own</b> people ... my <b>family</b> and myself. When the barricades went up I wanted a gun so I approached this fella {{who was in the}} IRA and asked for gun and he said: could I shoot a British soldier? At that time I hadn't the idea that it was the British government's fault." [...] In 1981, Fox, serving a twelve-year sentence in the Maze Prison for possession of explosives and bombing a hotel, joined the hunger strike on 24 August, replacing Paddy Quinn who was taken off the strike by his family. Fox ended his strike after 32 days without food on 24 September after doctors warned him he would be dead within days due to an obstructed kidney.|$|R
