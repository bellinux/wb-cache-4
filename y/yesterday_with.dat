[...] The author further interpreted it as [...] "I always feel the urge to make a fresh start" [...] suggesting {{this could be the}} [...] "bleak acceptance of the ideological and economic codes that mold our lives in accordance with the imperative of planned obsolescence, or as a hopeful embracing of the genuine prospects of renewal and change." [...] Cavallaro suggested that despite the feminine appearance of the [...] "angel", it could be of a [...] "preternatural order", making gender or sex distinctions irrelevant. Miyazaki referred to the angelic creature as [...] "tori no hito" [...] or [...] "a bird's person" [...] which is the nickname of Nausicaä from his Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind manga and film. Cavallaro noted another visual correspondence to Only <b>Yesterday</b> <b>with</b> the oppressive urban environment and the freedom of open spaces.|$|E
500|$|For {{several years}} Disney had been {{considering}} building a theme park. When he visited Griffith Park in Los Angeles with his daughters, {{he wanted to}} be in a clean, unspoiled park, where both children and their parents could have fun. He visited the Tivoli Gardens in Copenhagen, Denmark, and was heavily influenced by the cleanliness and layout of the park. In March 1952 he received zoning permission to build a theme park in Burbank, near the Disney studios. This site proved too small, and a larger plot in Anaheim, [...] south of the studio, was purchased. To distance the project from the studiowhich might attract the criticism of shareholdersDisney formed WED Enterprises (now Walt Disney Imagineering) and used his own money to fund a group of designers and animators to work on the plans; those involved became known as [...] "Imagineers". After obtaining bank funding he invited other stockholders, American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatrespart of American Broadcasting Company (ABC)and Western Printing and Lithographing Company. In mid-1954, Disney sent his Imagineers to every amusement park in the U.S. to analyze what worked and what pitfalls or problems there were in the various locations and incorporated their findings into his design. Construction work started in July 1954, and Disneyland opened in July 1955; the opening ceremony was broadcast on ABC, which reached 70million viewers. The park was designed as a series of themed lands, linked by the central Main Street, U.S.A.a replica of the main street in his hometown of Marceline. The connected themed areas were Adventureland, Frontierland, Fantasyland and Tomorrowland. The park also contained the narrow gauge Disneyland Railroad that linked the lands; around the outside of the park was a high berm to separate the park from the outside world. An editorial in The New York Times considered that Disney had [...] "tastefully combined some of the pleasant things of <b>yesterday</b> <b>with</b> fantasy and dreams of tomorrow". Although there were early minor problems with the park, it was a success, and after a month's operation, Disneyland was receiving over 20,000 visitors a day; by the end of its first year, it attracted 3.6million guests.|$|E
