500|$|In an on-set {{interview}} with The Huffington Post, actor John Noble {{explained that the}} episode's primary storyline concerned the bridge between the two worlds. The third season finale, he explained, ended with the two universes healing themselves {{with the help of}} a [...] "bridge". He remarked, [...] "What happens if that bridge now begins to be used as a conduit for evil? That’s the issue we’re facing. What do <b>you</b> <b>do?</b> <b>What</b> do you do with this wonderful discovery? Do you keep it? What do you lose if you lose it? For example, if we didn’t have that , we... wouldn’t have all these wonderful characters that we’ve grown to love. What would happen? I think we have to face that issue. We have to face the issue of 'How long can you keep this alive, this link between interlacing the two universes?'" ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the first}} night of the 2008 Democratic National Convention, Craig Robinson {{introduced}} his younger sister. She delivered her speech, during which she sought to portray herself and her family as the embodiment of the American Dream. Obama said she and her husband believe [...] "that you work hard for what you want in life, that your word is your bond, and <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> you say you're going to do, that you treat people with dignity and respect, even if you don't know them, and even if you don't agree with them." [...] She also emphasized loving her country, in response to criticism for her previous statements about feeling proud of her country for the first time, where the original statement was seen as a gaffe. That keynote address was largely well-received and drew mostly positive reviews. A Rasmussen Reports poll found that her favorability among Americans reached 55%.|$|E

Jonathan Davis later confirmed the record deal: [...] "We're going to go to Roadrunner. [...] real exciting for us, too, because they're one of the last record companies to let <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> you want to do." [...] Davis continued, [...] "All the great bands around are on that label and everything seems to just work out right and it seems like a good home for us right now." [...] The lead single, [...] "Oildale", was made available for streaming in May 2010. [...] "Oildale (Leave Me Alone)" [...] was simultaneously released to radio stations, and became a top-ten hit on the Billboard Active rock and Mainstream Rock airplay charts. A music video, directed by Phil Mucci, received an exclusive premiere on MTV2.|$|E

500|$|Moore {{began writing}} the series very early on, hoping to avoid {{publication}} delays {{such as those}} faced by the DC limited series Camelot 3000. When writing the script for the first issue, Moore said he realized, [...] "I only had enough plot for six issues. We were contracted for 12!" [...] His solution was to alternate issues that dealt with the overall plot of the series with origin issues for the characters. Moore wrote very detailed scripts for Gibbons to work from. Gibbons recalled that [...] "he script for {{the first issue of}} Watchmen was, I think, 101 pages of typescript—single-spaced—with no gaps between the individual panel descriptions or, indeed, even between the pages." [...] Upon receiving the scripts, the artist had to number each page [...] "in case I drop them on the floor, because it would take me two days to put them back in the right order", and used a highlighter pen to single out lettering and shot descriptions; he remarked, [...] "It takes quite a bit of organizing before you can actually put pen to paper." [...] Despite Moore's detailed scripts, his panel descriptions would often end with the note [...] "If that doesn't work for <b>you,</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> works best"; Gibbons nevertheless worked to Moore's instructions. In fact, Gibbons only suggested a single change to the script: a compression of Ozymandias' narration while he was preventing a sneak attack by Rorschach, as he felt that the dialog was too long to fit with the amount of action expressed; Moore agreed and re-wrote the scene. Gibbons {{had a great deal of}} autonomy in developing the visual look of Watchmen, and frequently inserted background details that Moore admitted he did not notice until later. Moore occasionally contacted fellow comics writer Neil Gaiman for answers to research questions and for quotes to include in issues.|$|E

Molland later {{described}} his dire economic circumstances: [...] "Thank God I had guitars and I was able to sell some of that stuff. We were flat broke, and that's happened to me three times, where my wife and I have had to sell off everything and go and stay with her parents or do whatever. I installed carpeting for a while in Los Angeles and stuff like that. <b>You</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> you've got to do to survive." [...] In London, Evans briefly had jobs insulating pipes, and driving a taxi. Collins was having trouble paying the lease on the group's two-room rehearsal studio at No. 6 Denmark Street, London. After advertising for new occupants, he was contacted by Malcolm McLaren, manager of the Sex Pistols, who gave Collins £650 (...) and a Fender Rhodes piano as down payment.|$|E

2500|$|In the lead-up to the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in 2012, Wang {{was seen}} by {{observers}} as a rising political star, with a diverse political pedigree spanning the realms of high finance, regional government, and policy development and execution. Wang ultimately entered {{the ranks of the}} Politburo Standing Committee, considered the pinnacle of power in China, at the 18th Party Congress, taking on the job of the Secretary of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, the party's top anti-graft body. Xi Jinping became General Secretary of the Communist Party of China at the same Congress. [...] The appointment was unexpected given Wang's experience in the economic realm; he was seen as a more likely candidate for executive Vice-Premier. [...] The decision to hand Wang the disciplinary portfolio seemed to have come as a surprise even to Wang himself: in video footage of a leaked CCDI conference after taking the helm of the body, Wang said of the decision, [...] "you can go look at media reports before the 18th Congress, who knew Wang Qishan was going to become secretary of the CCDI?...
