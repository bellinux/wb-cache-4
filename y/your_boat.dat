500|$|Eric Goldman of IGN {{scored the}} episode 7.7 out of 10, praising the plot and the {{introduction}} of Hall/Graviton, but criticizing the amount of humor and MCU references. David Sims of The A.V. Club scored the episode a 'B', calling it [...] "the first episode to show some potential for originality around the corner". He praised the character development, specifically for Coulson and Skye, {{and the introduction}} of Hall/Graviton, but criticized Quinn as [...] "barely a step above a generic Miami Vice villain and whose motives would be totally uninteresting if they were ever made clear to us". He also found Dalton to be [...] "the latest in a line of dull Whedon hunks with just a glimmer of personality." [...] The Guardians Graeme Virtue felt that [...] "If Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. hasn't been levitating <b>your</b> <b>boat</b> so far, this breezy episode probably didn't do that much to change your mind. If you're not in the mood, the endless quipping can seem exhausting, but at least there was some incremental character development." [...] He had especial praise for the introduction of Hall/Graviton, and felt that Hart's performance as the character topped Samuel L. Jackson's cameo from the previous episode.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the course}} of the night a steamer was sighted from the northward and came within hailing {{distance}} of the shipwrecked crew. At this time all hands were floating {{in the vicinity of the}} spot where the brig foundered. Their voices were evidently heard on board, as Captain Gallant was able to converse with the man on the forecastle head. The query came from the steamer, [...] "Are you in a boat?" [...] Captain Gallant replied, [...] "No send us <b>your</b> <b>boat,</b> we are on planking". A few moments afterwards the steamer went astern and left the shipwrecked men to perish. During the day three other steamers were sighted, all southbound. The first was the South Australian, and the second was one of the Hawkesbury river boats. Both vessels, however, were too far out to hear voices. A few hours afterwards the City of Grafton passed within 50 yards of Captain Gallant and the cook, but although renewed efforts were made by the now exhausted men to attract attention, the vessel passed by without noticing them.|$|E
2500|$|Hinckley {{introduced}} the JetStick, Dual Guard composite material, {{and the use}} of fiberglass. The first experiments with fiberglas began during the 1950s and concluded with the creation of the B40 in 1959. Despite much criticism such as the comparison of fiberglass to “frozen snot,” Hinckley used the material in boatbuilding [...] Hinckley created Dual Guard technology in 1999, a composite composed of an aramid and carbon fiber, aimed at creating a stronger and more efficient hull. [...] In 2016, the company launched a remote monitoring system called OnWatch. OnWatch uses a series of sensors to track numerous data points on a boat and relay them via a cellular system to servers that update a mobile Web site (it feels like an app when you add the OnWatch icon to your smartphone homescreen). Once you log in, it gives you a homescreen with an at-a-glance understanding of how <b>your</b> <b>boat</b> is doing, from technical details such as engine status, bilge, battery, and fuel-tank levels, to the state of your shore power connectivity.|$|E
2500|$|Nathan Lee of The Village Voice {{said the}} film [...] "works despite feeling both over-familiar and over-ambitious. It crescendos with a {{legitimate}} {{sense of wonder}} (if not profundity) {{thanks in large part}} to the luminous and uncanny score by electro legends Underworld." [...] Writing for The New York Times, Manohla Dargis viewed director Boyle as a [...] "first-rate, seemingly sweat-free entertainer" [...] who always [...] "sells the goods smoothly, along with the chills, the laughs and, somewhat less often, the tears." [...] She went on to say, [...] "He's wickedly good at making you jump and squirm in your seat, which he does often in [...] "Sunshine," [...] but he tends to avoid tapping into deep wells of emotion." [...] Wesley Morris in The Boston Globe mused that if the film didn't [...] "float <b>your</b> <b>boat</b> as a work of science-fiction, action, philosophy, heliocentrism, or staggering visual spectacle (although, it really should), then it certainly succeeds as a parable for cinematic ambition." [...] He emphatically added, [...] "The surface of this movie is plenty enthralling on its own." [...] Desson Thomson of The Washington Post commented that for the film, [...] "The voyage works, beautifully. While we don't get the ticklish conceit of Scottish profanities in the celestial outer realm, we do get something surprisingly consoling: a deep sense of the humanity that we always carry with us, no matter how far we venture from home." ...|$|E

2500|$|On D-Day, June 6, 1944, Schroeder was a 25-year-old {{captain in}} command of the 219men of Company F of the 2nd Battalion, 8th Infantry Regiment, 4th Infantry Division. The 8th Infantry Regiment was ordered to make the initial D-Day landing on Utah Beach as part of the invasion. [...] As they sailed to France from England on the night of June5 aboard the navy's USS Barnett on the rough English channel, they heard Supreme Allied Commander General Dwight D. Eisenhower's exhortation to the troops over the radio, [...] "Together, we shall achieve victory". Afterwards, the company commanders were summoned by the 2nd Battalion commander, Lieutenant Colonel Carlton MacNeely, to Brigadier General Theodore Roosevelt, Jr.'s {{quarters}} for a final briefing before the invasion. When the meeting ended near midnight, Schroeder later recounted, the officers [...] "wished each other well and shook hands", and MacNeely put his arm around Schroeder's shoulders. Addressing the young captain by his nickname, [...] "Moose", MacNeely said, [...] "Well, Moose, this is it. Give 'em hell!" [...] Schroeder said they both [...] "choked up" [...] and he replied, [...] "Well, colonel, I'll see you on the beach!" [...] Roosevelt said, [...] "Moose, take me in <b>your</b> <b>boat</b> when you go ashore". At 2:30a.m. on June 6, Schroeder's company left the Barnett to board their LCVP landing craft. Before departing the Barnett to face the enemy, Schroeder wrote a letter to his wife: [...] "I told her where I was, what I was about to do, and how much I loved her".|$|E
