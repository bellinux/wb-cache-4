In {{his career}} as a student leader, MKwananzi was {{expelled}} from the University of Zimbabwe. He was also arrested numerous times for leading students protests against the government's unjust education policies. He was recently elected into the MDC youth assembly as secretary general and appointed {{a member of the national}} executive committee as secretary for youth affairs, making him the youngest national executive member in the party's history at 28. A close ally of Morgan Tsvangirai, Mkwananzi did his education at the Utrecht University in Netherlands where he attained a bachelor's degree in political science and international relations. He also attained a masters in international development studies. He is seen as one of the key emerging leaders of the party, challenging the autonomy that was solely enjoyed by Nelson Chamisa who is celebrated as the only former student leader to lead the party. Mkwananzi is viewed by many as a radical intellectual who sides with the poor especially peasant, workers and the youth. He is highly tipped to be appointed into a cabinet position if the MDC comes into power because of his education credentials. Mkwananzi is also a fierce advocate of <b>youth</b> <b>autonomy,</b> arguing that the youth should be at the forefront of both the revolution and decision making. He is widely known for his eye for an eye call in which he called upon the youth to retaliate violence from ZANU PF youths. Mkwananzi lives in Harare, Zimbabwe.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background To {{increase}} {{understanding of}} the healthcare transition (HCT) process for young people living with Juvenile Idopathic Arthritis (JIA) by examining: 1) {{the extent to which}} youth report discussing HCT topics with their rheumatologist and 2) the association between youth perceptions of autonomy support from their rheumatologist and HCT discussions. Methods Data are from an online survey of youth in the United States with rheumatologic conditions (n= 134). HCT discussion was measured by 4 questions from the National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs. Youth perception of autonomy support was measured using a validated 6 -item scale. Results One third of the youth (33. 7 %) reported talking to their rheumatologist about transferring to adult medicine. Less than half (40. 8 %) of respondents talked with their rheumatologist about adult healthcare needs, and less than a quarter (22. 0 %) discussed acquiring health insurance as an adult. Nearly two-thirds of respondents (62. 7 %) reported that their rheumatologist usually/always encourages self-care responsibility. Multivariate analyses revealed significant associations between rheumatologist support for <b>youth</b> <b>autonomy</b> and HCT counseling. Conclusion The low frequency of HCT counseling reported indicates a continuing need to increase awareness among rheumatologist in the USA. The strong associations between rheumatologist’s support for <b>youth</b> <b>autonomy</b> and HCT counseling suggest that developmentally “in-tune” providers may deliver the best guidance about transition planning for youth living with arthritis. </p...|$|E

40|$|In mid- 1984 a newly-elected {{government}} in New Zealand tackled severe economic crises by abruptly adopting neo-liberal economic policies to curtail government activities and shrink the national debt. Retrenchment {{continued into the}} mid- 1990 s. New Zealand 2 ̆ 7 s experiment, which attracted wide international attention, originated from an unexpected quarter. A Labor government moved the country from its status as the most regulated OECD economy to the least controlled. The sudden adoption of radical steps remain controversial, criticized as a "blitzkrieg" of liberalization that brought no swift improvements, or defended as an incomplete revolution that ended the circumstances {{of a growing number}} of poor exactly when national productively was falling. One indicator of social havoc is the male suicide rate. It rose for young adults, suggesting a connection between restructuring, youth pessimism, and suicide. With many jurisdictions around the world currently embarking on austerity measures, the social consequences of the New Zealand experiment warrant exposure. A straightforward argument blaming economic restructuring for the rising young male suicide rate is unachievable, because the restructuring occurred when the sexual revolution and <b>youth</b> <b>autonomy</b> were working their way through New Zealand 2 ̆ 7 s domestic culture, when cannabis use was increasing, when young offenders were prominent in remand centers and prisons, and when mental health services were in upheaval.

Thirty-five mother-adolescent dyads participated to a task in which they discussed a family issue about which they disagree. Adolescents were also administered a self-report measure assessing their relationship with mothers. Mothers reported significantly higher levels of promoting and inhibiting autonomy, and promoting relatedness behaviors than their children. Results also suggested a partial behavioral reciprocity within the dyads, regarding promoting and inhibiting relatedness, and inhibiting autonomy. Finally, mothers’ inhibiting autonomy behaviors positively correlated to teens’ perception of their relationship as conflicting; adolescents’ inhibiting and promoting autonomy and inhibiting relatedness behaviors positively correlated to open confrontation, rejection and coolness, while promoting relatedness behaviors negatively correlated to open confrontation, rejection and coolness. The results suggest that, for Italian mothers, behaviors linked to autonomy seem to be associated with being involved in a more negative relationship with their children, even if not characterized by open hostility, while for Italian adolescents, behaviors linked to autonomy seem to be associated with threatening the closeness of the relationship. Globally, the findings suggest that the application of this observational procedure may help our understanding of <b>youth</b> <b>autonomy</b> and relatedness development in Italy, but they leave unanswered questions regarding its appropriate adaptation and the role played by cultural differences...|$|E
40|$|This study {{contributes}} to both educational practice and theory through examining the mathematics used by urban youth in an after-school robotics {{program and the}} environment in which that activity occurred. The work has several audiences, including mathematics education practitioners, mathematics education researchers, out-of-schooltime educational practitioners, and learning theorists. The research builds on our knowledge of how youth use mathematics outside of the classroom as well as how various sociocultural learning theories can be used to understand the affordances and constraints of an afterschool STEM development program located, like most of these programs, between what are considered formal and informal learning environments. This project is a continuation of a larger three-year participant-observation study across three sites. This qualitative study included participant observation with youth through a cycle of the program. Observational data was triangulated with experience interviews and clinical task-based interviews, the latter being designed to investigate the participants‘ use of mathematics in more depth. The mathematics use of the youth matched much of the previous research on how people use mathematics outside of school time, with some notable differences. Specifically, in the robotics program the youth drew on a varied set of mathematics learned and used in school, out of school, and during robotics. Youth drawing on mathematics from across different spaces contrasts with the research literature, which has shown that people tend to silo mathematics use. I argue that the setting, made up of a combination of in-school and out-of-school structures and supports, helped to facilitate this phenomenon, as did the program that had been designed to support <b>youth</b> <b>autonomy</b> in design, building, and problem-solving decisions. Two new ideas are presented: semiformal learning environment to capture a setting that shares features of formal and informal contexts and the math use framework to conceptualize the different mathematics resources people bring to a given setting. ...|$|E

40|$|When youth create {{positive}} {{environmental change}} in their communities they typically act with adult guidance. The role of adults, however, is largely absent in literature around youth participation in environmental action. This research explored through phenomenological interviews with 33 practitioners (e. g., teachers, extension educators, community organizers) facilitating youth environmental action in formal and non-formal educational settings across the U. S. : (a) ways practitioners involved youth in environmental action, (b) purposes and goals motivating practitioners to engage youth in environmental action, and (c) methods practitioners used to facilitate youth environmental action. The study sought insight into successful and challenging experiences. It also inquired {{about the meaning of}} these experiences for participating youth through group interviews with 46 youth in 9 programs. Practice accounts included multiple forms of action among five types: physical improvements, community education, inquiry, advocacy, and contributions to community development. Practitioners described purposes integrating multiple individual, environmental, and community development goals. Most placed higher value in developing youth as citizens and change agents than in promoting environmental improvements. Evident in practitioners' narratives was a tension between encouraging <b>youth</b> <b>autonomy</b> while maintaining authority. Practitioners experienced and managed this 'autonomy-authority duality' differently but all described characteristics of youth-adult partnerships. Nine practice themes emerged: creating safe spaces; providing structure; building relationships; bridging differences; setting rigorous expectations; providing opportunities for meaningful contribution; supporting youth; expanding horizons; and connecting youth with community. Youth reported learning in physical (e. g., fitness), intellectual (e. g., technological skills), psychological (e. g., initiative), and social (e. g., teamwork) domains. Parallel themes with youth development literature suggest environmental action is a valuable context for positive youth development. The interplay of science education and community action evident in practitioner and youth interviews suggests the merit of a theoretical framework where environmental action occurs at the intersection of inquiry-based science education and youth civic engagement. Participation in environmental action enhanced some youths' capabilities in 'practical inquiry' and influenced some youths' perceptions of themselves from passive to active citizens. Environmental action concurrently involves youth in civic and scientific processes through which they can develop the critical dispositions and skills characteristic of both endeavors.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is twofold. First, it is aimed at {{describing}} {{the way in which}} the church, the family and the school are functioning as forming institutions for the identity development of Christian youth at the beginning of the 21 st century. Second, it is aimed at defining a research framework for further analysis of religious identity formation in a modern context. Four research questions are central. 1. How may religious identity development of Christian youth in the modern context of The Netherlands at the beginning of the 21 st century be described? The explorations of youth are strongly influenced by an ever changing supply of the market and commerce; this is also true for the “religious market” and the great amount of supply of stuff on spirituality and sense making. Youth seems to make either none or many ever changing and successive commitments with respect to religious beliefs and worldviews. In other words: there seems to be an increasing process of fragmentised identity development. 2. How may the functioning of the institutions of the church, the family, and the school with regard to religious formation in a modern context of The Netherlands at the beginning of the 21 st century be described? With respect to supporting religious identity development, there seems to be a decrease of acting conform the model of `transmission of belief content`. Much more accent is laid on facilitating the making of individual choices by youth themselves and linking to the life styles of youth. These life styles are more strongly connected to the life world of youth themselves. The school, the family, and the church function loosely in relation to each other, each searching for connection with the life world of Christian youth. 3. In what manners are the institutions of the church, the family and the school probing the formation of religious identities of Christian youth in The Netherlands at the beginning of the 21 st century? At the core of how nowadays identity development is probed is the experienced tension between the ideal of transmission, e. g. by a coherent functioning of the triangle of church, family, and school, on the one hand, and the principle of <b>youth</b> <b>autonomy</b> leading to individual construction of religious identities highly disconnected from the institutions around them, at the other. There is also the feeling that Christian youth is struggling with a lack of sense making and security; a situation on which the institutions should have adequate answers. 4. Which framework is provided by the answers to the research questions 1 - 3, with may be used for a research program on the theme of religious identity formation in a modern context? The thesis presents a research framework with three basic research questions: 1. 	Does Christian youth identify itself with one or more dimensions of religion, and if yes, in what manner(s) ? 2. 	Does Christian youth identify itself with a religious community by functional identification, and if yes, in what manner(s) ? 3.

40|$|This latest {{volume in}} the World Yearbook of Education Series focuses on {{educational}} elites and inequality, focusing {{particularly on the}} ways in which established and emergent groups located {{at the top of the}} social hierarchy and power structure reproduce, establish or redefine their position. The volume is organized around three main issues: - analyzing the way in which parents, students and graduates in positions of social advantage use their assets and capitals in relation to educational strategies, and how these are different for old and new and cultural and economic elites; - studying how elite institutions have adapted their strategies to take into account changes in the social structure, in policy and in their institutional environment and exploring the impact of these strategies on educational systems at the national and global levels; - mapping the new global dynamics in elite education and how new forms of 'international education' and 'transnational cultural capital' as well as new global educational elite pathways shape elite students’ identities, status and trajectories. Making use of a social and an institutional approach as well as a focus on practices and policies, the volume draws on research conducted on secondary schools and on higher education. In addition, the global contributions within the book allow for a comparison and contrast of situations in different countries. This results in a comprehensive picture of common processes and national differences concerning advantage and excellence and a thorough examination of the impact of globalization on the strategies, identities and trajectories of elite groups and individuals alongside more general cultural and economic processes.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{extend the}} {{findings}} of the first Development and Assessment of Nicotine Dependence in Youth study by using diagnostic criteria for tobacco dependence and a biochemical measure of nicotine intake. The first study found that symptoms of dependence commonly appeared soon after the onset of intermittent smoking. DESIGN: A 4 -year prospective study. SETTING: Public schools in 6 Massachusetts communities. PARTICIPANTS: A cohort of 1246 sixth-grade students. INTERVENTIONS: Eleven interviews. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Loss of autonomy over tobacco as measured by the Hooked on Nicotine Checklist, and tobacco dependence as defined in International Classification of Diseases, 10 th Revision (ICD- 10). RESULTS: Among the 217 inhalers, 127 lost autonomy over their tobacco use, 10 % having done so within 2 days and 25 % having done so within 30 days of first inhaling from a cigarette; half had lost autonomy {{by the time they were}} smoking 7 cigarettes per month. Among the 83 inhalers who developed ICD- 10 -defined dependence, half had done so by the time they were smoking 46 cigarettes per month. At the interview following the onset of ICD- 10 -defined dependence, the median salivary cotinine concentration of current smokers was 5. 35 ng/mL, a level that falls well below the cutoff used to distinguish active from passive smokers. CONCLUSIONS: The most susceptible <b>youths</b> lose <b>autonomy</b> over tobacco within a day or 2 of first inhaling from a cigarette. The appearance of tobacco withdrawal symptoms and failed attempts at cessation can precede daily smoking; ICD- 10 -defined dependence can precede daily smoking and typically appears before consumption reaches 2 cigarettes per day...|$|R
40|$|In this {{ground-breaking}} book, Jenny Slater {{uses the}} lens of 'the reasonable' to explore how normative understandings of youth, dis/ability and the intersecting identities of gender and sexuality impact upon the lives of young dis/abled people. Although youth and disability have separately been thought within socio-cultural frameworks, rarely have sociological studies of 'youth' and 'disability' been brought together. By taking an interdisciplinary, critical disability studies approach to explore the socio-cultural concepts of 'youth' and 'disability' alongside one-another, Slater convincingly demonstrates that 'youth' and 'disability' have been conceptualised within medical/psychological frameworks for too long. With chapters focusing on access and <b>youth</b> culture, independence, <b>autonomy</b> and disabled people's movements, and the body, gender and sexuality, this volume's intersectional and transdisciplinary engagement with social theory offers {{a significant contribution to}} existing theoretical and empirical literature and knowledges around disability and youth. Indeed, through highlighting the ableism of adulthood and the falsity of conceptualising youth as a time of becoming-independent-adult, the need to shift approaches to research around dis/abled youth {{is one of the main}} themes of the book. This book therefore is a provocation to rethink what is implicit about 'youth' and 'disability'. Moreover, through such an endeavour, this book sits as a challenge to Mr Reasonable. © 2015 Jenny Slater...|$|R
40|$|Positive youth {{development}} (PYD) programs offer enriching experiences that help young people discover and develop skills {{that will help}} them become productive, successful, and healthy adults (Damon, 2004; Lerner, von Eye, Lerner, 2 ̆ 6 Lewin-Bizan, 2009). The social context within PYD programs serves as a mechanism in this process and program staff are often responsible for creating a social environment where youth feel safe and supported while participating in activities designed to foster growth (Benson, Scales, Hamilton, 2 ̆ 6 Sesma, 2007; Larson, 2006). Basic psychological needs theory conceptualizes that staff-youth interactions will lead to well-being in youth to the degree that they provide autonomy support, involvement, and structure (Deci 2 ̆ 6 Ryan, 1991). The purpose of this dissertation was to examine social relationships between staff and youth in a physical activity-based PYD program through a randomized controlled trial of a theory-based staff training, youth perceptions of staff and well-being, and staff perceptions on how they build relationships that foster well-being in youth and on the training they received. ^ Study 1 used an experimental design to test if a new theory-based staff training can increase (1) staff use of autonomy support, involvement, and structure; (2) youth perceptions of staff autonomy support, involvement, and structure; and (3) youth well-being (psychological need satisfaction, self-worth, and hope). Participants were staff (N = 24) and youth (N = 379) recruited from a four-week, summer physical activity-based PYD program. Staff participated in a randomized controlled trial of a new staff training based in basic psychological needs theory (Deci 2 ̆ 6 Ryan, 1991) where staff in the intervention condition were trained to interact with <b>youth</b> using <b>autonomy</b> support, involvement, and structure. Staff-youth interactions were observed by researchers, and youth completed pre- and post-program surveys that assessed their perceptions of autonomy support, involvement, structure, and well-being. Staff who completed the new training engaged <b>youth</b> using greater <b>autonomy</b> support and structure. Youth perceptions of staff behavior positively predicted well-being, but perceptions of staff behaviors and well-being were not dependent on condition assignment. Findings from Study 1 include that staff interpersonal behaviors can be improved through training, and staff-youth relationships characterized by autonomy support, involvement, and structure can enhance well-being in youth. ^ Study 2 qualitatively examined how staff establish social relationships that foster well-being in youth, and elicited the feedback on the training received in Study 1 from the perspective of staff. Ten staff members (7 women, 3 men; age = 16 – 23 years) from the physical activity-based PYD program were interviewed. Staff communicated that they developed close social connections with youth through shared program experiences, one-on-one conversations, and serving as parent-, friend-, and sibling-figures. Staff also built positive relationships by helping youth process challenges and by exemplifying friendship. Staff assigned to the intervention condition in Study 1 shared that their training provided useful strategies to build relationships with youth and helped them identify how program activities could enhance well-being in youth. Staff encountered barriers that inhibited their ability to build relationships with youth, including a large staff-to-youth ratio and limited time in the schedule for informal conversations. To foster well-being in youth, staff connected program activities to life experiences, role modeled healthy behaviors, and took extra time to engage youth who seemed most resistant to their efforts. Findings from Study 2 highlight the perspective of staff experiences in PYD programs, and provide strategies staff can use to build relationships with youth and feedback on how to help staff build positive relationships with youth through training. Study 1 and Study 2 examine how staff-youth social relationships foster well-being in youth through a randomized control trial of a theory-based staff training, observation of staff behaviors, and the perceptions of social relationships from youth and staff using basic psychological needs theory. ...|$|R

The specific aims were to examine treatment specificity and mediation effects of parenting variables. ICBT {{was used as a}} baseline comparison condition. The sample consisted of 253 youth (ages 5 - 16 years; M = 9. 38; SD = 2. 42) and their parents. To examine treatment outcome and specificity, the data were analyzed using analysis of variance within a structural equation modeling framework. Mediation was analyzed via structural equation modeling using MPlus. Results indicated that ICBT, RLST, and RFST produced positive treatment outcomes across all indices of change (i. e., clinically significant improvement, anxiety symptom reduction) and across all informants (i. e., youths and parents). RLST was associated with incremental reduction in youth anxiety symptoms beyond ICBT, as per youth report. Treatment specificity effects were found for participants in RFST in terms of parental reinforcement, as per parent report only. Treatment mediation was not found for any of the hypothesized parenting variables (i. e., parental acceptance, parental autonomy granting, parental reinforcement). The results support the use of CBT involving only the youth and the parent and youth together for treating youth anxiety. The findings’ implications are further discussed in terms of the need to conduct further meditational treatment outcome designs in order to continue to advance theory and research in youth anxiety treatment...|$|R

The main objective of the proposal is to introduce robot development processes to secondary students in Boise. For this, we are researching {{the development of a}} Lego-based robotic curriculum, which is easy and inspiring. The short-term and long term benefits from the successful curriculum development will be the revitalization of interest in science, technology, engineering and math among secondary students in Boise. For the robotic curriculum development, we have designed and implemented several Lego Mindstorm NXT robots. These robots are (1) fun to build, (2) easy to program to operate autonomously, and (3) rewarding to compete as group activities. In particular, to highlight the programming aspect of the robot development, we replaced the original firmware on an NXT brick with the LeJOS firmware. This will enable the secondary students to program robots in JAVA, which is a dominant modern high-level programming language used in academia and industry. To partially demonstrate our past efforts to develop an easy and inspiring robot curriculum for the secondary students in Boise, we will present the following intelligent robots during the undergraduate research conference: Line-following robot: The robot is programmed to follow a black line on a light surface. A light sensor on the robot determines if the robot is still on the line. If not, it performs a sequence of pivots and movements to search for a line until it finds it and continues. Modifications were made to LeJOS sample code {{in order to make the}} robot more responsive to corners and other anomalies in its path. We will demonstrate our improved algorithm by using robots programmed with the old and new code. Rover: This robot has sensors that allow it to collect environmental data, not unlike the Mars rover. It is able to detect obstacles in its path and respond to them by maneuvering out of the way. The above robot design and implementation experience will enable us to develop an easy and inspiring robot curriculum for secondary students in Boise. We are planning to use our robot design and implementation for the e-DAY and e-CAMP in the summer of 2010 to measure the effectiveness of Lego-based robot activities. To this end, this project will establish an inspiring robot curriculum to stimulate youths to major in STEM as they enter post-secondary education...|$|R
