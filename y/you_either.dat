In October 2004, exclusive footage from the film was screened to the trade experts and critics, creating a positive buzz. The film's trailers and the film's music aided its marketing.|$|E
500|$|Gilbert {{was mostly}} {{collaborative}} with Dahl's work, as the writer declared: [...] "He not only helped in script conferences, but {{had some good}} ideas and then left you alone, and when you produced the finished thing, he shot it. Other directors have such an ego {{that they want to}} rewrite it and put their own dialogue in, and it's usually disastrous. What I admired so much about Lewis Gilbert was that he just took the screenplay and shot it. That's the way to direct: <b>You</b> <b>either</b> trust your writer or you don't." ...|$|E

500|$|Taylor {{developed}} {{what has}} been termed a [...] "love-hate relationship" [...] with Bill Parcells who was the team's defensive coordinator when he was drafted, and would later become their head coach. Parcells often rode players {{in the hopes of}} driving them to better performance. Taylor did not appreciate this approach, and early on told Parcells, [...] "I've had enough. <b>You</b> <b>either</b> cut me or trade me but get the fuck off my back." [...] Parcells kept on Taylor, but privately told some veterans, [...] "I like that LT. That motherfucker's got a mean streak." ...|$|E
500|$|He {{was exposed}} to {{traditional}} flamenco music as a child while vacationing each summer in his parents' native Andalusia in southern Spain. Originally, Sanz intended to become a flamenco performer, but he found the music teachers to be overly strict. Commenting on his early experiences, Sanz explained, [...] "Flamenco can be very hard on beginners. If you lose the rhythm, they toss you out with, 'You're no good, boy!' They're very strict and very cruel. But it's also a marvelous education, because <b>you</b> <b>either</b> learn to play or else." [...] He felt {{that he could not}} compete with his peers, and decided to focus on creating pop music with flamenco influences, viewing flamenco to be a [...] "lifestyle" [...] better suited to others.|$|E

In his next start, Zito struggled. He went six innings but allowed eight earned runs against the Los Angeles Dodgers. Zito would earn his first win {{as a member of the}} Giants in his next start on April 16 when he went six innings, gave up three hits, and allowed no runs to the Colorado Rockies. [...] "I've been trying to have a good game", Zito said. [...] "You can't try to do anything. <b>You</b> <b>either</b> do or you don't. I tried to get too fine with my pitches.

500|$|According to Mustaine, {{the band}} was under {{pressure}} to deliver another successful album: [...] "That sophomore offering is the 'be-all or end-all' of any band. <b>You</b> <b>either</b> {{go to the next}} level, or it's the beginning of the nadir." [...] The songs were developed relatively quickly in an old warehouse south of Los Angeles before recording began. Mustaine composed the music, with the other members adding arrangement ideas. Megadeth's second album was produced on a $25,000 budget from Combat Records. Dissatisfied with its financial limitations, the band left Combat and signed with Capitol Records. Capitol bought the rights to the upcoming album, and hired producer Paul Lani to remix the earlier recordings. Released in late 1986, Peace Sells... but Who's Buying? has clearer production and more sophisticated songwriting. Mustaine wanted to write socially conscious lyrics, unlike mainstream heavy metal bands who sang about [...] "hedonistic pleasures". The album was noted for its political commentary and helped Megadeth expand its fanbase. The title track was the album's lead single and was accompanied by a music video that received regular airplay on MTV.|$|E
500|$|Al-Muhajiroun {{attempted}} a relaunch in June 2009 at Conway Hall, in Holborn. [...] Several speakers {{were invited to}} share a platform with Choudary, but some later claimed {{that they had been}} invited under false pretences. [...] When the group refused to allow women into the meeting, the chairman of the society which runs the hall cancelled the event. [...] He was heckled by many of those in the audience. [...] Choudary took the microphone from the chairman and led chants of [...] "sharia for UK", saying in reference to the exclusion of women: [...] "Jews and Christians will never make peace with you until <b>you</b> <b>either</b> become like them or adopt their ways." [...] Outside the hall, Choudary criticised British society, and predicted that Muslims would make up the majority within one or two decades. [...] When asked why, if society was so bad, he lived here, he replied: [...] "We come here to civilise people, get them {{to come out of the}} darkness and injustice into the beauty of Islam." ...|$|E
500|$|In March 2009, Morrissey {{appeared}} as corrupt police detective Maurice Jobson in Red Riding, the Channel 4 adaptation of David Peace's Red Riding novels. Morrissey {{already knew the}} directors of the films, enjoyed reading the script and had either worked with his co-stars on other projects, or wanted to work with them. He liked the flaws in the Jobson character and that he differs from typical vigilante police officers portrayed on television. Morrissey said of Jobson, [...] "I think he sets out to be a good cop, he tries to do his job well but he gets involved in some corruption and realises that being a 'bit' corrupt is like being a 'bit' pregnant. <b>You</b> <b>either</b> are or you're not." [...] He received a Best Actor nomination from the Broadcasting Press Guild for the role. At the end of the year, Morrissey played Bobby Dykins in the John Lennon biopic Nowhere Boy (2009). As a self-confessed [...] "Beatles geek", Morrissey relished the opportunity to star in the film about Lennon's childhood.|$|E

500|$|Deadpool {{held its}} world premiere at the Grand Rex in Paris on February 8, 2016, before {{beginning}} its release in Hong Kong the next day. This {{was followed by}} 49 other markets {{over the next few}} days, including North America on February 12. It was released in several formats, including IMAX, DLP, premium large formats and D-Box. Kinberg explained that unlike the previous X-Men films, Deadpool is [...] "a hard R. It’s graphic. Nothing is taboo. <b>You</b> <b>either</b> commit to a truly outrageous boundary-pushing kind of movie or you don’t." [...] The film was denied a China release due to this, and though R-rated American films are often [...] "cleaned-up" [...] for release in the country, it was decided that [...] "it wasn't possible to excise the offending material without causing plot problems." [...] It was also not released in Uzbekistan, after the theater owners in the country decided against showing the film because [...] "it has an age restriction and is not in line with ethical norms in our society." [...] Deadpool received seven [...] "general cuts" [...] to get approval for release in India.|$|E
500|$|Far Side Virtual topped The Wires top 50 {{releases}} of 2011—a choice {{that proved to}} be polarizing among readers. Writing to elucidate the [...] "low mandate" [...] for the album, editor-in-chief Tony Herrington noted that only seven of 60 voters included Far Side Virtual on their lists, and no voters chose it as their personal favorite. Herrington said the choice was [...] "entirely appropriate in a year in which the abundance of choice brought on by digital technology reached such a tipping point as to make genuine consensus impossible. ... <b>you</b> <b>either</b> swoon over the conceptual audacity of its deadpan appropriation of late capitalist-era corporate mood Muzak, or you think it's the worst record Dave Grusin never made." [...] Tiny Mix Tapes' Dean wrote that after Far Side Virtual topped The Wires list, [...] "discerning music nerds have felt the imperative to step to either side of a line," [...] and that Herrington's column [...] "amounted to a retraction." [...] While praising the magazine for its diverse taste, Seattle Weeklys Eric Grandy jokingly commented that it was [...] "no surprise" [...] that the [...] "willfully obscurantist" [...] magazine would top their list with a [...] "winking Windows '97 soft-rock hellscape".|$|E
500|$|Actress and dancer Zoë Lister {{was cast}} {{in the role of}} Zoe. On 8 June 2009, media {{entertainment}} website Digital Spy revealed that Lister had quit the soap and would leave {{towards the end of the}} year. Speaking of her decision to quit, Lister stated: [...] "It's scary but also very, very exciting. I think three years in a soap is enough to do and you get to a point where <b>you</b> <b>either</b> make a decision that this is what you do or you want to try something different." [...] She also revealed that she had been planning to leave the series one year prior to announcement. Lister's decision to quit matched that of co-star Loui Batley (Sarah Barnes). Hollyoaks officially announced on 23 July 2009 that both Lister and Batley would leave towards the end of the year in a storyline that would see [...] "A tragic curtain call for one of them", later revealing that either Sarah or Zoe would be killed off in a dramatic storyline. Lister also revealed in an interview with Heat magazine that she was [...] "nervous", but [...] "very excited" [...] about leaving the show.|$|E

500|$|Robert L. Surtees, who {{had already}} filmed several of the most {{successful}} epics of the 1950s, was hired as cinematographer for the film. Early on in the film's production, Zimbalist and other MGM executives made the decision to film the picture in a widescreen format. Wyler strongly disliked the widescreen format, commenting that [...] "Nothing is out of the picture, and you can't fill it. <b>You</b> <b>either</b> have a lot of empty space, or you have two people talking and a flock of others surrounding them who {{have nothing to do with}} the scene. Your eye just wanders out of curiosity." [...] The cameras were also quite large, heavy, and difficult and time-consuming to move. To overcome these difficulties, Surtees and Wyler collaborated on using the widescreen lenses, film stocks, and projection technologies to create highly detailed images for the film. Wyler was best known for composition in depth, a visual technique in which people, props, and architecture are not merely composed horizontally but in depth of field as well. He also had a strong preference for long takes, during which his actors could move within this highly detailed space.|$|E
500|$|The album {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 73, based on 21 reviews, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews". Dan Martin of NME gave the record {{a very positive}} review, calling a [...] "defining statement" [...] with the band's [...] "most stylistically hatstand-but-indisputably-best songs yet." [...] He wrote, [...] "We're not saying it's as good as genre watermarks American Idiot or The Black Parade. We're just saying it comes close," [...] closing with calling it a [...] "staggering achievement." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic rated the album {{four out of five}} stars and compared it to labelmate Panic! at the Disco's effort earlier in the year, Pretty. Odd. He wrote that [...] "Fall Out Boy capture the Zeitgeist of {{the latter half of the}} 2000s better than any band: there's so much going on in Folie à Deux, <b>you</b> <b>either</b> choose to take it all seriously or take none of it. Fall Out Boy make as much sense when heard either way." [...] Scott Heisel wrote for Alternative Press, commending the band for its [...] "creativity, ingenuity and willingness to try just about anything." [...] He compared the meaning of the term folie à deux ("a madness shared by two") to the two very distinct feelings expressed in the different sides of the record, calling the album a good representation of the band's career.|$|E
