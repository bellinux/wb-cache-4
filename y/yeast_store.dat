In 1883 Emile Hansen completed a study on pure yeast culture isolation and the pure strain obtained from Spaten went into industrial production in 1884 as Carlsberg yeast No 1. Another specialized pure yeast production plant was soon installed at the Heineken Brewery in Rotterdam the following year and together they began the supply of pure cultured yeast to brewers across Europe.

On the basis of yeast cell analysis it can be concluded that yeast is a complex biological system which changes in time. The intensity of the changes depends on temperature. <b>Yeast</b> sample was <b>stored</b> at 4 °C i 24 °C for 12 days. During storage at 4 °C, the content of total carbohydrates decreased from 48. 81 % to 37. 50 % (dry matter), whereas carbohydrate loss ranged from 40. 81 % to 29. 28 % at 24 °C. The content of trehalose was 12. 33 % in the <b>yeast</b> sample <b>stored</b> at 4 °C and 0. 24 % at 24 °C. Loss of fermentative activity was 81. 76 % in the sample stored at 24 °C for 12 days. The composition of five samples of 1 st category flour was investigated. It was found that flours containing more reducing sugars and maltose enable higher fermentation activities. The flours with higher ash content (in the range 0. 5 — 0. 94 %) had higher contents of phytic acid. Higher ash and phytic contents in flour increased the yeast fermentative efficiency. In bakery industry, a range of ingredients has been applied to improve the pro-duct's quality such as surface active substances (emulsifiers), enzymes, sugars and fats. In the paper, the effect of some ingredients added to dough (margarine, saccharose, sodium chloride and malted barley) on the yeast fermentative activity was studied.

Between successive fermentations cropped <b>yeast</b> is <b>stored</b> as a slurry in cooled storage vessels under anaerobic conditions until required for subsequent use. Maintenance of yeast quality during storage is critical for subsequent fermentation performance. An assumption is made in brewing that all strains benefit from storage at 3 - 4 °C. To test this assumption a model working system was initially established to assess cooling times of lager yeast in different suspension media. Preliminary investigations focussing on freshly propagated yeast slurry demonstrated that whilst the deleterious effects of extremely high storage temperatures on lager brewing yeast physiology was in line with expectation, utilization of traditionally recommended storage temperatures does not necessarily benefit yeast physiology when compared to slurry maintenance at slightly higher temperatures. Genome-scale transcriptional analysis in slurries cropped following an initial fermentation suggested that lager yeast might experience cold stress during slurry maintenance at typically recommended storage temperatures. In contrast, maintenance of lager yeast at a slightly higher storage temperature, in this case 10 °C, yielded no adverse impact on key indicators of brewing yeast physiological state or on subsequent fermentation profiles following repitching into fermentations. Whilst these observations were not made using full production scale, they do indicate that optimal storage may not be currently being deployed for brewing yeast at full scale...|$|R

Batch fermentation experiments conducted in a gradientless reaction system allowed comparison of immobilized cell and suspended cell performance. In complete nutrient medium, the specific rate of ethanol production by the immobilized cells was 40 - 50 % greater than for the suspended yeast. The immobilized cell consumed glucose twice as fast as the suspended cells, but their specific growth rate was reduced by 45 %. Yields of biomass from the immobilized cell population were lower at one-third the value for the suspended cells. Cellular composition was also affected by immobilization. Measurements of intracellular polysaccharide levels showed that the immobilized <b>yeast</b> <b>stored</b> larger quantities of reserve carbohydrates and contained more structural polysaccharide than suspended cells. Flow cytometry was used to obtain DNA, RNA and protein frequency functions for suspended and immobilized cell populations. These data showed that the immobilized cells have higher ploidy than cells in suspension. The level of stable, double-stranded RNA in immobilized cells was only one-quarter that measured for suspended cells. The observed changes in immobilized cell metabolism and composition may have arisen from disturbance to the yeast cell cycle by cell attachment, causing alterations in the normal patterns of yeast bud development, DNA replication and synthesis of cell wall components. Recovery from hydroxyurea-induced DNA synthesis inhibition was indicated by measurements of growth rate, DNA content and light scatter properties. The immobilized cells quickly developed an effective means for overcoming hydroxyurea-induced inhibition of replication, and proceeded to synthesize largeamounts of DNA while still {{in the presence of the}} inhibitor. Stable RNA levels for immobilized cells remained low at 25 % of the measured quantity for hydroxyureatreated suspended cells. Synthesis of protein and RNA was not adversely affected in either cell type. Suspended cell protein pools increased by a factor of 1. 8 following inhibition, while the immobilized cells contained 2. 6 times the level of protein before hydroxyurea treatment. Fermentation properties of immobilized and suspended cells were changed by hydroxyurea. The specific rate of ethanol production by immobilized cells increased by an average of 24 %, while, for the suspended cells, specific productivity was up to three times higher. Glucose consumption rates for both cell types also increased under the influence of hydroxyurea. Suspended cell polysaccharide content was reduced by 65 %, while the immobilized cells, in contrast, contained 30 % more polysaccharide after hydroxyurea treatment. Biotin starvation of immobilized yeast was effective in reducing synthesis of DNA. Biotin-deficient immobilized S. cerevisiae contained approximately the same quantity of DNA as starved suspended cells, while RNA and protein levels were reduced. Glycerol was synthesized at the expense of ethanol during fermentation by biotin-deficient immobilized and suspended cells. The character and occurrence of glycolytic oscillations were affected by immobilization. Endogenous metabolism by immobilized cells gave rise to relaxation oscillations in the absence of external substrate. Addition of glucose to starved immobilized yeast also generated relaxation-type behaviour, while suspended cells produced only sinusoidal waveforms.

In this talk, two upcoming bio nanosatellites developed at Ames, the E. coli Antimicrobial Satellite (EcAMSat) and BioSentinel, will be discussed. Both satellites contain microfluidic systems that precisely deliver nutrients to the microorganisms stored within wells of fluidic cards. Each well, in turn, has its own 3 -color LED and detector system which is used to monitor changes in metabolic activity with alamarBlue, a redox indicator, and the optical density of the cells. EcAMSat investigates the effects of microgravity on bacterial resistance to antimicrobial drugs, vital knowledge for understanding how to maintain the health of astronauts in long-term and beyond LEO spaceflight. The behavior of wild type and mutant uropathic E. coli will be compared in microgravity and with ground data to help understand the molecular mechanisms behind antibiotic resistance and how these phenotypes might change in space. BioSentinel seeks to directly measure the effects of space radiation on budding yeast S. cerevisiae, particularly double strand breaks (DSB). While hitching a ride on the SLS EM- 1 mission (Orion's first unmanned mission to the moon) in 2018, BioSentinel will be kicked off and enter into a heliocentric orbit, becoming the first study of the effects of radiation on living organisms outside LEO since the Apollo program. The <b>yeast</b> are <b>stored</b> in eighteen independent 16 -well microfluidic cards, which will be individually activated over the 12 month mission duration. In addition to the wild type and radiation-sensitive mutant strains, a BioSentinel strain of yeast has been developed, which requires a DSB to reactivate growth, thereby allowing for a direct measurement of DSBs caused by radiation. These two missions demonstrate the utility of using autonomous nanosatellites to address strategic knowledge gaps in the push to once again extend manned spaceflight beyond LEO...|$|R
40|$|In a {{summation}} {{of the experimental}} work presented herein, the following points are believed significant: (1) The fermentation of dextrose by maceration extract of yeast is stimulated by ammonium chloride and magnesium sulfate. (2) The activity of zymin preparations will vary greatly depending upon {{the source of the}} yeast and upon the length of time the <b>yeast</b> is <b>stored</b> at 5 °C. (3) Mixtures of zymins of different activities gives a resultant activity which is lower than the theoretical activity of the mixture. (4) The washing of a fresh yeast which normally would yield a zymin of low activity produces considerably higher activity. (5) Zymins respond differently toward ammonium chloride, and the differences range from definite inhibition to stimulation as high as 80 percent. There also is a fairly good correlation between the activity of a zymin and the degree of stimulation by ammonium chloride. The less active a zymin is, the more than zymin is stimulated by ammonium chloride, and the higher the optimum concentration of ammonium chloride will be. (6) In a series of studies with methyl ammonium chlorides, stimulation is observable which is similar to that observed with ammonium chloride, but the degree of stimulation is progressively less according to the following series: NH 4 + CH 3 NH 3 + (CH 3) 2 NH 2 + (CH 3) NH+. (7) The effect of magnesium sulfate appears to be rather consistently the same regardless of the activity of the zymin. (8) A substance was separated from a zymin of low activity which had an inhibitory effect on the activity of more active zymins. Its action was, in turn, strongly depressed by small concentrations of ammonium chloride. (9) The effects of magnesium sulfate and ammonium chloride were inhibitory in the fermentation of sodium hexosediphosphate. (10) The effects of both salts were also inhibitory in the fermentation of dihydroxyacetone. (11) The salts were inhibitory in the fermentation of sodium pyruvate. However, in the presence of ethanol, ammonium chloride 2 ̆ 2 protected 2 ̆ 2 the system from the toxic effect of ethanol, and therefore a stimulation occurred...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Barcodes {{are unique}} DNA {{sequence}} tags {{that can be}} used to specifically label individual mutants. The barcode-tagged open reading frame (ORF) haploid deletion mutant collections in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe allow for high-throughput mutant phenotyping because the relative growth of mutants in a population can be determined by monitoring the proportions of their associated barcodes. While these mutant collections have greatly facilitated genome-wide studies, mutations in essential genes are not present, and the roles of these genes are not as easily studied. To further support genome-scale research in S. pombe, we generated a barcode-tagged fission yeast insertion mutant library that has the potential of generating viable mutations in both essential and non-essential genes and can be easily analyzed using standard molecular biological techniques. Results An insertion vector containing a selectable ura 4 + marker and a random barcode was used to generate a collection of 10, 000 fission <b>yeast</b> insertion mutants <b>stored</b> individually in 384 -well plates and as six pools of mixed mutants. Individual barcodes are flanked by Sfi I recognition sites and can be oligomerized in a unique orientation to facilitate barcode sequencing. Independent genetic screens on a subset of mutants suggest that this library contains a diverse collection of single insertion mutations. We present several approaches to determine insertion sites. Conclusions This collection of S. pombe barcode-tagged insertion mutants is well-suited for genome-wide studies. Because insertion mutations may eliminate, reduce or alter the function of essential and non-essential genes, this library will contain strains with a wide range of phenotypes that can be assayed by their associated barcodes. The design of the barcodes in this library allows for barcode sequencing using next generation or standard benchtop cloning approaches. </p...|$|R
40|$|This study {{combined}} moist airtight {{storage of}} moist grain with pig feed fermentation. Starter cultures {{with the potential}} to facilitate both technologies were added to airtight stored moist crimped cereal grain, and the impact on storage microflora and the quality of feed fermentations generated from the grain was investigated. Four treatments were compared: three based on moist barley, either un inoculated (M), inoculated with Wickerhamomyces anomalus (W), or inoculated with W. anomalus and LAB starter culture, containing Pediococcus acidilactici DSM 16243, Pediococcus pentosaceus DSM 12834 and Lactobacillus plantarum DSM 12837 (WLAB); and one treatment based on dried barley (D). After 6 weeks of storage, four feed fermentations FM, FW, FWLAB, and FD, were initiated from M, W, WLAB and D, respectively, by mixing the grain with water to a dry matter content of 30 %. Each treatment was fermented in batch initially for 7 days and then kept in a continuous mode by adding new feed daily with 50 % back-slop. During the 6 week storage period, the average water activity decreased in M, W and WLAB from 0. 96 to 0. 85, and cereal pH decreased from approximately 6. 0 at harvest to 4. 5. Feed fermentation conferred a further pH decrease to 3. 8 – 4. 1. In M, W and WLAB, moulds and Enterobacteriaceae were mostly below detection limit, whereas both organism groups were detected in D. In fermented feed, Enterobacteriaceae were below detection limit in almost all conditions. Moulds were detected in FD, for most of the fermentation time in FM and at some sampling points in FW and FWLAB. Starter organisms, especially W. anomalus and L. plantarum comprised a considerable proportion of the yeast and LAB populations, respectively, in both stored grain and fermented feed. However, autochthonous Pichia kudriavzevii and Kazachstania exigua partially dominated the <b>yeast</b> populations in <b>stored</b> grain and fermented feed, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Pulsed {{electrical}} field (PEF) {{technology offers}} {{an alternative to}} thermal pasteurisation of high-acid fruit juices, by extending the shelf life of food products, while retaining its fresh taste and nutritional value. Substantial research has been performed {{on the effect of}} electrical field strength on the inactivation kinetics of spoilage and pathogenic micro-organisms and on the outgrowth of spoilage micro-organisms during shelf life. However, studies on the effect of electrical field strength on the inactivation and outgrowth of surviving populations during shelf life are missing. In this study, we assessed the influence of electrical field strength applied by PEF processing and storage temperature on the outgrowth of surviving yeast and mould populations naturally present in fresh fruit smoothie in time. Therefore, an apple-strawberry-banana smoothie was treated in a continuous-flow PEF system (130 L/h), using similar inlet and outlet conditions (preheating temperature 41 °C, maximum temperature 58 °C) to assure that the amount of energy across the different conditions was kept constant. Smoothies treated with variable electrical field strengths (13. 5, 17. 0, 20. 0 and 24. 0 kV/cm) were compared to smoothies without treatment for outgrowth of yeasts and moulds. Outgrowth of <b>yeasts</b> and moulds <b>stored</b> at 4 °C and 7 °C was analysed by plating and visual observation and yeast growth was modelled using the modified logistic growth model (Zwietering model). Results showed that the intensity of the electrical field strength had an influence on the degree of inactivation of yeast cells, resulting in a faster outgrowth over time at lower electrical field strength. Outgrowth of moulds over time was not affected by the intensity of the electrical field strength used. Application of PEF introduces a trade-off between type of spoilage: in untreated smoothie yeasts lead to spoilage after 8 days when stored at 4 or 7 °C, whereas in PEF treated smoothie yeasts were (partly) inactivated and provided outgrowth opportunities for moulds, which led to spoilage by moulds after 14 days (7 °C) or 18 days (4 °C). </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{fermentation}} process is of major importance in beer production. During fermentation, yeast cells use the available nutrients in wort {{for growth and}} maintenance metabolism. In order to grow during the first fermentation phase, yeast cells need to synthesize appropriate levels of essential membrane compounds. Hence, one major role of dissolved oxygen is to promote the biosynthesis of ergosterol and unsaturated fatty acids in brewery fermentations. Traditionally, oxygen is provided through wort oxygenation but this technique has several disadvantages. In order to avoid those, yeast cells can be directly exposed to oxygen before fermentation in a controlled process known as preoxygenation, thereby removing the requirement for subsequent wort oxygenation. However, industrial applications of this technique are scarce, due to the inconsistent and limited scientific studies {{and the lack of}} knowledge regarding the biochemical background of the preoxygenation of yeast cells. Therefore, the main objectives of this study were to examine the influence of preoxygenation on beer production parameters and to gain better insight in the yeast’s metabolism during both processes. First of all, the preoxygenation ability of different ale and lager yeast strains was studied. Despite the different response of the yeast strains tested, successful results have been achieved. Large variations in sterol and UFA synthesis during preoxygenation were observed. Though, the fermentation performance of preoxygenated yeast cells in de-aerated wort was a good indication for the success of the treatment. In a next series of experiments, the possibility to use yeast preoxygenation {{as an alternative to the}} conventional wort aeration process in normal brewing practice has been studied on pilote scale. This demonstrated that the use of the preoxygenation technique enables us to produce beers with similar characteristics as the traditionally brewed beers. Yeast fermentation performance, yeast growth and aroma compound formation were comparable. Profiles of sterols and unsaturated fatty acid levels during preoxygenation and subsequent fermentation or during the traditional fermentation also seemed to be very similar. Moreover, cropping of the yeast cells and reuse of them after preoxygenation has proven to be possible without loss of quality. It could also be concluded that preoxygenation can be used successfully for re{{fermentation process}}es. Though, since preoxygenated yeast cells seem to be more sensitive to the storage conditions than untreated yeast cells, it is recommended to use fresh <b>yeast</b> cells, as <b>stored</b> cells are generally of inferior physiological condition. In general, it is suggested to minimize the yeast storage time at temperatures as low as possible. We also performed a comparative genome-wide expression analysis on yeast samples harvested during the exponential phase of the fermentation in order to compare yeast behavior during fermentation after preoxygenation or wort aeration. No major differences in gene expression halfway fermentation were obtained, proving once again that preoxygenation and wort aeration lead to similar results. However, aeration of both yeast and wort resulted in a slightly shorter exponential phase, bringing the yeast faster into stationary phase. This resulted in biosynthetically more active yeast cells, with an enhanced yeast growth and an overall increased fermentation performance (14 %). Microarray analyses demonstrated that the expression of yeast genes involved in amino acid metabolism, reserve carbohydrate metabolism and stress resistance were accordingly affected. Next, a first attempt was made to better characterize the oxygen need of yeast cells. Yeast cells must be capable of responding rapidly at the physiological level to changes in their oxygen environment, for example to protect themselves against potential oxidative stress. Using real-time PCR, genes involved in transcriptional control, respiration, detoxification, stress response and lipid metabolism were examined during preoxygenation. This experiment showed that, during preoxygenation, the yeast cells seem to acquire stress resistance as they accumulate the stress-protectant trehalose and induce the expression of genes involved in detoxification processes and of stress-responsive genes. Finally, the general belief is that wort aeration has a negative impact on wort quality, which could result in more rapid beer staling. Since this study showed that almost identical beers could be produced with the preoxygenation as with the wort-aeration technique, preoxygenation proved to be the ideal tool to investigate the effect of wort aeration on beer flavor stability. GC-MS analyses and sensory analysis did not reveal significant differences in beer staling between the wort aeration and the preoxygenation treatment, for pilsner as well as for ale type beers. Therefore it can be stated that the classical wort aeration process does not have a negative impact on beer ageing. It can be concluded that yeast preoxygenation is a worthy alternative to wort aeration. Moreover, our study has provided several new insights into the behavior of yeast cells during the preoxygenation and fermentation process in normal brewing practice. status: publishe...|$|R
