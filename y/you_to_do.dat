500|$|During the film's {{pre-production}} at Paramount, Boorman cast Bill Paxton and Billy Bob Thornton in {{the lead}} roles of Hank and Jacob Mitchell, respectively. A Simple Plan marked the second on-screen collaboration between Paxton and Thornton after One False Move (1992). Thornton recalled, [...] "I {{got a call from}} one of my agents who said, 'John Boorman wants <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a script that I sent you a year ago and you never read,' I said, 'Send it to me again, and this time I'll really read it.' Within the first two pages, I knew I wanted to do it." ...|$|E
500|$|The première {{took place}} 16 February 1925 {{at a concert}} of the [...] (SMI) at the Salle Érard in Paris. [...] The mélodies were {{performed}} by Jane Bathori and conducted by Darius Milhaud. [...] Delage had gotten Bathori to agree to perform it {{late in the year}} before. In a letter to her dated 27 September 1924, he wrote: [...] "My publisher had to send you my seven little things in the hope they would interest you.... They are a bit basic for your great virtuosity, but that could tempt <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something good with them".|$|E

500|$|Despite time {{constraints}} imposed on {{him by the}} expansion of his business, Boulton continued his [...] "philosophical" [...] work (as scientific experimentation was then called). [...] He wrote in his notebooks observations on the freezing and boiling point of mercury, on people's pulse rates at different ages, on {{the movements of the}} planets, and on how to make sealing wax and disappearing ink. [...] However, Erasmus Darwin, another fellow enthusiast who {{became a member of the}} Lunar Society, wrote to him in 1763, [...] "As you are now become a sober plodding Man of Business, I scarcely dare trouble <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> me a favour in the... philosophical way." ...|$|E
500|$|You need a {{character}} {{to pose a}} problem or give out a quest or be a barrier of some kind. I don't like to make the [...] outright say [...] "I need <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> X, then I'll give you Y"...– it makes the character into an automated quest kiosk. I like the characters to come off like people actually do – they don't say [...] "hi" [...] when strangers come knocking, they say [...] "who the hell are you?" [...] or they're expecting you and know more than they let on, or they don't care. I don't like my [...] to be standing around as if their lives begin when the character starts talking to them and end when the player leaves.|$|E
500|$|Tessa {{is able to}} empathise with others, feel as they do, {{think as}} they do and so become like them. When MacLeod {{revealed}} his immortality to Tessa in [...] "Counterfeit Part Two", she can show compassion instead of the fear or disgust he expects: [...] "I was just thinking how lonely you must be. Your parents, your friends... having them all die." [...] Tessa is a very empathic and understanding character, for example, in [...] "Saving Grace", she is jealous of MacLeod's former lover Grace; however, when MacLeod assures her {{that he no longer}} loves Grace, her response is simply that [...] "...that's all that need to be said. She's your friend and she's been hurt. You'll help her. I'd expect <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> no less." ...|$|E

500|$|Herodotus recounts that Megabates made {{inspections}} {{of the ships}} (probably whilst beached for the night), and came across one ship from Myndus which had not posted any sentries. Megabates ordered his guard to find {{the captain of the}} ship, Scylax, and then had the captain thrust into one of the ship's oar holes with his head outside and his body inside the ship. News reached Aristagoras of the treatment of his friend and he went to Megabates and asked him to reconsider his decision. When Megabates refused to grant Aristagoras's wishes, Aristagoras simply cut the captain loose himself. Predictably, Megabates was furious with Aristagoras, who in turn retorted [...] "But you, what have <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with these matters? Did not Artaphrenes send you to obey me and to sail wherever I bid you? Why are you so meddlesome?". According to Herodotus, Megabates was so enraged by this that he sent messengers to the Naxians to warn them of the approach of the Persian force.|$|E
500|$|Steven Spielberg and John Williams {{had worked}} {{together}} on fifteen films before Saving Private Ryan (1998). The score was recorded at Symphony Hall in Boston, Massachusetts {{with the assistance of}} the Boston Symphony Orchestra. After having recorded the re-edited version Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) and some Schindler's List (1993) at Symphony Hall previously, this was the third time Spielberg and Williams worked on a soundtrack at this location. Spielberg chose Symphony Hall as the site for the recording because the hall gives [...] "rich, warm sound off the walls and ceiling" [...] and allows you to [...] "hear the air," [...] which some soundstages do not allow <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Spielberg stated he chose to work with the Boston Symphony Orchestra because the film deals with a [...] "company of soldiers" [...] and the orchestra was an [...] "experienced company of musicians." [...] Over the course of a three-day period in February 1998, the score for the film was recorded at a rate of around $100,000 an hour.|$|E
500|$|A heated {{nomination}} battle emerged between Clinton and Barack Obama. Ferraro became livid and distraught {{when one}} of her daughters voted for Obama in the Massachusetts primary, saying [...] "What is the matter with you? You know Hillary. You have seen my involvement with her." [...] When her daughter responded by noting that Obama was inspirational, Ferraro snapped, [...] "What does he inspire <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> leave your husband and three kids and your practice and go work for Doctors Without Borders?" [...] This {{was seen as an}} example of a generational difference among American women; in contrast to Ferraro's generation, younger women saw nothing special about electing a woman president (especially one with Clinton's past history) compared to what writer Anne Kornblut called [...] "the milestone of electing an African American president". According to Kornblut, younger voters saw [...] "Clinton [...] both a relic of that era and a victim of its success. She was the wrong woman at the wrong time; she was a Clinton; she hadn't gotten there on her own".|$|E

500|$|If the {{candidate}} was manic, {{he was also}} dedicated and filled with good humor, {{and he had a}} particular genius for getting media attention. He spent long hours registering voters and shaking hands at bus stops and movie theater lines. He took whatever opportunity came along to promote himself. He thoroughly enjoyed campaigning, and his success was evident. With the large numbers of volunteers, he had dozens at a time stand along the busy thoroughfare of Market Street as human billboards, holding [...] "Milk for Assembly" [...] signs while commuters drove {{into the heart of the}} city to work. He distributed his campaign literature anywhere he could, including among one of the most influential political groups in the city, the Peoples Temple, an organization that Milk attended regularly. Milk's volunteers even took thousands of brochures and because the Peoples Temple leader, Jim Jones, was a politically powerful individual in San Francisco, Milk encouraged Temple members to work his phones, spoke at the Temple and later wrote a letter to President Jimmy Carter defending Jones character. Milk's relationship with the Temple was not entirely similar to other politicians' in Northern California. According to The San Francisco Examiner, Jones and his parishioners were a [...] "potent political force", helping to elect Moscone (who appointed him to the Housing Authority), District Attorney Joseph Freitas, and Sheriff Richard Hongisto. (Jacobs, John [...] [...] "S.F.'s Leaders Recall Jones the Politician", The San Francisco Examiner, p.C.) [...] Milk spoke at the Temple ("Another Day of Death", Time, December 11, 1978.) and defended Jones in a letter to President Jimmy Carter in 1978. [...] (In that letter he called Jones [...] "a man of the highest character," [...] and criticized outspoken Temple defectors for trying to [...] "damage Rev. Jones' reputation" [...] with [...] "apparent bold-faced lies".) (Coleman, Loren (2004), The Copycat Effect, Simon & Schuster, p.68.). [...] However, When Milk learned Jones was backing both him and Art Agnos in 1976, he told friend Michael Wong, [...] "Well fuck him. I'll take his workers, but, that's the game Jim Jones plays." [...] But to his volunteers, he said: [...] "Make sure you're always nice to the Peoples Temple. If they ask <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something, do it, and then send them a note thanking them for asking <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it." ...|$|E
500|$|At Murfreesboro, Breckinridge's Division was {{assigned}} to Lieutenant General William J. Hardee's Corps and was stationed {{on the east side}} of the Stones River. When the Union Army of the Cumberland, commanded by Major General William Rosecrans, attacked on December 31, 1862, beginning the Battle of Stones River, Bragg's main force initially repelled the attack. Bragg ordered Breckinridge to reinforce him on the west side of the river, but Brigadier General John Pegram, who commanded a Cavalry brigade, erroneously reported that a large Union force was advancing along the east bank, and Breckinridge was slow to comply with Bragg's order. When he finally crossed the river, his attacks were ineffective, and Bragg ordered him back across the river. By January 2, Union forces had taken a ridge that ran along the river; against Breckinridge's advice, Bragg ordered the 2nd Division to launch a near-suicidal attack on the federal position. Prior to the attack, Breckinridge wrote to Preston, [...] "if [...] should result in disaster and I be among the killed, I want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> justice to my memory and tell the people that I believed this attack to be very unwise and tried to prevent it." ...|$|E
500|$|Less than an {{hour before}} the {{independence}} ceremony a Belgian officer arrived to request that Lumumba depart for parliament. Kasongo was disturbed by what Lumumba planned to say and told Kanza as he left, [...] "I'm counting on <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> your best to tone down that speech." [...] As Lumumba dressed, Kanza and one of the secretaries, André Mandi, read through as much of the speech as they could, replacing some individual words with less inflammatory language and crossing out several full paragraphs deemed too difficult to temper. Lumumba then left in a motorcade for his official residence to rendezvous {{with the rest of his}} government. Kanza and Mandi followed in the second car, making additional revisions to the speech. These were so extensive that both feared Lumumba would be unable to clearly read his remarks. Upon their arrival at the residence, Kanza and Mandi briefly explained their alterations to Lumumba. Greatly pleased with the result, Lumumba stated that he would read some parts of the speech verbatim, then improvise to respond to the atmosphere in the room as he saw fit. He made his own alterations to the script during the speeches given by Baudouin and Kasa-Vubu.|$|E

500|$|McCain {{entered the}} United States Naval Academy in 1927, at age 16. [...] He disliked the hazing {{tradition}} and behavioral restrictions of Annapolis, and accumulated many [...] and earned mediocre grades {{during his years}} at the Academy. [...] As one biographer wrote, McCain [...] "was given to taking unauthorized midnight leave and {{spent much of his}} four ... years in contention with authority and working off massive doses of extra duty." [...] McCain later stated: [...] "I was known as a 'ratey' plebe, and that's the plebe who does not conform always to the specific rules and regulations of the upperclassmen. Some of these upperclassmen would ... require <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> such things which only incited rebellion and mutiny in me, see." [...] At one point, McCain had so many demerits he was at risk of not graduating; his partying and drinking was especially dangerous as it was taking place during Prohibition. [...] For much of his final year there, he was banished from Bancroft Hall, the normal residence for midshipmen, and forced instead to live on the barracks ship [...] [...] He graduated in 1931, finishing 423rd out of 441 in class rank, nineteenth from the bottom.|$|E
500|$|At Trenton, Washington faced a dilemma. All but {{a handful}} of his men's enlistments were expiring on December 31, and he knew that the army would {{collapse}} unless he convinced them to stay. So, on the 30th, Washington appealed to his men to stay one month longer for a bounty of ten dollars. He asked any men who wanted to volunteer to poise their firelocks, but not a man turned out. Washington then wheeled his horse around and rode in front of the troops, saying [...] "My brave fellows, you have done all I asked <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> and more than could be reasonably expected; but your country is at stake, your wives, your houses and all that you hold dear. You have worn yourselves out with fatigues and hardships, but we know not how to spare you. If you will consent to stay only one month longer, you will render that service to the cause of liberty and to your country which you probably never can do under any other circumstances." [...] At first no one stepped forward, but then one soldier stepped forward, and he was followed by most of the others, leaving only a few in the original line.|$|E
500|$|Disney then {{assigned}} Larry Clemmons as his new {{writer and}} one of the four story men for the film, giving Clemmons a copy of Kipling's book, and telling him: [...] "The first thing I want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is not to read it." [...] Clemmons still looked at the novel, and thought it was too disjointed and without continuity, needing adaptations to fit a film script. Clemmons wanted to start in medias res, with some flashbacks afterwards, but then Disney said to focus on doing the storyline more straight - [...] "Let's do the meat of the picture. Let's establish the characters. Let's have fun with it.". Although much of Bill Peet's work was discarded, the personalities of the characters remained in the final film. This was because Disney felt that the story should be kept simple, and the characters should drive the story. Disney took {{an active role in the}} story meetings, acting out each role and helping to explore the emotions of the characters, help create gags and develop emotional sequences. Clemmons would write a rough script with an outline for most sequences. The story artists then discussed how to fill the scenes, including the comedic gags to employ. The script also tried to incorporate how the voice actors molded their characters and interacted with each other. The Jungle Book also marks the last animated film from the company to have Disney's personal touches, before his death on December 15, 1966.|$|E
