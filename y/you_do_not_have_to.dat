Following this disaster, Homer then cheers up Burns {{by pointing out that}} being loved means you have to be nice to people everyday but being hated means <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do anything. Burns agrees with that logic, saying [...] "I'm a selfish old crank--and that fits me like a Speedo!"

[...] The Oxford Boat Club president Pinsent conceded: [...] "They put right a lot of mistakes they have made in the past, and they rowed outstandingly well." [...] Spracklen agreed: [...] "Cambridge got too far away. [...] They were a better boat in that race. [...] All credit to them." [...] Cambridge's number two, David Gillard, said [...] "there was a lot of revenge out there".|$|E

2500|$|The title role—"one of {{the most}} taxing and wide-ranging parts in the entire repertory"—is one {{of the most}} {{difficult}} in the soprano repertoire. It calls for great vocal control of range, flexibility, and dynamics as well as containing a wide range of emotions: conflict of personal and public life, romantic life, maternal love, friendship, jealousy, murderous intent, and resignation. The German soprano Lilli Lehmann once remarked that the singing of all three Brünnhilde roles of Wagner's opera cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen in one evening would be less stressful than the singing of one Norma. She also commented [...] "When you sing Wagner, you are so carried away by the dramatic emotion, the action, and the scene that <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> think how to sing the words. That comes of itself. But in Bellini, you must always have a care for beauty of tone and correct emission."According to the Met Opera Archives Lehmann said this to Herald Tribune critic Henry Krehbiel.|$|E

6000|$|Vancouver {{three years}} ago was swept off by fire in sixteen minutes, and only one house was left standing. To-day it has a {{population}} of fourteen thousand people, and builds its houses out of brick with dressed granite fronts. But a great sleepiness lies on Vancouver as compared with an American town: men don't fly up and down the streets telling lies, and the spittoons in the delightfully comfortable hotel are unused; the baths are free and their doors are unlocked. <b>You</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> dig up the hotel clerk when you want to bathe, which shows the inferiority of Vancouver. An American bade me notice the absence of bustle, and was alarmed when in a loud and audible voice I thanked God for it. [...] "Give me granite--hewn granite and peace," [...] quoth I, [...] "and keep your deal boards and bustle for yourselves." ...|$|E

If you want to read a book merely for pleasure, you are allowed to take it out and live with it as long as you like; the copy you have is immediately replaced with another, so that you do not feel hurried and are not obliged to ramp through it in a week or a fortnight.|$|E

6000|$|The chamois is a {{black or}} brown {{creature}} {{no bigger than a}} mustard seed; <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> go after it, it comes after you; it arrives in vast herds and skips and scampers all over your body, inside your clothes; thus it is not shy, but extremely sociable; it is not afraid of man, on the contrary, it will attack him; its bite is not dangerous, but neither is it pleasant; its activity has not been overstated --if you try to put your finger on it, it will skip a thousand times its own length at one jump, and no eye is sharp enough to see where it lights. A great deal of romantic nonsense {{has been written about the}} Swiss chamois and the perils of hunting it, whereas the truth is that even women and children hunt it, and fearlessly; indeed, everybody hunts it; the hunting is going on all the time, day and night, in bed and out of it. It is poetic foolishness to hunt it with a gun; very few people do that; there is not one man in a million who can hit it with a gun. It is much easier to catch it than it is to shoot it, and only the experienced chamois-hunter can do either. Another common piece of exaggeration is that about the [...] "scarcity" [...] of the chamois. It is the reverse of scarce. Droves of one hundred million chamois are not unusual in the Swiss hotels. Indeed, they are so numerous as to be a great pest. The romancers always dress up the chamois-hunter in a fanciful and picturesque costume, whereas the best way to hunt this game is to do it without any costume at all.|$|E
