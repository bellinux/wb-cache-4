40|$|Pirn winding is an {{operation}} of winding yarn from supply <b>yarn</b> <b>package</b> onto pirns {{which are used}} for shuttle weft insertion. As the package size varies when winding pirns, the varying balloon effect caused to change the thread tension at the winding point of the pirn.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Supercritical fluids {{have special}} {{properties}} {{that could lead}} to substantial improvements when utilized as replacements for water in wet processing of textiles. These fluids have densities and solvating powers similar to liquid solvents combined with viscosity values and diffusion coefficients like those observed for gases. In particular, these properties make supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO 2) one of the most beneficial and environmentally acceptable solvents used in manufactur-ing processes today. Therefore, it is anticipated that commercial textile processes using SC-CO 2 will have many advantages when compared to conventional aqueous processes. Succesful commercialization of SC-CO 2 processing will improve the economics of dyeing and other textile chemical processes by eliminating wastewater discharges, reducing energy consumption, eliminating drying, and reducing air emissions. As a result, the use of SC-CO 2 is expected to make textile processing more economical and environmentally friendly. Research groups throughout the world are investigating SC-CO 2 textile processing. Succesful pilot dyeing machines have been operated and even publicly exhibited within the past few years. Research focused to developing a commercial dyeing process for polyester yarn packages is in its sixth year within the College of Textiles at North Carolina State University. Process development has been accomplished using a single-package SC-CO 2 dyeing machine located in the Model Manufacturing Facility of the College.

40|$|Yarn {{diameter}} is {{an important}} property which affects the physical properties of the end products. Variations in yarn diameter cause undesirable effects such as imperfections in the knitted or woven fabric and difficulties in weaving prep-aration stages. Thin places in the yarn cause low breaking strength creating difficulties in the downstream processes such as warping, sizing and weaving. Thick places and neps cause appearance imperfections in the fabric. As is known in winding, yarns on spinning bobbins are assembled into larger <b>yarn</b> <b>packages</b> with different tech-niques of splicing. In splicing, {{it is very important}} to obtain a splice with a diameter that is close to the diameter of the parent yarn for the reasons mentioned above. Many studies have been carried out in order to investigate the effects of splicing parameters on the diameter of the splices in yarns. Cheng and Lam investigated different properties of spliced ring spun yarns such as abrasion, bending rigidity and appearance [1, 2]. 1 They used an overall score to evaluate the data obtained from experiments and found that yarn linear density and the degree of overlapping of yarn ends mostly affect the overall spliced yarn properties [1, 2]. Das et al. studied the parameters of fiber friction, yarn twist and splicing air pressure. They observed that the diameter of the splices in yarn is influenced by yarn twist and splicing air pressure [3]. Drobina and Machnio applied image analysis for the identification of the geometric sizes of spliced zones [4].

40|$|Abstract — Pirn winding is an {{operation}} of winding yarn from supply <b>yarn</b> <b>package</b> onto pirns {{which are used}} for shuttle weft insertion. Firm and coherent winding tension is required to maintain in the pirn winding process to withstand the high forces produced by the deceleration of the shuttle {{at the end of}} each pick and to avoid permanent strains in yarns which will appears as fabric defects in weaving. The package size and its diameter vary due to subsequent winding of pirns. Hence the balloon effect varies and caused to change the thread tension at the winding point of the pirn. The thread tension variation is considerably significant from the first pirn wound from a package to the last pirn wound from the same if no tension controlling mechanism is devised. Placing dead weights on the disc tension controller which adds a tension to take off tension may help to compensate the yarn tension variation to some extent to combat with this problem. However, this is a stepwise manual compensation technique which needs the correct timing of compensation to avoid significant tension variations in pirn windings. The author attempted to theoretically analyze the tension variation in the yarn path of the pirn winding machine and theoretically model the tension variation with and without deadweight placement on the tensioners. Author also verified the accuracy and the validity of the model developed through the experimental results obtained at different locations along the yarn path. ...|$|E
40|$|Drying process needs lots {{of energy}} and usually prone to high {{equipment}} and operational cost. Research tasks have focused on improving the drying performance and reducing the energy consumption rate. Among a number of industries, textile manufacturing needs the process intensively. It is surprising that little research has concerned principle enhancement and drying process design. In the support by Fong’s National Engineering Company Limited, a series of research that targeting to the inadequacy of technology development for machinery and process design have been conducted. The redevelopment of machinery design has based upon a heat setting machine –ECO dryer. The machine {{was used as a}} working platform to supply all necessary testing information before and after the enhancement. The ductwork and air distribution system design have been revised to improve the unevenness drying problems appeared in the heat setting of fabrics. Two main research scopes have been performed that included {{the development of a new}} duct sizing approach –Uniform Jet Velocity (UJV) and redesigning the air chambers. The proposed UJV approach is a new air duct design model developed from fluid dynamics principles. The air jet speed along each nozzle is maintained at a constant rate to provide a uniform jet impingement effect. A duct size algorithm was proposed to adjust the cross sectional area ratio between the main and branch streams for the target of producing a constant impingement velocity across the entire air duct. In the enhancement of the air distribution system design, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analytical approaches were used to model air flow patterns before and after the redesign of air chambers. The CFD analysis results told that a linear air distribution system with four sub-chamber design could produce the best air distribution pattern on the ECO dryer. The request of an accurate drying cycle time predication is also large in textile industry. It is because the problems of under-and over-drying usually happen in the jet impingement process. The second essential objective in the research is to develop systematical approaches for a good qualifying of a drying cycle. Four analytical models have been studied that included First order kinetics, Diffusion, model based on solutions of diffusion equation and Wet surface. An equation for each of the models was developed to describe the characteristics of a porous type fabric drying process. In the study, the required modeling parameters were empirically determined, and the accuracy among the models has been compared. Findings from the research have proved that the model based on solutions of diffusion equation can be the best strategy in presenting a drying cycle under different machine settings. The investigation has not ceased after the completion of the hot air jet impingement research. The study objectives have moved onto an alternative drying technology using steam as the drying medium. Due to many problems reported in the drying of <b>yarn</b> <b>packages</b> using electro-magnetic waves, moist heat drying technology is urgently needed. At the final part of the research, two CFD simulation models namely constant viscous resistance and increasing viscous resistance were studied. A preliminary result generated from ANSYS CFD analysis results was obtained that has opened up a new study area for further elaboration of a new drying technology, and hopefully can be practically applied to textile industry in the near future. published_or_final_versionMechanical EngineeringMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In fashion industry, {{customer}} {{demand is}} constantly changing. One {{of the main}} reasons is due to the time of delicate fashion awareness among the consumers, which has come into larger variety and frequent assortment changes. The changing trends in fashion industry allow researchers to get into the postponement strategy as a customized operation in order to focus on quality and flexibility. In today’s fashion market the key for success is {{to keep an eye on}} and react to the customer demand. H&M is Europe’s second largest fashion retailer in terms of sales and our work will reflect on H&M supply chain particularly. We try to figure out business strategies such as mass customization and standardization, which H&M is using in their entire supplier chain and in his different processes. Keeping this view in mind, we design our research question, which is about mass customization and standardization and we try to relate these business strategies to the postponement. We try to find out the structure and implementation of these strategies in H&M supply chain with the help of our respondent answers in our proposed questionnaire. For this purpose, an electronic interview with the H&M senior merchandiser in Pakistan liaison office was carried out. The questionnaire contains different questions related to postponement strategy, customization, and standardization and other processes which are used in the supply chain of any fashion industry. The questionnaire consists of 22 major questions. Our research is purely qualitative. We include both types of the data; namely secondary and primary. Secondary data was collected from earlier studies of the literature and related theories of postponement, customization, and standardization and certain areas of fashion retailing, whereas primary data was collected through the electronic interview with Mr. Syed Naqeeb who is working in H&M liaison office as a senior merchandiser in Pakistan. After receiving the questionnaire, we have tried to highlight our research questions with the help of our proposed Frame of Reference in Chapter 2. The Frame of Reference consists of theories which will help the reader to get the clear picture of fashion retailing and the related theories. In the Analysis section, we talk about the activities of H&M and its background followed by its business concept. We define H&M SCM model and draw a figure of H&M complementarities, which we developed by the help of electronic interview. In the Conclusion part, we come to the point that customization and postponement affect fashion retailing by choosing raw material, components, and apparel accessories plus logistic management. The other aspect of our research area is standardization. After the analysis we come to know that Standardization and postponement are also used together in the supply chain of H&M, in raw material, cotton and <b>yarn,</b> dying, <b>packaging</b> and in the care instruction of labels (washing instructions) ...|$|R
40|$|Industries need {{different}} types of drying technologies for their processes. The most traditional and commonly used one is to employ hot air as the drying medium. However, recent research has proved that superheated steam has higher drying capacity than hot air, because the specific heat capacity and heat conductivity of steam are higher than air. In addition, {{it has been found}} that using steam as drying medium can prevent surface hardening. Therefore, steam drying can preserve the quality of products better. This is especially important to heat-sensitive materials, like fruits and textiles. There are lots of research studies on drying process design using superheated steam, however, most of the studies were based on the jet impingement approach. In this research, an alternative approach of using steam for <b>yarn</b> <b>package</b> drying is studied. Superheated steam is generated from saturated steam and passes through the wetted yarn packages by establishing a pressure gradient between the up and down stream of the process. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis has been carried out using ANSYS 13 to model the heat and mass transfer process for the entire drying cycle, and to determine analytical solutions to quantify the residual water in the packages against cycle time. An industrial grade dryer prototype has been built to support experimental tests. Experimental results have been empirically used to assist the assignment of viscous resistance factor for CFD simulation studies. In the simulation process, the yarn packages have been assumed to be porous homogeneous. The drying rate under different pressures gradients between the up and down stream has been observed. The ultimate goals from the CFD results are to explore mathematical relationships in the drying process and predict the fastest drying rate with minimum amount of steam used...|$|E
40|$|Random winding {{is widely}} used for the {{preparation}} of yarn packages used {{in a variety of}} textile processes. Ribboning caused by overwinding of yarn turns at certain places within the package is a basic problem encountered in this process. Standard random winders incorporate some means of ribbon breaking, which strictly speaking have limited effectiveness. The research reported in thesis was undertaken to realise a random winder capable of detecting the occurrence of ribboning, and taking the ribbon breaking action at these precise times, and thereby achieve 'active' ribbon breaking. Such a winder was realised by the addition of suitable transducers to a standard random winder, which could be controlled by a PC. Winding trials carried out using this equipment established the effectiveness of the concept and also the greater freedom from ribboning the method achieved in comparison with other available methods. Unwinding trials carried out by suitably modifying the winder for measuring yarn unwinding tension were also used to establish the effectiveness of active ribbon breaking. Preliminary experiments carried out on the above apparatus showed the possibility of constructing a Angle of Double Traverse (ADT) diagram on the VDU of the PC during winding operations, which could serve as a useful aid to follow the progress of the winding operation. It was very useful for showing the occurrence of major and minor ribboning in the wound package, and also for visually indicating the effectiveness of the ribbon breaking procedures. The diagram was of further use in studying the nature of package driving by the grooved drum. The case of driving a deformable body such as a <b>yarn</b> <b>package</b> on a comparatively non-deformable grooved drum is important for understanding how the package rotates without any obvious slipping. By varying the winding conditions, it was in fact shown that some measurable slip occurs, and these relationships were experimentally established. Computer simulation is useful to determine the stresses within a wound package, particularly as these cannot be measured using conventional techniques. The results of such a simulation carried out on a random wound package and the comparison of the results with those obtained for a precision wound package are also presented...|$|E
