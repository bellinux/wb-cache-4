25|$|Stick heights are {{not only}} {{important}} for visual reasons but they also strongly affect the sound quality. To get a uniform and consistent sound, one must play with even stick heights {{on the right and}} left hand. To practice playing with accurate stick heights, set up your drum or pad in front of a mirror. Start with a simple exercise and watch to see if your left heights are even with your right. If you have access to a video camera, you can record yourself and watch it later. It is easier to watch your heights and critique <b>your</b> <b>performance</b> when you are not focusing on playing.|$|E
500|$|Mega Man X {{received}} {{criticism from}} some publications as well. Ed Semrad, Danyon Carpenter, and Al Manuel of the EGM review panel all {{noted that the}} game may have too low a difficulty level; Semrad disliked the introductory stage and felt that the game was too short as well. Super Play editor Zy Nicholson lowered his review score of the game because he found the levels were neither large nor challenging. [...] "A few elementary tricks like repeating easy sections to recoup energy and weapon power will see you through the harder bits," [...] Nicholson explained. [...] "Within the level you'll also find restart points, extra lives, and no harsh time limit {{to put pressure on}} <b>your</b> <b>performance.</b> Couple this with a password system that records your level completion, status and weapon accumulation and you'll see we're not looking at a lasting challenge for the experienced player." [...] Nintendo Power criticized how little the game had changed stating that [...] "the theme remains the same as the Game Boy and NES Mega Man titles." ...|$|E
500|$|Relations {{between the}} Olympians and the Australian Government {{remained}} tense {{after months of}} political struggle regarding the boycott. The quartet did not receive the customary congratulations from Fraser, who initially resisted complaints the next day from the media and government members at his failure to applaud the Australian victory. In a radio interview, he said [...] "I hope that circumstances do not arise {{over the next few}} years which will cause them to have very great regrets about the fact that they've gone". Fraser relented and late in the night, his office sent a telegram indirectly, through the Australian Embassy in Moscow. Fraser had ordered the Australian diplomatic mission to shun the Olympians, so the embassy staff had to pass the envelopes containing the message through the Olympic Village fence. Fraser's telegram said: [...] "You know I did not and do not approve of Australia being represented at these Olympic Games. I do want to say however that <b>your</b> <b>performance</b> in the relay was a truly great sporting achievement. My personal congratulations." [...] The swimmers tore up the message.|$|E

500|$|From {{the very}} {{beginning}} of the series, fans had expressed dislike towards the character of Duncan. However, he decided to keep playing the character. In a later interview, he said, [...] "Obviously, I acted because I wanted the fans to like the experience. You want <b>your</b> <b>performance</b> to be liked. You don't want to suck. You don't want people to think you suck. That wasn't the goal." [...] Towards the end of the airing of the first season, he stated, [...] "I'm going to be there in every episode next season if we get a second season. So people will either continue to hate me or things will change. Things are going to change for Duncan anyway, as the season resolves. There are going to be different sides of him that you're going to get to see." [...] Before going into the filming of season two, Thomas had told Dunn that he was being written off the show, and Dunn did not react badly to the news, as by that point, it [...] "was actually a decision" [...] for him to return for the second season at all.|$|E

[...] "I had nightmares the first month I was on set. We were shooting it for two months. People say because you're an actor it's {{not a big deal}} because you go in there and it's fake or whatever. But what they don't understand is that it's actually the opposite because, as an actor, when you go in there you have to believe it's real to make <b>your</b> <b>performance</b> real.

2500|$|Owen has said, [...] "My screen work often funds my theatre career – that's the way I {{think of}} it. Theatre {{is where my}} heart and soul is, where I feel {{absolutely}} vocational. Creatively, theatre is the most democratic forum for an actor because you have near total control over <b>your</b> <b>performance.</b> It's also where the playwright can never be censored and, as such, {{that makes it a}} truly democratic forum for debate. And the communal experience, the chemistry that you get between actors and audience can be extraordinary. It can move you in a way that film can't. That's the power of theatre at its best." [...] The role that he would most like to play is Macbeth; other roles on his wish-list include Iago in Othello, Brick in Tennessee Williams' Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, Lenny in Harold Pinter's The Homecoming, and Hamlet [...] "as long as no one gives it to me because it's completely daunting".|$|E

2500|$|After {{releasing}} Back to Basics, Aguilera considered {{launching a}} tour of small clubs like the Blue Note in New York. [...] "I think there is something really special about doing a performance like that and feeling the energy of a more intimate audience, {{and that is something}} we are definitely, definitely going to entertain in the future", she stated. However, Aguilera considered that it is [...] "a more vulnerable approach for <b>your</b> <b>performance.</b> You can't hide behind anything. It's just you, and your audience is right in front of you, but I still love it. I love to perform more than anything else in the world, being on that stage and feeling the energy of the crowd enjoying your music". However, an arena tour would give her more time to work the bigger show and then strip it down to something raw and organic. Before the tour's launching, Aguilera stated that it was her my most inspired show to date. [...] " [...] lots of amazing circus elements and throwback elements to the past and the areas that I am inspired by.

2500|$|In 2007, {{although}} they led {{the table before}} {{the final round of}} matches, Lancashire were again runners-up in the County Championship. After being knocked out of the Twenty20 competition in the group states and performing poorly in the other one-day competitions early in the season, supporters started to become discontented with the captain and coach. Sussex ended up winning the title as Lancashire lost their final match of the competition against Surrey. Chris Adams, the Sussex captain, said [...] "you played well, you had a hard season, there's no shame in <b>your</b> <b>performance</b> and you nearly did it". After the match against Surrey, Chilton was in tears and said [...] "I'm extremely proud of what our guys have achieved though. As captain I'm privileged to have seen the efforts they have put in. To get close to our target was a phenomenal effort but the lads are just broken. Our players have risen to an almighty challenge and to come so close is an enormous effort". After three years as captain, Mark Chilton stepped down in October 2007 and was replaced by Stuart Law who is the most successful captain in Australian domestic cricket. However his captaincy lasted for just one season, and Lancashire again failed to claim any silverware. At {{the end of the season}} Law and veteran player Cork were released, with Chapple replacing Law as captain. In December 2008, Watkinson's job as cricket manager was changed to that of director of cricket– a job which would focus solely on aspects of cricket, rather than the traditional all-encompassing job of general team management. The move was explained by the club chairman as an effort to modernise. In February 2009, it was announced that Peter Moores– who had been sacked as England coach the previous month– would be Lancashire's new coach and had a three-year contract. In 2011 Chapple and Moores took Lancashire to their first outright first-class county championship title since 1934, {{although they}} had shared the title with Surrey in 1950. Despite being reigning champions in 2012, Lancashire had a poor season and were relegated to the Second Division. In 2013 they bounced straight back to Division 1 by winning the second division championship with a game to spare. They were once again relegated to Division 2 on the last day of the 2014 season after failing to win a tightly fought game against Middlesex. Ashley Giles (formerly of Warwickshire and England) was appointed as Director of Cricket and Head Coach after Mike Watkinson stepped down from the role in October 2014.|$|E
