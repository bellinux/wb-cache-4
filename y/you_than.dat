5|$|I {{longed for}} real companionship, for {{apart from that}} life had nothing to offer me in Darmstadt...So {{naturally}} I am bitterly disappointed with myself when I look back, and see {{that in spite of}} great ambitions, good intentions, and real effort, my hopes have nevertheless been completely ship-wrecked...You say, darling, that you would never have caused me hardship intentionally...I only regret the lack of any intention or desire – or rather insight – to be more to me, and that does not mean spending all your time with me, without wishing to share anything with me at the same time. But I am wrong to talk of these things. Your letters are so dear and kind – but so empty and bare – I feel myself through them that I have less to say to <b>you</b> <b>than</b> any other person. Rain – fine weather – things that have happened – that is all I ever have to tell you about – so utterly cut off is my real self, my innermost life, from yours...I have tried again and again {{to talk to you about}} more serious things, when I felt the need to do so – but we never meet each other – we have developed separately...and that is why I feel true companionship is an impossibility for us – because our thoughts will never meet...I love you too so very much, my darling husband, and that is why it is so sad to feel that our life is nevertheless so incomplete...But you are never intentionally to blame for this – I never think that, never...|$|E
25|$|A BBC TV {{biography}} about Frankie Howerd, Rather <b>You</b> <b>Than</b> Me, {{was broadcast}} by BBC Four on 9 April 2008, and repeated on 10 February 2013. The script {{was written by}} Peter Harness, after extensive interviews with Howerd's partner, Dennis Heymer. The comedian David Walliams was cast as Howerd.|$|E
25|$|Throughout his career, Howerd hid his {{potentially}} career-destroying homosexuality (acts between consenting males being {{illegal in}} England and Wales until 1967) from both his audience and his mother, Edith. In 1958, he met wine waiter Dennis Heymer at the Dorchester Hotel while dining with Sir John Mills; Howerd was 40 and Heymer was 28. Heymer became his lover {{as well as}} manager, and stayed with him for more than thirty years, until Howerd's death, with Heymer helping to revive Howerd's flagging career in the 1960s. However, the two had to remain discreet as Howerd feared being blackmailed if anyone beyond his immediate circle found out. The relationship was explored in 2008 in a drama for BBC Four, Rather <b>You</b> <b>Than</b> Me, starring David Walliams and Rafe Spall.|$|E

500|$|In 1874, Longfellow oversaw a 31-volume {{anthology}} called Poems of Places which collected poems representing several geographical locations, including European, Asian, and Arabian countries. Emerson {{was disappointed}} and reportedly told Longfellow: [...] "The world is expecting better things of <b>you</b> <b>than</b> this... You are wasting time {{that should be}} bestowed upon original production". In preparing the volume, Longfellow hired Katherine Sherwood Bonner as an amanuensis.|$|E
500|$|For his PhD thesis, Sommerfeld {{suggested}} that Bethe examine electron diffraction in crystals. As a starting point, Sommerfeld suggested Paul Ewald's 1914 paper on X-ray diffraction in crystals. Bethe later recalled {{that he became}} too ambitious, and, in pursuit of greater accuracy, his calculations became unnecessarily complicated. [...] When he met Wolfgang Pauli for the first time, Pauli told him: [...] "After Sommerfeld's tales about you, I had expected much better from <b>you</b> <b>than</b> your thesis." [...] "I guess from Pauli," [...] Bethe later recalled, [...] "that was a compliment." ...|$|E

Gerðr refuses; she says that she will not endure the {{coercion}} of any man, and says that if Gymir encounters Skírnir then a battle can be expected. Skírnir again reminds Gerðr of his blade and predicts that Gerðr's jötunn father will meet his doom with it. Skírnir warns Gerðr that he will strike her with his Gambanteinn, a wand, that it will tame her to his desires, and says that she will never again be seen by [...] "the sons of men".

500|$|Bagwell's power hike piqued {{the curiosity}} of many {{baseball}} observers. [...] In two minor league seasons from 1989–90, {{he had managed}} six home runs in 932 at bats–a ratio of 155 at bats per home run (AB/HR). [...] With 15 HR {{in his first year}} in Houston, that average shrunk to 36.9. [...] He also exhibited extraordinary plate discipline for a rookie: while ranking tenth in the league in walks with 75, his OBP placed fifth at [...]387. [...] Of the power surge, commented Bagwell to hitting coach Rudy Jaramillo, [...] "That's awesome", to which he reacted, [...] "Awesome? [...] We can get more out of <b>you</b> <b>than</b> that." [...] By altering an approach to contact the pitch with topspin as he did when he arriving to Houston, Jaramillo taught Bagwell to hit with backspin, resulting in a soaring trajectory rather than nose diving. [...] He also habituated Bagwell to manipulate the count, waiting for a pitch to drive instead of indiscriminately swinging at any pitch that appeared to be a strike. [...] Accounted Bagwell of the newfound advantage, [...] "I didn’t hit many home runs in the minor leagues, but when I hit one, when I got backspin on it, it went a long way." ...|$|E

500|$|Blakeman {{said that}} she read the book in a single sitting, before [...] "crying her eyes out". The film {{includes}} the themes of bullying, youth crime, domestic violence, unwanted pregnancy, and teenage angst. For Blakeman, April's [...] "heartbreaking journey in searching for her real mum is also about being brave enough to let love in." [...] Tom Sutcliffe, writing for The Independent, spoke {{of the limits of}} taboo themes in family dramas, and said the film's [...] "account of a life lived in care couldn't have had swearing, or casual drug use, and when a shadow fell over a child's bed at night, it wasn't the care-home manager coming to exercise some horrible , as it might have been in an adult drama". The film also addressed the theme of Asperger syndrome through the character of Poppy. The BBC claimed that Clark, who has the condition herself, was able to offer [...] "a unique take" [...] on the role. Steveson summarised the themes of the film, saying that [...] "At the centre of the story, Marion finds out that she loves this girl. And that is an amazing liberation when you discover someone more important to <b>you</b> <b>than</b> you are. That is what is incredible about becoming a parent – you care about your child more than you care about yourself." ...|$|E
500|$|Before {{and after}} the {{publication}} of the score in 1922, scholars questioned the work's authenticity, and its attribution to Monteverdi continued to be in some doubt until the 1950s. The Italian musicologist Giacomo Benvenuti maintained, {{on the basis of a}} 1942 performance in Milan, that the work was simply not good enough to be by Monteverdi. Apart from the stylistic differences between Il ritorno and Monteverdi's other surviving late opera, L'incoronazione di Poppea, the main issue which raised doubts was the series of discrepancies between the score and the libretto. However, much of the uncertainty concerning the attribution was resolved through the discovery of contemporary documents, all confirming Monteverdi's role as the composer. These documents include a letter from the unknown librettist of Le nozze d'Enea in Lavinia, which discusses Monteverdi's setting of Il ritorno. There is also Badoaro's preface to the Il ritorno libretto, addressed to the composer, which includes the wording [...] "I can firmly state that my Ulysses is more indebted to <b>you</b> <b>than</b> ever was the real Ulysses to the ever-gracious Minerva". A 1644 letter from Badoaro to Michelangelo Torcigliani contains the statement [...] "Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria was embellished with the music of Claudio Monteverdi, a man of great fame and enduring name". Finally, a 1640 booklet entitled Le Glorie della Musica indicates the Badoaro-Monteverdi pairing as the creators of the opera. In the view of conductor and instrumentalist Sergio Vartolo, these findings establish Monteverdi as the principal composer [...] "beyond a shadow of a doubt". Although parts of the music may be by other hands, there is no doubt that the work is substantially Monteverdi's and remains close to his original conception.|$|E
