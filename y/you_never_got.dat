500|$|While {{the verses}} are {{dedicated}} to him, the chorus was written in a third-person point of view, for her fans: [...] "This is for my peoples who just lost somebody / Your best friend, your baby, your man or your lady / Put your hand way up high / We will never say bye / Mamas, daddies, sisters, brothers, friends and cousins / This is for my peoples who lost their grandmothers / Lift your hands to the sky / Because we won't ever say bye bye". As Carey sings the second chorus, she reverts to the singular conversation with her deceased father, however now revisiting 2005, [...] "And <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>got</b> {{a chance to see}} how good I've done / And <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>got</b> to see me back at No. 1", referencing her return to the top of music with The Emancipation of Mimi. The song does not feature a bridge, instead repeating the chorus twice, once in the same key {{as the rest of the}} song, while the other in a raised octave. During the last chorus, Carey's voice is doubled, with her regular tone voice singing softly over the piano chords, while her more prominent and higher pitched vocals are laid over it.|$|E
500|$|Upon the Japanese release, {{the critic}} writing for The Japan Times reflected: [...] "If Lost in Translation is the film you'd make when {{all you know}} about Japan are the pampered press junkets at Shinjuku 5-star hotels, then Enter the Void is what you would make if <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>got</b> beyond the Roppongi pub-crawl." [...] While the review was largely negative, the author was still {{impressed}} by the visual depiction of the Japanese capital: [...] "Visually, much {{of the film is}} stunning ... and the art design by Marc Caro (Delicatessen) takes Tokyo's love of neon gaudiness to a surreal extreme".|$|E
500|$|Marc Zablotny, {{a writer}} for the Official Nintendo Magazine, {{included}} it in his 2013 wishlist. He used Kirby's Return to Dream Land, a game originally announced in 2005 and released in 2011, to show the possibility that Metroid Dread could still be made. He also stated that he was more interested in what Dread [...] "stood for rather than the specific game itself." [...] Zablotny later included it in a list of the [...] "15 more Nintendo Games <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>got</b> to play" [...] and called {{it one of the most}} infamous examples of a cancelled Nintendo game. Nick Chester from Destructoid criticized Nintendo for its focus on titles such as the Brain Age series as opposed to a 2D Metroid game.|$|E

2500|$|Hughes wanted {{young black}} writers to be {{objective}} about their race, but not to scorn it or flee it. He understood the main points of the Black Power movement of the 1960s, but believed {{that some of the}} younger black writers who supported it were too angry in their work. Hughes's work Panther and the Lash, posthumously published in 1967, was intended to show solidarity with these writers, but with more skill and devoid of the most virulent anger and racial chauvinism some showed toward whites. Hughes continued to have admirers among the larger younger generation of black writers. He often helped writers by offering advice and introducing them to other influential persons in the literature and publishing communities. This latter group, including Alice Walker, whom Hughes discovered, looked upon Hughes as a hero and an example to be emulated within their own work. One of these young black writers (Loften Mitchell) observed of Hughes: [...] "Langston set a tone, a standard of brotherhood and friendship and cooperation, {{for all of us to}} follow. <b>You</b> <b>never</b> <b>got</b> from him, 'I am the Negro writer,' but only 'I am a Negro writer.' He never stopped thinking about the rest of us." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ortmann is most {{remembered for}} his role in the famed 1950 Snow Bowl game against Ohio State, in which he punted 24 times in a {{blizzard}} for 723 yards – still a Michigan record. The weather conditions were so inclement that Michigan punted on first down for its first two plays from scrimmage, after concluding that the best strategy was to keep the slick ball on the other side of the field and in the hands of Ohio State. The strategy worked, as the game's only touchdown was scored after Ortman punted the ball out of bounds at the Ohio State six-yard line, Ohio State was forced to punt from deep in its own territory, and Tony Momsen recovered a blocked punt in the endzone. Ortmann recalled: “You and I would not have gone outside to get the newspaper on a day like that. [...] But here we were, trying to play football.” Michigan did not get a first down and had only 27 yards of total offense, while Ortman was 0 for 8 passing and gained only 9 yards in 10 rushing attempts. The fierce weather conditions stifled both offenses, and the Wolverines managed to win 9-3 on a safety and Momsen's touchdown after the blocked punt. Interviewed about the Snow Bowl in 2006, Ortmann, then retired and living in Savannah, Georgia, recalled: [...] "Twice during the game, playing as the safety, I couldn't see [...] Vic Janowicz and his backfield, the snow was falling so heavily. Tony Momsen was our regular punter and as we were ready to go out, he said, ‘Charlie, I don't feel like punting today, you punt.' I hadn't punted in three months. But the hero of that game was not Chuck Ortmann, it was Carl Kreager, our center. I just put my hands down and the ball was always there. I still remind him every time we talk, 'Carl, <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>got</b> enough credit for that game.' It was so boring. I have a film of the game, and I haven't watched it since, if that tells you something." ...|$|E
