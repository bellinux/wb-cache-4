500|$|Journalist James Poniewozik of Time {{magazine}} commented of {{the episode}} [...] "Silly Love Songs": [...] "It {{was the kind of}} twist Glee can sell, partly {{because of the way the}} characters are established (in retrospect, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> a really strong woman who rejects him is a turn-on for Puck) and because of how well its cast (Ashley Fink has been killing it as Lauren, and sells her confidence and abrasiveness in a way that makes her a person, not an engineered positive-body-image model). And while Glee sometimes stretches to pick on-the-nose song choices, [...] "Fat Bottomed Girls" [...] was just a perfect choice and performance—not just on topic but actually in Puck's musical wheelhouse." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} {{in the rest of}} the world in the first week of February. The title comes as a tangent to the central theme of the album, [...] "the living noise of a metropolis". The cover art is part of A Modern Project by German photographer Rut Blees Luxemburg, famous for her night cityscapes of London and for the cover art of The Streets' Original Pirate Material. The photograph is an aerial image of London's Westway, which shows the road and the adjacent sports pitches lit by the sodium glow of street lamps, and was chosen because the band believed [...] "it was important we captured London breathing". Luxemburg has explained that [...] "in this picture <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> intricately and optimistically public space in the city is shared".|$|E
500|$|On July 11, 2008, Shinoda's second {{public art}} show [...] "Glorious Excess (BORN)" [...] premiered at the Japanese American National Museum in Los Angeles. The show {{included}} nine new pieces, with an exclusive signing on opening night. The show served as part {{one of the}} two-part [...] "Glorious Excess" [...] series, with the second installment [...] "Glorious Excess (DIES)" [...] due at JANM on August 22, 2009. Shinoda commented on the inspiration behind the Glorious Excess series, stating, [...] "It Got {{to a point where}} the pervasiveness of 'celebrity news' concerned me. It seemed like it has jumped out of its niche into places where it doesn't belong. I would be watching the news, and thinking, 'of all the things {{going on in the world}} right now, why are they covering so-and-so's breakup?' It didn't make sense to me. Add to that the fact that I'm supposed to somehow 'belong' to that celebrity group—and I really don't feel like I do in a lot of ways—and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> the topic started to become really interesting to me. The Glorious Excess (BORN) show was my way of diving into those topics, trying to find answers. It follows a central 'celebrity' character, who is filthy rich, slightly violent, and famous without any particular skill or talent." ...|$|E

2500|$|During an {{interview}} with Virtual World News, Alex Chapman of the British law firm Campbell Hooper stated: [...] "Now we’ve spoken with the gambling commission, and they’ve said that MMOGs aren’t {{the reason for the}} , but they won’t say outright, and we’ve asked directly, that they won’t be covered. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> these would be ignored at first, but very soon they could be in trouble. It’s a risk, but a very easy risk to avoid." [...] He suggested that compliance might require MMOGs and related traders to obtain a gambling license, which is not excessively difficult in the EU.|$|E
2500|$|Dozens {{of retired}} and active boxers from Puerto Rico and abroad {{were among those}} who participated in the funeral services. Among them were Félix [...] "Tito" [...] Trinidad, Wilfred Benítez, Wilfredo Gómez, John John Molina, Samuel Serrano, Román [...] "Rocky" [...] Martínez, Juan Manuel López, Nelson Dieppa, Alex [...] "El Nene" [...] Sánchez, Julian Solís, Manny Siaca, and the {{brothers}} McWilliams and McJoe Arroyo. Trinidad was outspoken in praise for his former rival, saying Camacho [...] "put Puerto Rico's flag up high, with a lot of pride like many other champions have done. He was very loved. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> everybody has suffered the loss of this great human being, a great champion." [...] Trinidad regretted the circumstances of the fatal shooting.|$|E
2500|$|The work {{of record}} {{producer}} Phil Spector, who popularized the Wall of Sound, was a focal obsession for Wilson. In the 1960s, Wilson thought of Spector as [...] "the single most influential producer. He's timeless. He makes a milestone whenever {{he goes into}} the studio." [...] Wilson later reflected: [...] "I was unable to really think as a producer up until the time where I really got familiar with Phil Spector's work. That was when I started to design the experience to be a record rather than just a song." [...] Wilson's work is sometimes characterized as avant-garde pop. Critic Michael Hann cites an [...] "extraordinary rush of avant-pop creativity between 1965 and 1967". In the belief of writer Richard Goldstein: [...] " [...] never realized his full potential as a composer. In the light of electronica and minimalism, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> advanced his ideas were, but they remain bursts of inspiration from a mind that couldn't mobilize itself into a whole. This was the major tragedy of rock in the sixties." ...|$|E

Her eyes are big and lively though somewhat protruding, and with a restless look. She is witty and literal, but as a consequence of her age, she sometimes talks of several subjects at the same time. Her manners are regal, and she represents perfectly, and was additionally very polite and toward me very pleasant.|$|R
