[...] Dormer also stated about her departure, [...] "It's the longest time I've ever spent playing a character. I'll always have a little yellow rose after my heart, and I think it was just the right length of time, to be honest.

In a 2007 interview, Beckham said that, [...] "At school whenever the teachers asked, 'What {{do you want to do}} when you're older?' I'd say, 'I want to be a footballer.' And they'd say, 'No, what do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> for a job?' But that was the only thing I ever wanted to do." [...] Beckham's maternal grandfather was Jewish, and Beckham has referred to himself as [...] "half Jewish" [...] and wrote in his autobiography [...] "I've probably had more contact with Judaism than with any other religion". In his book Both Feet on the Ground, he stated that growing up he attended church every week with his parents, because that was the only way he could play football for their team.|$|E

5000|$|McGonigal defines willpower as [...] "the {{ability to}} do what <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> when part of you really doesn’t want to do it", and says that humans {{experience}} conflicts between impulse and self-control in personal and social contexts, giving examples such as: craving for sweet foods, the urge to be sarcastic or complaining, {{and the desire to}} procrastinate. Humans have evolved adaptations to control their instincts and successfully resist impulsive drives, because living in groups requires self-control and this—McGonigal says—means taking the harder option. According to McGonigal, willpower failure or success can spread through a group, because humans tend to mirror the behavior of those they are socially connected with.|$|E
5000|$|Kelly McGonigal defines willpower as [...] "the {{ability to}} do what <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> when part of you really doesn’t want to do it." [...] It {{consists}} of three competing elements: 1) I will - the {{ability to do}} what you need to do; 2) I won’t - the other side of self-control; the inability to resist temptation; and 3) I want - your true want, the ability to remember the big picture of your life. Willpower is a resource that gets depleted, particularly when you are rundown or hungry. However, you may increase your capacity for willpower by engaging in activities such as mindfulness, meditation and exercise and/or by ensuring good nutrition and adequate sleep.|$|E

5000|$|You have {{to plant}} a lot of seeds {{in the spring and}} the summer so you can {{capitalize}} on it. If you have a story that's going to hit in the middle of September, middle of October, what <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is build several things that come off of the story so that it's not just a one-day hit.

On the third day, ideally, you have some additional information you've been holding back that you can feed into it, another round of stories. On the fourth or fifth day you try to hold your candidate back from saying anything, so that eventually, when he does say something about the issue, you get another round of stories.

It helps that he is a dapper dresser too, and good at the rhyming. And if you're going to be inspired by anyone, why not pick the best?

5000|$|Toy {{had always}} wanted to visit Baghdad. She {{described}} the genesis of the first of many solo overland trips in a 1963 newspaper interview: [...] "Her philosophy is that life is gloriously free and, if <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> anything, nothing and no one can stop you. 'I was arguing about this with a group of friends in a London pub ... and I suddenly found myself saying, 'As a matter of fact, I'm off to Bagdad sic in a week or two'." [...] Once committed to the trip, she quickly got together the money to buy a demonstration (i.e. second hand) 1950 80" [...] rag-top Series I Land Rover, which she named Pollyanna, and organised the visas, permits and carnets required. As she already knew Europe from her earlier travels she decided to take a route via North Africa. She set off alone on her journey, starting from Gibraltar (she flew out there from London and had Pollyanna freighted to await her there), some time after Christmas 1950. She crossed the Straits of Gibraltar and followed the Mediterranean coastline of North Africa, travelling through what was then French Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya and Egypt, to Cyprus, then down through Lebanon, Syria and then through Jordan to Iraq. While in Iraq she visited several archaeological sites, including in May 1951 Sir Max Mallowan's excavations at Nimrud where his wife Agatha Christie was helping with processing the finds. The work on the site had just finished, and the finds for that season included the stele of King Assur-nasir-pal II. [...] Her journey home is not described in the book, although in her second book A Fool in the Desert she says that she drove back to England. [...] Toy published an account of her travels in 1955 under the title A Fool on Wheels: Tangier to Baghdad by Land-Rover. The 'Fool on Wheels' title was taken from a dismissive remark by a brigadier she met in Gibraltar at the start of her travels who had told her that she was mad to even think about making the journey. The book was well-received: The Spectator commented [...] "A highly readable book about her solitary journey in a Land Rover from Tangier to Baghdad. A woman of remarkable courage", while The Times said of her [...] "She has a gift for people: she has an eye for places." [...] It is worth noting that Toy's solo journey took place almost five years before the perhaps more celebrated six-man team Oxford and Cambridge Far Eastern Expedition, a London to Singapore overland trip between September 1955 and March 1956 that was also undertaken in Land Rovers.|$|E

40|$|Making {{the central}} bank an agency with the mandate and {{reputation}} for maintaining price stability is {{a means by which}} a government can choose the strength of its commit-ment to price stability. This article develops four measures of central bank indepen-dence and explores their relation with inflation outcomes. An aggregate legal index is developedforfour decades in 72 countries. Three indicators of actual independence are developed: the rate of turnover of central bank governors, an index based on a ques-tionnaire answered by specialists in 23 countries, and an aggregation of the legal index and the rate of turnover. Legal independence is inversely related to inflation in industrial, but not in develop-ing, countries. In developing countries the actual frequency of change of {{the chief executive officer of}} the bank is a better proxy for central bank independence. An inflation-based index of overall central bank independence contributes significantly to explaining cross-country variations in the rate of inflation.

40|$|The package ebezier is an {{extension}} of the (old) bezier. sty which is now part of L ATEX 2 ε. It defines linear and cubic Bernsteĭn polynomials together with some plotting macros for arcs. With the aid of the calc package also the calculation of square roots and henceforward lengths is supplied. Preamble If you want to draw complicated and/or lots of pictures, you should use Post-Script for generating your plots and dvips to include them in TEX documents. PostScript can plot lines with arbitrary slope and unlimited length and circles with arbitrary radius just by using one command. See also the LATEX Graphics Companion[4] for further possibilities. There is also a new package pict 2 e[8] available which is preferrable for PDF and PostScript. This package will support also lines with arbitrary slopes and unlimited length, but each line has to be generated as a sample of points. Each point reduces TEX’s memory and you will very likely have to overcome some TeX capacity excxeeded [...] . messages. Exact circles would involve trigonometric functions or square roots to be evaluated by TEX. Even with some tricks for reducing the effort of the calculation algorithm there would be hundreds of calculations for each point. ∗ But they may be quite well approximated by cubic bezier curves, also supplied in this package (The quality of interpolation is discussed in some detail in the Section Fitting Arcs.) In fact, the small circles in the LATEX-lcircle fonts are also generated by the same method. For draft papers use all kind of bezier curves with small number of points, just for the final run increase the numbers. TEX memory can be set free again ∗ To use TEX for complex computations is as satisfactory as using your desk calculator for writing tasks. But if <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it e. g. the digits 7353 can be read (rotating by 180 0) as ESEL, the german word for “donkey”. 1 with at the end of complicated pictures.
