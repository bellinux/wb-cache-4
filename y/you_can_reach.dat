500|$|According to Spence D. of IGN Music, Beyoncé's vocals on {{the song}} are layered, making them sound like [...] "a harem of Beyoncé's {{warbling}} for the affections of some sultan of swing." [...] According to James Poletti of Yahoo! Music, the female protagonist {{in the song}} sings about her [...] "potential {{to turn on the}} filth." [...] Lyrically, the song is a celebration of sexual lust and conquest, culminating in a desire for a one-night stand. This [...] "lustful sexual confidence" [...] is further demonstrated in the lyrics of the first verse: [...] "I'm feeling sexy / Wa hear you say my name, boy/ If <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>reach</b> me, you can feel my burning flame / Feeling kind of N A S T Y / I might just take you home with me" [...] and the chorus lines: [...] " [...] Tonight I'll be your naughty girl / I'm callin' all my girls / We're gonna turn this party out / I know you want my body." [...] Throughout the song, Beyoncé sings the lines [...] "I'd love to love you, baby" [...] almost whispering as stated by Ed Masley of The Arizona Republic.|$|E
500|$|After {{five years}} of {{substance}} abuse, arrests, rehab, and relapse, Downey was finally ready to work toward a full recovery from drugs {{and a return to}} his career. In discussing his failed attempts to control his own addictive behavior in the past, Downey told Oprah Winfrey in November 2004 that [...] "when someone says, 'I really wonder if maybe I should go to rehab?' Well, uh, you're a wreck, you just lost your job, and your wife left you. Uh, you might want to give it a shot." [...] He added that after his last arrest in April 2001, when he knew he would likely be facing another stint in prison or another form of incarceration such as court-ordered rehab, [...] "I said, 'You know what? I don't think I can continue doing this.' And I reached out for help, and I ran with it. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>reach</b> out for help in kind of a half-assed way and you'll get it and you won't take advantage of it. It's not that difficult to overcome these seemingly ghastly problems...what's hard is to decide to do it." ...|$|E
500|$|The lyrics for [...] "Volcano" [...] {{are written}} from the {{perspective}} of a younger Bono addressing his modern-day self; he said, [...] "It's this young guy going, 'The fuck happened to you?'" [...] The Edge composed the song's bass intro. [...] "Raised by Wolves" [...] is about the Dublin and Monaghan bombings of 1974, which killed 33 people but were narrowly avoided by Bono that day. The song is written {{from the perspective}} of Andy Rowen (brother of Bono's childhood friend Guggi), whose presence at the bombings would later drive him into heroin addiction, a subject also addressed in U2's 1984 song [...] "Bad". [...] "Cedarwood Road" [...] reminisces about the street in Dublin on which Bono lived during his youth. The cherry blossom tree referenced in the lyrics was from the Rowen family garden. [...] "Sleep Like a Baby Tonight", written about a pedophile priest, was described by Qs Tom Doyle as featuring [...] "deceptively lullaby-like... synth pulses" [...] reminiscent of Kraftwerk. Their album The Man-Machine was gifted by Bono to Ali when they were dating as teenagers and is name-checked in [...] "Iris (Hold Me Close)" [...] in the line, [...] "But it was you who made me your man/Machine". [...] "This Is Where <b>You</b> <b>Can</b> <b>Reach</b> Me Now" [...] takes musical cues from one of the group's childhood inspirations, the Clash. According to the liner notes, the song is dedicated to the Clash's guitarist/vocalist Joe Strummer. The closing track, [...] "The Troubles", was described by Bono as [...] "an uncomfortable song about domestic violence".|$|E

2500|$|Swift uses Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) {{to manage}} memory. Apple used to require manual memory {{management}} in Objective-C, but introduced ARC in 2011 {{to allow for}} easier memory allocation and deallocation. One problem with ARC {{is the possibility of}} creating a strong reference cycle, where objects reference each other in a way that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>reach</b> the object you started from by following references (e.g. A references B, B references A). This causes them to become leaked into memory as they are never released. [...] Swift provides the keywords weak and unowned to prevent strong reference cycles. Typically a parent-child relationship would use a strong reference while a child-parent would use either weak reference, where parents and children can be unrelated, or unowned where a child always has a parent, but parent may not have a child. Weak references must be optional variables, since they can change and become nil.|$|E

[...] According to the late poet Stormi Chambless, the hippies buried an effigy of a hippie in the Panhandle to demonstrate the end of his/her reign. [...] Regarding this period of history, the July 7, 1967, TIME magazine featured a cover story entitled, [...] "The Hippies: The Philosophy of a Subculture." [...] The article described the guidelines of the hippie code: [...] "Do your own thing, wherever you have to do it and whenever you want. [...] Drop out. [...] Leave society as you have known it.

2500|$|In June 1967, Herb Caen was {{approached}} by [...] "a distinguished magazine" [...] to write about why hippies were attracted to San Francisco. He declined the assignment but interviewed hippies in the Haight for his own newspaper column in the San Francisco Chronicle. Caen determined that, [...] "Except in their music, they couldn't care less about {{the approval of the}} straight world." [...] Caen himself felt that the city of San Francisco was so straight that it provided a visible contrast with hippie culture. On July 7, Time magazine featured a cover story entitled, [...] "The Hippies: The Philosophy of a Subculture." [...] The article described the guidelines of the hippie code: [...] "Do your own thing, wherever {{you have to do it}} and whenever you want. Drop out. Leave society as you have known it. Leave it utterly. Blow the mind of every straight person <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>reach.</b> Turn them on, if not to drugs, then to beauty, love, honesty, fun." [...] It is estimated that around 100,000 people traveled to San Francisco in the summer of 1967. The media was right behind them, casting a spotlight on the Haight-Ashbury district and popularizing the [...] "hippie" [...] label.
