40|$|The time {{variability}} {{and long}} term trends of PM 2. 5 (particulate matter of diameter < 2. 5 μm) at various regional background (RB) sites across Europe are studied and interpreted in this work. Data on mean annual levels of PM 2. 5 measured at Montseny (MSY, North East Spain) and various RB sites in Spain and Europe are evaluated and compared, and subsequently analysed for statistically significant trends. The MSY site registered higher average PM 2. 5 levels than those measured at a selection of other RB sites across Spain, Portugal, Germany and Scandinavia by percentage compared to the mean of all the stations in these countries, but lower than those measured in Switzerland, Italy and Austria. Reductions in PM 2. 5 were observed across all stations in Spain and Europe to varying degrees (7 – 49 %). MSY underwent a statistically significant reduction since measurements began, indicating a <b>year-on-year</b> gradual <b>decrease</b> (− 3. 7 μg m − 3, calculated from {{the final year of}} data compared to the mean). Similar trends were observed in other RB sites across Spain (− 1. 9 μg m − 3). Reductions recorded in PM 2. 5 across Europe were varied, with many experiencing gradual, <b>year-on-year</b> <b>decreases</b> (− 1. 8 μg m − 3). These reductions have been attributed to various causes: the introduction and implementation of pollution abatement strategies in EU member states, the effect of the current economic crisis on emissions of PM 2. 5 and the influence of meteorology observed during the winters of 2009 and 2010. In addition, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), a large scale meteorological phenomenon most prevalent during winter, was observed to influence the frequency of Saharan dust intrusions across the Iberian Peninsula. Chemical composition of PM 2. 5 at MSY is characterised by high levels of organic matter (OM) and sulphate, followed by crustal material, nitrate and ammonia. Sea Spray and elemental carbon (EC) comprised a minor part of the total PM 2. 5 mass. Statistical trend analysis was performed on the various chemical components of PM 2. 5 recorded at MSY to determine which components were accountable for the decrease in PM 2. 5 concentration. It is shown that OM underwent the largest decrease over the time period with a statistically significant trend (− 1. 3 μg m − 3 compared to the mean), followed by sulphate (− 0. 8 μg m − 3), ammonium (− 0. 5 μg m − 3) and nitrate (− 0. 4 μg m − 3). Conversely, sea spray, EC and crustal material reductions were found to be negligible...|$|R

Introduction Jobs Online measures changes in job vacancies advertised by businesses on the two main internet job boards – SEEK and Trade Me Jobs. The trend series is used as it reduces the month to month volatility. Highlights 	The trend for online job vacancies was down in May. Online vacancies for skilled jobs fell by 2. 7 per cent in May, while all vacancies decrease by 2. 6 per cent. 	Online advertisements for vacancies decreased in all industry groups. The largest decreases were in the accounting, HR, legal and administration and information technology (both down 4. 2 per cent) industries. 	Vacancies fell in all occupation groups. The biggest month-on-month decrease was for professionals (down 3. 3 per cent), while professional workers (down 5. 2 per cent) was the only <b>year-on-year</b> <b>decrease.</b> 	Skilled job vacancies grew modestly in the South Island regions.

30|$|China {{is still}} in the process of {{industrialization}} and urbanization, with a growing economy. According to the “China Electricity Industry Development Annual Report” issued by China Electricity Council (CEC), the national electricity consumption in 2015 has reached 5.55 trillion kWh, with a year-on-year growth rate of 0.5 %. Although the <b>year-on-year</b> growth rate <b>decreases</b> compared with historical records, the demand is expected to continue increasing. As important parts of the energy sector and the major emission source, corporations in electricity sector are primary participants in emission markets [3]. To realize the low-carbon and sustainable power supply systems, power distribution and transmission expansion planning should consider emission constraints [4, 5] and the impact of an ETS, and the design and implementation of an ETS should also consider the development of the power system and the electricity market.|$|R
40|$|A {{new policy}} {{approach}} {{is needed to}} deliver carbon dioxide savings in the UK; this paper proposes carbon rationing for personal energy use. Current policies are extremely unlikely to result in sufficient savings to meet the 2010 national reduction target. Indeed, when international air travel emissions are included, carbon equivalent emissions have not actually fallen since 1990. In the domestic sector, energy efficiency is expected to deliver significant carbon savings, but data from recent decades show {{this to be a}} triumph of hope over experience. Instead carbon rations for personal transport and household energy use are suggested. Rations would be equal, tradable, mandatory and would <b>decrease</b> <b>year-on-year.</b> The aim would be to make guaranteed carbon savings in an egalitarian way. Practical details of rationing are outlined and concerns about its effects are debated. Finally, it is concluded that rationing has great potential to enable the UK, and other countries, to meet their carbon saving targets...|$|R
40|$|Since 2001 it {{has been}} {{mandatory}} for acute hospital Trusts (groups of hospitals under the same management) in England to report all cases of bacteraemia due to Staphylococcus aureus together with information on their susceptibility or resistance to methicillin. This allowed the incidence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) bacteraemia (expressed {{as the number of}} cases per 1000 occupied bed days) to be determined for each Trust. In late 2005, the scheme was enhanced to collect demographic, clinical and epidemiological information on each case using a web-based data collection system. Analysis of this mandatory dataset has provided important information on the trends in MRSA bacteraemia in England and has documented a <b>year-on-year</b> <b>decrease</b> in incidence since 2006, following a government initiative in which Trusts were tasked with halving their MRSA bacteraemia rates over a 3 year period. In addition, the enhanced mandatory surveillance scheme has captured a wealth of data that have helped to further define the epidemiology of MRSA bacter-aemia. It is to be hoped that based on the English experience of mandatory surveillance, other countries will consider the implementation of similar schemes, not only for MRSA but for other pathogens of public health importance...|$|E
40|$|The {{thesis is}} focused on {{evaluation}} of the household consumption development in the Czech Republic in the period 2002 [...] 2011. The objective of this work is to delineate main factors of decision-making of households on savings and on consumption {{in the period of}} economic boom and in the period of economic crisis. It is pointed out that the key determinant of the decision-making were primarily expectations. This factor contributed to a rapid consumer credit growth in the period of economic boom. In the period of economic recession, a considerable worsening of expectations (unemployment, further fiscal policy decisions) led households to gradual precautionary savings despite the <b>year-on-year</b> <b>decrease</b> in growth of nominal disposable income. Moreover, since 2011, the nominal disposable income declined. This analysis also shows that the factor of expectations influenced household behaviour more than the factor of banks' interest rate policy. This fact was notably evident in the recession when commercial banks responded to the change in rates of the Czech National Bank by lowering their consumer credit interest rates in a lesser extent. However, in this uncertain period of prudent stance of both banks and households, the consumer credit growth slowed down, moreover, it decreased in 2011. This piece of knowledge about this important role of expectations in the period of a great uncertainty that results in building up precautionary savings is indicated also by research papers from abroad...|$|E
40|$|In January, {{business}} expectations {{continued to}} improve. According {{to the business}} {{survey conducted by the}} Austrian Institute of Economic Research, production expectations in manufacturing are markedly more optimistic than in the previous quarter: more firms expect an increase rather than a decrease in production during the next few months. The level of orders and the capacity utilization rate are now seen in a more optimistic light. The rise in orders from abroad helped to stabilize the manufacturing sector. Manufacturing output in the fourth quarter exceeded the level of the fourth quarter of 1993 by 1 percent, with the recovery mainly supported by the basic goods industries. For {{the first time since the}} fall of 1992 exports recorded a year-on-year gain (+ 1 ½ percent in the fourth quarter). Losses in exports to Western Europe were more than offset by higher sales to the U. S., South East Asia, China, and Eastern Europe. The decline in imports did not level off in the fourth quarter: the <b>year-on-year</b> <b>decrease</b> of 4 percent implies a persistent weakness in domestic demand, especially for capital goods. In 1993, imports dropped by 4. 8 percent, at a slightly higher rate than exports. As a result, the current account improved by more than AS 8. 5 billion in 1993. The economic recovery in the U. S. accelerated in the fourth quarter with an annual growth rate of 7 ½ percent. In the European Union business confidence improved, but consumer sentiment, particularly in Germany, remained pessimistic. Activity in the manufacturing sector also rebounded in Germany, but the risk is great that, as a result of tax hikes, the cyclical development will take the form of a W. In Austria, consumer demand took a favorable turn at the end of 1993. Retail sales (seasonally adjusted) were flat towards the end of the year. In the construction sector, civil engineering operated close to capacity; private and public non-residential construction also recorded gains. With the incipient recovery of economic activity, the labor market also showed signs of stabilization. In February, unemployment was only slightly higher, employment barely lower than one year ago. According to the OECD definition, the unemployment rate (seasonally adjusted) was 4. 6 percent. It is still unclear to what extent this result is due to special seasonal factors, but if this trend were to continue, the rate of unemployment might be lower than the figure projected for 1994. Vacancy statistics, usually a leading indicator, also mirror the stabilization in the labor market. In February 1994, the number of vacancies was just 10 percent below the level in February 1993. Inflation eased at the beginning of the year; the rate of inflation dropped from 3. 5 percent to 3. 1 percent in January. Price increases of industrial products, food, and private services, particularly in tourism, leveled off. A rise in the gasoline tax and in some public fees at the beginning of 1994, however, stimulated inflation. In contrast to earlier years, public fees increased more sharply than the prices of private services. The question of how much Austria's accession to the EEA has contributed to the dampening of inflation remains to be analyzed in detail. Gains in contractual wages slowed down further. With the new contracts in the public sector and private service sectors becoming effective, the yearly rate of increase dropped from 4. 5 percent in December 1993 to 3. 6 percent in January 1994.

40|$|To {{effectively}} mitigate {{climate change}} in the long-term, limiting carbon dioxide emissions {{at the individual level}} has been proposed. Known as personal carbon allowances, these would be <b>decreased</b> <b>year-on-year.</b> Trading in personal carbon allowances would be encouraged, as a means to effectively and equitably reduce emissions overall. This conceptual paper aims to critically examine personal carbon trading (PCT) by questioning the assumptions underlying this proposal and identifying the gaps in current thinking. The paper first discusses the origin and development of the PCT idea, identifies key players and proponents of the proposal, and examines its economic basis as a market instrument. Drawing on lessons from several related areas of experience (the EU Emissions Trading System, voluntary Carbon Rationing Action Groups, and Complementary Currencies), these are used to examine likely success factors and inform future policy and implementation of PCT. A set of four critical issues are identified, which straddle political, social, economic, environmental, cultural and ethical domains, and which demand greater attention before the PCT idea can be progressed...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{sharp drop in}} {{the price}} of {{off-peak}} wind-energy in prime wind zones presents a major challenge for continued growth of wind-energy. The average price has <b>decreased</b> <b>year-on-year</b> and instances of negative prices have been increasing rapidly. These trends have accelerated as the rate of installed wind energy has increased. Converting the excess off-peak wind energy into storable synthetic liquid fuels – dubbed WindFuelsTM – could (a) generate the off-peak market needed to re-ignite the growth of wind energy, (b) permit complete grid stabilization, and (c) provide a truly sustainable carbon-neutral solution for transportation fuels. Off-peak low-carbon electricity is used to produce H 2. Some of the H 2 is used in a reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reactor to reduce low-cost CO 2 to CO. The CO and the balance of the H 2 are fed into a Fischer Tropsch reactor where the desired fuels are synthesized. Simulations have shown that major advances can be made in many of the key processes and components. With such, the carbon-neutral fuels produced are predicted to be much less carbon intensive and more competitive than advanced biofuels. This should allow the WindFuels process to scale up in tandem with wind energy production, and ensure off-peak demand and grid stability for decades of accelerating growth in wind energy...|$|R
