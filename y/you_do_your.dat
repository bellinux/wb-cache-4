500|$|<b>You</b> <b>Do</b> <b>Your</b> Thing, {{their fourth}} album, was issued in mid-2004. It was led off by [...] "If You Ever Stop Loving Me", which in mid-2004 became Montgomery Gentry's first number 1 single {{on the country}} charts. It was also their biggest hit on the Hot 100, {{reaching}} number 30 there. Following it, the album's title track went to number 22 on the country charts, while [...] "Gone" [...] peaked at number 3 and [...] "Something to Be Proud Of" [...] became their second number 1 single. The song spent two weeks at number 1, thus making it the first single for Columbia Records' Nashville division {{to spend more than}} one week at number 1 since [...] "Daddy's Money" [...] by Ricochet in 1996. [...] "Gone" [...] was also the most-played single by a country music duo in 2005, and it received a digital gold certification for 500,000 certified music downloads. <b>You</b> <b>Do</b> <b>Your</b> Thing became their third platinum-selling album. Scaife, Chancey, Rutherford, Steele, and Mark Wright split production duties on the album. Steele also co-wrote [...] "Gone" [...] and [...] "Something to Be Proud Of" [...] with Bob DiPiero and Chris Wallin, respectively, while Rutherford and DiPiero co-wrote [...] "If You Ever Stop Loving Me" [...] with Tom Shapiro. In October 2005, <b>You</b> <b>Do</b> <b>Your</b> Thing became the duo's third platinum album. Rick Bell gave the album a favorable review on Country Standard Time, saying that the duo [...] "unleash [...] in a torrent of brash lyrics, wailing guitars, and pounding percussion." [...] Jurek wrote that it [...] "is easily the finest outing by modern country's most relevant duo; it rocks, it's soulful, and it's memorable." [...] Montgomery Gentry toured in late 2004 – early 2005 with Trace Adkins in support of the album.|$|E
500|$|Montgomery Gentry {{released}} six studio albums for Columbia Records' Nashville division: Tattoos & Scars (1999), Carrying On (2001), My Town (2002), <b>You</b> <b>Do</b> <b>Your</b> Thing (2004), Some People Change (2006), and Back When I Knew It All (2008), and a Greatest Hits package.

Ten more of their songs reached the top 10 on the country charts, including the number 3 hit [...] "Gone", the most played country song by a duo in 2005. Tattoos & Scars, My Town, and <b>You</b> <b>Do</b> <b>Your</b> Thing are all certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. In 1999, they were awarded Favorite New Artist—Country at the American Music Awards. Both the Academy of Country Music and Country Music Association named them Duo of the Year in 2000, an award for {{which they have been}} nominated by both associations in every year since. In 2009, they were inducted into the Grand Ole Opry.|$|E
500|$|But Eustace Roskill {{cautions}} that [...] "It {{would be wrong}} to judge Stevenson simply by the notoriety of a few cases.... he showed great mercy to those whom he saw to be victims rather than aggressors." [...] In the early 1970s, while conducting training sessions in sentencing for newly appointed recorders, Stevenson summed up his attitude: [...] "You sentence off the top of your head. If the man's a shit, down he goes. If there's {{something to be said for}} him, <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>your</b> best not to put him inside." [...] Despite his stern and authoritarian reputation, in the 1970s he sometimes submitted letters to the Court of Appeal supporting the reduction of his sentences.|$|E

500|$|... "The Cure" [...] {{was written}} after Gaga's {{performance}} at the Super Bowl LI halftime show. Gaga worked with longtime collaborator DJ White Shadow (aka Paul Blair) for the track. He recalled sitting with Gaga and feeling a positive vibe, which led them to write the track described by Blair as [...] "upbeat and cool". Their camaraderie originated due to the [...] "terrible stuff {{going on in the}} world right now, it's like when you're a creative person <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>your</b> best to try and combat evil with creative stuff, so that was kind of the vibe." [...] Gaga and her team wanted to release the [...] "one-off" [...] single as soon as production was completed.|$|E
500|$|The next track [...] "Incredible" [...] {{starts off}} like a love song but reveals itself to be a plea to someone to start over, while {{changing}} its composition from the interlude. According to MTV, the shift in the structure reflected Madonna's own confusion about how she felt about her lover in the song. [...] "Can't get my head around it", she sang. [...] "I, I {{need to think about}} it." [...] "Beat Goes On" [...] featuring West, has a 70s R meeting 80s dance vibe and a rap interlude by West. Williams has commented that Madonna's work ethic was different from other artists that he had worked with before. That is reflected in songs like [...] "Spanish Lesson" [...] where she sings the line [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>your</b> homework/ Baby I will give you more". It also has influences of Spanish music. Groove inspired music is present in [...] "Dance 2Night", which featured Timberlake.|$|E
500|$|The album {{marked a}} {{departure}} in Fall Out Boy's sound {{in which the}} band implemented a diverse array of musical styles. As reported by Billboard, Fall Out Boy [...] "drifts further from its hardcore punk roots to write increasingly accessible pop tunes," [...] a slight departure from the group's previous more pop punk sound. Infinity on High {{has been compared to}} the work of pop punk bands such as Green Day, with Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times commenting, [...] "Whatever snot and feedback courses through these songs, sweetness always triumphs, carried forth by bubblegum bass lines, snappy drums and tunes as comforting as lullabies." [...] Stump explained that the album contains a variety of different moods: [...] "It’s {{one of those things where}} you get older as a band and <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>your</b> own thing...The older Fall Out Boy elements, from the early records, are definitely there, and this album is an extension of that." ...|$|E

500|$|Michael Giacchino, Abrams' most {{frequent}} collaborator, composed {{the music for}} Star Trek. He kept the original theme by Alexander Courage for the end credits, which Abrams said symbolized {{the momentum of the}} crew coming together. Giacchino admitted personal pressure in scoring the film, as [...] "I grew up listening to all of that great [...] music, and that's part of what inspired me to do what I'm doing [...] You just go in scared. You just hope <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>your</b> best. It's {{one of those things where}} the film will tell me what to do." [...] Scoring took place at the Sony Scoring Stage with a 107-piece orchestra and 40-person choir. An erhu, performed by Karen Han, was used for the Vulcan themes. A distorted recording was used for the Romulans. Varèse Sarabande, the record label responsible for releasing albums of Giacchino's previous scores for Alias, Lost, , and Speed Racer, released the soundtrack for the film on May 5. The music for the theatrical trailers were composed by Two Steps from Hell.|$|E
500|$|Some People Change was Montgomery Gentry's lowest-selling album at the time. Joe Galante, then-president of Sony Music Nashville, {{thought that}} the album's poor sales were because it [...] "strayed musically from what the base had been. They have an edge to their sound, and I think {{we got a little}} too soft." [...] Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times gave a mixed review, saying that it was more [...] "touchy-feely" [...] than <b>You</b> <b>Do</b> <b>Your</b> Thing, and that [...] "no one works a snarling country chorus like Montgomery Gentry". Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a [...] "C", criticizing the duo for the {{contradictory}} viewpoints of personal changes on the title track versus the [...] "defense of the American right to piss off your neighbors" [...] in [...] "What Do Ya Think About That". Jurek comparatively called it a [...] "masterpiece" [...] and said that it was [...] "a new pinnacle for the duo", calling the title track [...] "one of those tunes that defines something that {{lies at the heart of}} what is good about Americans." ...|$|E

[...] Additionally, she noted that: [...] "Angelina may {{have a little bit of}} a crush on Kevin and she is not afraid to show it." [...] CBS Soaps In Depth wrote: [...] "viewers definitely can expect Angelina to make her mark in Genoa City." [...] DeGarmo confessed that she never watched daytime soap operas because she was in school, but her family was [...] "super excited" [...] about seeing her on one. Because she never had experience working on soaps, she talked about how fast-paced it was, stating: [...] "I would equate this to guerrilla theater. It’s very fast. <b>You</b> <b>do</b> <b>your</b> presentation and you’re done. It keeps me on my toes. I have to give my best performance at that very moment." [...] She also discussed having crossed over in the genre: [...] "Sometimes being a ‘reality’ person can be a bit of a stigma. ‘The Young and the Restless’ was willing to take a chance on me. They are so fantastic." ...|$|E

500|$|In an interview, {{recording}} engineer Gordon [...] "Commissioner Gordon" [...] Williams recalled {{the recording of}} [...] "Lost Ones", stating: [...] "It was our first morning in Jamaica and I saw all of these kids gathered around Lauryn, screaming and dancing. Lauryn was {{in the living room}} next to the studio with about fifteen Marley grandchildren around her, the children of Ziggy, and Stephen, and Julian, and she starts singing this rap verse, and all the kids start repeating the last word of each line, chiming in very spontaneously because they were so into the song." [...] Columbia Records considered bringing in an outside producer for the album and had early talks with RZA of the Wu-Tang Clan. However, Hill was adamant about writing, arranging, and producing the album herself: [...] "It would have been more difficult to articulate to other people. Hey, it's my album. Who can tell my story better than me?" [...] She recalled Ruffhouse Records executive Chris Swartz ensuring her artistic freedom while recording the album: [...] "I had total control of the album. Chris Swartz at Ruffhouse, my label, said, 'Listen, you've never done anything stupid thus far, so let me let <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>your</b> thing.'" ...|$|E

We pull up, everybody comes out, you shower, then <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>your</b> sound check. Then it's time to get ready. Hair, makeup, that's the fun part." [...] Rihanna then shows her dressing room, makeup artists and costumes. She explains how she loves wearing black on stage because she is [...] "good girl gone bad and black is kind of gothic and rock n' roll". Rihanna explains how she is nervous before the beginning of the show because of the atmosphere where all of her fans are screaming her name. According to her, the beginning of the show is up-tempo and loud, before becoming a little bit [...] "mellow" [...] at the middle of it. The show then gets [...] "on party" [...] again with their techno club set-list. The encore consists of [...] "Question Existing" [...] and [...] "Umbrella". According to Rihanna, [...] "Question Existing" [...] is a very personal song which American singer Ne-Yo wrote [...] "on behalf of entertainers". She concluded that it is very hard for her to call herself a superstar. The Documentary Feature ends with Rihanna announcing that in the end of 2008 she will be hitting the studio again and [...] "she won't be away for too long".|$|E
500|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave a mixed {{review of}} Most Wanted, stating that [...] "hardcore fans will be hard-pressed {{for a reason}} to add this to their collection" [...] and that the new songs—"Wake Up", [...] "Beat of My Heart" [...] and [...] "Break My Heart"—"sound a bit like leftovers". Although he wrote that Most Wanted [...] "isn't a terrible album by any means, it's not {{particularly}} a good one, since Duff's two pop albums [...] have distinctive personalities that don't necessarily mesh together , and are both more fun than this." [...] Bill Lamb of About.com noted that the three new songs [...] "seem to be marking time instead of finding a new direction" [...] but said that [...] " [...] remaining bulk of this collection is strong." [...] Anthony Miccio, from the Baltimore City Paper, wrote that the album [...] "doesn't signify the closure of a brief career" [...] but is [...] "meant to satisfy an audience that won't be offended by the opportunity to buy their favorite songs again and again." [...] He noted that Duff's voice was not strong enough and stated that the [...] "rock tracks are surprisingly sluggish." [...] Talia Kraines of BBC Music commented that [...] "... there isn't enough here to warrant a purchase if you're already the owner of her back catalogue. But if you're after your first taste of Duff-flavoured pop to listen to in the background as <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>your</b> homework, then this album can do no harm." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hill was a Peace Corps {{volunteer}} in Cameroon from 1974 to 1976. Hill credits {{his work with}} the Peace Corps for teaching him his first lessons in diplomacy. As a volunteer, Hill worked with credit unions and when he discovered that one board of directors had stolen 60 percent of their members' money, he reported on the malfeasance to their members, who promptly re-elected them because the board reflected carefully balanced tribal interests and it really did not matter to the members if the board directors ran a good credit union or not. Hill said the lesson was that [...] "When something's happened, it's happened for a reason and <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>your</b> best to understand that reason.

2500|$|His most {{successful}} single as a songwriter is his 2003 song [...] "What Hurts the Most".

Another one of Steele's compositions, Steve Holy's Number One single [...] "Brand New Girlfriend", earned him yet another BMI award in 2006, {{as well as the}} Rascal Flatts hit [...] "My Wish" [...] just as Steele released his album, Hell on Wheels. [...] "What Hurts the Most" [...] would later earn him the Songwriter of the Year and Song of the Year awards from BMI, as well as the Songwriter of the Year award from MusicRow magazine. Steele has since released two other albums, his second greatest hits record [...] "Gold, Platinum, No Chrome, and More Steele" [...] was released in 2007 and his country classics tribute album [...] "Countrypolitan" [...] which was released in 2008. Steele also produced Keith Anderson's two studio albums: 2005's Three Chord Country and American Rock & Roll and 2008's C'mon!, as well as Montgomery Gentry's 2004 album <b>You</b> <b>Do</b> <b>Your</b> Thing and 2006 album Some People Change In 2016 [...] "Chasing Down a Good Time" [...] Steele co-wrote with Anthony Smith by Randy Houser.|$|E

He received numerous entreaties from President Abraham Lincoln, Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton, and General-in-Chief Henry W.

A primary concern of the government was that if Rosecrans continued to sit idly, the Confederates might move units from Bragg's army in an attempt to relieve the pressure that Union Maj. Gen.

Lincoln wrote to Rosecrans, [...] "I would not push you to any rashness, but I am very anxious that <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>your</b> utmost, short of rashness, to keep Bragg from getting lost to help Johnston against Grant." [...] Rosecrans offered the excuse that if he were to start to move against Bragg, then Bragg would likely relocate his entire army to Mississippi and threaten Grant's Vicksburg Campaign even more.
