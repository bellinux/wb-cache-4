In a firmament that eats up artists like popcorn and where chart success is as fleeting as Jessica Simpson's attention span, Madonna remains an inspiring, intimidating beacon of permanence. Her longevity has thrived on her ability to continually reinvent herself by reading the winds of pop culture and taking her cue from there.|$|E
500|$|Although Scott-Heron {{received}} top-billing for the release, Jamie xx worked {{solely on}} the remix project. For We're New Here, he remixed 13 of the original album's 15 songs, including its [...] "interlude" [...] cuts, mixing Scott-Heron's vocal tracks from the original recording sessions over his own beats and instrumentals, rather than the original music. Many of the remixes were created by Jamie xx on his laptop, while on tour with The xx. In a March2010 interview, {{he said that the}} label [...] "gave me the parts and let me do whatever I want, so I've been doing it on my laptop on tour. [...] only using [...] vocals, I'm not using any of the original music from it, which is very freeing". On his intentions for the album's music, he explained in an interview for The Irish Times, [...] "I wanted it to sound like everything I had been listening to in London. I wanted it to sound like something you’d hear on pirate radio. You hear so many different genres, and it’s all so convoluted and mixed-up, but it makes sense when <b>you</b> <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> the station".|$|E
500|$|Wizards & Warriors has {{received}} scant coverage from modern video gaming websites. Video gaming website GamesRadar named the opening {{theme for the}} game as [...] "Game music of the day", noting that the theme [...] "suggests, from the moment <b>you</b> <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> the game, that knights, wizards, goblins {{and who knows what}} else are about to collide in a battle so epic it's destined for a Frazetta painting." [...] JC Fletcher from Joystiq called the game [...] "a simple action-platformer about a guy in thick armor who kicks open treasure chests in order to bribe knights". He also notes the variety of good and bad items such as the [...] "Staff of Power" [...] which inflicts much damage to enemies and conversely the [...] "Cloak of Darkness", which he says [...] "makes Kuros invisible to you but not to enemies". He said that the game has an arcade feel, with unlimited continues, a high-score list, name entry for high scores, and good music. Houston Press Jef Rouner lauded the game's music and animation, and noted its high difficulty level, especially during boss battles. IGN listed Wizards & Warriors at #56 on its [...] "Top 100 NES Games" [...] list, reviewer Sam Claiborn said that the game was inspired by Dungeons & Dragons-type RPGs, but it went further in incorporating action platforming elements along with more traditional RPG elements. Columnist and comedy writer Seanbaby humorously criticized the game for items that did not work as intended, including the [...] "Cloak of Darkness" [...] and the [...] "Boots of Lava Walk".|$|E

6000|$|... "The present {{revolt of}} woman," [...] {{continued}} the Minor Poet, [...] "will be looked back {{upon by the}} historian of the future {{as one of the}} chief factors in our social evolution. The 'home'--the praises of which we still sing, but with gathering misgiving--depended on her willingness to live a life of practical slavery. When Adam delved and Eve span--Adam confining his delving to the space within his own fence, Eve staying her spinning-wheel the instant the family hosiery was complete--then the home rested upon the solid basis of an actual fact. Its foundations were shaken when the man became a citizen and his interests expanded beyond the domestic circle. Since that moment woman alone has supported the institution. Now she, in her turn, is claiming the right to enter the community, to escape from the solitary confinement of the lover's castle. The 'mansions,' with common dining-rooms, reading-rooms, their system of common service, are springing up in every quarter; the house, the villa, is disappearing. The story is the same in every country. The separate dwelling, where it remains, is being absorbed into a system. In America, the experimental laboratory of the future, the houses are warmed from a common furnace. You do not light the fire, <b>you</b> <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> the hot air. Your dinner is brought round to you in a travelling oven. You subscribe for your valet or your lady's maid. Very soon the private establishment, with its staff of unorganised, quarrelling servants, of necessity either over or underworked, will be as extinct as the lake dwelling or the sandstone cave." ...|$|E
