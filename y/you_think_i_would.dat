2500|$|At {{the start}} of the Sylvania 300 at New Hampshire Motor Speedway, Busch's team was delayed in rolling their car to pit road until after the National anthem. During pre-race car {{inspections}} NASCAR had an issue with the rear-end housing being outside of its allowable tolerances. Jamie Little, walking with Busch, asked if he was okay with her asking a question. Busch responded, [...] "Why the fuck do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> be okay, I gotta go get in my car. NASCAR told me I gotta get in my car".|$|E

Fanny, you don't {{understand}} me yet; you don't at all understand, how thoroughly {{from the heart}} I'm speaking--how much in earnest I am; and, so far from flattering you, I am quite as anxious to find fault with you as I am to praise you, could I feel that I had liberty to do so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course it}} is true," [...] said his wife, {{coloring}} a little. [...] "Does <b>thee</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> doubt anything <b>thee</b> told me? If thee had said that Abraham had a Quaker cook, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have believed it." ...|$|R

60|$|Vent. What has my age deserved, that <b>you</b> should <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> abuse {{your ears}} with perjury? If heaven be true, she's false.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> {{leave you}} to get into fresh difficulties? With a {{temperament}} like yours, you're {{not to be trusted}} alone." ...|$|E
6000|$|GUNNER. Do {{you suppose}} I want to stay? Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> breathe this {{polluted}} atmosphere {{a moment longer}} than I could help? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> {{remain an}} instant {{in the company}} of any man whom I {{suspected}} of such baseness as that?" [...] she asked angrily.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Father! Father! Impossible! Cruel! Oh--do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have {{followed}} you hither from Africa, against your own entreaties, to desert you now?' ...|$|R
6000|$|Tommy {{was taken}} aback, but replied, with gentle dignity, [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> Grizel, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> let that make any {{difference}} in my estimate of him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A red coat! <b>I</b> hope <b>you</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> demean {{myself by}} {{entering}} {{the ranks of}} the army? I am a gentleman, Mr. Stiffelkind--I can never--no, I never--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I shall go on, Banks, and {{let them}} take me to join my father in Lancaster jail. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> run away?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sit down," [...] {{she said}} imperiously, [...] "you simple-minded fool! Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> let Charley's opinion {{influence}} {{me in an}} affair of this kind?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'My dear love,' {{said the}} elder lady, as she folded the weeping girl to her bosom, 'do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> harm a hair of his head?' ...|$|E
6000|$|He got up {{and walked}} quickly across the room and back again to the place where she was sitting. [...] "Never mind about that now. You shall know all that in time. Do not ask any {{questions}} about that. If <b>I</b> were <b>you</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> go to bed. You will be better there than up, and this shock will make you sleep." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'She {{thinks we}} have lost the way,' he replied stiffly, 'and she is rather frightened. <b>You</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> send her away all by herself when she is frightened!' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "To these savages, too!" [...] she pursued. [...] "And <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have gone? You can do {{what you}} like with me--but not that, not that!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'He knows I trust him,' said Lucy. 'He knows I'm {{proud to}} trust him. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> cause him the great pain of asking him questions?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{thinks we}} have lost the way," [...] he replied stiffly, [...] "and she is rather frightened. <b>You</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> send her away all by herself when she is frightened!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "MR. Kendricks!" [...] cried Mrs. March, with burlesque severity. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> offer <b>you</b> a heroine who was NOT in society? You {{forget that}} I am from Boston!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You {{can live}} and {{eat and drink}} and go where you wish without being {{dependent}} on any one. If I had your freedom and your means do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> marry for money?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{might be}} as well not to defer the {{arrangement}} too long," [...] said Mr. Riley, quietly, [...] "for Stelling may have propositions from other parties, and <b>I</b> know he <b>would</b> not take {{more than two or}} three boarders, if so many.
