5|$|In {{the figure}} to the right, the enzyme {{produces}} E* {{rapidly in the}} first few seconds of the reaction. The rate then slows as steady state is reached. This rapid burst phase of the reaction measures a single turnover of the enzyme. Consequently, the amount of product released in this burst, shown as the intercept on the <b>y-axis</b> of the graph, also gives the amount of functional enzyme which is present in the assay.|$|E
5|$|Spherical coordinates, {{known as}} {{ecliptic}} longitude and latitude or celestial longitude and latitude, {{are used to}} specify positions of bodies on the celestial sphere {{with respect to the}} ecliptic. Longitude is measured positively eastward 0° to 360° along the ecliptic from the vernal equinox, the same direction in which the Sun appears to move. Latitude is measured perpendicular to the ecliptic, to +90° northward or -90° southward to the poles of the ecliptic, the ecliptic itself being 0° latitude. For a complete spherical position, a distance parameter is also necessary. Different distance units are used for different objects. Within the Solar System, astronomical units are used, and for objects near Earth, Earth radii or kilometers are used. A corresponding right-handed rectangular coordinate system is also used occasionally; the x-axis is directed toward the vernal equinox, the <b>y-axis</b> 90° to the east, and the z-axis toward the north ecliptic pole; the astronomical unit is the unit of measure. Symbols for ecliptic coordinates are somewhat standardized; see the table.|$|E
5|$|The game spans six levels, each lasting {{about five}} minutes, {{with a variety}} of boss battles. Over the course of the game, the plot is {{revealed}} through cutscenes using the game's own graphic engine. Gameplay consists of a player controlling a flying dragon and his rider through an aiming reticle that can be moved over the whole screen with the D-pad; the player must shoot a variety of enemies (ranging from machines to monsters) in a 3D post-apocalyptic fantasy environment of barren landscapes and mysterious ruins of a fallen civilization. Progression through the levels is made at a predetermined pace, as the player is constantly set along a rail of gameplay. The only time the game pauses is during boss battles. The field of vision can be directed with the aiming reticle on the x and <b>y-axis,</b> but the overall direction of travel is predetermined. The dragon follows the reticle movements, allowing the player to avoid enemy projectiles and obstacles.|$|E
5|$|Durkheim {{believed}} {{there was more to}} suicide than extremely personal individual life circumstances: for example, a loss of a job, divorce, or bankruptcy. Instead, he took suicide and explained it as a social fact instead of a result of one’s circumstances. Durkheim believed that suicide was an instance of social deviance. Social deviance being any transgression of socially established norms. He created a normative theory of suicide focusing on the conditions of group life. The four different types of suicide that he proposed are egoistic, altruistic, anomic, and fatalistic. He began by plotting social regulation on the x-axis of his chart, and social integration on the <b>y-axis.</b> Egoistic suicide corresponds to a low level of social integration. When one is not well integrated into a social group it can lead to a feeling that he or she has not made a difference in anyone’s lives. On the other hand, too much social integration would be altruistic suicide. This occurs when a group dominates the life of an individual to a degree where they feel meaningless to society. Anomic suicide occurs when one has an insufficient amount of social regulation. This stems from the sociological term anomie meaning a sense of aimlessness or despair that arises from the inability to reasonably expect life to be predictable. Lastly, there is fatalistic suicide, which results from too much social regulation. An example of this would be when one follows the same routine day after day. This leads to he or she believing there is nothing good to look forward to. Durkheim suggested this was the most popular form of suicide for prisoners.|$|E
25|$|Geometrically speaking, {{the graph}} {{face of an}} even {{function}} is symmetric {{with respect to the}} <b>y-axis,</b> meaning that its graph remains unchanged after reflection about the <b>y-axis.</b>|$|E
25|$|The range {{signal was}} {{received}} {{on a single}} half-wave dipole mounted at {{the middle of the}} horizontal antenna array, fed into a four-tube RF receiver, and then into a four-tube intermediate frequency (IF) system. The output was fed directly into the lower <b>Y-axis</b> plate of one of the two CRTs. The upper plate on the <b>Y-axis</b> was fed the output of a calibrator, allowing it to be adjusted so the beam was centred vertically. Signals being received from the antenna would thus cause the beam to deflect downward to produce a blip, {{as in the case of}} Chain Home.|$|E
25|$|Computer {{graphics}} and image processing, however, often use a coordinate {{system with the}} <b>y-axis</b> oriented downwards on the computer display. This convention developed in the 1960s (or earlier) from the way that images were originally stored in display buffers.|$|E
25|$|Other {{types of}} mass {{spectrometry}} data are well {{represented as a}} three-dimensional contour map. In this form, the mass-to-charge, m/z is on the x-axis, intensity the <b>y-axis,</b> and an additional experimental parameter, such as time, is recorded on the z-axis.|$|E
25|$|Professional seismic {{observatories}} {{usually have}} instruments measuring three axes: north-south (<b>y-axis),</b> east-west (x-axis), and the vertical (z-axis). If only one axis is measured, {{this is usually}} the vertical because it is less noisy and gives better records of some seismic waves.|$|E
25|$|A {{commonly}} used mnemonic for defining the positive orientation {{is the right}} hand rule. Placing a somewhat closed right hand on the plane with the thumb pointing up, the fingers point from the x-axis to the <b>y-axis,</b> in a positively oriented coordinate system.|$|E
25|$|It may {{be found}} {{interesting}} that the specific speed coefficient {{may be used in}} place of speed to define the <b>y-axis</b> of Figure 1.2, while at the same time, the specific diameter coefficient may be in place of diameter to define the z-axis.|$|E
25|$|For ease of {{measuring}} the amplitudes and intervals, an EKG is printed on graph paper at a standard scale: each 1nbsp&mm (one small {{box on the}} standard EKG paper) represents 40 milliseconds {{of time on the}} x-axis, and 0.1 millivolts on the <b>y-axis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Also in January 2014, MakerBot {{released}} the Replicator Mini with a build volume of 10.0cm x 10.0cm x 12.5cm (3.9″ x 3.9″ x 4.9″ L/W/H), layer resolution of 200 µm, and a positioning precision of 11µm on the x and <b>y-axis</b> and 2.5µm in the z-axis.|$|E
25|$|As {{with all}} {{practical}} instruments, oscilloscopes {{do not respond}} equally to all possible input frequencies. The range of frequencies an oscilloscope can usefully display {{is referred to as}} its bandwidth. Bandwidth applies primarily to the <b>Y-axis,</b> although the X-axis sweeps have to be fast enough to show the highest-frequency waveforms.|$|E
25|$|Plotted on the x-axis is the {{retention}} time and plotted on the <b>y-axis</b> a signal (for example obtained by a spectrophotometer, mass spectrometer or {{a variety of}} other detectors) corresponding to the response created by the analytes exiting the system. In the case of an optimal system the signal is proportional to the concentration of the specific analyte separated.|$|E
25|$|Response correspondences for all 2x2 {{normal form}} games {{can be drawn}} with a line for each player in a unit square {{strategy}} space. Figures 1 to 3 graphs the best response correspondences for the stag hunt game. The dotted line in Figure 1 shows the optimal probability that player Y plays 'Stag' (in the <b>y-axis),</b> {{as a function of}} the probability that player X plays Stag (shown in the x-axis). In Figure 2 the dotted line shows the optimal probability that player X plays 'Stag' (shown in the x-axis), {{as a function of the}} probability that player Y plays Stag (shown in the <b>y-axis).</b> Note that Figure 2 plots the independent and response variables in the opposite axes to those normally used, so that it may be superimposed onto the previous graph, to show the Nash equilibria at the points where the two player's best responses agree in Figure 3.|$|E
25|$|For various formulaic purposes, {{physicists}} divide rotation {{into three}} components, assigning portions to x, y and z axis that are mutually perpendicular. For bowling, the x-axis {{can be assigned}} to a line that {{is parallel to the}} foul line, the <b>y-axis</b> to the line parallel to the boards, and the z-axis to the vertical. Forward-roll is rotation about the x-axis, side-roll is rotation about the <b>y-axis</b> and mid-roll (or spin) is rotation about the z-axis. The pure full-roller delivery is a combination of forward- and side-roll only. Semi-rollers include spin. Spinners may have very little side roll. In a very strict physics sense, a ball may be delivered with rotation, but usually not in a roll, because that would imply complete traction. The technique of the great majority of bowlers involves a delivery that starts the ball in a skid that evolves into a roll that hooks into the pins.|$|E
25|$|In mathematics, {{the complex}} plane or z-plane is a {{geometric}} {{representation of the}} complex numbers established by the real axis and the perpendicular imaginary axis. It {{can be thought of}} as a modified Cartesian plane, with the real part of a complex number represented by a displacement along the x-axis, and the imaginary part by a displacement along the <b>y-axis.</b>|$|E
25|$|FPSs {{naturally}} {{lend themselves}} to separate and simultaneous control of the player's movement and aim, and on computers this has traditionally been achieved {{with a combination of}} keyboard and mouse. Players use the X-axis of the mouse for looking (or turning) left and right, and the <b>Y-axis</b> for looking up and down; the keyboard is used for movement and supplemental inputs.|$|E
25|$|One method Tufte {{encourages}} {{to allow}} quick visual comparison of multiple series {{is the small}} multiple, a chart with many series shown on {{a single pair of}} axes that can often be easier to read when displayed as several separate pairs of axes placed next to each other. He suggests this is particularly helpful when the series are measured on quite different vertical (<b>y-axis)</b> scales, but over the same range on the horizontal x-axis (usually time).|$|E
25|$|The {{potential}} transmembrane {{portions of}} a protein {{can be detected}} by hydropathy analysis. A hydropathy analysis uses an algorithm that quantifies the hydrophobic character at each position along the polypeptide chain. One of the accepted hydropathy scales is that of Kyte and Doolittle which relies on the generation of hydropathy plots. In these plots, the negative numbers represent hydrophilic regions and the positive numbers represent hydrophobic regions on the <b>y-axis.</b> A potential transmembrane domain is about 20 amino acids long on the x-axis.|$|E
25|$|This is {{a special}} case of the {{standard}} form where A = 1 and B = 0. The graph is a vertical line with x-intercept equal to a. The slope is undefined. There is no y-intercept, unless a = 0, {{in which case the}} graph of the line is the <b>y-axis,</b> and so every real number is a y-intercept. This is the only type of straight line which is not the graph of a function (it obviously fails the vertical line test).|$|E
25|$|Knowing {{the points}} of {{intersection}} of a curve with a given line is frequently useful. The intersection with the axes of coordinates and the asymptotes are useful to draw the curve. Intersecting with a line parallel to the axes allows one to find at least a point in each branch of the curve. If an efficient root-finding algorithm is available, this allows to draw the curve by plotting the intersection point with all the lines parallel to the <b>y-axis</b> and passing through each pixel on the x-axis.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the GL/EL display, the Mk. II used {{a single}} {{receiver}} for {{each pair of}} antennas. The switch rapidly alternated {{one or the other}} signal into the receiver. It also sent one of the signals through a short delay line. It did not, however, move the <b>Y-axis</b> baseline. The result was a single trace along the center of the display, with two slightly separated blips, one from each antenna. By comparing the relative lengths of the two blips, the operator could determine which antenna was more closely aligned with the target, and continue to rotate it until the blips were equal length.|$|E
25|$|Turbomachinery analysts gain {{tremendous}} {{insight into}} performance by comparisons of these 5 parameters with efficiencies and loss coefficients {{which are also}} dimensionless. In general application, the flow coefficient and head coefficient are considered of primary importance. Generally, for centrifugal compressors, the velocity coefficient is of secondary importance while the Reynolds coefficient is of tertiary importance. In contrast, as expected for pumps, the Reynolds number becomes of secondary importance and the velocity coefficient almost irrelevant. It may be found interesting that the speed coefficient may be chosen to define the <b>y-axis</b> of Figure 1.1, {{while at the same}} time the Reynolds coefficient may be chosen to define the z-axis.|$|E
25|$|Raster hydrographs are pixel-based plots for {{visualizing}} {{and identifying}} variations {{and changes in}} large multidimensional data sets. Originally developed by Keim (2000) they were first applied in hydrology by Koehler (2004) {{as a means of}} highlighting inter-annual and intra-annual changes in streamflow. The raster hydrographs in WaterWatch, like those developed by Koehler, depict years on the <b>y-axis</b> and days along the x-axis. Users can choose to plot streamflow (actual values or log values), streamflow percentile, or streamflow class (from 1, for low flow, to 7 for high flow), for Daily, 7-Day, 14-Day, and 28-Day streamflow. For a more comprehensive description of raster hydrographs, see Strandhagen et al. (2006).|$|E
25|$|To {{complete}} the system, an electronic switch was added that was timed to the 50Hz signal of the National Grid. The signal {{was used to}} switch the input to the receivers from the range antenna, to output {{of the other two}} antennas mixed through the radiogoniometer. The same signal also adjusted the <b>Y-axis</b> bias of the CRT slightly, so that alternate traces appeared above or below the center of a new CRT dedicated for elevation measurements. The result was that the upper trace contained the original range signal as before, while the lower trace contained the radiogoniometer output; by looking along the lower trace under the range blip, the operator could turn the radiogoniometer until the signal reached a null, revealing the angle. The operator would periodically adjust the setting as the lower blip re-appeared while the target moved.|$|E
25|$|Temporal {{filtering}} is {{the removal}} of frequencies of no interest from the signal. A voxel's intensity change over time can be represented as the sum {{of a number of}} different repeating waves with differing periods and heights. A plot with these periods on the x-axis and the heights on the <b>y-axis</b> is called a power spectrum, and this plot is created with the Fourier transform technique. Temporal filtering amounts to removing the periodic waves not of interest to us from the power spectrum, and then summing the waves back again, using the inverse Fourier transform to create a new timecourse for the voxel. A high-pass filter removes the lower frequencies, and the lowest frequency that can be identified with this technique is the reciprocal of twice the TR. A low-pass filter removes the higher frequencies, while a band-pass filter removes all frequencies except the particular range of interest.|$|E
25|$|A trade liberalization-versus-inequality graph has a {{measures}} trade openness {{along the}} x-axis and inequality along the <b>y-axis.</b> Dobson and Ramlogan determine trade openness by {{the ratio of}} exports and imports (the total trade) and the average tariff rate; inequality is determined by gross primary school enrolment rates, the share of agriculture in total output, the rate of inflation, and cumulative privatization. By studying data from several Latin American countries that have implemented trade liberalization policies in the past 30 years, the Kuznets curve seems {{to apply to the}} relationship between trade liberalization and inequality (measured by the GINI coefficient). However, many of these nations saw a shift from low-skill labour production to natural resource intensive activities. This shift would not benefit low-skill workers as much. So although their evidence seems to support the Kuznets theory in relation to trade liberalization, Dobson and Ramlogan assert that policies for redistribution must be simultaneously implemented in order to mitigate the initial increase in inequality felt.|$|E
500|$|The {{effects of}} {{different}} types of reversible enzyme inhibitors on enzymatic activity can be visualized using graphical representations of the Michaelis–Menten equation, such as Lineweaver–Burk and Eadie-Hofstee plots. For example, in the Lineweaver–Burk plots at the right, the competitive inhibition lines intersect on the <b>y-axis,</b> illustrating that such inhibitors do not affect Vmax. [...] Similarly, the non-competitive inhibition lines intersect on the x-axis, showing these inhibitors do not affect Km. However, {{it can be difficult to}} estimate Ki and Ki' accurately from such plots, so it is advisable to estimate these constants using more reliable nonlinear regression methods, as described above.|$|E
500|$|From a {{macroeconomic}} perspective, the PPF {{illustrates the}} production possibilities {{available to a}} nation or economy during a given period of time for broad categories of output. It is traditionally used to show the movement between committing all funds to consumption on the <b>y-axis</b> versus investment on the x-axis. [...] However, an economy may achieve productive efficiency without necessarily being allocatively efficient. Market failure (such as imperfect competition or externalities) and some institutions of social decision-making (such as government and tradition) {{may lead to the}} wrong combination of goods being produced (hence the wrong mix of resources being allocated between producing the two goods) compared to what consumers would prefer, given what is feasible on the PPF.|$|E
500|$|The graph of {{the delta}} {{function}} is usually thought of as following the whole x-axis and the positive <b>y-axis.</b> [...] The Dirac delta is used to model a tall narrow spike function (an impulse), and other similar abstractions such as a point charge, point mass or electron point. For example, to calculate the dynamics of a billiard ball being struck, one can approximate {{the force of the}} impact by a delta function. [...] In doing so, one not only simplifies the equations, but one also is able to calculate the motion of the ball by only considering the total impulse of the collision without a detailed model of all of the elastic energy transfer at subatomic levels (for instance).|$|E
500|$|For the game, Crash Bandicoot co-creator Andy Gavin {{programmed}} a {{new engine}} named [...] "Game-Oriented Object LISP 2" [...] (GOOL 2); being three {{times faster than}} the previous game's engine, it could handle ten times the animation frames and twice the polygon count. Crash Bandicoot - Time Line ] |publisher=Naughty Dog |accessdate=March 10, 2010}} A flat plane z-buffer was created for the game; because the water surfaces and mud in the jungle had to be a flat plane and be exactly flat on the <b>Y-axis,</b> there could be no waves and the subdividing plane could not be at an odd angle. The effect only worked on objects in the foreground and was only used on Crash, some enemies and a few boxes at the same time.|$|E
500|$|Without loss of generality, we may {{eliminate}} the normal rotational symmetry by choosing the Cartesian coordinates {{such that the}} z-axis is aligned with the angular momentum vector L and the momentum hodographs are aligned {{as they are in}} Figure 7, with the centers of the circles on the <b>y-axis.</b> [...] Since the motion is planar, and p and L are perpendicular, pz = η'z = 0 and attention may be restricted to the three-dimensional vector [...] [...] The family of Apollonian circles of momentum hodographs (Figure 7) correspond to a family of great circles on the three-dimensional [...] sphere, all of which intersect the η'x-axis at the two foci , corresponding to the momentum hodograph foci at px = ±p0. [...] These great circles are related by a simple rotation about the η'x-axis (Figure 8). [...] This rotational symmetry transforms all the orbits of the same energy into one another; however, such a rotation is orthogonal to the usual three-dimensional rotations, since it transforms the fourth dimension η'w. [...] This higher symmetry is characteristic of the Kepler problem and corresponds to the conservation of the LRL vector.|$|E
2500|$|The {{usual way}} of {{orienting}} the axes, with the positive x-axis pointing {{right and the}} positive <b>y-axis</b> pointing up (and the x-axis being the [...] "first" [...] and the <b>y-axis</b> the [...] "second" [...] axis) is considered the positive or standard orientation, also called the right-handed orientation.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{two-dimensional}} Cartesian coordinate system, an angle is typically defined by its two sides, with its vertex at the origin. The initial side {{is on the}} positive x-axis, while the other side or terminal side {{is defined by the}} measure from the initial side in radians, degrees, or turns. With positive angles representing rotations toward the positive <b>y-axis</b> and negative angles representing rotations toward the negative <b>y-axis.</b> [...] When Cartesian coordinates are represented by standard position, defined by the x-axis rightward and the <b>y-axis</b> upward, positive rotations are anticlockwise and negative rotations are clockwise.|$|E
