500|$|... "Beat of My Drum" [...] was {{acclaimed}} {{by music}} critics. Robert Copsey for Digital Spy gave the song {{five out of}} five stars, saying that [...] "Once named the least desirable member of Girls Aloud, the transformation of Nicola Roberts from pasty and awkward backing singer into glowing, haute couture pop songstress has been a magnificent spectacle." [...] Jeff Benjamin of Billboard called Roberts' effort the most [...] "intriguing" [...] {{out of all the}} Girls Aloud solo efforts. He said that Roberts had potential for success in the United States, comparing the song to the work of such artists as M.I.A., Robyn and Kelis. He asked readers to imagine that [...] "a young M.I.A. – mixed with Robyn and band Yelle – went on a shopping spree to Urban Outfitters, started chanting [...] "L! O! V! E!" [...] and turned it all into a true summer anthem." [...] A writer from Popjustice noted that [...] "Beat of My Drum" [...] "hardly happened by accident" [...] but that [...] "it feels really carefree and spontaneous", explaining [...] "what we mean by that is that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> lot of care and attention has gone into it".|$|E
500|$|... "Siempre Tú" [...] was {{composed}} by Muñiz in Los Angeles {{along with its}} producers Nico Stadi and Mike Green. It was recorded {{in the same city}} at the Pulse Music Group Studios. The idea of the song came to Muñiz after he started to say phrases [...] "like when you think about your girlfriend" [...] accompanied by a piano and an electric guitar. In an interview, the singer stated, [...] "I feel that it is a very Californian song [...] because it is a more proactive and current pop, and the fact that Alexandra Stan recorded a part of the song moved me a lot". On another occasion, he added, [...] "We wanted to do a song with which <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> person that you miss her, that you are always thinking about her and longing to be with her. This was the idea of the track". Stan and Muñiz were linked by producer Gabriel Huiban, who previously worked with the latter. [...] "Siempre Tú" [...] was released worldwide on 21 April 2017 through Warner Music Mexico. The accompanying cover artwork shows Muñiz sitting on a chair looking off in the far distance against a backdrop of a street with tall buildings.|$|E

His father, a lawyer, and mother, a unionized teacher with a blue-collar background, held liberal values and taught him to abide by the Golden Rule. His father had pledged to a mostly black {{fraternity}} in the early 1960s in support of the civil rights movement, and his mother took him to [...] "U.S. Out of Central America" [...] meetings at her Unitarian church. They also instilled the belief [...] "that everyone is equal and you can be anything you want to be", which Rolf now considers [...] "either the most naive or dishonest thing <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> child". He had a comfortable upbringing, once recalling, [...] "We had a brick ranch home and a sandbox in the backyard. We had a station wagon. For vacation, throw the kids in the back seat, stay in the Best Western on the way to Disneyland. It was a sitcom, stereotype life." ...|$|E

She is a human poppy, her fuzzy dark hair is like a poppy's lustreless black heart, she has a poppy's tantalising attraction and repulsion, something fatal, or rather fateful.

6000|$|... 'Yes, {{it was one}} of {{the main}} {{difficulties}} about piloting. It was so hard to tell anything about the water; the damned things shift around so--never lie still five minutes at a time. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> wind-reef, straight off, by the look of it; <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> break; <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> sand-reef--that's all easy; but an alligator reef doesn't show up, worth anything. Nine times in ten you can't tell where the water is; and when you do see where it is, like as not it ain't there when YOU get there, the devils have swapped around so, meantime. Of course there were some few pilots that could judge of alligator water nearly as well as they could of any other kind, but they had to have natural talent for it; it wasn't a thing a body could learn, you had to be born with it. Let me see: there was Ben Thornburg, and Beck Jolly, and Squire Bell, and Horace Bixby, and Major Downing, and John Stevenson, and Billy Gordon, and Jim Brady, and George Ealer, and Billy Youngblood--all A 1 alligator pilots. THEY could tell alligator water as far as another Christian could tell whiskey. Read it?--Ah, COULDN'T they, though! I only wish I had as many dollars as they could read alligator water a mile and a half off. Yes, and it paid them to do it, too. A good alligator pilot could always get fifteen hundred dollars a month. Nights, other people had to lay up for alligators, but those fellows never laid up for alligators; they never laid up for anything but fog. They could SMELL the best alligator water it was said; I don't know whether it was so or not, and I think a body's got his hands full enough if he sticks to just what he knows himself, without going around backing up other people's say-so's, though there's a plenty that ain't backward about doing it, as long as they can roust out something wonderful to tell. Which is not the style of Robert Styles, by as much as three fathom--maybe quarter-LESS.' ...|$|E

Of course the jackets for the fellows under the Upper 'Shell' are all right, but one cannot go on wearing jackets higher than that; still, I do think they might let us wear cutaways; tail-coats were all right when every one else wore tail-coats, but in our days it is absurd to wear a coat which nobody else wears except for an evening dress. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> fellow a mile off as a Westminster boy by his coat." ...|$|E
