Things {{have returned to}} normal, if not better than normal", which is when Punisher is introduced, who makes Matt Murdock [...] "question everything.

Jeph Loeb, head of Marvel Television, said that [...] "if season one was really about Matt’s decision to become a hero, then season two really became about what is {{it to be a}} hero."

On Elektra in particular, Loeb said that she has a very clear, self-motivated agenda, and she challenges Murdock's own agenda and [...] "quest for justice.

500|$|The album, {{released}} {{on the same}} day in both the UK and US, failed to chart in the UK, but peaked at number 10 in the US. It was released to quash any bootleg versions that Lennon was sure would leak onto the market. US editions of the album wrongly stated that the album was recorded in England. The album came with a 13-month calendar that had photos, poems and songs in it, from Lennon's In His Own Write and A Spaniard in the Works, and Ono's Grapefruit books. In the US, Capitol was reluctant at first to issue the album, after the commercial failures of their Lennon's and Ono's experimental albums. Lennon recalled in an interview in December 1980 that he had to persuade Capitol to distribute the album: [...] "They said 'This is garbage, we're not going to put it out with her screaming on one side and <b>you</b> <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> sort of live stuff.' And they refused to put it out. But we finally persuaded them that... people might buy this." [...] In an interview with Rolling Stone, Lennon said that Capitol [...] "were on the [...] McCartney bandwagon, which they were on, and they thought that I was just an idiot pissing about with a Japanese broad and the music we were making, like Toronto, they didn't want to put out, because they didn't like that." ...|$|E
500|$|Pearl Jam {{promoted}} the album with tours in Oceania and North America in 1998. Both {{were met with}} financial success, and the Australian shows in Melbourne sold out in just 17 minutes. After finishing the Australian concerts, Irons left the band due to dissatisfaction with touring. Pearl Jam's sound engineer Brett Eliason stated, [...] "We went and did Hawaii and Australia with Jack. When we came back, Jack wasn't {{in a position to}} carry on. He made that decision more or less by himself. He can be a really great drummer but he had difficulty on tour putting out the energy for the length of shows they were doing. I don't know if he thought they'd put things on hold for him." [...] He was replaced on an initially temporary basis with former Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron. Cameron said, [...] "I got a phone call out of the blue, from Mr. Ed Ved, Stoney and Kelly. I was ambushed. It was really short notice. He called and said 'hey what are <b>you</b> <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> summer?'" [...] Cameron learned over 80 songs in two weeks. [...] Regarding his entrance, Cameron stated that [...] "The guys made me feel real welcome and it wasn't a struggle to get it musically, but my style was a little bit different, I think, than what they were used to. And they've been through so many different drummers, I don't even know if they knew what they wanted. So, I just kind of played the way I played and then eventually we kind of figured out what worked best for the band." ...|$|E
