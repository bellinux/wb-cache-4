500|$|... "Watch n' Learn" [...] {{was written}} by Priscilla Renea, Chauncey Hollis, Rihanna and Alja Jackson. The {{production}} of the song was helmed by Hollis under his stage-name Hit-Boy. Hollis had previously worked with music artists like Lil Wayne, The Throne, Eminem and Jennifer Lopez. [...] "Watch n' Learn" [...] wasn't originally meant for any particular artist when Hit-Boy started to work on it. In an interview with Jocelyn Vena from MTV News he explained: [...] "I was at the studio with this amazing [...] Priscilla Renea, and I {{was going to tell}} her to go home, but I was like, 'Stay here and see if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> up with an idea for this '". Renea previously penned Rihanna's 2011 single [...] "California King Bed" [...] (Loud, 2010). Hollis further explained that by the time he left the studio and came home, Renea already sent him the idea and concept for the song through IChat. He was eventually satisfied with it and sent the song to Rihanna, in which her team [...] "went crazy" [...] when they heard it. [...] Rihanna then recorded the song for inclusion on her sixth studio album Talk That Talk (2011).|$|E
2500|$|The film officially began {{principal}} {{photography in}} March 2010, {{but due to}} its large cast, producer/director Farrelly told Entertainment Weekly that [...] "This movie was made over four years, and they just {{had to wait for}} a year or two years for different actors. They would shoot for a week, and shut down for several months. Same thing with the directors. It was the type of movie <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> back to." [...] Shortly before shooting, writers Parker, Stone, and the Zuckers backed out.|$|E

2500|$|The {{trial began}} on 14 April 2008 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, with Rowling testifying {{on day one}} and Vander Ark testifying on day two. During her testimony, Rowling reiterated her claim that the Lexicon {{contained}} minimal commentary and merely recycled her writing, adding nothing other than [...] "facetious asides and etymologies of the easiest kind." [...] Rowling referred to the Lexicon as [...] "wholesale theft of 17 years of my hard work", and criticized it as [...] "sloppy" [...] and characterized by [...] "very little research". In sometimes emotional testimony, Rowling recalled beginning the Potter books when she was an impoverished 25-year-old single mother, nearly coming to tears when saying, [...] "These characters continue to mean {{so much to me}} {{over a long period of}} time. The closest <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> is to say, 'How do you feel about your children?'" [...] Rowling also revealed that the lawsuit has [...] "decimated her creative work" [...] over the prior month, causing her to cease work on a new novel. In his testimony, Vander Ark said that he too had had reserves about publishing the encyclopedia and that the publishing company had talked him into it. [...] "It's been difficult because there has been a lot of criticism, obviously, and that was never the intention. ... This has been an important part of my life for the last nine years or so," [...] he said.|$|E

6000|$|... "My dear child," [...] she said, [...] "you {{have been}} asleep and dreamed these foolish things; or if not, these yokels to whom {{you have been}} {{listening}} are mad. What harm do <b>you</b> suppose <b>could</b> <b>come</b> to Lord Ronald here?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think thee was a {{great deal}} better off in the gardens of Maria Edgeworth," [...] said Mrs. Crowder, [...] "for there <b>thee</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> and go as thee pleased, and it almost makes my flesh creep when I think of thee living in company with the bloody tyrants of the past. And always in poverty and suffering, as if thee {{had been one of the}} common people, and not the {{superior}} of every man around thee! I don't want to hear anything more about the wicked Nebuchadnezzar. How long did thee stay with Maria Edgeworth?" ...|$|R
6000|$|She went on, eagerly: [...] "I wish <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> to believe. Your {{sister said}} {{your mother and}} your uncle spoke last night. Why can't you accept the faith?" ...|$|E

60|$|Lau.

6000|$|... "I'm afraid you're {{letting your}} {{imagination}} {{run away with}} <b>you.</b> What harm <b>could</b> <b>come</b> to either of them through me? But we'll say no more about it, just now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Will you dine with me to-morrow night?" [...] {{he begged}} eagerly. [...] "In the {{afternoon}} I have committee meetings. Thursday afternoon <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> {{down to the}} House, if you cared to." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm so glad <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> to my party. Oh, I {{must speak}} to you about----Do you suppose you would ever get very, very angry at poor me? Me so bad sometimes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I didn't mean to {{have you}} miss the first night. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> back for that. If you stay we will be glad of any {{suggestion}} at any time--won't we, Hugh?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't {{like to lose}} you, but I {{think you}} are right. Your {{beginning}} with me was a mistake.
