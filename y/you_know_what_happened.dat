But my master never suspected you (for reasons which he kept to himself) of making use of the boat. I reminded him that one of us had better have an eye on the slip of pathway, between the cottage and the river. This led to his sending me to the boathouse--and <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> afterwards. My master, as I suppose, is pumping Mr. Toller. That's all, sir, for to-night.

You know what the feeling is here already? <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> at the last election at Coolidgeville--how the whites wouldn't let the niggers go to the polls and the jolly row that was kicked up over it?

You {{used to be able}} to laugh at anything, but now that you are {{practically}} double you can't laugh any more. Well, that's the common lot of man and you've got to put up with it. Adam was pretty jolly in his garden until Eve was started, but <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> afterwards.

"We know," [...] he replied, [...] "that a {{very great}} man from Russia, a greater still from France, a {{minister}} from Austria, a statesman from Italy, and an envoy from Japan, {{have been invited to}} meet a German minister whose name I will not mention, even to you. The subject of their proposed discussion has never been breathed. One can only suspect. When I tell you that no one from this country was invited to the conference, I think you will be able, broadly speaking, to divine its purpose. The clouds have been gathering for a good many years, and we have only buried our heads a little deeper in the sands. We have had our chances and wilfully chucked them away. National Service or three more army corps four years ago would have brought us an alliance which would have meant absolute safety for twenty-one years. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened.</b> We have lived through many rumours and escaped, more narrowly than most people realise, a great many dangers, but there is every indication this time that the end is really coming." ...|$|E

With certain statesmen here {{at the top of}} the tree, it was perfectly easy for me to carry out any schemes which I thought necessary. During the last few weeks, however, there has been a change. Nominally, things are the same. Actually, I seem to find another hand at work, another hand which works with the censorship, too. One of my very trusted agents in Harwich made the slightest slip the other day. A few weeks ago, he would either have been fined twenty pounds or interned. Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> to him on Wednesday? Of course you don't he was arrested at one o'clock and shot in half an hour. Then you saw the papers this morning?

Though her mother whipped her for her obstinacy, and her father broke his stick across her shoulders, the whole countryside turned against her. They all had to leave the village, for no one would speak to Mariska. A scandal such as that the ignorant peasants round about here will never forgive. Mariska ultimately drowned herself in the Maros: when she no longer could stand the disgrace that pursued her everywhere.

It's been a pleasure to us, for we love you with all our hearts. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> to me when I left the army. I told you years ago of the awful disgrace I suffered.
