40|$|We {{appreciate}} the comments, and appropriate {{questions raised by}} Dr. Walsh K [1]. This study aimed to understand pain relief among patients with cancer more fully, with regard to medical staff members ’ knowledge and/or observation of cancer pain treatment. Because the lack of physicians ’ knowledge regarding cancer pain is a well-known major barrier to adequate pain control, a relevant question involves {{the issue of whether}} patients with cancer who have undergone care by physicians {{with a high level of}} knowledge of cancer pain management experience less severe pain. Therefore, we performed an analysis using matched data regarding physicians ’ level of knowledge of cancer pain; all physicians were principle house staff members responsible for the patients ’ care and medical charts. Thus, we anticipated that the question of whether physicians’ level of knowledge on the effect of pain reduction in certain patients would be answered. The content validity of these two scales was determined on the basis of a literature review [2, 3] and feedback from an expert panel. However, as <b>you</b> <b>mentioned,</b> <b>a</b> more valid instrument for a reliable distinction of physicians ’ knowledge level should be selected for a one-step-forward study. We were concerned about potential attitude changes accompanying physicians ’ abrupt awareness of cancer pain after the survey, and we aimed to obtain information on their natural, unaffected clinical practice management protocols for cancer pain. Therefore, the severity of the pain felt by the patients undergoing care by these physicians was not prospectively evaluated. A lack of knowledge about pain could be a major reason for inadequate pain documentation and misconceptions regarding pain. Breuer e...|$|E
