5000|$|Street {{or urban}} skiing {{consists}} of sliding or grinding <b>your</b> <b>skis</b> on rails, walls, ledges, etc. No where near a resort or mountain. Street {{has much more}} of a risk factor than regular park skiing due to harder terrain. You can spot urban features in such ski movies as Level 1's [...] "After Dark" [...] or any movie made by Stept Productions.|$|E
50|$|Barrels: A {{more recent}} {{addition}} to terrain parks, barrels are features usually shaped like garbage cans or vertical cylinders {{with a small}} jump leading up to it. This feature is jibbed by going off the jump and tapping it in various ways with <b>your</b> <b>skis</b> or snowboard. Variations include spinning {{to and from the}} barrel, tapping with different parts of the skis or stalling on top of the barrel.|$|E
5000|$|...Ski {{boots that}} are too stiff: Skiing in a boot that is too stiff can {{effectively}} limit how forward {{you can get on}} <b>your</b> <b>skis.</b> With today's more up right ski boot stances, failure to properly flex a boot can almost force a skier into the back seat. When choosing a ski boot flex, make sure you can effectively flex the boot at room temperature, as it will only get stiffer with the onset of colder temperatures. Ideal flex on a four buckle boot is achieved when the middle buckles come in close proximity to each other but do not touch. Note however that stronger, more aggressive skiers can benefit from a stiffer flex boot especially if they consistently ski in a forward athletic position.|$|E
5000|$|...Ski Boots {{that are}} too big: If <b>your</b> <b>ski</b> boots are too large your foot and ankle is able to slide forward and backward. When this motion happens, {{intermittent}} contact between the shin and the tongue/upper cuff of the ski boot takes place. This intermittent contact usually continues through the duration of <b>your</b> <b>ski</b> day especially on aggressive terrain that can cause the skier to migrate to skiing in the back seat.|$|R
5000|$|All are [...] "rail wizardry" [...] tricks {{popularized by}} Andy Parry. The Hippy Killer, the most {{well-known}} of these, involves bringing <b>your</b> trailing <b>ski</b> {{up and over the}} side of a box, using <b>your</b> <b>ski</b> to latch {{on the underside of the}} box, and then using this to perform a switch up.|$|R
50|$|In winter, skiers {{take the}} tram {{to the top}} of the {{mountain}} where they are able to ski Rendezvous Mountain as well as out of bounds locations. Many also eat at Corbet's Cabin. You pay for your ticket in <b>your</b> <b>ski</b> pass.|$|R
40|$|Translation begins] UNITED STATES ARMY AIR FORCES Tuesday My Darling, A solid day of sack-time, (solo). As usual I didn’t fly today, it rained, and I mean rain. And, did it rain. But- I predict I will {{be clear}} {{tomorrow}} seein’ as which a cold front, with low strato-cumulus and swelling cumulonimbus passed, followed by a high broken condition of alto stratus (understand?) (I don’t) but anyhow {{it should be clear}} with the weather we had today it should have rained itself out. But let’s not talk about the weather, let’s talk about us. Well, I couldn’t get hold of the C. O. today, all the nowboats were being used for official business, so I had to stay on my side of the street. So I’m going to nail him on the line tomorrow morning. We still haven’t gotten any mail in, this is pitiful. I haven’t got any questions to answer, and there’s no news, so I guess I’ll just have to tell you how much I love you and miss you; - and gosh baby, that’s a job. Oh, one thing, we did wade to the movin’-pictures tonight. The local theater (as they call it) is equipped with the finest 16 mm projector available, the only thing is they can’t get any 16 mm (mm= millimeter) film, so we have to suffer through colossal productions of some two-bit company that frowns on knee length dresses. Tonight the might spectacle was “The Dancing Pirate”. The Dancing pirate was some (I can’t spell it) bent 4 -F who could dance about as well as Ricky. What a show. Oh well, there’s only 11 more days to go. The last class they had here in March fired exactly 400 rounds per pilot, and they’re all in combat now, I guess. It’s a fine thing. It takes them {{about a year and a}} half to teach you to fly the airplane, and then they expect you to learn the most important thing, that might mean your neck someday, in 17 days! You can be the best flyer in the Air Corps. But if you can’t knock ‘em down, what the hell good are you? I can think of alot [sic] of good changes they could make in this program. Honey, do you like Nebraska, Lincoln in particular? I’m just wondering that’s all. So don’t bother packing <b>your</b> <b>skis,</b> yet. Say darling, what do you do for a stiff neck- neck? Boy I’ve got a beaut. This lying in the sack all day is killin’ me. Speaking of that angel, I guess I’d better climb back in, it’s getting late, as it usually does this time of night. Can’t understand it, every night at this time it gets late, -funny. I love you my darling and miss you terribly. If I don’t see you this weekend I will Sunday the 1 st sometime. That will be Easter Sunday won’t it? I hope I can be with you then darling. You have all my love and devotion- always. Your devoted husband, Judd [Translation ends...|$|E
50|$|BURT {{bindings}} {{are classified}} as plate-style snow ski bindings that were invented in the 1970s by Burton A. Weinstein.

40|$|Hello Nerds, [...] [...] Its {{time to get}} tear {{your eyes}} away from the screen and get outside. Nov 17 is National Take a Hike Day and in honor of day we talked about hitting the great outdoors. Turns out that both the Boss and Josh the Intern {{like to go out}} geocaching.

40|$|The Fall 2003 {{meeting of}} SAT {{will be held}} November 6 - 8 in Austin. It has been a few years, and we have enjoyed the {{hospitality}} of many other SAT venues, so we {{are looking forward to}} hosting the meeting again. The meeting {{will be held at the}} Hilton Austin North, located near Highland Mall in north central Austin. A map and driving directions are provided in the newsletter. The focus topic for the meeting is “Quantification – How Good Are Your Numbers? ” We will address all aspects of quantifying compounds in biological specimens. Your numbers are only as good as the standards you use to prepare your calibrators. Sooo, it only seemed appropriate to take a field trip to see the new Cerilliant facilities in Round Rock on Friday afternoon. To relax, after a mentally draining day of science, we are continuing from Round Rock to the little town of Coupland for some great Bar-B-Q and two step dancing at the local saloon.

5000|$|In ski {{mountaineering}} Forsberg's greatest {{achievement is}} in her own opinion winning the biennial Trofeo Mezzalama in 2015 with team mates Axelle Mollaret and Jennifer Fiechter, barely three minutes ahead of world champions Laëtitia Roux, Mireia Miró Varela and Séverine Pont-Combe and a full {{hour and a half}} ahead of the bronze laureats. Said Forsberg a few days later: [...] "I almost feel like I could finish my career." [...] As in Skyrunning she competes in all ski mountaineering distances, as well as team events. She is also able to transition fast from winter to summer events and vice versa; one week after winning the 2015 Trofeo Mezzalama race on skis she won the 73 km Transvulcania by half an hour for her first Skyrunner World Series win of the season. Forsberg herself keeps a low profile; in a 2013 interview she answered the question [...] "What are <b>your</b> strengths in <b>ski</b> mountaineering?" [...] thus: [...] "Hmm. I don't have any direct strengths. I'm a bit mediocre both uphill and downhill, I'd say." ...|$|R
