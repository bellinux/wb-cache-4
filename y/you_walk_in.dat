I {{want it to be}} an entire experience from [...] minute <b>you</b> <b>walk</b> <b>in</b> [...] front door to [...] minute I begin to sing. And when it's all over, everyone's going to press rewind and relive it again. [...] It's going to be as if you're walking into New York circa 1974: There's an art installation in the lobby, a DJ spinning your favorite records in the main room, and then the most haunting performance that you've ever seen on the stage. [...] I'm on the phone every minute of every day, talking to people, being creative, planning this Ball, and my tour manager is constantly saying, 'Come on, we have to go, we've got to go right now,' [...] But to me, the Ball is so important. I want so much to make every depression dollar that everyone spends on my show worth it. And, yeah, I'm paying a lot for it— out of my own pocket. But that's OK. I just don't care about money." ...|$|E
500|$|An {{earlier version}} of [...] "Full on Idle", Title TKs eighth track, was {{released}} on the Amps' Pacer in 1995. In a 1997 interview, Deal {{expressed an interest in}} redoing multiple Amps songs, partially because she did not feel Pacer was well recorded. Bryant opined that both versions of [...] "Full on Idle" [...] sound almost the same, but The Village Voices Jessica Grose wrote that the Breeders' rendition is noticeably slower. In Cibula's view, this version contains elements of country music, cumbia, and ska. The Guardians Betty Clarke cited the line [...] "Obey your colorist, bleach it all away" [...] as an example of Title TKs amusing, off-center lyrics. On [...] "Sinister Foxx", Deal repeatedly sings [...] "Has anyone seen the iguana?" [...] She has explained this as being a reference to buying marijuana: [...] "Have you ever bought a bag of weed? <b>You</b> <b>walk</b> <b>in,</b> and the pot dealer's got an empty terrarium ... Every time I go to a pot dealer's house, there's no iguana." [...] Another line, [...] "I'm in beer class every Thursday night", refers to the alcohol awareness classes that Richard Presley attended after being caught driving while drunk. Phares described the song as having a [...] "sexy menace", and Berger compared the drum part to gunshots and door-knocking.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Fifteen" [...] was {{directed}} by Roman White, who previously directed Swift's music video [...] "You Belong with Me". White began {{with the intention of}} creating a video different than others Swift did in the past. To do so, he believed he needed to set the video outside of high school. White explained, [...] "Well, I think I really wanted this video to kind of be an evolution for Taylor [...] I actually said to her, 'I don't think we should shoot in a high school.' And I don't think she wanted to either." [...] White conceptualized the video's setting by taking into account the literal meaning of the song and transforming into something new. He conceptualized the setting to be new world where Swift could revisit her memories, as they manifest around her. [...] "Let's take the literal meaning of this song and watch it evolve in front of us ... almost as a memory in your head. And create this world, somewhere <b>you</b> <b>walk</b> <b>in</b> on this desolate desert and you start to sing about all these great memories you have... of everything you love blooming around you, and so we literally grew this garden around her", White said. [...] The world moved from one situation to the next. White decided to annex surreal elements to create a cross between a garden and the heart of the memories. He intertwined Swift's emotions with the growth of the garden. The garden grew when Swift felt happy, but at the sight of pain and negative emotions, clouds appear and the garden dies, which also symbolized Anderson's broken heart.|$|E
