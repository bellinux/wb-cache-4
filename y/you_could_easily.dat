It's a job for comedy cardiac specialist Percy Durant (guest star Ade Edmondson), who we last saw working out in Ghana with consultant Ric. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> imagine Percy driving around in a van with a big, red, plastic heart on top of it, or cracking open someone's chest and pulling out a bunch of flowers. And when it comes to Lisa (Luisa Bradshaw-White), he magically comes up with the answer to all her problems.|$|E
500|$|Vocalist Lachman joined The Mercy Clinic, which aided {{the grieving}} process. He commented, [...] "you {{have to get}} back on the horse. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> let a decade go by and not do anything. I'm happy to have walked away with my life after the {{situation}} I was thrown into. But, I mean, what do you do? I'm a musician. I'm going to make music. What Dime would have told me was, 'You make music, motherfucker. Get back on it. Do what you do.' So, that's what I did." [...] Before the shooting, Phil Anselmo made the statement [...] "Dimebag deserves to be severely beaten" [...] in the December 2004 edition of Metal Hammer. He denied making the comments and apologized, although Abbott requested Metal Hammer to provide the audio tapes to prove the authenticity of what Anselmo said. Abbott found the quote authentic and referred to him as the [...] "master of lies".|$|E
2500|$|On October 14, 2004, {{two weeks}} after Texas National Guard {{officials}} signed an oath swearing they had turned over all records, the Texas National Guard released 31 additional pages of documents found by two retired Army lawyers who went through Guard files under an agreement between the Texas National Guard and The Associated Press, which sued {{to gain access to}} the files. A Guard spokesman defended the continuing discoveries, saying Guard officials did not find all of Bush’s records because they were disorganized and in poor shape. [...] "These boxes are full of dirt and rat [...] and dead bugs. They have never [...] been sitting in an uncontrolled climate," [...] said Lt. Col. John Stanford.

2500|$|A common myth {{about this}} story is that the colour-separation overlay (CSO) {{backgrounds}} were accidentally omitted {{in some of the}} car interior scenes, leaving the blue screen behind the characters. In reality, the blue is supposed to represent the sky. The differing shades of blue compared to the location exterior footage {{is the result of the}} shots' separate origins. This is contradicted by Paul Vanezis in an interview, in which he states [...] "I wouldn't put a background in and I'll tell you why they didn't put a background in there - it wasn't lit properly. There wasn't enough blue in it to key it, or yellow or green or whatever it was. It was shot wrong. It shouldn't have been shot in the studio and it shouldn't have been shot on xchrome. These days with modern technology <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> key it... easily, but it wouldn't look right." ...|$|E

60|$|It {{will have}} been remarked that Mr. Yorke varied a little in his phraseology. Now he spoke broad Yorkshire, and anon he {{expressed}} himself in very pure English. His manner seemed liable to equal alternations. He could be polite and affable, and he could be blunt and rough. His station then <b>you</b> <b>could</b> not <b>easily</b> determine by his speech and demeanour. Perhaps the appearance of his residence may decide it.|$|R

5000|$|Digital Spy {{gave the}} song 4/5 stars and a {{positive}} review stating: 'Stone Cold Sober' makes the most of her theatrical background. Sure, it's another slice of post-Winehouse retro-pop, but it's more interesting that most tunes of that ilk, partly because it's a got a chorus <b>you</b> <b>could</b> quite <b>easily</b> do the can-can to, and partly because Faith gives it more sass than a backchatting teenager.

40|$|In Brussels, as in {{the other}} European cities with {{a high rate of}} immigration, the cases of {{anthropophilic}} tinea capitis have risen. Their clinical aspect is more discrete than in zoophilic cases, and <b>you</b> <b>could</b> be <b>easily</b> fooled. This explains why, in 2001 - 2002, we had some epidemics in schools and creches. Griseofulvin, the gold treatment, was withdrawn from the Belgian market in 1997. The identification of the pathogen when using the new antifungals (fluconazole, itraconazole and terbinafine) is mandatory, dermatophytes showing a different sensitivity to these drugs. The management of an anthropophilic tinea capitis needs some good planning and the cooperation of the family and the school. We describe our procedures in this article.
