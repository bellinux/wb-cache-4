40|$|LC/MS {{methodology}} {{for the analysis}} of domoic acid and lipophilic toxins in shellfish was developed using a hybrid triple quadrupole linear ion trap mass spectrometer.

Taking advantage of the high instrument sensitivity, matrix effects were mitigated by reducing the amount of sample introduced to the mass spectrometer. Optionally, samples can be analyzed using information dependent acquisition (IDA) methods, either in positive or negative mode, which can provide an extra level of confirmation by matching the full product ion spectra acquired for a sample with those from a specially constructed spectral library. Methods were applied to the analysis of a new certified reference material and Canadian mussels (Mytilus edulis) implicated in a 2011 diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) incident. The scheduled SRM method enabled the screening and quantitation of multiple phycotoxins. As DSP had not previously been observed in this area of Canada, positive identification of putative toxins was accomplished using the IDA and spectral search method.

The P. reticulatum growth and YTX production were fitted to logistical equations and to a first-order kinetic model, respectively. The parameters obtained from this adjustment were used as dependent variables for the formulation of the empirical equations of the factorial design tested. The results showed that in practically all the cases for both, P. reticulatum growth and YTX production, irradiance is the primary independent variable and has a positive effect in the range 50 – 90 μmol photons m− 2 s− 1.
