6000|$|... "You are sedan chair men, sir. Most of {{the chairs}} are carried by Irishmen, {{who seem to be}} {{stronger}} in the leg than these London folk. You will have to cut <b>your</b> <b>hair</b> short, <b>and</b> then you will pass without observation." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{what would}} you do? Oh, don't look so wicked, Ida! You look like some evil little fairy, with <b>your</b> golden <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> dancing, mischievous eyes. I {{know that you are}} going to propose {{something}} dreadful!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, well, Miss Teaberry," [...] he said, [...] "you {{are getting}} on bravely. Putting up <b>your</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> letting down your skirts has done wonders. You {{are the true}} {{lady of the house}} now." ...|$|E

You're dippy!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{very much}} so indeed. Open {{carriages}} are nasty things. A clean gown is not five minutes' wear in them. You are splashed getting in and getting out; and the wind takes <b>your</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> your bonnet in every direction. I hate an open carriage myself." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You cannot go like this, Mademoiselle Claire," [...] Pierre said reverently.
