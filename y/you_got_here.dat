2500|$|A {{few weeks}} after his {{conviction}} in New Jersey, Slocum and the Spray visited Sagamore Hill, the estate of US President Theodore Roosevelt {{on the north shore}} of Long Island, New York. Roosevelt and his family were interested in the tales of Slocum's solo circumnavigation. The President's young son, Archie, along with a guardian, spent the next few days sailing with Slocum up to Newport aboard the Spray, which, by then, was a decrepit, weather-worn vessel. Slocum again met with President Roosevelt in May 1907, this time at the White House in Washington. Supposedly, Roosevelt said to him, [...] "Captain, our adventures have been a little different." [...] Slocum answered, [...] "That is true, Mr. President, but I see <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>here</b> first." ...|$|E

60|$|KATHERINE. Now, go up at once. I can't {{think how}} <b>you</b> <b>got</b> down <b>here.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, and I can {{witness the}} papers easily enough, and get several others to, too, if it's necessary. Have <b>you</b> <b>got</b> them <b>here</b> in the city?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, tell us {{all about}} your adventures, and how <b>you</b> <b>got</b> down <b>here</b> {{just in time to see}} our fellows enter, in triumph. I suppose you managed to give them the slip, somehow?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Lambert issued his command. [...] "Get your outfits together. I don't {{understand}} how <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>here,</b> but you're {{going to get}} out with me within the next half-hour." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, damn you, Red!... I wouldn't lay {{a hand on}} you. And I am sick, I'm {{so glad to see}} you!... I thought <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>here</b> {{ahead of}} me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You haven't been of {{much use}} to us yet! I think you stated that when <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>here</b> you'd {{recollect}} all your father {{told you about}} Strange's talk. Seeing the places would bring things back!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Or yours, if <b>you</b> had <b>got</b> <b>here</b> first," [...] said she, {{beginning}} to realize the whole ghastliness of the possibility. [...] "Oh, Edgar, {{there has been an}} Eye watching over us to-night, and we should be thankful indeed!" ...|$|R
60|$|ANNA--[Acutely embarrassed in her turn.] Hello--father. She {{told me it}} was <b>you.</b> I yust <b>got</b> <b>here</b> {{a little}} while ago.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, well, we {{must get}} her away, as I said, Mrs. Powlett. She wants more bracing air than <b>you</b> have <b>got</b> <b>here,</b> {{and to have the}} wind either coming {{straight}} off the sea or else to be in some hilly, breezy place." ...|$|R
6000|$|Sir ANTHONY Oh, not at all!--Not at all! I'm in no hurry.--Ah! Jack, you youngsters, when {{once you}} are wounded here [Putting his hand to CAPTAIN ABSOLUTE's breast.] Hey! what the deuce have <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>here?</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are with}} friends. Never mind how <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>here.</b> You have been ill, {{but you will}} soon get well again. Someone hit you on the head, and we picked you up and brought you here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Poor old whale, I {{wonder how}} <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>here,</b> {{where you came}} from, {{and if you were}} a good and happy {{creature}} while you lived," [...] said Freddy, patting the old bone with his little hand.|$|E

6000|$|... "Tell us how <b>you</b> <b>got</b> in <b>here,</b> Uncle 'Rasmus?" [...] I asked, {{for after}} seeing {{the long line of}} {{sentinels}} which guarded the half-formed entrenchments, it seemed to me little less than marvelous that one could have made his way through without being challenged.|$|R
6000|$|... "Couldn't <b>you</b> have <b>got</b> <b>here</b> earlier, Bella?" [...] he asked. [...] "In {{another few}} minutes you'd have spoiled the drive--the birds can't be {{far off the}} dip of the ridge. Hardly fair to the keepers or {{the rest of us}} to take these risks, is it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am so glad <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>here</b> safely, Dick," [...] said Dora, {{in a low}} voice. [...] "But oh, do {{you think}} it is quite safe?" [...] she went on, anxiously. [...] "I--I don't want you to get hurt!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Betty, by the Lord {{that loves}} us!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "Here's luck! I {{was on my}} way out to search for <b>you.</b> <b>Got</b> <b>here</b> on the Chicago Limited at four o'clock. Give me your hands and say that you are glad to see me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Plenty {{of bread}} and cheese," [...] said Priscilla, laughing, with her hand inside her brother's arm. For though Priscilla hated all other men, she did not hate her brother Hugh. [...] "If you wanted things nice to eat {{directly}} <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>here,</b> {{you ought to have}} written." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Cut it out!" [...] she cried. [...] "What {{business}} have <b>you</b> <b>got</b> {{coming in}} <b>here</b> and straightening up? I {{was a fool}} to bring you, anyway." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Another mystery revealed!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "Now I {{know what}} you wanted with those gold and silver plates that came to you from London. Are you aware of what a {{character}} <b>you</b> have <b>got</b> <b>here?</b> There are some of us who suspect you of coining false money!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But wouldn't {{people give}} you {{money for the}} show if you lived <b>here,</b> grampa? <b>You</b> always <b>got</b> money <b>here</b> the same as other places." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't {{see that}} at all. What duties have <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>here?</b> What good {{are you doing}} the Company? If you do stay, I hope you'll be unanimous; that's all;--or perhaps you intend to go out. If that's it, I'll look to your money. I think I told you that before.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And what in {{the world}} have you got that uniform on for, Terence?" [...] O'Grady asked, when the din {{somewhat}} subsided. [...] "We saw that the general had appointed you as one of his aides-de-camp when <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>here</b> after Corunna, but you would wear your own uniform all the same." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, Philip!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "How have <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>here?</b> We {{saw your}} three vessels come along {{just as it}} became dark, an hour ago. I suppose you must have landed as they passed Batavia. But what is the matter? you look strangely ill. Have you been wounded {{in a fight with}} those pirates?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "On the mainmast, {{and pretty}} nigh drowned we were {{before we got}} there. I suppose the tide must have taken us a bit further up than it did <b>you.</b> We <b>got</b> <b>here</b> well nigh two hours ago, though we got a good meal and dried our clothes at a farmhouse." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Gone wrong?" [...] Jim exclaimed, {{and it did}} {{really look}} as if his eyes would roll right down on his cheeks. [...] "The whole bloomin' bottom has dropped out of everything. The Britishers are comin' into the bay thicker'n spatter, an' I don't see how <b>you</b> <b>got</b> in <b>here</b> without bein' caught!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well! Well! Betts, I knew {{it would}} be dull here for you, but you must not get discouraged. You know <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>here</b> late last fall, and have not had any {{pleasant}} weather yet. It is perfectly delightful in May and June. I can take you to fields of wild white honeysuckle and May flowers and wild roses. I know you love the woods, so be patient a little longer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When {{you first}} came in," [...] he admitted, [...] "I felt like {{throwing}} you out. How <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>here</b> I don't know. I {{suppose it is}} no use complaining to the hotel people. But there is no man {{on the face of}} this earth in whom I am more interested than Falkenberg. I shall change my clothes, and in {{a quarter of an hour}} I am at your service. Wait for me downstairs." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are a stout fellow," [...] he said, laughing, [...] "and {{will make}} a fine slave. What have <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>here</b> that {{you are ready to}} risk your life for?" [...] He looked at the little chain and its pendant with an air of disappointment. [...] "'Tis worth but little," [...] he said, showing it to his mate. [...] "I would not give five ducats for it in the market. It must be a charm, or a knight would never carry it about with him and prize it so highly. It may be to things like this the Christians owe their luck." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wal, Ellen, {{you remind}} me of what I was wantin' to tell you when <b>you</b> just <b>got</b> <b>here....</b> Yestiddy I heerd you called thet name in a barroom.
