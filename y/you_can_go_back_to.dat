2500|$|Yu Fan {{considered}} bringing Wang Lang {{north to}} Guangling Commandery (廣陵郡; around present-day Huai'an, Jiangsu) to evade Sun Ce, but Wang, {{who believed in}} stories about the immortal Wang Fangping (王方平), wanted {{to travel to the}} [...] "South Mountain" [...] and take shelter there. Yu Fan then accompanied Wang Lang as they escaped from Kuaiji by sea and headed south to Houguan County (候官縣; in present-day Fuzhou, Fujian). At Houguan, the county chief initially denied them entry, but agreed after being persuaded by Yu Fan. In Houguan, Wang Lang insisted on heading further south to Jiao Province to find the [...] "South Mountain", but Yu Fan objected, [...] "Those stories are nonsense. There is no South Mountain in Jiao Province for us to take shelter." [...] Wang Lang told Yu Fan later, [...] "You have an elderly mother (to take care of). <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> (<b>to</b> Kuaiji) now." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{fourth class}} of racing in BMX which are held at local and {{national}} events are called Opens. Opens are largely exhibition and are a chance to test yourself and practice against better competition without jeopardizing your point standings. You must be registered to race in a points race {{to sign up for}} the Open events. No points are awarded for Opens although trophy places are and the moto qualification rounds are similar to the point races. These are races with more flexible skill level and age requirements. In Opens there are no Novice, Intermediate and Expert divisions. All amateur skill levels are free to participate. The age groupings are generally broader, for example 13-14 open class as opposed to 13 Intermediate and 14 Intermediate being separate groupings for those ages in the points races. Girls may also participate in the male Open class within the proper age ranges. However expert boys are not allowed in these [...] "Mixed" [...] opens. Then an Expert Open is held in that event. The pros are excluded from racing with the amateurs if enough pros are at hand to race that a separate Pro-Open class can be created. If not, then the pros can race in the amateur Open with some restrictions. This is called a Pro-Am event. Except for the Pro-Am exception the Expert racers usually wins the open class. Even if there are Pros in the Open, {{it is not unusual for}} an older Expert-17-18 age class for example-to win since many have the talent and speed to be a pro but have not yet taken the opportunity, partly because once you go Pro, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> amateur only under very strict circumstances.|$|E

5000|$|On Oct. 16, 2009, Ballentine, {{according}} to published reports, told Juan Williams [...] "You <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to the porch, Juan. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>back.</b> It's ok." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I haven't been careful," [...] said Louise, gayly; [...] "but I'm quite well, and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> at once, if that's all, mamma." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> with me," [...] said Tom, to {{make sure}} that the former teacher should not bother Mrs. Stanhope during his absence from the Wellington.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not before seven to-morrow morning, Miss Allsop," [...] she said. [...] "Hugh, {{you will}} get up, won't you? You mustn't miss seeing them. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> bed again." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No, I don't think <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> {{your gun}} again. You {{will have to}} eat and drink a bit, and make fresh blood, before you will be much use at a thirty-two pounder again.|$|E
6000|$|... 'O Maimie,' he cried, 'it isn't fair to {{take you}} with me if <b>you</b> think <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>back!</b> Your mother'--he gulped again--'you don't know {{them as well as}} I do.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "At {{the next}} town we reach we can hire a horse," [...] said Matt. [...] "And <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> if <b>you</b> wish. There is no telling how long this chase may last." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Maimie," [...] he cried, [...] "it isn't fair to {{take you}} with me if <b>you</b> think <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>back.</b> Your mother"--he gulped again--"you don't know {{them as well as}} I do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You can do this," [...] she declared. [...] "It is very easy. I {{want you}} to leave this place this morning, go away, anywhere! <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> London, or you can travel. Only start this morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I reckon you'll {{lay there}} without making very much fuss, till I {{get ready to}} let you go," [...] he said, as he treated himself to a long draught from a black flask. [...] "When we do land at Yonkers, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Police Headquarters once more." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{sooner we}} part the better. I shan't stop with you another night. I shall take my box and my {{portmanteau}} into that room and pack. I shall stop in there to-night, {{sleep in a}} chair or think. And to-morrow I shall settle up with Madam Gadow and go. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> ... <b>to</b> your cheating." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "And {{thinking}} we {{was going home}} with our recruits," [...] Sparrowhawk slipped in. [...] "Lord lumme, that Miss Lackland ain't never satisfied. 'I'll take 'em on the Martha,' says she, 'and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> and fill up again.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{do we do}} with it now? Ay can't <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to the Kincaid. [...] Rokoff {{would have}} me shot; but <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>back.</b> Ay take <b>you</b> to the sea, and then some of these black men they take you to the ship--eh?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> your friend, {{and tell}} him I have nothing to say.

Will you tell him that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well. Do {{you leave}} him alone; stay down here, {{and see what}} will come of it. I quite agree that such a banishment, as you call it, is not a happy {{prospect}} for you;--but it is happier {{than that of a}} marriage with Frank Houston. Give that up, and then <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> London and begin the world again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are {{following}} me {{and trying to}} defeat the object of my trip to Chicago. But you shall not do it.

6000|$|... 'Wait a little. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> presently. Sit {{down and}} light your pipe. There is some one moving about upstairs. It {{must be that}} heavy-footed Jemima. I hope she won't wake Maude up. I suppose one must expect such attacks at such a time.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Is it so wonderful?" [...] she answered. [...] "To {{tell you}} the truth, I was not sleepy, and I felt like a little walk. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> now, Bryan," [...] she said, turning to her maid. [...] "Mr. Mannering will see me home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "His {{horse is}} gone lame, and he {{say you do}} that," [...] cried Tony Duval.

6000|$|... "No {{punishment}} is due, my man. Jesus has borne all the punishment due {{to you and}} me. In regard to man, you have restored that which you took away, and well do I know that the young lady--like her Master--forgives freely. I will return the watch to her. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> your comrades--nobody shall ever hear more about this.

50|$|An alien {{crashed on}} Earth {{and to get}} back to his planet he must find the four pieces of his spacecraft. Go into the several rooms and press the button.

6000|$|... “Very good, Mr. Gilmore, I {{understand}} your feelings, but I quite expect {{that when you}} do return {{you will have to}} go through the ordeal of being presented with a piece of plate, and probably after that you will have to attend a complimentary ball.

6000|$|... "But why did I disturb {{you from}} your sleep, Egyptian? Oh! I remember.

I {{disturbed}} you that you might tell it to me but if you have forgotten it, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> your bed and rest there till it returns to you.

6000|$|... "A {{party of}} citizens, not over-gentle in their ways, {{attempted}} {{to pass the}} sentinel near the barracks, and were received by him {{at the point of}} his bayonet.
