500|$|Smaug is {{the main}} antagonist. In many ways the Smaug episode {{reflects}} and references the dragon of Beowulf, and Tolkien uses the episode to put into practice some of the ground-breaking literary theories he had developed about the Old English poem in its portrayal of the dragon as having bestial intelligence. Tolkien greatly prefers this motif over the later medieval trend of using the dragon as a symbolic or allegorical figure, {{such as in the}} legend of St. George. Smaug the dragon with his golden hoard may be seen {{as an example of the}} traditional relationship between evil and metallurgy as collated in the depiction of Pandæmonium with its [...] "Belched fire and rolling smoke" [...] in Milton's Paradise Lost. Of all the characters, Smaug's speech is the most modern, using idioms such as [...] "Don't let <b>your</b> <b>imagination</b> run away with you!" ...|$|E

[...] Regarding the sexual intercourse scenes between actor Taylor Kinney and the singer as a mermaid, Gaga explained that it emphasized metaphorically that sometimes relationships did not work. [...] "No matter what you do, there's this giant boundary between you and someone else. So that's what it's about, perceiving in <b>your</b> <b>imagination</b> that there's something magical inside of you that you can make it work," [...] she said. After revealing that the wedding dress shown in the video belonged to her mother, Gaga explained the scenes involving the ice cream truck. According to her, they represented the destruction of her youth, experiences she had shared in earlier interviews. Explaining her decision to include them, Gaga said: ...|$|E

[...] Yu elaborated that it had [...] "enough panache in its two levels to make it somewhat of an indie sleeper hit of the end of 2008." [...] An editor from The Refined Geek was pleased with Gravity Bone and its sequel, Thirty Flights of Loving, awarding them each a score of 8 out of 10 and stating, [...] "the enjoyment from these games comes from noticing all the subtle environmental clues and then using <b>your</b> <b>imagination</b> to draw the connecting dots."

500|$|In 2006, supervising {{animator}} on {{the film}} Scott Clark, spoke about the challenges of animating car characters, saying: [...] "Getting {{a full range of}} performance and emotion from these characters and making them still seem like cars was a tough assignment, but that's what animation does best. You use <b>your</b> <b>imagination,</b> and you make the movements and gestures fit with the design. Our car characters may not have arms and legs, but we can lean the tires in or out to suggest hands opening up or closing in. We can use steering to point a certain direction. We also designed a special eyelid and an eyebrow for the windshield that lets us communicate an expressiveness that cars don't have." [...] Doug Sweetland, who also served as supervising animator, also spoke about the challenges, saying: [...] "It took a different kind of animator to really be able to interpret the Cars models, than it did to interpret something like The Incredibles models. With The Incredibles, the animator could get reference for the characters by shooting himself and watching the footage. But with Cars, it departs completely from any reference. Yes they're cars, but no car can do what our characters do. It's pure fantasy. It took a lot of trial and error to get them to look right." ...|$|E

Shimomura has also stated that she comes up with most of her songs when she is doing something that is [...] "not part of [...] daily routine, like traveling." [...] Although her influences are mostly classical, she has said that in her opinion her [...] "style has changed dramatically over the years, though the passion for music stays the same." [...] Shimomura has said that she believes that {{an important part of}} [...] "the creative process behind music" [...] is to [...] "convey a subtle message, something that comes from <b>your</b> <b>imagination</b> and sticks with the listener, without being overly specific about what it means", rather than only writing simple themes with obvious messages.

500|$|When {{discussing}} [...] "Take a Bow", NPR Multimedia senior producer Keith Jenkins {{said the}} music video, with its [...] "rich, sensually framed sepia tones", doesn't leave {{much to the}} imagination but rather, it becomes <b>your</b> <b>imagination,</b> with Madonna's vision [...] "drill into your brain, unlocking your waking eye." [...] Carol Vernallis, author of Experiencing Music Video: Aesthetics and Cultural Context, noted that the video exemplified the lyrics of the song. She clarified that the scenes featuring Madonna and Muñoz dressing up and putting on their gloves pointed to storyline and lyrics that appeared later, the lyrics being [...] "all the world loves a clown". During that line Muñoz as the torero is seen with a fatuous expression, which Vernallis deduced as [...] "the beginning {{of the story of}} possession and fame" [...] in the video. When Madonna sings [...] "I've always been in love with you", she appeared in the video as sometimes adolescent and sometimes middle-aged. For Vernallis it was not clear if the imagery was literal or figurative of the lyrics, [...] "embodying a lasting affection, as separate parts of Madonna's psyche, or as the exaggerated claims of a groupie." [...] The author also noted that the scene where Madonna pricks her hand with a needle makes her relationship with the torero as more ambiguous. The costumes and melody in the video reminded Vernallis of the 1904 opera Madame Butterfly by Giacomo Puccini although with an inverted plotline. The scenes showing Madonna in an enclosed room with a single light bulb also drew comparisons to Glenn Close's character in the 1987 psychological thriller film, Fatal Attraction. Another observation by Vernallis was about the power struggle it showed in the video, with Madonna gradually losing and relegated to one corner of the room.|$|E

[...] "In most art therapy sessions, the focus is on your inner experience—your feelings, perceptions, and imagination.

[...] Seeing workers wearing the required protection outfits worn by health workers and taking those suspected of having Ebola or of being contacts to the treatment center (perhaps never to be seen again), refusing the usual burial rituals when a patient died, and other actions taken by the unfamiliar individuals that had come to their remote areas, had led to rumors of organ harvesting and government and tribal plots.
