6000|$|... "What in hell do <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>that,</b> Crocker?" [...] cried my client, eyeing me {{closely and}} repeating the {{question}} again and again, {{as was his}} wont when agitated.|$|E
6000|$|... "My young friend," [...] he said, [...] "your {{eyes are}} better than mine. You see the road there? Look along it, between the white posts, {{as far as you}} can. What do <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> black speck?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What do <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>that,</b> Uncle Holly," [...] said Leo, {{with a sort}} of gasp, as he {{replaced}} it on the table. [...] "We have been looking for a mystery, and we certainly seem to have found one." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Many things; {{more than}} I can tell you--things you've only {{to think of}} for yourself. What do <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> all <b>that</b> I've done for myself?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Humbug, man!" [...] said Dick; [...] "you're working {{yourself}} {{into a state of}} nervous excitement. Why, what the devil do <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> all <b>that</b> nonsense about a mysterious agent which would signal our whereabouts?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Strether, [...] "the way she {{has spoken}} for you, all the same--so far as I've {{given her a}} chance--has only made me feel how much she wishes to keep <b>you.</b> If <b>you</b> <b>make</b> nothing <b>of</b> <b>that</b> I don't see why {{you wanted me to}} listen to her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, well, it {{just happens}} that I have already read all the {{available}} evidence, including {{the report of the}} inquest, with some care. By the way, what do <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> tobacco pouch, found on the scene of the crime? Is there no clue there?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What now, Bunting?--what now, Greenly?" [...] demanded Sir Gervaise, a sea having {{struck the}} side of the ship and thrown so much spray into his face as to reduce him to the {{necessity}} of using his pocket-handkerchief, at the very moment he was anxious to be looking through his glass. [...] "What do <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>that,</b> gentlemen?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, I'll {{show you}} the explanation. There IS a second stain, {{but it does not}} {{correspond}} with the other. See for yourself." [...] As he spoke he turned over another portion of the carpet, and there, sure enough, was a great crimson spill upon the square white facing of the old-fashioned floor. [...] "What do <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>that,</b> Mr. Holmes?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite so!" [...] said he, {{a little}} nettled. [...] "Every problem becomes very childish when {{once it is}} {{explained}} to you. Here is an unexplained one. See what <b>you</b> can <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>that,</b> friend Watson." [...] He tossed {{a sheet of paper}} upon the table, and turned once more to his chemical analysis.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, anyway, it's a {{perfectly}} elegant story, Anne, and will <b>make</b> <b>you</b> famous, <b>of</b> <b>that</b> I'm sure. Have {{you got a}} title for it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Then {{the voices}} {{suddenly}} became intelligible, {{and she heard}} Merril say, [...] "It's rather a pity <b>you</b> didn't <b>make</b> sure <b>of</b> <b>that</b> before <b>you</b> took what we offered you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You think {{then that}} {{everything}} is for the best?" [...] asked Stoutenburg grimly, [...] "you did not begin to wonder how it was that--as Jan ascertained at Zegwaard and at Zevenhuizen--Gilda continued her journey without any protest. According to the people whom Jan questioned she looked sad certainly, but she was always willing to restart on her way. What do <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>that,</b> my friend?" ...|$|E
6000|$|When Arthur {{had gone}} I {{went back to}} the room. Lucy was {{sleeping}} gently, but her breathing was stronger. I could see the counterpane move as her breast heaved. By the bedside sat Van Helsing, looking at her intently. The velvet band again covered the red mark. I asked the Professor in a whisper, [...] "What do <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> mark on her throat?" ...|$|E
6000|$|DR. JONATHAN. The same right, Augusta, {{that you}} have to catechize Minnie. Only I wish to {{discover}} the truth, and apparently you do not. She left me a letter, too, in which she said, [...] "Don't try to find me--I wouldn't come back if you did. Mrs. Pindar was right about me, after all--I had to break loose again." [...] Now, Augusta, I'd like to know what <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>that?</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{looked at}} her, with his {{colourless}} candour, {{still in his}} place; she moved about again, a little, emphasising by her unrest her declaration of her tranquillity. He was as silent, at first, {{as if he had}} taken her answer, but he was not to keep it long. [...] "What do <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> it <b>that,</b> by your own show, Charlotte couldn't tell her all? What do <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> it <b>that</b> the Prince didn't tell her anything? Say one understands that there are things she can't be told--since, as you put it, she is so easily scared and shocked." [...] He produced these objections slowly, giving her time, by his pauses, to stop roaming and come back to him. But she was roaming still when he concluded his inquiry. [...] "If there hadn't been anything there shouldn't have been between the pair before Charlotte bolted--in order, precisely, as you say, that there SHOULDN'T be: why in the world was what there HAD been too bad to be spoken of?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, {{follow that}} passage with your eye, {{and tell me}} whether it {{distinctly}} states that the prisoner expressly {{said that he was}} instructed by his legal advisers wholly to reserve his defence? Come! Do <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{really think}} <b>you</b> can <b>make</b> {{something}} <b>of</b> <b>that</b> concern," [...] he said, pointing {{with his thumb}} backward over his shoulder. [...] "Any mind <b>that</b> is capable <b>of</b> a real sorrow is capable of good. You must try and do something with her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No fear. This fellow {{has been}} pickled in natron, and looked after {{in the most}} {{approved}} style. They did not serve hodsmen in that fashion. Salt or bitumen was enough for them. It has been calculated {{that this sort of}} thing cost about seven hundred and thirty pounds in our money. Our friend was a noble at the least. What do <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> small inscription near his feet, Smith?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Take care, Lassiter, I {{might think}} that a proposal," [...] she replied, gaily. [...] "It's {{dangerous}} to propose elopement to a Mormon woman. Well, I was expecting you. Now {{will be a good}} hour to show you Milly Erne's grave. The day-riders have gone, and the night-riders haven't come in. Bern, what do <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>that?</b> Need I worry? You know I have to be made to worry." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "From the Plymouth hotel, Watson," [...] he said. [...] "I {{learned the}} name of it from the vicar, and I wired to make certain that Dr. Leon Sterndale's account was true. It appears that he did indeed spend last night there, and that he has {{actually}} allowed some of his baggage to go on to Africa, while he returned to be present at this investigation. What do <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>that,</b> Watson?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We do not agree, eh?" [...] said Poirot. [...] "Well, let us leave it. Time {{will show}} which {{of us is}} right. Now let us turn to {{other aspects of the}} case. What do <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> the fact <b>that</b> all the doors of the bedroom were bolted on the inside?" ...|$|R
50|$|Teru and Ako sit {{together}} {{and watch the}} volcano, and Teru reflects {{that the world is}} what <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> it, and <b>that</b> even with the world in ruins good or evil still both have chances to triumph, leaving a faint glimmer of hope for things to adjust themselves, one day in the future.|$|R
6000|$|... "Peste!" [...] exclaimed Raoul Yvard, {{as soon as}} he had gazed {{a minute}} at the {{stranger}} in silence; [...] "a pretty cul de sac are we in, if that gentleman should happen to be an Englishman! What say you, Etooell; can <b>you</b> <b>make</b> out anything <b>of</b> <b>that</b> ensign--your eyes are the best in the lugger?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Sir. Allow me {{to remind}} you (though there is no legal {{necessity}} for my doing so, as you are aware) that the bill at two months' date drawn on yourself by Mr. Matthew Bagnet, and by you accepted, for the sum of ninety-seven pounds four shillings and ninepence, will become due to-morrow, when you will please be prepared {{to take up the}} same on presentation. Yours, Joshua Smallweed.' What do <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>that,</b> Phil?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, well, it {{is surely}} not quite so bad as that. The cipher message begins with a large 534, does it not? We may {{take it as a}} working {{hypothesis}} that 534 is the particular page to which the cipher refers. So our book has already become a LARGE book, which is surely something gained. What other indications have we as to the nature of this large book? The next sign is C2. What do <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>that,</b> Watson?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Regulus,' he said, 'was not a leader-writer for {{the penny}} press, nor, for that matter, was Horace. Regulus says: [...] "The soldier ransomed by gold will come keener for the fight--will he by--by gum!" [...] That's {{the meaning of}} scilicet. It {{indicates}} contempt--bitter contempt. [...] "Forsooth," [...] forsooth! You'll be talking about [...] "speckled beauties" [...] and [...] "eventually transpire" [...] next. Howell, what do <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> doubled [...] "Vidi ego--ego vidi"? It wasn't put in to fill up the metre, you know.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I shall let Miss Mohun {{do most of}} the rampaging, nurse; but, if it is fine, {{will you}} take Miss Primrose into the town and let her choose her own cards. I have given her a florin, and if <b>you</b> <b>make</b> the most <b>of</b> <b>that</b> for her, she will be as happy as going with us.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It would {{occupy a}} long time," [...] {{answered}} Sir Patrick, [...] "to tell you how--and {{it is not}} at all necessary to our purpose that you should know. My present obligation merely binds me to tell you--in strict confidence, mind!--that Miss Silvester's secrets are no secrets to Mr. Delamayn. I leave to your discretion the use <b>you</b> may <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> information. <b>You</b> are now entirely on a par with me in relation to your knowledge of the case of Miss Silvester. Let us return to the question which I asked you when we first came into the room. Do you see the connection, now, between that question, and what I have said since?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{have you}} done, sir?" [...] I demanded. [...] "By what right {{did you do}} this thing? By what right did <b>you</b> <b>make</b> a {{sacrifice}} <b>of</b> <b>that</b> sweet dove? Did you conceive me so vile as to think that I should ever owe you gratitude--that I should ever do aught but abhor the deed, abhor all who had a hand in it, abhor the very life itself purchased for me at such a cost?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Farther. And {{everybody}} else thinks so. Everybody except my wife. She {{tells me that}} I am a model of manly beauty. You know Lancelot? Well, she says I have Lancelot whipped to a custard. What do <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>that?</b> And here's another thing. It is perfectly {{obvious to me that}} my wife {{is one of the most}} beautiful creatures in existence. I have seen them all, and I tell you that she stands alone. She is literally marooned in Class A, all by herself. Yet she insists that she is plain. What do you make of it?' ...|$|E
6000|$|Do {{you want}} a man not to {{practise}} what he believes, then encourage him to keep often speaking it in words. Every time he speaks it, the tendency to do it will grow less. His empty speech of what he believes, will be a weariness and an affliction to the wise man. But do you wish his empty speech of what he believes, to become farther an insincere speech of what he does not believe? Celebrate to him his gift of speech; assure him that he shall rise in Parliament by means of it, and achieve great things without any performance; that eloquent speech, whether performed or not, is admirable. My friends, eloquent unperformed speech, in Parliament or elsewhere, is horrible! The eloquent man that delivers, in Parliament or elsewhere, a beautiful speech, and will perform nothing of it, but leaves it as if already performed,--what can <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> man? He has enrolled himself among the Ignes Fatui and Children of the Wind; means to serve, as beautifully illuminated Chinese Lantern, in that corps henceforth. I think, the serviceable thing you could do to that man, if permissible, would be a severe one: To clip off a bit of his eloquent tongue by way of penance and warning; another bit, if he again spoke without performing; and so again, till you had clipt the whole tongue away from him,--and were delivered, you and he, from at least one miserable mockery: [...] "There, eloquent friend, see now in silence if there be any redeeming deed in thee; of blasphemous wind-eloquence, at least, we shall have no more!" [...] How many pretty men have gone this road, escorted by the beautifulest marching music from all the [...] "public organs;" [...] and have found at last that it ended--where? It is the broad road, that leads direct to Limbo and the Kingdom of the Inane. Gifted men, and once valiant nations, and as it were the whole world with one accord, are marching thither, in melodious triumph, all the drums and hautboys giving out their cheerfulest Ca-ira. It is the universal humor of the world just now. My friends, I am very sure you will arrive, unless you halt!-- ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1940 I {{could at}} least fly as far as Glasgow in most of my aircraft, but not now! It makes me furious when I see the Mosquito. I turn green and yellow with envy. The British, who can afford {{aluminium}} better than we can, knock together a beautiful wooden aircraft that every piano factory over there is building, and they give it a speed which they have now increased yet again. What do <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>that?</b> There is nothing the British do not have. They have the geniuses {{and we have the}} nincompoops. After the war is over I'm going to buy a British radio set - then at least I'll own something that has always worked.|$|E
6000|$|Then Sir Gareth {{smiled and}} he said: [...] "Lady, <b>you</b> <b>make</b> much <b>of</b> <b>that</b> {{which is very}} little. Know you not that it behooves all true knights to be gentle and patient with all such as are not so strong as they? So it is that in being courteous to you I have done naught except that which I have been taught to do in such a case. As for those bitter words you spake to me, I may tell you that any anger which I might have felt {{therefor}} I visited upon those knights against whom I fought. For when you gave me those bitter words, then I gave them bitter blows therefor, {{and the more you}} scorned me the more strongly and vehemently did I fight." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will show}} you. This evening after the assault I chanced {{to walk with}} some of my fellows, round yonder small fort upon the knoll {{to see if we}} could spy a weak spot in it. Some of them came to the wall to curse us, and among them whom should I see but a big man with a white face, red hair and a touch of Anthony's fire upon his cheek? What <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>of</b> <b>that,</b> Squire Nigel?" ...|$|R
40|$|I am {{submitting}} {{this for}} the City Commission concerning the Pine-Santaularia combined applications for rezoning and annexation, the so-called Airport Industrial Park, which I am informed is scheduled for the August 19 agenda. If you please, could <b>you</b> <b>make</b> this part <b>of</b> <b>that</b> file available to the Commissioners and the public. It is my intention to refer to this government study in my comments. Could you please confirm {{that this has been}} received and filed in good order by return email...|$|R
