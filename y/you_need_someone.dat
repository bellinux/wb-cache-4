500|$|The {{episode was}} co-written by co-showrunners J.H. Wyman and Jeff Pinkner, and {{consulting}} producer Akiva Goldsman. Executive producer Joe Chappelle directed. Pinkner and Wyman approached the episode [...] "like a new pilot" [...] {{to draw in}} viewers who wanted to watch the show but did not know when to start. They used Lincoln Lee {{as a tool to}} acquaint viewers with the new changes. Former guest actor Seth Gabel, who played Lee, joined the cast as a series regular for the fourth season. He believed his character allowed the audience to see Fringe Division from a new perspective. He explained, [...] "You need a layman's perspective from time to time. The show has gotten so deep into this crazy, surreal scientific world that <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>someone</b> to enter every now and then to remind you this is not the common experience. <b>You</b> <b>need</b> <b>someone</b> to show you how far down the rabbit hole you’ve gone, so you don't become desensitized to it. I think Lincoln serves that for a while." ...|$|E
500|$|Observing Wenger's {{transfer}} policy in 2009, Sir Alex Ferguson commented that it lacked balance and needed defensive players to solidfy the Arsenal team. The players Wenger recruits {{have often been}} criticised for their character and leadership capabilities; footballer Joey Barton suggested {{it was because the}} manager discouraged them from commanding: [...] "Sometimes <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>someone</b> to galvanise and that might be a shouter and bawler. It may not be Arsene's way, but I think they lack that". Wenger is perceived as frugal given his inactivity in transfer windows, but he has denied the stereotype: [...] "Of course people say always to buy but you cannot make careers [...] buy every time you have an injured player. You know I have the wrong reputation. I'm not scared to spend money. The job of a manager is not to spend as much money".|$|E
500|$|Fox was in {{negotiations}} to star as Jennifer Check since {{the film was}} announced in 2007, and was officially cast in October 2007. Fox said the reason she agreed to the role was her love for the script. [...] "I think what I loved about the movie is it's so unapologetic and how completely inappropriate it is at all times," [...] she said. [...] "That was my favorite part about the script and about the character. It's fun {{to be able to}} say the shit that she got to say and get away with it and how people find it charming." [...] Asked how acting in a film like this is different from acting in Transformers, Fox said [...] "there's [...] distractions, like there's no robots to distract you from whatever performance I do give. So, if it's terrible, you're gonna fucking know that it's really terrible". She said despite this aspect of the business being intimidating, she enjoyed portraying the character. [...] "I wasn't really sure what I was doing," [...] said Fox. [...] "I was just trying to have fun with it and I felt like I was able to make fun of my own image as to how some people might perceive Megan Fox to be. I was just sort of flying freely and I hope some of it works." [...] To prepare for her role as a living-dead teenager, Fox dropped to a near-frail 97 pounds and stayed out of the sun to keep her skin pale. In balancing out the film's horror with humor, she said she relied heavily on Diablo Cody's script and Karyn Kusama's direction to pull it off, stating, [...] "I have a very specific sense of humor, things that I think are funny aren't going to fly with middle America. It's going to eliminate some of the audience, so <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>someone</b> there to tell you you can't do that." ...|$|E

[...] In the second line, Fanning states that [...] "I made a mistake that I'll never surpass", before {{explaining}} {{that it does not}} matter whose fault it is, in saying [...] "I know <b>you</b> <b>needed</b> <b>someone</b> to take the fall/I know <b>you</b> <b>needed</b> <b>someone</b> to blame it on". [...] In the second verse, Fanning again reiterates that he feels pain in the mistake that was made, when he says [...] "I found my heart and it broke like glass/I made that mistake that I'll never surpass".|$|R

2500|$|From the Channel Nine {{commentary}} box, Tony Greig {{went as far}} as to {{say that}} Wessels [...] "went through a period when his temperament was totally against everything that one-day cricket stood for." [...] Wessels pointed out that he fulfilled the anchor role in the side and that it was his job to bat throughout an innings. Former Australian captain and teammate Kim Hughes, had publicly supported Wessels on this fact, saying: [...] "Kepler hits so many boundaries that he is always going to score enough runs and, even in one-day cricket, <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>someone</b> who can anchor the innings.

5000|$|The song's {{title and}} lyrics {{apparently}} {{elaborate on the}} Marxist concept that [...] "religion is the opium of the masses".

5000|$|After {{reading the}} screenplay, Mary Martin {{contacted}} Stark and proposed it be adapted for a stage musical.

5000|$|The {{song was}} {{ultimately}} {{left off the}} track listing for Adrenalize with the band preferring newly-written and recorded [...] "Have <b>You</b> Ever <b>Needed</b> <b>Someone</b> So Bad" [...] according to guitarist Phil Collen.

With skateboarding, I just pick up my board and do exactly what I want to do. Some days I have a good day and some days I feel like a complete dip-shit; like I’ve never been skateboarding in my life. I love the experience of it. I love the fact that on one day I can do everything I’ve ever learned and the next day I feel like I’ve lost everything. That’s skateboarding. It’s amazing.

Noriaka Okimura, the person who designed Doctor Lautrec, stated that, while inspired by Layton, {{it was not his}} intention to make the two look alike; he felt it would be awkward for a 19th-century gentleman to not be wearing a hat like Laytons. Kyle Gray, creator of Henry Hatsworth, was more aggressive, stating that Henry Hatsworth is the man youd call to [...] "save the world from an impending collision with an alternate dimension", while Professor Layton is the sort of person to call [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>someone</b> to find your missing cat.".|$|E

While in London the Wailers asked their road manager Brent Clarke to introduce them to Chris Blackwell, who had licensed some of their Coxsone releases for his Island Records. The Wailers intended to discuss the royalties associated with these releases; instead the meeting resulted in the offer of an advance of £4,000 to record an album. Since Jimmy Cliff, Island's top reggae star, had recently left the label, Blackwell was primed for a replacement. In Marley, Blackwell recognised the elements needed to snare the rock audience: [...] "I was dealing with rock music, which was really rebel music. I felt that would really {{be the way to}} break Jamaican music. But <b>you</b> <b>needed</b> <b>someone</b> who could be that image. When Bob walked in he really was that image."
