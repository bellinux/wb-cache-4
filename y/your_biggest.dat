500|$|... "Paparazzi" [...] is a dance-pop and techno-pop {{song with}} an uptempo, sultry beat similar to Gaga's {{previous}} singles [...] "Just Dance" [...] and [...] "Poker Face". According to the sheet music published by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, the song has a moderate electro-synth groove. It is composed {{in the key}} of C minor with a tempo of 115 beats per minute. It is set in common time, and Gaga's vocal range spans from a low-note of G3 to the high-note of E5. The verses follow in the chord progression of Cm–A–Cm and the chorus uses an A–E–Fm–D progression. The lyrics of [...] "Paparazzi" [...] deal with stalking and the trappings of fame. Gaga sings about her desire to get attention from the cameras: [...] "I'm <b>your</b> <b>biggest</b> fan/I'll follow you until you love me/Papa, paparazzi." ...|$|E
500|$|With {{an exaggerated}} and unusual batting style, Bagwell waited for each pitch {{in a low}} crouch, with legs wide open and knees bent nearly 90 degrees, {{appearing}} {{as if he was}} sitting on an invisible bench. [...] He stepped back with his front foot as he began his swing. [...] Next, he would rise from his stance and rotate his hands with the bat forward into his powerful, uppercut swing. [...] "That wide stance keeps him from over striding", Joe Torre observed, [...] "which can be <b>your</b> <b>biggest</b> problem when you’re trying to hit for power." [...] The low crouch also shrunk his strike zone, allowing him to walk more often. [...] Standing 6 feet tall (...) and weighing , he did not present the image of an imposing, home run-hitting giant that would cause pitchers to be very careful when he batted after he began his major league career.|$|E
2500|$|One {{suggested}} that a goal of interview preparation should be to present oneself as [...] "comfortable with spontaneous conversation" [...] {{and be able to}} talk about interests without sounding like the answers were prepared in advance, and suggested it was important to show intellectual passion and a love of learning with a deep excitement, and show [...] "social maturity" [...] with sensitivity, empathy for others unlike oneself, and concern for issues larger than personal career ambitions. An applicant should have an attitude that was not be what can the college offer but what can the student offer the college, and he or she should avoid asking questions about facts better answered elsewhere, and show an openness to new ideas, an ability to work cooperatively with others, ambition, and caring about others. Interviewees should be ready for sometimes provocative questions to test social sensitivity; if an interviewer asks a [...] "baiting or leading question", an applicant should respond by laughing while politely disagreeing with the perspective, and to keep trying to enjoy the conversation with the interviewer. Another advisor {{suggested that}} students must be prepared to answer the question What is <b>your</b> <b>biggest</b> failure in an interview. Applicants should avoid sounding snide, annoyed, contemptuous, and avoid describing oneself as humiliated, bored, depressed, angry, shy, inhibited, anxious, frightened, and frustrated, and should be upbeat but avoid going for the hard sell. Another report suggested that shy or timid applicants were at a disadvantage. Another advisor {{suggested that a}} student try to find a common bond with the interviewer, and send a brief follow-up letter afterwards.|$|E
5000|$|In 2009, Isime won the Miss Valentine International beauty pageant, and {{finished}} second in the Miss Telecoms Nigeria beauty contest. As a model she worked for the likes of House of Marie, Ade Bakere, Adebayo Jones, Zizi Cardow, Shakara Couture, Konga Online and others. Isime has said of her modelling: [...] "It is all about the ability to always try and to keep coming back until you get <b>your</b> <b>big</b> break. In Nigeria, modelling is not {{as it is in the}} western countries where you get <b>your</b> <b>big</b> break and that is it. Here, you can get <b>your</b> <b>big</b> break and still go back down, so it is very imperative that you get <b>your</b> <b>big</b> break and continue to work hard and continue to come back for more." ...|$|R

2500|$|There was, {{by early}} 2007, some {{perception}} that Jean's schedule was seemingly thinner {{than that of}} her predecessors; an initial explanation of fatigue was further detailed by the Secretary to the Governor General as thyroid problems, and that the vicereine's doctor had advised rest after Jean's previously hectic diary. At the same time, some in the Ottawa Press Gallery opined that Jean had on a few occasions {{in the previous year}} overstepped the boundaries of an office that was expected to remain non-partisan; journalist Chantal Hébert said that the Governor General had [...] "been wading uncommonly deep in political territory over the past few months," [...] citing Jean's criticism of Quebec sovereigntists and her expressed support for the mission of Canadian troops in Afghanistan. Further, Michael Valpy penned a piece in The Globe and Mail critiquing Jean for inviting who Valpy described as [...] "potentially politically charged individuals" [...] to post on her Citizen Voices website. Jean had also made, at the roast-like annual National Press Gallery dinner, satirical remarks about Parti Québécois leadership candidate André Boisclair's admitted cocaine use and, in a September 18, 2006 interview regarding a proposed subsidy for Canadians to travel domestically, she commented that Quebecers [...] "are sometimes very disconnected from the rest of Canada" [...] and that their isolation affected Canada's unity. Jean later clarified her opinion by adding that Canadians from all provinces were disconnected {{from other parts of the}} country, and a September 26 editorial in the Montreal Gazette supported Jean's statements on the divisions between Canada's peoples, saying that supporting national unity was a part of a governor general's mandate; but, the ire of Quebec separatist politicians was not assuaged. Further, the content of a speech by Jean to mark the 25th anniversary of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms was regarded as thinly veiled criticism of her Cabinet's decision to end the Court Challenges Program and, into 2007, it was reported that Jean's staff at Rideau Hall had been systematically removing royal portraits from the walls of the residence. All of this prompted Valpy to reveal that, early in his time as prime minister, Stephen Harper was told by Alex Himelfarb, then the Clerk of the Privy Council: [...] "Prime Minister, <b>your</b> <b>biggest</b> problem is in Rideau Hall," [...] meaning Jean and her potential to be a [...] "loose cannon".|$|E

Alone have I slain Sheeta. I am Toog. Toog wants you." [...] Then {{he waited for}} the effect, nor did he have long to wait. Teeka turned with a swiftness which belied her great weight and bolted in the opposite direction. Toog, with an angry growl, leaped in pursuit; but the smaller, lighter female was too fleet for him. He chased her for a few yards and then, foaming and barking, he halted and beat upon the ground with his hard fists.|$|E

Our friend there {{has a great deal}} to say about that too--but it didn't lead to our moving any more furniture." [...] On which he paused as to enjoy, with a show of his fine teeth, his host's reassurance. [...] "It has yet, my impression of that picture, sir, led to something else. Are you prepared, Lord Theign, to entertain a proposition?" ...|$|E

On Tuesday, you wish you hadn’t come. On Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, you wish you were dead. On Saturday, you are able to swallow a little beef tea, and to sit up on deck, and answer with a wan, sweet smile when kind-hearted people ask you how you feel now. On Sunday, you begin to walk about again, and take solid food. And on Monday morning, as, with your bag and umbrella in your hand, you stand by the gunwale, waiting to step ashore, you begin to thoroughly like it.|$|E
