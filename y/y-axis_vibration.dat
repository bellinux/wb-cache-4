40|$|Ten {{subjects}} {{performed a}} numeral reading task under five levels of sinusoidal whole-body vibralion at various frequencies {{in each of}} the three translational axes. In the z-axis the vibration frequencies were spaced at half octaves between 2 - 8 and 63 Hz, and in the x and y-axes at half octaves between 2 - 8 and 32 Hz. All of the vibration conditions were presented with two sealing conditions: hard flat seat with fixed footrcst and a simulated helicopter seat with moving footrest. With both seats the effect of vibration level on reading accuracy was found to be significant at all but the highest frequencies of z-axis vibration. It was also significant for x-axis vibration with the simulated helicopter seat, but not for x-axis vibralion with the flat seat or for <b>y-axis</b> <b>vibration</b> with either seat. Results are presented in the form of equal performance contours. Measures of translational and rotational head motion were also made for each vibration axis and seat. Very little vibration was found to be transmitted to the head during x-axis vibration with the flat seat or <b>y-axis</b> <b>vibration</b> with either seat, in agreement with the small effect of vibration on reading performance in these cases. These results were combined with performance data to investigate the feasibilily of predicting performance decrements directly from head motions. © 1980 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. </p...|$|E
40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, Ergonomics [© Taylor & Francis] and the definitive version is available at: [URL] people are exposed to whole-body vibration in many environments. This paper investigates the effects of horizontal whole-body vibration and standing posture on task performance. Sixteen participants were exposed to random vibration (up to 4 Hz), whilst performing a timed pegboard task in two standing postures. Objective and subjective indicators of performance were used. Time taken to complete the task increased progressively with increases in vibration magnitude; the fore-and-aft posture generally showed greater performance decrements and postural interruptions (> 1. 0 ms- 2 r. m. s.) than the lateral. For both postures, performance was better during <b>y-axis</b> <b>vibration</b> than during x-axis vibration. Subjective ratings showed similar trends to time data. Impairments due to dual axis exposure were well predicted using r. s. s. summation calculations based on single axis components. These results indicate that best performance for those standing in moving environments will be achieved if individuals adopt a lateral posture with the most severe vibration in the y-axis...|$|E
40|$|Real-world whole-body {{vibration}} exposures comprise {{motion in}} fore-aft, lateral and vertical directions simultaneously. There {{can also be}} components of roll, pitch and yaw. If evaluating vibration with respect to human response, most investigators will use methods defined in ISO 2631 - 1. This uses frequency weightings that were originally derived from laboratory studies of the subjective responses to vibration in one direction at a time. This paper describes experiments carried out using a 6 degree-of-freedom vibration simulator to validate the applicability of ISO 2631 - 1 in multi-axis environments. 15 subjects were exposed to 87 stimuli comprising single-axis, dual-axis and tri-axial random vibration, {{to which they were}} required to produce subjective ratings. It is shown that in this study the root-sum-of-squares method of summation of subjective ratings in individual axes was an adequate technique for prediction of subjective rating of multiaxis vibration. Better agreement between objective and subjective measures of vibration was obtained for unweighted vibration than for frequency weighted signals. The best agreement for this study was achieved when axis multiplying factors were set at 2. 2 and 2. 4 for x- and <b>y-axis</b> <b>vibration</b> respectively. Different values could be appropriate for other postures, seats, and vibration conditions and should be determined in future studies...|$|E

40|$|The {{second part}} of this study of the six axes of head motion caused by {{translational}} seat vibration {{is concerned with the}} effect of fore-and-aft (x-axis) and lateral (<b>y-axis)</b> seat <b>vibration.</b> Seat-to-head transmissibilities have been determined at frequencies up to 16 Hz {{for each of the three}} translational and three rotational axes of the head during exposure to random vibration of the seat. Repeatability measures within a single subject and studies of the variability across a group of twelve subjects have been conducted with two seating conditions: a rigid seat with a backrest, and the same seat with no backrest. Fore-and-aft seat motion mainly resulted in head motion within the mid-sagittal plane (x-z plane). Without the backrest, transmissibilities for the fore-and-aft, vertical and pitch axes of the head were greatest at about 2 Hz. The backrest greatly increased head vibration at frequencies above 4 Hz and caused a second peak in the transmissibility curves at about 6 to 8 Hz. Lateral seat motion mainly caused lateral head motion with a maximum transmissibility at about 2 Hz. The backrest had little effect on the transmission of lateral vibration to the head. For both axes of excitation inter-subject variability was much greater than intra-subject variability. © 1988. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{assessment}} of building vibration {{with respect to}} human response requires knowledge {{of the influence of}} vibration magnitude, frequency, direction, and duration. This article reports an experiment conducted to investigate the effect of three of these factors: frequency, magnitude, and direction. The method of magnitude estimation was employed with a sound reference stimulus (1 / 3 octave band centered at 1 kHz) so as to determine reaction to vertical (z-axis) and horizontal (<b>y-axis)</b> sinusoidal whole-body <b>vibration.</b> Twenty subjects were exposed to six acceleration magnitudes in the range 0. 04 - 0. 4 ms- 2 rms at nine frequencies between 4 and 63 Hz. The relation between magnitude estimate rp and acceleration magnitude q> was determined at each frequency in the psychophysical power form tft = k<p”. The value of the exponent n varied from 1. 04 to 1. 47 for vertical motion and from 0. 68 to 1. 99 for horizontal motion. For vertical motion, the effect of frequency was not significant; for horizontal motion, the exponent increased with increasing frequency. Vibration frequency weightings were determined to describe subjective response to whole-body vibration at low magnitudes that might occur in buildings. PACS numbers: 43. 40.

40|$|Abstract: The {{response}} {{characteristics of}} seated human subjects exposed to fore-aft (x-axis) and lateral (<b>y-axis)</b> <b>vibration</b> are investigated through measurements of dynamic {{interactions between the}} seated body and the seat pan, and the upper body and the seat backrest. The experiments involved: (i) three different back support conditions (no back support, and upper body supported against a vertical and an inclined backrest); (ii) three different seat pan heights (425, 390 and 350 mm); and three different magnitudes (0. 25, 0. 5 and 1. 0 m/s 2 rms acceleration) of band limited random excitations in the 0. 5 – 10 Hz frequency range, applied independently along the fore-aft and lateral directions in an uncoupled manner. The body force responses, measured at the seat pan and the backrest along the direction of motion, are applied to characterize the total body apparent mass (APMS) reflected on the seat pan, {{and those of the}} upper body reflected on the backrest. Unlike the widely reported responses of seated occupants under vertical vibration, the responses to horizontal vibration show strong effect of excitation magnitude. The large displacements at lower frequencies cause considerable rotations of the upper body, and the knees and ankles, particularly when seated without a back support, which encouraged the occupants to continually shift larger portion of the body weight towards their feet. This together with the strong dependence on the excitation magnitud...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Absorbed power {{characteristics}} of seated human subjects under fore-aft (x-axis) and lateral (<b>y-axis)</b> <b>vibration</b> are investigated through measurements of dynamic interactions {{at the two}} driving-points formed by {{the body and the}} seat pan, and upper body and the backrest. The experiments involved: (i) three back support conditions (no back support, and back supported against a vertical and an inclined backrest); (ii) three seat pan heights (425, 390 and 350 mm); and three magnitudes (0. 25, 0. 5 and 1. 0 m/s 2 rms acceleration) of band limited random excitations in 0. 5 – 10 Hz frequency range, applied independently along the x- and y- axes. The force responses, measured at the seat pan and the backrest are applied to characterize total energy transfer reflected on the seat pan and the backrest. The mean responses suggest strong contributions due to back support, and direction and magnitude of vibration. In the absence of a back support, the seat pan responses dominated in lower frequency bands centered at 0. 63 and 1. 25 Hz under both directions of motion. Most significant interactions of the upper body against the back support was observed under fore-aft vibration. The addition of back support caused the seat pan response to converge to a single primary peak near a higher frequency of 4 Hz under x-axis, with only little effect on the y-axis responses. The back support serves as an additiona...|$|E
40|$|The {{absorbed power}} (PAbs) has been {{suggested}} as a better measure of human responses to whole-body vibration, since {{it relates to the}} cumulative energy dissipated by the body exposed over a given duration. Moreover, unlike the other measures, the PAbs can adequately account for the intensity of exposure. Although, the vast majority of off-road vehicles impose considerably severe vibration along the horizontal axes, the vast majority of studies on biodynamic response characterization consider only vertical vibration. Only a few studies have reported PAbs responses of the seated human body exposed to horizontal vibration and the major contributing factors [1]. This study aims to characterize the PAbs responses of seated human subjects to horizontal (uncoupled x- and <b>y-axis)</b> <b>vibration</b> as functions of the vibration intensity, subject mass, seat height and the, type of back support. Methods Experiments were conducted using a rigid seat with an adjustable backrest inclination and seat height. The seat was installed on a horizontal vibration simulator and the forces at the seat base and the backrest were measured by three-axis force plates. Two single-axis accelerometers were installed on the seat back and the platform, oriented along the axis of motion. The experiments were performed using three different seat heights (350, 390 and 410 mm), back support conditions (NB- no back support and sitting erect; Wb 0 - Upper body supported against a vertical back support; and WbA- back supported against an inclined backrest, while sitting relaxed) and three different magnitudes of broad band excitations in the 0. 5 - 10 Hz frequency range (0. 25, 0. 5 and 1 m/s 2 rms acceleration under x-axis and y-axis, applied independently). A total of 8 healthy adult male volunteers with total body mass ranging from 59. 4 kg to 92 kg and aged between 21 - 51 years took part in the experiments. The subjects were seated with their hands in lap, and feet supported on the moving platform for each posture. Each measurement was repeated 2 times, while the data were analysed using a bandwidth of 50 Hz and frequency resolution of 0. 0625 Hz. [] The data were analyzed to derive the absorbed power characteristics of the body at both seat pan and backrest interfaces, while the coherence among the measured forces and accelerations we...|$|E
