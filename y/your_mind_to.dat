Streep has said: [...] "She was a mentor because she said to me, 'Meryl, you're capable. You're so great.' She was saying, 'You {{can do whatever you}} put <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> <b>to.</b> If you're lazy, you're not going to get it done. But if you put <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> <b>to</b> it, you can do anything.' And I believed her." [...] Although Streep was naturally more introverted than her mother, at times when she later needed an injection of confidence in adulthood, she would consult her mother, asking her for advice.|$|E
500|$|Through the story, Armstrong {{hoped to}} detail {{coming of age}} in America {{at the time of the}} album's release. While he {{considered}} their previous record heartfelt, he felt a more instinctual feeling to speak for the time period in which the album was released. He had felt the desire to increase the amount of political content in his lyricism as he grew into adulthood, noting that the [...] "climate" [...] surrounding his aging produced feelings of responsibility in the songs he wrote. Armstrong said, [...] "As soon as you abandon the verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge song structure ... it opens up <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> <b>to</b> this different way of writing, where there really are no rules." [...] In addition to the album's political content, it also touches on interpersonal relationships and what Dirnt labeled [...] "confusion and loss of individuality." ...|$|E

In December 2004, he was elected Commander of his local POW chapter, the Tidewater ex-POW Association. In 2008, he was also serving as the head of a Virginia state ex–POW association. Coker and his wife are also active in church and civic activities, such as counseling young married couples. Coker still has nightmares from his time as a POW. Reflecting on his wartime experiences in a Veterans Day tribute to POWs, he said [...] "If you're never tested, you don't know...You're capable of a great deal more than you realize, if you really set <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> <b>to</b> it. Look at me. I did it, and there's nothing special about me. I'm just another guy." [...] Coker went on to say part of that is [...] "...realizing there's something bigger than yourself..." ...|$|E
500|$|Dodd {{contributed to}} several films in which issues facing Indigenous Australians, such as land rights and race relations, were the central subjects. These {{appearances}} included Bitter Springs (mentioned above) and The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith (1978), {{the first of}} two films in which he appeared alongside Jack Thompson. Dodd played the character of Tabidgi, the uncle of the lead character, Aboriginal man Jimmie Blacksmith. In the film, Jimmie Blacksmith marries a white woman named Gilda Marshall (played by Angela Punch McGregor). When they have a baby, Dodd's character, [...] "a tribal elder,... is worried about Jimmie's marriage to a white woman and has brought him a talisman to keep him safe". Pauline Kael, writing in The New Yorker, described the performances of the two black professional actors (Jack Charles and Dodd) as [...] "wonderful as sots:... Steve Dodds , who is tried for murder and simply says, 'You'd think it would take a good while to make up <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> <b>to</b> kill someone and then to kill them, but take my word for it, it only takes a second'".|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Crosby {{insisted upon}} the {{inclusion}} of the contentious track [...] "Mind Gardens", which was disliked by the other band members and derided by McGuinn as having no [...] "rhythm, meter, or rhyme". [...] In conversation with Byrds biographer Johnny Rogan in 1980, Crosby defended the song by stating [...] "it was unusual and not everybody could understand it because they'd never heard anything like it before. At that time everything was supposed to have rhyme and have rhythm. And it neither rhymed nor had rhythm, so it was outside of their experience. It was just a little story and what it said was true ... if you build walls around <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> <b>to</b> keep out the abuse and harshness of life and the pain, then you also shut out the joy and the love." [...] Although [...] "Mind Gardens" [...] is often dismissed by critics and fans for being self-indulgent, Rogan has noted that its raga rock ambiance, symbolic lyrics and attractive backwards guitar effects capture the Byrds at their most creatively ambitious.|$|E

Tony Iommi is the king of the heavy riff." [...] former Guns N' Roses guitarist Slash said of the Paranoid album: [...] "There's just something about that whole record that, when you're a kid and you're turned onto it, it's like a whole different world. It just opens up <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> <b>to</b> another dimension...Paranoid is the whole Sabbath experience; very indicative of what Sabbath meant at the time. Tony's playing style—doesn't matter whether it's off Paranoid or if it's off Heaven and Hell—it's very distinctive."

500|$|Some critics {{had similar}} {{opinions}} about the song's meaning. Lauren Down of The Guardian expressed that [...] "Wrapped up {{in the aftermath of}} a relationship, 'Out Of Mind' [...] allows the pain of an ending love affair to breath". Mark Savage of BBC wrote that an indifferent person tells the singer that [...] "time will heal her broken heart". According to Andrew Hampp of Billboard, the singer [...] "tells off" [...] a former boyfriend for expecting her to get over quickly their former relationship. Sam Lansky of Idolator felt that the artist shows [...] "frustrated resignation" [...] while she sings the line [...] "I'll forget you, seriously". In the pre-chorus, the music vanishes and she sings [...] "Are you kidding me?". Lansky felt that the [...] "emotion" [...] on the pre-chorus was [...] "chill-inducing", while Savage wrote that [...] "it's pained and bruised and thrilling and glorious. A moment where meaning and musical intent align perfectly". In the chorus, the singer repeats the line [...] "You're out of <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> <b>to</b> think that I" [...] and later finishes it with ...|$|E
500|$|As on Mos Def's other albums, {{he spoke}} a {{dedication}} to God in Arabic ("Bismillah ar-Rahman ar-Raheem") {{at the start}} of The Ecstatic, before [...] "Supermagic" [...] began with a sample of Malcolm X's 1964 speech at Oxford Union. The sample prefaced the album's [...] "small-globe statement", Pitchfork journalist Nate Patrin explained, indicating that Mos Def had [...] "a stake in something greater than just one corner of the rap world". Alex Young from Consequence of Sound believed the speech introduced [...] "a political album encompassing global beats and viewpoints". According to Washington Post critic Allison Stewart, Mos Def seemed equally interested in the Obama-era zeitgeist and accounts of the past, such as the early-1980s Bedford–Stuyvesant setting of [...] "Life in Marvelous Times". Young deemed the song anthemic for [...] "a seemingly paradoxical age that routinely sees events such as a Black man being elected president of a nation wallowing in racial inequality". From Christgau's perspective, Mos Def offered a credo in the lyrics: [...] "More of less than ever before / It's just too much more for <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> <b>to</b> absorb / It's scary like hell, but there's no doubt / We can't be alive in no time but now".|$|E

500|$|The {{words of}} August Heinrich Hoffmann von Fallersleben {{expressed}} {{not only the}} linguistic unity of the German people but also their geographic unity. In Deutschland, Deutschland über Alles, officially called Das Lied der Deutschen ("The Song of the Germans"), Fallersleben called upon sovereigns throughout the German states to recognize the unifying characteristics of the German people. Such other patriotic songs as [...] "Die Wacht am Rhein" [...] ("The Watch on the Rhine") by Max Schneckenburger began {{to focus attention on}} geographic space, not limiting [...] "German-ness" [...] to a common language. Schneckenburger wrote [...] "The Watch on the Rhine" [...] in a specific patriotic response to French assertions that the Rhine was France's [...] "natural" [...] eastern boundary. In the refrain, [...] "Dear fatherland, dear fatherland, put <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> <b>to</b> rest / The watch stands true on the Rhine", and in such other patriotic poetry as Nicholaus Becker's [...] "Das Rheinlied" [...] ("The Rhine"), Germans were called upon to defend their territorial homeland. In 1807, Alexander von Humboldt argued that national character reflected geographic influence, linking landscape to people. Concurrent with this idea, movements to preserve old fortresses and historic sites emerged, and these particularly focused on the Rhineland, the site of so many confrontations with France and Spain.|$|E
