He {{frequently}} called Jennifer his [...] "best production". He said of fatherhood: [...] "My life changed the day Jennifer was born. I've come {{to think that the}} reason we're put on this earth is to procreate. To leave something behind. Not films, because <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> don't think my films will last very long once I'm gone. But another human being. That's what's important." [...] Grant and Cannon divorced in March 1968. On March 12 that month he was involved in a car accident on Long Island when a truck struck the side of his limousine. Grant was hospitalized for 17 days with three broken ribs and bruising.|$|E
500|$|Harrison wrote [...] "Tired of Midnight Blue" [...] in Los Angeles, {{where he}} {{continued}} to be based for much of 1975 on business relating to Dark Horse Records. In his 1980 autobiography, I, Me, Mine, {{he says that the}} song's lyrics focused on his [...] "depressed" [...] state following a night in an LA club with [...] "a lot of grey-haired naughty people". In Tillery's estimation, with its chorus line [...] "Made me chill right to the bone", [...] "Tired of Midnight Blue" [...] was Harrison reaching [...] "rock bottom". As the most obvious example of his embracing of soul music on the album, he wrote [...] "Ooh Baby (<b>You</b> <b>Know</b> <b>That</b> <b>I</b> Love You)" [...] as the first of two tributes to Smokey Robinson, a singer whose work with the Miracles he had admired since the early 1960s.|$|E

500|$|Extra Texture was {{released}} on Apple Records in September 1975, with [...] "This Guitar (Can't Keep from Crying)" [...] sequenced as the third track, between [...] "The Answer's at the End" [...] and Harrison's Smokey Robinson tribute [...] "Ooh Baby (<b>You</b> <b>Know</b> <b>That</b> <b>I</b> Love You)". Aside from the well-received lead single, [...] "You", the album offered {{little in the way}} of [...] "hook-laden potential hit", author Bruce Spizer writes, leading to [...] "This Guitar" [...] being chosen as the follow-up single. Apple issued the single on 8 December in America, with the Apple catalogue number 1885. For this release, the song was edited down to a running time of 3:49, by fading out early during the closing solo. The B-side was the Dark Horse track [...] "Māya Love", a choice that underlined the paucity of radio-friendly selections on Extra Texture, according to Spizer. The single's UK release (as Apple R 6012) was delayed until 6 February 1976.|$|E
500|$|According to Houston, {{the song}} was direct, so she wanted the video to be direct and {{concentrate}} {{on her face and}} on the lyrics. Whitaker also expressed a same opinion of the song. He said, [...] "I've seen the video [...] It's like a thing she has, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> guess people would say is like a charisma kinda thing that it zooms, you know, comes up. It's beautiful [...] It's magic, it's spirit." [...] The video aired on MTV on October 10, 1995. According to Marla Shelton, a writer for Camera Obscura, a journal of feminism and film theory, [...] "the video concept's originality stops with Houston's hair style as its stark simplicity underscores the 'straight and narrow' politics of the film." [...] When the film was released, the video was shown as a trailer prior to the beginning of films on 450 General Cinema screens in some major US media markets.|$|E

According to the sheet music {{published}} at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, [...] "Bad Romance" [...] {{is set in}} common time with a metronome of 119 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of A minor, with Gaga's vocal range spanning from the low-note of E3 to the high-note of C5. The song follows in the chord progression of Am–C–F–C–G in the verses and F–G–Am–C–F–G–E–Am in the chorus. The song opens with Gaga singing {{a portion of the}} chorus, then transitioning into the [...] "Rah-rah--ah-ah-ah, Roma-roma-ma, Gaga-ooh-la-la" [...] hook, which—according to an interview Gaga gave for the Carpool Karaoke segment of The Late Late Show with James Corden in 2016—is an abbreviation of the word [...] "romance". It is followed by the sound of drum beats and keyboards. After the first verse, the pre-chorus follows, with Gaga voicing the lines, [...] "You know that I want you, And <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> need you, I want your bad, your bad romance". The full-throated chorus then follows, where she sings, [...] "I want your love, And I want your revenge, You and me could write a bad romance ... Caught in a bad romance".|$|E

[...] At 10 AM on 9 May 1915 Cros' brigade advanced in conjunction with the division's 1st Brigade, a French Foreign Legion unit led by Colonel Pein. [...] The five-hour preliminary bombardment was largely ineffective and the division took heavy casualties in reaching the German lines, [...] distant. [...] However they managed to push the Germans out and some units even reached the villages of Vimy and Givenchy-en-Gohelle. [...] The next morning, hit by their own artillery and under German counter-attack, the French were forced to withdraw to their own lines in the course of which Cros was killed. [...] Cros was one of almost 2,000 men of the Moroccan division killed in that action, as was fellow brigade commander Colonel Pein.|$|E

2500|$|In Britain, {{the book}} {{did much to}} promote Americans as {{legitimate}} writers, and their work as legitimate literature — a concept that surprised English critics.

"Ooh Baby (<b>You</b> <b>Know</b> <b>That</b> <b>I</b> Love You)" [...] {{is a song}} by English {{musician}} George Harrison, {{released in}} 1975 on his album Extra Texture (Read All About It). Harrison wrote the composition {{as a tribute to}} American singer Smokey Robinson, whom he often identified as one of his favourite vocalists and songwriters. The song was intended as a companion piece to Robinson's 1965 hit with the Miracles, [...] "Ooo Baby Baby", and its inclusion on Extra Texture contributed to that album's standing as Harrison's soul music album. His impersonation of Robinson's celebrated vocal style on the track, including portions sung in falsetto, contrasted with Harrison's hoarse, laryngitis-marred singing on his 1974 North American tour and the poorly received Dark Horse album.|$|E
2500|$|... "Pure Smokey" [...] {{is a song}} by English {{musician}} George Harrison, {{released in}} 1976 on his debut album for Dark Horse Records, Thirty Three & 1/3.

Harrison frequently cited Robinson {{as one of his}} favourite vocalists and songwriters, and Robinson's group the Miracles had similarly influenced the Beatles during the 1960s. In the lyrics to [...] "Pure Smokey", Harrison gives thanks for the gift of Robinson's music, while making a statement regarding the importance of expressing appreciation and gratitude, rather than forgetting to do so and later regretting it. The song title came from the name of Robinson's 1974 album Pure Smokey.|$|E
