2500|$|The initial run {{lasted for}} 14 performances, {{making a profit}} for the Opéra-Comique. It became a staple part in the {{repertory}} of the theatre, reaching its hundredth performance there on 25January 1913. In 1908, Maggie Teyte took {{over the role of}} Mélisande from Mary Garden. She described Debussy's reaction on learning her nationality: [...] "Une autre anglaiseMon Dieu" [...] ("Another Englishwomanmy God"). Teyte also wrote about the composer's perfectionist character and his relations with the cast:As a teacher he was pedanticthat's the only word. Really pedantic [...] There was a core of anger and bitterness in himI often think he was rather like Golaud in Pelléas and yet he wasn't. He wasit's in all his musica very sensual man. No one seemed to like him. Jean Périer, who played Pelléas to my Mélisande, went white with anger if <b>you</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>the</b> name of Debussy...Debussy's perfectionismplus his dislike of the attendant publicitywas {{one of the reasons why}} he rarely attended performances of Pelléas et Mélisande. However, he did supervise the first foreign production of the opera, which appeared at the Théâtre de la Monnaie, Brussels on 9 January 1907. This was followed by foreign premieres in Frankfurt on 19 April of the same year, New York City at the Manhattan Opera House on 19February 1908, and at La Scala, Milan with Arturo Toscanini conducting on 2 April 1908. It first appeared in the United Kingdom at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden on 21 May 1909.|$|E

60|$|Your {{discourse}} therefore, of {{the life}} and conversation of the Lord Jesus, {{is none other than}} heathenish: For you neither treat of the principle, his Godhead, by which he did his works; neither do you in the least, in one syllable, aver the first, the main and prime reason of this his conversation; only you treat of it so far, as a mean man might have considered it. And indeed it stood not with your design to treat aright with these things; for had <b>you</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>the</b> first, though but once, your Babel had tumbled about your ears; for if in the holy Jesus did 'dwell the word,' one of the three in heaven; or if the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ was truly, essentially, and naturally God; then must the principle from whence his works did proceed, be better than the principle from whence proceeded the goodness in Adam; otherwise Adam must be God and man. Also you do, or may know that the self-same act may be done from several principles: and again, that it is the principle from whence the act is done, and not the bare doing of the act, that makes it better or worse accepted, in the eyes either of God or men.|$|E

You know the Indian way, Mr. Trail?" [...] And here the Captain passed his hand rapidly round his head. [...] "Horrible! ain't it, sir? horrible! He was a fine young man, the very picture of this one; only his hair was black, which is now hanging in a bloody Indian wigwam. He was often and often on board of the Young Rachel, and would have his chests of books broke open on deck before they was landed. He was a shy and silent young gent: not like this one, which was the merriest, wildest young fellow, full of his songs and fun. He took on dreadful at the news; went to his bed, had that fever which lays so many of 'em by the heels along that swampy Potomac, but he's got better on the voyage: the voyage makes every one better; and, in course, the young gentleman can't be for ever a-crying after a brother who dies and leaves him a great fortune. Ever since we sighted Ireland he has been quite gay and happy, only he would go off at times, when he was most merry, saying, 'I wish my dearest Georgy could enjoy this here sight along with me, and when <b>you</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>the</b> t'other's name, you see, he couldn't stand it.'"

6000|$|... "Even such {{a trifle}} {{as my own}} story," [...] she said, [...] "is of some {{importance}} at such a moment as this. I wish you both, gentlemen, to understand that I am not promising more to the daughters of your old friend than I can perform. When I first came to this house, I entered it under such independent circumstances as are not common {{in the lives of}} governesses. In my younger days, I was associated in teaching with my elder sister: we established a school in London, which grew to be a large and prosperous one. I only left it, and became a private governess, because the heavy responsibility of the school was more than my strength could bear. I left my share in the profits untouched, and I possess a pecuniary interest in our establishment to this day. That is my story, in few words. When we leave this house, I propose that we shall go back to the school in London, which is still prosperously directed by my elder sister. We can live there as quietly as we please, until time has helped us to bear our affliction better than we can bear it now. If Norah's and Magdalen's altered prospects oblige them to earn their own independence, I can help them to earn it, as a gentleman's daughters should. The best families in this land are glad to ask my sister's advice where the interests of their children's home-training are concerned; and I answer, beforehand, for her hearty desire to serve Mr. Vanstone's daughters, as I answer for my own. That is the future which my gratitude to their father and mother, and my love for themselves, now offers to them. If you think my proposal, gentlemen, a fit and fair proposal--and I see in your faces that you do--let us not make the hard necessities of our position harder still, by any useless delay in meeting them at once. Let us do what we must do; let us act on Norah's decision, and leave this house to-morrow. <b>You</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>the</b> servants just now, Mr. Pendril: I am ready to call them together in the next room, and to assist you in the settlement of their claims, whenever you please." ...|$|E
6000|$|I have a {{long story}} {{to tell you about}} Bailey--I will say first the {{circumstances}} as plainly and as well as I can remember, and then I will make my comment. You know that Bailey was very much cut up about a little Jilt in the country somewhere. I thought he was in a dying state about it when at Oxford with him: little supposing, as I have since heard, that he was at that very time making impatient Love to Marian Reynolds--and guess my astonishment at hearing after this that he had been trying at Miss Martin. So Matters have been--So Matters stood--when he got ordained and went to a Curacy near Carlisle, where the family of the Gleigs reside. There his susceptible heart was conquered by Miss Gleig--and thereby all his connections in town have been annulled--both male and female. I do not now remember clearly the facts--These however I know--He showed his correspondence with Marian to Gleig, returned all her Letters and asked for his own--he also wrote very abrupt Letters to Mrs. Reynolds. I do not know any more of the Martin affair than I have written above. No doubt his conduct has been very bad. The great thing to be considered is--whether it is want of delicacy and principle or want of knowledge and polite experience. And again weakness--yes, that is it; and the want of a Wife--yes, that is it; and then Marian made great Bones of him although her Mother and sister have teased her very much about it. Her conduct has been very upright throughout the whole affair--She liked Bailey as a Brother but not as a Husband--especially as he used to woo her with the Bible and Jeremy Taylor under his arm--they walked in no grove but Jeremy Taylor's. Marian's obstinacy is some excuse, but his so quickly taking to Miss Gleig can have no excuse--except that of a Ploughman who wants a wife. The thing which sways me more against him than anything else is Rice's conduct on the occasion; Rice would not make an immature resolve: he was ardent in his friendship for Bailey, he examined the whole for and against minutely; and he has abandoned Bailey entirely. All this I am not supposed by the Reynoldses to have any hint of. It will be a good lesson to the Mother and Daughters--nothing would serve but Bailey. If <b>you</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>the</b> word Tea-pot some one of them came out with an à propros about Bailey--noble fellow--fine fellow! was always in their mouths--This may teach them that the man who ridicules romance is the most romantic of Men--that he who abuses women and slights them loves them the most--that he who talks of roasting a Man alive would not do it {{when it came to the}} push--and above all, that they are very shallow people who take everything literally. A Man's life of any worth is a continual allegory, and very few eyes can see the Mystery of his life--a life like the scriptures, figurative--which such people can no more make out than they can the Hebrew Bible. Lord Byron cuts a figure but he is not figurative--Shakspeare led a life of Allegory: his works are the comments on it-- ...|$|E
