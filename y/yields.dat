5|$|In {{addition}} to ripeness levels, the harvest <b>yields</b> {{can also have}} a strong influence in the resulting quality and flavors of Cabernet Sauvignon wine. The vine itself is prone to vigorous <b>yields,</b> particularly when planted on the vigorous SO4 rootstock. Excessive <b>yields</b> can result in less concentrated and flavorful wine with flavors more on the green or herbaceous side. In the 1970s, a particular clone of Cabernet Sauvignon that was engineered to be virus free was noted for its very high yields-causing many quality conscious producers to replant their vineyards in the late 20th century with different clonal varieties. To reduce <b>yields,</b> producers can plant the vines on less vigorous rootstock and also practice green harvesting with aggressive pruning of grape clusters soon after veraison.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Consistent spatial–temporal <b>yield</b> {{patterns}} {{should help}} determine spatial production potential. Our {{objective was to}} evaluate methods for using <b>yield</b> monitor data to develop spatial <b>yield</b> goal maps. Three to seven years of <b>yield</b> monitor data were analyzed for five sprinkler–irrigated cornfields in central and western Kansas. <b>Yield</b> data were block–averaged to 55 m square cells, normalized based on the mean <b>yield,</b> and then used to develop spatial <b>yield</b> goals for subsequent years using six different methods. One method used a uniform <b>yield</b> goal, two methods combined normalized <b>yield</b> monitor data with a uniform <b>yield</b> goal (transitional), and three methods used only normalized <b>yield</b> monitor data from previous years. Methods were evaluated based {{on their ability to}} predict the spatial <b>yield</b> pattern of the subsequent year better than the uniform method. <b>Yield</b> monitor data were also segregated based on the temporal CV of each field {{during the time of the}} study, and the six methods were evaluated only on the data that were deemed temporally stable. The result of incorporating <b>yield</b> monitor data into <b>yield</b> goals was inconsistent across sites and years. For one site, the two transitional and three <b>yield</b> monitor methods were significantly better predictors of normalized <b>yield.</b> On another field, the uniform method was a better predictor of normalized <b>yield</b> than the <b>yield</b> monitor methods in three of six years, while the <b>yield</b> monitor methods were better than the uniform method in another year.
