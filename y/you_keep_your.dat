500|$|In December 1997, Southall went to Alvin Martin's Southend United of the Second Division on loan. He made 9 {{appearances}} {{in a brief}} stay at Roots Hall. He joined Chris Kamara's First Division Stoke City in February 1998. Kamara resigned two months later, and caretaker-manager Alan Durban pulled Southall aside {{on his first day}} in charge to say [...] "I'll let you manage the reserves, so long as <b>you</b> <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> head down, do whatever I tell you, and I won't tell everybody you're a bad influence". Southall was shocked by Durban's words and could not explain his attitude. Both Southend and Stoke would end the season bottom of their respective divisions and Everton only avoided relegation {{on the last day of}} the season. He left the Britannia Stadium in the summer, and later said [...] "one of the worst episodes of my life had drawn to a close".|$|E

2500|$|When {{explaining}} {{the meaning of}} [...] "Revelation Song", Randy Phillips stated that it “captures the moment of looking up into Heaven, peeling back the curtain of eternity so we can peek in. If <b>you</b> <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> eyes on the Dow Jones or nuclear weapons in North Korea, you’ll always be nervous. Look to the awesomeness of God instead.” The song was written by Jennie Lee Riddle.|$|E

2500|$|Barbara Shulgasser of the San Francisco Examiner {{called the}} movie [...] "idiotic" [...] {{and argued that}} [...] "a good {{director}} would choose {{the best of the}} six ways and put it in his movie.

If <b>you</b> <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> eyes closed during a Woo movie and open them every six minutes, you'll see {{everything you need to know}} to have a perfectly lovely evening at the cinema." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{the speech}} Obama {{and his wife}} were interviewed by Brian Williams, and when asked about what she thought, Michelle replied, [...] "And all I have to say is, honey, you didn't screw it up, so good job." [...] Obama said that he hoped his two daughters had watched the whole event, as their baby-sitter was {{permitted}} to let them stay up only if they watched the convention. Obama's grandmother, Madelyn Dunham, called Obama after the speech and told him, [...] "You did well...I just kind of worry about you. I hope <b>you</b> <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> head on straight." [...] She was later quoted by a journalist: [...] "I was a little amazed. It was really quite an exceptional speech, or I'm being prejudiced, I don't know. But, to me, it was really quite exceptional." ...|$|E
2500|$|We heard {{something}} was wrong with my dad during the [...] World Cup. He started feeling unwell and then, out of the blue, we were told he only had a few months to live. It was a huge shock because we've always been a very close family. I missed the first couple of Tests in England that year so I could be at home with him. It was obviously the saddest time of my life but those last weeks were maybe some of the most beautiful. It {{gave me a chance to}} say thank you and goodbye. After a while I realised how lucky I was to do that. It's far harder if a parent is taken away before you have that time together. So his death put cricket in perspective for me. It's just a game – and a very simple game if <b>you</b> <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> mind straight.|$|E

2500|$|O'Neal's comedy {{has been}} {{described}} as conversational. He was a provocateur, often inciting audience members to call out, or even leave the club. [...] "I've seen him give people money to leave," [...] recalls Gregg [...] "Opie" [...] Hughes. At times he would encourage people to call out to the stage in order to set up a punchline. [...] "Ladies, how would <b>you</b> <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> man if you lost your vagina?," [...] O'Neal would ask of his audience. When the women would invariably reference oral and anal sex, the comedian would respond, [...] "See, I gave you the chance to talk and you qualified yourself as a series of holes." [...] Additionally, speaking on sex he on several occasions discussed his personal kinks; for instance an appreciation for urolagnia, even stating that his girlfriend noticing that his urine tasted like [...] "birthday cake" [...] is how he came to find out that he suffered from diabetes.|$|E
2500|$|IGN's Douglass C. Perry {{scored the}} PlayStation 2 and Xbox {{versions}} 8.3 out of 10. Although he {{was critical of}} the scripted nature of the infection system, he concluded [...] "the deeper you play, the more satisfying and challenging it becomes, and the more it draws you in. The Thing is well-paced, designed with an excellent variety of levels [...] Everything {{is consistent with the}} movie, the theme of which has been handled with exquisite care and thought. With the exception of the blood test goofs and the rather thin storyline, The Thing warrants your time and money." [...] Steve Polak scored the PC version 8.5 out of 10, writing [...] "The Thing is for the most part an immersive and enjoyable game. The visuals and sound are top notch and the sense of desperation you feel when you are stuck outside and about to succumb to the elements or being hunted by packs of the foul creatures is very real. The squad based elements and the way <b>you</b> <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> men from losing their minds also adds to the depth of the play experience." ...|$|E
