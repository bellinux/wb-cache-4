500|$|Stump and Wentz met up for {{the first}} time in several years in early 2012 for a writing session. Wentz reached out to Stump after he penned his letter, as he too felt he was in a dark place and needed a {{creative}} outlet. He was at first reluctant to approach Stump, likening the phone call to reconnecting with a lover after years of acrimony. [...] "I know what you need – <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>your</b> band," [...] Wentz told Stump. [...] "I think it's kind of weird that we haven't really seen each other this year. We paid for each other's houses and you don't know my kid," [...] Wentz remarked. The result, [...] "three or four" [...] new songs, were shelved with near immediacy, with the two concluding that [...] "it just wasn't right and didn't feel right." [...] Several months later, the two reconvened and wrote tracks that they felt truly represented the band in a modern form. The band decided that if a comeback was in order, it must represent the band in its current form: [...] "We didn't want to come back just to bask in the glory days and, like, and collect a few checks and pretend ... and do our best 2003 impersonation," [...] said Stump. Afterwards, the quartet held an all-day secret meeting at their manager's home in New York City where they discussed ideas and the mechanics of getting together to record. Trohman was the last to be contacted, through a three-hour phone call from Stump. As Trohman was arguably the most excited to begin other projects, he had a list of stipulations for rejoining the band. [...] "If I'm not coming back to this band writing music [...] then I don't want to," [...] he remarked. Stump supported Trohman's ambition saying Trohman [...] "needed to be writing more." ...|$|E

2500|$|GameSpy's William Abner scored it 75 out of 100, {{writing that}} the game [...] "isn't a {{complete}} product. It's close. And parts of it are just as fun, if not more so, than the earlier games, but {{a laundry list of}} bugs, hardware glitches, and severe multiplayer issues keep the game from reaching its potential." [...] He praised the single-player campaign and the storyline. However, he cited numerous bugs, including no support for Windows 95, despite the box claiming otherwise, and compatibility issues with Windows XP. He was also critical of the absence of Vengeance, despite the box stating it was included, and the fact that multiplayer mode had only five maps and no TCP/IP support. He concluded [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>your</b> new Myth fix and can't wait for a patch, then the best option is to buy the game from a store that accepts returns in case the game doesn't like your particular system setup. If you can play it, focus your efforts on the campaign - it's fun, {{and for the most part}} works as advertised. Hopefully, by the time you are finished with Connacht's tale, a patch to fix the many multiplayer issues will be ready." ...|$|E

While Joli OS is not the first operating system designed from Linux targeted at the beginning netbooks, [...] "it's the first that doesn't feel like you're using Linux: no funky install procedures, no code, no accessing special directories to find more apps."

The Famine Reaction is activated whenever your weight drops below a certain threshold. It triggers the nagging hunger and cravings for fattening foods that you've no doubt experienced {{while trying to}} lose weight in the past. The Famine Reaction also causes dramatic reductions in your metabolic rate and contributes to plateaus and rapid rebound weight gain. Your body not only has a Famine Reaction that protects you from losing weight, it also has an ingenious mechanism - the Fat Brake - that helps protect you from gaining weight. Whenever you eat more than <b>you</b> <b>need,</b> <b>your</b> Fat Brake blunts your appetite (notably your appetite for fattening foods) and boosts your metabolic rate.|$|E

5000|$|Syntactic {{ambiguity}} {{arises when}} a sentence can have two (or more) different meanings {{because of the}} structure of the sentence—its syntax. This is often due to a modifying expression, such as a prepositional phrase, the application of which is unclear. [...] "He ate the cookies on the couch", for example, could mean that he ate those cookies that were on the couch (as opposed to those that were on the table), or it could mean that he was sitting on the couch when he ate the cookies.
