500|$|Writing in The Times, Caitlin Moran {{said that}} the Doctor's homily to music and {{self-expression}} was [...] "the most affecting moment" [...] in the Prom, bringing [...] "what {{could have been a}} wonderful, yet surreal and overwhelming introduction to orchestral music" [...] down to [...] "a rather lovely question. Did <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> orchestra, kids? What would you do with one?" ...|$|E
500|$|The song {{opens with}} the main melody from the Hungarian piece [...] "Csárdás" [...] by Italian {{composer}} Vittorio Monti played on violin, as a distressed Gaga (speaking in a Spanish accent) states: [...] "I {{know that we are}} young, and I know that you may love me/But I just can't be with <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> anymore, Alejandro." [...] The track then changes to a stomping Europop beat. Gaga bids her ex-lovers farewell with a bitter-hearted pre-chorus where she sings: [...] "You know that I love you, boy/Hot like Mexico, rejoice!/At this point I've got to choose/Nothing to lose." [...] By the end of the song, the three protagonists – Alejandro, Fernando, and Roberto – are bidden farewell by Gaga.|$|E
500|$|The female protagonist sings how {{she will}} dance for a man, {{while he is}} filming her with his videophone, this being {{illustrated}} in the line, [...] "Press 'record' and I'll let you film me", and [...] "You want me naked? If <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> position you can tape it". According to James Reed of The Boston Globe the lines [...] "What? You want me naked/ If you likin' this position, you can tape it" [...] are sung with an accent which was [...] "part Long Island, part Barbados". Michaelangelo Matos of The A.V. Club commented that [...] "Video Phone" [...] {{is very similar to}} Missy Elliott's songs. Rolling Stones Christian Hoard and The Washington Posts J. Freedom du Lac found similarities between [...] "Video Phone" [...] and the songs by rock band Nine Inch Nails. San Francisco Chronicles Aidin Vaziri noted that the song sounded like it was swiped from Björk.|$|E

500|$|The song {{received}} mixed reviews. [...] Alexis Petridis from The Guardian {{compared the}} song to [...] "Diva", stating that [...] "Video Phone" [...] is [...] "Almost equally weird, but much better, [...] introduces {{us to the}} unlikely figure of Beyoncé Knowles, amateur pornographer: 'You want me naked? If <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> position you can tape it.' She doesn't make for the world's most believable Reader's Wife, but it doesn't matter, because the spare, eerie backdrop of groans and echoing electronics is so thrilling." [...] A writer of Rolling Stone said that Knowles sings in a [...] "dirty groove on the slippery" [...] song. Colin Mcguire from PopMatters wrote that [...] "'Video Phone' is sexy enough {{to the point where}} it almost becomes uncomfortable to think of her listening back to this with her father in the room." [...] Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine commented that the song ended the album abruptly. Daniel Brockman of The Phoenix noted that the song was [...] "smutty" [...] for an artist like Knowles. J. Freedom du Lac of The Washington Post chose the song as a highlight on I Am... Sasha Fierce saying, [...] "The moaning, groaning 'Video Phone' positions Beyoncé as the star of a sex tape set to a thrillingly spare soundtrack that sounds like a Nine Inch Nails instrumental." [...] A negative review for the song was given by Bernard Zuel of The Sydney Morning Herald who described it as [...] "awful".|$|E
500|$|The Beatles were {{performing}} at Liverpool's Cavern Club in November 1961 {{when they were}} introduced to Brian Epstein after a midday concert. Epstein was a homosexual, and according to biographer Philip Norman, one of Brian's reasons for wanting to manage the group {{was that he was}} physically attracted to Lennon. Almost as soon as Julian was born, Lennon went on holiday to Spain with Epstein, leading to speculation about their relationship. When he was later questioned about it, Lennon said, [...] "Well, it was almost a love affair, but not quite. It was never consummated. But it was a pretty intense relationship. It was my first experience with a homosexual that I was conscious was homosexual. We used to sit in a café in Torremolinos looking at all the boys and I'd say, 'Do you like that one? Do <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> one?' I was rather enjoying the experience, thinking like a writer all the time: I am experiencing this." [...] Soon after their return from Spain—at McCartney's twenty-first birthday party in June 1963—Lennon physically attacked Cavern Club Master of ceremonies Bob Wooler for saying [...] "How was your honeymoon, John?" [...] The MC, known for his wordplay and affectionate but cutting remarks, was making a joke, but ten months had passed since Lennon's marriage, and the deferred honeymoon was still two months in the future. To Lennon, who was drunk at the time, the matter was simple: [...] "He called me a queer so I battered his bloody ribs in".|$|E
500|$|Swift became {{inspired}} to write [...] "You Belong with Me" [...] after she overheard a male {{friend of hers}} speaking to his girlfriend through a phone call. He acted defensive as his girlfriend yelled at him, and said to her, [...] "No, baby...I had {{to get off the}} phone really quickly... I tried to call you right back... Of course I love you. More than anything! Baby, I’m so sorry." [...] Out of the sympathy she felt towards him in the situation, Swift developed a concept for a song. In a writing session with co-writer Liz Rose, Swift explained the situation along with her idea and conceived the song's opening line, [...] "You’re on the phone with your girlfriend / she’s upset / she's going off about something that you said." [...] Together, they developed a story line, which described Swift being in love with the male friend and her having the desire for him to break up with his current girlfriend for her. Swift described the song's concept as [...] "basically about wanting someone who is with this girl who doesn't appreciate him at all. Basically like 'girl-next-door-itis.' <b>You</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> guy who you have known for your whole life, and you know him better than she does but somehow the popular girl gets the guy every time." [...] Swift recalled, [...] "It was really fun for us to write the line, 'She wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts'." [...] "You Belong with Me" [...] was first released as a promotional single from Fearless on November 4, 2008, as part of Countdown to Fearless, an exclusive campaign by the iTunes Store; the song was then released as the third single from Fearless on April 18, 2009.|$|E

2500|$|Penniman was 18 when Ethan Allen, {{liberated from}} the Tower of London, {{returned}} to his native State. [...] "I should like," [...] said Penniman, one evening in a mixed company in her step-father's parlor, [...] "above all things to see this Mr. Allen, of whom we hear such incredible things." [...] This saying reached the ears of Allen, who soon after {{paid a visit to}} the house of Mr. Wall, and was introduced to Penniman. There was a mutual and agreeable surprise, both manifestly pleased with the tone of thought and conversation, which ran on with a natural flow, and developed traits of kindred sympathies of intellect and feeling. It was late in the evening before Mr. Allen rose. He had not failed to observe the interest his conversation had excited in Penniman. [...] "And now," [...] said he, as he stood erect before her, and was about to depart—" [...] and now, Miss Brush, allow me to ask, how do <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> Mr. Allen?'" ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 2004, the Washington Post {{reported}} evidence given by Ameen Saeed Al-Sheik, detainee No. 151362. It quoted him as saying; [...] "They said {{we will make}} you wish to die {{and it will not}} happen [...] They stripped me naked. One of them told me he would rape me. He drew a picture of a woman to my back and made me stand in shameful position holding my buttocks." [...] "'Do you pray to Allah?' one asked. I said yes. They said, ' you. And [...] him.' One of them said, 'You are not getting out of here health, you are getting out of here handicapped. And he said to me, 'Are you married?' I said, 'Yes.' They said, 'If your wife saw <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> she will be disappointed.' One of them said, 'But if I saw her now she would not be disappointed now because I would rape her.'

2500|$|Dimmu Borgir's older {{releases}} (since 1994 to 1999) are, {{according to}} Allmusic journalist Bradley Torreano, {{strongly influenced by}} Darkthrone, Mayhem, Bathory, Emperor, Celtic Frost, Immortal, Venom and Iron Maiden. The band became more progressive and symphonic through the years; many black metal purists consider the band's second album, Stormblåst, to be [...] "the act's last true contribution to black metal". Enthrone Darkness Triumphant, Dimmu Borgir's third album, [...] "distinguished itself in two important areas, firstly forgoing their native language for English and secondly for its dramatic increase in synthesizer content". Significant experimentation started c. 2000, during the era of Spiritual Black Dimensions (due to the addition of Vortex's clean vocals, and the variety of musical ideas from then-new member Mustis), as well as Puritanical Euphoric Misanthropia due to addition of influences from composers such as Antonín Dvořák, Enya, Richard Wagner and Frédéric Chopin. As the music strongly differed from the older, rawer black metal style, Jon [...] "Metalion" [...] Kristiansen called Spiritual Black Dimensions [...] "a fine case of melodic, over-produced symphonic metal. If <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> melodic style I can't really think of anyone doing it better [...] No, I wouldn't call this black metal. Read the interview with Funeral Mist for the right definition of black metal." ...|$|E
