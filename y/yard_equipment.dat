5000|$|The fully functional, albeit small, engines {{vary from}} the most common single-cylinder {{two-stroke}} to the exotic single and multiple-cylinder four-stroke, the latter taking shape in boxer, v-twin, inline and radial form, a few Wankel engine designs are also used. Most model engines run on a blend of methanol, nitromethane, and lubricant (either castor or synthetic oil). Two-stroke model engines, most often designed since 1970 with Schnuerle porting for best performance, range in typical size from [...]12 cubic inches (2 cubic centimeters) to 1.2 ci (19.6 cc) and generate between [...]5 horsepower (370 watts) to 5 hp (3.7 kW), can get as small as [...]010 ci (.16 cc) and as large as 3-4 ci (49-66 cc). Four-stroke model engines {{have been made in}} sizes as small as 0.20 in3 (3.3 cc) for the smallest single-cylinder models, {{all the way up to}} 3.05 in3 (50 cc) for the largest size for single-cylinder units, with twin- and multi-cylinder engines on the market being as small as 10 cc for opposed-cylinder twins, while going somewhat larger in size than 50 cc, and even upwards to well above 200 cc for some model radial engines. While the methanol and nitromethane blended [...] "glow fuel" [...] engines are the most common, many larger (especially above 15 cc/0.90 ci displacement) model engines, both two-stroke and a growing number of four-stroke examples are spark ignition, and are primarily fueled with gasoline — with some examples of both two and four-stroke glow plug-designed methanol aeromodeling engines capable, with aftermarket upgrades, to having battery-powered, electronically controlled spark ignition systems replacing the glow plugs normally used. Model engines refitted in such a manner often run more efficiently on methanol-based glow plug engine fuels, often with the ability to exclude the use of nitromethane altogether in their fuel formulas. This article concerns itself with the methanol engines; gasoline-powered model engines are similar to those built for use in string trimmers, chainsaws, and other <b>yard</b> <b>equipment,</b> unless they happen to be purpose-built for aeromodeling use, being especially true for four-stroke gasoline-fueled model engines. Such engines usually use a fuel that contains a small percentage of motor oil as a two-stroke engine uses for lubrication purposes, as most model four-stroke engines — be they glow plug or spark ignition — have no built-in reservoir for motor oil in their crankcase or engine block design.|$|E

30|$|It is {{anticipated}} that Malaysia’s ports, {{such as the}} Port Klang, Johor Port and Port of Tanjung Pelepas, will lose ship calls and traffic volume, which will lead to significant losses in port business due to the Kra Canal.

The objective {{of this paper is}} to analyse the relative efficiency of operations in container terminals of Mercosur in the years of 2002, 2003 and 2004, using the data envelopment analysis technique in a model BCC, with five inputs (number of cranes, number of berths, number of employees, terminal area, amount of <b>yard</b> <b>equipment)</b> and two outputs (TEUs handled and average number of containers handled per hour/ship). The units of analysis are 15 Brazilian, six Argentinean and two Uruguayan container terminals. The analysis shows that 60 % of the terminals were efficient in the 3 -year period.

30|$|The rail segment {{offers the}} best {{opportunity}} for vessel sharing agreement (VSA) collaboration. Both on and off dock rail operations suffer from inefficiencies born {{of the need to}} effectively share limited terminal resources, in terms of <b>yard</b> <b>equipment</b> and yard and track space. For on- terminal rail operations, improvement can be achieved, as shown in Fig. 1 b, by each VSA selecting a single rail carrier so that the on-terminal track capacity can be allocated to coincide with a particular vessel’s discharge operations. By doing so, no cargo will be delayed waiting for a second rail carrier’s train to arrive on the facility to find that it is only blocked by the first rail carrier’s train. Off terminal, the issue is further complicated by the competitive environment in port drayage and the scale of these carriers, who are potentially unable to provide the number of tractors required to move a large amount of cargo in a limited amount of time. This issue cannot be immediately solved by the VSA selecting multiple motor carriers as {{it will be difficult to}} align the purchase order and payment process. The MTO may contract this work on the VSA’s behalf, if only to provide a common billing platform between alliance partners and marine terminal service providers.|$|E
40|$|Planning of Container Terminal {{equipment}} {{has always}} been uncertain due to seasonal and fluctuating throughput demand, along with factors of delay in operation, breakdown and maintenance. Many timeseries models {{have been developed to}} forecast the unforeseen future of container throughput to project the needed amount of port equipments for optimum operation. Conventionally, a "ratio" method developed by port consultants at early port design stage is adopted for equipment planning, giving no consideration to the dynamic growth of the port in terms of improved layout and technological advancement in equipments. This study seeks first to enhance the empirical approach of the equipment planning at the end of planning time horizon by including assumed coefficient of port capacity parameters. The second is to compare the size of equipment purchase by receiving different terminal's future throughput demand from two univariate forecasting models at planning time horizon. The empirical method of equipment planning will be tested against the conventional <b>yard</b> <b>equipment</b> per quay crane ratio after deriving the throughput demand from forecasting models of Holt-Winter's exponential smoothing and seasonal ARIMA (autoregression integrated moving average) model.
