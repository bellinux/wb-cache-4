500|$|The {{scene where}} Stefani's stunt double falls {{surprised}} critics at first, with many {{thinking that the}} fall was real. Delbyck called the stunt [...] "confusing", but [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>closely</b> right before the fall, however, Stefani leaves the screen {{for a couple of}} seconds" [...] (allowing her to change before the final scene). Calling the video [...] "colorful", Justin Harp of Digital Spy enjoyed the stunt-double [...] "trickery". The Michigan Daily Kennedy described the video as [...] "a brightly colored beacon of hope for continued experimentation in popular music". According to Erin Jensen of USA Today, it was a response to Stefani's [...] "comment that her life 'blew up' with the demise of her marriage".|$|E

I {{was so close to}} him I could see the bristles from his brushes caught in the paint; and the mucky thumbprints he'd left along his margins. The first thing that impressed me was his speed. Michelangelo worked at Schumacher pace. Adam's famous little penis was captured with a single brushstroke: a flick of the wrist, and the first man had his manhood. I also enjoyed his sense of humour, which, from close up, turned out to be refreshingly puerile. If <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>closely</b> at the angels who attend the scary prophetess on the Sistine ceiling known as the Cumaean Sibyl, you will see that one of them has stuck his thumb between his fingers in that mysteriously obscene gesture that visiting fans are still treated to today at Italian football matches." ...|$|E
500|$|Technical {{director}} Lisa Forsell {{explained that}} {{to enhance the}} richness and beauty of the desert landscapes surrounding Radiator Springs, the filmmakers created a department responsible for matte paintings and sky flats, saying: [...] "Digital matte paintings are {{a way to get}} a lot of visual complexity without necessarily having to build complex geometry, and write complex shaders. We spent a lot time working on the clouds and their different formations. They tend to be on several layers and they move relative to each other. The clouds do in fact have some character and personality. The notion was that just as people see themselves in the clouds, cars see various car-shaped clouds. It’s subtle, but there are definitely some that are shaped like a sedan. And if <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>closely,</b> you’ll see some that look like tire treads. The fact that so much attention is put on the skies speaks to the visual level of the film. Is there a story point? Not really. There is no pixel on the screen that does not have an extraordinary level of scrutiny and care applied to it. There is nothing that is just throw-away." ...|$|E

There are many Russophobes there". In response, Christopher Walker, director of studies at Freedom House, argued that Freedom House made its evaluations based on objective criteria explained on the organization's web site, and he denied that it had a pro-U.S. agenda.

Ericsson board of directors in the South Kings' Tower in Kungsgatan 33, as the company had until 1940 its representative office here. The South Kings' Tower is {{the one of the}} two towers, it is a 17-storey and 61m (200ft) and was built between 1924 and 1925. Together, they are considered the first modern skyscrapers in Europe. The South Kings' Tower was adorned with four towers figures from Roman mythology (Fortuna, Mercury, Neptune and Victoria) created by sculptor [...] Constructor was L. M.

2500|$|After his passing, four further {{generations of}} the Hotchkin Family lived in Woodhall Lodge. At {{some point during the}} last century, it was renamed as the Old Manor or Manor House. During the {{residence}} of Thomas Hotchkin’s great grandson, Stafford Vere Hotchkin (1876-1953), who helped to redesign the adjacent world-rated golf course which bears his name, there were major additions to the building. Around 1905 the south-west corner and east wings were built, greatly enlarging the footprint of the property. If <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>closely,</b> it is possible to see the different brickwork. The front entrance is wholly Georgian, whilst, to the left and right are the Edwardian additions. The magnificent sweeping staircase, the beautiful hallway and Queens Room fireplaces, and the mahogany panelled entrance to the library all date from this period of high elegance. In 1965, Thomas Hotchkin’s great great grandson, Neil Hotchkin, sold the property to the National Farmers Union and it was converted into offices as the company’s regional headquarters. [...] Around twenty five years later, it was sold to a local businessman, who continued to run it as offices for various Lincolnshire companies.|$|E
2500|$|Critics have disputed Ehrlich's main thesis about {{overpopulation}} and {{its effects}} on the environment and human society, and his solutions, {{as well as some of}} his specific predictions made since the late 1960s. One criticism concerns Ehrlich's allegedly alarmist and sensational statements and inaccurate [...] "predictions". Ronald Bailey of Reason Magazine has termed him an [...] "irrepressible doomster... who, as far as I can tell, has never been right in any of his forecasts of imminent catastrophe." [...] On the first Earth Day in 1970, he warned that [...] "n ten years all important animal life in the sea will be extinct. Large areas of coastline will have to be evacuated because of the stench of dead fish." [...] In a 1971 speech, he predicted that: [...] "By the year 2000 the United Kingdom will be simply a small group of impoverished islands, inhabited by some 70 million hungry people." [...] "If I were a gambler," [...] Professor Ehrlich concluded before boarding an airplane, [...] " [...] I would take even money that England will not exist in the year 2000." [...] When this scenario did not occur, he responded that [...] "When you predict the future, you get things wrong. How wrong is another question. I would have lost if I had had taken the bet. However, if <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>closely</b> at England, what can I tell you? They're having all kinds of problems, just like everybody else."

60|$|Every evening {{during my}} stay, after mate had been served {{and there was}} a long vacant {{interval}} before night, she would go out from the gate to a distance of fifty or sixty yards, where an old log was lying on a piece of waste ground overgrown with nettles, burdock, and redweed, now dead and brown, and sitting on the log, her chin resting on her hand, she would fix her eyes on the dusty road half a mile away, and motionless in that dejected attitude she would remain for about an hour. When <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> <b>closely</b> at her <b>you</b> could see her lips moving, and if you came quite near her you could hear her talking in a very low voice, but she would not lift her gaze from the road nor seem to be aware of your presence.

50|$|Harris {{also argues}} against {{the effects of}} birth order.

60|$|There {{was not in}} {{all that}} land, nor perhaps in all the wide world, a happier little boy than Martin, when after waking from his sleep and dream he dressed himself {{for the first time}} in that new suit, and went out from the cave into the morning sunlight. He then felt the comfort of such clothes, for they were softer than the finest, softest down or silk to his skin, and kept him warm when it was cold, and cool when it was hot, and dry when it rained on him, and the earth could not soil them, nor the thorns tear them; and above {{everything}} they were the most beautiful clothes ever seen. Their colour was a deep moss green, or so it looked at a little distance, or when seen in the shade, but in the sunshine it sparkled as if small, shining, many-coloured beads had been sewn in the cloth; only there were no beads; it was only the shining threads that made it sparkle so, like clean sand in the sun. When <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> <b>closely</b> at the cloth, you could see the lovely pattern woven in it--small leaf and flower, the leaves like moss leaves, and the flowers like the pimpernel, but not half so big, and they were yellow and red and blue and violet in colour.|$|R
60|$|Then the Ethiopian put {{his five}} fingers close {{together}} (there {{was plenty of}} black left on his new skin still) and pressed {{them all over the}} Leopard, and wherever the five fingers touched they left five little black marks, all close together.

Spring is the most wonderful, because she has not to cover a clean, bare field with new leaves and flowers, but to drive before her and to put away the hanging-on, over-surviving raffle of half-green things which the gentle winter has {{suffered}} to live, {{and to make the}} partly-dressed stale earth feel new and young once more. And this she does so well that there is no spring in the world like the Jungle spring.|$|E

60|$|This {{dread of}} the {{categorical}} proposition might be creditable, if it sprang from attachment {{to a very}} high standard of evidence, or from {{a deep sense of}} the relative and provisional quality of truth. There might even be a plausible defence set up for it, if it sprang from that formulated distrust of the energetic rational judgment in comparison with the emotional, affective, contemplative parts of man, which underlies the various forms of religious mysticism. If <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>closely</b> into our present mood, it is seen to be the product mainly and above all of a shrinking deference to the status quo, not merely as having a claim not to be lightly dealt with, which every serious man concedes, but as being the last word and final test of truth and justice. Physical science is allowed to be the sphere of accurate reasoning and distinct conclusions, but in morals and politics, instead of admitting that these subjects have equally a logic of their own, we silently suspect all first principles, and practically deny the strict inferences from demonstrated premisses. Faith in the soundness of given general theories of right and wrong melts away before the first momentary triumph of wrong, or the first passing discouragement in enforcing right.|$|E
6000|$|I {{have said}} that a {{disregard}} of the possibilities of wide organization and its associated economy of effort is characteristic of most [...] "advanced" [...] educational literature. You will, if you will examine them, find that disregard working out to its natural consequences in what are called the [...] "advanced" [...] schools that appeal to educationally anxious parents nowadays. You will find that these places, often very picturesque and pleasing-looking places, are rarely prosperous enough to maintain {{more than one or}} two good teachers. The rest of the staff shrinks from scrutiny. You will find these schools adorned with attractive diagrams drawn by the teachers, and strikingly original models and apparatus made by the teachers, and if <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>closely</b> into the matter or consult an intelligent pupil, you will find there are never enough diagrams and apparatus to see a course through. If you press that matter you will find that they haven't had time to make them so far. And they will never get so far. No school, however rich and prosperous and however enthusiastically run, can hope to make for itself all the plant and diagrams and apparatus needed for a fully efficient modern education such as we have sketched out. As well might a busy man hope to array himself, by his own efforts, with hats, suits and boots made by himself out of wool and raw hides.|$|E
60|$|Donatello had {{not very}} easily been stirred {{out of the}} {{peculiar}} sluggishness, which enthralls and bewitches melancholy people.

They wandered forth at large, like two knights-errant, among the valleys, and the mountains, and the old mountain towns of that picturesque and lovely region. Save to keep the appointment with Miriam, a fortnight thereafter, in the great square of Perugia, there was nothing more definite in the sculptor's plan than that they should let themselves be blown hither and thither like Winged seeds, that mount upon each wandering breeze. Yet there was an idea of fatality implied in the simile of the winged seeds which did not altogether suit Kenyon's fancy; for, if <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>closely</b> into the matter, it will be seen that whatever appears most vagrant, and utterly purposeless, turns out, in the end, to have been impelled the most surely on a preordained and unswerving track. Chance and change love to deal with men's settled plans, not with their idle vagaries. If we desire unexpected and unimaginable events, we should contrive an iron framework, such as we fancy may compel the future to take one inevitable shape; then comes in the unexpected, and shatters our design in fragments.|$|E
