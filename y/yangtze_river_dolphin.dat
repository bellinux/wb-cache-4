40|$|SINE (short {{interspersed}} element) insertion analysis elucidates contentious aspects in the phylogeny of toothed {{whales and}} <b>dolphins</b> (Odontoceti), especially <b>river</b> <b>dolphins.</b> Here, we characterize 25 informative SINEs inserted into unique genomic loci during evolution of odontocetes {{to construct a}} cladogram, and determine a total of 2. 8 kb per taxon of the flanking sequences of these SINE loci to estimate divergence times among lineages. We demonstrate that: (i) Odontocetes are monophyletic; (ii) Ganges <b>River</b> <b>dolphins,</b> beaked whales, and ocean dolphins diverged (in this order) after sperm whales; (iii three other <b>river</b> <b>dolphin</b> taxa, namely the Amazon, La Plata, and <b>Yangtze</b> <b>river</b> <b>dolphins,</b> form a monophyletic group with <b>Yangtze</b> <b>River</b> <b>dolphins</b> being the most in basal; and (iv) the rapid radiation of extant cetacean lineages occurred some 28 - 33 million years B. P., in strong accord with the fossil record. The combination of SINE and flanking sequence analysis suggests a topology and set of divergence times for odontocete relationships, offering alternative explanations for several long-standing problems in cetacean evolution...|$|R
25|$|The <b>Yangtze</b> <b>River</b> or Baiji <b>dolphin</b> (Lipotes vexillifer) is {{the most}} {{endangered}} cetacean and is only found in the <b>Yangtze</b> <b>River,</b> China. A survey conducted in 1997 found only thirteen <b>dolphins.</b> The <b>Yangtze</b> <b>River</b> finless porpoise (Neophocaena phocaenoides asiaeorientalis) also lives in the <b>Yangtze</b> <b>River.</b> Abundance has declined and there are fewer than 2000 dolphins left. This may be due, in part, {{to the construction of}} the Three Gorges Dam which covers a significant amount of the dolphin’s habitat. Both species are often subject to entanglement in gillnets.|$|R
2500|$|Due to {{commercial}} {{use of the}} river, tourism, and pollution, the Yangtze is home to several seriously threatened species of large animals (in addition to fish): the finless porpoise, baiji (<b>Yangtze</b> <b>River</b> <b>dolphin),</b> Chinese alligator, Yangtze giant softshell turtle and Chinese giant salamander. This is the only other place besides the United States that is native to an alligator and paddlefish species. In 2010, the Yangtze population of finless porpoise was 1000 individuals. In December 2006, the <b>Yangtze</b> <b>River</b> <b>dolphin</b> was declared functionally extinct after an extensive search of the river revealed no signs of the dolphin's inhabitance. In 2007, a large, white animal was sighted and photographed in the lower Yangtze and was tentatively presumed to be a baiji. However, as {{there have been no}} confirmed sightings since 2004, the baiji is presumed to be functionally extinct at this time. [...] "Baijis were the last surviving species of a large lineage dating back seventy million years and one of only six species of freshwater dolphins".

40|$|Abstract Background The {{phylogeny}} of Cetacea (whales) is {{not fully}} resolved with substantial support. The ambiguous and conflicting results of multiple phylogenetic studies {{may be the result}} of the use of too little data, phylogenetic methods that do not adequately capture the complex nature of DNA evolution, or both. In addition, there is also evidence that the generic taxonomy of Delphinidae (dolphins) underestimates its diversity. To remedy these problems, we sequenced the complete mitochondrial genomes of seven dolphins and analyzed these data with partitioned Bayesian analyses. Moreover, we incorporate a newly-developed "relaxed" molecular clock to model heterogenous rates of evolution among cetacean lineages. Results The "deep" phylogenetic relationships are well supported including the monophyly of Cetacea and Odontoceti. However, there is ambiguity in the phylogenetic affinities of two of the <b>river</b> <b>dolphin</b> clades Platanistidae (Indian <b>River</b> <b>dolphins)</b> and Lipotidae (<b>Yangtze</b> <b>River</b> <b>dolphins).</b> The phylogenetic analyses support a sister relationship between Delphinidae and Monodontidae + Phocoenidae. Additionally, there is statistically significant support for the paraphyly of Tursiops (bottlenose dolphins) and Stenella (spotted dolphins). Conclusion Our phylogenetic analysis of complete mitochondrial genomes using recently developed models of rate autocorrelation resolved the phylogenetic relationships of the major Cetacean lineages with a high degree of confidence. Our results indicate that a rapid radiation of lineages explains the lack of support the placement of Platanistidae and Lipotidae. Moreover, our estimation of molecular divergence dates indicates that these radiations occurred in the Middle to Late Oligocene and Middle Miocene, respectively. Furthermore, by collecting and analyzing seven new mitochondrial genomes, we provide strong evidence that the delphinid genera Tursiops and Stenella are not monophyletic, and the current taxonomy masks potentially interesting patterns of morphological, physiological, behavioral, and ecological evolution. </p...|$|R
50|$|The Yangtze Freshwater Dolphin Expedition 2006 (长江淡水豚类考察) was {{a six-week}} search {{expedition}} undertaken in November and December 2006 in central China {{in an attempt}} to locate continued proof of the existence of the endangered Baiji <b>Yangtze</b> <b>Dolphin</b> (Chinese <b>River</b> <b>Dolphin).</b> It was carried out {{under the direction of the}} Institute of Hydrobiology in Wuhan and the Swiss-based baiji.org foundation and was notable for drawing to an end without any positive results. Thus it was announced that the species was functionally extinct.|$|R
25|$|The Ganges <b>river</b> <b>dolphin</b> {{is one of}} {{only five}} true {{freshwater}} dolphins in the world.

5000|$|Genome {{sequences}} done in 2013 {{revealed that}} the <b>Yangtze</b> <b>River</b> <b>dolphin,</b> or [...] "baiji" [...] (Lipotes vexillifer), lacks single nucleotide polymorphisms in their genome. After reconstructing {{the history of the}} baiji genome for this dolphin species, researchers found that the major decrease in genetic diversity occurred most likely due to a bottleneck event during the last deglaciation event. During this time period, sea levels were rising while global temperatures were decreasing. Other historical climate events can be correlated and matched with the genome history of the <b>Yangtze</b> <b>River</b> <b>dolphin</b> as well. This shows how global and local climate change can drastically affect a genome, leading to changes in fitness, survival, and evolution of a species.|$|E
5000|$|Shishou ( [...] ; [...] ) is a county-level city {{under the}} {{administration}} of the prefectural-level city Jingzhou, in the south of Hubei province, China, near its border with Hunan province.

The Swan Islet Wetland of the <b>Yangtze</b> <b>River</b> in this area is the world’s largest national natural reserve both for wild elks(Milu, or David Deer) and for Chinese <b>river</b> <b>dolphins</b> (finless porpoises). The Shishou City National Baiji Reserve for Chinese <b>river</b> <b>dolphins</b> is nearby.

Moreover, Shishou boasts a diversified landscape, including mountains, hills, lakes, rivers, terraces and plains, as well as abundant resources such as rice, cotton, oil plants, eggs, fish, and lotus roots.|$|R

40|$|<b>River</b> <b>dolphins</b> {{are among}} the world’s most {{threatened}} mammals, and indeed the baiji (Lipotes vexillifer), a species endemic to China's <b>Yangtze</b> <b>River,</b> is likely extinct. Exploitation for products such as meat, oil, and skins has been a lesser feature in the population histories of <b>river</b> <b>dolphins</b> compared to most large mammals. Habitat factors are therefore of particular interest and concern. In this paper we attempt to describe the population-level responses of <b>river</b> <b>dolphins</b> to habitat transformation. We find circumstantial but compelling evidence supporting the view that, at a local scale, <b>river</b> <b>dolphins</b> are opportunists (generalists) capable of adapting {{to a wide range}} of habitat conditions while, at a river basin scale, they are more appropriately viewed as vulnerable specialists. The same evidence implies that the distributional responses of <b>river</b> <b>dolphins</b> to basinwide ecological change can be informative about their extinction risk, while their local behaviour patterns may provide important insights about critical ecological attributes. Empirical studies are needed on the ecology of river cetaceans, both to inform conservation efforts on behalf of these threatened animals and to help address broader concerns related to biodiversity conservation and the sustainability of human use in several of the world's largest river systems...|$|R
