This is an intriguing idea. It also has publicity advantages if properly released at the right time. It won't hurt NASA's feelings either.

500|$|Much of {{the story}} is told by the songs, with the lyrics {{coordinating}} with the events {{of the story}}. For example, [...] "Don't You Want Me" [...] introduces the affair between Greg and Connie, allowing them to flirt in the presence of Fran. It pre-empts the result of their relationship with the line [...] "we will both be sorry"; this is unsung by the characters, but nonetheless emphasise in the episode. The song also speaks to the relationship between Greg and Roger, with Greg singing [...] "don't you want me?" [...] when he fears that he will be fired, and tells of Greg's character with lines including [...] "Don't forget it's me who put <b>you</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> are now // And I can put you back there too".|$|E

The narrator interprets this as referring to Peter's martyrdom (John 21:19). According to a tradition found in the apocryphal Acts of Peter, Peter was crucified upside-down.|$|E
2500|$|... "I find it {{fascinating}} {{that our}} planet still has areas where no modern technology can save <b>you,</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> {{are reduced to}} your most basic - and essential - self. This natural space creates demanding situations {{that can lead to}} suffering and death, but also generate a wild interior richness. Ultimately, {{there is no way of}} reconciling these contradictions. All I can do it try to live within their margins, in the narrow boundary between joy and horror. Everything on this earth is a balancing act." ...|$|E
2500|$|Henry Cheevers was {{the husband}} of Sarah Cheevers {{and the father of}} her children. The Cheevers family was settled in Slaughterford, Wiltshire. Henry Cheever’s {{religious}} beliefs are unclear, though in some letters, Sarah seems to be attempting to persuade him towards Quakerism. She wrote, “I am a witness of… the messengers of Christ, who ... directing <b>you</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> may find your saviour to purge and cleanse you from your sins, and to reconcile you to his Father.” ' Some historians believe that this indicates that her husband and children may not have been practicing Quakers, and might have been Protestants of a different denomination. Though families generally shared the same religious beliefs, various forms of Protestantism were popular in England in the period immediately following the English Civil War.|$|E

2500|$|With a cover {{featuring}} a flaming sword breaking through a pane of glass, On Fire! was Petra's heaviest album yet, {{the culmination of}} the transition begun with Back to the Street. A fully hard rock album, bordering in places on heavy metal, On Fire! made the most of songs such as [...] "All Fired Up," [...] "Hit <b>You</b> <b>Where</b> <b>You</b> Live" [...] and [...] "Mine Field" [...] – all of which continued the spiritual warfare theme. CCM Magazine, in praising the album, called On Fire! [...] "the crunchiest Petra sound yet" [...] and praised the first two tracks as [...] "the most exciting eight minutes of rock Petra has ever put to tape." [...] Once again, the band scored hits with its initial singles, as [...] "First Love," [...] the radio ballad, and [...] "Mine Field," [...] the rocker, hit No.1 on three of Music Line Magazine's four Christian radio charts. [...] "First Love" [...] finished 1988 as the year's 10th-most-played radio single.|$|E
2500|$|In 2014, the Chick tract Unforgiven was {{distributed}} by Bible Baptist Church in Garden City, Roanoke, Virginia and drew outrage from the area's Muslim community. The tract {{tells the story}} of an African-American man who, while in prison, is coerced into joining the Islamic faith and changes his name to Muhammad. [...] Upon his release he threatens his Christian grandmother. Hussain Al-Shiblawi, a local man, told WDBJ-TV that he gets pamphlets from the church every Sunday and that they are typically inspirational, but that this one was different. “It basically indicated that the people are violent, the religion itself is violent, and the facts in here are not true,” he said. “It shows him trying to kill his mother saying, ‘If you weren’t my grandma, I’d kill <b>you</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> stand, Allahu Akbar.’” In one scene, the grandmother begs Lamont to return to the Christian faith, telling him he’ll “die in [...] sins” and be unforgiven by God if he doesn’t. But the young man isn’t swayed by her pleas. “I choose Muhammad! And I hate your Jesus, your Bible and you!,” he screams. “Get out of my house you infidel!” Bible Baptist Church said the church did not write the tract and simply distributed it.|$|E
