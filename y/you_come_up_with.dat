[...] He said that [...] "like all soap actors," [...] he sticks with the script the majority of the time, [...] "but every now and then he goes off the page," [...] commenting, [...] "You get to direct yourself. <b>You</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a little bit.

He said [...] "If you take the best song elements from the ‘80s albums, and put these on one album, <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the Sting in the Tail album. So in this case we tried to re-invent the Scorpions sound from the ‘80s, using the same DNA after putting in a modern twist, to make it sound like today’s music".|$|E

2500|$|Proponents {{believe that}} the FairTax would have {{positive}} effects on civil liberties that are sometimes charged against the income tax system. [...] Some of these include social inequality, economic inequality, financial privacy, self-incrimination, unreasonable search and seizure, burden of proof, and due process. [...] Proponents state the FairTax would remove the exemptions and deductions that discriminate against gays, singles, childless couples, and others based on spending and lifestyle choices. [...] The principles of an income tax regarding individual liberty are also argued by critics.

[...] The government [...] "unashamedly proclaims the doctrine of collectivized wealth.... That which it does not take is a concession." [...] This situation is no different from the current system of income taxation, in which the government has a [...] "prior lien" [...] on all labor undertaken by its subjects.|$|E

60|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{the same}} walk, on the same bright summer day, {{at the corner of the}} next little town or village, you may find another kind of tramp, {{embodied}} in the persons of a most exemplary couple whose only improvidence appears to have been, that they spent the last of their little All on soap. They are a man and woman, spotless to behold--John Anderson, with the frost on his short smock-frock instead of his 'pow,' attended by Mrs. Anderson. John is over-ostentatious of the frost upon his raiment, and wears a curious and, you would say, an almost unnecessary demonstration of girdle of white linen wound about his waist--a girdle, snowy as Mrs. Anderson's apron. This cleanliness was the expiring effort of the respectable couple, and nothing then remained to Mr. Anderson but to get chalked upon his spade in snow-white copy-book characters, HUNGRY! and to sit down here. Yes; one thing more remained to Mr. Anderson--his character; Monarchs could not deprive him of his hard-earned character. Accordingly, as <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> this spectacle of virtue in distress, Mrs. Anderson rises, and with a decent curtsey presents for your consideration a certificate from a Doctor of Divinity, the reverend the Vicar of Upper Dodgington, who informs his Christian friends and all whom it may concern that the bearers, John Anderson and lawful wife, are persons to whom you cannot be too liberal. This benevolent pastor omitted no work of his hands to fit the good couple out, for with half an eye you can recognise his autograph on the spade.|$|E
