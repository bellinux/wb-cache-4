2500|$|At the December 15, 1971, taping of The Dick Cavett Show, with Janet Flanner and Gore Vidal, [...] Mailer, {{annoyed with}} a less-than-stellar review by Vidal of Prisoner of Sex, {{apparently}} headbutted Vidal and traded insults with him backstage. As the show began taping, a visibly belligerent Mailer, who admitted {{he had been}} drinking, goaded Vidal and Cavett into trading insults with him on air and continually referred to his [...] "greater intellect". He openly taunted and mocked Vidal (who responded in kind), finally earning the ire of Flanner, who announced during the discussion that she was [...] "becoming very, very bored", telling Mailer [...] "You act as if you're the only people here." [...] As Cavett made jokes comparing Mailer's intellect to his ego, Mailer stated [...] "Why don't <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>your</b> question sheet and ask your question?", to which Cavett responded [...] "Why don't you fold it five ways and put it where the moon don't shine?" [...] A long laugh ensued, after which Mailer asked Cavett if he {{had come up with}} that line and Cavett replied [...] "I have to tell you a quote from Tolstoy?". The headbutting and later on-air altercation was described by Mailer himself in his essay [...] "Of a Small and Modest Malignancy, Wicked and Bristling with Dots".|$|E

6000|$|... "What {{have you}} been about," [...] he asked, [...] "since we had that talk in the Gardens to-day? Have <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>your</b> empty purse, and are you wise enough to take my way of filling it?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'No, no, I'm not,' said Mrs. Snitchey with {{a majestic}} smile. 'I know my station. Will <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>your</b> chosen companion, Mr. Snitchey; at your referee, at {{the keeper of}} your secrets, at the man you trust; at your other self, in short?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'But {{how could}} you do it?' I asked Lyte afterwards. 'You knew he had you beaten when he drew two cards. Besides, <b>you</b> never <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>your</b> own draw.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>you</b> will <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>your</b> notes, Mr. Playmore, {{you will}} see that I have already succeeded in terrifying him--though I am only a woman and though I didn't mean to do it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Now; one--two--three, one--two--three. Reverse! Ah! that's better. Try it again. I say, you know, <b>you</b> mustn't <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>your</b> feet. One--two--three, one--two--three. Shorter steps! You are not hanging to the gee-pole just now. Try it over.|$|R
6000|$|... "Waal, that depends," [...] {{said the}} driver, slowly. [...] "If {{you go to}} spreadin' {{yourself}} all over creation, as boys are very apt to do, your money won't go very far; but if <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>your</b> money {{two or three times}} afore you spend it, you ought to get back and have a dollar or two left." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now will <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>your</b> card, young sir," [...] said Endicott, {{who stood}} behind Lambert's chair, {{whispering}} directions in his ear. [...] "A splendid card, begad! {{and one on}} which you must stake freely.... Nay! nay! that is not enough," [...] he added, hurriedly restraining the young man's hand, who had timidly pushed a few silver coins forward. [...] "'Tis thus you must do!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, {{were you}} up early, too?" [...] said Charmian, with {{what seemed to}} Ludlow a supernatural shrewdness. [...] "It's {{perfectly}} telepathic! The Psychical Research ought to have it. It would be such fun {{if we could get}} together and compare our reasons for waking so early. But Cornelia and I didn't know just when we did wake, and I suppose the Psychical Research wouldn't care for it without. She seems to be writing a pretty long note, or a pretty hard one!" [...] Ludlow lifted his downcast eyes, and gave her a look that was ghastly. [...] "Did <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>your</b> watch?" [...] she asked.|$|E
6000|$|... 'All in good time,' said she, {{without moving}} her eyes. 'I will settle my account with <b>you</b> presently. <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> <b>your</b> friends, Rikki-tikki. They are still and white; they are afraid. They dare not move, {{and if you}} come a step nearer I strike.' ...|$|R

6000|$|Edith writhed {{from her}} grasp, and stood flushed and defiant, with gleaming, angry eyes fixed upon her sister. [...] "You may speak evil of him now," [...] said she, [...] "but {{there was a}} time when Paul de la Fosse came to Cosford, and who so gentle and soft-spoken to him then as wise, grave, sister Mary? But he has learned to love another; so now he is the wicked man, and it is shame to be seen under his roof! From what I see of my good pious sister and her {{cavalier}} it is sin for another to ride at night with a man at your side, but it comes easy enough to <b>you.</b> <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> <b>your</b> own eye, good sister, ere you would take the speck from that of another." ...|$|E
6000|$|Do {{you seek}} first God's kingdom, or your own profit, your own pleasure, your own reputation? Do {{you believe that}} you are in God's kingdom, that He is your King, and has called you to the station in which you are to do good and useful work for Him upon this earth of His? Whatever be your calling, whether you be servant, labourer, farmer, tradesman, gentleman, maid, wife, or widow, father, son, or husband, do you ask {{yourself}} every day, 'Now what are the laws of God's kingdom about this station of mine? what is my duty here? how can I obey God, and His laws here, and do what He requires of me, and so be a good servant, a good labourer, a good tradesman, a good master, a good parish officer, a good wife, a good parent, pleasing to God, useful to my neighbours and to my countrymen?' Or do you say to yourselves, 'How can I get the greatest quantity of money and pleasure out of my station, with the least trouble to myself?' My dearest friends, ask yourselves, each of you, in which of these two ways do <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>your</b> own station in life? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And now let us talk, dear, as one {{heart to}} another. Remember always {{that if a}} girl is to have your heart she must be worthy of you. When <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>your</b> own bright {{innocent}} face in the mirror, resolve that you will give your hand to no girl who is not just as innocent as you are and no brighter than yourself. So that you must first find out how innocent she is. Ask her quietly and frankly--remember, dear, that the days of false modesty are passing away--whether she has ever been in jail. If she has not (and if YOU have not), then {{you know that you}} are dealing with a dear confiding girl who will make you a life mate. Then you must know, too, that her mind is worthy of your own. So many men to-day are led astray by the merely superficial graces and attractions of girls who in reality possess no mental equipment at all. Many a man is bitterly disillusioned after marriage when he realises that his wife cannot solve a quadratic equation, and that he is compelled to spend all his days with a woman who does not know that X squared plus 2XY plus Y squared is the same thing, or, I think nearly the same thing, as X plus Y squared.|$|E

5000|$|Wilkinson {{explains}} that the album title was chosen to represent different forms of consciousness; of the artwork he explains [...] "The crystal clear representation of a moment isn't necessarily the most interesting. Think about when <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>your</b> parents' old photographs - it's not an exact image of how they look; it's like a stained glass window into how they look." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Giddy On Up" [...] is an up-tempo country song, {{driven by}} fiddle and banjo with a {{prominent}} brass {{section in the}} pre-chorus. The song's female narrator confronts her man ("Baby where you been, its half-past ten"), making note of the many signs that suggest he has been cheating on her with another woman ("Smilin' a lot when <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>your</b> phone / There's a change in your tone"). In the bridge, she tells him that he's made a mistake by cheating on her, telling him to [...] "giddy on up, giddy on out." ...|$|E

6000|$|You poor, pitiful little brat! Popularity? it is a shadow. Turn {{your eyes}} towards it, and it shall ever run before you, {{escaping}} you.

6000|$|... "Our little jaunt is {{not over}} yet," [...] she remarked, smiling. [...] "We {{are going to have}} dinner together--you and I alone, and {{afterwards}} I will show you that even a town house can sometimes boast of a pleasant garden. <b>You</b> needn't <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>your</b> clothes.

5000|$|That the way I as Joyce see Buffy as the Slayer {{is sort of}} symbolic, when <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>your</b> {{child and}} realize they are a totally {{different}} person than you are {{and that they have}} different gifts and a different calling. It's a separation thing. In this case it's just more extreme and because it isn't just that she's an incredible pianist. It's something that has a moral cause behind it and so it brings dual feelings. 'I'm your mother and 'm older and I'm wiser but yet you're my daughter and you're this really spectacular person who's going places and wrestling with things that are beyond what I'll ever have to do in my lifetime.'

5000|$|According to Metacritic, Marvin Kitman of Newsday gave season 1 of Doogie Howser, M.D. a 40/100 {{score and}} commented: [...] "What a wasted {{childhood}} {{my kids have}} had, I got to thinking while watching this otherwise normal Doogie Howser. It makes <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>your</b> kids differently. What lazy bums they must be, {{still in high school}} at 16." [...] Scott Weinberg of DVD Talk recommended season two: [...] "It's not high art, but it's a heckuva lot better than what generally passes for your average weeknight sitcom." [...] Christopher Smith of the Bangor Daily News gave season three a [...] "C" [...] grade and commented: [...] "No classic, this series. ...The show has become gratingly cute, particularly in the episodes “Doogiesomething,” “Double Doogie with Cheese,” and “Lonesome Doog.” Doog, I’m Dooged out." ...|$|E
5000|$|New York Times {{reviewer}} Alessandra Stanley {{struck a}} contrary note: [...] "This version of The Prisoner {{is not a}} remake, it's a clever and engaging reinterpretation by Bill Gallagher, who shaped the script to contemporary tastes and sensibilities — notably, a postmodern fatigue with ideology and big thoughts." [...] She concludes [...] "The 21st century adaptation pays only {{lip service to the}} human condition, and instead explores a power struggle between two human beings. It's unlikely to prove as lasting, but the new series still manages to be thrilling." [...] Furthermore, it was positively reviewed in the Radio Times and also by Sam Wallaston who writing for The Guardian, described it as [...] "a triumph with something of The Truman Show about it" [...] with [...] "a tension and a claustrophobia that gnaw away at you, making <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>your</b> own psyche." ...|$|E
5000|$|The song [...] "expresses {{in vivid}} metaphors Jethro's {{philosophy}} and approach to life. Jethro sings directly to Moses, and convinces him to re-examine how he views his existence.
