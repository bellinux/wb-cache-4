Common ways to professionally cheat at card games using sleight of hand include palming, switching, ditching, and stealing cards from the table. Such techniques involve extreme misdirection and <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>practice.</b> For these reasons, the term sleight of hand frequently carries negative associations of dishonesty and deceit at many gambling halls, and many magicians known {{around the world are}} publicly banned from casinos, such as British mentalist and close-up magician Derren Brown, who is banned from every casino in Britain.|$|E

In addition, Chatwin's interest in nomads also influenced his writing. One aspect of nomadic culture that interested him was the few possessions they had. Their spartan way of life appealed to his aesthetic sense, and it was something he sought to emulate in both his life and his writing. He strove to strip unnecessary objects from his life and unnecessary words from his prose.|$|E

5|$|There is an {{extensive}} scientific literature on chess psychology. Alfred Binet and others showed that knowledge and verbal, rather than visuospatial, ability {{lies at the}} core of expertise. In his doctoral thesis, Adriaan de Groot showed that chess masters can rapidly perceive the key features of a position. According to de Groot, this perception, made possible by <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> and study, {{is more important than the}} sheer ability to anticipate moves. De Groot showed that chess masters can memorize positions shown for a few seconds almost perfectly. The ability to memorize does not alone account for chess-playing skill, since masters and novices, when faced with random arrangements of chess pieces, had equivalent recall (about half a dozen positions in each case). Rather, it is the ability to recognize patterns, which are then memorized, which distinguished the skilled players from the novices. When the positions of the pieces were taken from an actual game, the masters had almost total positional recall.|$|E

40|$|Global Knowledge GK 302 Mai 2013 The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore {{challenges}} facing newly qualified nurses in the first <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>practice,</b> a cultural perspective on Norway and Zambia. This was a qualitative type of study with a purposeful convenience sampling of newly qualified nurses in their first <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>practice.</b> However, the inclusion criteria extended to nurses who had more years in service and their responses proved to be relevant to the study. Data were gathered using a semi-structured interview guide, which was electronically sent for data collection and analyzed with a colour coding process through which four categories of intra-personal, inter-personal, organizational and structural levels emerged. The intra-personal level mainly presented similarities for the two countries, showing that the newly qualified nurses had the will and drive to work as nurses in the first <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>practice,</b> while the inter-personal level showed differences in caring for patients and/or their relatives between Norway and Zambia and this was linked to differences in the type of culture. The organizational level showed differences between the two set-ups associated with hierarchy and finally the structural level brought out more challenges from the Zambian respondents because of the country's Lower Middle Income status. Ethical considerations were ensured by means of privacy, anonymity and confidentiality. The authors recommend that more research should be done on how potential gender differences may have an impact on the challenges facing newly qualified nurses in their first <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>practice...</b>|$|R

25|$|Drugs {{are tested}} {{by the people who}} {{manufacture}} them, in poorly designed trials, on hopelessly small numbers of weird, unrepresentative patients, and analysed using techniques which are flawed by design, {{in such a way that}} they exaggerate the benefits of treatments. Unsurprisingly, these trials tend to produce results that favour the manufacturer. When trials throw up results that companies don't like, they are perfectly entitled to hide them from doctors and patients, so we only ever see a distorted picture of any drug's true effects. Regulators see most of the trial data, but only from early on in a drug's life, and even then they don't give this data to doctors or patients, or even to other parts of government. This distorted evidence is then communicated and applied in a distorted fashion.
