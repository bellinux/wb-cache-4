60|$|PHOEBE Goodbye, old boy. [They shake hands.] Don't <b>you</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> {{walk over}} you. Make her fight.|$|E
6000|$|... "You're a temptress, Leila. Will you let Nollie know, please, that we {{can take}} her back with us? Can <b>you</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> off to-morrow?" ...|$|E
60|$|HARRY. One {{would almost}} {{think she had}} some hold on you. I've never seen anyone let an amah behave as <b>you</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> behave.|$|E
6000|$|... "’You can’t get locked up,’ ses Sam; ’if <b>you</b> <b>let</b> <b>’er</b> {{discover}} <b>you</b> {{and claim}} you, ’ow {{can you get}} locked up for it? We shall go in an’ see her agin, and larn {{all there is to}} larn, especially about the tattoo marks, and then—’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>let</b> <b>her</b> go!" [...] shouted Tom, recklessly. [...] "Why, {{you can get}} {{ten miles}} more of speed, Dick, if <b>you</b> try. <b>Let</b> <b>her</b> out for all you are worth!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{found her}} {{alone in the}} wood,' replied her daughter, 'and brought her back {{with me for a}} companion. <b>You</b> will <b>let</b> <b>her</b> stay?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How could <b>you</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> do so?" [...] she added, as {{became a}} fearful woman, accusing she didn't know whom of she didn't know what.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was exactly}} like my great-aunt," [...] she gaspingly admitted. [...] "But, oh, it was terrible! Why do <b>you</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> go into such states?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Sister Constance {{listened to}} the symptoms, and {{promptly}} answered, 'Give her a glass of port wine every day, before <b>you</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> out of your room.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I writ at once, {{on hearing}} of <b>you,</b> to <b>let</b> <b>her</b> know <b>you</b> were in safety,' said the major. 'And {{what do you}} intend the noo?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They tell me that,--that {{you did not}} behave wisely about it. Why could <b>you</b> not <b>let</b> <b>her</b> {{alone when}} <b>you</b> found out how matters were going?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{the person}} you choose {{hesitate}} on that account, <b>you</b> can <b>let</b> <b>her</b> go without regret," [...] said Marian. [...] "She will not be worthy of your regard." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why didn't <b>you</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> {{take them}} along, poor motherless baby?" [...] asked the doctor {{when he saw}} the dolls lying as she had left them.|$|E
60|$|McCOMAS. Yes, Socialism. That's what Miss Gloria {{will be up}} to {{her ears}} in {{before the end of the}} month if <b>you</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> loose here.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{hear you}} have been teasing Elsa again," [...] she said crossly. [...] "Why can't <b>you</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> enjoy herself just for to-night, without interfering with her?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps {{you are too}} {{careful to}} please her. I think <b>you</b> should <b>let</b> <b>her</b> know that, to a certain extent, you must be master in your own house." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'If {{you could}} guess {{what she has}} suffered, and how fond he is of her, you would not turn away from <b>her.</b> <b>You</b> will <b>let</b> <b>her</b> be your friend?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Easy, while she's {{getting her}} first drink; then, if she's {{spouting}} full, <b>you</b> can <b>let</b> <b>her</b> hum," [...] he said, {{and turned to}} Austin. [...] "Now, come down with me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Kells--I'll {{die before}} I leave that girl in your clutches," [...] flashed Roberts. [...] "An' I ain't a-goin' to stand here an' argue with <b>you.</b> <b>Let</b> <b>her</b> come--or--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Away and <b>you</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> go away? You {{let your}} sister {{go away and}} be a--a woman of the town? You never loved her--you never had any pity for her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I {{agree that}} she is a real child, won't <b>you</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> stay, uncle?" [...] she said, forgetting that, if she lost her faith, her friend was lost also.|$|E
60|$|So! Romance {{never does}} things by halves. If {{she comes back}} to you she brings gifts and her knitting, and will sit in your chimney-corner if <b>you</b> will <b>let</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Seize her," [...] {{he shouted}} {{to two of}} the soldiers; [...] "that's it; now hold her under water in that hole till I tell <b>you</b> to <b>let</b> <b>her</b> up again." ...|$|R
6000|$|Miss Starbrow {{then sent}} for the cook. [...] "What {{does this mean}} about Rosie's going?" [...] she demanded of that person. [...] "How came <b>you</b> to <b>let</b> <b>her</b> go without informing me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, now, I'm {{not afraid}} of {{anything}} she can say; and what could she do? She can't part us, unless <b>you</b> <b>let</b> <b>her,</b> and then I should let her, too." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If <b>you</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> {{see that}} you think that, {{you may as well}} give up your project." [...] Mrs. Farquhar hesitated a moment. [...] "Have you ever tried to {{formulate}} what you expect from Alison?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've got it," [...] said Rollo, {{holding it}} up to the light. [...] "It is the cage, and Tiger is in it. Poor thing! she looks frightened half to death. Would <b>you</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> out?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{must help}} it, Mother,' said Alfred, {{in his most}} pettish tones. 'I won't have her here, {{worrying}} with her voice like a hen cackling. Say <b>you</b> won't <b>let</b> <b>her</b> come her!' ...|$|R
60|$|VALENTINE (taking this in {{very bad}} part). Now look here, Crampton: <b>you</b> just <b>let</b> <b>her</b> alone: she's treated you very well. I {{had a much}} worse time of it at lunch than you.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I {{beg your}} pardon, mother. I {{certainly}} wasn't {{thinking of her}} alone. But she is proud, and I hoped <b>you</b> would <b>let</b> <b>her</b> feel that we realize all that she is doing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bayliss," [...] said Mr. Crocker in a {{cautious}} undertone, [...] "go and tell Mrs. Crocker that Mrs. Pett {{is waiting to}} see her. She's in the morning-room. If you're asked, say <b>you</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> in. Get me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you keep}} her {{too close to}} the wind she won't sail, and if <b>you</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> fall off she's not going where you want. How do you find out the exact angle she ought to make?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Emily persisted. [...] "Don't {{worry the}} poor old soul! However strangely {{she may have}} left my aunt and me her motives are kind and good--I am sure of that. Will <b>you</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> keep her {{harmless}} little secret?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>you</b> should <b>let</b> <b>her</b> go {{specially}} as a kindness to me. For my son's sake I {{have promised}} to be there, {{and it would be}} a comfort to me to have another woman with me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's a relief," [...] remarked Adam, who {{had struck}} a match and studied his watch. [...] "The ground's clear and Don Hernando has {{somebody}} he can trust {{waiting at the}} lagoon. <b>You</b> can <b>let</b> <b>her</b> go ahead, Captain." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank'ee, doctor, thank'ee. Yes; she {{has been}} a good wife--better for a poor man than a rich one; but then, that was what she was born to. <b>You</b> won't <b>let</b> <b>her</b> be knocked about by them, will you, Thorne?" ...|$|R
