25|$|In 2008, {{researchers}} tagged {{and recorded}} {{the movements of}} <b>young</b> <b>bull</b> sharks in the Caloosahatchee River estuary. Specifically, they were testing {{to find out what}} determined the movement of the <b>young</b> <b>bull</b> sharks. It was found that the <b>young</b> <b>bull</b> sharks synchronously moved downriver when the environmental conditions changed. This large movement of <b>young</b> <b>bull</b> sharks were found to be moving as a response rather than other external factors such as predators. An interesting find was that the movement was directly related to the bull shark conserving energy for itself. One way the bull shark is able to conserve energy is that when the tidal flow changes, the bull shark uses the tidal flow in order to conserve energy as it moves downriver. Another way for the bull shark to conserve energy is to decrease the amount of energy needed to osmoregulate the surrounding environment.|$|E

Sixteen Nellore <b>young</b> <b>bulls</b> and 16 dual-purpose dairy <b>young</b> <b>bulls</b> (Holstein x Gir and Holstein x Guzerá) with average initial body weight of 378. 8 ± 13. 8 kg were used. The experimental design was completely randomized with treatments in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement. The proportion of silage and the genetic group did not change the percentage of muscle, fat and bone of the carcass. The yield of the primary commercial cuts was not altered by the level of silage. The pistol cut weight was higher in Nellore <b>young</b> <b>bulls</b> compared to dairy crossbred <b>young</b> <b>bulls</b> (125. 8 vs. 119. 5 kg), while the relative weight of short ribs was higher in dairy crossbreds (11. 9 vs. 11. 5 %). Only the muscle cut of the pistol was altered by silage proportion in the rations, being higher in those with the lowest proportion of grass silage. On the other hand, only the relative weight of flat, rump cap and edible lean trims were altered by genetic group, which were higher in Nellore <b>young</b> <b>bulls.</b> Among {{the characteristics of the}} meat, only marbling was significantly changed, being higher in dairy crossbreds fed rations with a lower grass-silage proportion.

40|$|International audienceAbstractBackgroundCentral {{testing is}} used to select <b>young</b> <b>bulls</b> which are likely to {{contribute}} to increased net income of the commercial beef cattle herd. We present genetic parameters for growth and reproductive traits on performance-tested <b>young</b> <b>bulls</b> and commercial animals that are raised on pasture and in feedlots. MethodsRecords on <b>young</b> <b>bulls</b> and heifers in performance tests or commercial herds were used. Genetic parameters for growth and reproductive traits were estimated. Correlated responses for commercial animals when selection was applied on performance-tested <b>young</b> <b>bulls</b> were computed. ResultsThe 90 % highest posterior density (HPD 90) intervals for heritabilities of final weight (FW), average daily gain (ADG) and scrotal circumference (SC) ranged from 0. 41 to 0. 49, 0. 23 to 0. 30 and 0. 47 to 0. 57, respectively, for performance-tested <b>young</b> <b>bulls</b> on pasture, from 0. 45 to 0. 60, 0. 20 to 0. 32 and 0. 56 to 0. 70, respectively, for performance-tested <b>young</b> <b>bulls</b> in feedlots, from 0. 29 to 0. 33, 0. 14 to 0. 18 and 0. 35 to 0. 45, respectively, for commercial animals on pasture, and from 0. 24 to 0. 44, 0. 13 to 0. 24 and 0. 35 to 0. 57 respectively, for commercial animals in feedlots. The HPD 90 intervals for genetic correlations of FW, ADG and SC in performance-tested <b>young</b> <b>bulls</b> on pasture (feedlots) with FW, ADG and SC in commercial animals on pasture (feedlots) ranged from 0. 86 to 0. 96 (0. 83 to 0. 94), 0. 78 to 0. 90 (0. 40 to 0. 79) and from 0. 92 to 0. 97 (0. 50 to 0. 83), respectively. Age at first calving was genetically related to ADG (HPD 90 interval = − 0. 48 to − 0. 06) and SC (HPD 90 interval = − 0. 41 to − 0. 05) for performance-tested <b>young</b> <b>bulls</b> on pasture, however it {{was not related to}} ADG (HPD 90 interval = − 0. 29 to 0. 10) and SC (HPD 90 interval = − 0. 35 to 0. 13) for performance-tested <b>young</b> <b>bulls</b> in feedlots. ConclusionsHeritabilities for growth and SC are higher for performance-tested <b>young</b> <b>bulls</b> than for commercial animals. Evaluating and selecting for increased growth and SC on performance-tested <b>young</b> <b>bulls</b> is efficient to improve growth, SC and age at first calving in commercial animals.

25|$|In a {{research}} experiment, the bull sharks {{were found to}} be at the mouth of an estuary {{for the majority of the}} time. They stayed at the mouth of the river independent of the salinity of the water. The driving factor for a bull shark to be in fresh or salt water, however, is its age; as the bull shark ages, its tolerance for very low or high salinity increases. The majority of the newborn or very <b>young</b> <b>bull</b> sharks were found in the freshwater area, whereas the much older bull sharks {{were found to be}} in the saltwater areas, as they had developed a much better tolerance for the salinity. Reproduction is one of the reasons why adult bull sharks travel into the river—it is thought to be a physiological strategy to improve juvenile survival and a way to increase overall fitness of bull sharks. The young are not born with a high tolerance for high salinity, so they are born in fresh water and stay there until they are able to travel out.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyse three {{commercial}} beef categories of the ‘Serrana de Teruel breed’ to define the appropriate commercial option. Twenty ‘Serrana de Teruel’ male calves at 9 months were assigned to the commercial beef categories (<b>young</b> <b>bulls,</b> bulls and steers), slaughtered at 12, 22 and 22 months of age, respectively. The in vivo ultrasound backfat thickness was greater than the dorsal fat thickness, and the <b>young</b> <b>bulls</b> and steers had a similar fat thickness, that was greater than the bulls in both areas. The slaughter weight and cold carcass weight were significantly different between the commercial categories. However, the differences were not sufficient to modify the dressing percentage, carcass conformation and fatness degree between the <b>young</b> <b>bulls</b> and bulls. The maximum stress of the muscle at 7 d of ageing was lower in the steers than in the <b>young</b> <b>bulls</b> and bulls. In general, the lightness of the meat in the bulls was lower than that in the <b>young</b> <b>bulls</b> and steers. The subcutaneous fat of the bull carcasses had a vivid colour and stored more carotenoids than that of the <b>young</b> <b>bulls</b> and steers. Hence, bulls produced heavier and better conformed carcasses with more edible meat and less fat than the other categories. However, steers are recommended to produce large carcasses with more trim and cover fat than the other categories. Finally, it seems that bulls are the most suitable commercial category to ‘Serrana de Teruel’ breed. © 2016 INIA...|$|R

Of the 37 <b>young</b> <b>bulls</b> genotyped for CD 18 / Hae III gene mutation, 36 were normal homozygote (AA), 1 was heterozygote for the disease (AB) and no affected homozygote genotype (BB) were found. The frequency of the normal and BLAD mutant allele were 0. 99 and 0. 01, respectively. The analyzed results showed that the BLAD carrier prevalence in Iranian Holstein <b>young</b> <b>bulls</b> was approximately 2. 8 %. The genotype frequencies in κ-CSN/ Hinf I locus were 0. 70 for homozygote (AA) and 0. 30 for heterozygote (AB) animals while the frequency of the A allele was 0. 85.
