Fox left Wonderama in 1967; his successor, Bob McAllister, continued the show both locally (in New York City), and in national syndication through the 1970s. Fox gradually withdrew from television work (he'd also played Mr. Prim in the 1966 film The Christmas That Almost Wasn't), spending time in theater and other entertainment while raising his own four children. He spent one year (1977) running children's programming for NBC (and taking one more stab at hosting, with the short-lived, California-based, Way Out Games in 1976), while spending time concurrently as a lecturer at the State University of New York at Stony Brook campus in the 1970s.|$|R

[...] I do not remember to what you especially allude, but whatever the rules you speak of may be, unless there be anything in them contrary {{to the rights of}} present English property, why should you care whether the Government makes them law or not? Can you not, you thousands of English workmen, simply make them a law to yourselves, by practising them? ...|$|R

2500|$|... {{and from}} the Gospel of Luke, {{the parable of the}} Rich man and Lazarus (...) [...] The text is based on Johann Rist's hymn in 16 stanzas [...] "", using 12 of the stanzas. The hymn, {{reflecting}} death and eternity, is well suited to match the parable of the rich man who has to face death and hell. It is subtitled [...] "" [...] (A Serious Consideration of Endless Eternity). The text of three stanzas is kept unchanged, 1, 8 and 12, used for movements 1, 7 and 11. An unknown author rephrased the other stanzas of the chorale to recitatives and arias, generally alternating and using one stanza for one cantata movement. The poet combined two stanzas, 4 and 5, to form movement 4. He used the lines [...] "" [...] (Perhaps this is <b>your</b> <b>last</b> day, no <b>one</b> knows when he might die) from stanza 9 in movement 9 which is otherwise based on stanza 10. In movement 10 he inserted a hint at the Gospel. In general, he stays close to the text, which is characteristic for the early cantatas in Bach's second annual cycle. The poet was possibly Andreas Stübel, who died in 1725, a possible explanation why Bach did not complete the full cycle, but ended on Palm Sunday.|$|R
