500|$|Kaczynski {{attended}} Evergreen Park Community High School {{where he}} excelled academically. He played the trombone in the marching band {{and was a}} member of the math, biology, coin, and German clubs but was regarded as an outsider by his classmates. In 1996, a former classmate said: [...] "He was never really seen as a person, as an individual personality... He was always regarded as a walking brain, so to speak." [...] During this period, Kaczynski became intensely interested in mathematics, spending hours studying and solving advanced problems. He became associated with a group of likeminded boys interested in science and mathematics, known as the [...] "briefcase boys" [...] for their penchant for carrying briefcases. One member of this group recalled Kaczynski as [...] "the smartest kid in the class... just quiet and shy until <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> him. Once he knew you, he could talk and talk." ...|$|E
2500|$|His {{successor}} at the Marinepersonalamt , described Lütjens as {{a dedicated}} naval officer who put his {{service to the}} nation ahead of the ruling party. He also described him as a difficult man to know. Austere, rather forbidding, he said little and when he did, confined his remarks to the essentials. Patzig said of him [...] "one of the ablest officers in the service, very logical and shrewd, incorruptible in his opinions and an engaging personality when <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> him." [...] Few did. Lütjens's dedication to his officer principles meant he did not marry until he was 40—adhering to a code that an officer should wed only when he could support a wife.|$|E
60|$|I don't think I've {{ever been}} so bucked by {{a bit of}} news. I felt I had misjudged Rollo. Evidently, when <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> him better, {{he had a lot}} of {{intelligence}} in him.|$|E

6000|$|Her mother {{remained}} {{looking at}} her, helpless, {{not so much}} with amaze, perhaps, as dismay. [...] "Oh, I'm not a ghost! I wish I was! You had better sit down, mother. <b>You</b> have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> all about it." ...|$|R

60|$|Mike had {{not been}} greatly fascinated by the stranger's looks; but, after all, the most supercilious person on earth {{has a right to}} his own property. Besides, he might have been quite a nice fellow when <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> him. Anyhow, the bag had better be {{returned}} at once.

6000|$|Guy, on {{the other}} hand, found himself almost equally {{surprised}} in turn at the rapid way he grew really to be fond of Granville Kelmscott. Though Kelmscott knew, as he thought, the terrible secret of his half-unconscious crime--for he could feel now how completely he had acted under Montague Nevitt's compelling influence--Guy was aware before long of such a profound and deep-seated sympathy existing between them, that he became exceedingly attached in time to his friendly fellow-prisoner. In spite of the one barrier they could never break down, he spoke freely by degrees to Granville of everything else in his whole life; and Granville in return spoke to him just as freely. A good fellow, Granville, when <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> him. There was only a single trait in his character Guy couldn't endure; and that was his ingrained love of money-grubbing. For the way the man pounced down upon those dirty little stones, when he saw them in the mud, and hoarded them up in his belt, and seemed prepared to defend them with his very life-blood, Guy couldn't conceal from himself-the fact that he fairly despised him. Such vulgar, common-place, unredeemed love of pelf! Such mere bourgeois avarice! Of what use could those wretched pebbles be to him here in the dusty plains of far inland Africa? ...|$|E
6000|$|The man who {{had spoken}} made a little gesture of resignation. [...] "Well," [...] he said, [...] "if <b>you</b> have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know,</b> we are going in to see if Slocum has left any of the dollars he beat us out of behind him." ...|$|R
5000|$|Jong goes on {{to explain}} that it is [...] "zipless" [...] because [...] "when you came together, zippers fell away like rose petals, {{underwear}} blew off in one breath like dandelion fluff. For the true ultimate zipless A-1 fuck, it was necessary that <b>you</b> never <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> the man very well." ...|$|R

5000|$|Gibson {{asserted}} that the reason that king Edward I kills his son's lover is because the king is a [...] "psychopath". Gibson also expressed bewilderment that some filmgoers laughed at this murder: We cut a scene out, unfortunately ... where <b>you</b> really <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that character (Edward II) and to understand his plight and his pain...

5000|$|Vega {{considered}} Presley the unequaled entertainer of the 20th century who exuded charisma {{through his}} records and personal appearances. He said, [...] "Once <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> him, Elvis {{was a really}} good guy, but he was never an ordinary guy. Elvis liked to see people happy.

5000|$|In 1962, Laikin {{teamed with}} {{cartoonist}} Mort Drucker on the highly successful JFK Coloring Book (Kanrom Publishers), which sold 2,500,000 copies, prompting follow-up coloring books on Ollie North and Ronald Reagan. They did JFK Coloring Book in 1962 and The Ollie North Coloring Book in 1987. Drucker described Laikin as [...] "kind of quiet...

5000|$|Group member Paula Van Oppen {{explained}} that [...] "Ugly Heart" [...] was about ending {{a relationship with}} a guy who initially appeared to be nice on the outside, but once <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> him well, the ugly side to his personality came out. Van Oppen said the inspiration for the song [...] "was giving that message of strength and confidence and being a good person, inside and out. Not just having the exterior surface be all that you are." [...] Natasha Slayton hoped the track would inspire people to date someone who treated them well, instead of dating someone because of their beauty. Simone Battle commented that the track felt personal to her, as it reminded her of a time when she had crush on a guy in high school, who pretended to like her back and embarrassed her. Battle also thought {{there would be a lot}} of women who could relate to the song. While Van Oppen added that the group's songs were empowering.|$|E

50|$|During Carlton's 150th {{anniversary celebration}} in June 2014, {{at which he}} was named the club's {{greatest}} player, Nicholls went further, saying that the club needed to lose its arrogant image:But I must say, if I have one regret about the image of Carlton, who I love, it {{is the fact that}} we have probably taken over from Collingwood as being the most hated side in the league. I say that because people think we were arrogant, which we were - thanks to a couple of presidents. Without mentioning any names, they were arrogant. When we won, they didn’t <b>know</b> how <b>to</b> win properly. I believe that’s the thing about sport - <b>you</b> have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> how <b>to</b> win and how to lose and do both properly. We were arrogant. I think that helped create an image of the club, being an arrogant club, which I don’t think we are.|$|R
6000|$|Wetherford was {{thoroughly}} roused now. Some {{part of his}} old-time fire seemed to return to him. He rose {{from his chair and}} approached the ranger firmly. [...] "I've seen you act like a man, Ross Cavanagh. You've been a good partner these last few days--a son couldn't have treated me better--and I hate like hell to think ill of you; but my girl loves you--I could see that.

6000|$|DEAR MISS LILY,--Your kind {{interest}} in me gives me courage to say [...] something that will very likely make me hateful to you forevermore. [...] But I have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> say it, and <b>you</b> have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> it; and it's all [...] the worse for me if you have never suspected it. I want to give my [...] whole life to you, wherever and however you will have it. With you [...] by my side, I feel as if I could really do something that you would [...] not be ashamed of in sculpture, and I believe that I could make you [...] happy. I suppose I believe this because I love you very dearly, and [...] I know the chances are {{that you will not}} think this is reason [...] enough. But I would take one chance in a million, and be only too [...] glad of it. I hope it will not worry you to read this: as I said [...] before, I had to tell you. Perhaps it won't be altogether a [...] surprise. I might go on, but I suppose that until I hear from you I [...] had better give you as little of my eloquence as possible.|$|R
5000|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Stickwitu" [...] was shot {{over two days}} filmed in {{different}} places of Los Angeles including the Orpheum Theatre. Nigel Dick was chosen to direct the video as the group wanted to maintain its momentum garnered from [...] "Don't Cha". Dick admitted that he felt pressure to deliver. [...] "This video establishes {{the way they want}} to be seen from now on. But that's the way it's always been for me. I've been very lucky in my career to do videos for people that are very crucial in artist's careers." [...] Speaking of the video's concept, Nicole Scherzinger said: This video shows much more vulnerability. The video was just {{a day in the life}} of the Pussycat Dolls on the road. Part of it is showing the strength to do what we do performers; the other is to show that we have our vulnerabilities in life with trying to hold up relationships while we're on the road. Scherzinger says the video also serves another purpose. We wanted to make sure that each of us was identifiable in this video, that <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> each girl a little bit more, and get to see what we're like on and off tour." [...] The music video premiered on MTV.com, on October 13, 2005.|$|E
5000|$|Q: Let's {{return to}} anti-Semitism for a moment. You've written that you don't {{perceive}} anti-Semitism {{as a problem}} anymore, {{at least in this}} country, since its institutional applications and casual manifestations have basically disappeared. Do you still believe that? [...] I grew up with anti-Semitism in the United States. We were the only Jewish family in a mostly Irish- and German-Catholic neighborhood, which was very anti-Semitic and pretty pro-Nazi. For a young boy in the streets, <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what that meant. When my father was first able to get a secondhand car in the late 30s, we drove to the local mountains and passed hotels that said [...] "restricted" [...] meaning [...] "no Jews". That was just part of life. When I got to Harvard in the 1950s, the anti-Semitism was so thick you could cut it with a knife. In fact, one of the reasons MIT is a great university is that people like Norbert Wiener couldn't get jobs at Harvard—it was too anti-Semitic—so they came to the engineering school down the street. That was anti-Semitism. Now, it's a very marginal issue. There is still racism, but it's anti-Arab racism which is extreme. Distinguished Harvard professors write that Palestinians are people who bleed and breed their misery in order to drive the Jews into the sea, and that's considered acceptable. If some distinguished Harvard professor were to write that Jews are people who bleed and breed and advertise their misery in order to drive Palestinians into the desert, the cry of outrage would be enormous. When Jewish intellectuals who are regarded as humanist leaders say that Israel ought to settle the underpopulated Galilee—meaning too many Arabs, not enough Jews—that's considered wonderful. Violent anti-Arab racism is so prevalent that we don't even notice it. That's what we should be worried about. It's in the cinema, advertising, everywhere. On the other hand, anti-Semitism is there, but very marginal.|$|E
40|$|This is {{the first}} P. P. Debono {{memorial}} lecture, instituted by the "Association of Surgeons and Physicians of Malta", delivered on the 30 th October 1969 at the Medical School of the University. A commemoration of professor Peter Paul Debono, who occupied the Chair of Surgery at the Royal University of Malta from 1926 to 1951. He was a supreme teacher, the pioneer of scientific surgery in Malta and an exemplary family man. He {{had a sense of}} humour and a charm of his own once <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> him, being kind hearted and deeply religious. Debono's early days surgical diagnosis depended largely on symptoms and physical signs and the methods of reaching it were summarised in his dictum. He himself was an outstanding diagnostician but that was due to his extensive experience as a doctor rather than to that miserable aphorism. Another of his tenets was that not everything new or recently popular was necessarily better, and if an operation had given him good results he would cling to it irrespective of any change in fashion. peer-reviewe...|$|E
6000|$|Carter {{surveyed}} {{him with}} a candidly curious gaze. [...] "Well, Captain, Mrs. Travers did let on a bit to me about our chief-officer's boat. You've stopped it, haven't <b>you?</b> How she <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> God only knows. She was sorry she spoke, too, but it wasn't so much of news to me as she thought. I can put two and two together, sometimes. Those rockets, last night, eh? I wished I had bitten my tongue out before I told you about our first gig. But I was taken unawares. Wasn't I? I put it to you: wasn't I? And so I told her when she asked me what passed {{between you and me}} on board this brig, not twenty-four hours ago. Things look different now, all of a sudden. Enough to scare a woman, but she is the best man of them all on board. The others are fairly off the chump because it's a bit dark and something has happened they ain't used to. But she has something on her mind. I can't make her out!" [...] He paused, wriggled his shoulders slightly--"No more than I can make you out," [...] he added.|$|R
60|$|Wrykyn {{had passed}} through an {{election}} and its attendant festivities in the previous year, when Sir Eustace Briggs, {{the mayor of the}} town, had been returned by a comfortable majority. Since then ill-health had caused that gentleman to resign his seat, and the place was once more in a state of unrest. This time the school was deeply interested in the matter. The previous election had not stirred them. They did not care whether Sir Eustace Briggs defeated Mr Saul Pedder, or whether Mr Saul Pedder wiped the political floor with Sir Eustace Briggs. Mr Pedder was an energetic Radical; but owing to the fact that Wrykyn had always returned a Conservative member, and did not see its way to a change as yet, his energy had done him very little good. The school had looked on him as a sportsman, and read his speeches in the local paper with amusement; but they were not interested. Now, however, things were changed. The Conservative candidate, Sir William Bruce, was one of themselves--an Old Wrykinian, a governor of the school, a man who always watched school-matches, and the donor of the Bruce Challenge Cup for the school mile. In fine, one of the best. He was also the father of Jack Bruce, a day-boy on the engineering side. The school {{would have liked to have}} made a popular hero of Jack Bruce. If he had liked, he could have gone about with quite a suite of retainers. But he was a quiet, self-sufficing youth, and was rarely to be seen in public. The engineering side of a public school has workshops and other weirdnesses which keep it occupied after the ordinary school hours. It was generally understood that Bruce was a good sort of chap if you knew him, but <b>you</b> had <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> him first; brilliant at his work, and devoted to it; a useful slow bowler; <b>known</b> <b>to</b> be able to drive and repair the family motor-car; one who seldom spoke unless spoken to, but who, when he did speak, generally had something sensible to say. Beyond that, report said little.|$|R
60|$|Lady Hilda, too, was longing {{in her own}} way for {{the season}} to be over. She had gone through another of them, thank goodness, she said to herself at times with a rare tinge of pensiveness, only to {{discover}} that the Hughs, and the Guys, and the Algies, and the Montys were just as fatuously inane as ever; and were just as anxious as before to make her share their fatuous inanity for a whole lifetime. Only fancy living with an unadulterated Monty from the time you were twenty to the time you were seventy-five--at which latter date he, being doubtless some five years older than one-self to begin with, would probably drop off quietly with suppressed gout, and leave you a mourning widow to deplore his untimely and lamented extinction {{for the rest of your}} existence! Why, long before that time <b>you</b> would have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> his very thoughts by heart (if he had any, poor fellow!) and would be able to finish all his sentences and eke out all his stories for him, the moment he began them. Much better marry a respectable pork-butcher outright, and have at least the healthful exercise of chopping sausage-meat to fill up the stray gaps in the conversation. In that condition of life, they say, people are at any rate perfectly safe from the terrors of ennui. However, the season was over at last, thank Heaven; and in a week or so more they would be at dear old ugly Dunbude again for the whole winter. There Hilda would go sketching once more on the moorland, and if this time she didn't make that stupid fellow Ernest see what she was driving at, why, then her name certainly wasn't Hilda Tregellis.|$|R
