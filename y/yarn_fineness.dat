It {{is well known that}} thermal conductivity of fabric is mainly influenced by their porosity. The fabric porosity is a function of construction parameters such as <b>yarn</b> <b>fineness</b> and set of weft and warp. The ideal volume porosity can be computed from basic fabric parameters and the structure of elementary cell. The main aim of this work is the creation of simple mechanistic model for the prediction of fabric thermal conductivity from basic fabric properties such as yarn diameters, weft and warp sett, planar weight and thickness of fabric. This model is in fact the combination of air conductivity and conductivity of fibrous phase in hierarchy fibers, yarn and fabric. The experimentally obtained thermal conductivities of 27 wool/PET plain weaves with constant sett of warp and varying sett of weft and varying <b>yarn</b> <b>fineness</b> are used for checking of the predictive ability of this model. vk 201...|$|E

The effect of yarn count, <b>yarn</b> <b>fineness,</b> fabric layers on the bending behavior of fabrics was analyzed. The results showed that warp and weft load, flexural stress, flexural strain and flexural modulus were increased as the yarn counts increasing; Warp and weft load, flexural stress and flexural strain increases as the fabric layers increased, flexural modulus decreased as the fabric layers increasing; load, flexural stress, flexural strain and flexural modulus increased as the yarn linear density increasing...|$|E

Yarn produced by this technique has executed closer resemblance to preferable ring spun yarn structure as well as properties to flat multifilament yarn. Commercial success of this concept demands through study of impact of various raw materials, machine variables and process variables {{on the performance of}} this innovative yarn. This research work thereby designed to identify the influence of raw material variables on the mechanical crimp textured yarn performance. However, in order to avoid undue overlapping machine variables as well as process variables were kept constant. Empirically optimised values of these variables for polyester yarn have been adopted for this study. Fully drawn multifilament yarns belonging to two most commercially popular groups viz; Polyester and Nylon, were textured at three different false twist levels. These yarns were not only differing in terms of type of polymer group but also in terms of other contributing properties, viz; <b>yarn</b> <b>fineness,</b> filament fineness, cross sectional shape etc [...] However values of these variables were purely restricted by the availability of variations from the manufacturer end. Comparative evaluation of texturising as well mechanical properties of these product yarns have been done. All the samples irrespective of the material have shown the rise in the percent bulk, linear density, percent extension, percent boiling water shrinkage with finer trilobal cross section filament yarn.

40|$|Biocomposites were {{prepared}} using epoxidized linseed oil (ELO) and flax fibre reinforcements in different assemblies. ELO was cured by two different anhydrides to check how its thermomechanical properties can be influenced. As reinforcements nonwoven mat, twill weave and quasi-unidirectional textile fabrics with two different <b>yarn</b> <b>finenesses</b> were used. Their reinforcing effect was determined in {{dynamic mechanical analysis}} (DMA) in flexure. DMA served also to determine the glass transition temperature (Tg). Shape memory properties were derived from quasiunconstrained flexural tests performed near to the Tg of the ELO and its biocomposites. Flax reinforcement reduced the Tg that was attributed to off-stoichiometry owing to chemical reaction between the hydroxyl groups of flax and anhydride hardener. The shape memory parameters were moderate or low. They were affected by both textile content and type...|$|R
40|$|The {{destructive}} {{effects of}} sun UV radiation on human skins are now {{very clear to}} everyone. Most of the present studies were focused on the fabrics’ structural parameters such as density, warp and weft <b>yarns</b> <b>finenesses,</b> fabric pattern and printing or finishing treatments applied to the fabrics. The aim of this work is achieving a technique through which the produced fabrics possess a higher UV-protection ability. For this purpose, two different metals including aluminium and copper yarns were employed in fabrics production process and their effects on UV-protection ability of the produced fabrics were investigated. Six different fabric samples comprised of either cotton/polyester, nylon yarns as the warp yarns as well as either aluminium or copper yarns as the weft yarns were produced. Using the spectrophotometer technique, which is {{known as one of}} the UPF measuring method, the absorbency and reflectivity of fabrics within the specified range of electromagnetic waves (specially the UV radiation) were determined. The results illustrated that the higher UV absorbency was related to the fabric possessing the copper yarns in their structures. It was concluded that the absorption ability of nylon fabrics is higher than that of the cotton/polyester samples...|$|R

30|$|The {{effect of}} fibre linear density on water {{absorbency}} of test fabrics {{is presented in}} Fig.  7. Water absorbency was observed to increase {{with the increase in}} polyester fibre linear density for both carded (RC 3.3  > RC 2.2  > RC 1.5  > RC 1.3  > RC 1.1) and combed yarn fabrics (RM 3.3  > RM 2.2  > RM 1.5  > RM 1.3  > RM 1.1). Increase in water absorbency with fibre linear density may be attributed to corresponding increase in fabric thickness and fabric porosity (Table  4). For the same <b>yarn</b> <b>fineness,</b> as the fibre fineness decreases, the number of fibres in yarn cross-section decreases, which may result in increased yarn bulkiness and availability of high pore volume in yarn structure. Large pores or a high total pore volume assists in higher liquid volume retention, as suggested by Varshney et al. (2010). An increase in water absorbency of fabrics with increase in fibre linear density is therefore well justified in the light of above arguments. Combination of polyester fibre of higher decitex and carded yarn is seen to result in fabrics of higher water absorbency.|$|E

40|$|In this study, ten carded {{ring spun}} cotton yarns were {{subjected}} to windings. <b>Yarn</b> hairiness, <b>fineness,</b> unevenness and tensile properties were then examined. Results showed {{that the majority of}} the increased yarn hairiness occurred at the beginning cycles of windings. Weight loss occurred for most yarns after repeated windings. Tensile properties deteriorated for nearly all the yarn samples after repeated windings. On the contrary, yarn unevenness was improved for most yarns after corresponding windings. To explain the better evenness of yarn after repeated windings, unevenness of yarn was divided into two parts, namely stem unevenness and surface hairiness unevenness; yarn imperfections were subdivided into two categories: the imperfections of yarn stem and the imperfections caused by yarn hairs. Specifically, a balanced opinion was given to discuss the gains and losses in quality and cost due to repeated windings. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract––Mechanical crimp texturising {{technique}} is {{making use of}} differential migration behavior of the constituent filaments during their torsional deformation as well as bending deformation. Types of yarn, <b>yarn</b> <b>fineness,</b> filament fineness, shape factor etc. are the detrimental factors for these extents of deformations. Fully drawn continuous filament yarns with contrasting colours, apart from variation {{in one or more}} contributing factors mentioned above were grouped together for the desired production of fancy yarns. Structure of fancy yarn was analyzed by microscopical examination. The colour analysis of the product yarn was also done on Hunter lab colour measurement instrument Spectra Span 9100. This has permitted in identifying apparent colour of fancy yarn scientifically, which is different than its parent yarn colour. Favorable transformation of cheaper and stronger flat filament feeder yarn structure to favourable crimpy/bulky yarn structure was an added gain of this production process. All the samples were also shown good crimp associated properties. Thus newly designed fancy yarn produced out of flat filament yarn found to be a good option for value addition along with added comfort to apparel textiles as well as home furnishing...|$|E

Percentage reflectance values of the fabrics changed according to yarn density, weave pattern, and filament fineness in accordance with fabric layer numbers during reflectance measurement.

40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the behavior}} to creasing of some woven materials made from yarns type wool used for ready-made clothes. Factors like fibrous composition, properties of constituent fibers, wovens structure parameters, mechanical properties of {{warp and weft}} yarns and finishing treatments that influenced the recovery capacity from crease/folding were investigated experimentally through several tests which revealed their importance in the process. The creasing of woven materials made from combed yarns type wool used for ready-clothes is an undesired deformation effect with temporary or permanent character, which {{is caused by a}} composed strain of bending and compression during utilization, processing or maintenance. It is manifested by the appearance of wrinkles, folds or stripes on the surface of wovens materials, thus diminishing their qualitative appearance and also their practical value. Creasing is the result of irreversible changes created through the reciprocal sliding of structural fiber components when exposed to a bending strain. Creasing is specific to oriented structures with high crystallinity (cellulosic fibers). The sliding appears because of hydrogen bond breaking which can, however, reform easy in other positions conferring a permanent character to creasing.

40|$|The {{elaborated}} {{principles of}} nanoengineering of linen textile materials implement {{the techniques of}} spatially localized effects of protein catalysts on polymeric cellulose companions with selective splitting of impurity compounds without damaging technologically necessary nano-sized formations of binders in the fiber structure. The ranges of optimal values of the residual content in flax fiber prepared for spinning are identified {{on the basis of}} the analysis of the successive stages of enzymatic and peroxide treatments contribution to the breakdown of polymers and the differentiation of the influence of impurities on the yarn technological properties. The recommended level of residual pectin, lignin and hemicellulose (wt. %) is: after enzymatic treatment P 1 = 1, 0 ± 0, 1; L 1 = 3, 9 ± 0, 3; Hc 1 = 11, 0 ± 1, 0; after peroxide bleaching P 2 = 0, 4 ± 0, 05; L 2 = 2, 3 ± 0, 3; Hc 2 = 7, 5 ± 0, 5. The required level of fiber structural modification at the stage of preparing roving for spinning can be achieved through use of protein catalysts whose globule size is 50 [...] . 100 nm. The use of enzymes with these dimensional characteristics helps to ensure breaking of polymer adhesives on the surface of incrusts and in the areas of intercellular formations, which hinder fiber crushing, without damaging nano-sized binding fractions. The implementation of this method contributes to a significant improvement in the uniformity of structural and physical and mechanical properties of flax yarn.

These fabrics were then dyed with {{three types of}} dye (reactive, direct and sulphur dye) with three dye concentrations (0. 1 %, 1. 0 % and 5. 0 % on-weight of fabric (owf)) in three colours (red, yellow and blue). This study examined the impact of constructional parameters and dyeing on ultraviolet (UV) protection properties of cotton knitted fabric. In-vitro test with spectrophotometer was used for evaluating the UV protection property of dyed cotton knitted fabrics. Among the six parameters investigated, fineness of yarn and dye concentration were the most significant factors affecting UPF while the color effect is the least significant. Experimental results revealed that the UPF value of dyed fabrics made from combed cotton is generally higher than the combed Supima cotton since combed cotton is composed of shorter fibres which facilitate the blocking or absorption of UV radiation. Second, fabrics made with twist yarn (i. e. ring spun yarn) have higher UPF value than the corresponding ESTex one (i. e. Torque-free yarn) in general since fabrics made with ring spun yarn tend to shrink during wet processing {{and so it is}} more compact. Third, the UPF value of fabrics made with 30 Ne yarn was higher than the 40 Ne one since it is thicker and has lower fabric porosity. Fourth, fabrics dyed with lower concentration of dye gave the lowest UPF. Fifth, the sulphur dyed samples performed worse than the reactive and direct dyed samples in terms of UV protection property.

30|$|In a real {{braiding}} process, {{the natural}} forming point occurs {{somewhere between the}} forming ring and the carriers. This position depends on parameters such as take-up speed, <b>yarn</b> <b>fineness</b> and yarn-to-yarn coefficient of friction. The smaller the take-up speed, the higher the coefficient of friction and the coarser the yarn, the closer the natural forming point will be to the carriers. In the FE model, the yarns were modelled as converging {{to the center of}} the braiding machine and, when the simulation started, they were pulled from the take-up node (Fig.  5 b) in the positive y-direction through the forming ring at a speed equal to the real braiding machine take-up speed υtu. Based on experimental observations, the position of the take-up nodes relative to the carriers was adjusted depending on the take-up speed to be as close as possible to where the braid would form in a real braiding process. Opposite to the take-up nodes, linear elastic springs modelled with discrete elements, were attached to each yarn end to simulate the carrier tensioning springs (0.2 N was the effective pre-tension applied by the springs to the attached yarns). These springs, as in a real carrier, were restrained to move in the y-direction during their movement on the x-z plane, and were used to maintain a uniform tension in the yarns throughout the braiding simulation. The tension of the yarns at the beginning of the virtual braiding process was not uniform among different yarns. This is because of the difference in the yarn length and the relative position of the yarns with respect to the forming point. In order to even out the tension in each yarn before the starting of the braiding process, the springs were pulled in the negative y-direction for two seconds while keeping the uppermost nodes fully constrained. From their initial position, the eyelets and the yarn ends with springs were moved along a prescribed path established by Eq. 10 on the x-z plane. Their velocity was equal to the maximum carriers’ velocity of the braiding machine used for the manufacture of microbraids.|$|E
