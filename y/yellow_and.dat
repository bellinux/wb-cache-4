5|$|When Nike {{took over}} from Adidas as Arsenal's kit {{provider}} in 1994, Arsenal's away colours were again changed to two-tone blue shirts and shorts. Since {{the advent of}} the lucrative replica kit market, the away kits have been changed regularly, with Arsenal usually releasing both away and third choice kits. During this period the designs have been either all blue designs, or variations on the traditional <b>yellow</b> <b>and</b> blue, such as the metallic gold and navy strip used in the 2001–02 season, the <b>yellow</b> <b>and</b> dark grey used from 2005 to 2007, and the <b>yellow</b> <b>and</b> maroon of 2010 to 2013.|$|E
