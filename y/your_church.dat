500|$|The tenor aria, [...] "" [...] (Come, Jesus, come to <b>Your</b> <b>Church),</b> is {{accompanied}} by the violins and violas in unison. It is written in the rhythm of a gigue, and the combination of voice, unison strings and continuo gives it the texture of a trio sonata. Dürr comments {{that the use of}} the unison string ritornello, played even during the vocal passages, provides a [...] "rather pointedly strict and unified character". The musicologist Richard Taruskin comments: [...] "This hybridization of operatic and instrumental styles is... standard operating procedure in Bach's cantatas." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{an initial}} review by Jesus Freak Hideout, Kevin Hoskins rated the album {{four out of}} five stars, calling the album solid but finding that the album's R {{passages}} [...] "pale in comparison to the other tracks stylistically and are not necessarily needed." [...] Hoskins listed the songs [...] "Falling Down," [...] "Power Trip," [...] "Lord Have Mercy," [...] and [...] "I Know" [...] as some of the best tunes, and called [...] "Lucky Ones" [...] a [...] "perfect song." [...] New Release Tuesday called Gravity one of the most anticipated releases of the year. In its review, the site gave the album {{four out of five}} stars, stating that the recording in many ways lives up to the anticipation, but had three or four too many songs that detract from the album's whole. Rapzilla was very favorable to the album, rating it four-point-five out of five and calling it the most important album in the history of Christian hip hop. The reviewer, Armond Goss, listed the tracks [...] "Lord Have Mercy", [...] "Fakin'", and [...] "Buttons" [...] the low points on the album, but said that those were the only problems that they found. [...] "Confe$$ions", [...] "Power Trip", and [...] "Gravity" [...] were all listed by as extremely strong, but Goss considered the track [...] "Mayday" [...] as the best [...] track [...] "sonically, lyrically and conceptually" [...] on the album, stating that DJ Khalil's production work [...] "provides the perfect backdrop for K.R.I.T. to walk into <b>your</b> <b>church</b> in the middle of service and express his frustrations with hypocrisies and for Crae to walk in behind him and calm the mob down while still co-signing K.R.I.T.’s verse." [...] The Houston Press summarized the album by stating that [...] "by and large, Gravity acts and dresses like a stand along rap album built from the same organ drenched and string heavy foundation that Houston's style of G-funk did in the '90s. It's another [...] "heavy" [...] rap album to drive away from the same escapism tactics rap loves to dwell in." ...|$|E
2500|$|How to Boost <b>Your</b> <b>Church</b> Attendance—Zondervan (January 1, 1961) ...|$|E
2500|$|Members {{were drawn}} {{from all of the}} Protestant churches: from the Roman, Greek, Syrian and Armenian Catholic churches; from Theosophy, Christian Science and Spiritualism; and from many Oriental religions. [...] Cayce's {{philosophy}} was, if it makes you a better member of <b>your</b> <b>church</b> then it's good; if it takes you away from <b>your</b> <b>church,</b> it's bad. [...] The philosophy of the readings was that truth is one, each organization is part of this one, therefore the A.R.E. was not to function as a schism or in opposition to any religious organization. [...] The goal of the work was not something new but something ancient and universal.|$|E
6000|$|Now, you feel, as I {{say this}} to you--I know you feel--as if I were trying {{to take away the}} honour of <b>your</b> <b>churches.</b> Not so; I am trying to prove to you the honour of your houses and your hills; not that the Church is not sacred--but that the whole Earth is. I would have you feel, what careless, what constant, what {{infectious}} sin there is in all modes of thought, whereby, in calling <b>your</b> <b>churches</b> only [...] "holy," [...] you call your hearths and homes [...] "profane"; and have separated yourselves from the heathen by casting all your household gods to the ground, instead of recognizing, in the place of their many and feeble Lares, the presence of your One and Mighty Lord and Lar.|$|R

2500|$|In 1979, Rev. Jacob Yasso of Chaldean Sacred Heart Church congratulated Saddam Hussein on his presidency. In return, Rev. Yasso {{said that}} Saddam Hussein donated US$250,000 to his church, {{which is made}} up of at least 1,200 {{families}} of Middle Eastern descent. In 1980, Detroit Mayor Coleman Young allowed Rev. Yasso to present the key to the city of Detroit to Saddam Hussein. At the time, Saddam then asked Rev. Yasso, [...] "I heard there was a debt on <b>your</b> <b>church.</b> How much is it?" [...] After the inquiry, Saddam then donated another $200,000 to Chaldean Sacred Heart Church. Rev. Yasso said that Saddam made donations to Chaldean churches all over the world, and even went on record as saying [...] "He's very kind to Christians." ...|$|E
2500|$|One notable {{reference}} in literature to La Virgen of Guadalupe and her predecessor, the Aztec Earth goddess Tonantzín, is in Sandra Cisneros' short story [...] "Little Miracles, Kept Promises," [...] from her collection Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories (1991). [...] Cisneros' story is constructed out of brief notes that people give Our Lady of Guadalupe in thanks for favors received, which in Cisneros' hands becomes {{a portrait of}} an extended Chicano community living throughout Texas. [...] "Little Miracles" [...] ends with an extended narrative (pp. 124-29) of a feminist artist, Rosario [...] "Chayo" [...] De Leon, who at first didn't allow images of La Virgen de Guadalupe in her home because she associated her with subservience and suffering, particularly by Mexican women. [...] But when she learns that Guadalupe's shrine is built on the same hill in Mexico City that had a shrine to Tonantzín, the Aztec Earth goddess and serpent destroyer, Chayo comes to understand that there's a deep, syncretic connection between the Aztec goddess and the Mexican saint; together they inspire Chayo's new artistic creativity, inner strength, and independence. [...] In Chayo's words, [...] "I finally understood who you are. [...] No longer Mary the mild, but our mother Tonantzín. [...] <b>Your</b> <b>church</b> at Tepeyac built {{on the site of}} her temple" [...] (128).|$|E

5000|$|In early April 1786, John Adams and Thomas Jefferson visited Fort Royal Hill at the {{battlefield}} at Worcester. Adams wrote Edgehill and Worcester were curious and interesting to us, as scenes where freemen had fought for their rights.

Tell your neighbors and your children that this is holy ground; much holier than that on which <b>your</b> <b>churches</b> stand. All England should come in pilgrimage to this hill once a year." [...] This animated them, and they seemed much pleased with it. Perhaps their awkwardness before might arise from their uncertainty of our sentiments concerning the civil wars. John Adams.|$|R
