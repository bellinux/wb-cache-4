5|$|Although the cheetah is an African cat, {{molecular}} {{evidence indicates}} that the three species of the Puma lineage evolved in North America two to three million <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> where they possibly had a common ancestor during the Miocene. They possibly diverged from this ancestor 8.25 million <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> The cheetah diverged from the puma and the jaguarundi around 6.7 million <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> A genome study concluded that cheetahs experienced two genetic bottlenecks in their history, the first about 100,000 <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> and the second about 12,000 <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> greatly lowering their genetic variability. These bottlenecks may {{have been associated with}} migrations across Asia and into Africa (with the current African population founded about 12,000 <b>years</b> <b>ago),</b> and/or with a depletion of prey species {{at the end of the}} Pleistocene.|$|E

However, a 2017 study on Ardipithecus ramidus challenges this belief. Scholarly opinions vary as to the developments since {{the appearance of the}} genus Homo some 2.5 million <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> Some scholars assume the development of primitive language-like systems (proto-language) as early as Homo habilis (2.3 million <b>years</b> <b>ago)</b> while others place the development of primitive symbolic communication only with Homo erectus (1.8 million <b>years</b> <b>ago)</b> or Homo heidelbergensis (0.6 million <b>years</b> <b>ago),</b> and the development of language proper with Anatomically Modern Homo sapiens with the Upper Paleolithic revolution less than 100,000 <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b>|$|E

Three primary eruption periods in the history of the massif have been identified: ancestral, older and present.

Between 1.0 million and 0.8 million <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> they partially collapsed, forming large (5–10km wide) calderas. During the older period, which lasted from 0.8 million to 0.2 million <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> a new complex of large stratovolcanoes developed (including Older Ruiz, Tolima, Quindio, and Santa Isabel).

5|$|As {{recently}} as the Cretaceous period 100million <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> much of western North America was still part of the Pacific Ocean. Tectonic forces from the collision of the Farallon Plate with the North American Plate pushed up the Rocky Mountains between 75 and 50million <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> in a mountain-building episode known as the Laramide orogeny. The Colorado first formed as a west-flowing stream draining the southwestern portion of the range, and the uplift also diverted the Green River from its original course to the Mississippi River west towards the Colorado. About 30 to 20million <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> volcanic activity related to the orogeny led to the Mid-Tertiary ignimbrite flare-up, which created smaller formations such as the Chiricahua Mountains in Arizona and deposited massive amounts of volcanic ash and debris over the watershed. The Colorado Plateau first began to rise during the Eocene, between about 55 and 34million <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> but did not attain its present height until about 5million <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> about when the Colorado River established its present course into the Gulf of California.|$|E

5|$|By about 15,000 <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> Equus ferus was a {{widespread}} holarctic species.

The reasons for this extinction are not fully known, but one theory notes that extinction in North America paralleled human arrival. Another theory points to climate change, noting that approximately 12,500 <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> the grasses characteristic of a steppe ecosystem gave way to shrub tundra, which was covered with unpalatable plants.|$|E
