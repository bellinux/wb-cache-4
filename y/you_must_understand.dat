500|$|Roddenberry {{was raised}} a Southern Baptist; however, as an adult, he {{rejected}} religion, and considered himself a humanist. He began questioning religion around {{the age of}} 14, {{and came to the}} conclusion that it was [...] "nonsense". As a child, he served in the choir at his local church, but often substituted lyrics as he sang hymns. Early in his writing career, he received an award from the American Baptist Convention for [...] "skillfully writing Christian truth and the application of Christian principles into commercial, dramatic TV scripts". For several years, he corresponded with John M. Gunn of the National Council of Churches regarding the application of Christian teachings in television series. However, Gunn stopped replying after Roddenberry wrote in a letter: [...] "But <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>understand</b> that I am a complete pagan, and consume enormous amounts of bread, having found the Word more spice than nourishment, so I am interested in a statement couched in dollars and cents of what this means to the Roddenberry treasury." ...|$|E

He clearly desired his readers to infer that he had arrived at certain of my theories (the result of ten years of hard labour in the veld) by his own unaided reason, although he admits that he never saw a termite in his life. <b>You</b> <b>must</b> <b>understand</b> that it was not merely plagiarism of the spirit of a thing, so to speak.

2500|$|West {{attempted}} to cast his work overseas in historical terms, theorizing that America is {{following in the}} footsteps of Charles Martel at the Battle of Tours, or the 300 Spartan Hoplites at the Battle of Thermopylae, in defending Western civilization against Muslim threats from the Middle East. In speaking on what he believed to be Islam's proclivity for violence, West remarked that [...] "Something happened when Mohammed enacted the Hijra and he left Mecca and he went out to Medina, it became violence." [...] Because of this view, in February2011, West cited the threat of [...] "radical Islamic terrorists" [...] as his motivation for voting to extend provisions of the Patriot Act; He voted against another extension in May 2011. When asked during an interview with The Shalom Show how he would work with others [...] "like Keith Ellison, who supports Islam," [...] West stated that Ellison, a Minnesota representative and practicing Muslim, represents the [...] "antithesis of the principles upon which this country was established." [...] West later argued that his initial comment was misconstrued. He said the comments were [...] "not about his Islamic faith, but about his continued support of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR)." [...] In a Boynton Beach Town Hall meeting, West told the Miami leader of CAIR that [...] "I will always defend your right to practice a free religion under the First Amendment, but what <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>understand,</b> if I am speaking the truth, I am not going to stop speaking the truth. The truth is not subjective." ...|$|E
