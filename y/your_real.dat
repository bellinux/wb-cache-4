25|$|Looking at {{an image}} of oneself with the front-back axis flipped results in the {{perception}} of an image with its left-right axis flipped. When reflected in the mirror, your right hand remains directly opposite <b>your</b> <b>real</b> right hand, but it is perceived as the left hand of your image. When a person looks into a mirror, the image is actually front-back reversed, which is an effect similar to the hollow-mask illusion. Notice that a mirror image is fundamentally different from the object and cannot be reproduced by simply rotating the object.|$|E

He {{grew up in a}} family of seven children, though the only one of mixed descent as his father was a US Army soldier of Caribbean descent.

Acevedo suggested that his wife, actress Kiersten Warren, play his character's wife Sonia, and the producers duly cast her. Acevedo explained his choice was because, [...] "to create intimacy with someone who you don't know is actually not going to work.

500|$|Julie Emery from Heat criticised Fatboy's fashion sense, {{especially}} from the episode broadcast on 12 May 2011, saying [...] "We know clashing prints are soooooo this season, but really, Fatboy, they do nothing for you. And while we're at it, stop wearing that tinny 'F' round your neck, for flip's sake. You're not a gangster rapper, and anyway <b>your</b> <b>real</b> name's Arthur." [...] Emery also said the storyline where Fatboy asks Mercy to marry him so she {{can stay in the}} country sounded [...] "somewhat familiar", as Coronation Street was featuring a similar storyline at the same time. Amy Duncan from the Metro said Fatboy was one of her favourite young characters in EastEnders and said that, with Poppy, he [...] "bring some much-needed light into the soap". Vicky Prior from the Metro said that Fatboy [...] "is easily one of the best characters in EastEnders, able to interact seamlessly with other characters, both young and old." ...|$|E

In Colorado, he worked as a cowboy alongside the professional [...] "punchers", moving cattle and doing ranch chores. He visited the Navajo in Arizona and gained an understanding of Native American culture. When his money was stolen, he worked as a mail carrier, riding between the Two Grey Hills trading post and Fort Defiance, to earn enough to get back home. He wrote home, [...] "The life is wonderful, strange—the fascination of it clutches me like some unseen animal—it seems to whisper, 'Come back, you belong here, this is <b>your</b> <b>real</b> home.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{historical}} text Han Jin Chunqiu {{mentioned that}} Cao Rui had all along {{been aware of}} his mother's fate, and he was angry and sad about it. After he became emperor, his stepmother Guo Nüwang became the empress dowager. When he asked her about how his mother died, Guo replied, [...] "The Late Emperor {{was the one who}} ordered her death, so why are you asking me? You're your father's son so you can blame your dead father. Are you going to kill your stepmother for <b>your</b> <b>real</b> mother?" [...] Cao Rui turned furious and forced Empress Dowager Guo to commit suicide. He had her buried with the funeral rites befitting that of an empress, but also ordered her dead body to be treated {{in the same manner as}} she did to his mother – hair covering face, mouth stuffed with rice husks. However, the historical text Weilüe stated that after Empress Dowager Guo died of illness in 235, Cao Pi's concubine Lady Li (李夫人) told Cao Rui about the fate of his mother. Cao Rui was deeply grieved and he ordered Guo's dead body to be treated in the same manner as she did to his mother.|$|E

Osman was the only person charged over the initial confrontation. The Magistrate, Jacqueline Trad (herself of Lebanese descent) told Sutherland Local Court that Osman had turned his back on his real country: [...] "By this sort of conduct you turned your back on your family, your culture and <b>your</b> <b>real</b> country, all for the sake of some juvenile, impulsive and misplaced allegiance.... Over the last 100 years or so, the ancestors of many citizens – mine included – came to this country seeking refuge from hatred, intolerance, violence or just simply the opportunity to improve their families' prospects." [...] Yahya Jamal Serhan was arrested over the stabbing of [...] "Dan" [...] on 12 December and charged with affray and maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm and was sentenced to 13 months jail but was immediately released after having already spent nine months in custody awaiting trial.
