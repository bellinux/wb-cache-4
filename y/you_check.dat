[...] When an attorney for Tom Cruise read reports that Morton had obtained letters asserting Cruise had a homosexual affair while filming Eyes Wide Shut, he commented on a November 2005 letter he had written to Morton: [...] "I {{wrote a letter to}} Mr. Morton back in November and said he obviously was entitled to write the book but 'make sure <b>you</b> <b>check</b> your facts'. If he tries to use my letter to create the impression that Mr. Cruise did have a gay affair, we will certainly sue … because the story is false. Mr. Cruise is not gay." [...] In an interview with InTouch Weekly, Cruise's attorney Bertram Fields commented on the book: [...] "To the extent that Mr. Morton's book sticks to the truth, it can't 'ruin' or 'harm' Tom … My guess is this book will be dull except for those parts that are lies." [...] Cruise's publicist also stated that the book will consist of fabricated lies.|$|E

It is {{not a substitute for}} use of the Thesis Manual. The Office of Graduate Studies and Research provides a template for creating your thesis, we suggest that you use it. Don’t forget to schedule a pre-submittal conference with the Thesis office. The online pre-submittal conference is available from the Office of Graduate Studies and Research website for additional help. General Concerns Use the Thesis Manual as a tool while work is in preparation. Have <b>you</b> <b>checked</b> for uniform typeface (font and point size) and vertical spacing in the text? Have <b>you</b> <b>checked</b> for uniform text justification style? Text may be either fully justified or left aligned. Either way, the style needs to remain consistent throughout the document Is all text within the prescribed margins? Left, right, top and bottom margins should be 1 ”. Are all page numbers in the top right corner? (Page numbers should be approximately ” from the top edge of the paper and 1 ” from the right edge.) Have <b>you</b> spell <b>checked</b> the entire document? Also, have <b>you</b> <b>checked</b> all titles that are in all capital letters for correct spelling? (Spell check does not always pick up errors in words in all capital letters.) Have <b>you</b> <b>checked</b> for correct grammar? Once you submit your manuscript, there can be no further corrections. The only changes will come from the Thesis Office. Are equations the same font and point size as the text? Are the pages numbered correctly with the preliminary pages (beginning with the Abstract, p. iii) in Roman numerals and the text (beginning with the first page of Chapter I or the first section) in Arabic numbers (beginning with 1) ? Has any of the material in your thesis been published? If so, check with the Thesis Office for instructions.

A robin's hop is half a flight; he hops, very essentially, with wings and tail, {{as well as}} with his feet, and the exquisitely rapid opening and quivering of the tail-feathers {{certainly}} give half the force to his leap. It is in this action that he is put among the motacillae, or wagtails; but the ornithologists have no real business to put him among them. The swing of the long tail feathers in the true wagtail is entirely consequent on its motion, not impulsive of it--the tremulous shake is after alighting. But the robin leaps with wing, tail, and foot, all in time, and all helping each other. Leaps, I say; and <b>you</b> <b>check</b> at the word; and ought to check: you look at a bird hopping, and the motion is so much a matter of course, you never think how it is done. But do you think you would find it easy to hop like a robin if you had two--all but wooden--legs, like this? ...|$|E
