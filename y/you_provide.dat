500|$|Clinton {{opposed the}} Iraq War troop surge of 2007, for both {{military}} and domestic political reasons (by the following year, she was privately acknowledging that the surge had been successful). In March of that year, she {{voted in favor}} of a war-spending bill that required President Bush to begin withdrawing troops from Iraq by a deadline; it passed almost completely along party lines but was subsequently vetoed by Bush. In May, a compromise war funding bill that removed withdrawal deadlines but tied funding to progress benchmarks for the Iraqi government passed the Senate by a vote of 80–14 and would be signed by Bush; Clinton {{was one of those who}} voted against it. Clinton responded to General David Petraeus's September 2007 Report to Congress on the Situation in Iraq by saying, [...] "I think that the reports that <b>you</b> <b>provide</b> to us really require a willing suspension of disbelief." ...|$|E

2500|$|There are {{conflicting}} {{accounts of}} Diogenes' death. He is alleged variously to have held his breath; {{to have become}} ill from eating raw octopus; or to have suffered an infected dog bite. When asked how he wished to be buried, he left instructions to be thrown outside the city wall so wild animals could feast on his body. When asked if he minded this, he said, [...] "Not at all, as long as <b>you</b> <b>provide</b> me with a stick to chase the creatures away!" [...] When asked how he could use the stick since he would lack awareness, he replied [...] "If I lack awareness, then why should I care what happens to me when I am dead?" [...] At the end, Diogenes made fun of people's excessive concern with the [...] "proper" [...] treatment of the dead. The Corinthians erected to his memory a pillar on which rested a dog of Parian marble.|$|E
2500|$|The Wei Shu (魏書; Book of Wei) and the Jiuzhou Chunqiu (九州春秋) gave {{different}} accounts on how Lu Su urged Sun Quan {{to go to}} {{war with}} Cao Cao. Lu Su attempted to use reverse psychology to persuade his lord by saying, [...] "Cao Cao is truly a formidable foe. He has engulfed Yuan Shao's territories and his military forces are very powerful. If he uses the might of a victorious army to invade a state that is weak and chaotic, he'll definitely win. Why don't we despatch our troops to assist him, while you send your family to Ye (Cao Cao's base in northern China)? If not, we'll be in danger." [...] Sun Quan turned furious and wanted to execute Lu Su, but Lu said again, [...] "The current situation is very urgent. Since you've other plans, why don't <b>you</b> <b>provide</b> aid to Liu Bei instead of executing me?" [...] Sun Quan agreed with Lu Su's idea, so he ordered Zhou Yu to lead his forces to help Liu Bei.|$|E

Maliki responded angrily to the suggestion, saying [...] "There are American officials who consider Iraq as if it were one of their villages, for example Hillary Clinton and Carl Levin ... This is severe interference in our domestic affairs."
