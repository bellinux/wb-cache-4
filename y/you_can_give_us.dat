6000|$|... "As {{a matter}} of course we are most anxious to reach some place from which we can find a steamer or sailing vessel going to the United States. Probably <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> the proper information, and by that means get rid of {{unexpected}} and, perhaps, unwelcome visitors." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Mr. George, [...] "we shall {{want to be}} out at that time. We {{will take}} {{something}} now {{as soon as we can}} have it. <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> a beefsteak?" ...|$|R

6000|$|Pleasant indeed {{was that}} morn that dawned o'er the barroom at Angels, [...] Where in their manhood's prime was {{gathered}} {{the pride of}} the hamlet.

6000|$|... "In that case, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> {{no further}} information. Would you please {{remain in the}} room? Stand over there near the bedroom door.

5000|$|I was {{managing}} {{the band and}} we had no demo tape, we had no money, but we wanted to play a show. I was working at the bank and between wire transfers, I would be calling the Roxy. 'Hey, <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> a show, man? Eddie, <b>give</b> <b>us</b> a show.' He'd say, 'I need a demo tape, I can't just give you a show.' In five minutes, I'd call again. One day the Roxy just blew up and said, 'Fine! Go sell 75 tickets.' We sold 150.|$|R
6000|$|... "Call it {{what you}} will," [...] Mr. Gaynsforth continued, {{with an air of}} not having heard the interruption, [...] "we have the money and we want the information. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>give</b> it to <b>us</b> if you like. We don't ask for too much. We don't even ask for the name of the man who {{committed}} these crimes. But we do want to know the nature of those papers, exactly what position Mr. Hamilton Fynes occupied in the Stamp and Excise Duty department at Washington, and, finally, what the mischief you are doing over here in Paris." ...|$|R
2500|$|After rehearsing {{and writing}} songs over the summer, they {{recorded}} their first demo in late August, making 100 cassettes, with artwork by Squire, {{and set about}} trying to get gigs. They played their first gig as the Stone Roses on 23 October 1984, supporting Pete Townshend at an anti-heroin concert at the Moonlight Club in London, Brown having sent the demo with an accompanying letter stating [...] "I'm surrounded by skagheads, I wanna smash 'em. <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> a show?". The show was seen by journalists including Sounds Gary Johnson, who arranged to interview the band a few weeks later. The band received management offers and more gigs soon followed.|$|R
6000|$|... 'But,' {{said the}} townsmen, 'we {{have a great}} charge of poor upon our hands already, and we must {{take care not to}} {{increase}} it; we suppose <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> no security against your being chargeable to our parish and to the inhabitants, any more than you can of being dangerous to us as to the infection.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I {{would like}} to see you,” said a gentleman {{at the close of the}} engagement. “I belong across the river about ten miles north of here. The folks are going to give a sociable, as we call it. I will give you twenty dollars if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> a {{first-class}} entertainment to last two hours.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Uncover, Caleb! uncover, for Heaven's sake!" [...] said Bucklaw; [...] "let us {{have what}} <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> without preface. Why, it stands well enough, man," [...] he continued, {{addressing}} impatiently the ancient butler, who, without reply, kept shifting the dish, {{until he had}} at length placed it with mathematical precision in the very midst of the table.|$|E
50|$|Albert and Bernard {{now want}} to know how old Cheryl is.Cheryl: I have two younger brothers. The product of all our ages (i.e. my age and the ages of my two brothers) is 144, {{assuming}} that we use whole numbers for our ages. Albert: We still don't know your age. What other hints <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>us?</b> Cheryl: The sum of all our ages is the bus number of this bus that we are on. Bernard: Of course we know the bus number, but we still don't know your age. Cheryl: Oh, I forgot to tell you that my brothers have the same age. Albert and Bernard: Oh, now we know your age.|$|R
5000|$|Throughout December 2014, Banks {{released}} {{a series of}} videos in which she broke down tracks from Broke with Expensive Taste and revealed how each song came to be, dubbed the '16 Days of Azealia'. During the breakdown video for [...] "Chasing Time", Banks revealed that the song was conceived after the aforementioned occasion of her handing a completed version of the album in to her labels. In response to their request that Banks created something more current, she produced [...] "Chasing Time". This was further confirmed {{in an interview with}} Pitchfork Medias Jeremy Gordon, in which Banks said [...] "it got to a point where they were like, 'Azealia, we get it, you’re cool, but we've spent $2 million on this record, <b>can</b> <b>you</b> just <b>give</b> <b>us</b> one hit?' So then I did 'Chasing Time', and I was just like, 'You know, this isn't gonna work out.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|Coming in {{to dress}} for dinner, I found a telegram: [...] "Mrs. Stormer dying; <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> half a column for to-morrow evening? Let her off easy, but not too easy." [...] I was late; I was in a hurry; I had very little time to think, but at a venture I {{dispatched}} a reply: [...] "Will do what I can." [...] It was not till I had dressed and was rolling away to dinner that, in the hansom, I bethought myself {{of the difficulty of}} the condition attached. The difficulty was not of course in letting her off easy but in qualifying that indulgence. [...] "I simply won't qualify it," [...] I said to myself. I didn't admire her, but I liked her, and I had known her so long that I almost felt heartless in sitting down at such an hour to a feast of indifference. I must have seemed abstracted, for the early years of my acquaintance with her came back to me. I spoke of her to the lady I had taken down, hut the lady I had taken down had never heard of Greville Fane. I tried my other neighbour, who pronounced her books [...] "too vile." [...] I had never thought them very good, but I should let her off easier than that.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Dick, {{you jump}} up behind me," [...] his father said. [...] "Dunlop can take you, Ned; and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> a short {{account of what}} has befallen you as we ride back. We must get {{you a couple of}} horses of some kind or another at Synee. Can't you cast off these women's clothes?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The plain is {{free from}} red-skins, to-night at least," [...] said Ishmael, after {{the bustle of}} {{reception}} had a little subsided; [...] "for I have scoured the prairie for many long miles, on my own feet, and I call myself a judge of the print of an Indian moccasin. So, old woman, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> a few steaks of the venison, {{and then we will}} sleep on the day's work." ...|$|E
6000|$|There was {{a little}} murmur from the men, but Sewell raised his hand restrainingly. [...] "We had," [...] he said, with a {{quietness}} which had, nevertheless, a suggestion of irony in it, [...] "the honour of pointing out to you some of our difficulties and suggesting how they could be obviated. We may now take it that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> no assurance that the matter will even receive the attention we, at least, think necessary?" ...|$|E

6000|$|The Easter {{holidays}} {{that year}} were unusually genial; mild watery sunshine assisted {{the progress of}} the spring. The high dense hedges, in Warwickshire, were like walls of hawthorn embedded in banks of primrose, and the finest trees in England, springing out of them with a regularity which suggested conservative principles, began more densely and downily to bristle. Rupert Waterville, devoted to his duties and faithful in attendance at the Legation, had had little time to enjoy the rural hospitality that shows the English, as he had promptly learned to say, at their best. Freshly yet not wildly exotic he had repeatedly been invited to grace such scenes, but had had hitherto to practise with reserve the great native art of “staying.” He cultivated method and kept the country-houses in reserve; he would take them up in their order, after he should have got a little more used to London. Without hesitation, however, he had accepted the appeal from Longlands; it had come to him in a simple and familiar note from Lady Demesne, with whom he had no acquaintance. He knew of her return from Cannes, where she had spent the whole winter, for he had seen it related in a Sunday newspaper; yet it was with a certain surprise that he heard from her in these informal terms. “Dear Mr. Waterville, my son tells me you will perhaps be able to come down here on the seventeenth to spend two or three days. If <b>you</b> <b>can</b> it will <b>give</b> <b>us</b> much pleasure. We <b>can</b> promise <b>you</b> the society of your charming countrywoman Mrs. Headway.” ...|$|R
6000|$|I was {{extremely}} {{interested in your}} Fiji legend, and perhaps even more so in your capital account of the CURACOA'S misadventure. [...] Alas! we have nothing so thrilling to relate. All hangs and fools on in this isle of misgovernment, without change, though not without novelty, but wholly without hope, unless perhaps you should consider it hopeful that I am still more immediately threatened with arrest. The confounded thing is, that if it comes off, I shall be sent away in the Ringarooma instead of the CURACOA. The former ship burst upon by the run - she had been sent off by despatch and without orders - and to make me a little more easy in my mind she brought newspapers clamouring for my incarceration. [...] Since then I have {{had a conversation with}} the German Consul. He said he had read a review of my Samoa book, and if the review were fair, must regard it as an insult, and one {{that would have to be}} resented. At the same time, I learn that letters addressed to the German squadron lie for them here in the Post Office. Reports are current of other English ships being on the way - I hope to goodness yours will be among the number. And I gather from one thing and another that there must be a holy row going on between the powers at home, and that the issue (like all else connected with Samoa) is on the knees of the gods. One thing, however, is pretty sure - if that issue prove to be a German Protectorate, I shall have to tramp. <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> any advice as to a fresh field of energy? We have been searching the atlas, and it seems difficult to fill the bill. How would Rarotonga do? I forget if you have been there. The best of it is that my new house is going up like winking, and I am dictating this letter to the accompaniment of saws and hammers. A hundred black boys and about a score draught-oxen perished, or at least barely escaped with their lives, from the mud-holes on our road, bringing up the materials. It will be a fine legacy to H.I.G.M.'s Protectorate, and doubtless the Governor will take it for his country-house. The Ringarooma people, by the way, seem very nice. I liked Stansfield particularly.|$|R
