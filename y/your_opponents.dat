This second edition is more a spin-off as the winning condition has changed to completing your passport instead of bankrupting <b>your</b> <b>opponents.</b> Community Chest is replaced with Here and Now cards while the Here and Now space replaced the railroads. Houses and hotels have been removed.|$|E
500|$|Point System - Depending on the {{character}} and LARP, your PC will {{have some form of}} Body and/or Armor that is measured nominally. Weapons also have a numerical value assigned, where upon a successful weapon strike you deal 'damage' equal to the number associated with your weapon type. This damage is dealt against <b>your</b> <b>opponents</b> Body/Armor. Typically, once you reach 0 body or less, you then begin the death stage which will be found in the [...] A subset of the point system is the Location System, where points vary depending on where your opponent is struck. If they are wearing armor in that location, then the 'damage dealt' effects their Armor Points (AP), versus if you strike a location without armor you deal damage against <b>your</b> <b>opponents</b> Body Points (BP). The majority of LARP's utilize this system.|$|E
500|$|Player's {{are matched}} {{in groups of}} 3 v 3 by a ranking system. [...] Commonly {{referred}} to as Elo/ELO in game chat, the rank points you earn from match wins will go up and so as you improve, so will the skill of <b>your</b> <b>opponents.</b> [...] Elo is named after Arpad Elo, the mathematician and chess grand master who invented the rank score system that {{may be at the}} heart of rank scores in VainGlory.|$|E

500|$|The game's {{controls}} were well received. The D-Pad Destroyer of GamePro praised the controls as [...] "nearly-perfect" [...] {{and explained that}} [...] "the transparent controls allow you to concentrate on racing and blasting <b>your</b> <b>opponents,</b> and so the races are faster, more fluid and more fun." [...] Johnny Liu of Game Revolution concluded that the controls [...] "feel very natural, {{with an emphasis on}} maintaining speed rather than fighting lousy controls." [...] However, Joe Ottoson of Allgame ("All Game Guide" [...] at the time) said that the inability to reconfigure the controls was [...] "the only real drawback to Crashs presentation." ...|$|E
500|$|Matos was broadly {{critical}} of the game's multiplayer mode, though he singled out some elements, such as the maps, as well-designed. He disliked the connection to single-player mode, calling it [...] "a weird narrative tie-in", and was concerned that although the gameplay translates well into the multiplayer element, [...] "the entire experience may be too chaotic to enrapture a large audience...it doesn't feel deep enough to command {{much more than a}} furiously dedicated fan following". Simmons was more positive, saying that the multiplayer mode is [...] "a genuinely fresh addition...that successfully carries over many of the hallmarks of the much-loved single-player [...] ". He singled out Team Favor of the Gods as his favorite mode, but did not feel that the combat offered enough depth to make multiplayer [...] "a truly engaging experience", describing it instead as [...] "a curiosity that provides a few hours of enjoyment rather than being an essential addition". The review from Edge magazine described multiplayer mode as [...] "chaotic at first", with overwhelming options, but said that it becomes easier as players learn the levels. The Edge review identified the fixed camera system as an asset because [...] "you can always see exactly what's going on and fight <b>your</b> <b>opponents</b> instead of the viewpoint", and also praised the color-coding system, which [...] "effectively lets you know when you have an opening and when to run".|$|E
2500|$|Wired {{magazine}} believes Monopoly is {{a poorly}} designed game. Former Wall Streeter Derk Solko explains, [...] "Monopoly has you grinding <b>your</b> <b>opponents</b> into dust. It's {{a very negative}} experience. It's all about cackling when your opponent lands on your space {{and you get to}} take all their money." ...|$|E

5000|$|If <b>your</b> <b>opponent's</b> {{sword is}} pointed at you, it is [...] "check". If this check occurs when your sword was not already pointed at <b>your</b> <b>opponent,</b> <b>your</b> only legal move is to rotate your cube. If your sword was pointed at <b>your</b> <b>opponent,</b> you must instead roll in {{whichever}} direction your samurai is facing.|$|R
50|$|Be alert if <b>your</b> <b>opponent</b> drops a 2 or a 10, or {{tries to}} build {{combinations}} adding to 10 - <b>your</b> <b>opponent</b> {{may be trying}} to fish them out with the 2 of clubs or the 10 of diamonds. If you cannot fish these cards out yourself, you may want to collect other cards that will force <b>your</b> <b>opponent</b> to leave you with a bastra opportunity if <b>your</b> <b>opponent</b> decides to go ahead and collect the point card. For example, let's say <b>your</b> <b>opponent</b> plays the 10 of hearts and the board now shows 3, 8 and 10. If you had an 8, {{it would be wise to}} fish out the 8, that way, if <b>your</b> <b>opponent</b> did indeed have the 10 of diamonds, this would leave you a potential bastra with the 3 should <b>your</b> <b>opponent</b> decide to go ahead and fish out the 10. You could also solve this problem by clearing the board with a jack. In the same vein, try to avoid playing combinations that add up to 10, if the 10 of diamonds remains to be played.|$|R
2500|$|Players {{would throw}} the disk down a [...] {{corridor}} {{so that it}} could roll past the players at great speed. As the disk rolled down the corridor, players would throw wooden shafts at it. The object of the game was to strike the disk or prevent <b>your</b> <b>opponents</b> from hitting it.|$|E
2500|$|Welliington's {{condition}} improved {{over the}} remaining {{three days before the}} race, thanks in part to a new course of antibiotics, and continued ART and acupuncture treatments. In public, consistent with her mantra of [...] "never give <b>your</b> <b>opponents</b> anything", Wellington admitted to little more than road rash, but journalists at the pre-race press conference were, correctly, able to detect a different, less confident, attitude in Wellington before the race.|$|E
2500|$|In the 2012 Republican presidential primary, DeWine {{endorsed}} Tim Pawlenty, then endorsed Mitt Romney after Pawlenty {{dropped out}} of the race. On February 17, 2012, DeWine announced he was retracting his endorsement of Mitt Romney and endorsed Rick Santorum. DeWine said, [...] "To be elected president, you have to do more than tear down <b>your</b> <b>opponents.</b> You have to give the American people a reason to vote for you, a reason to hope, a reason to believe that under your leadership, America will be better. Rick Santorum has done that. Sadly, Governor Romney has not." ...|$|E

2500|$|Gameplay-wise, Kasumi {{was noted}} {{as one of}} the top {{characters}} in the series. IGN called Kasumi [...] "one of the deadliest fighters in all of DOA, because she has surprising reach and can attack from greater distances than the other girls," [...] adding she [...] "is one of the rare characters to come equipped with a blade and with lightning fast attacks, she can take down opponents in record time." [...] According to Anthony Chau's GameSpy guide for Dead or Alive 3, [...] "Kasumi's all-around game combined with her quickness makes her one of the best fighters for any level of player. Strong stunning attacks, great combinations, and her speed, she's got it all." [...] In GameSpot's guide to Dead or Alive 4, Matthew Rorie wrote Kasumi is [...] "an interesting character for many reasons. While she doesn't rely on brute strength to get the job done, she has a dizzying array of quick strikes and more than a few teleportation moves to dazzle <b>your</b> <b>opponents</b> and pull them off guard, allowing you to sneak behind them and attack from the rear, or just confuse them mightily." ...|$|E

6000|$|He {{spoke with}} sincerity and evident goodwill; but {{unfortunately}} Haldane {{was almost the}} last person from whom I could accept a favor. [...] "I am, while grateful, not wholly defeated, and mean to hold on," [...] I said. [...] "Would you, for instance, quietly back out of a conflict with some wealthy combine and leave <b>your</b> <b>opponents</b> a free hand to collect the plunder?" ...|$|E
5000|$|A related {{strategy}} is to foul up the ball and intentionally serve it into <b>your</b> <b>opponent's</b> cup. If {{you are able to}} sink it later, <b>your</b> <b>opponent</b> must drink a fouled beverage. This is known as [...] "intentional gorfing".|$|R

6000|$|... "Mr. Short," [...] {{said the}} Judge, {{clearing}} his throat, [...] "I do not often speak {{in such a}} sense, but I do feel called upon to compliment you upon {{the way in which}} you have, single-handed, conducted this case--in some ways one of the strangest and most important that has ever come before me--having for <b>your</b> <b>opponents</b> so formidable an array of learned gentlemen. The performance would have been creditable to anybody of greater experience and longer years; as it is, I believe it to be unprecedented." ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{the course}} of half-an-hour or so, when {{everybody}} is dead beat, the game--the original game--is resumed. You demand the score; your partner promptly says it is [...] "forty-fifteen." [...] Both <b>your</b> <b>opponents</b> rush up to the net, and apparently {{there is going to}} be a duel. It is only a friendly altercation; they very much doubt its being [...] "forty-fifteen." [...] "Fifteen-forty" [...] they could believe; they suggest it as a compromise. The discussion is concluded by calling it deuce. As it is rare for a game to proceed without some such incident occurring in the middle of it, the score generally is deuce. This avoids heart-burning; nobody wins a set and nobody loses. The one game generally suffices for the afternoon.|$|E
6000|$|Colonel Grant did not {{immediately}} answer the question. He preferred to continue his narrative. [...] "That night I had the false major arrested very quietly. I have caused him to disappear for the present. His Lisbon friends believe him {{to be on his}} way to Massena with the information they no doubt supplied him. Massena awaits his return at Salamanca, and will continue to wait. Thus when he fails to be seen or heard of there will be a good deal of mystification on all sides, which is the proper state of mind in which to place <b>your</b> <b>opponents.</b> Lord Liverpool's figures, let me add, were not among the interesting notes found upon him--possibly because at that date they had not yet been obtained." ...|$|E

60|$|Of {{course he}} would put it more suavely than that, though it is not, I think, by {{gentleness}} that you will get your rights; we are dogged ones at sticking {{to what we have}} got, and so will you be at our age. But avoid calling us ugly names; we may be stubborn and we may be blunderers, but we love you more than aught else in the world, and once you have won your partnership we shall all be welcoming you. I urge you not to use ugly names about anyone. In the war it was not the fighting men who were distinguished for abuse; as has been well said, 'Hell hath no fury like a non-combatant.' Never ascribe to an opponent motives meaner than your own. There may be students here to-day who have decided this session to go in for immortality, and would like to know of an easy way of accomplishing it. That is a way, but not so easy as you think. Go through life without ever ascribing to <b>your</b> <b>opponents</b> motives meaner than your own. Nothing so lowers the moral currency; give it up, and be great.|$|E

"I take no {{interest}} whatever," [...] said she, [...] "excepting that I have heard you are both eccentric and respectable, and that I have found you amusing, {{and in this}} class of people I am always interested.

So you see that I should really be acting for the girl, and not for you, although of course it would amount to the same thing. And if Mother Anastasia has gone to pull down the curtain on this little drama, I am all the more anxious to jerk it up again. Come, now, Mr. Lover in Check,--and when I first heard your name I had no idea how well it fitted,--confide in me. It would delight me to be in this fight; and you can see for yourself that it would be a very humdrum matter for me to join <b>your</b> <b>opponents,</b> even if I should be of their opinion.

"Brave leaders, and you, my people, I have {{contrived}} the pastime {{today that}} I may show {{you on a}} mimic scale the deeds which my brave soldiers {{are called upon to}} perform in France. It is more specially suited for the combatants of today, since one party have had but small opportunity of acquiring skill on horseback. Moreover, I wish to teach the lesson that fighting on foot is as honourable as fighting on horseback, for it has now been proved, and sometimes to our cost, in Scotland, that footmen can repulse even the bravest chivalry. Today each party will fight his best. Remember that, even in the heat of conflict, matters must not be carried to an extreme. Those cut off from their friends will be accounted prisoners, as will those who, being overpowered, throw down their arms. Any wounded on either side will not be accounted as prisoners, but may retire with honour from the field.
