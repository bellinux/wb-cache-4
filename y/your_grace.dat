[...] His portrait was painted many times; after sitting for Sir William Orpen in 1924, Lang reportedly remarked to Bishop Hensley Henson of Durham that the portrait showed him as [...] "proud, prelatical and pompous".

500|$|The best-known anecdote of Henson, {{according}} to Chadwick, {{comes from his}} time at Durham. Cosmo Lang complained that his portrait by Orpen [...] "makes me look proud, pompous and prelatical", to which Henson responded, [...] "And to which of those epithets does <b>your</b> <b>Grace</b> take exception?" [...] Grimley remarks that on occasion each of those unflattering adjectives applied just as much to Henson. Nonetheless, Henson ranked Lang [...] "among the greater figures of ecclesiastical history".|$|E
500|$|On {{an unknown}} date in 1702, the 1st Duke of Richmond's XI {{defeated}} an Arundel XI at an unspecified venue in Sussex. The source for {{this game is}} a receipt sent by one Saul Bradley to the Duke on Monday, 14 December 1702. The receipt was for one shilling and six pence paid by the Duke [...] "for brandy when <b>your</b> <b>Grace</b> plaid at Cricket with Arundel men". It is thought the brandy was bought to celebrate a victory. The venue was probably either Goodwood, where Richmond had his estate, or Arundel, possibly on Bury Hill which was used for cricket in later years. Arundel was a prominent centre of cricket in the 18th century.|$|E

500|$|Cornwallis {{believed}} that the terms of union should include Catholic emancipation. [...] While some rights had been restored in the early 1790s, Catholics were still denied elective offices and other rights. [...] Almost everyone in the establishments of Dublin and London, including the king and much of Pitt's cabinet, opposed this, leading Cornwallis to write that [...] "some mode must be adopted to soften the hatred of the Catholics to our government". In {{a letter to the}} Home Secretary he wrote, [...] "I trust that <b>your</b> <b>grace</b> and His Majesty's other ministers will on no account consent to the insertion of any clause which shall unalterably bind the United Parliament to persevere in the exclusion of Catholics." [...] Protestants, including the Lord Chancellor, Lord Clare, who favoured union, opposed Catholic emancipation. [...] "I trust, and I hope I am not deceived, that they are fairly inclined to give them up, and to bring [...] forward unencumbered with the doctrine of emancipation." [...] King George, after Cornwallis' appointment, wrote to Pitt that [...] "Cornwallis must clearly understand that no indulgence can be granted to the Catholics farther than has been". Cornwallis' efforts to include support for emancipation clearly had negative repercussions. [...] One Protestant wrote, [...] "his silly conduct, his total incapacity, and self conceit and mulishness have alone lost the question [...] ", while another wrote to Castlereagh that Cornwallis had been rendered [...] "not only an object of disgust, but of abhorrence." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{his final}} days Cranmer's {{circumstances}} changed, {{which led to}} several recantations. On 11 December, Cranmer {{was taken out of}} Bocardo and placed in the house of the Dean of Christ Church. This new environment was very different from that of his two years in prison. He was in an academic community and treated as a guest. Approached by a Dominican friar, Juan de Villagarcia, he debated the issues of papal supremacy and purgatory. In his first four recantations, produced between the end of January and mid-February, Cranmer submitted himself to the authority of the king and queen and recognised the pope as head of the church. On 14 February 1556, he was degraded from holy orders and returned to Bocardo. He had conceded very little and Edmund Bonner was not satisfied with these admissions. On 24 February a writ was issued to the mayor of Oxford and the date of Cranmer's execution was set for 7 March. Two days after the writ was issued, a fifth statement, the first which could be called a true recantation was issued. Cranmer repudiated all Lutheran and Zwinglian theology, fully accepted Catholic theology including papal supremacy and transubstantiation, and stated that there was no salvation outside the Catholic Church. He announced his joy of returning to the Catholic faith, asked for and received sacramental absolution, and participated in the mass. Cranmer's burning was postponed and under normal practice of canon law, he should have been absolved. Mary, however, decided that no further postponement was possible. His last recantation was issued on 18 March. It was a sign of a broken man, a sweeping confession of sin. Despite the stipulation in Canon Law that recanting heretics be reprieved, Mary was determined to make an example of Cranmer, arguing that [...] "his iniquity and obstinacy was so great against God and <b>your</b> <b>Grace</b> that your clemency and mercy could have no place with him", and pressed ahead with his execution.|$|E

2500|$|The {{earliest}} known {{mention of}} an Arundel team is a match in 1702 {{when a team}} formed by Charles Lennox, 1st Duke of Richmond played against them at an unknown venue.

2500|$|Thus, in 1597, {{civil war}} erupted, and Duke Charles {{was able to}} assume control over {{a large share of}} the {{powerful}} castles in the country, and in this manner achieved control over almost all the realm. The problem was Finland, where Klaus Fleming's widow guarded Åbo castle. But after psychological warfare, Charles and his followers managed to take the castle in Turku (...) [...] It is said that when the Duke entered the castle chapel he saw Klaus Fleming's body lying in a coffin. He is said to have said: [...] "Hadst thou now been alive, thy head would not have been in great safety." [...] Then Fleming's widow Ebba Stenbock is said to have approached the Duke and responded: [...] "If my late husband had been alive, <b>Your</b> <b>Grace</b> would never have entered herein." ...|$|E
2500|$|By 1846 Bourget {{found that}} many of his plans for {{expansion}} and renovation of the Roman Catholic Church in Canada were being frustrated by Archbishop Signay, who disliked Bourget and was distrustful of Bourget's changes. [...] On September 25, 1846, Bourget wrote to Signay and said, “For a long time I have been thinking that <b>Your</b> <b>Grace</b> should give up the administration of your archdiocese, contenting yourself with retaining the title of metropolitan. I shall use the occasion of my journey to Rome to put before the Holy See the reasons leading me to believe that it might be time for you to relieve yourself of this burden." [...] With this in mind, Bourget travelled to Rome in late 1846 to petition the Pope for Signay's resignation. [...] He was supported in this cause by Charles-Félix Cazeau, secretary to Archbishop Signay.|$|E
2500|$|The play depicts {{what happens}} when [...] "a nation turns on itself in epic savagery, {{dissolving}} its own social foundations." [...] Significantly in this sense, the play has no antagonist, and {{both sides in the}} conflict are depicted as capable of atrocities in their pursuit of victory. For example, the opening moments of the play see Richard introduced carrying the head of the Duke of Somerset, who he killed at the end of 2 Henry VI. The degradation of chivalric customs and human decency is emphasised when York responds to Richard's arrival by 'talking' to the head itself; [...] "But is <b>your</b> <b>grace</b> dead, my lord of Somerset" [...] (1.1.18). Michael Hattaway sees this scene as an important prologue to the play insofar as [...] "the act of desecration signifies the extinguishing of the residual chivalric code of conspicuous virtue, the eclipsing of honour by main force." ...|$|E
