Suffering writer’s block {{while working on}} A Passage to India, the novelist was Young’s guest at the Lacket in early May 1922. Shortly afterwards he wrote to Young declaring, “an unfinished novel’s before me now, and sometimes I work at it with distaste and despair…You certainly have done more than any individual I know to help me by direct remarks. <b>Your</b> <b>knowledge</b> {{of the business of}} creating seemed to me profounder than that possessed by so-called artists.” These comments suggest that Young gave Forster significant advice and encouragement at a crucial stage on work on the latter’s eventual masterpiece.|$|E

The title had been Hergé's own choice, having rejected Casterman's suggestion of Tintin and the Nuclear Rocket. For publication in book form, the story was re-coloured, with various changes being made; for instance, in the serialised version, the uniforms worn by staff were green, and they are changed to blue for the book volume. A number of scenes were also deleted. Hergé sent a copy to Ananoff, with a message stating that [...] "Your help, <b>your</b> <b>knowledge,</b> has been invaluable, enabling me to get my little characters to the Moon... and {{to bring them back}} safe and sound." [...] An English-language translation of the book was published in 1959.|$|E

As {{evidence}} of consumer confusion, Universal presented {{the results of}} a telephone survey of 150 managers and owners of arcades, bowling alleys, and pizza restaurants who owned or leased Donkey Kong machines. To the question [...] "To the best of <b>your</b> <b>knowledge,</b> was the Donkey Kong game made with the approval or under the authority of the people who produce the King Kong movies?", 18% of those surveyed answered in the affirmative. However, to the question [...] "As far as you know, who makes Donkey Kong?", no one named Universal. Universal argued that this was enough evidence to show that consumers were confused about the distinction between the two names.|$|E
500|$|In 1908 Beecham and the New Symphony Orchestra parted company, disagreeing about artistic control and, in particular, {{the deputy}} system. Under this system, orchestral players, if offered a better-paid {{engagement}} elsewhere, could send a substitute to a rehearsal or a concert. [...] The {{treasurer of the}} Royal Philharmonic Society described it thus: [...] "A, whom you want, signs to play at your concert. He sends B (whom you don't mind) to the first rehearsal. B, without <b>your</b> <b>knowledge</b> or consent, sends C to the second rehearsal. Not being able {{to play at the}} concert, C sends D, whom you would have paid five shillings to stay away." [...] Henry Wood had already banned the deputy system in the Queen's Hall Orchestra (provoking rebel players to found the London Symphony Orchestra), and Beecham followed suit. [...] The New Symphony Orchestra survived without him and subsequently became the Royal Albert Hall Orchestra.|$|E
500|$|Creating the {{orchestra}} admired by Strauss {{had not been}} achieved without a struggle. In 1904, Wood and Newman tackled the deputy system, in which orchestral players, if offered a better-paid engagement, could send a substitute to a rehearsal or a concert. The treasurer of the Royal Philharmonic Society described it thus: [...] "A, whom you want, signs to play at your concert. He sends B (whom you don't mind) to the first rehearsal. B, without <b>your</b> <b>knowledge</b> or consent, sends C to the second rehearsal. Not being able {{to play at the}} concert, C sends D, whom you would have paid five shillings to stay away." [...] After a rehearsal in which Wood was faced with a sea of entirely unfamiliar faces in his own orchestra, Newman came on the platform to announce: [...] "Gentlemen, in future there will be no deputies; good morning." [...] Forty players resigned en bloc and formed their own orchestra: the London Symphony Orchestra. Wood bore no grudge and attended their first concert, although it was 12 years before he agreed to conduct {{the orchestra}}.|$|E

500|$|At {{the turn}} of the twentieth century there were no {{permanent}} salaried orchestras in London. The main orchestras were those of Covent Garden, the Philharmonic Society and the Queen's Hall; their proprietors engaged players individually for each concert or for a season. As there were competing demands for the services of the finest players it was an accepted practice that, even though under contract to play for a concert, a player was at liberty to accept a better-paid engagement if it were offered. He would then engage another player to deputise at him for the original concert and the rehearsals for it. The treasurer of the Philharmonic Society described the system thus: [...] "A, whom you want, signs to play at your concert. He sends B (whom you don't mind) to the first rehearsal. B, without <b>your</b> <b>knowledge</b> or consent, sends C to the second rehearsal. Not being able to play at the concert, C sends D, whom you would have paid five shillings to stay away." [...] There was much competition for good orchestral players, with well-paid engagements offered by more than fifty music halls, by pit bands in West End musical comedies, and by grand hotels and restaurants which maintained orchestras.|$|E
500|$|The {{standard}} of orchestral playing in London was {{adversely affected by}} the deputy system, in which orchestral players, if offered a better-paid engagement, could send a substitute to a rehearsal or a concert. The treasurer of the Royal Philharmonic Society described it thus: [...] "A, whom you want, signs to play at your concert. He sends B (whom you don't mind) to the first rehearsal. B, without <b>your</b> <b>knowledge</b> or consent, sends C to the second rehearsal. Not being able {{to play at the}} concert, C sends D, whom you would have paid five shillings to stay away". The members of the Queen's Hall Orchestra were not highly paid; Wood recalled in his memoirs, [...] "the rank and file of the orchestra received only 45s a week for six Promenade concerts and three rehearsals, a guinea for one Symphony concert and rehearsal, and half-a-guinea for Sunday afternoon or evening concerts without rehearsal". Offered ad hoc engagements at better pay by other managements, many of the players took full advantage of the deputy system. Newman determined {{to put an end to}} it. After a rehearsal in which Wood was faced with a sea of entirely unfamiliar faces in his own orchestra, Newman came on the platform to announce: [...] "Gentlemen, in future there will be no deputies; good morning". Forty players resigned en bloc and formed their own orchestra, the London Symphony Orchestra. Newman did not attempt to bar the new orchestra from the Queen's Hall, and its first concert was given there on 9 June 1904, conducted by Richter.|$|E

2500|$|Other {{researchers}} believe the hippocampus is only involved in episodic memory and spatial cognition. This then {{raises the question}} where semantic memory may be located. Some believe semantic memory lives in temporal neocortex. Others believe that semantic knowledge is widely distributed across all brain areas. To illustrate this latter view, consider <b>your</b> <b>knowledge</b> of dogs. Researchers holding the 'distributed semantic knowledge' view believe that <b>your</b> <b>knowledge</b> of the sound a dog makes exists in your auditory cortex, whilst your ability to recognize and imagine the visual features of a dog resides in your visual cortex.

2500|$|Other gifts {{were also}} given to his neighbours. Among these was one to Chartres, of which its bishop wrote: [...] "When {{we saw the}} gift that you sent us, we were amazed at <b>your</b> <b>knowledge</b> {{as well as your}} faith… since you, whom we had heard to be a pagan prince, we now know to be not only a Christian, but also a most generous donor to God's churches and servants". He is known to have sent a psalter and sacramentary made in Peterborough (famous for its illustrations) to Cologne, and a book written in gold, among other gifts, to William the Great of Aquitaine. This golden book was {{apparently}} to support Aquitanian claims of St Martial, patron saint of Aquitaine, as an apostle. Of some consequence, its recipient was an avid artisan, scholar and devout Christian, and the Abbey of Saint-Martial was a great library and scriptorium, second only to the one at Cluny. It is likely that Cnut's gifts were well beyond anything we can now know.|$|E

The old man chided him, [...] "How can you be late for a meeting with an elderly man? Come back again five days later!" [...] Zhang Liang tried his best to be punctual the second time but the old man still arrived earlier than him, and he was scorned by the old man once more and told to return again five days later. The third time, Zhang Liang went to the bridge at midnight and waited until the old man appeared. This time, the old man was impressed with Zhang Liang's fortitude and humility, that he presented Zhang with a book, saying, [...] "You can become the tutor of a ruler after reading this book.

2500|$|Just as Tyler is {{difficult}} to categorize as a novelist, it is also challenging to label her style. Novelist Cathleen Schine describes how her “style without a style” manages to pull the reader into the story: “So rigorous and artful is the style without a style, so measured and delicate is each observation, so complex is the structure and so astute and open the language, that the reader can relax, feel secure in the narrative and experience the work as something real and natural -- even inevitable.” [...] The San Francisco Chronicle made a similar point: “One does not so much read a Tyler novel as visit it. Her ability to conduct several conversations at once while getting the food to the table turns the act of reading {{into a kind of}} transport.” [...] Reviewer Tom Shone put it this way: “You’re involved before you ever notice you were paying attention.” Joyce Carol Oates, in her review of The Amateur Marriage, perhaps described the phenomenon best: “When the realistic novel works its magic, you won’t simply have read about the experiences of ﬁctitious characters, you will have seemed to have lived them; <b>your</b> <b>knowledge</b> of their lives transcends their own, for they can only live in chronological time. The experience of reading such ﬁction when it’s carefully composed can be breathtaking, like being given the magical power of reliving passages of our own lives, indecipherable at the time of being lived.” ...|$|E
2500|$|On May 6, 2015, the NFL {{published}} a 243-page report regarding the deflation of footballs {{used in the}} previous season's AFC Championship Game. The report concluded that, more likely than not, Brady was at least generally aware of the intentional deflation. On May 11, Brady was suspended for four games by the NFL for his involvement based on [...] "substantial and credible evidence" [...] that Brady knew Patriots employees were deflating footballs and that he failed {{to cooperate with the}} investigators. On May 11, Troy Vincent—NFL Executive Vice President of Football Operations—penned a letter to Brady that stated in part: [...] "Your actions as set forth in the report clearly constitute conduct detrimental to the integrity of and public confidence in the game of professional football." [...] Vincent's letter further stated: [...] "With respect to your particular involvement, the report established that there is substantial and credible evidence to conclude you were at least generally aware of the actions of the Patriots' employees involved in the deflation of the footballs and that it was unlikely that their actions were done without <b>your</b> <b>knowledge.</b> Moreover, the report documents your failure to cooperate fully and candidly with the investigation, including by refusing to produce any relevant electronic evidence (emails, texts, etc.), despite being offered extraordinary safeguards by the investigators to protect unrelated personal information, and by providing testimony that the report concludes was not plausible and contradicted by other evidence." [...] Brady, through the NFL Players Association, officially appealed the suspension on May 14.|$|E
