25|$|Irish Terriers {{are good}} with people. They have a highly {{developed}} sense of loyalty {{and it is}} important that they have a strong responsible leader, for whom they have natural respect. Most Irish Terriers love children and tolerate rough-housing to a certain extent. Irish terriers need exercise; do not get one if you are not prepared to walk it. They enjoy training, new tasks are easily mastered with food and toys working equally well as motivation. Irish terriers have less of an eagerness to please people than some other breeds but have mental ability and enjoy puzzle solving. They respond best to consistent, reward based training from a relaxed, authoritative person. As with all dog breeds, violence should never be used – instead use distraction and reward the behaviour <b>you</b> <b>want.</b> <b>It</b> is always best to outwit and lure. When seeking a trainer, one should look for a person who has experience with terriers.|$|E

Out of our four records, I thought this might be the one where you're driving down the road listening to it on a sunny summer day." [...] Rawlings again produced the record. The album also reflected a change in the typically sparse instrumentation: Welch and Rawlings introduced a dobro, violin, electric bass and drums, and Welch later said, [...] "Everything's not supposed to sound the same, <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> to reflect change and growth." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Charles to make a funny [...] "dark-themed" [...] episode, using {{elements}} that were unusual in sitcoms. Sets for the episode were built, and Bobbi Jo Lathan was cast as flight attendant Lucy Merrit and Ernie Sabella was cast as gun salesman Mo Korn, who was described in the script as [...] "overweight, greasy, slow and low-key". The table reading of the episode was held on December 12, 1990. Louis-Dreyfus stated, [...] "I read the script and I remember thinking 'we're {{not going to do}} this'." [...] According to Alexander, when she read a scene in which she holds the gun to her head stating [...] "where do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> Jerry? The Kennedy? [...] The McKinley?" [...] (referencing the assassination of the two American presidents), Louis-Dreyfus turned to Alexander, stating [...] "I'm not doing this." [...] Both Alexander and Cherones, who would direct the episode, felt that the gun content in the story was too provocative.

500|$|In a {{positive}} review for Rolling Stone, Greil Marcus wrote in 1969 that Morrison's lyrics were thoughtful and deeply intellectual, [...] "in {{terms of the}} myths and metaphors that exist within the world of rock and roll". He believed both the music and lyrics captured the spirit of Bob Dylan's 1967 album John Wesley Harding, while calling Astral Weeks a [...] "unique and timeless" [...] record. Rolling Stone later named it the album of the year. Melody Maker also called {{it one of the}} year's best records, featuring Morrison's [...] "small harsh voice" [...] backed by an attractive musical combo that [...] "verges on genius" [...] during [...] "Madame George".

500|$|Most {{or all of}} {{the episode}} was shot from September 11 to 23, 2007 and filming {{overlapped}} with the following episode. [...] The Tunisian desert scene was filmed on location in Oahu, Hawaii, {{like the rest of the}} episode, at a stone quarry with industrial fans blowing fake sand. [...] A typical Lost episode contains fifty visual effects shots. [...] Among scenes created entirely or partially with effects are the opening scene of [...] "Confirmed Dead", which shows what appears to be the wreckage of 815 underwater and the scene from Daniel's perspective as he parachutes from the helicopter to the ground. [...] In Frank's flashback, he drops a toy plane, which spirals into a small aquarium. [...] This shot was not intended to use effects; however, [...] "it's impossible to get a toy plane to spiral the way <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> to", according to supervisor Mitch Suskin. [...] A tank with still water and rocks on the bottom was filmed and the plane was added in editing. [...] Suskin said that creating effects for [...] "Confirmed Dead" [...] "was slightly too leisurely" [...] because the episode aired over four months after post-production began.|$|E
