So if <b>you</b> <b>paint</b> it badly or put it in the sort of wrong perspective, you draw more attention to what's wrong with the image rather than looking at the image.|$|E

2500|$|Slug raps {{in a very}} introspective style, as seen on {{the song}} [...] "Little Man," [...] in which he confronts the {{complaints}} that people have about him by looking at {{his relationship with his}} father and son. [...] This introspective style became less prevalent with When Life Gives You Lemons, <b>You</b> <b>Paint</b> That Shit Gold (2008) in which Slug navigates through other peoples' lives. [...] When Life Gives You Lemons, <b>You</b> <b>Paint</b> That Shit Gold has been noted as more of a dark album than previous works. Slug maintains the allegorical stance from previous records in songs such as [...] "Your Glass House" [...] which deals with his emotions towards the war in Iraq under the guise of a person waking up from a hangover.|$|E
