500|$|Rhimes {{entitled}} the episode [...] "Losing My Religion" [...] {{because she felt}} [...] "that {{is what happens to}} each intern in this episode. Each intern lets go of the things they've held onto all season. George lets go of loving Meredith. Cristina lets go of her well-checked emotions. Izzie is forced to let go of her idealism. And that leads to her letting go of medicine. Alex lets go of his rage against Izzie. And Meredith... well, Meredith just lets go." [...] The costumes were designed by Mimi Melgaard; Rhimes noted that everyone was dressed in dark funeral colors to the prom, except Stevens who was dressed in pink. Stevens' dress was an Amsale creation. Monologues done by the five main characters were used in this episode. Rhimes commented: [...] "this was something we'd never done and I wasn't sure would work. But <b>you</b> <b>place</b> those pages {{into the hands of the}} actors and each and every one of them layered their characters' souls right into the dialogue." [...] The episode's theme was the prom; Rhimes said she wanted to do it since the beginning of the season.|$|E

2500|$|With {{the release}} of Soulblighter, Bungie {{included}} two programming tools called [...] "Fear" [...] and [...] "Loathing", which allowed players to create new units and maps. Both The Fallen Lords and Soulblighter had been created using four tools developed by Bungie themselves; [...] "Tag Editor" [...] edited the constants stored in the cross-platform data files; [...] "Extractor" [...] handled the 2D sprites and the sequencing of their animations; [...] "Loathing" [...] acted as the map editor; and [...] "Fear" [...] dealt with the 3D polygonal models such as houses, pillars, and walls. Speaking of Fear and Loathing, The Fallen Lordss producer and programmer Jason Jones explains, [...] "Loathing is basically the map editor for Myth. You import your map into it, you change the heights, and <b>you</b> <b>place</b> your units on the map in Loathing. Fear takes {{care of all the}} models; it is used to import the 3D rendered models into Myth." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to The Oxford Dictionary of Islam, shaytan in the {{singular}} and the plural shayateen {{are used in}} the Quran often interchangeably with Iblis, who is [...] "considered to be a particular shaytan." [...] In Islamic theology, Iblis is a being created from fire who was allowed to mingle with Angels in the heavens until he rejected the command of God to bow before Adam. When God created Adam, the first human, He said to the angels: [...] "And , when your Lord said to the angels, [...] "Indeed, I will make upon the earth a successive authority." [...] They said, [...] "Will <b>You</b> <b>place</b> upon it one who causes corruption therein and sheds blood, while we declare Your praise and sanctify You?" [...] Allah said, [...] "Indeed, I know that which you do not know." [...] All the angels prostrate, but Iblis does not. Iblis justified his decision, because he claims to be better than a human: [...] " [...] said, [...] "What prevented you from prostrating when I commanded you? [...] said, [...] "I am better than him. You created me from fire, and created him from clay." [...] Iblis requests a reprieve until the day of resurrection to try to mislead the people in any way he can. God reprieves Iblis but, He also warns that Iblis would have no authority over His ibād or [...] "servants". [...] "As for My servants, no authority shalt thou have over them." ...|$|E
2500|$|The persuasive {{power of}} {{language}} is first alluded to by Charles, who tells Joan after she has assured him she can end {{the siege of}} Orléans, [...] "Thou hast astonished me with thy high terms" [...] (1.2.93). This sense is repeated when the Countess of Auvergne is wondering about Talbot and says to her servant, [...] "Great is the rumour of this dreadful knight,/And his achievements of no less account./Fain would mine eyes be witness with mine ears,/To give their censure of these rare reports" [...] (2.3.7–10). Like Charles, Auvergne has been astonished with the 'high terms' bestowed on Talbot, and now she wishes {{to see if the}} report and the reality conflate. Later in the play, the persuasive power of language becomes important for Joan, as she uses it as a subterfuge to sneak into Rouen, telling her men, [...] "Be wary how <b>you</b> <b>place</b> your words;/Talk like the vulgar sort of market men/That come to gather money for their corn" [...] (3.2.3.5). Later, she uses language to persuade Burgundy to join with the Dauphin against the English. As Burgundy realises he is succumbing to her rhetoric, he muses to himself, [...] "Either she hath bewitched me with her words,/Or nature makes me suddenly relent" [...] (3.3.58–59). Here, language is shown to be so powerful as to act on Burgundy the same way Nature itself would act, {{to the point where he}} is unsure if he has been persuaded by a natural occurrence or by Joan's words. Language is thus presented as capable of transforming ideology. As Joan finishes her speech, Burgundy again attests to the power of her language, [...] "I am vanquish'd. These haughty words of hers/Have battered me like roaring canon-shot,/And made me almost yield upon my knees" [...] (3.3.78–80). Later, something similar happens with Henry, who agrees to marry Margaret merely because of Suffolk's description of her. In a line that echoes Burgundy's, Henry queries what it is that has prompted him to agree to Suffolk's suggestion: [...] "Whether it be through force of your report,/My noble lord of Suffolk, or for that/My tender youth was never yet attaint/With any passion of inflaming love, I cannot tell" [...] (5.6.79–83). Here, again, the power of language is shown to be so strong as to be confused with a natural phenomenon.|$|E
