25|$|Achieving city {{status in}} 1484, Galway celebrated its quincentenary in 1984. Galway {{in itself is}} not {{particularly}} known for its attractions, but rather for its lively atmosphere and entertainment scene. This is partly because 25% {{of the population of}} Galway (75,529 in 2011) is made up of students primarily from NUI Galway and GMIT, two third level institutes in the city. Galway is particularly popular with American tourists as Galway {{is said to be the}} most 'Irish' of Ireland's cities, and is one of the few urban areas where <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> hear Irish spoken, due to the fact the Gaeltacht area of Connemara is only a few kilometres away. The biggest lake in the country, Lough Corrib, is situated north of the city. The ferry to the Aran Islands is located about 40 minutes away and departs from the village of Rossaveal regularly. The Aran Islands are located in Galway Bay, and the Irish Language is by far the most used language on the islands, with the vast majority using the language regularly. As the islands are quite a bit from the mainland, cars are quite rare and the main form of transport is the bicycle.|$|E
500|$|Ofcom {{estimates}} {{that even after}} extra spectrum has been allocated to DAB, around 90local radio stations {{will be unable to}} transmit on DAB, either because there is no space for them on a local DAB multiplex, or because they cannot afford the high transmission costs of DAB that the multiplex operators are charging. Ofcom announced in 2005 that it regarded Digital Radio Mondiale (DRM) as an option for local stations unable to secure carriage or unable to pay the high transmission costs of DAB. The success of the small scale DAB multiplexes may alleviate this issue to some degree. One of the drawbacks of DAB and DAB+ has not been addressed. In simple terms the frequency of a broadcast is the carrier frequency (i.e. a sine wave). In order to carry any information the carrier frequency must be modulated. The signal at the receiver (radio) is then demodulated and the information is retrieved. The demodulators for FM signals are almost instantaneous so that one can have radios in different areas and move between those areas to hear the broadcast continuously. In contrast the demodulators for digital signals take a finite time and each digital radio takes a different time to demodulate the broadcast signal, so that if you move between different radios that are spatially apart <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> hear the same part of the broadcast twice or miss parts of it depending on the time to demodulate the signal of the individual radios. The other drawback with DAB is that it is all or nothing. If there is any interference or loss due to moving out of the footprint of the broadcast signal you will receive no signal, whereas in the case of FM you can hear something even if it is crackly.|$|E
