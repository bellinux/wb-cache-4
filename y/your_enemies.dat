500|$|As a Christian minister, King's main {{influence}} was Jesus Christ and the Christian gospels, {{which he would}} almost always quote in his religious meetings, speeches at church, and in public discourses. King's faith was strongly based in Jesus' commandment of loving your neighbor as yourself, loving God above all, and loving <b>your</b> <b>enemies,</b> praying for them and blessing them. His nonviolent thought was also based in the injunction to turn the other cheek in the Sermon on the Mount, and Jesus' teaching of putting the sword back into its place (Matthew 26:52). In his famous Letter from Birmingham Jail, King urged action consistent with {{what he describes as}} Jesus' [...] "extremist" [...] love, and also quoted numerous other Christian pacifist authors, which was very usual for him.

500|$|Conan brought Schwarzenegger {{worldwide}} {{recognition as}} an action star and established {{the model for}} most of his film roles: [...] "icy, brawny, and inexpressiveyet somehow endearing." [...] The image of him as the barbarian was an enduring one; when he campaigned for George H. W. Bush to be president, he was introduced as [...] "Conan the Republican"a moniker that stuck with him throughout his political career and was often repeated by the media during his term as Governor of California. [...] Schwarzenegger was aware of the benefits the film had brought to him, acknowledging the role of Conan as [...] "God's gift to [...] career." [...] He embraced the image: when he was Governor of California, he displayed his copy of the Atlantean sword in his office, occasionally flourishing the weapon at visitors and letting them play with it. [...] More than once, he spiced up his speeches with Conan's [...] "crush <b>your</b> <b>enemies,</b> see them driven before you and hear the lamentations of their women".|$|E
500|$|On the {{afternoon}} of August 16, the weather cleared, and Stark ordered his men {{to be ready to}} attack. Stark is reputed to have rallied his troops by saying they were here to fight for their [...] "natural born rights as Englishmen" [...] and he added [...] "There are <b>your</b> <b>enemies,</b> the Red Coats and the Tories. They are ours, or this night Molly Stark sleeps a widow." [...] Upon hearing that the militia had melted away into the woods, Baum assumed that the Americans were retreating or redeploying. However, Stark had decided to capitalize on weaknesses in the German's widely distributed position, and had sent sizable flanking parties to either side of his lines. These movements were assisted by a ruse employed by Stark's men that enabled them to get closer safely without alarming the opposing forces. The Germans, most of whom spoke no English, had been told that soldiers with bits of white paper in their hat were Loyalists, and should not be fired on; Stark's men had also heard this and many of them had suitably adorned their hats.|$|E

500|$|The [...] 2014 {{annexation}} of Crimea {{was described in}} the West as maskirovka. As the BBC writer, Lucy Ash put it: [...] "Five weeks later, once the annexation had been rubber-stamped by the Parliament in Moscow, Putin admitted Russian troops had been deployed in Crimea after all. But the lie had served its purpose. Maskirovka is used to wrong-foot <b>your</b> <b>enemies,</b> to keep them guessing." [...] The area was quietly occupied by so-called little green men, armed men in military trucks who came at night, with no insignia, so that even pro-Russian activists did not understand what was happening. They were later revealed as Russian special forces, {{but at the time}} Vladimir Putin denied this. Time magazine reported in April 2014 that the troops in eastern Ukraine described themselves as Cossacks, whereas analysts in Ukraine and the West considered {{at least some of them}} to be Russian special forces. Their obscure origins made them seem more menacing and harder to deal with. The article observed that the wearing of face masks (actually, balaclavas) was typical of the Russian tradition of military deception, making asking why they were worn, as one masked separatist remarked, [...] "a stupid question". In April 2014, the Huffington Post asserted that [...] "President Putin's game plan in Ukraine becomes clearer day by day despite Russia's excellent, even brilliant, use of its traditional maskirovka".|$|E
500|$|Following {{the retreat}} of the Confederate army, the Banu Qurayza {{neighbourhood}}s were besieged by the Muslims, in revenge. After a 25-day siege of their neighbourhood the Banu Qurayza unconditionally surrendered. When the Banu Qurayza tribe surrendered, the Muslim army seized their stronghold and their possessions. On {{the request of}} the Banu Aus, who were allied to the Qurayza, Muhammad chose one of them, Sa'ad ibn Mu'adh, as an arbitrator to pronounce judgment upon them. Sa'ad, who would later die of his wounds from the battle, decreed the sentence according to the Torah, in which the men shall be killed and women and children enslaved. [...] says: [...] When you march up to attack a city, make its people an offer of peace. If they accept and open their gates, all the people in it shall be subject to forced labor and shall work for you. If they refuse to make peace and they engage you in battle, lay siege to that city. When the Lord your God delivers it into your hand, put to the sword all the men in it. As for the women, the children, the livestock and everything else in the city, you may take these as plunder for yourselves. And you may use the plunder the Lord your God gives you from <b>your</b> <b>enemies.</b> [...] Muhammad approved of this decision, and the next day the sentence was carried out.|$|E
500|$|The Ionians did however hold {{meetings}} {{to discuss the}} conduct of the battle. Dionysius, the Phocaean general, offered to train and lead the Greek force: [...] "Our affairs, men of Ionia, stand {{on the edge of a}} razor, whether to be free men or slaves, and runaway slaves at that. If you now consent to endure hardships, you will have toil for the present time, but it will be in your power to overcome <b>your</b> <b>enemies</b> and gain freedom; but if you will be weak and disorderly, I see nothing that can save you from paying the penalty to the king for your rebellion. Believe me and entrust yourselves to me; I promise you that (if the gods deal fairly with us) either our enemies shall not meet us in battle, or if they do they shall be utterly vanquished." [...] Dionysius thus began an intensive training program, leading the fleet out every day to train the rowers in ramming manoeuvers, and the marines in combat. For seven days the Ionians accepted this regime, but being unused to the hard work, they refused to obey thereafter, and stayed in camp instead. According to Herodotus, upon seeing the resultant discontent and division in the Ionian camp, the Samians decided to accept the Persian offer of lenience in return for desertion. However, some modern historians reject the notion of dissent in the Greek camp. Herodotus derived his account of Lade from the Samians themselves, and it is suggested that, seeking to excuse their treachery, they came up with this story. At any rate, the Samians remained with the other Greeks in the run up to the battle.|$|E
