5|$|The Drug in Me Is You is {{the debut}} studio album by American rock band Falling in Reverse. Production for the album took place {{following}} lead singer Ronnie Radke's departure from Escape the Fate in 2008. Recording {{took place in}} December 2010 and lasted until February 2011 at Paint it Black Studios in Orlando, Florida. Michael Baskette, who worked with Radke on Escape the Fate's Dying is Your Latest Fashion, returned as the executive producer for the album, alongside former bandmate Omar Espinosa and others as additional composers and production aids in the studio. The Drug in Me Is <b>You</b> <b>was</b> released on July 25, 2011, in Europe and Japan, and on July 26, 2011, in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The Drug in Me Is <b>You</b> <b>was</b> speculated by news source Perez Hilton to sell {{anywhere}} from 17,000 to 20,000 copies in the United States {{during its first}} week of sales, placing it close behind predicted debuting chart toppers Eric Church (Chief), Kelly Rowland (Here I Am), and Joss Stone (LP1). The album ended up selling 18,120 copies in its first week in the United States, charting at number 19 on the Billboard 200. This almost exactly matched the first week sales of Escape the Fate (2010), the third album by Radke's former band, though Escape the Fate only charted at number 25, six spots lower than The Drug in Me Is You, despite equal sales. In its second week on sales, The Drug in Me is You dropped about 70% in the United States, selling 5,870 copies. This dropped the album 60 spots to number 79 on the Billboard 200, and brought total US sales for the album to around 24,000 copies.|$|E
5|$|The album charted {{at number}} 19 on the US Billboard 200, selling 18,000 copies {{in its first}} week in the United States. It also charted inter{{national}}ly on the national album charts in Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom. Upon release, The Drug in Me Is You received mixed reviews. Critics consistently noted the contrast between hardcore music and pop music on the tracks, but to mixed reception. Overall, the lyrics were viewed as being cliché while Radke's singing and return to making music were noted. In addition, critics focused on the bitter relationship between Radke and his former band, Escape the Fate, in which reviewers noticed the choice to attack the band {{in many of the}} album's tracks. The Drug in Me Is <b>You</b> <b>was</b> chosen by the Guitar World magazine as the album number 21 among the top 50 albums of 2011.|$|E

5|$|The band's next album, For Those About to Rock We Salute <b>You,</b> <b>was</b> {{their first}} album to reach {{number one in}} the United States. Drummer Phil Rudd was fired in 1983 and {{replaced}} by ex-A II Z drummer Simon Wright, who left to join Dio in 1989. The band experienced a resurgence in the early 1990s with the release of The Razors Edge. Phil Rudd returned in 1994 after Chris Slade, who was with the band from 1989 to 1994, was asked to leave in favour of him, and contributed to the band's 1995 album Ballbreaker. Stiff Upper Lip, released in 2000, was well received by critics. The band's studio album, Black Ice, released in 2008, was the second highest-selling album of that year, and their biggest chart hit since For Those About to Rock, eventually reaching No.1 on all charts worldwide. The band's line-up remained the same until 2014 with Malcolm Young's retirement due to early-onset dementia and Rudd's legal troubles. In 2016, Johnson was advised to stop touring on account of worsening hearing loss, and Guns N' Roses frontman Axl Rose stepped in as the band's vocalist for the remainder of that year's dates. Long-term bass player Cliff Williams retired from the band {{at the end of their}} 2016 Rock Or Bust world tour.|$|E
