5|$|Begin Again premiered on September 7, 2013 at the Toronto International Film Festival, where The Weinstein Company {{acquired}} the U.S. distribution {{rights to the}} film for $7 million. It was later screened on April 26, 2014 on the closing night of the Tribeca Film Festival. The film's title was changed from Can a Song Save <b>Your</b> <b>Life?</b> <b>to</b> Begin Again between its festival premiere and its theatrical release because viewers {{found it difficult to}} remember and it was often misquoted.|$|E
5|$|Audie Murphy (20 June 1925 – 28 May 1971) was {{a highly}} {{decorated}} American soldier and Medal of Honor recipient who turned actor. He portrayed himself in the film To Hell and Back, the account of his World War II experiences. During the 1950s and 1960s he was cast primarily in westerns. While often the hero, he proved his ability to portray a cold-blooded hired gun in No Name on the Bullet. A notable exception to the westerns was The Quiet American in which he co-starred with Michael Redgrave. Murphy made over 40 feature films and often worked with directors more than once. Jesse Hibbs who directed To Hell and Back worked with the star on six films, only half of which were westerns. When promoting his 1949 book To Hell and Back he appeared on the radio version of This Is <b>Your</b> <b>Life.</b> <b>To</b> promote the 1955 film of the same name, he appeared on Ed Sullivan's Toast of the Town. He was a celebrity guest on television shows such as What's My Line? and appeared {{in a handful of}} television dramas. Murphy's only television series Whispering Smith had a brief run in 1961. For his cooperation in appearing in the United States Army's Broken Bridge episode of The Big Picture television series he was awarded the Outstanding Civilian Service Medal.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, he hosted Current Puns, an {{exploration}} of wordplay, and Radio 4: This Is <b>Your</b> <b>Life,</b> <b>to</b> celebrate the radio station's 40th anniversary. He also interviewed the Prime Minister Tony Blair {{as part of a}} series of podcasts released by 10 Downing Street. In February 2008, Fry began presenting podcasts entitled Stephen Fry's Podgrams, in which he recounts his life and recent experiences. In July 2008, he appeared as himself in I Love Stephen Fry, an Afternoon Play for Radio 4 written by former Fry and Laurie script editor Jon Canter.|$|E

25|$|Following his wife's death, {{he began}} discerning a {{vocation}} {{to join a}} monastery, perhaps in France. One day, while discussing his vocation with the sister of Thomas Hussey, the Bishop of Waterford, a band of ragged boys passed by. She pointed to them, and cried:"What! Would you bury yourself in a cell on the continent rather than devote your wealth and <b>your</b> <b>life</b> <b>to</b> the spiritual and material interest of these poor youths?"After settling his business affairs in 1802, Rice {{devoted his life to}} prayer and charitable work, particularly with the poor and marginalised of Waterford. In 1802, when he established a makeshift school in a converted stable in New Street, Waterford, he found the children were so difficult to manage that the teachers resigned. This prompted him to sell his thriving business to another prominent Roman Catholic merchant, a Mr. Quan, and devote himself to training teachers who would dedicate their lives to prayers and to teaching the children free of charge. Despite the difficulties involved, Edmund's classes were so popular that another temporary school had to be set up on another of his properties, this time in nearby Stephen Street.|$|E

500|$|In {{his late}} teens and early twenties, Murphy worked towards {{a career as}} a rock musician, playing guitar in several bands {{alongside}} his brother Páidi. The Beatles-obsessed pair named their most successful band [...] "The Sons of Mr. Greengenes", after a 1969 song by another idol, Frank Zappa. Murphy sang and played guitar in the band, which he has said [...] "specialised in wacky lyrics and endless guitar solos". In 1996, The Sons of Mr. Greengenes were offered a five-album record deal by Acid Jazz Records, but they did not sign the contract due to Murphy's brother still being in secondary school and the little money involved in ceding the rights to Murphy's compositions to the record label. Murphy confessed that [...] "I'm very glad in retrospect that we didn't sign because you kind of sign away <b>your</b> <b>life</b> <b>to</b> a label and the whole of your music".|$|E

500|$|... "Pyramids" [...] was {{received}} with universal acclaim from music critics. Complex Magazine named it track [...] "song of the week" [...] upon release. Complex later named the song the fourth best song of 2012. Siân Rowe of NME compared the track to Prince’s [...] "Purple Rain" [...] {{and reported that}} the song [...] "is the kind of track you’ll lose hours and hours of <b>your</b> <b>life</b> <b>to.</b> This week alone, NME has spent at least two days having our minds freaked on by its space funk swirl." [...] Pitchforks Evan Minsker labeled it a [...] "Best New Track" [...] and wrote that [...] "the song's a 10-minute R event, traveling from club banger ancient Egypt ('send the cheetahs to the tomb') to the slow jam strip club('she's workin' at the Pyramid tonight'). It's a journey well-suited to Ocean's smooth croon." [...] The publication's Ryan Dombal commented, [...] "essentially reincarnates {{one of the most}} storied female rulers in history as a six-inch-heeled woman of the night. However, the song doesn't read as an indictment of the last 2,000 years as much as yet another attempt to cleverly level the playing field." [...] The Telegraphs Neil McCormick stated that the track was the [...] "real miracle of the album", noting that while Ocean [...] "can embark on something as flamboyant as Pyramids - a 10-minute, tempo-shifting, minor-chord narrative of Egyptian queens and Las Vegas strippers, marrying Tangerine Dream sequencers and a jazzy John Mayer guitar solo to a rapturous slow jam – and make it all seem to make sense." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{length of}} The Velvet Rope drew {{criticism}} from certain music critics. In a less enthusiastic mixed review, AllMusic observed a [...] "hardened, sexually experimental Janet"; however, its writer claimed that [...] "the best moments {{sink into the}} murk", and that [...] "there are good moments on The Velvet Rope, but at its running time [...] it's hard to work up the patience to find them". In a retrospective review, BBC Music stated that [...] "t's far too long. It does feel like you've given over a considerable chunk of <b>your</b> <b>life</b> <b>to</b> it by its end, an unfortunate by-product of the CD era with its overriding desire to fill up every last second of each disc". However, a positive review of the record was given on the whole, with its author calling it [...] "ature and experimental... Possibly the great lost 90s trip hop album".|$|E
2500|$|Marinovich entered USC as a Fine Arts {{major and}} redshirted the 1988 season behind Rodney Peete. Already under intense {{pressure}} {{as a high school}} prospect, the combination of high expectation and the many new temptations that were prohibited under his strict upbringing soon overwhelmed him. He was torn between embracing the freedom and following his father's teachings, noting that [...] "I'm finally away from my dad telling me everything to do. And I've got to say I have taken advantage of it. Full advantage. He keeps telling me, 'Come on, you've got the rest of <b>your</b> <b>life</b> <b>to</b> fool around. Not now.' I know he's right. But {{there are a lot of}} distractions at SC." [...] At one point Marinovich left school in his freshman year to see his mother, stating [...] "I wish I could go somewhere else and be someone else. I don't want to be Todd Marinovich." ...|$|E
