5|$|I {{longed for}} real companionship, for {{apart from that}} life had nothing to offer me in Darmstadt...So {{naturally}} I am bitterly disappointed with myself when I look back, and see {{that in spite of}} great ambitions, good intentions, and real effort, my hopes have nevertheless been completely ship-wrecked...You say, darling, that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> have caused me hardship intentionally...I only regret the lack of any intention or desire – or rather insight – to be more to me, and that does not mean spending all your time with me, without wishing to share anything with me at the same time. But I am wrong to talk of these things. Your letters are so dear and kind – but so empty and bare – I feel myself through them that I have less to say to you than any other person. Rain – fine weather – things that have happened – that is all I ever have to tell you about – so utterly cut off is my real self, my innermost life, from yours...I have tried again and again {{to talk to you about}} more serious things, when I felt the need to do so – but we never meet each other – we have developed separately...and that is why I feel true companionship is an impossibility for us – because our thoughts will never meet...I love you too so very much, my darling husband, and that is why it is so sad to feel that our life is nevertheless so incomplete...But you are never intentionally to blame for this – I never think that, never...|$|E
500|$|Production Designer Allan Cameron found a {{dormant volcano}} near Erfoud where the entire set for Hamunaptra could be constructed. Sommers liked the {{location}} because, [...] "A city {{hidden in the}} crater of an extinct volcano made perfect sense. Out {{in the middle of}} the desert <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> see it. <b>You</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> think of entering the crater unless you knew what was inside that volcano." [...] A survey of the volcano was conducted so that an accurate model and scale models of the columns and statues could be replicated back at Shepperton Studios, where all of the scenes involving the underground passageways of the City of the Dead were shot. These sets took 16 weeks to build, and included fiberglass columns rigged with special effects for the movie's final scenes. Another large set was constructed in the United Kingdom on the dockyard at Chatham which doubled for the Giza Port on the River Nile. This set was [...] in length and featured [...] "a steam train, an Ajax traction engine, three cranes, an open two-horse carriage, four horse-drawn carts, five dressing horses and grooms, nine pack donkeys and mules, as well as market stalls, Arab-clad vendors and room for 300 costumed extras".|$|E
500|$|Contradicting his {{personality}} {{with that of}} his role in The Hangover Trilogy, director Todd Phillips describes him as [...] "ridiculously different in real life. He is very vulnerable — insecure {{is not the right}} word... And there's a warmth to him <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> know." [...] A writer for International Business Times adds that Cooper, despite being in his 40s, has a [...] "boyish charm and laid-back personality." [...] Cooper believes that {{his personality}} relates to acting: [...] "I enjoy people, that makes this profession a lot easier, and I can sleep anywhere. That's a skill." [...] He cites actor Daniel Day-Lewis, who he thinks is [...] "the world's greatest actor", as an influence.|$|E

6000|$|... "Ah," [...] said Susan, [...] "if <b>you</b> only <b>would</b> <b>never</b> be {{cross to}} the boys, Bessie, and not {{keep out of}} what they care for, they <b>would</b> <b>never</b> think it." ...|$|R
500|$|Computer-generated imagery {{was used}} in much of [...] "Days Gone Bye", {{particularly}} when Rick encounters a legless walker. [...] "The woman was wearing basically blue stockings and then everything was cleaned out. There is an alarming amount of CGI in the pilot episode and in the whole show, and <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> know it," [...] articulated Robert Kirkman. Kirkman felt that Stargate Studios, which was chosen by producers to edit the pilot episode, did a splendid job. He stated: [...] "There's a shot where Rick is riding off on the horse and his hat actually blew off, and they really liked that shot, and so they had Stargate go in and digitally put the hat back on his head." ...|$|E
500|$|The House Committee on National Security {{hearing on}} 3 August was {{presided over by}} Congressman Bob Dornan and lasted one day. At the hearing, Pilkington and Andrus {{explained}} how the USAF accident investigation was conducted and emphasized that Wickson and May violated the OPC rules of engagement by conducting a VID pass of the Black Hawks that was inadequate to determine the helicopter's national origin. Andrus stated, [...] "Sir, as a pilot, I would have made another pass. <b>You</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> fire until {{you know what you}} are shooting at." [...] Retired USAF colonel and pilot Jerry Cox expressed concern to the Committee with the F-15 pilots for not taking responsibility for their actions.|$|E
500|$|Hann {{says that}} when writers deal with [...] "upmarket" [...] readership, they [...] "need {{to be able to}} justify your coverage, and that [...] thinkpieces hailing the {{cultural}} significance of the new pop stars. ... And once you've decided these subjects matter, it's hard to turn round and say: 'Actually, you know what? This isn't much cop.'" [...] He recalls his experience as music editor for The Guardian, where he has [...] "been commissioning those pieces, knowing they will be read ... if no one wanted to read about Taylor Swift, <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> see another thinkpiece about her. Instead, we enter an arms race of hyperbole, as we credit her with forcing Apple to change its streaming terms, dismantling the musical patriarchy, creating new paradigms in music and society." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You devil!" [...] he bellowed. [...] "'Pon my Sam, old horse, {{to look at}} <b>you</b> one <b>would</b> <b>never</b> {{have thought}} you'd have had it in you." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I think," [...] said Hetty, [...] "it {{would be}} {{considerably}} nicer {{for you if}} I didn't. I can, however, tell <b>you</b> this--I <b>would</b> <b>never,</b> under any circumstances, marry you." ...|$|R
500|$|Zicree {{explained}} {{that he did not}} consider [...] "World Enough and Time" [...] to be a fan-film, comparing it to the episodes of Sliders he was a producer on. He said that they sought to do it the same way as a network show, but added that [...] "the level of production is way beyond what any network show would be, because <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> have 700 visual effects shots in a single hour on any network show." [...] However, Cawley said that Zicree treated many of the New Voyages crew poorly, and he was removed from the set after they faced a staff walkout. He {{explained that}} after he spoke to Zicree, the director had a [...] "meltdown" [...] and was unable to complete the shoot. So Cawley asked his friend Carlos Pedraza to complete the episode uncredited.|$|E
500|$|The {{critical}} {{response to}} Pride and Prejudice was overwhelmingly positive. Gerard Gilbert of The Independent recommended the opening {{episode of the}} serial one day before the British premiere, saying the television adaptation is [...] "probably {{as good as it}} [...] The casting in particular deserves a tilt at a BAFTA, Firth not being in the slightest bit soft and fluffy [...] and Jennifer Ehle showing the right brand of spirited intelligence as Elizabeth." [...] He considered Benjamin Whitrow a [...] "real scene-stealer with his Mr. Bennet", but was undecided about Alison Steadman's portrayal of Mrs. Bennet. Reviewing the first episode for the same newspaper on the day after transmission, Jim White praised Andrew Davies for [...] "injecting into the proceedings a pace and energy which at last provides a visual setting to do justice to the wit of the book. With everyone slinging themselves about at high speed (the dances, in a first for the genre, actually involve a bit of sweat), it looks like people are doing something <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> have suspected they did in Austen's time: having fun." ...|$|E
500|$|Kelly {{understands that}} co-writing with other songwriters lends power to his songs. [...] "You often write songs with {{collaborators}} that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> write by yourself. It's {{a way of}} dragging a song out of you that you wouldn't have come up with". One of his collaborators, Linda Bull, described Kelly's process: they would start with a simple chat. [...] "We'd just chuck ideas around and he'd pick the best bits. He'd take all the bluntness and crudeness {{out of it and}} make it beautiful; that's his magic ... It's conversations that you have [...] ". Forster summarised his 2009 review of Kelly's compilation, Songs from the South, with [...] " [...] sound easy and approachable ... Then you think: If the songs are so simple and the ideas behind them so clear, why aren't more people writing like Paul Kelly and sounding as good as he does?" [...] In 2010 Carmody and Kelly's [...] "From Little Things Big Things Grow" [...] was added to the National Film and Sound Archive's Sounds of Australia Registry.|$|E

6000|$|... "But if it wasn't for <b>you</b> he <b>would</b> <b>never</b> have started. And {{now that}} poor Tryst's dead {{he would leave}} it alone. I'm sure only you can make him lose that haunted feeling." ...|$|R
500|$|The episode's plot {{involved}} {{the death of}} former boss Ed Truck, a character who had been played by Ken Howard in the second-season episode [...] "The Carpet". As part of the episode took place outdoors, the cast had to wear coats despite the hot summer weather. Actress Kate Flannery commented in a weekly blog she wrote for TV Guide that [...] "we suffered while shooting the outdoor scenes... We had to act like it was cold when it was warm. For hours and hours. <b>You</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> know it by looking at us. Isn't that crazy?" [...] Flannery also wrote, [...] "I love this episode because it's dark, for a comedy. This time The Office tackles gutsy subject matter." [...] In her memoir Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?, Mindy Kaling wrote that the episode resulted in the worst disagreement she ever had during her years on the show, where she and Greg Daniels, normally a [...] "very nice" [...] person, disagreed on a story point {{to the extent that}} Daniels told her that if [...] "you [...] going to resist what I'm doing here, you can just go home." [...] Kaling briefly left the set before returning, with no further problems or repercussions noted.|$|E
500|$|In 1997, she {{starred in}} the Australian {{ensemble}} romantic drama Under the Lighthouse Dancing and also played the lead role in the short-lived television series Sleepwalkers. In 1998, she starred alongside Neil Patrick Harris and Debbie Reynolds in the TV film The Christmas Wish, played the supporting role of Giulia De Lezze in Dangerous Beauty, and provided some voice work for [...] She {{said in an interview}} in 2012, [...] "That really should not be on my résumé! I think that was early on in the day, when I was trying to beef up my résumé. I came in and did a couple days' work of voiceovers and we had to suck on [...] and then do a little mouse voice. But I was one in a hundred, so I'm sure <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> be able to identify my voice. I probably couldn't either!" [...] In 1999, she played Alice in the romantic comedy Strange Planet and the Texan student Holly Maddux in The Hunt for the Unicorn Killer, which was based on the real life effort to capture Ira Einhorn, who was charged with Maddux's murder. In 2000, while David Lynch was expanding the rejected pilot of Mulholland Drive into a feature film, Watts starred alongside Derek Jacobi, Jack Davenport and Iain Glen in the BBC TV film The Wyvern Mystery, an adaptation of the novel of the same name by Sheridan Le Fanu that was broadcast in March of that year.|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Conan sidekick Andy Richter {{left the}} show, and Weinberg became the [...] "second banana". Weinberg {{continued}} {{to present an}} obvious visual foil: as O'Brien said, [...] "If you looked at this guy <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> know he was the drummer in a huge rock 'n' roll band. You would say {{he was the guy}} who did the band's accounting. But Max is the authoritative, buttoned-down adult {{in the midst of all}} this madness." [...] The drummer reveled in O'Brien's youthful audience: [...] "To be 49 and appreciated by 14-year-olds again? What a thrill!" [...] Weinberg engaged in stare-downs with O'Brien and gave scripted screeds about newsmakers. [...] Additionally, Weinberg was comically presented as a twisted character with sexual fetishes and homicidal tendencies in comedy bits. When Conan O'Brien was host of Saturday Night Live on March 10, 2001, his monologue featured a visit from the SNL studio to the Late Night studio (only a few floors apart in the same building, 30 Rockefeller Plaza), where Conan discovers Weinberg engaged in sexual intercourse with a woman on his desk (played by Max's real-life wife, Becky). [...] Weinberg says of his comic persona: [...] "t's playing against type. I've been happily married for nearly 30 years, with two wonderful children. It's not what I portray on the show, and that's funny." [...] Weinberg continued his one-man college shows, now titled [...] "E Street to Late Night: Dreams Found, Lost, and Found Again".|$|E

2500|$|The {{last known}} bank robbery by Machine Gun Kelly, a Prohibition-era gangster, {{took place on}} November 30, 1932 at the Citizen’s State Bank in Tupelo; his gang netted $38,000. After the robbery, the bank’s chief teller said of Kelly, “He {{was the kind of}} guy that, if you looked at him, <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> thought he was a bank robber.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Rowling {{has also}} {{maintained}} that Harry is a suitable real-life {{role model for}} children. [...] "The advantage of a fictional hero or heroine {{is that you can}} know them better than you can know a living hero, many of whom <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> meet [...] if people like Harry and identify with him, I am pleased, because I think he is very likeable." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{his time}} in America, Hamilton Rowan began writing his Memoirs, fearing he would never return to Ireland. He begins with an address to his family, [...] My dear Children, Whilst {{residing}} at Wilmington on the Delaware, in the United States of America, not expecting to return to Europe, and unwilling to solicit my family to rejoin me there, I was anxious to leave you some memorial of a parent whom in all probability <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> know personally.|$|E

2500|$|The United States then {{fought a}} four-round veto duel with France, forcing it {{to back down}} and accept the {{selection}} of US-educated Kofi Annan {{to be the next}} Secretary-General. President Clinton was very impressed and told Clarke and Sheehan, [...] "Get me a crow, I should eat a crow, because I said <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> pull it off." [...] In his memoirs, Clarke said that [...] "the entire operation had strengthened Albright's hand in the competition to be Secretary of State in the second Clinton administration." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 2015–2016, The Sydney Theatre Company staged King Lear, {{directed}} by Neil Armfield with Geoffrey Rush in the lead role and Robyn Nevin as the Fool. About the madness {{at the heart of}} the play, Rush said that for him [...] "it's about finding the dramatic impact in the moments of his mania. What seems to work best is finding a vulnerability or a point of empathy, where an audience can look at Lear and think how shocking it must be to be that old and to be banished from your family into the open air in a storm. That's a level of impoverishment <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> want to see in any other human being, ever." ...|$|E
2500|$|The website {{made several}} {{high-profile}} mistakes in reporting stories. [...] Editor Nick Denton twice misreported {{the identity of}} the author of the Fake Steve Jobs blog, before Daniel Lyons was outed as the true author. [...] Stating he [...] "ought to have known better", Owen Thomas falsely reported that a drunk employee caused a major power outage at data center 365 Main by relying on the gossip of an unidentified source. [...] Industry analyst and speaker Dave Taylor, who runs several technical and business websites, [...] pointed out, [...] "In journalism school, <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> even think about sharing any gossip of this nature without at least two reliable sources, but that never stopped Owen, nor did it stop other bloggers from picking up the incendiary story and shining a very negative light on the Web server hosting company in question." ...|$|E
