5|$|A skills {{commission}} report released in 2013, backed by Labour MP Barry Sheerman, suggests that <b>young</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> being let {{down by the}} education system, with particular criticism aimed towards the lack of information, advice and guidance available to 14-19 year olds.

40|$|This article revisits ‘diversion’ in {{the context}} of youth justice in Australia. Although ‘diversion’ is omnipresent in youth justice, it is rarely subject to {{critical}} examination. This article raises four interrelated questions: what <b>young</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> to be ‘diverted’ from and to; whether <b>young</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> to be ‘diverted’ from the criminal justice system or from offending; whether <b>young</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> to be ‘diverted’ from criminal justice processes or outcomes; and whether ‘diversion’ should be considered distinct from crime prevention and early intervention. The article concludes that the confusion about youth ‘diversion’ may foster individualised interventions in <b>young</b> <b>people’s</b> lives...|$|R

25|$|The {{residents}} and staff together took {{responsibility for the}} daily maintenance {{of the community and}} all contributed to cooking and cleaning. The <b>young</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> considered to be partners in the therapeutic endeavour and there was an expectation that everyone attended the daily community meetings. These meetings were the heart of the community and often <b>young</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> able to share and resolve very painful experiences from their past, and the daily difficulties and challenges of sixty adults and children living together could be addressed in a helpful way. There were high expectations on young people to help each other and to achieve educationally. Many young people left to go to university and others took up higher education at a later point in their adult lives. Unfortunately a big fire broke out in 1990 and the building was uninsured. Residential care for children has also fallen out of favour as a result of abuse scandals and Peper Harow was sold and redeveloped into flats. It still has an influence today.

25|$|He had a {{dream of}} his own death {{and his mother had}} the same dreams. Since dreams were usually prophetic, this {{depressed}} him, so his mother Frigg made every object on earth vow never to hurt Baldr.

25|$|Kim put {{particular}} emphasis on the mobilisation of youth. Youth Minister Phan Anh, attempted to centralise and heavily regulate all youth organizations, which had proliferated immediately after the Japanese coup. On May 25, an imperial order decreed an inclusive, hierarchical structure for youth organizations. At the apex was the National Youth Council, a consultative body, which advised the minister. Similar councils were to be organised down to the district level. Meanwhile, <b>young</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> asked to join the local squads or groups, from provincial to communal levels. They were given physical training and were charged with maintaining security in their communes. Each provincial town had a training centre, where month-long paramilitary courses were on offer.|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of the}} National Youth Strategy is {{to enable}} all <b>young</b> <b>people</b> to realise their maximum potential, by {{respecting}} their rights and hearing their voices, while protecting and supporting them as they transition from childhood to adulthood.

Parents, families, other significant adults and communities are recognised as playing a critical role in the development and progression of <b>young</b> <b>people.</b> Professionals and volunteers working with young people: 4. Professionals and volunteers who work with <b>young</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> respected, valued and appropriately supported in their work. 5. Those providing services for <b>young</b> <b>people</b> act {{in the best interests of}} <b>young</b> <b>people,</b> and respect and uphold <b>young</b> <b>people’s</b> rights. Policies and practices: 6. An equality perspective is integrated into all policy and practice. Service development and delivery: 7 Government and other stakeholders work collaboratively, with vertical and horizontal communication and cooperation, to achieve more effective services and supports for <b>young</b> <b>people.</b> 8.

25|$|According to the anti-religious press, priests would wander from {{village to}} village surreptitiously {{performing}} religious {{services in the}} homes of believers, while being disguised as wandering repairmen, or some other profession. It also claimed the <b>young</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> being attracted to Christianity by clergy who hired themselves out free of charge to youth parties as games organizers, musicians, choir directors, readers of secular Russian literature, drama-circle directors, etc. It also claimed that many believers were keeping themselves away from churches and priests due to shame of observing religious ritual overtly, and that in response to this many priests performed religious rituals in absentia; this meant that marriage ceremonies were performed over rings that were then sent to absent bride and groom, or that funeral services were performed over empty coffins in which the corpse was later laid in a secular funeral.|$|E
25|$|The era saw the Demographic Transition {{take place}} in Germany. It was a {{transition}} from high birth rates and high death rates to low birth and death rates as the country developed from a pre-industrial to a modernized agriculture and supported a fast-growing industrialized urban economic system. In previous centuries, the shortage of land meant that not everyone could marry, and marriages took place after age 25. After 1815, increased agricultural productivity meant a larger food supply, {{and a decline in}} famines, epidemics, and malnutrition. This allowed couples to marry earlier, and have more children. Arranged marriages became uncommon as <b>young</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> now allowed to choose their own marriage partners, subject to a veto by the parents. The high birthrate was offset by a very high rate of infant mortality and emigration, especially after about 1840, mostly to the German settlements in the United States, plus periodic epidemics and harvest failures. The upper and middle classes began to practice birth control, and a little later so too did the peasants.|$|E

25|$|Much of the African {{diaspora}} was dispersed {{throughout the}} Americas, Europe, and Asia during the Atlantic and Arab slave trades. Beginning in the 8th century, Arabs took African slaves {{from the central}} and eastern portions of the continent (where they were known as the Zanj) and sold them into markets in the Middle East, the Indian subcontinent, and the Far East. Beginning in the 15th century, Europeans captured or bought African slaves from West Africa and {{brought them to the}} Americas and Europe. The Atlantic Slave Trade ended in the 19th century, and the Arab Slave Trade ended {{in the middle of the}} 20th century. The dispersal through slave trading represents the largest forced migrations in human history. The economic effect on the African continent was devastating, as generations of <b>young</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> taken from their communities and societies were disrupted. Some communities created by descendants of African slaves in the Americas, Europe, and Asia have survived to the modern day.

25|$|Hoffman was 52 at {{the time}} of his death on April 12, 1989, which was caused by {{swallowing}} 150 phenobarbital tablets and liquor. He had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 1980. At the time he had recently changed treatment medications and was reportedly depressed when his 83-year-old mother was diagnosed with cancer (she died in 1996 at the age of 90). Some close to Hoffman, including his longtime friend David Denton and fellow Chicago Seven co-defendant Tom Hayden, claimed that as a natural prankster who valued youth, he was also unhappy about reaching middle age, combined with the fact that the ideas of the 1960s had given way to a conservative backlash in the 1980s. In 1984 he had expressed dismay that the current generation of <b>young</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> not as interested in protesting and social activism as youth had been during the 1960s. Hoffman's body was found in his apartment in a converted turkey coop on Sugan Road in Solebury Township, near New Hope, Pennsylvania. At the time of his death, he was surrounded by about 200 pages of his own handwritten notes, many about his own moods.|$|E
