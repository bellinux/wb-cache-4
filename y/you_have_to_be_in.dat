2500|$|In December 2010, it was {{announced}} that India Longford (Beth Kingston) would be murdered in a [...] "dark" [...] new storyline. It {{was announced}} that actor, Jeff Rawle, had been cast in the role of India's murderer. Rawle was best known as playing Amos Diggory in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire in 2005. [...] Rawle was approached by Hollyoaks and met with series producer, Paul Marquess, who explained the storyline. Rawle found the storyline interesting and something which he would like to [...] "have a crack at". Rawle took on the role to highlight the dangers of online dating. Rawle said that the role is [...] "very interesting" [...] for him as he had not played a murderer in his career before. Rawle made his first appearance as Silas on 23 December 2010. Silas was credited as [...] "Mystery Man" [...] in his first episode to keep his identity hidden. He was revealed to be the father of Heidi Costello (Kim Tiddy). In 2011, Rawle revealed that he is delighted to be playing Silas, stating [...] "It's the best role to have. Judy Garland once said, 'If <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> a soap, make sure you don't play the worst part'. She was talking about her own life being a soap, but she's right." [...] Rawle opined that the role of Silas is the [...] "best part" [...] and said that other cast members are jealous as they want to play a villain.

2500|$|Like Dutch {{football}} in general until the mid-1960s, Cruyff's early playing career was considerably influenced by coaching philosophy of British/English coaches such as Vic Buckingham. However, his footballing philosophy shares more similar aspects to free-flowing style of South American football (Brazilian {{football in}} particular) than traditional British/Anglo-Saxon school of football (with distinctively direct, aggressive, heavily athletic, muscular, physical elements in coaching and playing style). The mind-body duality always {{plays an important}} role in his footballing philosophy. In Cruyff’s words, quoted in Dennis Bergkamp's autobiography Stillness and Speed: My Story, “...Because you play football with your head, and your legs are there to help you. If you don't use your head, using your feet won't be sufficient. Why does a player have to chase the ball? Because he started running too late. You have to pay attention, use your brain and find the right position. If you get to the ball late, it means you chose the wrong position. Bergkamp was never late.” For Cruyff, football (the so-called beautiful game) is much an artistic-oriented mind-body game instead of an athletic-oriented physical competition. As he put it, [...] "Every trainer talks about movement, about running a lot. I say don't run so much. Football is a game you play with your brain. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> the right place at the right moment, not too early, not too late." [...] The creativity is always the key element in his footballing philosophy, both as a player and as a manager. Cruyff once compared his more intuitive and individualistic approach with Louis van Gaal's more mechanized and rigid coaching style, “Van Gaal has a good vision on football. But it's not mine. He wants to gel winning teams and has a militaristic way of working with his tactics. I don't. I want individuals to think for themselves and take the decision on the pitch that is best for the situation... I don't have anything against computers, but you judge football players intuitively and with your heart. On the basis of the criteria which are now in use at Ajax [...] I would have failed the test. When I was 15, I could barely kick the ball 15 metres with my left and with the right maybe 20 metres. I would not have been able to take a corner. Besides, I was physically weak and relatively slow. My two qualities were great technique and insight, which happen to be two things you can’t measure with a computer.” ...|$|E
