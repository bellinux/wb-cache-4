500|$|In a 2004 {{interview}} with Araya, when asked, [...] "Did critics realize you were wallowing in parody?" [...] Araya replied, [...] "No.People {{thought we were}} serious!...back then <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>that</b> PMRC, who literally took everything to heart, when in actuality you're trying to create an image. You're trying to scare people on purpose." [...] Araya also denied rumors that Slayer members are Satanists, but they find the subject of Satanism interesting and [...] "we are all on this planet to learn and experience." ...|$|E
500|$|The band used Satanic {{themes in}} both lyrics and live {{performances}} to gain notice among the metal community. The back cover featured 'side 666' and inverted crosses, with Hanneman playing his guitar. Due to the imagery and lyrical content, Slayer received mail from the Parents Music Resource Center telling the band to stop releasing records. [...] Araya comments, [...] "Back then <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>that</b> PMRC, who literally took everything to heart. When in actuality you're {{trying to create}} an image. You're trying to scare people on purpose." [...] The album produced the songs [...] "The Antichrist", [...] "Die by the Sword", and [...] "Black Magic", which are played at Slayer's live shows regularly.|$|E
500|$|Diamond Rio {{released}} its twenty-third official chart single, [...] "Stuff", in May 2000. The song was {{originally intended to}} be the title track to their sixth studio album, {{which would have been}} released on August 22 of the same year, but according to Truman, [...] "Certain radio stations, for some reason, didn't want to play 'Stuff'." [...] As a result, [...] "Stuff" [...] was withdrawn after peaking at number 36 on the country charts, and the album was delayed until February 2001. Following this song's failure, the band released [...] "One More Day" [...] later in 2000. The song was written by Steven Dale Jones and Bobby Tomberlin, the same two writers who wrote [...] "She Misses Him on Sunday the Most". [...] "One More Day" [...] went on to spend two non-consecutive weeks at No.1 on the country charts, with the album, by this point re-titled One More Day, having its release date moved up to February 6, 2001. The song also peaked at No.29 on the Billboard Hot 100, in addition to reaching top 10 on the Adult Contemporary charts (the band's first appearance on that chart). Regarding the song's popularity among fans who have used the song to cope with personal losses, Prout said, [...] "Actually, 'One More Day' was recorded as a love song. Then one of Oklahoma State's basketball team's plane went down, then in early 2001 we lost Dale [...] in Daytona, and then of course, 9/11 came after that. And every event of that year, the song took on a different meaning to different people... We hear quite often in e-mails and people talking to us in shows. If you're asking how it makes us feel? Pretty darn special... to know that <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>that</b> impact on someone's life and helped in a tough time of healing and hope." ...|$|E
