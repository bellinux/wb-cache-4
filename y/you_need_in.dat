[...] Rebecca Haithcoat, who wrote a review for Pitchfork Media, had a more mixed opinion, writing that while the release garners {{much of the same}} excitements as the [...] "expert blend of sleek pop and those big, warm and happy belted house hooks of the ‘90s" [...] that was on Settle, it was, much like Caracal, not as good as Disclosure's debut given that it was [...] "uninspired" [...] and that none of the songs on the EP were [...] "immediate or necessary."

Humber was promoted from junior varsity midway through his sophomore season. He compiled a 4–0 win–loss record with a low 1.09 earned run average (ERA). He went 7–2 as a junior, and posted a 13–1 record with a 0.90 ERA and 146 strikeouts as a senior. A capable batter, he also had a [...]371 batting average with six home runs. Humber threw a shutout in the Texas University Interscholastic League Class 4A semifinals against Cedar Park High School in 2001, his senior season. Although Carthage lost the state championship to Western Hills High School in baseball that year, Humber was named Texas High School Class 4A Player of the Year by the Texas Sports Writers Association. [...] According to former Major League Baseball prospect and East Texas native Alan Move: [...] "Back in high school, he (Humber) threw harder than everyone else and changed speeds pretty well and that's all <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>in</b> high school." ...|$|E

Ingeniously, Blasko is incorporated into the production itself as one of the players, which creates a seamless quality to her musical interludes".|$|E

6000|$|One day I had a lucky thought. A {{great many}} lessons were run {{through in the}} last hour of the day, things we had learnt or should have learnt by heart over night, and after not having known one of them for weeks, I cut off that hour without anybody's leave. I asked the {{mathematical}} master to give me a sum to work and nobody said a word. My father often interfered, and always with disaster, to teach me my Latin lesson. [...] "But I have also my geography," [...] I would say. [...] "Geography," [...] he would reply, [...] "should never be taught. It is not a training for the mind. You will pick up all that <b>you</b> <b>need,</b> <b>in</b> your general reading." [...] And if it was a history lesson, he would say just the same, and [...] "Euclid," [...] he would say, [...] "is too easy. It comes naturally to the literary imagination. The old idea, that it is a good training for the mind, was long ago refuted." [...] I would know my Latin lesson so that it was a nine days' wonder, and for weeks after would be told it was scandalous to be so clever and so idle. No one knew that I had learnt it in the terror that alone could check my wandering mind. I must have told on him at some time or other for I remember the head-master saying, [...] "I am going to give you an imposition because I cannot get at your father to give him one." [...] Sometimes we had essays to write; & though I never got a prize, for the essays were judged by hand-writing and spelling I caused a measure of scandal. I would be called up before some master and asked if I really believed such things, and that would make me angry for I had written what I had believed all my life, what my father had told me, or a memory of the conversation of his friends. There were other beliefs, but they were held by people one did not know, people who were vulgar or stupid. I was asked to write an essay on [...] "men may rise on stepping-stones of their dead selves to higher things." [...] My father read the subject to my mother, who had no interest in such matters. [...] "That is the way," [...] he said, [...] "boys are made insincere and false to themselves. Ideals make the blood thin, and take the human nature out of people." [...] He walked up and down the room in eloquent indignation, and told me not to write on such a subject at all, but upon Shakespeare's lines [...] "to thine own self be true, and it must follow as the night the day thou canst not then be false to any man." [...] At another time, he would denounce the idea of duty, and [...] "imagine," [...] he would say, [...] "how the right sort of woman would despise a dutiful husband;" [...] and he would tell us how much my mother would scorn such a thing. Maybe there were people among whom such ideas were natural, but they were the people with whom one does not dine. All he said was, I now believe right, but he should have taken me away from school. He would have taught me nothing but Greek and Latin, and I would now be a properly educated man, and would not have to look in useless longing at books that have been, through the poor mechanism of translation, the builders of my soul, nor faced authority with the timidity born of excuse and evasion. Evasion and excuse were in the event as wise as the house-building instinct of the beaver.|$|E
