5000|$|Fueled by this experience, Todd went solo {{under the}} name Books on Tape, a project {{in which he would}} craft his now {{instantly}} recognizable signature. Unlike many electronica producers (bedroom or otherwise), Todd is unafraid to do things you’re not supposed to do, like trying to recreate a guitar strumming effect in a sequencer, or laying his songs upon shockingly unorthodox rhythms. However, two important qualities can be found in equal measure in his entire oeuvre: energy and groove. In December 2002, the first widely available Books on Tape CD was released under the title Throw Down <b>Your</b> <b>Laptops</b> (Deathbomb Arc). As a companion release, No Type released a 10" [...] EP featuring a different version of the song [...] "Hey Typical!" [...] plus unreleased material. Following that, a CD, titled Books on Tape Sings The Blues, was released in September 2003 by No Type and Greyday Productions. In October 2003, Books on Tape made its first New York City appearance at the esteemed CMJ festival, garnering rave reviews. This was followed up by an eastern Canadian tour and more New York dates in early 2004. Books on Tape has also appeared at Pop Montreal and the MACRoCk conference in Harrisonburg, VA. In late 2004 came the 40-minute EP The Business End (Greyday Productions), which hit Chart Attack!'s (Canadian college radio) electronic #1 slot for seven weeks and ended the year as the number two electronic record in Canada for 2004. In 2005, Books on Tape hit the road numerous times in preparation for his upcoming release on Alien8 Recordings (The Unicorns, Les Georges Leningrad) exposing new parts of the country to the unique, high-energy live efforts that have made a name for Books on Tape. Dinosaur Dinosaur (Alien8 Recordings) was released on October 18, 2005, and is widely being hailed as Books on Tape's finest release to date, and more closely representing Todd's punky live sound. Todd's sister, Stefanie Drootin, who plays bass with Bright Eyes and The Good Life, is a guest vocalist on the track [...] "When Siblings Attack". In support of this album, Books on Tape toured the U.S. with The Show Is the Rainbow (who quite ironically has a song making fun of Bright Eyes' Conor Oberst) in fall 2005 and with Captain Ahab in spring 2006, as well as eastern Canada in early 2006 with comedian Nick Flanagan. Late 2006 marked the release of Books On Tape's self-released CD-R of remixes and rarities, Who Shot Ya?, featuring remixes from numn, Doofgoblin, Poingly, and Brian Miller (of Foot Village).

40|$|PRE 2 : How to Web 2. 0 This {{session was}} quite {{interesting}} {{in that it}} went over many of todays web 2. 0 websites. The session itself could be considered introductory allowing people to view and play with web 2. 0 websites. It did not go into greater depth of why web 2. 0 could be considered beneficial to an institution or what the adoption rate is like or the technology behind web 2. 0. For this particular presentation I was disappointed at the content that was provided. CONFRENCE: I spent two full days at the conference attending as many workshops as time would allow. These workshops {{for the most part}} were fascinating and the most important thing I learned was that we, as an institution, are not alone in our goals. It was informative to see the many presentations as well as discuss with some of the presenters, the solutions that they have come up with in managing a transition of a rebrand or the implementation of a CMS like alfresco or both concurrently. Numerous ideas were shown by other institutions, which I feel, allowed us (Tim Terry’s group also attended) to bring home the best ideas. It also allowed us to learn of potential roadblocks that we may face that similar institutions have encountered in similar situations with a project like the university is implementing. I would love to do a presentation next year in regards to Google Analytics. There were very little presentations that actually delved into the marketing side of the web and ways in which an institution could increase the amount of traffic driven to there website. We have done this quite successfully and I feel {{that it would be a}} great opportunity to share out story off success, especially in regards to the online ad campaign from the School Of Business. POST 2 : Advanced CSS Workshop This workshop was great fun to attend and a good example in the future of how to present and involve th participants. We went over numerous technologies that can be implement-using CSS. Numerous ideas were shared as well as each participant receiving a cd with the files as well as the completed solutions that were shown. It allowed attendees to follow along and fix mistakes as they went. Overall it was a great presentation that was full of many real world ideas that we as an institution could implement to get us through the next major upgrade to our website. 1) 	PRE 2 : How to [...] .
