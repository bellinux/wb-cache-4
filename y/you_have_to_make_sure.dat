5000|$|Expanding {{upon his}} thesis in Hitler's War {{about the lack}} of a written Führer order for the Holocaust, Irving argued in the 1990s that the absence of such an order meant that there was no Holocaust.

At the same time I have investigated how the free play is adapted into everyday practice in the preschool. Previous research shows that children process what they experienced in the free play. The child retrieves content to play with through things they have experienced, such as family life, preschool and so on. To play, grow and continue, {{it is important that}} free play may take place and space in the daily activities at the preschool. To do so the preschool teachers must organize time so that the free play can have the space that it requires at the preschool. The method I have chosen for this study is two interviews with two preschool teachers and four observations at a preschool. In the interviews I found out that the preschool teachers believes that participation and the presence of an adult in the free play is of great importance. If you as a preschool teacher are involved in the free play at the preschool, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that the free play continues to develop and survives.

40|$|The PARSNIP is, {{as many of}} {{you will}} know, a {{reference}} to all those topics that are commonly {{left out of the}} standard ELT coursebook: Politics, Alcohol, Religion, Sex, Narcotics, -Isms, Pork. And it is easy to understand why these things are not included - in simple terms coursebooks are written for the largest possible market and therefore can only ever concentrate on the safest common denominator in terms of topics. You {{might be able to get}} away with a discussion on the differences between democratic governments and dictatorships in Portugal, but the chances are you might find it more difficult in Belarus. So if you want to sell a coursebook in both Portugal and Belarus, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that the topics are not going to prove overly contentious or possibly lead to the arrest and deportation of the teacher and closing of the school.

The Parsnips in ELT project is an attempt to provide resources and support for teachers who do want to engage their classes in more meaningful topics and discussions. Or at the very least to do something different! It is however, up to you and your own personal and professional judgment whether you choose to use these lesson plans in your context and with your classes, or even if you choose to read them at all!

My study focused generally on children with special needs, but not against any particular diagnosis or a particular area related to children with special needs. To get answers to my questions I used qualitative interviews. I wanted to find out teachers' views on inclusion through my issues. Do the same laborious manner? Can they include the children giving other children anything? Operates the basis of the policy documents? My informants were three pre-school teachers and an educator who works as a preschool teacher but are trained in physical therapy for children with special needs. The results show that the informants are mostly positive about inclusion, but they feel that more resources are needed for children's group. A teacher thinks it is a vision that we are not quite there yet in terms of inclusion. Informants believe that the children with special needs and other children's group, is a complement to each other with their different experiences. The informants are striving for that all children in kindergarten to feel equal. And they are trying to build the business so it will suit all children's needs and circumstances. But there are concerns about the environment that will build on the needs of all children. It is difficult to build up the environment for all children to explore according to their needs. Some obstacles may occur when <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> no child's needs and you have to remove the spent material not can be there.

40|$|A lot {{of urban}} {{planners}} {{talk about the}} great thing called: “Citizen participation” {{but none of them}} actually talk about how you get them involved. Neither do they discuss how difficult it can be to get the citizens motivated. And they do not say anything about what you do, if no one turns up at your workshop! Therefore, I have been asking myself: “How can I get citizens involved, but in a non-participation way?” I have been asking this question, because I have been working with topics as recycling, behaviour change, local citizens, and an informative campaign the last three to four months. Besides Roskilde University I study at Imagine Nørrebro, at the Project Academy (PA). This is an education that develops creative project leaders who improve their skills in facilitating, managing and monitoring progress of a project. I have been assigned a job for the environmental organization, Miljøpunkt Nørrebro, with another student from PA. Our job was to find out how we could get the 160 households, who had signed up for the pilot study (Smart Miljøstation, Nørrebro), to recycle more. We had great intention for the job and invited the citizens to a workshop, but only one showed up. Therefore, we had to find another way of addressing these citizens. As a result of this, Sherry R. Arnstein’s “Ladder of Citizen Participation” inspired me, because she looks at different methods for involving citizens. I have chosen to work with the level of informing, as it could be helpful to get in contact with the citizens. We have designed an informative campaign (Brug låget – igen og igen) that is focusing on recycling of metal, where the citizens get a personalized leaflet. By recycling their metal they are also a part of a competition where they can win a bike made of recycled materials. So, the purpose of this project is to look upon citizen participation in an informative way, and in which way it can affect the 160 households. Further more, I include the theory of nudging as previously studies show an increase in recycling by nudging people. My conclusion is {{that it is possible to}} affect people in an informative way, but <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that the citizens understand the message in the leaflet. Nudging can also increase recycling, but the choice architect must be aware how he/she should nudge the citizens and not be manipulating...|$|E
40|$|The {{conference on}} “Sexual Violence, the Armed Forces and Military Operations,” {{arranged}} by the Gender Project at the Norwegian Defence University College in Oslo 17 th of June 2011. By taping and transcribing the presentations, assisted {{and approved by}} the contributors, we are happy to offer a conference report. The report seeks to provide the insights and sentiments of the conference to those unable to attend, as if they were actually there. The United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1325 (2000) on Women, Peace and Security has put gender on the international agenda. Since then, the international community has renewed its commitment to UNSCR 1325 by adopting UNSCR 1820 (2008), UNSCR 1888 (2009) and UNSCR 1960 (2010) on Sexual Violence in conflicts. They recognise sexual violence as a tactic of war, war crime and crime against humanity and call for preventive actions and ending impunity. Fulfilling these obligations requires adequate handling of sexual violence in military operations and the prevention of sexual harassment within the ranks. The international conference on Sexual Violence, the Armed Forces and Military Operations in Oslo, June 2011, offered a unique forum for experts and practitioners to discuss the interconnectedness between these issues and to draw implications for the armed forces. Targeting military personnel, keynote speaker and UN Secretary General’s Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict, Margot Wallström, urged: “… As commanders, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that the message is clearly conveyed {{that there can be no}} impunity for this type of crime. “This will not happen on my watch. You will be punished; you will be pursued if you commit such a crime. ” We should also talk about men as victims, because today men and boys are among the victims of sexual violence; I still remember a young man who we met in the DRC in a panel where we interviewed for a reparation scheme. This young man told us that he did not even know about rape before. He was totally traumatized. He said: “I have nothing left. I have the shirt, the clothes that I have on my body, but that is all. ” He lost his wife and his child, and is now totally lost in a world that he could no longer really understand and in deep shock over having been gang raped… … It is not only, although it is still primarily, women or girls who are victims of sexual violence, but it is also boys and young men. Does this mean that we can mobilize more men to fight with us against sexual violence in war and conflict? I hope so…...|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} of enclosures Cue: The H 5 N 1 avian flu virus {{is not the}} first kind of avian flu to affect poultry flocks, either in Africa or other parts of the world. However, this particular strain of the virus is especially dangerous, because as well as affecting birds, it can also be passed to humans, and is often fatal. Once an outbreak occurs, the most effective way of preventing it from spreading is, currently, by destroying affected birds and preventing transfer of the virus outside the outbreak area. However this is an expensive and labour-intensive process. It is therefore much better to invest in protecting poultry flocks so that they are less like to catch the virus, than try to deal with outbreaks when they occur. So how can poultry, flocks be protected? For some diseases such as Newcastle disease, vaccinations are available. However, with avian flu the effectiveness of vaccines is less clear, and most countries are not adopting vaccination as a control strategy. Instead, poultry keepers are being advised to protect their flocks by housing their birds in some kind of enclosure or cage, and taking precautions to ensure that all food and water are disease-free. Dorothy Tumbo lives in Bulawayo in Zimbabwe, and keeps chickens in an enclosure, called a fowl run, in her backyard. She spoke to Sylvia Jiyane about how this helps to protect her birds, and began by explaining how, on one occasion when some of her birds got sick, she took them to a local veterinary clinic. The vets feared they might have a form of avian flu, although not the H 5 N 1 strain, which has not yet occurred in Zimbabwe. IN:		?At one time I had about 50 ?? OUT:		??more if they are infected. ? DUR?N:	 6 ? 51 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Celia Abolnik, a senior research assistant from a veterinary institute in South Africa, was talking to Lucas Moloi. Earlier we heard Sylvia Jiyane interviewing urban poultry keeper Dorothy Tumbo. The interviews come from a radio resource pack on avian flu produced by CTA. Transcript Tumbo	At one time I had about 50 that I had taken, and over 30 actually died because of avian flu. What actually happened is that the other person, who was about five houses away from where I was, had their chickens actually dying. And then mine also started dying and when we took our chicks to the vet, that was when we were told there was an outbreak of a disease actually around our area. They thought it was avian flu, and they also suspected it could be Newcastle, but we left them with the chicks so they could actually test. These guys, the people from the vet, also encouraged us to clean our fowl runs. If one group of poultry is ready for market you remove it, then you have to clean your fowl run and spray it with chemicals before you put a new batch of poultry into the fowl run. You find that if you keep on doing that you find that cleaning, you have to be clean, you have to spray your fowl runs, and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that the water and all the vaccines are given to the poultry, and also make sure that the eating utensils are clean, and there is a clean supply of water. That way you eliminate the diseases, but if you are not very careful then you will see that the chicks or the poultry will actually start to just die and if you don?t realise it {{at the end of the}} day you won?t have anything left, because all of them will be attacked by the diseases. Jiyane	That brings us to the point of access to the poultry house. In your own experience, maybe at your house, who normally accesses the poultry enclosure? Tumbo	Actually I have got one person who is managing that, sort of a worker, a woman I employed, and she?s the one who is actually feeding those chickens. You look at the number of chickens you are having, and then <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that you have enough feeding trays that will cover, so that at least you don?t keep on going into the fowl run now and again to replace the feed that will be finished. What you have to do, you have to look at them well measured, to say that at least if I?ve got these big, five or six big containers, and if I put in the morning, it means the next time I will put the feed will be in the evening, so that at least you limit the number of going in and out to about twice a day only, and with only one person going in to replace the water the feed, and everything. So you have to have feeding trays and water points which are almost enough to last a full day, or about 12 hours, before you go in there. Jiyane	And besides the risks of diseases, like we have mentioned avian flu, Newcastle and other diseases, what could be the other risks of keeping poultry in the backyard? Tumbo	Yes the other risks, especially in urban areas is there are a lot of thieves, and if people realise that there is poultry that is being kept there, they would want to come and actually steal them when they are almost ready. So you fowl run has to be quite strong, and if possible put some burglar bars, and also make sure that it is always under lock and key so that people don?t access your chickens. Otherwise, besides the thieves the other risk is mainly that one we have talked about of diseases. Because if all those are eliminated it is quite a viable business which can actually generate a lot of income for people. Jiyane	And finally, Dorothy, in the event of a disease outbreak in poultry enclosures, what are the practical steps that one should take to prevent the disease from spreading? Tumbo	If you have noticed that, especially maybe the first thing you have to see is maybe you can see one animal dropping dead, and then you see another maybe showing signs that it is not well. What you have to do is you have to remove them, actually isolate them, remove those birds that you see are not well. Remove them and put them somewhere away and actually observe. If it keeps on going then you have to seek advice from other people, like what I said in the beginning that we ended up taking the birds to the vet, so that at least they can test to see what it was that was affecting the chickens. NARR	While keeping backyard poultry in enclosures may be possible for urban poultry keepers like Dorothy, what about for those in villages, whose chickens normally scavenge for food around the homesteads? Should they also be kept in an enclosure? In areas where the risk of avian flu is high ? for example because of the presence of migratory birds ? keeping all poultry in some kind of house or enclosure is definitely recommended. To find out more about how, and why this should be done, Lucas Moloi spoke to Celia Abolnik, a senior research assistant at the Arc-Onderstepport Veterinary Institute in Pretoria, South Africa. Moloi	In areas affected by the avian flu, what are the advantages of keeping poultry in fenced enclosures? Abolnik	Obviously if your birds are fenced they are separated from birds that are free ranging that might be carrying infectious diseases. In the ideal situation you would want an enclosed structure, but the best thing to do is not to leave open food and water that will attract wild birds into contact with chickens. So the sharing of food and water is probably the major way in which wild birds, or free ranging birds are encouraged into contact with poultry. Moloi	So is there a particular material and design to construct a safe enclosure? Abolnik	It must be bird proof, it must be rat proof. The water must be, and the feed must be separated from any contact with birds and rodents from outside. Moloi	Some poultry keepers may not afford expensive material and design. What should they do to protect their poultry? Abolnik	You could use inexpensive materials to build an enclosure that is rat and bird proof. Moloi	Like? Abolnik	Mud bricks, grass, sheet metal, anything that they have access to. Moloi	Should there be restrictions on who to enter poultry enclosures in areas affected by the avian flu? Abolnik	Definitely. A poultry owner should not allow any person just to walk into his poultry enclosure, especially since they may be carrying infected poultry or wild bird faeces on their person, their boots, their shoes, their clothes, their hands, and handling of birds might transmit the disease in that way. Moloi	Is there a special diet that poultry could be fed with to reduce chances of contracting the avian flu? Abolnik	There is no special diet that will prevent them getting avian flu, although the {{importance of}} good nutrition is vital, because birds that are immuno-suppressed, birds that have a very weak immune system, sometimes due to hunger, or because they are not getting all the nutrients, might be more predisposed to infections, and might suffer and die more if they are infected.
