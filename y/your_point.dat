Tintin and Alph-Art was set to be Hergé's last great masterpiece", he disagreed, describing this as [...] "surely just wishful thinking". He added {{that it could be}} seen as [...] "a nostalgic, or regressive book, depending on <b>your</b> <b>point</b> of view." ...|$|E

500|$|Edge {{compared}} the game favorably to System Shock {{due to its}} balanced combination of action and strategy, stating that {{in just two years}} Looking Glass [...] "has metamorphosed from one of the industry's secret technology powerhouses to a hugely respected developer in its own right." [...] John Payne of The Washington Post wrote, [...] "Depending on <b>your</b> <b>point</b> of view, Terra Nova is either a stripped-down Mechwarrior or a souped-up Doom." [...] However, he stated that it was enjoyable regardless of which perspective was taken. While he described the game's animation as [...] "fluid", he found its graphics in general to be [...] "fairly blocky, even at a distance". He finished his review by stating that the game [...] "requires more practice than action fans are used to" [...] but provides [...] "a nice payoff". Next Generation Magazine wrote, [...] "Looking Glass has always been known for breaking the barriers of conventional gameplay, and it has done it again with Terra Nova". The magazine considered the game to be [...] "an all around stunning effort".|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reaction}} to the album's lyrical content was mixed. Thom Jurek of Allmusic felt the [...] "dark, unrelentingly twisted-as-fuck lyrics reflect a singular intensity," [...] and praised the band for connecting their anti-religion stance with a belief that religion has underscored many wars throughout history. However, Rolling Stones Chris Steffen mourned that it had become [...] "downright painful to hear Tom Araya — at 45 years old! — continue to belt out the band's increasingly self-parodying, anti-religious lyrics," [...] and singled out lyrics such as [...] "Religion's a whore" [...] and [...] "I've made my choice: six six six!" [...] as over the top. Jamie Thomson of The Guardian wrote that the album left [...] "no blasphemy... unuttered", while Peter Atkinson of KNAC.com observed that [...] "when not fixating on religion, the band revisit their other favorite subject — war — in surprisingly familiar terms," [...] and remarked that Slayer had sunk [...] "to the level of God-repelling dunderheads Deicide." [...] He concluded the review with the opinion that [...] "It's déjà {{vu all over again}} from God Hates Us All — and once you've titled something God Hates Us All, haven't you made <b>your</b> <b>point</b> enough already?" ...|$|E
500|$|Frazier {{opened his}} junior season, {{and his first}} year under coach Pat Chambers, on November 5, 2011 in an {{exhibition}} game against Slippery Rock. He led the team in scoring with 19 points. Frazier also posted 7 assists and 6 rebounds, helping Penn State win the game 64–47. He {{took part in the}} Nittany Lions' first regular season contest on November 12 against Hartford, with 12 points, 6 assists, and 5 steals in spite of being given 28 minutes on the court. When asked on his communication with Frazier, Chambers said, [...] "I'm telling him to make plays... he has to be one of our leading scorers. He's got to look to score." [...] In the following game, Frazier made his second career display with 20 or more points. He also matched his career-high total on assists, with 10. This was his second double-double with Penn State. Frazier also finished with 6 rebounds, 3 steals, and 1 block. Chambers said in a post-game interview, [...] "I'm very greedy. I'm an old point guard, so I want more out of Tim Frazier, if you can imagine... what more means is even more leadership, even better habits. We're always trying to create the best habits we can for the most difficult situation.". Frazier helped power the 62–46 victory over Radford, the team's second consecutive win in the regular season. It was also Penn State's first round game in the Hall of Fame Tip Off tournament. In his next game against LIU-Brooklyn, Frazier scored a career-high 26 points and matched his assists record for the second straight game, with 10. It was his second-straight double-double and the third in his stint with Penn State. Chambers commented after the game, [...] "Tim was terrific. He was a great leader tonight. He did everything you ask <b>your</b> <b>point</b> guard to do tonight." [...] He helped the program reach a 3–0 record {{for the third time in}} 12 seasons. Following up on a loss to Kentucky, Frazier recorded 27 points on November 20, 2011 against South Florida. The next game, Frazier recorded a career-high 11 assists en route to his 4th double-double in 2011. On January 11, 2012, Frazier scored a career-high 30 points against Nebraska, with his team losing the game, 70–58. He led the Big Ten with eight 20-point games through the course of the year. By the end of the season, Frazier averaged 18.8 points, 6.2 assists, 4.7 rebounds, 2.4 steals, and 0.2 blocks. It was his highest scoring average with Penn State. He was named the John Lawther Team MVP, Second Team NABC All-District, All-Big Ten First Team, Academic All-Big Ten, Basketball Times' All-District, and Big Ten All-Defensive Team.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the fighting, the division was used as political bargaining chip (among other arguments) during a series of back and forth telegrams between Churchill and Prime Minister of Australia John Curtin, discussing the possibility of diverting Australian troops to Burma rather than being allowed to return home.

[...] Two days later, Curtin retorted [...] "In regard to your statement that the 18th Division was diverted from Burma to Singapore because of our message, it is pointed out that the date of the latter was January 23, whereas in your telegram of January 14 you informed me that one brigade of this division was due on January 13 and the remainder on January 27." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{fourth class}} of racing in BMX which are held at local and {{national}} events are called Opens. Opens are largely exhibition and are a chance to test yourself and practice against better competition without jeopardizing <b>your</b> <b>point</b> standings. You must be registered to race in a points race {{to sign up for}} the Open events. No points are awarded for Opens although trophy places are and the moto qualification rounds are similar to the point races. These are races with more flexible skill level and age requirements. In Opens there are no Novice, Intermediate and Expert divisions. All amateur skill levels are free to participate. The age groupings are generally broader, for example 13-14 open class as opposed to 13 Intermediate and 14 Intermediate being separate groupings for those ages in the points races. Girls may also participate in the male Open class within the proper age ranges. However expert boys are not allowed in these [...] "Mixed" [...] opens. Then an Expert Open is held in that event. The pros are excluded from racing with the amateurs if enough pros are at hand to race that a separate Pro-Open class can be created. If not, then the pros can race in the amateur Open with some restrictions. This is called a Pro-Am event. Except for the Pro-Am exception the Expert racers usually wins the open class. Even if there are Pros in the Open, {{it is not unusual for}} an older Expert-17-18 age class for example-to win since many have the talent and speed to be a pro but have not yet taken the opportunity, partly because once you go Pro, you can go back to amateur only under very strict circumstances.|$|E
2500|$|In 1977, Cruyff {{announced}} his irreversible decision {{to retire from}} international football {{at the age of}} 30, despite still lean and wiry, after helping the country qualify for the 1978 World Cup. A move which was shrouded in mystery and met with disbelief back in late 1977, was only finally stripped of its mystique in 2008, when Cruyff lifted the lid on his decision in an interview with Catalunya Radio. It was while still living in Barcelona as a player in late 1977, Cruyff and his family became the victims of an armed attacker who forced his way into his flat in Barcelona. And the man who was then the ultimate football superstar was confronted with the choice between family values and a highly promising World Cup glory {{at the end of his}} international career. But for Cruyff, family comes first. In the interview with Catalunya Radio, he said that the attempted kidnap was the reason he decided not to go to the World Cup in Argentina in 1978. As he recalled, “You should know that I had problems at the end of my career as a player here and I don't know if you know that someone [...] a rifle at my head and tied me up and tied up my wife in front of the children at our flat in Barcelona. The children were going to school accompanied by the police. The police slept in our house for three or four months. I was going to matches with a bodyguard. All these things change <b>your</b> <b>point</b> of view towards many things. There are moments in life in which there are other values. We wanted to stop this and be a little more sensible. It was the moment to leave football and I couldn't play in the World Cup after this.” ...|$|E
