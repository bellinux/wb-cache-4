5|$|And <b>Yet</b> <b>It</b> Moves is a {{platform}} video game developed by independent developer Broken Rules. The game was released for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux on April 2, 2009, and a Wii port {{was released on}} the Wii Shop Channel in August 2010. And <b>Yet</b> <b>It</b> Moves was originally designed as a computer science project at the Vienna University of Technology in 2007. When the original prototype won or was nominated for awards at various independent game festivals, the team decided to create a full version of the game.|$|E
5|$|First, Universal {{knew that}} it did not have {{trademark}} rights to King Kong, <b>yet</b> <b>it</b> proceeded to broadly assert such rights anyway. This amounted to a wanton and reckless disregard of Nintendo's rights.|$|E
5|$|And <b>Yet</b> <b>It</b> Moves {{focuses on}} moving the player {{character}} {{through a series}} of hazardous environments. The player possesses the ability to freely rotate the entire game world, transforming walls into floors and vice versa. The game's levels and puzzles are designed around this concept. The game features paper collage styled visuals designed by Jan Hackl and a beatboxing soundtrack performed by Christoph Binder.|$|E

And there's men as don't know hardly how to say <b>it,</b> and <b>yet</b> <b>it's</b> {{in their}} hearts all the while." [...] Polly must have been {{thinking}} of Ontario as she made this latter oracular observation.|$|R
60|$|Oh, it's so despicable. And <b>yet</b> <b>it's</b> {{too strong}} for me.... I can't help {{thinking}} that I'm--free.|$|R
60|$|No, I don't. I believe I like him. <b>Yet</b> <b>it's</b> almost unbelievable. I've {{always thought}} men so detestable.|$|R
5|$|Both the PC and WiiWare {{versions}} of the game received positive reviews, with many critics applauding the gameplay mechanics and the visuals. And <b>Yet</b> <b>It</b> Moves was also released {{as part of the}} third Humble Indie Bundle.|$|E
5|$|Broken Rules {{currently}} {{has no plans}} to develop a sequel to And <b>Yet</b> <b>It</b> Moves, due to the time spent on the game. Bohatsch commented that he is unopposed to the idea and is amenable to proposals to develop such a game.|$|E
5|$|Chinese envoys {{had been}} sailing through the Indian Ocean to India since perhaps the 2nd century BC, <b>yet</b> <b>it</b> {{was during the}} Tang dynasty that a strong Chinese {{maritime}} presence {{could be found in}} the Persian Gulf and Red Sea, into Persia, Mesopotamia (sailing up the Euphrates River in modern-day Iraq), Arabia, Egypt, Aksum (Ethiopia), and Somalia in the Horn of Africa.|$|E

5|$|Circulation reached 9,000, then {{a sizable}} number, <b>yet</b> <b>it</b> was ill-managed and {{eventually}} {{fell victim to}} the economic Panic of 1837. He also published the campaign news sheet of the new Whig Party in New York for the 1834 campaign, and came to believe in its positions, including free markets with government assistance in developing the nation.|$|E
5|$|Corrupt {{politicians}} are {{already beginning to}} speculate on them as possible capital for their schemes and to fill their poor heads {{with all sorts of}} vagaries. Florida is the State into which they have, more than anywhere else, been pouring. Emigration is positively and decidedly setting that way; but as <b>yet</b> <b>it</b> is mere worldly emigration, with the hope of making money, nothing more.|$|E
5|$|Fast pace {{of life in}} Viet Nam {{during the}} decades of {{integration}} and development witnesses {{the changes in the}} traditional ao dai. This {{does not mean that the}} traditional ao dai is disappearing from Vietnamese life. <b>Yet,</b> <b>it</b> is becoming more adaptable to these modern days.|$|E

5|$|Heinrich {{also notes}} the {{possibility}} that national parliaments could appoint citizen representatives to the UNPA, similarly to how the U.S. Electoral College officially selects the President. This would be a stopgap solution until direct election became possible. <b>Yet</b> <b>it</b> would still ensure that citizens would be electing citizens (albeit indirectly), rather than the executive appointing officials, to the UNPA.|$|E
5|$|Keynes's {{experience}} at Versailles was influential in shaping his future outlook, <b>yet</b> <b>it</b> {{was not a}} successful one for him. Keynes's main interest had been in trying to prevent Germany's compensation payments being set so high it would traumatise innocent German people, damage the nation's ability to pay and sharply limit her ability to buy exports from other countries â€“ thus hurting not just Germany's own economy but that of the wider world.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps one of Zobel's most {{fascinating}} inventions is the lattice filter section. This section is both constant resistance and flat response zero attenuation across the band, <b>yet</b> <b>it</b> is constructed out of inductors and capacitors. The only signal parameter it modifies is {{the phase of}} the signal at different frequencies.|$|E

5|$|Testing is the preview branch {{that will}} {{eventually}} become the next major release. The packages included in this branch have had some testing in unstable {{but they may not}} be fit for release <b>yet.</b> <b>It</b> contains newer packages than stable but older than unstable. This branch is updated continually until it is frozen. Testings CDs and DVDs {{can be found on the}} Debian website.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} known botanical {{collection of}} B.verticillata {{was made by}} Scottish surgeon and naturalist Archibald Menzies during the visit of the Vancouver Expedition to King George Sound in September and October 1791. As {{a result of this}} collection the species was introduced into cultivation in England, <b>yet</b> <b>it</b> did not result in formal publication of the species.|$|E
5|$|And <b>Yet</b> <b>It</b> Moves {{received}} generally favorable reviews. The PC version gained aggregate {{scores of}} 71.50% and 75 on GameRankings and Metacritic, respectively, while the WiiWare version gained aggregate scores of 85.30% and 83. Critics applauded the game's unique {{take on the}} platforming genre and the game's paper collage visual style, but felt the game was too short. Some critics noted {{the absence of any}} narrative or backstory, but felt that the game ultimately didn't need one, though GameSpot noted it as one of the game's weaknesses.|$|E

5|$|Assuming for the {{purposes}} of argument, however, that evolution is a religion or religious tenet, the remedy is to stop the teaching of evolution, not establish another religion in opposition to it. <b>Yet</b> <b>it</b> is clearly established in the case law, and perhaps also in common sense, that evolution is not a religion and that teaching evolution does not violate the Establishment Clause, Epperson v. Arkansas, supra, Willoughby v. Stever, No. 15574-75 (D.D.C. May 18, 1973); aff'd. 504 F.2d 271 (D.C. Cir. 1974), cert. denied , 420 U.S. 924 (1975); Wright v. Houston Indep. School Dist., 366 F.

5|$|At Passo de Torres, many shipyards were destroyed, as {{they were}} not {{designed}} to withstand the pressure differentials caused by Catarina's winds; widespread roof damage was reported at this municipality as well. Near the Mampituba River, a house was blown about 50meters (165ft) upstream, literally landing in another state: it originally {{was built in the}} Torres municipality of Rio Grande do Sul, <b>yet</b> <b>it</b> ended up in Passo de Torres, within Santa Catarina. In rural areas, the corn, banana, and rice fields received the most damage, although rice farmers were able to partially recoup their losses, as they had harvested before Catarina made landfall.|$|E
5|$|Because And <b>Yet</b> <b>It</b> Moves was {{originally}} designed to be played with digital controls, the Wii Remote's analog motion controls needed to be implemented such that they felt natural and not intrusive. Broken Rules determined, following a number of tests, that allowing the player to freely rotate to any degree best suited motion controls; originally the player could only rotate in 90 degree intervals. Four different control schemes were implemented to satisfy a wide number of players, three of which either use motion control or the Wii Remote pointer. While the file size limit imposed on WiiWare games was not an issue, the visuals needed to be downsampled to cohere with the Wii hardware. A standard-definition television was used in development; Bohatsch felt the visuals looked nicer on the SDTV than on a PC or Mac with higher display resolution, but warned that some HDTVs might not upsample the Wii resolution properly, recommending that a component cable be used while playing the game. The online leaderboards were omitted from the Wii version because the PC version's leaderboards were not frequently used. Three new levels, unlocked when the player completes the main campaign mode, were added. The near {{final version of the}} game was submitted to Nintendo's Quality Assurance team in May 2010 to inspect and find bugs. And <b>Yet</b> <b>It</b> Moves was released on the Wii Shop Channel in North America on August 23, 2010 and then in Europe on August 27.|$|E
