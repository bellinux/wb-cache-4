30|$|We find {{evidence}} of a positive impact of parents’ <b>years</b> <b>since</b> migration on children’s academic achievement. Our {{results suggest that the}} mother’s <b>years</b> <b>since</b> migration are generally most important for grades in Danish and mainly for boys, while the father’s <b>years</b> <b>since</b> migration are most important for grades in math and for drop-out and no exam. The effect of the mother’s <b>years</b> <b>since</b> migration persists no matter whether she is employed or not, while the effect of the father disappears if he is not employed. This pattern of results may indicate that the <b>years</b> <b>since</b> migration of the mother matters because she better supports Danish language acquisition when she has resided in the country for many years, while the <b>years</b> <b>since</b> migration of the father matters because he better supports the importance of education for succeeding in the Danish labour market. These results emphasize the importance of our distinction between each parent’s <b>years</b> <b>since</b> migration, which contrasts the approach taken in the earlier literature.|$|R

30|$|To be specific, {{we study}} {{the impact of}} each parent’s <b>years</b> <b>since</b> {{migration}} prior to birth of the child in question on pupils’ achievement as measured by subject-specific exam grades in the school exit exams, drop-out and no exam in form 9. We find that generally the mother’s <b>years</b> <b>since</b> migration are most important for grades in Danish, while the father’s <b>years</b> <b>since</b> migration are most important for grades in math and for drop-out and no exam. This {{emphasizes the importance of}} our distinction between each parent’s <b>years</b> <b>since</b> migration, which contrasts the approach in the earlier literature. When we split the sample by gender, we find that the positive effect of mother’s <b>years</b> <b>since</b> migration only persists for boys. This indicates that family-specific effects influence girls and boys differently. A plausible explanation is that family-specific effects include factors that are closely related to norms and attitudes regarding education and gender role patterns, and that this is what shows up in the results.|$|R
