2500|$|Trump paid $100,000 of Trump Foundation {{funds in}} 2012 to Reverend Franklin Graham's Billy Graham Evangelical Association. NBC News has called Graham [...] "an early ally" [...] of Trump. [...] "The more {{you listen to}} him, the more <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>yourself,</b> 'You know, maybe the guy's right,'" [...] Graham had told ABC News in 2011. In October 2016 Graham {{revealed}} to the Charlotte Observer that, in 2012, he had instructed Trump to make the $100,000 donation and that the money was {{used to pay for}} full page ads urging voters to support candidates in the 2012 presidential election who supported [...] "biblical values". [...] The Observer has suggested the timing and tone of the ads indicate they were placed in support of Mitt Romney's campaign.|$|E
6000|$|He {{looked into}} your room {{to see what}} was the matter. He {{discovered}} you with the candle in your hand, just leaving your bed-chamber. He heard <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>yourself,</b> in a voice quite unlike your own voice, [...] "How do I know? The Indians may be hidden in the house." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For my own sake!" [...] she {{repeated}} scornfully. [...] "Do {{you believe it}} yourself? Do {{you really think that}} it is true? I will tell you why it is! It is because you have no thought, no imagination. <b>You</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>yourself,</b> she is not of my world. I cannot marry her." ...|$|E
6000|$|Oh yes! I can fancy you {{grinning}} over my letter--I {{can hear}} <b>you</b> <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> <b>yourself,</b> [...] "Where did he {{pick up his}} experience, I wonder?" [...] I have no experience--I only have something that serves me instead of it, and I don't know what. The Elder Brother, at Tadmor, used <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it was sympathy. But he is a sentimentalist.|$|R
6000|$|... 'In {{the way of}} business, as a {{composer}} only; and <b>you</b> must <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>yourself,</b> [...] "Ethelberta, as thou art but woman, I dare; but as widow I fear thee."' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I mean," [...] said Béla, with {{a return}} to his former swagger, [...] "that <b>you</b> have been <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> <b>yourself</b> this past half-hour: 'Oho! but Elsa is not married yet! The vows are not yet spoken, and until they are I still have my chance.' That's what <b>you</b> have been <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> <b>yourself,</b> eh, Mr. Guardian Angel?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Their faith puts faith into you. If {{they believe}} what you say, <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>yourself</b> {{that there must be}} some truth in it. If you keep telling them you're Jesus Christ, there's nothing to prove you ain't, and if you tell them you're God, who ever saw God, and who can deny it? You can't deny it yourself--" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{toothache}} cannot hurt us {{so long as}} the daemon {{within us}} (that is to say, our will power) holds on to the chair and says it can't. But, sooner or later, the daemon lets go, and then we howl. One sees the idea: in theory it is excellent. One makes believe. Your bank has suddenly stopped payment. <b>You</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>yourself.</b>|$|E
60|$|My ever dear Friend,--I must {{write to}} you, {{although}} it is so very long, or at least seems so, since you wrote to me. But you say to Arabel in speaking of me that I 'used to care for what is poetical;' therefore, perhaps <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>yourself</b> sometimes that I used to care for you! I am anxious to vindicate my identity to you, in that respect above all.|$|E
5000|$|He {{would then}} say, [...] "I {{know exactly what}} <b>you</b> are <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> <b>yourself,</b> you’re wrong, I know what you’re <b>saying.</b> <b>You</b> wicked lot. You’re the sort of people that get me a bad name!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Confounded heavy things!" [...] <b>you</b> will <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>yourself.</b> [...] "Thank {{goodness}} I've {{got rid of}} them. Let {{him have}} the fun of dragging them about these ghastly roads. See how he likes the job!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you think}} me hard and cruel? Wait a little, and time will change {{that way of}} thinking. As the years go on <b>you</b> will <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>yourself,</b> 'Basely as he deceived me, there was some {{generosity}} in him. He was man enough to release me of his own free will.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, my old granny, I see you start, {{and make}} that {{favourite}} mark with your thumb-nail under the word 'consolation'! I hear <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>yourself,</b> 'Is she unhappy in her English home? And is Aunt Gallilee to blame for it?' Yes! it is even so. What I would not {{for the whole world}} write to Ovid, I may confess to you. Aunt Gallilee is indeed a hard, hard woman.|$|E
6000|$|... 'The disreputable lingo of Cockayne is {{henceforth}} justified {{before the}} world; {{for a man}} of genius has taken it in hand, and has shown, beyond all cavilling, that in its way it also is a medium for literature. You are grateful, and <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>yourself,</b> half in envy and half in admiration: [...] "Here is a book; here, or one is a Dutchman, is one of the books of the year." [...] '--National Observer.|$|E
60|$|In youth {{you tend}} to look rather {{frequently}} into a mirror, not at all necessarily from vanity. <b>You</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>yourself,</b> 'What an interesting face; I wonder what he is to be up to?' Your elders do not look into the mirror so often. We know what he has been up to. As yet there is unfortunately no science of reading other people's faces; I think a chair for this should be founded in St. Andrews.|$|E
6000|$|Har. Now, captain Towerson, {{you have}} had the {{privilege}} to be examined last; this on the score of my old friendship with you, though you have ill deserved it. But here you stand accused of no less crimes than robbery first, then murder, and last, treason: What can <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> clear <b>yourself?</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Lady Lydiard, [...] "now you are here, {{what have}} <b>you</b> got <b>to</b> <b>say</b> for <b>yourself?</b> <b>You</b> have been abroad, of course! Where?" ...|$|R
40|$|Do <b>you</b> ever <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>yourself,</b> 2 ̆ 2 What shall I give Mary for Christmas? I want {{something}} nice, yet {{it must be}} inexpensive. 2 ̆ 2 Some {{women who have had}} this problem have answered it with hand tooled leather articles. It sounds expensive, but it isn 2 ̆ 7 t, for they make the articles and do the tooling themselves...|$|R
6000|$|Have {{you ever}} been turned down by a girl who {{afterwards}} married and then been introduced to her husband? If so you'll understand how I felt when Clarence burst on me. You know the feeling. First of all, when {{you hear about the}} marriage, <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>yourself,</b> [...] "I wonder what he's like." [...] Then you meet him, and think, [...] "There must be some mistake. She can't have preferred this to me!" [...] That's what I thought, when I set eyes on Clarence.|$|E
60|$|But, {{if you are}} a brave man, as I {{trust you}} all are, a higher spirit than your own speaks to your spirit, and makes <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>yourself,</b> I dare not run away; but, more, I cannot run away. I should like to--but I cannot do the things that I would. It is my duty to go on; it is right; it is a point of honour with me to my country, my regiment, my Queen, my God, and I must go on.|$|E
60|$|By {{this time}} you feel {{completely}} crushed. You bury your face in your hands and think {{you would like to}} die and go to heaven. You picture to yourself your own sick-bed, with all your friends and relations standing round you weeping. You bless them all, especially the young and pretty ones. They will value you when you are gone, so <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>yourself,</b> and learn too late what they have lost; and you bitterly contrast their presumed regard for you then with their decided want of veneration now.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Hold your din,' cried Sikes, {{as the dog}} retreated {{under the}} bed: still {{growling}} angrily. 'What have <b>you</b> got <b>to</b> <b>say</b> for <b>yourself,</b> <b>you</b> withered old fence, eh?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Watchman!' he ses, in a stuck-up voice, 'wot {{does this}} mean? Laura Lamb! wot 'ave <b>you</b> got <b>to</b> <b>say</b> for <b>yourself?</b> Where 'ave you been all the evening?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because I knew <b>you</b> were <b>saying</b> that <b>to</b> <b>yourself,</b> lad, {{so there}} was no need for me <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it," [...] {{returned}} his friend, with a side-glance and a twinkle of the eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{easy enough}} to stop if you will but use a little resolution. <b>You</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>yourself,</b> 'Just one won't hurt me!' Perhaps not. But can you be content with just one? Ah! No, my man, there is no middle way for such as you. It must be all or nothing. Stop it now--now, while you still retain some semblance of humanity. Soon {{it will be too}} late! Kill that craving! Stifle it! Strangle it! Make up your mind now--now, that not another drop of the accursed stuff shall pass your lips... ." ...|$|E
60|$|Of course I {{suffered}} some surprises, {{along at}} first, before I had become {{adjusted to the}} changed state of things. I met young ladies who {{did not seem to}} have changed at all; but {{they turned out to be}} the daughters of the young ladies I had in mind--sometimes their grand-daughters. When you are told that a stranger of fifty is a grandmother, there is nothing surprising about it; but if, on the contrary, she is a person whom you knew as a little girl, it seems impossible. <b>You</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>yourself,</b> 'How can a little girl be a grandmother.' It takes some little time to accept and realize the fact that while you have been growing old, your friends have not been standing still, in that matter.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, we'll {{suppose you}} take it. You {{go back to}} Rock, {{there is very little}} {{business}} for the railroad, but your salary comes in regularly. <b>You</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>yourself</b> that, in case any work comes in which is dishonorable, you'll refuse to take hold of it. But that money comes in nicely. You marry on the expectations of its continuance. You get to depending upon it. You live up to it. You don't find anything which they demand of you really dishonest, and you keep on; but really cases of the railroad against the people do come up, and your sense of justice isn't so acute as it used to be. You manage to argue yourself into doing it. If you don't do it, somebody else will, etc., and so you keep on." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{must say}} this for Pierre, {{that when he}} starts out to {{convince}} you of a matter there is in his manner and his voice such winning qualities, that even though at the outset you were positive {{he was in the}} wrong, before many minutes had passed <b>you</b> were <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> <b>yourself</b> that all his words were true, all his beliefs noble, and all that he would do exactly right.|$|R
6000|$|Gril. I'll be your customer, and {{set you up}} {{a little}} better, sirrah;--go, hang him at the next sign-post:--What have <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> for <b>yourself,</b> scoundrel? why were you a rebel? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know it," [...] she replied, [...] "and I suppose <b>you</b> are <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> <b>yourself,</b> 'Here is a {{girl who}} has known me less than three days, and yet she asks me {{to tell her about}} my feeling towards another woman.' But, really, {{it seems to me that}} as you have not known that other woman three days, as much {{friendship}} and confidence might spring up in the one case as affection in the other." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Just as I had hoped,' he said. 'Your very justifiable anger melts before reflection. The storm subsides, {{and you are}} at leisure {{to examine}} the matter dispassionately. Doubts begin to creep in. Possibly, <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>yourself,</b> I have been too hasty, too harsh. Justice must be {{tempered}} with mercy. I have caught Comrade Jackson bending, you add (still to yourself), but shall I press home my advantage too ruthlessly? No, you cry, I will abstain. And I applaud your action. I {{like to see this}} spirit of gentle toleration. It is bracing and comforting. As for these excellent speeches,' he added, 'I shall, of course, no longer have any need of their consolation. I can lay them aside. The sunlight can now enter and illumine my life through more ordinary channels. The cry goes round, [...] "Psmith is himself again."' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are wonderful!" [...] the Prince declared. [...] "You are, indeed! I {{know what}} is in your mind. You have said to yourself, 'Between these two murders there is some connection. They were both done by {{the hand of a}} master criminal. The victims in both cases were Americans.' You said to yourself, 'First of all, I will {{discover}} the motive; then, perhaps, a clue which seems to belong to the one will lead me to the other, or both?' You are not sure which way to turn. There is nothing there upon which you can lay your hand. <b>You</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>yourself,</b> 'I will make a bluff.' That is the word, is it not? You come to me. You tell me gravely that you have reason to suspect some one in my household. That is because you believe that the crimes were perpetrated by some one of my country. You do not ask for information. You think, perhaps, that I would not give it. You confront me with a statement. It was very clever of you, Mr. Inspector Jacks." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{will not}} play at cheap diplomacy," [...] he said, sneeringly. [...] "I know you {{by a dozen}} names, which you alter and adopt to suit the occasion. You are a {{creature}} of the French police, one of those parasitical creatures who live by sucking the honesty out of simpler persons. You are here because the more private meetings of the English Council of Defence are being held at Rowchester. It is your object by bribery, or theft, or robbery, or the seductive use of those wonderful charms of yours, to gain possession of copies of any particulars whatever about the English autumn manoeuvres, which, curiously enough, have been arranged as a sort of addendum to those on your side of the Channel. You have an ally, I regret to say, in the Duke's son, you are seeking to gain for yourself a far more valuable one in the person of this boy. <b>You</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>yourself,</b> no doubt, Like father, like son. You ruined and disgraced the one. You think, perhaps, the other will be as easy." ...|$|E
6000|$|THE CLERK. Prisoner at the bar, {{you stand}} convicted of felony. Have <b>you</b> {{anything}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> for <b>yourself,</b> why the Court should {{not give you}} judgment according to law? [FALDER shakes his head] ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now then!" [...] ses my missus, who {{was leaning}} {{up against the}} dresser with ’er arms folded, [...] "wot ’ave <b>you</b> got <b>to</b> <b>say</b> for <b>yourself</b> walking in as bold as brass with this hussy?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Papa is a {{preferable}} mode of address,' observed Mrs General. 'Father {{is rather}} vulgar, my dear. The word Papa, besides, gives a pretty {{form to the}} lips. Papa, potatoes, poultry, prunes, and prism are all very good words for the lips: especially prunes and prism. You will find it serviceable, {{in the formation of}} a demeanour, if <b>you</b> sometimes <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>yourself</b> in company--on entering a room, for instance--Papa, potatoes, poultry, prunes and prism, prunes and prism.' ...|$|R
