5|$|Malaria {{has several}} serious complications. Among {{these is the}} {{development}} of respiratory distress, which occurs in up to 25% of adults and 40% of children with severe P.falciparum malaria. Possible causes include respiratory compensation of metabolic acidosis, noncardiogenic pulmonary oedema, concomitant pneumonia, and severe anaemia. Although rare in <b>young</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> severe malaria, acute respiratory distress syndrome occurs in 5–25% of adults and up to 29% of pregnant women. Coinfection of HIV with malaria increases mortality. Renal failure is a feature of blackwater fever, where hemoglobin from lysed red blood cells leaks into the urine.|$|E

5|$|Other {{complications}} include encephalitis (1 in 500 patients), {{which is}} more common in adults and may cause temporary disability; permanent pitted scars, most notably on the face; and complications involving the eyes (2 percent of all cases). Pustules can form on the eyelid, conjunctiva, and cornea, leading to complications such as conjunctivitis, keratitis, corneal ulcer, iritis, iridocyclitis, and optic atrophy. Blindness results in approximately 35 percent to 40 percent of eyes affected with keratitis and corneal ulcer. Hemorrhagic smallpox can cause subconjunctival and retinal hemorrhages. In 2 to 5 percent of <b>young</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> smallpox, virions reach the joints and bone, causing osteomyelitis variolosa. Lesions are symmetrical, most common in the elbows, tibia, and fibula, and characteristically cause separation of an epiphysis and marked periosteal reactions. Swollen joints limit movement, and arthritis may lead to limb deformities, ankylosis, malformed bones, flail joints, and stubby fingers.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the prevalence of}} emotional and behavioral problems and the social competencies of forty <b>children</b> <b>with</b> cancer immediately after their diagnosis and one year post-diagnosis. Patients and Methods: At both points of time the problems and competencies of the <b>children</b> <b>with</b> cancer were compared with the problems and competencies of a matched group of children living in the community. Results: The results suggest that early in their illnesses, <b>younger</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> cancer experience more internalising problems than children in the community. However, the <b>younger</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> cancer improved significantly in these areas during the year after their diagnosis. As a result, one year after their diagnosis there was little difference in the prevalence of problems amongst the <b>younger</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> cancer and {{the children in the}} community. The older <b>children</b> <b>with</b> cancer did not appear to have more problems than children in the community at either the first or the second assessment. Conclusions: The results of the study draw attention to possible differences in the-prevalence of emotional and behavioral problems experienced by <b>younger</b> and older <b>children</b> <b>with</b> cancer. The results also suggest that amongst <b>younger</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> cancer the prevalence of problems declines during the year after their initial diagnoses. M. G. Sawyer, G.

25|$|Breastfeeding, {{also known}} as nursing, is the feeding of babies and <b>young</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> milk from a woman's breast. Breastfeeding {{decreases}} the risk of respiratory tract infections and diarrhea, both in developing and developed countries. Other benefits include lower risks of asthma, food allergies, celiac disease, type 1 diabetes, and leukemia. Breastfeeding may also improve cognitive development and decrease the risk of obesity in adulthood. Mothers may feel pressure to breastfeed, but {{in the developed world}} children generally grow up normally when bottle fed.|$|E
25|$|There {{were very}} few {{examples}} of bones showing signs of healing from trauma {{and none of the}} bones showed any evidence that there was warfare in the society. A few of the healed fractures imply that long-term care was given to individuals who were injured. Very few bones showed any signs of inflammatory bone changes. However, over half of the juveniles crania (skulls) showed evidence of anemia (iron deficiency). This was represented by what is known as cribra orbitalia. This implies that the society had many <b>young</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> chronic illness before their death.|$|E

25|$|Psychopathy is a {{personality}} disorder which has symptoms expressed {{over a wide}} range of settings. Socially, it expresses extensive callous and manipulative self-serving behaviors with no regard for others, and often is associated with repeated delinquency, crime and violence, but may also present itself in other, maybe even successful social settings. Mentally, impairments in processes related to affect (emotion) and cognition, particularly socially related mental processes, have been found in those with the disorder which suggest that their destructive social behavior is borne from these aberrant mental processes. Developmentally, symptoms of psychopathy have been identified in <b>young</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> conduct disorder, and is suggestive of at least a partial constitutional factor that influences its development.|$|E
