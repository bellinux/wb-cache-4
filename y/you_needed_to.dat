It {{was meant to}} be a {{workshop}} for his advanced students who wanted to experiment with all aspects of design. Brodovitch shared the Bauhaus belief that <b>you</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> educate the whole individual by directing his or her attention to a variety of modern solutions in their graphic projects. His course description for the Design Laboratory read: The aim of the course is to help the student to discover his individuality, crystallize his taste, and develop his feeling for the contemporary trend by stimulating his sense of invention and perfecting his technical ability. The course is conducted as an experimental laboratory, inspired by the ever-changing tempo of life, discovery of new techniques, new fields of operation...in close contact with current problems of leading magazines, department stores, advertising agencies and manufactures. Subjects include design, layout, type, poster, reportage, illustration, magazine make-up, package and product design, display, styling, art directing.|$|E
500|$|Shivnarine Chanderpaul is an {{international}} cricketer who has played for the West Indies since 1994, and captained the team for a short time. He has scored centuries (100 or more runs in a single innings) on 30 occasions in Test cricket and 11 times in One Day International (ODI) matches. He is West Indies' second-most prolific batsman in international cricket, after Brian Lara, having accumulated almost 20,000 runs. He bats with an unorthodox technique, which {{is often described as}} [...] "crab-like", and is highly regarded for his [...] "patience and obstinacy at the crease." [...] In his list of the 100 greatest Test players, Shane Warne described Chanderpaul as [...] "a bloke <b>you</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> crowbar away from the crease." [...] In 2008 he was named as one of the five Cricketers of the Year by the Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, and as the Player of the Year by the International Cricket Council.|$|E

500|$|Cliff Fletcher, who drafted {{him into}} the NHL, {{described}} Nieuwendyk as being a [...] "pre-eminent two-way guy who had 50-goal seasons", adding that [...] "{{he had a great}} stick around the net, he had a great shot, he saw the ice well, he could skate, he had the size – he had everything <b>you</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> have. History has indicated that wherever he went, the team was competitive. The more that was on the line in big games, the better Joe played." [...] He was an offensive centre in Calgary and power play specialist, able to withstand the physical punishment required {{to stand in front of}} the net and battle defencemen for the puck. He led the NHL in power play goals in 1987–88 with 31 and finished in the top ten on four other occasions. [...] Wayne Gretzky, who also played box lacrosse in his youth, argued that the skills Nieuwendyk learned dodging opposing players in that sport aided his development as a hockey player. Nieuwendyk was regarded as a top faceoff man, a skill that Team Canada relied on during the Olympics. He was a checking-line centre at the 2002 Olympics, relied on for his defensive and faceoff abilities.|$|E
500|$|Other reviewers {{praised the}} character's {{gameplay}} and design. An {{editor for the}} video game website GameZone wrote that his attacks compensated for his appearance and described him as [...] "cool", while also praising both his weapon and fighting style. Adam Sessler and Morgan Webb of X-Play stated that, while Necrid {{did not seem to}} fit the aesthetic, the character did have some appeal. UGO's Doug Trueman stated Necrid's weapon had to be [...] "seen to be believed", and described him among other new characters as [...] " [...] something spectacular to the Soul Calibur pantheon". Tim Rogers of website Insert Credit called Necrid [...] "a work of digital art both in form and function" [...] and added that [...] "as far as console-only characters go—everybody wins with Necrid". Despite their negative remarks, an editor for IGN listed Necrid as eighth on their list of the top ten characters contributed to the Soulcalibur games by designers outside Namco and wrote that while they felt the character's gameplay was unbalanced, it added to Necrid's appeal; the editor wrote [...] "what do you expect from a man who shares a symbiotic relationship with the very energy that powers Soul Edge?

[...] "As a project it came together with Cate Blanchett. <b>You</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> always start with her role". Film4 Productions and Tessa Ross financed the development of the film and kept it alive throughout the years, as it [...] "underwent a decade-plus of revision under various directors and investors" [...] − including Hettie MacDonald, Kenneth Branagh, Kimberly Peirce, John Maybury, and Stephen Frears − until the project completely stalled. The long trek was a result of the struggles and roadblocks experienced with funding, rights, and trepidations about a film with a gay theme and two female leads. [...] "During its development, there was a very different kind of lesbian or gay movie that got financed", Nagy said. [...] "They were very agenda or issue driven, and this was not. In fact it insists on not being that in order to make the point. I would talk about that with financiers, and I could see them glaze over." ...|$|E

It was from Kanhai that Chanderpaul took his nickname, [...] "Tiger". He maintained this style during the early part of his international career, but as the batting of the West Indies side around him grew weaker, he developed a more defensive style of play, and turned himself into what ESPNcricinfo's Vaneisa Baksh described as [...] "the anchor of the team, the solid man."

[...] Presley's girlfriend June Juanico complained the singer was always talking about his friend Adams and James Dean. She also was upset that Adams had started inviting himself to see Elvis, and Juanico felt that she was trying to compete for Elvis' attention. Adams would talk often about Natalie Wood to Elvis, constantly discussing her figure and her beauty, something else that caused Juanico to feel that she would soon lose Elvis to the glitz of Hollywood.

After all, Ginger Rogers did everything that Fred Astaire did. She just did it backwards and in high heels." [...] and [...] "When we pay billions for planes that won't fly, billions for tanks that won't fire, and billions for systems that won't work, that old dog won't hunt. And you don't have to be from Waco to know that when the Pentagon makes crooks rich and doesn't make America strong, that it's a bum deal."

Of course I do not mean that you could see the silence--no, you could only hear it. The sidewalks were merely long, deep ditches, with steep snow walls on either side. Here and there you might hear the faint, far scrape of a wooden shovel, and if you were quick enough you might catch a glimpse of a distant black figure stooping and disappearing in one of those ditches, and reappearing the next moment with a motion which you would know meant the heaving out of a shovelful of snow. But <b>you</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> be quick, for that black figure would not linger, but would soon drop that shovel and scud for the house, thrashing itself with its arms to warm them.
