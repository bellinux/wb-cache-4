40|$|A {{replicated}} {{field study}} was conducted from 1972 to 1980 involving soybeans grown in 2 -, 3 -, and 4 -year rotations with maize in soil infested with Meloidogyne incognita. Monocultured soybeans were maintained as controls. Cropping regimes involved root-knot nematode susceptible and resistant soybean cultivars and soybeans treated and not treated with nematicides. <b>Yields</b> <b>of</b> susceptible cultivars declined with reduced length of rotation. Nematicide treatment significantly increased <b>yields</b> <b>of</b> susceptible cultivars when monocultured, but bad little influence on yield when susceptible cultivars were grown in rotation. <b>Yields</b> <b>of</b> monocultured resistant cultivars were significantly lower than <b>yields</b> <b>of</b> resistant cultivars grown in rotation.

40|$|An {{examination}} {{of the effects of}} credit quality on the relative <b>yields</b> <b>of</b> Treasuries and municipals reveals that the municipal term structure model with no default risk underestimates equilibrium marginal income tax rates and <b>yields</b> <b>of</b> municipals relative to <b>yields</b> <b>of</b> Treasuries. The downward bias is more severe for long-maturity and low-rated bonds. Incorporating default risk into the municipal term structure model helps explain a considerable portion <b>of</b> the relative <b>yields</b> <b>of</b> tax-exempt and taxable bonds, and generates much more accurate estimates of implicit marginal income tax rates.

5|$|When {{experimental}} work wound down, Agnew {{was transferred to}} Project Alberta, working as part of Luis W.

In June 1945, he was issued with an Army uniform and dog tags at Wendover Army Air Field, Utah, and was flown to Tinian in the Western Pacific in a C-54 of the 509th Composite Group.

5|$|Bismuth is {{also used}} in aluminium-silicon cast alloys in order to refine silicon morphology. However, it {{indicated}} a poisoning effect on modification of strontium (Sr).

Addition of bismuth to caesium enhances the quantum <b>yield</b> <b>of</b> caesium cathodes. Sintering of bismuth and manganese powders at 300°C produces a permanent magnet and magnetostrictive material, which is used in ultrasonic generators and receivers working in the 10–100kHz range and in magnetic memory devices.|$|E
