500|$|When he said Jesus again I couldn't take it, and for {{the only}} time in my life I was discourteous, which I regret to this day. I said, [...] "Mr. Mauriac," [...] we called him Maître, [...] "ten years or so ago, I have seen children, {{hundreds}} of Jewish children, who suffered more than Jesus did on his cross and we do not speak about it." [...] I felt all of a sudden so embarrassed. I closed my notebook and went to the elevator. He ran after me. He pulled me back; he sat down in his chair, and I in mine, and he began weeping.... And then, at the end, without saying anything, he simply said, [...] "You know, maybe <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>talk</b> about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your arrows fall terribly astray there, Miss Dale, for I {{never touch}} a cue; <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>talk</b> to your cousin about billiards." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't think <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>talk</b> to Mr. Allinson in that manner, Jim. He's a {{good deal}} older and more {{experienced}} than you are." ...|$|E
60|$|CHAR. But <b>you</b> <b>should</b> have <b>talked</b> to them, and {{endeavored}} to have shown them {{the danger of}} staying behind.|$|R
6000|$|... "In {{such matters}} <b>you</b> <b>should</b> never <b>talk</b> to any one, Mr. Finn. If you cannot fight your own battle, {{no one can}} fight it for you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Peterkin, <b>you</b> <b>should</b> not <b>talk</b> lightly of {{so narrow}} an escape," [...] said I reproachfully. [...] "The {{fact that such}} a terrible {{catastrophe}} has nearly occurred ought to solemnise one." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Evil talk, Baas. Rather {{let us go}} {{away and}} wait {{no more than that}} <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>talk</b> such talk, which is the {{beginning}} of death." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know why}} <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>talk</b> like that, as I think that I have given good proof that I am no believer in vaccination." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Alas! Master Christie," [...] {{said the}} matron, [...] "that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>talk</b> to a lone woman {{in such a}} fashion, and death in the house besides!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, everything. That <b>you</b> <b>should</b> be <b>talking</b> as <b>you</b> are--that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> have 'watched life,' as you say, to such purpose. That {{we should}} {{any of us}} be here--most of all that Mr. Mitchett himself should. That your grandmother's {{daughter}} should have brought HER daughter--" ...|$|R
60|$|MRS GEORGE [admiring his eloquence] George {{will like}} <b>you,</b> Sonny. <b>You</b> <b>should</b> hear him <b>talking</b> about the Church.|$|R
6000|$|... "How can {{you talk}} such stuff, Mrs. Baker? You have never known {{anything}} of the kind--and even if he had, how could you know it? <b>You</b> <b>should</b> not <b>talk</b> such nonsense to me, and I beg you won't again." [...] Then she went away, {{and began to read}} a paper about sick people written by Florence Nightingale.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I assure you, my good Rebecca, my {{character}} {{and your own}} age and appearance are your security, if <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>talk</b> as loosely as an amatory poet.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is strange," [...] he said, [...] "that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>talk</b> like this. You {{have the}} world at your feet, Mademoiselle. You have only to throw the handkerchief." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'How can I tell? But {{the absurdity}} {{is that such}} a man as <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>talk</b> {{about the end of}} anything. Did you ever look before you leaped in your life?' ...|$|E
40|$|No, not the Chinese boardgame, the {{programming}} language that ironically Google made difficult to google for. You {{may have heard}} of Golang, and are wondering whether <b>you</b> <b>should</b> learn it. The answer is that of course <b>you</b> <b>should,</b> and this <b>talk</b> <b>should</b> explain why and point you at the best resources to get started...|$|R
6000|$|... "Poor Cherry! <b>you</b> <b>should</b> {{hear her}} <b>talk</b> of him! And {{she would have}} stayed ever so much longer if I had not pressed her to go; and then she has such a nice way of saying things." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Circumstances will. Time will do it. Employment will do it. A {{sense of}} your dignity {{as a man}} will do it, when you find {{yourself}} amongst others who know nothing {{of what you have}} suffered. You revel in your grief now because those around you know that you have failed. All that will be changed when you are with strangers. <b>You</b> <b>should</b> not <b>talk</b> to your father of drowning yourself!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He thinks {{nothing of}} me," [...] I said, {{ignoring}} her suggestion, [...] "except {{as an old}} school-fellow and friend; and I really am surprised, Ada, that ever <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>talk</b> such nonsense." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is curious}} that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>talk</b> like that," [...] I said uneasily. [...] "I {{thought that you}} had made up your mind that the whole {{business}} was either illusion or trickery--I mean, the odd side of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is strange," [...] she said, [...] "that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>talk</b> {{to me like}} this, you who are {{certainly}} responsible for any estrangement there may be between Mr. Mannering and myself. Please answer me this question. Why do you wish us to be friends?" ...|$|E
40|$|Growing an orchard {{can give}} immense {{satisfaction}} — especially when consuming the ripened end product. It {{can also be}} a complex and expensive operation which is only marginally profitable when producing on a small scale. Before setting up or investing in a small orchard {{there are a number of}} factors <b>you</b> <b>should</b> consider. <b>Talk</b> to neighbours with similar businesses and assess if there are any limiting factors to growing fruit in the area...|$|R
50|$|Nely Galán {{chose to}} meet with the clients who were to judge this {{commercial}} {{in order to get a}} more effective message while Gene Simmons did not, believing that time was of the essence. Trump has commented in previous seasons that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> always <b>talk</b> to the clients so you really understand what you are looking for, but in an ironic twist, Hydra was the team that won the task (despite not seeing the client).|$|R
6000|$|... “The Colonel Morales sends for you,” he said, {{and though}} there was {{apparently}} nobody within hearing dropped his voice a little. “If he asks you questions let him wait for your answer. It is necessary that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> keep him <b>talking</b> at least ten minutes.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly," [...] {{the girl}} resolutely answered. [...] "I don't see why <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>talk</b> {{as if one}} had a petty mind. You don't think so. It's not on that {{assumption}} you've ever dealt with me. I can do your son justice, as he put his case to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The lady Eve will fare neither better nor {{worse for}} your knowing about her, but one with whom <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>talk</b> may fare further, for doubtless his spies are out. But have your way {{and leave me}} to thank God that no woman ever found a chance to clog my leg, perhaps because I was not born an ass." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, never more. No, never, never more. If <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>talk</b> {{with old}} Mr Chuzzlewit, at any time,' she added, looking hurriedly into his face--'I {{sometimes}} thought he liked you, but suppressed it--will you promise {{me to tell}} him that you saw me here, and that I said I bore in mind the time we talked together in the churchyard?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hirst? Oh, he's one {{of these}} learned chaps," [...] said Arthur indifferently. [...] "He don't {{look as if he}} enjoyed it. <b>You</b> <b>should</b> hear him <b>talking</b> to Elliot. It's as much as I can do to follow 'em at all. [...] . I was never good at my books." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's funny <b>you</b> <b>should</b> {{have been}} <b>talking</b> about Ogden getting kidnapped. This story of aunt Nesta's {{is all about}} an angel-child--I suppose it's meant to be Ogden--being stolen and hidden and all that. It's odd that she should write stories like this. You wouldn't expect it of her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The flesh?" [...] He laughed. [...] "In {{this land}} the flesh takes second place--except, perhaps, in the cities." [...] He {{turned and looked}} at her curiously. [...] "Why <b>should</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> of shrinking? The bush couldn't daunt you; you have courage." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My Lord Count," [...] said Durward, {{unable to}} keep silence any longer, [...] "lest <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>talk</b> of a {{stranger}} in slighter terms than you might afterwards think becoming, I take leave to tell you, that I am Quentin Durward, an Archer of the Scottish Bodyguard, in which, as you well know, none but gentlemen and men of honour are enrolled." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no! It was for all time. Why should dreams be so very misleading? I think there's ever {{so much in}} dreams. The most {{wonderful}} thing {{is the way you}} make people talk in dreams. It isn't strange that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>talk</b> yourself, but that other people should say this and that when you aren't at all expecting what they say." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is one thing, fair sir," [...] {{said the}} Cambridge student in his piping voice, [...] "which I would fain {{that you would}} make more clear. As I {{understand}} it, there was peace made at the town of Bretigny some six years back between our most gracious monarch and the King of the French. This being so, it seems most passing strange that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>talk</b> so loudly of war and of companies {{when there is no}} quarrel between the French and us." ...|$|E
5000|$|... “… He {{looked at}} his clock {{and shook his head}} pensively. No, dear sir, no, you are wiring about that. It {{has nothing to do with}} the bombs. <b>You</b> <b>should</b> not keep <b>talking</b> about the bombs. No. At 2:30. At night I mean. Nearly always at 2:30. That is just it…” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You and I, Abel, {{are just}} of an age. Why <b>should</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> {{to me like}} this? You are strong enough, {{whatever}} I am. Why shouldn't you come? Dresden! I never {{heard of such a}} thing. I suppose it's some nonsense of Emily's." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The flesh?" [...] he {{said and}} laughed. [...] "In this land it takes second place--except, perhaps, in the cities." [...] Then {{he turned and looked}} at her curiously. [...] "Why <b>should</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> of shrinking? The bush couldn't daunt you; you have courage." ...|$|R
