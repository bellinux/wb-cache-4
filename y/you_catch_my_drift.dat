6000|$|... "Dull and goody?" [...] put in Carey. [...] "No, no, my dear, {{that would}} be utterly futile. <b>You</b> can't <b>catch</b> <b>my</b> birds without salt. Can we, Polly?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'd like {{my girls}} {{to get into}} the best--the most select--circles," [...] he announced. [...] "They're good and pretty and well-mannered, so it strikes me they're {{entitled}} to the best there is a-going. I don't want to mix with your swell crowd myself, because I ain't fit; likewise the outfit ain't much to my taste, askin' your pardon; but with women it's different. They need to stand high an' shine bright to make 'em really happy, and if any special lot is particularly ex-clusive an' high-falutin', that's the crowd they long to swarm with. It's human nature--female human nature, anyhow. <b>You</b> <b>catch</b> <b>my</b> idea, Von Taer, don't you?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Twight is the {{technical}} director of Mountain Mobility Group, LLC, which provides [...] "cold weather, high altitude, and fitness training, {{as well as}} R&D for the Department of Defense." [...] He was hired as the subject matter expert during {{the development of the}} Protective Combat Uniform (PCU) currently issued to special operations personnel. Gym Jones' relationship to the military is largely absent on their website, though in the August 2009 issue of Muscle and Fitness Dan John quipped that, [...] "There are people in there who officially don't exist, if <b>you</b> <b>catch</b> <b>my</b> meaning, but <b>you</b> sleep better because they do ... It's a whole different world when you're training with folks whose lives are on the line." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I fear <b>you</b> do not <b>catch</b> <b>my</b> meaning," [...] {{returned}} Mr. Lavender, whose {{whole body}} was aching from his fall; [...] "it is my public life which tries me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Shinny on {{your own}} side!" [...] said the man with glasses. [...] "You never heard any such music from my foghorn. What I said was that I did not believe it {{practicable}} just now. The guys with wads {{are not in the}} frame of mind to slack up on the mazuma, and the man with the portable tin banqueting canister isn't exactly ready to join the Bible class. You can bet your variegated socks that the situation is all spifflicated up from the Battery to breakfast! What the country needs is for some bully old bloke like Cobden or some wise guy like old Ben Franklin to sashay up to the front and biff the nigger's head with the baseball. Do <b>you</b> <b>catch</b> <b>my</b> smoke? What?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "David, my boy," [...] he said, [...] "how {{could you}} for a moment doubt my love for you? There is {{something}} strange here that I cannot understand. I know that I am not mad, and I am equally sure that you are not; but how in the world are we to account for the strange hallucinations that each of us seems to harbor relative to the passage of time since last we saw each other. You are positive that months have gone by, while to me it seems equally certain that not more than an hour ago I sat beside you in the amphitheater. Can it be that both of us are right {{and at the same time}} both are wrong? First tell me what time is, and then maybe I can solve our problem. Do <b>you</b> <b>catch</b> <b>my</b> meaning?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't let me <b>catch</b> <b>you</b> around <b>my</b> wood-pile, that's all," [...] he threatened. [...] "My wood-pile is my castle, and you've got to {{understand}} that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Agreed," [...] said Ives. [...] "I'm glad <b>you</b> <b>catch</b> <b>my</b> idea. It will {{increase}} the animosity of the house toward the loser. If it does not weary you, we will pursue the theme. Only a few times have I met a true venturer--one who does not ask a schedule and map from Fate when he begins a journey. But, as the world becomes more civilized and wiser, {{the more difficult it}} is to come upon an adventure the end of which you cannot foresee. In the Elizabethan days you could assault the watch, wring knockers from doors and have a jolly set-to with the blades in any convenient angle of a wall and 'get away with it.' Nowadays, if you speak disrespectfully to a policeman, all that is left to the most romantic fancy is to conjecture in what particular police station he will land you." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{poor girl}} laughed hoarsely. [...] "Oh! I hoped it," [...] she said. [...] "I am glad, I am glad, for now I shall die {{and go to}} join him. But I wish that I had caught it before," [...] she rambled on to herself, [...] "for then I would have taken it to him in prison and they couldn't have treated him as they did." [...] Suddenly she seemed to come to herself, for she added, [...] "Go away, Vrouw van Goorl, go quickly or <b>you</b> may <b>catch</b> <b>my</b> sickness." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{must see}} such a lot of people, and {{the way things are}} {{arranged}} and settled here everybody expects to look and act like everybody else, don't you know, so you can't tell one chap from another. Deuced annoying, eh? That's where you Americans are different, and that's why those countrywomen of yours were so charming, don't you know, so original. We were all together {{on the top of a}} coach in Scotland, don't you remember? Had such a jolly time in the beastly rain. <b>You</b> didn't <b>catch</b> <b>my</b> name. It's Duncaster." ...|$|R
5000|$|... 1-3 God, my shepherd! I don’t need a thing.You have bedded me down in lush meadows, {{you find}} me quiet pools to drink from.True to your word, <b>you</b> let me <b>catch</b> <b>my</b> breath and send me in the right direction.4 Even when the way goes through Death Valley,I’m not afraid when you walk at my side.Your trusty shepherd’s crook makes me feel secure.|$|R
5000|$|And no surprise, then, {{that the}} album title-track, which only remains on a lost, {{forgotten}} B side, {{did not make}} it onto the album (a well-established tradition for the British band, but as for the first two albums, those title-tracks are now largely available, but not our last sad lyric-title), nor in the songbook, needless to say, as [...] "Time" [...] has. Just because the [...] "From Luxury to Heartache" [...] lyric contained the possibility of a return trip, a journey in reverse - to hell and back, as many people love to say, and sing - a travel back to some yet unidentified person who could catch the poor sinner's fall (so the lyrics suggested, asking: 'If I cry will <b>you</b> <b>catch</b> <b>my</b> fall? Am I playing the loser's game?'). Whereas things were pretty clear with [...] "Time" [...] lyrics: 'Time won't give me time, and time makes lovers feel like they've got something real, but you and me we know they've got nothing but time'. The fairytale is finished. That's why Culture Club will stay silent for 13 years. Because when the Club is back, its members won't be able to say anything but: Don't Mind If I Do (the title of the fifth album, the comeback work). Just because they had fallen in too deep into their own personal heartaches, and they just couldn't but move towards luxury again, in order to restart kissing... to be clever! Obviously.|$|R
6000|$|... "That was admirable!" [...] said Miriam, with an {{approving}} smile. [...] "If I can <b>catch</b> <b>you</b> on <b>my</b> canvas, {{it will be}} {{a glorious}} picture; only I am afraid you will dance out of it, by the very truth of the representation, just when I shall have given it the last touch. We will try it one of these days. And now, to reward you for that jolly exhibition, you shall see what has been shown to no one else." ...|$|R
5000|$|Tom {{holds up}} {{his right hand and}} sees nothing, then {{holds up his}} left hand, and drops Tyke in fear. Tom smiles nervously and {{attempting}} to run off, but just as he does Spike grabs Tom's whiskers and issues him an ultimatum: [...] "Listen pussycat. If I <b>catch</b> <b>you</b> bothering <b>my</b> boy again, I'll tear you apart! Understand? Now beat it!" [...] Spike warns the cat will to leave Tyke alone or he will suffer the consequences. As Tom runs, crashing into (in turn) a tree, a fountain, a clothesline hanger and then into a trash can.|$|R

5000|$|Tom takes {{a chicken}} leg from the kitchen, but knocks over crockery. Just in time, Tom passes the leg onto Jerry, framing him as Mammy Two Shoes arrives. Tom then chases Jerry outside and steals the chicken back to eat it. Jerry then sees Spike cuddling with his bone and exacts revenge by quietly {{stealing}} {{it from him}} and placing it on Tom's chest. [...] "Hey, you! Whatcha doin' with my bone?" [...] Tom (gesturing) [...] "Who, me?" [...] Spike: Yeah, you!;Listen, pussy cat! If I <b>catch</b> <b>you</b> takin' <b>my</b> bone again, there's gonna be trouble! Understand!?" [...] The dog angrily warns the cat {{to stay away from}} his bone, whacking him with it twice.|$|R
500|$|... "Kill the Lights" [...] is {{an urban}} and dance-pop song that alludes to Spears {{conflict}} with the paparazzi, which is perceived in lines such as [...] "Mr. Photographer / I think I'm ready for my close-up / Tonight / Make sure <b>you</b> <b>catch</b> me from <b>my</b> good side". Jon Pareles of The New York Times said the song features [...] "amid electronic blips and ominous artificial strings and horns", while Spears [...] "alternately invites photographers closer and fends them off. 'They all wanna see', she warns prospective stars. 'Is life {{going to get the}} best of you?'". [...] "Kill the Lights" [...] features a similar theme to Spears' [...] "Piece of Me" [...] (2007) and was considered its sequel, while Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone said the song [...] "recalls the synth crush of 2007's Blackout." [...] Music critics criticized the fact that Spears is introduced by Danja as [...] "Our very own Pop princess / Now Queen of Pop", commenting that the honorific nickname [...] "Queen of Pop" [...] is attributed to American recording artist Madonna, while describing her vocals as heavily produced.|$|R
6000|$|... "You think so--do you? Well, I'll make a jack-rabbit {{out of you}} if I {{find you}} on this ranch again. You've worked on my girl in some way till she's jest about quit me. I don't see how you did it, you measly little pup, but you surely have turned her against me!" [...] His rage burst into flame as {{he thought of her}} last words. [...] "If you were so much as half a man I'd break you in two pieces right now; but you're not, you're nothing but a dead-on-the-hoof lunger, and there's nothing to do but run you out. So take this as your final notice. You {{straddle}} a horse and head east and keep a-ridin', and if I <b>catch</b> <b>you</b> with <b>my</b> girl again, I'll deal you a whole hatful of misery--now that's right!" ...|$|R
50|$|What you and I {{need to do}} is {{learn to}} forget our differences. When we come {{together}}, we don't come together as Baptists or Methodists. <b>You</b> don't <b>catch</b> hell because you're a Baptist, and <b>you</b> don't <b>catch</b> hell because you're a Methodist. <b>You</b> don't <b>catch</b> hell 'cause you're a Methodist or Baptist. <b>You</b> don't <b>catch</b> hell because you're a Democrat or a Republican. <b>You</b> don't <b>catch</b> hell because you're a Mason or an Elk, and <b>you</b> sure don't <b>catch</b> hell because you're an American; because if you were an American, <b>you</b> wouldn't <b>catch</b> hell. <b>You</b> <b>catch</b> hell because you're a Black man. <b>You</b> <b>catch</b> hell, all of us catch hell, for the same reason.|$|R

25|$|An {{interesting}} {{consequence of}} the difference between these two distributions is that you will get more of the heavy fish, on average, if <b>you</b> <b>catch</b> n fish one by one than if <b>you</b> <b>catch</b> all n at the same time.|$|R

And if I <b>catch</b> <b>you</b> and <b>my</b> son again in any public {{restaurant}} I will thrash you" [...] to which Wilde responded: [...] "I don't know what the Queensberry rules are, but the Oscar Wilde rule is to shoot on sight". His account in De Profundis was less triumphant: [...] "It was when, in my library at Tite Street, waving his small hands in the air in epileptic fury, your father... stood uttering every foul word his foul mind could think of, and screaming the loathsome threats he afterwards with such cunning carried out". Queensberry only described the scene once, saying Wilde had [...] "shown him the white feather", meaning he had acted in a cowardly way. Though trying to remain calm, Wilde saw that he was becoming ensnared in a brutal family quarrel. He did not wish to bear Queensberry's insults, but he knew to confront him could lead to disaster were his liaisons disclosed publicly.|$|R
