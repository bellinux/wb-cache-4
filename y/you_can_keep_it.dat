You work willingly and well and have the makings of a first-class seaman in you; still I can understand that you would much rather be with your own people, and would be rather aiding them in capturing us than in aiding us to capture them. Consequently you will if you see an opportunity probably try to escape. I shall take as good care as I can to prevent you from doing so, and shall shoot you without hesitation if I catch you at it. Still you may escape, and I cannot run the risk of having this place discovered and our trade knocked on the head. I therefore offer you an alternative.

The eternal standing as I write (I stop at that bureau and put it down, when anything comes, and so we go on) was rather wearisome at first, but we adopted it with an eye to the long run; you're in better order--if your legs don't break down!--and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> up for more years.

40|$|Preface: Conceptually, the rearing {{of poultry}} and {{fish in a}} {{commercial}} setting have much in common. Both involve the concentration and maintenance {{of large numbers of}} animals in a confined space. In fact, the only major difference between the two seems to be the medium of gaseous exchange. Therefore, it is natural to conclude that the principles of biosecurity which have application in the poultry industry may be of value in aquaculture. The purpose of this presentation is to familiarize aquaculturists with these basic principles and demonstrate their practice using poultry as a model. The material contained in this manuscript has been used to educate poultry producers. Thus, a knowledge of aquacultural management and medicine will be required to accurately extrapolate this information. _______________________________________________________________________ What is Biosecurity? Simply stated, biosecurity is the means by which you keep infectious disease off your farm or, in the event that you have a disease problem, how <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> from spreading to your neighbors!

40|$|SUMMARY: Tasmania {{might be}} the {{smallest}} state in Australia, {{but there is a}} surprising variety of stream types crammed into that small area. Despite the fact that over a third of the state is reserved, many stream types are not included in the current reserve system. This paper discusses an approach to improving the representation of geomorphological stream features in the reserve system. This approach will help to expand our view of conservation from the present biological focus to include the physical environment, and the protection of geodiversity, as well as biodiversity. We suggest a method to identify the geodiversity associated with streams by examining variation in stream systems on a regional basis. This will not only help to improve conservation of streams, but also provide a basis for improving stream management. This paper describes: • The need for a strategic approach to the conservation of streams. • Geodiversity – what it is, why you should care about <b>it</b> and how <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>keep</b> track of <b>it.</b> • How to get enough information to have a strategic approach- a method for identifying the geodiversity of Tasmania’s streams, using GIS to define the regional context for that diversity (ie stream types and regions) ...|$|R
