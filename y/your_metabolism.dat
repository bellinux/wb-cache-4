40|$|I {{hope that}} this book will stimulate <b>your</b> mental <b>metabolism</b> with a rich and multi-faceted degustation menu. Sampling the 'dishes' {{prepared}} for this urban smorgasbord will take you on {{a tour de force}} covering a great range of timely and significant topics and issues such as sustainability, digital identity, surveillance, privacy, access, environmental impact, activism, participatory planning, and community engagement. The book exposes research accounts which seek to convey an appreciation for local differences, for the empowerment of people and for the human-centred design of urban technology. Both contributors and coverage are international. They are not limited to cases based in Europe and America only. Rather, I purposefully sourced chapters covering Asia, Africa and Australia by a most engaging and prolific group of authors not afraid of presenting challenging and controversial ideas. The book starts with some introductory examinations that situate urban informatics research in the field and critique some of the assumptions behind urban informatics, as well as propose new ways of thinking. The second section focuses on ways people use technology to participate in urban planning scenarios and online deliberations. The engagement of urban communities is the central theme of the third section of the book and brings together examples from Germany, Mexico, Australia, and Canada dealing with multiculturalism, user-led innovation, creative expression and social sustainability. The fourth section comprises examples of studies which investigate the link between the physical and digital city in the context of location, navigation and space. Wireless and mobile technology and its socio-cultural impact on urban communities and environments is the topic of the chapters in section five. And for dessert, the book concludes with a selection of outlooking and speculative chapters which examine trends in Korea and China, socio- technical innovation that support location-sensitive tools for the real-time city and citizen science, and commentaries exploring the digital desaturation of the city and – in the afterword – the relation of urban informatics to social ontology...|$|R

50|$|Do not {{be afraid}} of carbs, they are vital to <b>your</b> <b>metabolism.</b> The {{majority}} of energy produced and used by our bodies comes from carbohydrates. Just be smart in the kinds you consume, and don't fill up on carbs if you plan on lounging around all day. The main point of consuming such energy-providing foods is to fuel you through a day full of activity. The {{same can be said}} for protein. It is vital, but should be utilized when you perform moderate to heavy exercise. You must consume some sort of carbohydrate and protein every day, but dial it back when you know you'll be sitting in class or doing homework at your desk {{for the majority of the}} day.|$|E
50|$|Running {{can assist}} people in losing weight, staying {{in shape and}} {{improving}} body composition. Research suggests that for the person of average weight, they will burn approximately 100 calories per mile they run. Running increases <b>your</b> <b>metabolism</b> even after you have finished running. You will continue to burn an increased level of calories {{for a short time}} after the run. Different speeds and distances are appropriate for different individual health and fitness levels. For new runners, it takes time to get into shape. The key is consistency and a slow increase in speed and distance. While running, it is best to pay attention to how one's body feels. If a runner is gasping for breath or feels exhausted while running, it may be beneficial to slow down or try a shorter distance for a few weeks. If a runner feels that the pace or distance is no longer challenging, then the runner may want to speed up or run farther.|$|E

These climatic conditions in these regions - a high radiant heat load, especially - may require adjustments in physiology and behavior of the animal to enable their survival. The increased respiratory rate and rectal temperature, with seeking behavioral patterns reduced grazing time and increased idle time are recurrent in the literature as the main physiological and behavioral responses of sheep grazing in high radiant heat load environments.

40|$|This article proposes an {{analysis}} of central places, both {{the size of the}} urban center as the size of the regional centrality, as a product of international interests (exogenous), using the historical case study methodology, adopting as its object a theme widely considered to be exhausted that is the Salvador city's founding and of course, the first steps of the Brazilian nation, with {{an analysis}} will from their first economic cycle: pau-brasil cycle. In the construction of ideas and historical recovery favors the tertiary sector, seeking concrete historical evidence of its slow socioeconomic acceptance until the advent of capitalism. Makes a rereading the concept of formation of cities and <b>your</b> <b>metabolism</b> and some of its intrinsic elements. Concluded that there was no intention by the Portuguese founder in creating a centrality {{in the size of the}} urban center, which for lack of an internal market took more than fifty years based on trade in basic subsistence products, however Salvador was born as the main regional centrality of the southern hemisphere of the sixteenth century remained in this condition until the seventeenth century...|$|E
40|$|Objectified in {{this study}} to {{determine}} the composition of crude protein (CP) and amino acids (AA) in the perennial soy (Neonotonia wightii), leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) and guandu (Cajanus cajan). The samples were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) after the acid hydrolyses or preoxidation. The higher {{and lower levels of}} soluble crude protein (A fraction) were obtained with leucaena and guandu (33. 92 and 16. 87 %, respectively) and the higher and lower levels of acid detergent insoluble protein (ADIP) were obtained with guandu and rami (26. 68 e 2. 83 %). It were registered higher concentration of essential amino acids in rami (48. 06 %) and lower concentration in cassava (42. 20 %), being verified with it the higher level in lysine and methionine to the rami (6. 41 e 2. 66 %, respectively), and lower level to the cassava (5. 49 %) and to the guandu (2. 02 %) respectively. It were registered too higher concentration of non-essential amino acids to the rami (47. 11 %) and the lower level to the perennial soy (42. 20 %). Therefore, it can be concluded to the correct evaluation of these foods, should be considered the amino acid composition and fractionation of the crude protein, because the simply analysis of crude protein don't represent precisely and don't propitiate the correct estimative of the profile and biodisponibility of amino acids that them escape and flow to the intestinal tract of the animal and <b>your</b> <b>metabolism...</b>|$|E
40|$|Weight gain {{occurs when}} you eat more {{calories}} than your body uses. For example, there are 3, 500 calories in a pound. If a person eats 3, 500 calories and does not burn these calories, he/she will gain a pound. If a person burns 3, 500 calories more than is eaten, he/she will lose a pound. Will I gain weight when I quit smoking? When you quit smoking, you burn calories at a slower rate. Therefore, some people who quit smoking will gain weight because of this slow-down in their metabolism (the process that converts food into energy and controls {{the rate at which}} your body burns calories). Some people who quit smoking also increase their food consumption. Smokers who quit of-ten use food to deal with feelings of boredom, stress, or as a reward for not smoking. Also, those who quit often complain that they miss doing something with their hands and their mouth. You might find yourself snacking and eating more often {{to take the place of}} smoking. How can I avoid weight gain after quitting smoking? It is possible to stop smoking and not gain weight. Get the help and encouragement you need from people who support your efforts to quit. Talk to your health care provider about healthy eating or join a support group. Re-member that fad diets do not generally work. To reduce your cravings, try the following: ■ Eat a balanced and varied diet that contains fruits and vegetables. ■ Be sure to eat breakfast. ■ Limit foods high in fats and avoid concentrated sweets. ■ Drink plenty of water. ■ Eat slowly and stop eating when you feel full. ■ Increase your activity level to burn off calories more quickly. ■ Consider using nicotine replacement therapy during your quit attempt. It may help you avoid weight gain. How can exercise help? Exercise can help because it burns calories and stimulates <b>your</b> <b>metabolism.</b> When you exer-cise and burn more calories than you consume, your body uses fat for energy. Exercise also helps control your appetite and makes you want to eat less. Exercise decreases the urge for a cigarette and helps you deal with stress.
