In 2013 and 2014, the song {{was part of the}} set list of Beyoncé's The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour. On May 8, 2013, while {{performing}} the song in Manchester, she held her microphone out a random audience member, {{which turned out to be}} British singer Joe McElderry, who sang a line of the song through the microphone, Beyoncé responding [...] "Wow, <b>you</b> <b>sound</b> beautiful" [...] and holding her microphone out to him again. An a cappella version of the song was performed in 2016 as part of the setlist of The Formation World Tour.|$|E
500|$|Most of the melodies on Get to Heaven {{originated}} from Robertshaw's guitar, though he recalled to Rich Chamberlain of MusicRadar that Higgs would occasionally approach {{the rest of}} the group with [...] "an insane laptop creation" [...] which would have to be translated to work as a group. Several tracks feature complex guitar solos, as noted by Chamberlain; one such solo, featured on the title track [...] "Get to Heaven", was originally recorded in a hotel room. Another, on the single [...] "Spring / Sun / Winter / Dread", makes heavy use of an MWFX Judder pedal. Robertshaw told Chamberlain that [...] " [...] is a bit of a signature for the new record... You can do totally unrealistic things with it and it makes <b>you</b> <b>sound</b> like Steve Vai on crack." ...|$|E
500|$|Talking further about Scritti Politti, a British post-punk band, Minogue reminisced {{about her}} {{collaboration}} with the band's frontman Green Gartside, who provides vocals on the track [...] "Someday", saying, [...] "To this day I haven't met him! I {{left a message on}} his answering machine, saying, [...] "Hi, it's Kylie! I just wanted to say thanks so much! <b>You</b> <b>sound</b> brilliant!" [...] "After Dark" [...] was co-written by Dennis, who had previously co-written [...] "Can't Get You Out of My Head" [...] for Minogue. Torrini, who co-wrote [...] "Slow", revealed how she was approached for writing the song, saying [...] "It was like I had just accidentally walked into the line of fire with, [...] "Hey! You There! It was all quite surreal. I still think Kylie's people were trying to call Jamelia, and they just got the wrong number. It'd be much more funny if that is how it actually happened". The recording of Body Language took place during the summer of 2003, in London, England; Dublin, Ireland and Marbella, Spain.|$|E

500|$|Clarkson has {{cited the}} color red as the album's only theme. A color {{traditionally}} associated with Christmas, she affiliated the color to various emotions in the holidays. Wanting to stray {{away from her}} usual pop sound, she described Wrapped in Reds music as a representation to explore different genres such as jazz, country and Memphis soul. She recalled: [...] "What's cool about Christmas albums is you can do jazz, rock and roll, you can do pop, you can do blues, like {{you can do all}} that stuff and it works—cause it's all classic and it's Christmasy sounding." [...] She also noted that the album's multitude of styles positively contributed to her artistic goal, saying: [...] "My best friend from childhood heard it and said, 'This is what <b>you</b> <b>sound</b> like, before everything else.' And I agree, It's my core sound. Back in the day, when artists came out with things like [...] "Fall to Pieces" [...] and [...] "Bridge over Troubled Water", those songs transcended genres. It wasn't, 'Where is it going to fit?' You catered to whatever the song calls for. And that's exactly what I did—without having to have an umbrella for everything." ...|$|E
500|$|In July 1957, Monk {{began to}} perform at the venue for six months with saxophonist John Coltrane, bassist Ahmed Abdul-Malik, and drummer Shadow Wilson in his group. However, by the time Monk's {{employment}} there ended in December, he had lost Wilson to poor health, while Coltrane left {{in pursuit of a}} solo career and a return to Miles Davis's group. After returning to New York City's club scene with a new quartet, Monk received an eight-week offer from Joe and Iggy Termini to play the Five Spot Café beginning on June 12, 1958. He played most nights during the weekend to capacity crowds with Abdul-Malik, drummer Roy Haynes, and tenor saxophonist Johnny Griffin, who had performed with Monk before. Griffin was unfamiliar with all of his repertoire and, like Coltrane, found it difficult to solo over Monk's comping during their first few weeks: [...] "Any deviation, one note off, and <b>you</b> <b>sound</b> like you're playing another tune, and you're not paying attention to what's going on. And it's so evident ... there's no space." [...] During their performances, Monk often left the stage for a drink at the bar or danced around, which gave Griffin an opportunity to play with more space. However, the quartet eventually developed a sufficient rapport and grasp of the set list.|$|E

2500|$|Mira Sorvino {{mentioned}} in a 2011 interview that she chose Linda's voice {{to be high}} and gravelly since [...] "high voice kind of makes <b>you</b> <b>sound</b> less intellectually gifted, and the gravelly part just added this kind of rough-and-tumble, been-to-the-school-of-hard-knocks element to it." [...] Four weeks into the production, Allen spoke with Sorvino asking if she had ever wondered about using a different voice. Sorvino stated that the voice affected how she approached the character, and that if she changed the voice the character changed.
