2500|$|Parcells {{left the}} Patriots after {{disagreements}} with owner Robert Kraft. He had effectively been the team's general manager since arriving in New England, but felt Kraft {{would not allow}} him enough input in player personnel decisions. Upon his departure, Parcells famously stated: [...] "They want you to cook the dinner; at least they ought to let <b>you</b> <b>shop</b> {{for some of the}} groceries. Okay?" [...] This was mainly in reference to an incident in the Patriots' war room during the 1996 Draft. Parcells wanted to draft DE Tony Brackens with their first-round choice, but was vetoed by Kraft. They ultimately selected Ohio State WR Terry Glenn.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the months}} and years after Kraft's {{purchase}} of the Patriots, relations between Kraft and Parcells were increasingly strained. This was primarily due to a struggle over Parcells' authority over football operations. [...] Kraft wanted Parcells to yield some of his authority over personnel moves to a separate general manager. Parcells had effectively been the Patriots' general manager as well since his arrival, and {{was not interested in}} yielding authority that he had been granted over personnel when he was hired. [...] He famously complained that [...] "if they're gonna let you cook the dinner, they at least ought to let <b>you</b> <b>shop</b> for some of the groceries." [...] The conflict climaxed {{in the days leading up}} to the Super Bowl, with rampant rumors that Parcells would leave the Patriots after the season to take the vacant head coaching job with the New York Jets. Despite these distractions, the Patriots played the Packers close for much of the game, and actually took the lead briefly in the 2nd quarter. However, two long Brett Favre touchdown passes and a Super Bowl record 99-yard kickoff return for a touchdown by MVP Desmond Howard sealed New England's fate, with the Packers winning their 12th title, and third of the Super Bowl era, 35–21.|$|E

5000|$|For {{most of the}} end of the 1996 season, the Jets were courting Parcells to {{take over}} their {{football}} operations.
