5|$|MFGM lipid {{components}} such as sphingomyelin and gangliosides {{are highly}} {{concentrated in the}} brain and support synaptogenesis and myelination. In the central nervous system, sphingomyelin is a key component of the myelin sheath, which insulates axons and supports efficient transmission of nerve impulses. During myelination, nerve axons are wrapped with multiple layers of cell membrane by oligodendrocyte glial cells, a process that accounts for a large portion of brain growth during late gestation and the first two <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> but which can also continue up to 5–10 years of age. Meanwhile, gangliosides are concentrated within the brain’s gray matter and constitute approximately 6% to 10% of the total human brain lipid mass. Additionally, gangliosides are enriched at the synaptic membrane of neurons, and are functionally involved in neurotransmission and synapse formation. Brain ganglioside accretion occurs at an accelerated rate in the early <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> coinciding with the most active period of myelination, axonal outgrowth, and synaptogenesis.|$|E

5|$|At the {{prenatal}} and neonatal {{stages of}} life, {{the presence of}} antibodies is provided by passive immunization from the mother. Early endogenous antibody production varies for different kinds of antibodies, and usually appear within the first <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> Since antibodies exist freely in the bloodstream, {{they are said to}} be part of the humoral immune system. Circulating antibodies are produced by clonal B cells that specifically respond to only one antigen (an example is a virus capsid protein fragment). Antibodies contribute to immunity in three ways: They prevent pathogens from entering or damaging cells by binding to them; they stimulate removal of pathogens by macrophages and other cells by coating the pathogen; and they trigger destruction of pathogens by stimulating other immune responses such as the complement pathway. Antibodies will also trigger vasoactive amine degranulation to contribute to immunity against certain types of antigens (helminths, allergens).|$|E

5|$|The pigeye shark is an apex {{predator}} that mostly hunts low in {{the water}} column. It has a varied diet, consisting mainly of bony and cartilaginous fishes and also including crustaceans, molluscs, sea snakes, and cetaceans. This species gives birth to live young, with the developing embryos sustained to term via a placental connection to their mother. Litters of three to thirteen pups are born after a gestation period of nine or twelve months. Young sharks spend their first few <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> in sheltered inshore habitats such as bays, where their movements follow tidal and seasonal patterns. The pigeye shark's size and dentition make it potentially dangerous, though {{it has not been}} known to attack humans.

5|$|Mu {{waves are}} thought to be {{indicative}} of an infant’s developing ability to imitate. This is important because the ability to imitate plays a vital {{role in the development of}} motor skills, tool use, and understanding causal information through social interaction. Mimicking is integral in the development of social skills and understanding nonverbal cues. Causal relationships can be made through social learning without requiring experience firsthand. In action execution, mu waves are present in both infants and adults before and after the execution of a motor task and its accompanying desynchronization. While executing a goal-oriented action, however, infants exhibit a higher degree of desynchronization than do adults. Just as with an action execution, during action observation infants’ mu waves not only show a desynchronization, but show a desynchronization greater in degree than the one evidenced in adults. This tendency for changes in degree of desynchronization, rather than actual changes in frequency, becomes the measure for mu wave development throughout adulthood, although the most changes take place during the first year of life. Understanding the mechanisms that are shared between action perception and execution in the earliest <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> has implications for language development. Learning and understanding through social interaction comes from imitating movements as well as vowel sounds. Sharing the experience of attending to an object or event with another person can be a powerful force in the development of language.|$|E

This was a population-based survey of 13 -month-old infants visiting well baby clinics for a scheduled immunization. Parents/caregivers completed a standardized validated questionnaire on respiratory symptoms in the first <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> and putative risk factors. The independent influence of these factors for wheeze was assessed by multiple logistic regression analysis. A total of 1, 115 questionnaires were completed. Wheeze ever (with a prevalence in the first <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> 28. 5 %) was independently associated with male gender, eczema, sibs with asthma, any allergic disease in the family, day care, damp housing, and asphyxia. Recurrent wheeze (prevalence 14. 5 %) showed independent associations with eczema, sibs with asthma, and day care. In addition to these factors, severe wheeze (prevalence 15. 4 %) was also associated with premature rupture of membranes during birth, and with damp housing. Wheeze is common during the first <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> and places a major burden on families and the health care system. Factors associated with wheeze are mainly related to markers of atopic susceptibility, and to exposure to infections.
