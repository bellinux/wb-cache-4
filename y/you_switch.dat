500|$|Most reviewers {{felt that}} though the {{gameplay}} and storyline {{had not changed}} much since the first games, Diamond and Pearl were still engaging. Ryan Davis of GameSpot said, [...] "t's a little surprising how well the formula holds up in Diamond and Pearl, which {{is a testament to}} the strong fundamentals of the series as well as the quality of the execution." [...] The games' Wi-Fi connectivity also earned largely positive reviews. 1UP.com called the addition of wireless connectivity the games' [...] "biggest improvements". GameSpot and GameSpy both listed the addition of online play as one of the positive points of the games and called the system [...] "robust" [...] and [...] "probably the most significant new feature." [...] ComputerAndVideoGames.com said of the Global Trade Center, [...] "Suddenly, Pokémon feels properly alive for the first time since playgrounds were abuzz with monsters in the late '90s – and you'll instantly forgive Game Freak their technical stubbornness the first time <b>you</b> <b>switch</b> on your DS and find the level 100 Munchlax you craved is on your cart." ...|$|E
500|$|McFeely {{said the}} writing process began {{in the middle of}} 2011, around the release of The First Avenger, with him and Markus [...] "noodling on in hopes {{that there would be a}} second one and we did a lot of just {{throwing}} stuff at the wall and seeing what stuck". The first few months of writing were a back and forth process with Marvel, but after an outline was finished, the story did not change much. They opted to set the story in the present day, and, after [...] "experimenting with flashback elements for more period World War II stuff", decided to abandon the flashbacks as [...] "it became unwieldy." [...] The film would be [...] "Cap versus the world we all live in today", while averting excessive comedy regarding the hero's time displacement, as Markus considered the Captain [...] "the most adaptive man on the planet." [...] The tone would be more grounded in reality despite the advanced technology to contrast the fantasy elements from both the first Captain America and The Avengers. Despite that, the comic book origins guaranteed that the film would not have verisimilitude. This still proved a challenge in the reveal of Arnim Zola, that had to be extensively rewritten to convey how [...] "this grounded espionage paranoid thriller suddenly screeches to a halt and <b>you</b> <b>switch</b> gears really quickly with this ghost in the machine" [...] that introduces more science fiction elements.|$|E

There were all these leads and stuff, there was no instruction manual." [...] The patch which had been provided by Mike Vickers produced six distinctive Moog sounds, and these six became the foundation of ELP's sound.|$|E

In July 2000, the couple were together at the gravesite of Weems's brother, {{who had died in}} an automobile accident at age 25 in 1998, when Weems, without warning, put a gun to his head and committed suicide. [...] "Afterward, I felt, 'What else could I have done?' You replay that situation over and over and <b>you</b> <b>switch</b> it around: Maybe if I had said this, or if I would have done that,'" [...] {{she said in an interview}} with The Cincinnati Enquirer the following year.

2500|$|Each {{time the}} {{formation}} drill is performed, a different fourth- or fifth-year sousaphone player is chosen to stand as the dot in the [...] "i" [...] of [...] "Ohio." [...] Because the Script Ohio formation {{was one of}} many new formations included by director Weigel, no extra emphasis was placed on the dotting. Originally, an E-flat cornet player, John Brungart, was the first [...] "i"-dotter. Brungart dotted the [...] "i" [...] two more times that season, in performances during halftime shows against Pittsburgh and Chicago. The first recorded instance of a sousaphone player dotting the i was the final game of the 1936 season on November 21 at home versus Michigan. In the fall of 1937, Weigel turned to Glen Johnson, a sousaphone player, and shouted, [...] "Hey, <b>you!</b> <b>Switch</b> places with the trumpet player in the dot." [...] A year later, when the drum major arrived {{at the top of the}} [...] "i" [...] three or four measures too early, Johnson turned and bowed to the crowd to use up the rest of the music. The bow has been part of the show since then. Glen then became the second sousaphone player to dot the [...] "i" [...] on October 23, 1937. Since then, a sousaphone player has dotted the [...] "i" [...] over 800 times.|$|E
