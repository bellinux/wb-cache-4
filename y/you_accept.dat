5|$|Occasionally, {{when the}} player confronts an enemy officer, the officer will {{challenge}} {{them to a}} one-on-one duel. If the player accepts, they will be transported to a small arena away from the main battlefield where a one-on-one fight with the officer will take place until either is victorious or time runs out. If the player declines, your morale will drop. If the player wins, their morale will rise and the enemy officer will {{be removed from the}} battlefield. If <b>you</b> <b>accept</b> the officers challenge they do become more difficult to beat in the duel.|$|E
25|$|If <b>you</b> <b>accept</b> that James Moore {{believed}} {{he won the}} first bicycle race, then, as he surely cannot have forgotten that his race was at least scheduled to be {{the second of the}} day at St Cloud, there must have been either something different about the first race – e.g. it was not exclusively for pedal machines – or the order of the events was changed so that his race took place first. My hypothesis assumes the former proposition, and is only partly reliant on whether the rules stated that the front wheels of the velocipedes in the second race were to be precisely 1 metre diameter as stated in your article. My main argument, however, is that the word velocipede was used generically to include all types of machine including even hobby-horses for which it was originally coined. They would surely have had wheels of less than one metre diameter.|$|E

500|$|Fellow {{executive}} producer Rick Berman recalled heated discussions over {{the content of}} the script, and following re-writes to the draft, Leder elected to be credited only under the pseudonym Gary Percante. This was the only time during Piller's tenure as {{executive producer}} that a writer chose to be credited under a pseudonym. Piller subsequently praised the episode, saying [...] "We have Beverly argue the point that Kamala's mission amounts to prostitution, and we have Picard taking the other tack; that whether or not we approve, we can't change or interfere with the way these people are. And if <b>you</b> <b>accept</b> [...] Roddenberry's vision, which we are built on, you have to respect that." ...|$|E

The day he landed in the Philippines, Groza saw a soldier shot in the face. He was stationed in a bank of tents about five miles from the front lines and helped doctors tend to the wounded.

According to Dr Gill who conducted the tests, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>accept</b> that these samples came from Anna Anderson, then Anna Anderson could not be related to Tsar Nicholas or Tsarina Alexandra." [...] Anderson's mitochondrial DNA was a match with a great-nephew of Franziska Schanzkowska, a missing Polish factory worker.

500|$|Responding to Steiner, Robert Stevens {{provides}} {{examples of}} what he categorises variously as offers, threats and throffers that fail to meet Steiner's definitions. He gives {{an example of an}} intervention he considers a throffer, as opposed to a threat, but in which both compliance and noncompliance are less preferable to the norm. The example is that of someone who makes the demand [...] "either <b>you</b> <b>accept</b> my offer of a handful of beans for your cow, or I kill you". For the subject, keeping the cow is preferred to both compliance and noncompliance with the throffer. Using this and other examples, Stevens argued that Steiner's account of differentiating the three kinds of interventions is incorrect.|$|E
500|$|Roberts {{sent for}} Burnham soon after {{arriving}} in South Africa on the RMS Dunottar Castle. The American scout was prospecting near Skagway, Alaska, when he received the following telegram in January 1900: [...] "Lord Roberts appoints you on his personal staff as Chief of Scouts. If <b>you</b> <b>accept,</b> come at once the quickest way possible." [...] Cape Town is {{at the opposite end}} of the globe from the Klondike, so Burnham left immediately. In an unusual step for a foreigner, Burnham received a command post from Roberts and the British Army rank of captain. Burnham reached the front just before the Battle of Paardeberg (February 1900). During the war, Burnham spent much time behind the Boer lines gathering information and blowing up railway bridges and tracks. He was captured twice (escaping both times), and also temporarily disabled at one point by near-fatal wounds.|$|E

500|$|Andrew Johnston of Time Out New York wrote [...] "Let's face it: no film {{could ever}} match the {{expectations}} some have for Episode IThe Phantom Menace. Which isn't to say it's a disappointment: on the contrary, it's awesomely entertaining, provided <b>you</b> <b>accept</b> {{it on its}} own terms...Like the original film, it's a Boy's Own adventure yarn with a corny but irresistible spiritual subtext. The effects and production design are stunning, but they always serve the story, {{not the other way}} around." [...] Susan Wloszczyna of USA Today said the film did [...] "plenty right" [...] and praised the characters Darth Maul and Watto. David Cornelius of efilmcritic.com said the film's better moments [...] "don't merely balance out the weaker onesthey topple them." [...] Colin Kennedy of Empire magazine said that despite problems with pacing and writing, [...] "there is still much pleasure to be had watching our full-blown Jedi guides in action." [...] He praised the visuals and Liam Neeson's performance, and said the duel between Darth Maul and the Jedi was [...] "the saga's very best lightsaber battle".|$|E
500|$|Flack notes a {{distinction}} between the [...] "strong sense" [...] of Nonviolent Communication as a virtue that is possible with care and attention, and the [...] "weak sense," [...] a mimicry of this born of ego and haste. The strong sense offers a language to examine one's thinking and actions, support understanding, bring one's best to the community, and honor one's emotions. In the weak sense, one may take the language as rules and use these to score debating points, label others for political gain, or insist that others express themselves in this way. Though concerned that some of what Rosenberg says could lead to the weak sense, Flack sees evidence confirming that Rosenberg understands the strong sense in practice. Rosenberg's work with workshop attendees demonstrates [...] "the real thing." [...] Yet Flack warns that [...] "the temptation of the weak sense will not be absent." [...] As an antidote, Flack advises, [...] "Be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what <b>you</b> <b>accept</b> from others," [...] (also known as the robustness principle) and guard against the [...] "metamorphosis of nonviolent communication into subtle violence done in its name." ...|$|E
500|$|Hadley {{found the}} most {{important}} contribution of the theoretical framework laid down in Animal Rights Without Liberation to be {{the application of a}} Razian framework of rights to animals, adding that [...] "assuming that one takes philosophical reasoning seriously, there is little to take issue with in Cochrane's analysis". However, for Hadley, there is a fundamental tension in Cochrane's theory, as there is in most animal rights literature. In denying that animals possess the psychological capacities to value freedom, Cochrane undermines the challenge to orthodox rights theory that it is not only persons who should possess rights. For Hadley, [...] "only theories that have no truck with commonsense intuitions at all, like Bentham's, are really in a position to place humans and animals on a genuinely equal moral plain. The rest, arguably, are more or less disguised versions of the person-centred orthodoxy masked by rhetorical appeals to cross-species equality." [...] Hadley denies that this tension undermines Cochrane's overall argument, writing that it [...] "ought to give no comfort to opponents of animal rights. [...] reasoning, assuming <b>you</b> <b>accept</b> animals matter at all, is as uncontroversial as his writing is accessible." ...|$|E

500|$|Goldstone was {{hindered}} by the inflexible bureaucracy of the UN, finding {{the newly established}} ICTY in a shambles {{when he joined the}} tribunal. The tribunal lacked political legitimacy, financial support and prosecutorial direction; its failure to even bring any prosecutions had led to it being criticised by the media as [...] "a fig leaf for inaction", and Goldstone was asked by the former British prime minister Edward Heath: [...] "Why did <b>you</b> <b>accept</b> such a ridiculous job?" [...] He had to make repeated appeals to the UN's hierarchy and to donor nations for the equipment and funding that the tribunal needed to operate. He quickly found that the key to the job was to take [...] " [...] big-picture diplomatic role and [...] that the hands-on prosecution work could be pushed down to experienced prosecutors and investigators like [...] Blewitt – {{at least for the time}} being." [...] He undertook a flurry of media appearances and financial negotiations that led to the tribunal being properly staffed for the first time, with many staff being recruited through his own personal networks; a budget of eight million dollars from thirteen countries, supplemented by a $300,000 donation from George Soros; and the first indictment, of Bosnian Serb prison camp guard Duško Tadić.|$|E
500|$|The book {{reveals that}} members of the {{organisation}} had attempted to donate funds to the 2007 re-election campaign of Prime Minister of Australia John Howard in a way in which information about the financing would not have been available to the general public. Individuals describing themselves as a [...] "private group" [...] had met with a senior figure within the Liberal Party of Australia in a hotel in Sydney, and offered him a significant amount of money by way of an anonymous donation. The book's source recounted the events: [...] "They said 'We are a private group'. I asked them if they voted. It was a testing question. They said they didn't. It was a very short discussion." [...] The organisation's members are instructed that government is controlled by God, and they are told not to vote in elections. [...] "We're in the business of ideas and so are the Exclusive Brethren. I regard many of the party's views and those of the Exclusive Brethren as inconsistent. What the [...] Party stands for should not be confused {{in the mind of the}} electorate by the acceptance of donations from fringe groups.

500|$|Trial by Jury is {{the only}} Gilbert and Sullivan opera played in one act and the only {{theatrical}} work by W. S. Gilbert without spoken dialogue. However, later Gilbert and Sullivan operas retained a number of patterns seen in Trial. [...] For example, all except The Yeomen of the Guard begin with a chorus number. [...] Also, like Trial by Jury, the later operas generally end with a relatively short finale consisting of a chorus number interspersed with short solos by the principal characters. [...] "Comes the broken flower" [...] (part of No.3) {{was the first in}} a string of meditative [...] "Horatian" [...] lyrics, [...] "mingling happiness and sadness, an acceptance and a smiling resignation". [...] These would, from this point forward, allow the characters, in each of the Savoy operas, an introspective scene where they stop and consider life, in contrast to the foolishness of the surrounding scenes. [...] Like both of the tenor's arias in Trial by Jury, tenor arias in later Savoy operas were set in 6/8 time so frequently that Anna Russell, in her 1953 parody, [...] "How to Write Your Own Gilbert and Sullivan Opera", exclaimed, [...] "the tenor...according to tradition, must sing an aria in 6/8 time, usually accompanying himself on a stringed instrument". [...] In Trial by Jury hypocrisy is revealed as the characters' motivations are held up to satire, and Gilbert mocks the underlying absurdity of the judicial procedures. [...] As Gilbert scholar Andrew Crowther explains, Gilbert combines his criticisms with comic entertainment, which renders them more palatable, {{while at the same time}} underlining their truth: [...] "By laughing at a joke you show that <b>you</b> <b>accept</b> its premise." [...] This too would become characteristic of Gilbert's work.|$|E
