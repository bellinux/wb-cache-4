2500|$|In November 2005, Tate {{appeared}} as Lauren {{in a special}} sketch for the BBC's annual Children in Need telethon.

[...] (pronounced 'Cock-er-ney') and [...] "Do you know Chas & Dave? Are you their mum?" [...] repeatedly.

2500|$|In late 2010, Sonya's younger sister, Jade (Gemma Pranita) was {{introduced}} to the serial. A reporter from the Herald Sun stated that Jade's arrival would see her expose [...] "a dark secret" [...] held by Sonya. Before Jade arrived in Erinsborough, she and Sonya had been estranged from each other for seven years. Jade contacts Sonya out of the blue, leaving her [...] "mortified" [...] by the call. Pranita told Jackie Brygel from TV Week, [...] "Sonya's response is 'Why are <b>you</b> <b>calling</b> me? Why now? Don't come anywhere near me!' But Jade keeps ringing and harassing Sonya and then rocks up on her doorstep." [...] Pranita explained that Jade and Sonya share a bad history and that Jade has been holding on to one of Sonya's darkest secrets, which the people in Sonya's life know nothing about. The actress thought that Jade's appearance would [...] "completely rock the boat", especially as she has the potential to cause trouble for her sister and expose her for lying to everyone.|$|E
2500|$|At about 01:20 a weak {{female voice}} called [...] "Häire, häire, laeval on häire", Estonian for [...] "Alarm, alarm, there is alarm on the ship", over the public address system, which was {{followed}} immediately by an internal alarm for the crew, then one minute {{later by the}} general lifeboat alarm. The vessel's rapid list and the flooding prevented {{many people in the}} cabins from ascending to the boat deck. A Mayday was communicated by the ship's crew at 01:22, but did not follow international formats. Estonia directed a call to Silja Europa and only after making contact with her did the radio operator utter the word [...] "Mayday". In English, the radio operator on Silja Europa, chief mate Teijo Seppelin replied: [...] "Estonia, are <b>you</b> <b>calling</b> mayday?" [...] After that, the voice of Andres Tammes took over on Estonia and the conversation shifted to Finnish. Tammes was able to provide some details about their situation but due to loss of power, he could not give their position, which delayed rescue operations somewhat. Some minutes later power returned (or, somebody on the bridge managed to lower himself to the starboard side of the bridge to check the marine GPS, which will display the ship's position even in blackout conditions), and the Estonia was able to radio their position to Silja Europa and Mariella. The ship disappeared from the radar screens of other ships at around 01:50, and sank at , about [...] on bearing 157° from Utö island, Finland, in [...] of water.|$|E
