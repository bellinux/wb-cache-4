5|$|Before {{releasing}} the documentary, Madonna invited {{a select group}} of friends and co-workers to watch a rough three-hour cut of the film at a local theater in Notting Hill. The film was trimmed after negative feedback regarding excessive details about Kabbalah. For the promotion and premiere of the film, Madonna appeared at Q sessions with the press and also gave a speech to film students at New York's Hunter College. Critical response to I'm Going to Tell <b>You</b> <b>a</b> Secret was mixed, with reviewers complimenting the live performances and the scenes involving her children and family, but criticizing the self-indulgent and preachy nature. I'm Going to Tell <b>You</b> <b>a</b> Secret was released in a two-disc format, a CD with 14 songs from the show and a DVD with the documentary film. It received a positive response from critics but was a moderate success commercially.|$|E

5|$|From {{the very}} beginning, {{from the first}} moment I may almost say, of my {{acquaintance}} with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form that the groundwork of disapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike.
