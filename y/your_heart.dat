5|$|If {{my letter}} makes no appeal to <b>your</b> <b>heart,</b> on the {{eleventh}} day {{of this month}} I shall proceed with such co-workers of the Ashram as I can take, to disregard {{the provisions of the}} Salt Laws. I regard this tax to be the most iniquitous of all from the poor man's standpoint. As the sovereignty and self-rule movement is essentially for the poorest in the land, the beginning will be made with this evil.|$|E
5|$|Once {{you hear}} the song 'Fighting Temptation', and all the music in this film, you can't help but {{fall in love with}} it. You'll {{definitely}} get emotional. You might become happy or even sad, but <b>your</b> <b>heart</b> will get full. All the songs are touching and spiritual, and that's what the movie itself is like.|$|E

Two singles, Hitomi no Kakera and Inside <b>Your</b> <b>Heart,</b> {{were published in the}} same year by FictionJunction Yuuka, each containing an opening/ending theme and one insert song, as well as their respective karaoke versions.|$|E
5|$|Dor makes {{a strong}} feminist {{statement}} without being strident or shouting slogans. And all along, the riveting friendship {{between the two}} polarized women and the events that bring them together, keep tugging at <b>your</b> <b>heart.</b> Shreyas Talpade proves that (his previous film), Iqbal was no accident and Gul Panag gives {{one of the most}} convincing portrayals of her career. But, it is Ayesha Takia who simply blows your breath away. Her journey from joyous subjugation — where she is content to dance before her husband and be at the beck and call of her in-laws — to silent emancipation is absolutely endearing.|$|E
5|$|In 1988 Playtex {{split into}} two companies, Playtex Apparel and Playtex Family Products, {{in a series of}} {{financial}} transactions totaling $1.3 billion. The transactions allowed Smilow to buy out other Playtex shareholders and put ownership of the brand into two separate investment groups that were owned by Smilow and other Playtex executives. In 1990 Playtex Products acquired cosmetics brand Maybelline for $300 million.($ in modern dollars). The next year Smilow sold Playtex Apparel to the Sara Lee Corporation, transferring the Bali, Hanes, and Cross <b>Your</b> <b>Heart</b> brands for $571 million, ($ in modern dollars) but keeping the Playtex Family Products Corporation.|$|E

5|$|Los Angeles {{photographer}} Sam Jones contacted Wilco in 2000 about {{producing a}} documentary {{film about the}} creation of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. Jones shot over 80 hours of footage for I Am Trying to Break <b>Your</b> <b>Heart</b> (named after the opening song of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot) beginning {{on the day that}} Coomer was dismissed from the band. The footage was edited down to 92 minutes, and the film was released to theaters in 2002. The documentary has received generally positive reviews.|$|E
5|$|Karofsky {{is elected}} prom king, and non-candidate Kurt is elected prom queen. Kurt {{runs from the}} gym in humiliation and is consoled by Blaine. Distressed at having lost, Quinn slaps Rachel, though she {{immediately}} regrets it, while Santana is comforted by Brittany, who tells her to be herself rather than hide her lesbian identity. Kurt is able to calm down and return for his coronation; his comment—"Eat <b>your</b> <b>heart</b> out, Kate Middleton"—garners applause that swells into an ovation. Karofsky, abruptly faced with having to publicly dance with another boy in the traditional dance between King and Queen, cannot do it; rejecting Kurt's suggestion that he come out then and there, he instead leaves Kurt alone on the dance floor. Blaine asks Kurt to dance with him, and they are soon joined {{by the rest of}} the student body.|$|E

Ethan takes this the wrong way and stabs his father 38 times (not shown) and becomes very crazy. Roger admits to being a fake, and he and Hayley leave, saying that the police are coming.

25|$|The band's sound {{gradually}} took on {{a heavier}} tone as Hoppus and Barker purchased a studio in which to record. Although hotly anticipated by music press, the band's debut, When <b>Your</b> <b>Heart</b> Stops Beating (2006), undersold commercial expectations and received mixed reviews from critics. The group toured worldwide throughout 2006 and 2007, including a summer slot on the Honda Civic Tour alongside Fall Out Boy. Hoppus later began preparing material for a solo album and put plans for a second +44 album on hold in 2008, and the group entered an extended hiatus with the reunion of Blink-182 in 2009.|$|E
