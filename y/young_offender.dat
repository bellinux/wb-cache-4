40|$|The paper {{addresses}} {{social inclusion}} support {{as a main}} focus area of intervention for <b>young</b> <b>offenders</b> after being released from custody in Malta, a former protectorate and colony of Britain from which it has inherited its public administration and education system. According to European Commission statistics published in 2011, the island has {{the highest percentage of}} <b>young</b> <b>offenders</b> in the European Union. The objective of this research is to investigate whether it is financially feasible to embark on studies to prepare a <b>Young</b> <b>Offenders</b> Housing and Resettlement Protocol and a cross-government action plan for the resettlement of juveniles following their term in custody. This research is based on quantitative analysis of published and unpublished data relating to <b>Young</b> <b>Offenders</b> Unit Rehabilitation Services, Malta. The approach adopted is inspired by current practice and findings in Britain. Compiling a protocol and a cross-government action plan essential for effective public policy for housing <b>young</b> <b>offenders</b> following their term in custody is a financially viable option for Malta. The expenses incurred in providing custody for re-offenders balance out the costs involved in funding preparation of a <b>Young</b> <b>Offenders</b> Housing and Resettlement Protocol, the action plan and all supporting technical reports. In the payback period, a further reduction of the costs of preparing them can be attained by tapping into funding sources such as European Union co-financing programmes. The preparation of a <b>Young</b> <b>Offenders</b> Housing and Resettlement Protocol and a cross-government action plan for <b>young</b> <b>offenders</b> drafted with all parties involved, including the offenders themselves, is a way to invest in the nation's social capital with humanity. The short-, medium- and long-term impacts on such human capital investment are positive for both the <b>young</b> <b>offenders</b> and the community, the victim of crime. This paper proposes that the effort to draft instruments introducing an effective housing and resettlement policy constitutes a viable, cost-effective preventive measure against the relapsing of <b>young</b> <b>offenders.</b> peer-reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Recently in Canada and the United States {{there has}} been an intensifying {{political}} debate about serious and violent <b>young</b> <b>offenders.</b> The policy issues in the US have focused on capital punishment and mistreatment of incarcerated <b>young</b> <b>offenders,</b> and the implementation of mandatory minimum custodial sentences for <b>young</b> <b>offenders</b> in Canada. There have been few studies on how <b>young</b> <b>offenders</b> adapt to custody. The three dominant perspectives have been the importation, deprivation, and integrated models. Certain key imported, deprivation, and combined factors were statistically related to separate measures of physical, verbal, and property aggression in a sample from British Columbia’s largest <b>young</b> <b>offender’s</b> custodial facility. Qualitative interviews with key government officials provided an historical perspective about the deprivation structure of custody in this facility. Structured in-depth interviews with 189 incarcerated <b>young</b> <b>offenders</b> provided for bi-variate and multi-variate analyses of the relationship between key imported and deprivation variables, and three types of aggression. While imported variables predominated the statistical models, particularly regarding physical aggression, deprivation variables and interactive effects were also identified for verbal and property aggression. This suggested that an integrated model best explained different forms of aggression in youth custody...|$|R
40|$|Restorative justice {{conferencing}} for <b>young</b> <b>offenders</b> is a legislated {{response to}} youth offending, {{which has been}} in place in all Australian states and territories for nearly two decades. Restorative justice conferences are meetings between <b>young</b> <b>offenders,</b> their victims and supporters to discuss the offence, its impact and what the young person can do to repair harms caused by the offending behaviour. There is now a substantial body of research that has examined the impact restorative justice processes have on participants (eg how <b>young</b> <b>offenders</b> and victims judge the process). Results are largely positive, showing that participants view restorative justice processes as fair and they are satisfied with outcomes. Given the highly conversational nature of restorative justice conferencing processes however, this paper reviews research on oral language competence and youth offending. It raises questions about the need to refine preparatory work with <b>young</b> <b>offenders</b> and victims, to better understand young offenders' capacities to effectively communicate in conference processes. It suggests that improved preparation (where language impairments in <b>young</b> <b>offenders</b> are identified and addressed) will lead to better outcomes for <b>young</b> <b>offenders</b> and victims.

[...] Carty denied any involvement in the incident, claiming it had been the result of an argument Brown had with the youths earlier. On 27 November 2006, Carty and Brown were convicted of murder.

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The past decade has seen a rapid expansion of the numbers of young people drawn into {{the criminal justice system}} and custody. This study investigates how youth justice practitioners (including Youth Offending Team (YOT) workers, solicitors, police and lay magistrates) assess the risks and needs of young law-breakers, and make decisions and recommendations. The study also explores how the <b>young</b> <b>offenders</b> themselves engage in these processes. A case study approach has been adopted where all individuals routinely involved in processing young law-breakers from a single small Local Authority have been interviewed. A sample of <b>young</b> <b>offenders</b> have also been interviewed. Six months of ethnographic observations of the youth court and YOT meetings and key policy meetings within the Magistrates' Court, Local Authority and police authority were used to supplement interview materials. Currently, only the interview transcripts are available from the UKDA. Further information can be found about the project on the ESRC web page.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} attachment representations and metacognitive skills in <b>young</b> violent <b>offenders</b> using a psychoanalytic developmental and attachment theory framework. The {{sample consisted of}} 20 male <b>young</b> <b>offenders</b> who commited violent offences and a matched non-delinquent control group. The sample was assessed with the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI), the Inventory for Parent and Peer Attachment (IPPA) and the Reading-the-mind-in-the-eyes-Test. Contrary to the studys initial hypotheses, {{there were no differences}} between experimental and control groups in either attachment representations or metacognitive skills. <b>Young</b> <b>offenders</b> who grew up with both biological parents tended to have better metacognitive skills than offenders who grew up without their fathers. <b>Young</b> <b>offenders</b> who grew up with mother and stepfather {{were also more likely to}} show less well developed metacognitive capacities than those who grew up without their stepfather. The experimental group reported significantly more traumatic childhood experiences (e. g. neglect, loss of attachment figures, sexual abuse, violence) compared to the control group. Interestingly, <b>young</b> <b>offenders</b> who grew up with both biological parents experienced fewer traumatic experiences in childhood, whereas <b>young</b> <b>offenders</b> who grew up with their mother and a stepfather reported the most severe traumatic childhood experiences. Finally, quantitative data were examined with exemplary extracts from the Adult Attachment Interviews (AAIs). The findings of this thesis are critically discussed in relation to the studys limitations, the existing literature, possible implications for future research and recommendations for therapeutic and educational work with <b>young</b> <b>offenders...</b>|$|R

50|$|Sentencing Options 42(2)(d)If a {{young person}} is found guilty of an offence in a youth justice court, the judge may impose a {{sentence}} under section 42 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act (YCJA). The purpose of sentencing under the YCJA “is to hold {{a young person}} accountable for an offence by imposing fair sanctions with meaningful consequences.” Under section 42(2)(d) it states that a <b>young</b> <b>offender</b> {{may not have a}} fine against them exceeding $1000 to be paid at the time and on the terms that the court may fix. This entails that the courts must have regard to the means of how the <b>young</b> <b>offender</b> will pay, as well as the ability for the <b>young</b> <b>offender</b> to be granted more time to complete the sentence. The offender then has the following options, he or she may be ordered to pay a victim fine surcharge (up to 15%) which contributes to assisting the victims of the crime. Or, the province may establish a program under which the <b>young</b> <b>offender</b> can discharge a fine under para, the percentage imposed under s53(1) or Victim fine surcharge under s 53(2) which is only attainable by earning credits for work in the program of the province the <b>young</b> <b>offender</b> resides.|$|E
