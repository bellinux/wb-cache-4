6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{satisfied}} with the grounds we gave for stopping? I mean, do you imagine he believes we merely want to trade?" ...|$|E
60|$|But it's very important. I {{know that}} you are a {{perfectly}} honest and upright man. If <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> guilty, there is nothing more to be said.|$|E
6000|$|... "That he {{was doing}} it, so much, for me. To what extent," [...] she {{suddenly}} asked of her friend, [...] "do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> aware that she knew?" ...|$|E
6000|$|No, Cinderella, {{you were}} human, that is all. The artist, {{shivering}} in his conventional attic, dreaming of Fame!-do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> not hoping she {{will come to}} his loving arms in the form Jove came to Danae? Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> not reckoning also upon the good dinners and the big cigars, the fur coat and the diamond studs, that her visits will enable him to purchase? ...|$|R
6000|$|Morris {{shook his}} head, though it must <b>be</b> confessed <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a little struck with this idea. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> so sentimental?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nonsense, Maggie! As if any {{one could}} tremble at me! <b>You</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> conceited, I see that. But you don't dislike him, do you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But you haven't told {{us about}} the brave things you did," [...] cooed Mrs. Arty. She appealed to Nelly Croubel: [...] "I'll bet he was a cool one. Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was,</b> Nelly?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Owen," [...] {{answered}} his wife, with beautiful candor, [...] "it was." [...] Seeing that he remained unaffected by her display of this virtue, she added, [...] "Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> very handsome?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, yes; I know." [...] Then {{he would}} remain lost in thought, softly {{whistling}} to himself. On {{one of these}} occasions he asked, [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> really very much troubled by his false position?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! true; who the deuce {{can this}} Colonel be then, for young Jarvis {{is only a}} captain, I know; who do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>is,</b> Jane?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't for {{a moment}} think, dearest, that what he said, made me uneasy as {{regarded}} you: but whom do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> selected for you--of whom do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> jealous?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh yes! And {{where do}} <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>is?</b> At Darminster--editing a paper there. It {{is called the}} Darminster Politician. He said he sent a copy here.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; I know. But {{for a man}} who {{had lived}} in doubt so many years, he {{certainly}} slipped back into the bosom of mother church pretty suddenly. Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a person of rather light feelings?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ran, did he? H'm! Well, it's {{considerably}} {{later than}} his usual {{time to go}} home to his Alfuro wife; but to be seen running is a sort of degradation for Wang, who has mastered the art of vanishing. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> startled out of his perfection by something?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I see he's {{giving you}} a long rope," [...] said the Captain. [...] "But that can't change a man's convictions. I know the Author respects me; I feel it in my bones: when you and I had that talk at the {{blockhouse}} door, who do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> for, my man?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>he</b> {{certainly}} <b>is</b> {{great in}} that feature, one {{is obliged to}} admit it; but--now mind, I'm not really criticising--don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> just a trifle overstrong in technique?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How many of {{his bones}} are there not broken, I wonder?" [...] said the father. [...] "It is useless to talk, of course. <b>You</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> not in danger?" ...|$|R
5000|$|What {{about someone}} who {{believes}} in beautiful things, but doesn't believe in the beautiful itself…? Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> living in a dream rather than a wakened state? (Republic 476c) ...|$|R
6000|$|After this {{dismissal}} had dispersed the on-lookers, Lawson {{turned to}} Curtis. [...] "The old man's {{work as a}} speaker is done. Rather tragic business, don't <b>you</b> <b>think?</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> assailing you with the utmost bitterness. His big, right fist {{was in the air}} like a hammer when he fell; but it was his last effort." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But she doesn't. Mamma isn't {{afraid of}} anything. That's why she lets me play out here alone when I want. Why, {{we had a}} robber once. Mamma got right up and found him. And what do <b>you</b> <b>think!</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> only a poor hungry man. And she got him plenty to eat from the pantry, and {{afterward}} she got him work to do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's the pullin' of that punk graft {{that got}} my goat," [...] replied The General. [...] "I {{never seen a}} punk yet that didn't try to make <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a wise guy an' dis stiff don't belong enough even to pull a spiel that would fool a old ladies' sewin' circle. I don't see wot The Sky Pilot's cozyin' up to him fer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Chloe," [...] I said, as we {{proceeded}} together, [...] "how do {{you find}} Neb? Does he improve by this running about on the ocean--especially do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> tanned?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm glad Herbert has {{got away}} from {{business}} for a few days," [...] she began. [...] "He works too hard, and it's telling on him. How do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> looking?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{you know}} him well, Watson. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> such an inscrutable fellow that I never quite {{know what to make}} of him. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> hopeful? Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> expects to make a success of it?" ...|$|R
60|$|One jump! Would {{he be able}} {{to reach}} it? Two jumps! There was a hole in it! Three jumps! With another frightened squeak, Danny dived into the opening just in time. And what do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> in? Why, an old tomato can Farmer Brown's boy had once used to carry bait in when he went fishing at the Smiling Pool. He had dropped it there on his way home.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{would have}} broken his heart for ever," [...] said Sydney, [...] "if {{he had not}} tried to do his utmost for Jock. He says Jock {{has been more than}} a brother to him, and that he owes all that he is, and all that he has, to him and Mother Carey, and that even-—if-—if he were too late, he should save her from coming home alone. <b>You</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> right, mamma?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mother, I don't {{believe the}} Good Old Man had a grea' deal of courage. All the way Over the Mountains, he'd seem to scare at any little noise, even in broad daylight. Oncet, when we was goin' along through the woods, a pig {{jumped out of}} some hazel-nut bushes, and scared him so that he yelled and fell down in a fit, and they was a good while fetchin' him to. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> God, mother?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Whose child do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>is,</b> then?" [...] said John, {{who had a}} cup {{of water}} in his hand, for the chase after Martin had made him hot, and he wanted cooling.|$|R
6000|$|... "That may be true--whoever you are--but if Lawson's the man <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> he'll begin thet secret {{underground}} bizness. Why, Lawson won't {{sleep of}} nights now. He an' Longstreth {{have always been}} after me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Mr Crich can't see you. He can't {{see you at}} this hour. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> your property, {{that you}} can come {{whenever}} you like? You must go away, there is nothing for you here.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Burnamy and Miss Triscoe gave little heed to the {{landscape}} as landscape. They agreed that the human interest was the great thing on a landscape, after all; but they ignored the peasants {{in the fields and}} meadows, who were no more to them than the driver on the box, or the people in the two-spanner behind. They were talking of the hero and heroine of a novel they had both read, and he was saying, [...] "I suppose <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> justly punished." ...|$|E
60|$|Unc' Billy Possum lay {{curled up}} under the hay in the highest nest in the darkest corner in Farmer Brown's hen-house. Unc' Billy didn't dare go to sleep, because {{he was afraid that}} Farmer Brown's boy might find him. And, anyway, he wanted to see just what Farmer Brown's boy was doing. So peeping out, he watched Farmer Brown's boy, who seemed to be very busy indeed. What do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing? Unc' Billy knew. Yes, Sir, Unc' Billy knew just what Farmer Brown's boy was doing. He was setting traps.|$|E
6000|$|The {{whistling}} stopped. Everything was quiet. Grandfather Frog {{waited and}} listened, {{but not a}} sound could he hear. Then he saw a little ray of light creeping into his prison. He squirmed and pushed, {{and all of a}} sudden he was out of the pocket. The bright light made him blink. As soon as he could see, he looked to see where he was. Then he rubbed his eyes with both hands and looked again. He wasn't at Farmer Brown's house at all. Where do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was?</b> Why, right on the bank of the Smiling Pool, and a little way off was Farmer Brown's boy fishing! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{would see}} through {{that in an}} instant. And if <b>he</b> <b>is</b> still the false {{creature}} <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>is,</b> we owe him the truth, {{more than any other}} kind of man. You must understand that, Basil!" ...|$|R
6000|$|But again, we {{read that}} the Spirit of God takes of the things of Christ, and shows them unto us. And what are the things of Christ? They must be eternal things, {{unchangeable}} things, for Christ is unchangeable--Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> over all, God blessed for ever. To Him all power is given in heaven and earth. He reigns, and He will reign. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>He</b> <b>is</b> less a Saviour now, than <b>He</b> <b>was</b> when <b>He</b> spoke those things to John's disciples? Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>He</b> <b>is</b> less able to hear and to help than <b>He</b> <b>was</b> in John's time? Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>He</b> used to care about people's bodies then, but that He only cares about their souls now? Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>He</b> <b>is</b> less compassionate, and less merciful, as well as less powerful, than <b>He</b> <b>was</b> when <b>He</b> made the blind see, and the lame walk, and the deaf hear, in Judaea of old? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> very pleasant?" [...] Kate Theory asked, {{turning away}} her face from her sister. It was {{important}} that Mildred should not see how little the expression of that charming countenance corresponded with the inquiry.|$|R
