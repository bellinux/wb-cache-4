5|$|On {{the morning}} of September 11, 2001, MacFarlane was {{scheduled}} to return to Los Angeles on American Airlines Flight 11 from Boston. Suffering from a hangover after the previous night's celebrations that followed his speech at his alma mater, the Rhode Island School of Design, and with an incorrect departure time (8:15a.m. instead of 7:45a.m.) from his travel agent, he arrived at Logan International Airport about ten minutes too late to board the flight as the gates had been closed. Fifteen minutes after departure, American Airlines Flight 11 was hijacked, and at 8:46a.m. it was flown into the North Tower of the World Trade Center, killing everyone on board. MacFarlane said,The only reason it hasn't really affected me as it maybe could have is I didn't really know that I was in any danger until after it was over, so I never had that panic moment. After the fact, it was sobering, but people {{have a lot of}} close calls; you're crossing the street and <b>you</b> <b>almost</b> get hit by a car..... this one just happened to be related to something massive. I really can't let it affect me because I'm a comedy writer. I have to put that {{in the back of my}} head.|$|E

500|$|Falle {{uses the}} term [...] "sex trade survivor" [...] to {{describe}} herself. In 2012, Falle sought to bring a lawsuit against her former pimp to demonstrate to other women who are or have been forcibly prostituted {{that it is possible}} to oppose one's pimp. In 2013, she said that, while she has left much aggression and profanity behind since leaving the sex industry, some of the issues that she developed will stick with her until the end of her life. Jonathan Migneault of the Sudbury Star wrote that [...] "Falle's story about her descent in and escape from prostitution is so horrific <b>you</b> <b>almost</b> don't believe the details." [...] Sam Pazzano of the Toronto Sun wrote that, after 12 years of prostitution, Falle still has [...] "attractive looks and [...] sharp mind." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{game was}} {{released}} to [...] "generally favorable" [...] reviews, according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. Critics praised {{the game for}} its usage of elements from older Sonic games. GameSpot, IGN, and Nintendo Power compared the game to older games in the series, specifically those on the Sega Genesis. GameSpy staff writer Greg Sewart offered a similar opinion, also praising the game for its [...] "gorgeous graphics". The game's overall quickness was not as well received. GameSpy's Greg Sewart, although giving a mostly positive review, complained that [...] "it's so fast <b>you</b> <b>almost</b> can't tell what's going {{on most of the}} time." [...] 1UP.com and GamePro thought similarly. The game's music was well-received, called [...] "bright [...] buoyant" [...] by 1UP.com and compared to that of Jet Set Radio by GameSpot. GameSpy called the music [...] "all very fitting and very catchy", noting its use of sampling and unconventional structure.|$|E
500|$|Immediately after (Turn On) The Music Machine was released, {{the band}} left for another U.S. tour, despite pleas {{by the group}} to arrange an {{appearance}} at the Monterey Pop Festival. In the small off-periods in their hard-pressed schedule, the Music Machine demoed a new batch of Bonniwell originals at RCA Studios in New York City and Cosimo Matassa's facility in New Orleans, before polishing the tunes back in Los Angeles. From the sessions emerged the group's third single [...] "Double Yellow Line", which was released in April 1967, and bubbled under the Billboard Hot 100 at number 111. The subsequent release, [...] "Eagle Never Hunts the Fly" [...] failed to chart, but {{is often described as}} Bonniwell's tour de force—a tune Ross praised as [...] "sonically compelling works and a lot to listen to, for the time. It was {{the kind of thing you}} just didn’t hear, <b>you</b> <b>almost</b> worried about getting those sounds onto a 45".|$|E

500|$|The album {{begins with}} a melodic cover of [...] "Strawberry Swing" [...] by English {{alternative}} rock band Coldplay. Connor O'Neill of The Miscellany News writes that the cover begins the album with [...] "so much atmosphere <b>you</b> <b>almost</b> melt into it" [...] and then [...] "spreads you over an apocalyptic swan song". The song ends abruptly with the rude sound of an alarm clock, followed by the [...] "nightmarish" [...] song [...] "Novacane". It {{has been called a}} love song of sorts, with influence taken from alternative hip hop group The Pharcyde. Lyrically the track explores a narrative in which the singer meets a girl attempting to pay her way through dental school by working in porn. Ocean meets the girl at Coachella, a musical festival which takes place in Indio, California. Ocean serves as the protagonist in the song, in love with a girl [...] "so gone on drugs that Ocean, wanting to be close to her, {{has no choice but to}} get gone on those same drugs". The pair get high using dental local anesthetics. Ocean serves as an unreliable narrator.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of the announcement, Horsford said: [...] "With this {{adaptation}} we wanted to stay faithful to the spirit and period of the book, but asked the writer Lizzie to feel free to re-imagine it for a modern audience more familiar with James Bond and Jason Bourne." [...] The production was set around the eve of the First World War and retained other elements from the book, including having the 39 steps refer to steps to a departure point, but according to The Times thriller critic it has [...] "a style that gives more than a nod to the grittier James Bond of Daniel Craig". A piece in The Observer stated that Mickery was [...] "braced for complaints this Christmas from fans of previous screen portrayals", after basing her plot on the original book rather than the films. Differences from the book include the introduction of romance for Hannay, through suffragette and spy Victoria Sinclair, played by Lydia Leonard, and, according to Serena Davies of The Daily Telegraph, [...] "a plot with so many twists and turns <b>you</b> <b>almost</b> need a degree in espionage to follow it".|$|E
500|$|WALL-E went undeveloped {{during the}} 1990s partly because Stanton and Pixar were not {{confident}} enough yet {{to have a}} feature length film with a main character that behaved like Luxo Jr. or R2-D2. Stanton explained {{there are two types}} of robots in cinema: [...] "human with metal skin", like the Tin Man, or [...] "machine with function" [...] like Luxo and R2. He found the latter idea [...] "powerful" [...] because it allowed the audience to project personalities onto the characters, as they do with babies and pets: [...] "You're compelled ... <b>you</b> <b>almost</b> can't stop yourself from finishing the sentence 'Oh, I think it likes me! I think it's hungry! I think it wants to go for a walk!'" [...] He added, [...] "We wanted the audience to believe they were witnessing a machine that has come to life." [...] The animators visited recycling stations to study machinery, and also met robot designers, visited NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory to study robots, watched a recording of a Mars rover, and borrowed a bomb detecting robot from the San Francisco Police Department. Simplicity was preferred in their performances as giving them too many movements would make them feel human.|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} {{is portrayed as}} having created, or at least contributed to, his own reputation. When Gibbs tells Will that Sparrow escaped from a desert island by strapping two sea turtles together, Sparrow embellishes the story by claiming the rope was made from hair from his own back, while in reality, Sparrow escaped the island by bartering with rum traders. The video game [...] bases itself on these tall tales, including the sacking of Nassau port without firing a shot. Depp has likened pirates to rock stars in that their fame preceded them. Sparrow insists on being addressed as [...] "Captain" [...] and often gives the farewell, [...] "This is the day you will always remember as the day that <b>you</b> <b>almost</b> caught Captain Jack Sparrow!" [...] which is sometimes humorously cut off. When Norrington accuses him of being the worst pirate he has ever heard of, Sparrow replies, [...] "But you have heard of me." [...] In a deleted scene from The Curse of the Black Pearl Sparrow ponders being [...] "the immortal Captain Jack Sparrow", and during At World's End he again is interested in immortality, although his father, Captain Teague, warns {{it can be a}} terrible curse. Sparrow ponders being [...] "Captain Jack Sparrow, the last pirate," [...] as the East India Trading Company purges piracy.|$|E
500|$|Kubrick {{was among}} the first {{directors}} to use video assist during filming. At the time he began using it in 1966, it was considered cutting-edge technology, requiring him to build his own system. Having it in place during the filming of 2001, he was able to view a video of a take immediately after it was filmed. On some films, such as Barry Lyndon, he used custom made zoom lenses, which allowed him to start a scene with a close-up and slowly zoom out to capture the full panorama of scenery and to film long takes under changing outdoor lighting conditions by making aperture adjustments while the cameras rolled. LoBrutto notes that Kubrick's technical knowledge about lenses [...] "dazzled the manufacturer's engineers, who found him to be unprecedented among contemporary filmmakers". For Barry Lyndon he also used a specially adapted high-speed (f/0.7) Zeiss camera lens, originally developed for NASA, to shoot numerous scenes lit only with candlelight. Actor Steven Berkoff recalls that Kubrick wanted scenes to be shot using [...] "pure candlelight", and in doing so Kubrick [...] "made a unique contribution to the art of filmmaking going back to painting... <b>You</b> <b>almost</b> posed like for portraits." [...] LoBrutto notes that cinematographers all over the world wanted to know about Kubrick's [...] "magic lens" [...] and that he became a [...] "legend" [...] among cameramen around the world.|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} highly positive {{reviews from}} critics and the style {{has been compared}} to that of West's The College Dropout album. Pitchfork Media's Tom Breiham praised the song, saying [...] "Jay and Kanye trade off verses and never pause for a chorus, each one building on whatever the last one said-- an old-school rap-collab style <b>you</b> <b>almost</b> never hear anymore. And since these guys are working loose and casual, it gives them chances to show how funny and clever they are without telegraphing their own importance. Simon Vozick-Levinson of Rolling Stone gave the song a four stars rating out of five wrote that [...] "West twists a few seconds of Otis Redding's [...] "Try a Little Tenderness" [...] into a Blueprint-style barrage, setting the stage for some slick collar-popping from Jay-Z ("Photo shoot fresh, looking like wealth / I'm about to call the paparazzi on myself"). Jay's performance, in turn, inspires Ye to step up his wordplay ("Luxury rap, the Hermes of verses / Sophisticated ignorance, write my curses in cursive"); the younger star sounds like he pulled an all-nighter trying to outdo his mentor's rhymes." [...] Frank Berg of NME gave the song a mostly positive review, stating that [...] "What we have here are two titans of black music duetting with another from beyond the grave. For that reason, it's unquestionably An Event", though feeling [...] "In all honesty, if this winds up being the highlight of Watch the Throne we'll all be a bit disappointed." ...|$|E

500|$|Hal Hinson of The Washington Post {{gave the}} {{character}} a negative review. Labeling Timon and Pumbaa the only interesting characters in The Lion King, Hinson questioned Simba's {{role as the}} film's hero. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times agreed, [...] "A movie's heroes may have their names above the title, but often as not it's the sidekicks who get the real work done." [...] Turan went on to pan Simba, describing him as [...] "irritatingly callow." [...] Chris Hick of the Deseret News complained {{about the fact that}} Simba and the other [...] "characters in The Lion King are not as warm and fuzzy as other Disney animated features," [...] crediting this with making [...] "the film a bit tougher to warm [...] to." [...] ComingSoon.net strongly panned Simba as a lead character, writing, [...] "typically for Disney animated fare, it's the hero who is the weak link being both blandly designed and blandly performed." [...] Acknowledging the character's Shakespearean origins, The Baltimore Suns Stephen Hunter gave Simba a negative review, writing, [...] "Alas ...Simba stands in for Hamlet, but he's a lot less complicated; in fact, he's less complicated than Morris the Cat or Sylvester." [...] Hunter continued, [...] "Simba the Exile is even less interesting than Simba the Prince." [...] Christopher Null of Contactmusic.com was critical of Weaver's performance as the singing voice of Young Simba, writing, [...] "If there's anything annoying about the film, it's the singing. Young Simba sounds like a young Michael Jackson ... <b>You</b> <b>almost</b> don't want him to succeed." [...] However, Null reacted more positively towards Broderick's performance.|$|E
500|$|In {{his first}} year with Dorsey, Sinatra {{recorded}} over forty songs. Sinatra's first vocal hit was the song [...] "Polka Dots and Moonbeams" [...] in late April 1940. Two more chart appearances followed with [...] "Say It" [...] and [...] "Imagination", which was Sinatra's first top-10 hit. His fourth chart appearance was [...] "I'll Never Smile Again", topping the charts for twelve weeks beginning in mid-July. Other records with Tommy Dorsey issued by RCA Victor include [...] "Our Love Affair" [...] and [...] "Stardust" [...] in 1940; [...] "Oh! Look at Me Now", [...] "Dolores", [...] "Everything Happens to Me" [...] and [...] "This Love of Mine" [...] in 1941; [...] "Just as Though You Were There", [...] "Take Me" [...] and [...] "There Are Such Things" [...] in 1942; and [...] "It Started All Over Again", [...] "In the Blue of Evening" [...] and [...] "It's Always You" [...] in 1943. As his success and popularity grew, Sinatra pushed Dorsey {{to allow him to}} record some solo songs. Dorsey eventually relented, and on January 19, 1942, Sinatra recorded [...] "Night and Day", [...] "The Night We Called It a Day", [...] "The Song is You" [...] and [...] "Lamplighter's Serenade" [...] at a Bluebird recording session, with Axel Stordahl as arranger and conductor. Sinatra first heard the recordings at the Hollywood Palladium and Hollywood Plaza and was astounded at how good he sounded. Stordahl recalled: [...] "He just couldn't believe his ears. He was so excited, <b>you</b> <b>almost</b> believed he had never recorded before. I think this was a turning point in his career. I think he began to see what he might do on his own".|$|E
500|$|During the off-season, the Capitals {{made several}} player changes. One {{of the players}} that was not {{retained}} by the team, Matt Bradley, started a controversy with his comments from a radio interview in Ottawa. In the interview, Bradley said his former team was [...] "a little bit too nonchalant and guys weren’t disciplined the way they should have been," [...] which he claimed were the two biggest reasons why the team {{was not able to}} advance past {{the second round of the}} Stanley Cup playoffs. He later stated that Head Coach Bruce Boudreau did not give the most ice time to players who were playing well, but went with his star players. He further noted that Boudreau was a [...] "great coach" [...] who had been put in a tough position. When asked to point out examples, Bradley stated that Alexander Semin [...] "could easily be the best player in the league," [...] but he [...] "just doesn’t care," [...] further noting, [...] "When you've got a guy like that, you need him to be your best player, or one of your best players, and when he doesn't show up, <b>you</b> <b>almost</b> get the sense that he wants to be back in Russia." [...] Semin's agent came to his client's defense, stating he [...] "always cares." [...] Teammate Mike Knuble noted that because Semin speaks limited English, the language barrier affects the way that he is perceived, further noting that the interview comments were something Bradley regretted. When asked about the comments, former Capitals forward David Steckel stated that, [...] "It's not like he went out and told lies." [...] Bradley later apologized for his comments in an interview with the Sun Sentinel.|$|E

500|$|After {{the release}} of the video, critics commented on the {{resemblance}} between Rihanna's ex-boyfriend Chris Brown and her fictional love interest in the video, Dudley O'Shaughnessy, and how the video's content appeared to be somewhat of a reenactment of the assault upon Rihanna by Brown on the evening of the 2009 Grammy Awards. Chris Doplan of Consequence of Sound said that O'Shaughnessy strongly resembled Brown in his appearance. Amanda Dobbins of New York magazine concurred with Doplan, and wrote that O'Shaughnessy has short blond hair like Brown once had. Erika Ramirez of Billboard magazine also thought that O'Shaughnessy's character is a depiction of Brown, especially in relation to the scene which features the couple in a car, with O'Shaughnessy driving recklessly and Rihanna begging him to stop. William Goodman of Spin provided an analysis of the video with regard to the Brown comparisons. Like many reviewers, he noted the resemblance between Brown and O'Shaughnessy, writing [...] "The clip stars a dead ringer for Brown, complete with dyed hair and bulging biceps". Goodman commented upon the video's opening narration, which was actually voiced by Agyness Deyn, [...] "The video opens with a Rihanna voice-over that warns, 'You almost feel ashamed that someone could be that important. No one will ever understand how much it hurts... <b>you</b> <b>almost</b> wish that you could have all that bad stuff back, so that you have the good." [...] In conclusion, Goodman commented that [...] the scene showing an altercation in a car is reminiscent of Brown's assault on Rihanna, which occurred inside a car. Goodman wrote: [...] "during a heated argument between the couple in a muscle car, the Brown look-alike gives the Barbadian beauty a slap on the face. Convinced yet?" ...|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film {{four out of}} four stars, calling it [...] "one of those rare movies where I wanted {{to sit in the}} front row and let the images wash out to the edges of my field of vision". Broadway star Nathan Lane, who was the voice of Timon the meerkat in The Lion King, has said Finding Nemo was his {{favorite}} animated film. Ed Park of The Village Voice gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "It's an ocean of eye candy that tastes fresh even in this ADD-addled era of SpongeBob SquarePants." [...] Mark Caro of the Chicago Tribune gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "You connect to these sea creatures as you rarely do with humans in big-screen adventures. The result: a true sunken treasure." [...] Hazel-Dawn Dumpert of L.A. Weekly gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "As gorgeous a film as Disney's ever put out, with astonishing qualities of light, movement, surface and color at the service of the best professional imaginations money can buy." [...] Jeff Strickler of the Star Tribune gave the film a positive review, saying it [...] "proves that even when Pixar is not at the top of its game, it still produces better animation than some of its competitors on their best days." [...] Gene Seymour of Newsday gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "The underwater backdrops take your breath away. No, really. They're so lifelike, <b>you</b> <b>almost</b> feel like holding your breath while watching." [...] Rene Rodriguez of the Miami Herald gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "Parental anxiety may not be the kind of stuff children's films are usually made of, but this perfectly enchanting movie knows how to cater to its kiddie audience without condescending to them." ...|$|E
500|$|Television {{columnist}} Alan Sepinwall for HitFix {{reported that}} despite [...] "Reaganing" [...] {{not being a}} perfect episode it was still [...] "a very good one in what's so far... been a very strong rebound season for 30 Rock." [...] Juli Weiner of Vanity Fair wrote, [...] "the episode was quick, sharp, and consistent". Meredith Blake of the Los Angeles Times enjoyed Tracy's plot here, noting that his attempts to deliver a single line was highly entertaining. The Cornell Daily Suns Scott Eidler said that Jenna and Kenneth's subplot [...] "wasn't laugh-out-loud funny", nonetheless [...] "it was a nice realistic turn for characterization!" [...] Johnny Firecloud of CraveOnline deemed [...] "Reaganing" [...] an excellent episode from the series. Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club was positive about Jenna and Kenneth's story, noting it went from amusing to hilarious. He was not [...] "overly blown away" [...] with Liz's plot, but said it redeemed itself at the end [...] "by providing another nice moment of connection" [...] between the Jack and Liz characters. Rabin gave [...] "Reaganing" [...] a B+ grade, praising the (non-existent) scene where Jack put pills into Tracy's jelly beans. Samantha Urban of The Dallas Morning News said that {{the best part of}} the episode was Jack McBrayer's Kenneth [...] "actually [...] some funny lines for the first time [...]" [...] The Fordham Rams Celeste Kmiotek said that the episode was [...] "perhaps more awkward than normal... but it was nonetheless hilarious, and was tempered by its ability to throw cultural references into everything until <b>you</b> <b>almost</b> forget what is actually being discussed." [...] Entertainment Weekly contributor Annie Barrett liked Kelsey Grammer's appearance, but mostly enjoyed the fact that 30 Rock devoted an episode to Tina Fey's character as [...] "the sexual equivalent of a million Hindenburgs" [...] and was pleased with the numerous Liz flashbacks from past episodes that were featured here.|$|E
