[...] The Era admired [...] "the sepulchral tones, the glaring eyeballs, the long hair, the wonderful 'stage walk', the melodramatic attitudes" [...] of his portrayal. [...] He next appeared in The Hornet's Nest by Byron at the Haymarket. [...] The Crushed Tragedian {{was not a}} great success in London, but it became a hit in New York. [...] The Philadelphia Inquirer raved, [...] "With what elaboration of detail does the actor embody his conception! There is not a gesture, not an intonation, not a movement, but seems to illustrate the character portrayed. He strides across the stage and {{it is as though}} he were wading through a sea of gore; he mutters to himself ‘Ha! ha!’ and <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is cursing fate with a bitterness loud and deep. always and in all things poor Altamont is exquisitely, indescribably ludicrous." [...] In April 1879, he was still at the Haymarket, appearing in Lord Lytton's play Money as Sir Frederick Blount.|$|E

6000|$|... "But you let {{him take}} it. <b>You</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> meant to visit Klara, and that Leopold was on the watch outside. Yet {{you let him}} go. [...] . . ." ...|$|R
