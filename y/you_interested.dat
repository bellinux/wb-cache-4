500|$|In 2007, Disney {{began to}} {{negotiate}} with Joseph Kosinski to direct Tron: Legacy. Kosinski admitted that at the time, he was not keen on the idea but it later grew on him as time progressed. Kosinski {{was involved in a}} meeting with Bailey, president of Walt Disney Pictures. [...] "Disney owns the property, Tron," [...] Bailey stated. [...] "Do you know it? Are <b>you</b> <b>interested?</b> What would your take be? In a post-Matrix world, how do {{you go back to the}} world of Tron?" [...] Kosinski wanted to embrace the general ambiance of the film, and wished to not use the internet as a model or use a formula emulative of The Matrix film series. As neither individuals were in equal agreement on choosing a perspective to conceive the film, Kosinski asked Bailey to lend him money in order to create a conceptual prototype of the Tron: Legacy universe, which was eventually presented at the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con International. [...] "So, we went into Disney," [...] he recalled, [...] "and I told them, 'We can talk about this all day, but in order to really get on the same page, I need to show you what this world looks and feels like. Give me some money and let me do a small test that will give you a hint for a couple minutes of it, and see what you think.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Director Ricky Lau {{wanted a}} fresh-faced girl whom people were {{unfamiliar}} with {{to play the}} role of Mr Yam's daughter so he avoided choosing a well-known actress. He spotted dancer Moon Lee at a performance and approached her and asked [...] "Are <b>you</b> <b>interested</b> in acting as you'd fit into a part I have?" ...|$|E

2500|$|In a May 2017 {{interview}} with Rockbook, frontman James LaBrie stated that Dream Theater plans to release their fourteenth studio album in 2018. He commented: [...] "We're pretty psyched because {{we already know}} what we're gonna do. But I'm not gonna tell you. It's really important for us that the new album will be our best effort. It should be who we are at that particular moment. We still want to create something that's better than what we did before. That's what keeps <b>you</b> <b>interested</b> in what you do. But if along the way we {{feel that there is}} another album we should recognize once again, then we'll do it." [...] LaBrie also stated that the band will concentrate on [...] "one album at a time and not thinking in a concept", and added, [...] "Unless we wanna write an epic song that has multiple parts in it. Doing something like that might be cool. Something like A Change of Seasons. But a whole album again, no." [...] The album is currently slated for early 2019.|$|E
2500|$|Stuart's career {{advanced}} when English director James Whale chose her for {{the glamour}} role as a sentimental wife who winds up stranded among strangers at a spooky mansion in his ensemble cast (Boris Karloff, Melvyn Douglas, Charles Laughton, Lilian Bond, Ernest Thesiger, Eva Moore and Raymond Massey) for The Old Dark House (1932). The film was critically praised, and The New York Times called Stuart's performance [...] "clever and charming," [...] with the movie later becoming a cult classic. Stuart's experience filming The Old Dark House also became integral {{to the formation of}} the Screen Actors Guild in 1933: [...] "James [...] joined all the English actors,” Stuart recalled. “So {{on one side of the}} set they had their ‘elevensies’ and `foursies,’ and Melvyn [...] and I would be sitting together, not invited. One day, Melvyn said to me, `Are <b>you</b> <b>interested</b> in forming a union together?’ I said, ‘What’s a union?’ He said, ‘Like in New York – Actor’s Equity. The actors get together and work for better working conditions.’ I said, ‘Oh wonderful,’ because I was getting up at five every morning; in makeup at seven, in hair at eight, wardrobe at quarter of nine, and then sometimes if production wanted you to, you worked until four or five the next morning. There was no overtime. They fed us when they felt like it, when it was convenient for production. It was really very, very hard work." [...] After filming completed, Stuart began canvassing, and was one of the union's first founding members.|$|E
