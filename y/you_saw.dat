5|$|Madonna looks both {{older and}} younger than she does in the photos and the videos: a little more lined and {{possibly}} tired, but also less mature and grand. Her manner is quite teenaged, not femme fatale. She seems up for mischief, and yet quite conscious of her power. At the same time, her very frankness is almost innocent. These combinations are odd, and they give her {{the air of a}} prematurely wise child. Her current style is 1930s Hollywood meets early 1970s flash: Jean Harlow and Angie Bowie. She is not bewitching, but is certainly beautiful. She wears the nose stud that so troubled Norman Mailer in a recent interview. If <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> her in the street, you'd think: she looks like a girl who looks a bit like Madonna.|$|E

I think it was exciting, {{especially}} to participate and experience it with them like that. Me and B have a good relationship.

25|$|Feeling of Knowing (FOK) {{judgments}} {{refer to}} the predictions {{of being able to}} retrieve specific information an individual makes, regarding his or her knowledge for a specific subject, more specifically whether that knowledge exists within memory. These judgments are made either prior to the memory target being found or following a failed attempt to locate the target. Consequently, FOK judgments focus not on the actual answer to a question, but rather on whether an individual predicts that he or she does or does not know the answer (high and low FOK ratings respectively). FOK judgments can also be made regarding the likelihood of remembering information later on and have proven to give fairly accurate indications of future memory. An example of FOK is if you can't remember the answer when someone asks you what city you're traveling to, but you feel that you would recognize the name if <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> it on a map of the country.|$|E

500|$|Cooper's {{style of}} underplaying before the camera {{surprised}} {{many of his}} directors and fellow actors. Even in his earliest feature films, he recognized the camera's ability to pick up slight gestures and facial movements. Commenting on Cooper's performance in Sergeant York, director Howard Hawks observed, [...] "He worked very hard and yet he didn't seem to be working. He was a strange actor because you'd look at him during a scene and you'd think ... this isn't {{going to be any}} good. But when <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> the rushes in the projection room the next day you could read in his face all the things he'd been thinking." [...] Sam Wood, who directed Cooper in four films, had similar observations about Cooper's performance in Pride of the Yankees, noting, [...] "What I thought was underplaying turned out to be just the right approach. On the screen he's perfect, yet on the set you'd swear it's the worst job of acting in the history of motion pictures." [...] His fellow actors also admired his abilities as an actor. Commenting on her two films playing opposite Cooper, actress Ingrid Bergman concluded, [...] "The personality of this man was so enormous, so overpowering—and that expression in his eyes and his face, it was so delicate and so underplayed. You just didn't notice it until <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> it on the screen. I thought he was marvelous; the most underplaying and the most natural actor I ever worked with." ...|$|E

500|$|Standing [...] {{tall and}} {{weighing}} , Perry was small {{for a typical}} fullback, even during his era. Also unlike typical fullbacks, Perry's forte was not to run with power, but rather he was a straight-ahead runner who combined power and speed with deceptive elusiveness. His role was primarily as a ball carrier rather than a blocker, {{and he had a}} knack for finding holes in opposing defensive lines. [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> a hole, you take it," [...] Perry described his running style to The Sacramento Bee. [...] "If you didn't, you kept moving until you did. You run with instinct." [...] Perry was known for his speed, which earned him the nickname [...] "The Jet". He ran the 100-yard dash in 9.5 seconds in 1947, two-tenths of a second slower than Mel Patton's then-world record of 9.3 seconds.|$|E
