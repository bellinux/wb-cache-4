It is native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa, and it is known on other continents as an {{introduced}} species. It is an annual herb. It has leaves made up of several pairs of oblong or linear leaflets each 1 to 2 centimeters long. It produces solitary flowers or clusters of up to 3 flowers with yellow or purple-tinged corollas up to 3 centimeters in length.|$|E

In the bottoms, over the water and over the lush wet grass, the night mist still stood white and substantial. As I passed {{along the edge of}} the meadow the cow-parsnip was as tall as I, frothing up to the top of the hedge, putting the faded hawthorn to a wan blush. Little, early birds—I had not heard the lark—fluttered in and out of the foamy meadow-sea, plunging under the surf of flowers washed high in one corner, swinging out again, dashing past the crimson sorrel cresset. Under the froth of flowers were the purple vetch-clumps, <b>yellow</b> milk <b>vetches,</b> and the scattered pink of the wood-betony, and the floating stars of marguerites. There was a weight of honeysuckle on the hedges, where pink roses were waking up for their broad-spread flight through the day.|$|R

Over the last few years, onion bulb mites have increased as a problem. Some growers suspect mites over-winter on the traditional grass cover crops of oats and barley. In 2001, we planted and evaluated five different fall planted broad leaf cover crops. The fall planted covers we looked at were annual crimson clover, field peas, <b>yellow</b> mustard, hairy <b>vetch</b> and buckwheat. Two growers in the onion growing region of Orange County and one grower from Oswego participated in those trials. Fields were one acre, divided into one-fifth of an acre plots. We evaluated ease of establishment, root depth and bio mass. Growers were favorably impressed with the yellow mustard and the field peas. Yellow mustard for it’s quick establishment and field peas because it continued growing well into winter and established a dense ground cover...|$|R
40|$|Cover {{cropping}} systems {{may help to}} improve agroecosystems, through decreased soil erosion, improved soil fertility, promotion of beneficial insects and reduced weed competition. If these benefits are realized they can improve the sustainability of the system, as cycling, diversity, stability and capacity are enhanced. These changes bring the system to more closely resemble natural systems. Within three experimental years, hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth.), fall rye (Secale cereale L.), yellow sweet clover (Melilotus officinalis L.) and white clover (Trifolium repens L.) were grown as cover crops with cauliflower (Brassica oleracea L. var. botrytis), and compared to monoculture cauliflower. In {{an effort to reduce}} competition between the cauliflower and cover crops, the cover crops were either mowed or rototilled prior to transplanting the cauliflower. The effects of the cover crops on weeds, allelopathy, cabbage and turnip root flies (Delia radicum L. and D. floralis Fall.), beneficial arthropods and cauliflower yield were investigated. Monoculture and rototilled hairy vetch plots showed the highest number of weeds throughout the experiment. Mowed plots showed the lowest weed densities. None of the experimental treatments tested (rototilled hairy <b>vetch,</b> <b>yellow</b> sweet clover and white clover and mowed white clover) showed significant allelopathic potential. In 2000, the number of cabbage and turnip root fly eggs was not significantl...|$|R
