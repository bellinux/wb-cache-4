5|$|Leroux {{was one of}} 21 {{professional}} athletes featured in ESPN's The Body Issue in 2013. She appeared semi-nude on one of eight covers for the magazine. Of the experience she said, I {{think a lot of}} females struggle with the way they look, and I wanted to show that everyone's body is different. I think it's a big deal to be an athlete and feel confident in <b>your</b> <b>body</b> and show it off. I'm not going to say I've never struggled with how I look, but I've reached a point in my life where I'm happy with who I am.|$|E

25|$|When {{different}} {{materials are}} brought {{together and then}} separated, an accumulation of electric charge can occur which leaves one material positively charged while the other becomes negatively charged. The mild shock that you receive when touching a grounded object after walking on carpet {{is an example of}} excess electrical charge accumulating in <b>your</b> <b>body</b> from frictional charging between your shoes and the carpet. The resulting charge build-up upon <b>your</b> <b>body</b> can generate a strong electrical discharge. Although experimenting with static electricity may be fun, similar sparks create severe hazards in those industries dealing with flammable substances, where a small electrical spark may ignite explosive mixtures with devastating consequences.|$|E

25|$|Stance width helps {{determine}} the rider's {{balance on the}} board. The size of the rider {{is an important factor}} as well as the style of their riding when determining a proper stance width. A common measurement used for new riders is to position the bindings so that the feet are placed a little wider than shoulder width apart. Another, less orthodox form of measurement may be taken by putting your feet together and place your hands, palm down, on the ground in a straight line with <b>your</b> <b>body</b> by squatting down. This generally gives a good natural measurement for how wide of a base <b>your</b> <b>body</b> uses to properly balance itself when knees are bent. However, personal preference and comfort are important and most experienced riders will adjust the stance width to personal preference. Skateboarders should find that their snowboarding and skateboarding stance widths are relatively similar.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} things to take into consideration when either trying to lose or put on weight is output versus input. It is important to know the amount of energy <b>your</b> <b>body</b> is using every day, so that your intake fits the needs of one's personal weight goal. Someone wanting to lose weight would want a smaller energy intake than what they put out. There is increasing research-based evidence that low-fat vegetarian diets consistently lead to healthy weight loss and management, a decrease in diabetic symptoms as well as improved cardiac health.|$|E

500|$|The {{lyrics of}} the {{original}} song were switched to fit the cause. The new lyrics include the line: [...] "A little sweat ain’t hurt nobody [...] Don't just stand there on the wall, everybody just move <b>your</b> <b>body,</b> move <b>your</b> <b>body,</b> move your body." [...] The song is a step-by-step flash dance-style workout that combines elements of hip hop music, Latin music as well as dancehall moves with traditional exercise. Nicole James of MTV Buzzworthy described [...] "Move Your Body" [...] as a [...] "kid-friendlier" [...] version {{of the original}}. Risa Dixon of Newsday praised the reworked version, calling it [...] "a fun, yet cardio-intensive workout song to get young people excited about exercising." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{the death}} of the Emperor, appeals for the {{repatriation}} of his body increased over time.

[...] The Gazeta da Tarde (Afternoon Gazette) said that PedroII deserved an official funeral within the country. In 1895, Afonso Celso wrote in the Comércio de São Paulo (Commerce of São Paulo): [...] "The body of D. Pedro cannot continue to lie in foreign territory." [...] By 1906 the poet Olavo Bilac wrote, [...] "The fatherland reclaims <b>your</b> <b>body</b> and it shall have it." [...] The Jornal do Comércio (Commerce Newspaper) predicted that [...] "one day, when all passions have lost their strength, <b>your</b> <b>body</b> shall rest here." ...|$|E

500|$|Their debut album, <b>Your</b> <b>Body</b> Above Me, co-produced by David Bianco and the band, was {{released}} on October 21, 1997 in the United States. Two singles from the album charted in the U.S., the power ballad [...] "Time Ago" [...] and the alternative rock hit [...] "Wash It Away"; the album also featured the PJ Harvey-penned [...] "All the Money in the World". The LP peaked on Billboard's Heatseekers charts at No.19 in 1998, and sales of the album eventually topped 120,000. Reviews of <b>Your</b> <b>Body</b> Above Me noted the album's dark, melodic modern rock sound, and were mixed but generally positive. The Washington Post called <b>Your</b> <b>Body</b> Above Me [...] "moodily sumptuous", Guitar Player described the music as having [...] "drama and rhythmic urgency", and Allmusic noted the album's [...] "brooding yet propulsive sound that's actually quite intriguing". The band subsequently toured with Days of the New, Cracker, and Our Lady Peace, and were called [...] "The American U2" [...] by the San Francisco Chronicle. Black Lab songs were featured on soundtracks to Can't Hardly Wait, Varsity Blues, Permanent Midnight, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and the song [...] "Wash It Away" [...] was also included on a charity album, Live in the X Lounge. Just as momentum was building on their debut, however, Geffen {{went out of business}} after being subsumed by Universal; dissatisfied with the new label arrangement, Durham moved to Los Angeles, and the band broke up in 1999.|$|E
500|$|They and {{the episode}} writers {{developed}} a storyline {{in which a}} victim's childhood experimentation, when they were injected with something, was now [...] "coming back to haunt them." [...] Whitman noted that the concept, like others in the show, was based on real scientific knowledge, [...] "The notion is, {{some kind of a}} medical treatment that they were given allowed their brain to command vibrations that would take place. It really is true that essentially what heat is is vibrations of atoms, so if your brain can cause some kind of vibration to take place, eventually you could create enough heat to even create a flame." [...] Pinkner added, [...] "And if you haven't yet mastered pyrokinesis and the ability to excite molecules that are outside <b>your</b> <b>body,</b> well then you're going to excite the ones inside <b>your</b> <b>body</b> and you're going to blow up, sadly." ...|$|E
