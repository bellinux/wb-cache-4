500|$|Critics {{compared}} [...] "Hate That I Love You" [...] {{to previous}} works by Ne-Yo. Nick Levine from Digital Spy called the song a [...] "second cousin" [...] of Ne-Yo's singles [...] "Sexy Love" [...] and [...] "Because of You". Regarding the lyrics, Rihanna said, [...] "When you're {{in love with}} someone, even though they keep hurting you, you're so naive and <b>you</b> <b>love</b> <b>them</b> {{so much that you}} put all the negative behind even though you keep getting hurt." ...|$|E
500|$|The lyrics, {{according}} to Brown are about relationships, {{and to be}} there for each other. That it does not matter to say merely that <b>you</b> <b>love</b> <b>them,</b> the only thing that they care is that their lover give his promise that he will be there for them whenever they need him. In [...] "Say You'll Be There", the group exuded a brash confidence that was attractive to their teenage and young adult fans. The Spice Girls decide to be friends, not lovers, the clear message is that the relationship can be channelled and controlled by the girl, with an emphasis on stating where they come from and what they stand for.|$|E

500|$|... "Loving You No More" [...] first leaked {{under the}} title [...] "Hurt" [...] on November 13, 2009. After being {{announced}} as the second single from Last Train to Paris on August 26, 2010, the mastered version of the song was leaked. In an interview with MTV News, Diddy explained the meaning behind the song, commenting, [...] "The concept of the song is about when you love somebody {{so much that you}} forget about yourself. <b>You</b> <b>love</b> <b>them</b> more than you love yourself." [...] The song's official remix, released on October 22, 2010, features American rappers Gucci Mane and Red Cafe. Producer and rapper Jermaine Dupri also remixed the song with rap vocals from him, which was unveiled on September 29, 2010. The group performed the song on one occasion, during their takeover of 106 & Park to promote the album, on December 16, 2010.|$|E
500|$|... "The {{ultimate}} thing {{behind the}} song {{is that if you}} don't express yourself, if you don't say what you want, then you're not going to get it. And in effect you are chained down by your inability to say what you feel or go after what you want. No matter how in control you think are about sexuality in a relationship there is always the power struggle... always a certain amount of compromise. Of being beholden, if <b>you</b> <b>love</b> <b>them.</b> You do it because you choose to. No one put the chain around this neck but me. I wrote 'Express Yourself' to tell women around the world that pick and choose the best for yourself, before that chain around your neck, kills you instead. It's my take on how man can express what they want, the same prerogative should be there for a woman too." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{the show}} progresses, Alex and Ryan's romance evolves into a {{relationship}}. When Alex confesses that her only motive {{to join the}} Academy was {{to find out the}} truth about her father and was about to leave, Ryan makes her realize that she is meant to be an agent. Alex's on-again off-again relationship with Ryan has been described by Chopra as star-crossed. She said [...] "Alex and Ryan are star-crossed lovers. <b>You</b> <b>love</b> <b>them</b> and they fight and have this intense passionate bond. But Alex is also a little self-destructive. She's a solitary person and she's not vulnerable enough, whereas Ryan really is. She's a little rough around the edges and whatever's happened in the past, she has trust issues. So that leads to issues in their relationship." [...] Fans have dubbed Alex and Ryan [...] "Ralex". On being asked about the possibility of having to choose between Ryan and saving the world, Chopra said [...] "I'm pretty sure she'd pick saving the world, because she's that kind of person." ...|$|E

500|$|Nick Keppler, {{writing for}} Nerve.com, listed [...] "The Host" [...] {{as one of}} the [...] "gayest" [...] episodes of the {{franchise}} and described the twist {{at the end of the}} episode with the gender of Odan's new host as [...] "sapphic". He criticised the reaction of Crusher at the end of the episode, saying that she would [...] "get into bed with shifty aliens with weird ridged foreheads but for some reason draws the line at space ladies". Zack Handlen gave the episode a rating of B+ in his review for The A.V. Club, saying that the idea at the core of the episode was better than the execution. But he said that the ending made [...] "perfect sense" [...] as he said that love wasn't solely spirtual but that [...] "we fall in love with features, with shapes, with bodies, as well as with minds."

500|$|In the film, Carey's {{character}} Billie Frank argues {{with her}} boyfriend and producer Dice (Max Beesley) and they break-up. Her emotional pain leads her to solo songwriting. Dice also misses Billie, and also begins writing a song. Billie goes to Dice's apartment {{in an attempt to}} reconcile. He was not home, but the music he has written is and Billie realizes they wrote the same song: [...] "Never Too Far". She kisses the sheet music, leaving a lipstick imprint, which Dice later discovers. Dice plans a reconciliation, but is killed by Billie's former producer Timothy Walker (Terrence Howard) after Dice did not pay the US$100,000 from their agreement to release Billie from Walker's contract. At Billie's first show at Madison Square Garden, her management and support crew see a report of the murder on television. They wonder if Billie was with him, they see that she is there and has seen the report. Billie onstage commands the band to stop playing [...] "Loverboy", tells the crowd never to take someone for granted, and that if <b>you</b> <b>love</b> <b>them,</b> you should tell them, because you might never have the chance to tell them how you really feel. She then starts to sing [...] "Never Too Far".|$|E
500|$|Whedon {{chose the}} most {{complicated}} scene, with the most dancers and choreography in the classic style of musical theater, to accompany an 18-second song ("The Mustard") [...] "to {{get it out of}} the way" [...] for more personal numbers later in the episode. Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com considers this [...] "brilliant because it frees even people who hate musicals to settle into the story without getting hung up on the genre's conventions". The musical styles span from a jaunty 1950s sitcom arrangement of the Buffy theme in the opening credits—the only episode in the series to begin without the normal version of the theme song and full cast roll, signifying a genre shift—to Anya's hard-rock version of [...] "Bunnies". Whedon assigned Emma Caulfield the rock-opera format because Caulfield often sang in such a way to him on the set. Spike's [...] "Rest in Peace" [...] is also a rock song, which Whedon wrote after completing the episode's first song, Tara's [...] "Under Your Spell", a contemporary pop song with radio-play potential. Xander and Anya's duet—the most fun to shoot but difficult to write, according to Whedon—is inspired by Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers comedies as evidenced by the silken pajama costumes and art deco apartment setting. Musically, the song uses influences from Ira Gershwin, a Charleston rhythm, and jazz-like chord slides. Giles' [...] "Standing" [...] is a ballad to Buffy that she does not hear, unlike the songs revealing truths elsewhere in the episode. Whedon shot the scene so that Giles moves in real time while Buffy works out in slow motion, to accentuate Giles' distance from her. Buffy's not hearing his song was intentional; Whedon explained, [...] "You can sing to someone in musicals and they can never know how you feel or how much <b>you</b> <b>love</b> <b>them,</b> even if they're standing right in front of you".|$|E

2500|$|Commenting on the result, Graham Bartram, chief vexillologist at the Flag Institute, {{told the}} BBC: [...] "There's often a {{fundamental}} misunderstanding of flags by politicians. It isn't the design {{but what it}} shows about their history and means to them. Saying you like a flag because of its design is like saying you like your family because they are all handsome or beautiful. <b>You</b> <b>love</b> <b>them</b> because of who they are, unconditionally.

2500|$|... "Love {{the creatures}} {{for the sake}} of God and not for themselves. You will never become angry or {{impatient}} if <b>you</b> <b>love</b> <b>them</b> {{for the sake of}} God. Humanity is not perfect. There are imperfections in every human being, and you will always become unhappy if you look toward the people themselves. But if you look toward God, you will love them and be kind to them, for the world of God is the world of perfection and complete mercy. Therefore, do not look at the shortcomings of anybody; see with the sight of forgiveness." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although {{many believe}} it was created because of the Silver Jubilee, the band denies it, Paul Cook saying that [...] "It wasn't written {{specifically}} for the Queen's Jubilee. We weren't aware {{of it at the}} time. It wasn't a contrived effort to go out and shock everyone." [...] Johnny Rotten has explained the lyrics as follows: [...] "You don't write 'God Save The Queen' because you hate the English race. You write a song like that because <b>you</b> <b>love</b> <b>them,</b> and you're fed up with them being mistreated." [...] He intended to evoke sympathy for the English working class, and a general resentment towards the monarchy.|$|E

5000|$|Although the Bible's lessons {{have been}} paraphrased for {{hundreds}} of years, the modern phrase, [...] "Spare the rod and spoil the child," [...] was coined by Samuel Butler, in Hudibras, a mock heroic narrative poem published in 1663.

2500|$|Ros-Lehtinen {{has been}} a notable Republican voice in favor of LGBT rights.

It’s important {{to listen to your}} children, accept your children and have your children know that <b>you</b> <b>love</b> <b>them</b> unconditionally. It’s not “I love you, but…”—there’s [...] no “but.” “It’s just “I love you.” … To do otherwise is—you’re hurting yourself, you’re going to shun your child or grandchild. You’re going to say, “No, I have my views and my views are the perfect views and no one can have a different point of view. I’m right and everything else is wrong.” And that’s a lonely way to live. It just means you’ll be out of that person’s life, and who wants to be cut out of their child’s life? ...|$|E

Me also <b>you</b> <b>loved</b> in a certain fashion and this half love of yours drove me well nigh mad; such as it was, it died when you saw me distraught and celebrating the rites of my forefathers on the teocalli yonder, and you knew me for what I am, a savage. And now the children who linked us together are dead--one by one they died in this way and in that, for the curse which follows my blood descended upon them--and your love for me is dead with them.

If <b>you</b> <b>loved</b> anybody, it seemed rotten to expect them to obey <b>you.</b> If <b>you</b> <b>loved</b> <b>them</b> and they <b>loved</b> <b>you,</b> there couldn't ever be any {{question}} of obeying, because you would both do the things always of your own accord. And if they didn't <b>love</b> <b>you,</b> or <b>you</b> <b>them,</b> then--oh! then it would be simply too disgusting for anything, to go on living with a person <b>you</b> didn't <b>love</b> or who didn't <b>love</b> <b>you.</b> But of course SHE didn't love his tutor.
