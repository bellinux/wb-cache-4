500|$|The song {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} music critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called it [...] "a sleek, spooky collaboration with Kanye West", while Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone said the collaboration [...] "gel perfectly". Ben Kelly of Attitude said, [...] "West’s production makes a real moment" [...] and [...] "Her anti-Vogue rap of suspected Illuminati members {{is probably the}} only time Rihanna and Queen Elizabeth will feature side by side". Gavin Haynes of NME described it as [...] "classy, 'Vogue'-referencing". Randall Roberts of Los Angeles Times called it [...] "one of the record’s highlights," [...] saying, [...] "he raps during [...] and doesn’t sound totally ridiculous". He also said the track balances [...] "club frenzy and revelatory lyricism". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine said, [...] "West gives 'Illuminati' the Yeezus treatment...her rapped verses about the titular secret society are clean and tight enough to make <b>you</b> <b>forget</b> <b>about</b> 'American Life'". Kevin Ritchie of Now called it one of [...] "the most ambitious and interesting lyrically". Lindsay Zoladz of New York Daily News wrote that the song is [...] "just goofy enough to work".|$|E

2500|$|As Ocean Avenues {{popularity}} {{began to}} decrease, Yellowcard {{spent some time}} contributing songs to various other soundtracks.

2500|$|During 1985, Simple Minds were in {{the studio}} with former Tom Petty/Stevie Nicks {{producer}} Jimmy Iovine. In November, Once Upon a Time was released; former Chic singer Robin Clark, who performed call-and-response vocals with Kerr throughout the album (effectively becoming a second lead singer), and was heavily featured in Simple Minds music videos of the time. The record reached No.1 in the UK and No.10 in the US, despite the fact that their major-league breakthrough single [...] "Don't <b>You</b> (<b>Forget</b> <b>About</b> Me)" [...] was not included.|$|E
2500|$|Simple Minds {{returned}} to activity later in 1994. By now {{the band was}} officially a duo of Kerr and Burchill (with the latter taking on keyboards in the studio, as well as guitar). Hiring Keith Forsey (the writer of [...] "Don't <b>You</b> (<b>Forget</b> <b>About</b> Me)") as producer, they began to put together an album which {{returned to}} the uplifting arena rock feel of their Once Upon a Time days. With Gaynor now out of the picture, the remaining instrumentation was covered by session musicians (although Malcolm Foster was included among the bass players used for recording).|$|E
2500|$|In a June 25, 1985 {{review for}} The Village Voice, music critic Robert Christgau gave the album a [...] "D−" [...] {{and said that}} it has [...] "utterly negligible" [...] songs, and he commended Simple Minds for trying to {{distance}} themselves from their song, [...] "Don't <b>You</b> (<b>Forget</b> <b>About</b> Me)," [...] best known for being played during the film's opening and closing credits. In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the soundtrack three out of five stars and wrote that, apart from Simple Minds' [...] "undisputed masterpiece," [...] the album is largely [...] "disposable" [...] and marred by [...] "'80s artifacts" [...] and [...] "forgettable instrumentals".|$|E

2500|$|Despite the band's new-found {{popularity}} in the UK, Europe, Canada and Australia, Simple Minds remained essentially unknown in the US. The band's UK releases on Arista were not picked up by Arista USA who had 'right of first refusal' for their releases. The 1985 film The Breakfast Club broke Simple Minds into the US market, when the band achieved their only No.1 U.S. pop hit in April 1985 with the film's closing track, [...] "Don't <b>You</b> (<b>Forget</b> <b>About</b> Me)". The song was written by Keith Forsey and Steve Schiff; Forsey offered the song to Billy Idol and Bryan Ferry before Simple Minds agreed to record it. The song soon became a chart-topper in many other countries around the world.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{casualty}} was bassist Derek Forbes, who {{was beginning}} to squabble with Kerr. Forbes began failing to turn up for rehearsals, and was dismissed. Forbes remained {{in touch with the}} band (and soon reunited with another former Simple Minds bandmate, drummer Brian McGee, in Propaganda). Forbes was replaced by former Brand X bass player John Giblin (who owned the band's rehearsal space and was a session musician who had worked with Peter Gabriel and Kate Bush). Giblin made his debut with Simple Minds at Live Aid in Philadelphia, where the band performed [...] "Don't <b>You</b> (<b>Forget</b> <b>About</b> Me)", a new track called [...] "Ghost Dancing" [...] and [...] "Promised You a Miracle". Simple Minds were the first band to be approached to play the Philadelphia leg of Live Aid.|$|E
2500|$|The {{value of}} {{extensive}} literary analysis {{has been questioned}} by several prominent artists. Vladimir Nabokov once wrote that good readers do not read books, and particularly those which {{are considered to be}} literary masterpieces, [...] "for the academic purpose of indulging in generalizations". At a 1986 Copenhagen conference of James Joyce scholars, Stephen J. Joyce (the modernist writer's grandson) said, [...] "If my grandfather was here, he would have died laughing ... Dubliners and A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man can be picked up, read, and enjoyed by virtually anybody without scholarly guides, theories, and intricate explanations, as can Ulysses, if <b>you</b> <b>forget</b> <b>about</b> all the hue and cry." [...] He later questioned whether anything has been added to the legacy of Joyce's art by the 261 books of literary criticism stored in the Library of Congress.|$|E

2500|$|On {{a second}} soundtrack for Victorious, Victorious 2.0, {{released}} on June 5, 2012 as an extended play, Grande supplied vocals for {{a cover of}} [...] "Don't <b>You</b> (<b>Forget</b> <b>About</b> Me)". After three seasons, Victorious was not renewed. The finale aired in February 2013. The third and final Victorious soundtrack, , was released on November 6, 2012, featuring Grande duetting with Victoria Justice in the song [...] "L.A. Boyz". A music video of the song followed. In December 2012, Grande collaborated on the single version of [...] "Popular Song", a duet with British singer and songwriter Mika. She also starred as Snow White in a pantomime-style musical theatre production called A Snow White Christmas, together with Charlene Tilton and Neil Patrick Harris at the Pasadena Playhouse.

Estevez could not attend because of other commitments, and Nelson appeared earlier in the show but left before the on-stage reunion, prompting Hall to joke that the two were [...] "in Africa with Dave Chappelle". Yellowcard performed Simple Minds' anthem for the film, [...] "Don't <b>You</b> (<b>Forget</b> <b>About</b> Me)", at the awards. At the 82nd Academy Awards (March 7, 2010), Sheedy, Hall, Ringwald, and Nelson all appeared in a tribute to John Hughes— who had died a few months prior— along with other actors {{who had worked with}} him, including Jon Cryer from Pretty in Pink, Matthew Broderick from Ferris Bueller's Day Off, and Macaulay Culkin from Home Alone.|$|E
