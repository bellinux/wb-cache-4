500|$|Another {{execution}} {{was staged}} as a cruel {{twist on the}} story of Orpheus, who supposedly charmed the plants and flowers with his song after he lost Eurydice. In the version presented at the inaugural games, the tree and animals were charmed just as in the story, except for an [...] "unappreciative" [...] bear which tore the minstrel to pieces. It is likely that the harmless creatures were released first to give the impression of the story proceeding as planned before the bear was released to dispatch the unfortunate criminal forced into the role of Orpheus, whose probable restraint prevented him fleeing. Ironic reinterpretations of the myths may have been popular: in addition to Orpheus' failure to charm the beasts, Martial mentions [...] "Daedalus" [...] being torn apart by another bear, mocking him with the words [...] "how you must wish <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>your</b> feathers now".|$|E

2500|$|The terms inoculation, {{vaccination}} and immunization {{are often}} used synonymously to refer to artificial induction of immunity against various infectious diseases. This is supported by some dictionaries. However, there are some important historical and current differences. In English medicine, inoculation referred only {{to the practice of}} variolation until the very early 1800s. When Edward Jenner introduced smallpox vaccine in 1798, this was initially called cowpox inoculation or vaccine inoculation. Soon, to avoid confusion, smallpox inoculation continued to be referred to as variolation (from variola = smallpox) and cowpox inoculation was referred to as vaccination (from Jenner's use of variolae vaccinae = smallpox of the cow). Then, in 1891 Louis Pasteur proposed that the terms vaccine and vaccination should be extended to include the new protective procedures being developed. Immunization refers to the use of all vaccines but also extends to the use of antitoxin, which contains preformed antibody to e.g. diphtheria or tetanus exotoxins. Inoculation is now more or less synonymous in nontechnical usage with injection etc., and the question e.g. [...] "Have <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>your</b> flu injection/vaccination/inoculation/immunization?" [...] should not cause confusion. The focus is on what is being given and why, not the literal meaning of the technique used.|$|E
2500|$|Before leaving, Kelly {{told the}} group that when Fitzpatrick, the Benalla constable, was shot, he was not within 400 miles of Greta. However, he {{admitted}} to stealing 280 horses from Whitty's station and denied that he had committed any other crime. The horses, he stated, were sold to Baumgarten. Kelly showed the group his revolvers, and pointed out one which he had taken from Constable Lonigan, and further stated that he had shot Lonigan with a worn-out, crooked musket, held together with string and 'could shoot around corners'. He asked those present how they would like detectives pointing revolvers at their mothers and sisters, threatening to shoot them {{if they did not}} say where they were. He blamed such treatment for turning him against the law. He said that he had come only to shoot the two policemen, Devine and Richards, calling them worse than any black trackers, especially Richards, whom he intended to shoot immediately. Tarleton remarked that Kelly should not blame Richards for doing his duty. Kelly then replied, [...] "Suppose <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>your</b> revolver ready when I came in, would you not have shot me ?" [...] Mr Tarleton replied [...] "Yes." [...] "Well", said Kelly, [...] "that's just what I am going to do with Richards—shoot him before he shoots me." [...] The party then interceded for Richards, but Kelly said, [...] "He must die." [...] Before leaving Ned Kelly remarked that he had made a great blunder which would likely lead to their capture.|$|E
