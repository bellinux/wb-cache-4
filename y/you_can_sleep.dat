2500|$|The spot {{advertising}} for the fictional United Trek Federation was {{a spot on}} Darker Projects, premiering on the sixth third-season episode of Star Trek: The Section 31 Files called Invasion, Part III - Warday. In this spot, an announcer says [...] "How many times does this happen to you?", followed by the two geeks downloading a possible new Star Trek episode ( [...] or Section 31) available. Instead, they stumbled upon Doctor Who, and attempts to free the computer unsuccessful as it detonated, marking [...] "another tragic act of computer terrorism {{at the hands of}} the Who World Order." [...] The announcer then asks: [...] "Do you wake up in the middle of the night, wondering today's the day the forces of the Who World Order will come knocking on your door, to drag you off to their Who Relocation Camps?" [...] It is then the United Trek Federation is introduced. What happens next is that a young woman (voiced by Kara Dennison) shouting her Trek DVDs have been stolen by some Dinomonster. This particular agent is being intercepted by the UTF agent who's there for her, and the stolen DVDs are recovered back. It concludes with the line: [...] "With the United Trek Federation, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>sleep</b> easily. Knowing the monsters of the Who World Order have at last met their match.

5000|$|Yet another {{incident}} which put her {{at odds with}} Blanche was when she dated Stan's brother, Ted (McLean Stevenson).

6000|$|... "You {{must learn}} to understand, Wife, that our customs are {{different}} from those of Egypt. There I was happy as a slave and you were held to be beautiful as the Cup of the holy Tanofir, also learned. Here I am wretched as a king and you are held to be ugly, also ignorant as a stranger. Oh! do not answer, I pray you, but learn that all goes well. For the time you are accepted as my wife, subject to the decision of a council of matrons, aged relatives of my family, who will decide when we reach the City of the Grasshopper whether or not you shall be acknowledged as the Queen of the Ethiopians. No, no, I pray you say nothing since I must go away at once, as according to the law of the Ethiopians {{the time has come for}} the Grasshopper to sleep, alone, Karema, as you are not yet acknowledged as my wife. <b>You</b> also <b>can</b> <b>sleep</b> with the lady Tiu and for Shabaka a tent is provided.

6000|$|Before Imogene fell asleep, Mrs. Bowen {{came to her}} in the dark, {{and softly}} closed the door that opened from the girl's room into Effie's.

[...] "I thought you would come to me, Imogene; but as you didn't, I have come to you, for if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> go to <b>sleep</b> with hard {{thoughts}} of me to-night, I can't let you.

If you don't think it is, I will write it over in the morning." ...|$|R

5000|$|Upon release, Wyn Carter of Words {{reviewed}} Timeless Flight and commented: [...] "Timeless Flight is the {{new album}} from the ultra-talented Steve Harley & Cockney Rebel who are definitely on a higher plan that most pop groups in {{that it takes a}} little time to get fully into what they're doing, but it's so rewarding when you finally make it. [...] "Black or White" [...] is included with highlight tracks [...] "Understand" [...] and [...] "Nothing is Sacred"." [...] Angus Mackinnon of Street Life concluded: [...] "Timeless Flight is good music, questionable lyrical support systems. Or rather, if you dig the words the record's a Slumberland smooth double bed affair - and if <b>you</b> don't, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> just <b>sleep</b> on the floor." [...] Another UK music magazine review commented: [...] "This is not as consistently good or disciplined as The Best Years of Our Lives, but then I never expected it to be. Despite all the imperfections, I'll be surprised if Timeless Flight doesn't end up among my favourite five albums of '76." [...] Another review by Jonathan Barnett said: [...] "Timeless Flight is an important work by a critically underrated talent - few people it is, indeed, who are able to write startlingly honest and commercial material." ...|$|R
