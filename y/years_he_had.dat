Crommelin. Listfield moved to Pittsburgh's Tree of Life Congregation in August 2006.|$|E
5|$|A snap {{election}} was called, with Bruce taking {{his case to}} the people that dramatic action on industrial relations was needed. Opposition Leader Scullin forcefully attacked the government, blaming the Prime Minister for an industrial environment that was adversarial and punitive, stressing that Commonwealth arbitration had safeguarded many rights of workers and was completely workable with conciliation and proper consultation. Scullin also criticised the government for the growing debt problem and economic malaise, which for some <b>years</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> predicted would lead to a major economic crisis.|$|E

5|$|Already 40 years old, Bacon {{viewed the}} {{exhibition}} as his last chance and applied {{himself to the}} task with determination. Because he had destroyed all his output {{of the last three}} <b>years,</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> little choice but to present new works. He did not have a grand plan when he agreed to the show, but eventually found themes that interested him in his Head I of the previous year, and executed five progressively stronger variants in the final weeks before the November exhibition, completing the series barely in time for the opening.|$|E
5|$|At 17 {{he became}} the leader of Glebova's claque, {{was working as a}} copyist for lawyers, and going out to a theater, a tavern, or a party every night. He would later draw on his own life at this time for his {{portrayal}} of Protosov in Tolstoy's The Living Corpse. Over the next few <b>years</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> numerous love affairs, and was prevented from a love marriage with one Esther Raizel because his own dubious reputation compounded the taint of his mother's divorce. He survived another pogrom, but his family was financially ruined by the destruction of their possessions and the theft of their money.|$|E
5|$|By 1889 Verdi {{had been}} an opera {{composer}} for more than fifty <b>years.</b> <b>He</b> <b>had</b> written 27 operas, of which only one was a comedy, his second work, Un giorno di regno, staged unsuccessfully in 1840. His fellow composer Rossini commented that he admired Verdi greatly, but thought him incapable of writing a comedy. Verdi disagreed {{and said that he}} longed to write another light-hearted opera, but nobody would give him the chance. He had included moments of comedy even in his tragic operas, for example in Un ballo in maschera and La forza del destino.|$|E

5|$|Childe's next work, The Bronze Age (1930), {{dealt with}} the titular Bronze Age in Europe, and {{displayed}} his increasing acceptance of Marxist theory in understanding how society functioned and changed. He believed that metal was the first indispensable article of commerce, and that metal-smiths were therefore full-time professionals who lived off the social surplus. Within a matter of <b>years</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> followed this up {{with a string of}} further works: The Forest Cultures of Northern Europe: A Study in Evolution and Diffusion (1931) and The Continental Affinities of British Neolithic Pottery (1932).|$|E
5|$|Liubartas (baptized Dymitr) was Gediminas' {{youngest}} son. In {{the early}} 1320s {{he married a}} daughter of Andrew of Galicia and ruled Lutsk in eastern Volhynia. After Andrew's and his brother Lev of Galicia's deaths about 1323, Galicia–Volhynia experienced a power vacuum. Rather than promoting Liubartas and risking a war with Poland, Gediminas married his daughter Eufemija to Boleslaw-Yuri II of Galicia. War with Poland was thereby postponed until 1340. The Galicia–Volhynia Wars were settled after 1370, when Poland received Galicia, while Lithuania retained Volhynia. Liubartas died around 1385, having ruled Volhynia for roughly sixty <b>years.</b> <b>He</b> <b>had</b> three sons.|$|E
5|$|The {{loss of his}} son was a major blow to Tiberius, {{personally}} and politically. Over the <b>years</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> grown increasingly disillusioned with the position of princeps and by sharing the tribunician powers with Drusus in AD 22 had prepared to relent some of his responsibilities in favour of his son. With these hopes now dashed, Tiberius left his administration more than ever {{in the care of}} Sejanus and looked toward the sons of Germanicus (Nero Caesar, Drusus Caesar and Caligula) as possible heirs.|$|E

5|$|According to {{a letter}} written to General Cheatham from Judge Mangum post war, Cleburne's remains were first laid to rest at Rose Hill Cemetery in Columbia, Tennessee. At the urging of Army Chaplain Biship Quintard, Judge Mangum, staff officer to Cleburne and his law partner in Helena, Cleburne's remains were moved to St. John's Episcopal Church near Mount Pleasant, Tennessee, where they {{remained}} for six <b>years.</b> <b>He</b> <b>had</b> first observed St. John's during the Army of Tennessee's march into Tennessee during the campaign {{that led to the}} Battle of Franklin and commented that it was the place he would like to be buried because of its great beauty and resemblance to his Irish homeland. In 1870, he was disinterred and returned to his adopted hometown of Helena, Arkansas, with much fanfare, and buried in the Confederate section of Maple Hill Cemetery, overlooking the Mississippi River.|$|E
5|$|After his {{accidental}} discovery, Reinitzer did {{not pursue}} studying liquid crystals further. The research was continued by Lehmann, who {{realized that he}} had encountered a new phenomenon and {{was in a position to}} investigate it: In his postdoctoral <b>years</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> acquired expertise in crystallography and microscopy. Lehmann started a systematic study, first of cholesteryl benzoate, and then of related compounds which exhibited the double-melting phenomenon. He was able to make observations in polarized light, and his microscope was equipped with a hot stage (sample holder equipped with a heater) enabling high temperature observations. The intermediate cloudy phase clearly sustained flow, but other features, particularly the signature under a microscope, convinced Lehmann that he was dealing with a solid. By the end of August 1889 he had published his results in the Zeitschrift für Physikalische Chemie.|$|E
5|$|Dwindling party {{membership}} created {{many problems}} for Quisling, especially financial ones. For <b>years</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been in financial difficulties and reliant on his inheritance, while {{increasing numbers of}} his paintings {{were found to be}} copies when he tried to sell them. Vidkun and his brother Arne sold one Frans Hals painting for just four thousand dollars, believing it to be a copy and not the fifty-thousand-dollar artwork they had once thought it to be, only to see it reclassified as an original and revalued at a hundred thousand dollars. In the difficult circumstances of the Great Depression, even originals did not raise as much as Quisling had hoped. His disillusionment with Norwegian society was furthered by news of the planned constitutional reform of 1938, which would extend the parliamentary term from three to four years with immediate effect, a move Quisling bitterly opposed.|$|E

5|$|Earlier, Cotillo {{had opposed}} the anti-immigration {{restrictions}} of the Immigration Act of 1924 that significantly limited immigration from Italy. In 1931, Cotillo protested against unnecessary stringent {{requirements of a}} proposed registration law, particularly the requirement of {{the equivalent of a}} public school education and the fingerprinting of applicants. A naturalized citizen had the same rights as native-born and fingerprinting would make the foreign applicant feel like a criminal, Cotillo pointed out. He referred to the findings of the Wickersham Commission that the foreign-born committed considerably less crime than native citizens. He also attacked the revocation of citizenship because of evil doing, while a native born was not affected. At the time, Cotillo claimed to have naturalized some 25,000 immigrants in the eight <b>years</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been on the bench.|$|E
5|$|Evan Lysacek was {{originally}} coached by Candice Brown in Naperville. After that, {{he worked with}} Deborah Stoery in Naperville, Illinois and Addison, Illinois for three years. For the next two <b>years,</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> an arrangement where he would train under both Addison-based Maria Jeżak-Athey and Moscow-based Viktor Kudriavtsev. Kudriavtsev would come to Chicago {{for part of the}} year to coach, and Lysacek spent his summers at Kudriavtsev's summer training camps in Moscow, Russia and Flims, Switzerland. When that arrangement proved untenable, Kudriavtsev recommended Lysacek to Carroll, who agreed to coach Lysacek on the condition that Lysacek would work more with Congemi than with himself, due to Carroll's commitments to Timothy Goebel. Lysacek moved to El Segundo, California to work with Frank Carroll and Ken Congemi in June 2003. Lysacek worked with both Congemi and Carroll through the 2006-2007 season, after which he began working solely with Carroll. He has also trained with ballerina Galina Barinova.|$|E
5|$|In {{his teenage}} <b>years</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> trials for clubs as far apart as the Netherlands, Japan, and England. He was under {{contract}} at Birmingham City, Barnet and Japanese side Machida Zelvia. He joined the Glenn Hoddle Academy in Spain in summer 2009. From {{there he was}} sent out to Worcester City, Jerez Industrial, Doncaster Rovers, and Oxford United to gain first team experience. In June 2011 he signed with Port Vale via Hyde (partners of the Hoddle Academy). He left Port Vale in April 2013 after falling out with the club's management, and signed with Newport County for the 2013–14 season. After over 18 {{months out of the}} game, he signed with Sutton United in February 2016, and was an influential presence in midfield, helping the club to win promotion as champions of National League South {{at the end of the}} 2015–16 season, he left the club in December 2016 and joined Eastleigh for a brief spell four months later.|$|E
