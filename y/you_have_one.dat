They may see more than I can, (especially such as judicious and honest Mr. Fisher, who knoweth both places.) And, therefore, I presume not peremptorily to advise you, but to cast in my thoughts; which, if they seem unsatisfactory to you, reject them.|$|E

[...] Upon his appointment the War Minister, André Maginot, warned him that [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>one</b> unfortunate engagement, I will hide your losses and I will lie against the evidence; but I {{can only do}} that once. [...] If you have a second reverse I will be obliged to tell the truth, and then all those - like me - who wish for the pacification of Morocco will be swept away, like Ferry after Lang Son". [...] Referring to the fall of Prime Minister Jules Ferry after the disastrous retreat from Lang Son in Vietnam in 1885. [...] On 16 March 1932 {{he was promoted to}} grand-officer of the Legion, having also received promotion to général de division (major-general).|$|E
500|$|World Painted Blood {{marked the}} first time that the band wrote {{material}} in the studio rather than entering the studio fully prepared with lyrics. The fact that they were not prepared made guitarist Kerry King skeptical. King related: [...] "I was kind of thinking, 'Man, this could be the first record in a long time that's got a little bit of filler,'" [...] he acknowledges. [...] "But I think every song came out great. I was concerned some would sound similar, and every one is completely different. It's cool how it worked out." [...] The majority of the lyrics and music were written by guitarist Jeff Hanneman. Kerry King stated: [...] "I like when Jeff writes as much as he did for this record. When <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>one</b> guy doing most of the writing you only get one perspective. A lot of Jeff's stuff has a very punky vibe this time; the stuff I write sounds thrashy but with a hint of punk, and when Jeff writes the stuff is more punk with a hint of thrash. It works together well." [...] Unlike 2006's Christ Illusion, the band was [...] "under-ready" [...] with their lyrics and music.|$|E

500|$|Retrospective reviews on Impossible Princess—both from European and Australasian areas—have {{been much}} more positive, with AllMusic's Chris True {{labelling}} it a [...] "pretty damn good record", and openly criticised the critical reception around the album's early release, deeming it a [...] "shame". Nevertheless, he believed that [...] "Unlike Minogue's early work, this album sounds stronger and has a more natural feel. Her songwriting abilities {{have come a long}} way, and Impossible Princess actually flows together as an album." [...] Slant Magazine editor Sal Cinquemani awarded it four stars, and was impressed with the album's [...] "starkly personal and unified cord", saying it [...] "is the work of an artist willing to take risks, not a pop queen concerned with preserving her reign." [...] Cinquemani added it to the staff choices of their Vital Pop: 50 Essential Pop Albums lists. Awarding four stars, Nick Levine from British tabloid Digital Spy commended the mixture of genres and Minogue's input. Although he noticed the material's lack of commercial appeal, he concluded, [...] "Brave, revealing and rarely less than surprising, it's a key piece in the trickier-than-you-think jigsaw puzzle that is Kylie Minogue's recording career." [...] While reviewing her tenth album X (2007), Evan Sawdey from PopMatters commented [...] "For those who still have a copy of her Manic Street Preachers-assisted Impossible Princess, then <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>one</b> of the most crazed, damn-near perfect dance-pop albums ever created." ...|$|E
500|$|Andrew Hampp and Erika Ramirez of Billboard {{magazine}} praised Beyoncé's [...] "sexy" [...] vocals on {{the track}} which they hailed as a [...] "slinky club banger". The Washington Post writer Chris Richards described [...] "Blow" [...] as a [...] "strutting, moaning disco vamp". Sal Cinquemani, writing for Slant Magazine {{described it as a}} [...] "post-disco slink". The Quietus writer Mof Gimmers wrote, [...] "The cocaine soul bears down again, with the excellent 'Blow' which grooves along like Kelis on a Friday night, before gnashing its teeth into the gonzo pop of Cameo or Parliament." [...] The Guardians Michael Cragg described it as a [...] "delicious throwback funk" [...] song. Mikael Wood of Los Angeles Times felt that the [...] "sumptuous" [...] song allowed Beyoncé [...] "to flex her impressive stylistic chops". Spins Anupa Mistry praised the collaboration of Timbaland and Pharrell on the [...] "nimble and funky" [...] track [...] "Blow" [...] as [...] "mighty" [...] and [...] "genius". Similarly, Claire Lobenfeld from Complex who felt that Justin Timberlake and Timbaland [...] "lost their ability to make their distinctive, infectious love-pop" [...] on Timberlake's album The 20/20 Experience, noted that [...] "Blow" [...] proved the opposite: [...] "The two have reinvigorated the overused private-parts-as-candy trope by writing one of Bey's friskiest songs ever. Add some Pharrell production... and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>one</b> of the smoothest pieces of filth of the year." [...] Ryan Dennehy from AbsolutePunk found [...] "trademark" [...] Timbaland production in [...] "Blow" [...] and opined, [...] "Bey wisely co-opts Timbaland himself to deliver a steamy hook that interlocks with her own vocals." [...] Cosmopolitan writer Alex Rees deemed [...] "Blow" [...] an [...] "awesome disco moment".|$|E

2500|$|In August 2010, Schmidt {{clarified}} his company's {{views on}} network neutrality: [...] "I {{want to be}} clear {{what we mean by}} Net neutrality: What we mean is if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>one</b> data type like video, you don't discriminate against one person's video in favor of another.
