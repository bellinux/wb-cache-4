500|$|At the October 30, 2007 {{debate in}} Philadelphia and the November 15 debate in Las Vegas, Biden was noted for some one-liners that drew some {{laughter}} from the audience. First, when speaking about Rudy Giuliani at the Philadelphia debate, Biden stated, [...] "There's only three things he mentions in a sentence: a noun, and a verb and 9/11." [...] At the Las Vegas debate Biden seemed to attack all his opponents when he stated, [...] "I know there's more to say, Campbell. I appreciate <b>you</b> <b>asking</b> <b>me</b> the question and I'm sorry I answered it. I know you're not supposed to answer questions, based on what I've heard." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to {{an article}} from The New York Times, [...] "over the years, Frazier has lost a fortune through a {{combination}} of his own generosity and naïveté, his carousing, and failed business opportunities. The other headliners from his fighting days—Ali, George Foreman, and Larry Holmes—are millionaires." [...] Asked about his situation, Frazier became playfully defensive, but would not reveal his financial status. [...] "Are <b>you</b> <b>asking</b> <b>me</b> how much money I have?" [...] he said. [...] "I got plenty of money. I got a stack of $100 bills rolled up over there {{in the back of the}} room." [...] Frazier blamed himself, partly, for not effectively promoting his own image. [...] In a 2006 HBO documentary on the fight in Manila, Frazier was interviewed living in a one-room apartment on the second floor of his gym.|$|E

2500|$|Later, after Zhong Hui {{secretly}} accused Deng Ai {{of plotting}} a rebellion, Sima Zhao wanted {{to lead his}} forces to station at Chang'an. Shao Ti told Sima Zhao {{that there was no}} need for him to go to Chang'an because Zhong Hui was capable of arresting Deng Ai on his own since he had five to six times more troops than Deng Ai. Sima Zhao replied, [...] "Have you forgotten what you said previously? Why are <b>you</b> <b>asking</b> <b>me</b> not to go (to Chang'an) now? Please keep secret what we spoke about. I treat people with trust and respect. As long as they remain loyal to me, I will not doubt them. Jia Chong recently asked me, 'Are you suspicious of Zhong Hui?' I replied, 'If I send you on a mission today, do you think I doubt you?' He could not respond to my reply. Everything will be settled when I arrive in Chang'an." [...] By the time Sima Zhao reached Chang'an, Zhong Hui had already been killed in the mutiny, just as Sima Zhao foresaw.|$|E
2500|$|The {{historical}} text Han Jin Chunqiu {{mentioned that}} Cao Rui had all along {{been aware of}} his mother's fate, and he was angry and sad about it. After he became emperor, his stepmother Guo Nüwang became the empress dowager. When he asked her about how his mother died, Guo replied, [...] "The Late Emperor {{was the one who}} ordered her death, so why are <b>you</b> <b>asking</b> <b>me?</b> You're your father's son so you can blame your dead father. Are you going to kill your stepmother for your real mother?" [...] Cao Rui turned furious and forced Empress Dowager Guo to commit suicide. He had her buried with the funeral rites befitting that of an empress, but also ordered her dead body to be treated {{in the same manner as}} she did to his mother – hair covering face, mouth stuffed with rice husks. However, the historical text Weilüe stated that after Empress Dowager Guo died of illness in 235, Cao Pi's concubine Lady Li (李夫人) told Cao Rui about the fate of his mother. Cao Rui was deeply grieved and he ordered Guo's dead body to be treated in the same manner as she did to his mother.|$|E

6000|$|... "Affianced," [...] he said, [...] "I knew it. Nay, I {{will say}} no ill of the man; to revile one more {{fortunate}} is poor argument. But {{what is it}} to me if you are affianced? What to me if you were wed? I should seek you all the same, who have no choice. Beneath me? You are as far above me as a star, and it would seem as hard to reach. Seek some other love? I tell you, lady, that I have sought many, for not all are so hard to win, and I hate them every one. You I desire alone, and shall desire till I be dead, aye, and you I will win or die. No, I will not die till you are my own. Have no fear, I will not kill your lover, save perhaps in fair fight; I will not force you to give yourself to me, should I find the chance, but with your own lips I will yet listen to <b>you</b> <b>asking</b> <b>me</b> to be your husband. I swear it by Him Who died for us. I swear that, laying aside all other ends, to that sole purpose I will devote my days. Yes, and should you chance to pass from earth before me, then I will follow you to the very gates of death and clasp you there." ...|$|E
60|$|But I hear <b>you</b> <b>asking</b> <b>me</b> {{in alarm}} whether I have {{actually}} put all this tub thumping into a Don Juan comedy. I have not. I have only made my Don Juan a political pamphleteer, and given you his pamphlet in full {{by way of}} appendix. You will find {{it at the end}} of the book. I am sorry to say that it is a common practice with romancers to announce their hero as a man of extraordinary genius, and to leave his works entirely to the reader's imagination; so that {{at the end of the}} book you whisper to yourself ruefully that but for the author's solemn preliminary assurance you should hardly have given the gentleman credit for ordinary good sense. You cannot accuse me of this pitiable barrenness, this feeble evasion. I not only tell you that my hero wrote a revolutionists' handbook: I give you the handbook at full length for your edification if you care to read it. And in that handbook you will find the politics of the sex question as I conceive Don Juan's descendant to understand them. Not that I disclaim the fullest responsibility for his opinions and for those of all my characters, pleasant and unpleasant. They are all right from their several points of view; and their points of view are, for the dramatic moment, mine also. This may puzzle the people who believe that there is such a thing as an absolutely right point of view, usually their own. It may seem to them that nobody who doubts this can be in a state of grace. However that may be, it is certainly true that nobody who agrees with them can possibly be a dramatist, or indeed anything else that turns upon a knowledge of mankind. Hence it has been pointed out that Shakespear had no conscience. Neither have I, in that sense.|$|E
