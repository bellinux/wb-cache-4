500|$|As Roosevelt {{became more}} active as first lady, however, she had {{less time for}} Hickok. Hickok grew angry and jealous at {{perceived}} slights, and demanded more time alone, which Roosevelt was unable to give; at other times, she attempted unsuccessfully to separate herself from Roosevelt. Though the pair remained friends throughout their lives, they continued to grow apart {{in the years that}} followed. In 1937, Roosevelt wrote to Hickok that [...] "I never meant to hurt <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>way,</b> but that is no excuse having done it [...] [...] [...] I am pulling back from all my contacts now [...] [...] [...] Such cruelty & stupidity is unpardonable when you reach my age." ...|$|E
500|$|Lester {{was offered}} {{producing}} credit but refused, going uncredited for his work. Salkind felt that bringing a second director onto the set meant {{there would be}} someone ready {{in the event that}} Donner could not fulfill his directing duties. [...] "Being there all the time meant he [...] could take over," [...] Salkind admitted. [...] " [...] couldn't make up his mind on stuff." [...] On Lester, Donner reflected, [...] "He'd been suing the Salkinds for his money on Three and Four Musketeers, which he'd never gotten. He won a lot of his lawsuits, but each time he sued the Salkinds in one country, they'd move to another, from Costa Rica to Panama to Switzerland. When I was hired, Lester told me, 'Don't do it. Don't work for them. I was told not to, but I did it. Now I'm telling you not to, but you'll probably do it and end up telling the next guy.' Lester came in as a 'go-between'. I didn't trust Lester, and I told him. He said, 'Believe me, I'm only doing it because they're paying me the money that they owe me from the lawsuit. I'll never come onto your set unless you ask me; I'll never go to your dailies. If I can help <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>way,</b> call me." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Of course I {{would not}} wish to {{interfere}} with <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> underhand <b>way,</b> Frank; but I {{will tell you what}} has occurred to me. You have heard, probably, of Miss Dunstable?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} that I have no {{information}} to give you," [...] he said. [...] "On the other hand, if I can help <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> other <b>way</b> I shall be very glad." ...|$|R
60|$|LADY. If he attacks you, or resists <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>way,</b> I release {{you from}} your promise.|$|E

6000|$|... "Avoid me, hereafter. Keep {{out of my}} path. The least {{interference}} from <b>you,</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>way,</b> will oblige me to turn you over to the police." ...|$|E
60|$|If <b>you</b> can, <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>way,</b> make it convenient, {{come over}} with Jupiter. Do come. I {{wish to see}} you to-night, upon {{business}} of importance. I assure {{you that it is}} of the highest importance.|$|R
60|$|I should {{nevertheless}} receive {{with great}} pleasure the exact information you now have, and also such other as <b>you</b> may <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>way</b> obtain. Such information {{might be more}} valuable before the 1st of January than afterwards.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's all right, dear boy!" [...] said Provis coming forward, {{with his}} little clasped black book, and then {{addressing}} himself to Herbert. [...] "Take it in your right hand. Lord strike you dead on the spot, if ever <b>you</b> split <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>way</b> sumever! Kiss it!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{sorry to}} appear indiscreet," [...] our young man returned; [...] "I'm {{sorry to have}} upset <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>way.</b> But I can't {{overcome}} my anxiety--" ...|$|E
6000|$|PETKOFF (looking up {{from his}} paper to watch how they are getting on at the table). Are you sure I can't help <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>way,</b> Bluntschli? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'NOW, Mr Fledgeby,' said Lammle, as before; 'am I to {{understand}} that <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>way</b> reflect upon me, or hint dissatisfaction with me, in this affair?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{can easily}} believe it. You thought me then devoid of every proper feeling, I {{am sure you}} did. The turn of your countenance I shall never forget, as you said that I could not have {{addressed}} <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> possible <b>way</b> that would induce you to accept me." ...|$|R
6000|$|God knows I don't want {{to thwart}} <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> {{reasonable}} <b>way.</b> [...] My whole thought {{is to make}} you comfortable and happy. But [...] I cannot agree to such a preposterous notion as your going [...] to live with your lover. You would lose everybody's respect [...] and regard; and so should I! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{must not}} think," [...] she said quietly, for she {{detected}} a little bitterness in his tone, [...] "that <b>you</b> are <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>way</b> repulsive {{to those who}} know you well. We all admire you as a man and are grieved at the misfortunes that marred your features. After all, Doctor, people of intelligence seldom judge one by appearances." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Have I {{always been}} kind to you, and {{considerate}} of your rights and your freedom? Have I ever interfered with <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>way</b> that you think I oughtn't?" ...|$|E
60|$|My darling, {{you know}} I hate to thwart <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>way,</b> but I've quite {{made up my}} mind that my son shall go to Dublin as I did.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's right," [...] exclaimed Mark, heartily, [...] "I'm glad {{if there}} is the {{smallest}} chance of our serving <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>way.</b> In what way can we do so?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{shall be}} glad to give <b>you</b> aid <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>way,</b> Mrs. Conway, if you will point out to me the {{direction}} in which my assistance can be of use.

60|$|Don't mind us--out our way; {{we possess}} but one vote apiece, and no rights which <b>you</b> are <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>way</b> bound to respect.

6000|$|... "The 'all {{sorts of}} things' did not amount to much, Miss Regan. I made myself as useful as I could, {{and picked up}} French; and at last when the {{privateer}} sailed away I {{walked down to the}} shore and met our sailors when they landed. There was, I can assure <b>you,</b> nothing <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>way</b> heroic about the part I had to play." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I did {{not think}} that you were wretched," [...] he replied with some sadness, [...] "and neither in my eyes, nor in my mother's, are <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>way</b> deformed." ...|$|E

6000|$|THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. When you {{say that}} you weed them out, you send a cold shiver down my spine. I hope you don't mean that you--that you--that <b>you</b> assist Nature <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>way?</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the festival, the Sravakas request each other for forgiveness for all offenses committed during the last year. This occurs on the Paryusha day for the Śvētāmbara and on Pratipada (first) of Ashwin Krashna for the Digambara. Forgiveness is asked by saying Micchami Dukkadam or Uttam Kshama to each other. It means [...] "If I have caused <b>you</b> offence <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>way,</b> knowingly or unknowingly, in thought word or deed, then I seek your forgiveness".|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{system must}} be an admirable one indeed," [...] the doctor said. [...] "I have, of course, heard of it, but could not have {{believed}} that the results were so excellent. It never entered my mind {{for a moment that}} <b>you</b> were <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>way</b> deficient <b>in</b> hearing, still less that you were perfectly deaf. I have noticed that, more than is common, you always kept your eyes fixed on my face when I was speaking to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Andres de Fonseca {{was buried}} to-day,' I answered. 'I was his {{assistant}} {{in his business}} and am his heir. If I can serve <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>way</b> I am at your disposal.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But don't {{let us be}} any {{hindrance}} to you, O'Connor. If you are {{disposed to}} try, by all means do so and, if we can help <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>way,</b> we will." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Take me with you," [...] {{said the}} Echo-dwarf. [...] "You can easily carry me on your strong shoulders; and I shall {{be glad to}} help <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>way</b> that I can." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] she said. She stood apart, conning him steadily. [...] "Yet I {{would not}} have it {{supposed}} that <b>you</b> were <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>way</b> coerced to this." [...] They were odd words; but he heeded not their oddness. He was hardly master of the wits which in themselves were never of the brightest. [...] "I require you to declare that it is your own desire that our marriage should be solemnized {{in accordance with the}} Jewish rites and the law of Moses." ...|$|R
50|$|Sa'īd: O Hajjāj, if you {{gathered}} {{it to be}} {{seen and}} heard in showing off, and to use it to avert others from the way of Allah, then by Allah, it will not avail <b>you</b> against Him <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>way.</b> Saying this, he aligned himself towards Qiblah.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes.' She added hurriedly, as if {{to change}} the subject, 'I have told nobody that we are sisters, or that <b>you</b> are known <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>way</b> to me or to mother or to any of us. I {{thought that would be}} best, from what you said.' ...|$|R
