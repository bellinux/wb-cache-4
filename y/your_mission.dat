The letter stated, [...] "Our organizations deplore {{the use of}} chlorine in this manner.

Chris Carter said [...] "I had to speak with Bill several times; I spent hours with him on the telephone talking about the character, because the actor felt that the episode really made the character something that it wasn't. I tried to explain to him, as I think Jim and Glen were trying to express, that even if <b>your</b> <b>mission</b> in life is a destroyer, that you still have some hope {{in the back of your}} mind that you can be a creator— and that this all of a sudden, this vanity, is his vanity.

500|$|Peale {{departed}} from New York for Le Havre on May 8, 1833, arriving in Paris {{late in the}} month. [...] At this time, it was only certain that Peale would visit Paris—a visit to England, with instruction at local mints and refineries, was still under discussion. Peale had been instructed to learn [...] "parting," [...] a newly developed method for separating gold and silver. This process, also dubbed refining, is necessary because nuggets that contain gold also contain some silver, and the latter metal must be removed before the gold can be alloyed with copper for coining. [...] The older method of removing silver involved the use of nitric and sulphuric acids, and was dangerous and expensive. Director Moore also instructed Peale to gain the method of assaying silver by the [...] "humid process" [...] (titration), and to learn everything he could of coining technology {{and how it was}} powered by steam. Moore warned, [...] "a very material object of <b>your</b> <b>mission</b> is to be regarded as unaccomplished, until you have become familiar with everything requisite for directing the formation of an establishment de novo ... and until you shall have acquired a good share of adroitness in the actual manipulations... Whatever can be added to our information in regard to the treatment of the precious metals, and Mint processes and machinery is within the scope of your inquiries." [...] Moore asked that, if Peale had any time remaining, to look into other technologies that might be useful to the United States, such as the gas illumination of cities.|$|E
500|$|Warnings in {{the media}} led to street protests and demonstrations. Orthodox Jews marched on City Hall and to the {{construction}} site in 1986. Some even gathered at the Western Wall in a public prayer of mourning because of the center. They also gathered at the hotel at which the BYU President was staying at one point, carrying signs saying: [...] "Conversion is Murder!" [...] and [...] "Mormons, stop <b>your</b> <b>mission</b> now". Despite {{the intensity of the}} Haredi opposition, at no point did the protests become physically violent. In late 1985, the Haredim motioned for a no-confidence vote against the leading Labor Party. Prime Minister Shimon Peres organized a committee of eight, four for the center and four against, to debate the issue {{and come up with a}} solution either for or against the center's presence. Another committee was formed to look into the allegation that the money the church had put into Jerusalem was a bribe to gain Mayor Kolleck's support for the center (the committee found the church [...] "Not Guilty"). A subcommittee of the Knesset requested that the LDS Church issue a formal promise not to proselytize Jews. Some Israelis considered this discriminatory, as no other Christian church had been asked to do this in Jerusalem. Church leaders, however, agreed to comply and sent a formally signed statement soon after. Some Jews in the area were still uneasy and doubted the church's intent, [...] believing that religious belief among Mormons would supersede adherence to the law. One protestor stated that [...] "converting the sons of Judah, us, is a basic article of their faith[...] [...] [...] They regard themselves as sons of Joseph and believe there will be no Second Coming for as long as we and they do not fuse." ...|$|E

[...] Taishi Ci pulled him into the carriage and said, [...] "If you didn't show me the document, I wouldn't have been able to destroy it. Regardless of the consequences, neither of us can say he is not responsible for what happened. I suggest we remain silent and escape. By doing this, we can avoid punishment and keep our heads. Otherwise, both of us will be executed." [...] The courier asked, [...] "Your master sent you to destroy this document. Now that you have accomplished <b>your</b> <b>mission,</b> why do you still need to go on the run?" [...] Taishi Ci replied, [...] "He ordered me to only check whether the document has been delivered. However, I went too far and ended up destroying the document. If I go back, I am afraid that my master will blame me, so I suggest we escape together." [...] The courier was persuaded by Taishi Ci so they fled from Luoyang together.|$|E
