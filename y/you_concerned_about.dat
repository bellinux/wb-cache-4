There were several {{items in the}} PROM that were confusing to {{all or most of}} the interviewed patients, or that they understood {{in a way that was}} not intended, which were subsequently adjusted or removed. One example of a misunderstood item was “Were <b>you</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> your safety or that of others in traffic or while operating machinery?”. Several patients indicated concern about their safety in traffic because they thought other people were often bad drivers. We adjusted this question to include “due to your sleepiness”, to shift the focus of this item to the patient’s own potential problems due to OSA. During the second phase of the cognitive interviews, the meaning of the newly adjusted items as well as the other items in the current item selection was clear to the patients.|$|E

40|$|Aim: Dental {{treatment}} {{is necessary in}} oncology patients since pre-existing oro-dental disease may influence cancer treatment and prognosis. This study investigated the applicability of two indices in reflecting the actual oral health status of 100 non-cancer patients who were admitted for dental complaints/routine controls. Methods: The radiographic examination results and the decayed, missed, filled teeth score represented the ‘actual oro-dental status’. The simplified oral hygiene index was utilised for oral hygiene determination, and general oral health assessment index was used to establish the self-perceived oral health. Results: No correlation was observed between actual oro-dental status and the simplified oral hygiene index (p = 0. 27), but the relationship between oro-dental status and general oral health assessment index was significant (p = 0. 026). Items 9, 5 and 1 (How often were <b>you</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> problems with your teeth, gums or dentures? How often {{were you able to}} eat anything without feeling discomfort? How often did you limit the kinds or amounts of food you eat because of problems with your teeth or dentures?) presented correlation (r = − 0. 285, r = 0. 268, and r = − 0. 248).

40|$|Background: Baby boom women (people {{born from}} 1946 to 1964) are {{reaching}} retirement age; however, they {{have experienced a}} very different life course than previous generations. Social and economic changes for baby boom women (e. g., the enormous growth {{of women in the}} workforce, single-parent families) reflect their multiple roles and identities. Baby boomers are also living longer than previous generations, which has resulted in baby boom women having more active, multi-generational caregiving roles (e. g., caring for spouse, parents, grandparents, grandchildren) (Blieszer, 2009). In order to ensure that baby boom career women have optimal work and retirement trajectories or transitions in later life, it is crucial to examine factors that contribute towards their view of retirement. Aim: The aim of this research was to investigate Australian baby boom career women's attitude towards retirement, the differential effect of unknown caregiving roles, and marital status. Method: This paper reports findings from 1, 051 women who participated in the Australia Baby Boom Career Women national survey. Previous research has found cohort differences between early baby boomers (EBBs) (born from 1946 to 1955) and late baby boomers (LBBs) (born from 1955 to 1964); therefore, this paper includes EBB/LBB comparisons. Attitude towards retirement was determined by a forced-response question (positive, negative, undecided); marital status was derived from demographics. A forced-response survey question, "Are <b>you</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> unknown caregiving roles in your retirement years?" was rated on an 11 -point scale (strongly disagree to strongly agree). Findings and Conclusion: Results revealed that EBBs were significantly more concerned about unknown caregiving roles than LBBs and EBBs who reported a positive or undecided attitude towards retirement were the respondents who were significantly more concerned about unknown caregiving roles. Additionally, married/de facto EBBs were significantly more concerned about unknown caregiving roles than single women. Explanations for these findings will be discussed along with implications and recommendations...|$|E
