5000|$|Shaffer {{has also}} {{told the story}} of Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) {{opposition}} to Able Danger, prior to 9/11, based on the view that Able Danger was encroaching on CIA turf. According to Shaffer, the CIA representative said, [...] "I clearly understand. We're going after the leadership. <b>You</b> <b>guys</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> after the body. But, it doesn't matter. The bottom line is, CIA will never give you the best information from [...] "Alex Base" [...] or anywhere else. CIA will never provide that to you because if you were successful in your effort to target Al Qaeda, you will steal our thunder. Therefore, we will not support this." ...|$|E
5000|$|Mark McGarry, an {{attorney}} with the Florida Office of the State Attorney, characterized McPherson's stay at the FSO as an [...] "isolation watch": My understanding now is, from talking to many, many witnesses, the purpose of her being there in the Church, correct me if I'm wrong, she was experiencing some mental problems, and <b>you</b> <b>guys</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to stabilize her through an isolation watch. And after that watch occurred, there <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> a procedure run on her, and the procedure was an introspection rundown.|$|R

2500|$|Her {{following}} effort, Klondike Annie (1936) dealt, as best {{it could}} given the heavy censorship, with religion and hypocrisy. Some critics called the film her screen masterpiece, {{but not everyone}} felt the same way. Press baron and would-be film mogul William Randolph Hearst, ostensibly offended by an offhanded remark West made about his mistress, Marion Davies, sent a private memo to all his editors stating, [...] "That Mae West picture 'Klondike Annie' is a filthy picture...We should have editorials roasting that picture, Mae West, and Paramount...DO NOT ACCEPT ANY ADVERTISING OF THIS PICTURE." [...] At one point, Hearst asked aloud, [...] "Isn't it time Congress did something about the Mae West menace?" [...] Paramount executives felt they had to tone down the West characterization, or face further recrimination. This may be surprising by today's standards, as West's films contained no nudity, no profanity, and very little violence. Though raised {{in an era when}} women held second-place roles in society, West portrayed confident women who were not afraid to use their sexual wiles to get what they wanted. [...] "I was the first liberated woman, <b>you</b> know. No <b>guy</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to get the best of me. That's what I wrote all my scripts about." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{video was}} {{directed}} by Thomas Kloss. In MTV News, Scherzinger talked about the music video: [...] "It's gonna be so much fun. It's gonna be a dance video. Obviously, {{you can tell by}} our wardrobe, it's going to be very colorful and fun ... freaky fun! <b>You</b> <b>guys</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to be wanting to pop some bottles after this one."

5000|$|The hoax {{began with}} four Denver {{newspaper}} reporters, Al Stevens, Jack Tournay, John Lewis and Hal Wilshire, {{who represented the}} four Denver newspapers—the Post, the Republican, the Times and the Rocky Mountain News. The four met by chance at Denver Union Station where each were waiting in hopes of spotting someone of prominence who could become a subject for a news story. Seeing no celebrities and frustrated with no story in sight and deadlines due, Stevens remarked, [...] "I don't know what <b>you</b> <b>guys</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to do, but I'm going to fake it. It won't hurt anybody, so what the Devil." [...] The other three men agreed to concoct a story and walked on 17th Street toward the Oxford Hotel to discuss possible ideas.|$|E
5000|$|In January 2015, Wale {{spoke about}} how it is his most {{personal}} album, saying: [...] "It's super personal. It's like a journal that my whole lifestyle is based around. Before, with my music, I was like the point guard with all the handles. Now I'm just taking it straight to the cup. I'm not moon walking to get from point A to point B. I'm running from point A and through point B. <b>You</b> <b>guys</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to hear what I'm saying. I'm {{going to be as}} transparent as I can be." [...] He also spoke about Jerry Seinfeld's role on the album, saying: [...] "He's the narrator. He's essentially like my conscience. You can look at him as kind of explaining what's happening if you get lost during the story. He'll come in and give you an update." ...|$|E
5000|$|By 1933, West {{was one of}} {{the largest}} box office draws in the United States and, by 1935, West was also the highest paid woman and the second-highest paid person in the United States (after William Randolph Hearst). Hearst invited West to San Simeon, California. [...] "I could'a married him," [...] West explained, [...] "but I got no time for parties. I don't like those big crowds." [...] On July 1, 1934, the {{censorship}} of the Production Code began to be seriously and meticulously enforced, and her screenplays were heavily edited. West would purposely place over-the-top lines in her scripts, knowing the censors would cut them out. She hoped they would then not object as much to her other lines. Her next film was Belle of the Nineties (1934). The original titled, It Ain't No Sin, was changed due to the censors' objections. Despite Paramount's early objections regarding costs, she insisted the studio hire Duke Ellington and his orchestra to accompany her in the film's musical numbers. Their collaboration was a success; the classic [...] "My Old Flame" [...] (recorded by Duke Ellington) was introduced in this picture. Her next film, Goin' to Town (1935), received mixed reviews, as censorship continued to take its toll in eroding West's best lines.Her following effort, Klondike Annie (1936) dealt, as best it could given the heavy censorship, with religion and hypocrisy.

Johnson compared working with Beyer on the comic to {{his work on the}} Star Trek: Countdown comic, a tie-in to the 2009 Star Trek film that he wrote with Kurtzman and Roberto Orci, saying that her position as a staff writer on the Discovery show [...] "means we have all the inside access that we need.

In an e-mail, one staffer called McNair [...] "a lying morally bankrupt criminal, in my view, and a hypocrite of the highest order." [...] Judge Shaller said he would unseal the entire inquiry into McNair in December. [...] "I understand why the NCAA wants to keep this quiet," [...] the Judge said. [...] "But I'm not going to seal the record... I know <b>you</b> <b>guys</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to appeal it but from my part.. There's no reason to seal it.

That's probably {{one of the hardest things}} a young man and young woman can go through in their relationship. And, so that's what I'm saying in that line.
