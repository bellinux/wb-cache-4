The Second Edition features a wealth of additional material including new chapters on time delay estimation, direction finding techniques, and the MUSIC algorithm.

You gain an in-depth understanding of key target location methods that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> effectively <b>apply</b> to your work in the field.
