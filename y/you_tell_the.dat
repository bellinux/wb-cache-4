500|$|Bush {{continued}} {{to serve on}} the NACA through 1948 and expressed annoyance with aircraft companies for delaying development of a turbojet engine because of the huge expense of research and development as well as retooling from older piston engines. He was similarly disappointed with the automobile industry, which showed no interest in his proposals for more fuel-efficient engines. General Motors told him that [...] "even if it were a better engine, [...] would not be interested in it." [...] Bush likewise deplored trends in advertising. [...] "Madison Avenue believes," [...] he said, [...] "that if <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> public something absurd, but do it enough times, the public will ultimately register it in its stock of accepted verities." ...|$|E
500|$|Against the Washington Senators on August 12, 1896, Lajoie {{made his}} major league debut. He played first base and {{recorded}} a single. Ed Delahanty was being considered {{to play the}} first base position after Dan Brouthers retired. Delahanty, however, wanted Lajoie to play first so he could return to his natural position of left field. Delahanty said to Lajoie, [...] "Look, sonny, <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> boss you’re a first baseman and you and me are gonna get along." [...] Lajoie became the team's first baseman {{and by the end}} of the season, he and Delahanty were roommates. Later in 1898, new manager George Stallings moved Lajoie to second base, commenting that [...] " [...] have made good no matter where I positioned him." ...|$|E

500|$|Originally, Che was {{intended}} to be a much more traditional film based on Jon Lee Anderson's 1997 biography Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life. Actor Benicio del Toro and producer Laura Bickford optioned the film rights to Anderson's book. However, after two years they had not found a suitable writer and the rights expired. During this time, Del Toro and Bickford researched the events depicted in Guerrilla with the idea of exploring Guevara's attempts to start a revolution in Bolivia. Del Toro has said that he previously only thought of Guevara as a [...] "bad guy". For his role, Del Toro spent seven years [...] "obsessively researching" [...] Guevara's life, which made him feel like he [...] "earned his stripes" [...] to interpret the character. Preparation included looking at Guevara's photographs and reading his personal writings. Del Toro read Don Quixote, one of Guevara's favorites, and the first book published and given out free after the Cuban Revolution. Del Toro then personally met with people from different stages of Guevara's life, including Guevara's younger brother and childhood friends, traveling to Cuba where Del Toro met Guevara's widow, family, and [...] "tons of people that loved this man". The visit included a five-minute encounter at a book fair with Fidel Castro, who expressed that he was happy for the [...] "serious" [...] research being undertaken. Such research included collaborating with the three surviving guerrillas from Guevara's ill-fated Bolivian campaign, and with several guerrillas who fought alongside him in Cuba. While researching for both films, Soderbergh made a documentary of his interviews with {{many of the people who}} had fought alongside Guevara. In his encounters with people ranging from fellow guerrillas to Guevara's driver, Del Toro described the reaction as [...] "always the same", stating that he was [...] "blown away" [...] by the [...] "bucketful of love" [...] they still harbored for Guevara. In an interview, Del Toro described Guevara as [...] "a weird combination of an intellectual and an action figure, Gregory Peck and Steve McQueen, wrapped in one". After the film's production concluded, Del Toro professed that [...] "when <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> story of Che, you're telling a story of the history of a country, so you have to be very careful".|$|E

2500|$|The VHS, and {{subsequent}} DVD release (which is verbatim the VHS release) lasts 40 minutes. However, the live telecast, {{and subsequent}} LP release were longer. The CD release is {{faithful to the}} LP release, with a total running time of about 52 minutes. In editing the VHS release down to 40 minutes, the lead-up to a delayed punch-line is lost. The punch line comprises Bluebottle asking Moriarty: [...] "...what is that lump on your nut?", to which Moriarty replies: [...] "That {{is the difference between}} margarine". The primer for this punch-line was edited out between announcer Andrew Timothy's follow-on at the end of Ray Ellington's song, and the part where Neddy drives up on an unlicensed Goon Show. Amongst the banter, Grytpype-Thynne tells Moriarty to place his head on an anvil, followed by a clang, and screams of pain from Moriarty. Grytpype then says: [...] "now, taste this margarine". Moriarty complies. Grytpype says: [...] "There. Can <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> difference?". Moriarty: [...] "No". Grytpype (triumphantly): [...] "You see!
