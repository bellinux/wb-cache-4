By the time ain't appeared, an't was already being used for am not, are not, and is not. An't and ain't coexisted as written forms well into the nineteenth century—Charles Dickens used the terms interchangeably, as in Chapter 13, Book the Second of Little Dorrit (1857): [...] "'I guessed it was you, Mr Pancks," [...] said she, 'for it's quite <b>your</b> <b>regular</b> night; ain't it? ... An't it gratifying, Mr Pancks, though; really?'". In the English lawyer William Hickey's memoirs (1808–1810), ain't appears as a {{contraction}} of aren't; [...] "thank God we're all alive, ain't we..." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite Anthony Field's {{expressed}} {{dislike of}} the term, preferring {{to refer to}} it as [...] "preserving the good name of The Wiggles", the group has stressed the importance of their brand and were protective of it. [...] They remained as independent as possible, and retained full creative control and ownership of every aspect of their business. [...] As Field stated, The Wiggles Pty Ltd was [...] "not <b>your</b> <b>regular</b> 'corporate culture'. [...] They made decisions by consensus and made business decisions based upon their experience as performers and their knowledge of early childhood education. [...] They made careful decisions regarding their endorsements of toys and other products, and avoided over-extending their brand by only licensing products that correlated with their image. [...] They had high expectations regarding the behaviour and attitude of everyone associated with the group.|$|E
500|$|As Field reported, The Wiggles Pty Ltd was [...] "not <b>your</b> <b>regular</b> 'corporate culture'." [...] The four {{original}} members {{made decisions}} by consensus and would {{spend more time}} on creative decisions than on business ones. [...] Field reported that many of their key products were launched [...] "during a brief pause in an Xbox game on our tour bus". They answered to no one but themselves, with no executive board or shareholders. [...] As Field stated, they made business decisions based upon their experience as performers and their knowledge of early childhood education, [...] "rather than elaborate, long-term business and strategic plans". [...] When they ventured into international markets, first to the U.S. and the UK in 1998, they chose to follow the same practices that were successful in Australia by keeping their stage show simple: inexpensive props and effects, and the four original members, along with their characters, singing and dancing for their audiences. [...] Financing every business venture themselves, they had to bear the consequences when their ventures did not succeed.|$|E

500|$|Joginder Tuteja of Bollywood Hungama {{praised the}} variety of genres present in the soundtrack {{and the lack of}} remixes. He gave it an overall rating of 3.5 out of 5 stars, calling it a [...] "zero {{compromise}} album" [...] that [...] "stays true to the film's spirit". Planet Bollywood's Atta Khan rated it 9 out of 10, noting that the soundtrack [...] "unquestionably lives up to all expectations". He felt that it maintained an [...] "all round polished nature" [...] and [...] "is destined to become a classic". Although he, too, enjoyed the musical variety, he believed the composers overused the guitar and synthesizers. Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com gave the soundtrack a score of 3 out of 5, commenting, [...] "Taare Zameen Par isn't <b>your</b> <b>regular</b> soundtrack about fluttering hearts and sleepless nights. What makes these delicate and whimsical creations special is their underlying innocence." [...] According to the Indian trade website Box Office India, with around 11,00,000 units sold, this film's soundtrack album was the year's thirteenth highest-selling.|$|E
500|$|The Wiggles Pty Ltd is the {{business}} created by {{the founders of the}} Australian children's music group The Wiggles.

[...] They remained as independent as possible, and retained full creative control and ownership of every aspect of their business. [...] As Field stated, The Wiggles Pty Ltd was [...] "not <b>your</b> <b>regular</b> 'corporate culture'." [...] The group made decisions by consensus and made business decisions based upon their experience as performers and their knowledge of early childhood education.
