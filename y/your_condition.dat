500|$|Baltimore {{solicited}} a new charter {{from the}} king. To found an alternative colony {{in a less}} hostile climate further south, he requested [...] "a precinct" [...] in Virginia, where he could grow tobacco. He wrote to his friends Francis Cottington and Thomas Wentworth enlisting their support for this new proposal, admitting the impression his abandonment of Avalon might make in England: [...] "I shall rayse {{a great deal of}} talke and discourse and be censured by most men of giddiness and levity [...] ". The king, perhaps guided by Baltimore's friends at court, replied expressing concern for Baltimore's health and gently advising him to forget colonial schemes and return to England, where he would be treated with every respect: [...] "Men of <b>your</b> <b>condition</b> and breeding are fitter for other imployments than the framing of new plantations, which commonly have rugged & laborious beginnings, and require much greater meanes, in managing them, than usually the power of one private subject can reach unto".|$|E
2500|$|After the Revolutionary War {{began in}} 1775, {{he joined a}} Connecticut militia and was elected first {{lieutenant}} within five months. His militia unit participated in the Siege of Boston, but Hale remained behind. It {{has been suggested that}} he was unsure as to whether he wanted to fight, or whether he was hindered because his teaching contract in New London did not expire until several months later, in July 1775. On July 4, 1775, Hale received a letter from his classmate and friend Benjamin Tallmadge, who had gone to Boston to see the siege for himself. He wrote to Hale, [...] "Was I in <b>your</b> <b>condition,</b> I think the more extensive service would be my choice. Our holy Religion, the honor of our God, a glorious country, & a happy constitution is what we have to defend." [...] Tallmadge's letter was so inspiring that, several days later, Hale accepted a commission as first lieutenant in the 7th Connecticut Regiment under Colonel Charles Webb of Stamford.|$|E

6000|$|... "There is {{no change}} in <b>your</b> <b>condition,</b> Mr. Fentolin," [...] he announced. [...] "The {{palpitation}} you spoke of is a mistake. You are in perfect health." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{you are so}} in a very {{particular}} way. I {{do not wish to}} remind you what might be <b>your</b> <b>condition</b> now, but for the interposition of private friends." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] she said; [...] "a {{young lady}} comes every evening about six {{and leaves the}} flowers. She always asks about <b>your</b> <b>condition</b> and when she may see you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your pardon, Se√±or Colon," [...] he {{immediately}} and more courteously added; [...] "but <b>your</b> <b>conditions</b> sounded so lofty {{that they have}} quite taken me by surprise. You cannot seriously mean to maintain them?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I must {{do without}} your help then! <b>Your</b> <b>conditions</b> are impossible. I will leave Rome {{at the time}} I have always intended--at the end of June. My rooms and my mother's are taken till then; all my {{arrangements}} are made accordingly. Then, I will depart; not before." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh no, my dear lady," [...] I put in. [...] "I don't {{think that}} {{of you as}} you are. None of you could see more plainly than I do that in <b>your</b> <b>conditions</b> you must have servants, and that you cannot {{possibly}} work unless poverty obliges you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then imagine <b>your</b> <b>condition</b> {{were you}} able fully to control this great element," [...] replied the other, gravely. [...] "The {{weaknesses}} and privations of mankind would be converted into power and luxury." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Fanny! my poor Fanny!" [...] said Kilcullen; [...] "if {{such is the}} case, you {{are really}} to be pitied. If this be true, <b>your</b> <b>condition</b> is nearly as unhappy as my own." ...|$|E

5000|$|He {{declined}} {{all attempts}} made to induce him {{to conform to}} Anglicanism by the offer of his life. He was executed with Edward Bamber and John Woodcock, saying to the sheriff: [...] "Use your pleasure with me, a reprieve or even a pardon upon <b>your</b> <b>conditions</b> I utterly refuse".|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{the other}} assented. [...] "I knew {{something}} of your literature {{as well as}} <b>your</b> <b>conditions</b> before I left home, and I perceived that by some anomaly the one was not tainted by the other. It is a miraculous proof of the divine mission of the poet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are {{an honest}} woman, and I am a thief," [...] Madame Fontaine answered, {{with the same}} ominous composure. [...] "How can {{explanations}} pass between you and me? Have I not spoken plainly enough already? In my position, I say again, <b>your</b> <b>conditions</b> are impossibilities--especially the first of them." ...|$|R
60|$|Mask. Pray {{consider}} <b>your</b> <b>condition</b> a little; {{a younger}} brother, {{in a foreign}} country, living at a high rate, your money lost, and without hope of a supply. Now curse, if you think good.|$|E
6000|$|... "Shut up, you damned sea-lawyer, you," [...] he snarled. [...] "Haven't {{you played}} a dirty trick enough comin' on board this ship in <b>your</b> <b>condition?</b> And if I have {{anything}} {{more out of}} you [...] " ...|$|E
6000|$|The pause {{of which}} she paid it the {{deference}} was charged like a brimming cup. [...] "Is that what you really meant by <b>your</b> <b>condition</b> just now--that when I do see him I shall not speak to him?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Once {{you told}} me,' said Cadurcis, 'that {{you would not}} marry me {{without the consent of}} your father; then, most unfairly, you added to <b>your</b> <b>conditions</b> the consent of your mother.

6000|$|... 'Then, take care, you,' said Wegg, 'that {{you stick}} to <b>your</b> <b>conditions.</b> Mr Venus, if on this auspicious occasion, you {{should happen to}} have a drop of {{anything}} not quite so mild as tea in the 'ouse, I think I'd take the friendly liberty of asking you for a specimen of it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You must please {{not make}} love to me, or I shall have to leave you," [...] she said. [...] "The idea of {{thinking}} about such a thing in <b>your</b> <b>condition!</b> You don't want to send me away, do you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have your}} sister with you, sir, {{and she will}} be of more comfort to you than I can be. <b>Your</b> <b>condition</b> is in some respects an {{advantage}} to you. These creditors of Mountjoy can't force their way in upon you." ...|$|E

6000|$|Q. Though {{you may be}} {{indifferent}} {{and uncertain}} as to dates and times in <b>your</b> present <b>condition</b> and environment, {{this has nothing to}} do with <b>your</b> former <b>condition.</b> You had dates then.

[...] "And of the second, {{seeing that}} it would have come through you, on <b>your</b> <b>conditions,</b> I am indeed glad to be rid.

6000|$|Lord Warburton {{looked at}} him a while, puffing a cigar and {{as if trying to}} see it. [...] "You've been better than you were on the journey, certainly. I wonder how you lived through that. But I don't {{understand}} <b>your</b> <b>condition.</b> I recommend you to try Sicily." ...|$|E
6000|$|Quoth the King: [...] "At this time, {{and at this}} Feast of Pentecost I may {{not refuse}} any one a boon who asketh it of me. So, if these two boons are fit for one of <b>your</b> <b>condition</b> to have, they shall be granted unto you." ...|$|E
6000|$|Lord Etherington felt, perhaps, {{a twinge}} of conscience; for he said, {{something}} hastily, [...] "Pray go on, good woman, if you really have any thing to communicate {{to me as a}} magistrate--it is time <b>your</b> <b>condition</b> was somewhat mended, and I will cause you to be cared for directly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sir Richard Grenville, if I {{had been}} a guilty man to my noble captain, as I have to God, I had not come here this day to you, from whom villainy has never found favor, nor ever will; for I know <b>your</b> <b>conditions</b> well, sir; and trust in the Lord, that if you will be pleased to hear me, you shall know mine." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just as {{you please}} about that," [...] said Mrs. Durgin, with the same impassioned quiet that showed in her son's {{handsome}} face and made it one angry red to his yellow hair. [...] "We've got along without you so far, this summer, and I guess we can {{the rest of the}} time. And the sooner you work off <b>your</b> <b>conditions</b> the better, I presume." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'No, an American {{would not}} have done that, I'm thankful to say. They take fees, but they don't ask charity, yet." [...] We went on to exult in the noble {{independence}} of the American character in all classes, at some length. We talked at the Altrurian, but he did not seem to hear us. At last he asked, with a faint sigh: [...] "Then, in <b>your</b> <b>conditions,</b> a kindly impulse to aid one who needs your help is something to be guarded against as possibly pernicious?" ...|$|R
