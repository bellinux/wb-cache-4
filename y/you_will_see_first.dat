"Now, {{when you}} get into the Grand Alley, which you will know by its being the broadest, and smoothest, and most splendid grand walk that you ever saw, you must stop for a minute, and look both ways. I'll tell you what <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>see.</b> <b>First,</b> if you turn to the left, that is, toward the east, you will see {{at the end of the}} alley, in that direction, a long range of splendid buildings, {{extending}} across from side to side. In the opposite direction, at the top of a long, gentle slope, a mile and a half away, you will see the grand Triumphal Arch. That is at the barrier of the city. The view is not entirely open, however, out to the arch. About midway, in the centre of the Grand Alley, is a tall obelisk, standing on a high pedestal, and farther along there are one or two fountains. Still you can see the Triumphal Arch very plainly, it is so large, and it stands so high.|$|E

The ability to convert between these different forms of a vector is useful in certain problems involving displacement and velocity, as shown in Section  2, in which you will also work with bearings. ...|$|E
50|$|Charan is {{situated}} among {{a cluster of}} villages located in Alborz mountain range north of Tehran in Iran. The primary access road is from the Chalous Road shortly before ascending towards the Kandivan Tunnel and Karaj Dam. As you approach Khozan Kala, watch for the sign showing Khor Ski area. Follow the road and after 5-7 Kilometers <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> the <b>first</b> village named Arangeh Bozorg (Big Arangeh). Located on the same road are the villages Arangeh Koochak (Samall Arangeh), Si Jan, Abharak, Sar Ziyarat, Jey aka Gey, Charan and Khor, which is located at a high elevation and is {{the location of a}} ski run.|$|R
60|$|And {{therefore}} (as <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> at <b>first</b> sight) {{the first}} two temptations were clearly meant to tempt our Lord to pride; for would they not tempt you and me to pride? If we could feed ourselves by making bread of stones, would not that make us proud enough? So proud, I fear, that we should soon fancy {{that we could do}} without God and His providence, and were masters of nature and all her secrets. If you and I could make the whole city worship and obey us, by casting ourselves off this cathedral unhurt, would not that make us proud enough? So proud, I fear, that we should end in committing some great folly, or great crime in our conceit and vainglory.|$|R

6000|$|My Dear Sir,--I {{agree with}} you, that the song [...] "Katharine Ogie", is very poor stuff, and unworthy, {{altogether}} unworthy, of so beautiful an air. I tried to mend it; but the awkward sound [...] "Ogie," [...] recurring in the rhyme, spoils every attempt at introducing sentiment into the piece. The foregoing song pleases myself; I {{think it is}} in my happiest manner; <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> at the <b>first</b> glance that it suits the air. The subject of the song {{is one of the}} most interesting passages of my youthful days; and I own that I should be much flattered to see the verses set to an air which would ensure celebrity. Perhaps, after all,'tis the still glowing prejudice of my heart that throws a borrowed lustre over the merits of the composition.|$|R
6000|$|People, {{who have}} never seen, even from the outside, the Parisian world of fashion, have no idea to what an extent it has been invaded by the dog craze. Dogs are driven about in motors and open carriages. They are elaborately clipped and {{powdered}} and beribboned by special [...] "coiffeurs." [...] They wear little buckled coats and blankets, and in motors,--I don't feel quite sure of this,--they wear motor goggles. There {{are at least three}} or four--and for all I know there may be more--fashionable shops in Paris for dogs' supplies. There is one that any curious visitor may easily find at once in the Rue des Petits Champs close to the Avenue de l'Opera. There is another one midway in the galleries of the Palais Royal. In these shops <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>see,</b> in the <b>first</b> place, the chains, collars, and whips that are marks of the servitude in which dogs still live (though, by the way, there are already, I think, dog suffragettes heading a very strong movement). <b>You</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> also the most delicious, fashionable dog coats, very, very simple, fastened in front with one silver clasp, only one. In the Palais Royal shop they advertise, [...] "Newest summer models for 1913 in dogs' tailoring." [...] There are also dogs' beds made in wickerwork in cradle shape with eider-down coverlets worked over with silk.|$|R
6000|$|<b>You</b> <b>will</b> <b>first</b> <b>see</b> in how {{confidential}} {{a manner}} Hoolas Roy was employed, {{and in what}} light he was held: that he was employed to carry some instructions which do not indeed appear, but were accompanied by an order from Mr. Middleton. [...] "When these instructions shall come to you, to put these prisoners in irons and keep them without food, &c." [...] The Begums say, without food and water. Et cetera are words of large import; but he was [...] "to keep them without food, &c., agreeable to my instructions of yesterday." [...] This was a pretty general warrant for sufferings. This Hoolas Roy, this mere news-writer, was not only intrusted with this warrant, but Mr. Middleton declares {{him to be a}} person who was to be received there, and to represent the Nabob, and very justly too; for he, Mr. Middleton, was undoubtedly the real nabob of the country. The man, therefore, whom they talk of in this contemptuous manner in order to make slight of an observation we made, and which I shall make again, and whom they affect to consider as a mere paragraph-monger in some scandalous newspaper, was a man vested by Mr. Middleton with authority equal to that of the Nabob himself.|$|R
60|$|Now, by the {{favour of}} God, {{we can find}} out this. <b>You</b> <b>will</b> <b>see,</b> in the <b>first</b> thirty-seven {{chapters}} of Isaiah's prophecies, a full account of the ways of the Jews in that time, and the reasons why God allowed so fearful a danger to come upon them. The whole first thirty-five chapters belong to each other, and are, so to speak, a spiritual history of the Jews, and the Assyrians, and all the nations round them, for many years. A spiritual history--that is, not merely a history of what they did, but of what they were, what was in their inmost hearts, and thoughts, and spirits; a spiritual history--that is, not merely of what they thought they were doing, but of what God saw that they were doing--a history of God's mind about them all. Isaiah had God's spirit on him; and so he saw what was going on round him in the same light in which God saw it, and hated it, or praised it, only according as it was good, and according to the good Spirit of God, or bad, and contrary to that Spirit. So Isaiah's history of his own nation, and the nations around him, was very unlike what they would have written for themselves; just as I am afraid he would write a very different history of England now, from what we should write, if we were set to do it. Now what Isaiah thought of the doings of his countrymen, the Jews, I must tell you in another sermon, next Sunday. It will be enough this morning to speak of the king of Assyria.|$|R
60|$|This is why, I suppose, in {{the world}} of Parisian luxury, the dog is ousting the infant altogether. <b>You</b> <b>will</b> <b>see,</b> as I said, no {{children}} on the boulevards and avenues. <b>You</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> dogs by the hundred. Every motor or open barouche that passes up the Champs Elysées, with its little white cloud of fluffy parasols and garden-hats, has a dainty, beribboned dog sitting among its occupants: in every avenue and promenade <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> hundreds of clipped poodles and toy spaniels; in all the fashionable churches <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> dogs bowed at their devotions.|$|R
