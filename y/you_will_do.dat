5|$|The {{best thing}} of all is that the Greeks should not {{go to war with}} each other at all, but give the gods hearty thanks if by all {{speaking}} with one voice, and joining hands like people crossing a stream, {{they may be able to}} repel the attacks of barbarians and save themselves and their cities. But if this is altogether impossible, in the present juncture at least we ought to be unanimous and on our guard, when we see the bloated armaments and the vast proportions assumed by the war in the west. For even now it is evident to any one who pays even a moderate attention to public affairs, that whether the Carthaginians conquer the Romans, or the Romans the Carthaginians, it is in every way improbable that the victors will remain contented with the empire of Sicily and Italy. They will move forward: and will extend their forces and their designs farther than we could wish. Wherefore, I beseech you all to be on your guard against the danger of the crisis, and above all you, O King. <b>You</b> <b>will</b> <b>do</b> this, if you abandon the policy of weakening the Greeks, and thus rendering them an easy prey to the invader; and consult on the contrary for their good as you would for your own person, and have a care for all parts of Greece alike, as part and parcel of your own domains. If you act in this spirit, the Greeks will be your warm friends and faithful coadjutors in all your undertakings; while foreigners will be less ready to form designs against you, seeing with dismay the firm loyalty of the Greeks. If you are eager for action, turn your eyes to the west, and let your thoughts dwell upon the wars in Italy. Wait with coolness the turn of events there, and seize the opportunity to strike for universal dominion. Nor is the present crisis unfavourable for such a hope. But I intreat of you to postpone your controversies and wars with the Greeks to a time of greater tranquillity; and make it your supreme aim to retain the power of making peace or war with them at your own will. For if once you allow the clouds now gathering in the west to settle upon Greece, I fear exceedingly that the power of making peace or war, and in a word all these games which we are now playing against each other, will be so completely knocked out of the hands of us all, that we shall be praying heaven to grant us only this power of making war or peace with each other at our own will and pleasure, and of settling our own disputes.|$|E

500|$|John, which {{regularly}} describes Jesus' opponents {{simply as}} [...] "the Jews", is more consistently hostile to [...] "the Jews" [...] {{than any other}} body of New Testament writing. Historian and former Roman Catholic priest James Carroll states: [...] "The climax of this movement comes in chapter 8 of John, when Jesus is portrayed as denouncing 'the Jews' who were gathered at the Temple as the offspring of Satan." [...] In [...] Jesus tells the Jews: [...] "You are of your father the devil, and the desires of your father <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>do.</b> He was a murderer from the beginning, and he stood not in the truth; because truth is not in him." [...] In [...] and , [...] "the Jews" [...] are depicted as wishing to kill Jesus. However, Carroll cautions that this and similar statements in the Gospel of Matthew and the 1 Thessalonians {{should be viewed as}} [...] "evidence not of Jew hatred but of sectarian conflicts among Jews" [...] {{in the early years of}} the Christian church.|$|E

500|$|While {{the film}} portrays Andy {{escaping}} to freedom through a sewer pipe {{described as a}} [...] "river of shit," [...] Robbins crawls through a mixture of water, chocolate syrup, and sawdust. The stream into which Robbins emerges was actually certified toxic by a chemist according to production designer Terence Marsh. Of the scene, Robbins said, [...] "when you're doing a film, {{you want to be}} a good soldier—you don't want to be the one that gets in the way. So <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>do</b> things as an actor that are compromising to your physical health and safety." [...] As for the scene were Andy rebelliously plays music over the prison announcement system, it was Robbins' idea for Andy to turn the music up and not shut it off. While in the finished film the inmates watch Rita Hayworth in Gilda (1946), they were originally intended to be watching Billy Wilder's The Lost Weekend (1945), a film about the dangers of alcohol. However, the footage was too costly to procure from Paramount Pictures, and producer Niki Marvin approached The Shawshank Redemptions domestic distribution rights-holder Columbia Pictures, who offered a list of lower-priced titles, one of which was Gilda.|$|E

2500|$|Although Wythe {{served as}} what {{would now be}} called a {{justice of the peace}} in Elizabeth City County during colonial times, his {{reputation}} as the [...] "American Aristides" [...] derived from Wythe's judicial service performed after Virginia became a state, as well as from his scholarship discussed above. The oath Wythe drafted for its admiralty judges indicates his judicial philosophy, [...] "You shall swear that ... <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>do</b> equal right to all manner of people, great and small, high and low, rich and poor, according to equity and good conscience, and the laws and usages of Virginia, without respect to persons. ... And, finally, in all things belonging to your said office, during your continuance therein you shall faithfully, justly and truly, according {{to the best of your}} skill and judgment, do equal and impartial justice, without fraud, favor or affection, or partiality."

2500|$|In 1917, it {{was decided}} to re-establish the liberal arts college, and on June 14, 1918, the Eastern Nazarene College was {{chartered}} with degree-granting authority in the state of Rhode Island, while secondary education would remain as the Eastern Nazarene Academy. Choosing a new name, however, would be difficult: the school was now a liberal arts college and a Nazarene institution. Candidates included: [...] "Northeastern Nazarene College", [...] "Bresee Memorial College", [...] "Nazarene College of the Northeast", and [...] "Nazarene College and Bresee Theological Institute". General Superintendent John W. Goodwin can be credited with the chosen name, as he wrote to Hiram F. Reynolds, also a general superintendent and a long-time supporter of the school: [...] "I know <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>do</b> your best for our New England College. I should be glad if they would change the name to the Eastern Nazarene College, or something like that. It would seem we must have a school there, although it moves along hard and slow." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{clash between}} order and chaos, {{and the people}} caught in between, plays an {{important}} role in Babylon 5. The conflict between two unimaginably powerful older races, the Vorlons and the Shadows, is represented as a battle between two competing ideologies, each seeking to turn the humans and the other younger races to their beliefs. The Vorlons represent an authoritarian philosophy: <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>do</b> what we tell you to, because we tell you to do it. The Vorlon question, [...] "Who are you?" [...] focuses on identity as a catalyst for shaping personal goals; the intention is not to solicit a correct answer, but to [...] "tear down the artifices we construct around ourselves until we're left facing ourselves, not our roles." [...] The Shadows represent another authoritarian philosophy cloaked in a disguise of evolution through fire (as shown in the episode in which Sheridan goes to Z'ha'dum and when he refuses to cooperate, Justin tells him: [...] "But we do what we're told... and so will you!"), of sowing the seeds of conflict in order to engender progress. The question the Shadows ask is [...] "What do you want?" [...] In contrast to the Vorlons, they place personal desire and ambition first, using it to shape identity, encouraging conflict between groups who choose to serve their own glory or profit. The representation of order and chaos was informed by the Babylonian myth that the universe was born in the conflict between both. The climax of this conflict comes with the younger races' exposing of the Vorlons' and the Shadows' [...] "true faces" [...] and the rejection of both philosophies, heralding the dawn of a new age without their interference.|$|E
