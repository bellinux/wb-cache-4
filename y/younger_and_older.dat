5|$|Adult {{cartoonist}} Antonucci conceived Ed, Edd n Eddy {{while working}} on a commercial design. Antonucci pitched the series to Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon. Both studios {{were interested in the}} series, but each demanded creative control and Antonucci refused. Cartoon Network ended up commissioning the show after agreeing to let Antonucci have control of the show. After its debut, the series was a success in Nielsen ratings, popular among <b>younger</b> <b>and</b> <b>older</b> viewers. Met with generally positive reviews, the season earned Antonucci a Reuben Award for Best Television Animation.|$|E
5|$|Ed, Edd n Eddy {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. Viewed from 31 million households worldwide in 29 different countries, Ed, Edd n Eddy was popular among both <b>younger</b> <b>and</b> <b>older</b> viewers. During its run, the series won a Reuben Award, two Leo Awards and a SOCAN Award {{out of a}} total of 11 award nominations, which include one Reuben Award, six Leo Awards, one Annie Award, two Kids' Choice Awards and the SOCAN Award. It remains the longest-running original Cartoon Network series and Canadian-made animated series to date.|$|E

An extension of The Tide light rail system from Norfolk to the oceanfront is currently being studied. For years, Virginia Beach residents have debated on whether or not to extend The Tide from Norfolk into its borders with the apparent divide falling between <b>younger</b> <b>and</b> <b>older</b> residents and the potential cost to Virginia Beach taxpayers. In November 2016, residents voted on a referendum proposing that would extend the light rail from Norfolk to Virginia Beach with 57% against the rail extension and 43% for the extension.|$|E

5|$|Veteran Disney Channel writers Schooley and McCorkle were {{recruited}} by the network to develop an animated series that could attract both <b>younger</b> <b>and</b> <b>older</b> audiences, and conceived Kim Possible as a show about a talented action heroine and her less competent sidekick. Inspired by the scarcity of female-led animated series at the time, the episodes, {{some of which are}} based on the creators' own high school experiences, combine elements of action, adventure, drama, romance and comedy to appeal to both girls and boys, while parodying the James Bond franchise, spy and superhero films, and teen sitcoms. Distinct from other Disney Channel shows in its use of self-referential humor, Schooley and McCorkle developed fast-paced sitcom-style dialogue to cater to adult viewers. Set in fictional Middleton, USA, the show's setting and locations exhibit a retro-influenced aesthetic. With a strong emphasis on modern-day technology and the Internet, the series also explores themes such as feminism, girl power and relationships, and receives heavy comparisons to other female-driven action shows such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Alias and The Powerpuff Girls.|$|E
5|$|Large green-head ant colonies exhibit age caste polyethism, {{where the}} younger workers act as nurses {{and tend to}} the brood and the older workers go out and forage. In smaller colonies, age caste polyethism does not occur, with nursing and {{foraging}} initiated by both <b>younger</b> <b>and</b> <b>older</b> workers. These results show that ageing is not the mechanism that drives labour among colonies. The emergence of age polyethism in larger colonies {{is a result of}} worker specialisation. Workers in small colonies usually tend to the brood much more than those in larger colonies, but {{this is due to the}} differentiated social environment between small and large societies. In contrast, old workers from large colonies forage for significant periods of time, and those in small colonies forage less. A predatory species such as the green-head ant may not be able to increase prey retrieval within its environment, even if there is a larger foraging force. This means that the workers may have to spend more time foraging to retrieve any prey item. Contact among nestmates also differs between small and large colonies, strongly suggesting that colony size regulates contact rates. Higher contact rates allow colonies to scan their environment and determine their needs more quickly, which makes a colony react faster. Task allocation patterns (referring to the way that tasks are chosen) are different in small and large colonies, which may determine the contact rate.|$|E
5|$|The video {{starts at}} the Clarksons' household. There, {{she and her husband}} are engaged in a heated {{argument}} and he threatens to smash down a picture of the family at one point. Time freezes still and her husband becomes immobile; Clarkson, however, is immune to this. Looking around her house, she sees her younger self. Hand in hand, the <b>younger</b> <b>and</b> <b>older</b> versions of Clarkson relive her troubled childhood as various painful memories are seen, such as the younger Clarkson making a picture for her father who tosses it into the sink while talking on the phone, and Clarkson's mother making an unappreciated dinner for her father as she puts the father's dinner into the bin. These events drive her mother to the point of taking pills before closing the door in the younger Clarkson's face, so that she doesn't see her starting to cry. The breaking point is finally seen when Clarkson's parents have a physical fight and throw objects at each other. Soon after, Clarkson's father packs his bags and leaves despite the younger Clarkson's pleas for him to stay. The older Clarkson runs back in time to the present, and instead of fighting with her husband, they make up. They then see that their daughter in the video had seen them fight, and they embrace her and each other. Throughout the music video, Clarkson is shown singing on the front porch, her mother's bed and a room full of mirrors, reflecting an image of her younger self. Note that Kelly is holding Kennedy's hand in the scene where the childhood memories are revealed.|$|E

In contrast, we found no significant age differences in <b>young</b> <b>and</b> <b>older</b> adults' ability to distinguish between high- and low-danger situations. The differences between <b>young</b> <b>and</b> <b>older</b> adults on the face task were independent of age differences in older adults' fluid IQ.

25|$|The {{material}} {{of the floor}} of the canyon system between Candor and Melas chasmata is grooved. This is interpreted to be alluvial deposits and/or material that has collapsed or contracted by the removal of ice or water. There are also portions of older and younger massive floor {{material of}} volcaniclastic origin - only separated in age by crater distribution. Also there is etched massive floor material that is like the <b>younger</b> <b>and</b> <b>older</b> massive material except that it has wind erosion features on it. There are also a few spires of undivided material composed of the same material as the canyon walls.|$|E
25|$|A schema (pl. schemata) is {{the mental}} {{framework}} that is created as children {{interact with their}} physical and social environments. For example, many 3-year-olds insist that the sun is alive because it comes {{up in the morning}} and goes down at night. According to Piaget, these children are operating based on a simple cognitive schema that things that move are alive. At any age, children rely on their current cognitive structures to understand the world around them. Moreover, <b>younger</b> <b>and</b> <b>older</b> children may often interpret and respond to the same objects and events in very different ways because cognitive structures take different forms at different ages.|$|E
25|$|When the {{underlying}} cause of sleep problems is not immediately obvious, behavioral treatments are usually the first suggested. These range from patient education about sleep hygiene to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Studies of both <b>younger</b> <b>and</b> <b>older</b> adults have compared CBT to medication and found that CBT {{should be considered a}} first-line and cost-effective intervention for chronic insomnia, not least because gains may be maintained at long-term follow-up. Sleep physicians and psychologists, at least in the US, are not in agreement about who should perform CBT nor whether sleep centers should be required to have psychologists on staff. In the UK the number of CBT-trained therapists is limited so CBT is not widely available on the NHS.|$|E

25|$|As we age, deficits {{are seen}} {{in the ability to}} integrate, manipulate, and reorganize the {{contents}} of working memory in order to complete higher level cognitive tasks such as problem solving, decision making, goal setting, and planning. More research must be completed in order to determine what the exact cause of these age-related deficits in working memory are. It is likely that attention, processing speed, capacity reduction, and inhibitory control may all play a role in these age-related deficits. The brain regions that are active during working memory tasks are also being evaluated, and research has shown that different parts of the brain are activated during working memory in younger adults as compared to older adults. This suggests that <b>younger</b> <b>and</b> <b>older</b> adults are performing these tasks differently.|$|E
25|$|The {{influence}} of generation identity on the reminiscence bump {{can be attributed}} to the idea that all members of the subgroup are likely to have memories of similar types of experiences. Evidence attesting to the {{influence of}} generation identity on the reminiscence bump has been witnessed in populations that have experience with traumatic events. In 1999, researchers compared <b>younger</b> <b>and</b> <b>older</b> groups of Bangladeshis. The younger group (ages 20–42) showed the usual increase in memories during the reminiscence bump while the older group (ages 46–86) showed a second increase in memories between the ages of 35 and 55. The second bump experienced by the older group corresponded to the period of the Bangladesh Liberation War. The two generations showed similar patterns and timing of memory recall within their own subgroup, suggesting that they did have similar experiences, either living or not living through the war. This finding may suggests that each generation remember personal events and generational events.|$|E
25|$|One major storyline {{during this}} period was the {{discovery}} of Batch SW6, a group of clones of the early Legion (from their Adventure Comics days), created by the Dominators. Giffen's original conclusion for the storyline was that the clones would eventually have been revealed {{to be the real}} Legion, and the ones whose adventures had been chronicled since the 1950s were actually the clones. The adult Legion's secret programming would kick in, forcing them to fight the younger Legion and leading to a fight to the death in which Legionnaires on both teams would die, with the victims’ names being picked at random. Afterwards, the older team would explore the Vega System as a 30th-century version of the Omega Men in a new series while the younger team would act as the main Legion on Earth. Giffen's other conclusion was for several of the <b>younger</b> <b>and</b> <b>older</b> Legionnaires to die while liberating Earth from the Dominion. The older Legion would defend Earth while the younger Legion would act as the last line of defense for the United Planets as the Omega Men.|$|E
