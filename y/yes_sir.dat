5|$|In 2010 it was {{announced}} that Crass would release The Crassical Collection, remastered reissues of their back catalogue. Three former members objected, threatening legal action. Despite their concerns the project went ahead, and the remasters were eventually released. First in the series was The Feeding of the 5000, released in August 2010. Stations of the Crass followed in October, with new editions of Penis Envy, Christ – The Album, <b>Yes</b> <b>Sir,</b> I Will and Ten Notes on a Summer's Day released in 2011 and 2012. Critics praised the improved sound quality and new packaging of the remastered albums.|$|E
5|$|Crass {{have said}} that their musical {{influences}} were seldom drawn from rock, but more from classical music (particularly Benjamin Britten, on whose work, Rimbaud states, some of Crass' riffs are based), free jazz, European atonality and avant-garde composers such as John Cage and Karlheinz Stockhausen. Crass influenced the anarchist movement in the UK, the US and beyond. The growth of anarcho-punk spurred interest in anarchist ideas. The band have also claimed credit for revitalising the peace movement and the UK Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Others contend that they overestimated their influence, their radicalising effect on militants notwithstanding. Crass' philosophical and aesthetic influences on 1980s punk bands were far-reaching, although few mimicked their later free-form style (heard on <b>Yes</b> <b>Sir,</b> I Will and their final recording, Ten Notes on a Summer's Day). Their painted and collage black-and-white record sleeves (by Gee Vaucher) may have influenced later artists such as Banksy (with whom Vaucher collaborated) and the subvertising movement. Anti-folk artist Jeffrey Lewis's 2007 album, 12 Crass Songs, features acoustic covers of Crass material.|$|E

500|$|The phrase [...] "yes sir, <b>yes</b> <b>sir,</b> three bags full sir" [...] {{has been}} used to {{describe}} any obsequious or craven subordinate. It is attested from 1910, and originally was common in the British Royal Navy.|$|E
6000|$|... "Pardieu! <b>yes,</b> 'Old <b>Sir</b> Oliver's {{heart is}} still stout,' {{said one of}} his court. 'Else had it been out of keeping {{with the rest of}} him,' quoth the prince.

500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Quebec's Quiet Revolution, tensions between francophones within the province and anglophones escalated as a provincial movement, led by the governing Parti Québécois, to separate from Canada reached its peak in the late 1970s. Seeking to explain Quebec's independence movement, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's (CBC) Toronto affiliate asked Roch Carrier, whose debut novel La Guerre, <b>Yes</b> <b>Sir</b> had been popular among both French and English Canadians, to explain [...] "what does Quebec want?" ...|$|E
500|$|Subsequent {{releases}} (including the singles [...] "How Does It Feel? (to Be the Mother of a Thousand Dead)" [...] and [...] "Sheep Farming in the Falklands" [...] and {{the album}} <b>Yes</b> <b>Sir,</b> I Will) saw the band's sound {{go back to}} basics and were issued as [...] "tactical responses" [...] to political situations. They anonymously produced 20,000 copies of a flexi-disc with a live recording of [...] "Sheep Farming...", copies of which were randomly inserted into the sleeves of other records by sympathetic workers at the Rough Trade Records distribution warehouse to spread their views to those who might not otherwise hear them.|$|E
2500|$|Sheila Fischman's {{translation}} of La Guerre, <b>Yes</b> <b>Sir!</b> (published under that title in French and English and meaning roughly [...] "War, you bet!") by Roch Carrier leaves many sacres {{in the original}} Quebec French, since they have no real equivalent in English. She gives a brief explanation and history of these terms in her introduction, including a few not listed here.|$|E
6000|$|... "La, <b>sir!</b> <b>yes.</b> I'm a lone woman, sir, with nothin' to do {{but take}} care of myself; an' I'm that fond of Mrs Willis--she's like my own mother." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh <b>yes,</b> you can, <b>sir.</b> Try it, sir, {{no fear of}} 'ee. Sure it's {{yourself}} as can do it, an' no mistake," [...] were the remarks with which his explanation was interrupted.|$|R

2500|$|<b>Yes</b> <b>Sir,</b> Mr. Bones (1951), {{is based}} around {{a young child}} who finds a rest home for retired {{minstrel}} performers. In [...] "flashback" [...] sequences, a number of actual minstrel veterans, including Scatman Crothers, Freeman Davis (aka [...] "Brother Bones"), Ned Haverly, Phil Arnold, [...] "endmen" [...] Cotton Watts and Slim Williams, the dancing team of Boyce and Evans, and the comic duo Ches Davis and Emmett Miller, perform in the roles they popularized in Minstrel shows.|$|E
2500|$|By the way Mr. Speaker, did {{you know}} that I am a {{military}} hero? <b>Yes</b> <b>sir,</b> {{in the days of the}} Black Hawk War I fought, bled and came away [...] [...] [...] I was not at Stillman's defeat, but I was about as near it as Cass was Hull's surrender, and, like him, I saw the place very soon afterwards [...] [...] [...] If he saw any live, fighting Indians, it was more than I did; but I had a good many bloody struggles with the mosquitoes, and although I never fainted from the loss of blood, I can truly say I was often very hungry.|$|E
2500|$|RUTH: <b>Yes,</b> <b>sir,</b> I were; I {{were brought}} {{up to be a}} thief. Every soul as I knowed was a thief, and the best thief was the best thought on. Maybe a kid not long born ought to have knowed better. I dunno, I must ha' been born bad, for it seemed right enough to me. Well, it was in prison and out o' prison—three months here and six months there—till I was sixteen. I {{sometimes}} thinks as if they'd bin half as ready to show me how to go right as they was to punish me for goin' wrong, I might have took the right turnin' and stuck to it afore this. At sixteen I got seven-year for shop-liftin', and was sent out to Port Phillip. I soon got a ticket and tried service and needlework, but no one wouldn't have me; and I got sick and tired of it all, and began to think o' putting an end to it, when I met a smooth-spoken chap—a gentleman, if you please—as wanted to save me from the danger afore me. Well, wot odds? He was a psalm-singing villain, and he soon left me. No need to tell the rest—to such as you it can't be told. I'm 'most as bad as I can be—as bad as I can be! ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, <b>sir,</b> <b>yes,</b> {{your honor}} shall be obeyed; {{but there is}} a straight, soldierly-looking fellow among them, that I think might be persuaded to enlist, if he were {{detained}} till morning. I doubt, sir, by his walk, but he has served already." ...|$|R

6000|$|Rollo {{wished to}} get a small scarf, and the ground of {{it was to be}} green. This was in {{accordance}} with the instructions which Lucy had given him. He found great difficulty, however, in making the shopman understand what he wanted. To all that Rollo said, the shopman smiled, and said only, [...] "Yes, <b>sir,</b> <b>yes,</b> sir," [...] and took down continually scarfs and aprons of different kinds, and showed them to Rollo, to see if any of them were what he wanted.|$|R

60|$|Well, <b>yes,</b> dear <b>Sir</b> Smelfungus, if {{it gives}} you {{pleasure}} to put it so--just that; a smattering, an all-round smattering. But remember that in this matter the man of science is always influenced by ideas derived from his own pursuits as specialist. He is for ever thinking what sort of education will produce more specialists in future; and as a rule he is thinking what sort of education will produce men capable in future of advancing science. Now to advance science, to discover new snails, or invent new ethyl compounds, is not and cannot be the main object {{of the mass of}} humanity. What the mass wants is just unspecialised knowledge--the kind of knowledge that enables men to get comfortably and creditably and profitably through life, to meet emergencies as they rise, to know their way through the world, to use their faculties in all circumstances to the best advantage. And for this purpose what is wanted is, not the methods, but the results of science.|$|R
2500|$|World War I {{brought a}} crisis in his development. Military service {{disrupted}} his life when {{at the age of}} 42 he was in the army. He was never able to work uninterrupted or over a period of time, and as a result he left many unfinished works and undeveloped [...] "beginnings". On one occasion, a superior officer demanded to know if he was [...] "this notorious Schoenberg, then"; Schoenberg replied: [...] "Beg to report, <b>sir,</b> <b>yes.</b> Nobody wanted to be, someone had to be, so I let it be me" [...] (according to Norman , this is a reference to Schoenberg's apparent [...] "destiny" [...] as the [...] "Emancipator of Dissonance").|$|R
