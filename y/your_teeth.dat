From 1954 until 1959, Pinter acted under the stage name David Baron. In all, Pinter played over 20 roles under that name. [...] To supplement his income from acting, Pinter worked as a waiter, a postman, a bouncer, and a snow-clearer, meanwhile, according to Mark Batty, [...] "harbouring ambitions as a poet and writer." [...] In October 1989 Pinter recalled: [...] "I was in English rep as an actor for about 12 years. My favourite roles were undoubtedly the sinister ones.

500|$|The {{lyrics of}} [...] "Pretty Hurts" [...] {{are related to}} third-wave {{feminism}} and self-empowerment. It confronts society's standards and stereotypes with regard to female beauty. The song opens with a recorded snippet of a beauty pageant judge questioning Beyoncé on her life aspirations, to which she replies, [...] "My aspiration in life would be... to be happy". The sample is used to frame the song {{in the context of}} the singer's childhood. According to Michael Cragg from The Guardian, the snippets were used to question the singer's [...] "drive and desire that's got her to where she is today, and whether the struggle was entirely worth it". The song then transcends into a depiction of Beyoncé as a beauty pageant contest awaiting judgment in the lyrics, [...] "Mama said, 'You're a pretty girl, what's in your head, it doesn't matter. Brush your hair, fix <b>your</b> <b>teeth.</b> What you wear is all that matters". The second verse of [...] "Pretty Hurts"—"Blonder hair, flat chest/ TV says bigger is better/ South Beach, sugar free/ Vogue says thinner is better"—serve as an analysis of female body image and society's obsession with physical perfection.|$|E

500|$|In September 1963, after Cox was {{discharged}} from the Army, he and Hendrix moved to Clarksville, Tennessee, and formed a band called the King Kasuals. Hendrix had watched Butch Snipes play with his teeth in Seattle and by now Alphonso 'Baby Boo' Young, the other guitarist in the band, was performing this guitar gimmick. Not to be upstaged, Hendrix learned to play with his teeth. He later commented: [...] "The idea of doing that came to me...in Tennessee. Down there {{you have to play}} with <b>your</b> <b>teeth</b> or else you get shot. There's a trail of broken teeth all over the stage." [...] Although they began playing low-paying gigs at obscure venues, the band eventually moved to Nashville's Jefferson Street, which was the traditional heart of the city's black community and home to a thriving rhythm and blues music scene. They earned a brief residency playing at a popular venue in town, the Club del Morocco, and {{for the next two years}} Hendrix made a living performing at a circuit of venues throughout the South that were affiliated with the Theater Owners' Booking Association (TOBA), widely known as the Chitlin' Circuit. In addition to playing in his own band, Hendrix performed as a backing musician for various soul, R, and blues musicians, including Wilson Pickett, Slim Harpo, Sam Cooke, and Jackie Wilson.|$|E

Calling it [...] "awry", Alexis Petridis of The Guardian claimed that [...] "Bitch I'm Madonna" [...] is [...] "a fantastic title {{in search of a}} song. In lieu of one, producer Diplo comes up with a kind of hybrid of EDM and happy hardcore and throws Nicki Minaj at her most hyperactive into the mix; the result genuinely sets <b>your</b> <b>teeth</b> on edge." [...] Criticizing Rebel Heart for being [...] "overworked", Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine found that [...] "the duality of its title [...] muddled by the inclusion of garish party jams like the infuriatingly catchy but lyrically cringe-inducing 'Bitch I'm Madonna'". John Murphy of musicOMH remarked that the song [...] "never quite lives up to its fantastic title, and just sounds a bit of a mess, trying to cram in Diplo-produced dance-hall rhythms, a dubstep breakdown and the seemingly now obligatory Nicki Minaj guest rap". Evan Sawdey of PopMatters opined that the song—and another Rebel Heart track, [...] "Illuminati"—"absolutely reek of desperation, wanting so badly to shock and offend listeners that they fail to resolve as satisfying songs first and foremost".|$|E

500|$|In a {{retrospective}} {{of the first}} season in Entertainment Weekly, the episode was rated a D+, being described as having a [...] "garden-variety werewolf plot" [...] that offered [...] "nothing much to sink <b>your</b> <b>teeth</b> into". Zack Handlen, writing for The A.V. Club, described the episode as [...] "thoroughly predictable". He found the plot to be unoriginal, believing that it existed [...] "more {{out of a sense}} of tradition than any real desire to tell a specific story"; however, he praised the acting in the episode, especially that of guest star Michael Horse. Matt Haigh, writing for Den of Geek, described [...] "Shapes" [...] as being [...] "a very basic and slightly drawn-out werewolf and detective story", though overall finding that the episode's visual effects and atmosphere meant that it [...] "mostly comes out good in the end". [...] "Shapes" [...] has been criticized for seeming like a [...] "werewolf tale with Native American trappings", with its attempts at political correctness being seen as forced. However, it was praised for not adhering to the [...] "noble savage" [...] archetype in its portrayal of the Native American characters. Jane Goldman, in The X-Files Book of the Unexplained, feels that the episode seriously misrepresents the folklore it portrays, noting that [...] "for many natives, calling a crazed, man-eating beast 'Manitou' is like calling Charles Manson 'God'". The plot for [...] "Shapes" [...] was also adapted as a novel for young adults in 1996 by Ellen Steiber.|$|E
500|$|Much {{like the}} band's {{previous}} work Astraea is considered primarily as mathcore. This is {{displayed in the}} theoretical complexity of their music, such as odd time signatures like 9/13, polyrhythmic drumming and use of dynamics, akin to bands such as Converge, Radiohead and Sigur Rós. Their sound {{is seen as a}} [...] "stylistic schism" [...] between [...] "Dillinger Escape Plan-esque tech-metalcore, grandstanding prog rock and modish synthesised pop" [...] and fusing aesthetics from shoegaze, space rock, ambient, black metal, hardcore punk, jazz, pop, progressive rock and techno. The band is noted for their two vocalists who utilise both screaming and singing vocals, and the album is described as featuring more 'clean vocals' than previous albums. The band's vocal diversity is said to: [...] "immediately creates a rich and textured sonic world". Eva has been seen as pushing her vocals [...] "further than ever before, displaying extremity, contrasted with canorous beauty", with her singing voice being compared to the dream pop stylings of Grimes and Cocteau Twins. When Eva Spence has been asked about the album's musical approach, is much more 'hard-hitting' and 'more direct' than previous albums. She was quoted saying that the album is much more accessible than their previous albums: [...] "You can get <b>your</b> <b>teeth</b> into it much quicker, people who didn't have patience before with our music before will be into this record. It's still technical, but we're using the mathy bits more sparingly." ...|$|E
500|$|For {{the role}} of Edward Bloom, Burton spoke with Jack Nicholson, Spielberg's initial choice for the role. Burton had {{previously}} worked with Nicholson on Batman (1989) and Mars Attacks! (1996). In order to depict Nicholson as the young Bloom, Burton intended to {{use a combination of}} computer-generated imagery and prosthetic makeup. The director then decided to cast around for the two actors in question. Jinks and Cohen, who were then working with Ewan McGregor on Down with Love (2003), suggested that Burton cast both McGregor and Albert Finney for Edward. Burton later compared McGregor's acting style to regular colleague Johnny Depp. Viewing Finney's performance in Tom Jones (1963), Burton found him similar to McGregor, and coincidentally found a People magazine article comparing the two. McGregor, being Scottish, found it easier performing with a Southern American English accent. [...] "It's a much easier accent to do than a standard American accent because you can really hear it. You can get <b>your</b> <b>teeth</b> into it. Standard American is much harder because it's more lyrical." [...] The same dual casting applied to {{the role of}} Bloom's wife, Sandra, who would be played by Jessica Lange and Alison Lohman. Burton commented that he was impressed with Lohman's performance in White Oleander (2002). Burton's girlfriend, Helena Bonham Carter, was also cast in two roles. Her prosthetic makeup for The Witch took five hours to apply. [...] "I was pregnant throughout filming, so it was weird being a pregnant witch," [...] the actress reflected. [...] "I had morning sickness, so all those fumes and the make-up and the rubber...it was hideous." ...|$|E
