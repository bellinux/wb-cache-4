40|$|The {{changes of}} {{secretory}} component (referred to as SC) in the gastric mucosa of various gastric diseases were investigated by immunofluorescent technics. In the foveolar cells of normal gastric mucosa characteristic <b>granular</b> <b>fluorescence</b> of free SC (referred to as FSC) was observed intensely. However, the fluorescence of FSC showed various patterns {{corresponding to the}} mucosal changes with intestinal metaplasia; i. e., specific <b>granular</b> <b>fluorescence</b> of FSC was observed in goblet cells in low grade intestinal metaplasia but not observed in goblet cells in the mucosa of advanced stages of intestinal metaplasia. The specific <b>granular</b> <b>fluorescence</b> of FSC which is seen in normal conditions, decreased in the absorptive cells with advanced stage of intestinal metaplasia. The diminished fluorescence of FSC in the advanced stage of intestinal metaplasia are considered to suggest the depressive function of the secretory immune system. The detection patterns of FSC in gastric carcinoma were also found in various manners according to the histological types; i. e., generally no cytoplasmic except for a very weak fluorescence in the well differentiated types, and very strong but not <b>granular</b> <b>fluorescence</b> of FSC was observed, in contrast, {{in the case of}} signet ring cell carcinoma. FSC detection in the carcinoma tissue showing aberrent patterns was considered to he interesting in the elucidation of dedifferentiation of the tumor cells associated with the secretory immune system...|$|R

They consisted of electron dense deposits mainly subepithelial in location; mild mesangial hypercellularity and matrix increase. Immunofluorescence with anti-rat gammaglobulin was positive, showing <b>granular</b> <b>fluorescence</b> in relation with basement membrane and mesangium. The possibility is raised that these lesions are due to the pathogenic action of immune complexes, the antigen being one arising during the necrosis of the renal papilla.

40|$|T-antigens of transplanted hamster tumors {{induced by}} human {{adenovirus}} type 12 were studied by fluorescent antibody technique within 24 hours after differential hypothermia (DH) treatment, {{in which one}} side cheek pouch tumor was warmed at 37 ± 1 ℃ under generalized hypothermia {{of the body and}} the other side tumor at 20 ± 1 ℃ for 10 hours. A high proportion of the tumor cells in the viable portions of the control tumors demonstrated specific fluorescent staining in three type. The most striking and consistent pattern was the presence of numerous fluorescent particles in the cytoplasm, which were granular and fleck-like shapes. A second type of fluorescence was fluorescent particles in the nucleus in addition to the cytoplasmic staining, and a third type was homogenous staining of nucleus. Immediately after DH treatment, the treated warmed tumor cells presented diminution of fluorescent staining, especially large numbers of <b>granular</b> <b>fluorescences</b> in the cytoplasms. Fleck-like and homogenous nuclear staining of the treated tumor cells scattered even at 10 and 15 hours after DH treatment, when treated tumor cells revealed necrobiotic findings in sections of HE and nucleic acid stain. But no fluorescence was observed at 20 and 24 hours after DH treatment, while not-treated hypothermic tumor cells demonstrated about same fluorescent staining as control tumor cells. It was suggested that cytoplasmic <b>granular</b> <b>fluorescence</b> diminished because DH treatment had an effect on thermo-sensitivity of T-antigen because DH treatment had an effect on thermo-sensitivity of T-antigen and/or inhibited T-antigen production, as well as loss of flecklike and hemogenous nuclear fluorescence was due to tumor cell necrosis by DH treatment...|$|R
25|$|Immunofluorescence (IF) on ethanol-fixed {{neutrophils}} is used {{to detect}} ANCA, although formalin-fixed neutrophils {{may be used to}} help differentiate ANCA patterns. ANCA can be divided into four patterns when visualised by IF; cytoplasmic ANCA (c-ANCA), C-ANCA (atypical), perinuclear ANCA (p-ANCA) and atypical ANCA (a-ANCA), also known as x-ANCA. c-ANCA shows cytoplasmic <b>granular</b> <b>fluorescence</b> with central interlobular accentuation. c-ANCA (atypical) shows cytoplasmic staining that is usually uniform and has no interlobular accentuation. p-ANCA has three subtypes, classical p-ANCA, p-ANCA without nuclear extension and granulocyte specific-antinuclear antibody (GS-ANA). Classical p-ANCA shows perinuclear staining with nuclear extension, p-ANCA without nuclear extension has perinuclear staining without nuclear extension and GS-ANA shows nuclear staining on granulocytes only. a-ANCA often shows combinations of both cytoplasmic and perinuclear staining.|$|R
40|$|Summary: In {{response}} to increased shear stress, vascular endothelial cells release adenosine triphosphate (ATP) {{by an unknown}} mechanism. We have investigated this mechanism using different approaches. First, we discovered that quinacrine, used to locate intracellular stores of ATP bound to peptides, displayed a <b>granular</b> <b>fluorescence,</b> typical of vesicular storage. Second, we found that two inhibitors of vesicular transport (monensin and N-ethylmaleimide) produced a highly significant reduction in the release of ATP from vascular endothelial cells in {{response to}} increased shear stress. Preliminary experiments using inhibitors of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator, the sulfonylurea receptor, and the multidrug resistance protein showed no involvement of these ATP-binding cassette transporter proteins (previously characterized in endothelial cells) in the mechanism of release of ATP. We suggest, therefore, that the release of ATP from vascular endothelial cells, like that of nerve cells, is probably by vesicular exocytosis.

40|$|Fluoresceinated human {{native and}} desialylated {{thyroglobulin}} were incubated with peripheral blood lymphocytes. 1 % of the lymphocytes, in twenty samples from normal human blood donors, showed a bright <b>granular</b> <b>fluorescence</b> where neither the number nor pattern of fluorescence differed from lymphocytes {{from the blood}} of thyroiditis patients. Fluoresceinated albumin and gamma-globulin did not bind to the lymphocytes, and a 500 -fold excess of native non-fluoresceinated thyroglobulin inhibited the binding and pre-incubation with anti-IgM serum abolished it. Binding with desialylated thyroglobulin was negligible, and the pattern of fluorescence was pale and uniform. Analysis by sucrose gradient centrifugation and double diffusion in agar gel showed that fluorescein dissociates thyroglobulin into 12 S fragments and reduces its immunoreaction with autoantibodies. It can therefore be concluded that the 12 S molecule produced by fluoresceination maintains its determinants for lymphocyte receptors, whereas further dissociation, as in desialylated fluoresceinated thyroglobulin, leads to a marked reduction in the binding with lymphocytes...|$|R

Viral antigen, as evidence by <b>granular</b> <b>fluorescence,</b> was {{detected in the}} lungs, liver, spleen, pancreas, salivary glands, and small intestine. Infectious virus {{was found in the}} lungs from 14 to 270 days postinoculation, and feces and urine collected 35 to 130 days postinoculation were regularly and sporadically infectious, respectively. Horizontal transmission coincided with virus shedding in oropharyngeal secretions. Suckling voles also developed asymptomatic persistent infections after intracerebral inoculation, and histopathological changes were absent despite widespread infection. Our data resemble findings in Apodemus agrarius experimentally infected with Hantaan virus, the prototype virus of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, suggesting that the mechanisms of maintenance and transmission of Puumala and Hantaan viruses are similar in their respective wild-rodent hosts...|$|R

Specimens from various inflammatory dermatoses processed similarly served as controls. <b>Granular</b> <b>fluorescence</b> was noted in the dermis in 9 of the 12 specimens corresponding to areas of heavy plasma cell infiltration and some fluorescence was found directly on plasma cells which were identified by subsequent hematoxylin arid eosin staining.

This degree of tolerance is not extreme but it is of some interest in view of the histological findings and is perhaps related to the tolerance for uranium observed in dogs by MacNider (2). Given repeated intravenous superthreshold doses of hemoglobin in the dog we observe the deposit of <b>yellow</b> <b>granular</b> pigment within the epithelium of the convoluted tubules [...] see Paper IV. This pigment gives an iron stain and is obviously related to the injected hemoglobin. Beyond a certain point this epithelium cannot take up any more of this pigment material.

40|$|Extracellular {{nucleotides}} such as ATP and UTP {{are released}} {{in response to}} mechanical stimulation in different cell systems. It is becoming increasingly evident that ATP release {{plays a role in}} autocrine and paracrine stimulation of osteoblasts. Mechanical stimulation, as shear stress, membrane stretch or hypo-osmotic swelling, as well as oscillatory fluid flow, stimulates ATP release from different osteoblastic cell lines. Human osteoblast-like initial transfectant (HOBIT) cells release ATP in response to mechanical stimulation. In the present study, we show that HOBIT cells are activated by nanomolar levels of extracellular ATP, concentrations that can be detected under resting conditions and increase following hypotonic shock. Cell activation by hypotonic medium induced intracellular Ca 2 + oscillations, and Egr- 1 synthesis and DNA-binding activity. Quinacrine staining of living, resting cells revealed a <b>granular</b> <b>fluorescence,</b> typical of ATP-storing vesicles. Monensin prevented quinacrine staining and considerably inhibited hypotonic- induced ATP release. Finally, elevated levels of cytosolic Ca 2 + activated massive ATP release and a dose-dependent loss of quinacrine granules. The contribution of a vesicular mechanism for ATP release is proposed to sustain paracrine osteoblast activation...|$|R

Cells in the VTA were predominantly single labeled with the three tracers and cells in the medial SN were predominantly double labeled with the tracers. These results suggest that mesotelencephalic neurons in the SN-VTA can be subdivided into two subpopulations on the basis of relative degree of collateralization. The SN axons appear to be highly collateralized to anatomically and functionally distinct telencephalic areas and the VTA axons appear to have a more singular one-to-one type of projection to the same forebrain regions. The mesotelencephalic dopamine neuron system includes the projections of the dopamine cells of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra (SN) to the forebrain.

30|$|The {{diagnosis}} of granulomatosis with polyangiitis or Wegener's is dependent not only solely on biopsy {{but also on}} the appropriate clinical presentation in conjunction with laboratory tests and imaging studies, namely chest radiography to rule out infiltrates or nodules. With regard to laboratory investigation, serum ANCA testing for granulomatosis with polyangiitis had become an essential component of the workup since the 1980 s [21]. When neutrophils are fixed in alcohol, two different immunofluorescent patterns emerge - a diffuse <b>granular</b> <b>fluorescence</b> of the cytoplasm (i.e., C-ANCA) or a predominantly perinuclear pattern of staining (i.e., P-ANCA). The C-ANCA pattern of staining is most often directed against proteinase- 3, and the P-ANCA pattern against myeloperoxidase. The sensitivity of C-ANCA has been reported to be as high as 85 % to 96 % in patients with complete Wegener's, but drops to 80 % when including patients with limited disease. The P-ANCA pattern is considered an insensitive marker of Wegener's because it is only positive in 10 % of patients with the disease [15]. Our patient demonstrated an elevated P-ANCA titer with a negative C-ANCA test and is therefore considered a relatively atypical case of granulomatosis with polyangiitis.|$|R
40|$|Isolated mucosal {{cells from}} the human jejunum and stomach, {{cryostat}} sections from the jejunum, isolated parenchymal liver cells and lymphocytes were investigated {{for the presence of}} apolipoprotien A (apoA). Antisera against purified human apoA-I and apoA-II were raised in rabbits and conjugated with fluorescein-isothiocyanate (FITC). Mucosal cells from jejunum and stomach were isolated with pronase from tissue obtained from operated patients. ApoA-I and apoA-II could be demonstrated in isolated mucosal cells as well as in cryostat sections from the jejunum. The fluorescence pattern in isolated jejunal cells was coarse granular. In the radial gel diffusion test the homogenate from mucosal cells of jejunum showed a single precipitation line with anti-apoA-I and with anti-apoA-II, respectively. The reaction was more intensive with anti-apoA-I than with anti-apoA-II. Isolated gastric cells were negative for apoA. Hepatocytes incubated with FITC anti-apoA-I showed a fine <b>granular</b> <b>fluorescence</b> pattern in the cytoplasm. Anti-apoA-II did not react with hepatocytes. There was no evidence for an in vivo fixation of serum-apoA at the surface of isolated mucosal cells from jejunum or isolated hepatocytes. The results support the hypotheses that in man apoA is synthesised in the epithelial cells of the small intestine and in parenchymal liver cells...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} two plant growth {{regulators}} on {{the initiation of}} callus and regeneration of L. martagon was studied on modified MS medium. The cultures were initiated using seeds. The explants were isolated {{from different parts of}} seedlings (hypocotyls, seedling bulb, root) and adventitious bulblets. The growth regulators stimulated various types of callus. 4 -amino– 3, 5, 6 -trichloropyridine– 2 -carboxylic acid (Picloram) induced a <b>yellow,</b> friable, <b>granular</b> callus, whereas benzyladenine (BA) alone induced a cream-white, compact callus. MS medium containing Picloram plus BA stimulated a <b>yellow,</b> compact, <b>granular</b> callus. The most useful explants for callus initiation were seedling bulbs and adventitious bulblet scales. The most efficient embryogenic callus was obtained on MS medium containing 5 µM Picloram and 5 µM BA. Histological studies showed that the embryogenic callus was formed at the epidermal cells and near vascular bundles of explants. Somatic embryos were solitary, whereas adventitious bulblets were closely connected with vascular tissue. No differences in the amount of DNA between scale tissue and callus were observed.

40|$|Chick embryo lethal orphan virus induced both T and virus capsid antigens during cytolytic {{infection}} of chick kidney cells. The T antigen was produced relatively early, 8 or 9 hr after infection, while virus capsid antigen was first detected after I 5 to I 6 hr. The T antigen {{appeared as a}} fine <b>granular</b> <b>fluorescence</b> and also as small blobs confined to the cell nucleus. T antigen was detected in virus-infected hamster, mouse and human cells, but was present in very few cells compared with chick kidney monolayers, where almost all cells contained antigen. The virus capsid antigen had a more complex morphology, with fluorescing spots and blobs in the nucleus; it was also detected as a diffuse fluorescence in the cyto-plasm later in infection. The production of virus capsid antigen in chick kidney cells was partially inhibited bycytosine arabinoside (ioo/zg. /ml.) or 5 -fluoro-f-deoxyuridine (3 o #g. /ml.). These inhibitors of DNA viruses {{had no effect on}} the production of virus-induced T antigen in chick kidney cells. No antigenic relationship was detected by immunofluorescence or complement-fixation tests between chick embryo lethal orphan virus and T antigens of adeno-virus type I 2.

40|$|The {{cellular}} {{location of}} cellCAM 105 was studied by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy of {{primary rat hepatocytes}} grown in monolayer culture. Staining corresponding to cellCAM 105 was seen both in cell-cell contact areas and on the upper surfaces of the cells. In the cell-cell contact areas the antigen was not accessible to the antibodies unless the cells were either permeabilized with detergent or incubated in a calcium-free medium. Removal of calcium from the medium caused the cells to separate from each other. Within a few minutes wide intercellular clefts were formed, and upon further incubation the cells became stellate-shaped and finally remained in {{contact with each other}} only via thin cellular processes. These processes were cellCAM 105 -positive and at sites where they attached to the bodies of the contracted cells a <b>granular</b> <b>fluorescence</b> pattern appeared. After 24 - 48 h of culture, intercellular channels resembling bile canaliculi were sometimes formed in the hepatocyte monolayers. The membranes of these intercellular channels were stained for cellCAM 105. After culture for several days the hepatocytes lost their polygonal shape and gradually acquired a more fibroblast-like morphology. This morphological change was accompanied by a decrease in cellCAM 105 -specific fluorescence, both in the cell-cell contact areas and on the free cell surfaces...|$|R
40|$|Staphylococcal {{enterotoxin}} B (SEB) induced {{the production}} of human interferon-gamma (hIFN-gamma) in {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMC). Using specific mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to hIFN-gamma, the patterns of cytoplasmic fluorescence in the PBMC from five individuals were studied. Discrete polar bodies in a ring-formation adjacent to the nuclear membrane was the most frequently observed fluorescent pattern throughout the 76 -hr observation period. Additional and different fluorescent patterns such as multifocal and diffused cytoplasmic, as well as <b>granular</b> <b>fluorescence</b> over the whole cytoplasm, may appear during the late induction period (50 - 76 hr). By using an immunogold-silver (IGS) enhancement method to label cell-surface antigens, it was possible to detect the presence of CD 3, CD 4, CD 25 and OKT 11 marker in 55 %, 54 %, 77 %, and 71 % of the IFN-gamma producer cells, respectively. Monensin and carboxylcyanide m-chlorophenyl-hydrozone (CCCP) are ionophores known to interrupt subcellular transport of a number of secretory proteins. When monensin or CCCP was added to the induced cultures 2 - 3 hr before harvests, an increase in the intensity of cytoplasmic fluorescence in IFN-gamma-producing cells was observed; a greater than 10 -fold enhancement in the sensitivity of immunostaining was demonstrated in these preparations...|$|R
40|$|Renal biopsies were {{performed}} on seven patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and proteinuria. The material was examined by light and immunofluorescent microscopy. Two of the biopsy specimens were examined by electron microscopy. Membranous nephropathy was found in six of the seven specimens. Brilliant, fine <b>granular</b> <b>fluorescence</b> with IgG was present along the glomerular capillary loops under immunofluorescent microscopy. These findings suggested that these renal disorders were due to an immune complex mechanism. The proteinuria of five patients indicated that the membranous nephropathy occurred following D-penicillamine treatment or chrysotherapy. In one patient, {{there was no evidence}} of a relationship between D-penicillamine and proteinuria from her history. The remaining patient had a mild cell proliferative glomerulonephritis under light microscopy. Fluorescence was not found under immunofluorescent microscopy. For this reason, it seemed that the renal disorder was not caused by D-penicillamine, althoug her history showed that D-penicillamine brought on proteinuria. These findings suggested that renal biopsy is desirable in patients with long term proteinuria, when the proteinuria is clearly caused by D-penicillamine or gold salts. Furthermore, it seemed that long term proteinuria due to D-penicillamine, was probably caused by an immunological mechanism. The seven patients showed no evidence of secondary amyloidosis due to RA...|$|R
40|$|Fibroblastic {{cell lines}} {{derived from a}} galactosialidosis patient, stably expressing the chimaeric green {{fluorescent}} protein variant (EGFP) gene fused to the wild-type and mutant human lysosomal protective protein/cathepsin A (PPCA) cDNA, were first established as a model system for revealing the sorting and processing of lysosomal enzymes and for investigating the molecular bases of their deficiencies. In the cell line expressing the wild-type PPCA-EGFP chimaera gene (EGFP-PPwild), an 81 kDa form (27 kDa EGFP fused to the C-terminus of the 54 kDa PPCA precursor) was produced, then processed into the mature 32 / 20 kDa two-chain form free of the EGFP domain. The intracellular cathepsin A, alpha-N-acetylneuraminidase and beta-galactosidase activities, which are deficient in the parent fibroblastic cells, could also be significantly restored in the cells. In contrast with the uniform and strong fluorescence throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus in the mock-cell line expressing only EGFP cDNA, weak reticular and punctate fluorescence was distributed throughout the EGFP-PPwild cell line. Bafilomycin A 1, a potent inhibitor of vacuolar ATPase and intracellular acidification, induced the distribution of Golgi-like perinuclear fluorescence throughout the living and fixed cells, in which only the 81 kDa product was detected. After removal of the agent, time-dependent transport of the chimaeric protein from the Golgi apparatus to the prelysosomal structure in living cells was monitored with a confocal laser scanning microscope system. Leupeptin caused the distribution of lysosome-like <b>granular</b> <b>fluorescence</b> throughout the cytoplasm in the fixed cells, although it was hardly observed in living cells. The latter agent also dose-dependently induced {{an increase in the}} intracellular amount of the 81 kDa product containing the EGFP domain and inhibited the restoration of cathepsin A activity in the EGFP-PPwild cells after the removal of bafilomycin A 1. In parallel, both the mature two-chain form and PPCA function disappeared. These results suggested that the chimaera gene product was transported to acidic compartments (endosomes/lysosomes), where proteolytic processing of the PPCA precursor/zymogen, quenching of the fluorescence, and random degradation of the EGFP portion occurred. A cell line stably expressing a chimaeric gene with a mutant PPCA cDNA containing an A 1184 [...] >G (Y 395 C) mutation, commonly detected in Japanese severe early-infantile type of galactosialidosis patients, showed an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) -like reticular fluorescence pattern. The PPCA-immunoreactive gene product was hardly detected in this cell line. The mutant chimaeric product was suggested to be degraded rapidly in the ER before transport to post-ER compartments. A cell line expressing the chimaeric gene with a T 746 [...] >A (Y 249 N) PPCA mutation exhibited both ER-like reticular and <b>granular</b> <b>fluorescence</b> on the reticular structure that was stronger than that in the EGFP-PPwild cells. Some of them contained large fluorescent inclusion-body-like structures. The ineffectiveness of transport inhibitors in the distribution changes in the two mutant chimaeric proteins suggested that they were not delivered to acidic compartments. Therefore this expression system can possibly be applied to the direct analysis of the sorting defects of mutant gene products in living cells and will be useful for the molecular investigation of lysosomal diseases, including galactosialidosis...|$|R

Twenty-four hr after plating primary cultures, pemphigoid antigen was detected as an asymmetric fluorescence on the cell membranes of rounded cells or a faint fluorescence of the cytoplasm of cells which had spread on the substrate. At later times in primary cultures and in subcultures pemphigoid antigen showed a pattern of coarsely <b>granular</b> <b>fluorescence</b> within or under the cytoplasm of many of the small cells at both the base and expanding periphery of epidermal cell colonies. Pemphigus antigen was detected mainly on the cell membranes of the larger flat cells located more superficially in the colonies. Keratin filaments were detected in cells {{at all levels of the}} epidermal colonies. Rounded cells, which had not yet spread on the substrate, displayed bright perinuclear fluorescence with keratin antibody. In cells spread on the substrate, keratin filaments often appeared to line up end-to-end with filaments of neighboring cells. No qualitative changes in fluorescence of any of these antigens could be detected through 6 subcultures. Human fibroblasts in culture did not display any of these three antigens by immunofluorescence. The finding that cultured human epidermal cells displayed these antigens with the same pattern and intensity through 6 passages indicates that pemphigoid antigen, as well as pemphigus antigen and keratin, were newly synthesized in culture...|$|R
40|$|The {{trajectory}} of secretory vesicles to their fusion sites at the plasma membrane {{is expected to}} give insight into the mechanisms that underlie vesicle transport, maturation and the initiation of membrane fusion. Evanescent-wave (EW) microscopy allows the tracking of fluorescently labeled granules and vesicles prior to fusion with nanometer precision in xy- direction. At the same time, the exponential sensitivity of <b>granular</b> <b>fluorescence</b> to experimental parameters can preclude quantitative estimates of the granule's approach to the plasma membrane. Thus, it has remained controversial to which extent axial distance {{can be obtained from}} simple intensity measurements. We used the information contained in a stack of images acquired at 80 - 125 nm penetration depth of the EW field to estimate individual granule diameter and axial distance. A population analysis on 90 granules revealed an average diameter of 305 +/- 47 nm, below the diffraction-limited 3 52 +/- 31 nm obtained from xy measurements at fixed depth penetration. Stimulation of exocytosis by potassium depolarization resulted in the selective loss of the 18 +/- 5 % of granules located closest to the plasma membrane, while a second population of granules located 60 nm deeper within the cytoplasm increased by recruitment of granules previously located at {{greater than or equal to}} 120 nm depth. These measurements extend and corroborate previous observations at fixed penetration depth of functionally distinct granule populations. Parameters influencing the accuracy of the parameter estimation are evaluated in the appendix. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Anti– 52 - and anti– 60 -kDa Ro/SS-A (Ro) autoantibodies are {{produced}} by most patients with subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus and neonatal lupus erythematosus and {{are thought to be}} pathogenic in these two disorders. To learn more about the epidermal antigens targeted by Ro autoantibodies, a panel of anti- 52 and anti– 60 -kDa Ro antibodies was purified from human autoimmune sera and rabbit anti-sera and then used to: (i) determine the expression and location of the Ro antigens in human keratinocytes; (ii) clarify discrepancies in previous localization studies; and (iii) verify the existence of Ro autoantibodies that cross-react with the 52 - and 60 -kDa Ro antigens, as previously reported. By immunoblot analysis these antibodies demonstrate that 52 - and 60 -kDa Ro proteins are expressed in normal human skin and cultured keratinocytes. By indirect immunofluorescence studies with cultured human cells, tile anti– 52 -kDa Ro antibodies produce fine <b>granular</b> cytoplasmic <b>fluorescence</b> and less intense nuclear fluorescence, with apparent nucleolar sparing. The anti– 60 -kDa Ro autoantibodies produce weak cytoplasmic fluorescence and intense coarse <b>granular</b> nuclear <b>fluorescence</b> with apparent nucleolar sparing. We found distinct differences in the intracellular localization of the 52 - and 60 -kDa Ro autoantigens. This difference suggests that the 52 - and 60 -kDa Ro antigens may have independent cellular functions. Finding 60 -kDa Ro antigen predominantly in the nucleus challenges the notion {{that the majority of the}} intracellular 60 -kDa Ro antigen is complexed with the cytoplasmic mRNA. Additionally, our failure to find a cross-reactive epitope on these two proteins indicates that the 52 -kDa Ro antigen is probably a true immunogen and not merely a protein that cross-reacts with anti– 60 -kDa Ro autoantibodies, as others have suggested...|$|R
40|$|The {{expression}} and properties of pemphigoid antigen of SV 40 -transformed human keratinocytes were studied. By indirect immunofluorescence, SV 40 -transformed keratinocytes in passage 80 - 85 expressed the pemphigoid antigen as coarsely <b>granular</b> perinuclear <b>fluorescence.</b> To characterize this antigen, NP 40 extracts of cells labeled with [14 C]amino acids were immunoprecipitated using sera of 8 patients: bullous pemphigoid (6 patients), chronic localized pemphigoid (1 patient), and drug-induced lichen planus pemphigoides (1 patient). These immunoprecipitates {{were subjected to}} sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then fluorographed. All 8 sera precipitated a protein of Mr 240 K, while normal human sera did not precipitate this protein. These results indicate that SV 40 - transformed human keratinocytes synthesize pemphigoid antigen, and that autoantibodies in the sera of pemphigoid patients with different clinical features identify the same antigen of Mr 240 K in these cells...|$|R
40|$|The P, V, and NP {{genes of}} the {{paramyxovirus}} simian virus 5 (SV 5) were cloned such that their expression was {{regulated by the}} tetracycline-controlled transactivator (M. Gossen and H. Bujard, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89 : 5547 - 5551, 1992), and mammalian cell lines that inducibly expressed individually the P, V, or NP protein or coexpressed the P plus NP or V plus NP proteins were isolated. A plasmid that expresses the tetracycline-controlled transactivator linked, via the foot-and-mouth disease virus 2 A cleavage peptide sequence, to the neomycin aminoglycoside phosphotransferase gene was constructed. Cells were cotransfected with this plasmid, and the appropriate responder plasmids and clonies were {{selected on the basis}} of their resistance to Geneticin (via the neomycin aminoglycoside phosphotransferase gene). The properties of these cell lines, in terms of the induction of the P, V, and NP genes, are described in detail. Both the P and V proteins were phosphorylated when expressed alone. In immunoprecipitation studies using a monoclonal antibody that recognizes both the P and V proteins, a nonphosphorylated host cell protein with an estimated molecular weight of 150, 000 was coprecipitated with V but not P. Immunofluorescence data demonstrated that when expressed separately, the P protein had a diffuse cytoplasmic distribution, but the related V protein had both a nuclear and cytoplasmic distribution. The NP protein had a granular cytoplasmic distribution, giving rise to punctate and <b>granular</b> <b>fluorescence.</b> Coexpression of the NP and P proteins resulted in the accumulation of large cytoplasmic inclusion aggregates, similar to those visualized at late times in SV 5 -infected cells. Coexpression of V with NP led to a partial redistribution of the NP protein in that the NP protein had both a diffuse cytoplasmic and nuclear distribution in the presence of V, but no NP-V aggregates or inclusion bodies were visualized. Direct binding studies also revealed that NP bound to both P and V. For SV 5, these studies suggest that V may have a role in keeping NP soluble prior to encapsidation...|$|R
40|$|SYNOPSIS Renal biopsies {{of seven}} {{patients}} with membranous glomerulonephritis were examined by light, electron, and immunofluorescence microscopy. All had characteristic changes of glomerular basement membranes, typically with bright <b>granular</b> membranous <b>fluorescence</b> of IgG and variable deposits of complement. Cellularity was normal or slightly increased {{due largely to}} mesangial cell proliferation. These cells assumed a variety of appearances referred to as resting, hyperactive, and dark. Resting forms occurred in cases with normal cellularity and limited complement deposition. Hyperactive cells showed ultrastructural evidence of increased secretory and digestive activity and were associated with proliferation and more pronounced complement deposition. Dark cells, inter-preted as undergoing shrinkage and degeneration, were found in small numbers in all biopsies. The characteristic glomerular lesion in membranous glomerulonephritis is a diffuse and fairly uniform thickening of the capillary walls without significant cellular proliferation. This results from the deposition of complexes in which immunoglobulins and com-plement can be demonstrated by immunofluorescenc...|$|R
40|$|An {{association}} between viral antigens, cytopathic effect (CPE), and viral titers {{in blood and}} lymphoid tissues suggests a direct CPE of Junin virus on the lymphopoietic organs of guinea pigs infected with 103 50070 lethal doses of the XJ prototype strain. After seven days of infection, alllymphoreticular organs had infectivity titers higher than those for blood. Virus was recovered from bone marrow and lymph nodes at day 5 after infec-tion; peak titers were obtained from bone marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes after day 10. <b>Granular</b> specific <b>fluorescence</b> was detected in the cytoplasm of reticular monocytes after day 7; megakaryocytes showed positive fluorescence, but specific staining of other lymphoid cells was not observed. Necrosis of bone marrow, lymph nodes, and spleen was observed after day 9. CPE consisted of overdevelopment of reticuloendoplasmic cisternae of reticulomonocytes and myeloblasts. Typical Junin virus particles were observed. Reticular cells were gradually destroyed, and simultaneous necrosis of sur-rounding lymphoid cells was observed. Argentine hemorrhagic fever (AHF) is an endemic epidemic disease of the Pampean area of Argen...|$|R
40|$|The protein {{products}} of cellular and viral myc oncogenes are detected in nuclei by immunofluorescence. No myc fluorescence {{is found in}} nucleoli. In mitotic cells the myc antigens are not found associated with metaphase chromosomes, but are diffusely distributed throughout the cytoplasm. Cytoplasmic myc fluorescence is first observed when chromatin begins to condense in early prophase. <b>Granular</b> nuclear myc <b>fluorescence</b> is again discerned in telophase cells, when the nuclear envelope is formed and becomes more prominent upon cytokinesis; concomitantly the diffuse cytoplasmic myc staining is lost. These results suggest that myc proteins not only bind to DNA or chromatin, but are also associated with other structural systems in the nuclei...|$|R
40|$|The {{hepatitis}} A virus cellular receptor 1 (HAVcr- 1) cDNA {{codes for}} a class I integral membrane glycoprotein, termed havcr- 1, of unknown natural function which serves as an African green monkey kidney (AGMK) cell receptor for HAV. The extracellular domain of havcr- 1 has an N-terminal Cys-rich region that displays homology with sequences {{of members of the}} immunoglobulin superfamily, followed by a Thr/Ser/Pro (TSP) -rich region characteristic of mucin-like O-glycosylated proteins. The havcr- 1 glycoprotein contains four putative N-glycosylation sites, two in the Cys-rich region and two in the TSP-rich region. To characterize havcr- 1 and define region(s) involved in HAV receptor function, we expressed the TSP-rich region in Escherichia coli fused to glutathione S-transferase and generated antibodies (Ab) in rabbits (anti-GST 2 Ab). Western blot analysis with anti-GST 2 Ab detected 62 - and 65 -kDa bands in AGMK cells and 59 -, 62 -, and 65 -kDa bands in dog cells transfected with the HAVcr- 1 cDNA (cr 5 cells) but not in dog cells transfected with the vector alone (DR 2 cells). Treatment of AGMK and cr 5 cell extracts with peptide-N-glycosidase F resulted in the collapse of the havcr- 1 -specific bands into a single band of 56 kDa, which indicated that different N-glycosylated forms of havcr- 1 were expressed in these cells. Treatment of AGMK and cr 5 cells with tunicamycin reduced binding of protective monoclonal Ab (MAb) 190 / 4, which suggested that N-glycans are required for binding of MAb 190 / 4 to havcr- 1. To test this hypothesis, havcr- 1 mutants lacking the N-glycosylation motif at the first site (mut 1), second site (mut 2), and both (mut 3) sites were constructed and transfected into dog cells. Binding of MAb 190 / 4 and HAV to mut 1 and mut 3 cells was highly reduced, while binding to mut 2 cells was not affected and binding to dog cells expressing an havcr- 1 construct containing a deletion of the Cys-rich region (d 1 − cells) was undetectable. HAV-infected cr 5 and mut 2 cells but not mut 1, mut 3, d 1 −, and DR 2 cells developed the characteristic cytoplasmic <b>granular</b> <b>fluorescence</b> of HAV-infected cells. These results indicate that the Cys-rich region of havcr- 1 and its first N-glycosylation site are required for binding of protective MAb 190 / 4 and HAV receptor function...|$|R
40|$|The {{secretory}} immune system, {{which leads}} to secretion of polymeric immunoglobulins along mucosal surfaces, has not {{been shown to have}} any definite role in cutaneous immunology, although the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor, secretory component (SC), has been found in sweat glands and possibly in the epidermis. The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine normal human skin and cultured human keratinocytes for the presence of SC. Positive staining for SC was found in sections of normal human skin along the basement membrane zone with use of a polyclonal antibody to SC and focally on the surfaces of epidermal cells with use of a monoclonal antibody to SC. <b>Granular</b> cell-surface <b>fluorescence</b> of an intensity far less than that of the positive control HT 29 cells was seen when cultured human keratinocytes were stained for SC by indirect immunofluorescence (IF). Study of lysates of both HT 29 cells and HK by immunoblotting have been negative, perhaps due to destruction of the protein or loss of antigenicity during the extraction process. If human keratinocytes are capable of expression of sc, and the receptor can interact with IgA and IgM, this might be a mechanism for protection of the skin from microbial agents or foreign antigens and might be relevant to the deposition of IgA seen in certain skin diseases...|$|R
