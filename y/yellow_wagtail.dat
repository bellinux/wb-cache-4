25|$|Otters have {{recently}} recolonised {{the upper reaches}} of the river, however the water vole is now confined to a few isolated populations. Notable species of invertebrates include uncommon mayflies. There is a diverse breeding bird community including lapwing, snipe and redshank.

500|$|On {{the eastern}} {{outskirts}} of Bath a toll bridge near the George Inn links Bathampton to Batheaston, {{on the north}} bank of the canal. When the A46 Bathampton by-pass was built, the [...] Bathampton Meadow was created to provide additional flood relief. The resultant wet meadows and oxbow lake have proved attractive {{to a number of}} migrants; wading birds such as dunlin, ringed and little ringed plover, and green and common sandpiper are frequent visitors in spring and autumn. Sand martin and kingfisher have been seen regularly by the lake, and other migrants have included <b>yellow</b> <b>wagtail,</b> whinchat and hobby.

50|$|The site {{lies between}} two tidal creeks which {{run into the}} River Crouch. It has {{saltmarsh}} and rough grassland with an unusual transition zone between them. Birds include reed buntings, <b>yellow</b> <b>wagtails</b> and meadow pipits, and there are common lizards and slowworms.|$|R
40|$|Phenotypic and {{genotypic}} {{diversity of}} populations of {{species of the}} <b>yellow</b> <b>wagtails</b> {{in the space of}} their ranges in a wide sympatry reflects the mechanisms of reproductive isolation of species and forms of subspecies rank and features of microevolution group - polytypic complex Motacilla flava Linnaeus, 1758. The distribution of species of the <b>yellow</b> <b>wagtails</b> in the European part of Russia is sympatric. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate whether sympatric settlement led to any genetic separation between the populations of these species. 20 blood samples and 2 samples of eggs collected in areas geographically representing the MID and the southern Russian breeding populations of these species, including all juvenile ringed in 2012, were used. After the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 4 types of the <b>yellow</b> <b>wagtails</b> group Motacilla flava L., 1758; M. feldegg Michahelles, 1830; M. lutea (S. G. Gmelin, 1774); M. cilreola Pallas, 1776 (Passeriformes, Motacillidae) were sequenced. After aligning the sequences of the gene cytochrome oxidase I, based on the comparison of genetic distances between these species phylogenetic tree of genus Motacilla was constructed. These results suggest that, despite the broad sympatry in nesting places, there is a selective mating between males and females of each species studied in spite of the free crossing and insulating mechanisms in populations...|$|R

40|$|Blood parasites of {{migrating}} <b>yellow</b> <b>wagtails</b> of two subspecies-Motacilla flava feldegg and Motacilla flava flava-were studied on {{a sample}} of 473 birds caught in spring and autumn periods in Bulgaria. We controlled eight "migration waves" (flocks captured in different evenings) of <b>yellow</b> <b>wagtails</b> for four parameters-average body mass, average fat level, average wing length, and average prevalence of different hematozoan species. Gametocytes or meronts {{of a total of}} six species of hematozoa belonging to three genera were identified-Haemoproteus motacillae, Haemoproteus anthi, Plasmodium relictum, Plasmodium subpraecox, Plasmodium cathemerium, and Tryponosoma avium. Mixed infections were detected in 31 cases, of which 14 were of H. anthi/H. motacillae type. Parasite species composition was similar in the two studied subspecies of M. flava. We did not find any significant differences in the overall infection prevalence or number of infecting parasites between M. f. flava and M. f. feldegg. Parasite prevalence and the number of co-infecting parasites in spring were much higher than in fall. Season had a strong influence on the prevalence of H. anthi and H. motacillae, and for both, there was a marginally significant interaction between subspecies and season, but not a season-independent influence of subspecies. Males of M. f. feldegg had a significantly higher overall blood parasite prevalence and prevalence of H. anthi than females. Sex-related differences in the prevalence of other parasites were not significant. Migration waves of <b>yellow</b> <b>wagtails</b> differed in overall infection status and in H. motacillae prevalence, but not for H. anthi prevalence. We also found significant differences in fat score, weight, and wing length between the studied migration waves of the <b>yellow</b> <b>wagtails.</b> Fat scores of birds infected with different hematozoa were lower compared with those of the non-infected birds. This only marginally was true for body weight and was not the case for wing length. Overall, infected birds were in worse condition (estimated as the residual weight after regression with wing length) compared with the non-infected birds, but after controlling for seasonal effects, the differences in condition appeared to be due to migration season and did not significantly differ between infected and non-infected birds caught in the same season...|$|R

40|$|A {{comparative}} {{study on the}} abundance of breeding birds and wintering birds was carried out over the period 2005 - 2007 in conventionally and organically managed arable fields in Northern Germany. Birds were surveyed on 40 (breeding season) and 35 (non-breeding season) pairs of fields (conventional/organic), which were selected with regard to similar field sizes, comparable boundary structures (hedges, shrubs) and representative crop rotations. Averaged over three years of investigation, skylarks (Alauda arvensis) and, less distinct, pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) occurred more often on organic fields. In contrast, <b>yellow</b> <b>wagtails</b> (Motacilla flava) showed higher abundances on conventional fields in one year. The diversity of farmland bird species was not affected by farming system (conventional/organic) neither during the breeding season nor during the non-breeding period.

40|$|Blood {{parasite}} infections {{have been}} shown to influence behavioural traits of their avian hosts, in particular activity level and boldness. Following the hypothesis that a mixed infection by different parasite species should have higher effects than single-species infections, we analysed activity and boldness in wild-caught <b>Yellow</b> <b>Wagtails</b> (Motacilla flava L., 1758), a trans-Saharan migrant, during the energetically demanding spring migration. Eighty-five percent of the birds were naturally infected with Haemoproteus Kruse, 1890 or Plasmodium Marchiafava and Celli, 1885 (Sporozoa, Haemosporida) and 27 % of individuals had parasites from both genera. No differences in activity were found among uninfected, single infection, and mixed infection groups. Birds with infections from both genera appeared to be more fearful when first introduced to a cage. These birds also tended to be less likely to approach a novel object compared with uninfected birds and birds infected by a single genus only...|$|R
