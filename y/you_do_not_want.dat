500|$|Fans ask me all {{the time}} {{what it is like to}} be a rock star. I can tell that they are dreaming, as I dreamed, when I was a kid, of someday ruling the world with a rock band. I tell them the same thing I would tell any young rock-star-to-be [...] you will get lonely. You will meet two hundred people every night, but each {{conversation}} will generally last approximately thirty seconds, and consist of you trying to convince them that no, <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> their underwear. Then you will be alone again, in your motel room. Or you will be on your bus, in your little space, trying to kill the nine hours it takes to get to the next city, whichever city it is. This is the life of a rock star.|$|E
500|$|Before meeting Beyoncé, Rich Harrison had {{conceptualized}} {{the beat}} of the song. He had sampled the hook's instrumentation from the 1970 song [...] "Are You My Woman? (Tell Me So)," [...] which had originally been written and composed by Eugene Record, frontman of the Chicago-based vocal group The Chi-Lites. When Harrison first played the beat to his friends, they could not [...] "dig it," [...] and this made him realize that he had conceived something special, which people would appreciate better after hearing the whole record. Thus Harrison decided not to market the selection, and instead, he waited for the right artist to record it: [...] "I had it in the chamber, I had not really shopped it much, because sometimes <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> {{to come out of the}} bag before it's right. People do not really get it and you will leave them with a foul taste in their mouth." ...|$|E
500|$|Tainton and {{the other}} white opponents of the {{concession}} contended that the document conferred upon the grantees all of the watershed's minerals, lands, wood and water, and was therefore tantamount to a purchase receipt for the whole country. Thompson, backed by the missionaries, insisted that the agreement only involved the extraction of metals and minerals, and that anything else the concessionaires might do was covered by the concession's granting of [...] "full power to do all things that they may deem necessary to win and procure" [...] the mining yield. William Mzisi, a Fengu from the Cape, who {{had been to the}} diamond fields at Kimberley, pointed out that the mining would take thousands of men rather than the handful Lobengula had imagined, and argued that digging into the land amounted to taking possession of it: [...] "You say <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> any land, how can you dig for gold without it, is it not in the land?" [...] Thompson was then questioned as to where exactly it had been agreed that the concessionaires could mine; he affirmed that the document licensed them to prospect and dig anywhere in the country.|$|E

6000|$|... "I daresay. You {{were willing}} {{enough to give}} away what <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want.</b> But there must be more between us than any {{question}} of money. Lord Rufford you have treated me most shamefully." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Flora and Blanche did," [...] said Ethel; [...] "I thought <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> me to go, and I had not time. Besides, a London grand young lady--oh!" [...] and Ethel {{shook her}} head in disgust.|$|R
2500|$|Placement new is {{used when}} <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> {{operator}} new to allocate memory (you have pre-allocated {{it and you}} want to place the object there), but you do want the object to be constructed. Examples of typical situations where this may be required are: ...|$|E
2500|$|Jesus then {{describes}} Peter's {{future to}} him, and says [...] "someone else will dress you and lead you where <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to go" [...] (John 21:18, NIV). The narrator interprets this as referring to Peter's martyrdom (John 21:19). According to a tradition {{found in the}} apocryphal Acts of Peter, Peter was crucified upside-down.|$|E
2500|$|... “Except {{in certain}} special cases, {{embalming}} {{is not required}} by law. [...] Embalming may be necessary, however, if you select certain funeral arrangements, such as a funeral with a viewing. [...] If <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> embalming, you usually {{have the right to}} choose an arrangement that does not require you to pay for it, such as direct cremation or immediate burial.” ...|$|E

"Alwaysh, Mr. Oldenbuck, when <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> {{nobody to}} talk of nothing <b>you</b> wash <b>doing</b> about--And the monksh alwaysh did this when they did hide their church-plates, and their great chalices, and de rings, wid very preshious shtones and jewels." ...|$|R
6000|$|This {{aspect of}} the affair had not {{occurred}} to me. [...] "But {{you asked me to}} put my name to it," [...] I stammered. [...] "You said <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> your own to appear--for private reasons. You made a point of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You <b>do.</b> Or <b>you</b> wouldn't {{be found}} on the {{verandah}} every day. Why are you here, then? There are plenty of rooms in the house. You have your own room to stay in--if <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to see me. But <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> <b>You</b> know you do." ...|$|R
2500|$|Confucius's {{principles}} have commonality with Chinese {{tradition and}} belief. He championed strong family loyalty, ancestor veneration, and respect of elders by {{their children and}} of husbands by their wives, recommending family {{as a basis for}} ideal government. He espoused the well-known principle [...] "Do not do to others what <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> done to yourself", the Golden Rule. He is also a traditional deity in Daoism.|$|E
2500|$|During the outro to [...] "Rubber Ring" [...] by The Smiths, {{a sample}} from an EVP {{recording}} is repeated. The phrase [...] "You are sleeping, <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to believe," [...] is a 'translation' of the 'spirit voices' from a 1970s flexitape. The original recording {{is from the}} 1971 record which accompanied Raudive's book 'Breakthrough', and which was re-issued as a flexi-disc in the 1980s free with The Unexplained magazine.|$|E
2500|$|Dirac's {{quantum electrodynamics}} (QED) made {{predictions}} that were – {{more often than}} not – infinite and therefore unacceptable. A workaround known as renormalisation was developed, but Dirac never accepted this. [...] "I must say that I am very dissatisfied with the situation", he said in 1975, [...] "because this so-called 'good theory' does involve neglecting infinities which appear in its equations, neglecting them in an arbitrary way. This is just not sensible mathematics. Sensible mathematics involves neglecting a quantity when it is small – not neglecting it just because it is infinitely great and <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> it!" [...] His refusal to accept renormalisation resulted in his work on the subject moving increasingly out of the mainstream.|$|E
6000|$|CAPTAIN SHOTOVER. You {{left because}} <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> us. Was there no heartbreak in that for your father? You tore {{yourself}} {{up by the}} roots; and the ground healed up and brought forth fresh plants and forgot you. What right had {{you to come back}} and probe old wounds? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not in the least," [...] said Lady Lufton. [...] "I {{have not}} an idea. But I <b>did</b> <b>not</b> flatter myself {{that you would}} come so far on a morning call, merely to see us three ladies. I hope <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to see Ludovic, because {{he will not be}} back till to-morrow?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I knew nobody else. I {{could not}} {{tell him not to}} speak to me. I danced with him twice.' Her mother was seated, with both her hands up to her forehead, and shook her head. 'If <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> me to speak to Paul you should not have taken me there.' ...|$|R
2500|$|... "So the {{question}} is: 'How to win?' That's when I {{began to develop}} what you now see full-fledged in the 'wedge' strategy: 'Stick with the most important thing' —the mechanism and the building up of information. Get the Bible and the Book of Genesis out of the debate because <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to raise the so-called Bible-science dichotomy. Phrase the argument {{in such a way}} that you can get it heard in the secular academy and in a way that tends to unify the religious dissenters. That means concentrating on, 'Do you need a Creator to do the creating, or can nature do it on its own?' and refusing to get sidetracked onto other issues, which people are always trying to do." ...|$|E
2500|$|The storyline {{received}} positive {{attention from}} critics. Dianne Butler, {{writing for the}} Herald Sun, quipped [...] "the bride and groom give {{a bit of a}} shudder when Paul Robinson arrives at their door {{on the morning of the}} wedding, but I think that's most people's reaction any time Paul shows up. But it's a lovely day – yellow roses, Karl doesn't sing – apart from the robbery, and the screaming and the ambulances. Neighbours eh? Brilliant. Nobody's done a wedding like this in years." [...] Kate Lucey from Sugar called [...] "Neighbours: The Explosion" [...] one of the serial's [...] "biggest storylines of the year" [...] and included it in her feature on upcoming dramatic soap storylines. Lucey said [...] "With an upcoming fire in the Rovers Return for Coronation Street, an explosion in Neighbours and the newly announced plans for a pregnancy in EastEnders, we're not really sure where to look first." [...] Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy stated that the explosion was [...] "one of 2013's biggest storylines." [...] Of the explosion, a columnist from New! commented [...] "This is one episode <b>you</b> <b>DO</b> <b>NOT</b> <b>want</b> to miss!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Subsequently, in {{a message}} to his {{subjects}} the King conveyed, [...] "Do not worry about me, he will release me soon, without any need for payment- Tong Seal {{does not seem to}} be wealthy either." [...] When Pu Tong Seal found out about La King's attitude, he secretly collected all the wealth under his province such as silver, beads, bells, (zaam) a traditional musical instrument made of copper, other house utensils, and stored them in a large house to impress La King. One evening, Pu Tong Seal revealed his treasury to La King, and said, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to meet my demand it is fine with me, I do not need your wealth, because I am already a very wealthy man- but in that case, you will never be released to see your kingdom and your family." [...] His determination to keep the Burman king alive but never to release him was very obvious in his stern voice. This sent a chill down La King's spine. La King then immediately sent another message to his Kingdom; this time, the King ordered them to fetch him at once with all the demanded ransom. The King also added in the message, [...] "Tong Seal isn't poor at all, as I first thought, he is actually a very wealthy man".|$|E

6000|$|... "No, no!" [...] one of {{the others}} exclaimed. [...] "They would only drag you out, and when they saw that there was naught the matter with you, would suspect that there must be some reason why <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to go, when, as every one knows, the {{position}} of the servitors is in every way preferable to ours." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No. But I {{would come}} with you if it could give you any pleasure; though, as things stand, perhaps you have too much of me already. Still, I somehow wish that <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to go.

6000|$|... 'Yes, {{she had a}} veil on {{and kept}} it down all the time.
