This science fiction scenario could become a reality at the trend in the development of biologically inspired technologies, and terms like artificial intelligence, artificial muscles, artificial vision and numerous others are increasingly becoming common engineering tools. For many years, the trend has been to automate processes in order to increase the efficiency of performing redundant tasks where various systems have been developed to deal with specific production line requirements. Realizing that some parts are too complex or delicate to handle in small quantities with a simple automatic system, robotic mechanisms were developed. Aircraft inspection has benefited from this evolving technology where manipulators and crawlers are developed for rapid and reliable inspection. Advancement in robotics towards making them autonomous and possibly look like human, can potentially address the need to inspect structures that are beyond the capability of today’s technology with configuration that are not predetermined. The operation of these robots may take place at harsh or hazardous environments that are too dangerous for human presence. Making such robots is becoming increasingly feasible and in this paper {{the state of the art}} will be reviewed...|$|R

What is Stress? Stress has become a catch-all term to describe events or circumstances that make us feel tense or angry. Stress often is caused by events over which we have no control (destruction of home by tornado or sudden death of a family member) or by a positive event (birth of child). However, most stress comes from the daily pile-up of small aggravations and frustrations. It is not 2 ̆ 2 things 2 ̆ 2 or events themselves, however, that cause stress. It is how <b>you</b> interpret and <b>react</b> <b>to</b> them. If the source of stress is within your control, you can take action to change the situation. If it 2 ̆ 7 s beyond your control, you can learn to accept it or find ways to minimize its physical and emotional impact. Experts agree that high levels of stress over long periods tend to be paralyzing and reduce your ability to cope. It can lead to serious illness or depression...|$|R

5000|$|Songwriter David John Matthews, {{working in}} Charlottesville, Virginia, as a {{bartender}} at Miller's bar in November 1990, became {{a friend of}} a lawyer named Ross Hoffman. Hoffman convinced the usually reserved Matthews to record a demo of the few songs he had written. Hoffman hoped Matthews could shop the songs in order to find other musicians to perform on some studio work with him. Hoffman encouraged Matthews to approach Carter Beauford, a local drummer on the Charlottesville music scene. Beauford had been in several bands and was then playing on a jazz show on BET. After hearing Matthews' demo, Carter agreed to spend some time playing the drums, {{both inside and outside the}} studio. Matthews also approached LeRoi Moore, another local jazz musician who often performed with the John D'earth Quintet, to join them. Moore skeptically listened to the demo, but liked what he heard and decided that he too would give Matthews a chance. The trio began working on Matthews' songs in 1991. Matthews recollects that, [...] "...the reason I went to Carter was not because I needed a drummer, but because I thought he was the baddest thing I'd ever seen and LeRoi, it wasn't because I desperately wanted a saxophone, it was because this guy just blew my mind. At this jazz place I used to bartend at Miller's, I would just sit back and watch him. I would be serving the musicians fat whiskeys and they'd be getting more and more hosed, but no matter how much, he used to still blow my mind. And it was the sense that everyone played from their heart. And when we got together and they asked, 'What do you want the music to sound like?'

[...] Hollywood.com remarked [...] "Clarkson puts a man (whose face we never see) in his place for thinking that he knows everything about her. While she's a few unicorns and eccentric costumes shy of creating a Katy Perry or Lady Gaga experience, she brings enough sass and glamour to the video to make it worth watching.
