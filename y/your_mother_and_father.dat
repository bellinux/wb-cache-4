2500|$|... "I {{was in the}} {{greatest}} affliction {{at the loss of}} my son, and was consumed by a desire to know what was his position in the other world. God deigned to comfort me. About a month after his death, during a very restless night, I saw, as it were, the ceiling opened, and Dominic appeared in the midst of dazzling light. I was beside myself at this sight, and cried out: [...] "O Dominic, my son, are you already in Paradise?" [...] "Yes," [...] he replied, [...] "I am in Heaven." [...] Then pray for your brothers and sisters, and <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>father,</b> that we may all come to join you one day in Heaven." [...] "Yes, yes, I will pray," [...] was the answer. [...] "Then he disappeared, and the room became as before." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Or coursed, or hunted, or {{caught in}} a trap, or shot all over your back, or twisted up in nets and choked in snares? Or have you swum out to sea to die more easily, or seen <b>your</b> mate <b>and</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>father</b> killed?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I believe it," [...] he declared. [...] "You {{have had}} a good training, thanks to <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>father.</b> Well, I have advised her to let you try your luck in the great metropolis." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Roger," [...] {{answered}} Dave. [...] "It wouldn't {{be fair to}} ask you to do that. There is {{too much}} of peril, and you must remember what you promised <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>father.</b> You stay here with Mr. Davis and Mr. Hausermann." [...] And so it was finally settled.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Precisely,' said my uncle. 'When {{the castle}} passed into my hands, {{one of the}} very first things which I did was to cut a new opening at the end of it, for I foresaw that in these {{troublesome}} times it might be of use to me; indeed, had it been in repair it might have made the escape of <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>father</b> a very much easier affair.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Going to ill-use me on principle, as <b>your</b> <b>father</b> ill-used <b>your</b> <b>mother,</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>father's</b> sister ill-used her husband?" [...] she asked. [...] "All {{you be a}} queer lot as {{husbands and}} wives!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Miss Archer just hesitated. [...] "It {{was because}} {{there had been}} some {{disagreement}} between <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> my <b>father,</b> after my mother's death, which took place when I was a child. In consequence of it we never expected to see you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Good!' cried Jeremiah, evidently meaning Bad. 'Very good! only don't {{expect me}} to stand between <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> you, Arthur. I stood between <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>father,</b> fending off this, and fending off that, and getting crushed and pounded betwixt em; and I've done with such work.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And she won't die. She can't. Mr. Renshaw, the parson, was in {{the other}} day. 'Think!' he said to her; 'you will have <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>father,</b> and your sisters, and your son, in the Other Land.' And she said: 'I have done without {{them for a long}} time, and CAN do without them now. It is the living I want, not the dead.' She wants to live even now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I {{want to say}} a {{great deal}} to you, Susy. I want to say that if you still feel as I do, and as I have always felt, and you think you could be happy as I would be if--if--we could be always together, we need not conceal it from <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>father</b> any longer. I am old enough to speak for myself, and I am my own master. Your mother has been very kind to me,--so kind that it doesn't seem quite right to deceive her,--and when I tell her that I love you, and that I want you to be my wife, I believe she will give us her blessing." ...|$|E
6000|$|This {{acquaintance}} had {{got up to}} {{take his}} cup from Vanderbank, whose hand, however, dealt {{with him on the}} question of his sitting down again. Mr. Longdon, resisting, kept erect with a low gasp that his host only was near enough to catch. This suddenly appeared to confirm an impression gathered by Vanderbank in their contact, a strange sense that his visitor was so agitated as to be trembling in every limb. It brought to his own lips a kind of ejaculation--"I SAY!" [...] But even as he spoke Mr. Longdon's face, still white, but with a smile that was not all pain, seemed to supplicate him not to notice; and he was not a man to require more than this to achieve a divination as deep as it was rapid. [...] "Why we've all been scattered for Easter, haven't we?" [...] he asked of Nanda. [...] "Mr. Longdon has been at home, <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>father</b> have been paying visits, I myself have been out of London, Mitchy has been to Paris, and you--oh yes, I know where you've been." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{they are}} {{starving}} at your village, {{why did you}} not bring <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>father?</b> They would have been welcome, for a seal and a bear {{would be enough to}} stuff us all quite full, and leave something to send to the rest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 7 [...] It is not {{to diffuse}} you that you were born of <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> [...] <b>father,</b> it is to {{identify}} you, [...] It is not {{that you should be}} undecided, but that you should be decided, [...] Something long preparing and formless is arrived and form'd in you, [...] You are henceforth secure, whatever comes or goes.|$|R
6000|$|... "They say," [...] he resumed, [...] "that a {{wise man}} trusts no one. I, on the other hand, do not believe this. There are times when one must trust. <b>Your</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>father</b> were both as honest as people could be, {{whatever}} their other faults may have been. I like your face. I believe that you, too, are honest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, yes," [...] he said; [...] "except in {{your case}} {{you told me to}} get a position. The homely word job, like much that I have written, offends you. It is brutal. But I assure you it was no less brutal to me when {{everybody}} I knew recommended it to me as they would recommend right conduct to an immoral creature. But to return. The publication of what I had written, and the public notice I received, wrought a change in the fibre of your love. Martin Eden, with his work all performed, you would not marry. Your love for him was not strong enough to enable you to marry him. But your love is now strong enough, and I cannot avoid the conclusion that its strength arises from the publication and the public notice. In your case I do not mention royalties, though I am certain that they apply to the change wrought in <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>father.</b> Of course, all this is not flattering to me. But worst of all, it makes me question love, sacred love. Is love so gross a thing that it must feed upon publication and public notice? It would seem so. I have sat and thought upon it till my head went around." ...|$|E

6000|$|CANDIDA (smiling a little). Let us sit {{and talk}} comfortably over it like three friends. (To Morell.) Sit down, dear. (Morell takes the chair from the fireside--the children's chair.) Bring me that chair, Eugene. (She {{indicates}} the easy chair. He fetches it silently, even with something like cold strength, and places it next Morell, a little behind him. She sits down. He goes to the sofa and sits there, still silent and inscrutable. When they are all settled she begins, throwing a spell of quietness on them by her calm, sane, tender tone.) You remember {{what you told me}} about yourself, Eugene: how nobody has cared for you since your old nurse died: how those clever, fashionable sisters and successful brothers of yours were <b>your</b> <b>mother's</b> <b>and</b> <b>father's</b> pets: how miserable you were at Eton: how your father is trying to starve you into returning to Oxford: how you have had to live without comfort or welcome or refuge, always lonely, and nearly always disliked and misunderstood, poor boy! ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Not on mine--not on mine," [...] she said, [...] "but on yours--on yours only. Oh, if I but escape this fearful night, never shall I {{forget him}} who saved me!

5000|$|According to Hori, {{a central}} theme of many koans is the 'identity of opposites': Koan after koan explores the theme of nonduality. Hakuin's {{well-known}} koan, [...] "Two hands clap {{and there is a}} sound, what is the sound of one hand?" [...] is clearly about two and one. The koan asks, you know what duality is, now what is nonduality? In [...] "What is your original face before <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>father</b> were born?" [...] the phrase [...] "father and mother" [...] alludes to duality. This is obvious to someone versed in the Chinese tradition, where so much philosophical thought is presented in the imagery of paired opposites. The phrase [...] "your original face" [...] alludes to the original nonduality.|$|E

He drew his sword and killed them both. He was about to take off and never again set foot in that land, but as he was leaving he saw his wife sitting among the other women. She told him: 'There are <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>father</b> resting in your room.' And so Julian knew, and fell into a rage. 'The shrewd enemy lied to me when he said my wife was betraying me', and while kissing their wounds he cried 'Better had I never been born, for I am cursed in soul and body.' And his good wife comforted him and said 'Have faith in Christ Almighty, a stream of life and mercy.' They had no children... Gold and silver they had a lot... And after seeking redemption in Rome, Julian built seven hospitals and twenty-five houses. And the poor started flowing to him, to Jesus' Almighty's love." ...|$|E

I must weep now when I think of it. Well, you are far away in England, and perhaps I shall never see you again. How did you find <b>your</b> dear <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>father?</b> I am so happy that your wound is better, and that you can nearly walk--' ...|$|R

50|$|Bob and Jillian {{arrive to}} hear the contestant's decisions. Jillian thinks it is a cruel scenario, akin to {{choosing}} between <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>father.</b> Sione, Filipe, Ron, Kristin and Aubrey choose Bob, while Helen, Laura, Tara, and Mike (who in the end flipped a coin to decide who to train with) choose Jillian. The players all hit the gym to train with their chosen trainers. Kristin becomes frustrated at Bob's intense focus on Sione and Filipe, and the two have a talk in which she explains that she needs him a lot if she is to reach her goal {{of being the first}} woman to lose 100 pounds on the ranch. Bob dedicates himself to her.|$|R
5000|$|It {{was about}} Twelve-year-old Larkin {{lives with her}} mom and dad on an island year round. The story opens {{at the end of}} summer, as the last summer ferry carries the {{tourists}} away until the next summer. One little island “guest” is left behind at Larkin’s home. An almost year old baby, Sophie, has been left by her mother with a note attached telling the family that “I will come back for her one day.” Sophie becomes the catalyst which brings about healing in Larkin’s family.As the family takes in Sophie, they uncover the pain surrounding the loss of Larkin’s newborn brother, “Baby,” six months prior. Larkin’s parents never talk about him, never named him, and through their silence have isolated each other from themselves and from their daughter. The story unfolds beautifully as Larkin’s family cycles through fear of love, love for Sophie, then once again has to face loss again, when Sophie’s mother returns in the spring to claim her. During the story, Larkin discovers poetry and how words are “wondrous” and powerful, and through this power Larkin and her family find their way back from loss and pain.Baby speaks powerfully to foster care, too. Larkin’s grandmother, with foresight, has the following conversation with Larkin:“This is not meant to be easy,” she said, “It is a very important thing to do, for Sophie and especially for <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>father.</b> But it will not be easy. Do you understand?”I understood. I did. I knew that what she meant was what Papa had said. Sophie was not ours. Someday she would go away. Another thing to miss.“Why is it important?” I asked her…“It is important, Larkin, because we are giving Sophie something to take away with her when she goes.”“What?” asked Lalo friend. “What will she take with her?”“Us,” said Byrd firmly.“And what will we have when she’s gone?” I asked [...]Twelve years later,Sophie comes to visit the island, because Byrd had died. Larkin's younger brother was named William.|$|E

Where, and in what circumstances, the new life takes hold is a lottery that some win and others lose. I have worked for some years in both East Timor and Central Australia. I find the burden of despondency and disease heavier in my own country than in East Timor. Non-Aboriginal Australia is tired of hearing of the {{problems}} of Aboriginal Australia. A culture, they say, of handouts and victimisation — why can’t they just get over it like every other ravaged and decimated people?
