But people [...] "of modest means" [...] must also get a chance, and the candidate recited the quotation attributed to Lincoln: [...] "Remember Abraham Lincoln, <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> he said: 'God must have loved the common people—He made so many of them.'" ...|$|E
500|$|I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One is the {{follow-up}} to Yo La Tengo's highly acclaimed 1995 album Electr-O-Pura, which was ranked at number 9 in The Village Voices 1995 Pazz & Jop critics' poll. Electr-O-Pura marked a new creative {{direction for the}} band. According to singer and guitarist Ira Kaplan, [...] "I think after Electr-O-Pura we've had a direction of trying not to worry too hard about what the next album {{is going to sound}} like [...] we just write a bunch of songs, and then go one baby step at the time and just do what seems right." [...] At the time, Kaplan also explained that the lyrics used to come last: [...] "What will really happen is somebody will start playing and we'll all fall in and play for a long time. We'll finish playing an hour later and kinda say, 'Oh, do <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> you did?' Then we'll write something down—or maybe we won't." ...|$|E
2500|$|Those {{who were}} against the comic protested on {{religious}} grounds. One said, [...] "As a born-again Christian, I {{just wanted to}} notify the writers of “Fetus-X” that the comic strip [...] very offensive. ... I pray that one day you will come to know {{the power of the}} cross." [...] Another warned, [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> happened when they said, 'not even God can sink the Titanic?' There are certain things you just don’t joke about. ... keep your blasphemy to yourself." ...|$|E

2500|$|Baron Axel Carpelan, {{who gave}} Sibelius' {{well-known}} tone poem Finlandia its name, {{wrote to the}} composer shortly after its successful premiere: [...] "You have been sitting at home for quite a while, Mr. Sibelius, {{it is high time}} for you to travel. You will spend the late autumn and the winter in Italy, a country where one learns cantabile, balance and harmony, plasticity and symmetry of lines, a country where everything is beautiful – even the ugly. <b>You</b> <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> Italy meant for Tchaikovsky’s development and for Richard Strauss." [...] Although Baron Carpelan was penniless, he raised sufficient funds for Sibelius to stay in a mountain villa near Rapallo, Italy. Here, Sibelius jotted down the first notes to his second symphony.|$|E
2500|$|The second {{reference}} was excised {{from the}} final version but is of interest {{in that it is}} a rare reference to his father; Beckett’s writing is generally matricentric. The writing breaks down following this sentimental passage where C recalls a fishing trip with his father: “Bring me back to the hot summer evening out in the Bay with my father in the little rowboat, fishing for mackerel with a spinner. To the time when it was all still time. ‘Do <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> they look like?’ ‘Yes, father, all blue and silver.’” When Beckett discussed this with James Knowlson in 1989 he used the exact turn of phrase, “‘fishing for mackerel with a spinner’ … that he had used over thirty years before in his rejected play fragment.” Even accounting for Beckett’s astounding memory this was an exceptionally clear and vivid recollection. In more typical Beckett fashion the image resurfaced in Texts for Nothing: “Yes, I’m here forever, with the spinners and the dead flies, dancing to the tremor of their meshed wings…” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{ought to}} have made her--you {{ought to have}} made her," [...] said Mr. Carteret. Nick was about to plead some reason when he continued: [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> I told you I'd give you if you did?

6000|$|... "Because he who {{is called}} the Helper said as much, and {{whatever}} he may be he is no liar. Do <b>you</b> not <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> Red Eve told you when she awoke from that dream of hers, which was no dream? And do <b>you</b> not <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> Sir Andrew told you as to a certain meeting in the snow--pest upon it!"

6000|$|... 53. Then, secondly, though Christ bears not His cross, the {{mourning}} prophets,--the persecuted apostles--and the martyred disciples do bear theirs.
