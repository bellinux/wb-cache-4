50|$|The {{built-up}} gun {{is constructed}} of liner, tube, jacket, three hoops, two locking rings, tube and liner locking ring, <b>yoke</b> <b>ring</b> and screw box liner. Some components were autofretted. Typical of United States naval weapons {{built in the}} 1940s, the bore was chromium-plated for longer barrel life. It uses a Welin breech block that opens downwards and is hydraulically operated. The screw box liner and breech plug are segmented with stepped screw threads arranged in fifteen sectors of 24 degrees each.|$|E
40|$|Image looking {{along the}} beam {{direction}} through CMS. One can see, {{from the inside}} out: the patch panels and cables for the Preshower and ECAL; {{the front of the}} endcap HCAL; some cathode strip chambers (CSCs) for detecting muons; the sealed solenoid (the first circular silver-coloured ring) currently being cooled to operating temperature and held by the central barrel <b>yoke</b> <b>ring</b> (red and orange); one of the other barrel yoke rings installed with many muon chambers (silver rectangular boxes) ...|$|E
40|$|Stress Analysis of Engine mount of LTA {{is carried}} out using MSC/NASTRAN for given {{geometry}} and 19 load cases. The output of the analysis consists of deflections and stresses in the <b>yoke</b> <b>ring,</b> stub wing and forces in the tie rods. Critical buckling stresses in {{the skin of the}} stub wing are also evaluated. The study indicates that depending on the applicability of the load case, suitable design changes are to be introduced to satisfy both buckling and strength requirements...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{supporting}} structures called the Barrel <b>Yoke</b> <b>rings</b> [1] that give a magnet of 15 m diameter and 2. 5 m width, and their survey by using photogrammetry and the Kodak DCS 460 camera interfaced to the Rollei CDW (Close-range Digital Workstation) software. Also {{the results of a}} real photogrammetric measurement of the first full ring in September 1999 in Deggendorf are show...|$|R
40|$|With {{calibration}} of {{the first}} half of the barrel Hadron Calorimeter (HB+) complete (using a radioactive source), preparations begin for its insertion into the solenoid for the Magnet Test and Cosmic Challenge (MTCC). It was moved out of its alcove at the beginning of March - a non-trivial (but completely successful) operation due to the proximity of one of the barrel <b>yoke</b> <b>rings</b> (YB+ 1). The other half of the barrel Hadron Calorimeter (HB-) and one of the endcaps (HE+) should also be calibrated before the MTCC...|$|R
40|$|Thin film of spinel ferrite has {{wide range}} of {{application}} such as magnetic sensor, reading head for magnetic recording media, switch mode power supplies, deflection <b>yoke</b> <b>rings</b> and spintronics devices. These wide applications are due to its high permeability, large resistivity, relatively high magnetization and low coercivity. In the present study spinel ZnFe 2 O 4 with good adhesion on glass substrate have been prepared using home built spray pyrolysis unit from mixed zinc and iron nitrates of 1 : 2 M aqueous solutions. Photograph of the prepared film shows that as film thickness increases, {{the color of the}} film changes from golden yellow to red-brown and is due to increase in grain size. X-ray line broadening technique was adopted to obtain grain size and microstrain. It was observed that the surface morphology and optical transmittance strongly depends on film thickness. Band gap of the film varies from 2. 08 to 2. 70 eV as film thickness decreases. The effect of film thickness on crystalline nature, surface morphology and optical properties were analyzed and reported...|$|R
500|$|A Lock Haven log boom, {{smaller than}} but {{otherwise}} {{similar to the}} Susquehanna Boom at Williamsport, was constructed in 1849. Large cribs of timbers weighted with tons of stone were arranged in the pool behind the Dunnstown Dam, named for a settlement on the shore opposite Lock Haven. The piers, about [...] from one another, stretched in {{a line from the}} dam to a point [...] upriver. Connected by timbers shackled together with iron <b>yokes</b> and <b>rings,</b> the piers anchored an enclosure into which the river current forced floating logs. Workers called boom rats sorted the captured logs, branded like cattle, for delivery to sawmills and other owners. Lock Haven became the lumber center of Clinton County and the site of many businesses related to forest products.|$|R
40|$|The photo shows one of {{the four}} bending magnets of LEAR. They were of C-type with the opening ('mouth') to the outside of the <b>ring</b> (<b>yoke</b> to the inside). Last {{preparations}} are made before the vacuum chamber is slid through the mouth into the magnet. Stochastic cooling pickups/kickers were installed inside the chamber. One can distinguish a large number of feed-throughs on the chamber (leading to the pickup/kicker gaps). The free space {{in the middle of the}} block was left to offer room for an internal target in the magnet. This possibility was never exploited. Instead it is used here, to accommodate a pumping port for the high vacuum system. Michel Chanel (left) and Pierre Lefevre admire the mechanics at work...|$|R
