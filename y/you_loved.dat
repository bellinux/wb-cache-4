500|$|Criticism of {{the game}} {{included}} complaints about the four-disc format {{of the game}}, which required players to swap out the installer disc {{with one of the}} other discs every time the player entered a new Age. GameSpot's Scott Osborne noted that due to the frame-by-frame nature of gameplay, it was occasionally difficult to discern where players were allowed to venture and what areas were unreachable. The Los Angeles Times reported that bugs including a lack of sound, incompatibility with certain graphics cards and system crashes were present in as many as 10 percent of the first shipment of discs. Reviewers who had not enjoyed Myst or Riven stated that there was nothing new or substantially different in the game to warrant interest; The New York Times observed, [...] "Exile has everything <b>you</b> <b>loved</b> or hated about Myst and Riven." ...|$|E

A music video, directed by Hype Williams, features Simpson dancing in a futuristic spaceship-like setting, with her backup dancers. A third single was planned to be released, but after September 11 terrorist attacks, Sony refused to promote a third single, which Joe Simpson believed critical for Jessica's prospects.

500|$|Some biographers of James {{argue that}} the {{relationships}} were not sexual. James's Basilikon Doron lists sodomy among crimes [...] "ye are bound in conscience never to forgive", and James's wife Anne gave birth to seven live children, as well as suffering two stillbirths and {{at least three other}} miscarriages. Contemporary Huguenot poet Théophile de Viau observed that [...] "it is well known that the king of England / has union with the Duke of Buckingham". Buckingham himself provides evidence that he slept in the same bed as the King, writing to James many years later that he had pondered [...] "whether <b>you</b> <b>loved</b> me now... better than at the time which I shall never forget at Farnham, where the bed's head could not be found between the master and his dog". Buckingham's words may be interpreted as non-sexual, in the context of seventeenth-century court life, and remain ambiguous.|$|E

500|$|My Love: Essential Collection is a {{greatest}} hits album by Canadian recording artist Celine Dion. It {{was released by}} Columbia Records on 24 October 2008 as the follow up to her previous English-language compilation, All the Way... A Decade of Song (1999).

My Love: Essential Collection was released as a single disc, consisting of Dion's most successful singles, including: [...] "My Heart Will Go On", [...] "Because <b>You</b> <b>Loved</b> Me" [...] and [...] "The Power of Love". The two-disc edition, entitled My Love: Ultimate Essential Collection has been further expanded to include rare songs that have not previously appeared on her albums. Both editions include one new track, [...] "There Comes a Time". The album wasn't released in Japan because Sony Music Entertainment decided to issue different compilation there, Complete Best.|$|E
500|$|The console {{version of}} Crash Nitro Kart {{received}} mixed to positive reviews upon release. Manny LaMancha of GamePro {{concluded that the}} gameplay of Crash Nitro Kart was addictive though not innovative. [...] said that Crash Nitro Kart was [...] "satisfying and challenging at the same time" [...] and [...] "a great way to fill that need for speed." [...] Nintendo Power praised the karts as [...] "fast" [...] and the power-ups as [...] "creative". Official PlayStation Magazine concluded that [...] "Vicarious Visions did all it could to emulate the Naughty Dog classic (Crash Team Racing) and just added a PS2 coat of paint." [...] Play magazine said that the game was [...] "a little generic and heavily recycled, but the powerslide system from CTR pulls it together." [...] Matt Helgeson of Game Informer dismissed the game as [...] "probably {{one of the least}} exciting racing titles I've played recently." [...] Demian Linn of Electronic Gaming Monthly noted that the gameplay was [...] "nearly identical to Crash Team Racing's, even down to the speed-boosting wumpa fruits, so if <b>you</b> <b>loved</b> it before, you'll still love it, and if not... not." ...|$|E

500|$|Zac Bertschy of Anime News Network {{declined}} to post {{commentary on the}} preview announcement for the second season, claiming [...] "we assume if <b>you</b> <b>loved</b> School Rumble, you're gonna check out the sequel regardless of what anyone says, so why bother reviewing it?" [...] David F. Smith from IGN gave {{the first part of}} season two a rating of 6/10, with lower scores for the Funimation extras and higher ones for the plot and story. Specifically, Smith praised the anime for never taking itself seriously, and the studio for not cutting its budget for sight gags—something he notes that other companies do. Tim Jones from THEM Anime Reviews found the second season funny and nonrepetitive, and Bamboo Dong of Anime News Network praised the second season for not conforming to the conventions of reality. She complimented it for focusing more on the other students and their relationships than on the main love triangle. Chris Beveridge claimed that, although it comes across well, the season should not be watched in a marathon sitting. He was more critical of Funimation's packaging, preferring the first season's metal locker boxart to the packing for the half-season sets.|$|E
500|$|The affair between Erskine and Mitford {{continued}} intermittently. While {{she often}} despaired of the relationship, she refused other offers of marriage, {{saying that she}} would [...] "never marry anyone except Hamish." [...] In 1932 her plight was overshadowed by a family scandal involving her younger sister Diana, who had married Bryan Guinness in 1928 and {{was the mother of}} two young sons. In 1932 Diana deserted her husband to become the mistress of Sir Oswald Mosley, the leader of the British Union of Fascists, himself married with three children. [...] Almost alone of her family, Mitford offered her sister support, regularly visiting her and keeping her up to date with [...] family news and social gossip. Her own love affair with Erskine came to an abrupt end when, in June 1933, he informed her that he intended to marry the daughter of a London banker. In a final letter after their parting, Mitford wrote to him: [...] "I thought in your soul <b>you</b> <b>loved</b> me & that in the end we should have children & look back on life together when we are old".|$|E

500|$|... "Always Be My Baby" [...] was {{released}} by Columbia Records on March 9, 1996 in Europe, [...] and debuted at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 on the issue dated April 6, 1996, behind Celine Dion's [...] "Because <b>You</b> <b>Loved</b> Me," [...] which had replaced Carey's previous single, [...] "One Sweet Day", at number one. [...] "Always Be My Baby" [...] stayed at number two for four weeks, and topped the Hot 100 on May 4, 1996, where it spent two weeks {{before returning to the}} number two position for an additional five weeks. At the end of its US chart run, the song spent a total of nine weeks at number two, the fourth longest stay in the chart's history. The song became Carey's 11th chart topper in the United States, tying her with pop singers Whitney Houston and Madonna as the female solo artist with the most number one singles, a record she soon passed. After spending two weeks atop the Hot 100, the three singles from Daydream had given Carey a combined 26 weeks (six months) atop the chart, something never duplicated by another artist until Usher and The Black Eyed Peas in the mid to late 2000s. In Canada, the song became Carey's eighth chart topper, after it ascended to the number one position on the Canadian RPM Singles Chart during the week of May 20, 1996.|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} is about a brokenhearted man who moves on from his past. A Rolling Stone {{reviewer}} called the song a [...] "breakup aria". According to Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian, [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] stands out for its [...] "slow-building sense of drama", which highlights Timberlake at his [...] "husky best". The song begins with the phrase [...] "You were my sun, you were my earth", which according to Timbaland was Timberlake's inspiration to write the song. Tanya L. Edwards of MTV News observed that Timberlake was wronged and said this is demonstrated by the lyrics: [...] "You don't have to say whatcha did / I already know, I found out from him / Now there's just no chance." [...] The chorus contains the lines: [...] "Told me <b>you</b> <b>loved</b> me, {{why did you leave}} me all alone / Now you tell me you need me when you call me on the phone." [...] Slant Magazines Sal Cinquemani called Timberlake's 2007 single [...] "What Goes Around... Comes Around" [...] an ostensible sequel to [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] both lyrically and musically. Jason Lipshutz of Billboard stated that aside from the presence of Timbaland's [...] "fantastically cluttered production", the difference between [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] and Timberlake's 2013 single [...] "Mirrors" [...] is clear: [...] "10 years ago, Timberlake was broken, and now he is whole".|$|E
