500|$|In the {{original}} poem, the verse says [...] "Without {{going out of}} my door, I can know the ways of heaven." [...] And so to prevent any misinterpretations – and also to make the song a bit longer – I did repeat that as a second verse but made it: [...] "Without going out of your door / You can know all things on earth / Without looking out of <b>your</b> <b>window</b> / You can know the ways of heaven" [...] – so that it included everybody.|$|E

2500|$|For Hundertwasser, human misery was {{a result}} of the rational, sterile, {{monotonous}} architecture, built following the tradition of the Austrian architect Adolf Loos, author of the modernist manifesto Ornament and crime (1908). He called for a boycott of this type of architecture, and demanded instead creative freedom of building, and the right to create individual structures. In 1972 he published the manifesto <b>Your</b> <b>window</b> right — your tree duty. Planting trees in an urban environment was to become obligatory: [...] "If man walks in nature's midst, then he is nature's guest and must learn to behave as a well-brought-up guest." [...] Hundertwasser propagated a type of architecture in harmony with nature is his ecological commitment. He campaigned for the preservation of the natural habitat and demanded a life in accordance with the laws of nature. He wrote numerous manifestos, lectured and designed posters in favor of nature protection, including against nuclear power, to save the oceans and the whales and to protect the rain forest. He was also an advocate of composting toilets and the principle of constructed wetland. He perceived feces not as nauseous but as part of the cycle of nature. His beliefs are testified by his manifesto The Holy Shit and his DIY guide for building a composting toilet.|$|E
