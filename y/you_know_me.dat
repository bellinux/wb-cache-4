And, you know, it was a major problem. A flat tire's nothing compared to that. And everybody who would pass would laugh and think it was so funny <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>me</b> stumbling along.|$|E

500|$|Two critics from Pitchfork Media {{reviewed}} [...] "I Blame Myself" [...] {{separately from}} Night Time, My Time. Jenn Pelly ranked the track as the twelfth-best song released in 2013. She spoke favorably of its lyrical content, commending the chorus lyrics [...] "How could {{you know what}} it feels like to fight the hounds of hell?" [...] and [...] "You think <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>me</b> so well" [...] for painting Ferreira as an exemplar for [...] "bullied high school weirdos", and appreciating that the lines [...] "I know it's not your fault / That you don't understand / I blame myself" [...] for acknowledging her own wrongdoings with the intention of starting anew. Jillian Mapes complimented the [...] "bluntness" [...] that was delivered throughout the song, and suggested that the track had [...] "anthem potential". She praised the verses for verbalizing self-confidence issues that are often associated with young women, with particular acclaim being placed on the lines [...] "I’m just a face without a choice / Trust you’d never like to guess what I think above the shoulders." [...] She concluded her review by noting that the song should be recognized as a [...] "declaration of force [...] a song about the power of vulnerability" [...] rather than confusing it for an [...] "admission of weakness".|$|E

And what, sir, has wrought this transformation? <b>You</b> <b>knew</b> <b>me</b> of old, {{or thought}} <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>me?</b> Is it {{in six months}} of selfish absence that your mind has changed?

When I was younger, I became a fighter because I had to survive. I had nothing. I {{had no one to}} depend on except myself. I {{realized}} that boxing was something I was good at, and I trained hard so that I could keep myself and my family alive." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cardi B is of Christian faith, {{believing in}} God and Jesus Christ; she has {{mentioned}} her [...] "strong relationship" [...] with God in interviews, often {{saying that she}} [...] "talks to him": [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>me,</b> you know that I have this deep connection to God. Is it crazy {{for me to say}} that I used to ask God to please help me? The strip club really helped me. I can say that it saved me…God put that in my way." ...|$|E

2500|$|As the Montrose {{entered the}} St. Lawrence River, Dew came aboard {{disguised}} as a pilot. Kendall invited Crippen to meet the pilots as they came aboard.

2500|$|Mapp {{was once}} mistaken {{for one of}} George II's mistresses while riding in her {{carriage}} by an angry mob.

[...] In August 1736, she married an abusive footman named Hill Mapp who absconded with 100 guineas of her savings. After initial confusion and anger, Mapp claimed that the money was worth losing to get rid of her husband. In 1737, Mapp died in Seven Dials and was buried by the parish there.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{bittersweet}} {{moment in}} Cobb's life reportedly {{came in the}} late 1940s, when he and sportswriter Grantland Rice were returning from the Masters golf tournament. Stopping at a Greenville, South Carolina, liquor store, Cobb noticed that {{the man behind the}} counter was none other than [...] "Shoeless" [...] Joe Jackson, who had been banned from baseball almost 30 years earlier following the Black Sox scandal. But Jackson did not appear to recognize him, and after making his purchase an incredulous Cobb asked, [...] "Don't <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>me,</b> Joe?"

2500|$|In 1933, the Jacksons {{moved back}} to Greenville, South Carolina. After first opening a {{barbecue}} restaurant, Jackson and his wife opened [...] "Joe Jackson's Liquor Store", which they operated until his death. One of the better known stories of Jackson's post-major league life took place at his liquor store. Ty Cobb and sportswriter Grantland Rice entered the store, with Jackson showing no sign of recognition towards Cobb. After making his purchase, the incredulous Cobb finally asked Jackson, [...] "Don't <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>me,</b> Joe?"

2500|$|As Montrose {{entered the}} St. Lawrence River, Dew came aboard {{disguised}} as a pilot. Canada was then still a dominion within the British Empire. If Crippen, an American citizen, had sailed to the United States instead, {{even if he had}} been recognised, it would have taken extradition proceedings to bring him to trial.

2500|$|I {{definitely}} {{had a story}} for it – a specific story – that's why I {{felt that it was}} important for her and I to co-direct this particular video and song and she completely got it. She got my vision for it. She [...] got where I was trying to go and what she brings to the table is so incredible and she's so creative and outstanding. And I always have a great time working with her. There was no ego involved, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>me</b> - that was the first video that I'd ever {{stepped up to the plate}} to literally co-direct. I'd always been very opinionated and very you know, I always voice my ideas and whatnot in my videos, but this was the first one I actually took credit for in co-directing. And she was just so great and generous in teaching me some of the ropes and learning about the different camera angles and you know, all the facets and details that go into making a video. So, she was really great and we had such fun with that. [...] And she's amazing. I can't you know, she came to the set dressed in different outfits that related to the circus everyday, so she's such an imaginative, creative spirit that I just have such fun working with energy like that.|$|E
