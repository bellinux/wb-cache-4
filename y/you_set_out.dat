500|$|Castle Rock {{offered to}} finance any other film Darabont wanted to develop. Darabont seriously {{considered}} the offer, citing growing up poor in Los Angeles, believing it would elevate his {{standing in the}} industry, and that Castle Rock could have contractually fired him and given the film to Reiner anyway. But, he chose to remain the director, saying in a 2014 Variety interview, [...] "you can continue to defer your dreams in exchange for money and, you know, die without ever having done the thing <b>you</b> <b>set</b> <b>out</b> to do". Reiner served as Darabont's mentor on the project instead. Within two weeks of showing the script to Castle Rock, Darabont had a $25 million budget to make his film (taking a $750,000 screenwriting and directing salary plus {{a percentage of the}} net profits), and pre-production began in January 1993.|$|E
500|$|SpongeBob SquarePants was an {{immediate}} hit. Within its first month on air, it overtook Pokémon (1997) as the highest-rated Saturday morning children's series. By the end of 2001, the show boasted the highest ratings of any children's series on television. Nickelodeon began adding SpongeBob SquarePants to its Monday-through-Thursday prime-time block. This programming change {{increased the number of}} older viewers significantly. By May 2002, the show's total viewership reached more than 61 million, 20 million of which were aged 18 to 49. Hillenburg did not expect the show would be very popular even to adults: [...] "I never imagined that it would get to this point. When <b>you</b> <b>set</b> <b>out</b> to do a show about a sponge, you can't anticipate this kind of craze. We just try to make ourselves laugh, then ask if it's appropriate for children. I can tell you that we hoped it would be liked by adults. But we really thought the best we could hope for was a college audience." [...] SpongeBob SquarePants has gone on {{to become one of the}} longest-running series on Nickelodeon. [...] "Ten years. I never imagined working on the show to this date and this long. It never was possible to conceive that. ...I really figured we might get a season and a cult following, and that might be it," [...] Hillenburg said in 2009 during the show's tenth anniversary. Its popularity has made it a media franchise, which is the most-distributed property of MTV Networks. , it has generated $12 billion in merchandising revenue.|$|E
500|$|Soon {{after the}} death of Ianto Jones during Torchwoods third series, a {{campaign}} to bring him back was started through networking sites such as LiveJournal, Twitter and Facebook. The resulting website, www.saveiantojones.com, has organised a protest which encourages fans to send coffee, along with postcards and letters of complaint, to the BBC, a reference to Ianto's status as the [...] "coffee boy". Via the Save Ianto Jones website, fans are also campaigning {{to raise money for the}} BBC charity Children in Need in honour of the character. The fundraising site states that [...] "Though we, his devoted fans, still hope that he'll come back ... we mourn him. In the series, he died saving the children of Earth; so it seems fitting to honour his memory by helping the Children in Need." [...] Torchwood Magazine reported that the site had raised nearly £4,000, with individual donations ranging from £2 to £50. John Barrowman described the charity campaign as [...] "a fun way to mourn Ianto" [...] and stated that it was [...] "the kind of thing that's really appreciated". Gareth David-Lloyd was flattered by the strong fan reaction, saying it is [...] "satisfying in drama when you create such an emotional response, because that's what <b>you</b> <b>set</b> <b>out</b> to do in the first place". He praised the fan donations, claiming [...] "So far, they've raised about £3,000 for Children in Need, and £1,000 for Lluest Horse and Pony Trust in West Wales, which I'm a patron of, so that's got to be a good thing". Coventry Telegraph records that by 21 July 2009, £4,172 had been donated in Ianto's name.|$|E
5000|$|Your live {{shows have}} a {{reputation}} for being pretty wild affairs. Do <b>you</b> deliberately <b>set</b> <b>out</b> to work up your audience? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Egscuse me, sir," [...] says he, [...] "but it's impawsable. We can't dine twenty at that table--not if <b>you</b> <b>set</b> 'em <b>out</b> awinder, we can't." ...|$|R

2500|$|Whichever {{one of you}} {{is elected}} in November [...] you {{mentioned}} those three electoral votes in Wyoming and how critical they've turned out to be. But what they're a sign of also is that you're going to inherit a very deeply divided electorate, economically, politically, you name it. How will <b>you</b> <b>set</b> <b>out,</b> Mr. Vice President, in a way that you weren't able to in these past four years, to bridge that divide? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{behaved like}} an old frontiersman," [...] Pearson said. [...] "I couldn't have done better myself. You only made one blunder from the time <b>you</b> <b>set</b> <b>out</b> from shore." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then said he, [...] "I {{wish you}} a fair day when <b>you</b> <b>set</b> <b>out</b> for Mount Zion, and shall be {{glad to see that}} you go over the river dry shod." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, youth, {{stay the}} night with me, and to-morrow <b>you</b> can <b>set</b> <b>out</b> again. In return for your company I will give you food and shelter.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Go {{make ready}} for a journey. <b>You</b> must <b>set</b> <b>out</b> within the hour for London. Take what you may require and arm yourself; then return to me here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{went out}} to the carriage, as soon as I could get away from you; but he wasn't in it. I sent Mr. Westover back to <b>you</b> and <b>set</b> <b>out</b> to look for him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And now, my good friends, however {{great the}} {{pleasure}} I derive from your company, I care not how soon <b>you</b> <b>set</b> <b>out,</b> for I have some prodigious {{arrears of work}} upon my hands." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{makes little}} {{difference}} what time <b>you</b> <b>set</b> <b>out,</b> for you'll spend {{the remainder of}} the night, whether you go late or early, in prison," [...] Master Lord growled, and Hiram made answer with a laugh: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed, Monsieur," [...] quoth Monsieur Fournier {{as soon as}} {{he could}} speak coherently, [...] "you have done {{everything}} that <b>you</b> <b>set</b> <b>out</b> to do and done it with perfect chivalry. You conveyed 'the toys' safely over the frontier as far as St. Claude." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is {{one point}} {{on which we}} have not touched," [...] said the latter, who turned to Ormsgill. [...] "How {{did you get the}} first eight boys <b>you</b> say <b>you</b> <b>set</b> free <b>out</b> of the country?" ...|$|R
3000|$|With {{respect to}} your {{reported}} experiences, {{how do you}} define success and failure? What are the characteristics of outcomes that you see as unacceptable in terms of what <b>you</b> originally <b>set</b> <b>out</b> to accomplish vs. what really unfolded? [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "Garin," [...] {{he said to}} the corporal, [...] "in {{a half-hour}} the {{landlord}} will be able to provide you with fresh horses. <b>You</b> will <b>set</b> <b>out</b> at once to follow me along the road to Liege. I am starting immediately." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That will do, Babbalanja; {{you are on}} the verge, take not the leap! Go back whence <b>you</b> <b>set</b> <b>out,</b> {{and tell}} us of that other, and still more mysterious Azzageddi; him whom you hinted to have palmed himself off on you for you yourself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] he said. [...] "Leave Sergeant Flanagan and ten men to {{wait for}} me, O'Rourke, and do <b>you</b> <b>set</b> <b>out</b> at once {{with the rest of}} the troop. And take the cattle with you. I shall {{overtake}} you before you have gone very far." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Would <b>you</b> <b>set</b> <b>out</b> {{with me now}} to do {{whatsoever}} {{we might}} toward releasing Saul, for verily, Pierre Laurens, he may be released if simply held prisoner in that house belonging to the Widow Marshall, because it is as crazy a building as the one we have just left." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And you!' cried Beaufort, {{raising his}} voice and turning his {{flashing}} eyes upon me; 'who are you that dare to bring such a message to Badminton? You had surely taken leave of your senses ere <b>you</b> did <b>set</b> <b>out</b> upon such an errand!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I {{should think}} you would have a strawberry-bed. My father will give you some plants, and <b>you</b> can <b>set</b> them <b>out</b> this fall.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall {{complain}} {{to the civil}} service department," [...] said Goodwin;--"or is it a department?--perhaps it's only a theory. One gets neither civility nor service from you. You won't talk; and <b>you</b> won't <b>set</b> <b>out</b> anything to drink. What kind of a way is that of representing your government?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You say you {{accompanied}} Raoul Yvard, witness, in a {{visit to}} the aunt of the young woman called Ghita Caraccioli," [...] observed Cuffe, in a careless way that was intended to entrap Ithuel into an unwary answer--"where did you go from when <b>you</b> <b>set</b> <b>out</b> on your journey?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Please {{to excuse}} me to-night, Mr. Coverdale," [...] said Moodie. [...] "You are very kind; but I am afraid I have troubled you, when, after all, {{there may be}} no need. Perhaps, with your good leave, I will come to your lodgings to-morrow morning, before <b>you</b> <b>set</b> <b>out</b> for Blithedale. I wish you a good-night, sir, and beg pardon for {{stopping}} you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... '"Hold on," [...] said Jerry. [...] "You've forgot what <b>you</b> <b>set</b> <b>out</b> to do {{up at the}} alehouse just now. You was goin' {{to search}} me for witch-marks; you was goin' to duck me in the pond; you was goin' to drag all my bits o' sticks out o' my little cottage here. What's the matter with you? Wouldn't {{you like to be}} with your old woman tonight, Tom?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed I am," [...] {{replied the}} doctor, firmly, [...] "and I {{advise you to}} begin your {{preparations}} at once, for <b>you</b> must <b>set</b> <b>out</b> on your travels {{in less than a}} month. I lay the responsibility of seeing my orders carried into effect on your shoulders, Miss Gray." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{could see}} it was a close thing as soon as I caught sight of you. We have been {{wondering}} all night what became of <b>you,</b> and <b>set</b> <b>out</b> {{as soon as it was}} light. We fired a shot occasionally, but we listened in vain for your three shots." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{had already}} guessed it," [...] replied the maidens; [...] "for your {{wonderful}} deeds are known {{all over the}} world. We {{do not think it}} strange, any longer, that <b>you</b> should <b>set</b> <b>out</b> in quest of the golden apples of the Hesperides. Come, sisters, let us crown the hero with flowers!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am Marian Thwaite of Barrow Hall, {{and regret}} I cannot stay any longer, having three miles {{to ride in}} the rain," [...] she said. [...] "Still, I may return to-morrow before <b>you</b> <b>set</b> <b>out.</b> Mrs. Forsyth will be pleased if she hears you have made these Canadian strangers comfortable, Musker, and I think you may tell them why Mr. Geoffrey left England. May I ask your names?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm so bewildered, I don't {{know what}} to say. I came here because I thought {{something}} was wrong. I thought you hadn't succeeded in what <b>you</b> <b>set</b> <b>out</b> to do and were ashamed to come back when you'd failed. I never guessed I should be faced with this. I'm so desperately sorry, Edward. I'm so disappointed. I hoped you would do great things. It's almost more than I can bear to think of you wasting your talents and your youth and your chance in this lamentable way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I believe you, my boy, {{and if you}} had {{put into}} the work at books {{anywhere}} near as hard as you have on what you call 'picking up points,' you'd have been pretty well along by this time. Howsomever, we can remedy that, though we can't call back lost time. Jerry Walters and I'll figger up what's to be done, and explain further as soon as we've settled matters, 'cause you see, Amateur, you belong to Ninety-four, an' we ain't of the mind to have you fail in what <b>you</b> <b>set</b> <b>out</b> after." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, it {{is a fine}} {{thing for}} you to have done," [...] said the colonel; [...] "a most creditable affair. I know that you are a pretty good marcher; but I hardly think that, after a long day's work, <b>you</b> can <b>set</b> <b>out</b> for a march of nearly double the length." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am about}} to leave our beloved country for a long period, and desire to leave the sceptre {{in the hands of}} him who is most truly a tortoise.

6000|$|... "Then, if you so will it, Master Topham," [...] said Bridgenorth, [...] "thus {{it shall}} be. <b>You</b> shall <b>set</b> <b>out</b> with early day, taking you, towards London, the persons of Sir Geoffrey and Lady Peveril; {{and that they}} may travel {{according}} to their quality, you will allow them their coach, sufficiently guarded." ...|$|R
