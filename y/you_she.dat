500|$|Many actresses {{who read}} for Phoebe {{arrived at the}} {{audition}} in character, wearing [...] "bell bottoms and clunky shoes and nose rings". [...] Kathy Griffin and Jane Lynch auditioned for the role. Lisa Kudrow won the role because the producers liked her as Ursula, the waitress in Mad About <b>You.</b> <b>She</b> was second to be cast, though there was about a month between her and Schwimmer being signed on. Many of the actors seen by Moonves were [...] "too theatrical" [...] in performing comedy; Crane described the six successful actors as being {{the only ones who}} [...] "nailed" [...] their parts. The six actors {{met for the first time}} altogether at the read-through on April 28, 1994. John Allen Nelson and Clea Lewis guest-star as Paul and Franny, Monica's date and co-worker respectively. Cynthia Mann appears as a Central Perk waitress.|$|E
500|$|Another Side of Bob Dylan, {{recorded}} {{on a single}} evening in June 1964, had a lighter mood. The humorous Dylan reemerged on [...] "I Shall Be Free No.10" [...] and [...] "Motorpsycho Nightmare". [...] "Spanish Harlem Incident" [...] and [...] "To Ramona" [...] are passionate love songs, while [...] "Black Crow Blues" [...] and [...] "I Don't Believe <b>You</b> (<b>She</b> Acts Like We Never Have Met)" [...] suggest {{the rock and roll}} soon to dominate Dylan's music. [...] "It Ain't Me Babe", on the surface a song about spurned love, {{has been described as a}} rejection of the role of political spokesman thrust upon him. His newest direction was signaled by two lengthy songs: the impressionistic [...] "Chimes of Freedom", which sets social commentary against a metaphorical landscape in a style characterized by Allen Ginsberg as [...] "chains of flashing images," [...] and [...] "My Back Pages", which attacks the simplistic and arch seriousness of his own earlier topical songs and seems to predict the backlash he was about to encounter from his former champions as he took a new direction.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} is over nine minutes long and begins where [...] "Paparazzi" [...] left off after Gaga {{was arrested for}} killing her boyfriend by {{poisoning}} his drink. Gaga is later taken to a women's prison, where she is led to her cell by two prison guards, who strip her of shoulder-padded dress and left lying naked, while she is mocked by the other women prison inmates. One of the guards comments: [...] "I told <b>you</b> <b>she</b> didn't have a dick", referring to the rumors that Gaga is intersex. For the video's first three minutes, it shows Gaga's activities in the prison—including kissing a lesbian prisoner (Heather Cassils) in the exercise yard, wearing sunglasses made out of half-smoked cigarettes, and watching catfights in the commissary. Gaga's sister, Natali Germanotta, makes a cameo in the commissary scene. After that, Gaga answers a call from Beyoncé, and begins to sing the song. She performs the first verse and chorus with other scantily clad inmates, followed by a bridge featuring Gaga wearing a yellow caution tape outfit designed by Brian Lichtenberg.|$|E

500|$|In the video, Dev {{is seen in}} a club {{scene with}} intense dancing. The main focus is black-painted hands and arms, which are {{prominent}} in several shots of Dev as she is standing naked while the hands are touching her body. Some of the hands were digitally added, {{but the majority of}} them were real, including the ones touching Dev. She explained, [...] "The extras were amazing, they let me paint their hands and bodies, and they stacked {{on top of each other}} and did that for hours. For takes and takes and takes." [...] The video also includes shots of an albino ball python and a tarantula. Cory Lamz of Westword wrote a positive review of the video: [...] "Watching 'In the Dark' is like dancing under a strobe light on ecstasy. In a sea of hands, literally, Dev manages to tease you, seduce you and entice <b>you.</b> <b>She</b> makes you want to touch her, just like every other hand in the video." [...] Contessa Gayles of AOL Music referred the video to as [...] "freaky" [...] and [...] "funky", writing [...] "Forget 'dancing in the dark,' Dev works it in a sea of dismembered, black-painted hands and arms in this freaky, funky new vid." [...] In contrast, Becky Bain of Idolator called it [...] "somewhat unsettling".|$|E
500|$|TV Overmind Carissa Pavlica {{commented on}} Tom Pelphrey guest role saying [...] "I adored Guiding Light and {{considering}} the roles Tom Pelphrey (my beloved Jonathan from GL) gets after his run as the bad-boy, I immediately suspected {{he would be}} the killer. Turned out I was wrong, but he was still a class A jerk". Of the episode she said, [...] "The suspects pile up so fast and furious, that it's difficult to figure out the perpetrator until they are ready to tell <b>you.</b> <b>She</b> added that she had [...] "much respect for that method of storytelling". She continued, [...] "There is nothing I enjoy less than watching the crime being committed in the first minutes of a show and then watching the respective squad of police and detectives miss clues we already know. Body of Proof isn't afraid to allow the audience to use their intellect". Pavlica also enjoyed the relationship between Megan and Lacey, calling it [...] "heart wrenching" [...] saying that she had a tear in eye due to the scenes. [...] "I'm enjoying how the writers are piecing together the strained relationship they had, in a realistic, no holds barred way". However, Pavica was afraid to [...] "jinx" [...] the show, as she had [...] "no idea of Body of Proofs place in the ratings", adding that she was [...] "nervous" [...] as it is up against shows such as The Good Wife and Parenthood.|$|E

2500|$|Over the red, {{black and}} white canvas there is a poem written in Braille by poet Chloe Mitchell; the braille follows {{the theme of the}} album's singles artwork which also {{features}} the same technique.

[...] During the cover's designing stage, Rihanna met with Mitchell, in which they [...] "drank" [...] {{and came up with a}} poem that would be used for the artwork and liner notes entitled If They Let Us. Mitchell explained the poem and its meaning to Rolling Stone magazine, stating it was about being misunderstood, but still be able to stand out while doing what is right for <b>you.</b> <b>She</b> further said that the poem speaks about not conforming to society and being a leader as well as accepting that being misunderstood is a positive thing.|$|E
2500|$|Clarkson pegged [...] "Piece by Piece" [...] as a {{follow-up}} song to her 2004 track [...] "Because of You" [...] and the album's [...] "most personal" [...] record, saying that [...] "once you've worked through {{that and you}} find love {{and the kind of}} happiness you hoped for but didn't really know was possible. It's a happy song. And it has a happy ending, unlike 'Because of <b>You.</b> <b>She</b> revealed that she was inspired to write it after a discussion with her sister about their relationships with their respective families. She remarked, [...] "I was talking to my sister on the phone about how sometimes girls with daddy issues don't find men like that!". Clarkson also noted that how their husbands were so supportive and loving were {{in stark contrast to the}} cliché about people with [...] "abandonment issues" [...] dating [...] "losers". She also said that [...] "Piece by Piece" [...] is a positive song, despite its somber resonance, and that she's still grateful to her father for making her want to be much more present in her family. Sonically, Jon Pareles of The New York Times compared it to the anthems recorded by U2. While Marissa Muller of CBS Radio described its sound as having a stadium feel with big drums.|$|E

2500|$|Letts and Dicks also {{intended}} that Jo Grant {{would be}} cast {{so as to}} go beyond the stereotype of a [...] "pretty doll... who can just stand there and scream." [...] They settled on young actress Katy Manning, whose personality had impressed in an otherwise shambolic audition. Others shortlisted for the part included Yutte Stensgaard, Shakira Baksh, Jenny McCracken, Cheryl Hall, and Gabrielle Drake. According to the commentary provided by Letts for the DVD release of Terror of the Autons, Rula Lenska and Anouska Hempel also auditioned for the role. The same DVD notes that Pertwee himself had spotted Manning {{in the lobby of the}} BBC TV Centre, but had not known who she was. He told Letts he had seen the [...] "perfect actress" [...] for the role, but Letts was unaware of who he was extolling. When Letts cast Manning and introduced her to the show's star, Pertwee was delighted and said [...] "I told <b>you</b> <b>she</b> was the girl for the part". Both Jenny McCracken and Cheryl Hall explain on the DVD commentary for the [...] "Special Edition" [...] of Carnival of Monsters, that they were on the final shortlist of six actresses for the part of Jo, losing out to Manning. Barry Letts cast them both in Carnival of Monsters as a direct consequence of their auditions.|$|E
2500|$|At the time, {{the rebels}} {{had yet to}} {{completely}} surround Duchang, so Taishi Ci managed to sneak past the enemy at night and enter the fortress to meet Kong Rong. He asked Kong Rong to let him lead soldiers to fight their way out, but Kong refused and insisted on waiting for reinforcements. The rebels came closer day by day. Kong Rong wanted to seek help from Liu Bei, the Chancellor of Pingyuan State (平原國; around present-day Pingyuan, Shandong), {{but no one had}} any idea on how {{to break out of the}} siege. Taishi Ci volunteered to fight his way out and seek reinforcements from Liu Bei, but Kong Rong said, [...] "The rebels have completely surrounded the fortress.

[...] Taishi Ci replied, [...] "When I was away, you treated my mother very generously.

2500|$|Drew Millard of Vice {{stated the}} album [...] "inadvertently predicts {{most of the}} cooler trends in {{contemporary}} indie music," [...] saying, [...] "Dam-Funk's bedroom-keyb attack?

[...] Merchandise sold at Well's shows feature a quote from interlude [...] "Memory." [...] Indie rock band Wheat used the album as a reference for their sophomore album Hope and Adams, also emulating its production techniques within lead single [...] "Don't I Hold You." [...] Folk rock singer Melissa Ferrick called it [...] "a huge record" [...] which inspired her song [...] "Drive," [...] saying, [...] "Janet Jackson was making these sexual noises on that record and I cannot even describe. [...] I was like [...] "This is unbelievable. Janet Jackson is so ballsy to do this. This is amazing." [...] Cassie Ramone of Vivian Girls and folk singer Seth Glier regarded the album as an important life memoir. Swedish singer Beatrice Eli stated it [...] "defined her teenage years." [...] Art Nouvea considered Fiona Apple's When the Pawn... to be influenced by the record.
