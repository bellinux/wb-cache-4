25|$|During {{the winter}} of 1904-1905, Wada was hunting seals along the Beaufort Sea. He was {{accompanied}} by several Indians. In August 1906, {{he was back in}} Nome. He promptly lost the money he'd made selling pelts in a card game, and he was arrested yet again, this time because some of the money he'd lost belonged to his Indian companions. The two Indians testified against him, but an all-white jury acquitted him anyway. Wada was arrested a third time, in Candle, on the same charges, and he {{spent the rest of the}} <b>year</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out of court.|$|E
25|$|Bunning's 2,855 career strikeouts put him {{in second}} place on the all-time list {{at the time of}} his retirement, behind only Walter Johnson. His mark was later surpassed by other pitchers, and he is {{currently}} 17th all-time. Despite <b>year</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> year out putting up excellent numbers, Bunning rarely led the league in any pitching categories. He never led the league in ERA; the only year he led the league in wins (20, in 1957, with the Detroit Tigers) was the only year he ever won 20 or more games; he did, however, lead the league in strikeouts three times (with 201 in 1959 and 1960, and 253 in 1967). He never won a Cy Young Award; the closest he would come was in 1967, his best year, when at age 35, he came in second behind Mike McCormick. He finished with a middling 17–15 record, but posted a career-best ERA (2.29), and led the league in shutouts (6), games started and innings pitched (40/302.1), and strikeouts (253). It was the only year in his career he earned any Cy Young Award votes. He did, however, win the NL Player of the Month Award June 1964, the month of his perfect game (3–0, 2.20 ERA, 42 SO).|$|E

500|$|Picket Fences {{was one of}} {{the first}} American {{television}} series to feature an intimate kiss between two women. Two years earlier, L. A. Law had aired an episode (also written by Kelley) that included a kiss between bisexual-identified character C. J. Lamb (Amanda Donohoe) and straight-identifying Abby Perkins (Michele Greene). The kiss led to complaints to the network and five sponsors pulled their ads from the episode. In reviewing incidents of lesbian kisses on network television programs, the New York Times noted that they tended to happen during [...] "sweeps" [...] periods, when the networks use Nielsen ratings to determine advertising rates. Noting lesbian kisses during sweeps periods on such shows as L. A. Law, Roseanne, Party of Five and Ally McBeal in addition to the Picket Fences episode and noting that they were occurring about once per year, the Times concludes that kisses between women are: [...] "Eminently visual; cheap, provided the actors are willing; controversial, <b>year</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> year out; and elegantly reversible (sweeps lesbians typically vanish or go straight when the week's over), kisses between women are perfect sweeps stunts. They offer something for everyone, from advocacy groups looking for role models to indignation-seeking conservatives, from goggle-eyed male viewers to progressive female ones, from tyrants who demand psychological complexity to plot buffs." ...|$|E
