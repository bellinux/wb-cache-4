5|$|Nixon: Hello, Neil and Buzz. I'm {{talking to}} you by {{telephone}} from the Oval Room at the White House. And this certainly {{has to be the}} most historic telephone call ever made. I just can't tell you how proud we all are of what you've done. For every American, this has to be the proudest day of our lives. And for people all over the world, I am sure they too join with Americans in recognizing what an immense feat this is. Because of what <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>done,</b> the heavens have become a part of man's world. And as you talk to us from the Sea of Tranquility, it inspires us to redouble our efforts to bring peace and tranquility to Earth. For one priceless moment in the whole history of man, all the people on this Earth are truly one: one in their pride in what <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>done,</b> and one in our prayers that you will return safely to Earth.|$|E
5|$|De Hauteclocque {{broke his}} leg {{in two places}} in a fall from his horse in 1936. He told his company {{that it was his}} own fault for riding on the {{shoulder}} of the road. Thereafter he frequently walked with a cane. After another mishap involving losing his way during a tactical exercise and getting stuck in a field cordoned off with barbed wire, he told them that when <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> something really stupid, it is best to admit it.|$|E
25|$|This conduct {{upon his}} part seems {{perfectly}} unaccountable...You know that I have always counselled you to bear everything and remain to the last. I thought {{it for the}} best. I am afraid {{it is no longer}} possible. Open breaches of this kind are always to be lamented, but you have the consolation that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> your utmost to stave this extremity off as long as possible.|$|E

25|$|On August 16, 400 JDL members began {{a week-long}} march from Philadelphia to Washington {{on behalf of}} Soviet Jewry, {{concluding}} with a rally at Lafayette Park urging President Nixon to “stand tall and firm in the Middle East as <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> elsewhere.” In response, Thomas Hale Boggs Jr., a congressional candidate from Montgomery County (Md.), said he would sponsor a House resolution on Soviet Jewry.|$|E
25|$|Neither man nor {{woman was}} cursed by God at The Fall of Man—"So the Lord God {{said to the}} serpent, 'Because <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> this, cursed are you above all {{livestock}} and all wild animals! You will crawl on your belly and you will eat dust all the days of your life.' The human couple were warned by God in a prophetic sense {{what would be the}} natural consequences of sin having entered the human race. The natural consequences of sin mentioned by God in the Creation account included increased pains in childbearing, and the husband will rule over you.|$|E
25|$|You stand {{convicted of}} the truly evil {{abduction}} and murder of a vulnerable young girl in 1991 and thereafter of attempting to defeat the ends of justice in various ways over an extended period... Yet again you have shown yourself to be unfit {{to live in a}} decent society. It is hard for me to convey the loathing and revulsion that ordinary people will feel for what <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>done...</b> I fix the minimum period which you must spend in custody at 30 years. Had it been open to me I would have made that period run consecutive to the 21 year custodial period that you are already serving.|$|E

25|$|You have no {{idea what}} sending on those checks to me at this time. After {{fighting}} for an idea all your life I realize that your backing has saved it for me and meant to thank you with all my heart and soul for what <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>done.</b> It has been marvelous. So many letters have been written and not mailed and owing to having been in bed {{a great deal of time}} this summer, the paintings were about all I could muster up enough energy to do what I considered the best of my ability. Just before Stieglitz’s death I took some paintings to him that I considered as having something new in the. He immediately walked right up to them and spoke of the new ideas. His intuition in that way was remarkable and I am so glad to have been allowed to live during his and your lifetimes. It has been a great privilege for which I am truly thankful.|$|E
25|$|To you the IRA and all {{who support}} you or defend you, {{we have to}} say that we feel dirty today. Foul and dirty deeds by Irishmen are making Ireland a foul and dirty place, for it is things done by Irishmen that make us unclean. What the British could never do, what the Unionists could never do, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>done.</b> You have made us bow our heads in shame and that is a dirty feeling. The IRA is like a cancer in the body of Ireland, {{spreading}} death, killing and corruption. It is the unrelenting enemy of life and the community is afraid because it cannot see or identify it. We want the cancer of the IRA removed from our midst but not by means that will leave the moral fibre of society damaged and the system unclean. Fighting evil by corrupt means kills pawns like Joe and leaves every one of us vulnerable and afraid. And it allows Joe's killers to draw a sickening veneer of respectability over cold-blooded murder and to wash their hands like Pontius Pilate.|$|E

500|$|Although Sunday {{was ordained}} by the Presbyterian Church in 1903, his {{ministry}} was nondenominational {{and he was}} not a strict Calvinist. He preached that individuals were, at least in part, responsible for their own salvation. [...] "Trail hitters" [...] were given a four-page tract that stated, [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> your part (i.e. believe that Christ died in your place, and receive Him as your Saviour and Master) God has done HIS part and imparted to you His own nature." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{weathering}} a few storms, {{the ships}} met nine {{of their fellow}} U.S. Navy ships five days out of Hampton Roads: four battleships ( [...] , , , and – the only sister of Connecticut to not make the cruise, two armored cruisers, and three scout cruisers. Connecticut then led all of these warships around Tail-of-the-Horseshoe Lightship on 22 February to pass in review of President Roosevelt, who was then on the presidential yacht anchored off Old Point Comfort, ending a [...] trip. Roosevelt boarded the ship after she anchored and gave a short speech, saying, [...] "You've done the trick. Other nations may do as <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>done,</b> but they'll follow you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't bite {{your thumb}} at me," [...] Kew went on. [...] "I {{know you could}} thrash me, if that's {{what you mean by}} shaking your fists; so could most men.

500|$|Robinson's Hollywood exploits, however, did not {{sit well}} with Dodgers {{co-owner}} Walter O'Malley, who referred to Robinson as [...] "Rickey's prima donna". In late 1950, Rickey's contract as the Dodgers' team President expired. Weary of constant disagreements with O'Malley, and with no hope of being re-appointed as President of the Dodgers, Rickey cashed out his one-quarter financial interest in the team, leaving O'Malley in full control of the franchise. Rickey shortly thereafter became general manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates. Robinson was disappointed at the turn of events and wrote a sympathetic letter to Rickey, whom he considered a father figure, stating, [...] "Regardless of what happens to me in the future, it all can be placed on what <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> and, believe me, I appreciate it." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{the evening}} progressed Huskisson {{continued}} to weaken. The doctors {{had concluded that}} without amputation {{he would continue to}} deteriorate, but that he had no realistic chance of surviving major surgery, and broke this news to the Huskissons. William Huskisson already believed that he was dying and had resigned himself to his fate; Emily Huskisson at first caused [...] "a dreadful scene... but at last she calmed herself and {{during the rest of the}} time sat weeping by the couch". Huskisson told Brandreth [...] "You see I shall never live to make any return for your kindness. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> all that is possible, but it is all in vain." [...] After further laudanum, he complained [...] "Why endeavour to support my strength? I must die, it is only prolonging my sufferings." ...|$|E
500|$|Sinatra {{received}} three honorary degrees {{during his}} lifetime. In May 1976, {{he was invited}} to speak at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) graduation commencement held at Sam Boyd Stadium. It was at this commencement that he was bestowed an Honorary Doctorate litterarum humanarum by the university. During his speech, Sinatra noted that his education had come from [...] "the school of hard knocks" [...] and was suitably touched by the award. He went on to describe that [...] "this is the first educational degree I have ever held in my hand. I will never forget what <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> for me today". A few years later in 1984 and 1985, Sinatra also received an Honorary Doctorate of Fine Arts from Loyola Marymount University as well as an Honorary Doctorate of Engineering from the Stevens Institute of Technology.|$|E

500|$|Studios Hergé serialised Tintin in Tibet weekly from September 1958 to November 1959, {{two pages}} per week, in Tintin magazine. Because {{of his desire}} for accuracy, Hergé added the logo of Air India to the {{airliner}} crash debris. A representative of Air India complained to Hergé about the adverse publicity the airline might suffer, arguing, [...] "It's scandalous, none of our aircraft has ever crashed; <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> us a considerable wrong." [...] Air India had cooperated with Hergé, aiding his research by providing him reading material, contemporary photographs, and film footage of India and Nepal, particularly Delhi and Kathmandu. While the crashed aircraft's tail number remained [...] "VT", the country code for Indian aircraft, Hergé agreed to change the airline logo in the published edition to the fictional Sari-Airways, dryly noting that {{there were so many}} Indian airlines it was possible that there really was a Sari-Airways.|$|E
500|$|Post editor Hibbs {{said that}} the Four Freedoms were an [...] "inspiration... {{in the same way}} that the clock tower of old Independence Hall, which I can see from my office window, inspires me." [...] Roosevelt wrote to Rockwell [...] "I think <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> a superb job in {{bringing}} home to the plain, everyday citizen the plain, everyday truths behind the Four Freedoms... I congratulate you not alone on the execution but also for the spirit which impelled you to make this contribution to the common cause of a freer, happier world". Roosevelt wrote to The Post, [...] "This is the first pictorial representation I have seen of the staunchly American values contained in the rights of free speech and free worship and our goals of freedom from fear and want." [...] Roosevelt also wrote of the corresponding essays, [...] "Their words should inspire all who read them with a deeper appreciation of the way of life we are striving to preserve." ...|$|E
500|$|Parts II and III have {{a similar}} structure; an {{overarching}} narrative of the Fairchild family is interspersed with inset moral tales. Both are noticeably less evangelical than Part I. Part II begins with the recognition by the Fairchild parents that their children have [...] "a new and divine nature, which works against your evil natures, causing you to know when <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> wrong, and making you truly and deeply sorrowful when you have committed a sin." [...] Emily, Lucy and Henry have finally learned to discipline their own souls. Parts II and III focus {{to a greater extent}} on good breeding, virtuous consumption and one's duty to the poor than does Part I. One of the most important lessons that the children learn, for instance, is respect for their elders. Moreover, the gibbet to which the children had been taken to observe a rotting corpse and instructed regarding the spiritual perils of sibling rivalry in Part I, has disappeared in Part II; Henry and his father walk by the spot where it used to stand and note its absence.|$|E
