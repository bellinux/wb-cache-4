2500|$|On 6 May two representatives on mission {{had written}} {{a letter to the}} Committee of Public Safety {{describing}} Charbonnier as incompetent and requesting a more experienced commander. It was probably during early May that a balloonist serving with the army overheard a weird conversation between the two commanders. Charbonnier complained that his soldiers were starving in their encampments. He wanted to move across the Sambre in order to get food for his troops. Desjardin agreed but noted that they must organize the operation in the correct military way. Charbonnier replied, [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>so?</b> Good, you arrange things militarily; you take charge of that. For me, I'm going to take charge of eating vegetables and pumping oils." ...|$|E

"Oh, I've {{no doubt}} she's made <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>so,</b> Dan," [...] said his mother, with {{unabated}} fondness for him; [...] "and <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>so</b> because you're so simple and good, and never suspect evil of any one. It's this hideous optimism that's killing everything--" ...|$|E
60|$|Don Jer. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>so?</b> But, I believe, {{you will}} not see a prettier girl.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, husband, I hope <b>you</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>so!</b> I wanted <b>you</b> {{to say you}} didn't. And if <b>you</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>so,</b> yes, I'll {{believe it}} came for that!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is not a}} secondary, but {{a primary}} thing, Raoul; oh! that I could make <b>thee</b> <b>think</b> <b>so.</b> The {{question}} is between thee and God--were it aught else, thou might'st indeed prevail." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "If <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> know <b>so</b> {{much about}} making a video game, make one yourself!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{would have}} too much spirit to show I was hurt, though," [...] cries Hetty, {{clenching}} her little fists. [...] "And I would smile, though that horrible old painted woman boxed my ears. She is horrible, mamma. <b>You</b> <b>think</b> <b>so</b> yourself, Theo! Own, now, <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>so</b> yourself! You said so last night, and acted her coming in on her crutch, and grinning round to the company." ...|$|E
60|$|MR. A. <b>You</b> <b>think</b> <b>so!</b> I {{wonder whether}} I have been blind, {{and let her}} {{undertake}} too much.|$|E
60|$|DEARTH. I am glad <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>so.</b> I {{wore out}} {{the point of}} my little finger over that dimple.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> are <b>so</b> lovely, my dear?" [...] asked Lizzie Acton, {{with her}} little inoffensive pertness, biting off a knot in her knitting.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is much better," [...] Maria said approvingly. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> have {{improved}} {{since you have}} been away. Do <b>you</b> not <b>think</b> <b>so,</b> Giulia?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> really <b>think</b> <b>so,</b> madame?" [...] murmured Jeanne, {{in whose}} tear-stained eyes the indomitable hopefulness of youth was already striving to shine.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{will likely}} be time enough for his own weddin'--whatever," [...] remarked Duncan junior. [...] "Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>so,</b> Miss Jessie?" ...|$|E
60|$|YOUNG OFF. Yes; <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>so,</b> but it isn't, you know, or you wouldn't have 'been crying when I met you.|$|E
6000|$|Johnny Eames was {{standing}} close, and whispered into her ear, [...] "Changes are so pleasant sometimes! Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>so?</b> I do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mrs. Perkins is a {{very kind}} creature," [...] I said, [...] "and {{it was a very}} {{pleasant}} ball. Did <b>you</b> not <b>think</b> <b>so,</b> Miss Kicklebury?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> {{they will}} not?' said Phoebe, with slower and graver steps. 'Do <b>you</b> really <b>think</b> <b>so?</b> But no! It can't lead to coming out; and I know they {{like me to}} be happy when it interferes with nobody.' ...|$|R
6000|$|BROADBENT [delighted]. I hope <b>so.</b> I <b>think</b> <b>so.</b> [Fluctuating] <b>You</b> really <b>think</b> <b>so?</b> <b>You</b> {{are sure}} you are not {{allowing}} your enthusiasm for our principles to {{get the better of}} your judgment? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, Captain Rule, I know <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>so</b> and say so--but I {{set down}} all these matters as {{somewhat}} various and onaccountable." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, as {{circumstances}} then were, {{in truth}} {{it could not}} be avoided. Common prudence made it necessary. Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>so,</b> Mr. Saul?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You foolish child!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "I {{believe that}} you have been worrying. Why do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>so</b> much about other people?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't you indeed? I'm {{after all}} very much afraid of <b>you.</b> Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> I'm <b>so</b> very easily pleased?" [...] she asked suddenly, {{changing}} her tone.|$|R
6000|$|... "Brother, <b>you</b> may <b>think</b> <b>so,</b> but it don't make it so. I'm just tellin' you you ain't ben in an hour. I heard 'm lacin' you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "None; and I even {{ventured to}} appear in this fashion lest <b>you</b> should <b>think</b> <b>so.</b> I also {{wanted to thank you}} for taking care of me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So unnatural, you know," [...] said Miss Dawkins; [...] "so {{opposed to}} the {{fostering}} principles of creation. Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>so,</b> Mr. Ingram?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The judge eagerly {{caught at}} the notion. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>so?</b> It {{would be like}} her! Ellen would wish him to know everything." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Capital, capital!' {{the other}} English exclaimed. 'Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>so,</b> papa?' Hubert added, seeing that Mr. Hardy {{did not join}} in the general approval.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! {{you thought}} so! Really! Kind of <b>you</b> to <b>think</b> <b>so.</b> And have <b>you</b> just thought about {{those that are}} coming, or have you made sure?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I did," [...] she said. [...] "Now I {{have told}} you everything, and if <b>you</b> choose to <b>think</b> I have been bad,--why <b>you</b> must <b>think</b> <b>so,</b> and I must put up with it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, that's the difference! A Berliner {{could do}} it, and a Bostonian couldn't. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> it <b>so</b> {{much better to}} have the courage of your convictions?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Betty {{needs some}} {{one of the}} sterner sex to cheer her," [...] said Alice, mischievously, her eyes twinkling. [...] "Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>so,</b> Lydia?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hold your tongue," [...] {{answered}} Alan savagely. [...] "Did <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>so</b> {{years ago}} when you were put into that pen to be butchered?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{are very}} alarming, these thunderstorms," [...] he said, helping himself to porridge. [...] "Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>so?</b> Or are you above being frightened?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, Victor, be reasonable," [...] she protested; [...] "suggest a way {{yourself}} if <b>you</b> <b>think</b> it <b>so</b> easy. I {{tell you that}} he never leaves the room!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Did {{she make}} <b>you</b> <b>think</b> Caroline <b>so</b> very ill? Mr. Wells {{says it is}} only a very bad cold. But I am very glad you are come." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know, I {{see what}} you mean. I should say it had begun of late. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> it <b>so</b> bad a sign?" [...] she asked anxiously.|$|R
