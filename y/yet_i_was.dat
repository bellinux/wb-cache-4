2500|$|Entering the 1973 season, Stewart {{had decided}} to retire. He {{nevertheless}} won at South Africa, Belgium, Monaco, the Netherlands, and Austria. His last and then record-setting 27th victory came at the Nürburgring with a 1–2 for Tyrrell. [...] "Nothing gave me more satisfaction than to win at the Nürburgring and <b>yet,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> always afraid." [...] Stewart later said. [...] "When I left home for the German Grand Prix I always used to pause {{at the end of}} the driveway and take a long look back. I was never sure I'd come home again." [...] After the fatal crash of his teammate François Cevert in practice for the 1973 United States Grand Prix at Watkins Glen, Stewart retired one race earlier than intended and missed what would have been his 100th Grand Prix. Stewart had already won the Drivers' Championship at the Italian Grand Prix two races previously; this was a race where Stewart had to come into the pits to change a flat tyre, and he drove from 20th to finish 4th.|$|E

2500|$|This {{conclusion}} {{on human}} unity {{was supported by}} monogenism, including John Bachman's evidence that intercrossed human races were fully fertile. Proponents of polygenism opposed unity, but the gradual transition from one race to another confused them {{when they tried to}} decide how many human races should count as species: Louis Agassiz said eight, but Morton said twenty-two. Darwin commented that the [...] "question whether mankind consists of one or several species has of late years been much agitated by anthropologists, who are divided into two schools of monogenists and polygenists." [...] The latter had to [...] "look at species either as separate creations or as in some manner distinct entities". but those accepting evolution [...] "will feel no doubt that all the races of man are descended from a single primitive stock". Although races differed considerably, they also shared so many features [...] "that it is extremely improbable that they should have been independently acquired by aboriginally distinct species or races." [...] He drew on his memories of Jemmy Button and John Edmonstone to emphasise [...] "the numerous points of mental similarity between the most distinct races of man. The American aborigines, Negroes and Europeans differ as much from each other in mind as any three races that can be named; <b>yet</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> incessantly struck, whilst living with the Fuegians on board the Beagle, with the many little traits of character, shewing how similar their minds were to ours; and so it was with a full-blooded negro with whom I happened once to be intimate." [...] Darwin concluded that [...] "...when the principles of evolution are generally accepted, as they surely will be before long, the dispute between the monogenists and the polygenists will die a silent and unobserved death." ...|$|E

Jeg gjør faktisk ingen forsøk på å skjule min affekt for Fripps arbeider. [...] ble jeg introdusert for King Crimson, og på nytt kollapset alt, men på en konstruktiv måte. [...] Fripp tryllet i alle fall fram de vakreste toner jeg hadde hørt, og han kunne ikke ha gitt seg til kjenne på et mer gunstig tidspunkt i mitt liv. [...] Ingen kan nekte for at Robert Fripp, også helt tidlig i karrieren, var opptatt av jazz eller de blå notene. Durskalaer og oppstemte gjengroprefrenger har aldri appellert til meg, så da King Crimson ble meg til del var det som å smake på en bit av himmelriket. (Q: You can't deny that you're influenced by Robert Fripp and King Crimson, right?Omar Rodríguez-López: No, of course not! I make {{no attempt to}} hide my affection for Fripps work. [...] I was introduced to King Crimson and again everything collapsed, but in a constructive way. [...] Fripp made the most beautiful notes that I had heard, and he couldn't have been introduced to me at a better time in my life. [...] As soon as someone discovers jazz, it will influence their approach irrespective of which style or band the person concerned contributes to. It can't be denied that Robert Fripp was into jazz throughout his career or the blue notes. The major-scales and euphoric stadium-rock choruses have never appealed to me so when I got familiar with King Crimson's music it was like getting a taste of heaven.) }} Trey Anastasio of Phish, St. Vincent, Kirk Hammett of Metallica,Kirk Hammett: There are fewer 30-part orchestrated guitar sections, fewer massive, bludgeoning riffs perfectly replicated by lames. There are more flexible ideas, more artistic flourishes, more colors. I've probably been influenced in that direction by people like Robert Fripp, Adrian Belew and David Torn. I'm more interested in using guitar sounds as textures and using effects in a more textural fashion. To paraphrase Robert Fripp, I'm more interested in painting a soundscape like he and Adrian Belew do in King Crimson, on Bowie records and in Fripp's solo stuff.

What I like about that is that without a blueprint, it’s just really weird music. Robert Fripp is an astonishingly good guitar player. Just doing the wierdest shit.
