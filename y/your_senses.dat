500|$|... "Habits (Stay High)" [...] {{was well}} {{received}} by most critics. Harley Brown of Billboard {{wrote that the}} track is [...] "one of the most easily identifiable pop songs [...] heard in recent memory: everyone's gotten high, maybe eaten too many Twinkies, and regretted life decisions, but not everyone makes a really superb song about it". Pitchfork's Carrie Battam stated that the track's hook and production make the lyrics [...] "sound gracefully sad instead of tragic". In her review of Queen of the Clouds, Battam called it [...] "a big, sticky song, but not so big that it stuns <b>your</b> <b>senses</b> or numbs you into enjoyment". [...] Ewald Arndt of FDRMX said that [...] "Habits (Stay High)" [...] is [...] "so fun to listen to" [...] despite its sad themes. AllMusic's Heather Phares called it [...] "the Queen of the Cloudss standout track, while Sam Lansky of Idolator stated that it [...] "has {{a little of the}} texture of Kesha's no-fucks-given party-girl pop but with the languorous sadness of Robyn" [...] and that [...] "It'll get stuck in your head, which is right where it deserves to be." [...] Nick Murray labeled it as Truth Serums best track, and compared it with the music of American rapper Kendrick Lamar.|$|E
500|$|The film {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics, with Chopra receiving critical acclaim for her performance. Subhash K. Jha awarded the film 5 stars out of 5, describing it as [...] "a motivational masterpiece" [...] and said [...] "From first frame to last it grips <b>your</b> <b>senses</b> and irrigates the parched corridors {{of your heart}} like very few bio-pics in recent times. Debutant director Omang Kumar weaves seamlessly {{in and out of}} Ms Kom's remarkable life creating a work that is as dramatic as Mehboob's Mother India and as inspiring as Attenborough's Gandhi." [...] Rediff.com rated the film 4.5 out of 5, noting it as a victory for its protagonist Chopra, scriptwriter Saiwyn Quadras, and director Omung Kumar and writing, [...] "Mary's story is delivered with a sincerity that makes it irresistible." [...] Sonia Chopra from Sify described the film as a [...] "thrilling ringside view", saying that [...] "Mary Kom is an important film that's hugely inspiring. But more importantly, it's also great fun to watch." [...] The Times of India gave the film a rating of 4 stars out of 5 calling it as Bollywood's answer to Academy Award-winning film Million Dollar Baby (2004). Bollywood Hungama gave it 4 stars, stating [...] "Omung Kumar certainly deserves an ovation for having shown the guts to make a biopic on Mary Kom, something which will surely go down in the history of exemplary biopics on Indian celluloid." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{opening track}} [...] "Playa Playa" [...] {{features}} basketball metaphors and gospel overtones, which accompany the track's slow funk and jazz vibe. On his bass {{playing in the}} song, Pino Palladino recalled [...] "I was thinking about Stevie Wonder in the choruses and P-Funk in the verses". Rob Evanoff of All About Jazz called the song [...] "an uplifting soul ride", and stated that it evokes an image of [...] "a musical train seen far off in the distance, slowly getting bigger as it gets closer". Evanoff also compared the track's style to the jam-sound of Pink Floyd, and wrote [...] "it surrounds you with a deep thick infectious groove that, at first, shadows and then envelopes <b>your</b> <b>senses</b> {{in such a way}} that is equal bits liberating, intoxicating and hypnotic…you close your eyes and are transported into another dimension". On the song's lyrics, one critic wrote that [...] "D'Angelo disses all neo-soul wannabes by calmly singing 'Bring the drama playa/Give me all U got'". [...] "Devil's Pie" [...] is a funk and hip hop diatribe with a lyrical theme concerning hip hop excess, and it is accompanied by P-Funk style harmonies and low-key singing by D'Angelo. It is a bass-driven track produced by DJ Premier, who contributes to its hip hop texture. The song's theme also incorporates religious imagery into its message of social strife. Questlove has stated that [...] "Devil's Pie" [...] was written to address the issues of [...] "the money hungry jiggafied state of the world we're in".|$|E

500|$|In 632, {{at the end}} of {{the tenth}} year after {{migration}} to Medina, Muhammad completed his first true Islamic pilgrimage, setting precedence for the annual Great Pilgrimage, known as Hajj. [...] On the 9th of Dhu al-Hijjah Muhammad delivered his Farewell Sermon, at Mount Arafat east of Mecca. In this sermon, Muhammad advised his followers not to follow certain pre-Islamic customs. For instance, he said a white has no superiority over a black, nor a black has any superiority over a white except by piety and good action. He abolished old blood feuds and disputes based on the former tribal system and asked for old pledges to be returned as implications of the creation of the new Islamic community. Commenting on the vulnerability of women in his society, Muhammad asked his male followers to [...] "be good to women, for they are powerless captives (awan) in your households. You took them in God's trust, and legitimated your sexual relations with the Word of God, so come to <b>your</b> <b>senses</b> people, and hear my words ..." [...] He told them that they were entitled to discipline their wives but should do so with kindness. He addressed the issue of inheritance by forbidding false claims of paternity or of a client relationship to the deceased and forbade his followers to leave their wealth to a testamentary heir. He also upheld the sacredness of four lunar months in each year. According to Sunni tafsir, the following Quranic verse was delivered during this event: [...] "Today I have perfected your religion, and completed my favours for you and chosen Islam as a religion for you" [...] (Quran [...] ). According to Shia tafsir, it refers to the appointment of Ali ibn Abi Talib at the pond of Khumm as Muhammad's successor, this occurring a few days later when Muslims were returning from Mecca to Medina.|$|E
2500|$|The {{objection}} to the objectification of women is not a recent phenomenon. In the French Enlightenment, for example, there was a debate as to whether a woman's breasts were merely a sensual enticement or rather a natural gift. In Alexandre Guillaume Mouslier de Moissy's 1771 play The True Mother (La Vraie Mère), the title character rebukes her husband for treating her as merely an object for his sexual gratification: [...] "Are <b>your</b> <b>senses</b> so gross as to look on these breasts [...] the respectable treasures of nature [...] as merely an embellishment, destined to ornament the chest of women?" ...|$|E

Attune <b>your</b> <b>senses</b> finely to recognize the sensuous touches of nature. Winter flowers are not fragrant, but there is a smell to them. Identify it.

The more you sensitize yourself, the more Nature reveals her secrets." ...|$|E

Ellison worked alongside IDW on the comic, with artwork by J.K. Woodward and additional writing by Scott and David Tipton.
