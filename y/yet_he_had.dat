5|$|By {{the time}} Ross began a 90-day {{furlough}} on March 13, 1865, he {{had participated in}} 135 engagements with the enemy and his horse had been shot {{out from under him}} five times, <b>yet</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> escaped serious injury. With his leave approved, Ross hurried home to Texas to visit the wife he had not seen in two years. While at home, the Confederate Army began its surrender. He had not rejoined his regiment when it surrendered in Jackson, Mississippi, on May 14, 1865. Because he was not present at the surrender, Ross did not receive a parole protecting him from arrest. As a Confederate Army officer over the rank of colonel, Ross was also exempted from President Andrew Johnson's amnesty proclamation of May 29, 1865. To prevent his arrest and the confiscation of his property, on August 4, 1865, Ross applied for a special pardon for his treason against the United States. Johnson personally approved Ross's application on October 22, 1866, but Ross did not receive and formally accept the pardon until July 1867.|$|E

Hazlitt had known Godwin earlier, their families having been friends since before Hazlitt's birth; as he also often visited the elder man in London in later years, {{he was able to}} gather impressions over many decades. While so many of his contemporaries soon abandoned Godwin's philosophy, Hazlitt never did so completely; <b>yet</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> never quite been a disciple either. Eventually, although he retained respect for the man, he developed a critical distance from Godwinian philosophy.|$|E
25|$|Of course, Cnut's {{journey to}} Rome in 1027 is {{another sign of}} his {{dedication}} to the Christian religion. It may be {{that he went to}} attend the coronation of Conrad II in order to improve relations between the two powers, <b>yet</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> previously made a vow to seek the favour of St Peter, the keeper of the keys to the heavenly kingdom. While in Rome, Cnut made an agreement with the Pope to reduce the fees paid by the English archbishops to receive their pallium. He also arranged that travellers from his realm not be straightened by unjust tolls and that they should be safeguarded on their way to and from Rome. Some evidence exists for a second journey in 1030.|$|E

Whorf had met Sapir, the leading US linguist of the day, at professional conferences, and in 1931 Sapir came to Yale from the University of Chicago to take a position as Professor of Anthropology. Alfred Tozzer sent Sapir a copy of Whorf's paper on [...] "Nahuatl tones and saltillo".

[...] Although Ronnie Spector's name did {{not appear in the}} album credits, snippets of her 1971 guide vocal remain on Harrison's released recording.

500|$|In 1948–49, {{when he was}} 18, Pinter {{opposed the}} {{politics}} of the Cold War, leading to his decision to become a conscientious objector and to refuse to comply with National Service in the British military. However, he told interviewers that, if he had been old enough at the time, he would have fought against the Nazis in World War II. [...] He seemed to express ambivalence, both indifference and hostility, towards political structures and politicians in his Fall 1966 Paris Review interview conducted by Lawrence M. Bensky. [...] <b>Yet,</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been an early member of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and also had supported the British Anti-Apartheid Movement (1959–1994), participating in British artists' refusal to permit professional productions of their work in South Africa in 1963 and in subsequent related campaigns. [...] In [...] "A Play and Its Politics", a 1985 interview with Nicholas Hern, Pinter described his earlier plays retrospectively {{from the perspective of the}} politics of power and the dynamics of oppression.|$|E
500|$|Hardy said: [...] "He {{combined}} a {{power of}} generalization, a feeling for form, and a capacity for rapid modification of his hypotheses, that were often really startling, and made him, in his own peculiar field, without a rival in his day. The limitations of his knowledge were as startling as its profundity. Here {{was a man who}} could work out modular equations and theorems... to orders unheard of, whose mastery of continued fractions was... beyond that of any mathematician in the world, who had found for himself the functional equation of the zeta function and the dominant terms of many of the most famous problems in the analytic theory of numbers; and <b>yet</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> never heard of a doubly periodic function or of Cauchy's theorem, and had indeed but the vaguest idea of what a function of a complex variable was...". When asked about the methods Ramanujan employed to arrive at his solutions, Hardy said that they were [...] "arrived at by a process of mingled argument, intuition, and induction, of which he was entirely unable to give any coherent account." [...] He also stated that he had [...] "never met his equal, and can compare him only with Euler or Jacobi." ...|$|E
500|$|Soon {{they heard}} about an {{engaging}} minister named John Cotton who preached at Saints Botolph's Church {{in the large}} port of Boston, about [...] from Alford. Cotton was installed as minister at Boston the year that the Hutchinsons were married, after having been a tutor at Emmanuel College in Cambridge. [...] He was only 27years old, <b>yet</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> gained {{a reputation as one}} of the leading Puritans in England. [...] Once the Hutchinsons heard Cotton preach, the couple made the trip to Boston as often as possible, enduring the ride by horseback when the weather and circumstances allowed. [...] Cotton's spiritual message was different from that of his fellow Puritans, as he placed less emphasis on one's behavior to attain God's salvation and more emphasis on the moment of religious conversion [...] "in which mortal man was infused with a divine grace." [...] Anne Hutchinson was greatly attracted to Cotton's theology of [...] "absolute grace", which caused her to question the value of [...] "works" [...] and to view the Holy Spirit as [...] "indwelling in the elect saint". [...] This allowed her to identify as a [...] "mystic participant in the transcendent power of the Almighty"; such a theology was empowering to women, according to Eve LaPlante, whose status was otherwise determined by their husbands or fathers.|$|E

500|$|Early in the season, England played The South at Twickenham, winning 21–12, with {{outstanding}} performances from Dingle, {{as well as}} Johnson and Poulton. Dingle then {{played in}} the third and final trial against the Rest of England, which England won 42–27. His selection for the Five Nations came up for the match against Scotland, replacing Roberts on the left wing, who had had a poor game in the prior encounter against Ireland. Before the Scotland match on 21 March, Bill Maclagan described the English team {{as one of the best}} to visit Scotland. Having already defeated Wales and Ireland, England beat Scotland 15–16 in a close-fought game. Scotland, with the wind behind them, opened the scoring in the first half with a try but England equalised just before half time. After the break, England got up a lead of 6–16 and victory seemed certain. Scotland responded and closed the gap to one point. After Cherry Pillman's leg was broken in a tackle, England were playing with fourteen men, but they managed to hold on, thereby winning both the Triple Crown and the Calcutta Cup, as well as the Five Nations Championship. Dingle, in the opening minutes, missed a try-scoring opportunity when he knocked-on a pass from Poulton. <b>Yet</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> a positive impact in other parts of the game. It was England's last international test on British soil before the First World War: 11 of the 30 players went on to be killed in it, including the Scotsman William Middleton Wallace, who died the same day as Dingle.|$|E
500|$|Epstein had {{no prior}} {{experience}} of artist management, <b>yet</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{a strong influence}} on the band's early dress code and stage demeanor. They had previously worn blue jeans and leather jackets, and they would stop and start songs when they felt like it or when an audience member requested a certain song. David Pomerran Szatmary states that when Epstein first saw them at The Cavern Club, he thought, [...] "They were a scruffy crowd in leather, {{and they were not}} very tidy and not very clean. They smoked as they played and they ate and talked and pretended to hit each other." [...] Epstein encouraged them to wear suits and ties, insisted that they stop swearing, smoking, drinking, or eating on stage, and also suggested the famous synchronised bow {{at the end of their}} performances. McCartney was the first to agree with Epstein's suggestions, believing that they reflected Epstein's RADA training. Epstein explained that the process from leather jackets and jeans to suits took some time: [...] "I encouraged them, at first, to get out of the leather jackets and jeans, and I wouldn't allow them to appear in jeans after a short time, and then, after that step, I got them to wear sweaters on stage, and then, very reluctantly, eventually, suits." [...] Epstein took the group to Wirral to see his friend, master tailor Beno Dorn, who made them their first suits based on a design they had previously seen, but which Epstein approved of: [...] "I thought it was an excellent design at the time." ...|$|E
500|$|Conceiving {{the initial}} script for Carnivàle between 1990 and 1992, Daniel Knauff set its plot in a {{carnival}} {{environment in the}} 1930s Dust Bowl, which he felt had not been dramatized as a series <b>yet.</b> <b>He</b> <b>had</b> grown up with a disabled father who was not commonly accepted as a normal human being. Freaks of the 1930s, however, who might not have found another place offering a future than a carnival, tended to be celebrities in the period. Daniel Knauf expanded the plot with a complex fictional universe based on a good versus evil theme, led by carnival healer Ben Hawkins and Brother Justin Crowe, a California preacher. In his story pitch to HBO, Knauf presented Carnivàle {{as a collection of}} media samples {{from the perspective of a}} fictional author trying to uncover Ben's mysterious story. These fictional samples consisted of interviews, diary entries, and various newspaper clippings, photos and book references forming the character biographies of all major Carnivàle characters. The character backgrounds were further developed before the filming of Carnivàle began, but were not made part of the show's visible structure. The audience would therefore only get to know the characters as a natural aspect in the story. The characters themselves are confronted with [...] "self-realization and becoming aware of these [...] powers and learning to harness them, and the implications of this battle between good and evil." [...] Seventeen actors received star billing in the first season; fifteen of whom were part of the carnival storyline. The second season amounted to thirteen main cast members, supplemented by several actors in recurring roles. Although such large casts make shows more expensive to produce, the writers have more flexibility in story decisions.|$|E
