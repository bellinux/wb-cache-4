500|$|Allmusic's Clayton Bolger {{described}} Young Modern as {{an improvement}} by the band, praising [...] "catchy melodic hooks, inspired lyrical themes, and stunning string arrangements".

PopMatters' Nick Pearson saw the opposite, claiming that [...] "nce you reach the level of intellectual maturity where <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> the difference between cryptic but poetic lyrics and nonsensical crap, you have outgrown Silverchair". Pearson called the album an attempt to secure a safer territory and assure sales, after the success of past works, calling it more boring than its predecessors. Other reviewers noted influences from cult British band XTC.|$|E
500|$|Nick Pearson of PopMatters, meanwhile, was {{critical}} of the album.

500|$|Paramount Pictures {{dropped its}} {{original}} {{protest against the}} film after their director Ivan Reitman, re-titled his film No Strings Attached. Screen Gems then moved forward with the title Friends with Benefits. At the same time, NBC was developing a sitcom with the same title, but the movie production company stated that due to its production schedule, they didn’t expect an issue to arise. Screen Gems chose to accelerate production fearing that they would lose their title to the competing Paramount project. Director Will Gluck spoke about the frustration of comparing the two films, stating: [...] "I wish there was more space between them. The thing that's irking me now is people are saying we're remaking No Strings Attached. We're not remaking it. The two movies were being made at the same time." [...] Gluck, {{in an interview with}} The New Zealand Herald, said that both films are different. Similar sentiments were expressed by Kunis, stating, [...] "It's just two different movies.

[...] Jeff Benjamin of Billboard called Roberts' effort the most [...] "intriguing" [...] {{out of all the}} Girls Aloud solo efforts. He said that Roberts had potential for success in the United States, comparing the song to the work of such artists as M.I.A., Robyn and Kelis. He asked readers to imagine that [...] "a young M.I.A. – mixed with Robyn and band Yelle – went on a shopping spree to Urban Outfitters, started chanting [...] "L! O! V! E!" [...] and turned it all into a true summer anthem." [...] A writer from Popjustice noted that [...] "Beat of My Drum" [...] "hardly happened by accident" [...] but that [...] "it feels really carefree and spontaneous", explaining [...] "what we mean by that is that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> a lot of care and attention has gone into it".|$|E
500|$|Aside from this, however, Madonna {{also wanted}} to explore the British club musical scene, where genres such as dub had been growing in popularity. In such a way, she decided to work with several European {{producers}} and composers within the electronic scene, including Nellee Hooper, who pleased Madonna due to his [...] "very European sensibility". Inviting Hooper over to Los Angeles, sessions started {{taking place in the}} Chappell Studios of Encino, California. Björk accepted the offer to write a track for Madonna's album, and wrote a song initially named [...] "Let's Get Unconscious". Once the song demo had been finished, Hooper and Marius De Vries rearranged the track and the final version was called [...] "Bedtime Story", which became the album's third single. Academic Georges Claude Guilbert, author of Madonna As Postmodern Myth, felt that the album's title was a pun; [...] " [...] is referring to (possible erotic) stories told at bedtime (in bed). In a way (the album) is really a book of stories <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> your kids at bedtime [...] sexuality explained to children [...] Madonna has always thought that children should be better informed in that aspect".|$|E
