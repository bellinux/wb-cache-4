2500|$|Ginzberg {{was born}} into a {{religious}} family whose piety and erudition was well known. The family traced its lineage back to the revered talmudist, halachist, and kabbalist Gaon of Vilna. Ginzberg emulated the Vilna Gaon’s intermingling of ‘academic knowledge’ in Torah studies under the label ‘historical Judaism’. In his book Students, Scholars and Saints, Ginzberg quotes the Vilna Gaon instructing, “Do not regard the views of the Shulchan Aruch as binding if <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are not in agreement with those of the Talmud.” ...|$|E

6000|$|... --"'Did <b>you</b> really <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{could keep}} {{us out of}} Nantes [...] while Lady Anthony Dewhurst is a {{prisoner}} in their hands?'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, really!' cried Mr. Pickwick, with {{manifest}} pleasure. 'Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> {{they care}} about my gaiters? Do <b>you</b> seriously <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> identify me at all with my gaiters?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Miss Affleck," [...] he said, [...] "has {{there been}} any disagreement, or have you heard any word from Merton or Mrs. Chance which might have led <b>you</b> to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{contemplated}} breaking off their acquaintance with you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{spoke as}} though {{something}} {{might have happened}} to him here," [...] the girl whispered. [...] "Oh! it is too horrible, this! What do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> meant?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, then, what do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> meant?" [...] cried De Catinat impatiently. [...] "For heaven's sake, let us {{come to some}} conclusion, {{for every}} minute is of importance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{beg your}} pardon, sir," [...] he said, raising his hat. [...] "I am {{just back from}} Australia--haven't seen a wedding in England for fifty years. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would let me into the church?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{will make}} you happy {{to know that you}} are making your mother happy, and the dear girls--and--and I have no doubt you will very soon get used to it. Many clergymen, <b>you</b> know, <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> ought not to marry." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{it as you}} like, Colonel O'Connor. However, your {{regiment}} will {{be placed}} in orders, today, as {{an exception to the}} severe censure passed upon the troops who entered the town last night. And do <b>you</b> really <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> will behave better, another time?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{are going}} too far, Armand," [...] she said vehemently. [...] "You are a republican, so am I [...] . {{we have the}} same thoughts, the same enthusiasm for liberty and {{equality}} [...] . but even <b>YOU</b> must <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are going too far [...] ." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing {{between you}} and me!" [...] she {{repeated}} with a ring of gentle scorn in her voice. [...] "Bernard, do you know so little of women, after all? Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> can play at love in this give-and-take fashion?" ...|$|E
6000|$|It sank now, and {{the boys}} lowered it five or six feet, {{so that they could}} partly see into it. [...] "There are lots of little fish {{swimming}} about, Tom," [...] Peter said in a whisper. [...] "Some are almost as long as one's hand. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> will go in, Tom?" ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{leaned back}} {{again in the}} chair and let her hands rest quietly in her lap. [...] "Would you have {{preferred}} me to remain outside, in the yacht, in the near neighbourhood of these wild men who captured you? Or do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they,</b> too, were got up to carry on a farce?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Forrest," [...] he said abruptly, [...] "it is {{a mistake}} to clear out all the {{servants}} like this. Not only have we had to eat a filthy dinner, but it's enough to make people suspicious, eh? Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> so? Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> afterwards <b>that</b> <b>they</b> may wonder why we did it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He is {{very fond}} of your brother, and I suppose men friends do listen to each other. They never seem to listen to women. Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> after all, <b>they</b> despise women? They look on them as dainty, foolish things." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, Dr Thorne, {{there is}} no man on God's earth who knows my affairs {{as well as you}} do; and in knowing mine, you know Frank's. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> it {{possible}} <b>that</b> <b>they</b> should marry each other?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As if {{we should}} wait to be starved," [...] another of the {{students}} said scoffingly. [...] "If the time comes when there's nothing to eat, we would set Paris on fire and hurl ourselves every man upon the Germans, and fight our way through. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could block every road round Paris?" ...|$|E
60|$|She looked {{straight}} at him, pure of soul, simple of heart, with a passion of tenderness and self-abnegation as yet dormant beneath the outer crust of a conventional education and of commonplace surroundings, but with the passion there nevertheless. And it was expressed in the sudden, strange luminosity of her eyes--I would not have <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were tears--as they met and held his own.|$|E
60|$|Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were {{an artistic}} people? Take them {{even at the}} time of their highest artistic development, the latter part of the fifth century before Christ, when they had the {{greatest}} poets and the greatest artists of the antique world, when the Parthenon rose in loveliness at the bidding of a Phidias, and the philosopher spake of wisdom in the shadow of the painted portico, and tragedy swept in the perfection of pageant and pathos across the marble of the stage. Were they an artistic people then? Not a bit of it. What is an artistic people but a people who love their artists and understand their art? The Athenians could do neither.|$|E
6000|$|... "There is a star," [...] {{continued}} Lawton, still bent {{on his own}} ideas, [...] "struggling to glitter {{through a}} few driving clouds; perhaps that too is a world, and contains its creatures endowed with reason like ourselves. <b>Think</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> know of war and bloodshed?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't like it," [...] she said. [...] "And don't you see," [...] she added, with animation, [...] "what an {{advantage}} I possess in having determined never to marry? Very few other girls {{would be willing}} to speak to you so plainly. They would be afraid <b>you</b> would <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> wanted <b>you,</b> but, as I don't want anybody, you and I can talk over things of this kind like free and equal human beings. So I will say again that I don't like your affection for Mrs. Chester. It disappoints me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Thinkest thou,' he says, 'that those Galilaeans whose blood Pilate {{mingled with}} their sacrifices, were sinners {{above all the}} Galilaeans? Or those eighteen, on whom the tower in Siloam fell, and killed them; <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were sinners above all who dwelt in Jerusalem? I tell you nay.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We shall get {{in without}} fighting," [...] the Bey said. [...] "We should have heard before this, {{had they been}} there. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would have {{remained}} so long in the town, if they had learned that there are but two hundred of us, and one steamer? Mahmud would never have forgiven them, had they not fallen upon us and annihilated us. I only hope that two hundred will have been left there. It will add to our glory, to have won a battle, as well as taken the town. Your children will talk of it in their tents. Your women will be proud of you, and {{the men of the}} black regiments will say that we have shown ourselves to be as brave as they are.|$|E
6000|$|... "But you," [...] exclaims Cobbett [Letter to Mr. Western (Weekly Register, November 23, 1822)], [...] "what can induce you to stickle for the Pitt system [i.e. paper-money]? I {{will tell}} you what it is: you loved the high prices, and the {{domination}} that they gave you.... Besides this, you think that the boroughs can be preserved by a return to paper-money, and along with them the hare-and-pheasant law and justice. You loved the glorious times of paper-money, and you want them back again. <b>You</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could go on for ever.... The bill of 1819 was really a great relaxation of the Pitt system, and when you are crying out spoliation and confiscation, when you are bawling out so lustily about the robbery committed on you by the fund-holders and the placemen, and are praising the infernal Pitt system at the same time, ... you say they are receiving, the fund-vagabonds in particular, more than they ought." [...] It is evident that Byron's verse is a reverberation of Cobbett's prose.] ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{it was of}} no use. [...] "Dispense {{with them}} altogether," [...] he said, looking her full in the face. [...] "The twenty will not quarrel with you. My object is to marry you, and I don't care twopence for the bridesmaids." [...] There was {{something}} so near to a compliment in this, that she was obliged to accept it. And she had, too, begun to perceive that Lord Llwddythlw was a man not easily made to change his mind. She was quite prepared for this in reference to her future life. A woman, she thought, might be saved much trouble by having a husband whom she was bound to obey. But in this matter of her marriage ceremony,--this last affair in which she might be presumed {{to act as a}} free woman,--she did think it hard that she might not be allowed to have her own way. The bridegroom, however, was firm. If Thursday, the 13th, did not suit her, he would be quite ready on Thursday, the 20th. [...] "There wouldn't be one of them left in London," [...] said Lady Amaldina. [...] "What on earth do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are to do with themselves?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your news is not good; it is bad," [...] he said, {{with more}} energy than he had {{hitherto}} shown. [...] "It were better had he died in battle than be shot in cold blood. <b>Think</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> will spare any whom they caught in arms against them?" ...|$|R
60|$|But, be {{the weather}} fair or foul, a ship is {{generally}} quick {{to leave the}} company of so dangerous a neighbor as an iceberg. Sometimes great masses of ice take a notion to topple over, and, looking at the matter in what light <b>you</b> please, I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{are not to be}} trusted.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is wonderful!" [...] his {{companion}} replied. [...] "How huge they are, what lines of cannon, what great masts, as tall and {{as straight as}} palm-trees! Truly you Franks know many things of which we in the desert are ignorant. <b>Think</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could batter these forts to pieces?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How do I live when I {{am on the}} tramp?" [...] he said, [...] "well, {{there are}} the consuls. The system is not delicate, but when it's a {{question}} of starving, much is permissible; besides, these gentlemen were created for the purpose. There's a coterie of German Jews in Paris living entirely upon consuls." [...] He hesitated for the fraction of a second, and resumed: [...] "Yes, monsieur; if you have papers that fit you, you can try six or seven consuls in a single town. You must know a language or two; {{but most of these}} gentlemen are not too well up in the tongues of the country they represent. Obtaining money under false pretences? Well, it is. But what's the difference at bottom between all this honourable crowd of directors, fashionable physicians, employers of labour, ferry-builders, military men, country priests, and consuls themselves perhaps, who take money and give no value for it, and poor devils who do the same at far greater risk? Necessity makes the law. If those gentlemen were in my position, do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would hesitate?" ...|$|E
6000|$|And {{not only}} in the {{material}} and in the course, but yet more earnestly in the spirit of it, let a girl's education be as serious as a boy's. You bring up your girls as if they were meant for sideboard ornaments, and then complain of their frivolity. Give them the same advantages that you give their brothers--appeal to the same grand instincts of virtue in them; teach THEM, also, that courage and truth are the pillars of their being:- do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would not answer that appeal, brave and true as they are even now, when you know that there is hardly a girls' school in this Christian kingdom where the children's courage or sincerity would be thought of half so much importance as their way of coming in at a door; and when the whole system of society, as respects the mode of establishing them in life, is one rotten plague of cowardice and imposture--cowardice, in not daring to let them live, or love, except as their neighbours choose; and imposture, in bringing, for the purposes of our own pride, the full glow of the world's worst vanity upon a girl's eyes, at the very period when the whole happiness of her future existence depends upon her remaining undazzled? ...|$|E
60|$|The {{water is}} so {{transparent}} {{that the bottom}} can easily be discerned at the depth of twenty-five or thirty feet. Paddling over it, you may see, many feet beneath the surface, the schools of perch and shiners, perhaps only an inch long, yet the former easily distinguished by their transverse bars, and <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> must be ascetic fish that find a subsistence there. Once, in the winter, many years ago, when I had been cutting holes through the ice in order to catch pickerel, as I stepped ashore I tossed my axe back on to the ice, but, as if some evil genius had directed it, it slid four or five rods directly {{into one of the}} holes, where the water was twenty-five feet deep. Out of curiosity, I lay down on the ice and looked through the hole, until I saw the axe a little on one side, standing on its head, with its helve erect and gently swaying to and fro with the pulse of the pond; and there it might have stood erect and swaying till in the course of time the handle rotted off, if I had not disturbed it. Making another hole directly over it with an ice chisel which I had, and cutting down the longest birch which I could find in the neighborhood with my knife, I made a slip-noose, which I attached to its end, and, letting it down carefully, passed it over the knob of the handle, and drew it by a line along the birch, and so pulled the axe out again.|$|E
5000|$|His career {{took off}} after joining Atlantic Records in 1969 where he {{quickly became a}} world-renowned {{engineer}} and producer. [...] "The people there, like Tom Dowd, Arif Mardin, Joel Dorn, Ahmet Ertegun, they were all gentle people. <b>You</b> would <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were all superstars, but <b>they</b> never acted <b>that</b> way. Being at Atlantic was like being welcomed into someone's house. It was a house of music. You never knew {{who was going to}} come in, one day Aretha Franklin, the next The Modern Jazz Quartet, King Curtis, Gladys Knight. ... It was truthfully hard to go home at night." ...|$|R
6000|$|So {{much for}} the more civilized apple-trees (urbaniores, as Pliny calls them). I love better {{to go through the}} old {{orchards}} of ungrafted apple-trees, at whatever season of the year,--so irregularly planted: sometimes two trees standing close together; and the rows so devious <b>that</b> <b>you</b> would <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> not only had grown while the owner was sleeping, but had been set out by him in a somnambulic state. The rows of grafted fruit will never tempt me to wander amid them like these. But I now, alas, speak rather from memory than from any recent experience, such ravages have been made! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He <b>thinks</b> as <b>you</b> do, lady, {{although}} he considers {{that for the}} time the danger is averted. He himself said to me yesterday, 'If these Mercian earls are ready to defy {{the head of the}} royal line of England, <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> will ever recognize the sway of a member of my father's house?'" ...|$|R
