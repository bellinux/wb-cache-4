2500|$|Jindal's {{nickname}} {{dates to}} his childhood identification with Bobby Brady, an ABC sitcom character. He has said, [...] "Every day after school, I'd {{come home and}} I'd watch The Brady Bunch. And I identified with Bobby, <b>you</b> <b>know?</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> about my age, and 'Bobby' stuck."

Doo was my security, my safety net". He was also known to be violent, an alcoholic, and a womanizer who was a somewhat reluctant participant in his wife's life as a country music celebrity. Nonetheless, he was a central figure in many of his wife's hits, including [...] "Fist City", [...] "The Pill", [...] "Don't Come Home A-Drinkin' (With Lovin' On Your Mind)", and [...] "You Ain't Woman Enough (To Take My Man)". Loretta said, [...] "Doo really gave me {{a lot of things to}} write about, <b>you</b> <b>know.</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> very...what do you call it? Inspirational".|$|E
2500|$|Although Nick {{is only a}} semi-regular character, his {{intermittent}} appearances {{were always}} scripted {{to make a big}} impact on the show, as well as all the characters involved in his storylines. He reappeared and left several times during {{the first few years of}} the show, causing maximum havoc every time, and it wasn't long before the tabloids had begun to brand the character [...] "Nasty Nick". Altman has commented: [...] "I think they keep bringing Nick back because he's one of the characters on British TV that people just love to hate". This dislike of the character by the public was shared by the fictional residents of Walford, with Altman explaining: [...] "Every time he comes back he gets shunned by one and all. It's like being the bad cowboy come riding into town - everybody puts down the shutters and locks up the bar." [...] The character's appearance was tailored to suit this unlikable, [...] "nasty" [...] image, with EastEnders series consultant Simon Ashdown commenting; [...] "When he comes on, you know this guy is bad. He's got the black hair and the scowl and the leather jacket. He is like that, he is a Dickensian baddy." [...] Frankie Fitzgerald, who played Nick's son Ashley Cotton from 2000 to 2001, agreed: [...] "The look of Nasty Nick, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a bad guy. Even when he gets dressed up in a suit, he's still got the earring, he's still got the rings, he's still got the tattoo on his neck." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Didn't <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> married?" [...] asked Miss Klegg, and {{was struck}} by a thought that made her glance quickly at her companion.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{understand}} all that; {{but how about}} this geologian? Will he not tell your wife? <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a great admirer of hers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Well! And {{suppose he}} has become morally disintegrated. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not a strong personality,” the {{professor}} suggested moodily. “My daughter’s future is in question here.” ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Why has not Kew {{come to see}} me? When did he come? Write him a note, {{and send}} for him instantly, Julia. Did <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> here?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Didn't <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{going to}} put on a revue? Oh, rather. A whacking big affair. Going to cut out the Follies and all that sort of thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Whist, Meg! How {{can you go}} on that way?" [...] said Anty, {{interrupting}} her, and blushing. [...] "I'll {{not stop}} in the room; don't <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> dhrunk when he done all that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I see," [...] said Mr. Layard; [...] "but I {{should have}} thought that was Mary Porson's job. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> engaged to her, don't you?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I didn't mean that," [...] she {{hastened to}} explain. [...] "I didn't {{mean that you}} must {{necessarily}} dress like them; but BE like them--act like them--talk like them, as Mr. Theriere did, <b>you</b> <b>know.</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> a gentleman." ...|$|E
