These things you saw, Randolph Carter, when your nurse first wheeled <b>you</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the springtime, and they will be the last things you will ever see with eyes of memory and of love." [...] This mysterious man then reveals his identityhe is Nyarlathotep, the Crawling Chaos, the emissary of the Other Gods who dwell in the blackness of space.|$|E
