6000|$|... 'I am awfully stupid,' Lawford murmured, 'but {{even now}} I don't really follow you a bit. But when, as <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> become {{articulate}} to yourself, what happens then?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not understand," [...] Ernest replied. [...] "The metaphysician reasons deductively {{out of his}} own subjectivity. The {{scientist}} reasons inductively {{from the}} facts of experience. The metaphysician reasons from theory to facts, the scientist reasons from facts to theory. The metaphysician explains the universe by himself, the scientist explains himself by the universe." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You do not know!" [...] said Butler, {{stepping}} impatiently {{through the}} apartment--"You purpose {{to meet a}} young man whom you do not know, at such a time, and in a place so lonely--you say you are compelled to do this--and yet <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not know the person who exercises such an influence over you!--Jeanie, what am I to think of this?" ...|$|E
60|$|STRAPPER. I <b>dont</b> believe <b>you</b> started not for {{two hours}} after <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>did.</b>|$|R
60|$|INSPECTOR. Then why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>did?</b> There's been a theft here, and {{anything}} <b>you</b> <b>say</b> {{may be used}} against you.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wish you}} could, Francis, but I {{do not see}} any escape for it, {{especially}} as <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not recognize Ruggiero as the passenger you carried." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do try {{and keep}} your {{attention}} fixed, George," [...] I heard her say severely. [...] "To allow it to wander when high spiritual affairs are under discussion (sneeze) is scarcely reverent. Could you tell the man to shut that door? The draught is dreadful. It is quite impossible for you to agree with both of us, as <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> seeing that metaphorically Dr. Jeffreys is at one pole and I am at the other." [...] (Sneeze.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am grieved, believe me," [...] {{she said}} coldly, [...] "if I seem unkind ... {{but you must}} see for yourself, good master, that we cannot go on as we are doing now.... Whenever I go out, you follow me ... when I return I find you waiting for me.... I have {{endeavored}} to think kindly of your actions, but if you value my friendship, as <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> you will let me go my way in peace." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, not that," [...] she returned. [...] "But {{it is so}} very {{difficult}} for us to conceive of a whole nation living, as <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> on the same terms as one family, and no one trying to get ahead of another, or richer, and having neither inferiors nor superiors, but just one dead level of equality, where there is no distinction except by natural gifts and good deeds or beautiful works. It seems impossible--it seems ridiculous." ...|$|E
6000|$|SNOW. You were at {{the house}} this morning; <b>you</b> <b>did</b> the room in which the box was left; you {{were alone in the}} room. I find the box 'ere. <b>You</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> n't take it? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I could. But {{he should}} not drive me from him, as <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> her; never--never--never. He might kill me if he would; but if I once {{had told him that}} I loved him, I would never leave him afterwards." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What!" [...] {{cried the}} old woman. She came up near, and peering at her daughter, {{repeated}} three times: [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>say?</b> What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>say?</b> What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> say?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You do {{yourself}} no good, Master Lambert, by talking thus {{to me of}} the man I love and honor beyond all things in this world. You are blind and see not things as they are: blind to the merits of one who is as infinitely above you as the stars. But nathless I waste my breath again.... I have no power to convince you of the grievous error which you commit. But if you cared for me, as <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> ..." ...|$|E
6000|$|A long, {{long way}} off, {{in a land}} where water is very scarce, there lived {{a man and his}} wife and several children. One day the wife said to her husband, 'I am pining to have the liver of a nyamatsane for my dinner. If you love me as much as <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> you will go out and hunt for a nyamatsane, and will kill it and get its liver. If not, I shall know that your love is not worth having.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No reprieve, no reprieve! Nobody comes near us. There's {{only the}} night left now!' moaned Dennis faintly, as he wrung his hands. 'Do you think they'll reprieve {{me in the}} night, brother? I've known reprieves come in the night, afore now. I've known 'em come as late as five, six, and seven o'clock in the morning. Don't you think there's a good chance yet,--don't <b>you?</b> <b>Say</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> Say you do, young man,' whined the miserable creature, with an imploring gesture towards Barnaby, 'or I shall go mad!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No;--no; no; I never {{laughed at}} you. How could I laugh {{when you were}} {{all the world to}} me? Ask Frank;--he knew. Ask Miss Cass;--she knew. And can <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not know; <b>you,</b> you, you yourself? Can any girl suppose that such words as these are to mean nothing when they have been spoken? You knew I loved you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are alone," [...] he went on. [...] "Nothing {{can help}} you. Nobody will. You are neither white nor brown. You have no colour {{as you have}} no heart. Your accomplices have {{abandoned}} you to me because I am still somebody to be reckoned with. You are alone but for that woman there. <b>You</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> this for her. Well, you have her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is so {{like a man}} and {{so unlike}} a woman. What did he say? What did he do? How did he look? What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>say?</b> What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>do?</b> How <b>did</b> <b>you</b> look?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No harm will come--to you, friend Peter; and I {{have been}} so long cooped in an inn that I, who am desert-born, wish for a gallop on the {{mountains}} with a good horse beneath me and a brave knight in front. Listen, you brethren; <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not fear; then leave your bridles loose, and where'er we go and whate'er we meet seek not to check or turn the horses Flame and Smoke. Now, Son of the Sand, we will test these nags of which you sing so loud a song. Away, and let the ride be fast and far!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do not hate you, Constance," [...] said Fan, {{recovering}} {{her usual}} tone, but still speaking with a tremor in her voice. [...] "Why {{do you say}} that?--it is a cruel thing to say. Do you not {{know that it is}} false? I shall never blame you for what has happened. You are not to blame. I have lost Mary, but she is not what <b>you</b> <b>say.</b> <b>You</b> <b>do</b> not know her--what right have you to call her bad names? I would go away this moment and never see you again rather than hear you talk in that way of her, much as I love you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My children, {{never forget}} this. You are not pale-faces, {{to say one}} thing and do another. What <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> When you make a law, you keep it. That is right. No red-man wants another's wigwam. If he wants a wigwam, he builds one himself. It is not so with the pale-faces. The man who has no wigwam tries to get away his neighbor's. While he does this, he reads in his Bible and goes to his church. I have {{sometimes}} thought, the more he reads and prays, the more he tries to get into his neighbor's wigwam. So it seems to an Indian, {{but it may not be}} so.|$|E
6000|$|... 'There is {{only one}} point which tells in your favour. You have not {{attempted}} concealment.' (Pringle nudged Lorimer surreptitiously at this.) 'And I may add that I believe that, as <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not desire actually to win the prize by underhand means. But I cannot overlook such an offence. It is serious. Most serious. You will, both of you, go into extra lesson for the remaining Saturdays of the term.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well--no great merit, Pen, as {{you will}} put it," [...] says the Confessor; [...] "but it was kindly thought, sir--and I like my husband when he is kind best; and don't wonder at your having made a stupid speech at the dinner, as <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>did,</b> when <b>you</b> had this other subject to think of. That is a {{beautiful}} psalm, Pen, and those verses which you were reading when you saw him, especially beautiful." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; {{of course}} not. I shouldn't care to hear <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>did.</b> He's a likely lad, and he's a Christian, {{which is more}} than these folk here, in spite o' all their praying and preaching. There's a party {{starting}} for Nevada to-morrow, and I'll manage to send him a message letting him know the hole we are in. If I know anything o' that young man, he'll be back here with a speed that would whip electro-telegraphs." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now you are reasonable," [...] {{returned}} the merchant, [...] "for you talk {{of what you}} do know, and you admit that in regard to God you `don't know,' but you began by stating that `there is no God.' Ah, my friend, I sympathise with you in your terrible sorrow, even as you have sympathised with me in mine, but don't let us give way to despair and cast the only Refuge that remains to us behind our backs. I will not ask you to join me in praying to One, in whom <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not believe, but I will pray for you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah so!" [...] she said, with {{a slight}} shrug of her shoulders. [...] "Then I must tell you. <b>You</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not know the Grand Duke and Duchess. Well! THEY KNOW YOU. The day before {{yesterday}} you were wandering in the park, as you admit. You say, also, you got through the hedge and interrupted some ceremony. That ceremony was not a Court function, Mr. Hoffman, but something equally sacred--the photographing of the Ducal family before the Schloss. You say that you instantly withdrew. But after the photograph was taken the plate revealed a stranger standing actually {{by the side of}} the Princess Alexandrine, and even taking the PAS of the Grand Duke himself. That stranger was you!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{not saying}} it in fun. Of course, it's none of my business, but you have paid me the {{compliment}} of confiding in me about Amelia, and I feel justified in speaking. All I can say is that, if you cherish her memory as <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> you show {{it in a very}} strange way. How you can square your neglect of Percy with your alleged devotion to Amelia's memory, beats me. It {{seems to me that you}} have no choice. You must either drop the whole thing and admit that your love for her is dead, or else you must stop this infernal treatment of her favorite brother. You can't have it both ways." ...|$|E
50|$|What <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> or what <b>you</b> <b>do.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{you don't}} {{remember}} me!" [...] she chattered. [...] "And don't <b>you</b> dare <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>do!</b> If there weren't so many looking, I'd hug you, you old bear! ...|$|R
6000|$|Her uncle smiled, {{as if she}} {{had said}} {{something}} peculiarly acceptable to him, and asked, hesitatingly, [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> never <b>did,</b> <b>you</b> know, what is the full phrase?" ...|$|R
6000|$|But when Zinita, {{his head}} wife, came {{to hear of}} the matter she was angry, and upbraided Umslopogaas, and heaped curses on me, Mopo, whom she knew only as the mouth of Dingaan, because, as she said truly, I had put this scheme {{into the mind of}} the Slaughterer. [...] "What!" [...] she went on, [...] "do you not live here in peace and plenty, and must you go to make war on those who have not harmed you; there, perhaps, to perish or to come to other ill? <b>You</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> this to win a girl for Dingaan and to find favour in his sight. Has not Dingaan girls more than he can count? It is more likely that, wearying of us, your wives, you go to get girls for yourself, Bulalio; and as for finding favour, rest quiet, so shall you find most favour. If the king sends his impis against you, then it will be time to fight, O fool with little wit!" ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{could not}} bring herself to be as {{explicit}} as she should have been, {{but he was not}} far from understanding her real meaning, as he brokenly replied: [...] "I've been afraid of this, my girl. I've thought of it all. The money I spend fer ye is but a small part of my debt. <b>You</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> nothing for me. Why, darlin', every time you come into the room or smile at me you do much for me! I'm a selfish old wolf, but I'm not so bad as you think I am. If anny nice young felly comes along--a good square man--I'll get off the track; but I want you to let me stay near you as long as I live." [...] His voice was hoarse with pleading. [...] "Ye're all I have in the world; all I live for now is to make you happy. Don't pull away now, when me old heart has grown all round ye. I can't live and I daren't die without ye--now that's the eternal truth. Darlin', promise ye won't go--yet awhile." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I read on in {{your letter}} till I came to [...] "Dear Coley, {{it is very hard}} to live without you,"--and I broke down and cried like a child. I was quite alone out in the fields on a glorious bright day, and it was the relief I had longed for. The few simple words told me the whole story, and I prayed with my whole heart that you might find {{strength}} in the hour of sadness. Do (as <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>do)</b> let your natural feelings work; do not force yourself to appear calm, do not get excited if you can help it; but if your mind is oppressed with the thought of my absence, do not try to drive it away by talking about something else, or taking up a book, etc.; follow it out, see what it ends in, trace out the spiritual help and comfort which have already, it may be, resulted from it, the growth of dependence upon God above; meditate upon the real idea of separation, and think of Mamma and Uncle Frank.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Certainly, I know no {{more than}} you and others know--it was a {{gratuitous}} unpleasantness in <b>you</b> to <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not doubt me. Why should you, or anybody, have doubted me?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, say half-an-hour; {{the rest}} of the time you were really in the picture gallery, but it is {{scarcely}} likely that, even if the man who took your money at the door or the attendant inside noticed you sufficiently to swear to your face, they would be able to fix the day, still less have noticed how long you stayed. At any rate it is clear that it would be possible for <b>you</b> to have <b>done</b> all <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> that afternoon and still to have spared time for that visit to Gilliat's.' ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{had listened}} eagerly, as I say; {{and it was}} her nature to {{understand}} quickly. [...] "I wonder if <b>you</b> appreciate what <b>you</b> <b>say.</b> If <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> <b>you</b> take a great responsibility." ...|$|R
