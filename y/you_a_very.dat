He concludes, [...] " [...] combination of a tight, talented band and a tortured frontman doesn't necessarily make Falling in Reverse a revelatory band, but is does make The Drug in Me Is <b>You</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> solid album." [...] Molly Walter of The University Leader felt the album was an attempt to recreate Escape the Fate prior to Radke's departure and noted that [...] "he fell short big time", calling the album's music [...] "out of date and overdone". Walter did comment on Radke's singing but felt the lyrical content was conceited, concluding the review saying, [...] "Face it, Ronnie, you did not magically turn tragedy into melody. You’re just not king of the music scene." [...] The [...] Jam! gives 3.5/5 stars to The Drug in Me Is You and said, [...] "In a world of poseurs, Ronnie Radke is the real deal. The lewd, crude and tattooed punk has survived jail, rehab and being turfed from Escape the Fate. Now he’s on the loose and up to no good with a new band — and a CD of post-hardcore anthems that render his foul-mouthed tales of sex, drugs and rock ’n’ roll with a mix of metalcore power and pop-punk melody. Lock up everything." ...|$|E

The official added, [...] "Be careful. I can confirm to <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> early investigation. But I want to caution you not to chop this guy's (Renzi's) head off." ...|$|E
