500|$|During {{the shoot}} {{of the music}} video for [...] "First" [...] (2005), Lohan {{revealed}} {{in an interview with}} MTV that she was preparing her sophomore studio album. [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> studio, everything just comes out," [...] she said. [...] "All your creative juices are there. I don't [...] leave. I'll still be in there until all hours, and it's {{nice to be able to}} do that." [...] Lohan began writing lyrics for the album in June 2005, after the last single from her previous album had been released. [...] "I've been writing a lot, almost every night," [...] she said. [...] "There's been a lot going on , and I think people can find that escape in hobbies that they do. I don't do yoga or anything, but some people use that. Everyone has their own thing, and I use writing." [...] Initially titled There's Only One Angel In Heaven, the pop rock album features a darker theme when compared to Lohan's previous album, Speak (2004).|$|E

But if, as I hope, and as what you write indicates, you bear the fire in your belly, it will survive and transfigure the hard facts." ...|$|E

Weezie 's response? 'They’re going to hang us whichever way we go. Let's commit the murder.' I argued {{it was a joke}} and a monstrously bad idea but, given my departure following 175 was set prior to beginning my run, my vote didn’t count. So I did what I could with what I had left... So we went with the Mohawk...But once <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> whole leather and stud thing it was a bad joke that got way out of hand." ...|$|E

2500|$|Due to the Game Pak's space limitations, {{full motion}} video {{is not usually}} {{feasible}} for use in cutscenes. A notable exception is Resident Evil 2, which contains the equivalent material of the two CD-ROM discs of the original PlayStation version, plus some expanded content, plus higher quality audio samples and unique surround sound technology, making it what IGN calls [...] "the best version of the game". Some games contain significant cinematic scenes whose graphics are generated by the system in real-time, as with [...] Nintendo downplayed the importance of studio-prerendered videos, with software engineering manager Jim Merrick saying, [...] "Full-motion video demos really well on a CD-ROM, but once <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> software, as a gamer, you're thinking 'let's {{get on with the}} game.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the final}} game of the month Vancouver played the Rangers and former coach Alain Vigneault. Daniel Sedin said of the game: [...] "I know our former coach is over there, but once <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> game you're not going to think too much about it. He was with us for seven years and he meant a lot to this franchise, so it's going to be fun seeing him again but once the game gets going we want the two points, and so does he". Tortarella stated: [...] "I'm not going to lie, it's a little weird for me coming back, but once the game starts, it's about playing and {{trying to find a way}} to get a win". The Canucks lost the game 5–2, {{finishing}} the month with 31 points, four points out of the final playoff spot.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2016, Kreisberg {{revealed}} that the Dominators would appear on Supergirl [...] "later this season" [...] after the crossover event. Guggenheim also {{revealed that}} the initial script for The Flash would have seen Lynda Carter appear as the Vice President, becoming the President {{after his death in}} the episode (Carter appears as President Olivia Marsdin on Supergirl). This did not occur, due to a note from the studio, [...] "which was that it was a bit too confusing. <b>You</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> parallel Earths of it all but she's not the President on our Earth but the Vice President. In the midst of time travel and aliens, it was just one sci-fi problem too much." [...] On this, Guggenheim noted [...] "he understood the note and conceded that if people at the studio were confused by the script, it was probably not particularly friendly to casual fans." ...|$|E

War resumed in May. Fitzwilliam wrote to Laurence on 14 August on the Volunteer system: [...] "All the higher orders, particularly when <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> manufacturing district, tremble at the thought of arms being put {{into the hands of the}} people indiscriminately...having none in authority over them, at least, not such as ought to be". He instead advocated volunteers in regiments where [...] "we are sure at least of having proper commanders". On the recent coming together of Pitt, Fox and Windham he said: [...] "It is that sort of junction, which I feel to be necessary for the security of the country in these times, and in all for the maintenance of the Constitution in its true spirit". On 6 December he wrote to Lady Rockingham: ...|$|E

Like the new version of who we are [...]" [...] Lyrically, [...] "Departed" [...] chronicle a woman's talks about mutual support with loved ones. Recorded with therapeutical background, Norwood has noted the fatal 2006 car accident, in which she was involved, as a reason for its inclusion on the album. [...] "To know that you have somebody by your side who is gonna always be there for you, that comforts you in a way and that kinda gives you an extra confidence about yourself," [...] she said, [...] "And that's what I love about it: It's first the message and than <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> beat and the whole musical part of it.

I showed [...] some references from the classic rebellious zones of the world. We live in very orderly society in America, but when you get into Brazil, <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Middle East, you get into Africa, you get into Eastern Europe, when you get into places like that, there's a different sort of 'we run this town' [...] There's less order and more chaos. So we looked at a lot of those references, new photos and historical photos, to capture that kind of falling-apart feeling." [...] "We wanted you to feel uneasy throughout the piece," [...] he said. [...] "We wanted there to be a constant layer of tension through the piece. Even in the way I shot — where the camera comes by Jay, it doesn't stop on him, it goes to Rihanna — there's kind of this chaos of revealing and covering and concealing. And things happen offscreen that you don't see. I think people are really gonna flip on this".|$|E

2500|$|Juri has {{a number}} of special {{technique}}s; all of which utilize quarter-circle, shoryuken, and similar motions. These include a quick flip kick, a dive kick, and a technique called Fuhajin kick, which allows fireballs to be fired from her feet. These fireballs can be controlled by the strength of the kick input; depending on it, the fireballs will travel at different angles. Players may also store fireballs by holding down the kick button. 1UP.com editor Richard Li compared this mechanic to Gilgamesh's from Fate/Unlimited codes. Players may store three sets of fireballs by holding three buttons to charge them, choosing to release them in tandem or one-by-one. GamesRadar editor Brett Elston commented that while her dive kick was [...] "so much fun that it’s almost irresistible," [...] it [...] "shouldn't be your first choice every time <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> air." [...] He adds that the move is so overused by Juri players that players can beat them without attacking. Juri's special attacks include the Senpusha wheel kick and the Shikusen triple air kick. Her ultra attacks include the Feng Shui Engine, which allows her normal attacks to chain upwards for a short time; and the Kaisen Dankairaku. In one of her ultra moves, she was intended to kiss the opponent's cheek, but this was toned down. Okada commented that other ideas were so extreme that the game would have needed a higher content rating. She also has a pinwheel kick attack, which acts as an [...] "offensive chip damage" [...] attack. In discussing the pinwheel kick, developer Tamamura commented that females in fighting games typically have attacks with several hits to them, describing this move {{as an example of how}} she likes to show off. A dodge technique was implemented as a means of reflecting her personality, with developer Okada stating that it is a move that [...] "puts her opponent off balance." [...] He goes on to describe her as [...] "one of the fastest and trickiest characters in Street Fighter history." ...|$|E
