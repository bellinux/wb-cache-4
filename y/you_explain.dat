My algebra teacher insists that the probability is greater that the man has two boys, but I think the chances may be the same. What do you think? ...|$|E
2500|$|Bruner {{has said}} that school shootings in the United States occur because {{students}} are being taught the science of evolution. Bruner wrote that [...] "Evolution is a religious philosophy with propaganda supporting the religion of Atheism". Like other Young Earth creationists, Bruner believes dinosaurs and mankind walked the Earth at the same time; Bruner also believes that scientists found proof of a young Earth but have colluded to hide the evidence. Bruner wrote: [...] "The dinosaurs on the ark may have been babies and not able to reproduce. It might make sense to take the small dinosaurs onto the ark instead of the ones bigger than a bus. After the flood, the few remaining Behemoths and Leviathans may have become extinct because {{there was not enough}} vegetation on earth for them to survive to reproductive age... When the flood waters subsided and rushed into the oceans, there was no vegetation on the earth because the earth had been covered with water." [...] A television reporter asked Bruner on-camera to clarify her beliefs concerning the biblical account of Noah's Ark and whether it was filled with pairs of animals and if the entire world was covered with water. Bruner later wrote, [...] "THE ANSWER IS STILL YES, I believe the Holy Bible. I believe there was a Great Flood. How do <b>YOU</b> <b>explain</b> fossils of seashells and other sea animals on tops of mountains all over the world? How do <b>you</b> <b>explain</b> the Grand Canyon? You are very naive if you believe a tiny river carved out the Grand Canyon. I believe it took a lot more water than that to carve out the Grand Canyon and other land and rock formations formed by water erosion. You can call me ignorant or intolerant or whatever you want, but I did not make fun of YOUR religion." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pause and probe is {{the skill}} of the {{moderator}} to give each participant a chance to jump in. As a general rule, a moderator should pause {{for at least five}} seconds after a participant talks or before beginning to talk. Probes, such as [...] "would <b>you</b> <b>explain</b> that further?" [...] or [...] "Would you give me an example?" [...] help to give additional information. Being prepared for the unexpected is one of the abilities of the focus group leaders in order for the efficient functioning of the groups. Some examples of unexpected events are no one showing up (make sure you bring list and phone numbers), only a few showing up (hold group anyway), meeting place is inadequate for the members to reach, the group members get too involved and don't want to leave (have formal ending), bad or hazardous weather (call everyone and cancel). Organization Skills helps focus group leaders to plan the theme for group discussions and also develop a printed outline for the meetings. There may be more productive discussions when every member of the focus group has a copy of the printed agenda before starting the discussion. This allows the member to have some time to review the topics and focus on key relevant issues. The leader should use the counseling skills in order for the discussion to take place effectively.|$|E

2500|$|Despite Ridge and Taylor's remarriage, Brooke {{continues}} her {{attempts at}} winning Ridge back. Stephanie encourages Taylor to see Brooke's intent, with Tylo observing: [...] "It was so obvious {{she was going}} after Ridge. How can <b>you</b> <b>explain</b> away that she always kept ending up in the elevator in her bra and underwear over and over again? Stephanie’s whole mission was to get Taylor to smell the coffee and [...] that not everybody has as altruistic an agenda as she does." [...] Ridge and Taylor's twins, Stephanie ("Steffy") and Phoebe, are born in 1999. During the pregnancy Taylor experiences tuberculosis after interacting {{with a man who}} has it. Her pregnancy becomes high risk and she refuses treatment to protect the babies. Tylo said that this was [...] "a great way to bring awareness about the disease and the threat it poses to pregnant women". When Taylor dies in 2002, supervising producer Rhonda Friedman noted that Ridge refuses to accept the [...] "horrible reality", saying: [...] "He begs Taylor to come back to him. He just doesn't want to let go of this woman who he has loved for so many years, someone he say himself growing old with." [...] Devin Owens of Soap Opera Digest called Taylor Ridge's soulmate.

2500|$|In April 2006 {{and again}} in December 2007, Binoche {{travelled}} to Tehran {{at the invitation of}} Abbas Kiarostami. While there in 2007, she shot a cameo appearance in his film Shirin (2008) which he was shooting at the time. Binoche's visit proved controversial when two Iranian MPs raised the matter in parliament, advising more caution be exercised in granting visas to foreign celebrities which might lead to [...] "cultural destruction". In June 2009 Binoche began work on Certified Copy directed by Kiarostami. The film was an Official Selection in competition at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival. Binoche won the Best Actress Award at the festival for her performance. The film went on general release in France on 19 May 2010 to very positive reviews. Her win at the 2010 Cannes Film festival makes Binoche the first actress to win the European [...] "best actress triple crown": Best Actress at Venice for Three Colors: Blue, Best Actress at Berlin for The English Patient and Best Actress at Cannes for Certified Copy. The September 2010 UK release of the film was overshadowed when French actor Gérard Depardieu made disparaging comments about Binoche to the Austrian magazine Profil, [...] "Please can <b>you</b> <b>explain</b> to me what the mystery of Juliette Binoche is meant to be?" [...] he said. [...] "I would really like to know why she has been so esteemed for so many years. She has nothing – absolutely nothing". In response, while promoting Certified Copy, Binoche spoke to movie magazine Empire saying, [...] "I don't know him. I understand you don't have to like everyone and you can dislike someone's work. But I don't understand the violence ... I do not understand why he is behaving like this. It is his problem." [...] Certified Copy proved to be controversial in Kiarostami's homeland when Iranian authorities announced on 27 May 2010 that the film was to be banned in Iran, apparently due to Binoche's attire; Deputy Culture Minister Javad Shamaqdari is quoted as saying, [...] "If Juliette Binoche were better clad it could have been screened but due to her attire {{there will not be a}} general screening." ...|$|E
