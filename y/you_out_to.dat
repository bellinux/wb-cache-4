2500|$|Tattoos is {{the third}} studio album by American singer Jason Derulo. The album was {{released}} on September 20, 2013 through Beluga Heights Records and Atlantic Records and its affiliated record labels.

It's important when someone thinks they've figured <b>you</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> flip them".
