60|$|I couldn't {{believe a}} word <b>you</b> <b>said.</b> <b>You</b> <b>did</b> {{everything}} you shouldn't have done. The {{result was that}} the men mutinied, and if I hadn't {{come back in the}} nick of time they'd have killed you and looted all the stores.|$|E

6000|$|... "By the way," [...] {{interrupted}} Dominick, [...] "have {{you tried}} to climb our signal-tree, as <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> would <b>do,</b> to replace the flag that was blown away by last night's gale?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, well, (said he) we {{will not}} dispute about HIS Beauty, but your opinion of his DAUGHTERS is surely very singular, for if I {{understood}} you right, <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not find them so plain as you expected to do!" ...|$|E
60|$|Aca. O, say no more, lest words less kind destroy What {{these have}} raised in me {{of peace and}} joy: <b>You</b> <b>said,</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> both pity and forgive; You would do neither, should Acacis live. By death alone the certain way appears, Thus to hope mercy, and deserve your tears.|$|E
6000|$|MARMADUKE (still listening) [...] That dog of his, you are sure, [...] Could {{not come}} after us--he must have perished; [...] The torrent would have dashed an oak to splinters. [...] <b>You</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not like his looks--that he [...] Would trouble us; {{if he were}} here again, [...] I swear {{the sight of him}} would quail me more [...] Than twenty armies.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{very much}} obliged to you, sir," [...] Arnold answered, a little awkwardly. [...] "I shall {{bear in mind}} all that <b>you</b> have <b>said.</b> <b>You</b> <b>do</b> not object, I presume, to my dining with him to-night?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But what <b>did</b> <b>you</b> say to him? <b>you</b> <b>said</b> something. <b>You</b> <b>did</b> not, at any rate, bid him {{remember}} {{that he was a}} poor labouring man, and that you were a lady of high rank." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Say <b>you</b> are sorry <b>you</b> <b>said</b> what <b>you</b> <b>did</b> to me," [...] went on Dave, [...] "or {{into the}} river you go!" [...] And despite Poole's efforts, he dragged the aristocrat {{toward the edge of}} the dock.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm a very ordinary, {{matter of}} fact Englishman," [...] he said, [...] "leading a very ordinary, {{matter of fact}} life, and you must forgive me if I {{consider}} such a sweeping condemnation a little extravagant and fantastic. I have no particular enemies on my conscience, I am implicated in no conspiracy, and I am, in short, an individual of very little importance. Consequently I {{have nothing to fear}} from anybody and am afraid of nobody. This man cannot have anything to gain by injuring me. I believe <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not know the lady?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{know what}} you told me. <b>You</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not trust me. It doesn't matter. I am coming back whether you trust me or not. This house is under martial law, and I am in command. The {{situation}} has changed since I spoke to you last night. Last night I was ready to let you have your way. I intended {{to keep an eye}} on things from the inn. But it's different now. It is not a case of Sam Fisher any longer. You could have managed Sam. It's Buck MacGinnis now, the man who came that night in the automobile. I saw him in the village after I left you. He's dangerous.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'My lord, I {{have been}} {{thinking}} over our trouble'--he was with us in Egypt--'I {{have been thinking}} {{so much that it}} has got a hold of my sleep. To-night as <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not want me any more and I was tired, I went to bed early and had a dream. I dreamed that we were once more in the shrubbery, as happened some years ago, and that the little African gent who shot like a book, was showing us the traces of those two black men, just as he did when they tried to steal her ladyship. Then in my dream I seemed to go back to bed and that beastly snake which we found lying under the parcel in the road seemed to follow me. When I had got to sleep again, all in the dream, there it was standing on its tail {{at the end of the}} bed, hissing till it woke me. Then it spoke in good English and not in African as might have been expected.|$|E
5000|$|... "You thought I {{was young}} and innocent, but I absorbed every word <b>you</b> <b>said.</b> But <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not notice, for like you, I was good at pretending…it was you who taught me to be that way!" [...] (Yi Jing to the principal) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don’t say {{any more}} about it," [...] she pleaded. [...] "I have no doubt you are right. Only when <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> would <b>do</b> {{anything}} for us I—I thought you meant it. I see how uncomfortable it might be for you. I ought to have thought of that before." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If you {{had listened}} that night before <b>you</b> <b>said</b> what <b>you</b> <b>did,</b> all {{might have been}} different," [...] she answered. [...] "But I'm {{so glad to see}} you, and hungry for news. How <b>did</b> <b>you</b> leave mother, and the shop? I don't care to hear about the chapel." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I will go {{home in a}} taxi," [...] she agreed, [...] "if <b>you</b> will <b>do</b> {{one thing}} for me. It won't take long. It has been in my mind ever since <b>you</b> <b>said</b> what <b>you</b> <b>did</b> about charity. I want us all {{to go down to}} the Embankment. It isn't late enough really, but I want you to come." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you so much, Mr. Littleson," [...] she said. [...] "I won't {{forget what}} <b>you</b> have <b>said.</b> <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> mind excusing me? I fancy that I am wanted." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well. But don't {{you try to}} {{make out}} {{afterwards}} that I forced a quarrel on you. And now," [...] he added, with a grim change of tone that made Lydia shudder, and shifted her fears to the account of his antagonist, [...] "I'll make you wish you'd bit your tongue out before <b>you</b> <b>said</b> what <b>you</b> <b>did</b> a moment ago. So, take care of yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But that {{is quite}} wrong, aunt, and if you desire me to inherit your wealth you will be disappointed. A moment ago <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> wished to <b>do</b> the right thing, at last. Don't {{you know what that}} is?" ...|$|R
6000|$|I'm afraid you'll be very unhappy. But you see, {{something}} more than your happiness is at stake. A little while ago <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> wanted to <b>do</b> more for your country than <b>you</b> <b>did.</b> <b>Does</b> it strike <b>you</b> that <b>you</b> can <b>do</b> something for it now? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'He {{said what}} he did because he's a fool, and <b>you</b> <b>said</b> what <b>you</b> <b>did</b> because you're very wise and clever--almost too clever to live, unless you're very careful of yourself, Kit.' said Quilp, with great suavity in his manner, but still more of quiet malice about his eyes and mouth. 'Here's sixpence for you, Kit. Always speak the truth. At all times, Kit, speak the truth. Lock the counting-house, you dog, and bring me the key.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Again {{there was}} a spell of silence. At last--"I have been thinking, Monsieur," [...] she said, [...] "of that other {{occasion}} on which you rode with me. I remember that <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> had killed a man, and when I asked <b>you</b> why, <b>you</b> <b>said</b> that <b>you</b> had <b>done</b> it because he sought to kill you. Was that the truth?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do not apologize," [...] Amuba {{replied with}} a smile. [...] "Doubtless our {{appearance}} is strange to you, and indeed even among the peoples of Lydia and Persia there are few whose hair and eyes are as fair as ours. Even had <b>you</b> <b>said</b> that <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not like our appearance I should not have felt hurt, for all people I think like that {{to which they are}} accustomed; in any case, it is good of you to say that you regret what <b>you</b> said; people <b>do</b> not generally think that captives have feelings." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Never once. I had an {{impression}} that you were there. I fancied you were from father's carefully vacuous look whenever I glanced at his face. But were you careful about what <b>you</b> <b>said,</b> and <b>did</b> <b>you</b> see Menlove? I felt {{all the time that}} I had done wrong in letting you come; the gratification to you was not worth the risk to me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I quite understand, Mr. Blagrove, that {{although}} you {{are given a}} midshipman's rating, it is really as an interpreter that Sir Sidney Smith has engaged you. Would you wish to perform midshipman's duties also? I have asked him what are his wishes in the matter, and he left it entirely with you, saying that the very nominal pay of a midshipman was really no remuneration for {{the services of a}} gentleman capable of interpreting in three or four languages, but that as the rules of the service made no provision for the engagement of an interpreter, except under special circumstances, and as <b>you</b> <b>said</b> that <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not think it likely you should make the sea your profession, you might not care to undertake midshipman's duties in addition to those of interpreter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, yes," [...] he answered, desolately. [...] "There {{is no way}} out of it. If {{you only}} hated me, Clementina, despised me--I don't mean that. But if you were not so good, I could have a more hope for you--for myself. It's because you are so good that I can't make myself wish to change you, and yet I know--I am afraid that if you told me my life and objects were wrong, I should turn from them, and be {{whatever}} <b>you</b> <b>said.</b> <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> tell me that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let us {{understand}} each other, Professor Gilroy," [...] said she slowly. [...] "I {{am not a}} very safe person to trifle with, as you should realize by now. It was you who asked me {{to enter into a}} series of experiments with you, it was you who won my affections, it was you who professed your love for me, it was you who brought me your own photograph with words of affection upon it, and, finally, it was you who on the very same evening thought fit to insult me most outrageously, addressing me as no man has ever dared to speak to me yet. Tell me that those words came from you in a moment of passion and I am prepared to forget and to forgive them. <b>You</b> <b>did</b> not mean what <b>you</b> <b>said,</b> Austin? <b>You</b> <b>do</b> not really hate me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you remember, Stephen, {{how long}} ago in the old park you and I talked about {{immortality}} and <b>you</b> <b>said</b> then <b>you</b> <b>did</b> {{not want to know}} anything of what comes after life. Even now <b>do</b> <b>you</b> want to know? You are too busy and I am not busy enough. I want to be sure, not only to know, but to know that it is so, that this life--no, not this life, but that life, is only the bleak twilight of the morning. I think death--just dead death--after the life I have had is the most impossible of ends.... You don't want--particularly? I want to passionately. I want to live again--out of this body, Stephen, and all that it carves with it, to be free--as beautiful things are free. To be free as this is free--an exquisite clean freedom....|$|R
6000|$|... "To see Jane Neville!" [...] said Bessie, {{opening her}} blue eyes wide. [...] "Why, it was only last month <b>you</b> <b>said</b> that <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not care about Jane Neville now, because she had grown so vulgar. Don't you {{remember}} when she stopped here on her way down to Natal last year, and held up her fat hands, and said, 'Ah, Jess--Jess is a genius! It is a privilege to know her'? And then she asked you to quote Shakespeare to that lump of a brother of hers, and you told {{her that if she}} did not hold her tongue she would not enjoy the privilege much longer. And now you want to go and stop with her for two months! Well, Jess, you are odd. And, what's more, I think it is very unkind of you to run away for so long." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This must be preserved, for it will {{figure in}} the trial," [...] said Holmes, as he handed the bag with its {{contents}} to the inspector. [...] "It is now necessary that {{we should try to}} throw some light upon this third bullet, which has clearly, from the splintering of the wood, been fired from inside the room. I should like to see Mrs. King, the cook, again. <b>You</b> <b>said,</b> Mrs. King, that <b>you</b> were awakened by a LOUD explosion. When <b>you</b> <b>said</b> that, <b>did</b> <b>you</b> mean that it seemed to you to be louder than the second one?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Lowe {{was arrested}} by British police in April 2004 for {{trafficking}} £117,000 worth of crack cocaine, he denied the charges. The exact charge was 'attempting to possess 1.17 kg (2.5 lb) of crack cocaine with intent to supply'. The Prosecution claimed he signed for the package under the fake name of [...] "Kevin Brown" [...] and intended to profit financially from knowingly trafficking the drugs. Lowe countered that the fake name was to avoid paparazzi {{and that he had}} no idea about the contents of the package: [...] "I am Jamaican, maybe you think differently. If I am a mate and <b>you</b> <b>said,</b> 'can <b>you</b> <b>do</b> that for me', I am not going to think anything bad of you." [...] Lowe said in a police interview: [...] "I thought he was a friend". In February 2005 he was cleared as the charges were dismissed for lack of evidence.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nonsense, sir! Nonsense <b>you</b> <b>said,</b> <b>did</b> <b>you?</b> Your mother {{nonsense}}! This {{is the way}} {{to treat}} a parent, is it? I am nonsense, am I? I will teach you what nonsense is. Nonsense shall be very good sense; you shall find that, sir, that you shall. Nonsense, indeed! I'll write to your guardian, that I will! You call your mother nonsense, <b>do</b> <b>you?</b> And where <b>did</b> <b>you</b> learn that, I should like to know? Nonsense, indeed! This comes of your going to Cherbury! So your mother is nonsense; a pretty lesson for Lady Annabel to teach you. Oh! I'll speak my mind to her, that I will.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, Aylward," [...] said Sir Nigel, [...] "we cannot mend {{the matter}} by broiling. Sir Claude, I {{think that what}} <b>you</b> have <b>said</b> <b>does</b> <b>you</b> little honor, and if my words aggrieve you I am ever ready to go deeper into the matter with you. But you shall have such men as will follow you, and you may go where you will, so that you come not with us. Let all who love their prince and country stand fast, while those who think more of a well-lined purse step forth upon the farther side." ...|$|R
