The aim of geocaching {{is to use a}} GPS receiver to locate hidden containers, called geocaches, which have been hidden by other geocachers. The caches range in size from small magnetic “buttons ” the size of your fingernail, to ex-military ammunition cans. Each cache contains a logbook for the finders to sign, and, if size permits, some small trinkets for cachers to exchange for trinkets of their own. Once you’ve signed the log <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> log your <b>find</b> online through a website. There are several geocache listing websites; the most widely used is www. geocaching. com which is run by the company Groundspeak.

40|$|We {{live in a}} world {{obsessed with}} time. That being said, what does the fact that I {{continuously}} turn to my watch and my calendar to tell me the current time and date say about the way I live my life? Besides making sure that I am not late for appointments and guaranteeing that I do not hold my classes over too long, what value do these technological tools have for us as human beings? These are important questions that are raised in Erazim Kohak’s The Embers and the Stars. In that text, Kohak contrasts natural time [including “temporality in the rhythm of the seasons and of human life, ” (Kohak, 16) ] with our obsession with time as a modern construct of our society. While Kohak does not deny that clocks serve a special and important purpose in our society, he is concerned that we lose sight of the processes of life that give time ontological significance. Time as it is found in nature and the time of the clock present two distinct ways in which we can view time, and they are certainly not alien to philosophical discussion. Even within the last hundred years we find the distinction between vulgar and authentic time in a wide array of locations, ranging from the philosophical writing of Martin Heidegger to the concept of mindful meditation as found in Jon Kabat-Zinn’s Wherever You Go There <b>You</b> Are.
