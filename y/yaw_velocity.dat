40|$|We {{consider}} a three-dimensional problem of steering a nonholonomic vehicle {{to seek an}} unknown source of a spatially distributed signal field without any position measurement. In the literature, there exists an extremum seeking-based strategy under a constant forward velocity and tunable pitch and <b>yaw</b> <b>velocities.</b> Obviously, the vehicle with a constant forward velocity may exhibit certain overshoots in the seeking process and can not slow down even it approaches the source. To resolve this undesired behavior, this paper proposes a regulation strategy for the forward velocity along with the pitch and <b>yaw</b> <b>velocities.</b> Under such a strategy, the vehicle slows down near the source and stays within a small area as {{if it comes to}} a full stop, and controllers for angular velocities become succinct.

In order to improve the steering performance of the greenhouse spraying mobile robot, based on the characteristics that each wheel torque of the robot can be separately controlled, the dynamic model of the four-wheel independent steering system is firstly established by using the D'alembert’s Principle and choosing the sideslip angle and the <b>yaw</b> <b>velocity</b> as the state variables. Then, based on the theory of sliding mode control, a dynamic sliding mode control strategy with exponential approaching rate is proposed by adopting the sideslip angle and the <b>yaw</b> <b>velocity</b> as the joint control variables {{in order to make}} the sideslip angle be in the stable range and make the oyaw velocity track the desired value well.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} divided into three parts. The first two parts deal with two {{different}} methods for predicting the manoeuvring characteristics of ships using a neural network technique. The third part deals with the application of the random decrement concept to the coupled sway-yaw motions. [...] In {{the first part of this}} thesis, a new predictive method is presented for the estimation of the hydrodynamic characteristics of a ship performing certain standard manoeuvres. This method uses the static neural network technique to predict the nonlinear hydrodynamic forces of the ship during its motion in the horizontal plane. The neural network model uses a steepest descent search to find the neural network weights. In this thesis, a back propagation algorithm is used to calculate the slope of the sum-of-squared-error curve as a function of the different weights. Data for training the neural network consists of the data from a 35 - 35 degree zigzag manoeuvre. Surge, sway, <b>yaw</b> <b>velocities</b> and rudder angles are used as input to the predictive model. The target output data are the lumped nonlinear hydrodynamic functions. [...] The generalization of the trained neural network model is checked by simulating the manoeuvres of the ship in a situation different from the one used in the training of neural network. A moderate 20 - 20 degree zigzag manoeuvre, a 25 degree turning (starboard) and a 20 degree Dieudonne spiral manoeuvre are selected to check the validity of the neural network model. [...] In the second part of this thesis, another approach to predict ship turning manoeuvres is proposed. This model maps the relationship between sway <b>velocities</b> and <b>yaw</b> rates during the circular manoeuvre using a neural network technique. This method reduces the number of equations to be used in the prediction to a single yaw equation. This new yaw equation can then be used for predicting turning manoeuvres. [...] In the last part of the thesis work, the extension of the random decrement approach to the nonlinear sway-yaw motions is presented. The random waves are simulated based on the ITTC spectrum formula. The linear system and the nonlinear system of sway and yaw motion equations are discussed. The autocorrelation functions of the response of sway and <b>yaw</b> <b>velocities</b> in random waves are obtained. A method for using these functions to identify the hydrodynamic characteristics of the coupled sway-yaw motions is suggested...|$|R
