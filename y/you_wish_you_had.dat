500|$|The Philadelphia Inquirer and the San Jose Mercury News both {{commented on}} the {{fundamental}} problem that Springsteen seemed to be facing on the tour. [...] The former said [...] "Bruce Springsteen may well have miscalculated {{earlier this year when}} he released Working on a Dream, one of the most hopeful and downright happy sounding albums of his career just as a cratering economy was rendering the songs of struggle and strife that are his stock in trade more resonant than they have sounded in years." [...] The latter said, [...] "As Don Rumsfeld might say, you don't go on tour with the album <b>you</b> <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> <b>had,</b> you go on tour with the album you've got. So Springsteen faces the tough task of hyping a new romantic pop record while simultaneously offering hope and support to a wounded nation – not an easy task." [...] Rolling Stone voiced a similar theory. [...] Chicago Tribune critic Greg Kot wrote that [...] "If there was a disappointment, it was that Springsteen didn’t make a stronger case for his latest album, Working on a Dream. I’m not a fan of the album, but I always look forward to how the singer reinvents his studio work on the stage. In this case, however, he barely touched the new material ..." [...] Views on one, the early-in-show, eight-minute [...] "Outlaw Pete" [...] – one of the few new material centerpieces – varied considerably.|$|E

6000|$|Her {{face was}} eloquent with reproach as she said, [...] "Then {{you were only}} making believe when <b>you</b> <b>wished</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> a little girl like me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, I guess <b>you</b> <b>wished</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> {{stayed at}} home. What a state for your boots!—and your skirts too, I know. Here, {{let me take}} them into the kitchen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “There is no reason,” {{said the}} man, “why <b>you</b> should not <b>have</b> {{a house in}} all points similar to this, and finer, if <b>you</b> <b>wish.</b> <b>You</b> <b>have</b> some money, I suppose?” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, Rosy, don't say that," [...] said Lydgate, {{drawing her}} closer to him. [...] "That is like saying <b>you</b> <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> married another man." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "See that! he's {{got away}} from you!" [...] cried Crabs to Baldy, in tones of deep disgust. [...] "Now don't <b>you</b> <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> let me tend to him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The gipsy Queen {{eyed the}} two men sternly, and then said: <b>'As</b> <b>you</b> <b>wish.</b> <b>You</b> <b>have</b> chosen for yourself, and have met warning with scorn, and appeal with levity. On your own heads be the doom!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Twould {{have been}} better <b>had</b> <b>you</b> said <b>you</b> <b>wished</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> never {{attempted}} {{to do what it}} little becomes any white man's gifts to undertake; in which case, not only might we have kept from coming to blows, but Thomas Hutter would now have been living, and the hearts of the savages would be less given to vengeance. The death of that young woman, too, was on-called for, Henry March, and leaves a heavy load on our names if not on our consciences!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Or {{else that}} what?" [...] she demanded. [...] "Ma foi, it only remains that <b>you</b> should <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> kept your promise to this scum." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sam, don't <b>you</b> <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> the old Dartaway back," [...] remarked Stanley, presently. [...] "You used {{to cover}} {{this part of the}} country pretty well with that flying machine?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And I suppose <b>you</b> <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> {{stayed with}} him," [...] I flung back, hotly. [...] "He had spun you {{a score of}} fine speeches and a hundred empty {{compliments}} by now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Down cellar, an' you needn't take on no airs, ol' woman. I've {{known you}} to buy things you didn't need time an' time an' agin-tins an' things, an' I guess <b>you</b> <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> back that ten dollars you paid for that {{illustrated}} Bible," ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{stagnation}} {{of life on}} the Garland side of the party-wall {{began to}} have a very gloomy effect by the contrast. When, about half-past nine o'clock, one of these tantalizing bursts of gaiety had resounded for a longer time than usual, Anne said, 'I believe, mother, that <b>you</b> are <b>wishing</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> gone.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But Caroline, Caroline," [...] {{repeated}} Marian, {{carried away}} {{by the thought that}} rose to her lips, [...] "only think; you say now if it was this time last year--now, while you can escape. Shall not you say so all the more when it is really too late,--when <b>you</b> will <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> drawn back now?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'She {{carried the}} baby to the nursery just before <b>you</b> came. I <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> seen her. The little thing had pulled down her hair and made her look so pretty and like herself.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Captain," [...] {{called out}} Col. Zane, banging {{his hand on}} the table.

6000|$|... "No," [...] said Grace, magnanimously. [...] "You may go on loving {{him if you}} like--I don't mind at all. You'll find it, let me tell you, a bitterer {{business}} for yourself than {{for me in the}} end. He'll get tired of you soon, as tired as can be--you don't know him so well as I--and then <b>you</b> may <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> never seen him!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wait a minute, please," [...] said Matt to him. [...] "I {{have another}} such a knife. If <b>you</b> <b>wish</b> it <b>you</b> can <b>have</b> {{it at the}} same figure that the young man paid." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, <b>you</b> shall <b>have</b> your way,' said he, with a {{sinister}} smile. 'You shall see the Baron. And perhaps, before <b>you</b> <b>have</b> finished, <b>you</b> will <b>wish</b> that <b>you</b> <b>had</b> taken my advice.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{should not}} say that, Marion; you shall not think it. I am ungrateful; because, were it given {{me to have}} it all back again, I would not sell what I have had of you, though the {{possession}} has been so limited, for all other imaginable treasures. I will bear it. Oh, my love, I will bear it. Do not say again that <b>you</b> <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> not seen me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There, John! it's just as I knew {{it would}} be; I always said you wanted a {{different}} sort of a woman for a wife. Now, you knew when you took me that I wasn't in the least strong-minded or sensible, but a poor little helpless thing; and you are beginning to get tired of me already. <b>You</b> <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> married a woman like Grace, I know you do." ...|$|E
6000|$|Unbolting {{the cellar}} door, the girls {{announced}} to the invisible captive that they were through, and then departed much depressed. Half-way up the second flight, they all stopped as suddenly {{as if they had}} seen a ghost; for looking over the banisters was Tom's face, crocky but triumphant, and in either hand a junk of candy, which he waved above them as he vanished, with the tantalizing remark, [...] "Don't <b>you</b> <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> some?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well, madam," [...] said Loveday, {{wiping her}} eyes. [...] "I only {{hope it will}} not be the worse for you in the end, and that <b>you</b> will not <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> listened to poor Loveday's advice." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly not hurry about marrying. I've {{wondered}} that a {{girl could}} make up her mind to marry any given man. Haven't <b>you</b> ever <b>wished</b> that <b>you</b> <b>had</b> not made up your mind about me?" ...|$|R

60|$|Tanner {{was born}} about 1780; {{he lived in}} Kentucky. Don't <b>you</b> <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> lived in Kentucky in Colonel Boone's time? The Shawnees were roaming about the {{neighbourhood}} when Tanner was a little boy. His uncle scalped one of them. This made bad feeling between the Tanners and the Shawnees; but John, like any boy of spirit, wished never to learn lessons, {{and wanted to be}} an Indian brave. He soon had more of being a brave than he liked; but he never learned any more lessons, and could not even read or write.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't say that," [...] said Gwendolen, hurriedly, {{feeling that}} this might be her only chance of getting the words uttered, and {{dreading}} the increase of her own agitation. [...] "If you despair of me, I shall despair. Your saying that I should not go on being selfish and ignorant has been some strength to me. If you say <b>you</b> <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> not meddled--that means you despair of me and forsake me. And then you will decide for me that I shall not be good. It is you who will decide; because you might have made me different by keeping as near to me as you could, and believing in me." ...|$|E
60|$|No {{doubt there}} are {{persons who are}} fond of canned milk; but, for my part, I loathe it. The effect of the {{sweetish}} glue upon my inner man is singularly nauseating. I have even been driven to drink my matutinal coffee in all its after-dinner strength rather than adulterate it with the mixture. You have, it is true, the choice of using the stuff as a dubious paste, or of mixing it with water into a non-committal wash; and, whichever plan you adopt, <b>you</b> <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> adopted the other. Why it need be so unpalatably cloying is not clear to my mind. They tell me the sugar is needed to preserve the milk. I never could make out that it preserved anything but the sugar. Simply to see the stuff ooze {{out of the hole}} in the can is deterrent. It is enough to make one think seriously at times of adding a good milch cow to his already ample trip encumberment, at the certain cost of delaying the march, and the not improbable chance of being taken for an escaped lunatic. Indeed, to the Japanese mind, to be seen solemnly preceding a caravan of cattle for purposes of diet would certainly suggest insanity. For cows in Japan are never milked. Dairy products, consequently, are not to be had on the road, and the man who fancies milk, butter, or cheese must take them with him.|$|E

6000|$|Amy {{recovered}} {{herself in}} a breath, set her basket boldly on the seat, and said, laughing, [...] "Don't <b>you</b> <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> were to <b>have</b> some of the salad he's going to make, {{and to see the}} charming young ladies who are to eat it?" ...|$|R
5000|$|A {{spin-off}} {{series was}} made {{after the second}} series titled Educating: What I Wish I'd Known... each episode futures a student from either series one or series two of Educating.... The series {{was made up of}} six seven-minute episodes. The tagline was [...] "What is the advice <b>you</b> <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> could <b>have</b> given your teenage self?" [...] Filmed in 2014, this series asks students from Educating Essex and Yorkshire what they would have told their younger selves. However, the series was cancelled after one series.|$|R
