60|$|Val. But, sir, <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>on</b> {{too much}} {{disadvantage}} {{to be your}} son's rival.|$|E
6000|$|... "Boss, it's your grounds. Fire 'em off if {{they don't}} suit <b>you....</b> <b>Come</b> <b>on,</b> let's git in the game. Watcher want--field er bat?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's no good getting wrathy, Rattray. We've come to jape with <b>you.</b> <b>Come</b> <b>on,</b> Beetle. They're all at home. You can wind 'em." ...|$|E
60|$|BLOOM: (Blows) Providential <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>on</b> the scene. <b>You</b> have a car?...|$|R
6000|$|... "Y-yes, father. I am so surprised, {{for it is}} {{his father}} who sails this ship! And I cannot imagine how he or <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>on</b> board." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm awfully glad <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>on</b> here. We {{must get}} better acquainted. I often thought about you, you know, and the {{remarkable}} circumstances of your environment.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{have all}} those behind <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>on</b> a {{friendly}} visit, too? Do {{they also want to}} see the poor Indian? It is very kind." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Madame de Melbain {{would like}} to talk to you for a few moments," [...] she said quietly. [...] "Afterwards will <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>on</b> to the terrace?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Is that all?' said Arthur, laughing; 'I thought {{something}} had happened to <b>you.</b> <b>Come,</b> <b>on</b> with your bonnet. Fancy! John will actually walk with us to St. Cross!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not on {{your own}} account, of course: <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>on</b> behalf of your employer, Mr. Sabin, or some one behind him! What is this devilry, Blanche?" ...|$|R
6000|$|MISS GILPIN (taking her hand--with kind affability). We've {{been expecting}} you all day. How do you do? I'm Miss Gilpin. <b>You</b> <b>came</b> <b>on</b> the last train, didn't you? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That will do," [...] {{the captain}} said. [...] "I have liked your {{face from the}} moment <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>on</b> board, and feel that I can trust your word." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{send you}} a copy. I'd like to talk it over with <b>you.</b> <b>Come</b> <b>on,</b> Victoria, I've {{arranged}} for an early lunch. Come on, Mrs. Pomfret--get in, Alice." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, lads," [...] {{the captain}} said, [...] "pull with a will. There {{will be a}} good supper, and an {{allowance}} of strong ale, when <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>on</b> board." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why {{did you do}} so much?' I said. 'Why did <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>on</b> foot {{all down}} the valley when you could have taken the train? Was it worth it?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I hadn't a {{wife and}} a child at home you may be sure, sir, I would have asked you to let me go the very minute <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>on</b> board." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{have been}} {{together}} now over six years, sir, so I suppose I know you a bit by this time. I could see {{there was something wrong}} directly <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>on</b> board." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thought it}} was you, young 'un, in the first act," [...] he answered. [...] "In the second, when <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>on</b> without a moustache, I knew it. Are you in a hurry?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's all right, Alec," [...] Carmintel {{said in a}} low voice. [...] "I'll {{not bother}} <b>you.</b> <b>Come</b> <b>on</b> into the cabin, and we'll talk things over," [...] he added.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well,' said I, 'friend, {{but will}} they let <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>on</b> board {{after you have}} been on shore here, when {{this is such a}} terrible place, and so {{infected}} as it is?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We are {{a curious}} people," [...] Agatha remarked with a laugh. [...] "But you passed a smooth beach with good shade {{where the river}} runs out. Why did <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>on</b> here?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! well, then, if you must, I'll go a {{piece with}} you, and show you a cross road that will take you there better than the road <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>on.</b> That road's mighty bad." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nearly {{half that}} time has passed since <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>on</b> duty, {{and there is no}} reason why you should remain awake when it's {{impossible}} for me to sleep. I can keep a sharp watch." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You told us, I think, {{that you}} {{determined}} this {{by the fact}} that <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>on</b> duty at eleven o'clock, {{and that it would be}} half-an-hour or a little more after that when Captain Tremayne arrived?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Sir Oswald, you {{can speak}} freely. I have placed a guard outside the door, {{and there is}} no fear of interruption. Do <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>on</b> your own account, or from another?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I saw—-I saw, my boy. To find you-—as you were, made me most thankful. You {{must have}} resisted. Tell me, were you of this party, or did <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>on</b> them by accident?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here!" [...] I ses, [...] "you clear off. All of you. ’Ow dare <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>on</b> to my wharf? If you aren’t gone in {{two minutes}} I’ll give you all in charge." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Granting {{that you}} owed him no gratitude, were you obliged {{to go out}} of your way to take his wife from him? Until <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>on</b> the scene they were happy. Why couldn't you leave them alone?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Know you'd come bang {{up to meet}} me?" [...] Vanderbank laughed. [...] "Jolly at any rate, {{thanks to}} my mistake, to have in this way a quiet moment with <b>you.</b> <b>You</b> <b>came</b> <b>on</b> ahead of your mother?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Like it, my good fellow!" [...] exclaimed Lawrence, himself {{giving way}} to a short laugh to conceal his feelings, [...] "of course I like it, only <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>on</b> me unexpectedly, and, to say truth, I am--" ...|$|R
6000|$|After {{half an hour}} of triumphant ovation, Joshua {{remembered his}} brother-in-law, and did fall back so as to pick him up. [...] "What's the matter, Harry? Why don't <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>on</b> and join us?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘True!’ {{returned}} Somerset. ‘It cannot so be done; {{and there}} is no help but you must carry it away with <b>you.</b> <b>Come</b> <b>on,</b> then, and let me at once consign you to a train.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said I, [...] "friend, {{but will}} they let <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>on</b> board {{after you have}} been on shore here, when this {{has been such a}} terrible place, and so {{infected}} as it is?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing {{gone wrong}} in town, I hope, Major?" [...] George said next day, {{as he was}} {{removing}} the breakfast things. [...] "You will excuse my asking, but you don't {{seem to me to}} be yourself since <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>on</b> board." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "About {{remaining}} on board. Of course <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>on</b> the ship under peculiar circumstances, but I think {{you like the}} life, and I {{would like you to}} remain on board for the trip. I will pay you the same as the other hands." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You did. You {{told me when}} <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>on</b> at Cherbourg {{that you}} had to go to New York to look after some {{property}} there, that things were very quiet in London, and that you hated traveling alone. Therefore, you sent for me at a few hours' notice." ...|$|R
