500|$|The {{years between}} 1922 and 1929 saw {{frequent}} changes in government. In 1924, George appointed the first Labour Prime Minister, Ramsay MacDonald, {{in the absence}} of a clear majority for any one of the three major parties. George's tactful and understanding reception of the first Labour government (which lasted less than a year) allayed the suspicions of the party's sympathisers. During the General Strike of 1926 the King advised the government of Conservative Stanley Baldwin against taking inflammatory action, and took exception to suggestions that the strikers were [...] "revolutionaries" [...] saying, [...] "Try living on their wages before <b>you</b> <b>judge</b> them." ...|$|E

2500|$|Elton {{has been}} criticised for writing a musical with Conservative Party {{supporter}} Andrew Lloyd Webber. In his defence, Elton said [...] "If I were {{to refuse to}} talk to Tories, I would narrow my social and professional scope considerably. If <b>you</b> <b>judge</b> all your relationships on a person's voting intentions, I think you miss out on the varieties of life." [...] He {{is also one of}} the few items to have been put into Room 101 twice: first by Anne Robinson in 2001 and then by Mark Steel.|$|E
2500|$|Similarly, [...] prohibits showing {{partiality}} in judicial proceedings. Earlier, in [...] God told Moses to {{tell the}} people, more narrowly, not to favor a poor person in a dispute. More broadly, in [...] Moses told that God shows no partiality among persons. Among the prophets, in [...] the prophet quoted God {{as saying that the}} people had not kept God's ways when they showed partiality in the law, and in the writings, Psalm [...] asks, [...] "How long will <b>you</b> <b>judge</b> unjustly, and show favor to the wicked?" [...] counsels that it is not good to show partiality to the wicked, so as to turn aside the righteous in judgment. Similarly, [...] and [...] say that to show partiality is not good. [...] reports that God has no iniquity or favoritism.|$|E
2500|$|In mid-June, Smith {{suffered}} a side strain which {{prevented him from}} playing for six weeks. By this point of the season, Smith had experienced success as an opener in the limited-over matches, scoring half centuries in one-day and Twenty20 matches, although his batting average in first-class matches was a disappointing 8.50 from four matches. Moores backed Smith {{to succeed in the}} long form of the game, stating [...] "We've backed Tom to do it because it balances our team and he has shown he is a very good player. I think we've seen that in the one-day stuff. I think Tom is playing well. <b>You</b> <b>judge</b> a player on how he's playing. Tom's developing and learning quickly. Technically, he stands up tall and plays up the ground which is what you want your openers to do".|$|E

2500|$|Shimon ben Lakish contrasted [...] "In justice shall <b>you</b> <b>judge</b> your neighbor," [...] with [...] "Justice, justice shall you pursue," [...] and {{concluded}} that [...] referred to an apparently genuine claim, while [...] referred to the redoubled scrutiny appropriate to a suit that one suspected to be dishonest. Rav Ashi found no contradiction, however, between the two verses, for a Baraita taught that in the two mentions of [...] "justice" [...] in [...] one mention referred to a decision based on strict law, while the other referred to compromise. For example, where two boats meet on a narrow river headed in opposite directions, if both attempted to pass at the same time, both would sink, but if one made way for the other, both could pass without mishap. Similarly, if two camels met on the ascent to Bethoron, if they both ascended at the same time, both could fall into the valley, but if they ascended one after another, both could ascend safely. These were the principles by which the travelers were to resolve their impasse: If one was loaded and the other unloaded, then the unloaded was {{to give way to}} the loaded. If one was nearer to its destination than the other, then the nearer was to give way to the farther. If they were equally near to their destinations, then they were to compromise and the one that went first was to compensate the one who gave way..|$|E
2500|$|Like Dutch {{football}} in general until the mid-1960s, Cruyff's early playing career was considerably influenced by coaching philosophy of British/English coaches such as Vic Buckingham. However, his footballing philosophy shares more similar aspects to free-flowing style of South American football (Brazilian {{football in}} particular) than traditional British/Anglo-Saxon school of football (with distinctively direct, aggressive, heavily athletic, muscular, physical elements in coaching and playing style). The mind-body duality always {{plays an important}} role in his footballing philosophy. In Cruyff’s words, quoted in Dennis Bergkamp's autobiography Stillness and Speed: My Story, “...Because you play football with your head, and your legs are there to help you. If you don't use your head, using your feet won't be sufficient. Why does a player have to chase the ball? Because he started running too late. You have to pay attention, use your brain and find the right position. If you get to the ball late, it means you chose the wrong position. Bergkamp was never late.” For Cruyff, football (the so-called beautiful game) is much an artistic-oriented mind-body game instead of an athletic-oriented physical competition. As he put it, [...] "Every trainer talks about movement, about running a lot. I say don't run so much. Football is a game you play with your brain. You have to be in the right place at the right moment, not too early, not too late." [...] The creativity is always the key element in his footballing philosophy, both as a player and as a manager. Cruyff once compared his more intuitive and individualistic approach with Louis van Gaal's more mechanized and rigid coaching style, “Van Gaal has a good vision on football. But it's not mine. He wants to gel winning teams and has a militaristic way of working with his tactics. I don't. I want individuals to think for themselves and take the decision on the pitch that is best for the situation... I don't have anything against computers, but <b>you</b> <b>judge</b> football players intuitively and with your heart. On the basis of the criteria which are now in use at Ajax [...] I would have failed the test. When I was 15, I could barely kick the ball 15 metres with my left and with the right maybe 20 metres. I would not have been able to take a corner. Besides, I was physically weak and relatively slow. My two qualities were great technique and insight, which happen to be two things you can’t measure with a computer.” ...|$|E
