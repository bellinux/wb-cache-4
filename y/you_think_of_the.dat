500|$|Alexander Downer, the Minister for Foreign Affairs in Australia's Coalition government, {{was amused}} {{when asked to}} comment on the incident. He said the arrests proved that the {{security}} system had functioned properly, adding that [...] "whatever <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> humour of The Chaser... they were clearly not going to harm anybody in a physical way". The incident also generated debate during Question Time in the Senate.|$|E
500|$|The Japanese {{force on}} Tarakan learned of Derrick's death {{and tried to}} exploit it for {{propaganda}} purposes.

[...] This leaflet reached few Australian soldiers, and had little impact on them. [...] "Tokyo Rose" [...] also broadcast taunts over [...] "Terick's" [...] death.|$|E

But when <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sixties and the youth culture and the way it sort of takes over. What you're looking at is Don's fear of the children being cut loose. At the same time, the children come back and eat you." [...] Weiner commented that the Michael Ginsberg character was [...] "of the next wave" [...] as a youthful employee who is [...] "unfamiliar with social rules", with Weiner also declaring that [...] "there is no reason that the concerns of older people are different than younger people".|$|E

500|$|Although Fischer {{had ended}} his formal {{education}} at age 16, {{dropping out of}} Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn, he subsequently taught himself several foreign languages so he could read foreign chess periodicals. According to Latvian chess master Alexander Koblencs, even he and Tal could not match the commitment that Fischer had made to chess. Recalling a conversation from the tournament: Tell me, Bobby,' Tal continued, 'what do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> playing style of Larissa Volpert?' 'She's too cautious. But you have another girl, Dmitrieva. Her games do appeal to me!' Here we were left literally open-mouthed in astonishment. Misha and I have looked at thousands of games, but it never even occurred to us to study the games of our women players. How could we find the time for this?! Yet Bobby, it turns out, had found the time! ...|$|E
500|$|In July 2014, Fazekas {{talked about}} how the series would relate to the One-Shot, saying, [...] "The short really {{is the basis for}} the series. 's working at SSR, post-war...If <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> short as sort {{of the end of the}} series, the series would be leading up to that moment where she gets {{assigned}} to S.H.I.E.L.D." [...] Markus reiterated this in January 2015, but added that [...] "we all agree and understand that [...] going to get tougher if we continue" [...] making the series. The first season introduces the origins of the Black Widow and Winter Soldier programs, which both appear in several MCU films, while the second season shows the discovery of the Darkforce (known as Zero Matter in the series), which previously appeared in Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. and has ties to Doctor Strange.|$|E
500|$|Press in Europe {{ranged from}} mixed to negative. The press in Germany {{did not like}} the film. At the Berlin premiere, a writer for The New York Times wrote [...] "Whatever <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{director}} Charles [...] Theodor Dreyer, there is no denying that he is 'different.' He does things that make people talk about him. You may find his films ridiculous—but you won't forget them...Although in many ways [...] {{was one of the worst}} films I have ever attended, there were some scenes in it that gripped with brutal directness". Press reaction to the film in Paris was mixed. Reporter Herbert Matthews of The New York Times wrote that Vampyr was [...] "a hallucinating film", that [...] "either held the spectators spellbound as in a long nightmare or else moved them to hysterical laughter". For many years after Vampyrs initial release, the film was viewed by critics as one of Dreyer's weaker works.|$|E

500|$|Warner Bros. {{was less}} willing {{to move forward on}} development, despite their enthusiasm for Hamm's script, which Batman co-creator Bob Kane greeted with {{positive}} feedback. Hamm's script was then bootlegged at various comic book stores in the United States. Batman was finally given the greenlight to commence pre-production in April 1988, after the success of Burton's Beetlejuice (1988). When comic book fans found out about Burton directing the film with Michael Keaton starring in the lead role, controversy arose over the tone and direction Batman was going in. Hamm explained, [...] "They hear Tim Burton's name and they think of Pee-wee's Big Adventure. They hear Keaton's name and they think of any number of Michael Keaton comedies. <b>You</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1960s version of Batman, and it was the complete opposite of our film. We tried to market it with a typical dark and serious tone, but the fans didn't believe us." [...] To combat negative reports on the film's production, Kane was hired as creative consultant.|$|E
500|$|Regarded as an auteur filmmaker, Nolan's visual style often emphasises urban settings, men in suits, muted colours, {{dialogue}} scenes {{framed in}} wide close-up with a shallow {{depth of field}} and modern locations and architecture. Aesthetically, the director favours deep, evocative shadows, documentary-style lighting, natural settings and real filming locations over studio work. Nolan has noted {{that many of his}} films are heavily influenced by film noir. He has continuously experimented with metafictive elements, temporal shifts, elliptical cutting, solipsistic perspectives, nonlinear storytelling, labyrinthine plots and the merging of style and form. Discussing The Tree of Life (2011), Nolan spoke of Terrence Malick's work and how it has influenced his own approach to style, [...] "When you think of a visual style, when <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> visual language of a film, there tends to be a natural separation of the visual style and the narrative elements. But with the greats, whether it's Stanley Kubrick or Terrence Malick or Hitchcock, what you're seeing is an inseparable, a vital relationship between the image and the story it's telling".|$|E
500|$|Casting for Desperate Housewives {{began in}} February 2004. Director Charles McDougall {{reported}} seeing around 150 [...] "very good and determined women" [...] audition {{for the four}} leads. Eva Longoria was the first actor cast in a lead role, landing the role of Gabrielle Solis, a materialistic ex-model, after two auditions. Longoria, an unknown soap opera actress at the time, stated that prior to her audition, she had not read the entire script. She recounted, [...] "Marc Cherry asks, 'So what did <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> script?' like the whole thing. And I said, 'Well I didn’t read the script. I only read my part.' And Marc Cherry goes, 'I knew you were Gabrielle at that moment because {{it was such a}} Gabrielle thing to say.'" [...] Roselyn Sánchez also auditioned for the role. Teri Hatcher was cast in the role of Susan Mayer, a single mother looking for love, after a second audition for ABC network executives. Cherry commended Hatcher's audition, calling it [...] "the best audition I've ever seen in network [...]" [...] Actors originally considered for the role include Courteney Cox, Calista Flockhart, Mary-Louise Parker, and Sela Ward. Julia Louis-Dreyfus also expressed interest in the role, but network executives felt she was not right for the part.|$|E

2500|$|In 1998, Cousins was {{selected}} in the All-Australian Team and was runner-up in West Coast's Best and Fairest. He played in his first AFL finals game in 1999, against the Western Bulldogs in a qualifying final at the MCG, and the year included another selection in the All-Australian Team and representing Australia in the International Rules Series. In 2000, Cousins signed a new three-year contract with the West Coast Eagles, reportedly worth nearly A$1million. He played his 100th game amid speculation he would take over the captaincy from Guy McKenna, who was due to retire after the same game. Cousins said, [...] "After you play two or three seasons, <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> possibility of a leadership role down the track, but the talk of it has certainly come a lot earlier than I would have thought." [...] In 2001, Cousins was named co-captain, sharing the role with Dean Kemp. He won his first club Best and Fairest {{at the end of}} the season, a feat which he repeated in 2002 and 2003, and he was again named in the All-Australian Team in 2001 and 2002. Kemp's retirement saw Cousins become the captain in 2002, a role he filled until 2006. In 2005, West Coast coach John Worsfold said of Cousins' fifth year as captain, [...] "Ben is improving all the time and with the way this group is coming along, I think he is going to be a great leader".|$|E
2500|$|Several {{science fiction}} creators {{commented on the}} film.

[...] Joss Whedon called the film [...] "my number one" [...] and praised its storytelling, structure and depth, concluding, [...] "It works on whatever level you want to bring to it."Republished online as: [...] Filmmaker Darren Aronofsky commented, [...] "I walked out of The Matrix... and I was thinking, 'What kind of science fiction movie can people make now?' The Wachowski Brothers basically took all the great sci-fi ideas of the 20th century and rolled them into a delicious pop culture sandwich that everyone on the planet devoured." [...] Director M. Night Shyamalan expressed admiration for The Wachowskis, stating, [...] "Whatever <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Matrix, every shot is there because of the passion they have! You can see they argued it out!". Actor and screenwriter Simon Pegg said that The Matrix provided [...] "the excitement and satisfaction that [...] failed to inspire. The Matrix seemed fresh and cool and visually breathtaking; making wonderful, intelligent use of CGI to augment the on-screen action, striking a perfect balance of the real and the hyperreal. It was possibly the coolest film I had ever seen." [...] Director Quentin Tarantino counted The Matrix as one of his twenty favourite movies from 1992 to 2009.|$|E

2500|$|Todd McCarthy of Variety {{called the}} film an [...] "old-fashioned monster movie {{dressed up in}} trendy new threads", praising the special effects, [...] "nihilistic attitude" [...] and [...] "post-9/11 anxiety overlay", but said, [...] "In the end, [...] not much {{different}} from all the marauding creature features that have come before it". Scott Foundas of LA Weekly was critical of the film's use of scenes reminiscent of the September 11 attacks in New York City and called it [...] "cheap and opportunistic". He suggested that the film was engaging in [...] "stealth" [...] attempts at social commentary and compared this unfavorably to the films of Don Siegel, George A. Romero and Steven Spielberg, saying, [...] "Where those filmmakers all had something meaningful to say {{about the state of the}} world and [...] human nature, Abrams doesn't have much to say about anything". Manohla Dargis in the New York Times called the allusions [...] "tacky", saying, [...] " [...] may make <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> attack, and you may curse the filmmakers for their vulgarity, insensitivity or lack of imagination", but that [...] "the film is too dumb to offend anything except your intelligence". She concludes that the film [...] "works as a showcase for impressively realistic-looking special effects, a realism that fails to extend to the scurrying humans whose fates are meant to invoke pity and fear but instead inspire yawns and contempt." [...] Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com calls the film [...] "badly constructed, humorless and emotionally sadistic", and sums up by saying that the film [...] "takes the trauma of 9/11 and turns it into just another random spectacle at which to point and shoot". Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune warned that the viewer may feel [...] "queasy" [...] at the references to September 11, but that [...] "other sequences [...] carry a real jolt" [...] and that such tactics were [...] "crude, but undeniably gripping". He called the film [...] "dumb", but [...] "quick and dirty and effectively brusque", concluding that despite it being [...] "a harsher, more demographically calculating brand of fun", he enjoyed the film. Bruce Paterson of Cinephilia described the film as [...] "a successful experiment in style but not necessarily a successful story for those who want dramatic closure". [...] Some critics also pointed out the similarity to the Half-Life video game series, in particular the [...] "Ant-lion" [...] monsters from Half-Life 2, and the constant first-person perspective.|$|E
