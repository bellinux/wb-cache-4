5|$|An annual festival, Lebowski Fest, {{began in}} Louisville, Kentucky, United States in 2002 with 150 fans showing up, {{and has since}} {{expanded}} to several other cities. The festival's main event each <b>year</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> night of unlimited bowling with various contests including costume, trivia, hardest- and farthest-traveled contests. Held over a weekend, events typically include a pre-fest party with bands {{the night before the}} bowling event as well as a day-long outdoor party with bands, vendor booths and games. Various celebrities from the film have even attended some of the events, including Jeff Bridges who attended the Los Angeles event. The British equivalent, inspired by Lebowski Fest, is known as The Dude Abides and is held in London.|$|E
5|$|The Atlantic Coast Conference Men's Basketball Coach of the <b>Year</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{basketball}} award {{given to}} head {{coaches in the}} Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). The award is granted to the head coach voted {{to be the most}} successful that season by members of the Atlantic Coast Sports Media Association, and since the 2012–13 season has also been awarded in separate voting by the league's coaches. The award was first given following the 1953–54season, {{the first year of the}} conference's existence, to Everett Case of NC State. The first winner of the coaches' award was Jim Larrañaga of Miami (FL) in 2013.|$|E

50|$|Because every 50 <b>years</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> Jubilee <b>year,</b> there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> Yobel Cycle; Because {{every seven}} <b>years</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> sabbatical <b>year,</b> there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> seven-year Release Cycle. The {{placement}} of these cycles is controversial. Historically {{there are enough}} evidences to fix the sabbatical years in the Second Temple Period. But it may not match with the sabbatical cycle derived from the biblical period; {{and there is no}} consensus on whether or not the Jubilee <b>year</b> <b>is</b> the fiftieth <b>year</b> or {{the latter half of the}} forty ninth year.|$|R
5|$|The Atlantic Coast Conference Men's Basketball Player of the <b>Year</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{basketball}} award {{given to}} the men's basketball player in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) voted as the most outstanding player.

25|$|A web-based candlepin program, shot at Riverwalk Lanes in Amesbury, Massachusetts. Classic Candlepins also airs {{on local}} access TV stations. The {{show is a}} ladder-based tournament with five seeds.

The first ladder of the new <b>year</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> women's ladder, {{and at the end of}} the year, all of the ladder champions (including the champion of the women's ladder) are entered into a tournament of champions. The first tournament of champions was won by Mark Ricci.|$|E
25|$|After the {{bachelor}} courses, students {{are allowed to}} enter the 'master in medicine' courses, which consist of 4 years of theoretical and clinical study. In general, the first 2 master years are very theoretical and teach the students in human pathology, diseases, pharmacology. The third <b>year</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> year full of internships {{in a wide range}} of specialities in different clinics. The seventh, final year serves as a kind of 'pre-specialization' year in which the students are specifically trained in the specialty they wish to pursue after medical school. This contrasts with the Dutch approach, in which graduates are literally 'basic doctors' (basisartsen) who have yet to decide on a specialty.|$|E

25|$|Christmas {{music is}} a popular stunt format, used when a station is {{transitioning}} to a different format. For instance, a rock music station changing to a rhythmic oldies format will often air Christmas music in-between. This can occur at times when Christmas music seems out of place, such as in summer. The end of the calendar <b>year</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> common time of year for format switches. As such, Christmas music may be aired for a prolonged period of time from as early as October and/or extend as late as New Year's Day, while the station prepares the switch. Conversely, when 94.9 in Atlanta changed from adult contemporary to country music {{in the middle of}} December 2006, it abruptly stopped playing its annual Christmas music a week before the holiday.|$|E
25|$|According to Greek law, every Sunday of the <b>year</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> public holiday. Since {{the late}} '70s, Saturday {{also is a}} non school and not working day. In addition, there are four {{mandatory}} official public holidays: 25 March (Greek Independence Day), Easter Monday, 15 August (Assumption or Dormition of the Holy Virgin), and 25 December (Christmas). 1 May (Labour Day) and 28 October (Ohi Day) are regulated by law as being optional but it is customary for employees {{to be given the}} day off. There are, however, more public holidays celebrated in Greece than are announced by the Ministry of Labour each year as either obligatory or optional. The list of these non-fixed national holidays rarely changes and has not changed in recent decades, giving a total of eleven national holidays each year.|$|E
25|$|Air {{pollution}} hotspots {{are areas}} where air pollution emissions expose individuals to increased negative health effects. They are particularly common in highly populated, urban areas, where {{there may be}} a combination of stationary sources (e.g. industrial facilities) and mobile sources (e.g. cars and trucks) of pollution. Emissions from these sources can cause respiratory disease, childhood asthma, cancer, and other health problems. Fine particulate matter such as diesel soot, which contributes to more than 3.2 million premature deaths around the world each <b>year,</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> significant problem. It is very small and can lodge itself within the lungs and enter the bloodstream. Diesel soot is concentrated in densely populated areas, and one in six people in the U.S. live near a diesel pollution hot spot.|$|E

25|$|The Coptic {{year is the}} {{extension}} of the ancient Egyptian civil year, retaining its subdivision into the three seasons, four months each. The three seasons are commemorated by special prayers in the Coptic Liturgy. This calendar is still in use all over Egypt by farmers {{to keep track of the}} various agricultural seasons. The Coptic calendar has 13 months, 12 of 30 days each and an intercalary month at the end of the year of 5 or 6 days, depending whether the <b>year</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> leap year or not. The year starts on 29 August in the Julian Calendar or on the 30th in the year before (Julian) Leap Years. The Coptic Leap Year follows the same rules as the Julian Calendar so that the extra month always has six days in the year before a Julian Leap Year.|$|E
25|$|Mostly, a <b>year</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{leap year}} {{if it is}} evenly {{divisible}} by four. A year divisible by 100, however, is not a leap year in the Gregorian calendar unless it is also divisible by 400. For example, 1600 was a leap year, but 1700, 1800 and 1900 were not. Some programs may have relied on the oversimplified rule that a year divisible by four is a leap year. This method works fine for the year 2000 (because it is a leap year), and will not become a problem until 2100, when older legacy programs will likely have long since been replaced. Other programs contained incorrect leap year logic, assuming for instance that no year divisible by 100 could be a leap year. An assessment of this leap year problem including a number of real life code fragments appeared in 1998. For information on why century years are treated differently, see Gregorian calendar.|$|E
25|$|Until 1834, the Bank of England {{observed}} about 33 saints' {{days and}} religious festivals as holidays, {{but in that}} year this was reduced to four: 1 May (May Day), 1 November (All Saints' Day), Good Friday and Christmas Day. In 1871, the first legislation relating to bank holidays was passed when Liberal politician and banker Sir John Lubbock introduced the Bank Holidays Act 1871, which specified the days in the table below. Under the Act, no person was compelled to make any payment or to do any act upon a bank holiday which {{he would not be}} compelled to do or make on Christmas Day or Good Friday, and the making of a payment or the doing of an act on the following day was equivalent to doing it on the holiday. People were so grateful that some called the first Bank Holidays St Lubbock's Days for a while. Scotland was treated separately because of its separate traditions: for example, New <b>Year</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> more important holiday there.|$|E
