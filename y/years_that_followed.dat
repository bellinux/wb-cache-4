5|$|By 1963, when President John F. Kennedy began pushing Congress {{to finally}} build the Fort Circle Drive, many in Washington and the National Park Service were openly {{questioning}} whether the plan had outgrown its usefulness. After all, by this time, Washington had grown past {{the ring of}} forts that had protected it a century earlier, and city surface roads already connected the parks, albeit not in as linear a route as envisioned. The plan to link Fort Stanton Park with other fort parks via a grand drive was quietly dropped in the <b>years</b> <b>that</b> <b>followed.</b>|$|E

Tariffs, {{a major issue in}} the campaign, remained largely unchanged in the four <b>years</b> <b>that</b> <b>followed,</b> although Congress did pass a minor revision that reduced them by an average of less than 2 percent.
