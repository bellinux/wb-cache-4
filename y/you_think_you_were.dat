6000|$|... "'American dog!' {{the girl}} said, {{with her eyes}} {{flashing}} with rage, 'did <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> so good-looking that {{the women of the}} nation you tread upon are all to lose their hearts to you? We are Mexicans, and we hate you!' and she stamped her foot with passion.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's possible; {{but he told}} me {{that you}} had let The Firs to Mrs. Olcott for ten pounds less than he could easily have obtained. As he's a talkative fellow and nothing is kept secret here, do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> wise in letting her have the place below its value?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "How did <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> to live? But it is {{altogether}} unnecessary {{to speak}} of such a matter as that. There are so many reasons to make this impossible, {{that it would be}} useless to discuss one as being more important than others. Has any other one of my family known of this?" [...] This he added, wishing to ascertain whether Lord Silverbridge had disgraced himself by lending his hand to such a disposition of his sister.|$|E
6000|$|He watched Barnaby {{fill his}} glass, and so {{soon as he}} had done so began {{immediately}} by saying: [...] "I do suppose <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> treated mightily ill to be so handled last night. Well, so you were treated ill enough--though who hit you that crack upon the head I know no more than a child unborn. Well, I am sorry for the way you were handled, but there is this much to say, and of that you may believe me, that nothing was meant to you but kindness, and before you are through with us all you will believe that well enough." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "We {{will try}} {{the plan for}} one fortnight," [...] she continued. [...] "So now remember, every single time that I hear you disputing or quarrelling with Amelia, you must take off your jacket {{and put it on}} again wrong side out--no matter whether <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> to blame or not--and wear it so a few minutes. You can wear it so for a longer or shorter time, just as you think is best to make the {{punishment}} effectual in curing you of the fault. By the end of the fortnight we shall be able to see whether the plan is working well and doing any good." ...|$|E
6000|$|To this Barnaby made no reply, but, {{what with}} wonder and the {{dizziness}} of his head, seated {{himself at the}} table over against his interlocutor, who pushed a bottle of rum towards him, together with a glass from the hanging rack. He watched Barnaby fill his glass, and so soon {{as he had done}} so began immediately by saying: [...] "I do suppose <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> treated mightily ill to be so handled last night. Well, so you were treated ill enough, though who hit you that crack upon the head I know no more than a child unborn. Well, I am sorry for the way you were handled, but there is this much to say, and of that you may feel well assured, that nothing was meant to you but kindness, and before you are through with us all you will believe that without my having to tell you so." ...|$|E
6000|$|He, of course, {{was one of}} the {{systematic}} scoffers, one of those to whom she said--"Do you know how you strike me? You strike me as men who are starving to death while they have a cupboard at home, all full of bread and meat and wine; or as blind, demented beings who let themselves be cast into a debtor's prison, while in their pocket they have the key of vaults and treasure-chests heaped up with gold and silver. The meat and wine, the gold and silver," [...] Verena went on, [...] "are simply the suppressed and wasted force, the precious sovereign remedy, of which society insanely deprives itself--the genius, the intelligence, the inspiration of women. It is dying, inch by inch, in the midst of old superstitions which it invokes in vain, and yet it has the elixir of life in its hands. Let it drink but a draught, and it will bloom once more; it will be refreshed, radiant; it will find its youth again. The heart, the heart is cold, and nothing but the touch of woman can warm it, make it act. We are the Heart of humanity, and let us have the courage to insist on it! The public life of the world will move in the same barren, mechanical, vicious circle--the circle of egotism, cruelty, ferocity, jealousy, greed, of blind striving to do things only for some, at the cost of others, instead of trying to do everything for all. All, all? Who dares to say 'all' when we are not there? We are an equal, a splendid, an inestimable part. Try us and you'll see--you will wonder how, without us, society has ever dragged itself even this distance--so wretchedly small compared with what it might have been--on its painful earthly pilgrimage. That is what I should like above all to pour into the ears of those who still hold out, who stiffen their necks and repeat hard, empty formulas, which are as dry as a broken gourd that has been flung away in the desert. I would take them by their selfishness, their indolence, their interest. I am not here to recriminate, nor to deepen the gulf that already yawns between the sexes, and I don't accept the doctrine that they are natural enemies, since my plea is for a union far more intimate--provided it be equal--than any that the sages and philosophers of former times have ever dreamed of. Therefore I shall not touch upon the subject of men's being most easily influenced by considerations of what is most agreeable and profitable for them; I shall simply assume that they are so influenced, and I shall say to them that our cause would long ago have been gained if their vision were not so dim, so veiled, even in matters in which their own interests are concerned. If they had the same quick sight as women, if they had the intelligence of the heart, the world would be very different now; and I assure you that half the bitterness of our lot is to see so clearly and {{not to be able to}} do! Good gentlemen all, if I could make you believe how much brighter and fairer and sweeter the garden of life would be for you, if you would only let us help you to keep it in order! You would like so much better to walk there, and you would find grass and trees and flowers that would make <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> in Eden. That is what I should like to press home to each of you, personally, individually--to give him the vision of the world as it hangs perpetually before me, redeemed, transfigured, by a new moral tone. There would be generosity, tenderness, sympathy, where there is now only brute force and sordid rivalry. But you really do strike me as stupid even about your own welfare! Some of you say that we have already all the influence we can possibly require, and talk as if we ought to be grateful that we are allowed even to breathe. Pray, who shall judge what we require if not we ourselves? We require simply freedom; we require the lid to be taken off the box in which we have been kept for centuries. You say it's a very comfortable, cozy, convenient box, with nice glass sides, so that we can see out, and that all that's wanted is to give another quiet turn to the key. That is very easily answered. Good gentlemen, you have never been in the box, and you haven't the least idea how it feels!" ...|$|E

Trailer had a minor but memorable role as a doctor in the 1990 Cher/Winona Ryder movie Mermaids, saying to Ryder's character, [...] "Then why did <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> pregnant?
