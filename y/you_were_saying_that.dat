6000|$|... "Because I knew <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> to yourself, lad, {{so there}} was no need for me to say it," [...] {{returned}} his friend, with a side-glance and a twinkle of the eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why {{do you go}} at all?" [...] she asked. [...] "These {{people are}} of no further use to you. Only the other day, <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> you should not accept any more outside cases." ...|$|E
60|$|CUSINS [sweetly] <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> as Mr Undershaft has {{not seen}} his {{children}} since they were babies, he will form his opinion {{of the way you}} have brought them up from their behavior to-night, and that therefore you wish us all to be particularly careful to conduct ourselves well, especially Charles.|$|E
30|$|Facilitator: Ah, okay, so <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> {{students}} can {{just sit back}} and then not do anything—ah, she could—.|$|R
6000|$|FAULKLAND Well, sir, but <b>you</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> Miss Melville {{has been}} so {{exceedingly}} well--what then she has been merry and gay, I suppose?--Always in spirits--hey? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'For your sake, my darling; {{for your}} sake,--for your sake! How shall I comfort you when all those around <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> not my wife?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh yes, there are," [...] Ezra Girdlestone remarked, {{coming into}} the room. He had been {{standing}} between the two doors {{which led to the}} counting-house, and had overheard the latter portion of the conversation. [...] "Don't let me interrupt you. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> you would blacken my father's character unless he increased your salary." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed? Odd, wasn't it? But <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> {{you thought}} I {{dropped from the}} sky. Why, I had been {{following}} you for five minutes before! What {{do you think of}} that? If I may take the liberty of asking, {{how did you come to}} be walking round Soho at such an hour with a little ragged boy?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "God forbid!" [...] I involuntarily ejaculated, for somehow I was {{not looking}} for that form of question, and it caught me a little off my guard. But I hastened to make amends for my rudeness, and say, [...] "I simply meant I had not had the honor--for I would not {{deliberately}} speak discourteously {{of a friend of}} yours. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> you were robbed--and it was a shame, too--but it appears by what is left of the shroud you have on that it was a costly one in its day. How did--" ...|$|E
60|$|BURGE [testily] I {{wish you}} would come to your point. Half the time <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> must have {{principles}}; and when I offer you principles you say they wont work.|$|R
5000|$|... "So <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> human {{agreement}} {{decides what}} is false {{and what is}} true?" [...] -- It is what human beings <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> false and true; and they agree in the language they use. That is not agreement in opinions but in form of life. (Wittgenstein, Philosophical Investigations, para. 241 not in original) ...|$|R
6000|$|The message {{inside was}} {{expressed}} in these terms: [...] "I am as deeply {{interested in her}} as <b>you</b> <b>are.</b> <b>Say</b> <b>that</b> I have received her letter, and that I welcome {{her back to the}} Refuge with all my heart. I have business this evening in the neighborhood. I will call for her myself at Mablethorpe House." ...|$|R
60|$|SMITH. I {{object to}} a quarrel {{because it always}} {{interrupts}} an argument. May I bring you {{back for a moment}} to the argument? <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> these modern conjuring tricks are simply the old miracles when they have once been found out. But surely another view is possible. When we speak of things being sham, we generally mean that they are imitations of things that are genuine. Take that Reynolds over there of the Duke's great-grandfather. [Points to a picture on the wall.] If I were to say it was a copy....|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! No, no, no," [...] said Miss Pritty, peeping out again; [...] "how {{could you}} bring these dreadful creatures to my remembrance so abruptly? I had quite {{forgotten}} {{them for the}} time. Why, oh why did you banish from my mind that sweet idea of a charming cottage by the sea, and all its little unluxurious elegancies, and call up in its place the h-h-horrors of that village-nest--pig-sty--of the dreadful buccaneers? But it can't be helped now," [...] added Miss Pritty, with a resigned shudder, [...] "and we have the greatest reason to be thankful that their hope of a good ransom made them treat us {{as well as they}} did;--but go on, dear, <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> it was fortunate that these p-pirates--" ...|$|E
5000|$|Socrates {{discusses}} {{the morality of}} rhetoric with Gorgias, asking him if rhetoric was just. Socrates catches the incongruity in Gorgias statements: [...] "well, {{at the time you}} said that, I took it that oratory would never be an unjust thing, since it always makes its speeches about justice. But when a little later <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> the orator could also use oratory unjustly, I was surprised and thought that your statements weren't consistent" [...] (461a). To this argument, Gorgias [...] "…is left wishing he could respond, knowing he cannot, and feeling frustrated and competitive. The effect of the 'proof' is not to persuade, but to disorient him".|$|E
6000|$|... "Mad or sane," [...] said Geoffrey, [...] "say {{those words}} {{once more and}} I will stamp {{the life out of}} <b>you</b> where <b>you</b> <b>are.</b> <b>You</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> God promised her to you--promised that woman to a hound like <b>you.</b> Ah, <b>be</b> careful!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not a bit," [...] said Pepper warmly. [...] "No {{man could}} ever have a harder or more unfeeling wife than <b>you</b> <b>was.</b> I’ll <b>say</b> <b>that</b> for <b>you,</b> willing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Touching {{the look}} of Una, <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying,</b> Bannadonna, <b>that</b> there <b>was</b> a certain law in art," [...] {{observed}} the chief, as the three now descended the stone shaft, [...] "pray, tell me, then--." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{bring your}} man in {{whenever}} you want to," [...] Norgate invited, as he turned away. [...] "I can promise, at least, that I shall not understand what <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying,</b> and <b>that</b> I won't sneak your designs." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, no," [...] said Michael, airily. [...] "It is {{a parable}}. It is a parable {{of you and}} all your rationalists. You begin by {{breaking}} up the Cross; but you end by breaking up the habitable world. We leave you <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> nobody ought to join the Church against his will. When we meet <b>you</b> again <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> no one has any will to join it with. We leave <b>you</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> there <b>is</b> no such place as Eden. We find <b>you</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> there <b>is</b> no such place as Ireland. You start by hating the irrational and you come to hate everything, for everything is irrational and so----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There you go again, mother! I {{guess if}} <b>you</b> <b>was</b> to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> {{to some of}} the lady ministers nowadays, you'd git {{yourself}} into trouble." [...] Mela looked round for approval, and gurgled out a hoarse laugh.|$|R
6000|$|... “You understand?” {{the latter}} insisted. “No {{preparations}} {{are to be}} made till we land in the morning. And <b>you</b> <b>are</b> to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Mr. Walter has gone off in a trading schooner on a round of the islands.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Bruce: [...] "What <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>saying</b> Barbara? <b>That</b> I {{should just}} hand Terry over to Shriek?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Que dis-tu ? Que Jean ne fait que manger. ("What <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>saying?</b> <b>That</b> Jean {{does nothing}} but eat.") ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Moreover, {{it happens}} that Governor Maguire is a {{personal}} friend of mine, and I shall call upon him {{and tell him that}} I have a sick friend staying with me and, without letting him know who <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I give him my word of honour that you will, while with me, remain in the grounds, and will make no inquiries concerning his fortifications and plans of defence. He will understand what I mean, and if anyone should make a report to him it will, at any rate, cause no trouble; though I do not <b>say</b> <b>that</b> he might not feel obliged to give me notice that you had best go.|$|R
6000|$|... "Here's half a dollar. If anybody asks where <b>you</b> have <b>been</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> to the Stock Exchange. I don't care {{to have a}} lot {{of people}} talking about my business, and a quarter should be enough to make you hold your tongue." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> {{hard work}} {{carrying}} the child," [...] he broke in in English; [...] "but I {{can tell you}} that I believe it aided me to get through. It gave me something to think of besides the snow, the distance, and the Russians. She was always cheerful and bright, and her merry talk lightened the way, but in addition to that the warmth of her body against my back by day and curled up in my arms at night, greatly helped to keep life in me. I think that it was largely due to her that I got through safely where many men as strong as myself died." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{must all}} shift aboard the brig," [...] he began, {{speaking}} quickly, [...] "and then {{we may get}} over this trouble without coming to blows. Now, if <b>you</b> <b>were</b> to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> wish it; that you feel unsafe in the yacht--don't you see?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>you</b> <b>are</b> always <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> Valeria H. Montague's {{stories are}} silly and not true to life, {{so that is}} no argument," [...] {{retorted}} Felicity, who knew more about cooking than about history, and evidently imagined that the Lady Jane Gray was one of Valeria's titled heroines.|$|R
6000|$|PURDIE (even in this supreme hour a man). Don't let go. Hold {{on to what}} we were doing, or {{we shall}} lose grip of ourselves. Devotion. Something about devotion. Hold on to devotion. 'If the dog-like devotion of a lifetime...' Which of <b>you</b> <b>was</b> I <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> to? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I guessed. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> {{going to}} <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I {{must have heard}} your criticisms in the train. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> very lenient, I thought." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{are plenty}} of young Frenchmen, prince. If you must choose one, why not take the Count de Laville? <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying,</b> but yesterday, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> liked him." ...|$|R
3000|$|T: Correct. In your writing, <b>you</b> <b>were</b> {{trying to}} <b>say</b> <b>that</b> {{something}} <b>was</b> not acceptable for your friend right. Something did not suit, right? [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not in the least," [...] rejoined Bénédict hastily--"a slight {{tickling}} in the throat. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying,</b> M. Joseph, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> hoped {{this new}} appointment would fall within your sphere of influence." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Or if {{questioned}} in any way,--say that I did it. Tell the exact truth. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> always <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> nothing but truth ever serves. Let the truth serve now. I shall not blench. Your saying {{it all in}} the House of Lords won't wound me half so much as your looking at me as you did just now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'My dear! You don't {{know what}} <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying.</b> <b>You</b> forget <b>that</b> this self-abandonment, and extravagant grief {{would be wrong}} in any one; and, if nothing else, the display is unbecoming in you.' ...|$|R
