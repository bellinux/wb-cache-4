Eimeria petrogale and Eimeria sharmani {{have been reported in}} P. lateralis; however, the presence of Eimeria godmani and Eimeria inornata expands the suite of eimerian species known in <b>rock</b> <b>wallabies</b> of the lateralis complex.

5000|$|The <b>yellow-footed</b> <b>rock</b> <b>wallaby</b> Petrogale xanthopus is {{recognized}} as a distinct sub-species in Queensland (Petrogale xanthopus celeris), and only occurs in rugged country in a triangular area between Adavale, Blackall and Stonehenge.

[...] The rocky ledges and overhangs of Yapunyah Waterhole provide habitat for yellow-footed rock wallabies and they are often observed drinking there.

50|$|Rockholes, ledges, {{overhangs}} and riparian zones at the waterhole {{provide a}} range of habitats for native flora and fauna, including the vulnerable <b>yellow-footed</b> <b>rock</b> <b>wallaby</b> and the endemic Cooper Creek Turtle. The Yapunyah waterhole is a healthy aquatic system with no evidence of introduced fish species, cane toads, weeds or feral mammals (such as pigs and goats). It has abundant wildlife and a unique environment that provides a refuge for native species to survive the dry times.|$|E
40|$|A {{surrogacy}} {{program to}} increase the reproductive rate of the critically endangered Victorian brush-tailed rock wallaby (Petrogale penicillata), initially developed in semicaptive conditions, was established in close captivity at Adelaide Zoological Gardens in 1998. Pouch young were removed from their mothers on days 8 - 20 or 40 - 45 after parturition and placed onto the teat of a tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii) or <b>yellow-footed</b> <b>rock</b> <b>wallaby</b> (Petrogale xanthopus xanthopus) surrogate mother. During {{the early years of}} the program, mortality of brush-tail pouch young was high (12 / 16, 75 %), both before transfer while still on their mother (5 / 16) and after transfer to a surrogate mother (7 / 11). Changing pouch young transfer methodology and improving the health status of the surrogate animals during the later years of the program significantly reduced the mortality of brush-tail pouch young (8 / 29). Under the new methodology, no mortality of brush-tail pouch young was observed between birth and the time of transfer, (0 / 29), and after transfer, pouch young mortality rate was eight of 29 (28 %). Factors implicated in the improved success of the program included 1) the early transfer (between days 8 and 20) of brush-tail pouch young from mother to surrogate mother, 2) review of the veterinary history and health of the animals selected to act as surrogate mothers, and 3) increased access to grazing pasture for foster mothers. The reproductive rate of the brush-tail females in the later years of the breeding program was sixfold above natural birthing rates. These and other factors important in establishing a breeding program of this nature are discussed...|$|E

5000|$|In {{areas where}} horses are abundant, macropod populations are less prevalent.
