2500|$|The 1980s {{game show}} Press Your Luck, {{well known for}} the Whammy {{stealing}} contestants' cash and prizes, had a female Whammy known as [...] "Tammy Whammette".

2500|$|On June 25, 2009, {{shortly after}} Michael Jackson {{had gone into}} cardiac arrest, Hilton posted {{an article about the}} star's illness, {{claiming}} it was a publicity stunt. Hilton's original post featured sarcastic comments such as [...] "Get <b>your</b> <b>money</b> <b>back,</b> ticket holders!!!!" [...] and [...] "Jacko pulled a similar stunt when he was getting ready for his big HBO special in '95 when he 'collapsed' at rehearsal!", in response to Jackson's recently sold out tour through March 2010. Upon realizing Michael Jackson's death was not a hoax, Hilton immediately deleted the original news post and replaced it with a shorter message that linked to a story at entertainment news site TMZ, which said the singer had in fact gone into cardiac arrest. Hilton has received backlash for the incident, becoming entangled in a Twitter argument with Pete Wentz about the situation.|$|E

[With intense conviction] I will never forgive you that. If I had a child, and you destroyed its body with your explosives--if you murdered Dolly with your horrible guns--I could forgive you if my forgiveness would open the gates of heaven to you. But to take a human soul from me, and turn it into the soul of a wolf! that is worse than any murder.|$|R
