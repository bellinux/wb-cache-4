25|$|Seamen of the {{battleship}} Bismarck! You have covered yourself with glory! The {{sinking of the}} battle cruiser Hood has not only military, but psychological value, for she was the pride of Great Britain. Henceforth the enemy will try to concentrate his forces and bring them into action against us. I therefore released Prinz Eugen at noon yesterday {{so that she could}} conduct commerce warfare on her own. She has managed to evade the enemy. We, on the other hand, because of the hits we have received, have been ordered to proceed to a French port. On our way there the enemy will gather and give us battle. The German people are with <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> will fight until our gun barrels glow red-hot and the last shell has left the barrels. For us, seamen, the question is victory or death.|$|E

500|$|In November 2015, Anonymous {{announced}} a major, sustained operation against ISIS following the November 2015 Paris attacks, declaring, [...] "Anonymous {{from all over}} the world will hunt you down. You should know that we will find <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> will not let you go." [...] ISIS responded on Telegram by calling them [...] "idiots", and asking [...] "What they [...] hack?" [...] By the next day, however, Anonymous claimed to have taken down 3,824 pro-ISIS Twitter accounts, and by the third, more than 5,000, and to have doxxed recruiters. A week later, Anonymous increased their claim to 20,000 accounts and released a list of the accounts. The list included the Twitter accounts of Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, The New York Times and BBC News. The BBC reported that most of the accounts on the list appeared to be still active. A spokesman for Twitter told The Daily Dot that the company is not using the lists of accounts being reported by Anonymous, as they have been found to be “wildly inaccurate” and include accounts used by academics and journalists.|$|E
500|$|Khurshid Pasha {{dispatched}} Emir Yusuf Ali Murad, a Maronite sheikh {{from the}} Abu'l Lama family, {{to rein in}} peasant rebels in Jubail, but Shahin sent a letter warning Emir Yusuf not to [...] "intervene in the affairs" [...] of Jubail because the [...] "Christians of Jubail were united with the ahali of Keserwan" [...] and claimed that [...] "all the Christians of Syria have made common cause". He condemned Emir Yusuf for aligning himself with the ousted sheikhs and his [...] "Druze relatives" [...] and accused him of attempting to [...] "subjugate the Christians after we achieved our [...] ". He threatened Emir Yusuf to [...] "return without delay" [...] and that if he [...] "desires a fight, we are more eager than <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> are not afraid". Shahin's confidence in the support he received from the Christian peasantry of Keserwan {{and other parts of}} Mount Lebanon and his challenge to Emir Yusuf through a populist sectarian approach alarmed the Maronite elites, the church and the Ottoman authorities.|$|E
500|$|Digby {{was tried}} {{on the same}} day as seven of his {{surviving}} co-conspirators, in Westminster Hall, on Monday 27 January 1606. [...] As the king and his family watched in secret, the charges against the plotters were read aloud. [...] Alone amongst them Digby pleaded [...] "Guilty", and was tried on a separate indictment. [...] Dressed in a black satin suit and [...] "tuff taffetie gown", he gave a short and moving speech, defending his actions by explaining his affection for Catesby, and the cause of his religion. [...] He accused King James of reneging on his promises of toleration for Catholics, and told of his fears of harsher laws against recusancy. [...] He also pleaded on behalf of his family, that they should not pay for his actions, before making a final request to be beheaded. [...] His words fell on mostly deaf ears. [...] The prosecution poured scorn on James's supposed perfidy, and ridiculed Digby for asking for leniency where he would have given none. [...] Along with the other plotters, he was found guilty. [...] As they were led from the hall, Digby exclaimed: [...] "If I may but hear any of your lordships say, you forgive me, I shall go more cheerfully to the gallows." [...] The reply came back, [...] "God forgive <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> do." ...|$|E

500|$|Leonard Nimoy as Spock Prime: Nimoy reprises {{the role}} of the older Spock from the {{original}} Star Trek timeline, credited as [...] "Spock Prime". He was a longtime friend of Abrams' parents, but became better acquainted with Abrams during filming. Although Quinto watched some episodes of the show during breaks in filming, Nimoy was his main resource in playing Spock. Abrams and the writers met Nimoy at his house; writer Roberto Orci recalled that the actor gave a Who are you guys and what are you up to?' vibe" [...] before being told how important he was to them. He was silent, and Nimoy's wife Susan Bay told the creative team he had remained in his chair after their conversation, emotionally overwhelmed by his decision after turning down many opportunities to revisit the role. Had Nimoy disliked the script, production would have been delayed for it to be rewritten. Nimoy later said, [...] "This is the first and only time I ever had a filmmaker say, 'We cannot make this film without <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> won't make it without you'". He was [...] "genuinely excited" [...] by the script's scope and its detailing of the characters' backstories, saying, [...] "We have dealt with , but never with quite the overview that this script has of the entire history of the character, the growth of the character, the beginnings of the character and the arrival of the character into the Enterprise crew." [...] Abrams commented, [...] "It was surreal to direct him as Spock, because what the hell am I doing there? This guy has been doing it for forty years. It's like 'I think Spock would...|$|E

[...] He {{was to be}} [...] "put to death halfway between heaven and earth as unworthy of both". [...] His genitals would be cut off and burnt before his eyes, and his bowels and heart then removed. [...] Then he would be decapitated, and the dismembered parts of his body displayed {{so that they might}} become [...] "prey for the fowls of the air". [...] Confessions and declarations from the prisoners were then read aloud, and finally the prisoners were allowed to speak. [...] Rookwood claimed that he had been drawn into the plot by Catesby, [...] "whom he loved above any worldy man". [...] Thomas Wintour begged to be hanged for himself and his brother, so that his brother might be spared. [...] Fawkes explained his not guilty plea as ignorance of certain aspects of the indictment. [...] Keyes appeared to accept his fate, Bates and Robert Wintour begged for mercy, and Grant explained his involvement as [...] "a conspiracy intended but never effected". [...] Only Digby, tried on a separate indictment, pleaded guilty, insisting that the King had reneged upon promises of toleration for Catholics, and that affection for Catesby and love of the Catholic cause mitigated his actions. [...] He sought death by the axe and begged mercy from the King for his young family. [...] His defence was in vain; his arguments were rebuked by Coke and Northumberland, and along with his seven co-conspirators, he was found guilty by the jury of high treason. [...] Digby shouted [...] "If I may but hear any of your lordships say, you forgive me, I shall go more cheerfully to the gallows." [...] The response was short: [...] "God forgive <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> do." ...|$|E

2500|$|... company, {{independent}} of the HAS [...] but fed by the HAS. We don't want a clinic. We want one in operation but not in name. Perhaps we could call it a Spiritual Guidance Center.

It is a problem of practical business. I await your reaction on the religion angle. In my opinion, we couldn't get worse public opinion than we have had or have less customers with what we've got to sell. A religious charter would be necessary in Pennsylvania or NJ to make it stick. But I sure could make it stick. We're treating the present time beingness, psychotherapy treats the past and the brain. And brother, that's religion, not mental science.|$|E
