25|$|The {{cooking time}} depends {{primarily}} on the equipment being used, the amount of sunlight at the time, and the quantity of food {{that needs to be}} cooked. Air temperature, wind, and latitude also affect performance. Food cooks faster in the two hours before and after the local solar noon than it does in either the early morning or the late afternoon. Large quantities of food, and food in large pieces, take longer to cook. As a result, only general figures can be given for cooking time. With a small solar panel cooker, {{it might be possible to}} melt butter in 15 minutes, to bake cookies in 2 hours, and to cook rice for four people in 4 hours. With a high performing parabolic solar cooker, <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> grill a steak in minutes. However, depending on local conditions and the solar cooker type, these projects could take half as long, or twice as long.|$|E

Alcala's attorneys contested it; as one of them explained, [...] "If you're a juror and you hear one murder case, <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> have reasonable doubt. But it's very hard to say you have reasonable doubt on all five, especially when four of the five aren't alleged by eyewitnesses but are proven by DNA matches." [...] In 2006, the California Supreme Court ruled in the prosecution's favor, and in February 2010 Alcala stood trial on the five joined charges.|$|E
