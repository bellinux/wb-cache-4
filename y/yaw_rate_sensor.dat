50|$|Yaw dampers usually {{consist of}} a <b>yaw</b> <b>rate</b> <b>sensor</b> (either a {{gyroscope}} or angular accelerometer), a computer/amplifier and a servo actuator. The yaw damper uses <b>yaw</b> <b>rate</b> <b>sensor</b> to sense when the aircraft begins a Dutch roll. A computer processes the signals from the <b>yaw</b> <b>rate</b> <b>sensor</b> to {{determine the amount of}} rudder movement that is required to dampen out the Dutch roll. The computer then commands the servo actuator to move the rudder that amount. The Dutch roll is dampened out and the aircraft becomes stable about the yaw axis. Because Dutch roll is an instability that is inherent to all swept-wing aircraft, most swept-wing aircraft have some sort of yaw damper system installed.|$|E

Braking can be controlled to obtain optimal damping at each tire based on information from four wheel-speed sensors and steering wheel angle sensor.

50|$|The use {{of engine}} torque and brake {{pressure}} {{information in the}} regulation of the ACD and AYC components allows the S-AWC system to determine more quickly whether the vehicle is accelerating or decelerating. S-AWC also employs <b>yaw</b> <b>rate</b> feedback for the first time. The system helps the driver follow his chosen line more closely by comparing how the car is running, as determined from data from the <b>yaw</b> <b>rate</b> <b>sensors,</b> and how the driver wants it to behave, as determined from steering inputs, and operates accordingly to correct any divergence. The addition of braking force regulation to AYC's main role of transferring torque between {{the right and left}} wheels allows S-AWC to exert more control over vehicle behavior in on-the-limit driving situations. Increasing braking force on the inside wheel during understeer and on the outer wheel during oversteer situations, AYC's new braking force control feature works in conjunction with torque transfer regulation to realize higher levels of cornering performance and vehicle stability.|$|R

40|$|An {{approach}} to MEMS Computer Aided Design tools {{has been to}} make use of Integrated Circuits CAD suites with specific enhancements for MEMS designs. Extending the IC Design Rule Checkers to non-Manhattan shapes is one of these needed enhancements. IF anecdotally used in IC designs, non-manhattan shapes are intensively used in todays state of the art MEMS products. High performance gyroscopes and <b>yaw</b> <b>rate</b> <b>sensors</b> made in surface micromachining processes feature spiral springs and torsional combdrives made of toroidal fingers. Applying classical DRCs to these layouts generate thousands of false errors. The errors are false because they do not affect the manufacturability of the device. But because of their number, they prevent the designers from detecting real errors in their layout. Most false errors are generated by rounding floating point vertices' coordinates, translating different data types and snapping points to a grid. This paper presents a new methodology to eliminate false errors generated by the DRC of non-manhattan shapes. This methodology includes adding a tolerance factor to Microsystem design rules with respect to the geometric properties of non-manhattan shapes and the manufacturing grid parameters, closely controlling the vertices coordinates when automatically generating the non manhattan shapes and controlling the snapping on the grid. This methodology has been implemented in MEMSCAP Microsystem engineering kits and has been validated for three foundry design rules: BOSCH, SensoNor, and AM...|$|R
40|$|A {{reliable}} {{perception of}} the real world is a key-feature for an autonomous vehicle and the Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). Obstacles detection (OD) {{is one of the main}} components for the correct reconstruction of the dynamic world. Historical approaches based on stereo vision and other 3 D perception technologies (e. g. LIDAR) have been adapted to the ADAS first and autonomous ground vehicles, after, providing excellent results. The obstacles detection is a very broad field and this domain counts a lot of works in the last years. In academic research, it has been clearly established the essential role of these systems to realize active safety systems for accident prevention, reflecting also the innovative systems introduced by industry. These systems need to accurately assess situational criticalities and simultaneously assess awareness of these criticalities by the driver; it requires that the obstacles detection algorithms must be reliable and accurate, providing: a real-time output, a stable and robust representation of the environment and an estimation independent from lighting and weather conditions. Initial systems relied on only one exteroceptive sensor (e. g. radar or laser for ACC and camera for LDW) in addition to proprioceptive sensors such as wheel speed and <b>yaw</b> <b>rate</b> <b>sensors.</b> But, current systems, such as ACC operating at the entire speed range or autonomous braking for collision avoidance, require the use of multiple sensors since individually they can not meet these requirements. It has led the community to move towards the use of a combination of them in order to exploit the benefits of each one. Pedestrians and vehicles detection are ones of the major thrusts in situational criticalities assessment, still remaining an active area of research. ADASs are the most prominent use case of pedestrians and vehicles detection. Vehicles should be equipped with sensing capabilities able to detect and act on objects in dangerous situations, where the driver would not be able to avoid a collision. A full ADAS or autonomous vehicle, with regard to pedestrians and vehicles, would not only include detection but also tracking, orientation, intent analysis, and collision prediction. The system detects obstacles using a probabilistic occupancy grid built from a multi-resolution disparity map. Obstacles classification is based on an AdaBoost SoftCascade trained on Aggregate Channel Features. A final stage of tracking and fusion guarantees stability and robustness to the result...|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{estimation}} of the vehicle sideslip angle is fundamental in vehicle dynamics control and stability. In this paper two different methods for vehicle sideslip estimation, based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Neural Networks (NN), are presented comparing the procedure responses with full-scale vehicle acquired test data.

50|$|Active Yaw Control uses a torque {{transfer}} {{mechanism in}} the rear differential to control rear wheel torque differential for different driving conditions and so limit the yaw moment that acts on the vehicle body and enhance cornering performance.

In its latest form, AYC now features yaw rate feedback control using a <b>yaw</b> <b>rate</b> <b>sensor</b> and also gains braking force control. Accurately determining the cornering dynamics on a realtime basis, the system operates to control vehicle behavior through corners and realize vehicle behavior that more closely mirrors driver intent.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{covers the}} {{introduction}} of a controller area network (CAN) to a house trailer or caravan. The past two decades have seen a large invasion of micro-controllers in modern vehicles. This {{is due in part to}} the miniaturization and decrease in costs of electronics, but also for the increase of services. These services include comfort, safety, diagnostics and fail-safes. Comfort such as controlled temperature or automatic wipers. Safety has the form of anti-lock braking systems (ABS) and electronic stability program (ESP). Diagnostics address the detection of failed systems or the failure of one of its components, while fail-safes enables the systems to achieve a graceful degradation of performance when parts of the system have failed. The increase of electronic control units (ECUs) has resulted in an increase of wiring, which is very expensive and also weights much. Those also are two issues undesirable on a caravan where ECUs can bring an increase of services. The answer to the problem has been the development of a communication network between the ECUs through which messages are sent. The ECUs are referred to as nodes on the network. The system developed consists of four nodes connected together with the Controller Area Network (CAN) : front and rear control units, a combined <b>yaw</b> <b>rate</b> and acceleration <b>sensor</b> and a control panel. As a whole, this base system controls all the lights on the outside of the caravan that are normally connected directly to the car. The most important benefit of this system is the cable reduction, but another advantage is the possibility to control the outdoor lights from the control panel. The front control unit converts the light signals coming from the car to CAN-bus messages. The rear control unit receives these messages and converts them back to light signals. On the same bus and at the same time the control panel can monitor the status of the light bulbs in the tail light ramp. Furthermore the control panel can send dimmer control messages to maneuver the dimmer output on the front control unit. In addition to this, the system contains an in and outdoor temperature <b>sensor,</b> a <b>yaw</b> <b>rate</b> and acceleration <b>sensor.</b> All of this information is available on the CAN-bus and presented on the display in the control panel.

5000|$|EBD {{may work}} in {{conjunction}} with ABS and Electronic Stability Control (ESC) to minimize yaw accelerations during turns. ESC compares the steering wheel angle to vehicle turning rate using a <b>yaw</b> <b>rate</b> <b>sensor.</b> [...] "Yaw" [...] is the vehicle's rotation around its vertical center of gravity (turning left or right). If the yaw sensor detects more/less yaw than the steering wheel angle should create, the car is understeering or oversteering and ESC activates one of the front or rear brakes to rotate the car back onto its intended course. For example, if a car is making a left turn and begins to understeer (the car plows forward {{to the outside of}} the turn) ESC activates the left rear brake, which will help turn the car left. The sensors are so sensitive, and the actuation is so quick that the system may correct direction before the driver reacts. ABS helps prevent wheel lock-up and EBD helps apply appropriate brake force to make ESC work effectively and easily.|$|E

40|$|Road vehicle yaw {{stability}} {{control systems}} like {{electronic stability program}} (ESP) are important active safety systems used for maintaining lateral stability of the vehicle. Vehicle yaw rate is the key parameter {{that needs to be}} known by a yaw stability control system. In this paper, yaw rate is estimated using a virtual sensor which contains kinematic relations and a velocity-scheduled Kalman filter. Kinematic estimation is carried out using wheel speeds, dynamic tire radius, and front wheel steering angle. In addition, a velocity-scheduled Kalman filter utilizing the linearized single-track model of the road vehicle is used in the dynamic estimation part of the virtual sensor. The designed virtual sensor is successfully tested offline using a validated, high degrees of freedom, and high fidelity vehicle model and using hardware-in-the-loop simulations.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we present}} {{the design and}} {{characterization}} of a vibratory yaw rate MEMS sensor that uses in-plane motion for both actuation and sensing. The design criterion for the rate sensor {{is based on a}} high sensitivity and low bandwidth. The required sensitivity of the <b>yaw</b> <b>rate</b> <b>sensor</b> is attained by using the in-plane motion in which the dominant damping mechanism is the fluid loss due to slide film damping i. e. two–three orders of magnitude less than the squeeze-film damping in other rate sensors with out-of-plane motion. The low bandwidth is achieved by matching the drive and the sense mode frequencies. Based on these factors, the <b>yaw</b> <b>rate</b> <b>sensor</b> is designed and finally realized using surface micromachining. The in-plane motion of the sensor is experimentally characterized to determine the sense and the drive mode frequencies, and corresponding damping ratios. It is found that the experimental results match well with the numerical and the analytical models with less than 5 % error in frequencies measurements. The measured quality factor of the sensor is approximately 467, which is two orders of magnitude higher than that for a similar rate sensor with out-of-plane sense direction...|$|E
