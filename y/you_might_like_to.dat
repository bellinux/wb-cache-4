It took another 48 years for women to finally gain the right to vote. Thank you for paving the way." [...] The city of Rochester put pictures of the message on Twitter and requested that residents go to Anthony's grave to sign it.|$|E

6000|$|... "Ah, this is {{the second}} volume, I see, else <b>you</b> <b>might</b> have <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> take it home with you. I put it in my pocket because I am {{studying}} a scene for a picture." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{were afraid}} you were hurt badly, and we thought--we thought <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> see Idella--and so--we came. She {{is in the}} next room." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I'll try and run in when I'm back in Sheffield. Happen <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> see my brother-in-law? He {{works in}} Pyecrofts." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Wrenn implored: [...] "I--uh--I thought <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> look {{at these}} magazines. Just dropped in to give them to you." [...] He was ready to go.|$|E

6000|$|... "He hasn't {{been at it}} very long, but I'm sure he'll get on. He's immensely {{in earnest}} and very good-looking.

6000|$|... "They all do. Frank {{could not}} talk of it. Gus wouldn't {{go home to}} tea, he was so anxious to do {{something}} for us. Joe brought back the bits of your poor sled, because he didn't <b>like</b> <b>to</b> leave them lying round for any one to carry off, he said, and <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>like</b> them <b>to</b> remember your fall by." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sorry {{to disturb}} you, old fellow," [...] he said, [...] "but {{there is a}} most curious sky effect behind us which I thought <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> see." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Lee,' {{said the}} Bishop, when that worthy appeared, 'I {{wanted to see}} you, to tell you you're playing for the House against Webster's. Thought <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> know.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have looked}} into it; {{it seems to}} be a history of her {{thoughts}} and theories. Facts are very briefly noted. It occurred to me that <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> read it. Why not?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I’ve got {{a couple}} of monkeys and a bear aboard, which I ’m taking to a menagerie in Aberdeen," [...] {{continued}} the captain, [...] "and the thought struck me <b>you</b> <b>might</b> possibly <b>like</b> <b>to</b> see ’em."

6000|$|... "I thought, gentlemen," [...] Nat said, [...] "that <b>you</b> <b>might</b> perhaps <b>like</b> <b>to</b> ask me {{questions}} upon any point {{that was not}} explained in the commandant's report, which was, as he told me, drawn up in great haste; for with four-fifths of the town laid in ashes, and the population homeless and unprovided with food, his hands were full indeed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's so early, sir," [...] said Brownster, [...] "that she said--I mean, sir, I {{thought that}} <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>like</b> {{something}} <b>to</b> eat, {{and if you}} want to enjoy a cigar before retiring, as many gentlemen do, you need not mind smoking here.

6000|$|... "I asked Mr. Pratt to {{meet you}} this evening, Mr. Montague," [...] he said, [...] "not knowing that you were {{previously}} acquainted, but thinking that <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> put your latest scheme before him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why,' {{said the}} Dodo, 'the {{best way to}} explain it is to do it.' (And, as <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> try the thing yourself, some winter day, I {{will tell you how}} the Dodo managed it.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I was thinking,' {{continued}} Mr. Beeton, {{still making}} {{as if to}} go, 'that <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> hear my boy Alf read you the papers sometimes of an evening. He do read beautiful, seeing he's only nine.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You see, Sir Guy,' said he, 'there {{was some}} of us thought <b>you</b> <b>might</b> not <b>like</b> <b>to</b> have us coming and singing like old times, 'cause 'tis not all {{as it used to}} be here with you. Yet we didn't <b>like</b> not <b>to</b> come at all, when you had been away so long, so we settled just to begin, and see whether you took any notice.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, very well. I {{certainly}} {{knew that}} you were going out of town.

Good morning, Lady Mason; I hope you may be successful in your--lawsuit." [...] And then, curtsying to her husband's client, she prepared to withdraw.|$|R
6000|$|... "No;--I didn't mean that. Of {{course that}} must be just as <b>you</b> <b>might</b> come <b>to</b> <b>like</b> any one well enough. But a person need not shut himself up and be a hermit {{because he is not}} married. Lord Rufford is not married and he goes everywhere." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, I {{only thought}} that after your long journey <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> wash. The roads are so muddy, after the winter's rains. I could rub your shell for you till it {{was bright and}} shining again.|$|E

60|$|MY DEAR BURLINGAME,--I find {{among my}} grandfather's papers his own reminiscences of his voyage round the north with Sir Walter, eighty years ago, labuntur anni! They are not remarkably good, {{but he was}} not a bad observer, and several touches seem to me speaking. It has {{occurred}} <b>to</b> me <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>like</b> them <b>to</b> appear in the Magazine. If you would, kindly let me know, and tell me how you would like it handled. My grandad's MS. runs to between six and seven thousand words, which I could abbreviate of anecdotes that scarce touch Sir W. Would you like this done? Would you <b>like</b> me <b>to</b> introduce the old gentleman? I had something of the sort in my mind, and could fill a few columns rather à propos. I give you the first offer of this, according to your request; for though it may forestall one of the interests of my biography, the thing seems to me particularly suited for prior appearance in a magazine.|$|R

Don't you think that in time <b>you</b> <b>might</b> come <b>to</b> <b>like</b> me a little bit?" ...|$|R
