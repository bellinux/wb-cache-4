Ann explains her proficiency during Ron's self-defense training courses results from her strong interest in female-centric original movies on the women's television network Lifetime. While describing how Tom would react to the news that Jerry dislocated his shoulder reaching for a breakfast burrito, Leslie said, [...] "What would <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Klondike bar?

2500|$|In the Brooklyn office, Giles and O'Keefe tell a loan {{counselor}} {{they want}} to buy a house, and that an abusive pimp is [...] "aggressively" [...] pursuing Giles.

[...] The ACORN counselor advises her [...] "you get a tin if [...] is going to come beat you... you get a tin and bury it down in there and you put the money right in and you put grass over it and you don't tell a single soul." [...] When discussing getting a house and Giles' earnings, O'Keefe says that Giles is very honest and an ACORN counselor replies, [...] "honest {{is not going to get}} you the house that is why you probably been denied cause you probably going in saying." [...] Another stated to Giles, [...] "you can't say what <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> living." [...] For tax and banking purposes, and to establish a legitimate income and credit history, Giles was told she needed to start saying she was a [...] "freelancer". The ACORN employee also suggested that Giles open two accounts at separate banks, depositing no more than $500 each a week to ensure few eyebrows are raised.|$|E

[...] "When I was sick in that confounded Clipstone Street, I know the Colonel came to see me, and Newcome too, day after day, and night after night.

6000|$|The first {{authentic}} trace {{we have of}} him in {{this new}} part of his career, is filling the situation of an usher to a school, and even this employ he obtained with some difficulty, after <b>a</b> reference <b>for</b> <b>a</b> character to his friends in the University of Dublin. In the Vicar of Wakefield he makes George Primrose undergo a whimsical catechism concerning the requisites <b>for</b> <b>an</b> usher. [...] "Have you been bred apprentice to the business?" [...] "No." [...] "Then <b>you</b> won't <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> school. Can <b>you</b> dress the boys' hair?" [...] "No." [...] "Then <b>you</b> won't <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> school. Can <b>you</b> lie three in a bed?" [...] "No." [...] "Then <b>you</b> will never <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> school. Have <b>you</b> a good stomach?" [...] "Yes." [...] "Then you will by no means <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> school. I have been an usher in a boarding-school myself, and may I die of an anodyne necklace, but I had rather be under-turnkey in Newgate. I was up early and late; I was browbeat by the master, hated for my ugly face by the mistress, worried by the boys." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Much {{you know}} about it, old chap. It's hard work, I can tell you, and that wouldn't suit such a lazy-bones.

6000|$|... 'Nothing that I know of,' said Mrs. Rolland. 'The Baron and Mr. Ferrari (if I may {{use such}} an expression) were [...] "birds of a feather," [...] {{so far as}} I could see--I mean, one was as unprincipled as the other. I am a just woman; and I {{will give you an}} example. Only the day before I left, I heard the Baron say (through the open door of his room while I was passing along the corridor), [...] "Ferrari, I want a {{thousand}} pounds. What would <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> thousand pounds?" [...] And I heard Mr. Ferrari answer, [...] "Anything, sir, as long as I was not found out." [...] And then they both burst out laughing. I heard no more than that. Judge for yourself, Miss.' ...|$|E
60|$|Yes, my friends, it is {{good for}} us to be afflicted, good for us to suffer {{anything}} that will teach us this great truth, that we are our brother's keepers; that we are all one family, and that where one of the members suffers, all the other members suffer with it; and that if one of the members has cause to rejoice, all the others will have cause to rejoice with it. A blessed thing to know, is that--though whether we know it or not, we shall find it true. If we give way to our animal nature, and try to live as the beasts do, each one caring for his own selfish pleasure--still we shall find out that we cannot do it. We shall find out, as those Liverpool people did with the Irish widow, that our fellow-men ARE our brothers--that what hurts them will be sure in some strange indirect way to hurt us. Our brothers here have had the fever, and we have escaped; but we have felt the fruits of it, in our purses--in fear, and anxiety, and distress, and trouble--we have found out that they could not have the fever without our suffering for it, more or less. You see we are one family, we men and women; and our relationship will assert itself in spite of our forgetfulness and our selfishness. How much better to claim our brotherhood with each other, and to act upon it--to live as brothers indeed. That would be to make it a blessing, and not a curse; for as I said before, just because it is in our power to injure each other, therefore it is in our power to help each other. God has bound us together for good and for evil, for better for worse. Oh! let it be henceforward in this parish for better, and not for worse. Oh! every one of you, whether you be rich or poor, farmer or labourer, man or woman, do not be ashamed to own yourselves to be brothers and sisters, members of one family, which as it all fell together in the old Adam, so it has all risen together in the new Adam, Jesus Christ. There is no respect of persons with God. We are all equal in His sight. He knows no difference among men, except the difference which God's Spirit gives, in proportion as a man listens to the teaching of that Spirit--rank in godliness and true manhood. Oh! believe that--believe that because you owe an infinite debt to Christ and to God--His Father and your Father--therefore you owe an infinite debt to your neighbours, members of Christ and children of God just as you are--a debt of love, help, care, which you CAN, pay, just because you are members of one family; for because you are members of one family, for that very reason every good deed <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> neighbour does not stop with that neighbour, but goes on breeding and spreading, and growing and growing, for aught we know, for ever. Just as each selfish act we do, each bitter word we speak, each foul example we set, may go on spreading from mouth to mouth, from heart to heart, from parent to child, till we may injure generations yet unborn; so each noble and self-sacrificing deed we do, each wise and loving word we speak, each example we set of industry and courage, of faith in God and care for men, may and will spread on from heart to heart, and mouth to mouth, and teach others to do and be the like; till people miles away, who never heard of our names, may have cause to bless us for ever and ever. This is one and only one of the glorious fruits of our being one family. This is one and only one of the reasons which make me say {{that it was a good}} thing mankind was so made that the innocent suffer for the guilty. For just as the innocent are injured by the guilty in this world, even so are the guilty preserved, and converted, and brought back again by the innocent. Just as the sins of the fathers are visited on the children, so is the righteousness of the fathers a blessing to the children; else, says St. Paul, our children would be unclean, but now they are holy. For the promises of God are not only to us, but to our children, even to as many as the Lord our God shall call. And thus each generation, by growing in virtue and wisdom and the knowledge of God, will help forward all the generations which follow it to fuller light and peace and safety; and each parent in trying to live like a Christian man himself, will make it easier for his children to live like Christians after him. And this rule applies even in the things which we are too apt to fancy unimportant--every house kept really clean, every family brought up in habits of neatness and order, every acre of foul land drained, every new improvement in agriculture and manufactures or medicine, is a clear gain to all mankind, a good example set which is sure sooner or later to find followers, perhaps among generations yet unborn, and in countries of which we never heard the name.|$|E
