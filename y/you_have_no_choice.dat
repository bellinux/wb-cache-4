500|$|Sorkin {{fought with}} the ABC network during the first season {{over the use of}} a laugh track and a live studio audience. The laugh track was widely decried by critics as jarring, with Joyce Millman of Salon.com {{describing}} it as [...] "the most unconvincing laugh track you've ever heard". Sorkin commented that: [...] "Once you do shoot in front of a live audience, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to use the laugh track. Oftentimes [...] {{is the right thing to}} do. Sometimes you do need a cymbal crash. Other times, it alienates me." [...] The laugh track was gradually dialed down and was gone by the end of the first season. Sorkin was triumphant in the second season when ABC agreed to his demands, unburdening the crew of the difficulties of staging a scene for a live audience and leaving the cast with more time to rehearse.|$|E
500|$|... "Beat Goes On" [...] {{received}} generally mixed {{to positive}} reviews from music critics. Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone {{felt that the}} usage of bells and whistles as instrumentation, along with the disco sounds made the track connect to two of Madonna's inspirations, that of Chic, and Donna Summer. Ganz went on to criticize West's appearance, calling it [...] "uninspired". In a similar review, Thomas Hauner of PopMatters wrote that the song [...] "continues the Donna Summer touch, this time opting for 'beep beep' vocals on a surprisingly sweet track." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine believed that compared to the demo, the final version had lost an individuality, but complimented the addition of West, feeling that it [...] "transports [...] from 2001 to 1979". Talia Soghomolian of musicOMH praised [...] "the variations in its tempo", making it [...] "the perfect dance floor tune, merging old school and modern takes on urbanity." [...] Stern wrote a positive review for Idolator that [...] "by the time West shows up unexpectedly for his rap at the end, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to heed his call to get down, beep beep, and get up outta your seat." ...|$|E

5000|$|In 1988 Banyan {{announced}} a new server, based on the Intel 80386 microprocessor, known as the Corporate Network Server (CNS). In 1989 Compaq Computer Corporation announced the SystemPro, the first industry standard PC built specifically to be a server. Banyan followed up with a version of VINES known as VINES/386, which was a port of VINES developed for industry standard PCs such as the SystemPro and the Compaq Deskpro 386. VINES/386 was priced substantially higher than VINES/286, but again, Banyan intentionally brain-damaged the [...] "open" [...] version of VINES so that its proprietary hardware {{would appear to be}} more functional. It also incorporated processor detection code into VINES/286 that would prevent the lower-cost NOS from running on an 80386-based machine. If <b>you</b> <b>had</b> an 80386-based server, <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to buy the more costly VINES/386, despite the fact that Intel intended the 80386 to be fully backward compatible with the 80286.|$|R

40|$|Aim : deep vein {{thrombophlebitis}} of {{the lower}} leg is an uncommon complication with a difficult diagnosis, severe morbidity and mortality but its incidence increases with the devlopment of intensive care units. Case reports and articles on this subject are quite rare, in cotrast to post catheterisation thrombophlebitis Methods : Based on a case report we discuss different therapeutic modalities : anticoagulatn therapy combined with compression bandages and broad spectrum antibiotics; versus surgery (venous trombectomy, venous thrombolysis or deep phlebectomy) followed by anticoagulant therapy, antibiotics and compression stockings. "Do we have to operate or not, At what time {{do we have to}} operate and which operation?" This are the questions we have to answer. Discussion. Most cases can be managed by conservative treatment. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are added basedon cultures, if negative and other sources of infection are excluded they are started on empirical base and give for at least 6 weeks (amoxiclav with aminoglycoside). Surgical therapy for DVT consists of thrombectomy or thrombolysis in patients withcerulea alba dolens and in young patients with thrombosis of the common femroal or iliac vein to avoid chornic venous insufficiency. The uncomplete removal of the thrombus more then 2 weeeks after onset is a disadvantage of both procedures. deep phlebectomy is the only operation where every septic focus is removed but has a high risk of mrobidity and mortality due to the extent of the operation. If septicemia persists after 4 weeks broad spectrum antibiotics a surgical thrombectomy or thrombolysis is performed. A full excision of the suppurating vein is avoided, if there is perioperative full adhesion of the clot then <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> other <b>choice.</b> Conclusion. After review of the literature (only 12 case reports) we recommend our therapy flow chart, but more cases must be reported to supportour therapeutic guideline...|$|R

The Al-Qaeda fighters were not particularly well trained but they were fanatical fighters and most relished the fight. Despite heavy air bombardment, the SAS had to fight hard for every inch of progress, but the SAS ability to fire and manoeuvre enabled them to out-fight the terrorists.

"The {{worst that}} can be brought up against Schultz," [...] I began, folding my arms and {{speaking}} dispassionately, [...] "is an awkward habit of stealing the stores of every ship he has ever been in. He will do it. That's really all that's wrong. I don't credit absolutely that story Captain Robinson tells of Schultz conspiring in Chantabun with some ruffians in a Chinese junk to steal the anchor off the starboard bow of the Bohemian Girl schooner. Robinson's story is too ingenious altogether. That other tale of the engineers of the Nan-Shan finding Schultz at midnight in the engine-room busy hammering at the brass bearings to carry them off for sale on shore seems to me more authentic. Apart from this little weakness, {{let me tell you}} that Schultz is a smarter sailor than many who never took a drop of drink in their lives, and perhaps no worse morally than some men you and I know who have never stolen the value of a penny. He may not be a desirable person to have on board one's ship, but since <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> he may be made to do, I believe. The important thing is to understand his psychology. Don't give him any money till you have done with him. Not a cent, if he begs ever so. For as sure as Fate the moment you give him any money he will begin to steal. Just remember that." ...|$|E
60|$|The first Bearer that applied, waited {{below and}} sent up his recommendations. That {{was the first}} morning in Bombay. We read them over; carefully, cautiously, thoughtfully. There was not a fault to find with them--except one; they were all from Americans. Is that a slur? If it is, it is a {{deserved}} one. In my experience, an American's recommendation of a servant is not usually valuable. We are too good-natured a race; we hate to say the unpleasant thing; we shrink from speaking the unkind truth about a poor fellow whose bread depends upon our verdict; so we speak of his good points only, thus not scrupling to tell a lie--a silent lie--for in not mentioning his bad ones we as good as say he hasn't any. The only difference that I know of between a silent lie and a spoken one is, that the silent lie is a less respectable one than the other. And it can deceive, whereas the other can't--as a rule. We not only tell the silent lie as to a servant's faults, but we sin in another way: we overpraise his merits; for {{when it comes to}} writing recommendations of servants we are a nation of gushers. And we have not the Frenchman's excuse. In France you must give the departing servant a good recommendation; and you must conceal his faults; <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice.</b> If you mention his faults {{for the protection of the}} next candidate for his services, he can sue you for damages; and the court will award them, too; and, moreover, the judge will give you a sharp dressing-down from the bench for trying to destroy a poor man's character, and rob him of his bread. I do not state this on my own authority, I got it from a French physician of fame and repute--a man who was born in Paris, and had practiced there all his life. And he said that he spoke not merely from common knowledge, but from exasperating personal experience.|$|E
