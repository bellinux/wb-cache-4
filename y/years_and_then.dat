5|$|Mary Russell Mitford {{lived in}} Reading {{for a number}} of <b>years</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> spent {{the rest of her life}} just outside the town at Three Mile Cross and Swallowfield.

5|$|The 7 {{trillion}} year {{figure was}} first changed to 7 billion <b>years</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> to 3 million {{and the characters}} of Arnold Rimmer and the Cat were created. The name Dave Hollins was changed to Dave Lister when a football player called Dave Hollins became well-known, and Hab was replaced by Holly. One of the voice actors from Son of Cliché, Chris Barrie went on to portray Arnold Rimmer in the Red Dwarf TV series.|$|E

5|$|The sebaceous glands {{of a human}} fetus secrete a {{substance}} called vernix caseosa, a waxy, translucent white substance coating the skin of newborns. After birth, activity of the glands decreases until {{there is almost no}} activity during ages 2–6 <b>years,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> increases to a peak of activity during puberty, due to heightened levels of androgens.|$|E
5|$|Another account {{mentions}} the Maha-matrikas (the great mothers), {{a group of}} the wives of six of the Saptarishis (7 great sages), who were accused of being Skanda's real mothers and thus abandoned by their husbands. They request Skanda to adopt them as his mothers. Skanda agrees and grants them two boons: to be worshipped as great goddesses and permission to torment children {{as long as they}} are younger than 16 <b>years</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> act as their protectors. These six goddesses as well as the Saptamatrikas are identified or associated with Vedic Krittikas, the constellation Pleiades.|$|E
5|$|Clara {{explored}} eastern religions {{for a few}} <b>years</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> {{eventually became}} a Christian Scientist, although there is some question as to her seriousness and commitment to it. She authored {{a book on the}} subject: Awake to a Perfect Day, published by Citadel Press, NYC, 1956 After originally objecting to the release of her father's Letters from the Earth in 1939, she changed her stance shortly before her death in 1962 and allowed them to be published. She also published biographies of both her father (My Father, Mark Twain in 1931) and of her first husband (My Husband: Gabrilowitsch in 1938).|$|E

5|$|In December 2006 Serevi {{was offered}} a {{coaching}} position with the Falcons, a South African side. The offer was several times more than he received from the Fiji Rugby Union. The contract required {{him to be a}} backline coach and player for two <b>years,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> a coach for the next three years. In the end he decided to instead renew his contract with the Fiji Rugby Union. In early 2007 the interim Sports Minister Lekh Ram Vayeshnoi appointed Serevi to the board of the interim Fiji Sports Council.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after {{publication}} of Preface to Plato, Havelock accepted {{a position as}} chair of the Classics Department at Yale University. He remained in New Haven for eight <b>years,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> taught briefly as Raymond Distinguished Professor of Classics at the State University of New York at Buffalo. He retired in 1973 and moved to Poughkeepsie, New York, where his wife Christine Mitchell, whom he had married in 1962, taught at Vassar College. He was a productive scholar after his retirement, writing three books as well as numerous essays and talks expanding the arguments of Preface to Plato to a generalised argument about the effect of literacy on Greek thought, literature, culture, society, and law.|$|E
5|$|Two rioters {{were hidden}} in Lakenheath by a {{labourer}} who eventually betrayed them for £5 each (£). One rioter, William Gotobed, a bricklayer, escaped and was eventually pardoned {{a few years}} later. He returned to Littleport after seven <b>years</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> went to America. The rioting spread to nearby areas such as Little Downham, Cambridgeshire, although such areas were not as badly affected. It took until 10 June before the areas were finally cleared of trouble {{and all of the}} rioters had been captured.|$|E

5|$|Vaughan Williams's {{family would}} have {{preferred}} him to have remained at Charterhouse for two more <b>years</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> go on to Cambridge University. They were not convinced that he was talented enough to pursue a musical career, but feeling {{it would be wrong}} to prevent him from trying, they had allowed him to go to the RCM. Nevertheless, a university education was expected of him, and in 1892 he temporarily left the RCM and entered Trinity College, Cambridge, where he spent three years, studying music and history.|$|E
5|$|Diefenbaker was the {{favourite}} {{throughout the}} leadership campaign. At the convention in Ottawa in December, {{he refused to}} abide by the custom of having a Quebecer be either the proposer or seconder of his candidacy, and instead selected an Easterner (from New Brunswick) and a Westerner to put his name in nomination. With most Quebec delegates backing his opponents, Diefenbaker felt that having a Quebecer as a nominator would not increase his support. Diefenbaker was elected on the first ballot, and a number of Quebec delegates walked out of the convention after his victory. Other Diefenbaker opponents, such as those who had urged Smith to run, believed that the 61-year-old Diefenbaker would be merely a caretaker, who would serve a few <b>years</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> step down in favour of a younger man, and that the upcoming election would be lost to the Liberals regardless of who led the Tories.|$|E
5|$|Josephus records three {{short-lived}} {{marriages in}} Berenice's life, the first {{which took place}} sometime between 41 and 43, to Marcus Julius Alexander, brother of Tiberius Julius Alexander and son of Alexander the Alabarch of Alexandria. On his early death in 44, {{she was married to}} her father's brother, Herod of Chalcis, with whom she had two sons, Berenicianus and Hyrcanus. After her husband died in 48, she lived with her brother Agrippa for several <b>years</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> married Polemon II of Pontus, king of Cilicia, whom she subsequently deserted. According to Josephus, Berenice requested this marriage to dispel rumors that she and her brother were carrying on an incestuous relationship, with Polemon being persuaded to this union mostly on account of her wealth. However the marriage did not last and she soon returned to the court of her brother. Josephus was not the only ancient writer to suggest incestuous relations between Berenice and Agrippa. Juvenal, in his sixth satire, outright claims that they were lovers. Whether this was based on truth remains unknown. Berenice indeed spent much of her life at the court of Agrippa, and by all accounts shared almost equal power. Popular rumors may also have been fueled by the fact that Agrippa himself never married during his lifetime.|$|E

5|$|While Busby was in {{hospital}} {{recovering from the}} injuries he sustained in the air crash, his managerial duties were left to his assistant, Jimmy Murphy. After Busby recovered, he set about rebuilding his side, and within five years, in 1963, he had won the FA Cup {{for the first time}} in 15 years. This was followed up by two league titles in three <b>years,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> the greatest prize in European club football, the European Cup. He continued as manager for one more year after this success, leaving his managerial duties to club trainer Wilf McGuinness. McGuinness struggled in his new post, however, and Busby was convinced to return for the second half of the 1970–71 season. However, he retired from football permanently that summer, and was succeeded that summer by Frank O'Farrell. O'Farrell's stay was short-lived, though, as his inability to control George Best's extravagances forced the board to sack him with three years still to run on his contract.|$|E
