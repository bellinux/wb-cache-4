25|$|Historian J.M. Andre {{concludes that}} the {{original}} sense of otium was related to military service and the idleness {{that happened in the}} winter, as opposed to the business (negotium) {{of the rest of the}} year. The most ancient Roman calendar divided the year into ten months devoted to war and farming, leaving the winter months of January and February vacant for individual otium. Andre shows that the beauty of the individual otium poses rest. Titus Maccius Plautus in his play Mercator says that while you are young is the time to save up for your retirement otium so you can enjoy it later, in his claim tum in otium te conloces, dum potes, ames (then you may set <b>yourself</b> <b>at</b> your ease, drink and be amorous).|$|E
500|$|By contrast, Rolling Stones Stephen Holden admired Material World as [...] "a pop {{religious}} {{ceremony for}} all seasons" [...] {{and described the}} song as [...] "a meltingly lovely meditation-prayer, the ultimate aural refinement of 'Blue Jay Way'". In his review for Melody Maker, Michael Watts wrote of [...] "Be Here Now"'s middle eight providing a [...] "Confucius-like 'truth'" [...] and commented that reading the album's lyric sheet was [...] "rather like finding <b>yourself</b> <b>at</b> the feet of some Tibetan [...] ".|$|E
500|$|After dismissing Anthony Julius, a Mishcon de Reya lawyer, Mills stated {{she would}} {{represent}} {{herself in the}} upcoming divorce hearing, with help from her sister Fiona, David Rosen, a solicitor-advocate, and Michael Shilub, an American attorney. In leaked documents, Mills complained that McCartney was often drunk, smoked cannabis, stabbed her with a broken wine glass, pushed her over a table, and pushed her into a bathtub when she was pregnant. Referring to her part in the marriage, Mills {{said that she had}} been a full-time wife, mother, lover, confidante, business partner and psychologist to McCartney. McCartney's lawyers studied Mills's book: Life Balance: The Essential Keys to a Lifetime of Wellbeing (2006), as it contradicted many of her claims, such as when she praised McCartney for [...] "Bringing me breakfast in bed every morning, no matter how he feels, and I do the dinner, so we've got that agreement. It's thoughtfulness". Mills's father reconciled with his daughter after meeting her and McCartney, when they introduced him to his granddaughter, Beatrice. After their separation, he said that it [...] "took guts to represent <b>yourself</b> <b>at</b> the High Court", and that he was proud of his daughter, even though he thought she would be [...] "torn to shreds" [...] by McCartney's lawyers.|$|E

500|$|One of {{the first}} songs written for the album was [...] "Angel". McLachlan said that writing the song was easy, [...] "a real joyous occasion." [...] It was {{inspired}} by articles that she read in Rolling Stone about musicians who turned to heroin {{to cope with the}} pressures of the music industry and subsequently overdosed. She said that she identified with the feelings that might lead someone to use heroin: [...] "I've been in that place where you're so fucked up and you're so lost that you don't know who you are anymore, and you're miserable—and here's this escape route. I've never done heroin, but I've done plenty of other things to escape." [...] She said that the song is about [...] "trying not to take responsibility for other people's shit and trying to love <b>yourself</b> <b>at</b> the same time." [...] Another song that she found easy to write was [...] "Building a Mystery", co-written with her regular collaborator, Canadian musician and producer Pierre Marchand. Marchand heard her playing a guitar riff and suggested adding some lyrics that he had already written. They came up {{with the rest of the}} lyrics together, according to McLachlan, [...] "pretty darn quickly." [...] When the album was finished, McLachlan commented, [...] "I was so happy when I could let it go. I didn't give it another thought when it was done." ...|$|E

2500|$|Most {{words in}} Fuzhou dialect have {{cognates}} in other varieties of Chinese, so a non-Fuzhou speaker {{would find it}} much easier to understand Fuzhou dialect written in Chinese characters than spoken in conversation. However, false friends do exist: for example, [...] "" [...] (mŏ̤h sá̤-nê) means [...] "don't be too polite" [...] or [...] "make <b>yourself</b> <b>at</b> home", [...] "" [...] (nguāi dó̤i-chiū nṳ̄ sā̤ uāng) means [...] "I help you wash dishes", [...] "" [...] (ĭ gâe̤ng ĭ lâu-mā lā̤ uŏng-gă) means [...] "he and his wife are quarreling (with each other)", etc. Mere knowledge of Mandarin vocabulary does not help one catch the meaning of these sentences.|$|E
2500|$|A claim {{put forth}} by the Drudge Report that the newly {{released}} document was a forgery made with image editing software quickly spread on the Internet. Nathan Goulding, chief technology officer of the National Review magazine, dismissed the matter of [...] "layered components" [...] found in the White House PDF by suggesting [...] "that whoever scanned the birth certificate in Hawaii forgot {{to turn off the}} OCR setting on the scanner." [...] Nathan added [...] "I’ve confirmed that scanning an image, converting it to a PDF, optimizing that PDF, and then opening it up in Illustrator, does in fact create layers similar to what is seen in the birth certificate PDF.

2500|$|While {{working in}} the [...] "Murray Franklin's" [...] nightclub in Miami Beach, Florida, early in his career, Rickles spotted Frank Sinatra and remarked to him, [...] "I just saw your movie The Pride and the Passion and I want to tell you, the cannon's acting was great." [...] He added, [...] "Make <b>yourself</b> <b>at</b> home, Frank. Hit somebody!" [...] Sinatra, whose pet name for Rickles was [...] "bullet-head", enjoyed him {{so much that he}} {{encouraged}} other celebrities to see Rickles' act and be insulted by him. Sinatra's support helped Rickles become a popular headline performer in Las Vegas. During a Dean Martin Celebrity Roast special, Rickles was among those who took part in roasting Sinatra, and Rickles, too, was also roasted during another show in the series.|$|E

2500|$|Cortez motioned {{the fighters}} back {{together}} {{to resume the}} fight, without putting them in a neutral corner. Both fighters touched gloves, and Ortiz gave Mayweather another hug. At that moment, Cortez was {{not looking at the}} fighters. As Ortiz let go, Mayweather took advantage of Ortiz not having his hands up and unloaded a left hook which wobbled Ortiz. Ortiz then looked at the referee, and Mayweather connected with a flush right hand to Ortiz's face. Ortiz fell to the canvas, and was unable to beat Cortez's count as the crowd of 14,687 jeered Mayweather. After the fight Ortiz claimed that he was merely obeying the referee's instructions when he was [...] "blindsided" [...] by Mayweather, who defended his actions by saying that [...] "In the ring, you have to protect <b>yourself</b> <b>at</b> all times".|$|E
2500|$|Fitzwilliam {{also took}} up his uncle's role as a major leader of the Whigs. Edmund Burke wrote to Fitzwilliam on 3 July 1782: [...] "You are Lord Rockingham in every thing. ... I {{have no doubt that}} you will take it in good part, that his old friends, who were {{attached}} to him by every tie of affection, and of principle, and among others myself, should look to you, and should not think it an act of forwardness and intrusion to offer you their services". Charles James Fox wrote on 1 July: [...] "Do not be satisfied with lamenting but endeavour to imitate him. I know how painful it will be to you to exert <b>yourself</b> <b>at</b> such a time, but it must be done...you are one of the persons upon whom I most rely for real assistance at this moment".|$|E
2500|$|Finding {{its roots}} in the early 4-H {{movement}} in West Virginia, the 4-H All-Star program strives to recognize and challenge 4-H members and volunteers. [...] State 4-H Club Leader William H. [...] "Teepi" [...] Kendrick sought to develop youth to [...] "be <b>yourself</b> <b>at</b> your best" [...] and to [...] "make the best better" [...] through a fourfold personal development pattern involving the head, hands, heart, and, at that time, hustle. [...] It was with this philosophy, in collaboration with others, that the 4-H emblem was born. In an attempt to harbor further individual growth, Kendrick recognized excellence with pins bearing one, two, three, and four H's. [...] Recognition for outstanding participation was rewarded from 1917 to 1921 with trips to a Prize Winner's Course at West Virginia University. [...] Members who demonstrated outstanding qualities at these courses were awarded five-pointed red pins with five H's, with this additional H to symbolize honor. [...] The recipients of these pins were referred to by Kendrick as [...] "All Stars". It was following the pin consecration ceremony in 1919 that the official West Virginia 4-H All Stars organization was chartered, becoming the Alpha Chapter of the nationwide 4-H honorary.|$|E
