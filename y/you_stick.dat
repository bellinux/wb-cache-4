500|$|A fourth {{series was}} {{confirmed}} after the airing of [...] "The Devil of Christmas", to be broadcast in 2018. Shearsmith confirmed {{that much of}} the series has been written, identifying one episode as set in a hotel corridor with all dialogue in iambic pentameter. Pemberton has said that he would be interested in an online spin-off, perhaps called No. 9A, with less experienced comedy writers. In an interview, he said [...] "The format has so many opportunities and can incorporate so many styles, as long as <b>you</b> <b>stick</b> to the small cast, single location constraint. I think it's really important to bring through fresh voices." ...|$|E
500|$|Art {{designer}} Sylvain Despretz {{claimed the}} art department {{was assigned to}} create something that had {{little or nothing to}} do with the Superman comic book, and also explained that Peters [...] "would bring kids in, who would rate the drawings on the wall as if they were evaluating the toy possibilities. It was basically a toy show." [...] Peters saw a cover of National Geographic, containing a picture of a skull, going to art department workers, telling them he wanted the design for Brainiac's space ship to have the same image. Burton gave Despretz a concept drawing for Brainiac, which Despretz claims was [...] "a cone with a round ball on top, and something that looked like an emaciated skull inside. Imagine you take Merlin's hat, and <b>you</b> <b>stick</b> a fish bowl on top, with a skull in it." [...] Concept artist Rolf Mohr said in an interview he designed a suit for the Eradicator for a planned scene in which it transforms into a flying vehicle.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the third}} volume of Walter Clark's Histories of the Several Regiments from North Carolina in the Great War, the author {{explains}} that the nickname came about when North Carolina troops held their ground during a battle in Virginia during the American Civil War while other supporting troops retreated. After the battle, supporting troops asked the victorious North Carolinians: [...] "Any more tar down in the Old North State, boys?" [...] and they replied: [...] "No, not a bit; old Jeff's bought it all up." [...] The supporting troops continued: [...] "Is that so? What {{is he going to}} do with it?"

2500|$|According to Dickinson, his revitalised enthusiasm, {{brought about}} by Harris's idea to make a concept album, carried forward into the cover artwork, saying that [...] "I was {{probably}} responsible in a large part for the cover, with Derek." [...] Dickinson states that the idea to set the painting in a polar landscape may have originated from when he showed Riggs a Gustave Doré piece, depicting traitors frozen in a lake of ice in the ninth circle of Dante's Inferno. In contradiction of this, Riggs states that the setting was because he [...] "might have just seen a documentary about the North Pole or something ... I wanted something that was a departure from all the cityscapes and things. It was about prophecy and seeing the future, and so I just wanted something distant. And then they said, on the back, 'Could <b>you</b> <b>stick</b> all the other Eddies in the ice?' So I did." ...|$|E
2500|$|For Kierkegaard, true {{individuality}} {{is called}} selfhood. Becoming {{aware of our}} true self is our true task and endeavor in life—it is an ethical imperative, as well as preparatory to a true religious understanding. Individuals can exist {{at a level that}} is less than true selfhood. We can live, for example, simply in terms of our pleasures—our immediate satisfaction of desires, propensities, or distractions. In this way, we glide through life without direction or purpose. To have a direction, we must have a purpose that defines for us the meaning of our lives. Kierkegaard puts it this way in Either/Or, Here, then, I have your view of life, and, believe me, much of your life will become clear to you if you will consider it along with me as thought-despair. You are a hater of activity in life-quite appropriately, because {{if there is to be}} meaning in it life must have continuity, and this your life does not have. You keep busy with your studies, to be sure; you are even diligent; but it is only for your sake, and it is done with as little teleology as possible. Moreover, you are unoccupied; like the laborers in the Gospel standing idle in the marketplace, <b>you</b> <b>stick</b> your hands in your pocket and contemplate life. Now you rest in despair. Nothing concerns you; you step aside for nothing; “If someone threw a roof tile down I would still not step aside.” You are like a dying person. You die daily, not in the profound, earnest sense in which one usually understands these words, but life has lost its reality and you “Always count the days of your life from one termination-notice to the next.” You let everything pass you by; nothing makes any impact. But then something suddenly comes along that grips you, an idea, a situation, a young girl’s smile, and now you are “involved,” for just on certain occasions you are not “involved,” so at other times you are “at your service” in every way. Wherever there is something going on you join in. You behave in life as you usually do in a crowd. “You work yourself into the tightest group, see to it, if possible, to get yourself shoved up over the others so that you come to be above them, and as soon as you are up there you make yourself as comfortable as possible, and in this way you let yourself be carried through life.” But when the crowd is gone, when the event is over, you again stand on the street corner and look at the world.
