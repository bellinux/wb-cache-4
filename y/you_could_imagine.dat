Learned Hand eventually came to understand the influences of his parents as formative. After his father's death, he looked to religion to help him cope, writing to his cousin Augustus Noble Hand: [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>imagine</b> one half the comfort my religion has given to me in this terrible loss, you would see that Christ never forsakes those who cling to him." [...] The depth of Hand's early religious convictions was in sharp contrast to his later agnosticism.|$|E

He was asked for [...] "20 things, like an ocean liner horn," [...] and Hutchins knew he had the music Hillenburg was looking for. Hutchins said [...] "I offered him options and, in some cases, multiple choices. We agreed to meet at the Warner Bros. gate near the water tower in 20 minutes." [...] He recorded the sound to a tape and met Hillenburg by the gate. Hutchins said [...] "He was about as happy as <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>imagine,</b> and off he went. Next thing you know, I am working on the show." [...] Hutchins became the regular series sound designer.|$|E
500|$|According to Dave Mustaine, {{the band}} have {{encountered}} numerous mishaps and odd occurrences. In {{an interview with}} Terrorizer magazine, Mustaine, taking note of the connection to the unlucky number 13, explained [...] "This is our 13th studio record, and we've already {{had a bunch of}} weird things happen. Car problems, stuff disappearing, a guy who worked for me that was the most white-laced guy <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>imagine</b> falling out on drugs and disappearing... but this one's got me excited!" [...] In addition, Mustaine announced on Twitter that producer Johnny K was [...] "suddenly struck ill", and the band had ceased recording for the time being. However, the band resumed recording a few days later, with K having apparently recovered. In an interview, Drover had said nothing weird occurred until after he finished recording drum tracks for the album.|$|E

500|$|Gray {{wanted the}} film to be as {{realistic}} as possible; accordingly, the actors did most of their own stunts, and computer-generated imagery was used very sparingly. The second unit, under director Alexander Witt and cinematographer Josh Bleibtreu, filmed establishing shots, the Venice canal chase sequence, and the Los Angeles chase sequence {{over a period of}} 40 days. Filming on location posed some challenges. The opening heist sequence in Venice, Italy, was strictly monitored by the local authorities, due to the high speeds the boats were driven at. The frigid temperatures at Passo Fedaia in the Italian Alps created problems during production: [...] "The guns would jam, and if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>imagine</b> not being able to walk 40 feet with a bottle of water without it freezing, those are the conditions we had to work in," [...] Gray remarked. Pedestrians had to be allowed to use the sidewalks of Hollywood Boulevard between takes. Also, scenes which took place on freeways and city streets were only filmed on weekends.|$|E
500|$|Following Aston's death, former {{colleague}} Francis Pryor noted that Aston was a [...] "remarkable archaeologist who could really dig", being a [...] "warm, loving, nice man." [...] Another colleague, Phil Harding, commented on Aston's [...] "incredible knowledge" [...] and [...] "effortless {{way of making}} archaeology accessible to people." [...] Tony Robinson wrote of him: [...] "Mick was a real child of the '60s {{and a bit of}} a rebel, but he was also a series of contradictions. He {{was one of the best}} academic archaeologists in the country, yet his real love was teaching ordinary people. He was the grumpiest old Black Country curmudgeon <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>imagine,</b> but he had a heart of absolute gold." [...] He also noted that [...] "archaeology is now a subject that tens of thousands of people enjoy and value, and this is almost solely down to him." [...] Ralph Lee, head of Channel 4's factual programming, described Aston as a [...] "brilliant communicator" [...] who helped make archaeology [...] "so popular" [...] in the UK.|$|E
500|$|Much of {{her early}} career {{is filled with}} near misses in casting, as she was up for {{significant}} roles in films such as 1997's The Postman and The Devil's Advocate and 2000's Meet the Parents, which eventually went to other actresses. In an interview in 2012, Watts said, [...] "I came to New York and auditioned {{at least five times}} for Meet the Parents. I think the director liked me but the studio didn't. I heard every piece of feedback <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>imagine,</b> and in this case, it was 'not sexy enough'." [...] Watts recalled her early career in an interview in 2002, saying, [...] "It is a tough town. I think my spirit has taken a beating. The most painful thing has been the endless auditions. Knowing that you have something to offer, but not being able to show it, is so frustrating. As an unknown, you get treated badly. I auditioned and waited for things I did not have any belief in, but I needed the work and had to accept horrendous pieces of shit." [...] Watts studied the Meisner Technique.|$|E

500|$|The {{first series}} {{received}} generally favourable reviews. Joe Joseph of The Times {{stated that it}} [...] "bears a closer resemblance [...] 24," [...] which [...] "shaded the pleasure of this opening episode", but felt {{that by the end}} of the episode, Spooks had [...] "established a voice of its own." [...] Gerard O'Donovan of The Telegraph thought that the series [...] "proved thoroughly entertaining", and praised Wolstencroft's writing, which O'Donovan felt was [...] "confident enough to be playful with its subject – especially regarding Britain's poor-relation relationship with America." [...] Alison Graham of the Radio Times called the first series [...] "a tremendous pieces of hokum, which is only slightly po-faced (but in a knowing kind of way) and which manages to stay just on the right side of self-parody." [...] Thomas Sudcliff of The Independent felt it was a [...] "different kind of spy drama" [...] with [...] "a literal description, derived from the sort of rueful story <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>imagine</b> being told at an MI5 staff social", and [...] "a lot of bullshit too, naturally. This is one of those dramas where colleagues never make small talk but instead launch straight into an urgent purposive shorthand." ...|$|E
500|$|After the World War, {{according}} to Beldie, actor Iancovescu introduced impressions of Bogdan-Pitești to his cabaret routine. It showed the convicted Garmanophile and an unnamed German official, who {{looked into the}} mislanding of propaganda funds on supporting petty [...] "henchmen". To this charge, the fictional Bogdan-Pitești replies: [...] "I have consumed your money, this much is true, but I did not pull one on you! For {{how is it that}} <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>imagine</b> me, a traitor of my country, not also being a con artist?" [...] According to Beldie, the account has a grain of truth: instead of using money to revive the Germanophile cause, Bogdan-Pitești directed them into his art collection. A somewhat similar version of this urban legend is included in the memoirs of a National Liberal adversary, I. G. Duca, who sees Bogdan-Pitești's retort as a paradoxical sign of injured patriotism: [...] "Did you perhaps think that you might buy off some of Romania's honest people? You would be dead wrong, in this land one can only buy off the con artists, only con artists such as myself." [...] Duca concludes: [...] "this reply, with its admirable and atavistic national dignity, tempts me to forget, though not to forgive, the utter turpitude that we call Bogdan-Pitești's life." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Can't Get You Out of My Head" [...] was jointly written, composed, and {{produced}} by Cathy Dennis and Rob Davis. Dennis and Davis {{had been brought}} together by British artist manager Simon Fuller, who wanted the duo {{to come up with}} a song for British pop group S Club 7. The song was recorded using Cubase music software, which Davis ran on his Mac computer. Davis began playing an acoustic guitar and ran a 125 beats per minute drum loop, on which Dennis, herself a singer who had enjoyed chart success in the United States, began singing the line [...] "I just can't get you out of my head" [...] in the key of D minor. After three and a half hours, the demo was recorded and the vocals were laid afterwards. Dennis called their recording setup for the song [...] "the most primitive set-up <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>imagine!</b> Different producers work in different ways. But it's good to be reminded you don’t have to be reliant on equipment. A song is about melody and lyrics and being able to take something away in your memory that is going to haunt you." [...] She also regarded their production as a [...] "very natural and fluid process," [...] saying: [...] "We know how hard we work sometimes to write songs and then spend months picking them to pieces, but this was the easiest process, the chemicals were all happy and working together." ...|$|E
2500|$|Over a {{year before}} the album's release, Reznor {{suggested}} – presumably deliberately misleadingly – that the album would [...] "be irritating to people because it's not traditional Nine Inch Nails.

[...] She also stated [...] "Spooks appears to plume itself on its authenticity, and there are moments, well one moment, so stupid it has to be true." [...] Thomas Sudcliff of The Independent felt it was a [...] "different kind of spy drama" [...] with [...] "a literal description, derived from the sort of rueful story <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>imagine</b> being told at an MI5 staff social," [...] and [...] "a lot of bullshit too, naturally.

'I think your government would want to weigh very, very carefully the kind of outcry that would occur in this country against your taking this kind of action.' Greenhill replied: 'Well, they do, Joe, but there is also an outcry in this country,' expressing concern that 'Israel won't lift a bloody finger and ... our people get killed. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>imagine</b> how bad that would look, and if it all comes out that we could have got our people out but for the obduracy of you and other people so to speak. ...

2500|$|Pierre Dumas was {{the first}} doctor to {{campaign}} for the testing and suppression of doping, both within cycling and then at international level at the Olympic Games.

2500|$|Les Murray {{was born}} in Nabiac on the North Coast of New South Wales {{and grew up in}} the {{neighbouring}} district of Bunyah where he currently resides. He attended primary and early high school in Nabiac and then attended Taree High School. In 1957 he began study at the University of Sydney in the Faculty of Arts and joined the Royal Australian Navy Reserve to obtain a small income. Speaking about this time to Clive James he has said: [...] "I was as soft-headed as <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>imagine.</b> I was actually hanging on to childhood because I hadn't had much teenage. My Mum died and my father collapsed. I had to look after him. So I was off the chain at last, I was in Sydney and I didn't quite know how to do adulthood or teenage. I was being coltish and foolish and childlike. I received the least distinguished degree Sydney ever issued. I don't think anyone's ever matched it." [...] He developed an interest in ancient and modern languages, which qualified him to become a professional translator at the Australian National University (where he was employed from 1963 to 1967). During his studies he met other poets and writers such as Geoffrey Lehmann, Bob Ellis, Clive James and Lex Banning as well as future political journalists Laurie Oakes and Mungo McCallum Jr. Between times, he hitch-hiked around Australia and lived briefly at a Sydney Push household at Milson's Point. He returned to undergraduate studies in the 1960s and became a Roman Catholic when he married Budapest-born fellow-student Valerie Morelli in 1962. They lived in Wales and Scotland and travelled in Europe for over a year in the late 1960s. They have five children.|$|E
