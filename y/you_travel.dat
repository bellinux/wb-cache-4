25|$|The movie {{takes place}} everywhere, {{and it takes}} place nowhere. It's a city built of pieces of cities. A corner from one place, another from some place else. So, you don't really know where you are. A piece will look like a street in London, but {{a portion of the}} {{architecture}} looks like New York, but the bottom of the architecture looks again like a European city. You're there, but you don't know where you are. It's like every time <b>you</b> <b>travel,</b> you'll be lost.|$|E

25|$|In some city, {{the fare}} {{of the public}} {{transportation}} depends on the travel distance, such as the MRT in Taipei, Taiwan. This increases the transportation expense for those who has been move to the urban area, what's more, they have less money to earn by investment because they are using all of money to pay their daily expense already. For example, the fare of New York city subway(MTA) is all the same {{no matter how long}} do <b>you</b> <b>travel,</b> it's all 2.75 USD. It's justice of Housing inequality.|$|E
25|$|Cross a brook, and {{you lose}} the King of England; but you have some comfort in coming again under his Majesty, though 'shorn of his beams,' {{and no more than}} Prince of Wales. Go to the north, and you find him dwindled to a Duke of Lancaster; turn to the west of that north, and he pops upon you in the humble {{character}} of Earl of Chester. Travel a few miles on, the Earl of Chester disappears, and the King surprises you again as Count Palatine of Lancaster. If <b>you</b> <b>travel</b> beyond Mount Edgecombe, you find him once more in his incognito, and he is Duke of Cornwall... every one of those Principalities has the apparatus of a Kingdom for the jurisdiction over a few private estates, and the formality and charge of the Exchequer of Great Britain for collecting the rents of a country squire. Cornwall is the best of them.|$|E
25|$|From 75th Street south Naperville {{numbered}} east-west streets roughly {{follow the}} same grid layout as the City of Chicago. In other words, if 75th Street continued east past its terminus at Illinois Route 83, in Willowbrook, it would eventually be the same 75th Street as found in Chicago city limits. However, the older part of Naperville has a second numerical grid, starting downtown at Main and Benton, with 4th and 5th Avenues {{just north of the}} BNSF tracks, and continuing through 15th Avenue. The difference is that the numbers in the older system go up from downtown, traveling south to north, and the other grid's numbers go up as <b>you</b> <b>travel</b> north to south. There is also a geographical-based naming system, with West Street and North Street defining the older boundaries of the city. Along with these are streets named after the city they lead to, i.e., Naper/Plainfield Road heads towards Plainfield, while Aurora Avenue leads to Aurora and Chicago Avenue to Chicago (it becomes Maple Ave. in neighboring Lisle before becoming 55th Street in Downers Grove).|$|E

McCarthy stated in a 2006 RTÉ radio interview, [...] "What we have developed is a way to construct magnetic fields so that when <b>you</b> <b>travel</b> round the magnetic fields, starting and stopping at the same position, you have gained energy". In 2011, Steorn's website was updated to suggest that the Orbo is based on magnetic fields which vary over time. Barry Williams of the Australian Skeptics has pointed out that Steorn is [...] "not the first company to claim they have suddenly discovered the miraculous property of magnetism that allows you to get free energy" [...] while Martin Fleischmann says that it is not credible that positioning of magnetic fields could create energy.|$|E

He spent one year there, and then, in 1931, he matriculated at the University of Michigan in the United States to study architecture.
