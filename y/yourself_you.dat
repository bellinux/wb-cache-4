500|$|In a 2003 {{interview}} with the Grand Rapids Press, Dufek recalled growing up in Ann Arbor and meeting his father's Michigan teammates. [...] "Living in Ann Arbor, and seeing {{all the things that}} embody a great university, you learned that there were highly successful people in athletics, and it just made you want to feel a part of it.

500|$|The {{inspiration}} {{is taken}} from my own life, but also all my girlfriends who are very strong, confident girls {{who want to be}} their best in all levels of life. They’re kind of like overachievers and never seem to be satisfied with how [...] they achieve in life. I can see that with myself as well because you expect so much from <b>yourself.</b> <b>You</b> expect yourself to be the best friend, have a great career, be really talented and be able to cook—you just have to be great at everything. I think genders have been washed out a little bit -- like you have to have masculine qualities as well as feminine.

500|$|Howarth said of {{starring}} on a soap opera, [...] "Every actor at {{one time}} passes through daytime. I wouldn't have said yes to the offer if I didn't want to stay a while on daytime." [...] He added, [...] "I don't crave fame. It's kind of goofy. I didn't {{want to be a}} public figure. I wanted to be an actor, not a movie star. But I love rock 'n' roll-there, I'd rather be a rock star. That would be cool." [...] He said that [...] "like all soap actors," [...] he sticks with the script the majority of the time, [...] "but every now and then he goes off the page," [...] commenting, [...] "You get to direct <b>yourself.</b> <b>You</b> come up with a little bit. It's improvisational. Maybe you're doing it just for your castmates, but the audience catches on." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Loving You No More" [...] first leaked {{under the}} title [...] "Hurt" [...] on November 13, 2009. After being {{announced}} as the second single from Last Train to Paris on August 26, 2010, the mastered version of the song was leaked. In an interview with MTV News, Diddy explained the meaning behind the song, commenting, [...] "The concept of the song is about when you love somebody {{so much that you}} forget about <b>yourself.</b> <b>You</b> love them more than you love yourself." [...] The song's official remix, released on October 22, 2010, features American rappers Gucci Mane and Red Cafe. Producer and rapper Jermaine Dupri also remixed the song with rap vocals from him, which was unveiled on September 29, 2010.

500|$|The {{main source}} of the game's horror is Alma, a ghostly little girl. Craig Hubbard remarked that [...] "a guy in a mask chasing co-eds with a meat cleaver can be scary, but on some level you're {{thinking}} to <b>yourself</b> <b>you</b> could probably kick his ass if you got the drop on him...but when a spooky little girl takes out an entire Delta Force squad, how {{are you supposed to}} deal with that?" [...] While Alma has been compared to the character Samara from The Ring, Craig Hubbard stated that she [...] "... was born out of a tradition of eerie, faceless female ghosts ..." [...] and not [...] "... as an answer to any specific movie character." [...] Hubbard acknowledged that Alma [...] "... admittedly bears some visual resemblance to the ghosts in Dark Water or Séance", but [...] "... creepy little girls have been freaking [...] out since The Shining." [...] Developers Dave Matthews and Nathan Hendrickson say the name 'Alma' comes from the character Alma Mobley in Peter Straub's novel Ghost Story.|$|E
500|$|After the war, Longstreet and {{his family}} settled in New Orleans, a {{location}} popular {{with a number of}} former Confederate generals. He entered into a cotton brokerage partnership there and also became the president of the newly created and prominent insurance company. He actively sought the presidency of the Mobile and Ohio Railroad but was unsuccessful, and also failed in an attempt to get investors for a proposed railroad from New Orleans around the northwestern coast of the Gulf of Mexico south across the Rio Grande river and American-Mexican border to Monterrey, Mexico, (In 1870, he was named president of the newly organized New Orleans and Northeastern Railroad). He applied for a pardon from 17th President Andrew Johnson, endorsed by his old friend and Union Army General-in-Chief, [...] Ulysses S. Grant. Johnson refused, however, telling Longstreet in a meeting: [...] "There are three persons of the South who can never receive amnesty: Mr. Davis, General Lee, and <b>yourself.</b> <b>You</b> have given the Union cause too much trouble." [...] Regardless of such opposition the Radical Republican controlled United States Congress restored his rights of American citizenship in June 1868.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Entertainment Weekly gave [...] "War of the Coprophages" [...] an A-, and wrote, [...] "Irreverent camp that's infested with laughs (and creepy-crawlies) but throws credibility out the window." [...] Reviewer Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A and {{compared it to}} the previously Morgan-penned [...] "Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose", writing, [...] "So! This is the second Darin Morgan episode I've had to write about, and once again, I'm not sure I've done it justice. [...] The comedy here can be broad, but there's always enough self-aware commentary buried in it that it never becomes simplistic. While [...] "Bruckman" [...] dealt with the misery of knowing all the answers, [...] "Coprophages" [...] looks at {{how easy it is}} to convince <b>yourself</b> <b>you</b> know what's going on, even when you don't. It'd be better to believe in a bunch of bugs from outer space coming down to earth to mess with our minds, than it would be to accept the more likely truth that bugs like shit—and around here, there's always plenty to go around." [...] Critical Myth's John Keegan gave the episode an 8/10 and praised the episode's self-parodying style, saying, [...] "Overall, this episode was a rare self-contained parody, well written by Darin Morgan. By standing on its own outside of continuity, the episode gives itself plenty of room to send-up the series premise and its early internet fandom. There’s no real sense of resolution, but that’s really incidental to the point of the parody." [...] Author Phil Farrand rated the episode as his second favorite episode of the first four seasons in his book The Nitpickers Guide to the X-Files.|$|E

500|$|In 1934, Birkett {{acted as}} {{counsel for the}} second of the two Brighton trunk murders, a case which was {{described}} as [...] "his greatest triumph in a capital case". In June 1934, a woman's torso was found in a suitcase in Brighton railway station. The legs were discovered at King's Cross station the next day, but her head and arms were never found, and the case is still unsolved. A woman by the name of Violette Kaye had disappeared, and the appearance of the first woman's body prompted greater scrutiny on Kaye's case. On 14 July, they interviewed Toni Mancini, Kaye's boyfriend, who convinced them that the dead woman could not possibly be Kaye; the dead woman had been identified as around thirty five years old and five months pregnant, while Kaye was ten years older. Kaye was last seen alive on 10 May looking distressed in the doorway to her house and had been scheduled to visit her sister in London who received a telegram on 11 May reading [...] "Going abroad. Good job. Sail Sunday. Will write. Vi." [...] in block capitals. The post office clerks could not remember who sent it, but experts testified that the handwriting on the telegram had similarities to that on a menu written by Mancini. On 14 May, with the help of another man, Mancini moved his belongings from the house he shared with Kaye, which included a large trunk which was too heavy to move by hand. Mancini had told people that he had broken up with Kaye and she had moved to Paris, and that before she left he had beaten her. He later said to a friend, [...] "What is the good of knocking a woman about with your fists? You only hurt <b>yourself.</b> <b>You</b> should hit her with a hammer same as I did and [...] her up." [...] A hammerhead was later found in the rubbish at his old house.|$|E
500|$|In 2010, he co-starred with Michelle Williams in Derek Cianfrance's directorial debut, {{the marital}} drama Blue Valentine. The low-budget film was mainly improvised and Gosling has said [...] "you {{had to remind}} <b>yourself</b> <b>you</b> were making a film". Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle felt he [...] "brings a preternatural {{understanding}} of people to his performance" [...] while A.O. Scott of The New York Times found him [...] "convincing as the run-down, desperate, older Dean, and maybe a bit less so as the younger version". Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly noted that he [...] "plays Dean as a snarky working-class hipster, but when his anger is unleashed, the performance turns powerful." [...] However, Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe felt the performance {{was an example of}} [...] "hipsterism misdirected". He was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama. The film was a box office success, grossing over $12 million worldwide from a production budget of $1 million. Gosling's second on-screen appearance of 2010 was in the mystery film All Good Things with Kirsten Dunst, based on a true story. He played the role of New York real-estate heir Robert Durst, who was investigated for the disappearance of his wife (played by Dunst). Gosling found the filming process to be a [...] "dark experience" [...] and did not undertake any promotional duties for the film. When asked if he was proud of the film, he replied, [...] "I'm proud of what Kirsten does in the movie." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone felt he [...] "gets so deep into character you can feel his nerve endings." [...] Mick La Salle of the San Francisco Chronicle found the [...] "chameleonic Gosling is completely convincing as this empty shell of a man". Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times felt that the film belonged to Dunst, but noted that Gosling [...] "is good too". The film grossed $644,535 worldwide.|$|E
