The one which he selects, arches his neck and goes off to work with a whole string of the others following. Dodsley--that is my groom's name--tells me that he does a great deal more mowing now than he need, simply because they worry him for the work. Gratitude, you see, Mr. Ledsam, sheer gratitude.

'Of course,' he said placidly, 'that puts quite a different complexion upon the matter, Dr. Greatrex. I'm very glad to hear young Mr. Le Breton's such an excellent and trustworthy person.

40|$|Proper soil pH is {{necessary}} to produce a healthy, high-quality, attractive lawn. Lime is often applied to Arkansas lawns to help raise the soil pH near neutral, which increases the availability of most plant nutri-ents. The first step in liming <b>your</b> home <b>lawn</b> is to obtain a soil test before applying any nutrients. A soil test provides key information including soil pH, potassium and phosphorous levels. Soil testing is free through county Cooperative Extension Service offices. Collect soil samples in a bucket from the upper 4 to 6 inches of soil from ten or more locations around the yard. Remove any vegetative material such as stems and leaves. Air dry and mix the samples thoroughly. Take about 1 pint of the mixture to your county Extension office for analysis (for more information see FSA 2121, Test Your Soil for Plant Food and Lime Needs). Soil can be sampled {{any time of the}} year, but sampling lawns in late fall, early winter or late spring will help expedite the process, since the soil test lab has many agri-cultural samples to test in late winter and spring. Soil pH and Liming Soil pH {{is a measure of the}} soil acidity or alkalinity. The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14. A pH of 7. 0 is neutral. Values less than 7. 0 indicate acid conditions, while readings over 7. 0 indicate alkaline conditions. Soil pH can have a dramatic effect on plant growth and on soil nutrient availability. Nutrients essential to plant growth are most available between pH 5. 8 and 6. 5. Lime (usually CaCO 3, calcium carbonate) may be used to reduce soil acidity and improve nutrient availability. Data indicates that about 50 percent of lawns in Arkansas have a below optimum soil pH (≤ 5. 7) (Figure 1) ...|$|R

[...] You lay that pointless clergy-weapon by, [...] 420 [...] And to the laws, your sword of justice, fly. [...] Now this your sects the more unkindly take [...] (Those prying varlets hit the blots you make), [...] Because some ancient friends of yours declare, [...] Your only rule of faith the Scriptures are, [...] Interpreted by men of judgment sound, [...] Which every sect will for themselves expound; [...] Nor think less reverence to their doctors due [...] For sound interpretation, than to you. [...] If then, by able heads, are understood [...] 430 [...] Your brother prophets, who reform'd abroad; [...] Those able heads expound a wiser way, [...] That their own sheep their shepherd should obey. [...] But if you mean yourselves are only sound, [...] That doctrine turns the Reformation round, [...] And all the rest are false reformers found; [...] Because in sundry points you stand alone, [...] Not in communion join'd with any one; [...] And therefore must be all the Church, or none. [...] Then, till you have agreed whose judge is best, [...] 440 [...] Against this forced submission they protest: [...] While sound and sound a different sense explains, [...] Both play at hardhead till they break their brains; [...] And from their chairs each other's force defy, [...] While unregarded thunders vainly fly. [...] I pass the rest, because your Church alone [...] Of all usurpers best could fill the throne. [...] But neither you, nor any sect beside, [...] For this high office can be qualified, [...] With necessary gifts required in such a guide. [...] 450 [...] For that which must direct the whole must be [...] Bound in one bond of faith and unity: [...] But all your several Churches disagree.

[...] Now since you grant some necessary guide, [...] All who can err are justly laid aside: [...] Because a trust so sacred to confer [...] 476 [...] Shows want of such a sure interpreter; [...] And how can he be needful who can err? [...] Then, granting that unerring guide we want, [...] That such there is you stand obliged to grant: [...] 480 [...] Our Saviour else were wanting to supply [...] Our needs, and obviate that necessity. [...] It then remains, the Church can only be [...] The guide, which owns unfailing certainty; [...] Or else you slip your hold, and change your side, [...] Relapsing from a necessary guide. [...] But this annex'd condition of the crown, [...] Immunity from errors, you disown; [...] Here then you shrink, and lay your weak pretensions down. [...] For petty royalties you raise debate; [...] 490 [...] But this unfailing universal state [...] You shun; nor dare succeed to such a glorious weight; [...] And for that cause those promises detest [...] With which our Saviour did his Church invest; [...] But strive to evade, and fear to find them true, [...] As conscious they were never meant to you: [...] All which the Mother Church asserts her own, [...] And with unrivall'd claim ascends the throne. [...] So, when of old the Almighty Father sate [...] In council, to redeem our ruin'd state, [...] 500 [...] Millions of millions, at a distance round, [...] Silent the sacred consistory crown'd, [...] To hear what mercy, mix'd with justice, could propound: [...] All prompt, with eager pity, to fulfil [...] The full extent of their Creator's will.

40|$|Moss is {{a common}} {{occurrence}} in home lawns. Most often it becomes a problem in lawns that have low turf density. It appears when growing conditions favor the growth of moss more than the turf. Moss does not kill grass but rather moves into lawn areas that are weak and thin.

40|$|Mowing is {{the most}} timeconsuming lawn {{maintenance}} practice, {{but it is not}} without its merits. The primary purpose of mowing a lawn is to improve its appearance. Proper mowing technique, equipment, frequency and height will improve the quality of a lawn while also increasing the health of the turfgrass plants and decreasing weeds. Plant Physiology Mowing is a destructive practice because it reduces the amount of leaf tissue available for the production of energy. The general response to mowing is for the plant to produce more leaf tissue to replace what is lost. If too much leaf tissue is removed in any one mowing, plants will respond by redirecting energy away from valuable roots to producing new leaves. Additionally, turfgrass cannot efficiently capture nutrients and produce energy when mown too low. Therefore, proper mowing is a key ingredient to a successful, healthy lawn. Figure 1. Never remove {{more than one-third of the}} leaf blade in a single mowing. Take-Home Points • Mow often enough to avoid removing more than one-third of the grass blade height per cutting. • Mow <b>your</b> <b>lawn</b> high. • Keep the blades sharp enough to prevent a ragged appearance. • Return clippings. • Mow in a different pattern each time to reduce wear, compaction, scalping and grain. • If you get behind in mowing, raise the mowing height so as not to remove more than one-third of the leaf, then gradually reduce the mowing height in subsequent weeks. Mow Frequently Mow as often as needed to never remove more than one-third of the leaf blade in a single mowing (Figure 1). In other words, if your mower is set at 3 inches, mow before <b>your</b> <b>lawn</b> reaches 4. 5 inches high (Table 1) ...|$|E

40|$|Pests are {{generally}} defined as living organisms {{that are found}} at the wrong place and time. Pests normally enter the house {{in search of food}} and the house becomes a harborage for them to hide and breed. Despite all the technological advances of the past half century, the researcher has not come very far in the battle against critters. Pest control is actually refers to the regulation or management of another species defined as a pest, usually because it is believed to be detrimental to a person’s health, the ecology or the economy. Pest control is also at least as old as agriculture. In order to maximize food production, it can be economically advantageous to protect crops from competing species of plants, as well as from herbivores competing with humans. In April 1944, a Better Homes and Gardens magazine article suggested readers handle moles this way: "You can dig them out if you're patient.
