She {{had a reputation}} for her skill as a lecturer, which stemmed from her time at University College, Dundee. Mackinnon gave broadcast talks for schools and numerous lectures, with a reputation that she never repeated a lecture in 30 <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>teaching.</b> These included lectures on the diseases spread by flies, and how good hygiene and the prevention of flies breeding could stop typhoid. She also set up a research centre in protozoology, the only non-medical protozoological research centre in Britain.|$|E

40|$|Studies of {{beginning}} teachers' readiness to teach indicate {{a range of}} areas in which these teachers feel nervous about teaching, prior to beginning their first <b>teaching</b> position. Studies <b>of</b> the first <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>teaching</b> demonstrate that the reality shock <b>of</b> <b>teaching</b> is something that affects beginning teachers {{in a variety of}} ways. The literature on the stages of teacher development tells us that the "survival" stage in teaching can last throughout the whole first <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>teaching.</b> This New Zealand study follows seven beginning teachers through their first <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>teaching</b> and identifies the points at which the teachers began to say, "I'm getting on top of it now"...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper explores {{conversations between}} {{beginning}} English teachers {{about their experiences}} during their first <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>teaching.</b> These teachers are all located at the same school, and in their conversations they share their thoughts and feelings about their common struggle {{to make sense of}} the English curriculum they found at this school. As a beginning teacher myself (I am in my third <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>teaching),</b> I discuss my own experiences, positioning myself within the paper as part of this “novice ” teaching community, and interpreting their conversations from this perspective. The paper seeks to draw out their feelings about their emerging professional identity as English teachers, and the challenges they have faced in their first <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>teaching...</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{validity}} of the estimation strategy relies {{on the assumption that}} teachers in their tenure evaluation year are similar to teachers with the same <b>years</b> <b>of</b> experience but <b>teach</b> in a district with a longer probationary period. For example, third year teachers in districts that award tenure in the third <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>teaching</b> are similar to third year teachers in districts that award tenure in the fourth <b>of</b> fifth <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>teaching.</b> Said another way, there should not be cross-sectional variation in teacher or district characteristics unrelated to tenure that modify teacher behavior during this evaluation period.|$|R

25|$|Lowrey then persuaded a friend, Colonel William C. Falkner, {{to run his}} {{railroad}} {{near the}} college.

The school became quite a success and 3 generations of Lowrey's became presidents of the school himself, two of his sons and a grandson. Following several <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>teaching</b> at the Blue Mountain College, Lowrey became very sick and, in 1882, his doctors alerted him that his heart was very weak.

40|$|It is {{recognised}} worldwide that {{beginning teachers}} require more support as reasons for high attrition rates (e. g., lack of appreciation from colleagues, unsatisfying working conditions, inadequate teacher preparation) indicate current systems are failing them. One way of addressing their specific needs {{is to understand}} their achievements and challenges during their first <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>teaching.</b> This qualitative study tracks 10 beginning primary teachers’ achievements and challenges at two points (April and September) during their first <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>teaching</b> in Australian public schools. Findings showed that building relationships and behaviour management were considered achievements at these two points, yet behaviour management was also considered a challenge. Other challenges included: learning differentiation, working with parents, and negotiating a life-work balance. Induction into the school culture and infrastructure continued to be important, especially developing skills on handling difficult parents and creating a life-work balance. Simultaneously, they required mentoring for effective teaching in classroom management and differentiation. A two-prong approach of induction into the school culture and infrastructure and mentoring for effective teaching needs to continue throughout the first <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>teaching,</b> and possibly beyond...|$|R

Meanwhile, Lays, his wife and unmarried daughters, had retired to Ingrandes in the Loire valley, where they joined his married daughter Marie-Cécile. Here he had already witnessed the death of his son Bertrand from consumption and was soon to see his wife stricken with paralysis. In his final years Lays spent his time singing hymns in local churches. He died aged 73 in 1831, leaving his wife and children the paltry sum of 1056 francs.|$|E
25|$|In the Indian {{education}} system, a teacher’s {{success is}} loosely defined. It is either {{based on a}} student’s success or based on the <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>teaching</b> experience, both of which do not necessarily correlate to a teacher’s skill set or competencies. The management of an institution could thereby be forced to promote teachers based on the grade level they teach or their seniority, {{both of which are}} often not an indicator of a good teacher. This means that either a primary school teacher is promoted to a higher grade, or a teacher is promoted to take up other roles within the institution such as Head of Department, coordinator, Vice Principal or Principal. However, the skills and competencies that are required for each of them vary and a great teacher may not be a great manager. Since teachers do not see their own growth and success in their own hands, they often do not take up any professional development. Thus, {{there is a need to}} identify a framework to help a teacher chart a career path based on his/her own competency and help him/her understand his/her own development.|$|E

She was also asked to resign from her position as Professor of Psychology at Colegio William Morris. [...] In 1952, rather than join the Peronista supporters and betray her ideals, she took full retirement. When elected, Perón had instituted a massive overhaul of the health system of Argentina. He appointed Ramón Carrillo as his health minister, and in the beginning, hospital beds were added, vaccination programs were instituted, a campaign against malaria was launched, and other improvements were made. However, by the early 1950s it was clear that policies were unevenly applied, implementation was erratic, and political cronyism was working against the provision of health services for those most in need. Two years after Ferrari resigned, Carrillo also resigned, disillusioned with the Perón administration.|$|E
500|$|McGovern then {{returned}} to his alma mater, Dakota Wesleyan, and became {{a professor of history}} and political science. With the assistance of a Hearst fellowship for 1949–50, he continued pursuing graduate studies during summers and other free time. The couple's third daughter, Teresa, was born in June 1949. Eleanor McGovern began to suffer from bouts of depression, but continued to assume the large share of household and child-rearing duties. McGovern earned a Ph.D. in history from Northwestern University in 1953. His 450-page dissertation, The Colorado Coal Strike, 1913–1914, was a sympathetic account of the miners' revolt against Rockefeller interests in the Colorado Coalfield War. His thesis advisor, noted historian Arthur S.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if student perceptions of teacher effectiveness as measured by two selected instruments would correlate significantly when measured during the student teaching experience and after one <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>teaching</b> experience. A second purpose was to determine if administrator perceptions as measured by two selected instruments would correlate significantly with student perceptions during the student teaching experience and after one <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>teaching</b> experience. ^ Student perceptions were measured by the 7 -A Student Questionnaire (7 -A SQ) and the Purdue Teacher Evaluation Scale (PTES). Administrator or supervisor perceptions were measured by the Student Teacher Reference (STR) form and a validated Administrator Evaluation (AE) form. ^ Eleven hypotheses were investigated to answer the basic questions of this study. These questions were: (1) What is the relationship between scores from the PTES and 7 -A SQ taken during the student teaching experience and scores from the PTES and 7 -A SQ taken after one <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>teaching</b> experience? (2) What is the relationship between scores from the student perception instruments, 7 -A SQ and PTES, and scores from the administrator perception instruments, STR and AE, both during the student teaching experience and after one <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>teaching</b> experience. ^ Student and administrator perceptions from the actual teaching experience were gathered during the last quarter <b>of</b> the first <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>teaching</b> experience. Statistical procedures included use of the Pearson correlation, dependent t-test, and step-wise regression analyses. The research hypotheses were tested at the. 05 level of significance. ^ The major findings of this study were as follows: (1) Scores of the 7 -A SQ during the student teaching experience significantly correlated to scores found one year later, but the PTES scores did not. (2) The two most significant predictors of Administrator Evaluation scores were STR scores and 7 -A SQ scores. ^ Findings of this study support the conclusion that information sources are valuable in determining teacher effectiveness. If, however, only one source of information were available when considering a first year candidate, the most predictive source would be the student teaching supervisor rating. ...|$|R
