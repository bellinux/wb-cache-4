500|$|The JAMs {{were not}} entirely sure {{what they would have}} said to ABBA if they had been able to meet them. Rockman told NME: [...] "We were hoping to explain [...] to them and that maybe we'd come out of it friends, you know, them {{producing}} our album and us producing theirs—the kind of thing that often happens at these meetings." [...] King Boy: [...] "Yeah, we'd have said, 'Look, you haven't had many hits lately, you don't really wanna bother with all this West End musical shit do <b>you?</b> <b>Come</b> <b>and</b> do the new JAMMS [...] album.'" [...] In 1994, The Guardian looked back on the Swedish sojourn as [...] "a grand, futile, attention-grabbing gesture, the kind that would come to characterise [...] collaborative career... "We were being totally stupid about it" [...] Drummond later acknowledged." ...|$|E
500|$|Looking back on {{the tour}} as a whole, and in {{combination}} with the preceding Magic Tour, Billboard magazine cover story stated that [...] "Even for an artist who has largely built his career on epic shows, Springsteen and the E Streeters have managed to find yet another gear at this stage in their legendary career." [...] Springsteen himself said, [...] "With the end of these shows, we're coming {{to the end of a}} decade-long project that really was a tremendous renewal of the power, the strength and the service that our band hopefully provides." [...] Springsteen also touted the quality of the shows: [...] "I believe if <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> see us now you're seeing the best E Street Band that's ever played." [...] Specific shows from the tour were named as among the best concerts of 2009 by Spin magazine, The Philadelphia Inquirer, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, and the Chicago Tribune.|$|E
500|$|During {{the final}} {{stretch of the}} tour, the final encores of many shows {{presented}} a long, rousing, ebullient rendition of Jackie Wilson's classic [...] "(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher". [...] Showcasing featured vocals from Cindy Mizelle or Curtis King and trumpet solos from Curt Ramm, the song stretched to eight minutes with key changes, reprises, and walks through the pit area by Springsteen and the singers, and became {{recognized as one of}} the highpoints of the entire tour. [...] Springsteen dispelled any notion of this being the final E Street Band show or the last for a long time; in an interview near the end of the tour he said, [...] "We're playing to an audience now that will outlive us. But at the same time the band is very, very powerful right now. And part of the reason it's powerful is that it's carrying a lot of very strong cumulative history. <b>You</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> you see 35 years of a speeding train going down the track, and you're gonna get to be on the front end of it. We look forward to many, many more years of touring and playing and enjoying it." ...|$|E

500|$|In a video filmed by singer John Legend, US President Barack Obama appears {{with his}} wife Michelle {{performing}} part of the [...] "Single Ladies" [...] routine. He also briefly performed the hand-twirl move from the song's video at the Obama Inaugural Celebration. This video prompted an Obama look-alike, Iman Crosson, to do {{his own version of}} the [...] "Single Ladies" [...] choreography. Several other well-known personalities, including American environmentalist and politician Joe Nation and American actor Tom Hanks, have performed the dance. In the music video for [...] "Dancin on Me" [...] by DJ Webstar and Jim Jones, three females are featured in the background, imitating the [...] "Single Ladies" [...] dance. Wearing a black leotard and gold glove, Katy Brand performed the choreography with two backup female dancers for the final of BBC One's Let's Dance for Comic Relief {{to raise money for the}} charity Comic Relief on March 12, 2010. Jenna Ushkowitz, Chris Colfer and Heather Morris did the [...] "Single Ladies" [...] dance as part of the Glee Live tour in June 2011. The music minister at Geyer Springs First Baptist Church in Little Rock, Arkansas, thought it would be [...] "an excellent idea" [...] to attract interest in the church choir by using a remix of [...] "Single Ladies" [...] and having choir members dance to it. In the music video he made, the choir members sing, [...] "All the singing ladies, all the singing fellas... If you like the choir, then won't <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> sing in it." [...] Cyndi Wilkerson, Music Ministry Assistant at Geyer Springs First Baptist Church, uploaded the video to YouTube on August29,2011. In April 2013, YouTube phenomenon Psy did the dance routine during a concert in Seoul while wearing a red leotard and red boots. A television advert for the South African cellular service Vodacom, used the song as a backdrop to an actor who was humorously mimicking Beyoncé's dancing, the advert quickly went viral and spawed several different variations.|$|E
2500|$|After {{recording}} The Midnight Organ Fight, {{the current}} quartet line-up was completed {{with the addition}} of guitarist/keyboardist Andy Monaghan of Piano Bar Fight (who have previously played as support to Frightened Rabbit). In an interview, Scott mentions that he [...] "met him on New Year's Eve, in Glasgow, in a bar. I was really hammered and I was like 'why don't <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> play some shows with us man?' and he was like 'Yeah!'. The next day, I got a text like 'Do you remember… did you say something about this or is it my imagination?'".|$|E
2500|$|In the Zohar, Rabbi Jose expounded on [...] "And let every wise-hearted man among <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> {{make all}} that the Lord has commanded." [...] Rabbi Jose taught that when God told Moses in [...] "Get you wise men and men of discernment," [...] Moses searched all of Israel but did not find men of discernment, and so in [...] Moses said, [...] "So I took the heads of your tribes, wise men, and full of knowledge," [...] without {{mentioning}} men of discernment. Rabbi Jose deduced that the man of discernment (navan) is of a higher degree than the wise man (hacham), for even a pupil who gives new ideas to a teacher is called [...] "wise." [...] A wise man knows for himself as much as is required, but the man of discernment apprehends the whole, knowing both his {{own point of view}} and that of others. [...] uses the term [...] "wise-hearted" [...] because the heart was seen to be the seat of wisdom. Rabbi Jose taught that the man of discernment apprehends the lower world and the upper world, his own being and the being of others.|$|E
