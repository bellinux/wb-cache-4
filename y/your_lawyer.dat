500|$|The tour {{coincided with}} {{speculation}} {{about a possible}} Beatles reunion, {{as well as an}} agreement regarding the official dissolution of their partnership, which would be ratified following the receipt of all four members' signatures in December 1974. With Starr opting to sign in London, to avoid being subpoenaed by Klein upon entering the United States, Harrison and McCartney provided their signatures in New York on 19 December. Throughout the tour, Harrison changed a line in [...] "Sue Me, Sue You Blues" [...] to reflect the turnaround in his, Lennon's and Starr's allegiances over the previous two years – [...] "Bring <b>your</b> <b>lawyer</b> and I'll bring Klein" [...] name-checking the common enemy of all four ex-Beatles by 1974. Instead of a copy of the Bible, as in the studio versions of the song, Harrison now sang [...] "Hold your Gita in your hand".|$|E
2500|$|In 1962, Wells {{had three}} Top 10 hits with [...] "Will <b>Your</b> <b>Lawyer</b> Talk to God", [...] "Unloved Wanted," [...] and [...] "We Missed You". Beginning in 1964, Wells' albums began {{to chart the}} Top Country Albums chart, {{starting}} with the LP, Especially for You. Some of Wells' albums peaked within the Top 10 on that chart. That same year, her singles began {{to return to the}} Top 10 with [...] "This White Circle on My Finger" [...] and [...] "Password", both of which peaked at No. 7 on the Billboard Country Chart. In 1965, Wells had her last Top 10 hit with [...] "Meanwhile, Down At Joe's" [...] and in 1966, Wells then had her final Top 20 hit with [...] "It's All Over But the Crying", which peaked at No. 14 on the country charts.|$|E
2500|$|In 1988, {{while he}} was {{traveling}} to Philadelphia from Pakistan, Gilani was arrested by police in Frankfurt, West Germany after two kilos of heroin were found hidden in a false bottom in his suitcase. Gilani quickly made a plea deal when his case was {{handed over to the}} U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, agreeing to surrender his partners in Philadelphia in exchange for a lighter sentence. Gilani's cooperation earned him four years in prison while his two associates were sentenced to eight and ten years. At his sentencing hearing, the judge made the following statement: [...] "It's up to you, Mr. Gilani, to do what you can with the rest of your life. You are still a young man. You can either take advantage of this opportunity. Your mother, <b>your</b> <b>lawyer,</b> people said some nice things about you, but what you did, not only to yourself, but to perhaps thousands, hundreds of victims, heroin users in this country is a terrible thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "God bless my soul," [...] Mr. Bullsom exclaimed, in much excitement. [...] "It's <b>your</b> <b>lawyers,</b> then, {{who have}} been {{advertising}} for Mary?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I sell {{anything}} that commands a price. How do <b>your</b> <b>lawyers</b> live, <b>your</b> politicians, your intriguers, your {{men of the}} Exchange? How do you live? How do you come here? Have you sold no friend? Lady of mine! I rather think, yes!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have {{discharged}} <b>your</b> <b>lawyer's</b> bill; and, as I {{believe you}} are more fitted for the trade you formerly exercised than for any other, I will give five hundred pounds {{for the purchase of}} a stock and shop, when you shall find one to suit you.|$|R
2500|$|In 2009, {{he worked}} on a TV film version of the RSC's 2008 Hamlet for BBC Two. From October 2009, he hosted the Masterpiece Contemporary {{programming}} strand on the American Public Broadcasting Service. In December 2009, he filmed the lead in an NBC pilot, Rex Is Not <b>Your</b> <b>Lawyer,</b> playing Rex, a Chicago lawyer who starts to coach clients to represent themselves when he starts suffering panic attacks. The pilot was not picked up and the project was shelved.

For this role he was nominated as Best Actor at the Royal Television Society Programme Awards 2010.

6000|$|... 'This is {{the very}} person,' she said, 'whom <b>your</b> <b>lawyer</b> thought likely to help him, {{when he was trying}} to trace the lost courier.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{not only}} <b>your</b> <b>lawyer,</b> Jane; I am also your friend and counsellor. Do {{you realize what}} this bequest means?" [...] he asked, gently.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, why not?" [...] said Ida, in bitter sarcasm. [...] "Mr. Cossey {{knows it}} is a good argument. I presume, Mr. Cossey, that as a {{preliminary}} to the renewal of our engagement, the persecution of my father which is being carried on by <b>your</b> <b>lawyers</b> will cease?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Mr Boffin, I {{happened}} to be in Chancery Lane this morning, when I saw you going along before me. I took the liberty of following you, trying to make up my mind to speak to you, till you went into <b>your</b> <b>lawyer's.</b> Then I waited outside till you came out.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As for that, I won't {{leave you}} except when {{you send me}} away," [...] he declared. [...] "And my advice! If you want that, {{the right thing to}} me seems simple enough. Go at once to <b>your</b> <b>lawyers.</b> They will tell you the proper course. At the worst, the man could be bought off for the present." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I would," [...] said Mary. [...] "I'll be <b>your</b> <b>lawyer,</b> {{and manage}} {{your side of}} the {{question}} for you; and we will get a regular decision." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “No; you can’t take <b>your</b> <b>lawyer</b> {{along when}} you visit a sick man. Still, if he’s {{not quite as}} bad as Aynsley thinks, {{you may as well}} be on your guard.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, we won't quarrel {{about that}} {{until we see}} how the legacy turns out. It may not be worth my time up here. I shall charge you roundly as <b>your</b> <b>lawyer,</b> depend on that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{remind you}} of this, my friend--directing to <b>your</b> <b>lawyers,</b> whose names I {{remember}} when their letter to you was publicly read in the Common Room. Once {{or twice a year}} I shall continue to {{remind you of}} those parting words of mine: there will be a time perhaps when you will thank me for doing so.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Call me five-and-thirty {{years of}} age. I {{have seen the}} world. I have lived here, and lived there, and lived like a gentleman everywhere. I have been treated and {{respected}} as a gentleman universally. If you try to prejudice me by making out that I have lived by my wits--how do <b>your</b> <b>lawyers</b> live--your politicians--your intriguers--your men of the Exchange?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear good Mr. Eglantine, send to <b>your</b> <b>lawyers</b> {{and stop}} this horrid prosecution--take Mr. Walker's {{acknowledgment}} for the debt. If he is free, he {{is sure to}} have a very large sum of money in a few days, and will pay you all. Do not ruin him--do not ruin me by persisting now. Be the old kind Eglantine you were." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There's {{another matter}} {{to be settled}} before I go," [...] Benjulia proceeded. [...] "Here are some papers, which I have {{received}} from <b>your</b> <b>lawyer,</b> Mr. Moot. They relate to a slander, which your wife unfortunately repeated--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Look here!' said Pallant {{over the}} paper. 'I don't suppose you or those asinine J.P.'s knew it--but <b>your</b> <b>lawyer</b> {{ought to have}} known that you've all put your foot in it most confoundedly over this assault case.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I got Currie to make {{notes for}} me which I {{can get at}} in my room,' said Owen. 'You can set <b>your</b> <b>lawyer</b> to write to the places, and satisfy {{yourself}} without letting him know anything about it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Two {{years ago}} I came to Marseilles. I admit that I was poor; I had been ill. When <b>your</b> <b>lawyers,</b> <b>your</b> politicians, your intriguers, your {{men of the}} Exchange fall ill, and have not scraped money together, they become poor. I put up at the Cross of Gold,--kept then by Monsieur Henri Barronneau--sixty-five at least, and in a failing state of health. I {{had lived in the}} house some four months when Monsieur Henri Barronneau had the misfortune to die;--at any rate, not a rare misfortune, that. It happens without any aid of mine, pretty often.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Mountjoy, who {{has been}} ill and in Scotland, has come back to London. He begs {{me to tell you}} that he has had an {{interview}} with <b>your</b> <b>lawyers,</b> and has learned that you have been in town on business, the nature of which he has also learned. He has left an important letter for you at their office. They will forward it as soon as they learn your address.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why?" [...] echoed Gwendolen, {{playing at}} sauciness; [...] "because I can't eat pâté de foie gras {{to make me}} sleepy, and I can't smoke, and I can't go to the club to make me like to come away again--I want a variety of ennui. What {{would be the most}} {{convenient}} time, when you are busy with <b>your</b> <b>lawyers</b> and people, for me to have lessons from that little Jewess, whose singing is getting all the rage." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We must {{talk all}} that over with <b>your</b> <b>lawyer,</b> in {{connection}} with something I've just heard of." [...] He told her of Pinney's scheme, and he said, [...] "We must see if we can't turn it to account." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, {{but how did}} {{you offer}} it to him, what? I mean to say, I bet you got <b>your</b> <b>lawyer</b> to write him a letter full of whereases, peradventures, and parties of the first part, and so forth. No good, old companion!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That settles Long Jim, an' now if <b>your</b> <b>lawyer</b> is {{as smart}} as {{he appears to be}} it won't take long to show that Hazelton didn't have {{anything}} to do with the burglar tryin' to get me in jail," [...] Teddy replied, with a sigh.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{must see}} to it that I do find it an asset, and a {{valuable}} one," [...] she answered. [...] "You are relieved now from any fear of that deed being produced. There is no shadow of evidence to connect you with the man Sinclair, or with my brother's transaction with him. If <b>your</b> <b>lawyers</b> are clever and you are brave, you must win your case with honor, and Hefferom will be sent to prison. He deserves it, in any case." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When, {{by placing}} them in your hands," [...] said Mr Hatton {{finishing}} a sentence {{which might have been}} awkward, [...] "I had the extreme satisfaction of confirming the rights and calming the anxieties of one of our ancient houses. I would recommend your lordship to instruct <b>your</b> <b>lawyers</b> to appear to this writ as a matter of course. But enter into no details, no unnecessary confidence with them. They are needless. Treat the matter lightly, especially to them. You will hear no more of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't say that, Mr. Mason. I {{was only}} a lad at the time, and could not have managed it at all. But they didn't ferret about enough. Mr. Mason, there's a deal better {{evidence}} than any that is given by word of mouth. A clever counsel can turn a witness pretty nearly any way he likes, but he can't do that with little facts. He hasn't the time, you see, to get round them. <b>Your</b> <b>lawyers,</b> sir, didn't get up the little facts as they should have done." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{can call}} it curiosity, or {{whatever}} you like," [...] Deane answered. [...] "The only point is that I want you to answer me a question, and forget that I have ever asked it you. <b>Your</b> <b>lawyer</b> is like your confessor, isn't he--your lawyer and your doctor?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mebbe 'yes' and mebbe 'no,' Mrs. Wade," [...] {{interrupted}} the man, {{with a wave}} of his hat; [...] "but how about them two checks to bearer for two hundred dollars each found among your husband's effects, and collected by <b>your</b> <b>lawyer</b> for you--MY CHECKS, Mrs. Wade?" ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{smiled at}} my recital. “Pickings,” he concluded; “Cooky’s pickings. And don’t {{you think your}} miserable life worth the price? Besides, {{consider}} it a lesson. You’ll learn in time {{how to take care}} of your money for yourself. I suppose, up to now, <b>your</b> <b>lawyer</b> has done it for you, or your business agent.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course!" [...] Bertram answered, with grim sarcasm in his face, [...] "of course! I {{might have}} guessed it. If there IS an {{injustice}} or a barbarity possible, I {{might have been}} sure the law of England would make haste to perpetrate it. But you needn't fear, Frida. Long before the law of England could be put in motion, I'll have completed my arrangements for taking you--and them too--with me. There are advantages sometimes even in the barbaric delay of what <b>your</b> <b>lawyers</b> are facetiously pleased to call justice." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I {{began to}} fear that in your haste you had gone on board the wrong steamer--two others sailed to-day, a little later than ours, and I went to their piers and made all sorts of inquiries, but I could find out nothing. Then I went to your club, to <b>your</b> <b>lawyer's</b> office, and several other places where I {{supposed}} you might go, {{but no one had}} seen or heard of you. Then a fear began to creep over me that you had had some greatly depressing news from Miss Laniston, and that you had made away with yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Grisley, I have {{an offer}} to make to you," [...] went on Tom {{addressing}} himself directly {{to the old man}} and utterly ignoring Belright Fogg. [...] "You don't know me, but let me say that my father and my uncle are worth a good deal of money. I am in business in New York with my father, and our concern {{has a great deal of}} money to invest. Now, if you will agree to hold this mortgage for thirty days, I will guarantee to have it paid in full at that time with every cent of interest. And in addition to that I will pay you twenty-five dollars for your trouble and for <b>your</b> <b>lawyer's</b> fees." ...|$|R
