500|$|The {{movement}} organizers {{found themselves}} out of money after the amount of required bail was raised. Because King was the major fundraiser, his associates urged him to travel the country to raise bail money for those arrested. He had, however, previously promised to lead the marchers to jail in solidarity, but hesitated as the planned date arrived. Some SCLC members grew frustrated with his indecisiveness. [...] "I have never seen Martin so troubled", one of King's friends later said. After King prayed and reflected alone in his hotel room, he and the campaign leaders decided to defy the injunction and prepared for mass arrests of campaign supporters. To build morale and to recruit volunteers to go to jail, Ralph Abernathy spoke at a mass meeting of Birmingham's black citizens at the 6th Avenue Baptist Church: [...] "The {{eyes of the world}} are on Birmingham tonight. Bobby Kennedy is looking here at Birmingham, the United States Congress is looking at Birmingham. The Department of Justice is looking at Birmingham. Are <b>you</b> <b>ready,</b> are <b>you</b> <b>ready</b> to make the challenge? I am ready to go to jail, are you?"

A version of [...] "Are <b>You</b> <b>Ready</b> for the Summer?", a camp theme song sung by children in the comedy film Meatballs, is featured.

Mike and the robots make particular note of film critic Leonard Maltin's relatively high two and-a-half star rating of the original film. The episode also makes several references to McDowall's performances in the Planet of the Apes films, and makes several jokes at the expense of Deezen and his stereotypically nerdy character, at one point dubbing him [...] "heir to the Arnold Stang fortune".

500|$|During the 1970s, Jennings {{joined the}} Outlaw Country movement. He {{released}} critically acclaimed albums Lonesome, On'ry and Mean and Honky Tonk Heroes followed by hit albums Dreaming My Dreams {{as well as}} Are <b>You</b> <b>Ready</b> for the Country. In 1976, he released the album Wanted! The Outlaws with Willie Nelson, Tompall Glaser, and Jessi Colter, the first platinum country music album. That success was followed by Ol' Waylon and the hit song [...] "Luckenbach, Texas". Jennings was featured in the 1978 album White Mansions performed by various artists documenting the lives of white people in the Confederacy during the Civil War. The songs on the album were written by Paul Kennerley. By the early 1980s, Jennings was struggling with a cocaine addiction, which he quit in 1984. Later, he joined the country supergroup The Highwaymen with Nelson, Kris Kristofferson, and Johnny Cash, which released three albums between 1985 and 1995. During that period, Jennings released the successful album Will the Wolf Survive. He toured less after 1997 {{to spend more time}} with his family. Between 1999 and 2001, his appearances were limited by health problems. On February 13, 2002, Jennings died from complications of diabetes.|$|E
500|$|The {{basic premise}} of the episode, {{as well as the}} design of Peter's panic room, are based on the movie Panic Room. When Peter's Paleolithic {{ancestor}} is attempting to market the wheel, Brian tells him [...] "You so money, you don't even know it", a reference to the film Swingers. His ancestor says [...] "Let's party like it's 9" [...] in reference to the Prince song [...] "1999." [...] The story of Nate Griffin, an ancestor of Peter, makes references to the first installment of Roots, as well as the LAPD's low-speed pursuit of O. J. Simpson following his wife's murder and the song [...] "Hot for Teacher". Nate Griffin {{is a member of the}} tribe of Tootie-and-Blair, a reference to The Facts of Life. The scene in which the slave ship captain is thrown overboard uses the song [...] "Are <b>You</b> <b>Ready</b> For the Summer?" [...] from the film Meatballs. The story about Peter's ancestor who was a silent film star is a spoof of Singin' in the Rain, as the girl in Singin' in the Rain did not have a good voice for the talking pictures. His speaking voice, deemed unacceptable for talkies, was a spoof of Bobcat Goldthwait.|$|E

[...] Here's the sound of Sarah Palin's husband's snowmobile when it won't start. (followed by a loud screeching noise)."

500|$|In 1973, Jennings {{released}} Lonesome, On'ry and Mean and Honky Tonk Heroes, {{the first}} albums recorded and released under his creative control. The release of these albums heralded a major {{turning point for}} Jennings, kicking off his most critically and commercially successful years. More hit albums followed with This Time and The Ramblin' Man, both released in 1974. The title tracks of both albums topped the Billboard Country singles chart, with the self-penned [...] "This Time" [...] becoming Jennings's first no. 1 single. Dreaming My Dreams, released in 1975, included the no. 1 single [...] "Are You Sure Hank Done It This Way" [...] and was his first album to be certified gold by the RIAA; {{it was also the}} first of his next six consecutive, solo studio albums to be certified gold or higher. In 1976, Jennings released Are <b>You</b> <b>Ready</b> for the Country, Jennings wanted the record to be produced by Los Angeles producer Ken Mansfield. Although RCA denied the request, Jennings and The Waylors went to Los Angeles and recorded with Mansfield at his expense. After a month, Jennings presented the master tape to Chet Atkins, who decided to release it. The album hit number one on Billboards country albums three times the same year, topping the charts for 10 weeks. It was named Country album of the year in 1976 by Record World magazine and it was certified gold by the RIAA.|$|E
500|$|After WrestleMania, Michaels {{was forced}} into {{temporary}} retirement due to a legitimate back injury sustained at the Royal Rumble, with Triple H taking over the leadership position in DX, claiming that his now-former associate had [...] "dropped the ball". He introduced the returning X-Pac the night after WrestleMania and joined forces with The New Age Outlaws. As 1998 went along, DX became more popular, turning the group from villains to fan favorites. During this time, he adopted an entrance gimmick of asking the crowd [...] "Are <b>you</b> <b>ready?</b> I said, are you ready?", followed by a parody of rival promotion WCW's ring announcer Michael Buffer's famous catch-phrase, [...] "Let's get ready to rumble", substituting the word [...] "rumble" [...] with the DX slogan, [...] "suck it". Also during this time, Triple H began a feud with {{the leader of the}} Nation of Domination and rising WWF villain, The Rock. This storyline rivalry eventually led to a feud over the Intercontinental Championship, which Triple H won in a ladder match at SummerSlam. He did not hold the title long, however, as he was sidelined with a legitimate knee injury. When The Rock won the WWF Championship at Survivor Series, the rivalry between the two continued, as DX fought The Corporation stable of which The Rock was the main star and Triple H received a shot at the WWF Championship on the January 25, 1999 Raw Is War in an [...] "I Quit" [...] match, but the match ended when Triple H was forced to quit or see his aide Chyna chokeslammed by Kane. This began a new angle for Triple H, as Chyna betrayed him by attacking him after the match and joining The Corporation.|$|E

500|$|DJ Kool Herc {{developed}} the style {{that was the}} blueprint for hip hop music. Herc used the record {{to focus on a}} short, heavily percussive part in it: the [...] "break". Since this part of the record was the one the dancers liked best, Herc isolated the break and prolonged it by changing between two record players. As one record {{reached the end of the}} break, he cued a second record back to the beginning of the break, which allowed him to extend a relatively short section of music into [...] "five-minute loop of fury". This innovation had its roots in what Herc called [...] "The Merry-Go-Round," [...] a technique by which the deejay switched from break to break at the height of the party. This technique is specifically called [...] "The Merry-Go-Round" [...] because according to Herc, it takes [...] one [...] "back and forth with no slack." [...] Herc told The New York Times that he first introduced the Merry-Go-Round into his sets in 1972. The earliest known Merry-Go-Round involved playing James Brown's [...] "Give It Up or Turnit a Loose" [...] (with its refrain, [...] "Now clap your hands! Stomp your feet!"), then switching from that record's break into the break from a second record, [...] "Bongo Rock" [...] by The Incredible Bongo Band. From the [...] "Bongo Rock"'s break, Herc used a third record to switch to the break on [...] "The Mexican" [...] by the English rock band Babe Ruth. Kool Herc also contributed to developing the rhyming style of hip hop by punctuating the recorded music with slang phrases, announcing: [...] "Rock on, my mellow!" [...] "B-boys, b-girls, are <b>you</b> <b>ready?</b> keep on rock steady" [...] "This is the joint! Herc beat on the point" [...] "To the beat, y'all!" [...] "You don't stop!" [...] For his contributions, Herc is called a [...] "founding father of hip hop," [...] a [...] "nascent cultural hero," [...] and an integral part of the beginnings of hip hop by Time.|$|E

Passenger Lauren Grandcolas called her husband twice, once before takeoff and once during the hijacking. He missed both of her calls. She then passed her phone to Honor Elizabeth Wainio. Wainio called her stepmother at 09:53:43 and concluded, four and a half minutes later, by saying, [...] "I have to go. They're breaking into the cockpit. I love you." [...] Jarrah dialed in the VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) frequency for the VOR navigational aid at Reagan National Airport at 09:55:11 to direct the plane toward Washington, D.C.

[...] Beamer told Jefferson that the group was planning to [...] "jump on" [...] the hijackers and fly the plane into the ground before the hijackers' plan could be followed through. Beamer recited the Lord's Prayer and the 23rd Psalm with Jefferson, prompting others to join in. Beamer requested of Jefferson, [...] "If I don't make it, please call my family and let them know how much I love them." [...] After this, Jefferson heard muffled voices and Beamer clearly answering, [...] "Are <b>you</b> <b>ready?</b> Okay. Let's roll." [...] These were Beamer's last words to Jefferson.|$|E
