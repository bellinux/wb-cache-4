While there he received {{a visit from the}} then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to thank him for large donations to the National Gallery. She reportedly helped speed his recovery by telling him, [...] "My dear Mr. Getty, we mustn't let things get us down, must we? We'll have <b>you</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>here</b> as soon as possible." [...] During a low period in the 1970s Getty had been cheered up by the former England cricketer and later President of the MCC, Gubby Allen, having previously been introduced to the game by Mick Jagger of the Rolling Stones.|$|E

6000|$|... "Mr. Blake, I've {{been to see}} Lucy," [...] went on Pan, and swiftly {{he talked}} of the girl, her unhappiness, and the faith she still held in her father. [...] "I've come to get <b>you</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>here,</b> for Lucy's sake. We're all going to Arizona. You and Dad can make a new start in life." ...|$|E

6000|$|The trooper {{laughed a}} little. [...] "I guess there is. It's {{down in the}} orders that whoever's on patrol near the {{settlement}} should keep his eye on you. You see, if <b>you</b> lit <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>here</b> {{we would want to}} know just where you were going to." ...|$|R

6000|$|Bradley laughed aloud. [...] "I {{thought we}} English were {{supposed}} to have the least sense of humor of any people in the world," [...] he cried; [...] "but now I've found one human being who hasn't any.

6000|$|... "I shall {{stand in}} {{as close as}} I dare and then put her round. I shall {{presently}} find means to smuggle <b>you</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>here</b> into the sail-locker, which communicates with the lobby. But there is an opening, a sort of square for hauling the sails out, which gives straight on the quarter-deck and which is never closed in fine weather, so as to give air to the sails. ' When the ship's way is deadened in stays and all the hands are aft at the main-braces you shall have a clear road to slip out and get overboard through the open quarter-deck port. I've had them both fastened up. Use a rope's end to lower yourself into the water {{so as to avoid}} a splash--you know. It could be heard and cause some beastly complication." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I {{make you}} big, <b>you</b> can't get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>here</b> again," [...] said she, [...] "and if you remain little Nimmie Amee will laugh at you. So make your choice." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You can't {{have too}} many nice suits," [...] he said, approvingly, [...] "not a young feller like you that wants to look nice. All the nice girls like a young feller that dresses nice.

6000|$|He {{understood}} her very well. His eyes fell {{and his face}} knotted in sudden gravity. [...] "I was afraid of that--that's why I came. Yes, <b>you</b> must get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>here</b> at once." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Standing," [...] he said slowly, [...] "I've {{given you}} all the rope I am going to. I am {{sick and tired of}} your stubbornness. My {{patience}} is exhausted. Doctor Jackson says you are in condition to stand ten days in the jacket. You can figure your chances. But I am going to give you your last chance now. Come across with the dynamite.

I'll let you loaf for six months on hospital grub, and then I'll put you trusty in the library. You can't ask me to be fairer with you than that. Besides, you're not squealing on anybody. You are the only person in San Quentin who knows where the dynamite is. You won't hurt anybody's feelings by giving in, and you'll be all to the good from the moment you do give in. And if you don't--" ...|$|E

One of the band's early songs was [...] "Ich hol dich hier raus" [...] (I'm getting <b>you</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>here),</b> which was based on the theme tune of German television series Ein Fall für zwei.

5000|$|Halo is {{the debut}} album of guitarist and {{composer}} Andy Hawkins, issued under the moniker Azonic. It {{was released on}} July 1, 1994 by Strata Records.

5000|$|The ride {{starts in}} a MRT (Metropolis Rapid Transit) subway station. Warnings of tremors make it {{essential}} {{to move to}} the next station. This move is done via a typical tire drive system. Many special effects follow such as gas mains bursting, a pumping station blowing resulting in a flood and collapsing walls. Then a blue streak is seen followed by Superman saying [...] "Don't worry folks, there's only one way out of this mess. Heads back. I'll push <b>you</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>here.</b> Fast. Superman fast." [...] This line is followed by the main 100 km/h launch. The train launches up the ride's top hat, followed by a heavily banked turn to the right. The train then speeds up and over the first camel hump before briefly entering the second story of the ride's station building for a sharp left hand turn. Upon exiting the building riders enter the second camel hump, which creates a headchopper effect with the first. The third banked turn wraps in parallel to the first, but crosses over it and into the brake run. At this point riders will hear John Williams' famous score from Superman. There is a gift shop after the ride where people can buy Superman merchandise and on-ride photos.|$|E
40|$|My {{greatest}} gratitude {{goes out}} to my supervisor Dr Daniel Chan. He helped me pick the topic for this thesis {{which turned out to}} be extremely interesting, helped me with the writing of this thesis and most importantly never refused to spend time with me to help me learn mathematics. I thank him deeply for this. I would to also like thank my high school maths teacher Ian Denton for getting me interested in mathematics to begin with. Similarly, a special thanks goes to Dr Ian Doust who, in response to my email requesting permission to avoid doing any algebra courses replied: “I’m not going to let <b>you</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>here</b> with a pure maths degree without seeing some proper group theory!”. I hope this thesis shows that I have learnt the basics of group theory, and Ian will let me graduate. Thank you to Kenneth and Hugo, for helping me throughout this year, and thank you to Anna for being supportive and putting up with me. Special thanks also goes to my family...|$|E
