25|$|Dholes produce {{whistles}} {{resembling the}} calls of red foxes, sometimes rendered as coo-coo. How this sound is produced is unknown, {{though it is}} thought to help in coordinating the pack when travelling through thick brush. When attacking prey, they emit screaming KaKaKaKAA sounds. Other sounds include whines (food soliciting), growls (warning), screams, chatterings (both of which are alarm calls) and <b>yapping</b> cries. In contrast to wolves, dholes do not howl or bark. Dholes have a complex body language. Friendly or submissive greetings are accompanied by horizontal lip retraction and the lowering of the tail, as well as licking. Playful dholes open their mouths with their lips retracted and their tails held in a vertical position whilst assuming a play bow. Aggressive or threatening dholes pucker their lips forward in a snarl and raise the hairs on their backs, as well as keep their tails horizontal or vertical. When afraid, they pull their lips back horizontally with their tails tucked and their ears flat against the skull.|$|E

40|$|The {{transcriptional}} coactivator Yes-associated protein (<b>YAP)</b> {{plays an}} important role in organ-size control and tumorigenesis. However, how <b>Yap</b> gene expression is regulated remains unknown. This study shows that the Ets family member GABP binds to the <b>Yap</b> promoter and activates <b>YAP</b> transcription. The depletion of GABP downregulates <b>YAP,</b> resulting in a G 1 /S cell-cycle block and increased cell death, both of which are substantially rescued by reconstituting <b>YAP.</b> GABP can be inactivated by oxidative mechanisms, and acetaminophen-induced glutathione depletion inhibits GABP transcriptional activity and depletes <b>YAP.</b> In contrast, activating <b>YAP</b> by deleting Mst 1 /Mst 2 strongly protects against acetaminophen-induced liver injury. Similar to its effects on <b>YAP,</b> Hippo signaling inhibits GABP transcriptional activity through several mechanisms. In human liver cancers, enhanced <b>YAP</b> expression is correlated with increased nuclear expression of GABP.

40|$|Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{contains}} eight {{members of}} a novel and fungus-specific family of bZIP proteins that is defined by four atypical residues on the DNA-binding surface. Two of these proteins, <b>Yap</b> 1 and <b>Yap</b> 2, are transcriptional activators involved in pleiotropic drug resistance. Although initially described as AP- 1 factors, at least four <b>Yap</b> proteins bind most efficiently to TTACTAA, a sequence that differs at position +/- 2 from the optimal AP- 1 site (TGACTCA); further, a Yap-like derivative of the AP- 1 factor Gcn 4 (A 239 Q S 242 F) binds efficiently to the <b>Yap</b> recognition sequence. Molecular modeling suggests that the Yap-specific residues make novel contacts and cause physical constraints at the +/- 2 position that {{may account for the}} distinct DNA-binding specificities of <b>Yap</b> and AP- 1 proteins. To various extents, <b>Yap</b> 1, <b>Yap</b> 2, <b>Yap</b> 3, and <b>Yap</b> 5 activate transcription from a promoter containing a <b>Yap</b> recognition site.

In BN rats, highest increase in <b>Yap</b> 1 -tyr 357, p 73 phosphorylation and Caspase 3 cleavage occurred. In human HCCs with poorer prognosis (3 years survival; HCCB). In the latter, higher levels of phosphorylated <b>YAP</b> 1 -ser 127, <b>YAP</b> 1 -tyr 357 and p 73, <b>YAP</b> 1 ubiquitination, and Caspase 3 cleavage occurred. Expression of stemness markers NANOG, OCT- 3 / 4, and CD 133 were highest in HCCP and correlated with <b>YAP</b> 1 and <b>YAP</b> 1 -TEAD levels. In HepG 2, Huh 7, and Hep 3 B cells, forced <b>YAP</b> 1 over-expression led to stem cell markers expression and increased cell viability, whereas inhibition of <b>YAP</b> 1 expression by specific siRNA, or transfection of mutant <b>YAP</b> 1 which does not bind to TEAD, induced opposite alterations.

2500|$|Wolves were hunted in both Czarist and Soviet Russia with borzoi by {{landowners and}} Cossacks.

40|$|Summary: Although YAP-dependent {{transcription}} {{is closely}} associated with liver tumorigenesis, the mechanism by which <b>YAP</b> maintains its function is poorly understood. Here, we show that TFCP 2 is required for YAP-dependent transcription and liver malignancy. Mechanistically, <b>YAP</b> function is stimulated by TFCP 2 via a WW-PSY interaction. TFCP 2 also maintains <b>YAP</b> stability by inhibiting Î²TrCP. Notably, genomic co-occupancy of <b>YAP</b> and TFCP 2 is revealed. TFCP 2 acts as a transcription co-factor that stimulates <b>YAP</b> transcription by facilitating <b>YAP</b> binding with <b>YAP</b> binding motif (YBF) -containing transcription factors. Interestingly, TFCP 2 also stimulated the YAP-TEAD interaction and TEAD target gene expression. Finally, several genes co-regulated by <b>YAP</b> and TFCP 2 that contribute to YAP-dependent tumorigenesis are identified and verified. Thus, we establish a model showing that TFCP 2 acts as a <b>YAP</b> co-factor to maintain YAP-dependent transcription in liver cancer cells, suggesting that simultaneous targeting of both <b>YAP</b> and TFCP 2 may be an effective therapeutic approach. : Zhang etÂ al. reveal that TFCP 2 acts as a <b>YAP</b> co-factor to stimulate YAP-dependent liver malignancy. <b>YAP</b> binds to TFCP 2 via a WW-PSY interaction, which facilitates the binding of <b>YAP</b> to transcription factors that contain the <b>YAP</b> binding motif.

40|$|In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the {{transcription}} factor <b>Yap</b> 8 {{is a key}} determinant in arsenic stress response. Contrary to <b>Yap</b> 1, another basic region-leucine zipper (bZIP) yeast regulator, <b>Yap</b> 8 has a very restricted DNA-binding specificity and only orchestrates the expression of ACR 2 and ACR 3 genes. In the DNA-binding basic region, <b>Yap</b> 8 has three distinct amino acids residues, Leu 26, Ser 29 and Asn 31, at sites of highly conserved positions in the other <b>Yap</b> family of transcriptional regulators and Pap 1 of Schizosaccharomyces pombe. To evaluate whether these residues are relevant to <b>Yap</b> 8 specificity, we first built a homology model of the complex <b>Yap</b> 8 bZIP-DNA based on Pap 1 -DNA crystal structure. Several <b>Yap</b> 8 mutants were then generated in order to confirm {{the contribution of the}} residues predicted to interact with DNA. Using bioinformatics analysis together with in vivo and in vitro approaches, we have identified several conserved residues critical for <b>Yap</b> 8 -DNA binding. Moreover, our data suggest that Leu 26 is required for <b>Yap</b> 8 binding to DNA and that this residue together with Asn 31, hinder <b>Yap</b> 1 response element recognition by <b>Yap</b> 8, thus narrowing its DNA-binding specificity. Furthermore our results point to a role of these two amino acids in the stability of the <b>Yap</b> 8 -DNA complex...|$|R
