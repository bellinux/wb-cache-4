2500|$|Having {{become a}} devoted fan of Tori Amos' music in 1993, (particularly the song [...] "Winter" [...] from the Little Earthquakes album), and {{following}} {{a meeting with}} Amos at the 2008 San Diego Comic Con, Foley became involved with the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN), a group Amos co-founded in 1994. Since then, he {{has worked as a}} volunteer on their online hotline and as a member of their National Leadership Council. During a 15-month period ending in April 2011, Foley logged more than 550 hours talking to victims online. The same month, Foley offered to mow anyone's lawn who donated at least $5,000 to the organization, stating, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> survivors of sexual assault, or just want to see a big guy with long hair mowing your lawn in front of your friends, please take part..." ...|$|E
6000|$|Laura hesitated, {{and then}} gave him her hand. [...] "After all, I think <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>help,</b> and if you agree to leave Frank alone--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're very wonderful," [...] Mr. Longdon {{presently}} returned. [...] "A {{year and}} a half ago <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> me <b>to</b> <b>help</b> Mr. Vanderbank." ...|$|R
5000|$|Eh，你要不要我帮你叫CAB（出租车）？ (Eh, do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> me <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>you</b> call a cab?) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{see it all}} now." [...] A {{brilliant}} inspiration {{had suddenly}} obscured her humour. She sat down suddenly, and he sat down too. [...] "You did it," [...] she said, [...] "because <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> me. And <b>you</b> thought I was too Conventional <b>to</b> take <b>help</b> from one I might think my social inferior." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think Murray knows a {{lot about}} that job. If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> Jimmy I know where you can get the dope that will start something, anyway." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] said I, [...] "enough said. If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> me, there's {{no doubt}} but I'll be glad of it, and none but I'll be grateful." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You'll {{have your}} hands full if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> every waif that comes along," [...] said Dave's uncle, with a smile. [...] "Every big city has {{hundreds}} of them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Oh, I know,' says Fergus, amiable, 'that I'm not handy {{at small}} talk. Or large, either. That's why I'm telling <b>you.</b> I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|KEITH. [Dryly] I'm {{trying to}} get at truth. If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> me <b>to</b> <b>help,</b> I must know everything. What makes you think she's fond of you? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O Matildy, I wish I {{could do}} {{something}} for <b>you!</b> I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>you</b> so. I feel so bad that I didn't come before. Ain't they somethin'?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am going}} to {{advertise}} and then try all the leading hotels," [...] was the answer. [...] "I {{have a list of}} them here. If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>help,</b> you can visit one group of them while I visit another." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't mention {{my little}} {{brothers}} and sisters--don't make me break down quite!" [...] she said. [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> them--God knows they need it--do it without telling me. But no, no!" [...] she cried. [...] "I will take nothing from you, either for them or for me!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Girl, if <b>YOU</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> me more--bring me some bread an' meat. Don't tell any one. Look what a ragamuffin I am.... An' there's Wildfire. I don't {{want him}} seen till I'm--on my feet again. I know riders.... That's all. If {{you want to}} be so good--come." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What did he mean, Betts?" [...] asked Isaac, {{going back}} to his sister after he had closed the door. [...] "Didn't <b>you</b> <b>want</b> him <b>to</b> <b>help</b> you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There," [...] {{she said}} pantingly, placing her burden in his lap, [...] "if <b>you</b> really <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>help,</b> there's {{something}} <b>to</b> do that isn't very fatiguing. You may shell these peas." ...|$|R
500|$|... "She {{was unhappy}} with the whole damn thing, so I went in and {{sweetened}} {{up a lot of}} music for her, adding some guitars to 'Lucky Star', some voices, some magic. [...] I just <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do the best job I could do for her. When we would play back 'Holiday' or 'Lucky Star', you could see that she was overwhelmed by how great it all sounded. <b>You</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> her, <b>you</b> know? As much as she could be a bitch, when you were in groove with her, it was very cool, very creative." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> me," [...] I said, [...] "stop {{here and}} sleep in my wife's room to-night. Only let me go away with my mind easy about Laura, and I answer for {{everything}} else. Come, Marian, give me a kiss, and show {{that you have the}} courage to wait till I come back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you know}} the forces you are up against? Have you looked into the unfathomable heart of this trouble? Understood the tug of the towns, the call of money to money; grasped the {{destructive}} restlessness of modern life; the abysmal selfishness of people when you threaten their interests; the age-long apathy of those <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>help?</b> Have you grasped all these?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Stop!" [...] said Basil sternly. [...] "Stop {{while there}} is yet time. Do {{you want to take}} part in a great work, Mr Bingham? Do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> in the glory of Europe--in the glory of science? Do you want to carry your head in the air when it is bald or white because of the part that you bore in a great discovery? Do you want--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "See here," [...] {{he said to}} Sladen, [...] "you can't {{use this}} hotel for an {{employment}} office. If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> hire <b>help,</b> <b>you</b> {{have got to do}} it on the outside." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, young man, {{it seems}} to me that bein' a friend to such a woman would be what <b>you</b> wouldn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> an' couldn't <b>help....</b> What's <b>to</b> be done to you for it?" ...|$|R
500|$|... "Since {{the rise}} of modern economics, Christians {{have been forced to}} give up their {{criticism}} of greed, because the economists said [...] "greed is good, and if <b>you</b> really <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> people, be as greedy as possible."” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And there's {{never the}} need to be," [...] he assured her. [...] "Surely you can be guided by me if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> me. As soon as ever my leg gets well again I'll be after fending for myself, and trouble you no further. But {{if you want to}} shelter me until then, do it thoroughly, and don't give way to fear at every shadow without {{substance}} that falls across your path." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{received}} his champions with reproof:--'This {{is the very}} thing I {{told you not to}} do. It is all your foolish jealousy and suspicion of them. There is not a man on the island who is not friendly to me! And if they were not friendly, what business have you with your bows and arrows? I tell you once more, if I see you take your bows again, though you may do it as you think with a good intention towards me, I will not stay at your village. If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> me, receive the Word of God, abandon your senseless ceremonies. That will be helping me indeed!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't!" [...] pleaded Mrs. Lecount. [...] "Oh, if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> {{these poor}} girls, don't talk in that way! Soften his resolution, ma'am, by entreaties; don't {{strengthen}} it by threats!" [...] She a little overstrained {{the tone of}} humility in which she spoke those words--a little overacted the look of apprehension which accompanied them. If Magdalen had not seen plainly enough already that it was Mrs. Lecount's habitual practice to decide everything for her master in the first instance, and then to persuade {{him that he was}} not acting under his housekeeper's resolution but under his own, she would have seen it now.|$|E
6000|$|For {{several days}} Doctor Bronson came twice daily to see Rose. He made little comment upon her condition, except {{to state that}} she had {{developed}} peritonitis, {{and he was not}} hopeful. Soon Rose took a turn for the worse. The doctor came to Lane's room and told him the girl would not have the strength to go through with her ordeal. Lane was so shocked he could not speak. Dr. Bronson's shoulders sagged a little, an unusual thing for him. [...] "I'm sorry, Daren," [...] he said. [...] "I know <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> the poor girl out of this. But too late. I can ease her pain, and that's all." ...|$|R
60|$|One never-to-be-forgotten day, {{shortly before}} the end of her visit, a series of horrible {{accidents}} resulted in their being left to lunch together alone. The Babe had received no previous warning, and when he was suddenly confronted with this terrible state of affairs he almost swooned. The lady's steady and critical inspection of his style of carving a chicken completed his downfall. His previous experience of carving had been limited to those entertainments which went by the name of 'study-gorges', where, if <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> a chicken, <b>you</b> took hold of one leg, invited an accomplice to attach himself to the other, and pulled.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no!" [...] {{repeated}} Richard. He {{would not}} have his friend get into trouble on his account for the world. [...] "I am much obliged <b>to</b> <b>you</b> for <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> me, indeed I am, but I'd rather leave the thing as it is." ...|$|R
5000|$|In a {{statement}} announcing the new song, VanderWaal explained the inspiration behind it, saying: [...] "'Moonlight' is about somebody {{you know very}} well changing unnaturally over time {{right in front of you}} and pushing you away, so <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> bring them back to their original self." ...|$|E
5000|$|Wrestling legend Mick Foley is also {{a member}} of RAINN's {{national}} leadership council and has worked as a volunteer on its online hotline. During a 15-month period ending in April 2011, Foley logged more than 550 hours talking to victims online.

5000|$|Singer-actor Michael Crawford was {{the fourth}} member of the team, along with their trainer. He became a mentor to them around 1981, {{and went on to}} help them create their 1983 and 1984 Olympic routines, and [...] "taught them how to act". Crawford said of them, [...] "I found them to be {{delightful}} young people, the kind <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> if you can." [...] (The Times November 1982). He was present with their trainer at the ringside, when the team won their perfect Olympics score with their Boléro routine. (Source: Torvill and Dean's 1996 autobiography partially cited at) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{you have}} {{got to take care of}} that other matter of twelve {{thousand}} dollars the middle of next month; don't forget that," [...] broke in the lawyer. And then he added: [...] "Of course, if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> money <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>you</b> out----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why {{should you}} smash up {{everything}} in that way, Peacocke? You're comfortable here; why not remain so? I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> hurt <b>you.</b> I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> you;--and I can. Three hundred dollars wouldn't be much to you. You {{were always a}} fellow as had a little money by you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now if <b>you</b> really <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>help,</b> {{just keep}} this child quiet while I {{see to the}} sickest ones," [...] said Belle, dumping a stout infant on to his knee, {{thrusting}} an orange into his hand, and leaving him aghast while she unpacked her little messes, and comforted the maternal bird.|$|R
