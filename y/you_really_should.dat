6000|$|... "Over {{your books}} again: my dear! <b>You</b> <b>really</b> <b>should</b> not {{overwork}} yourself. Writing something"; here the aunt clutches the manuscript, {{and looks at}} it vaguely.|$|E
6000|$|... 'But, my good fellow, <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>should</b> {{give some}} one else a chance. This {{is the third}} time you have been--and at such an hour, too!' ...|$|E
60|$|CAPT. G. 'Wish I hadn't, {{but they}} insist on falling sick. Minnie, if I were <b>you</b> I <b>really</b> <b>should</b> not {{investigate}} those papers. You may come across {{something that you}} won't like.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{just what}} Joe was saying. Will <b>you</b> <b>really?</b> I <b>should</b> be awfully glad if you would. Boxing with Joe is all right, but you feel {{all the time}} he's fooling with you. I should like to try how I got on with {{somebody}} else." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{can hardly}} mean, my dear," [...] persisted her husband, [...] "that <b>you</b> <b>really</b> think I <b>should</b> {{be all the}} better for getting drunk--even occasionally." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Come,' said Mr. Temple, who {{now joined}} them, 'if <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>should</b> {{like to take}} a stroll round the grounds, I will order the keeper to meet us at the cottage.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, write that, and I shall {{always say}} I was partly the author. <b>You</b> <b>really</b> <b>should</b> {{give me a}} commission, you know. Well, good bye, tell your mother I called. Why, there she is, I declare. Oh, Susan, just come and hear the {{delightful}} plot for a novel that I have been giving Mary." ...|$|E
60|$|MRS. ERLYNNE. You don't {{look at all}} well, Lord Augustus. You stop up too late--it is so bad for you. <b>You</b> <b>really</b> <b>should</b> {{take more}} care of yourself. Good-bye, Lord Windermere. [Goes towards door with a bow to LORD AUGUSTUS. Suddenly smiles and looks back at him.] Lord Augustus! Won't you see me to my carriage? You might carry the fan.|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>you</b> <b>really</b> think, Tommy--I <b>should</b> say Jane, you {{can manage}} the--the whole of it? You won't mind being sent on a message, perhaps in the very middle of your cooking. It was that I was {{thinking}} of, Tommy--some cooks would." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hard, indeed," [...] said Leo, {{sitting down}} beside him, [...] "I fear {{it begins to}} tell upon poor Benjy. <b>You</b> <b>should</b> <b>really</b> order him to rest more than he does, uncle." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In the F.H.M.P., of course, I {{see a lot}} {{of young}} girls placed in {{delicate}} positions, just on the borders, don't <b>you</b> know? <b>You</b> <b>should</b> <b>really</b> join the F.H.M.P., Mrs. Dallison. It's a first-rate thing--most absorbing work." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, you {{cannot be}} too {{cautious}} {{if you are}} to stand well with the family. You do well {{to be on your}} guard. Martindale only the second son, and the elder may marry any day. That was one thing I thought I ought to speak to you about. <b>You</b> <b>really</b> <b>should</b> try to get some settlement made on you. You have nothing to depend upon, and, you see, you cannot expect anything from home.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Within a {{few weeks}} of this date the Reverend Uttermust Dumfarthing moved into the manse of St. Osoph's and assumed his charge. And {{forthwith}} he became the sole topic of conversation on Plutoria Avenue. [...] "Have you seen the new minister of St. Osoph's?" [...] everybody asked. [...] "Have you been to hear Dr. Dumfarthing?" [...] "Were you at St. Osoph's Church on Sunday morning? Ah, <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>should</b> go! most striking sermon I ever listened to." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Since {{the first}} {{symptoms}} of her disease appeared, on Saturday last, I cannot find that any error {{has been committed}} in the medical treatment, as reported to me. I remained some time by her bedside to-day, observing her. The delirium which is, more or less, an invariable result of Typhus, is particularly marked in her case, and manifests itself both by speech and gesture. It has been found impossible to quiet her, by any means hitherto tried. While I was watching by her, she never ceased calling on your name, and entreating to see you. I am informed by her medical attendant, that her wanderings have almost invariably taken this direction for the last four-and-twenty hours. Occasionally she mixes other names with yours, and mentions {{them in terms of}} abhorrence; but her persistency in calling for your presence, is so remarkable that I am tempted, merely from what I have heard myself; to suggest that <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>should</b> go to her, on the bare chance that you might exercise some tranquillising influence. At the same time, if you fear infection, or for any private reasons (into which I have neither the right nor the wish to inquire) feel unwilling to take the course I have pointed out, do not by any means consider it your duty to accede to my proposal. I can conscientiously assure you that duty is not involved in it.|$|E
6000|$|Alice {{carefully}} {{released the}} brush, and {{did her best}} to get the hair into order. 'Come, you look rather better now!' she said, after altering most of the pins. 'But <b>really</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> have a lady's maid!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! how glad I {{should be}} to pay his debts and repay all he has done for me," [...] cried Mrs. Walker. [...] "Think of his giving two hundred guineas to Mr. Baroski to have me taught. Was {{not that kind of}} him? Do <b>you</b> <b>REALLY</b> think I <b>should</b> succeed? ...|$|R
60|$|And now {{allow me}} to ask, do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> think I <b>should</b> permit the line from Richmond via Manaasas Junction to this city to be entirely open, except what {{resistance}} could be presented by less than 20,000 unorganized troops? This is a question which the country will not {{allow me to}} evade.|$|R
5000|$|... "The {{view from}} 'Mike Badger's Country Side' is {{frequently}} breathtaking. <b>You</b> <b>really</b> <b>should</b> catch {{it while you}} can." [...] Tim Peacock (Whisperin and Hollerin).|$|E
5000|$|PC Zone {{magazine}} in the UK commented that it is [...] "a great little indie game, it's cheap and <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>should</b> play it." ...|$|E

2500|$|She {{spent much}} of her {{childhood}} apart from other children, although she devoted much time to her pets, whom she adored. She eventually made friends with a group of other girls in Torquay, and she noted that [...] "one of the highlights of my existence" [...] was her appearance with them in a youth production of Gilbert and Sullivan's The Yeomen of the Guard, in which she played the hero, Colonel Fairfax. This was her last operatic role for, as she later wrote, [...] "an experience that <b>you</b> <b>really</b> enjoyed <b>should</b> never be repeated." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But you, Pauncefort,' said Cadurcis, 'why {{there must}} be some magic in the air here. I have been complimenting your lady and Miss Venetia; but <b>really,</b> <b>you,</b> I <b>should</b> almost have thought it was some younger sister.' ...|$|R
60|$|LADY CHILTERN. [Makes no answer, {{but remains}} standing. There is a pause. Then {{the eyes of}} the two women meet. LADY CHILTERN looks stern and pale. MRS. CHEVELEY seem rather amused.] Mrs. Cheveley, I think it is right to tell you quite frankly that, had I known who <b>you</b> <b>really</b> were, I <b>should</b> not have invited you to my house last night.|$|R
5000|$|PopMatters' John Garratt said, [...] "The best remix albums {{can capture}} the listener's {{imagination}} {{and take it}} down bold new paths. But in this case, if you want bold imagination, <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>should</b> side with the original Gloss Drop." ...|$|E
5000|$|I've been to Australia several times, {{these days}} mostly for Linux.Conf.Au. But my first trip—and the one when I was {{bitten by a}} ferocious fairy penguin: <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>should</b> keep those things locked up!—was in 93 or so, talking about Linux for the Australian Unix Users Group.|$|E
5000|$|As one of [...] "7 grammar rules <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>should</b> pay {{attention}} to", University of Delaware journalism and English Professor Ben Yagoda says [...] "Don't use comprised of. Instead use composed of/made up of." [...] But {{he does not}} explain how {{this is a matter of}} grammar rather than lexis, or what is wrong.|$|E
6000|$|... "My child," [...] he said, [...] "we {{have carried}} it too far. It {{was more than}} {{we ought to have}} {{required}} of you, and I knew it. I had made up my mind, and told my nephew that the first time <b>you</b> <b>really</b> asked I <b>should</b> tell the whole truth, and trust to your discretion, while of course he wished for nothing more." ...|$|R
5000|$|During an interview, Sidibe {{reported}} that before landing {{her role in}} the 2009 film, Precious, Joan Cusack advised her that the entertainment industry was not for her and to quit, leaning over and stating: [...] "Oh honey, <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>really</b> quit the business. It's so image-conscious." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What ought I say, Lord Rufford, {{in answer}} to that? Of course I did care. But I {{knew that it was}} {{impossible}} that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>really</b> set your affections on such a person as Miss Trefoil. I told Eleanor that it would come to nothing. I was sure of it." ...|$|R
5000|$|Whiting {{wrote his}} thesis on the factions of Japan's Liberal Democratic Party. His professor, Dr. Ori Kan, {{gave him an}} [...] "A" [...] on the project, though he {{tempered}} his praise for Whiting's scholarship (ironically, as it turns out, given Whiting’s later career path). [...] "Your research is outstanding,” he told Whiting “but <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>should</b> learn how to write." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Elvis Presley version {{featured}} {{two parts}} in German, {{the first one}} is the first four lines of [...] "", whereas the second part appears towards the end and is based on a translation of the English version (therefore not appearing in the original German folk lyrics). This part being [...] "" [...] This literally means [...] "Be good to me, Be good to me, Be to me how <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>should,</b> How you really should..." ...|$|E
5000|$|Patrick Simmons would {{recall that}} he chanced {{on the basic}} guitar lick for [...] "Black Water" [...] while at Warner Bros. Recording Studio (NoHo) for the {{recording}} sessions for the Doobie Brothers' 1973 album The Captain and Me: [...] "I was sitting out in the studio waiting between takes and I played that part. All the sudden I heard the talk-back go on and producer Ted Templeman says: 'What is that?' I said: 'It’s just a little riff that I {{came up with that}} I’ve been tweaking with.' He goes: 'I love that. <b>You</b> <b>really</b> <b>should</b> write a song using that riff.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{you would}} not tell it to her,--as yet! If all goes well with me I will tell it to her some day. Come, Sir Thomas, you don't mean to be hard upon me at last. It cannot be that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>really</b> regret that I have got out of that trouble." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know for}} a fact that there is a vacancy at the moment," [...] said the policeman, [...] "as I have the honour to be {{somewhat}} in the confidence of the chief of whom I have spoken. <b>You</b> <b>should</b> <b>really</b> come and see him. Or rather, I should not say see him, nobody ever sees him; but you can talk to him if you like." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Surely, a {{woman is}} bound to be {{cautious}} and listen to those who know the world better than she does." [...] said Sir James, with his little frown. [...] "Whatever you do in the end, Dorothea, <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>really</b> keep back at present, and not volunteer any meddling with this Bulstrode business. We don't know yet what may turn up. You must agree with me?" [...] he ended, looking at Mr. Farebrother.|$|R
