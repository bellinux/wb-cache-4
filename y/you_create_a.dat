One technique was the stutter edit, which Ahmadzaï clarified was not characteristic of his production and recording. [...] "People get upset {{because they think it}} is not natural to skip and stutter the music. But I do it because it is natural.

The track starts with a [...] "strummy" [...] acoustic guitar introduction, as described by Michael Paoletta from Billboard, on the four-chord progression of Bm–Fm–A–E sequence. The folk rock inspired song has elements of electronica and folk at its core. Its rhythm is [...] produced by a four piece bass drum—which fades in and out abruptly—and atmospheric synth-strings, which are added later in the song.|$|E

During the trip, Spotnitz met a [...] "friend of a friend," [...] who constantly mentioned an [...] "image that freaked him out." [...] The man explained that the image was a tube of toothpaste that, when opened, would have [...] "blood come out." [...] The mental image intrigued Spotnitz, who later postulated, [...] "How could <b>you</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> story where blood {{comes out of a}} tube of toothpaste?" [...] Due to the strangeness of the idea, Spotnitz was unable to think of any real-world scenarios having likeness to the image, so he began to look into [...] "dreams and nightmares." [...] He eventually {{came up with the idea}} of a cult trying to reach a higher plane of existence, but instead stumbling into a [...] "lower place, a darker plane." [...] Spotnitz later explained: [...] "What if the higher plane is a darker plane, what if we think we're reaching up but we're reaching down." [...] Complementarily, the episode's title, [...] "Via Negativa," [...] means [...] "Negative Way" [...] in Latin. [...] This type of theology, more commonly referred to as apophatic theology, attempts to describe God by expanding upon what God is not.|$|E

500|$|Hironobu Sakaguchi had {{intended}} to make a role-playing game (RPG) for a long time, but his employer Square refused to give him permission as it expected low sales of such a product. However, when the RPG Dragon Quest was released and {{proved to be a}} hit in Japan, the company reconsidered its stance on the genre and approved Sakaguchi's vision of an RPG inspired by [...] and [...] Only three of his colleagues volunteered to join this project headed by him because he was thought of as a [...] "rough boss" [...] in spite of his unsuccessful creations. Eventually, Final Fantasy was developed by a team of seven core staff members within Square referred to as the [...] "A-Team". Sakaguchi convinced fellow game designers Koichi Ishii and Akitoshi Kawazu to join the project. Kawazu was mainly responsible for the battle system and sequences, which he based heavily on the tabletop game Dungeons & Dragons and the RPG Wizardry. For example, enemies' weaknesses to elements such as fire and ice had not been included in Japanese RPGs up until that point. Kawazu had grown fond of such aspects of Western RPGs and decided to incorporate them into Final Fantasy. He also advocated the player's option to freely choose their own party member classes {{at the beginning of the}} game as he feels [...] "the fun in an RPG begins when <b>you</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> character".|$|E

2500|$|During the 20th century, as {{many women}} became better educated and more able to support themselves, fewer women found {{satisfaction}} {{in the position of}} being a mistress and {{were more likely to be}} in relationships with unmarried men. As divorce became more socially acceptable, it was easier for men to divorce their wives and marry the women who, in earlier years, might have been their mistresses. The practice of having a mistress continued among some married men, especially the wealthy. Occasionally, men married their mistresses. The late Sir James Goldsmith, on marrying his mistress, Lady Annabel Birley, declared, [...] "When you marry your mistress, <b>you</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> job vacancy".|$|E

[...] Often wrongly credited with the quote, Goldsmith admitted, [...] "I quoted him at dinner, and it was pinned on me. I don't mind. ... I just don't want to claim what's not mine." [...] On his infidelities, Lady Annabel revealed that, despite her aversion to any form of confrontation, [...] "I did feel jealous. I used to scream at him."

2500|$|Interviewed in 2015 by veteran Irish {{broadcaster}} Gay Byrne, Fry {{was asked}} {{what he would say}} if he came face-to-face with God.

It’s utterly, utterly evil. [...] Why should I respect a capricious, mean-minded, stupid God who creates a world which is so full of injustice and pain?" [...] Within days, the video was viewed over five million times. Fry later stated he did not refer to any specific religion, and said: [...] "I said quite a few things that were angry at this supposed God. I was merely saying things that Bertrand Russell and many finer heads of the mind have said for many thousands of years, going {{all the way back to}} the Greeks." [...] Because the God who created this universe, if it was created by God, is quite clearly a maniac, utter maniac.' In May 2017 it was announced that Fry, along with broadcaster RTÉ, were under criminal investigation for blasphemy under the 2009 Defamation Act, following a complaint from a member of the public about the broadcast: the case was dropped after the police confirmed that they had not been able to locate a sufficient number of offended people.|$|E

[...] . Thank Heaven, the storm has stranded me upon the everlasting Rock of Peter;--but it has been a sore trouble to reach it. Protestants, who look at creeds as things to be changed like coats, whenever they seem not to fit them, little know what we Catholic-hearted ones suffer. [...] . If they did, they would be more merciful and more chary in the requirements of us, just as we are in the very throe of a new-born existence. The excellent man, to whose care I have committed myself, has a wise and a tender heart [...] . he saw no harm in my concealing from my father the spiritual reason of my giving up my curacy (for I have given it up), and only giving the outward, but equally true reason, that I found it on the whole an ineligible and distressing post. [...] . I know you will apply to such an act that disgusting monosyllable of which Protestants are so fond. He felt with me and for me--for my horror of giving pain to my father, and for my wearied and excited state of mind; and strangely enough--to show how differently, according to the difference of the organs, the same object may appear to two people--he quoted in my favour that very verse which you wrest against me. He wished me to show my father that I had only changed my heaven, and not my character, by becoming an Ultramontane- Catholic [...] . that, as far as his esteem and affection were founded on anything in me, the ground of it did not vanish with my conversion. If I had told him at once of my altered opinions, he would have henceforth viewed every word and action with a perjudiced eye. [...] . Protestants are so bigoted [...] . but if, after seeing me for a month or two the same Luke that he had ever known me, he were gradually informed that I had all the while held that creed which he had considered incompatible with such a life as I hope mine would be--you must see the effect which it ought to have. [...] . I don't doubt that you will complain of all this. [...] . All I can say is, that I cannot sympathise with that superstitious reverence for mere verbal truth, which is so common among Protestants. [...] . It seems to me they throw away the spirit of truth, in their idolatry of its letter. For instance,--what is the use of informing a man of a true fact but to induce a true opinion in him? But if, by clinging to the exact letter of the fact, <b>you</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> false opinion in his mind, as I should do in my father's case, if by telling him at once of my change, I gave him an unjust horror of Catholicism,--you do not tell him the truth. [...] . You may speak what is true to you,-- but it becomes an error when received into his mind. [...] . If his mind is a refracting and polarising medium--if the crystalline lens of his soul's eye has been changed into tourmaline or Labrador spar- -the only way to give him a true image of the fact, is to present it to him already properly altered in form, and adapted to suit the obliquity of his vision; in order that the very refractive power of his faculties may, instead of distorting it, correct it, and make it straight for him; and so a verbal wrong in fact may possess him with a right opinion.
