6000|$|... 'Oh, I know I'm a pig, dear, am I not?' she exclaimed. 'Spoiling <b>your</b> <b>holiday.</b> But I couldn't help it, dear, indeed I could not.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are prejudiced, my dear. You {{would have}} enjoyed London {{if you had}} {{had the courage to}} brave its {{superficial}} gloom. Where did you spend <b>your</b> <b>holiday?</b> Paris?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'This {{snowstorm}} {{is a great}} {{trial for}} you; I begin to believe that, after all, you would be more pleased to take <b>your</b> <b>holidays</b> at another opportunity.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We can't {{always do}} exactly as we like, Ralph; though {{that is a}} lesson you have as yet to learn. What day did you say <b>your</b> <b>holidays</b> began?" ...|$|R
60|$|When will <b>your</b> <b>holiday</b> be? I sent {{your letter}} to my wife, and forget. Keep us in mind, and I hope {{we shall be}} able to receive you.|$|E
60|$|Bel. You are {{prince of}} the soil, sir, and may take your {{pleasure}} when you please; but I am the eve to <b>your</b> <b>holiday,</b> and must fast for being joined to you.|$|E
6000|$|... "Most likely, for {{she is a}} {{relation}} of Mrs. Curtis, and comes to be near her. You are to call for inspection at eleven o'clock tomorrow, so I fear <b>your</b> <b>holiday</b> will be short." ...|$|E
5000|$|Khandala - Another {{beautiful}} hill {{station in}} the Western Ghats on the Mumbai-Pune highway, just 69 km from Pune. Offers great time to spend <b>your</b> <b>holidays</b> due to its natural charm. Tiger’s Leap and the Duke’s nose are two key viewpoints for Tourists.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Do you know, dear,' said she, one evening, 'if {{you can get}} a week of <b>your</b> <b>holidays</b> now, I {{think it}} would be a very good thing for you to accept that {{invitation}} of Mr. Mildmay's, and spend a few days in golfing at Norwich.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh! {{but we are}} {{so happy}} now, Plantagenet. I cannot believe {{that we are going to}} part. And are you sure that you will return? Perhaps your {{guardian}} will not let you, and will wish you to spend <b>your</b> <b>holidays</b> at his house. His house will be your home now.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Hulton {{gave him}} his hand and {{indicated}} a chair. [...] "You have got thinner since you took <b>your</b> <b>holiday</b> and look fined down. Well, I reckon we all feel older since that night last fall." ...|$|E
6000|$|LADY CHESHIRE. [Smiling painfully]. Won't {{give him}} away? Both of you the same. What's {{the use of}} that with me? Look at me! Wasn't he with you when you went for <b>your</b> <b>holiday</b> this summer? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Suppose we all {{drive to}} the beach together," [...] {{suggested}} Mr. Merrick. [...] "We will try to help you enjoy <b>your</b> <b>holiday</b> {{and it will be}} a rich treat to us to have your society." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{has nothing}} to do with it," [...] the master said; [...] "and I am not going to discuss the utility of verses with you. I shall report you to Dr. Wallace, and if you will not work in <b>your</b> <b>holidays,</b> you will have to do so in your play-hours." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, you're not. You're not up in London now. You {{always have}} <b>your</b> <b>holidays.</b> If {{you choose to}} try it, I'll see that you have {{shooting}} enough while you're here. It's better than going to sleep under the trees. Ha, ha, ha! I wonder what made you lay yourself down there. You hadn't been fighting a bull that day?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pooh! The usual story! I want no such lame excuses! Some {{teachers}} might accept them, but not I! Go to your rooms, and at once,--and don't dare to come downstairs until to-morrow morning--or I'll {{cut off all}} <b>your</b> <b>holidays</b> until Christmas!" [...] And Job Haskers folded his arms and stood like a judge before the boys.|$|R
60|$|You {{are enjoying}} <b>your</b> <b>holiday?</b> {{and are still}} {{thinking}} sometimes of our Boston days, as I do? and are maturing schemes for coming here next summer? A satisfactory reply to the last question is particularly entreated.|$|E
6000|$|... 'My dear Ned,' Mr. Hawtrey said, feelingly, 'you {{are indeed}} a good friend. I {{do not know}} how to thank you enough, but I really do not like you to be wasting <b>your</b> <b>holiday</b> in this fashion.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... “We won’t {{discuss that}} point,” said Ossipon, {{with an air}} of rising above {{personal}} considerations. “I am afraid I’ll have to spoil <b>your</b> <b>holiday</b> for you, though. There’s a man blown up in Greenwich Park this morning.” ...|$|E
6000|$|She laughed gayly. This {{was more}} {{the man as}} he had been before the days of their engagement! [...] "I think it is the smell of the powder," [...] she said. [...] "You men are all like schoolboys for <b>your</b> <b>holidays.</b> Father says that the birds are much too wild, and that it will be all even you can do to hit them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My Bud, my darling, don't cry," [...] he said, tenderly {{drawing the}} fair head to his rugged bosom. [...] "I know {{it must be}} a great {{disappointment}} to have a week cut off <b>your</b> <b>holidays,</b> but I'll go down to Folkestone with you, an' take a lodging there, an you an' I will have a jolly time of it together--till I get another ship--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's my own Frank. What I said to mamma, I {{said because}} I thought it right; {{but you must}} not say that I am a Puritan. I would do {{anything}} {{in my power to}} make <b>your</b> <b>holidays</b> bright and pleasant. I know that boys require so much more to amuse them than girls do. Good night, dearest; pray don't overdo yourself with work, and do take care of your eyes." ...|$|R
6000|$|SIR PEARCE [Laughing]. You're {{welcome to}} them all, my lad. Come [he makes him sit down {{again on the}} garden seat]! sit down and enjoy <b>your</b> <b>holiday</b> [he sits {{down on one of}} the iron chairs; the one at the doorless side of the porch.] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{there are}} three more days, and I mean to enjoy them so much! And then you will write to me: and you will come at Christmas. And next year, when you have <b>your</b> <b>holiday,</b> you will come down to us again; will you not?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "MY DEAR AUGUSTUS--Your letter reached me yesterday. You seem to {{be making}} the most of your youth (as you call it) with a vengeance. Well! enjoy <b>your</b> <b>holiday.</b> I made the most of my youth when I was your age; and, {{wonderful}} to relate, I haven't forgotten it yet! ...|$|E
40|$|Most of us {{look forward}} to happy family times at the {{holidays}}, but we may also dread all the work involved. This year, why not take some time before the holidays {{to think about what}} is really important to you and <b>your</b> children? <b>Holiday</b> activities mean the most if shared, so time together is one very important ingredient of happy holidays. If you are spending all your time cooking, shopping, or cleaning, your child misses out on precious time with you. Remember that preschoolers don't need things or activities as much as they need people and relationships. One simple gift given by a parent who joins in play is better than a pile of gifts from a parent who is too busy to play. Enjoy <b>your</b> <b>holidays</b> and <b>your</b> child...|$|R
6000|$|She {{read the}} rest in his face. 'Oh!' she exclaimed, {{blushing}} brightly, 'you have not given up <b>your</b> pleasant <b>holiday</b> in Italy on my account?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am rejoiced to see {{you under}} my roof, my worthy friend," [...] taking the rough hand of the old seaman between his own whiter and more {{delicate}} fingers, and shaking it with cordiality, [...] "for this is being under my roof, while those town residences have less the air of domestication and familiarity. You will spend many of <b>your</b> <b>holidays</b> here, I trust; {{and when we get}} a few years older, we will begin to prattle about the marvels we have seen in company." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What are {{you doing}} up here at this time?" [...] he asked, coming forward. [...] "Why didn't ye take <b>your</b> <b>holiday</b> {{like the rest of}} the men?" [...] He spoke in a tone which had just {{severity}} enough in it to show that he remembered the untoward event of the forenoon, and his conviction that Henchard had been drinking.|$|E
60|$|But don't let {{the thing}} spoil <b>your</b> <b>holiday.</b> If {{we try to}} do our duty by people we employ, by {{exacting}} their proper service from them on the one hand, and treating them with all possible consistency, gentleness, and consideration on the other, we know that we do right. Their doing wrong cannot change our doing right, and that should be enough for us.|$|E
6000|$|... "Pray {{excuse me}} for {{disturbing}} you. I am obliged {{to leave the house}} on one of my tiresome domestic errands. If you will kindly permit it, I wish to express, before I go, my very sincere regret for what I was rude enough to say, when I last had the honor of seeing you. May I hope to be forgiven? How-do-you-do, Eunice? Have you enjoyed <b>your</b> <b>holiday</b> in the country?" ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{stories in}} this {{collection}} predate {{the publication of the}} book by several years. In the 1960s they were planned for publication in a book that would have been illustrated by O'Donnell's comic strip artist, Jim Holdaway who died in 1970. That edition was never produced. Holdaway's illustrations for the stories exist and have been reprinted in various magazines. The stories were originally published as newspaper inserts in Australia in 1970, in a weekly called Pix, under the series title [...] "Pay for <b>Your</b> <b>Holidays</b> Book (1-6)". The original order was: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Penfold {{says he will}} be glad to see you as soon as <b>your</b> <b>holidays</b> begin, Ralph; still I {{suppose a}} day or two will make no difference, so we will settle that you shall go on Friday. As you go down to school this {{afternoon}} you had better tell Rogerson the tailor to come up this evening to measure you for a suit of clothes. You must look decent when you go down; and you know except your Sunday suit, you have got nothing fit to wear in such a house as that." ...|$|R
