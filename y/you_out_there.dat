2500|$|While {{accepting}} {{the award for}} Best Director at the 80th Academy Awards, Joel Coen said that [...] "Ethan and I have been making stories with movie cameras since we were kids", recalling a Super 8 film they made titled [...] "Henry Kissinger: Man on the Go". [...] "Honestly," [...] he said, [...] "what we do now doesn't feel that much {{different from what we}} were doing then. We're very thankful to all of <b>you</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> for continuing to let us play in our corner of the sandbox." [...] It was {{only the second time in}} Oscar history that two individuals shared the directing honor (Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins were the first, winning for 1961's West Side Story).|$|E
2500|$|In April 2009, a {{blog post}} {{from the band}} {{expressed}} the hope that [...] "these songs will strike a chord and make a similar impact on all of <b>you</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> that were moved by this band in the first place." [...] Kinney said that the music on the album doesn't deviate {{too far from the}} band's past music, adding, [...] "It's nice to sound like yourself...It's not really that hard, actually. I know people are blown away that we really sound like ourselves, and I understand the apprehension, but it's not really that big a stretch to sound the way that you sound." [...] There are hard rock as well as acoustic songs featured on the album. In addition, Elton John appears on the album's title track.|$|E
2500|$|PlayStation Official Magazine {{gave the}} game an above-average 7 out of 10, complimenting the core {{shooting}} and production values, but criticizing its repetitive nature: [...] "A Star Wars-themed 3D shooter with some optional bounty hunting. Good fun, but it promised more." [...] IGN awarded the GameCube {{version of the}} game 8.3 out of 10, and the PS2 version 8.2. Praising the graphics, sound, length and level designs, they criticized {{the implementation of the}} bounty hunting system; [...] "The whole process is pretty clunky, and there should have been a way to streamline this to make it more fluid - especially in the heat of a battle when your mark is mixed in with four or five other opponents. It works the way it is for sure, but it certainly could have been fixed to be more intuitive than it currently is." [...] In the end, however, they found the game {{to be one of the}} better Star Wars tie-in games; [...] "Star Wars Bounty Hunter is a solid, if not technically challenged third-person action/adventure. Successfully combining our favorite aspects of the Star Wars universe with a clever stage design and a fantastic presentation, LucasArts has done a great job in suppressing the myth that games based on the Skywalker universe aren't any fun. A definite recommendation for Star Wars fans, Bounty Hunter isn't necessarily built for everyone, but for those of <b>you</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> who just can't get enough of this stuff, it's one of your better choices for this or any holiday season." ...|$|E
