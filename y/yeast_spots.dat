40|$|A {{technique}} {{has been developed}} for the direct analysis by visible spectrophotometry of <b>yeast</b> <b>spots</b> growing on agar plates. This allows rapid semi-quantitative estimations of cytochromes c, b and oxidase and permits the identification of strains with impaired respiratory electron flow. Results of screening of 105 mutants are presented. There {{appears to be a}} correlation between the exonic location of the mutation in COX 1 of oxidase and the level of optically detectable enzyme. Mutations in cytochrome b of the bc 1 complex also affect the level of expression of cytochrome oxidase and can cause either an increased or decreased level of expression of oxidase relative to the wild-type strain. Twelve strains selected by the rapid level- 1 screening were grown as lawns on sections of an agar plate and resuspended for a second level of screening. Quantitative estimates have been made of the concentrations of cytochromes, the turnover number of cytochrome oxidase and the kinetics of recombination of carbon monoxide with oxidase after flash photolysis. This confirmed the validity of the rapid screening procedure, and we have identified several strains which contain high levels of a mutant form of cytochrome oxidase with properties worthy of further investigation...|$|E
40|$|Mestrado em Engenharia Agronómica - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaSince the {{accidental}} introduction in Portugal officially in 2012 (EPPO, 2012 d), Drosophila suzukii (Matsumura) became a pest with high economic impact in small fruit crops. On IPM, monitoring and risk assessment is mandatory, therefore {{the possibility of}} using traps has enormous interest. The monitoring of this drosophila´s populations can be done with food traps. The goal of the present study is to contribute to a better knowledge about D. suzukii adult fly´s attraction to different traps (devices and baits). The work was developed in two farms, using three devices (transparent cup with or without yellow adhesive sticky trap, red cup DROSO-TRAP® from Biobest, trap made with water bottles) and four baits (vinegar, mature fruit, DROS’ATTRACT® liquid from Biobest and <b>yeast).</b> <b>Spotted</b> wing drosophila catches rose when fruits began to mature in the crop. Regarding the devices the red cup DROSO-TRAP® and the transparent cup were the most efficient devices. The yellow sticky trap did not raise the number of adults captured. Regarding the baits, the yeast mixture and the DROS'ATTRACT® captured higher number of adults than fruit and in some trap combinations also than vinegar. We captured more females than males...|$|R

While {{there are some}} contradictory data, estrogen alone {{does not appear to}} increase the risk of coronary heart disease or breast cancer, unlike the case of estrogen in combination with certain progestins such as levonorgestrel or medroxyprogesterone acetate.|$|R
40|$|With {{a global}} growing demand in food production, {{agricultural}} output must increase accordingly. An {{increased use of}} saline soils and brackish water would contribute to the required increase in world food production. Abiotic stresses, such as salinity and drought, are also major limiters of crop growth globally - most crops are relatively salt sensitive and are significantly affected when exposed to salt {{in the range of}} 50 to 200 mM NaCl. Genomic resources from plants that naturally thrive in highly saline environments have the potential to be valuable in the generation of salt tolerant crops; however, these resources have been largely unexplored. Salicornia bigelovii is a plant native to Mexico and the United States that grows in salt marshes and coastal regions. It can thrive in environments with salt concentrations higher than seawater. In contrast to most crops, S. bigelovii is able to accumulate very high concentrations (in the order of 1. 5 M) of Na+ and Cl- in its photosynthetically active succulent shoots. Part of this tolerance is likely to include the storage of Na+ in the vacuoles of the shoots, making S. bigelovii a good model for understanding mechanisms of Na+ compartmentalization in the vacuoles and a good resource for gene discovery. In this research project, phenotypic, genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic approaches have been used for the identification of candidate genes involved in salinity tolerance in S. bigelovii. The genomes and transcriptomes of three Salicornia species have been sequenced. This information has been used to support the characterization of the salt-induced transcriptome of S. bigelovii shoots and the salt-induced proteome of various organellar membrane enriched fractions from S. bigelovii shoots, which {{led to the creation of}} organellar membrane proteomes. <b>Yeast</b> <b>spot</b> assays at different salt concentrations revealed several proteins increasing or decreasing yeast salt tolerance. This work aims to create the basis for Salicornia research by providing a genome, transcriptomes, and organellar proteomes, contributing to salinity tolerance research overall. We identified a set of candidate genes for salinity tolerance with the aim of shedding some light on the mechanisms by which this plant thrives in highly saline environments...|$|R
40|$|Salvianolic acid C {{alike to}} {{other members of}} the polyphenolic family is {{composed}} of three caffeic acid units including (R) -Danshensu. Its retrosynthetic analysis presents two key fragments, a 2 -arylbenzo[b]furan core and the (R) -Danshensu side chain. These two synthons were the initial synthetic targets and the final steps were to join these fragments and deprotection. In chapter two, the synthesis of the 2 -arylbenzo[b]furan core is discussed, which overall, was made in a total of four linear steps with an overall yield of 22 %. In chapter three, an asymmetric route to a protected derivative of (R) -Danshensu was developed utilizing the Darzens condensation reaction en route to afford racemic trimethyldanshensu in 85 % yield. The racemic mixture was separated by a lipase mediated kinetic resolution to afford (R) and (S) -danshensu derivatives, with overall yields of 20 % and 14 %, respectively. Both danshensu derivatives were 10 % higher in optical purity compared to previous resolutions of this type. In chapter four, a lengthy investigation into the esterification of the two key building blocks was undertaken followed by deprotection to afford (+) -pentamethylsalvianolic acid C in 71 % yield. The demethylation of all five methyl ether groups was challenging. The only reagent compatible with the electron rich substrate that deprotected 80 % [four out of five methyl ethers] was boron tribromide. Unfortunately the low product yield did not allow for unambiguous characterization. The research outcomes provided two methylated derivatives of (+) -Salvianolic acid C: methyl (+) -pentamethylsalvianolate C and (+) -pentamethylsalvianolic acid C prepared in overall yields of 15 % and 11 %, respectively. To explore the development of novel, Danshen derived drug candidates in chapter five, a chalcone-salvianolic acid C hybrid compound was prepared with a low overall yield of 2 %. Chapter five also discusses an attempt to elaborate a new synthetic pathway to the diacid core of (+) -Salvianolic acid D. Samples of the methylated derivatives of (+) -Salvianolic acid C and the chalcone building block were sent for biological testing (chapter 6). It was found that two compounds possess antifungal activity against Candida alblicans. The same compounds were also tested as β-amyloid peptide (Aβ 42) inhibitors in a <b>yeast</b> <b>spot</b> assay. Preliminary studies indicated all three compounds improved the survival rate of the yeast cells compared to the control. These findings indicate that there is potential for these methylated derivatives of (+) -Salvianolic acid C to serve as potential drug candidates...|$|R
40|$|PRDM 9 directs human meiotic {{crossover}} {{hot spots}} to intergenic sequence motifs, whereas budding <b>yeast</b> hot <b>spots</b> overlap regions of low nucleosome density (LND) in gene promoters. To investigate hot spots in plants, which lack PRDM 9, we used coalescent analysis of genetic variation in Arabidopsis thaliana. Crossovers increased toward gene promoters and terminators, and hot spots {{were associated with}} active chromatin modifications, including H 2 A. Z, histone H 3 Lys 4 trimethylation (H 3 K 4 me 3), LND and low DNA methylation. Hot spot-enriched A-rich and CTT-repeat DNA motifs occurred upstream and downstream, respectively, of transcriptional start sites. Crossovers were asymmetric around promoters and were most frequent over CTT-repeat motifs and H 2 A. Z nucleosomes. Pollen typing, segregation and cytogenetic analysis showed decreased numbers of crossovers in the arp 6 H 2 A. Z deposition mutant at multiple scales. During meiosis, H 2 A. Z forms overlapping chromosomal foci with the DMC 1 and RAD 51 recombinases. As arp 6 {{reduced the number of}} DMC 1 or RAD 51 foci, H 2 A. Z may promote the formation or processing of meiotic DNA double-strand breaks. We propose that gene chromatin ancestrally designates hot spots within eukaryotes and PRDM 9 is a derived state within vertebrates. © 2013 Nature America, Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Amino-terminally double HA-tagged Gal 4 {{expression}} plasmid p 2 HG 4 {{was constructed}} by inserting two tandem {{copies of the}} HA-epitope-encoding fragment (sense: CATGTCTAGCTATCCTTATGACGTGCCTGACTATGCCAGCGC; antisense: CATGGCGCTGGCATAGTCAGGCACGTCATAAGGATAGCTAGA) into the NcoI site at the first codon of the Gal 4 ORF in plasmid pRJR 197 (Wu et al., 1996). HA-tagged GAL 4 DNA binding domain-Myc activation domain (2 – 128) fusion was described previously (Salghetti et al., 2000). Yeast strain JN 1 strain, containing an integrated GAL 1 -LacZ reporter, was produced by transforming strain JPY 9 (Wu et al., 1996) with Apa I-digested pRY 171 (Yocum and Johnston, 1984) and selecting for URA+ phenotype and β-galactosidase activity. The dsg 1 -deletion mutant JN 3 was constructed by replacing the DSG 1 ORF with the LEU 2 cassette; other deletion mutants and cells expressing carboxyl-terminal HA tagged proteins were constructed using the KAN cassette amplified from plasmid pYM 1 (Knop et al., 1999). For chemical-genetic inhibition of Kin 28, strain Kin 28 -as was transformed with the p 2 HG 4 plasmid that had been modified by inclusion of a LEU 2 marker (p 2 HG 4 +L). For GAL gene induction, yeast were grown in selective synthetic medium with 2 % raffinose (BIO 101) to an OD 600 of ~ 0. 5, and induced either by addition of 2 % galactose (Figures 1 and 2) or by transferring cells into fresh media containing 2 % galactose (other experiments). For plate assays, <b>yeast</b> were <b>spotted</b> onto synthetic media plates containing either 2 % glucose or 2 % galactose as the carbon source, and grown for two days at 30 °C...|$|R
40|$|A new {{screening}} technique using two-dimensional gels {{was developed}} in order to rapidly identify various elements in well-separated protein <b>spots.</b> <b>Yeast</b> mitochondrial proteins were separated using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (blue native/SDS 2 D-PAGE) and marked by silver staining. The 2 D gels were systematically analyzed by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) using a double-focusing sector field instrument. From more than 60 mitochondrial protein spots in two-dimensional gels, phosphorus, sulfur and selected metals (Cu, Zn and Fe) were detected in a short analysis time by screening 2 D gel with LA-ICP-MS using a focused laser beam. In selected protein spots a quantitative element determination was performed. Ion intensities of phosphorus and metals in single protein spots in the gels were measured at medium mass resolution using an optimized microanalytical method by LA-ICP-MS and in a solution of the gel (blank) after HNO 3 digestion by ICP-MS. For quantification purposes sulfur {{was used as the}} internal standard element. The detection limits for phosphorus, sulfur, copper, zinc and iron in protein spots, determined in the gel blank (Coomassie staining), were 0. 18 mug g(- 1), 1. 3 mg g(- 1), 6. 4 mug g(- 1), 17. 6 mug g(- 1) and 9. 5 mug g(- 1), respectively. In silver staining gel a detection limit for sulfur of 137 mg g 21 was measured. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (MALDI-FTICR-MS) was applied for structure analysis and determination of phosphorylation sites of phosphorylated proteins. Results of the structure analysis of separated mitochondrial proteins obtained by MALDI-FTICR-MS were combined with those of the direct determination of phosphorus, sulfur and metal concentrations in protein spots in two-dimensional gels with LA-ICP-MS...|$|R
