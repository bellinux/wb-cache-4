25|$|<b>Yellow</b> <b>jack</b> are a minor {{commercial}} species throughout their range, taken by seines, trawls and hook and line techniques. They are also caught by recreational fishermen, with fish baits and lures and often while trolling, {{although they are}} rarely targeted specifically. The species is rated as a fair to good table fish, and is marketed both fresh and salted. <b>Yellow</b> <b>jack</b> {{are known to be}} carriers of ciguatera around the West Indies, and are classified as a high risk species, with their predatory nature allowing the toxin to accumulate in their flesh. The <b>yellow</b> <b>jack</b> was actually the first species outside of the Pacific Ocean to be confirmed as carrying ciguatera toxins, although these early studies showed that the toxin was biochemically slightly different from the Pacific strain.|$|E
25|$|<b>Yellow</b> <b>jack</b> are predatory fish, moving both {{individually}} {{or in small}} groups, with their main prey being small fish, although observational records also show smaller benthic prey is taken. <b>Yellow</b> <b>jack</b> have been observed in a 'following role', moving around with larger species {{to take advantage of}} the commotion caused by the bigger fish, allowing the jack to opportunistically forage or take scraps left by the larger fish. As well as other teleosts, <b>yellow</b> <b>jack</b> have also been recorded following eels, stingrays and nurse sharks. In one case, they were observed following a flying gurnard, itself smaller than the jack, that disturbed the substrate, causing various organisms to be displaced and become available for predation. As well as being 'followers', larger specimens have also been observed as the 'followed' species. The species has also been observed living in close relationships with spinner dolphins, feeding off the dolphin's waste products. This behavior has also been observed in a number of other jacks living in the region.|$|E
50|$|The {{great hammerhead}} is a solitary, nomadic {{predator}} {{that tends to}} be given a wide berth by other reef sharks. If confronted, they may respond with an agonistic display: dropping their pectoral fins and swimming in a stiff or jerky fashion. Juveniles are preyed upon by larger sharks such as bull sharks (Carcharhinus leucas), while adults have no major predators except for killer whales, who hunt hammerheads of any age. <b>Yellow</b> <b>jacks</b> (Carangoides bartholomaei) have been seen rubbing themselves against the hammerhead's flanks, possibly to rid themselves of parasites. Schools of pilot fish (Naucrates ductor) sometimes accompany the great hammerhead. The great hammerhead is parasitized by several species of copepods, including Alebion carchariae, A. elegans, Nesippus orientalis, N. crypturus, Eudactylina pollex, Kroyeria gemursa, and Nemesis atlantica.|$|R

Observational studies in Belize have shown that although courtship occurs in pairs, the species is a group spawner, congregating in large balls of around 300 fish, with spawning occurring mostly before sunset. Juveniles live near {{the surface of the}} ocean, often hiding amongst large mats of jellyfish or Sargassum weed, with a coloration that camouflages the fish in the weed. These young fish are often moved long distances by the Gulf Stream, and this is probably the process responsible for fish found as far north as Massachusetts.|$|R

25|$|The <b>yellow</b> <b>jack</b> is {{classified}} within the genus Carangoides, {{a group of}} fish commonly called jacks and trevallies. Carangoides falls into the jack and horse mackerel family Carangidae, itself part the order Perciformes, in the suborder Percoidei.|$|E
25|$|The <b>yellow</b> <b>jack</b> is a pale yellow-green-blue dorsally, {{becoming}} silver on the underside. Juveniles show around 5 vertical bands, which fade to blotches {{and finally}} disappear altogether as the fish matures.

2500|$|The {{play was}} a {{moderate}} success, but times were hard. Many Broadway theaters {{had been converted}} to movie houses and the Depression was reaching bottom. [...] "From 1932 through 1934", Stewart later recalled, [...] "I'd only worked three months. Every play I got into folded." [...] By 1934, he was given more substantial stage roles, including the modest hit Page Miss Glory and his first dramatic stage role in Sidney Howard's <b>Yellow</b> <b>Jack,</b> which convinced him to continue his acting career. However, Stewart and Fonda, still roommates, were both struggling. In the fall of 1934, Fonda's success in The Farmer Takes a Wife took him to Hollywood. Finally, Stewart attracted the interest of MGM scout Bill Grady who saw Stewart on the opening night of Divided by Three, a glittering premiÃ¨re with many luminaries in attendance, including Irving Berlin, Moss Hart and Fonda, who had returned to New York for the show. With Fonda's encouragement, Stewart agreed to take a screen test, after which he {{signed a contract with}} MGM in April 1935, as a contract player for up to seven years at $350 a week.|$|E

Since the Sioux and Cheyenne were traditional enemies of the Crow and since they were crowding the Crow reservation, several Crow warriors enlisted in the U.S. army {{at the beginning of the}} Great Sioux War in 1876. On April 10, Lieutenant James H. Bradley swore 23 Crow scouts in. Each scout received a red armband to wear on the left arm above the elbow, to set him apart from hostile Indians.

50|$|In the Trimline version {{designed}} for connection to an RJ11 telephone jack, pins 2 and 5 (black and yellow) may carry very low voltage AC or DC power. While {{the phone line}} itself (tip and ring) supplies enough power for most telephones, older telephone instruments with incandescent dial lights in them (such as the classic Western Electric Princess and Trimline models) needed different voltages and more current than the phone line could supply. Typically, the power on pins 2 and 5 came from a transformer plugged into a power outlet near one telephone jack, wired to supply power to just that telephone (or {{to all of the}} jacks in the house, depending on local telephone company practices). It is now usually recommended that only the one local jack used by such older telephones be wired for power, to avoid any potential interference with other types of service that might be using pins 2 and 5 (black and <b>yellow</b> pair) in <b>jacks</b> {{in other parts of the}} house. The early Trimline and Princess phone dial light incandescent lamps were rated at 6.3 Volts, 0.25 Amp and the transformer output is approximately 6-8 Volts AC.

40|$|Growing out of {{work for}} a major {{exhibition}} at the Canadian Museum of Civilization, where Morgan Baillargeon (Metis) is Curator of Plains Ethnology and Leslie Tepper is Curator of Plateau Ethnology, Legends of Our Times centers on the Native people of the Northern Plains and Plateau. The project, say Baillargeon and Tepper, began with two goals: 2 Ì 2 to help break the stereotype of 2 Ì 7 the Indian versus the cowboy 2 Ì 7 and through remaking that image to bring to people 2 Ì 7 s attention an entire field of western history and Native culture that remains largely unknown 2 Ì 2; and 2 Ì 2 to acknowledge the contributions Native people have made to the ranching and rodeo industry. 2 Ì 2 The authors attempt to demonstrate that for Native cowboys 2 Ì 2 their traditional beliefs, practices, and especially their history impart an additional dimension to cowboy life. 2 Ì 2 Baillargeon and Tepper bring together Indian stories, histories, songs, and poetry about this world, dividing the book into three parts: 2 Ì 2 Sacred Beings, 2 Ì 2 2 Ì 2 Ranching Life, 2 Ì 2 and 2 Ì 2 Rodeo and Other Entertainment. 2 Ì 2 Each section, in turn, is comprised of an essay by the authors followed by historical and contemporary Native accounts. As one would anticipate from a volume emerging from a museum exhibition, it is blessed with a great many illustrationsabout 168 in all. Roughly half of Legends of Our Times is devoted to images-primarily photographic-that document the world of the Native cowboy and cowgirl. The volume will introduce many readers to the participation of Indians in ranching and rodeo and will make evident the shared experiences of Native peoples, whether they lived or live north or south of the 49 th parallel. One especially welcomes the attention paid to the early Native cowboys, including the compelling photographic portraits of Running Rabbit Robe, <b>Yellow</b> Horse, <b>Jack</b> Alex and Gabriel Paul, Michel Charlie and C. B. Suszen Timentwa, Buffalo Thigh, Tom Three Persons, Jackson Sundown, and Barney Old Coyote Sr. Through an array of Native artifacts and voices, Baillargeon and Tepper clarify the vital place held by ranching and rodeo in this part of North America.
