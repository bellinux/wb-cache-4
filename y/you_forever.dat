25|$|Gately's bandmates flew to Majorca on 11 October 2009; Walsh was {{expected}} to join them soon after. The remaining members of Boyzone, Keith Duffy, Michael Graham, Ronan Keating and Shane Lynch, issued a joint statement: We are completely devastated {{by the loss of}} our friend and brother, Stephen. We have shared such wonderful times together over the years and were all looking forward to sharing many more. Stephen was a beautiful person in both body and spirit. He lit up our lives and those of the many friends he had all over the world. Our love and sympathy go out to Andrew and Stephen's family. We love you and will miss <b>you</b> <b>forever,</b> 'Steo'.A post-mortem and toxicology tests took place on 13 October and this examination showed that Gately died of natural causes. He {{died as a result of}} a congenital heart defect. Toxicology also confirmed the statement by Gately's partner Cowles that he had been smoking cannabis that evening.|$|E

[...] Marceau appeared on Skelton's CBS television show three times, including one turn {{as the host}} in 1961 as Skelton recovered from surgery. He was also a guest on the three Funny Faces specials that Skelton produced for HBO. [...] In a TV Guide interview after Skelton's death, Marceau said, [...] "Red, you are eternal for me and {{the millions of people}} you made laugh and cry. [...] May God bless <b>you</b> <b>forever,</b> my great and precious companion. [...] I will never forget that silent world we created together." [...] CBS issued the following statement upon his death: [...] "Red's audience had no age limits. [...] He was the consummate family entertainer—a winsome clown, a storyteller without peer, a superb mime, a singer and a dancer." ...|$|E

500|$|Aaron Stewart-Ahn was {{selected}} to direct the video based on his previous work directing the video for Death Cab For Cutie's [...] "Stable Song", as well as work documenting the band's live performances. [...] Stewart-Ahn said that the theme of travel had been inspired by Death Cab for Cutie's earlier song [...] "Transatlanticism", {{as well as his}} own extensive experience traveling solo, adding that [...] "I’ve always felt that travel is a defining human experience that changes <b>you</b> <b>forever,</b> and hope that this depiction of wanderlust, obsessiveness, repetition, and loneliness conveys some of that.” [...] He also said [...] "The idea is that the band is performing in an incredibly cold environment while this woman is traveling around the world, moving toward progressively warmer climes. [...] The farther she gets from the song's obsessive protagonist, the more her world opens up, and the less reliable his memories of her become." ...|$|E
500|$|Taylor summoned Khánh to his office, but the Vietnamese leader sent Thi, Kỳ, Thiệu and Admiral Chung Tấn Cang, the {{commander}} of the Republic of Vietnam Navy, instead. Taylor asked the four to sit down and then said [...] "Do all of you understand English?" [...] The ambassador then angrily denounced the officers. According to Stanley Karnow, Taylor [...] "launched into a tirade, scolding them as if he were still superintendent of West Point and they a group of cadets caught cheating". He said [...] "I told you all clearly at General Westmoreland's dinner we Americans were tired of coups. Apparently I wasted my words." [...] He decried the removal of the HNC as [...] "totally illegal", and said it had [...] "destroyed the government-making process", and that [...] "I made it clear that all the military plans I know you would like to carry out are dependent on government stability", something he felt had been lost with the dismissal of the HNC. He said [...] "...you have made a real mess. We cannot carry <b>you</b> <b>forever</b> if you do things like this." [...] Taylor believed the HNC to be {{an essential part of the}} government, because as an American, he believed civilian legitimacy was a must. For him, the HNC was a necessary step in a progression towards an elected civilian legislature, which he regarded as critical for national and military morale. The historian Mark Moyar regarded Taylor's intervention as unnecessary, and noted that there had been many instances of fierce fighting in Vietnamese history despite the complete absence of democracy throughout the nation's history. Taylor also reminded them of an earlier meeting where he had discussed an American plan to expand the war, increase funding for the South Vietnamese military, and to go on the offensive against the communists at the request of Khánh. Taylor said the Americans would not be able to help Saigon pursue their desired military strategy if the political machinations did not stop. Taylor said that if the military did not transfer some powers or advisory capacity back to the HNC or another civilian institution, aid would be withheld, and some planned military operations against the Ho Chi Minh trail—which was being used to infiltrate communists into the south—would be suspended.|$|E

2500|$|P-Orridge has vociferously criticized {{contemporary}} Christianity, {{describing it}} as [...] "an incredibly sick social pseudo-religion", and {{arguing that it}} was based upon the tenet of [...] "Be good now, agree, or else we will punish <b>you</b> <b>forever</b> and ever when you're dead. And we may punish you while you're alive...". [...] P-Orridge maintains that such an attitude was established in Christianity by St. Paul and the early Roman Catholic Church, and that it differed from the [...] "ecstatic mysticism of the original Christianity, the Gnostic Christianity." ...|$|E
2500|$|Once there, Jill seduces Alan {{and the two}} undress {{and attempt}} to have sex. However, Alan breaks this off when he hears the horses making noises in the stables beneath, which he decides {{is the reason for}} his {{inability}} to get an erection. Jill tries to ask Alan what the problem is, but he shouts at her to leave. After Jill dresses and walks out of the stables, the still nude Alan begs the horses for forgiveness, as he sees the horses as God-like figures. [...] "Mine!...You're mine!...I am yours and you are mine!" [...] cries Equus through Dysart's voice, but then he becomes threatening: [...] "The Lord thy God is a jealous God," [...] Equus/Dysart seethes, [...] "He sees you, he sees <b>you</b> <b>forever</b> and ever, Alan. He sees you!...He sees you!" [...] Alan screams, [...] "God sees!" [...] and then he says [...] "No more. No more, Equus!" [...] Alan then uses a steel spike to blind the six horses in the stable, whose eyes have [...] "seen" [...] his very soul.|$|E

2500|$|Soon after arriving, Cameron, {{impressed}} by the courage of the garrison, decided {{to give them the}} opportunity to surrender. Two interpreters were sent {{to the head of the}} sap with a white flag and Major William Mair called out the offer in Māori, which was passed to Rewi, within the pa. Although there are several versions of Rewi's reply, he is reputed to have declared through his messenger, [...] "Ka whawhai tonu ahau ki a koe, ake, ake" [...] ("I shall fight <b>you</b> <b>forever,</b> and ever, and ever") When a shot was fired at Mair as he withdrew, grazing his shoulder, the British forces responded with a heavier hail of grenades, artillery and gunfire. The Ōrākau garrison repulsed two more attempts by the Waikato militia to rush the north-west outworks, but at 4:00 pm the chiefs, realising the end was near, decided to break out. Placing women and children in the middle of the group and their best warriors in front, the Māori broke through the earthworks at the south-east corner of the pa and [...] ran downhill without opposition 200 metres towards a ridge to the south, behind which the some men of the 40th were sheltering. They then dropped down a sloping 10-metre bank, surprising members of the 40th Regiment, who formed the south eastern edge of the cordon before running for cover in a nearby swamp. The group, many of them holding empty shotguns or tomahawks, was pursued by sword-bearing cavalry and hundreds of soldiers who fired on and bayoneted the fleeing Māori; Forest Rangers kept up the chase until dusk. Back at Ōrākau, meanwhile, soldiers stormed the pa as the garrison fled, bayoneting and shooting many of the wounded, including women and children. One of the women was Hine-i-turama Ngatiki.|$|E
