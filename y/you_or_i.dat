25|$|I do feel strongly, {{after my}} {{subcommittee}} has carefully and objectively reviewed this case from both sides, that injustice rather than justice has been served. The Moon case sends a strong signal that if one's views are unpopular enough, {{this country will}} find a way not to tolerate, but to convict. I don't believe that <b>you</b> <b>or</b> <b>I</b> or anyone else, no matter how innocent, could realistically prevail against the combined forces of our Justice Department and judicial branch in a case such as Reverend Moon's.|$|E

Is he insane? No, I think he's as sane as <b>you</b> <b>or</b> <b>I.</b> He just likes it." [...] Scott did say, however, [...] "In our normal terms, he's truly evil." [...] Scott also brings up the notion of absolution in reference to Lecter towards the film's end. Verger has one overriding objective in life: to capture Lecter and subject him to a slow, painful death.|$|E

500|$|The 1960s {{setting of}} X-Men: First Class, technologically {{inspired}} by the James Bond films of that era, also added to the international feel of the characters. Kinberg said the series was a major influence for the way they [...] "did a cool job representing the period, {{in a way it}} still felt muscular and action-oriented", and Vaughn added that Magneto was his attempt to recreate Sean Connery's Bond in both style and the [...] "badass, charming, ruthless and sweet" [...] personality. The director said his goal was to [...] "feel like a '60s Bond film, but {{with a little bit of}} reality it could be grounded in. I wanted there to be just a hint of this world of the mutants coming through. A mutant in this world having powers needed to be the equivalent of <b>you</b> <b>or</b> <b>I</b> sneezing, as normal as possible, at least until the humans start seeing it for the first time." [...] At the same time, Vaughn tried to do the [...] "bloody hard balancing" [...] of modern and antique to recreate the 1960s in way it was [...] "not so alien to the kids that it looked like a period piece." [...] The director also tried to depict the era still in a realistic way, particularly [...] "that 60s misogynist vibe" [...] with women in skimpy suits, and McTaggert's reliability as a CIA agent being questioned.|$|E

O’Connell recoiled before the cannon at Clontarf" [...] though adding [...] "I do not blame these men; <b>you</b> <b>or</b> <b>I</b> might have done the same.

[...] "Everything I have done, everything I've achieved, everything that I can think of that has directed and affected my life – apart from the drink – stemmed from my childhood.

2500|$|By way of {{example of}} how to clarify conceptions, he {{addressed}} conceptions about truth and the real as questions of the presuppositions of reasoning in general. In clearness's second grade (the [...] "nominal" [...] grade), he defined truth as a sign's correspondence to its object, and the real {{as the object of}} such correspondence, such that truth and the real are independent of that which <b>you</b> <b>or</b> <b>I</b> or any actual, definite community of inquirers think. After that needful but confined step, next in clearness's third grade (the pragmatic, practice-oriented grade) he defined truth as that opinion which would be reached, sooner or later but still inevitably, by research taken far enough, such that the real does depend on that ideal final opinion—a dependence to which he appeals in theoretical arguments elsewhere, for instance for the long-run validity of the rule of induction. Peirce argued that even to argue against the independence and discoverability of truth and the real is to presuppose that there is, about that very question under argument, a truth with just such independence and discoverability.|$|E
2500|$|The Gemara {{cited the}} Torah's {{requirement}} for corroborating witnesses {{to support the}} Mishnah's prohibition of circumstantial evidence in capital cases. The Mishnah reported that they admonished witnesses in capital cases not to testify based on conjecture (that is, circumstantial evidence) or hearsay, for the court would scrutinize the witnesses' evidence by cross-examination and inquiry.. The Gemara reported that the Rabbis taught that the words [...] "based on conjecture" [...] in the Mishnah meant that the judge told the witness that if the witness saw the defendant running after the victim into a ruin, and the witness pursued the defendant and found the defendant with bloody sword in hand and the victim writhing in agony, then the judge would tell the witness that the witness saw nothing (and did not actually witness a murder). It was taught in a Baraita that Rabbi Simeon ben Shetach said that he once did see a man pursuing his fellow into a ruin, and when Rabbi Simeon ben Shetach ran after the man and saw him, bloody sword in hand and the murdered man writhing, Rabbi Simeon ben Shetach exclaimed to the man, [...] "Wicked man, who slew this man?

2500|$|So I grew up (in Ottawa), in this capital city. My parents used to {{work for}} the government, and I went to {{elementary}} school, high school, and the university in the city. And there was a place on Sussex Drive (Sussex Drive is where the Prime Minister's house is, right below Parliament Hill), and there was a little club there called Le Hibou, which in French means 'the owl.' And it was run by a gentleman named Harvey Glatt, and he brought every, and I mean every blues star that <b>you</b> <b>or</b> <b>I</b> would ever have wanted to have seen through Ottawa in the late 50s, well I guess more late 60s sort of, in around the Newport jazz rediscovery. I was going to Le Hibou and hearing James Cotton, Otis Spann, Pinetop Perkins, and Muddy Waters. I actually jammed behind Muddy Waters. S. P. Leary left the drum kit one night, and Muddy said 'anybody out there play drums? I don't have a drummer.' And I walked on stage and we started, I don't know, Little Red Rooster, something. He said 'keep that beat going, you make Muddy feel good.' And I heard Howlin' Wolf (Chester Burnett). Many, many times I saw Howlin' Wolf. And of course Buddy Guy, Buddy Guy and Junior Wells, Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee. So I was exposed to all of these players, playing there as part of this scene to service the academic community in Ottawa, a very well-educated community. Had I lived in a different town I don't think that this would have happened, because it was just the confluence of educated government workers, and then also all the colleges in the area, Ottawa University, Carleton, and all the schools—these people were interested in blues culture.|$|E
