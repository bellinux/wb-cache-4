5|$|The {{history of}} Sejanus and Drusus dated back {{to at least}} AD 15. That year a mutiny had broken out among legions posted in Pannonia and Germania. While his adopted son Germanicus {{restored}} order in Germania, Tiberius' biological son Drusus was sent to quell the uprising in Pannonia, accompanied by Sejanus and two Praetorian cohorts. In part due to what the soldiers believed to be bad omens, Drusus quickly managed to restore stability in the army, and publicly put the chief instigators to death. The camp was purged of mutineers by the Praetorians and the legions returned to the winter barracks. Despite this success, the following <b>years</b> <b>witnessed</b> a growing animosity between Drusus and Sejanus.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after its}} founding, World War I {{brought about the}} {{collapse}} of the two powers occupying ethnic Ukrainian territory, Austria-Hungary and tsarist Russia, and the formation of the Ukrainian National Republic in 1918. The subsequent <b>years</b> <b>witnessed</b> a great upswing in Scouting, as it spread into the towns and communities where it had been previously unknown, mainly in the newly freed central provinces of Ukraine. Hundreds, if not thousands, of boys, inspired by the ideals of service to God and Country which Scouting engenders, volunteered to join the armed forces, fighting on several fronts, and many gave their lives.|$|E
25|$|The league's {{next two}} <b>years</b> <b>witnessed</b> W Connection, a {{relatively}} new club based in Point Lisas, begin its ascent as a dominant professional club within Trinidad and Tobago. After finishing third {{in the league and}} capturing the FA Trophy in the club's inaugural season in 1999, the Savonetta Boys would see even more success after becoming the first Pro League club to complete the league and cup double in 2000. Moreover, W Connection captured three additional trophies the following season by winning the league cup, the inaugural Pro Bowl, and repeating as league champions in a shortened season due to the country staging the FIFA U-17 World Championship in September 2001.|$|E

25|$|The Nixon <b>years</b> <b>witnessed</b> {{the first}} {{large-scale}} efforts to desegregate the nation's public schools. Particularly in the South, Nixon sought a middle way between the segregationist Wallace and liberal Democrats, whose support of integration was alienating some Southern whites. Soon after beginning his first term, Nixon appointed Vice President Agnew {{to lead a}} task force, which worked with local leaders—both white and black—to determine how to integrate local schools. Agnew {{had little interest in}} the work, and most of it was done by Labor Secretary George Shultz. Federal aid was available, and a meeting with President Nixon was a possible reward for compliant committees. By September 1970, less than ten percent of black children were attending segregated schools. By 1971, however, tensions over desegregation surfaced in Northern cities, with angry protests over the busing of children to schools outside their neighborhood to achieve racial balance. Nixon opposed busing personally but enforced court orders requiring its use.|$|E
25|$|The {{beginning}} of Njegoš' reign {{was marked by}} a revival of Montenegro's traditional alliance with Russia. The {{relationship between the two}} countries was motivated by the Montenegrins' need to have a powerful ally who could provide political and financial support to their fledgling nation and Russia's desire to exploit Montenegro's strategic location in its ongoing geopolitical battle with Austria. Traditionally, the Serbian Orthodox monastery in Cetinje and the institution of vladika had survived through the centuries because of Russian support, but Petar I's final <b>years</b> <b>witnessed</b> a cooling of Russo–Montenegrin relations. With the Radonjićes expelled, Njegoš abolished the office of guvernadur in 1832. This move did not bring him any new powers, as Russia insisted on the establishment of the Governing Senate (Praviteljstvujuščiji senat) of Montenegro and the Highlands, whose purpose was to limit and regulate the powers of the vladika. Much like the Governing Soviet (Praviteljstvujušči sovjet) in Serbia, most of the senate's members were hand-picked by the Russians because of their political leanings, which were often more favourable to Saint Petersburg than they were to Vienna. Created to replace the kuluk formed by Petar I in 1798, the senate was established by Ivan Vukotić, a Montenegrin-born diplomat in Russian service. He had been sent to Cetinje by the Russian government in 1831, alongside his nephew Matija Vučićević. The two hailed from the Turkish-controlled Zeta Plain and had lived in Russia for much of their lives. They were tasked with establishing a strong central government which could control the country's many tribes. Vukotić was quite wealthy, having inherited a large sum of money from a noble family member, and had experience as a non-commissioned officer in the Russian military.|$|E
500|$|Perhaps {{the best-known}} of Grimaldi's pantomimes was Thomas Dibdin's Harlequin and Mother Goose; or, The Golden Egg, which opened on 29 December 1806 at the Covent Garden Theatre. As in most pantomimes, {{he played a}} dual role, in this case first as [...] "Bugle", a wealthy but {{abrasive}} eccentric womaniser, and after the transformation to the harlequinade, as Clown. Mother Goose was a runaway success with its London audiences and earned an extraordinary profit of £20,000. It completed a run of 111 performances over a two-year residency, a record for any London theatre production at the time. Grimaldi, however, considered the performance {{to be one of}} the worst of his career and became depressed. Critics thought differently, attributing the pantomime's success to Grimaldi's performance. It prompted one critic from European Magazine to write: [...] "We have not for several <b>years</b> <b>witnessed</b> a Pantomime more attractive than this: whether we consider the variety and ingenuity of the mechanical devices [...] the whim, humour, and agility of the Harlequin, Clown and Pantaloon". Kemble stated that Grimaldi had [...] "proved himself [...] the great master of his art", while the actress Mrs Jordan called him [...] "a genius... yet unapproached". The production regularly played to packed audiences.|$|E

2500|$|In 1613, Rosseter {{combined}} {{his company}} with the Lady Elizabeth's Men, managed by Philip Henslowe. Performing at the Swan Theatre and Hope Theatre, Field acted in Thomas Middleton's A Chaste Maid in Cheapside and Jonson's Bartholomew Fair. For the latter play, in which he may have performed as Cokes or Littlewit, he received payment for the company after a performance at court. These <b>years</b> <b>witnessed</b> some degree of tumult; Henslowe's business practices resulted in his actors' drawing up certain [...] "articles of grievance" [...] against him, and Rosseter's attempt {{to build a new}} private theater (Porter's Hall) in Blackfriars was blocked by the city and Privy Council. This period ended when Henslowe died, Rosseter abandoned his plans, and Lady Elizabeth's Men briefly merged and then separated from Prince Charles's Men, thereafter touring in the country. For Field, the period had a presumably more satisfactory end: by late 1616, he had joined the King's Men.|$|E
2500|$|The next 5 <b>years</b> <b>witnessed</b> {{numerous}} {{cases of}} intimidation, arson, torture {{and murder of}} the Haitian population by U.S. Marines and their local enforcers, the Gendarmerie d'Haiti. The U.S. Marines were instilled with a special brand of paternalism allowing them to behave this way. Mary Renda writes that [...] "paternalism was an assertion of authority, superiority, and control expressed in the metaphor of a father's relationship with his children." [...] This mindset allowed the marines to act highly authoritatively in Haiti and carry out atrocious acts. It {{has been estimated that}} up to 15,000 Haitians lost their lives {{at the hands of the}} occupying forces, either through armed opposition or through the 'corvee' system of forced labor. This system allowed the occupying forces to take people from their homes and farms, at gunpoint if necessary, to build roads, bridges, etc. Many resisted and were killed on the spot while others died working or due to disease and malnutrition while living in squalid work camps.|$|E
6000|$|Such was to-day, in its freshness, {{the moral}} air, as we may say, that hung about our young friends; these {{had been the}} small {{accidents}} and quiet forces to which they owed the advantage we have seen them in some sort enjoying. It seemed in fact fairly to deepen for them as they stayed their course again; the splendid Square, which had so notoriously, in all the <b>years,</b> <b>witnessed</b> more of the joy of life than any equal area in Europe, furnished them, in their remoteness from earshot, with solitude and security. It was as if, being in possession, they could say what they liked; {{and it was also}} as if, in consequence of that, each had an apprehension of what the other wanted to say. It was most of all for them, moreover, as if this very quantity, seated on their lips in the bright historic air, where the only sign for their ears was the flutter of the doves, begot in the heart of each a fear. There might have been a betrayal of that in the way Densher broke the silence resting on her last words. [...] "What did you mean just now that I can do to make Mrs. Lowder believe? For myself, stupidly, if you will, I don't see, from the moment I can't lie to her, what else there is but lying." ...|$|E

6000|$|The {{interpretation}} {{of life in}} books {{and the development of}} imagination underwent changes of its own. Most of the great lights of the eighteenth century were still burning, though burning low, when Wordsworth came into the world. Pope, indeed, had been dead for six and twenty years, {{and all the rest of}} the Queen Anne men had gone. But Gray only died in 1771, and Goldsmith in 1774. Ten years later Johnson's pious and manly heart ceased to beat. Voltaire and Rousseau, those two diverse oracles of their age, both died in 1778. Hume had passed away two years before. Cowper was forty years older than Wordsworth, but Cowper's most delightful work was not produced until 1783. Crabbe, who anticipated Wordsworth's choice of themes from rural life, while treating them with a sterner realism, was virtually his contemporary, having been born in 1754, and dying in 1832. The two great names of his own date were Scott and Coleridge, the first born in 1771, and the second a year afterwards. Then a generation later came another new and illustrious group. Byron was born in 1788, Shelley in 1792, and Keats in 1795. Wordsworth was destined to see one more orb of the first purity and brilliance rise to its place in the poetic firmament. Tennyson's earliest volume of poems was published in 1830, and In Memoriam, one of his two masterpieces, in 1830. Any one who realises for how much these famous names will always stand in the history of human genius, may measure the great transition that Wordsworth's eighty <b>years</b> <b>witnessed</b> in some of men's deepest feelings about art and life and [...] "the speaking face of earth and heaven." ...|$|E
