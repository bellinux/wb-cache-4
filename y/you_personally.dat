500|$|Timberlake and Scott Storch wrote [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] with Timbaland, who {{produced}} the song. Storch found working with Timberlake easy {{because of the}} song's meaning. Reporters believed its lyrics were inspired by Timberlake's romantic relationship with American recording artist Britney Spears, which ended in 2002. Timberlake told MTV News, [...] "I'm not going to specifically say if any song is about anybody. I will say writing a couple of songs on the record helped me deal {{with a couple of}} things. To me songs are songs. They can stem from things that completely happened to <b>you</b> <b>personally</b> or they can stem from ideas that you think could happen to you." [...] In December 2011, Timberlake admitted that he had written [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] after an argument with Spears: [...] "I was on a phone call that was not the most enjoyable phone call. I walked into the studio and he [...] could tell I was visibly angry." [...] Timbaland recalled, [...] "I was like, 'Man, don't worry about it' and he was like, 'I can't believe she did that to me' and he was like, 'You were my sun, you were my earth'".|$|E
500|$|Parsons was {{relieved}} of his duties at Dahlgren [...] and officially assigned to Admiral King's Cominch staff on 1 June 1943, with a promotion {{to the rank}} of captain. On 15 June 1943 he arrived at Los Alamos as Associate Director. Parsons would be Oppenheimer's second in command. Parsons and his family moved into one of the houses on [...] "Bathtub Row" [...] that had formerly belonged to the headmaster and staff of the Los Alamos Ranch School. Bathtub row, so-called because the houses were the only ones at Los Alamos with bathtubs, was the most prestigious address at Los Alamos. Parsons became Oppenheimer's next-door neighbor, and in fact his house was slightly larger, because Parsons had two children and Oppenheimer, at this point, had only one. With two school-age children, Parsons took a keen interest {{in the construction of the}} Central School at Los Alamos, and became president of the school board. Instead of the temporary two-story structure that Groves had envisioned in the interest of economy and not misusing the project's high priorities for labor and materials, Parsons had a well-built, modern, single-story school constructed. On seeing the result, Groves said: [...] "I'll hold <b>you</b> <b>personally</b> responsible for this, Parsons." ...|$|E

2500|$|This {{variation}} can be seen, for example, in {{responses to}} the question, [...] "Are <b>you,</b> <b>personally,</b> in favour of bilingualism for all of Canada?" [...] Between 1988 and 2003, support for this statement among Francophones ranged between 79% and 91%, but among Anglophones support was never higher than 48%, and fell as low as 32% in the early 1990s. The ebb in support for bilingualism among anglophones can likely be attributed to political developments in the late 1980s and 1990s, including {{the failure of the}} Meech Lake Accord, and the 1995 referendum on Quebec independence.|$|E

2500|$|On {{his return}} to America in 1841, Pratt found the church {{membership}} in contention over several issues. Rumors and gossip were rife in Nauvoo, Illinois, and Pratt found the religious principle of plural marriage difficult to accept. He rebelled against Joseph Smith when a report by disaffected Mormon John C. Bennett accused Smith of proposing marriage to Pratt's wife, Sarah Pratt, which Smith categorically denied. Additionally, a story was circulating that Sarah Pratt had been involved with Bennett himself. Pratt was torn between believing his wife or Smith, and wrote, [...] "My sorrows are greater than I can bear!" [...] A public meeting was held where a resolution supporting Smith's character was proposed; Pratt stated that {{he was unable to}} support the resolution, to which Smith replied, [...] "Have <b>you</b> <b>personally</b> a knowledge of any immoral act in me toward the female sex, or in any other way?", to which Pratt answered no. After days of Smith and {{the other members of the}} Twelve remonstrating with Pratt, they decided that he would not yield, and thus Pratt was excommunicated on August 20, 1842. Bennett claimed that Pratt and his wife were planning to leave Nauvoo and help him [...] "expose Mormonism"; Pratt would later publish a statement in the Nauvoo Expositor to deny this claim. Pratt reconciled with Smith a few months after their falling out and requested re-baptism. Pratt was reinstated in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles on January 20, 1843. Smith and Pratt directly discussed Pratt's wife, with Smith stating to him, [...] "She lied about me: I never made the offer which she said I did." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{division}} {{landed in}} Normandy, {{near the city}} of Caen, on 13 June 1944, just a week after the D-Day landings (delayed by six days due to storms in the English Channel), and deployed west of Caen in preparation for Montgomery's upcoming offensive, Operation Epsom. O'Connor's VIII Corps, with the 11th Armoured and 43rd (Wessex) Divisions, in addition to the 15th Division, under command, was given the role of attacking between Caen and Tilly-sur-Seulles, crossing the river Odon and advance to the river Orne. MacMillan's division, with each of his brigades being supported by a Churchill tank equipped regiment of the 31st Tank Brigade, was {{to play a major role}} and his plan was for the 46th and 44th Brigades to capture the villages of Cheux on the right and Saint-Mauvieux on the left. This would allow the 227th Brigade to pass through and seize the bridges across the Odon at Gavrus and Tourmaville. However, the Normandy bocage countryside was ideal for defence, and, despite strong artillery support, the 44th and 46th Brigades encountered heavy resistance on 26 June, the first day of the operation. On the evening of the following day, the 2nd Battalion, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (of 227th Brigade), ignoring the threat to their flanks, dashed to the Tourmaville bridge, which the battalion captured intact. The battalion had created a small bridgehead, allowing elements of the 11th Armoured Division to pass through and seize Hill 112, beyond the Odon river. The battalion then captured the Gavrus bridge but immediately came under heavy attack. The [...] "Scottish Corridor", which the Argylls' bridgehead across the river Odon marked the end, and which was now 2,500 yards wide, forced O'Connor, the corps commander, to send in reinforcements to hold it. The operation, although unsuccessful in its objective of penetrating as far as the Orne, it had drawn in the Germans' armoured reserves. MacMillan's division was relieved and sent to a more peaceful area, where the division, which had sustained some 2,300 casualties, including 288 killed, began to re-equip and absorb battle casualty replacements. Despite the very heavy losses, the division was believed by MacMillan's superiors to have performed very well, with Montgomery on 3 July sending him a message stating [...] "I would like to congratulate <b>you</b> <b>personally,</b> and the 15th Division as a whole on the very fine performance put up during the past week's fighting. The Division went into battle for the first time in this war, but it fought with great gallantry and displayed a fine offensive spirit. Scotland can feel pride in the 15th (Scottish) Division and the whole Division can be proud of itself". Dempsey, the army commander, and O'Connor, MacMillan's corps commander, gave similar praise.|$|E
2500|$|Until Chamberlain's death, he and Wilhelm {{had what}} the American {{historian}} Geoffrey Field called [...] "a warm, personal bond", which was {{expressed in a}} series of [...] "....elaborate, wordy letters, full of mutual admiration and half-baked ideas". The Wilhelm-Chamberlain letters were full of [...] "the perplexing thought world of mystical and racist conservatism. They ranged far and wide in subject matter: the ennobling mission of the Germanic race, the corroding forces of Ultramontanism, materialism and the [...] "destructive poison" [...] of Judentum were favorite themes." [...] Other subjects often discussed in the Wilhelm-Chamberlain letters were the dangers posed to the Reich by the [...] "Yellow Peril", [...] "Tartarized Slavdom", and by the [...] "black hordes". In 1901, Wilhelm informed Chamberlain in a letter that: [...] "God sent your book to the German people, just as he sent <b>you</b> <b>personally</b> to me, that is my unshakably firm conviction". Wilhelm went on to praise Chamberlain as his [...] "comrade-in-arms and ally in the struggle for Teutons against Rome, Jerusalem, etc". In 1902, Wilhelm wrote another letter in which he told Chamberlain: [...] "May you save our German Volk, our Germanentum, for God has sent you as our helper!". Chamberlain in his turn advised Wilhelm to create [...] "a racially aware...centrally organised Germany with a clear sense of purpose, a Germany which would 'rule the world'". In 1903, Chamberlain wrote to Wilhelm to claim that as in the last decadent days of Rome, [...] "the civis britannicus is now become a purely political concept" [...] with no racial content being involved. Chamberlain wrote with disgust how for two shillings and a sixpence, [...] "every Basuto nigger" [...] could now carry a British passport. Chamberlain went on to predict within the next fifty years [...] "the English aristocracy will be nothing but a money oligarchy, without a shred of racial solidarity or relation to the throne". Chamberlain went on to deplore the practice of raising businessmen to the peerage in Britain, contemptuously declaring that in Britain mere [...] "brewers, ink manufacturers and ship-owners" [...] now sat in the House of Lords. Chamberlain ended his letter to the Kaiser by calling the general British public [...] "a herd which has no will and which a few newspapers and handful of politicians manipulate as they wish". Wilhelm's later concept of [...] "Juda-England", of a decaying Britain sucked dried by Jewish capitalists owed much to Chamberlain. The Dutch journalist Ian Buruma described Chamberlain's letters to the Kaiser as pushing his [...] "…Anglophobic, anti-Semitic, Germanophile ideas to the point of murderous lunacy". The liberal Berliner Zeitung newspaper complained in an editorial of the close friendship between Wilhelm II and such an outspoken racist and anti-Semite like Chamberlain, stating this was a real cause for concern for decent, caring people both inside and outside Germany.|$|E
