500|$|Waugh's {{dissipated}} lifestyle {{continued into}} his final Oxford year, 1924. A letter written that {{year to a}} Lancing friend, Dudley Carew, hints at severe emotional pressures: [...] "I have been living very intensely these last three weeks. For the last fortnight I have been nearly insane.... I may perhaps one day in a later time tell <b>you</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> {{the things that have}} happened". He did just enough work to pass his final examinations in the summer of 1924 with a third-class. However, as he had begun at Hertford in the second term of the 1921–22 academic year, Waugh had completed only eight terms' residence when he sat his finals, rather than the nine required under the university's statutes. His poor results led to the loss of his scholarship, which made it impossible for him to return to Oxford for that final term, so he left without his degree.|$|E

2500|$|The March 2, 1976 {{issue of}} the National Enquirer quoted Truitt as stating Mary Pinchot Meyer, the ex-wife of Cord Meyer, had a two-year affair with John F. Kennedy and that they smoked {{marijuana}} in a White House bedroom. According to Truitt, their first rendezvous occurred after Meyer was chauffeured to the White House in a limousine driven by a Secret Service agent where she was met by Kennedy and taken to a bedroom. He stated that Meyer and Kennedy regularly met in that manner, sometimes {{two or three times}} each week, until his assassination. Truitt said the two would [...] "usually have drinks or dinner alone or sometimes with one of the aides", and claimed that Meyer offered marijuana cigarettes to Kennedy after one such meeting on April 16, 1962. He said after they smoked three joints she commented, [...] "This isn't like cocaine. I'll get <b>you</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> that." [...] According to the Enquirer, Meyer also kept a diary of the affair. The paper quoted Tony Bradlee — Meyer's sister — as confirming the existence of the affair and the diary, stating that Bradlee found the diary in Meyer's studio after her death, then turned it over to James Jesus Angleton who subsequently burned it at CIA headquarters.|$|E
