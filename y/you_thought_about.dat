6000|$|... "Winnie," [...] {{he began}} again, {{in a voice}} of forced calmness, [...] "there is no danger whatever. I'm an ass--a dolt--that's all! The fact is, I made my father a sort of half promise that I would not ask your opinion on a certain subject until--until I found out exactly what <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> it.

"Give her my love," [...] {{interposed}} Zack. --"Giving her your love; in the belief, of course, {{that you}} are going to prove yourself worthy to send such a message," [...] continued Mr. Blyth. [...] "Let us turn, and walk back at once. The sooner I write, the easier and happier I shall be.

I don't suppose he knew he had been lying insensible for a week, but thought I had just come back from work. He whispered, 'How does it look to-day, Jim?' and after what you told me about what <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> the old course of the river, I was able to say honestly, 'I think the chances look more favourable.' He whispered, 'We shall make a fortune yet, Jim,' and then drank some soup and went off to sleep again. Tomorrow morning I will set to work again. I don't believe a bit in the dream myself, but it will make him more {{comfortable}} to know that I am at work upon it; and after all it may turn out some good." ...|$|E

50|$|As a witch, Tiffany {{possesses}} First Sight, {{the ability}} to see 'what is really there' (as opposed to second sight, which shows people what they think ought to be there).

Whilst other witches are said to have this trait as well, Tiffany also recognizes some of her thoughts as Third <b>Thoughts</b> (the <b>thoughts</b> <b>you</b> think <b>about</b> the way you think about the way you think), and Fourth <b>Thoughts</b> (the <b>thoughts</b> <b>you</b> think <b>about</b> the way you think about the way you think about the way you think). All these thoughts sometimes cause Tiffany to walk into door frames.|$|R
