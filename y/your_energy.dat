You {{have to learn to}} conserve <b>your</b> <b>energy.</b> In college, you just left it all out on the field every game. In pro ball, you do that and you'll wear out, because you play every single day.|$|E

500|$|One of the {{positions}} taken by The New-Yorker was that the unemployed of the cities should seek lives in the developing American West (in the 1830s, the West encompassed today's Midwestern states). [...] The harsh winter of 1836–1837 and the financial crisis that developed soon after made many New Yorkers homeless and destitute. [...] In his journal, Greeley urged new immigrants to buy guide books on the West, and Congress to make public lands available for purchase at cheap rates to settlers. He told his readers, [...] "Fly, scatter through the country, go to the Great West, anything rather than remain here... the West is the true destination." [...] In 1838, he advised [...] "any young man" [...] about to start in the world, [...] "Go to the West: there your capabilities are sure to be appreciated and <b>your</b> <b>energy</b> and industry rewarded." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} {{performed}} {{for the first}} time at the Bambi Awards in Germany, on November 27, 2008. For the performance Spears wore hot pants, fishnet stockings and a black top hat. The ensemble was compared to the costume Madonna wore during the first act of her Sticky & Sweet Tour (2008–09). Spears was also presented with an award for Best International Popstar by Karl Lagerfeld, who said, [...] "I admire you... not just for your art, but for <b>your</b> <b>energy.</b> [...] coming back not only as a phoenix but as a bird of paradise". The following night, Spears performed the song at Star Academy, with similar choreography and dance moves but wearing a red strapless dress. On November 30, 2008, Spears performed at The X Factor. The performance was watched by over thirteen million UK citizens, making it the most viewed episode in the show’s history. On December 2, 2008, she performed the song at Good Morning America along with a performance of [...] "Circus". On December 15, 2008, she performed at the Japanese music show Hey! Hey! Hey! Music Champ. The following day, she performed at NTV Best Artist 2008 in a black and gold bra, hot pants and a white top hat. She also sported a fake tattooed heart in her cheek.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, Yield {{continued}} {{with the more}} contemplative type of writing found on No Code. Vedder said that while [...] "in the past we got really angry and we cried out against many things in our songs", he considered that when [...] "you become an adult you have to express <b>your</b> <b>energy</b> in a different way, more calm." [...] This led to songs that while not eschewing [...] "the bad side of life", ended up [...] "facing it from a more positive point of view, {{looking for a way}} to solve it. In the past we said: what a shit, this stinks, that sucks, everything sucks... Now it's time to say: stop, let's look for a solution, let's be positive." [...] Several songs on the album were inspired by literary works, including Mikhail Bulgakov's novel The Master and Margarita ("Pilate"), Daniel Quinn's novel Ishmael ("Do the Evolution"), and the writings of Charles Bukowski ("In Hiding"). Gossard wrote the lyrics for the songs [...] "No Way" [...] and [...] "All Those Yesterdays", and Ament, making his first lyrical contributions to a Pearl Jam album, wrote the lyrics for the songs [...] "Pilate" [...] and [...] "Low Light". Ament said, [...] " [...] watch Eddie put his heart into singing lyrics that I wrote, was an experience I can't put into words." ...|$|E
2500|$|McKinsey & Company asked Mulally how he {{maintained}} his {{mental and physical}} stamina, to which he responded: [...] "Everybody always talks about how you need to manage your time. You need to manage <b>your</b> <b>energy</b> as well. You first have to ask, 'What gives me energy?' There can be lots of sources: your family, exercise, your spiritual well-being... In our house, we had a family meeting every week—the family BPR —where we reviewed what {{we needed to do}} and the support required to get us through the week. It is another kind of process step, and a really important one." ...|$|E

2500|$|The title character, Beowulf, {{is portrayed}} by Ray Winstone. Zemeckis cast Winstone after seeing his {{performance}} as the title character of the 2003 ITV serial Henry VIII. On {{the topic of the}} original poem, Winstone commented during an interview, [...] "I had the beauty of not reading the book, which I understand portrays Beowulf as a very one-dimensional kind of character; a hero and a warrior and that was it. I didn't have any of that baggage to bring with me." [...] Winstone enjoyed working with motion capture, stating that [...] "You were allowed to go, like theater, where you carry a scene on and you become engrossed within the scene. I loved the speed of it. There was no time to sit around. You actually cracked on with a scene and <b>your</b> <b>energy</b> levels were kept up. There was no time to actually sit around and lose your concentration. So, for me, I actually really, really enjoyed this experience." [...] Unlike some of his castmates, Winstone's animated counterpart bears little resemblance to the actor who was in his early 50s when he filmed the role; Winstone noted that his computer-generated counterpart resembled himself at the age of eighteen, although the filmmakers did not have a photo for reference. Winstone also played a dwarf performer, and the [...] "Golden Man"/Dragon.|$|E
2500|$|In a video titled [...] "Global Warming Unmasked: The Hidden Agenda", Voris {{claimed that}} [...] "Catholic leaders must {{recognize}} global warming {{for what it}} is. It is a government power grab via population reduction. It is a pseudoscience and hyper-sensationalism. These things {{are being used to}} promote the global warming agenda, just {{as they were in the}} early 20th century eugenics movement... In fact, global warming is the evolution, the natural evolution, of that early eugenics program." [...] Voris said, [...] "Hitler adopted the American eugenic ideals and implemented them throughout his Nazi regime. Hitler did not originate the idea of eugenics and creating a superior Aryan race. It was indeed an American concept. He saw this happening in America, and went 'Ah-ha' and grabbed it and incorporated it into his whole Nazi philosophy." [...] Voris held that governments accepting the concept of global warming might limit availability of energy, cutting off those who [...] "exceed what Washington says is your limit [...] you can either be charged an exorbitant fine or perhaps have <b>your</b> <b>energy</b> supply limited or even cut off. ...If you think the government interfering in private lives to this extent based on junk science and the hysteria surrounding it just isn't possible... think back to the tens of thousands of citizens who were sterilized against their will by the government in state after state after state. ...And remember the only thing that brought the eugenics movement to an end was the horror of the Nazi death camps. If that had not happened, sterilization would just be a normal thing. It was so revolting that finally people said, 'this whole theory is wrong.' Government leaders were quite happy to just roll along exercising power without limit over their citizens." ...|$|E
