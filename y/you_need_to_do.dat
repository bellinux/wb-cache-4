After initially being taken by ambulance to the on-circuit medical centre, he was airlifted to Maggiore Hospital shortly after, the second driver {{to be admitted}} there during the weekend.

Later in hospital, {{it was announced that}} Ratzenberger had {{died as a result of}} his multiple injuries. His death marked the first Formula One race weekend fatality since the 1982 Canadian Grand Prix when Riccardo Paletti was killed. It had been eight years since Elio de Angelis died testing a Brabham car at the Circuit Paul Ricard. Professor Sid Watkins, then head of the Formula One on-track medical team, recalled in his memoirs Ayrton Senna's reaction to the news, stating that [...] "Ayrton broke down and cried on my shoulder."

Of the 20,000 Japanese Americans {{who served in the}} Army during World War II, [...] "many Japanese-American soldiers had gone to war to fight racism at home" [...] and they were [...] "proving with their blood, their limbs, and their bodies that they were truly American". It was not only men either, some one hundred Nisei women volunteered for the WAC (Woman's Army Corps), where, after undergoing rigorous basic training, they had assignments as typists, clerks, and drivers. Satoshi Ito, an internment camp survivor, reinforces the idea of the immigrants’ children striving to demonstrate their patriotism to the United States. He notes that his mother would tell him, [...] "‘you’re here in the United States, <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> well in school, you need to prepare yourself to get a good job when you get out into the larger society’". He said she would tell him, [...] "‘don’t be a dumb farmer like me, like us’" [...] to encourage Ito to successfully assimilate into American society. As a result, he worked exceptionally hard to excel in school and later became a professor at the College of William & Mary. His story, along with the countless Japanese Americans willing to risk their lives in war, demonstrate the lengths many in their community went to prove their American patriotism.|$|E

2500|$|While {{sharing a}} flat with Barry Gibb in London in late 1967, Young was {{encouraged}} to write songs. Gibb taught him that [...] "there are no rules in song-writing, there is a structure, but what <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is find the 'hook', {{and it could be}} in the melody, the chorus, the words or even an identifiable riff, and that can be the difference in writing a hit record." [...] During 1968, back in Australia, Young wrote [...] "The Real Thing" [...] as a reaction against a Coca-Cola jingle, [...] "Coke is the real thing". Young envisaged the song as a low-key acoustic ballad (in the style of The Beatles [...] "Strawberry Fields Forever") and he originally intended it for his friend and fellow singer Ronnie Burns. Young was practising the song in a dressing room during taping of TV pop music show Uptight when pop producer and fellow Go-Set writer Ian Meldrum heard it. Meldrum (who was also manager for solo singer Russell Morris (ex-Somebody's Image) was greatly impressed by the song and immediately insisted that Young cut a demo of it for Morris. Under Meldrum's production and with the collaboration of engineer John L. Sayers the song was radically transformed into a seven-minute psychedelic epic, with a elaborately edited backing track performed by an all-star band including ex-Zoot guitarist Roger Hicks (who composed the acoustic guitar intro), members of Melbourne band The Groop and backing vocalist Maureen Elkner. Reportedly the most expensive single ever recorded in Australia up to that time, it became one of the biggest Australian pop hits of 1969, peaking at numberone in May and was numberone on Go-Set Top Records for the Year of 1969, and made Morris an immediate national star. It was later covered by Kylie Minogue and by Midnight Oil. Young's next song for Morris, [...] "The Girl That I Love", was released as a double-A-side with [...] "Part Three into Paper Walls" [...] (another epic extended production co-written by Morris and Young) which reached numberone in October.|$|E
2500|$|On the October 7, 2008 {{episode of}} Making the Band, Combs {{stated that he}} did have Richard on three demos for his new album. On the same episode of the show, after {{continued}} debate with O'Day about the well-being of Danity Kane, he stated that O'Day {{was no longer in}} the group, as had been foreshadowed in an earlier episode within the season after a TRL (Total Request Live) appearance. Combs was unaware of the specific problems within the group, but sensed that O'Day and Aundrea Fimbres, who were originally close friends, had drastically drifted apart. O'Day and Richard informed Combs that the entire group had trust issues with management and ultimately each other. The season finale, which took place Tuesday, October 14, 2008, confirmed the departure of O'Day and Woods. Combs removed Woods due to feeling that she was unhappy with the group and that she had gotten [...] "caught up in the wrath" [...] of close friend O'Day. In the live section of the episode, Combs explained that the reason he let O'Day go was that she was not the same person he signed, that the fame had changed her (as had been expressed on the August 28, 2008 episode). [...] "I got love for Aubrey," [...] he said. [...] "I don't have any beef with her. I just want to work with the young lady that I signed, not the person that fame has made her." [...] He later stated that he would be open to working with Woods again. When O'Day came on to reply, just moments after deciding not to leave the studio, she first addressed the perception some people, especially bloggers, have of her. [...] "I would rather be hated every damn day of my life for being real than loved for being something I'm not," [...] she stated. Combs, who spoke to the group and the audience via satellite, relayed to O'Day, [...] "Check this out, baby girl... See, your attitude is gonna have you in a dark and lonely place. ... What <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> {{at the end of the}} day, is humble yourself." [...] Woods did not appear on the live episode due to prior obligations.|$|E
2500|$|Outside of the WWE, he has {{received}} recognition as a Latin American and Hispanic pioneer in other promotions. In mid 1996, Morales appeared at an event of the short lived American Wrestling Federation, in the championship match between Bob Orton, Jr. and Tito Santana, along with other superstars and legends like Sgt. Slaughter, Chris Adams, and special guest referee Jim Brunzell. On August 31, 2006, {{as part of a}} Total Nonstop Action Wrestling taping, Morales was mentioned by Konnan along fellow Hall of Famers Carlos Colón, Mil Máscaras and the Guerrero family, being acknowledged as Latinos that paved the way within the wrestling industry. This was part of an in-character celebratory speech following The Latin American Xchange's coronation as NWA World Tag Team Champions. In reality, Konnan credits him with [...] " [...] a lot" [...] about the politics of wrestling and [...] "the things <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in the ring to be a success in this business" [...] during his time in WCW. From 2003 onwards, the World Wrestling Council approached Morales and offered holding an Aniversario event in his honor, but he declined the invitations for ten years. In 2013, Morales accepted being the honoree of Aniversario 40. He was the centerpiece of the International Pedro Morales Fan Club, an independent organization that ran during the 1970s and that recruited members through wrestling magazines. In 2000, The Ring Chronicle inducted Morales into its own version of the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame. Modern fan reaction has also been positive in regards to the historical significance of his accomplishments. Nate Scaccia, collaborator of Bleacher Report, considers Morales the best Intercontinental champion of all time, ranking first in the title's entry at the website's WWE Champion Series. Michael Robinson and Will Baker, amateur writers for the same site, also consider him the 31st best WWE wrestler in history and 11th greatest WWE Champion respectively. He repeated at the ninth place in a subsequent interpretation. Besides the wrestling and sports media, the mun2 network also featured Morales in an article that listed their selection for the [...] "20 of the most memorable Latino wrestlers in WWE history" [...] which was published in 2012. When compiling a list based on the [...] " [...] impact on the [...] fanbase", Raúl Álzaga of Primera Hora listed him third overall.|$|E
