500|$|For {{the role}} of Reese, various other {{suggestions}} were made for the role including rock musician Sting. Cameron chose Michael Biehn for the role. Biehn was originally skeptical about the part, feeling that the film was silly. After meeting with Cameron, Biehn stated his [...] "feelings about the project changed".

I don't know. I just know that Drake is my baby, and Wayne is my everything." [...] However, Drake said their relationship has improved, and credited the song as opening up a new dialogue, saying: [...] "I think the dialogue actually between us was already opened up, I had already solved that issue. I wrote that a while ago, and I kinda felt guilty changing it. It was a sentiment that I had when I started this album and felt like that's how it should be. The album should start one place and end in another...I haven't talked to her since it's been out. I'm not sure. I haven't spoke to her." ...|$|E

The critical consensus reads, [...] "Penultimate episode [...] "Continuum" [...] forces wrap-ups {{of too many}} open-ended arcs, though it still manages to entertain by throwing more wrenches into the mix." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club thought the episode [...] "embraced all that's wondrous and all that's awful about this season of American Horror Story, occasionally within the same scene or line of dialogue." [...] He added, [...] "This is a horribly messy piece of work that somehow gets {{to the heart of}} madness, and it's occasionally a starkly beautiful piece about survivor's guilt." [...] About the episode, Matt Fowler of IGN stated, [...] "Not that anything was overtly awful, but the pacing was such that <b>you</b> could <b>just</b> <b>never</b> get a hold on what was going on." [...] He added, [...] "I also don't want to fully penalize a show for pulling out all the stops and taking me on a completely unexpected journey." ...|$|R
