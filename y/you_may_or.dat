Essays and reviews published on the site have been reprinted or referenced {{in a number of}} books, including The Creative Writing MfA Handbook, Contemporary Fiction: The Novel Since 1990, and other books. Poet Al Rocheleau said that the site has [...] "a clearly anti-establishment take on the academic poetry scene, as well as fearless, brilliant assessments of many poets, including the famous, with which <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>or</b> may not agree." ...|$|E

6000|$|Dear Archie--I take up my pen {{to write}} to you, not as one hoping for an answer, but rather in order that (you notice the Thucydidean construction) I may tell you of an event the most {{important}} of those that have gone before. <b>You</b> <b>may</b> <b>or</b> may not have heard far-off echoes of my adventure with Uncle John, who has just come back from the diamond-mines--and looks it.

60|$|BOHUN. Now, {{listen to}} me, all of you.

No: don't interrupt me: if she doesn't marry you she will marry somebody else. That is {{the solution of the}} difficulty as to her not bearing her father's name. The other lady intends to get married.|$|E
60|$|CONJURER. [Coming {{round to}} the front of the table and sitting against it.] The answer to me. You think I'm a liar because I walked about the fields with you and said I could make stones disappear. Well, so I can. I'm a conjurer. In mere point of fact, it wasn't a lie. But if it had been a lie I should have told it just the same. I would have told twenty such lies. <b>You</b> <b>may</b> <b>or</b> may not know why.|$|E

[...] "But I hope to produce a better impression--if you can spare me a little of your time. <b>You</b> <b>may,</b> <b>or</b> may not, have heard of my separation from my husband. Anyway, it is needless to trouble you on the subject; you know Mr. Vimpany; you can guess what I have suffered, and why I have left him.

[...] "Without {{wishing to}} be in any way personal, I might {{say that there are}} statesmen in your Government, for whom you must accept a certain amount of responsibility, who have been largely {{instrumental}} in bringing this hideous danger upon the country. As a company of law-makers <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>or</b> may not be excellent people--that is, I suppose, according to one's political opinions. As a company of men competent to superintend the direction of a country at war, you must permit me to say that I consider you have done well in placing certain matters in our hands, and that you will do better still not to interfere." ...|$|E

You've no {{business}} with her; and that you knew when you took her away from St. Louis. <b>You</b> <b>may,</b> <b>or</b> you mayn't, have been fooled by some one down in Texas when you went back and married her in all that hurry. But you knew {{what you were doing}} well enough when you took her away. You won't dare to tell me that you hadn't seen Ferdinand when you two mizzled off from the College?"

60|$|There is, to be sure, one priestly ghost-story, which <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>or</b> may not know, and I tell it here, though I don't believe it, just as I {{heard it}} from the Bishop of Dunchester himself. According to this most affable and {{distinguished}} prelate, now no more, he once arrived in a large country house shortly before dinner-time; he was led to his chamber, he dressed, and went downstairs. Not knowing the plan of the house, he found {{his way into the}} library, a chamber lined with the books of many studious generations. Here the learned bishop remained for a few minutes, when the gong sounded for dinner, and a domestic, entering the apartment showed the prelate the way to the drawing-room, where the other guests were now assembled. The bishop, when the company appeared complete, and was beginning to manoeuvre towards the dining-room, addressed his host (whom we shall call Lord Birkenhead), and observed that the ecclesiastic had not yet appeared.|$|E
6000|$|... "What!" [...] {{he exclaimed}} {{in a bitter}} voice, [...] "are you like all the others? Do you scorn me also because I am of a race more ancient and honourable than those of any of your {{mushroom}} lords and kings? You know my life: say, what have I done wrong? Have I caught Christian children and crucified them to death? Have I defrauded my neighbour or oppressed the poor? Have I mocked your symbol of the Host? Have I conspired against the rulers of this land? Have I been a false friend or a cruel father? You shake your heads; {{then why do you}} stare at me as though I were a thing accursed and unclean? Have I not a right to the faith of my fathers? May I not worship God in my own fashion?" [...] And he looked at Peter, a challenge in his eyes. [...] "Sir," [...] answered Peter, [...] "without a doubt <b>you</b> <b>may,</b> <b>or</b> so it seems to me. But then, why for all these years have you appeared to worship Him in ours?" ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{was soon}} decided that Mr Whittlestaff should {{give up all}} idea of the diamond-fields, {{and in so doing}} he allowed himself to be brought back to a state of semi-courteous {{conversation}} with his happy rival. [...] "Well, yes; you may write to her, I suppose. Indeed I don't know what right I have to say that <b>you</b> <b>may,</b> <b>or</b> you mayn't. She's more yours than mine, I suppose." [...] "Turn her out! I don't know what makes you take such an idea as that in your head." [...] John Gordon had not suggested that Mr Whittlestaff would turn Mary Lawrie out,--though he had spoken of the steps he would have to take were he to find Mary left without a home. [...] "She shall have my house as her own till she can find another. As she will not be my wife, she shall be my daughter,--till she is somebody else's wife." [...] "I told you before that you may come and marry her. Indeed I can't help myself. Of course you may go on as you would with some other girl;--only I wish it were some other girl. You can go and stay with Montagu Blake, if you please. It is nothing to me. Everybody knows it now." [...] Then he did say good-bye, though he could not be persuaded to shake hands with John Gordon.|$|E

6000|$|... "You will {{naturally}} feel some curiosity about your new home," [...] she began, [...] "and I haven't {{said a word}} about it yet. How very thoughtless of me! Inside and out, dear Miss Emily, our house is just a little dull. I say our house, and why not--when the management of it is all thrown on me. We are built of stone; and we are much too long, and are not half high enough. Our situation is on the coldest side of the county, away in the west. We are close to the Cheviot hills; and if you fancy there is anything to see when you look out of window, except sheep, you will find yourself woefully mistaken. As for walks, if you go out {{on one side of the}} house <b>you</b> <b>may,</b> <b>or</b> may not, be gored by cattle. On the other side, if the darkness overtakes you, <b>you</b> <b>may,</b> <b>or</b> may not, tumble down a deserted lead mine. But the company, inside the house, makes amends for it all," [...] Mrs. Rook proceeded, enjoying the expression of dismay which was beginning to show itself on Emily's face. [...] "Plenty of excitement for you, my dear, in our small family. Sir Jervis will introduce you to plaster casts of hideous Indian idols; he will keep you writing for him, without mercy, from morning to night; and when he does let you go, old Miss Redwood will find she can't sleep, and will send for the pretty young lady-secretary to read to her. My husband I am sure you will like. He is a respectable man, and bears the highest character. Next to the idols, he's the most hideous object in the house. If you are good enough to encourage him, I don't say that he won't amuse you; he will tell you, for instance, he never in his life hated any human being as he hates his wife. By the way, I must not forget--in the interests of truth, you know--to mention one drawback that does exist in our domestic circle. One of these days we shall have our brains blown out or our throats cut. Sir Jervis's mother left him ten thousand pounds' worth of precious stones all contained in a little cabinet with drawers. He won't let the banker take care of his jewels; he won't sell them; he won't even wear one of the rings on his finger, or one of the pins at his breast. He keeps his cabinet on his dressing-room table; and he says, 'I like to gloat over my jewels, every night, before I go to bed.' Ten thousand pounds' worth of diamonds, rubies, emeralds, sapphires, and what not--at the mercy of the first robber who happens to hear of them. Oh, my dear, he would have no choice, I do assure you, but to use his pistols. We shouldn't quietly submit to be robbed. Sir Jervis inherits the spirit of his ancestors. My husband has the temper of a game cock. I myself, in defense of the property of my employers, am capable of becoming a perfect fiend. And we none of us understand the use of firearms!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Gentlemen," [...] he said, with {{a certain}} {{deliberation}} of utterance, as if he enjoyed his own coarse directness, [...] "I reckon you all {{have a sort of}} general idea what you were picked up for, or you wouldn't be here. But <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>or</b> may not know that for the present you are honest, hard-working miners,--the backbone of the State of Californy,--and that you have formed yourselves into a company called the 'Blue Jay,' and you've settled yourselves on the Bar below Heavy Tree Hill, on a deserted claim of the Marshall Brothers, not half a mile from where the big strike was made five years ago. That's what you ARE, gentlemen; that's what you'll continue TO BE until the job's finished; and," [...] he added, with a sudden dominance that they all felt, [...] "the man who forgets it will have to reckon with me. Now," [...] he continued, resuming his former ironical manner, [...] "now, what are the cold facts of the case? The Marshalls worked this claim ever since '49, and never got anything out of it; then they dropped off or died out, leaving only one brother, Tom Marshall, to work what was left of it. Well, a few days ago HE found indications of a big lead in the rock, and instead of rushin' out and yellin' like an honest man, and callin' in the boys to drink, he sneaks off to 'Frisco, and goes to the bank to get 'em to take a hand in it. Well, you know, when Jim Stacy takes a hand in anything, IT'S BOTH HANDS, and the bank wouldn't see it until he promised to guarantee possession of the whole abandoned claim,--'dips, spurs, and angles,'--and let them work the whole thing, which the d----d fool DID, and the bank agreed to send an expert down there to-morrow to report. But while he was away some one on our side, who was an expert also, got wind of it, and made an examination all by himself, and found it was a vein sure enough and a big thing, and some one else on our side found out, too, all that Marshall had promised the bank and what the bank had promised him. Now, gentlemen, when the bank sends down that expert to-morrow I expect that he will find YOU IN POSSESSION of every part of the deserted claim except the spot where Tom is still working." ...|$|E
