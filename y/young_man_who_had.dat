5|$|Her first magical mentor was the Irish occultist and Freemason Theodore Moriarty. She had befriended {{him while}} still {{involved}} in psychotherapy, believing {{that he could}} help one of her patients, a <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> been fighting on the Western Front and claimed to be plagued by unexplained physical phenomena. Moriarty performed an exorcism, claiming {{that the young man}} was the victim of the soul of a deceased East European soldier which had latched onto him as a parasite. Fortune became an acolyte of Moriarty's Masonic-influenced lodge, which was based in Hammersmith, and joined his community of followers living at Gwen Stafford-Allen's home in Bishop's Stortford. Moriarty spent much time talking about the lost city of Atlantis, a topic that would also come to be embraced by Fortune. Fortune later fictionalised Moriarty as the character Dr. Taverner, who appeared in a number of short stories first published in 1922, later assembled in a collected volume as The Secrets of Dr. Taverner in 1926. Like Moriarty, Dr. Taverner was portrayed as carrying out exorcisms to protect humans from the attacks of etheric vampires.|$|E
5|$|Honório Hermeto {{departed}} for Montevideo, {{the capital of}} Uruguay, on 23 October. He chose José Maria da Silva Paranhos (later Viscount of Rio Branco) to assist him. Paranhos was a brilliant <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> once been a Liberal Party member and protégé of the disgraced Aureliano Coutinho. This surprising choice was a clear signal from Honório Hermeto to {{his colleagues in the}} cabinet of his independence. On 21 November, Honório Hermeto signed a treaty of alliance with Uruguay and the rebel Argentine provinces of Entre Ríos and Corrientes. On 3 February 1852, the allies defeated Rosas, who fled to the United Kingdom. As a reward for his role, the Emperor granted Honório Hermeto the title of Visconde de Paraná (Viscount of Paraná) in July 1852. The title was derived from the Paraná River, a tributary of the Río de la Plata, upon which free passage rights for Brazilian shipping was secured after Rosas' downfall.|$|E

25|$|Alvarado {{agreed to}} allow the festival on the {{condition}} {{that there would be no}} human sacrifice but the Toxcatl festival had featured human sacrifice as the main part of its climactic rituals.

In 2001 the novel Le Voyage en France was awarded the Prix Médicis (Medicis award).

25|$|In {{the early}} 1900s {{researchers}} {{began to notice}} {{a large number of}} early deaths and lung problems in asbestos-mining towns. The first such study was conducted by Dr. H. Montague Murray at the Charing Cross Hospital, London, in 1900, in which a postmortem investigation of a <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> died from pulmonary fibrosis after having worked for 14 years in an asbestos textile factory, discovered asbestos traces in the victim's lungs. Adelaide Anderson, the Inspector of Factories in Britain, included asbestos in a list of harmful industrial substances in 1902. Similar investigations were conducted in France and Italy, in 1906 and 1908, respectively.|$|E

40|$|Traditional {{sampling}} methods are unsuitable {{for determining the}} levels of human immunodeficiency virus type I infection and related behavioral risk factors among <b>young</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men.</b> Most surveys of this hard-to-reach population have used nonprobability samples of <b>young</b> <b>men</b> in clinical or public settings. While these studies have revealed high rates of HIV infection and risk behaviors, their findings are not generalizable to broader populations of <b>young</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men.</b> To better understand the epidemiology of HIV within this population, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in collaboration with state and local health departments, has developed a venue-based probability survey of <b>young</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men.</b> Conducted in seven metropolitan areas in the United States, the Young Men's Survey combines outreach techniques with standard methods of sample surveys to enumerate, sample, and estimate prevalence outcomes of a population of <b>young</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> frequent public venues and <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with other <b>men.</b> Venues where <b>young</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men</b> are sampled include dance clubs, bars, and street locations. At sampled venues, <b>young</b> <b>men</b> are enumerated, consecutively approached, and offered enrollment if they are determined eligible. <b>Young</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> agree {{to participate in the}} Young Men's Survey are interviewed, counseled, and tested for human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B, and syphilis in vans parked near sampled venues. The Young Men's Survey provides data on the locations and times at which demographic and behavioral subgroups of <b>young</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men</b> may be targeted for prevention activities. Behaviors and psychosocial factors associated with human immunodeficiency virus infection can be used to design culturally relevant and age-specific prevention activities for <b>young</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men...</b>|$|R
25|$|From 1932 to 1935, White {{lived in}} England, {{studying}} French and German literature at King's College, Cambridge University. His homosexuality took {{a toll on}} his first term academic performance, {{in part because he}} developed a romantic attraction to a <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> come to King's College to become an Anglican priest. White dared not speak of his feelings for fear of losing the friendship and, like many other gay men of that period, he feared that his sexuality would doom him to a lonely life. Then, one night, the student priest, after an awkward liaison with two women, admitted to White that women meant nothing to him sexually. That became White's first love affair.|$|E
25|$|Bournonville {{must have}} had the folk songs Elveskud (The Elf-shot) and Elvehøj (The Elves' Hill) {{in mind when he}} has Junker Ove linger at the hill after lunch with Miss Birthe, his fiancée, only to dream of another - a {{beautiful}} and gentle Hilda, the counter-image of Birthe. It is always at this point - the moment of doubt before a wedding - that the elves appear. For the young man in the folksong Elveskud, the encounter proves fatal. He refuses to dance with the elf girl and her punishment is so harsh that he dies. He is laid in his grave on his wedding day, followed by his fiancée and his mother. In Elvehøj, which is of a later date than Elveskud, it is God who has human fate in his hands. He lets the cock crow at dawn and the <b>young</b> <b>man,</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> slept by the hill, wakes from his spell (which turns out to have been a dream) and he counts himself lucky. The manager of the Royal Theatre, J.L. Heiberg - who Bournonville fell out with on numerous occasions during this period because he thought that Heiberg was trying to drive the ballet off the stage - had experienced great success with his Elvehøj, which in Biedermeier style, lets the elves' dance dissolve into dream and delusion.|$|E
500|$|Representative Lee {{and other}} members of the Congressional Black Caucus called upon {{outgoing}} Louisiana Governor Blanco to pardon the Jena Six on December 19, 2007, stating that [...] "we believe Mychal Bell and the Jena 6 have paid a sufficient debt to society for any transgressions they may have committed." [...] Blanco's office responded that she cannot grant pardons without a recommendation from the state Pardon Board, and no meeting of that body was scheduled during her remaining term of office. Walters commented that Representative Lee's [...] "passion for racial equality is admirable, but her grasp of the facts is not." [...] He indicated that the attack on Barker was not just a schoolyard fight [...] "but rather an unprovoked, unforeseen assault on a <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> nothing to do with the hanging of the nooses." [...] Governor Blanco's term of office ended without any pardons being granted.|$|E

500|$|The {{first report}} of {{subcutaneous}} emphysema resulting from {{air in the}} mediastinum was made in 1850 in a patient who had been coughing violently. [...] In 1900, the first recorded case of spontaneous subcutaneous emphysema was reported in a bugler for the Royal Marines who had had a tooth extracted: playing the instrument had forced air through the hole where the tooth had been and into the tissues of his face. [...] Since then, another case of spontaneous subcutaneous emphysema was reported in a submariner for the US Navy who had had a root canal in the past; the increased pressure in the submarine forced air through it and into his face. In recent years a case was reported at the University Hospital of Wales of a <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> been coughing violently causing a rupture in the esophagus resulting in SE. [...] The cause of spontaneous subcutaneous emphysema was clarified between 1939 and 1944 by Macklin, contributing to the current understanding of the pathophysiology of the condition.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} morning hours—between 2:00 am and 3:30 am—on August 28, 1955, Bryant, Milam, and Bryant's wife drove to Mose Wright's house. Milam was armed with a pistol and a flashlight. He asked Wright if he had three boys in the house from Chicago. Till was sharing a bed with another cousin; there were eight people in the small two-bedroom cabin. Milam asked Wright {{to take them to}} [...] "the nigger who did the talking." [...] Till's {{great-aunt}} offered the men money, but Milam refused as he rushed Emmet to put on his clothes. Moses Wright informed the men that Till was from up north and didn't know any better. Milam reportedly then asked, [...] "How old are you preacher?" [...] to which Wright responded [...] "64." [...] Milam threatened that if Wright told anybody he wouldn't live to see 65. The men marched Till out to the truck and asked Carolyn Bryant whether this was the <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> accosted her. She said that he was.|$|E
500|$|USA Today {{described}} Boone as [...] "a callow <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> been toughened by island challenges." [...] Variety {{called him}} [...] "hot-headed", while Entertainment Weekly wrote he was [...] "even-tempered". Boone's quick decisions {{with good intentions}} are often rash. [...] On his sixth day on the island, Joanna Miller drowns. As soon as he finds out she is drowning, he immediately tries to save her, although he does not succeed and almost becomes a casualty himself. While trying {{to take on a}} leadership role, Boone steals the camp's water; however, his plan backfires and the survivors turn on him. [...] When Boone suspects Sawyer has Shannon's medicine, he attempts to steal it. Aside from Shannon, he was closest to John Locke, who acted as a father figure and mentor to the younger, inexperienced Boone and who, unlike others including Shannon, tried to help him do his part on the island. Boone similarly {{is one of the few}} to trust Locke's guidance and made Locke feel like the hero he had always wanted to be. Boone reflects aspects of Locke's personality, such as his desire to have a unique purpose and his willingness to believe in the unlikely.|$|E
