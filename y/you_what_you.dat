500|$|... "What You Want" [...] {{opens with}} rapid drums and soon moves into a guitar-driven mode, {{accompanied}} by synthesizers. Throughout the song, Lee uses [...] "pseudo operatic" [...] and [...] "poppy" [...] vocals. In the opening lines, she sings: [...] "Do what <b>you,</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> want / If {{you have a}} dream for better / Do what <b>you,</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> want / 'Til you don't want it anymore." [...] Those sounds are followed by a hard rock surging guitar and strings which were noted {{to be part of}} the band's characteristic sound. The chorus is instrumentally complete with crashing cymbals, [...] "thrashing, high-wired rawk" [...] guitars, electric guitars, keyboards and piano as Lee sings, [...] "Hello, hello, remember me? I’m everything you can’t control / Somewhere beyond the pain there must be a way to believe we can break through." [...] At the end of the song, Lee shouts the hook [...] "Do what <b>you,</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> want," [...] as her vocals are echoed and eventually fade away. Laurie Tuffrey of NME summarized the song as a [...] "standard goth-pop fare, full of rapid drum breaks, swathes of fuzzy riffing and a catchy, chant-friendly chorus." [...] Overally, Scott Shetler of Pop Crush described its production as [...] "polished".|$|E

500|$|Aguilera further commented {{about the}} event with USA Today, [...] "When you're {{part of a}} pop phenomenon, {{you have so many}} {{opinions}} shoved down your throat. People try to tell <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> should do, how you should act, what you should wear, who you should be with. At the time things started happening for me, it was popular to be the squeaky-clean, cookie-cutter pop singer. But that role didn't speak to me, because it's so boring and superficial".|$|E

500|$|Lee shares writing credits {{with other}} members of the band on 11 of the standard-edition album's 12 songs. Evenescence first track and lead single, [...] "What You Want", was {{described}} as one of the band's most unusual songs with heavy guitar melodies, loud drums and a freedom theme. Opening with drums and a synchronized synthesizer, Lee sings [...] "Do what <b>you,</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> want / If you have a dream for better / Do what <b>you,</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> want / 'Til you don't want it anymore" [...] before the song's rhythmic, guitar-driven beat. Lyrically, the song explores a relationship which is not working out, despite present love. [...] "Made of Stone", one of the album's oldest songs, has heavy-metal influences. [...] "The Change" [...] (originally entitled [...] "Purple"), which begins gently and grows more insistent, has been compared to [...] "Digital Bath" [...] by the American alternative metal band Deftones. The fourth track (and second single), [...] "My Heart Is Broken", is a ballad written for harp and recorded with a piano. It begins with the piano and Lee's vocals, evolving into rhythmic guitars and strings. In the chorus Lee sings, [...] "I will never find a way to heal my soul/ And I will wander 'til the end of time/ Torn away from you/ My heart is broken".|$|E
500|$|In 2013, Tony Benn reiterated his {{previous}} opposition to European integration. Speaking to the Oxford Union on the alleged overshadowing of the EU debate by [...] "UKIP and Tory backbenchers", he said:I took {{the view that}} having fought [...] that we should now work with them, and co-operate, {{and that was my}} first thought about it. Then how I saw how the European Union was developing, it was very obvious that what they had in mind was not democratic. ... And the way that Europe has developed is that the bankers and the multinational corporations have got very powerful positions, and if you come in on their terms, they will tell <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> can and cannot do. And that is unacceptable. My view about the European Union has always been not that I am hostile to foreigners, but that I am in favour of democracy ... I think they're building an empire there, they want us {{to be a part of}} their empire and I don't want that.|$|E
500|$|... "Till the World Ends" [...] is an uptempo dance-pop and electropop song, with an electro {{beat and}} {{elements}} of trance and Eurodance. The song opens with sirens and a [...] "sizzling" [...] bassline. Spears delivers confident and breathy vocals, in lyrics such as [...] "If {{you want this}} good shit / Sicker than the remix / Baby let me blow your mind tonight." [...] In the chorus, the song slows down while Spears sings [...] "I can't take it take it take no more / Never felt like felt like this before / Come on get me get me on the floor / DJ what <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> waiting for?". The melody's 4:3 cross-rhythm continues into a chant-like segment, in which [...] "whoa-oh-oh-oh" [...] is repeated. The bit was compared by Scott Shettler of AOL to the [...] "rapid word repetition" [...] of Kesha. Keith Caulfield of Billboard said the chorus [...] "comes on hard like it's the sexy spawn" [...] of American recording artist Usher's [...] "OMG" [...] (2010) and Italian band Baltimora's [...] "Tarzan Boy" [...] (1985).|$|E

2500|$|Ólafur's {{musical and}} sound {{contributions}} to Broadchurch series {{two have been}} highly praised. Show creator Chris Chibnall called Ólafur's soundtrack [...] "a narrative all its own". Susanna Lazarus at Radio Times described the soundtrack as full of [...] "ethereal vocals and haunting music". Alison Graham of Radio Times also had high praise for the soundtrack, saying, [...] "The terrific music is important in building Broadchurch chilly atmosphere and dark mood. Like the best music, it's unobtrusive and doesn't tell <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> should be feeling."

2500|$|Although {{early media}} reports {{attributed}} the shootings to {{a desire for}} revenge {{on the part of}} Harris and Klebold for bullying that they received, subsequent psychological analysis indicated Harris and Klebold harbored serious psychological problems. According to Dave Cullen, Harris, who conceived the attacks, was a [...] "cold-blooded, predatory psychopath" [...] and an intelligent, charming liar with [...] "a preposterously grand superiority complex, a revulsion for authority and an excruciating need for control". In Cullen's assessment, Harris lacked remorse or empathy for others, and sought to punish them for their perceived inferiority.

There, visiting chefs from [...] "around the world" [...] would compete against his Gourmet Academy, led by his three (later four) Iron Chefs. Chairman Kaga himself is a showpiece, dressed in outlandish examples of men's formal attire.

2500|$|At the 2012 Brit Awards, Mark Foster {{said that}} Foster the People's second album would be {{released}} in 2013. In June 2013, the band played at the Firefly Music Festival—as well as at a secret show at The Troubadour in Los Angeles, performing four new songs: [...] "A Beginner's Guide To Destroying The Moon", [...] "Pseudologia Fantastica", [...] "Fire Escape", and [...] "Coming of Age". Their second album {{was supposed to be}} released in November 2013, but Columbia decided to delay the release until January 2014 because they [...] "didn't want them to be stumbling a hurtle too intense like that fourth-quarter competition. The record's so beautiful, we didn't want to take a gamble of potentially losing it in the rush." [...] Foster told Rolling Stone, [...] "This record still has the joy that our first album did, but it's been thrown into a pit and forced to dance among wolves." [...] Foster said that the new album, which is [...] "more organic and more human", {{would be released}} in early 2014. He hinted at a few new tracks, including [...] "A Beginner's Guide to Destroying the Moon" [...] and [...] "Are <b>You</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Wanna Be?", and stated that the first single should be on radio by January. Foster also told Rolling Stone that, [...] "In the first record, I was looking at my vision for the project through a piece of opaque glass," [...] and that the next album will be [...] "a clearer picture of what I've had in my head when it comes to that vision." ...|$|E
2500|$|Second, Searle {{believes}} we can rationally {{do things}} that don't result from our own desires. It is widely believed that one cannot derive an [...] "ought" [...] from an [...] "is", i.e. that facts about how the world is can never tell <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> should do ('Hume's Law'). By contrast, {{in so far as}} a fact is understood as relating to an institution (marriage, promises, commitments, etc.), which is to be understood as a system of constitutive rules, then what one should do can be understood as following from the institutional fact of what one has done; institutional fact, then, can be understood as opposed to the [...] "brute facts" [...] related to Hume's Law. For example, Searle believes the fact that you promised to do something means you should do it, because by making the promise you are participating in the constitutive rules that arrange the system of promise making itself, and therefore understand a [...] "shouldness" [...] as implicit in the mere factual action of promising. Furthermore, he believes that this provides a desire-independent reason for an action—if you order a drink at a bar, you should pay for it even if you have no desire to. This argument, which he first made in his paper, [...] "How to Derive 'Ought' from 'Is'" [...] (1964), remains highly controversial, but even three decades later Searle continued to defend his view that [...] "..the traditional metaphysical distinction between fact and value cannot be captured by the linguistic distinction between 'evaluative' and 'descriptive' because all such speech act notions are already normative." ...|$|E
