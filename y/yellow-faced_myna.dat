2500|$|The Tropical Realm is {{also the}} centre of the reptile collection. The {{crocodile}} pools (which formerly housed West African dwarf crocodiles, American alligators and Philippine crocodiles) currently house spectacled caimans in one and white-winged wood ducks and a <b>yellow-Faced</b> <b>myna</b> in the other. Near the entrance is an enclosure for tuataras. This lizard-like species from New Zealand is the last surviving sphenodont, a prehistoric group of reptiles, and Chester is the only British zoo to exhibit them. In February 2016, a tuatara hatched for the first time outside of New Zealand, leading Chester Zoo to be the only zoo to have bred them anywhere else. There were many varieties of snakes and lizards in the past (many had to depart as a result) emerald tree boas and Moellendorf's Ratsnakes now being the only remaining. The lizard collection is now made up of Serrated Casquehead Iguanas, Graham's Anoles, Jamaican Anoles, caiman lizards, and a Parson's chameleon.|$|E

50|$|The long-tailed myna (Mino kreffti) is {{a member}} of the {{starling}} family. It is resident in the Bismarck Archipelago and northern Solomon Islands. It resembles the <b>yellow-faced</b> <b>myna,</b> and the two were formerly considered conspecific.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>yellow-faced</b> <b>myna</b> (Mino dumontii) is {{a species}} of {{starling}} in the family Sturnidae. It is found in New Guinea and nearby smaller islands, where its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests. The long-tailed myna was formerly included as a subspecies. One of the largest species of starling, this species attains 23 to 26 cm in length and weighs around 217 g. [...] They have dark plumage with a metallic lustre and bright orange facial markings and beak. These birds are social and omnivorous. Their diet consists of fruit and insects for which they forage high in the canopy. They are common birds with a wide range, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed their conservation status as being of [...] "least concern".|$|E
50|$|The <b>yellow-faced</b> <b>myna</b> {{grows to}} {{a length of}} between 23 and 26 cm {{and is one of}} the largest species of starling. The head has short black {{feathers}} glossed bluish-purple on the forehead and at the base of the upper mandible, but most of the head is bare yellowish-orange skin. This forms a wide patch around and behind the eye and includes a bib on the chin and the sides of the throat. The neck, central throat and mantle are black glossed with purple while the back, wings, breast and belly are black glossed with green. The rump is white, the lower belly is golden-yellow and the undertail-coverts are white. The short, squarish tail is black. The iris is usually yellow, but in some parts of New Guinea may be brown. The bill and legs are yellow.|$|E
50|$|Going on {{standard}} measurements and length, this very large myna {{is one of}} the largest member of the diverse family Sturnidae, behind only perhaps the Nias hill myna. It measures 29 - 32 cm in length. Among standard measurements, the wing chord is 15.4 to 16.8 cm, the tail is 11.2 to 12.1 cm, the culmen is 2.9 to 3.3 cm and the tarsus is 3.8 to 4.3 cm. No known weights have been reported. These measurements are just slightly larger on average than the closely related <b>yellow-faced</b> <b>myna</b> and indicate the species is around three times as massive as the common starling. The long-tailed myna mainly has purple-glossed black plumage. It has bright orange-yellow patches of naked skin around each eye. It has a yellow lower belly and white wing patches, which are obvious in flight. The rump and undertail are white and the strong bill is bright yellow.|$|E
