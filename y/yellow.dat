5|$|In rivercane basketweaving among Southeastern Woodlands {{tribes in}} the Americas, {{butternut}} (Juglans cinerea) and <b>yellow</b> root (Xanthorhiza simplicissima) provide a rich <b>yellow</b> color. Chitimacha basket weavers have a complex formula for <b>yellow</b> that employs a dock plant (most likely Rumex crispus) for <b>yellow.</b> Navajo artists create <b>yellow</b> dyes from small snake-weed, brown onion skins, and rubber plant (Parthenium incanum). Rabbitbush (Chrysothamnus) and rose hips produce pale, yellow-cream colored dyes.|$|E

5|$|As {{its name}} suggests, Green Lantern is themed for the DC Comics {{character}} of the same name. The theme was chosen {{to coincide with the}} Green Lantern film scheduled for release in 2011. The track is painted green, {{with the exception of the}} <b>yellow</b> vertical loop. The second corkscrew was originally the track section which was going to be <b>yellow,</b> but it was decided to switch the scheme to the first loop. The loop is <b>yellow</b> because Green Lantern's enemy is the <b>yellow</b> Parallax. In June 2011, a Parallax cutout with clutching arms through which the train passes was placed at the bottom of the first drop. The ride's queue area features a series of comic-book-style boards relating the story of Hal Jordan (the Green Lantern) and the Green Lantern Corps.|$|E

5|$|Boletus roseolateritius, {{known from}} Mississippi, has a cap that changes color {{according}} to its age: it is initially dark reddish to orangish, later reddish brown at maturity, fading to brownish orange or brownish pink with dull <b>yellow</b> tints, and finally turning dull dingy <b>yellow</b> in age. Its pale <b>yellow</b> stipe lacks the reddish coloration and the hairs found {{on the base of}} B.subluridellus. Microscopically, it has smaller spores, measuring 8.5–12 by 3.5–4.5μm. Boletus rufocinnamomeus is also similar in appearance, but can be distinguished by its <b>yellow</b> stipe that is dotted with orange-cinnamon to brownish dots. Boletus flammans, another blue-bruising lookalike found in the southeastern United States, grows under conifers. It has a reddish stipe with fine reticulations on its upper half.|$|E

Smith stated he did not ask for clarification of the rule because of his low-profile status. NASCAR president Mike Helton stated that race officials had correctly awarded the penalty to Smith, and clarified that no driver would be allowed to advance their position by going below the <b>yellow</b> line at any time during a race.
