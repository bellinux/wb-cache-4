40|$|Market {{policies}} have profound implications for consumers {{as well as}} for the management of resources. One of the major concerns in fish trading is species mislabelling: the commercial name used does not correspond to the product, most often because the product is in fact a cheaper or a more easily available species. Substitution rates depend heavily on species, some often being sold mislabelled while others rarely or never mislabelled. Rates also vary largely depending on countries. In this study, we analyse the first market-wide dataset collected for France, the largest sea food market in Europe, for fish species substitution. We sequenced and analysed 371 samples bearing 55 commercial species names, collected in fishmonger shops, supermarkets and restaurants; the largest dataset assembled to date in an European country. Sampling included fish fillets, both fresh and frozen, and prepared meals. We found a total of 14 cases of mislabelling in five species: bluefin tuna, cod, <b>yellowfin</b> tuna, <b>sole</b> and seabream, setting the overall substitution rate at 3. 7 % CI [2. 2 - 6. 4], one of the lowest observed for comparable surveys with large sampling. We detected no case of species mislabelling among the frozen fillets or in industrially prepared meals, and all the substitutions were observed in products sold in fishmongers shops or restaurants. The rate of mislabelling does not differ between species, except for bluefin tuna. Despite a very small sample size (n = 6), the rate observed for this species (83. 3 % CI [36 - 99]) stands in sharp contrast with the low substitution rate observed for the other substituted species. In agreement with studies from other countries, this work shows that fish mislabelling can vary greatly within a country depending on the species. It further suggests that more efforts should be directed to the control of high value species like bluefin tuna...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION The <b>yellowfin</b> <b>sole</b> (Limanda aspera) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{abundant}} flatfish species in the eastern Bering Sea (EBS) and is the target of the largest flatfish fishery in the United States. The resource inhabits the EBS shelf and is considered one stock. Abundance in the Aleutian Islands region is negligible. <b>Yellowfin</b> <b>sole</b> are distributed in North American waters from off British Columbia, Canada, (approx. lat. 49 N) to the Chukchi Sea (about lat. 70 N) and south along the Asian coast to about lat. 35 N off the South Korean coast in the Sea of Japan. Adults exhibit a benthic lifestyle and occupy separate winter, spawning and summertime feeding distributions on the eastern Bering Sea shelf. From over-winter grounds near the shelf margins, adults begin a migration onto the inner shelf in April or early May each year for spawning and feeding.

40|$|<b>Yellowfin</b> <b>sole,</b> Pleuronectes asper, is {{the second}} most {{abundant}} flatfish in the North Pacific Ocean and is most highly concentrated in the eastern Bering Sea. It has been a target species in the eastern Bering Sea since the mid- 1950 's, initially by foreign distant-water fisheries but more recently by U. S. fisheries. Annual commercial catches since 1959 have ranged from 42, 000 to 554, 000 metric tons (t). <b>Yellowfin</b> <b>sole</b> is a relatively small flatfish averaging about 26 cm in length and 200 g in weight in commercial catches. It is distributed from nearshore waters to depths of about 100 m in the eastern Bering Sea in summer, but moves to deeper water in winter to escape sea ice. <b>Yellowfin</b> <b>sole</b> is a benthopelagic feeder. It is a longlived species (> 20 years) with a correspondingly low natural mortality rate estimated at 0. 12. After being overexploited {{during the early years of}} the fishery and suffering a substantial decline in stock abundance, the resource has recovered and is currently in excellent condition.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} implication of combining economic and ecological models {{in an effort to}} expand our knowledge of the complex problems associated with resource management. The motivation for this research arises from the perceived need to develop {{a better understanding of how}} the flow dynamics within a resource affect the efficient management of that resource. Following the introduction, the second chapter experimentally tests the theoretical models of agent behavior in patchy resource environments under both sole-ownership and competitive extraction regimes. In each setting experimental results indicate that subjects over-allocate vessels to regions that possess the greatest rates of emigration within the bioeconomic system relative to the theoretical predictions. This introduces a "spatial externality" because over-harvesting in one region reduces the harvest in the surrounding regions. The third chapter proposes a potential solution to the problems associated with a spatial externality by analyzing the use of marine reserves in the presence of a heterogeneously distributed resource. This is conducted by introducing the presence of biological "hot spots" (areas within a fishery that possess a larger growth potential than the surrounding areas) with spatial rates of migration into the current economic theory. Simulation results indicate that the presence of biological hot spots within a fishery creates an environment within which it is optimal to establish a marine reserve that increases the value of the fishery. The fourth chapter makes use of my earlier experimental and simulation research, which indicate that locational choice and the spatial distribution of effort should affect the management of the fishery. Within this chapter a spatial Heckit model is developed to empirically investigate for the presence of herding behavior among <b>yellowfin</b> <b>sole</b> and Pacific cod fishermen in the Eastern Bering Sea. Econometric results provide support for herding behavior among fishermen within the <b>yellowfin</b> <b>sole</b> fishery. Moreover, fishermen respond to the lagged biomass and spatially weighted biomass signals as significant determinants of locational choice. This results in Lotka-Volterra oscillations in the Pacific cod fishery. In the final chapter of this dissertation, the general findings are concluded and some future avenues of research are discussed...|$|E

40|$|As a {{changing}} climate warms {{waters of the}} North Pacific and changes {{the timing of the}} ice cover in the northern Bering Sea, an ecosystem shift is expected that may extend the distribution of crab and fish populations northward into the subarctic Regions. In anticipation of commercially important stocks shifting northward, the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) established the Northern Bering Sea Research Area (NBSRA) in 2008. This area is closed to nonpelagic (bottom) trawling pending understanding of its impacts on the near-pristine ecosystem. The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC) was charged with developing a Research Plan to investigate the impacts of nonpelagic trawling in the NBSRA. The remoteness, harsh climate and extended periods of ice cover in the NBS have long deterred commercial fishing. Historically, there has been very low levels of nonpelagic trawling and consequently almost no knowledge of fisheries potential, benthic habitat, and trawl impacts. In 2010, funded by the NOAA Loss of Sea Ice (LOSI) program to understand the impacts of ocean warming on the ecosystem, the AFSC annual summer bottom-trawl survey in the eastern Bering Sea was extended into the NBS. Survey results indicate that essentially the only groundfish species with any commercial nonpelagic fishery potential in the NBS is the <b>yellowfin</b> <b>sole</b> Limanda aspera.

The {{published}} {{article is}} copyrighted by Inter-Research {{and can be}} found at: [URL] To the best of our knowledge, one or more authors of this paper were federal employees when contributing to this work. Certain ecological processes dominate others at particular scales, and the response of populations to exogenous and endogenous forces are typically scale dependent. In spite of this central role played by scale, the temporal and spatial scales of human impacts on ecosystems and populations remain almost unknown. We applied a multiscale regression analysis to investigate the spatiotemporal scales which characterize the fisheries exploitation of <b>yellowfin</b> <b>sole</b> Limanda aspera in the Bering Sea. We found that harvesting affects the abundance of this species simultaneously at local and regional scales. At the local scale harvesting produced a negative effect on local fish densities, particularly in those areas and seasons of high fish aggregation, when both the vulnerability of the fish and the fishing effort increase. At the regional scale harvesting was characterized by a widespread negative effect on the whole fish population. Our findings demonstrate that (1) detection of the fisheries exploitation effects on natural populations is sensitive to the scale of investigation, (2) fisheries harvesting can simultaneously affect multiple ecological scales which are not linearly correlated with each other. We developed analytical techniques for the detection of scale-dependent processes, which can be readily applied to other systems. Our results provide insights on the risks of extrapolating the effects of harvesting on natural populations across scales, making the issues of scale and space central to the management and conservation of natural populations...|$|E
40|$|Alaska plaice, Pleuronectes quadrituberculatus, {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{flatfishes}} in the eastern Bering Sea ecosystem and is most highly concentrated in the shallow continental shelf of the eastern Bering Sea. Annual commercial catches have ranged from less than 1, 000 metric tons (t) in 1963 to 62, 000 t in 1988. Alaska plaice is a relatively large flatfish averaging about 32 cm in length and 390 g in weight in commercial catches. They are distributed from nearshore waters to a depth of about 100 m in the eastern Bering Sea during summer, but move to deeper continental shelf waters in winter to escape sea ice and cold water temperatures. Being a long-lived species (> 30 years), they have a relatively low natural mortality rate estimated at 0. 20. Maturing at about age 7, Alaska plaice spawn from April through June on hard sandy substrates of the shelf region, primarily around the 100 m isobath. Prey items primarily include polychaetes and other marine worms. In comparison with other flatfish, Alaska plaice and rock sole, Pleuronectes bilineatus, have similar diets but different habitat preferences with separate areas of peak population density which may minimize interspecific competition. <b>Yellowfin</b> <b>sole,</b> Pleuronectes asper, while sharing similar habitat, differs from these two species because of the variety of prey items in its diet.

In this work a simulation package {{was developed and}} {{used to evaluate the}} sensitivity of the Stock Synthesis program. More specifically, the evaluation focused on the impacts of input data errors and stock characteristics on the accuracy and precision of Synthesis estimates. Factors examined included the length of the time series of data, the rate of natural mortality, the shape of the fishery and survey selectivity curves, the trend in the rate of fishing mortality, the recruitment pattern, and errors in the observed data for annual catch, fishing effort, fishery and survey age composition, and survey biomass indices. First, the study evaluated the sensitivity of the Stock Synthesis program applied to populations with simple multinomial age compositions. The length of the data series and sample size were the two most influential factors. Second, the study focused on populations with compound multinomial age composition, in which the age composition data were over-dispersed relative to simple multinomial samples. When the fishery age composition actually followed a compound multinomial distribution, the estimates produced by the Stock Synthesis program, which assumed simple multinomial distributions with maximum sample sizes of 400 fish, were moderately more biased and more variable. When applying Synthesis to populations whose age compositions follow compound multinomial distributions, the results from the experiments indicated that a common configuration, in which age sample sizes in the likelihood specification are limited to 400 fish per sample, probably gives age composition data too much emphasis. The experiments indicated that using 200 as the upper limit provided more accurate results than using 400.

This study implemented and evaluated alternative sampling and estimation methods, with the goal to incorporate additional sources of information for increased precision of individual species' estimates from multispecies trawl surveys. First, habitat characteristics and past spatial distributions of four flatfish species' density were incorporated into a multispecies trawl survey design conducted in Kalsin and Middle Bays, Kodiak Island, Alaska. Stratification by depth and percent sand produced estimates of relative abundance with lower CV s than those from unstratified sampling. Additional decreases in relative precision were generally not achieved by estimating the relative abundance of multiple species from regions of species-specific suboptimal habitat. Second, a poststratification technique was used to incorporate species-specific habitat characteristics and previous distributions of species' density into the estimation of species' abundance from the Kalsin and Middle Bays' trawl survey. Poststratification by habitat gave estimates with lower variance and/or less design-bias than an unstratified estimator for all species in all years. Poststratification by habitat and fish density produced estimates with the least design-bias for all species in all years and the lowest variance when stratum sample sizes were sufficient. Third, mixed model linear regression (MMLR), empirical Bayes (EB) and hierarchical Bayes (HB) estimation methods were used to incorporate historical trends of <b>yellowfin</b> <b>sole,</b> Limanda aspera biomass from the eastern Bering Sea trawl survey into annual biomass estimates. Using MMLR, EB, and HB methods resulted in biomass estimates that were less anomalous than survey estimates with respect to a linear regression trend. Estimates for all three methods had lower CV s than surveys in most years. The results of this thesis suggest that incorporating additional information into survey design and estimation can decrease the variability of survey estimates and/or correct for possible bias. Methods that can incorporate additional information, therefore, have the potential to improve survey assessments for management use...|$|E
