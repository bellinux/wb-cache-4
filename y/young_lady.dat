5|$|File:Paolo Ucello 001.jpg|A <b>Young</b> <b>Lady</b> of Fashion is {{attributed}} to the Florentine painter and mathematician Paolo Uccello and dates early 1460s. The <b>young</b> <b>lady</b> has plucked her hairline to increase the expanse, and thus elegance, of her forehead, and a lock of hair falls at the back in a ponytail. A tight-fitting cap covers her ears, a fashion possibly due to the prevalent belief {{of the time that}} the Virgin Mary conceived through the ear.|$|E
5|$|In 1833 Balzac {{released}} Eugénie Grandet, {{his first}} best-seller. The {{tale of a}} <b>young</b> <b>lady</b> who inherits her father's miserliness, it also became the most critically acclaimed book of his career.

5|$|The {{music video}} portrayed a {{different}} persona of Madonna, rather than her film character {{for which it}} was released. Like the song, it incorporated Hispanic culture and portrayed her dressed in Spanish style as a <b>young</b> <b>lady</b> in search of a treasure. Madonna has performed the song on her Who's That Girl World Tour (1987) and on the Rebel Heart Tour (2015–2016). The song has been covered by many artists and has appeared in compilations and tribute albums.|$|E
5|$|Trollope has {{described}} {{again and again}} the ravages of love... His story is always primarily a love-story, and a love-story constructed on an inveterate system. There is a <b>young</b> <b>lady</b> who has two lovers, or {{a young man who}} has two sweethearts; we are treated to the innumerable forms in which this predicament may present itself and the consequences, sometimes pathetic, sometimes grotesque, which spring from such false situations.|$|E

First, they secure the {{allegiance}} of the Wildlings, {{who are still}} indebted to Jon for saving them at Hardhome, and are aware the Boltons will wipe them out if they do nothing. They also manage to secure the allegiance of House Mormont when Davos warns the <b>young</b> <b>Lady</b> Lyanna Mormont of the dangers the White Walkers pose. However, {{they are unable to}} secure the allegiance of House Glover, with Lord Robett Glover pointing out how Robb Stark failed to protect his home from the Ironborn.|$|E

5|$|Andrić {{initially}} had {{a precarious}} {{relationship with the}} communists because he had previously been an official in the royalist government. He returned to public life only once the Germans had been forced out of Belgrade. Na Drini ćuprija was published in March 1945. It was followed by Travnička hronika that September and Gospođica (The <b>Young</b> <b>Lady)</b> that November. Na Drini ćuprija came {{to be regarded as}} Andrić's magnum opus and was proclaimed a classic of Yugoslav literature by the communists. It chronicles the history of the Mehmed Paša Sokolović Bridge and the town of Višegrad from the bridge's construction in the 16th century until the outbreak of World War I. The second novel, Travnička hronika, follows a French diplomat in Bosnia during the Napoleonic Wars. The third, Gospođica, revolves around the life of a Sarajevan woman. In the post-war period, Andrić also published several short story collections, some travel memoirs, and a number of essays on writers such as Vuk Karadžić, Petar II Petrović-Njegoš, and Petar Kočić.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} morning hours, marine {{biologist}} Doc is already at work in his one-man Western Biological Laboratory, getting an order of starfish ready to be shipped to a university. His unintelligent friend Hazel (a man) comes in to chat with him ("All Kinds of People"). Millicent, a wealthy <b>young</b> <b>lady,</b> enters from the next room, where she has been spending (part of) the night with Doc. Mac, another friend of Doc, brings in Suzy, who has injured her hand breaking a window to steal some donuts. Doc, whose lack of a medical degree does not stop the denizens of Cannery Row from seeking him out for treatment, bandages her hand, as the irritated Millicent leaves. Suzy, new in town, is curious about Doc's work ("The Tide Pool") and tells about her journey from San Francisco ("Everybody's Got a Home but Me"). Fauna, who runs the nearby Bear Flag Café—an establishment open even at this hour—had heard that a new girl in town had injured herself, and has come to talk to Suzy. Fauna is initially reluctant to invite Suzy into the Bear Flag, but when Jim, the local plainclothes cop gives Suzy a hard time, Fauna takes Suzy in. Suzy is fully aware {{of what kind of}} a place it is.|$|E
5|$|One of Mary's first {{actions as}} queen was {{to order the}} release of the Roman Catholic Duke of Norfolk and Stephen Gardiner from {{imprisonment}} in the Tower of London, as well as her kinsman Edward Courtenay. Mary understood that the <b>young</b> <b>Lady</b> Jane was essentially a pawn in Dudley's scheme, and Dudley was the only conspirator of rank executed for high treason {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the coup. Lady Jane and her husband, Lord Guildford Dudley, though found guilty, were kept under guard in the Tower rather than immediately executed, while Lady Jane's father, Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk, was released. Mary was left in a difficult position, as almost all the Privy Counsellors had been implicated in the plot to put Lady Jane on the throne. She appointed Gardiner to the council and made him both Bishop of Winchester and Lord Chancellor, offices he held until his death in November 1555. Susan Clarencieux became Mistress of the Robes. On 1 October 1553, Gardiner crowned Mary at Westminster Abbey.|$|E
