2500|$|In June 2012 Clarke {{discussed}} {{issues of}} cybersecurity in depth {{in an interview}} on The Colbert Report in which he was seemingly misled into thinking that they were discussing cyber-security threats from the Chinese through the use of mobile devices such as iPads. Instead, Stephen Colbert was doing a humorous piece on the threats of Orangutans learning to use iPads. Indeed, when confronted on the issue directly, Clarke himself clarified that he was not discussing non-human primate based cyberterrorism threats. [...] "Orangutans? <b>You</b> <b>mean</b> <b>like</b> apes?" [...] said Clarke, [...] "Are you sh**tin' me? I'm talking about the Chinese." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Get up, brute, and don't grovel there, {{but tell}} me what <b>you</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>like</b> a human being. If old Miriam is once dead, her bonds die with her, don't they?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Humorous?" [...] Mrs. Corey knitted {{her brows}} in some perplexity. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>like</b> Mrs. Sayre?" [...] she asked, naming the lady whose name must come into every Boston mind when humour is mentioned.|$|E

6000|$|... 'She {{will not}} feel that,' said Ethel; 'but indeed, Tom, I see what <b>you</b> <b>mean,</b> and <b>like</b> it. It is yourself, {{and not the}} conferrer of the benefit, that {{you want her to}} care for.' ...|$|R
60|$|PHOEBE (pouting). La, sir, <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> I am <b>like</b> Aunt Phoebe. Every {{one says}} so--and indeed 'tis no compliment.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hold your peace all of you, and be--," [...] said Wakefield; {{and then}} {{addressing}} his comrade, he {{took him by}} the extended hand, with something alike of respect and defiance. [...] "Robin," [...] he said, [...] "thou hast used me ill enough this day; but if <b>you</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>like</b> a frank fellow, to shake hands, and take a tussle for love on the sod, why I'll forgie thee, man, and we shall be better friends than ever." ...|$|E
5000|$|We {{wanted to}} be an {{architecture}} group that was more like a rock band. We were telling Sharon friendthat we would be doing underground architecture, like underground newspapers and underground movies, and she said, ‘Oh, <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>like</b> an Ant Farm?’ and that’s all it took. It was very Ant Farm. The founding of the name was indicative of how Ant Farm worked: the right idea comes, everybody acknowledges it is the right idea and instantly adopts it. Doug Michels ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'And what do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> {{by coming}} <b>like</b> a great--huge--big {{elephant}} {{in our way}} to stop up the stairs?' demanded Fly, in return.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hah! ... What <b>you</b> <b>mean,</b> girl, runnin' <b>like</b> {{a streak}} right down on us? You're actin' queer these days, an' you look queer. I'm not likin' it." ...|$|R
6000|$|Her cry was hungry: [...] "Oh, please don't go." [...] She {{was beside}} him, shyly picking at his sleeve. [...] "I know what <b>you</b> <b>mean.</b> I <b>like</b> <b>you</b> {{for being so}} understanding. But---- I do like you. You were the perfect companion. Let's---- Oh, let's have a walk--and try to laugh again." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1950, the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Organized Crime {{started an}} {{investigation}} {{known as the}} Kefauver hearings, named after its chairman, Sen. Estes Kefauver. Along {{with other members of}} Genovese family, Moretti, by then widely known by his alias [...] "Willie Moore," [...] was called to testify. Moretti {{was the only one who}} cooperated with the committee. While the other mobsters refused to testify by repeatedly invoking the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which provides legal protection against self-incrimination, the garrulous Moretti told jokes, spoke candidly, and generally played it up for the cameras. For example, when asked how long he'd been in the Mafia he replied, [...] "What do <b>you</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>like</b> do I carry a membership card that says 'Mafia' on it?" [...] And when asked how he operated politically he said, [...] "I don't operate politically, if I did I'd be a congressman." [...] The Senators and spectators in the room broke out laughing at his responses. In doing so, however, he was violating the Mafia code of silence, known as omertà.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} <b>you</b> <b>mean.</b> I always <b>liked</b> Tregear, and I am {{very sorry for}} him. If you would take it a little quieter, I {{think it would be}} better." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “What do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> by {{speaking}} <b>like</b> this, in this tone, in these words? You seem {{to use them}} as if they were a sort of formula. Am I a dear to you? Or is anybody? [...] . or everybody? [...] .” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think I {{know what}} <b>you</b> <b>mean.</b> Cyril was <b>like</b> my mother--she died {{a long while}} ago, but I {{remember}} her as gentle, sympathetic, and perhaps more variable than I am. Cyril was swayed by feeling rather than by judgment." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know exactly}} the sort of man <b>you</b> <b>mean,</b> always <b>liking</b> to lay down the law and talking to women instead of men, because they don't argue with him. No, Bobus must not come to that, and he is too young to begin special training. Will you talk to him, Mr. Ogilvie? You know if my horse is not {{convinced}} I may bring him to the water, but it will be all in vain." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't {{know what}} <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> by not <b>liking</b> it. I have not the {{slightest}} objection to lending you any money I can spare. I don't think you'll find any other of your friends who will like it better. You can have it by eleven o'clock to-morrow.' ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{returned}} his {{look as if}} it had made her wonder. [...] "I LIKED it, if that's what <b>you</b> <b>mean.</b> But <b>you</b> <b>liked</b> it surely yourself. I protest, that I had easy work with you. I had only at last--when I thought it was time--to speak for you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Under the streets, in the sewers, in the wires, in the telephones, {{there is}} {{something}} alive; is that what <b>you</b> <b>mean?</b> In things <b>like</b> dust-carts, and men mending roads? You feel {{that all the time}} when you walk about London, and when you turn on a tap and the water comes?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, then, if I {{have you}} when I am at home, I don't care,--I mean--" [...] said Gerald, {{conscious}} of the egotism he was committing, [...] "I <b>mean</b> <b>you</b> don't <b>like</b> it half so well, do you?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Dylan's mother {{claims that}} there was {{extensive}} coercion in his interrogation: [...] "In this statement Dylan is trying {{to tell his story}} as to what happened, and you've got this TBI agent saying, 'Don't <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> this? Don't <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> it happened <b>like</b> this?' And, 'No Dylan, it went down like this.' And you can honestly tell at the point that Dylan, I can as his mother, he gave up. He's like, 'OK, if that's what you said, OK, Cindy Adams said.|$|R
6000|$|Jake {{smiled in}} a curious way. [...] "I think I see what <b>you</b> <b>mean.</b> Miss Kenwardine <b>likes</b> me, but {{although}} I've some artistic taste, I'm frankly flesh and blood; and that's not quite her style. She finds me a little more in harmony with her than the rest, but this is all. Still, it's something to me. Now you understand matters, perhaps you won't take so much trouble to keep me out of Santa Brigida." ...|$|R
6000|$|NEWTE [at first puzzled, then indignant, now breaks out]. What's {{the little}} game on here--eh? Yesterday {{afternoon}} you {{were given the}} sack--by your mistress, Lady Bantock, with a month's wages in lieu of notice--not an hour before you deserved it. What do <b>you</b> <b>mean,</b> going on <b>like</b> this, {{as if nothing had}} happened? Is Lady Bantock to be ignored in this house as if she didn't exist--or is she not? [He brings his fist down on the table. He has been shouting rather than speaking.] I want this thing settled! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> {{by looking}} <b>like</b> that, all of you?" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "What does it matter? He was only my man-servant. I am Wenham Gardner, millionaire. No one will {{put me in}} prison for that. Besides, he shouldn't have tried to keep me away from my wife. Anyway, it don't matter. I am quite mad. Mad people can do what they like. They have to stop in an asylum for six months, and then they're quite cured and they start again. I don't mind being mad for six months. Elizabeth," [...] he whined, [...] "come and be mad, too. You haven't been kind to me. There's plenty more money--plenty more. Come back for a little time and I'll show you." ...|$|R
2500|$|In {{the same}} Entertainment Weekly article, Corgan {{disclosed}} that {{things went wrong}} {{at some of the}} very first recording sessions. [...] "...it was <b>like,</b> 'What do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> the guitar's out of tune? What do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> I have to be there at 11? What do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> I can't order $100 of lobster every day?' I <b>mean,</b> <b>like,</b> bad. But it was too late. It was already public. The album was going out. So I did what I always did: try {{to make the best of}} a situation and start covering up. Put on a good face. And honestly, I'm glad the thing didn't sell, because if it had sold well it would have been really tough. I would look like I was going to walk away from something that I'd just built." ...|$|R
5000|$|Cindy Adams, {{the mother}} of Zach and Dylan Adams, claims that she has heard Dylan's {{confession}} and it doesn't fit with the known facts of the case. [...] "If it had gone down the way that Dylan described it, they would have blood in that house. They would have found DNA in that house. They would have found hair in that house. They would have found a fingernail. They would have found something that placed Holly in that house. There's no chemical cleanup in that house. There's no nothing that ever indicated that Holly has been in that house, but {{if you listen to}} Dylan's story, and I'm not going to go into everything he says, but it's pretty graphic. There's no way they would not have found something," [...] Cindy Adams said. She also claims there was extensive coercion: [...] "In this statement Dylan is trying to tell his story as to what happened, and you've got this TBI agent saying, 'Don't <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> this? Don't <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> it happened <b>like</b> this?' And, 'No Dylan, it went down like this.' And you can honestly tell at the point that Dylan, I can as his mother, he gave up. He's like, 'OK, if that's what you said, OK," [...] Cindy Adams said.|$|R
6000|$|... "A sort of success," [...] said Endymion; [...] "I {{know what}} <b>you</b> <b>mean.</b> But what I mean is real success in life. I <b>mean,</b> I should <b>like</b> to {{be a public}} man." ...|$|R
5000|$|Despite the albums {{widespread}} {{critical acclaim}} and a Best New Music nod from Pitchfork, Tatum {{reflected on the}} albums recording process in 2013, stating: [...] "Nocturne felt like {{it took a long}} time for me. I took my time and it was really spread out, with months in between writing songs. There was so much thought put into that record, so much of me being a perfectionist, like, Okay, this really has to sound a certain way. In a lot of ways, I listen to that record now and think I thought way too hard on this. To me, it’s sort of missing something… even though Im so proud of that record and I think a lot of the songs are good. I <b>mean,</b> <b>you</b> should <b>like</b> your own music, otherwise why even make it?" ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1992, she {{was listed}} by People {{as one of}} the [...] "50 most {{beautiful}} people in the world". In 1995, Empire chose her {{as one of the}} [...] "100 sexiest stars in film history", and in October 1997, she was ranked among the [...] "top 100 film stars of all time" [...] by the magazine. In 1999, she was rated among the [...] "25 sexiest stars of the century" [...] by Playboy. She {{has been the subject of}} four television documentary specials, and several biograhies have been written about her. On her sex symbol image, Stone told Oprah Winfrey on Oprah Prime in 2014: [...] "It's a pleasure for me now. I mean, I'm gonna be 56 years old. If people want to think I'm a sex symbol, it's, like, yeah. Think it up. <b>You</b> know. I <b>mean,</b> <b>like,</b> good for me". In 2015, Stone posed naked for the September issue of Harper's Bazaar magazine, in which she stated: [...] "At a certain point you start asking yourself, 'What really is sexy?' It’s not just the elevation of your boobs. It’s being present and having fun and liking yourself enough to like the person that's with you".|$|R
6000|$|Isabel {{gazed at}} her cousin again. [...] "I don't know what <b>you</b> <b>mean.</b> <b>You</b> <b>mean</b> something--that <b>you</b> don't <b>mean.</b> What was Monsieur Merle?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> to say..." [...] Ginger gulped {{and started}} again. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> {{to tell me}} that you let me have... all that money... for the dog-business... when you were broke? Do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> to say..." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What do <b>you</b> <b>mean,</b> Maynard?' said Caterina, {{with anger}} {{flashing}} from her eyes. 'Do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> that I let him {{make love to}} me? What right have you to think that of me? What do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> that <b>you</b> saw yesterday evening?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> by this conduct, Sam?' inquired Mr. Winkle indignantly. 'Get out, sir, this instant. What do <b>you</b> <b>mean,</b> Sir?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That matters little. What do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> in turn? What did <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> by saying, that {{saving lives}} is saving immortal souls?" ...|$|R
