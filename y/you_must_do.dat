25|$|Boca Juniors has had {{a long-standing}} rivalry with River Plate. The Superclásico is known {{worldwide}} as one of world football's fiercest and most important rivalries. It is particularly noted for {{the passion of the}} fans, the stands of both teams feature fireworks, coloured confetti, flags and rolls of paper. Both sets of supporters sing passionate songs (often based on popular Argentine rock band tunes) against their rivals, and the stadiums are known to bounce with the simultaneous jumping of the fans. Sometimes the games have been known to end in riots between the hardest supporters of both sides or against the police. The English newspaper The Observer put the Superclásico (played at La Bombonera) {{at the top of their}} list of 50 sporting things <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>do</b> before you die.|$|E

500|$|In October 1888 Lang {{was elected}} to an All Souls Fellowship, and began to divide his time between London and Oxford. Some of his Oxford friends were {{training}} for ordination and Lang was often drawn into their discussions. Eventually the question entered Lang's mind: [...] "Why shouldn't you be ordained?" [...] The thought persisted, and one Sunday evening in early 1889, after {{a visit to the}} theological college at Cuddesdon, Lang attended evening service at the Cuddesdon parish church. By his own account, during the sermon he was gripped by [...] "a masterful inward voice" [...] which told him [...] "You are wanted. You are called. You must obey." [...] He immediately severed his connection with the Bar, renounced his political ambitions and applied for a place at Cuddesdon College. With the help of an All Souls contact, the essential step of his confirmation into the Church of England was supervised by the Bishop of Lincoln. Lang's decision to become an Anglican and seek ordination disappointed his Presbyterian father, who nevertheless wrote to his son: [...] "What you think, prayerfully and solemnly, you ought to do – <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>do</b> – we will accept." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{the early}} {{release of the}} lyrics, it had {{garnered}} criticism from some Asian and Hispanic communities, including Latino groups MECha and Chicanos Unidos Arizona, claiming that the usage of the terms [...] "chola" [...] and [...] "orient" [...] was offensive and derogatory. In response to the lyrics, Robert Paul Reyes of Newsblaze.com stated that while he agreed with its pro-gay stance, he questioned {{the use of the}} term [...] "chola", asking, [...] "Are Latinos supposed to be grateful that a white superstar, born of privilege, included a racist shout out to our community? Not all Latino ladies are 'cholas' in the barrio, some of them are teachers, writers, engineers and nurses and doctors." [...] Radio stations in Malaysia chose to censor the part of the lyrics dealing with the acceptance of the LGBT community, due to censorship in the country of content that may be deemed offensive. In response, Gaga urged her Malaysian fans, who wanted the uncensored version to be played, to take action by stating: [...] "It is your job and it is your duty as young people to have your voices heard. <b>You</b> <b>must</b> <b>do</b> everything that you can if you want to be liberated by your society. You must call, you must not stop, you must protest peaceably." ...|$|E

2500|$|Even though Stalin was {{preparing}} for a likely war, he still believed that he could at least avoid a short-term clash. [...] In an effort to demonstrate peaceful intentions toward Germany, on April 13, 1941, the Soviets signed a neutrality pact with Axis power Japan. During that signing ceremony, Stalin embraced the German ambassador and exclaimed [...] "we must remain friends and <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>do</b> everything to that end!" [...] While Stalin had little faith in Japan's commitment to neutrality, {{he felt that the}} pact was important for its political symbolism, to reinforce a public affection for Germany. Stalin felt that there was a growing split in German circles about whether Germany should initiate a war with the Soviet Union.|$|E
2500|$|If {{you desire}} long life, {{the first thing}} <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>do</b> is to expel the three corpses. Once the three corpses are expelled, you must fix your aim and your thought, {{eliminating}} sensual desires. I [...] then received [...] Divine Methods in Five Sections (Shenfang wupian 神方五篇) [...] It says: [...] "The ambushing corpses always ascend to Heaven to report on people's sins on the first, fifteenth, and last days of each month. The Director of Allotted Life Spans (Siming 司命) deducts from people's accounts and shortens their life spans accordingly. The gods within people's bodies want to make people live, but the corpses want to make them die. When people die, their gods disperse; the corpses, once in this bodiless state, become ghosts, and when people sacrifice to [...] these ghosts obtain the offering foods. This is why the corpses want people to die. When you dream of fighting with an evil person, this is [...] the corpses and the gods at war [...]" [...] So I followed his [...] instructions, synthesized [...] and ingested it, and thereby attained transcendence.
