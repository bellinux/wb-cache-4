50|$|By definition, lift is {{perpendicular}} to the oncoming flow. As the left wing moves up, its effective angle of attack is decreased, so its lift vector tilts back. Conversely, as the right wing descends, its lift vector tilts forward. The result is an adverse <b>yaw</b> <b>moment</b> to the left, opposite to the intended right turn.|$|E
50|$|The torque {{vectoring}} rear axle differential is designed and manufactured by Magna Powertrain, {{and is being}} offered on Audi A4, A5, A6 and their derivatives (including RS models). The Sport Differential selectively distributes torque to the rear axle wheels thereby generating a <b>yaw</b> <b>moment,</b> which improves handling and also stabilizes the vehicle when it oversteers or understeers, thereby increasing safety.|$|E

40|$|The {{magnitudes}} of the <b>yawing</b> <b>moments</b> {{produced by}} {{various parts of}} an airplane during spins have previously {{been found to be}} of major importance in determining the nature of the spin. Discrepancies in resultant <b>yawing</b> <b>moments</b> determined from model and full-scale tests, however, have indicated the probable importance of scale effect on the model. In order to obtain data for a more detailed comparison between full-scale and model results, flight tests were made to determine the <b>yawing</b> <b>moments</b> contributed by various parts of an airplane in spins. The inertia moment was determined by the usual measurement of the spinning motion, and the aerodynamic <b>yawing</b> <b>moments</b> on the fuselage, fin, and rudder were determined by pressure-distribution measurements over these parts of the airplane. The wing <b>yawing</b> <b>moment</b> was determined by taking the difference between the gyroscopic moment and the fuselage, fin, and rudder moments.

40|$|Extensive {{pressure}} measurements and off-surface flow visualization were obtained on the forebody and strakes of the NASA F- 18 High Alpha Research Vehicle (HARV) equipped with actuated forebody strakes. Forebody <b>yawing</b> <b>moments</b> {{were obtained by}} integrating the circumferential pressures on the forebody and strakes. Results show that large <b>yawing</b> <b>moments</b> can be generated with forebody strakes. At a 50 -angle-of-attack, deflecting one strake at a time resulted in a forebody <b>yawing</b> <b>moment</b> control reversal for small strake deflection angles. However, deflecting the strakes differentially about a 20 symmetric strake deployment eliminated the control reversal and produced a near linear variation of forebody <b>yawing</b> <b>moment</b> with differential strake deflection. At an angle of attack of 50 and for 0 and 20 symmetric strake deployments, a larger forebody <b>yawing</b> <b>moment</b> was generated by the forward fuselage (between the radome and {{the apex of the}} leading-edge extensions) than on the radome where the actuated forebody strakes were located. Cutouts on the flight vehicle strakes that were not on the wind tunnel models are believed to be responsible for deficits in the suction peaks on the flight radome pressure distributions and differences in the forebody <b>yawing</b> <b>moments.</b> NOMENCLATURE ANSER actuated nose strakes for enhanced rolling C aircraft <b>yawing</b> <b>moment</b> at = 0 C forebody (F.

5000|$|Yaw rate input at any {{roll angle}} generates rudder, fin and {{fuselage}} force vectors which dominate the resultant yawing moment.

50|$|An {{advantage}} {{of the new system}} is the increased level of wheel speed control afforded by the 3-phase control cycle, which now operates at 18 MHz (up from 12 MHz) and has increased ROM capacity (32kB up from 12kB).

50|$|The deceleron, or split aileron, was {{developed}} in the late 1940s by Northrop originally for use on the F-89 Scorpion fighter aircraft. It is a two-part aileron that can be deflected as a unit to provide roll control, or split open to act as an air brake. Decelerons are also used on the Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II and the Northrop B-2 Spirit flying wing.

50|$|The impetus {{behind the}} {{research}} into sweeping jet actuators {{lies in the}} realization that any vertical tail structure on an aircraft is a parasitic surface in level flight. The design specification that must be met by the vertical stabilizer of any multi-engined aircraft is that it {{be able to produce}} enough lift to counteract any thrust asymmetry that would come as a result of engine failure during rotation (takeoff); but in any condition that is not an emergency or where a <b>yaw</b> <b>moment</b> is not desired the vertical stabilizer will only contribute added weight and drag to the aircraft.|$|E

50|$|Active Yaw Control uses a torque {{transfer}} {{mechanism in}} the rear differential to control rear wheel torque differential for different driving conditions and so limit the <b>yaw</b> <b>moment</b> that acts on the vehicle body and enhance cornering performance. AYC also acts like a limited slip differential by suppressing rear wheel slip to improve traction. In its latest form, AYC now features yaw rate feedback control using a yaw rate sensor and also gains braking force control. Accurately determining the cornering dynamics on a realtime basis, the system operates to control vehicle behavior through corners and realize vehicle behavior that more closely mirrors driver intent.|$|E
50|$|Torque {{vectoring}} is {{even more}} effective if it is actuated through two electric motor drives located on the same axle, as this configuration {{can be used for}} shaping the vehicle understeer characteristic and improving the transient response of the vehicle,. A special transmission unit is used in the experimental car MUTE of the Technical University of Munich, where the bigger motor is providing the driving power and the smaller for the torque vectoring functionality. The detailed control system of the torque vectoring is described in the doctoral thesis of Dr.-Ing. Michael Graf. In case of electric vehicles with four electric motor drives, the same total wheel torque and <b>yaw</b> <b>moment</b> can be generated through an infinite number of wheel torque distributions. Energy efficiency {{can be used as a}} criterion for allocating the torques among the individual wheels,.|$|E
50|$|In {{a coordinated}} turn, adverse yaw is {{effectively}} compensated {{by the use}} of the rudder, which results in a sideforce on the vertical tail that opposes the adverse yaw by creating a favorable yawing moment. Another method of compensation is 'differential ailerons', which have been rigged such that the down-going aileron deflects less than the up-going one. In this case the opposing <b>yaw</b> <b>moment</b> is generated by a difference in profile drag between the left and right wingtips. Frise ailerons accentuate this profile drag imbalance by protruding beneath the wing of an upward-deflected aileron, most often by being hinged slightly behind the leading edge and {{near the bottom of the}} surface, with the lower section of the aileron surface's leading edge protruding slightly below the wing's undersurface when the aileron is deflected upwards, substantially increasing profile drag on that side. Ailerons may also be designed to use a combination of these methods.|$|E

50|$|The {{idea and}} {{implementation}} of torque vectoring are both complex. The main goal of torque vectoring is to independently vary torque to each wheel. Differentials generally consist of only mechanical components. A torque vectoring differential requires an electronic monitoring system in addition to standard mechanical components. This electronic system tells the differential {{when and how to}} vary the torque. Due to the number of wheels that receive power, a front or rear wheel drive differential is less complex than an all-wheel drive differential.The impact of torque distribution is the generation of <b>yaw</b> <b>moment</b> arising from longitudinal forces and changes to the lateral resistance generated by each tyre. Applying more longitudinal force reduces the lateral resistance that can be generated. The specific driving condition dictates what the trade-off should be to either damp or excite yaw acceleration. The function is independent of technology and could be achieved by driveline devices for a conventional powertrain, or with electrical torque sources.Then comes the practical element of integration with brake stability functions for both fun and safety.|$|E
5000|$|The KORD (Russian {{acronym for}} KOntrol Raketnykh Dvigateley—literally [...] "Control (of) Rocket Engines"—Russian: Контроль ракетных двигателей) was the {{automatic}} {{engine control system}} devised to throttle, shutdown and monitor the large cluster of 30 engines in Block A (the first stage). The KORD system controlled the differential thrusting {{of the outer ring}} of 24 engines for pitch and yaw attitude control by throttling them appropriately and it also shut down malfunctioning engines situated opposite each other. This was to negate the pitch or <b>yaw</b> <b>moment</b> diametrically opposing engines in the outer ring would generate, thus maintaining symmetrical thrust. Block A could perform nominally with two pairs of opposing engines shut down (26/30 engines), Block B with one pair of opposing engines shutdown (6/8 engines) and Block V with one engine shut down (3/4 engines). Unfortunately the KORD system was unable to react to rapidly occurring processes such as the exploding turbo-pump during the 5L launch. Due to the deficiencies of the KORD system a new computer system was developed for the last launch, vehicle 7L, called the S-530. It was the first Soviet digital guidance and control system. The telemetry system relayed data back at an estimated rate of 9.6 gigabytes per second on 320,000 channels on 14 frequencies. Commands could be sent to an ascending N1 at the same rate.|$|E
50|$|In 2001, Mitsubishi {{equipped}} the Lancer Evolution VII {{with the}} AYC system, Mitsubishi's own Sports ABS and a newly developed Active Center Differential (ACD), which used an electronically controlled variable multi-plate clutch. The ACD has a differential limiting capacity three {{times greater than}} that of the viscous coupling-type differential used to date. Also, the ACD's ability to tailor slippage for different driving conditions enabled the levels of steering response and traction control not possible with a viscous coupling differential. In addition, a three-way manual override switch enables the driver to select tarmac, gravel or snow modes to suit his preferences or driving conditions. The ACD also frees the differential on operation of the hand brake, allowing the driver to make more effective use of side brake turns in rallies and gymkhanas. On the Evolution VII, control of the ACD and AYC systems is integrated {{for the very first time}} (integrated management of these systems is the core of Mitsubishi's AWC philosophy). In the integrated system, ACD feedback and feedforward information is transmitted to the AYC control system using parameters in such a way that the larger the ACD differential limiting force is, the larger the <b>yaw</b> <b>moment</b> generated by the AYC system. This integrated control operates so that, for example when accelerating out of a corner, the ACD enhances traction and the AYC enhances steering response and cornering performance, improving acceleration and handling more than the ACD and AYC systems would if they were operating independently. By doing so, the Lancer Evolution VII heralded the birth of Mitsubishi’s AWC technology.|$|E

An innovative idea for the direct <b>yaw</b> <b>moment</b> control is introduced by using an active controller system to supervise the lat-eral dynamics of vehicle and perform as an active <b>yaw</b> <b>moment</b> control system, denoted as the stabilizer pendulum system (SPS).
