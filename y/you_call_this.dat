2500|$|The {{first such}} {{depiction}} {{is through the}} character Trebeck in Thomas Henry Lister’s [...] Granby (1826), who abandons dandyism when he discovers a waistcoat of his devising worn by ‘a natty apprentice’. In Bulwer Lytton's 1828 novel Pelham, {{the hero of the}} title portrays a dandy who, at one point, passes through Calais and meets the inspiration of his way of life in the character of Mr. Russelton. The latter is modeled on Brummell and to him are attributed such stories from the Brummell apocrypha as his once needing three tailors to contribute to the making of his gloves and the sartorial insult [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>this</b> a coat?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Brummell {{put into}} {{practice}} the principles of harmony of shape and contrast of colours with such a pleasing result that men of superior rank sought his opinion on their dress. [...] The Duke of Bedford once did this touching a coat. Brummell examined his Grace with the cool impertinence which was his Grace’s due. He turned him about, scanned him with scrutinizing, contemptuous eye, and then taking the lapel between his dainty finger and thumb, he exclaimed {{in a tone of}} pitying wonder, “Bedford, do <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>this</b> thing a coat?” His personal habits, such as a fastidious attention to cleaning his teeth, shaving, and daily bathing exerted an influence on the ton - the upper echelons of polite society - who began to do likewise. Enthralled, the Prince would spend hours in Brummell's dressing room, witnessing the progress of his friend's lengthy morning toilette.|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{asked me}} to meet you, and, as far as I can see, every man in Carrington is here," [...] he said. [...] "Raymond Lyle, <b>you</b> <b>called</b> <b>this</b> meeting. We are waiting for {{what you have to}} say." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am glad," [...] said Waltheof, as {{they rode}} along, [...] "that <b>you</b> <b>called</b> <b>this</b> my earldom. I hold it to be mine of course, in right of my father; but the landsfolks, you know, gave it to your nephew Morcar." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not {{quite like}} that, are they--human ears? But I suppose <b>you</b> would <b>call</b> <b>this</b> symbolic. What, if I may ask, does it represent?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Improved!" [...] exclaimed M. Nioche, {{under his}} breath. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>this</b> improvement?" [...] And {{he glanced at}} the treasures in his arms.|$|E
6000|$|... "What do you mean?" [...] asked Mrs. Cliff. [...] "Don't <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>this</b> splendid {{house and}} {{everything}} in it a sign of sprouting and flourishing?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>this</b> just splendid?" [...] exclaimed Frank, as {{they rolled}} along over the crossing, past the bridge, toward the curve, {{a mile from}} the station.|$|E

6000|$|Pand. Nothing, do <b>you</b> <b>call</b> it! is that nothing, do <b>you</b> <b>call</b> that nothing? why he looks, {{for all the}} world, {{like one}} of your rascally malefactors, just thrown off the gibbet, with his cap down, his arms tied down, his feet sprunting, his body swinging. Nothing do <b>you</b> <b>call</b> it? <b>this</b> is nothing, with a vengeance! ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>You</b> may <b>call</b> <b>this</b> [...] "forum shopping" [...] if you please, but if {{the forum}} is England, {{it is a good}} place to shop in, both for the quality of the goods and the speed of service.|$|R
6000|$|... "I won't {{ask you if}} <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>this</b> FAIR to the boy, Mr. Twing?" [...] said Mrs. Martin hotly; [...] "but is {{this your}} idea of discipline?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>this</b> a 'little' I wouldn't {{like to be}} {{on board}} when you thought it was a regular gale," [...] Teddy said with a laugh.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mercy, if <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>this</b> stiff!" [...] Verena exclaimed, laughing, {{while at}} that moment Olive passed {{out of the house}} and descended the steps before her eyes.|$|E
60|$|<b>You</b> {{can only}} <b>call</b> <b>this,</b> {{in the most}} literal sense of the word, the brute-force of language.|$|R
6000|$|She {{led him to}} {{the little}} table. [...] "Now <b>you</b> mustn't <b>call</b> <b>this</b> breakfast," [...] she explained. [...] "This is a private cup of coffee to sustain us through the ordeal. We all breakfast {{immediately}} after the ceremony." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Spencer," [...] he said, [...] "my visit to-night {{is mainly}} to you. I dare {{say you are}} aware that a {{somewhat}} unpleasant thing has happened at my house. My people tell me that <b>you</b> <b>called</b> there <b>this</b> morning and inquired for Mr. Fielding." ...|$|R
6000|$|CHLOE. No. Don't go! [With a faint smile] You {{are playing}} a game with me. Aren't you ashamed? What harm have I done you? Do <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>this</b> cricket? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Aquiline!' cried Quilp, {{thrusting}} in his head, {{and striking}} the feature with his fist. 'Aquiline, you hag. Do you see it? Do <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>this</b> flat? Do you? Eh?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't you, by God! And {{what else}} do <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>this?</b> But as His Majesty's Deputy-Governor of Jamaica, I'll take leave to correct your mistake in my own way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your {{mother said}} <b>you</b> might <b>call</b> <b>this</b> the Bird Room. We caught a scarlet-tanager {{for you to}} begin with, didn't we, Jack?" [...] and Ralph threw a bon-bon at Jill, who looked very like a bright little bird in a warm nest.|$|R
6000|$|So far, very good; but pray, tell me, White-Jacket, how do {{you propose}} keeping out {{the rain and the}} wet in this quilted grego of yours? <b>You</b> don't <b>call</b> <b>this</b> wad of old patches a Mackintosh, do you?----you don't pretend to say that worsted is water-proof? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You don't tell him. I {{will tell}} him. I will inform him {{tomorrow}} that <b>you</b> <b>called</b> on me <b>this</b> afternoon and stole my watch and"--I glanced about the room--"my silver matchbox." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>this</b> nice?" [...] asked Tommy, pausing at last in {{a little}} dell where a noisy brook came {{tumbling}} down the mountain side, and the pines sung overhead.|$|E
6000|$|... "What do you want?" [...] {{demanded the}} other irritably, putting his hand behind him. [...] "What time o’ night do <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>this</b> for turning respectable {{men out of}} their beds?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My God, Professor!" [...] he cried. [...] "Are you mad? Can <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>this</b> thing 'child' and mourn over it {{when you}} {{do not yet know}} the fate of your own daughter?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Again the Duchess reflected. [...] "My dear, she's not an American and she's {{not on the}} stage. Aren't those what <b>you</b> <b>call</b> {{positions}} in <b>this</b> country? And she's also not a hundred." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Gentlemen," [...] he said, [...] "I {{call upon}} the Secretary, without further introduction, to read a letter, to {{consider}} which <b>you</b> are <b>called</b> together <b>this</b> day." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No. Do come in! I {{was only}} {{surprised}} to see you so late. I didn't know <b>you</b> paid <b>calls</b> at <b>this</b> hour. Is anything wrong? Come in." ...|$|R
40|$|Narrative by Junebug Clark: Photograph is from August 1972 and is shot near Lynchburg, Tennessee.

5000|$|As {{the police}} arrive at Dexter's house, he is {{obviously}} in shock and, either because he feels guilty that {{his relationship with}} the Trinity Killer, Arthur Mitchell, caused Rita's death or because he is answering a question ("Sir, did you say that <b>you</b> <b>called</b> <b>this</b> in?") asked by one of the police officers, admits [...] "it was me". Quinn is already suspicious about the circumstances surrounding Rita's death, considering it did not follow Trinity's modus operandi. He is also suspicious of Dexter's unemotional manner after the incident. Astor takes Rita's death particularly hard, and blames Dexter for it. Unable to reconcile, Astor decides that she wants to live with her grandparents in Orlando, Florida, and she and Cody leave Miami.|$|R
