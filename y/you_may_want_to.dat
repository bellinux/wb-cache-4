500|$|Soul Reavers {{dark and}} gothic {{atmosphere}} was generally well-received, and several publications praised the game's cut scenes. IGN's reviewer called it [...] "such an ambitious game - {{and one that}} achieves nearly everything it sets out to do - that few games come close to it", and praised the soundtrack for blending with the atmosphere unobtrusively. The Dreamcast port was cited as [...] "perhaps {{one of the best}} looking console games ever made". Next Generation Magazine echoed this, stating that, [...] "even if you own the PlayStation version, <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> rent this anyway", but expressed disappointment that no new features were added to the Dreamcast port. AllGame's reviewer called the cut scenes [...] "seamless", and their frequency neither too high nor too low. The game's storyline was praised by Game Informer as being [...] "grim and interesting". Soul Reavers voice acting was also highly praised; GameSpot ranked this aspect of the game in its list of top ten [...] "Best Voice Acting in Games". GameSpot also considered the atmosphere as rich as that of Blood Omen, yet less dramatically overstated, and considered the graphics [...] "among the best that have ever been on the PlayStation." ...|$|E
500|$|Although no {{materials}} {{appear to}} exist specifically addressing {{the composition of}} [...] "The Princess and the Pea", Andersen does speak to {{the writing of the}} first four tales of 1835 of which [...] "The Princess on the Pea" [...] is one. New Year's Day 1835, Andersen wrote to a friend: [...] "I am now starting on some 'fairy tales for children.' I am going to win over future generations, <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> know", and, in a letter dated February 1835 he wrote to the poet, Bernhard Severin Ingemann: [...] "I have started some 'Fairy Tales Told for Children' and believe I have succeeded. I have told a couple of tales which as a child I was happy about, and which I do not believe are known, and have written them exactly the way I would tell them to a child." [...] Andersen had finished the tales by March 1835 and told Admiral Wulff's daughter, Henriette: [...] "I have also written some fairy tales for children; Ørsted says about them that if The Improvisatore makes me famous then these will make me immortal, for they are the most perfect things I have written; but I myself do not think so." [...] On 26March, he observed that [...] " [...] will be published in April, and people will say: the work of my immortality! Of course I shan't enjoy the experience in this world." ...|$|E
500|$|Enio Chiola of PopMatters, {{included}} the song {{on his list}} of [...] "Top 15 Madonna Singles of All Time". He opined that [...] " [...] features a more demure Madonna, confident in her termination of a doomed relationship, and the music is accented by characteristically Asian orchestration and lovely poetic lyrics", concluding that [...] " [...] quickly learned that the {{way back into the}} public's collective hearts was to focus more attention on the music than on the frankness of her sexual image". In his 2011 review of Bedtime Stories, Brett Callwood of the Detroit Metro Times called the song [...] "spectacular". NPR Multimedia senior producer Keith Jenkins gave a positive review of the song, stating that it [...] "washes over you and gets your blood boiling. You may not walk on water after hearing it, but <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> get your focus back by walking on broken glass". Louis Virtel, from TheBacklot.com, placed [...] "Take a Bow" [...] at number 27 of his list [...] "The 100 Greatest Madonna Songs". He wrote; [...] "Madonna's most successful single to date is a melancholic evisceration of a lover's artifice, and its hopeless plain-spokenness makes it one of the finest examples of 90s balladry". Rikky Rooksby, author of The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, was less impressed with the track. Although he felt that it sounded [...] "shockingly normal" [...] after the [...] "ambient 'Bedtime Story'", he found the song's length as over-long and deduced it to be [...] "communica no sense whatsoever of the pain of a real goodbye." ...|$|E

2500|$|Game Revolution {{scored the}} Wii version a C-, criticising the {{narrative}} {{style and the}} responsiveness of the Wii Remote.

She carried matters so far that she is at present with your Cousin Alice {{at the house of}} her parents at Basingstoke. Having read your letter, I write to tell you that I feel that I am not without blame toward you. I did not see it myself until the manner of your letter opened my eyes to the fact. I have misunderstood you, and, being bent on carrying out my own inclinations, made not enough allowance for yours. Were you here now I doubt not that in future we should get on better together; but as that cannot be, I can only say that I recognize the kind spirit in which you wrote, and that I trust that in future we shall be good friends. I inclose you an order for five guineas on a tradesman in Dover with whom I have dealings. There are many little things that <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> buy for your voyage to supplement the pay which you receive. Andrew Carson is leaving my service.

6000|$|The general {{size of a}} {{store in}} Tangier is about that of an {{ordinary}} shower bath in a civilized land. The Muhammadan merchant, tinman, shoemaker, or vendor of trifles sits {{cross-legged on the floor}} and reaches after any article <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> buy. You can rent a whole block of these pigeonholes for fifty dollars a month. The market people crowd the marketplace with their baskets of figs, dates, melons, apricots, etc., and among them file trains of laden asses, not much larger, if any, than a Newfoundland dog. The scene is lively, is picturesque, and smells like a police court. The Jewish money-changers have their dens close at hand, and all day long are counting bronze coins and transferring them from one bushel basket to another. They don't coin much money nowadays, I think. I saw none but what was dated four or five hundred years back, and was badly worn and battered. These coins are not very valuable. Jack went out to get a napoleon changed, so as to have money suited to the general cheapness of things, and came back and said he had [...] "swamped the bank, had bought eleven quarts of coin, {{and the head of the}} firm had gone on the street to negotiate for the balance of the change."

6000|$|... "Don't {{get into}} the way of waiting too long before you fire, Tom," [...] Pete Hoskings said. [...] "Better to try to shoot too quick to begin with than to be too long about it. When you have made up your mind {{that you are going}} to shoot, get your bead on your mark and fire at once. <b>You</b> <b>may</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> hit a red-skin's head as he looks out from behind a tree, and to do that you must fire the instant you see him or he will be in again. One of the best shots I ever saw never used to raise his gun to his {{shoulder}} at all. He just dropped his piece into the hollow of his left hand, and would fire as he touched it. He did not seem to take any aim at all, but his bullet was sartin to hit the thing he wanted to, even if it were no bigger than an orange. He could not tell himself how he did it. 'I seen the thing and I fired, Pete,' he would say; 'the gun seems to point right of its own accord, I have not anything to say to it.' You see, shooting is a matter of eye. Some men may shoot all their lives, and they will never be more than just respectable, while others shoot well the first time that a gun is put in their hands. Want of nerve is what spoils half men's shooting; that and taking too long an aim. Well, it is time for us to be mounting and getting back. I have got to see that the dinner is all ready. I never can trust that black scoundrel, Sam, to do things right while I am away." ...|$|E

"For the present," [...] he went on, [...] "I {{shall have}} no great {{need for an}} interpreter, as I shall {{probably}} {{have little to do}} for some time beyond cruising backwards and forwards on the coast of Egypt to prevent ships from France entering the ports with stores and ammunition, therefore I shall be able to give you employment which I think that you will like. One of the gun-boats captured from the French is a fast sailer. Hassan Bey tells me that when he was at Rhodes he heard great complaints of the piracy that was being carried on among the islands. The Turkish troops in most of these were withdrawn by him to swell his force as he sailed south, and there are now no vessels of war in those waters. The French flag has been driven from the sea, while our work has been too serious to admit of our paying any attention to the Aegean, although, as I knew before I left London, the complaints of merchants and ship-owners of the capture of merchantmen trading with Constantinople and other eastern ports were numerous. At the present moment I can well spare one of the gun-boats; the others will go down to watch the Egyptian coast. I shall therefore commission the Foudre, and re-name her the Tigress. I shall appoint Mr. Wilkinson to the command. Mr. Condor would, of course, have had it, but he has been transferred as third lieutenant to the Theseus, and as Wilkinson is senior midshipman, he will have her. I shall appoint you his second in command. She carries eight guns, and has room for two more, which I shall place on board from those on the walls. Her own guns are fourteen-pounders, and with two eighteens she will be heavily armed. Her complement was fifty-two men. I will give you forty from the Tigre, and will draw fifteen from the Theseus, and five from the Alliance. You will need a stronger crew with two extra guns; besides, <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> send landing-parties on shore, or to cut out piratical craft, and ought therefore to be strong-handed." ...|$|E
