During a three-week tour of Japan in 1975, the trumpeter performed two concerts at the Festival Hall in Osaka on February 1; the afternoon show produced Agharta and the evening show was released as Pangaea the following year.|$|E

5|$|The Avianca Flight 52 {{aircraft}} was a Boeing 707-321B (registration number HK-2016). The {{aircraft was}} manufactured in June 1967 and {{was purchased by}} Avianca from Pan Am in 1977.

The 707 was equipped with four JT3D-3B engines modified with a hush kit to reduce noise pollution. Avianca personnel reported that they factored in a five-percent fuel overburn into the performance calculations due to the hush kit along with an additional five-percent overburn due to the age of the aircraft. Additionally, maintenance crews had noted recurring issues with the aircraft's autopilot, including the altitude hold function.|$|E

During their 1945 annual conference, the ACLU leaders composed a list of important civil rights issues to focus on in the future, and the list included racial discrimination and separation of church and state.|$|E
5|$|Charles Ssekyaaya participated on Uganda's behalf in the men's 62 {{kilogram}} weightlifting discipline. He was 18 <b>years</b> <b>old</b> <b>and</b> <b>had</b> not {{participated in}} any previous Olympic Games. Ssekyaaya {{qualified for the}} Games after receiving a wildcard from the International Weightlifting Federation after achieving a 28th-place finish in the Africa Olympic Qualifiers. His event took place on 31 July, and included 14 athletes in total. During the event's snatch phase, Ssekyaaya was given three attempts. He successfully attempted to lift over 90 kilograms of weight {{in his first two}} attempts, but did not achieve this objective on the third attempt. Ssekyaaya then attempted 130 kilograms during the clean and jerk phrase of the event, successfully lifting it on his first attempt. He did not succeed in lifting 135 kilograms on his second attempt, or 140 on his third. Overall, the combination of Ssekyaaya's highest scores in snatch (105) and clean and jerk (130) yielded a score of 235 points.

Ssekyaaya was 92 points behind the gold medallist Kim Un-guk from North Korea.|$|E
5|$|Edwin Ekiring was {{the sole}} {{representative}} for Uganda in the men's singles for Badminton. He was 28 <b>years</b> <b>old</b> <b>and</b> <b>had</b> competed in the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.

He said that his experiences in previous Olympic Games would aid him in progressing up the world rankings. On 28 July, Ekiring played against Brice Leverdez of France in the group stage, whom he lost against {{in the first round}} 12–21 and was defeated by his opponment 11–21 in the second round in a 26-minute match.

5|$|The novel Soon I Will Be Invincible is {{the first}} novel by Austin Grossman, an {{established}} video games designer. Grossman {{had come from a}} literary family, son of Judith and Allen Grossman and brother of Lev Grossman, which had fostered his ambition to write his own novel. Instead, Grossman accepted a job working in the video game medium which he credited with teaching him to realistically portray creative characters and situations. He always had an interest in the superhero genre, citing Alan Moore and Frank Miller as literary influences. In the mid-1990s, the idea behind what would become his first novel came to him {{in the form of a}} supervillain's voice. Grossman spent the next few years casually developing the character that would become Dr. Impossible, adding supporting characters, and writing short stories. By 2006, Penguin's imprint Michael Joseph purchased the publishing rights for the UK, as did Rizzoli for an Italian version. By the time, the book was being published Grossman was 37 <b>years</b> <b>old</b> <b>and</b> <b>had</b> entered the University of California-Berkeley's doctoral program studying English Literature, specializing in Romantic and Victorian literature.|$|E
5|$|While not {{the largest}} operation, Smythe's horses won 145 stakes races during his lifetime, a record {{second only to}} E. P. Taylor in Canada. Smythe's stable won the Queen's Plate twice, the first in 1958 with Caledon Beau and the second in 1967 with Jammed Lovely. In 1973, Smythe became a {{founding}} member of the Jockey Club of Canada. In 1977, he was inducted in the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame. After his death, the Smythe stable was sold in 1981 to Gardiner Farms and Harlequin Ranches, for an estimated $2.5million. Smythe's will gave the racing stable to the Conn Smythe Foundation, which as a charitable foundation, could not run a business. The new owners leased back the farm and stables. The only horse not in the sale was Jammed Lucky, Smythe's favourite, which was given to Smythe's grandson Tommy. Jammed Lucky was 23 <b>years</b> <b>old</b> <b>and</b> <b>had</b> sired 25 winning foals to that point.|$|E
