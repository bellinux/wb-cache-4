25|$|After {{a year-long}} hiatus, TVXQ {{returned}} as a duo with remaining members Yunho and Changmin. They released TVXQ's fifth Korean album Keep <b>Your</b> <b>Head</b> <b>Down</b> (2011), topping album charts in most major Asian markets upon release. Their first two Japanese albums as a duo, Tone (2011) and Time (2013), solidified {{their success in}} Japan as it forged TVXQ's {{reputation as one of}} the top-touring artists in the country. Their eighth Japanese album With (2014) made TVXQ the first and only foreign music act in Japan to have four number-one albums in a row.|$|E
500|$|Beatles biographer Bob Spitz {{described}} Starkey's upbringing as [...] "a Dickensian {{chronicle of}} misfortune". Houses {{in the area}} were [...] "poorly ventilated, postage-stamp-sized ... patched together by crumbling plaster walls, with a rear door that opened onto an outhouse." [...] Crawford commented: [...] "Like all of the families {{who lived in the}} Dingle, he was part of an ongoing struggle to survive." [...] The children who lived there spent much of their time at Princes Park, escaping the soot-filled air of their coal-fuelled neighbourhood. Adding to their difficult circumstances, violent crime was an almost constant concern for people living in {{one of the oldest and}} poorest inner-city districts in Liverpool. Starkey later commented: [...] "You kept <b>your</b> <b>head</b> <b>down,</b> your eyes open, and you didn't get in anybody's way." ...|$|E
500|$|In December 1997, Southall went to Alvin Martin's Southend United of the Second Division on loan. He made 9 {{appearances}} {{in a brief}} stay at Roots Hall. He joined Chris Kamara's First Division Stoke City in February 1998. Kamara resigned two months later, and caretaker-manager Alan Durban pulled Southall aside {{on his first day}} in charge to say [...] "I'll let you manage the reserves, so long as you keep <b>your</b> <b>head</b> <b>down,</b> do whatever I tell you, and I won't tell everybody you're a bad influence". Southall was shocked by Durban's words and could not explain his attitude. Both Southend and Stoke would end the season bottom of their respective divisions and Everton only avoided relegation {{on the last day of}} the season. He left the Britannia Stadium in the summer, and later said [...] "one of the worst episodes of my life had drawn to a close".|$|E

500|$|Shane Rangi as Asterius the Minotaur and Josh Campbell as {{the voice}} of Asterius. An elderly minotaur who aids Caspian. He is killed during the raid while holding the gate open to allow some of the army to escape. Rangi also stood in for Aslan, the Bulgy Bear, the Werewolf, another Minotaur, and the Wild Bear on set. Rangi played General Otmin in the {{previous}} film and Tavros in The Voyage of The Dawn Treader. He was able to see more in the redesigned animatronic minotaur heads, though [...] "in order to make the eye line straight and correct, you've actually got to hold <b>your</b> <b>head</b> <b>down,</b> so your view is only about {{a foot and a half}} in front of you, which still makes it a little bit hard". This resulted in Rangi knocking himself against the rising gate of the Telmarine castle, although he was fine and it was the animatronic head that bore the brunt of the damage. The costumes were still very hot, reducing him to a [...] "walking waterfall". Although a head sculpt of Aslan was used to stand in for the character on the first film, Rangi had to portray the character on set because Lucy interacts with him more. Rangi lost four kilograms wearing all his costumes.|$|E
2500|$|Yunho and Changmin {{released}} TVXQ's comeback Korean album Keep <b>Your</b> <b>Head</b> <b>Down</b> on January 5, 2011. The album debuted {{at number}} one on the Gaon Albums Chart, and maintained its position for a second week. With 230,922 copies sold by mid-2011, Keep <b>Your</b> <b>Head</b> <b>Down</b> won the Album of the Year for the first quarter of 2011 at the Gaon Chart K-Pop Awards. The album's title single, [...] "Keep Your Head Down" [...] also stayed strong on the charts, winning seven number-one trophies on music shows The Music Trend, Music Bank, and M! Countdown. The Japanese version [...] "Keep Your Head Down", which was released as a physical single in Japan on January 26, 2011, was a chart-topper and became TVXQ's second best-selling single in Japan, earning a platinum certification by the RIAJ. In March 2011, Keep <b>Your</b> <b>Head</b> <b>Down</b> was reissued with a new single, [...] "Before U Go", and the repackaged album Before U Go peaked at number nine on the Gaon, pushing the album to be the third best-selling record of 2011 in South Korea.|$|E
2500|$|While {{promoting}} Keep <b>Your</b> <b>Head</b> <b>Down,</b> Yunho and Changmin {{spoke up}} for the first time about their 2010 hiatus and breakup with JYJ. According to Yunho, JYJ had [...] "exceedingly deep conflicts" [...] with their agency and the members had irreconcilable differences about their career. Changmin added that the team had worked so hard {{to the point where they}} felt like they could finally [...] "harvest the fruits of [...] labor", yet instead of being happy they had to perform their final stage with heavy hearts. JYJ responded by saying that they did not regret their decision in leaving S.M. Entertainment. The lyrics of [...] "Keep Your Head Down" [...] also came under media scrutiny, with claims that they were directed at JYJ; however, TVXQ clarified that [...] "Keep Your Head Down" [...] was not a diss track, and that similar claims would still happen even if they were to release a different song with different lyrics. Yunho said, [...] "The song is about a man's mind towards a woman who had left him. We can sometimes find out that a certain song seems to talk about my own story. In this way it totally depends on the interpretation using our own thoughts." ...|$|E

5000|$|Automatic weapons, {{especially}} belt-fed, crew-served machine guns, {{can be used}} {{to deliver}} a high volume of fire at enemy positions. A history of German military doctrine states that [...] "...laying down saturation fire small arms will keep <b>your</b> enemy's <b>head</b> <b>down</b> while allowing you {{to get on with the}} approach to the objective. During the Vietnam War, AC-130 aircraft incorporated side-firing 20 mm Gatling-style cannons which allowed them to provide area-saturation fire as the aircraft circled over a target. Another use of saturation fire in the Vietnam War was with [...] "guntrucks" [...] in convoys. These [...] "2-ton cargo vehicles" [...] with [...] "two M-60 machine gunners" [...] would [...] "... provide a rapid, retaliatory saturation fire within the critical first 3 minutes of an enemy attack an ambush of the convoy".|$|R

60|$|After the {{arrangement}} of goods and chattels, came dinner (the curry warmed up with a second course of fried onions)--then the slinging of our hammocks by the neat hands of the Brothers Dobbs--and then the practice {{of how to get}} into the hammocks, by Messrs. Migott and Jollins. No landsman who has not tried the experiment can form the faintest notion of the luxury of the sailor's swinging bed, or of the extraordinary difficulty of getting into it for the first time. The preliminary action is to stand with your back against the middle of your hammock, and to hold by the edge of the canvas on either side. You then duck <b>your</b> <b>head</b> <b>down,</b> throw your heels up, turn round on your back, and let go with your hands, all at the same moment. If you succeed in doing this, you are in the most luxurious bed that the ingenuity of man has ever invented. If you fail, you measure your length on the floor. So much for hammocks.|$|E

"Punch," [...] said {{my father}} to me one day--he called me Punch because in early life I had a squeaky voice and a jerky manner--"Punch, my boy, get into a habit of looking up, if you can, as you trot along through this world. If you keep <b>your</b> <b>head</b> <b>down</b> and {{your eyes on the}} ground, you'll see nothing of what's going on around you--consequently you'll know nothing; moreover, you'll get a bad habit of turning your eyes inward and always {{thinking}} only about yourself and your own affairs, which means being selfish. Besides, you'll run a chance of growing absent-minded, and won't see danger approaching; so that you'll tumble over things and damage your shins, and tumble into things and damage your clothes, and tumble off things and damage your carcase, and get run over by wheels, and poked in the back by carriage-poles, and killed by trains, and spiflicated in various ways--all of which evils are to be avoided by looking up and looking round, and taking note of what you see, as you go along the track of life--d'ye see?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Like Ham's {{previous}} two novel, this novel is also set in rural Australia. The {{setting of the}} novel is 500 metres away from her home in Brunswick, Victoria and the house her protagonist Margery has in the novel, is real about which Ham said, [...] "I pass it four or five times a week walking my dog.’ It is one of those un-renovated opportunities that the real estate agent son-in-law in the novel paws so covetously: ‘a detached, two-bedroom weatherboard cottage with kitchen and bathroom tacked into the back and outdoor lavatories’. Ham took a photo of the house down the road so she could physically map the landscape her characters inhabited. ‘If it’s true and it’s real, it comes out of <b>your</b> <b>head</b> and <b>down</b> <b>your</b> arms and onto the page. There’s the park and the pub and Sydney Road and Union Square - it’s easy to map their progress. They covered a huge terrain by going not very far." ...|$|R

Mercedes chief Toto Wolff reacted furiously, telling his rivals to [...] "get <b>your</b> fucking <b>head</b> <b>down</b> and work to sort it out", but later {{made it clear that he}} [...] "didn't mean the f-word in relation to him" [...] regarding the comments by Christian Horner. Nico Rosberg voiced hopes that their rivals would get closer over the course of the season, saying during the post-race press conference: [...] "I hope we can have a good fight. That would be awesome." [...] This statement caused amusement from Sebastian Vettel, who replied: [...] "Be honest. Do you really hope so? Seriously? You finished 30 seconds ahead of us and you hope it's going to be closer? So you hope you slow down? Is that what you're saying?" ...|$|R
6000|$|So I must own that, {{without much}} repining, on the {{contrary}} with something akin to gratitude, Amelia took the crumbs that her father-in-law let drop now and then, and with them fed her own parent. Directly she understood it to be her duty, it was this young woman's nature (ladies, she is but thirty still, and we choose to call her a young woman even at that age) it was, I say, her nature to sacrifice herself and to fling all that she had {{at the feet of}} the beloved object. During what long thankless nights had she worked out her fingers for little Georgy whilst at home with her; what buffets, scorns, privations, poverties had she endured for father and mother! And in the midst of all these solitary resignations and unseen sacrifices, she did not respect herself any more than the world respected her, but I believe thought in her heart that she was a poor-spirited, despicable little creature, whose luck in life was only too good for her merits. O you poor women! O you poor secret martyrs and victims, whose life is a torture, who are stretched on racks in your bedrooms, and who lay <b>your</b> <b>heads</b> <b>down</b> on the block daily at the drawing-room table; every man who watches your pains, or peers into those dark places where the torture is administered to you, must pity you--and--and thank God that he has a beard. I recollect seeing, years ago, at the prisons for idiots and madmen at Bicetre, near Paris, a poor wretch bent down under the bondage of his imprisonment and his personal infirmity, to whom one of our party gave a halfpenny worth of snuff in a cornet or [...] "screw" [...] of paper. The kindness was too much for the poor epileptic creature. He cried in an anguish of delight and gratitude: if anybody gave you and me a thousand a year, or saved our lives, we could not be so affected. And so, if you properly tyrannize over a woman, you will find a h'p'orth of kindness act upon her and bring tears into her eyes, as though you were an angel benefiting her.|$|R
