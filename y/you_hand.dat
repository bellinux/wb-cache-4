500|$|An Albanian account {{describes}} the dispute as follows: [...] "By violating the formal Albanian-Soviet agreements signed in September 1957 an May 1959, the Soviet government did {{everything in its}} power to put under its control this Albanian base which {{at the same time}} served the defence of the socialist countries... On April 5, 1961, in a letter addressed to the governments of the Soviet Union and the East-European states it resolutely reaffirmed that it accepted only one solution of the problem: the base of Vlora belonged to Albania and all the naval means that were its property should be handed over to Albanian crew as soon as possible. Any other solution was an act which would lead to the unilateral violation {{on the part of the}} Soviet Union of the existing Albanian-Soviet agreements of the years 1957 and 1959." [...] In May 1961 the Soviets began dismantling the base and tried to seize the submarines, seizing some Albanian ships undergoing repairs at Sevastopol in the process. As the Albanian account describes it, [...] "The Soviet sailors and officers carried out numerous provocations, trying by all manner of means to create a pretext for the Soviet military intervention in Albania... On May 26, 1961 it seized in a demonstrative manner 8 submarines, the floating base 'Kotelnikov', as well as the Albanian warships that were laid for repair in the port of Sevastopol. On June 5, 1961 the personnel of Soviet advisers left the base at Vlora, too." [...] Hoxha's account is as follows: Admiral Vladimir Kasatonov of the Black Sea fleet [...] "came to Tirana with the mission of seizing not only the eight submarines... but even the submarines which we had taken over earlier. We told him bluntly: Either <b>you</b> <b>hand</b> the submarines over to us according to the agreement, or within a short time (we set the date) you must withdraw immediately from the bay... He did not hand over the submarines, but went to Vlora, boarded the command submarine and lined up the others in fighting formation. We gave orders to close the Sazan Narrows and to train the guns on the Soviet ships. Admiral Kasatonov, who had wanted to frighten us, was frightened himself. He was caught like a rat in a trap and if he attempted to implement his plan he might find himself at the bottom of the sea. In these conditions the admiral was obliged to take only the submarines with Soviet crews, and he sailed out of the bay back home with his tail between his legs." ...|$|E

2500|$|As soon as {{the victory}} of the Popular Front in the {{elections}} became known I, already an elect member of Parliament, showed up at the prison of Oviedo the next morning, went {{to the office of the}} Director, who had fled in a mad panic because he had behaved like a genuine criminal toward the Asturian prisoners interned after the revolution of October 1934, and there I found the Administrator to whom I said, [...] "Give me the keys because the prisoners must be released this very day." [...] He replied, [...] "I have not received any orders", and I answered, [...] "I am a member of the Republic's Parliament, and I demand that <b>you</b> <b>hand</b> over the keys immediately to set the prisoners free." [...] He handed them over and I assure you that it was the most thrilling day of my activist life, opening the cells and shouting, [...] "Comrades, everyone get out!" [...] Truly thrilling. I did not wait for Parliament to sit or for the release order to be given. I reasoned, [...] "We have run on the promise of freedom for the prisoners of the revolution of 1934—we won—today the prisoners go free." ...|$|E

2500|$|In February 2004, NBC {{executive}} Marc Graboff informed Ross of the conversations, and he in turn ran {{the idea}} of waiting four more years to O'Brien, who was immediately receptive. Zucker, along with top late-night executive Rick Ludwin, met with Leno in March at his Burbank studio to discuss the contract extension, and explained the network's stance on handing over the show to O'Brien. While Leno quietly felt both disappointed and befuddled, he noted {{he did not want}} to see himself and O'Brien go through the same dilemma he and Letterman faced twelve years earlier, and agreed to the plans. His only request was that NBC wait to announce O'Brien's installment as host well after the extension, to which the executives agreed. While Leno handled the news professionally (to Zucker's relief), he soon headed to Tonight Show producer Debbie Vickers' office to let her know he felt as if he had just been fired. NBC's announcement of the renewal inevitably led to press speculation on O'Brien's fate; to that end, O'Brien and his team went with the charade, peppering interviews with unclear, vague statements on his future. On September 27, 2004, O'Brien officially signed on to become the next host of The Tonight Show; NBC allowed the first comment aside from the press release to come from Leno on that night's show. [...] "'Cause this, you know, this show is like a dynasty,” Leno said. “You hold it, and then <b>you</b> <b>hand</b> it off to the next person. And I don’t want to see all the fighting and all the 'Who’s better?' and nasty things back and forth in the press. So right now, here it is—Conan, it's yours! See you in five years, buddy!" ...|$|E
