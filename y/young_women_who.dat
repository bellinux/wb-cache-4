5|$|After {{a newborn}} baby rapidly ages into an 80-year-old man, Fringe {{division}} agent Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) and consultants Peter (Joshua Jackson) and Walter Bishop (John Noble) investigate. They tie {{the case to the}} murders of <b>young</b> <b>women,</b> <b>who</b> have all had their pituitary glands removed. It is revealed that Dr. Claus Penrose (Mark Blum), an expert in progeria, is working to help his son Christopher (Derek Cecil) stay alive, as he suffers from rapid aging syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Green {{today is}} not {{commonly}} associated in Europe and the United States with love and sexuality, but in stories of the medieval period it sometimes represented love and the base, natural desires of man. It {{was the color of}} the serpent in the Garden of Eden who caused the downfall of Adam and Eve. However, for the troubadours, green was the color of growing love, and light green clothing was reserved for <b>young</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> were not yet married.|$|E
5|$|Heine's prose {{passage in}} De l'Allemagne tells of supernatural young women called the Wilis. They have died before their wedding day and rise from their graves {{in the middle}} of the night to dance. Any young man who crosses their path is forced to dance to his death. In another book, the Wilis are said to be jilted <b>young</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> have died and become vampires. This is assumed to be the reason that they hate men.|$|E

5|$|In 2010, the United Nations {{launched}} the Every Woman Every Child movement {{to assess the}} progress toward meeting women's contraceptive needs. The initiative has {{set a goal of}} increasing the number of users of modern birth control by 120 million women in the world's 69 poorest countries by the year 2020. Additionally, they aim to eradicate discrimination against girls and <b>young</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> seek contraceptives. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommended in 2014 that oral birth control pills should be over the counter medications.|$|E
5|$|A capable preacher, though {{doubtful}} of {{his ability}} when preaching to a non-academic congregation, Chadwick was well regarded as a lecturer and companion at High Table. However, a natural shyness could give him a rather remote air. On an American lecture tour, he noticed three <b>young</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> came to every lecture, but took no notes. At the end of lectures he asked the women how they had enjoyed them, {{to be told that}} they had no real interest in the subject itself, but they loved to hear him speak. The character of the college provost in the A Staircase in Surrey novels of Christ Church colleague J. I. M. Stewart was based on that of Chadwick.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of July 18, 1969, Kennedy was at Chappaquiddick Island on {{the eastern end of}} Martha's Vineyard. He was hosting a party that he gave for the Boiler Room Girls, a group of <b>young</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> had worked on his brother Robert's ill-fated presidential {{campaign}} the year before. Kennedy left the party with one of the women, 28-year-old Mary Jo Kopechne. Driving a 1967 Oldsmobile Delmont 88, he attempted to cross the Dike Bridge (which did not have a guardrail at that time). Kennedy lost control of his vehicle and crashed in the Poucha Pond inlet, which was a tidal channel on Chappaquiddick Island. Kennedy escaped the overturned vehicle, and, by his description, dove below the surface seven or eight times, vainly attempting to reach and rescue Kopechne. Ultimately, he swam to shore and left the scene, with Kopechne still trapped inside the vehicle. He contacted authorities the next morning, but Kopechne's body had already been discovered.|$|E

5|$|Thorpe's {{interests}} in fashion and culture {{led him to}} make frequent visits to New York City—which he describes as a second home—often for engagements with Armani and particularly because of the city's status as a global fashion capital. He {{was present at the}} World Trade Center on the morning of 11 September 2001, having stopped there on his jog, before returning to his hotel after forgetting his camera. It was during this trip that he appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, which was notable because of the relative lack of interest in competitive swimming in America. Thorpe later became a spokesperson for the unsuccessful New York bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics, even promising to continue his career until the games if New York won the hosting rights. Thorpe's interests have also seen him involved in television. In 2002, he played the lead role in the reality television show Undercover Angels, which imitated the Charlie's Angels series. In the program, Thorpe directed three <b>young</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> performed good deeds for people in need. Although it averaged more than a million viewers per episode, it was widely panned by critics. Thorpe has also appeared as an extra in the American sitcom Friends.|$|E
