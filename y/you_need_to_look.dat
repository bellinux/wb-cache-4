500|$|The Warriors saw Lin as a {{potential}} backup for Curry. Lacob said the team received more than one trade offer for Lin {{while he was in}} the D-League, but he was happy with Lin's progress as an undrafted free agent. [...] "He's a minimum, inexpensive asset. <b>You</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at him as a developing asset. Is he going to be a superstar? No." [...] He finished his rookie NBA season averaging 2.6points on 38.9percent shooting in 29games.|$|E
500|$|Season two {{is set in}} 1947, {{approximately}} {{six months}} to a year following the events of the first, with the time jump made to show [...] "people are in a little bit different positions, and things have happened between these seasons that we maybe don't know about." [...] Fazekas noted that [...] "the challenge" [...] for the season was to find a way to reunite Carter with Edwin Jarvis since he is [...] "not an agent....that's a really important relationship, how do we keep them together?...The nice thing about Peggy this season is she's not having to hide her agenda from the SSR. [...] is helping her out, just in a different way." [...] Elaborating on the SSR's role in the season, Fazekas explained that when Markus and McFeely created the organisation for [...] it was inspired by the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), which was [...] "somewhat disbanded after the war, because it was created because of World War II. So now that the war is over, things are changing. And in real history, the OSS sort of became the CIA and some of its other functions went under other departments. There's a little bit of change going on within SSR and so Thompson [...] has a boss [...] that's going to be saying, [...] "Look, things are changing, and <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> out for yourself."" [...] The season also sees Daniel Sousa promoted to the chief of the Los Angeles SSR office.|$|E
500|$|The Houston Chronicles Joey Guerra {{felt all}} of the album's tracks were strong, and wrote [...] "Every track plays like a {{potential}} hit single, and that's exactly what fans will love about 'E=MC²'. Expect it to soundtrack much of the summer and beyond." [...] Los Angeles Times staff writer, Richard Cromelin, gave the album two out of four stars, noting its [...] "alternatives to the glass-shattering flamboyance of her early '90s youth." [...] He concluded in his mixed review of the album, [...] "Of course, consistency isn't so important when an album is assembled {{as a series of}} singles rather than a cohesive work. Fortunately for Carey, the tabloid-tailored real-life back story {{on one side and the}} producer's craft on the other matter more than the art of singing in this particular fairy tale." [...] Ben Ratliff of The New York Times felt the album didn't level up to par with Carey's previous release, writing [...] "Much of the record sounds like urban-radio imitations, without the peculiarities and effective hooks of 'Mimi'. Maybe emancipation isn't a continuing procedure; maybe it only comes once." [...] Writing for PopMatters, Evan Sawdey rated E=MC² four out of ten discs, describing it as a [...] "shallow imitation of its predecessor". Sawdey concluded his review on a mixed note, stating [...] " [...] the second act of Mariah's comeback doesn't wisely expand her sound: it instead succumbs to the blueprint so carefully laid out by its predecessor, a pointless remake that exists only because it has to. If you ever had a doubt as to its formulaic nature, <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> no further than its title. Long live the Diva." [...] Caryn Ganz from Rolling Stone questioned why she limited her vocal abilities throughout the record, [...] "nearly every song confines Carey to four-note verses, offering little room for her glorious range." [...] Journalist Eric Henderson, writing for Slant Magazine, graded the album three out of five stars, and concluding with, [...] "Such are the rewards of an album like 'E=MC²', in which one does reach a solution, but not before Mariah bends over backward to show her work." [...] The album finished in the top-ten of several [...] "best of 2008" [...] lists, ending at number four on an official poll held by Billboard, eight by The Detroit News, and number ten by The San Diego Union-Tribune. Robert Christgau picked out one song from the album, [...] "Touch My Body", as a [...] "choice cut" [...] (...) [...]|$|E
