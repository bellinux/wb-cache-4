500|$|Writing for the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, Matt Rush, who had {{attended}} the concert in July, {{noted that the}} original concert was much longer than the broadcast, due to the time taken by Gaga for changing her costumes. Rush complimented Bennett's performance saying [...] "At 88, the remarkable Tony Bennett ... can still deliver the goods, and his solo rendition of 'How Do <b>You</b> <b>Keep</b> <b>the</b> Music Playing?' is the soaring highlight of [...] Bennett's rapport with Gaga seems genuine, {{and they have a}} sweet, unforced musical chemistry in these selections from their current album of standards." [...] Brad Oswald from the Winnipeg Free Press was impressed by the duos vocal delivery, saying that [...] "the 88-year-old crooner and the 28-year-old pop diva meld voices seamlessly as they serve up swinging duet versions of such standards". New York Daily News TV Critic David Hinckley, who awarded the concert with four out of five stars, was surprised by Lady Gaga being a [...] "multifaceted singer, not just a dance diva" [...] and stated that Gaga handled the fashion side of the event. He finished the review [...] declaring [...] "The singing in general is solid. Bennett can still hit some remarkable notes, and more important, he understands the songs." ...|$|E
500|$|However, the {{commonly}} reported {{statement that the}} action scenes are continuous shots is not entirely true. [...] Visual effects supervisor Frazer Churchill explains that the effects team had to [...] "combine several takes to create impossibly long shots", where their job was to [...] "create {{the illusion of a}} continuous camera move." [...] Once the team was able to create a [...] "seamless blend", they would {{move on to the next}} shot. [...] These techniques were important for three continuous shots: the coffee shop explosion in the opening shot, the car ambush, and the battlefield scene. [...] The coffee shop scene was composed of [...] "two different takes shot over two consecutive days"; the car ambush was shot in [...] "six sections and at four different locations over one week and required five seamless digital transitions"; and the battlefield scene [...] "was captured in five separate takes over two locations". Churchill and the Double Negative team created over 160 of these types of effects for the film. [...] In an interview with Variety, Cuarón acknowledged this nature of the [...] "single-shot" [...] action sequences: [...] "Maybe I'm spilling a big secret, but sometimes it's more than what it looks like. The important thing is how you blend everything and how <b>you</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> perception of a fluid choreography through all of these different pieces." ...|$|E

The concert {{started with}} Bennett and Gaga appearing before {{the crowd and}} singing [...] "Anything Goes", then {{moving on to the}} title track, [...] "Cheek to Cheek". A costume change ensues, and Gaga and Bennett appear on stage to sing [...] "Nature Boy". Bennett continues with [...] "How Do <b>You</b> <b>Keep</b> <b>the</b> Music Playing?" [...] following which Gaga appears on stage in Menkes' red jumpsuit and a big wig to sing her solo rendition of [...] "Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)". Following a standing ovation, the duo come together to perform the Billy Strayhorn penned [...] "Firefly" [...] and Gaga disappears for a third costume change. She appears in Vogels' crown hat and a Valentino gown and together they sing [...] "I Won't Dance" [...] and [...] "I Can't Give You Anything but Love", wearing Cavalli. Gaga stays on stage for solo rendition of [...] "Lush Life", followed by Bennett with his solo performance of [...] "Sophisticated Lady". After another costume change, the duo sing [...] "Let's Face the Music and Dance" [...] and [...] "But Beautiful". The final performance is aided by the full band and dancers, as they sing [...] "It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)". After taking a bow, Bennett and Gaga disappear behind the curtains.|$|E

2500|$|Oscar Leroy (Eric Peterson) is Brent's grouchy, stubborn, {{occasionally}} senile elderly-stereotype father, {{the retired}} former owner of Corner Gas. His all-purpose word is [...] "jackass"; {{during the course}} of the series, he says it over 1,000 times. He says it at least once in every episode with the exception of the first episode, [...] "Ruby Reborn".(It is also the series's final spoken word.) He often demands that the Dog River police arrest everyone who annoys him. He frequently, belligerently, points out to government workers: [...] "My taxes pay your salary!" [...] He tends to exclaim [...] "Holy hell!" [...] on encountering new or surprising things. He rivals Hank in his brain capacity and ability to make mistakes and the two are often shown scheming together. Oscar likes to show his handiwork around the house, but usually makes things worse when he tries to fix things. When Brent suggested selling Corner Gas to a huge company, Oscar replied [...] "How dare you - how dare <b>you</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> Pump and Go people waiting, sell it, sell it now!", showing he didn't love his old job.|$|E

2500|$|In November 1990, {{an equally}} {{contentious}} discussion of vos Savant's article {{took place in}} Cecil Adams's column The Straight Dope (Adams 1990). Adams initially answered, incorrectly, that the chances for the two remaining doors must each be one in two. After a reader wrote in to correct the mathematics of Adams's analysis, Adams agreed that mathematically he had been wrong. [...] "You pick door #1. Now you're offered this choice: open door #1, or open door #2 and door #3. In the latter case <b>you</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> prize if it's behind either door. You'd rather have a two-in-three shot at the prize than one-in-three, wouldn't you? If you think about it, the original problem offers you basically the same choice. Monty is saying in effect: {{you can keep your}} one door or you can have the other two doors, one of which (a non-prize door) I'll open for you." [...] Adams did say the Parade version left critical constraints unstated, and without those constraints, the chances of winning by switching were not necessarily two out of three (e.g., it was not reasonable to assume the host always opens a door). Numerous readers, however, wrote in to claim that Adams had been [...] "right the first time" [...] and that the correct chances were one in two.|$|E
