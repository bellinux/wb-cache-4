5|$|Those {{accustomed}} to making repairs on solid state equipment are cautioned that vacuum tube gear contain potentially lethal voltages. The practice of discharging power-supply capacitors and keeping one hand in <b>your</b> <b>pocket</b> when working on powered-up gear are essential safety measures. Some older equipment directly connects the metal chassis {{to one side}} of the incoming AC line, a practice which results in the entire unit becoming electrified if the wall plug is inserted backwards. Many older radios, such as vintage receivers, are not safety-fused. Restorers generally replace the AC line cord with a more modern 3 wire plug and install an in-line or chassis mount fuseholder. The use of a common station ground connection to all equipment is encouraged. Those who collect, restore or otherwise use vintage radio equipment should also be aware of possible radioactive substances.|$|E

25|$|In 2010, Baillie {{teamed up}} with singer Adam Ant (whose drummer Hayley Leggs had been a member, {{alongside}} Baillie, of burlesque troupe The Satanic Sluts) to compose the song Gun in <b>Your</b> <b>Pocket,</b> about Ross, Brand and the entire affair. He intended to release the song as the lead single for his ninth album Adam Ant Is the Blueblack Hussar in Marrying the Gunner's Daughter (with a rerecording of early 1980s outtake Who's A Goofy Bunny Then? as the B-side in tribute to the recently deceased Malcolm McLaren). Gun in <b>Your</b> <b>Pocket</b> was performed live {{on at least one}} occasion, at a guerilla gig (one of several he played around this time) at London's Troubadour Café on 2 April 2010, and was setlisted, (but not performed) at Adam's Pirate Metal Extravanganza concert at the Scala on 30 April 2010, while the recording received a club play when Adam DJ'd at the Family Affair clubnight in Shoreditch, London on 24 April.|$|E

25|$|In {{the book}} How Social Security Picks <b>Your</b> <b>Pocket</b> other factors {{affecting}} Social Security net benefits are identified: Generally, {{people who work}} for more than 35 years get a lower net benefit – all other factors being equal. People who do not live long after retirement age get a much lower net benefit. Finally, people who derive a high percentage of income from non-wage sources get high Social Security net benefits because they appear to be poor, when they are not. The progressive benefit formula for Social Security is blind to the income a worker may have from non-wage sources, such as spousal support, dividends and interest, or rental income.|$|E

The scene where Peter is promoting 'Crystal Pepsi' was shown only on the DVD, because it is prohibited to promote one product over another on television.|$|E
500|$|As customary, {{the game}} {{began with the}} first of two rounds in which contestants {{answered}} questions to earn spins for the [...] "Big Board"; a correct buzz-in answer earned three spins, while a correct multiple-choice answer earned one spin. Larson's memorization of the patterns could not help him here, and he struggled early. On the second question, host Peter Tomarken asked, [...] "You've probably got President Franklin D. Roosevelt in <b>your</b> <b>pocket</b> or purse right now, because his likeness is on the head side". Larson buzzed in at this point and answered, [...] "$50 bill", after which Tomarken finished the question [...] "of what American coin?" [...] with the answer being [...] "a dime"; the other choice was [...] "a nickel". He did not buzz in again, answering the last two questions multiple choice and finishing with three spins, behind Long's four and Litras's ten. With the fewest spins, Larson went first. On his first spin, he hit a Whammy; however, on his next two, he hit square #4 for $1,250 and finished the round with $2,500. Long and Litras finished the round without a Whammy and won $4,080 and $4,608, respectively, putting Larson in last place.|$|E
500|$|Childress and Bowyer {{were both}} {{upset with the}} {{penalties}} and almost immediately announced plans to appeal. Bowyer argued the penalties to be too severe, saying, [...] "I don't think the penalty fits the crime. Sixty-thousandths of an inch, folks. Grab a quarter out of <b>your</b> <b>pocket.</b> Less than the thickness of that quarter right there is worth a 150-point fine?" [...] He also argued that his car could have been damaged slightly after the race as his car was pushed by a wrecker after it {{ran out of gas}} on its way to victory lane. [...] "Is it possible that a two-ton wrecker could bend the quarter-panel 60-thousandths of an inch? You have to ask yourself that." [...] The team lost the initial appeal, forcing them to make a final appeal to NASCAR National Commissioner John Middlebrook. As a result of the final appeal, Wilson's fine was reduced to $100,000 while he and Haney's suspensions were reduced from six to four races (they were allowed to work with the team during the appeal process); however, the points penalty administered to Bowyer and his team was upheld.|$|E

500|$|... "Kill the Lights" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics.

Anna Dimond of TV Guide commented that [...] "Kill the Lights" [...] shows that [...] "even a pop star needs alone time. Especially with her special someone," [...] and Jam!'s Darryl Sterdan considered it as a [...] "futuristic and vaguely ominous dance-floor filler". John Murphy of musicOMH noted the song is [...] "seemingly an open letter to Spears' paparazzi photographer ex-boyfriend with lines like 'Mr Photographer, I think I'm ready for my close-up' and 'is that money in <b>your</b> <b>pocket,</b> or are you just pleased to see me'", while Ben Rayner of the Toronto Star compared it to [...] "Womanizer" [...] (2008), saying both have [...] "the same swaggering beat hits". Poppy Cosyns of The Sun considered [...] "Kill the Lights" [...] as [...] "a full-on bolshy tirade, attacking sleazy parasitic paps with a vocal performance reminiscent of leotard-era Madonna". Alexis Petridis of The Guardian gave the song a negative review, saying it [...] "attempts to raise the kind of ire found on 'Blackout', but falls flat." ...|$|E

2500|$|Gun in <b>Your</b> <b>Pocket</b> {{was finally}} {{released}} in October 2012 as the B-side to Cool Zombie, the eventual first single from the album (which finally emerged in January 2013). [...] In {{addition to this}} song, Baillie and Adam Ant composed a second track about the Ross-Brand affair, Rubber Medusa, a song focussed mainly on Brand and written from Baillie's perspective. [...] Baillie's band, the Poussez Posse, performed this second song regularly in live support slots for Ant's UK tours during 2011–2012. [...] Commenting on the two songs in an interview by John Robb, Baillie noted [...] "The first one that Adam and I wrote was about an ex of mine- guess who! Which {{is not on the}} album, which is called Gun in <b>Your</b> <b>Pocket</b> ...(Subsequently) the first one Adam and I wrote together was Rubber Medusa, which was about Russell, Adam came up with the title which is a quote from the Jubilee film, (Brand) does look like a rubber Medusa so I see why he said it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Wilson {{coined the}} term 'Selsdon Man' {{to refer to the}} anti-interventionist {{policies}} of the Conservative leader Edward Heath, developed at a policy retreat held at the Selsdon Park Hotel in early 1970. This phrase, intended to evoke the 'primitive throwback' qualities of anthropological discoveries such as Piltdown Man and Swanscombe Man, was part of a British political tradition of referring to political trends by suffixing 'man'. Other memorable phrases attributed to Wilson include [...] "the white heat of the [...] revolution", and [...] "a week is a long time in politics", meaning that political fortunes can change extremely rapidly. In his broadcast after the 1967 devaluation of the pound, Wilson said: [...] "This {{does not mean that the}} pound here in Britain – in <b>your</b> <b>pocket</b> or purse – is worth any less...", and the phrase [...] "the pound in your pocket" [...] subsequently took on a life of its own.|$|E
2500|$|Adam Ant {{performed}} at The Troubadour Cafe on Friday 2 April.

The gig also saw the debut of Ant's new song,Gun in <b>Your</b> <b>Pocket,</b> {{the tale of the}} Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross incident involving Hayley's friend Georgina Baillie. Added to this was a cover of Johnny Kidd and the Pirates' [...] "Shakin' All Over", a favourite live number that Ant has been performing since around 1990. With recent late night visits to the recording studio that week, Ant had the benefit of playing the last minute set with a full backing band with Will Crewdson and Dave Ryder-Prangley from the band Rachel Stamp providing guitar and bass respectively, Hayley Leggs drumming, Peter Olive with keyboards, and Tree Carr backing up the vocal sound.|$|E
