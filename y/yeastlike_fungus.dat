However, usage has designated the term Monilia familiar to medical mycologists as a yeastlike organism devoid of ascospores, reproducing by budding, and under certain conditions developing mycelia (1, 2). The other organisms closely related to the Moniliae are Endomyces, Cryptococci and S&charomyces.

Also, the nutritional {{adequacy of the}} four media was evaluated with the same 15 strains of <b>yeastlike</b> <b>fungi.</b> While the MICs of BAY n 7133 {{were higher in the}} complex media, the activity of ketoconazole was little affected.

40|$|A <b>yeastlike</b> <b>fungus,</b> {{probably}} {{belonging to}} the genus Torula, was isolated from fresh pollen and was shown to produce erythritol in yields of 35 to 40 % of the sugar utilized. The ability to produce erythritol is an inherent characteristic of the isolate, but unfavorable fermentation conditions {{can lead to the}} production of glycerol at the expense of erythritol. By the use of a synthetic medium, it was shown that the concentrations of both nitrogen and phosphorous in the medium must be closely controlled to obtain satisfactory erythritol yields...|$|E
40|$|The osmophilic <b>yeastlike</b> <b>fungus</b> Moniliella tomentosa is an obligate aerobe {{and is not}} {{susceptible}} to glucose repression. Respiration is greatest in exponentially growing cells and is then highly sensitive to cyanide. Respiration in older cells or in chloramphenicol-grown cells is mediated by a cyanide-insensitive respiration which is sensitive to salicyl hydroxamic acid. Growth of cells under reduced oxygen does not influence the respiratory capacity of the cells but results in a longer generation time and a lower final cell yield. Low aeration levels and growth {{in the presence of}} chloramphenicol {{have a profound effect on}} ethanol and polyol production...|$|E
40|$|Mitochondria of the <b>yeastlike</b> <b>fungus</b> Moniliella tomentosa oxidize reduced {{nicotinamide}} adenine dinucleotide, reduced {{nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide}} phosphate, succinate, isocitrate, and lactate. These oxidations {{are completely}} inhibited by cyanide or antimycin A in mitochondria isolated from cells grown in the standard medium. On the other hand, the oxidation of all substrates, except lactate, is almost completely insensitive to cyanide or antimycin A in mitochondria from cells grown {{in the presence of}} ethidium bromide. In this instance, the oxidation is mainly mediated by an alternate oxidase which can be blocked by salicyl hydroxamic acid. The alternate oxidase can be specifically stimulated by adenosine 5 '-monophosphate and this provides a new method for the characterization of the alternate oxidase in mitochondria of M. tomentosa...|$|E
40|$|A {{strain of}} Cryptococcus laurentii and a haploid isolate of Tremella foliacea {{were shown to}} produce orthophosphate-repressible {{ribonuclease}} in liquid culture. Addition of as little as 1 mM K 2 HPO 4, pH 7. 0, completely repressed enzyme production by both fungi. The orthophosphate-repressible enzyme was not produced by other species of the two genera tested. These results, together with other findings, suggest a close phylogenetic relationship between Cryptococcus laurentii and Tremella foliacea. The ability of other yeasts and <b>yeastlike</b> <b>fungi</b> to hydrolyze ribonucleic acid in a solid test medium was assessed. Based on {{the limited number of}} organisms available for study, extracellular ribonuclease activity was found in species having close affinity to the Basidiomycetes and in yeasts classified in the ascomycetous genera, Endomycopsis, Hansenula, and Kluyveromyces. Other ascomycetous yeasts did not exhibit extracellular ribonuclease...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 69 {{isolates}} of yeasts {{were recorded in}} the indoor air of the school buildings: 43 in heated rooms and 26 in unheated rooms. Perfect stages prevailed. Fungi isolated in our study belonged to 39 species. These were mostly monospecific isolates although five two-species isolates were noted. Differences in the properties of physiological characters of fungi isolated in both study seasons were observed. As indoor and outdoor air does not mix during the heating season, a specific substrate for prototrophic, non-fermenting <b>yeastlike</b> <b>fungi</b> forms. Acid production allows fungi to dissolve inorganic compounds in building structures and to release needed microcomponents. Abilities to produce carotenoid pigments are clearly promoted in yeast-like fungi living indoor. This {{may be related to}} the accumulation of compounds that are indirect stages in the cycle of biosynthesis of carotenoids or a surplus of oxidizing compounds...|$|R

We found 11 discrepancies between the two systems: five (1. 3 %) of the isolates (Blastoschizomyces capitatus, 1; Candida albicans, 1; Hansenula anomala, 1; Rhodotorula minuta, 2) had biocodes not included in the expanded Vitek data base, and six (1. 5 %) of the isolates (Candida lusitaniae, 1; Candida parapsilosis, 1; Cryptococcus uniguttulatus, 1; H. anomala, 1; Torulopsis candida, 2) were misidentified by the Vitek system. Overall, the efficacy of the Vitek system compares favorably with that of the API 20 C in the identification of clinically important yeasts...|$|R
40|$|Amphotericin B and {{fluconazole}} susceptibilities of 13 Cryptococcus neoformans isolates {{from five}} patients with recurrent cryptococcal meningitis were determined. For each patient, serial isolates showed {{no increase in}} antibiotic resistance relative to the initial isolate. For these patients, recurrent disease was not due to drug resistance but may reflect changes in immune function and/or poor compliance. Cryptococcus neofornans is a <b>yeastlike</b> <b>fungus</b> which causes a progressive meningoencephalitis in 5 to 13 % of all patients with AIDS (5, 9, 25). In the setting of AIDS, cryptococcal meningitis is incurable and lifelong suppression with antifungal agents is necessary to decrease the likelihood of recurrence (5, 9, 25, 26). In recent years, fluconazole has become widely used for suppression therapy (14, 24). How-ever, {{a small number of}} patients relapse despite fluconazole suppression. We have shown that in recurrent cryptococcal meningitis the initial and relapse isolates are clonally related and hence recurrences result from persistence of the origina...|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} of macrophages as effector cells in cellular reactions of immunity and hypersensitivity {{is well established}} (8). Macrophages activated {{as a result of}} specific immunological events exhibit increased microbicidal activity not only for the primary organism used for immunization purposes but also against unrelated intracellular pathogens (7). It is believed that the acquisition of this bactericidal or bacteriostatic activity is conferred on macrophages by materials released during the interaction of specifically immune lymphocytes with the antigen (Fowles et al., 1973; Godal et al., 1971; Jones and Youmans, 1973; Krahenbuhl and Remington, 1971; Mackaness, 1971; Patterson and Youmans, 1970). The antimicrobial activity in these studies refers to the intracellular inhibition and/or killing of the organisms; no attempts were made to assess the effect of activated macrophages on the extracellularly residing organisms. In an earlier study with the pathogenic <b>yeastlike</b> <b>fungus</b> Cryptococcus neoformans, we observed that freshly collected peritoneal macrophages from mice pretreated with a variety of nonspecific agents or from specifically immune mice possessed the capacity to exert anti-cryptococcal effect both on intracellular yeasts as well as those present in the extracellular milieu (Sethi et al., 1971; Sethi and Pelster, in press). Our results suggest that soluble product(s) released from mouse macrophages immune to Listeria monocytogenes can exert antilisterial activity under in vitro conditions...|$|E
40|$|Colonization {{of apple}} leaves by the <b>yeastlike</b> <b>fungus</b> Aureobasidium pullulans was {{followed}} quantitatively and spatially at a microscale level throughout two growing seasons. Ten field leaves were sampled on 11 dates in 2003 and 15 dates in 2004. Using an A. pullulans-specific fluorescence {{in situ hybridization}} probe and epifluorescence microscopy, we enumerated total cells, swollen-cells and chlamydospores (SCC), and blastospores/mm 2 on leaf features, including the midvein, other (smaller) veins, and the interveinal regions. By 7 July 2003 and 7 June 2004, the total numbers of A. pullulans cells/mm 2 were significantly higher (P < 0. 05) on the midvein and other veins than in the interveinal regions. This pattern remained consistent thereafter. The primary colonizing morphotype in all regions at all dates was the SCC form, although blastospores always occurred in low numbers. Occupancy was quantified based on the percentage of microscope fields of a particular leaf feature containing â‰¥ 1 A. pullulans cell. In general, as seasons progressed, the percent occupancy of features increased and, for most midvein and veinal features, approximated 100 % at the end of both growing seasons. Except for early collections, when A. pullulans cell numbers were low, the percent occupancy of interveinal regions was lower than that of the midvein or other veinal regions. A. pullulans was distributed primarily as single cells throughout the seasons in interveinal regions. On the midvein and other veins, colonies of â‰¥ 4 cells developed over time, and more cells occurred in colonies than as singletons by August. Our results demonstrate that A. pullulans primarily colonizes veins, where populations appear to increase by growth in situ. This pattern is established early in the growing season and persists...|$|E
40|$|Haloprogin {{was shown}} to be a highly {{effective}} agent for the treatment of experimentally induced topical mycotic infections in guinea pigs. Its in vitro spectrum of activity also includes yeasts, <b>yeastlike</b> <b>fungi</b> (Candida species), and certain gram-positive bacteria. The in vitro and in vivo antifungal activity of haloprogin against dermatophytes was equal to that observed with tolnaftate. The striking differences between the two agents were the marked antimonilial and selective antibacterial activities shown by haloprogin, contrasted with the negligible activities found with tolnaftate. Addition of serum decreased the in vitro antifungal activity of haloprogin {{to a greater extent than}} that of tolnaftate; however, diminished antifungal activity was not observed when haloprogin was applied topically to experimental dermatophytic infections. Based on its broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity, haloprogin may prove to be a superior topical agent in the treatment of dermatophytic and monilial infections in man...|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} of antibacterial compounds by yeasts and <b>yeastlike</b> <b>fungi</b> {{isolated from the}} phylloplane is reported. Aureobasidium pullulans, Citeromyces matritensis, Cryptococcus laurentii, Rhodotorula glutinis, and Sporobolomyces roseus produced antibacterial compounds inhibitory to both Pseudomonas fluorescens and Staphylococcus aureus in an overlay bioassay. In contrast, isolates of Candida albicans, Filobasidium uniguttulatum, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Torulaspora delbruckii, Tremella foliacea, Trichosporon beigelii, and Trichosporon dulcitum obtained from soil or from culture collections did not produce inhibitory compounds when screened by the same procedure. The {{production of}} antibacterial compounds was examined in more detail, using several isolates of A. pullulans distinguished by cluster analysis {{on the basis of}} biochemical and physiological tests. They were found to produce a range of antibacterial compounds with different activities. Two distinct antibiotics were produced by an isolate of A. pullulans in liquid culture during both the logarithmic and the stationary phases of growth...|$|R
40|$|Agglutinins {{have been}} {{prepared}} against the medically important Candida species. Crude antisera to the various species demonstrated intense cross-reactions with heterologous <b>yeastlike</b> <b>fungi</b> {{as well as with}} many true yeasts. However, carefully monitored adsorptions of selected antisera allowed the production of six factor sera that proved useful in a slide agglutination test. These six sera permitted the rapid and specific identification of C. guilliermondii, C. krusei, C. parapsilosis, and C. pseudotropicalis. They also allowed the delineation of two groups: (i) C. albicans (type A) -C. tropicalis and (ii) C. albicans (type B) -C. stellatoidea. C. albicans type A could be readily distinguished from C. tropicalis by its ability to form germ tubes in serum. C. stellatoidea could be distinguished from C. albicans type B by its predominantly filamentous growth on a nutritionally deficient medium. The medically important Candida species could be identified within 24 hr by the combined use of serological and morphological procedures...|$|R

40|$|We used {{discriminant}} analysis of cellular fatty acid compositions determined by gas-liquid chromatography to differentiate <b>yeastlike</b> <b>fungi</b> (a total of 190 strains; including 37 Candida albicans strains, 21 Candida krusei strains, 13 Candida guilliermondii strains, 37 Candida tropicalis strains, 10 Candida pseudotropicalis strains, 24 Candida parapsilosis strains, 32 Torulopsis glabrata strains, and 16 Cryptococcus neoformans strains). Previous results {{with a standard}} strain of C. albicans indicated that reproducible fatty acid chromatograms can be obtained with cells grown in a medium of 2 % Sabouraud glucose agar at 35 degrees C for between 48 and 72 h. These conditions were also maintained in cultures of the other organisms that we studied. The cellular fatty acid compositions of the organisms were determined quantitatively by gas-liquid chromatography and analyzed by {{discriminant analysis}}. The total correct identification expressed as relative peak percent was 95. 8 % (89. 2 % for C. albicans to 100 % for C. krusei, C. guilliermondii, C. pseudotropicalis, T. glabrata, and C. neoformans). The total correct identification expressed as the common peak (palmitic acid) ratio was 94. 7 % (87. 5 % for C. parapsilosis to 100 % for C. pseudotropicalis, T. glabrata, and C. neoformans).

40|$|In {{the last}} 20 years, cases of human cryptococcosis, have {{increased}} in immuno-compromised patients. In several instances, the cases {{have been associated with}} the exposure of the patients to bird droppings. In order to investigate birds of prey as potential carriers and spreaders of Cryptococcus neoformans and other yeasts of importance in human infections, 182 swab samples were collected from the cloacae of several species of birds of prey (Group I) and 32 faecal samples from aviaries in which the birds were housed (Group II). Samples were also taken from digestive tract of 60 dead birds (Group III). A total of 454 samples were cultured from which 215 colonies of <b>yeastlike</b> <b>fungi</b> were recovered and identified. Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii was isolated from three cloacae samples (4. 8 %) collected from Falco tinnunculus and from one sample (3. 1 %) obtained from Buteo buteo, as well as from samples collected at the aviaries in which these birds were kept. Overall, 18 samples (9. 9 %) from Group I, 13 (40. 6 %) from Group II, 12 crops (20 %), three proventriculi (5 %) and 12 cloacae (20 %) from Group III yielded positive cultures for yeasts. The results indicate that birds of prey and in particular, F. tinnunculus and B. buteo, may act as carriers and spreaders of C. neoformans and other zoonotic yeasts...|$|R
40|$|Yeast taxa {{traditionally}} are {{distinguished by}} growth tests on several sugars and organic acids. During {{the last decades}} {{it became apparent that}} many yeast species assimilate a much greater variety of naturally occurring carbon compounds as sole source of carbon and energy. These abilities are indicative of a greater role of yeasts in the carbon cycle than previously assumed. Especially in acidic soils and other habitats, yeasts {{may play a role in}} the degradation of carbon compounds. Such compounds include purines like uric acid and adenine, aliphatic amines, diamines and hydroxyamines, phenolics and other benzene compounds and polysaccharides. Assimilation of purines and amines is a feature of many ascomycetes and basidiomycetes. However, benzene compounds are degraded by only a few ascomycetous yeasts (e. g. the Stephanoascus/ Blastobotrys clade and black <b>yeastlike</b> <b>fungi)</b> but by many basidiomycetes, e. g. Filobasidiales, Trichosporonales, red yeasts producing ballistoconidia and related species, but not by Tremellales. Assimilation of polysaccharides is wide-spread among basidiomycetes Growth tests on these compounds separate Trichosporon species that otherwise are hardly distinguishable. Yeasts able to degrade phenolics can be applied for cresol removal from polluted soil and styrene removal from air by biofilters containing black yeast. Yeasts growing on polysaccharides may be a valuable source of hydrolytic enzymes that can be applied in food technology. Biodegradative abilities of yeasts inhabiting aerial plant surfaces and the fate of these yeasts during anaerobiosis and lactic acid fermentation are also dealt wit...|$|R
40|$|Microbial {{communities}} on non-processed foods are complex with unknown effects on food quality and human health. It is generally {{assumed that the}} ecology of the microflora associated with apples reflects the environment of the orchard, handling, harvesting, and storage. We performed a comparative field trial to assess how anthropogenic factors, such as organic and conventional farming practices, influence the microbial community of apple fruits. Apples are an economically important crop in Switzerland. In 2004, we harvested apple fruits cv. Golden Delicious of five pairs of organic/ conventional farms at five different locations in Switzerland. We combined classical microbiological methods and genetic tools to characterize the cultivable and uncultivable microflora of apple fruits. Morphologically distinct mold and yeast colonies were recovered from apple fruit surface (epiphytes) or from underneath the skin (endophytes) and recorded on nutrient agar. We also started to develop culture-independent molecular DNA-techniques (e. g. PCR of internal transcribed spacer region, ITS) for species identification and fungal community studies. Several white and red/pink yeasts and <b>yeastlike</b> <b>fungi</b> were the predominant epiphytes. Morphologically different molds formed almost exclusively the endophytic microflora. The yeast-like fungi were more abundantly and more frequently found on organic apple fruits whereas red/pink yeasts prevailed on conventional fruits. We found higher numbers of endophytic molds and more morphological types in organic fruits. These results suggest that the microbial community of apple fruits adapts to the farming practice, a feature which might be useful for authenticity and food quality...|$|R
40|$|With the {{discovery}} that the coccidian parasite Cryptosporidium sp. can cause severe symptoms in humans, implementation of many diagnostic techniques rapidly followed. The infection is self-limiting in patients with normal immune systems but chronic in the immunosuppressed patient. With the eventual {{development and use of}} therapeutic agents, it will become very important to find Cryptosporidium sp., even in low numbers, in fecal specimens. Production of a highly specific and sensitive antibody by use of cloning techniques has provided another diagnostic tool. Formalinized positive human fecal specimens (n = 99) and negative specimens (n = 198), of which 115 contained <b>yeastlike</b> <b>fungi</b> and other organisms, were tested in blind trials by use of a monoclonal antibody. Sensitivity was 100 % with 3 - to 4 + fluorescence on all cryptosporidial oocysts, both in light and heavy infections. The organisms were round and easily visible (4 to 6 micron), showing apple-green to yellow fluorescence against a dark background free of nonspecific fluorescence. Specificity was also 100 % with all 99 positive Cryptosporidium sp. specimens exhibiting fluorescence and all 198 negative specimens showing no fluorescence. All positive and negative specimens were previously confirmed by the hot modified acid-fast technique. However, seven specimens previously considered negative by this acid-fast method were positive by the monoclonal antibody technique. These specimens were confirmed as positive, after extensive examination of additional smears prepared by the modified hot acid-fast method revealed rare organisms, emphasizing the increased sensitivity of the monoclonal antibody technique. Since acid-fast stains do not always consistently stain all oocysts, the increased sensitivity of the monoclonal reagent provides an excellent screening method...|$|R
40|$|The {{opportunistic}} <b>yeastlike</b> <b>fungi</b> of {{the genus}} Candida comprise three species which are proteolytic in vitro. Among them, C. albicans and C. tropicalis are of foremost medical importance. However, a strict correlation between extracellular proteolytic activity and virulence is opposed by the low virulence of the third proteolytic species, C. parapsilosis. We purified the secretory acid proteinase of C. parapsilosis (clinical isolate 265). The enzyme is a carboxyl proteinase (EC 3. 4. 23) like all other secretory Candida proteinases handled so far. Proteinase 265 is distinguished by a lower molecular weight (approximately 33, 000); it has increased hydrophobicity, which accounts for inhibition of the enzyme by hemin, and required the presence of nonionic detergent in the initial steps of purification. The enzyme already undergoes alkaline denaturation at neutrality. Its activity is thus confined to the acid microenvironment of the fungal cell wall. Within this range, the enzyme may degrade immunoglobulins like immunoglobulin A 1 (IgA 1), IgA 2, and secretory IgA. No indication was found for glycosylation of proteinase 265 and the related enzyme of C. albicans CBS 2730. However, the comparable proteinase of C. tropicalis 293 {{was identified as a}} manno protein. Antiserum against proteinase 265 cross-reacted strongly with corresponding enzymes from other Candida species. Antisera against proteinases of C. albicans and C. tropicalis reacted only weakly with proteinase 265. Thus, secretory Candida proteinases are likely to possess common and species-specific antigenic sites. In contrast to C. albicans, infection of phagocytes by C. parapsilosis 265 was not accompanied by secretion of fungal proteinase. This lack of induction of the enzyme under conditions of infection may account for the low virulence of most isolates of C. parapsilosis...|$|R
40|$|We {{compared}} {{the activities of}} antifungal agents against {{a wide range of}} yeasts and filamentous fungi. The methodology of the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) for yeasts and spore-forming molds was applied; and a total of 349 clinical isolates of Candida spp., other yeast species, Aspergillus spp., and nondermatophyte non-Aspergillus spp. were investigated. The average geometric mean (GM) of the MICs of the various drugs for Candida spp. were as follows: amphotericin B (AMB), 0. 55 Î¼g/ml; liposomal amphotericin B (l-AMB); 0. 35 Î¼g/ml; itraconazole (ITC), 0. 56 Î¼g/ml; voriconazole (VRC), 0. 45 Î¼g/ml; posaconazole (POS), 0. 44 Î¼g/ml; and caspofungin (CPF), 0. 45 Î¼g/ml. The data indicated that the majority of Candida spp. were susceptible to the traditional and new antifungal drugs. For Aspergillus spp., the average GM MICs of AMB, l-AMB, ITC, VRC, POS, and CPF were 1. 49 Î¼g/ml, 1. 44 Î¼g/ml, 0. 65 Î¼g/ml, 0. 34 Î¼g/ml, 0. 25 Î¼g/ml, and 0. 32 Î¼g/ml, respectively. For the various zygomycetes, the average GM MICs of AMB, l-AMB, ITC, and POS were 1. 36 Î¼g/ml, 1. 42 Î¼g/ml, 4. 37 Î¼g/ml, and 1. 65 Î¼g/ml, respectively. Other <b>yeastlike</b> <b>fungi</b> and molds displayed various patterns of susceptibility. In general, the minimal fungicidal concentrations were 1 to 3 dilutions higher than the corresponding MICs. POS, AMB, and l-AMB showed activities against a broader range of fungi than ITC, VRC, and CPF did. Emerging pathogens such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Fusarium solani were not killed by any drug. In summary, the EUCAST data showed that the in vitro susceptibilities of yeasts and filamentous fungi are variable, that susceptibility occurs among and within various genera and species, and that susceptibility depends on the antifungal drug tested. AMB, l-AMB, and POS were active against the majority of pathogens, including species that cause rare and difficult-to-treat infections...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityEach {{region of}} the body has its own natural micro-organisms, which {{constitute}} the normal flora of that region. Among the organisms present are bacteria and higher fungi. Pathogenic fungi in the normal flora regarded as important because of the threat which they offer {{to the health of}} the body. Under the proper circumstances, these pathogens can invade the tissues, setting up an infection. Fungus diseases which terminate fatally are numerically important, although they are responsible for only 0. 03 % of deaths in the United States in any year. Non-fatal fungus diseases are very prevalent, being almost as common as any bacterial diseases. Notable among these is coccidioidomycosis, acquired by 75 to 97 % of the children on Indian reservations in Arizona. Tinea capitis is now referred to as an epidemic communicable disease. Dermatophytosis of the feet is also an ever-present mycosis which does not result in death. Fungus infections are, for the most part, endogenous origin. For instance, actinomycosis is not transmitted from one human to another, nor from animal to man. The causative organism, Actinomyces bovis, does not exist outside the body, so the infection must be endogenous. In the Ebers Papyrus, written about 1500 B. C., the first reference to fungi is found. But it was not until 1683 A. D., when Leeuwenhoek developed his lenses, that microorganisms were seen for the first time. Suspicion that microbes caused disease was harbored by Fracastor in 1543. The hair and scalp, although popularly believed to be free from living organisms; harbors many fungi among which is the pathogenic Pityrosporon ovale. Skin, even though is has been scrubbed clean, is never entirely free from bacteria. Monilia albicans, the etiologic agent of moniliasis, is found on normal skin. Cryptococci and mycodermata, responsible for cryptococcosis and geotrichosis, respectively, have been isolated from the skin and nails of individuals. Ordinary cleansing of the skin, which insures the proper action of the germicidal power, is sufficient to keep the pathogens found normally on the skin in check. However, a mere break in the skin, or excessive moistening of this protective barrier is in many instances, sufficient for pathogens to enter, and gain a foothold, to cause an infection. The feet provide a favorable environment for fungus growth, as in indicated by the high incidence of dermatophytoses of the feet. Men seem to be more susceptible to mycosis of the feet, according to figures presented. However, this has been shown to be due to the gymnasium habits and the mobilization of men, and not a sex difference. Some people must be more susceptible than others, though, since familial and conjugal transmission of ringworm of the groin is so rare that mycologists are convinced of the endogenous origin of this mycosis. The ears do not contain the agents of otomycosis, but these organisms, belonging mainly in the genus Aspergillus, are found on normal skin. Injury to the external auditory canal by the unskilled removal of excess cerumen has resulted in otitis. The external genitalia contain no fungi, except for the vagina, which has a varied flora. Monilia albicans is found there constantly. The internal genitalia are sterile. The eyes and lungs harbor no fungi, nor do the accessory digestive organs, such as the liver, pancreas, and so on. The mouth, however, contains a host of organisms; the most important of the fungi which are found frequently in the normal mouth, is the patnogenic Monilia albicans, which causes thrush or oral moniliasis. In an original investigation by the writer, it was found that of the 50 subjects were positive for <b>yeastlike</b> <b>fungi,</b> most of which were Monilia albicans. The organisms were tested for their pathogenicity to mice by intraperitoneal injections. Of the 17 cultures, 5 proved fatal to the mice. Some of the animals which lived looked unhealthy for a few days. Thus a variable degree of pathogenicity is indicated. M. albicans may also be associated with dental caries, because of the production of acid when it ferments carbohydrates, and because it has been found in a significantly high percentage of caries cases as contrasted with a low percentage of non-caries cases. No significant correlation between the presence of <b>yeastlike</b> <b>fungi</b> and caries experience in the last two years was noted in the present study. A slight tendency for extensive caries involvement to be associated with yeasts was seen, but the difference was not statistically significant. Consideration of the problem of dental caries and its etiological factors reveals that no one factor can be named as the sole agent of caries. Constitution, environment, diet, mouth flora [...] -all of these may play a part. Since the time of Hippocrates, theories which attempt to explain caries have been put forth. The disease existed as long ago as 2800 B. C., for the remains of people buried about that time were examined and found to have as high an incidence of caries as the people of Europe in 1930. Diet is believed responsible for the caries prevalence among people of today. Over 95 % of human beings are believed to be afflicted with this disease. Tropical inhabitants who have incorporated the soft diet of the whtte ra. ces have acquired also the high incidence of caries. Fracastor, as early as 1543 A. D., conceived of living organisms as the cause of caries. Today the belief is that a combination of factors is responsible. Bacteria and fungi ferment carbohydrates, producing acid in susceptible teeth. If the teeth are constitutionally sound, or are protected by a high fluorine content, thus being rendered less soluble in acid the presence of the acid-producing organisms makes no difference to the individual. However, if the calcium of the mother is insufficient for sound tooth formation in the child, and the drinking water does not contain fluorine to strengthen the teeth against decalcification, and the mouth contains acid-producing organisms, then the child is quite susceptible to caries. The nose contains a variable group of organisms, so that it has been said that a "normal flora" as such cannot be described. However, Saccharomyces has been named as a pathogenic fungus found in the nose. Other fungi are present, but their pathogenicity is not stated. The acidity of the stomach keeps that organ practically sterile, although many organisms are swallowed. Surviving bacteria and fungi descend into the intestines, and, finding those regions more amenable to their growth and multiplication, occur there in great numbers. Among the organisms in the alimentary canal are Monilia albicans, cryptococci, and mycodermata. In the lower, more alkaline {{region of the}} intestines, Actinomyces bovis is found, often giving rise to cecal actinomycosis. Thus, it is evident that the body harbors on its skin and mucous membranes, especially on the latter, several types of pathogenic fungi. These organisms are able to attack the host, but only when his resistance to disease is lowered. At other times, the microbes exist as saprophytes, doing no harm to the host...|$|R
