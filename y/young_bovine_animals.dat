40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to re-evaluate the {{analytical}} results and time trends of the content of cadmium in muscle, liver, and kidney samples of <b>young</b> <b>bovine</b> <b>animals</b> and cows slaughtered in the Czech Republic during the years 1993 – 2010, and to estimate the total dietary exposure for the entire population aged 4 – 90 years and specifically, for children at the age of four to six years. Analyses showed that the arithmetic means of cadmium concentration in cow kidney and liver are higher than in young bovine (P < 0. 0001), but not in muscle (P = 0. 227). The mean cadmium concentration in cow kidney (0. 595 mg·kg- 1) was twice as high as in young bovine kidney (0. 285 mg·kg- 1) for the entire studied period. The mean concentration of cadmium in cow liver (0. 113 mg·kg- 1) was higher compared to young bovine liver (0. 078 mg·kg- 1). The mean concentration of cadmium in cow muscle (0. 008 mg·kg- 1) was comparable with young bovine muscle (0. 006 mg·kg- 1). The evaluation of time trends showed increasing concentrations of cadmium for cow (increasing slaughtering age) and young bovine kidney and decreasing concentrations for cow and young bovine muscle, but no significant change for liver. The estimated Cd burden of the entire population is worthy of attention (10 % were over the tolerable dose of 2. 5 μg·kg- 1 bod...|$|E

As the name suggests, it prefers <b>bovine</b> <b>animals</b> {{as the source of}} blood, although it may bite other kind of mammals as well. The insect is relatively large for a horse-fly, adults usually being 25-30 mm long. Like most other horseflies, its compound eyes are very colorful with stripe-like patterns. Its body and wings are mostly colored brownish gray. It is quite fast and an able flier, being capable of evading most attempts to swat it with ease. It bites humans infrequently, because of its preference of <b>bovine</b> <b>animals.</b> This loud-buzzing horse-fly can be a nuisance, as it circles around its target and occasionally lands to deliver a bite (in the case of humans, the fly usually takes off again instead). However, to humans it is considerably less harmful than deer flies (Chrysops), which bite much more vigorously.|$|R

40|$|Objective: Dexamethasone (Dex) is a {{synthetic}} glucocorticoid that has pro-anabolic and anticatabolic effects in {{cartilage tissue engineering}} systems, though the mechanisms by which these effects are mediated are not well understood. We tested {{the hypothesis that the}} addition of Dex to chondrogenic medium would affect matrix production and aggrecanase activity of human and bovine bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) cultured in self-assembling peptide and agarose hydrogels. Design: We cultured <b>young</b> <b>bovine</b> and adult human BMSCs in (RADA) [subscript 4] self-assembling peptide and agarose hydrogels in medium containing TGF-β 1 ±Dex and analyzed extracellular matrix composition, aggrecan cleavage products, and the effects of the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU- 486 on proteoglycan content, synthesis, and catabolic processing. Results: Dex improved proteoglycan synthesis and retention in agarose hydrogels seeded with <b>young</b> <b>bovine</b> cells but decreased proteoglycan accumulation in peptide scaffolds. These effects were mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor. Adult human BMSCs showed minimal matrix accumulation in agarose, but accumulated ~ 50 % as much proteoglycan and collagen as <b>young</b> <b>bovine</b> BMSCs in peptide hydrogels. Dex reduced aggrecanase activity in (RADA) [subscript 4] and agarose hydrogels, as measured by anti-NITEGE Western blotting, for both bovine and human BMSC-seeded gels.

40|$|Abstract Subcutaneous and perirenal {{adipose tissue}} from <b>bovine</b> <b>animals</b> that had {{different}} fat deposition patterns were characterized {{in terms of}} the weight of the adipose tissue organ and adipose cell number and mean cell size as determined by electronic counting of osmium-fixed adipose cells. Similar parameters were also measured in the interfascicular adipose tissue dissected from four muscles. Adipose tissue from animals of the leaner Holstein breed contained smaller cells than the respective tissues from the fatter Hereford X Angus animals. The small subcutaneous deposit in the Holstein animals was due to a small number of adipose cells that were small in size. During growth of the <b>bovine</b> <b>animal,</b> an increase in adipose tissue mass was accompanied by cellular hypertrophy and hyperplasia. However, by 14 months of life hyperplasia was complete in all but the interfascicular adipose tissue. In the 14 -month-old Hereford X Angus steers, interfascicular adipose tissue had an appreciable number of small cells and a bimodal distribution for cell diameter. The {{results of this study suggest}} that interfascicular adipose tissue is a late developing depot and that hyperplasia is still an active process in this depot at 14 months of life, whereas hyperplasia appears to be nearly complete in the subcutaneous and perirenal depots of <b>bovine</b> <b>animals</b> by about 8 months of life or shortly thereafter. Correlation coefficients indicated that intramuscular lipid content was positively related to the number of interfascicular adipose cells per 100 g of muscle in four different muscles. However, average cell diameter and volume were significantly correlated to intramuscular lipid content in only one of the four muscles studied.

Surely, Filipinos have a great need for domestic animals because they serve as sources of meat and milk and assist in agricultural-related activities.

Untreated unground un-pumiced, unground pumiced, and ground enamel surfaces, as well as synthetic hydroxyapatite surfaces, served as controls for intra-tooth evaluations {{of the effects of}} different treatments. The analyses indicated that exposure to 35 % H 202 alone, besides increasing the nitrogen content, produced no other significant change in the elemental composition of any of the enamel surfaces investigated. Exposure to 37 % H 3 PO 4, however, produced a marked decrease in calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) concentrations and an increase in carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) concentrations in unground un-pumiced specimens only, and a decrease in C concentration in ground specimens. These results suggest that the reported decrease in the adhesive bond strength of resin to 35 % H 202 -treated enamel is not caused by a change in the elemental composition of treated enamel surfaces. They also suggest that an organic-rich layer, unaffected by acid-etching, may be present on the unground u-n-pumiced surface of <b>young</b> <b>bovine</b> incisors. This layer can be removed by thorough pumicing or by grinding.

40|$|Objective: Interleukin- 1 {{is one of}} the {{inflammatory}} cytokines elevated after traumatic joint {{injury that}} plays a critical role in mediating cartilage tissue degradation, suppressing matrix biosynthesis, and inducing chondrocyte apoptosis, events associated with progression to post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA). We studied the combined use of insulin-like growth factor- 1 (IGF- 1) and dexamethasone (Dex) to block these multiple degradative effects of cytokine challenge to articular cartilage. Methods: <b>Young</b> <b>bovine</b> and adult human articular cartilage explants were treated with IL- 1 α in {{the presence or absence of}} IGF- 1, Dex, or their combination. Loss of sulfated glycosaminoglycans (sGAG) and collagen were evaluated by the DMMB and hydroxyproline assays, respectively. Matrix biosynthesis was measured via radiolabel incorporation, chondrocyte gene expression by qRT-PCR, and cell viability by fluorescence staining. Results: In <b>young</b> <b>bovine</b> cartilage, the combination of IGF- 1 and Dex significantly inhibited the loss of sGAG and collagen, rescued the suppression of matrix biosynthesis, and inhibited the loss of chondrocyte viability caused by IL- 1 α treatment. In adult human cartilage, only IGF- 1 rescued matrix biosynthesis and only Dex inhibited sGAG loss and improved cell viability. Thus, the combination of IGF- 1 + Dex together showed combined beneficial effects in human cartilage. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the combination of IGF- 1 and Dex has greater beneficial effects than either molecule alone in preventing cytokine-mediated cartilage degradation in adult human and <b>young</b> <b>bovine</b> cartilage. Our results support the use of such a combined approach as a potential treatment relevant to early cartilage degradative changes associated with joint injury. Singapore.
