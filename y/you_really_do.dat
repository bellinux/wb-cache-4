It's a very overwhelming process to go through and <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> feel that there's something else that got you there. Especially with how I didn't feel confident before and then something just clicked and I could look people in the eyes and really try and deliver a song.|$|E

[...] The episode was broadcast on BBC One on 27 August 2016 and was available to watch for thirty days afterwards on BBC iPlayer. In addition to this, [...] "Too Old for This Shift" [...] was made available for digital download via BBC Store on 27 August 2016 in standard definition, with higher definition later made available for purchase.|$|E
500|$|Some {{brand and}} {{marketing}} experts {{have come out}} {{in support of the}} name change. Nigel Currie, director of sports marketing agency Brand Rapport, stated that [...] "the whole process has been conducted badly with the supporters, but [...] is a pretty sound idea." [...] Simon Chadwick, professor of Sport Business Strategy and Marketing at the Coventry University Business School, opined that the objective of opening up lucrative new markets for shirt sales, merchandise and broadcast deals shows commercial vision and could bring benefits, but [...] "this needs to be backed up by a proper marketing strategy and investment." [...] He said, [...] "it's no use thinking changing the name or the colour of the shirt will pay instant dividends." [...] David Stern, commissioner of the National Basketball Association in the United States, warned: [...] "I would say a wise owner [...] would view his ownership as something of a public trust, in addition to the profit motive, and <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> want to allow the fans a little bit more input than I think is being allowed, with respect to Hull." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{years from}} 1801 to 1804 are {{something}} of a blank space for Austen scholars as Cassandra destroyed all of her letters from her sister in this period for unknown reasons. In December 1802 Austen received her only known proposal of marriage. She and her sister visited Alethea and Catherine Bigg, old friends who lived near Basingstoke. Their younger brother, Harris Bigg-Wither, had recently finished his education at Oxford and was also at home. Bigg-Wither proposed and Austen accepted. As described by Caroline Austen, Jane's niece, and Reginald Bigg-Wither, a descendant, Harris was not attractive – he was a large, plain-looking man who spoke little, stuttered when he did speak, was aggressive in conversation, and almost completely tactless. However, Austen had known him since both were young and the marriage offered many practical advantages to Austen and her family. He was the heir to extensive family estates located {{in the area where}} the sisters had grown up. With these resources, Austen could provide her parents a comfortable old age, give Cassandra a permanent home and, perhaps, assist her brothers in their careers. By the next morning, Austen realised she had made a mistake and withdrew her acceptance. No contemporary letters or diaries describe how Austen felt about this proposal. In 1814, Austen wrote a letter to her niece, Fanny Knight, who had asked for advice about a serious relationship, telling her that [...] "having written so much {{on one side of the}} question, I shall now turn around & entreat you not to commit yourself farther, & not to think of accepting him unless <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> like him. Anything is to be preferred or endured rather than marrying without Affection". The English scholar Douglas Bush wrote that Austen had [...] "had a very high ideal of the love that should unite a husband and wife... All of her heroines... know in proportion to their maturity, the meaning of ardent love". A possible autobiographical element in Sense and Sensibility occurs when Elinor Dashwood contemplates that [...] "the worse and most irremediable of all evils, a connection for life" [...] with an unsuitable man.|$|E
2500|$|Scottish actor Robbie Coltrane has portrayed Hagrid {{in all of}} {{the film}} adaptations of the Harry Potter novels. Robin Williams was {{interested}} for the role and approached Chris Columbus, the director of the first two films, about participating in the project but Columbus rejected him due to the [...] "all-British and Irish cast" [...] policy. Rowling had wanted Coltrane for the role from the start, responding [...] "RobbieColtraneforHagrid" [...] all in one quick breath when asked who was the top of her list of casting choices. Coltrane was already a fan of the books and has commented that being part of the Harry Potter franchise was [...] "a fantastic thing." [...] Rowling discussed Hagrid's past and future with Coltrane, assisting him in preparing for the role. She also stated that [...] "Robbie is just perfect for Hagrid because Hagrid is a very loveable character, quite likeable, quite comic [...] but he had to have – <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> have to sense – a certain toughness underneath [...] and I think Robbie does that perfectly." ...|$|E
