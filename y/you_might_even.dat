500|$|The song {{received}} strongly positive {{responses from}} critics, {{and it was}} frequently cited as {{the highlight of the}} album. Phil Sutcliffe in Sounds magazine said the song was [...] "so honest <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> risk calling it truth". Music website AllMusic called [...] "Biko" [...] a [...] "stunning achievement for its time", and {{went on to say that}} [...] "It's odd that such a bleak song can sound so freeing and liberating". Writing in 2013, Mark Pedelty would say that [...] "Biko" [...] "stood out for its unusual instrumentation (bagpipes and synthesizer), haunting vocals, and funerary chant," [...] and credited Gabriel with doing a [...] "masterful job of creating catalytic imagery and getting out of the way". Music scholar Michael Drewett wrote that the lyrics skillfully engaged the listener by moving from a specific story to a call for action.|$|E
500|$|Greg Kot, {{writer for}} the Chicago Tribune, stated that the track [...] "seduces like a drug dealer", with Ocean crooning over a laid-back rhythm. Prefix Magazines David Padula commented that it [...] "centers around a jazzy {{keyboard}} lick that dips regularly into more lush surroundings. The crisp percussion is a highlight, but the winning point is the soulful croons and general smoothness of Ocean." [...] Mike Powell's Spin praised Ocean's writing abilities, musing [...] "my 'TV ain't HD, that's too real', the narrator of 'Sweet Life' complains, then returns to his swimming-pool floatie. If the song wasn't so pretty — Ocean's velvety voice, soft jazzy accompaniment — <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> feel bad for him." [...] Killian Fox of The Observer reported that the song {{was one of the}} few times on the album when Ocean was actively courting heavy radio play, describing Sweet Life as a [...] "near-perfect distillation of every blissed-out summer jam from Stevie Wonder onwards." [...] Amy Dawson, critic for Metro, called the composition [...] "an irresistibly warm slice of old-school funk." ...|$|E
500|$|Louise Nevelson {{has been}} a {{fundamental}} key in the feminist art movement. Credited with triggering the examination of femininity in art, Nevelson challenged the vision of what type of art women would be creating with her dark, monumental, masculine and totem-like artworks. Nevelson believed that art reflected the individual, not [...] "masculine-feminine labels", and chose to take on her role as an artist, not specifically a female artist. Reviews of Nevelson's works in the 1940s wrote her off as just a woman artist. A reviewer of her 1941 exhibition at Nierendorf Gallery stated: [...] "We learned the artist is a woman, in time to check our enthusiasm. Had it been otherwise, we might have hailed these sculptural expressions as by surely a great figure among moderns." [...] Another review was similar in its sexism: [...] "Nevelson is a sculptor; she comes from Portland, Maine. You'll deny both these facts and <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> insist Nevelson is a man, when you see her Portraits in Paint, showing this month at the Nierendorf Gallery." ...|$|E

500|$|Scott {{has said}} he {{believes}} the underlying emotion of Hannibal is [...] "affection". [...] "In some instances, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> wonder or certainly from one direction—is it more than affection? It is dark, because the story is of course essentially dark, but it's kind of romantic at the same time." [...] Scott openly admits to a [...] "romantic thematic" [...] running though the film. He told CNN that: [...] "Hannibal was quite a different target, essentially a study between two individuals. Funny enough, it's rather romantic and also quite humorous, but also there's some quite bad behaviour as well." [...] During the opera scene in Florence, Lecter attends an operatic adaptation of one of Dante's sonnets, and meets with Detective Pazzi and his wife, Allegra. She asks Lecter, [...] "Do you believe a man could become so obsessed by a woman after a single encounter?" [...] Lecter replies: [...] "Yes, I believe he could... but would she see through the bars of his plight and ache for him?" [...] This scene, in the film, is one which Scott claims most people [...] "missed" [...] the meaning of. It was in reference to Starling—to their encounter in The Silence of the Lambs. The New York Times, in its review of the film, said Hannibal, [...] "toys" [...] with the idea of [...] "love that dare not speak its name". Composer Hans Zimmer believes there to be [...] "many" [...] messages and subtext in each scene of the film. He said, [...] "I can score this movie truly as a Freudian archetypal beauty and the beast fairy tale, as a horror movie, as the most elegant piece, on corruption in the American police force, as the loneliest woman on earth, the beauty in renaissance..." [...] Zimmer ultimately believes it to be a dark love story, centering on two people who should never be together—a modern day Romeo and Juliet. During the film's post-production, Scott, Zimmer and the editor passionately argued about what a single shot meant, where a tear slides down Starling's cheek during a confrontation with Lecter. They could not agree if it was a tear of [...] "anguish", [...] "loneliness" [...] or [...] "disgust". Scott told the New York Post that, the affair of the heart between Lecter and Starling is [...] "metaphorical". Rolling Stone magazine even said in their review, [...] "Scott offers a sly parody of relationships—think 'When Hannibal met Sally'." ...|$|E

60|$|There--I {{had used}} strong {{language}} after promising I {{would never do}} so again; but the provocation was more than human nature could bear.

6000|$|... "You think you're kiddin' me, don't <b>you?</b> But I <b>might</b> <b>even</b> do that, if I wanted to," [...] he asserted, {{glaring at}} her as if he {{challenged}} contradiction.

60|$|This, {{coming on}} top of their other troubles, induced in the company a pretty {{unanimous}} silence--a solemn stillness, as <b>you</b> <b>might</b> say--which <b>even</b> Gussie did not seem prepared to break. Except, therefore, for one short snatch of song on his part, nothing untoward marked the occasion, and presently we rose, with instructions from Aunt Dahlia to put on festal raiment and be at Market Snodsbury not later than 3.30. This leaving me ample time to smoke a gasper or two in a shady bower beside the lake, I did so, repairing to my room round about the hour of three.|$|R

5000|$|Karan Anshuman of Mumbai Mirror gave 4 out of 5 stars, quoting [...] "Inkaar is {{not about}} office {{politics}} as <b>you</b> <b>might</b> imagine, <b>even</b> though many moments shape an accurate portrayal. It {{is not about}} {{sexual harassment in the}} workplace as it is being marketed though that is the searing crucible in which complex, often unnatural dollops of human emotion are left to sputter and interact, never coalescing. Everything else is an elaborate backdrop. And finally when the truth unravels - when motives come to light - I had a great urge to watch the film again. And with movies, this urge supersedes all flaws." ...|$|R

"Still, {{as trade}} is at a {{standstill}} at present, I {{think that it would}} be wise of you to accept any offer that the general <b>might</b> make to <b>you.</b> It <b>might</b> <b>even</b> be to your advantage, afterwards. To have served on Campbell's staff will be an introduction to every officers' mess in the country; and you may be sure that, not only shall we hold Rangoon in future, but there will be a good many more British stations between Assam and here than there now are; and it would be a pull for you, even in the way of trade, to stand on a good footing everywhere." ...|$|R
5000|$|The album {{generally}} received positive reviews. PopMatters critic Deanne Sole {{described the}} {{record as a}} [...] "half an hour of wordless Turkish psychedelica chilled to a nice consistency, being neither too heavy nor superficial." [...] Sole also stated that Özkent [...] "blends his Turkish folk influences so perfectly into the modernity of the psyche-jazz-funk that <b>you</b> <b>might</b> not <b>even</b> notice them unless you knew what you were listening for." [...] Keith Kawaii of Tiny Mix Tapes, who described the record as [...] "quite a slice of that time and a real artifact," [...] stated that it [...] "endlessly plods along, riding some kind of universal groove that crosses boundaries and borders just to get you moving." ...|$|R

As to this which lies before us, my brother Bridgenorth brings to it the simplicity, though not the harmlessness of the dove, and I the subtilty of the serpent. He hath the leading of saints who are moved by the spirit; and I can add to their efforts a powerful body, who have for their instigators the world, the devil, and the flesh." ...|$|R
