500|$|In 2001, Fiasco co-founded 1st & 15th Entertainment with Charles [...] "Chilly" [...] Patton. 1st & 15th is an {{independent}} record label separate from Atlantic Records named after the traditional twice-monthly paycheck dates. [...] Although his albums are released by Atlantic since he is under contract with them, most of his works are usually produced by 1st & 15th and its in house producers. Although Fiasco was initially to serve as vice-president, he became CEO after Patton was convicted on drug charges. Fiasco and singer Matthew Santos {{were two of the}} most recognizable signed artists. In November 2009, Fiasco announced he would discontinue the 1st & 15th label: [...] "It was just such a 'this isn't right for <b>you</b> <b>right</b> <b>now.</b> This isn't gonna work for <b>you</b> <b>right</b> <b>now.</b> You need to be focused on you. Do you really want that, do you really have the capacity to do it?'" [...] In March 2013 Fiasco took to Twitter to announce that he had become the Creative Director at Higi, a scoring system based in the Chicago area that helps you to discover more about yourself so you can look, live and feel better.|$|E
500|$|According to Kubrick's {{brother-in-law}} Jan Harlan, {{the director}} was adamant the trims were {{never to be}} seen, and that he burned the negatives, which he had kept in his garage, shortly before his death. This was confirmed by former Kubrick assistant Leon Vitali: [...] "I'll tell <b>you</b> <b>right</b> <b>now,</b> okay, on Clockwork Orange, The Shining, Barry Lyndon, some little parts of 2001, we had thousands of cans of negative outtakes and print, which we had stored in an area at his house where we worked out of, which he personally supervised the loading of it to a truck and then I went down to a big industrial waste lot and burned it. That's what he wanted." ...|$|E
500|$|Adam Kesher (Justin Theroux) is {{established}} in the first portion of the film as a [...] "vaguely arrogant", but apparently successful, director who endures one humiliation after another. Theroux said of his role, [...] "He's sort of the one character in the film who doesn't know what the [...] going on. I think he's the one guy the audience says, 'I'm kind of like <b>you</b> <b>right</b> <b>now.</b> I don't know why you're being subjected to all this pain. After being stripped of creative control of his film, he is cuckolded by the pool cleaner (played by Billy Ray Cyrus), and thrown {{out of his own}} opulent house above Hollywood. After he checks into a seedy motel and pays with cash, the manager arrives to tell him that his credit is no good. Witnessed by Diane, Adam is pompous and self-important. He is the only character whose personality does not seem to change completely from {{the first part of the}} film to the second. One analysis of Adam's character contends that because he capitulated and chose Camilla Rhodes for his film, that is the end of Betty's cheerfulness and ability to help Rita, placing the blame for her tragedy on the representatives of studio power.|$|E

500|$|In late 1997, Bruce took Myzery to St.Andrew's Hall. Eminem, then {{an unknown}} local emcee, {{approached}} Bruce and, according to Bruce, {{handed him a}} flyer advertising the release party for the Slim Shady EP. The flyer read, [...] "Featuring appearances by Esham, Kid Rock, and ICP (maybe)". Bruce asked why Eminem was promoting a possible Insane Clown Posse appearance without first contacting the group. Bruce said that Eminem explained, [...] "It says 'maybe.' Maybe you will be there; I don't know. That's why I'm asking <b>you</b> <b>right</b> <b>now.</b> You guys comin' to my release party, or what?" [...] Bruce, upset over not being consulted, responded, [...] "Fuck no, I ain't coming to your party. We might have, if you would've asked us first, before putting us on the fuckin' flyer like this." [...] Bruce reported that Eminem attacked the group in radio interviews. Bruce and Utsler first responded by referring to Eminem's alter ego as [...] "Slim Anus" [...] on [...] "85 Bucks An Hour" [...] from Twiztid's 1997 debut, Mostasteless, and later in 1999 releasing a parody of Eminem's [...] "My Name Is" [...] entitled [...] "Slim Anus". Barbs between Insane Clown Posse and Eminem continued until the feud was ended in 2005 by hip hop group D12 and Psychopathic Records.|$|E

2500|$|On June 4, 2012, Busch feuded with Justin Allgaier at the Nationwide {{event at}} Dover and {{after talking to}} his boss and brother Kyle. When asked by Bob Pockrass about being on probation, Busch said, [...] "It refrains me from not beating {{the shit out of}} <b>you</b> <b>right</b> <b>now</b> because you ask me stupid questions. But since I'm on probation, I suppose that's {{improper}} to say as well. If you can talk about racing things, we'll talk about many things, Bob. It is not racing, you're here just to start stuff, you know that's you're all out here for!" [...] NASCAR immediately suspended Busch from the Pocono race as a result for violating their policy forbidding swearing publicly.|$|E
2500|$|After the 2012 5-hour Energy 200, Busch, who {{was already}} on {{probation}} following the above altercation with Newman at Darlington, was upset with Justin Allgaier after a close call during the race. After the race, Bob Pockrass, a reporter with the Sporting News, asked Busch if being on probation made an impact during the Nationwide Series race. Busch replied [...] "It refrains me from not beating {{the shit out of}} <b>you</b> <b>right</b> <b>now</b> because you ask me stupid questions. But since I'm on probation, I suppose that's improper to say as well." [...] On June 4, NASCAR suspended Busch for both the upcoming tire test and the Pocono 400 at Pocono Raceway, and extended his probation though December 31, 2012. For this race, Busch's car was driven by David Reutimann, who finished in 21st place on the lead lap.|$|E

They {{are brought to}} the chief, who says, [...] "We are going to eat <b>you</b> <b>right</b> <b>now.</b> But I am a civilized man, I studied human rights at the Patrice Lumumba University in Moscow, so I'll grant each of you a last request." [...] The German asks for a mug of beer and a bratwurst. He gets it, and then the cannibals eat him. The Frenchman asks for three girls. He has crazy sex with them, and then suffers {{the fate of the}} German. The Russian demands: [...] "Hit me hard, right on my nose!" [...] The chief is surprised, but hits him. The Russian pulls out a Kalashnikov and shoots all the cannibals. The mortally-wounded chief asks him: [...] "Why didn't you do this before we ate the German?"

2500|$|By the {{following}} morning, both men reasoned {{that they would}} have to leave NBC, and O'Brien opened that night's show with [...] "We’ve got a great show for you tonight—I have no idea when it will air, but it's gonna be a great show." [...] Polone viewed the move, as a whole, a reactionary one by Zucker, concluding that he was acting in self-preservation, since NBCUniversal owner General Electric (GE) was in the process of negotiating the sale of a controlling interest in the company to cable operator Comcast. When a story ran that night on The New York Times website that Fox had an [...] "overt interest" [...] in O'Brien and was not going along with the plan, Zucker reasoned that Polone was to blame. The situation became heated when Zucker placed a call to O'Brien's agent, Rick Rosen, inquiring on the story and demanding an immediate answer from the O'Brien camp regarding the changes. Gaspin spoke on the situation at a previously scheduled press conference that Sunday, noting that [...] "I obviously couldn’t satisfy either with 100 percent of what they wanted. That’s why I came up with this compromise." [...] Zucker, upon hearing that O'Brien still did not take the proposal well, threatened Rosen: [...] "I'm going to tell <b>you</b> <b>right</b> <b>now</b> that I can pay him or play him. I can ice you guys." [...] On Monday night's show, O'Brien continued jokes on the subject; responding to thunderous applause, he joked, [...] "You keep that up, and this monologue won’t start until 12:05." ...|$|E
2500|$|National {{media outlets}} {{reported}} on an exchange between judge Harry Connick Jr. and contestant Quentin Alexander noting the incident of Connick scolding a contestant was awkward. On the live airing of the Top 6 show, there was three contestants {{who had not}} been saved when Alexander was chosen. After he performed, host Ryan Seacrest noted that he appeared to be upset. When asked Alexander responded [...] "This sucks, We've got two of the best vocalists, my best friend [...] sitting over there. This whole thing is whack, but I'm going to shut up right now." [...] Seacrest then replied saying that this is a competition, and with the save anything could happen. When Alexander had left the stage, Connick Jr. said, [...] "Quentin, if it's that whack, then you can always go home, because Idol is paying {{a lot of money to}} give you this experience and for you to say that to this hand that is feeding <b>you</b> <b>right</b> <b>now,</b> I think is highly disrespectful." [...] Alexander was then prompted by the producers to return to the stage where he approached the judges and clarified he meant the two being potentially eliminated was whack, not the show, or the experience. Later, after performing his second song, he explained [...] "I understand that these things are going to happen, and I just didn't want my friend to leave" [...] and apologized. Judge Jennifer Lopez empathized with Alexander's emotions running high but said that as an artist he had to learn to work through that even when it happens to put on the performance. Joey Cook commented after being eliminated on Alexander's statements: I pretty much just told him what he did was beautiful, in my opinion, and it was the perfect representation of him. Quentin is a very emotional person. He’s very 'all cards on the table.' There is no sugar coating. He doesn’t hide his emotions. He’s honest. He’s a raw human being, and I think what happened last night was the perfect example of that and how emotional of a person he is.|$|E
