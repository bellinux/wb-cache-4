50|$|Pay as <b>you</b> <b>throw</b> is a {{model for}} pricing the {{disposal}} of municipal solid waste by unit of waste rather than by charging a uniform price for pickup and disposal. This acts as a tax on waste - the more waste a household produces, the more it will be charged for its disposal. Pay as <b>you</b> <b>throw</b> is administered on the municipal level. The purpose behind this system is to discourage waste generation and to encourage recycling. By charging citizens per unit of waste, municipalities hope to discourage waste generation by causing households to consider the quantity of waste they are producing by making them pay for it. It is estimated that pay as <b>you</b> <b>throw</b> programs have decreased municipal solid waste by about 17% in weight, with a 6% decrease attributed to source reduction efforts and an 8-11% due to waste diversion to recycling and yard programs. In 2006, pay as <b>you</b> <b>throw</b> had been instituted in over 7,000 United States communities.|$|R
