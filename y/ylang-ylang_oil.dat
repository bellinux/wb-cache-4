40|$|Cananga odorata (Lam.) Hook. f. Thomson forma genuina (Annonaceae) is a {{tropical}} tree, grown {{for the production}} of <b>ylang-ylang</b> essential <b>oil,</b> which is extracted from its fresh and mature flowers. Despite its economic and social importance, very little information is available on its variability and the possible factors causing it. Therefore, the relationship between the genetic structure, revealed by amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), and the essential oil chemical composition, determined by GC/MS analysis, of ylang-ylang grown in semi-managed systems in three Indian Ocean islands (Grande Comore, Mayotte, and Madagascar) was investigated. Our results revealed a low genetic variation within plantations and contrasted situations between islands. Variations of the chemical composition could be observed within plantations and between islands. The genetic differentiation pattern did not match the observed pattern of chemical variability. Hence, the chemical variation could not be attributed to a genetic control. As Grande Comore, Madagascar, and Mayotte present different environmental and agronomic conditions, it can be concluded that the influence of these conditions on the <b>ylang-ylang</b> essential <b>oil</b> composition is consistent with the patterns observed. Finally, several strategies were proposed to valorize the chemical composition variations. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|<b>Ylang-ylang</b> {{essential}} <b>oil</b> is {{an important}} rawmaterial for the fragrance industry. Despite its economic importance, {{to the best of}} our knowledge, no study has yet been undertaken to assess the chemical polymorphism of the different production areas. This underestimated variability is an interesting source of raw material for perfumers. That is why the variation in the chemical composition of four fractions of the essential oils extracted from Cananga odorata, grown in four locations Grande Comore, Mayotte, Nossi Bé and Ambanja, was studied. A total of 119 compounds, representing 85. 7 – 96. 4 %of the total essential oil composition, were identified using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry and quantified by gas chromatography with a flame ionization detector. Thirty-two compounds previously unreported in <b>ylang-ylang</b> essential <b>oil</b> were identified. The distinction between the Comoros and Madagascar groups wasmade on the basis of the chemical classes. It was possible to significantly distinguish the Grande Comore and Mayotte essential oil samples, as well as the Ambanja and Nossi Bé essential oil samples, on the basis of their main compounds. The aromatic compounds profile for the origin of each essential oil fraction was established. Regression trees were built, allowing the provenance of the essential oils prepared at the laboratory level to be easily differentiated on the basis of a limited number of major compounds.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to combine the unique properties of magnetic nanoparticles with the antimicrobial activity of three essential oils to obtain novel nanobiosystems that could be used as coatings for catheter pieces with an improved resistance to Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae clinical strains adherence and biofilm development. The essential oils of ylang ylang, patchouli and vanilla were stabilized by the interaction with iron oxide@C 14 nanoparticles to be further used as coating agents for medical surfaces. Iron oxide@C 14 was prepared by co-precipitation of Fe+ 2 and Fe+ 3 and myristic acid (C 14) in basic medium. Vanilla essential oil loaded nanoparticles pelliculised on the catheter samples surface strongly inhibited both the initial adherence of S. aureus cells (quantified at 24 h) and the development of the mature biofilm quantified at 48 h.

40|$|In {{order to}} find sensitizers {{additional}} to the current fragrance mix (FM) a series of fragrance materials (series II) was evaluated in 6 dermatological centres in Europe. 11 of the test materials were essential oils, the remaining 7 being either mixtures of isomers or simple chemicals of frequent usage in the perfume industry. 1606 patients were consecutively tested with series II and 8 % FM. Each patient was classified regarding a history of adverse reactions to scented products: certain, probable, questionable, none. Reactions to FM occurred most frequently in 11. 4 % of the subjects. The 6 materials with the highest reactivity after the FM were <b>ylang-ylang</b> <b>oil</b> (YY) I (2. 6 %), YY II (2. 5 %), lemongrass oil (1. 6 %), narcissus absolute (1. 3 %), jasmine absolute (1. 2 %) and sandalwood oil (0. 9 %). 48 (3. 0 %) of the patients reacted only to materials of series II and not to FM. 6. 0 % of 1606 patients gave a history of adverse reactions to fragrances which was classified as certain. This group reacted to FM only in 22. 9 %, to series II and FM in 15. 6 % and to series II only in 5. 2 %. 63. 5 % of the patients reacting to both FM and 1 of the materials of series II had some type of positive fragrance history, which was higher in comparison to those with isolated reactions to FM (46. 2 % of 121) or to series II, respectively, (45. 8 % of 48).

40|$|Making {{money out}} of {{essential}} oils extracted from plants is like taking a magical mystery tour. ACP growers and producers need to {{meet a lot of}} conditions, but success can be sweet. How would you like your <b>ylang-ylang</b> <b>oil?</b> Steamed or squeezed or diluted, and then exported? Photos (top to bottom) : Corbis, Texarome, A. Rival It takes just a tiny drop of oil from the ylang-ylang plant rubbed into the chest, and the user is carried away on the wings of the scent. Sedated, restored, rested, energised, even seduced the effects are varied, and in the mind. The treatment known as aromatherapy - has physical effects, and can have subtle effects on the mind and emotions. Essential oils have been used for thousands of years, not only in aromatherapy, but also in perfumes, pharmaceuticals and food flavouring and, as a more recent innovation in bio-pesticides. The market is well-established, at an estimated 1. 2 billion per year. With the growing interest in healthy lifestyles in Europe for example, demand is rising steadily. Essential oils are found in the cells of various plant organs, ranging from the roots, bark and leaves to the seeds, fruits and flowers. There are more than 3, 000 essential oils known today, of which more than 500 are sold commercially. The term itself shows the importance attached to them: it is accredited to Paracelsus, a 16 th century physician, who believed that the oil extracted from a vegetable contained the total flavour. He described it as the quintessence, meaning the pure, highly concentrated essence of a thing. In ancient philosophy, the fifth (in Latin: quintus) and highest essence after the four elements of earth, air, fire, and water, was thought to be the substance of the heavenly bodies and latent in all things. Heavenly they may be, but essential oils are all around us. The oil of the clove leaf contains eugenol and is used in toothpaste, and the oil of the clove bud is used against toothache; the oil of citrus seeds is used in beverages; rosemary oil is used as a sedative. Good for employment The traditional artisanal methods of production, usually by distillation, expression and solvent extraction, cannot easily provide the consistent levels of quality demanded on the export market. Traders in essential oils are now demanding the use of modern, and capital-intensive equipment. The Phael Flor company in Madagascar, for example, had to invest more than E 300, 000 in industrial plant to produce export quality oils from organically grown geraniums, pepper, cinnamon, camphor, ginger, vanilla and cloves. The scale of their operation which accounts for less than 10 % of national oil exports - is impressive: they employ more than 50 people in their processing and distribution activities, and generate employment for several hundred plant producers upstream. As an agro-industry, the essential oil sector is an important contributor to a nation s agricultural economy, and balance of trade. This is well understood by several ACP countries: investment projects are currently underway in Benin, Ghana, Malawi, Mali, Rwanda, Togo and Zimbabwe. In Mali, for example, the UPROCOHE company is typical of start-up enterprises, having to deal with the standards set by the International Standards Organisation, with the need to obtain special packaging materials (since essential oils must not be stored in plastic bottles) and importing equipment. Other countries, ranging from Guatemala to Australia, are hoping to corner their share of the market and world competition will undoubtedly grow. Some ACP countries are already well established: in the Indian Ocean, the Comoros, Seychelles and Mauritius have significant production, although they are overshadowed by Madagascar, which produces more than half the world s clove essence and one-third of its <b>ylang-ylang</b> <b>oil,</b> from which it derives annual export earnings of E 5 million. It even exports ylang-ylang to Jamaica, where it is blended with locally-produced lemon grass oil. And Jamaica itself is well-placed with its virtual monopoly on the production and trade of allspice (Pimento officinalis). Fools rush in Great potential exists for many ACP countries to produce and market essential oils, but if the recent experience of Madagascar is anything to go by, a lot of work is required to get the sector operating smoothly. Between 1992 and 1997 millions of dollars were invested by local banks and companies: the World Bank, the UN Industrial Development Organisation, the ACP-EU Centre for the Development of Industry, and the German, United States and European development cooperation agencies. In the apparent gold-rush, dozens of enterprises were set up, but many failed through lack of attention to consistent supply of plant materials, quality control, plant diseases, and technology selection. One lesson learned was the need to better organise the sector with the assistance of a professional association, SYPEAM, which now provides support to producers through training and technical information. It is a rewarding, but exacting market to conquer, and one where quality counts. But there are abuses: because of the oils concentrated nature, unscrupulous traders sometimes blend in synthetic oils. Not only could this get noticed in quality inspections by purchasing agents, but it will also lead to rejection by customers, who believe that only natural products contain the life elements that are central to the oils invigorative or restful values. The market for essential oils is attractive, but it is also volatile, especially now that it is in fashion. Yet, if high standards can be maintained, it could reward you with the sweet smell of success.

5|$|Through {{the late}} 17th century, the various clans {{of the eastern}} coastal region were governed by chieftains who {{typically}} ruled over one or two villages. A zana-malata named Ratsimilaho emerged to unite these clans under his rule in 1710. His reign lasted 50 years and established a sense of common identity and stability throughout the kingdom, but his successors gradually weakened this union, leaving it vulnerable to the growing influence and presence of European and particularly French settlers, slave traders, missionaries and merchants. The fractured Betsimisaraka kingdom was easily colonised in 1817 by Radama I, king of Imerina who ruled from its capital at Antananarivo in the central highlands.

Ylang-ylang develops on many types of soils, under high temperatures and average precipitations of 1, 500 mm per year. The pollarding, the maintenance, the elimination of water sprouts and the weeding must be performed to insure a high flower yield and facilitate harvesting. Flower harvest takes place all year long but flowers and essential oils yields are higher during the dry season.
