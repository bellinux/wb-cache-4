500|$|Melua {{opened up}} about the {{breakdown}} years later {{in an interview with}} The Independent, saying that it ended up being {{one of the best things}} that had ever happened to her, as she said it helped to squash a feeling of superiority she felt by being a successful musician in the music industry. [...] "....It was petrifying, but it put a stop to fantasies of being able to do anything. The oddest thing about this job is the sense of superiority <b>you</b> <b>get.</b> <b>It</b> was a huge wake-up call. I was completely out of it for two weeks, and in hospital for six. There was a bunch of things going on, things at home and crazy work schedules, and you really believe the world revolved around you and it doesn’t." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with The Observer, co-creator Mark Gatiss says that they experienced more difficulty finding the right actor to play Dr John Watson than they had for the title character. Producer Sue Vertue said, [...] "Benedict {{was the only person}} we actually saw for [...] Sherlock... Once Benedict was there it was really just making sure we got the chemistry for John —and I think <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> as soon as they come into the room, you can see that they work together". Several actors auditioned for the part of Watson, and Martin Freeman eventually took the role. Steven Moffat said that Matt Smith was the first to audition unsuccessfully. He was rejected for being too [...] "barmy", as the producers required someone [...] "straighter" [...] for Watson. Shortly after, Moffat cast Smith as the Eleventh Doctor in Doctor Who.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to Bale breaking {{his hand and}} Worthington hurting his back, special effects technician Mike Menardis almost lost his leg filming an explosion. The sequence required a manhole cover being blown into the air, which hit Menardis and partially severed his leg. McG noted it was {{a testament to the}} gritty style of the film. [...] "I say with respect, I didn't want that Star Wars experience of everything's a blue screen, tennis balls, and go for it. I had Stan Winston build all the machines. We built all the sets, the explosive power, the explosive power so you feel that wind and that percussion and that heat blowing your eyebrows off. And with that, you get a couple bumps and bruises on the way, but <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> in an integrity and a realism that hopefully echoes Apocalypse Now. You couldn't say, 'Let's just shoot Apocalypse Now in Burbank, I think it's going to feel just as good.|$|E

500|$|Los Angeles Times {{reviewer}} Ann Powers {{stated that}} the song has a [...] "ragamuffin-style", and commented on the lyrics, [...] "Even as she offers herself in no uncertain terms'I'm gon' let you be the captain tonight' she sneersshe questions his prowess. 'Can <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> up? Are you big enough?' she repeats in the singsong chorus, making it tough to imagine that any suitor could rise to this occasion." [...] Bill Lamb of About.com praised the song, and called it [...] "the most instantly engaging song from the album Rated R", and that [...] " [...] projects a dominant female image {{that is exactly what}} was needed to move past the unfortunate Chris Brown chapter in her career". However, Lamb added that the [...] "icy feel is wearing thin. Rihanna sounds like she has taken a few steps back to distance herself from the whole song. There is a pleasing swagger, but we're never quite engaged".|$|E
500|$|Mansukhani later {{added the}} gay storyline {{because he thought}} it was an issue that needed to be touched on. However, the {{director}} did not want the film to be serious or preachy: [...] "I also realise that when you preach via cinema nobody wants to hear it". [...] "The film has a message, if <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>it,</b> great. If you don’t, no problem, sit back, relax and enjoy the film", he said about making Dostana a romantic comedy. In February 2008, Johar announced the film's title; the producer named it after a 1980 film produced by his father, Yash Johar. Asked if his film was also a love triangle, he replied: [...] "Well, yes and no. Though it's a love story, there's a never-before twist in the tale. All I can say on record is that we've never had a love triangle like this before." [...] The gay storyline was not disclosed until the trailers were released. Manan Sagar was hired to edit the film, and the duo Salim–Sulaiman composed the background score.|$|E
500|$|... "Rude Boy" [...] was {{produced}} by Rob Swire and StarGate who co-wrote the song with Rihanna, Ester Dean, and Makeba Riddick. During an interview on the television show, [...] in February 2010, Carr asked Rihanna about the song's lyrics, with particular emphasis on the line [...] "Come here Rude Boy, Boy, can <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> up?/Come here Rude Boy, Boy, is you big enough?" [...] Rihanna explained: [...] "When we wrote the song, {{it was kind of}} a freestyle...I liked the West Indian influence that the music had, and, I just went in the booth, they were already jotting down some ideas and, that came to me, I just ran in there with the, one of the writers and started coming up with this in the studio and now when people read it back to me like that, 'Come here Rude Boy, is you big enough'?, it does sound so disgusting!" [...] She also explained the development of the song, and said that those lyrics were originally going to be the introduction, but because of the song's infectious beat, Rihanna decided to make it the hook instead.|$|E

500|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, the album {{influenced}} post-punk band Joy Division as bassist Peter Hook related it: [...] "We {{were introduced to}} Kraftwerk by [...] Ian Curtis, who insisted we play Trans Europe Express before we went on stage every time. The tape was played at the venue over the PA system, to be heard by everyone. The first time was Pips [...] Ian got thrown out for kicking glass around the dance floor {{in time to the}} track. It took us ages of pleading to get him back in." [...] Drummer Stephen Morris also confirmed that Joy Division [...] "used to play Trans-Europe Express before we went on stage, to get us into the zone. It worked because it gets up a lot of momentum. Trans-Europe Express just seemed to express an optimism - even if people see it as machine music". Morris also said: [...] "It reminds me of Cabaret, the film, with all of the 1920s singing. [...] When you get that marriage between humans and machines, and <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> right, it's fantastic. I have to say it's my favourite Kraftwerk album." [...] In the mid-1980s, Siouxsie and the Banshees' rendition of [...] "The Hall of Mirrors", on their album Through the Looking Glass, {{was one of the few}} cover versions that [...] Ralf Hütter hailed in glowing terms as [...] "extraordinary".|$|E
500|$|After the song's release, critics heavily {{compared}} its {{lyrics to}} Eminem, and suggested Carey alluded {{to him and}} his 'obsession' with her. [...] "Obsessed" [...] never mentions the rapper's name, although reviewers felt it to be very obvious. The song begins with [...] "I was like, 'Why are you so obsessed with me?'", before the music begins. This line references the 2004 film Mean Girls. As the first verse begins, Carey describes the tracks' subjects constant lies: [...] "All up in the blogs sayin' we met at a bar / When I don't even, know who you are / Sayin' you up in my house sayin' you up in my car / When you in L.A. and I'm at Jermaine's". Additionally, the song suggests the stalker is under the influence of drugs: It must be the weed, it must be the E / 'Cause you be poppin', heard <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> poppin'." [...] During the chorus, Carey confronts her stalker, asking: Why are you so obsessed with me / Boy I wanna know / Lying that you're sexing me / When everybody knows/ It's clear that you're upset with me / Oh, Oh, Oh, finally found a girl that you couldn't impress / last man on the earth still couldn't get this." [...] During the song's second verse, critics complimented Carey's lyrics, highlighting phrases such as: You're a mom & pop, I'm a corporation / I'm the press conference, you're a conversation", [...] "suggesting the rapper isn't a worthy suitor".|$|E

2500|$|Mark Beaumont of NME gave it {{a rating}} of six out of ten, a higher score than the {{original}} album version review by the same publication, claiming that [...] "the Aussie rapper offers a slight improvement on her debut LP with this reissue." [...] Mike Wass of Idolator gave the album a 4/5 rating calling it [...] "as good an opportunity as any {{to acknowledge that the}} femcee's debut is actually relentlessly enjoyable," [...] adding that [...] "there isn't a dud track" [...] and [...] "of the other new cuts, [...] "Heavy Crown" [...] stands out as another future hit". Rory Cashin of State gave the album three out of five stars, commenting that [...] "the new additions are mostly winners," [...] but [...] "just like her first time out with this album, Iggy has a problem; trying too hard to please herself and please commercial radio." [...] David Jeffries of AllMusic, who had also reviewed The New Classic, gave it three and a half out of five stars and said, [...] "In the end, Reclassified is a better effort than The New Classic and offers more bang for the buck, but this [...] "release it until <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> right" [...] blueprint is concerning for consumers, who now have a choice between rebuying it all or seeking out the new numbers on their own." ...|$|E

Easing up on the darker S themes of her recent albums, 'Make Me' is a fun, breezy tune with an elastic disco beat" [...] adding that [...] "he chorus twists Michael's refrain into a Janet-worthy, sexy come-on, with the lyrics, 'Don't stop 'til <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> up'." [...] Clover Hope of Vibe magazine commented: [...] "Fun, rhythmic, buoyant—it's the type of rebound we'd hoped for with 2008's Discipline, where Jackson teamed up with Rodney Jerkins {{in search of a}} youthful edge that only seemed to date her. They got it right here though, as Jerkins taps into Janet's sense of fanciful pleasure, rewinding time in a Janet way." [...] Jerkins also had Larry Ryckman and Ari Blitz Master [...] "Make Me" [...] with AfterMaster HD Audio which gave it a uniquely powerful presence. Michael Menachem of Billboard magazine hailed the song as her best dance recording since [...] "All for You" [...] (2001). Noting the single's similarity to Michael Jackson's disco themed [...] "Don't Stop Til You Get Enough" [...] from Off the Wall, Menachem comments [...] " [...] isn't just Jackson's best dance song in years—it's a hit that would make her brother proud." [...] Glenn Gamboa of Newsday referred to the single as [...] "remarkably upbeat, blending a bit of the playfulness that has been missing in her recent work with a high-energy Euro-dance backdrop." ...|$|E

So there had to be a contrast. She fit it perfectly." [...] Additionally, Kingston explained the plot of the video to Rap-Up, commenting, [...] "The video is basically about this girl trying to play both of us and at the end... we end up both at the same place at one time, and she's left with a stupid look on her face." [...] Appearances are made by Bieber's friend, Christian Beadles, as well as rapper Lil Romeo and singer/actress Jasmine Villegas, whose appearance further fuelled media speculation Villegas and Bieber were romantically involved after a previous appearance in his music video for 'Baby'. Jocelyn Vena of MTV News reviewed the video, [...] "Here's the play-by-play: While Kingston and the lady in question are flirting out on the deck, Bieber is chilling inside. But, wait — there she is flirting with Bieber while Kingston is hanging out, wondering where she went. The fickle girl eventually leaves Bieber to chill with Kingston, and then — boom — there she is with Bieber again. And, well, <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>it.</b> Of course, the 'eenie-meenie-miny-moe lover' eventually gets caught. While she's chatting up Kingston, along comes Bieber, and her game is blown.
