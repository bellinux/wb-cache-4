But I tend to think instead of a parasitic worm that is boring through {{the eye of a}} boy sitting on the bank of a river in West Africa, [...] that's going to make him blind. And , 'Are <b>you</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> the God you believe in, who you also say is an all-merciful God, who cares for each one of us individually, are you saying that God created this worm that can live in no other way than in an innocent child's eyeball? Because that doesn't seem to me to coincide with a God who's full of mercy'.|$|E

"And presuming an {{innocent}} man {{to have the ability}} and not the will to do so, he is to be punished, to be ruined root and branch, self and family, character and pocket, simply because, knowing his own innocence, he does not choose to depend on the mercenary skill of a man whose trade he abhors for the establishment of that which should be clear as the sun at noon-day! You say I am innocent, and yet you tell me I am to be condemned as a guilty man, have my gown taken from me, be torn from my wife and children, be disgraced before the eyes of all men, and be made a byword and a thing horrible to be mentioned, because I will not fee an attorney to fee another man to come and lie on my behalf, to browbeat witnesses, to make false appeals, and perhaps shed false tears in defending me. You have come to me asking me to do this, if I understand <b>you,</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> the archdeacon would so advise me." ...|$|E

John Bull does abhor the crimes of John Chinaman. He is the quickest old gentleman at finding out faults that are his neighbours', and the slowest old gentleman at finding out the faults that are his own, who exists {{on the face of}} creation. Is he so very much better in this way than the people whom he condemns in their way? English Society, Miss Halcombe, is as often the {{accomplice}} as it is the enemy of crime. Yes! yes! Crime is in this country what crime is in other countries--a good friend to a man and to those about him as often as it is an enemy. A great rascal provides for his wife and family. The worse he is the more he makes them the objects for your sympathy. He often provides also for himself. A profligate spendthrift who is always borrowing money will get more from his friends than the rigidly honest man who only borrows of them once, under pressure of the direst want. In the one case the friends will not be at all surprised, and they will give. In the other case they will be very much surprised, and they will hesitate. Is the prison that Mr. Scoundrel lives in {{at the end of his}} career a more uncomfortable place than the workhouse that Mr. Honesty lives in at the end of his career? When John-Howard-Philanthropist wants to relieve misery he goes to find it in prisons, where crime is wretched--not in huts and hovels, where virtue is wretched too. Who is the English poet who has won the most universal sympathy--who makes the easiest of all subjects for pathetic writing and pathetic painting? That nice young person who began life with a forgery, and ended it by a suicide--your dear, romantic, interesting Chatterton. Which gets on best, do you think, of two poor starving dressmakers--the woman who resists temptation and is honest, or the woman who falls under temptation and steals? You all know that the stealing is the making of that second woman's fortune--it advertises her from length to breadth of good-humoured, charitable England--and she is relieved, as the breaker of a commandment, when she would have been left to starve, as the keeper of it. Come here, my jolly little Mouse! Hey! presto! pass! I transform you, for the time being, into a respectable lady. Stop there, in the palm of my great big hand, my dear, and listen. You marry the poor man whom you love, Mouse, and one half your friends pity, and the other half blame you. And now, on the contrary, you sell yourself for gold to a man you don't care for, and all your friends rejoice over you, and a minister of public worship sanctions the base horror of the vilest of all human bargains, and smiles and smirks afterwards at your table, if you are polite enough to ask him to breakfast. Hey! presto! pass! Be a mouse again, and squeak. If you continue to be a lady much longer, I shall have <b>you</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> Society abhors crime--and then, Mouse, I shall doubt if your own eyes and ears are really of any use to you. Ah! I am a bad man, Lady Glyde, am I not? I say what other people only think, and when all the rest of the world is in a conspiracy to accept the mask for the true face, mine is the rash hand that tears off the plump pasteboard, and shows the bare bones beneath. I will get up on my big elephant's legs, before I do myself any more harm in your amiable estimations--I will get up and take a little airy walk of my own. Dear ladies, as your excellent Sheridan said, I go--and leave my character behind me." ...|$|E

What should I do?’ The Buddhist monk says, [...] "Define 'wealthy.' [...] " [...] The young man answers, ‘I have millions in the bank and three apartments in central Beijing. Is that wealthy?’ The Buddhist monk silently holds out a hand. The young man says: ‘Master, are <b>you</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I should be thankful and give back?’ Instead of telling him to live a simple and happy life, the Buddhist monk replied ‘Tuhao, let’s be friends!” The joke implies that the tuhao’s wealth was so substantial that it even made a Buddhist monk greedy.|$|E

[...] In an interview with the Express, he also criticised Claude for giving him the [...] "unfair" [...] nickname of [...] "Tricky Dicky", feeling that he had misunderstood his behaviour and actions in the tasks that he had helped to win. Despite these criticisms, a news story released two days later, reported that he had decided to let [...] "bygones be bygones" [...] with these issues about Claude, after he jokingly stated - [...] "Claude, can we hug it out?" ...|$|E

A Model of the Social Function 2 In an effort to stimulate and guide empirical work within a functional framework. this paper provides a {{conceptual model}} of the social functions of autobiographical memory (AM) across the lifespan. The model delineates the processes and variables involved when AMs are shared to serve social functions. Components of the model include: lifespan contextual influences, the qualitative characteristics of memory (emotionality and level of detail recalled), the speaker’s characteristics (age, gender, and personality), the familiarity and similarity of the listener to the speaker, the level of responsiveness during the memory sharing process, {{and the nature of}} the social relationship in which the memory sharing occurs (valence and length of the relationship). These components are shown to influence the type of social function served and, or, the extent to which social functions are served. Directions for future empirical work to substantiate the model and hypotheses derived from the model are provided...|$|E
