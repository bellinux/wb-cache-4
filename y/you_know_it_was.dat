And, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a major problem. A flat tire's nothing compared to that. And everybody who would pass would laugh and think it was so funny you know, me stumbling along.|$|E

Someone asked me to write a song and they told me the story, and <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> kind of a moving concept or whatever. And I did it, and I was like you know it’s not necessarily what I like per se, but after doing the song over and over again and having people coming up to and saying, thank you for writing ‘Hero’ because it saved my life or it saved my father’s life or my brothers or sisters life, or something of that nature, I said I always have to sing that song when I’m performing because if I don’t, you never know who I’m leaving out and you know what, in times of my life I’ve had to turn to that song lyrically and flip it onto my own life and sing it to myself. So its from the ‘Music Box’ album, and it’s called ‘Hero', this is for you." ...|$|E
500|$|Rowland has {{acknowledged}} {{on several occasions}} that although she loved dance music, it was not really the type of music she would record. While in Europe in 2008, she met Guetta {{at one of his}} DJ shows in Southern France and commented that [...] "Listening to him was just crazy." [...] Guetta was playing the instrumental version of [...] "When Love Takes Over". Recalling that it brought tears to her eyes, Rowland remarked, [...] "I felt so much emotion from the track; something happened the first time I heard it, and it was just beautiful. And I remember thinking 'Why is this touching me like this?' <b>You</b> <b>know,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> like there was a kinda soul-tie to it!" [...] Upon meeting Guetta, she asked him for the song so she could write its lyrics. [...] "So I met David and asked him for the track... He gave it to me, and I brought it back here to London, UK and wrote the actual song". At a writing session in a London hotel room, Rowland and songwriting duo Nervo wrote the lyrics and melody over Guetta's backing track. Rowland later joined Guetta and Julie Terry Lefèvre-Han in the recording studio to finish off the song.|$|E

2500|$|After several false {{starts and}} stops, the band began {{recording}} ...Like Clockwork in August 2012, initially hoping that collaborator Trent Reznor would produce the album.

2500|$|In 1980, Lennon talked further {{about the}} song: [...] "'Yellow Submarine' is Paul's baby. Donovan {{helped with the}} lyrics. I helped with the lyrics too.

[...] Donovan added the words, [...] "Sky of blue and sea of green". McCartney also said: [...] "It's a happy place, that's all. <b>You</b> <b>know,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> just...

Silverman began dating Welsh actor Michael Sheen in January 2014.|$|E
2500|$|The band {{went into}} the studio in December 2012 to start {{recording}} their album. Between December 2 and 6, the band had recorded drum tracks for the album at the London Bridge Studio, where the band had previously recorded Q2K and part of Dedicated to Chaos. La Torre, who {{is first and foremost}} a drummer before being a singer, recalled about his experiences during these sessions: [...] "I was a huge fan of Scott , so {{to be a part of}} that process, watching him actually record the drums on an album that I'm a part of, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> like a kid at Disneyland."

2500|$|After {{graduating from}} Bowdoin with a B.A. in Government and a minor in Asian Studies in 2004, Kondabolu had no {{intention}} of pursuing a stand-up comedy career. He moved to Seattle and took the LSAT preparatory to applying to law school, and worked as an immigrant rights organizer in Seattle for the organization Hate Free Zone (later renamed as OneAmerica) from 2005 to 2007. As part of Hate Free Zone's [...] "Liberty and Justice for All", he led a monthly conversation project focusing on immigration and human rights, saying, [...] "Grassroots organizers know; intimate meetings and real dialogue can cut through the cacophony like nothing else." [...] He found his organizing work fulfilling:I loved organizing, and, you know, I was working with victims of hate crimes, I was doing some work in detention centers and meeting families whose - you know, who had family members who were going to be deported, and, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> really powerful, workplace discrimination cases...Although his stand-up comedy career was gaining traction in 2007, he was accepted to the Masters in Human Rights program at the London School of Economics in 2007, and thus took a hiatus year from stand-up to earn his MSc.|$|E
2500|$|A {{few years}} later, Vanessa Williams (Miss New York 1983) won {{the title of}} Miss America 1984 on September 17, 1983, making her the first African American woman to wear the crown. Williams later commented that {{she was one of}} five {{minority}} contestants that year, noting that ballet dancer Deneen Graham [...] "had already had a cross burned on her front yard because she was the first black Miss North Carolina [...]" [...] She also pointed out that [...] "Suzette Charles was the first runner-up, and she was biracial.

[...] Williams' reign as Miss America was not without its challenges and controversies, however. For the first time in pageant history, a reigning Miss America was the target of death threats and hate mail. Williams was forced to resign seven weeks prior to the end of her time as Miss America, however, after the unauthorized publication of nude photos in Penthouse.

2500|$|The 1970 film Tristana is a {{film about}} {{a young woman who}} is seduced and {{manipulated}} by her guardian, who attempts to thwart her romance with a young artist and who eventually induces her to marry him after she loses one of her legs due to a tumor. It has been considered by scholar Beth Miller the least understood of Buñuel's films, and consequently one of the most underrated, due to a [...] "consistent failure to apprehend its political and, especially, its socialist-feminist statement". Buñuel had wanted to make a film of Benito Pérez Galdós' novel Tristana as early as 1952, even though he considered Galdós' book the author's weakest, in Buñuel's words: [...] "of the 'I love you, my little pigeon' genre, very kitsch". After finishing Viridiana and {{in the wake of the}} scandal its release caused in 1962, the Spanish censor flatly turned down this project, and Buñuel had to wait for 8 years before he could receive backing from the Spanish production company Epoca Films. The censors had threatened to deny permission for the film on the grounds that it encouraged duelling, so Buñuel had to approach the subject matter very gingerly, in addition to making concessions to his French/Italian/Spanish producers, who insisted on casting two of the three primary roles with actors not of Buñuel's choosing: Franco Nero and Catherine Deneuve. On this occasion, however, Deneuve and Buñuel had a more mutually satisfactory working relationship, with Deneuve telling an interviewer, [...] "but in the end, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> actually rather a wonderful shoot. Tristana is one of my favorite films. Personally, as an actress, I prefer Tristana to Belle de Jour." ...|$|E

2500|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1979 {{the band}} felt {{confident}} enough to start recording their songs, and approached local musician Bob Lamb as {{he was the only}} person they knew with any recording experience. Lamb had been the drummer with the Steve Gibbons Band for much of the 1970s and was a well-known figure within the Birmingham music scene. He remembered that [...] "'King' was the very first song they ever played to me, and it just blew my mind basically, to realise a bunch of kids could make a sound like that... it blew me away. And that was it for me, I was hooked, it was a bit like Elvis walks in or something, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> one of those moments." [...] However, as the band were unable to afford a proper recording studio, the album was recorded in Lamb's own home at the time, a ground-floor flat in a house on Cambridge Road in Birmingham's Moseley district that later became affectionately known as the [...] "Home of the Hits". Lamb would later use the money he earned from the album's success to build a proper recording studio, Highbury Studio, in an old cricket bat factory in nearby Kings Heath, which remained under his ownership until his retirement in 2010 – during the 1980s and 90s he would go on to produce the early demos for Duran Duran and work on the debut albums by fellow Birmingham natives Ruby Turner, The Lilac Time and Ocean Colour Scene. However, in an interview to mark Signing Offs 30th anniversary, Brian Travers recalled just how basic the recording facilities of the original Cambridge Road [...] "studio" [...] really were: ...|$|E
