25|$|You shouldn't make friends. It's not a {{good thing}} to be friends with people you're covering. There's just no point in doing it. It's tempting, but they're not going to {{consider}} <b>you</b> <b>their</b> friend anyway. They just know that you're somebody that can do something for them. So you shouldn't really flatter yourself that they want to be your buddy. They don't... They want you for some reason or other, {{and you just have to}} fend that off all the time. And you can't really cover people critically that you're friends with. How would that work? That would be bad. So you always have to keep that in mind.|$|E

500|$|There {{are many}} {{indications}} of close relations between Kent and the Franks. Æthelberht's marriage to Bertha certainly connected the two courts, {{although not as}} equals: the Franks {{would have thought of}} Æthelberht as an under-king. There is no record that Æthelberht ever accepted a continental king as his overlord and, as a result, historians are divided on {{the true nature of the}} relationship. Evidence for an explicit Frankish overlordship of Kent comes from a letter written by Pope Gregory the Great to Theuderic, king of Orléans, and Theudebert, king of Metz. The letter concerned Augustine's mission to Kent in 597, and in it Gregory says that he believes [...] "that you wish your subjects in every respect to be converted to that faith in which <b>you,</b> <b>their</b> kings and lords, stand". It may be that this is a papal compliment, rather than a description of the relationship between the kingdoms. It also has been suggested that Liudhard, Bertha's chaplain, was intended as a representative of the Frankish church in Kent, which also could be interpreted as evidence of overlordship.|$|E

2500|$|The last {{sign of the}} Zodiac, the Pisces symbol {{has been}} {{said to be a}} {{representation}} of the difficulty in extracting the good from that which appears bad. The moral of the symbol for Pisces is said to be that [...] "the severe season has passed; though your flocks, as yet, do not yield their store, the ocean and rivers are open to <b>you,</b> <b>their</b> inhabitants are placed within your power." [...] It is generally considered a feminine sign, and colors that have been used to represent the Pisces sign are gray or blue gray. The body parts associated with Pisces are the feet, or the toes. Likewise, astrologists also associate various diseases of the body with the zodiac, and Pisces' diseases are those of the feet. This includes gout, lameness, distempers, and sores. Excess of eating and drinking, as well as poisoning related to the consumption of fish and medicines are also shown in Pisces.|$|E

So I just basically did it, and I didn't tell anybody, whereas the process before was, I would tell people that I was getting ready to do it, then we would gear up to do it, and then people would get involved, and the credit would go wherever. So I just didn't tell a single soul I was doing it, I just did it in my own studio, and it was great." ...|$|E
