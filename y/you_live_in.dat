25|$|Most mammals such as calves, sheep, goats, foals, pigs, cats, cavies, rats, {{mice and}} humans can be infested by the Australian Paralysis Tick. Fatalities {{resulting}} from a single engorged adult female tick are mostly reported in the young animals of the larger species and all ages and sizes of the pet species (dogs and cats). Larvae and nymphs can also produce toxic reactions in the host. Fifty larvae or five nymphs can kill a 40g rat, larger numbers of either can induce paralysis in dogs and cats. They can be quite easy to find on short-haired animals, but very difficult to find on long-haired animals like Persian cats. If <b>you</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> a tick-prone area, and your pets are allowed outdoors, {{it is suggested that}} you physically check your pets daily for ticks. Unfortunately they are often not discovered until the tick is large enough to be felt. By this time the tick has subjected the animal to a large amount of toxins. One adult female can kill four susceptible rats during engorgement. Although it is not typical, an engorging adult female apparently can re-attach several times to different dogs.|$|E

If <b>you</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> open country, or have access at least to good pasture for cattle, a merlin can excel there. If you plan to hunt mostly in town or suburb, and especially {{if you plan to}} hawk from a car, I’d recommend the kestrel. [...] The consideration coming in at close second is your intended quarry. To snipe, dove, quail and open-country sparrows, merlins are best suited. For most blackbirds (Icteridea), either falcon can prove effective. Starlings in close are extremely vulnerable to kestrels; but in the open are best prey for merlins. [...] The same holds true for house sparrows, with this exception: sparrows in thick cover are better quarry for kestrels. This is the slip for which I feel the American kestrel is perfect." ...|$|E

500|$|Unlike {{previous}} Resident Evil games, {{which take}} place inside buildings, Resident Evil 3 {{takes place in}} Raccoon City. The developers noted that the city setting allowed them to create more varied environments. Capcom also decided to give the game a more action-oriented style, {{which resulted in the}} 180-degree turn and the introduction of a dodge feature so that the player can avoid enemy attacks. Additionally, the developers designed the game so that up to nine enemies can appear {{at the same time and}} improved their artificial intelligence to hunt the player up and down stairs. The eponymous Nemesis creature was inspired by the liquid-metal T-1000 Terminator from [...] According to Mikami, [...] "I wanted to introduce a new kind of fear into the game, a persistent feeling of paranoia.

Nico left the United States before she was officially released from Elektra, after a violent incident in a New York City bar. Biographers refer to her leaving the U.S. as an exile; Nico said, [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> a dangerous place, you also become increasingly dangerous.

The album was reissued as a CD in 1991 with two bonus tracks. Songs off The Marble Index have been included in Nico compilations, including The Classic Years (1998), Femme Fatale (2002), and The Frozen Borderline – 1968–1970 (2007).

2500|$|Like {{the other}} critics, Vendler recognizes {{the theme of}} time in this sonnet. [...] She expands on this by arguing that the sonnet {{revolves}} around the keyword [...] "live". [...] In quatrain 1, {{the focus is the}} word [...] "outlive". [...] In quatrain 2 it's [...] "living"; in quatrain 3 [...] "oblivious", and the couplet focuses on the word [...] "live" [...] itself. [...] However, this {{raises the question of whether}} the young man actually continues to live bodily or if only his memory remains. [...] There are references to being alive physically with active phrases like [...] "you shall shine in these contents" [...] and [...] "'gainst death and all oblivious enmity / shall you pace forth", and also to living in memory: [...] "the living record of your memory", and [...] "your praise shall…find room…in the eyes of all posterity".
