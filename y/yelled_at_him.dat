25|$|On December 29, 2015, Van Dyke {{pleaded not}} guilty to the charges. Van Dyke's attorney, Daniel Herbert, said that his client fears for his life. A few protesters <b>yelled</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> and called him names as he {{approached}} the courthouse for his arraignment. Van Dyke had a history of complaints in his police career but was cleared in most cases. After the arraignment, Herbert said he was looking for evidence to clear his client's name.|$|E
500|$|Despite these {{regional}} differences, Hampton credits Illmatic {{with providing}} a common artistic ground for rappers on the West Coast and East Coast rap scenes. In the 2009 essay [...] "Born Alone, Die Alone," [...] she recounts the album's impact on West Coast artist, Tupac Shakur. While {{working as a}} journalist for The Source in 1994, Hampton covered three court cases involving Tupac. Around this time, she received an advance-copy of Illmatic and immediately dubbed a cassette version for Tupac, who became [...] "an instant convert" [...] of the album. The next day, she writes, Tupac [...] "arrived in his assigned courtroom blasting Illmatic so loudly that the bailiff <b>yelled</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> {{to turn it off}} before the judge took his seat on the bench." [...] In her essay, Hampton implies that Nas' lyricism might have influenced Tupac's acclaimed album, Me Against the World, which was recorded that same year.|$|E
500|$|In July 1966, {{he began}} a thirty-month stint in France as a Mormon missionary, a {{traditional}} rite of passage in his family. He arrived in Le Havre, where he shared cramped quarters under meager conditions. Rules against drinking, smoking, and dating were strictly enforced. Most individual Mormon missionaries do not gain many converts and Romney was no exception: he later estimated ten to twenty for his entire mission. He initially became demoralized and later recalled it as the only time when [...] "most of what I {{was trying to do}} was rejected." [...] He soon gained recognition within the mission for the many homes he called on and the repeat visits he was granted. He was promoted to zone leader in Bordeaux in early 1968, and soon thereafter became assistant to the mission president in Paris. Residing at the Mission Home for several months, he enjoyed a mansion far more comfortable than the digs he had had elsewhere in the country. When the French expressed opposition to the U.S. role in the Vietnam War, Romney debated them. Those who <b>yelled</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> and slammed their doors in his face merely reinforced his resolve.|$|E

500|$|On {{the day of}} the shooting, {{the start}} of school had been delayed by snow and not all {{students}} had arrived when the shooting began. Just before 9:00 a.m. (UTC-8), fourteen-year-old student James Scott Newman brought his mother's [...]38-caliber revolver to the school in his backpack. He removed the concealed pistol from his coat pocket and loaded it with three [...]38 caliber rounds while in the bathroom. [...] He chose his target, student Alexander Rueda, 14, at random in a hallway outside the cafeteria. [...] Before he started firing, a friend of Newman <b>yelled</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> to put the gun away, but Newman told him to run. He pulled the trigger twice but the gun did not fire because those chambers were empty. He then fired three times at Rueda. [...] One bullet hit Rueda in the arm and torso, and another ricocheted and hit student Kenzie McKeon, 14, in the leg from the shrapnel. [...] The two injured students had no prior relationship or arguments with Newman. [...] Several students and teachers heard the shots and the physical education teacher, Jencie Fagan, approached Newman and challenged him. Fagan managed to convince Newman to drop his gun and then restrained him until more staff arrived to help.|$|E
500|$|Swift became {{inspired}} to write [...] "You Belong with Me" [...] after she overheard a male {{friend of hers}} speaking to his girlfriend through a phone call. He acted defensive as his girlfriend <b>yelled</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> and said to her, [...] "No, baby...I had {{to get off the}} phone really quickly... I tried to call you right back... Of course I love you. More than anything! Baby, I’m so sorry." [...] Out of the sympathy she felt towards him in the situation, Swift developed a concept for a song. In a writing session with co-writer Liz Rose, Swift explained the situation along with her idea and conceived the song's opening line, [...] "You’re on the phone with your girlfriend / she’s upset / she's going off about something that you said." [...] Together, they developed a story line, which described Swift being in love with the male friend and her having the desire for him to break up with his current girlfriend for her. Swift described the song's concept as [...] "basically about wanting someone who is with this girl who doesn't appreciate him at all. Basically like 'girl-next-door-itis.' You like this guy who you have known for your whole life, and you know him better than she does but somehow the popular girl gets the guy every time." [...] Swift recalled, [...] "It was really fun for us to write the line, 'She wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts'." [...] "You Belong with Me" [...] was first released as a promotional single from Fearless on November 4, 2008, as part of Countdown to Fearless, an exclusive campaign by the iTunes Store; the song was then released as the third single from Fearless on April 18, 2009.|$|E

In 1921, he joined Ted Healy in a vaudeville routine. [...] In 1923, Moe saw Shemp in the audience during a theater performance and <b>yelled</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> from the stage. Shemp responded by heckling Moe, and the two brothers' amusing bickering during the performance resulted in Healy immediately hiring Shemp Howard as a permanent part of the act.|$|E
2500|$|Gelman later {{stated that}} since {{he knew he would}} be caught, {{he was going to take}} down [...] "rats" [...] who had wronged him. Gelman then went to the house of a female {{acquaintance}} named Yelena Bulchenko, where he killed her mother, Anna, at about 10:30a.m. He then allegedly left the crime scene and waited several hours for Yelena, who had been staying at a friend's house, to return home. Once she did, she found Anna dead and called 9-1-1, but Gelman was on his way back to the scene to check if she returned home. Upon arrival at about 4:00p.m., he spotted her outside on the phone and got out of the car, upon which she <b>yelled</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> He hid the knife in his jacket sleeve and approached her, but she took off running. However, Gelman caught up with her and stabbed her eleven times, killing her, before speeding off in Kuznetsov's car. Ramming into another car, Gelman stabbed and wounded the driver, Arthur DiCrescento, three times when he confronted him, before carjacking the vehicle. Gelman later ran down 62-year-old pedestrian Stephen Tanenbaum, who subsequently died of his injuries.|$|E
2500|$|At this time, the Jinwu {{guards were}} in Hanyuan Hall, {{along with the}} Jingzhao Municipal {{government}} police under Luo Liyan and office of imperial censors' guards under Li Xiaoben, attacking the eunuchs. [...] More than 10 eunuchs were killed or injured, but this attack was unable to prevent the eunuchs from carrying Emperor Wenzong's litter through Xuanzheng Gate (...) , into the palace. [...] Li Xun, who was still {{holding on to the}} litter, urged Emperor Wenzong to stop, but Emperor Wenzong <b>yelled</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> to stop yelling. [...] The eunuch Chi Zhirong (...) battered Li Xun's chest, and Li Xun fell onto the ground. [...] The litter then entered Xuanzheng Gate, and the gate was closed. [...] The eunuchs were cheering. [...] The officers lined up at Hanyuan Hall paused for a moment, and then fled. [...] Li Xun, knowing that he had failed, put on a green uniform belonging to his staff members, got onto a horse, and fled, stating loudly on the road, [...] "What crime did I commit that I am exiled?" [...] No one on the road suspected him of being Li Xun. [...] Meanwhile, Shu Yuanyu, along with other chancellors Wang Ya and Jia Su returned {{to the office of the}} chancellors, and believed that soon Emperor Wenzong would summon them to deal with the aftermath.

2500|$|In all the noise, Pearson {{could not}} {{actually}} hear the reply to his question, {{so he decided}} to send a boarding team. At this point, once again, Jones’s preparation paid off. The boarders were met by a previously hidden defensive force, which swiftly drove them back to Serapis. By this time, the attempts to bring down Serapis’ main mast had also borne some fruit (ironically, the only reason why it had not fallen down was because it was leaning on Bonhomme Richard’s rigging). And then, perhaps about 10:15pm, Alliance returned, and Landais delivered another of his helpful broadsides. Jones’s men <b>yelled</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> to stop, and the commodore attempted to send orders for Alliance to help with a boarding operation. The moon was full, brightly illuminating the distinctive yellow livery of Serapis. Bonhomme Richard was clearly showing agreed lantern signals, but Landais stuck to his plan, sailing round the [...] "safe" [...] sides of the locked ships to fire broadsides aimed, in his theory, at both bow and stern of Serapis. In reality, Bonhomme Richard, yet again, was holed below the waterline and started settling so rapidly that the master-at-arms took it upon himself to release the hundred or so prisoners from previous captures, who had been held on the lower decks. As they had not been put in manacles, they were completely free and could potentially have helped Serapis’ crew to overrun the American ship. Jones reacted quickly to the new crisis, successfully urging the prisoners to put all their efforts into working the three remaining pumps to save their own lives.|$|E
2500|$|Late {{at night}} after the {{landlord}} left, Wanrow and Hooper became frightened, although they had the pistol with them. [...] They invited Wanrow's sister and brother-in-law to the house, who arrived with three of their children. [...] The four adults did not sleep {{in order to better}} guard against any possible aggression. [...] At about five o'clock in the morning, unbeknownst to the women in the house, Wanrow's brother-in-law went to Wesler's residence and accused him of pedophilia. [...] Wesler was intoxicated, and he and an associate were persuaded to return to the Hooper home to reconcile their differences. [...] As Wesler attempted to enter the residence, Hooper <b>yelled</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> to get out of there, causing some commotion. [...] Wanrow's three-year-old nephew awoke and began crying, prompting Wesler, who had by this time entered the home, to state, [...] "My, what a cute little boy". [...] Wesler made a move for the child, which upset his mother, Wanrow's sister. [...] An emotional situation developed during which Wanrow drew her pistol and shot and killed Wesler. [...] His associate was also hit, but he survived and fled. [...] Hooper called Crime Check (similar to 911), and the call was recorded. [...] During the conversation, the telephone was passed to Wanrow, who confessed to the killing and expressed a distrust of the police. [...] Although she was upset, Wanrow was not screaming. [...] The stereotype of a [...] "hysterical woman" [...] was used against her by the prosecution to persuade the jury that she was calm. [...] This recording was to play prominently in her conviction and in its subsequent overturn.|$|E
