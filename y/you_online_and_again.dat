40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to obtain {{empirical}} evidence of secrecy of disordered eating, body dissatisfaction, and body checking among non-clinical women. Female undergraduate students without a history of eating disorders (N = 212) completed questionnaires <b>online</b> <b>and</b> <b>again</b> in the lab a week later under the pretense that their responses were private or would be public. Changes in self-report from the online questionnaires to those completed in the lab indicated secrecy of the relevant construct. The results revealed that women are secretive about their desire to be thin, concerns with food intake, bulimic symptoms, body dissatisfaction, and body checking, but not about dietary restraint. Generally, women for whom appearance is a defining feature of the self, and who are low in fear of negative evaluation tended to be most secretive. Thus, it these women may have been most motivated and willing to engage in impression management...|$|R

40|$|This study aims {{to improve}} {{self-reported}} attachment anxiety and avoidance through an online relationship-building paradigm. Seventy-seven undergraduate participants completed an online attachment-focused paradigm {{in which they}} developed {{a relationship with a}} virtual partner, and fifty participants successfully completed a second laboratory-based phase of the study. During the online phase, all participants completed the Experiences in Close Relationships―Revised questionnaire (ECR-R), the experimental group engaged in an interactive relationship-formation story with a virtual partner designed to enhance secure attachment, and control participants engaged in the program without guidance. Participants then visited the laboratory, were asked to recall the <b>online</b> interaction, <b>and</b> <b>again</b> completed the ECR-R. Overall, participants exhibited a significant decrease in their attachment anxiety, but not avoidance; however, change in attachment security did not differ based on study group. Change in the experimental condition was attributed to the secure focus of the guided interaction with the virtual partner. Change in the control condition, on the other hand, was attributed to general relationship practice and behavioral principles of operant conditioning. These results provide preliminary evidence for the effect of a virtual practice relationship on attitudes towards real-life attachments to significant others...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, {{we propose}} and develop various {{statistical}} models to enhance {{and improve the}} efficiency of statistical modeling of count data in various applications. The major emphasis {{of the work is}} focused on developing hierarchical models. Various schemes of hierarchical structures are thus developed and analyzed in this work ranging from purely static hierarchies to dynamic models. The second part of the work concerns itself with the development of multitopic statistical models. It has been shown that these models provide more realistic modeling characteristics in comparison to mono topic models. We proceed with developing several multitopic models and we analyze their performance against benchmark models. We show that our proposed models in the majority of instances improve the modeling efficiency in comparison to some benchmark models, without drastically increasing the computational demands. In {{the last part of the}} work, we extend our proposed multitopic models to include <b>online</b> learning capability <b>and</b> <b>again</b> we show the relative superiority of our models in comparison to the benchmark models. Various real world applications such as object recognition, scene classification, text classification and action recognition, are used for analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of our proposed models. ...|$|R
