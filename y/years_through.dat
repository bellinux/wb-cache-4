5|$|Between 1970 and 1973, as a stop-gap pending {{delivery}} of the long-delayed General Dynamics F-111C swing-wing bomber, Nos.1 and 6 Squadrons flew leased F-4E Phantoms. No.2 Squadron continued to fly Canberras until it was disbanded in 1982. After taking {{delivery of}} their F-111Cs in 1973, Nos.1 and 6 Squadrons operated the type for 37 <b>years</b> <b>through</b> numerous upgrades, augmented in the mid-1990s by ex-USAF Gmodels. The forward air control unit joined No.82 Wing in 2002. In 2010, the wing retired its F-111s {{and replaced them with}} Super Hornets as an interim force until the planned entry into Australian service of the F-35 LightningII Joint Strike Fighter. Twelve Boeing EA-18G Growlers are scheduled to augment the Super Hornet fleet from 2017.|$|E
5|$|Haumea has an {{orbital period}} of 284 Earth years, a {{perihelion}} of 35 AU, and an orbital inclination of 28°. It passed aphelion in early 1992, {{and is currently}} more than 50 AU from the Sun. Haumea's orbit has a slightly greater eccentricity {{than that of the}} other members of its collisional family. This is thought to be due to Haumea's weak 7:12 orbital resonance with Neptune gradually modifying its initial orbit {{over the course of a}} billion <b>years,</b> <b>through</b> the Kozai effect, which allows the exchange of an orbit's inclination for increased eccentricity.|$|E

For the feat, Maryland Agricultural {{won the state}} championship. In 1914, the MAC tallied a 5–3 record. In intrastate play, the Farmers recorded wins over Johns Hopkins, St. John's, and Washington College, and a loss to Western Maryland. Once again, the team secured the state championship. The following year, Maryland met Johns Hopkins at Homewood Field on Thanksgiving Day, which drew the venue's all-time record crowd of 13,000 spectators.

Later, the location alternated between the River Cam in Cambridge and The Isis, over a distance of about 1,000 yards.

5|$|After he {{left the}} military, Barrowclough {{returned}} to his legal career. His law firm had suffered during the war <b>years</b> <b>through</b> a lack of manpower and the rebuilding of his practice occupied much of his time. In 1953, he moved to Wellington to take up an appointment as Chief Justice of New Zealand. The following year, he received an honorary doctorate in law from Otago. He also {{became a member of}} the Privy Council, was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George and was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II during her visit to New Zealand in 1954. While Chief Justice, he established the permanent Court of Appeal for New Zealand. After his retirement in January 1966 Barrowclough returned to Auckland where he died on 4 March 1972 at the age of 77. He was survived by three children. His wife, Mary, who he had married in 1921, predeceased him in 1964.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, Kippenberger was appointed to command the 20th Battalion. He led the battalion for two <b>years,</b> <b>through</b> the Battles of Greece and Crete as well as part of the North African Campaign before being promoted to brigadier and taking command of the 5th Infantry Brigade. The pinnacle of his military career was as commander of the 2nd New Zealand Division during the Italian Campaign. He was wounded on 3 March 1944 during the Battle of Monte Cassino when he stepped on a land mine. As a result of his wounds, he lost both of his feet. After recovery in England, during which he was fitted with artificial limbs, he helped prepare for and assisted in the repatriation of newly released New Zealand prisoners of war. In 1946, he was appointed Editor-in-Chief of New Zealand's largest-ever publishing project, the Official History of New Zealand in the Second World War 1939–45. He was still working on the project when he died on 5 May 1957 in Wellington.|$|E
5|$|In April 1966, Kerlan told Koufax it {{was time}} to retire and that his arm could not take another season. Koufax kept Kerlan's advice to himself and went out every fourth day to pitch. He ended up {{pitching}} 323 innings, a 27–9 record, and a 1.73 ERA. Since then, no left-hander has had more wins, nor a lower ERA, in a season (Phillies pitcher Steve Carlton did match the 27-win mark in 1972). In the final game of the regular season, the Dodgers had to beat the Phillies to win the pennant. In the second game of a doubleheader, Koufax faced Jim Bunning for the second time that season, in a match-up between perfect game winners. Koufax, on two days rest, pitched a complete game, 6–3 victory to clinch the pennant. He started 41 games (for {{the second year in a}} row); only two left-handers started as many games in any season over the ensuing <b>years</b> <b>through</b> 2016.|$|E
