40|$|Abstract. For {{the purpose}} of realizing fast and {{effective}} detection of defects of <b>yarn-dyed</b> fabric, and in consideration of the inherent characteristics of texture, i. e., color and structure, an approach for automatic defect detection is proposed in this paper. The image of <b>yarn-dyed</b> fabric to be enhanced is first converted from RGB true color space to L*a*b * color space. Then Log-gabor filters filter chromatic and brightness channels, and energy feature images are acquired after energy is fused between chromatic and brightness. Finally defects of <b>yarn-dyed</b> fabrics can be detected on the energy feature images using local binary patterns. The proposed method can detect colored and structural flaws. Experimental results for the defect detection from six kinds of <b>yarn-dyed</b> fabrics indicate that a high detection rate is achieved for the proposed method. It is fast enough to be possible for real-time application...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an efficient approach to solid-colour and multicolour region segmentation in real <b>yarn-dyed</b> fabric images. The approach {{is based on}} a novel model describing the spectral response of a multispectral imaging system to <b>yarn-dyed</b> fabrics. The model indicates that solid-colour regions cannot be distinguished from multicolour regions in terms of reflectance, tristimulus, or CIELAB values owing to a geometric term representing the influence of fabric surface condition on measured colours. The geometric term makes it difficult to determine the segmentation thresholds of CIEXYZ and CIELAB colour histograms. However, solid-colour and multicolour regions can be detected in CIExyY space because chromaticity coordinates are impervious to the geometric term. The CIExyY histograms of a solid-colour region accord with one Gaussian distribution, but those of a multicolour region accord with a combination of two Gaussian distributions. The CIEXYZ, CIELAB, and CIExyY colour distributions of both solid-colour and multicolour <b>yarn-dyed</b> fabrics were analysed in detail in simulation and real experiments. Experimental results show that solid-colour <b>yarn-dyed</b> regions can be distinguished from multicolour <b>yarn-dyed</b> fabric regions by the shapes of CIExyY histograms, but cannot be distinguished by the shapes of CIEXYZ or CIELAB histograms.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel unsupervised approach to detect dominant colour regions standing out conspicuously in <b>yarn-dyed</b> fabric images. For a dominant colour region of a <b>yarn-dyed</b> fabric, measured by an imaging system, its individual yarn has an irregular three-dimensional shape resulting in significant colour difference among pixels of the yarn. This difference leads to difficulty in segmenting yarns into dominant colour regions. A probabilistic model is proposed {{in this study}} to associate the colour of a dominant colour region with the colours of its yarns. Based on this model, the colour histograms of a dominant colour region are first estimated from those of yarns in a <b>yarn-dyed</b> fabric image. Then, a hierarchical segmentation structure is devised to detect dominant colour regions in the image. Experimental {{results show that the}} proposed approach achieves satisfactory performance for dominant colour region segmentation in <b>yarn-dyed</b> fabric images, with high computational efficiency.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel method for {{segmentation}} of weft and warp yarns in multicolour <b>yarn-dyed</b> fabric images. A multicolour <b>yarn-dyed</b> fabric is cross-woven by weft and warp yarns with different colours. When a multispectral imaging system {{is used to}} measure the colour of a multicolour <b>yarn-dyed</b> fabric image, its weft and warp yarns need to be detected before analysing their colours. Detection of interstices between weft and warp yarns is firstly conducted. A modified K-means clustering approach is then utilised to separate weft and warp yarns. The number of clusters is fixed to 2. The metric to measure the distance between a pixel and the mean of a cluster is the CIELAB colour difference. The initial means are determined by the expected values of fitted Gaussian distributions to CIExyY colour histograms. Experimental results show that the proposed method is promising for the segmentation of weft and warp yarns in multicolour <b>yarn-dyed</b> fabrics, with an improved segmentation accuracy and much faster processing speed than K-means clustering in CIEXYZ and CIELAB spaces.

40|$|With the {{development}} of computer technology, many researchers have tried to recognize the woven fabric param-eters by image analysis. Kang et al. [1], Lin [2] and Kuo et al.

Although image process-ing techniques for fabric are maturing, the focus is still mainly on the analysis of grayscale fabric images. However, in actual practice, the visual recognition for <b>yarn-dyed</b> fab-rics {{is as important as}} white fabrics, especially in sample analysis. It is highly desirable to develop an automatic detection approach for <b>yarn-dyed</b> fabrics using color image processing techniques. In the process of analyzing the <b>yarn-dyed</b> fabrics, two kinds of color information should be detected: (1) the number of yarn colors; (2) the layout of color yarns. It i...|$|E
40|$|In this study, a new {{detection}} algorithm for <b>yarn-dyed</b> fabric defect {{based on}} autocorrelation function and grey level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) is put forward. First, autocorrelation function {{is used to}} determine the pattern period of <b>yarn-dyed</b> fabric and according to this, the size of detection window can be obtained. Second, GLCMs are calculated with the specified parameters to characterise the original image. Third, Euclidean distances of GLCMs between being detected images and template image, which is selected from the defect-free fabric, are computed and then the threshold value is given to realise the defect detection. Experimental results show that the algorithm proposed in this study can achieve accurate detection of common defects of <b>yarn-dyed</b> fabric, such as the wrong weft, weft crackiness, stretched warp, oil stain and holes...|$|E
40|$|This paper compares colour {{matching}} of <b>yarn-dyed</b> fabrics by spectrophotometric and multispectral imaging techniques. While {{it is well}} known that multispectral imaging systems can measure the colour of fabrics that cannot be acquired by spectrophotometers, comparison of these two types of instrument has not yet been well explored. Colour measurements of 44 pairs of standard and batch solid-colour <b>yarn-dyed</b> fabrics by means of a Datacolor 650 spectrophotometer and an imaging colour measurement (ICM) multispectral imaging system were compared. Experimental results show that the ICM system has the capability to measure similar hue a* differences and larger lightness L* and hue b* differences than the Datacolor 650 spectrophotometer. When the tolerance of {{colour matching}} is set to 1. 0 CMC(2 : 1) (colour difference) unit, the ICM system can achieve the same colour matching results as the Datacolor 650 spectrophotometer, except for two dark samples.

40|$|The fabric {{weave pattern}} {{recognition}} {{process is a}} structure identification process that detects the yarn location {{as well as the}} yarn crossing structure in a woven fabric. A new local orientation feature is proposed for fabric structure detection by using high-resolution images. The detection process consists of two main steps. Firstly, the yarn location is detected through a series of image enhancement techniques and an edge-based projection method. Secondly, the yarn float is recognized with a local orientation detection approach based on Radon transform. Three kinds of <b>yarn-dyed</b> cotton fabrics are investigated in this study, including the single yarn, the double yarn, and the twisted yarn fabric. Experimental results and discussions demonstrate that the research method is effective in detecting fabric structure and yarn float even with long hairiness. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Broken silk thread {{is one of}} the {{numerous}} fancy yarns, and has been used in development of <b>yarn-dyed</b> textiles. However, the processing technology of traditional broken silk thread is very complex, and has restricted its wide application in the development of new textile products. Therefore, the aim {{of this paper is to}} develop a novel spinning technology of broken silk fancy yarn. Some examples of broken silk thread, which spun silk or cotton yarn is used as core yarn and binding yarn, polyester filament is as used as effect yarn, are spun on the ring fancy yarn twisting machine, and physical properties of these fancy yarns are tested and analyzed. The better technical program about choice of fiber material on the fancy component yarn and technological processes is put forward, and some tips on the operation are also given...|$|E

40|$|The Kalahari {{people live}} and work in the Niger delta of {{southern}} Nigeria. There are some twenty-two Kalahari island settlements dispersed among the Santa Barbera, Santa Bartholomew, Sombreiro, and New Calabar Rivers (Jones: 1963, Daly: 1983) with Buguma, Abonnema, and Bakana their most recognized commercial and cultural centers; though, many Kalahari are employed in the more homogeneous city of Port Harcourt. (Daly: 1983) Their location on the Niger delta favoured an economy based on fishing and trade. Originally, the Kalahari traded up-river for vegetables and grain in exchange for salt and fish. They also traded across the delta, most notably for textiles. Oral tradition suggests a five hundred year history of this trade in the Niger delta and beyond long before the Europeans arrived. (Eicher: 1988) When the Portuguese landed in the late fifteenth century, they found a well-developed trade network in place. (Alagoa: 1970) And {{with the arrival of the}} Europeans, the Kalahari had access to cloth not only from indigenous sources, but also from sources as far away as England and India. (Eicher: 1988). In terms of cloth manufacture, the Kalahari are unusual in the area because they do not produce their own cloth. They do transform an Indian madras by subtracting warp and weft threads, called pelete bite (Erekosima and Eicher: 1981); but, there is no evidence of spinning, weaving, or dyeing. (Eicher: 1984, Eicher, Erekosima, Thieme: 1982) However, they seem to have a history of being charmed by cloth. Renne suggests that it is because the Kalahari do not produce their own cloth that they are so enamored of it. (1986) In any case, the combination of geographic location and love of cloth for both its extrinsic and intrinsic values accounts for the large quantities of textiles accumulated by the Kalabari. From an economic perspective, it-was the-acquisition of the exotic, the unique and the hard-to-come-by — and lots of it — that was the most telling indication of the Kalabari trader 2 ̆ 7 s ability to negotiate a profitable deal. Of all the trade cloths that passed through Kalabari hands, it was the trade cloth from India that came to have the greatest material significance. Over time, these Indian trade cloths have been culturally authenticated (Erekosima: 1979, Erekosima and Eicher: 1981) into both ritual and daily life, demonstrating, in Schneider and Weiner 2 ̆ 7 s words, 2 ̆ 2 the capacity of cloth to encode kinship and political histories... 2 ̆ 2 (1986) One of the most significant of the Indian trade cloths collected and curated by the Kalabari is injiri. It is recognized by the West as madras plaid: a <b>yarn-dyed,</b> hand-woven fabric featuring plaid, striped, or checked patterns in blue/black, off-white, and red/orange combinations; though other specific shades are employed. Injiri was imported by Portuguese, Dutch, and English traders through the East India Companies to West Africa, possibly even from the earliest days of trade in the 14002 ̆ 7 s due to the Portuguese trading post empire. (Curtin: 1984) Significantly, the Kalabari also call injiri, this madras plaid, Real India...|$|E
