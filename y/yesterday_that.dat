5|$|It was objected <b>yesterday,</b> <b>that</b> {{there was}} no {{provision}} for a jury from the vicinage. If {{it could have been}} done with safety, {{it would not have been}} opposed. It might so happen that a trial would be impracticable in the county. Suppose a rebellion in a whole district, would it not be impossible to get a jury? The trial by jury is held as sacred in England as in America. There are deviations of it in England: yet greater deviations have happened here since we established our independence, than have taken place there for a long time, though it be left to the legislative discretion. It is a misfortune in any case that this trial should be departed from, yet in some cases it is necessary. It must be therefore left to the discretion of the legislature to modify it according to circumstances. This is a complete and satisfactory answer.|$|E

25|$|The Kanins wrote My Pal Gus (1952) {{in which}} Richard Widmark becomes {{a good father}} and {{falls in love with}} Joanne Dru, the Elizabeth Taylor film Rhapsody (1954) and The Opposite Sex (1956), a musical remake of The Women. But it was the Oscar-nominated script for Teacher's Pet (1958) for which they are best remembered, a film about a self-made {{newspaper}} editor Clark Gable who has a love-hate relationship with journalism teacher Doris Day. The film almost did not get made since the Kanins were not under any studio contract, and having shopped the script around without attracting any interest, it was only after a rewrite inspired by Garson Kanin's Born <b>Yesterday</b> <b>that</b> producer Bill Perlberg and director George Seaton purchased it.|$|E

25|$|Unlike {{the system}} obtaining under State control, when hauls wore left on deck until all {{operations}} ended, the method adopted was to place each haul of fish straight {{into a separate}} ice-house, and, to prevent-crushing of the lower layers of fish, each ice-house is divided into sections by removable shelves. This system also obviates the use of grappling hooks, which formerly tore {{the flesh of the}} fish, and so made large quantities unsaleable. Under the new system loading into the baskets is affected by a simple inclination of the shelves. Mr. Creamer, general manager of the Coastal Trawling Company, which controls the Koraaga, pointed out <b>yesterday</b> <b>that</b> the reduction of handling to a minimum must ensured the good condition of all fish. The ‘Koraaga, moreover, should show a profit with even moderate catches. The weakness of the State trawling enterprise was, in his opinion, the large administrative and storage expenses. The Coastal Trawling Company has entirely eliminated the latter. Arrangements were made for the landing of fish at the markets in as fresh a condition as possible. Voyages were cut short; bonus systems were introduced, which made it worthwhile for the crews to see that no damage was done in the stowage or unloading of their hauls. Unnecessary handling was obviated by all discoverable devices.|$|E

[...] In his memoirs, one of the guards at the Ipatiev House, Alexander Strekotin, remembered Anastasia as [...] "very friendly and full of fun", while another guard said Anastasia was [...] "a very charming devil! She was mischievous and, I think, rarely tired. She was lively, and was fond of performing comic mimes with the dogs, as though they were performing in a circus." [...] Yet another of the guards, however, called the youngest grand duchess [...] "offensive and a terrorist" [...] and complained that her occasionally provocative comments sometimes caused tension in the ranks. Anastasia and her sisters helped their maid darn stockings and assisted the cook in making bread and other kitchen chores while they were in captivity at the Ipatiev House.|$|E

2500|$|Adjoined {{relative}} clause. These languages {{have the}} relative clause completely outside the main clause, {{and use a}} correlative structure to link the two. These languages also have nonreduced relative clauses. Hindi is the most well known such language, and have a structure similar to [...] "Which man I saw <b>yesterday,</b> <b>that</b> man went home" [...] or (with non-fronting of the relativized noun in the relative clause) [...] "I saw which man <b>yesterday,</b> <b>that</b> man went home". Another example is Warlpiri, which constructs relative clauses of a form similar to [...] "I saw the man yesterday, which he was going home". However, it is sometimes said these languages have no relative clauses at all, since the sentences of this form can equally well translate as [...] "I saw {{the man who was}} going home yesterday" [...] or [...] "I saw the man yesterday when/while he was going home".|$|E

She wanted them to go, so that there'd be a message from the kitchen, but I knew that the message wasn't coming—that she was safe.
