500|$|... "Is It Scary" [...] {{generally}} received {{positive to}} mixed reviews from contemporary music critics. Jim Farber, {{writer for the}} New York Daily News, commented that [...] "Is It Scary' boasts a few innovative sounds but no real melodies". Roger Catlin of The Hartford Courant stated that [...] "the most intriguing pairing" [...] was [...] "Ghosts" [...] and [...] "Is It Scary" [...] because Jackson [...] "asks those who've only read about him in tabloids if he seems monstrous". Anthony , a writer for The Buffalo News, remarked that Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mixs songs [...] "Superfly Sister", [...] "Ghosts" [...] and [...] "Is It Scary" [...] were [...] "programmed plastic soul that makes <b>you</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> someone as talented as Jackson can churn out such tracks".|$|E
500|$|Leslie Felprin of The Hollywood Reporter {{praised the}} film as an [...] "affecting if {{somewhat}} soft-soaped comedy drama, elevated by excellent performances." [...] The Reporter wrote that [...] "Emma Thompson takes charge of {{the central role of}} P. L. Travers with an authority that makes <b>you</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> anybody else could ever have been considered." [...] Scott Foundas of Variety wrote that the film [...] "has all the makings of an irresistible backstage tale, and it's been brought to the screen with a surplus of old-fashioned Disney showmanship...", and that Tom Hanks's portrayal captured Walt Disney's [...] "folksy charisma and canny powers of persuasion— at once father, confessor and the shrewdest of businessmen." [...] Overall, he praised {{the film as}} [...] "very rich in its sense of creative people and their spirit of self-reinvention." ...|$|E
500|$|A major effect {{required}} {{throughout the}} episode was face replacements, {{especially during the}} 'May vs. May' fight where it had to appear as if Wen was fighting herself. All the effects were completed in the two weeks between the filming and airing of the episode. Wen noted that [...] "Kevin Tancharoen directed [...] and he’s amazing with his directing with the Mortal Kombat series. So we had this really complicated sequence where we do this 360 and it reveals me and it reveals me again and there’s no cut and <b>you</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> that happens {{in one of the}} fight sequences. And that’s because they completely scanned and CGIed my face onto the stunt double. So there’s a tremendous amount of work that went into the fight scenes and we did not {{have a lot of time}} to do it." [...] She also elaborated that [...] "On the day of, you have the set and you have the cameras, and you have to deal with special effects, because on top of everything else we had to scan my face and go through this incredible process of taking a million pictures so they were able to meld it onto Sam’s face." ...|$|E

2500|$|Anthony Violenti of The Buffalo News said of {{the lead}} single, [...] " [...] laced with Teddy Riley's new jack swing sound and a {{pounding}} techno beat". Violenti added, [...] "'Superfly Sister', 'Ghosts' and 'Is It Scary' are programmed plastic soul that makes <b>you</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> someone as talented as Jackson can churn out such tracks". He said of [...] "Morphine", [...] " [...] has more synthesized beats and quickly fades into Jackson's current indistinguishable style". William Ruhlman of AllMusic {{said of the}} lead track, [...] "'Blood on the Dance Floor' is an uptempo Jackson song in the increasingly hysterical tradition of 'Billie Jean' and 'Smooth Criminal' with Jackson huffing, puffing, and yelping through some nonsense about a stabbing...over a fairly generic electronic dance track." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine, also of AllMusic, had a negative reaction to the record. He said that all five new tracks were, [...] "embarrassingly weak, sounding tired, predictable and, well, bloodless". He described [...] "Blood on the Dance Floor" [...] as a [...] "bleak reworking of 'Jam' and 'Scream'".|$|E

60|$|In the Chinese bazaar are {{hundreds}} of small shops in which a miscellaneous collection of hardware and dry goods are to be found, and where many things are sold wonderfully cheap.

He bates a little, but not so much as the Klings, who almost always ask twice what they are willing to take.

The great physician has just gone away with two guineas in his pocket. One guinea, for advising me to keep her quiet; another guinea for telling me to trust to time. Do <b>you</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> he gets on at this rate? My dear boy, they all get on in the same way. The medical profession thrives on two incurable diseases in these modern days--a He-disease and a She-disease. She-disease--nervous depression; He-disease--suppressed gout.

Sunset is nothing to you—it merely happens anywhere. Oh, but you make me feel as if I'd like to make you suffer. If you'd ever been sick; if you'd ever been born into a home where there was something oppressed you, and you couldn't understand; if ever you'd believed, or even doubted, you might have been a man by now. You never grow up, like bulbs which spend all summer getting fat and fleshy, but never wakening the germ of a flower. As for me, the flower is born in me, but it wants bringing forth. Things don't flower if they're overfed. You have to suffer before you blossom in this life.

I dare not hope that I have inspired you with sufficient interest that the thought of me, and the affection that I shall ever bear you, will soften your melancholy and decrease the bitterness of your tears.

Guard, I entreat you, a firm persuasion of my sincerity in the inmost recesses of your heart {{out of the reach of}} the casual winds that may disturb its surface. Your temper is made unequal by suffering, and the tenor of your mind is, I fear, sometimes shaken by unworthy causes; but let your confidence in my sympathy and love be deeper far, and incapable of being reached by these agitations that come and go, and if they touch not your affections leave you uninjured." ...|$|E
