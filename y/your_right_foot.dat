By this time several of the Rangers had gathered round, and these foreseeing, from the appearance of the mule and the look of sly amusement {{in the face of the}} muleteer, that there was likely to be some fun, at once proposed to assist, which they did by giving advice to Sam of the most opposite nature. Sam was first going to mount on the off side, but this irregularity was repressed, and one wag, taking the stirrup of the near side in his hand, said, [...] "Now, Sam, up you go, never mind what these fellows say, you put <b>your</b> <b>right</b> <b>foot</b> in the stirrup, and lift your left over the saddle." ...|$|E

6000|$|Dear Reynolds--I escaped {{being blown}} over and blown under {{and trees and}} house being toppled on me.--I have since hearing of Brown's {{accident}} had an aversion to a dose of parapet, and being also a lover of antiquities I would sooner have a harmless piece of Herculaneum sent me quietly as a present than ever so modern a chimney-pot tumbled on to my head--Being agog to see some Devonshire, I {{would have taken a}} walk the first day, but the rain would not let me; and the second, but the rain would not let me; and the third, but the rain forbade it. Ditto 4--ditto 5--ditto--so I made up my Mind to stop indoors, and catch a sight flying between the showers: and, behold I saw a pretty valley--pretty cliffs, pretty Brooks, pretty Meadows, pretty trees, both standing as they were created, and blown down as they are uncreated--The green is beautiful, as they say, and pity it is that it is amphibious--mais! but alas! the flowers here wait as naturally for the rain twice a day as the Mussels do for the Tide; so we look upon a brook in these parts as you look upon a splash in your Country. There must be something to support this--aye, fog, hail, snow, rain, Mist blanketing up three parts of the year. This Devonshire is like Lydia Languish, very entertaining when it smiles, but cursedly subject to sympathetic moisture. You have the sensation of walking under one great Lamplighter: and you can't go {{on the other side of}} the ladder to keep your frock clean, and cosset your superstition. Buy a girdle--put a pebble in your mouth--loosen your braces--for I am going among scenery whence I intend to tip you the Damosel Radcliffe--I'll cavern you, and grotto you, and waterfall you, and wood you, and water you, and immense-rock you, and tremendous-sound you, and solitude you. I'll make a lodgment on your glacis by a row of Pines, and storm your covered way with bramble Bushes. I'll have at you with hip and haw small-shot, and cannonade you with Shingles--I'll be witty upon salt-fish, and impede your cavalry with clotted cream. But ah Coward! to talk at this rate to a sick man, or, I hope, to one that was sick--for I hope by this you stand on <b>your</b> <b>right</b> <b>foot.</b> If you are not--that's all,--I intend to cut all sick people if they do not make up their minds to cut Sickness--a fellow to whom I have a complete aversion, and who strange to say is harboured and countenanced in several houses where I visit--he is sitting now quite impudent between me and Tom--He insults me at poor Jem Rice's--and you have seated him before now between us at the Theatre, when I thought he looked with a longing eye at poor Kean. I shall say, once for all, to my friends generally and severally, cut that fellow, or I cut you-- ...|$|E

5000|$|Rohene Ward (aka Roh-roh) is {{the first}} and only skater (that I'm aware of) to {{successfully}} land all his triple jumps in both directions. Meaning: much like when a toddler is learning to write, they choose the left or right hand depending which one look and feels more natural. In figure skating it's the same type of deal, you learn the entry into your spins and jumps on <b>your</b> left or <b>right</b> <b>foot.</b> Often at times kids will play around in practise and attempt to do single jumps and spins on the opposite foot/entry because it's difficult, it looks silly and it's something to do with other skaters. Not only is this physically demanding to do and extremely hard to successfully achieve but it also take great mental strength to comprehend changing your technique in the opposite direction. Skaters work extremely hard on mastering a technique that works best for them. I am incredibly amazed that Rohene Ward has mastered the technique for both direction all the way through to his triple jumps. I've been actively in the skating world for the past 26 years and have only met & seen one person ever to do this and that person was Rohene Ward. He is a beautiful skater, a beautiful person and in my eyes the worlds best skater.|$|R

5000|$|A light jig is the second-fastest {{of all the}} jigs. The performer's feet rarely {{leave the}} ground for long, as the step is fast, {{typically}} performed at a speed around 116 at feiseanna. There are several light jig steps, varying with each dance school, but one step is almost standard in all light jigs. This step {{is known as the}} rising step, or the rise and grind. This is the right side version of it: Put your weight on your left foot and lift <b>your</b> <b>right</b> <b>foot</b> off the ground. Hop on your left foot once. Hop on your left foot again, bringing <b>your</b> <b>right</b> <b>foot</b> back behind your left foot and then shift your weight onto <b>your</b> <b>right</b> <b>foot,</b> leaving your left foot in the air. Dancers use the phrase [...] "hop, hop back" [...] for these three movements, and there is a slight pause between the hop, and hop back. The next movement is a hop on <b>your</b> <b>right</b> <b>foot.</b> Then you shift your weight on your feet, left-right-left-right. The phrase for this whole movement is: [...] "hop, hop back, hop back 2-3-4." [...] To do the step on the left foot, reverse the left and right directions.|$|E
