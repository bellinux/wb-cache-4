500|$|Some reviewers of the Macintosh Classic {{focused on}} the {{processor}} performance and lack of expansion slots. Liza Schafer of Home Office Computing praised the Classic's ease of use and price, but criticized the [...] display because a full US letter page ( [...] × 11inches) would not fit at full size, and warned those who required high-end graphics and desktop publishing capabilities against buying the Classic. Schafer concluded: [...] "The Classic's value is more impressive than its performance, but its performance will get <b>you</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> that novel, database, or spreadsheet." [...] PC Week criticized {{the lack of a}} faster processor, stating, [...] "The 7.8MHz speed is adequate for text applications and limited graphics work, but it is not suitable for power users. As such, the Classic is appropriate as a home computer or for limited computing on the road." [...] Similarly, PC Users review concluded, [...] "The slow processor and lack of expansion slots on the Macintosh Classic offset the low prices". MacWEEK described it as a [...] "fine, inexpensive replacement for the Macintosh Plus that best embodies the original Macintosh vision {{six and a half years}} later". Computer Gaming World was more skeptical, doubting that consumers would purchase a black-and-white computer with no hard drive that was only slightly faster than the Mac Plus.|$|E

The supergroup they formed, A Perfect Circle, began performing in 1999 and released its first album Mer de Noms in 2000. They released a successful follow-up in 2003 titled Thirteenth Step, a reference to twelve-step programs (many of the songs were written from the perspective of recovery). Both albums were eventually certified platinum. Their subsequent 2004 album, eMOTIVe, was primarily composed of covers, except for the singles [...] "Counting Bodies Like Sheep to the Rhythm of the War Drums"—a song inspired by [...] "Pet" [...] that was originally released on Thirteenth Step—and [...] "Passive". Keenan later characterized the record as a political album with which he [...] "tested the waters" [...] and was subsequently [...] "crucified" [...] for it because of the content. It was certified gold the month after its release. That same year they released the DVD and CD set entitled aMOTION, which was certified platinum within a month of its release.|$|E

Smith said, [...] "Sudden fame can be tricky when you are just out having fun and people keep wanting to take your photo, but the EastEnders people are very supportive and have said that we can politely say no in situations where we feel uncomfortable. I am very glad that my break came with EastEnders, as they are like a family who look after <b>you.</b> <b>Working</b> <b>on</b> the show has given me the chance to learn so much from the actors, especially {{those who are in}} my TV family. There are lots of things you can only learn from actually working on a set. The stage school I attend -also Singer Stage School - prepares you really well, but it is so different when you are actually there on set being filmed. Just a few things I have learned are how to read a script properly (not only my lines but stage directions and any acting I need to be doing in the background), how to work with adults in the workplace, which is very different from being at school, and lots of different wordswhich I didn’t know before such as"running up", [...] "turning", [...] "action" [...] and [...] "cut". As well as all of that, you need to be real by adding in some of your own character. I am quitea lively character in real life, so I do take that on to the set and they have got used to me and like me turning it into my Tiffany character. [...] "Perhaps my most useful lesson has been that while this is an amazing experience, whether you are famous or not, directors can be quite strict, so you must listen all the time and be punctual. Working to such a tight schedule can also mean very long days and I do get tired - but I still can’t wait to go back in the next time."
