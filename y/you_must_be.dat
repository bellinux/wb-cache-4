25|$|Pains {{occupy a}} {{distinct}} and vital {{place in the}} philosophy of mind for several reasons. One is that pains seem to collapse the appearance/reality distinction. If an object appears to you to be red it might not be so in reality, but if you seem to yourself to be in pain <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> so: there can be no case here of seeming at all. At the same time, one cannot feel another person’s pain, but only infer it from their behavior and their reports of it.|$|E
25|$|Established in 1879, The Medical Society is {{the student}} society for all medical {{students}} at Newcastle.

MedSoc {{is run by a}} committee of third year medical students, and tradition dictates <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> in this year to be elected. As well as the free bar, we also organize bar crawls, and trips to other cities and countries. It {{is a great way to}} meet people from all years.|$|E
25|$|When such a {{complete}} convulsion has shaken the State, and hardly left any thing whatsoever, either in civil arrangements, {{or in the}} Characters and disposition of men's minds, exactly where it was, whatever shall be settled although in the former persons and upon old forms, will be in some measure a new thing and will labour under something of the weakness {{as well as other}} inconveniences of a Change. My poor opinion is that you mean to establish what you call 'L'ancien Régime,' If any one means that system of Court Intrigue miscalled a Government as it stood, at Versailles before the present confusions as the thing to be established, that I believe will be found absolutely impossible; and if you consider the Nature, as well of persons, as of affairs, I flatter myself <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> of my opinion. That was tho' not so violent a State of Anarchy as well as the present. If it were even possible to lay things down exactly as they stood, before the series of experimental politicks began, I am quite sure that they could not long continue in that situation. In one Sense of L'Ancien Régime I am clear that nothing else can reasonably be done.|$|E

500|$|This song, {{described}} as [...] "up-tempo blues shuffle, pure Memphis" [...] and {{an example of}} [...] "obvious pop sensibility and compulsive melody", was recorded in four takes on March 7, 1966. Gill sees the lyrics {{as a series of}} sexual metaphors, including [...] "beating on my trumpet" [...] and keys to locked gates, many deriving from traditional blues. Nonetheless, the song contains what has been termed [...] "one of the most oft-repeated of Dylan's life lessons", the thought that [...] "to live outside the law <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> honest", which was later invoked in many bohemian and counter-cultural contexts.|$|E
500|$|The play {{repeatedly}} mocks Victorian {{traditions and}} social customs, {{marriage and the}} pursuit of love in particular. In Victorian times earnestness was considered to be the over-riding societal value, originating in religious attempts to reform the lower classes, it spread to the upper ones too throughout the century. The play's very title, with its mocking paradox (serious people are so because they do not see trivial comedies), introduces the theme, it continues in the drawing room discussion, [...] "Yes, but <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> serious about it. I hate people who are not serious about meals. It is so shallow of them," [...] says Algernon in Act 1; allusions are quick and from multiple angles.|$|E
500|$|Time travel {{stories to}} which the novel has been {{compared}} include Jack Finney's Time and Again (1970) F.M. Busby's short story [...] "If This Is Winnetka, <b>You</b> <b>Must</b> <b>Be</b> Judy" [...] and the film Somewhere in Time (1980). Henry {{has been compared to}} Billy Pilgrim of Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five (1969). Science fiction writer Terence M. Green calls the novel a [...] "timeslip romance". The Time Traveler's Wife is not as concerned with the paradoxes of time travel as is traditional science fiction. Instead, as critic Marc Mohan describes, the novel [...] "uses time travel as a metaphor to explain how two people can feel as if they've known each other their entire lives".|$|E

When MacLeod {{revealed}} his immortality to Tessa in [...] "Counterfeit Part Two", she can show compassion instead of the fear or disgust he expects: [...] "I was just thinking how lonely <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>be.</b> Your parents, your friends... having them all die." [...] Tessa is a very empathic and understanding character, for example, in [...] "Saving Grace", she is jealous of MacLeod's former lover Grace; however, when MacLeod assures her {{that he no longer}} loves Grace, her response is simply that [...] "...that's all that need to be said. She's your friend and she's been hurt. You'll help her. I'd expect you to do no less." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{group had}} up to 500 members, chosen from {{young men in}} the Palestinian refugee camps and in Lebanon, who were promised good pay and help looking after their families. They {{would be sent to}} {{training}} camps in whichever country was hosting the ANO at the time (Syria, Iraq or Libya), then organized into small cells. Once in, As`ad AbuKhalil and Michael Fischbach write, they were not allowed to leave again. The group assumed complete control over the membership. One member who spoke to Patrick Seale was told before being sent overseas: [...] "If we say, 'Drink alcohol'", do so. If we say, 'Get married,' find a woman and marry her. If we say, 'Don't have children,' you must obey. If we say, 'Go and kill King Hussein,' <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> ready to sacrifice yourself!" ...|$|E
500|$|Israeli {{journalist}} Lily Galili attributed this {{to being}} {{in part due to}} an unwillingness to make land concessions for the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.

Who gives up territory in the first place! And in this small country. <b>You</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> kidding!'" [...] Russian-speaking Israeli analyst Igor Khlopitsky stated that this also resulted from the Russian-speaking Israelis generally wanting quick results during times of turmoil, saying, [...] "Those who came after Perestroika had the Soviet mentality beaten out of them by the very difficult problems of the time. And where some other Israelis see the possibilities for discussion and dialogue, they just want to solve the problems swiftly." ...|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reaction}} to the suite has always been mixed, and all band members have expressed negativity toward it in recent times. Gilmour has said the album was [...] "a load of rubbish. We were at a real down point ... I think we were scraping the barrel a bit at that period" [...] and [...] "a good idea but it was dreadful... Atom Heart Mother sounds like we didn't have any idea between us, but we became much more prolific after it." [...] Similarly, in a 1984 interview on BBC Radio 1, Waters said [...] "If somebody said to me now – right – here's a million pounds, {{go out and play}} Atom Heart Mother, I'd say <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> fucking joking." [...] Alec Dubro of Rolling Stone gave Atom Heart Mother a negative review, ultimately stating [...] "if Pink Floyd is looking for some new dimensions, they haven't found them here." ...|$|E
500|$|Eminem {{also became}} a highly {{controversial}} figure due to his lyrical content. [...] He was labeled as [...] "misogynist, a nihilist and an advocate of domestic violence", and in an editorial by Billboard editor in chief Timothy White, the writer accused Eminem of [...] "making money by exploiting the world's misery." [...] During a radio appearance in San Francisco, Eminem reportedly angered local DJ Sista Tamu due to a freestyle about [...] "slapping a pregnant bitch" [...] {{to the extent that}} she broke a copy of The Slim Shady LP on-air. The rapper defended himself by saying, [...] "My album isn't for younger kids to hear. It has an advisory sticker, and <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> eighteen to get it. That doesn't mean younger kids won't get it, but I'm not responsible for every kid out there. I'm not a role model, and I don't claim to be." ...|$|E
500|$|Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal {{called it}} [...] "A first-rate action thriller, a vivid {{evocation}} of urban warfare in Iraq, a penetrating study of heroism and {{a showcase for}} austere technique, terse writing and a trio of brilliant performances." [...] The Toronto Star critic Peter Howell said, [...] "Just when you think the battle of Iraq war dramas has been fought and lost, along comes one that demands to be seen... If you can sit through The Hurt Locker without your heart nearly pounding through your chest, <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> made of granite." [...] Entertainment Weeklys film critic Lisa Schwarzbaum gave the film the rare [...] "A" [...] rating, calling it, [...] "an intense, action-driven war pic, a muscular, efficient standout that simultaneously conveys the feeling of combat from within {{as well as what}} it looks like on the ground. This ain't no war videogame." ...|$|E
