500|$|Blackburn {{served as}} writer {{on the film}} Vinyan, {{directed}} by Fabrice Du Welz. Vinyan stars Emmanuelle Béart, Rufus Sewell, and Julie Dreyfus. Sky Movies likened Vinyan to Nicolas Roeg's two films Don't Look Now and Heart of Darkness; Blackburn interviewed Roeg in 2008 for Time Out London and noted, [...] "Nic Roeg inspires me." [...] This Is London characterised the film as, [...] "a dark and pessimistic drama which goes slap-happily mad towards the end but keeps <b>you</b> <b>watching</b> all the same." [...] Empire Magazine also compared the film to Nicolas Roeg's Don't Look Now, and concluded, [...] "Horrific and harrowing but the narrative arc could leave the audience unmoved." ...|$|E
500|$|IGN's Travis Fickett rated [...] "The Equation" [...] 7.5/10, {{and called}} it a [...] "solid episode" [...] despite a few {{perceived}} plotholes. He liked Walter and Peter's actions in the asylum, and concluded [...] "At this point, whether a solid single episode is enough to keep <b>you</b> <b>watching</b> Fringe likely {{has to do with}} your overall patience with the series and whatever its ultimate goals might be." [...] Erin Dougherty of Cinema Blend called it the best episode since [...] "The Same Old Story" [...] since it contained [...] "suspense and drama and a minimal amount of conspiracy theories", making her feel [...] "seriously giddy". While still calling it [...] "entertaining", she disliked Walter seeing himself in the asylum, believing it [...] "was really strange and didn’t go with the flow of the story".|$|E
500|$|The Boston Globe's Frederic M. Biddle {{gave the}} episode {{one and a}} half stars and commented [...] "Carey always keeps <b>you</b> <b>watching,</b> {{although}} he's always threatening to be funnier than he is. But more than any other Friends ripoff, this show's supporting actors slow down the central character – they're set decoration. Comic scenes involving the full cast build, then trip over themselves." [...] Alan Pergament, writing for The Buffalo News, included The Drew Carey Show in his Top 10 new shows, noting [...] "Carey is a lovable goof and his male buddy show has the chance of becoming the male version of Designing Women." [...] Pergament cited the lack of prominent female characters and [...] "a reliance on too many risque-language jokes" [...] as the weaknesses of the show. The Washington Post's Tom Shales found the episode funny, adding [...] "The Drew Carey Show bucks all the prevailing sitcom trends and does it endearingly." ...|$|E

2500|$|Traditionally, the Merseyside derby was {{referred}} to as the [...] "friendly derby" [...] because of the large number of families with both Liverpool and Everton supporters {{and was one of the}} few that did not enforce total fan segregation.

60|$|My friends, {{if such a}} {{question}} rises in your mind, be sure that it, too, is a hint that you think yourself a debtor to the flesh--to live according to the flesh. For tell me, tell yourselves fairly, is your flesh, your body, the part of yourself which you can see and handle, You?--You {{know that it is}} not. When a neighbour's body dies, you say, perhaps, 'He is dead,' but you say it carelessly; and when one whom you know well, and love, dies,--when a parent, a wife, a child, dies, you feel very differently about them, even if you do not speak differently. You feel and know that he, the person whom you loved and understood, and felt with, and felt for, here on earth, is not dead at all; you feel (and in proportion as the friend you have lost was loving, and good, and full of feeling for you, you feel it all the more strongly) that your friend, or your child, or the wife of your bosom, is alive still--where you know not, but you feel they are alive; that they are very near you;--that they are thinking of <b>you,</b> <b>watching</b> you, caring for you,--perhaps grieving over you when you go wrong--perhaps rejoicing over you when you go right,--perhaps helping you, though you cannot see them, in some wonderful way. You know that only their mortal flesh is dead. That their mortal flesh was all you put into the grave; but that they themselves, their souls and spirits, which were their very and real selves, are alive for evermore; and you trust and hope to meet them when you die;--ay, to meet them body and soul too, at the last day, the very same persons whom you knew here on earth, though the flesh which they wore here in this life has crumbled into dust years and ages before.|$|E
60|$|In the spring, while winning his mate, Whitooweek has one habit which, {{when seen}} {{at the edge of}} the alder patch, reminds you {{instantly}} of the grass-plovers of the open moors and uplands, and of their wilder namesakes of the Labrador barrens. Indeed, in his fondness for burned plains, where he can hide in plain sight and catch no end of grasshoppers and crickets without trouble to vary his diet, and in a swift changeableness and fearlessness of man, Whitooweek has many points in common with the almost unknown plovers. In the dusk of the evening, as you steal along the edge of the woods, you will hear a faint peenk, peenk close beside you, and as you turn to listen and locate the sound a woodcock slants swiftly up over your head and begins to whirl in a spiral towards the heavens, clucking and twittering ecstatically. It is a poor kind of song, not to be compared with that of the oven-bird or grass-plover, who do the same thing at twilight, and Whitooweek must help his voice by the clicking of his wings and by the humming of air through them, like the sharp voice of a reed in windy weather; but it sounds sweet enough, no doubt, to the little brown mate who is standing perfectly still near <b>you,</b> <b>watching</b> and listening to the performance. At an enormous height, for him, Whitooweek whirls about madly for a few moments and then retraces his spiral downwards, clucking and twittering the while, until he reaches the tree-tops, where he folds his wings directly over his mate and drops like a plummet at her head. Still she does not move, knowing well what is coming, and when within a few feet of the ground Whitooweek spreads his wings wide to break his fall and drops quietly close beside her. There he remains quite still for a moment, as if exhausted; but the next moment he is strutting about her, spreading wings and tail like a wild turkey-gobbler, showing all his good points to the best advantage, and vain of all his performances as a peacock in the spring sunshine. Again he is quiet; a faint peent, peent sounds, as if it were a mile away; and again Whitooweek slants up on swift wings to repeat his ecstatic evolutions.|$|E

6000|$|I {{am trying}} to feel {{my way through the}} most {{difficult}} problem, the most difficult situation that a responsible Government can have to face. Of course, I am dependent upon information. But as I read it, as I listen to serious Indian experts with large experience, it all sounds estrangement and alienation even though it be no worse than superficial. Now that is the problem that we have to deal with. Gentlemen, I should very badly repay your kindness in asking me to come among you to-night, if I were to attempt for a minute to analyse or to prove all the conditions that have led to this state of things. It would need hours and days. This is not, I think, the occasion, nor the moment. Our first duty--the first duty of any Government--is to keep order. But just remember this. It would be idle to deny, and I am not sure that any of you gentlemen would deny, that there is at this moment, and there has been for some little time past, and very likely there will be for some time to come, a living movement {{in the mind of the}} peoples for whom you are responsible. A living movement, and a movement for what? A movement for objects which we ourselves have all taught them to think desirable objects. And unless we somehow or other can reconcile order with satisfaction of those ideas and aspirations, gentlemen, the fault will not be theirs. It will be ours. It will mark the breakdown of what has never yet broken down in any part of the world--the breakdown of British statesmanship. That is what it will do. Now I do not believe anybody--either in this room or out of this room--believes that we can now enter upon an era of pure repression. You cannot enter at this date and with English public opinion, mind <b>you,</b> <b>watching</b> you, upon an era of pure repression, and I do not believe really that anybody desires any such thing. I do not believe so. Gentlemen, we have seen attempts, in the lifetime of some of us here to-night, attempts in Continental Europe, to govern by pure repression. Has one of them really succeeded? They have all failed. There may be now and again a spurious semblance of success, but in truth they have all failed. Whether we with our enormous power and resolution should fail, I do not know. But I do not believe anybody in this room representing so powerfully as you do dominant sentiments that are not always felt in England--that in this room there is anybody who is for an era of pure repression. Gentlemen, I would just digress for a moment if I am not tiring you. ("Go on,") About the same time as the transfer, about fifty years ago, of the Government of India from the old East India Company to the Crown, another very important step was taken, a step which I have often thought since I have been concerned with the Government of India was far more momentous, one almost deeper than the transfer to the Crown. And what do you think that was? That was the first establishment--I think I am right in my date--of Universities. We in this country are so accustomed to look upon political changes as the only important changes, that we very often forget such a change as the establishment of Universities. And if any of you are inclined to prophesy, I should like to read to you something that was written by that great and famous man, Lord Macaulay, in the year 1836, long before the Universities were thought of. What did he say? What a warning it is, gentlemen. He wrote, in the year 1836:--"At the single town of Hooghly 1,400 boys are learning English. The effect of this education on the Hindus is prodigious.... It is my firm belief that if our plans of education are followed up, there will not be a single idolater among the respectable classes in Bengal thirty years hence. And this will be effected merely by the natural operation of knowledge and reflection." [...] Ah, gentlemen, the natural operation of knowledge and reflection carries men of a different structure of mind, different beliefs, different habits and customs of life--it carries them into strange and unexpected paths. I am not going to embark you to-night upon these vast controversies, but when we talk about education, are we not getting very near the root of the case? Now to-night we are not in the humour--I am sure you are not, I certainly am not--for philosophising. Somebody is glad of it. I will tell you what I think of--as I have for a good many months past--I think first of the burden of responsibility weighing on the governing men at Calcutta and Simla and the other main centres of power and of labour. We think of the anxieties of those in India, and in England as well, who have relatives in remote places and under conditions that are very familiar to you all. I have a great admiration for the self-command, for the freedom from anything like panic, which has hitherto marked the attitude of the European population of Calcutta and some other places, and I confess I have said to myself that if they had found here, in London, bombs in the railway carriages, bombs under the Prime Minister's House, and so forth, we should have had tremendous scare headlines and all the other phenomena of excitement and panic. So far as I am informed, though very serious in Calcutta--the feeling is serious, how could it be anything else?--they have exercised the great and noble virtue, in all ranks and classes, of self-command. Now the Government--if you will allow me for a very few moments to say a word on behalf of the Government, not here alone but at Simla--we and they, for after all we are one--have been assailed for a certain want of courage and what is called, often grossly miscalled, vigour.|$|E
