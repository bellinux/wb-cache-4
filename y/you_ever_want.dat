He remembers managers Kit Lambert and Chris Stamp saying, [...] "We trust you with Keith but if <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>want</b> any time off, for a holiday {{or some sort of}} rest, let us know and we'll pay for it." [...] Butler never took them up on the offer.|$|E
500|$|... "Cherry on Top" [...] is a pop and R {{track with}} a {{duration}} of three minutes and 48 seconds. Unlike the majority of Oh Land's songs, it is not an uptempo track. Instead, it contains [...] "piano instrumentals" [...] and [...] "light background harmonies". It features lyrics with a [...] "relatable" [...] message and [...] "figurative imagery". Oh Land herself stated that the song is about [...] "always going for the win, always focusing on the result and sometimes missing the process because you're such a perfectionist". According to Paul MacInnes from The Guardian, the lyrics serve as a [...] "plea to a lover about the pitfalls of excess"; the song opens with Oh Land singing, [...] "Small boy, big dreams / Going in for a bite", which is [...] "sublimely literal". She proceeds in the chorus: [...] "You can have it all but you never stop / 'Cause all <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>want</b> is the cherry on top" [...] / [...] "And all you ever dreamed of, it ain't enough / You'll never fill that hole with the cherry on top".|$|E
500|$|Musical {{performances}} in the episode attracted praise. Aly Semigran of MTV called Riley's rendition of [...] "And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going" [...] "goose bump-inducing", while Goldman commended: [...] "Riley absolutely killed it as Mercedes belted out that song". In contrast, Poniewozik wrote {{that it was the}} one song choice he didn't like, feeling that it is overused, thus diminishing its impact. Abrams deemed Rachel's solo performance at sectionals [...] "amazing", and Flandez recommended: [...] "Watch it again if <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>want</b> to take back three minutes of your life that you’ve wasted on something else." [...] Pardue called the group performance of [...] "You Can't Always Get What You Want" [...] "energetic [...] casual [...] and very Glee", but felt it [...] "would have been nice" [...] to feature different singers. Dan Snierson for Entertainment Weekly similarly noted that he would have preferred [...] "more vocal interplay between all group members". In December 2012, TV Guide named the rendition of [...] "Don't Rain on My Parade" [...] one of Glee best performances, commenting: [...] "Glee has done Broadway many times, but rarely better than this." ...|$|E

500|$|Beginning in April 2008, {{the media}} {{reported}} growing speculation that Chris Matthews, news commentator {{and host of}} MSNBC's Hardball with Chris Matthews, might run in the 2010 Democratic primary for the United States Senate Pennsylvania seat then occupied by the Republican Arlen Specter. In an interview with The New York Times Magazine, Matthews said that he believed Specter {{had been in the}} Senate for too long, but that running for Senate would mean giving up a career he loved. Mark Leibovich, author of the article, wrote, [...] "Matthews has been particularly obsessed with Pennsylvania of late, devoting hours on and off the air to the state's upcoming Democratic primary, staying in close contact with the state's party apparatus". Speculation was further fueled by Matthews' appearance on an April 14 episode of The Colbert Report. Host Stephen Colbert asked Matthews about the rumors and prodded him to make a public announcement, to which Matthews replied, [...] "Did <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>want</b> to be something your whole life? ... When you grow up, some kids want to be a fireman. I want to be a Senator. But I have to deal with these things as they come." [...] Matthews declined to directly answer questions about his possible candidacy when pressed by the media, but did not deny the possibility.|$|E
