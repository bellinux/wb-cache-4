500|$|Flight attendants Lisa E. Wick and Lonnie Trumbull, both 20, were bludgeoned with a {{piece of}} lumber as they slept in their {{basement}} apartment in Seattle's Queen Anne Hill district on June 23, 1966 near the Safeway store where Bundy worked at the time, and where the women regularly shopped. Trumbull died. In retrospect, Keppel noted many similarities to the Chi Omega crime scene. Wick, who suffered permanent memory loss {{as a result of the}} attack, later contacted Ann Rule: [...] "I know that it was Ted Bundy who did that to us," [...] she wrote, [...] "but I can't tell <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> know." [...] In the absence of incriminating evidence, Bundy's involvement remains speculative.|$|E
500|$|Beyoncé {{begins the}} first verse {{of the song}} in a near-whisper, [...] "I thought that things like this get better with time / But I still need you / Why is that?" [...] The latter rhetorical {{question}} reappears throughout the song. In the chorus lines, she questions herself, [...] "I miss you / But if I got with you, could it feel the same?" [...] From the second verse and onwards, the song finds Beyoncé [...] "vocalizing an internal battle, alternately desperate and calm", as stated by Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle. She starts to sing in a double voice; her lower vocal notes are set as the song's base, while her voice in a heightened key is played over it. In the second verse, she sings, [...] "The words don’t ever seem to come out right / But I still mean em", pining for her ex-love interest and feeling self-conscious for doing so, [...] "It hurts my pride to tell <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> feel, but I still need to" [...] before asking again, [...] "Why is that?". The bridge features Beyoncé chanting, [...] "No matter who you are / It is so simple / A feeling / But it’s everything." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reviewers have {{commented on}} how the book begins on a simple note (girl {{unexpectedly}} wins a school contest), and later moves into dark territory (family falls apart). In a 2005 interview at her college alma mater, Goldberg explained her motivation: [...] "I'll tell <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> wrote the book. I did write it very consciously to get darker and stronger as it continues. I wanted it at first {{to be like this}} sunny, happy, Reader's Digest kind of read, and to lull people into this sense of complacency and then hit them over the head." ...|$|E

The Weeknd previewed the album at a listening party in New York City on 24 October. It was his first major media event. According to music magazine NMEs website, in {{an open letter to}} his fans The Weeknd posted on his website in regards to the [...] "Rolling Stone" [...] video, [...] "Because I am a man of few words, I chose to make a viral video to show <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> felt and where I stand. I usually don't like to 'spoon feed' my audience because I grew up idolising story tellers who tell stories using symbolism, so it was in my nature to do the same. The [...] "Rolling Stone" [...] video takes place in a dimly lit studio which represents the two worlds I have been stuck in. The gloomy side represents the mainstream world while the other side represents the underground. The girl holding on represents you." ...|$|E
2500|$|In his 2009 book [...] "Parkour", David Belle {{stressed}} {{that the most important}} aspect of parkour is not the physical movements, but rather the practitioner's mentality and understanding of its principles. [...] "When young trainees come to see me and give me videos telling me to check out what they are doing, I just take the tape and throw it away. What I'm interested in is what the guy's got in his head, if he has self-confidence, if he masters the technique, if he has understood the principles of parkour. I just can't deal with guys who do Parkour because they saw videos on the Internet and thought it was kinda cool and want to do even better." [...] Further, he states the importance of traceurs being aware of their abilities and limitations, and developing in their own way. [...] "When a young person asks me: 'Can you show me how to do this?' I simply answer: [...] "No, I am going to show <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> do it. Then, you'll have to learn with your own technique, your own way of moving, your style, your abilities and your limitations. You are going to learn to be yourself, not someone else." ...|$|E
2500|$|Under {{pressure}} by Austria, Charles Louis agreed on some territorial adjustments that were detrimental to his future inheritance in Parma. By {{the treaty of}} Florence, on 28 Nov 1844, between Charles Louis and the dukes of Tuscany and Modena, {{he had to give}} up his claim to the Duchy of Guastalla and the lands east of the Enza. These territories would be given to Modena receiving in compensation only Lunigiana. The treaty of Florence remained a secret for nearly three years, but once it became known it contributed to Charles Louis growing unpopularity both in Lucca and in Parma. Need for money led the Duke, on the advice of Ward, who became Minister of Finance, to claim tax credits for titles dating back thirty years. All these resulted in general [...] dissatisfaction. A liberal movement began to grow in Lucca where in 1847 there was a series of demonstrations, culminating in July in a full-scale riot. At first Charles Louis tried to assert his authority, but the continuous unrest forced him to take refuge in the Villa of San Martino in Vignale. On 1 September 1847, alarmed {{at the sight of a}} crowd that wanted to submit some reforms, he signed a series of concessions. Three days later, under pressure from many citizens, he returned to Lucca, where he was welcomed triumphantly. However he was unable to cope with the pressure and on 9 September he left for Modena. From there, he issued a decree that converted the Council of State in a Council of Regency. On 4 October he abdicated in favor of the Grand Duke of Tuscany, who would in any case have taken the duchy when Charles Louis became Duke of Parma, meanwhile he was to receive a monthly economical compensation. Thomas Ward arranged the premature handover; in a letter Charles told him [...] " [...] I can't describe to <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> feel and what a sacrifice I have made". [...] He left for Saxony while his family went to live in Turin under the protection of King Charles Albert of Sardinia.|$|E
