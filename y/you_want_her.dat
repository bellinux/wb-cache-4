500|$|By 09:00, {{hundreds}} of people had arrived to observe the tree's toppling. At 10:00, the final cutting commenced. Criss decided to topple the tree downhill onto a ledge, which narrowed between the two ravines that emptied into Trace Fork. While it was assessed that the shelf was not {{long enough for the}} tree to land on, it was agreed upon by all the participants that given the rotten nature of the tree's top section, it would fracture notwithstanding the orientation of its fall. Prior to Criss cutting further into the tree, he assured the crews: [...] "I can put her anywhere <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> gentlemen. Lay a $10 bill anywhere you like and I'll guarantee the trunk will cover it." ...|$|E
2500|$|On boxing: [...] "It's {{like being}} {{in love with a}} woman. She can be unfaithful, she can be mean, she can be cruel, but it doesn't matter. If you love her, <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>her,</b> even though she can do you all kinds of harm. It's the same with me and boxing. It can do me all kinds of harm but I love it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In June, Raisman competed at the National Championships in St. Louis. She placed {{third in}} the {{all-around}} with a two-day combined score of 120.950, and finished first on beam (30.650) and floor (31.250). Károlyi said: [...] "She is just so solid. She goes out there and doesn't act like she's bothered by anything. She knows she's trained, she knows she's ready, and she doesn't put any extra pressure on herself. I really love {{to have this kind}} of gymnast. She gives her heart." [...] Sacramone added: [...] "I don't think she necessarily gets enough credit for how well she competes. At the last two world championships, I don't think she's made any mistakes. She's the backbone. If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> to go and do something, do a solid routine, she's going to do it." ...|$|E
6000|$|A moment since, and I {{thought her}} alluring; this speech concluded, I looked on her with distaste. [...] "Just like you," [...] was my cold answer. [...] "And {{in this way}} you have ousted Mdlle. Henri? <b>You</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> office, {{therefore}} <b>you</b> rendered it intolerable to her?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suppose it}} would depend on what <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> to do," [...] he said at last. [...] "The Hall is a good service, though they don't like the mistresses, and of course {{none of them would}} like to do {{anything}} that might risk their place." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well?' echoed {{her mother}} in a {{different}} tone. 'I don't {{know what you were}} all saying, but I'm sure of this, that that woman was only looking to see what <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> to say. I watched the cunning look of her eyes, and I would not give that for her word,' with a gesture of her fingers.|$|R
2500|$|At first, {{it might}} {{appear that the}} boyfriend is {{straight}} up busted. But it's more complicated than that, especially as you see Mýa and her girls engaged in their own energetic calisthenics, then (apparently) commanding their male admirers to hit the ground and perform push-ups, constructing a kind of reciprocal relationship that, for instance, Christina Aguilera's video for [...] "What a Girl Wants" [...] cannot do, in its celebration of the most excellent boyfriend {{whose job is to}} be endlessly appreciative of his girlfriend's super-gloriousness (see also, Christina's video for Genie in a Bottle," [...] in which she also dances seductively with a group of girls for a group of boys). Director Diane Martel has done her share of conventionally alluring Mariah Carey and Christina Aguilera videos, but here the terms have shifted. Mýa and her girls—in moves recalling Janet's—don't pretend to be charming or enticing. Instead, they present themselves as young women with demands and desires, proudly hard-bodied and self-possessed.Mýa can rock the midriff tops like any other pop star, but as always, she remains slightly offbeat, neither apologetic nor solicitous. Sexy and self-assured without being coy, she knows who she is and what she wants, and says it outright: [...] "What'cha gonna do / When you can't say no / And your feelings start to show? / Boy I really need to know / And how you gonna act?" [...] In Mýa's world, it's not the girl who turns emotional and unsure of herself when a question of integrity arises, but the more fragile, less stable boy. She warns,"There's no need to / Reminisce about the past, / Obviously, 'cause that shit did not last." [...] The video's imagery underlines her admonition, as the camera shoots up at her looking unafraid and austere, backed by her crew as the dust flies from their work-out: [...] "She don't know me / She's about to know me / I'm in your life / That's how it's gon' be." [...] And if you want to mess around, you're free to choose, but it will cost: [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> back / You can take her back. / Cause game recognize game. / I could do the same thing." [...] And she does. At the end of the [...] video, Mýa and her dancers exit, leaving their audience dusty and on their own.|$|E
6000|$|Nothing of {{the kind}} had been settled, but Olive helped Mrs. Burrage (this time) more than she knew by saying, [...] "Why do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> to visit you, Mrs. Burrage? why do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> socially? Are you not aware that your son, a year ago, desired to marry her?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wal, you hoss-stealin' son-of-a-gun!" [...] ejaculated Blinky with pleasure. [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>her,</b> we shore {{will run}} her legs off." ...|$|E
6000|$|MRS. PEARCE. Well, sir, {{she says}} you'll {{be glad to}} see her when you know what she's come about. She's quite a common girl, sir. Very common indeed. I should have sent her away, only I thought perhaps <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> to talk into your machines. I hope I've not done wrong; but really you see such queer people sometimes--you'll excuse me, I'm sure, sir-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is sorcery for you, and a doll worth having; {{being one}} of the sort that can shut its eyes; it was going to bed, but its mamma relented and lends it to us for the night. I told Mrs. Dodd <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>her,</b> and couldn't wait, so she sent her clothes; but the room is so warm let the dear play in her pretty bed-gown." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{why should}} <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to spite <b>her?</b> If she is Mary's child, she is your brother's child also. If {{she is my}} niece, she must be your niece too. Why should <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to spite <b>her?</b> Why {{should you try to}} do her such a terrible injury?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why,--just this, ma'am. May I tell Miss Dolly {{straight}} out that <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> to come back, and that I've {{been sent to}} say so?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't leave me! There, I {{knew it was}} that. Why don't {{you want}} Nurse to leave you? Do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> {{to be with you}} every minute?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You monster!" [...] {{retorted}} Hans, [...] "do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> to wear weeds {{for you all}} her life--burn {{herself in}} perpetual suttee while you are alive and merry?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{you don't}} care for Kitty's {{pleasure}} at all, and <b>you</b> don't <b>want</b> <b>her</b> to enjoy herself. Why don't you take {{some interest in}} the matter?" ...|$|R
60|$|CUTHBERTSON (indignantly). She has {{mentioned}} that <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to marry <b>her.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{is in my}} room," [...] Arnold replied. [...] "She was too terrified {{to remain}} alone over there. <b>You</b> don't <b>want</b> <b>her,</b> do you?" [...] he asked, anxiously.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Not at all. She's of age. If {{she chooses}} to marry you she can marry you. If that's all <b>you</b> <b>want,</b> <b>her</b> consent is enough. You're a baronet, I believe?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{talk to me}} of English society! Thank goodness, in {{the first}} place, I don't live in it. Do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> {{to give up her}} genius?" [...] he demanded.|$|E
6000|$|... "She's youahs, suh," [...] he said. [...] "These {{here are}} panic times. I've struck my limit. I can do bettah in Louisville fo' less. Congratulate you, suh--reckon <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> wuss'n I do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{not at all}} so sure of it. She {{has been}} made to believe that <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> to stay, and {{therefore}} she has stayed. She is quite master enough of herself to ride out hunting with him again and then to refuse him." [...] And so Lady Albury doubted up to the Sunday, and all through the Sunday,--up to the very moment when the last preparations were to be made for the man's arrival.|$|R
6000|$|... "Justine Marie!" [...] What was this? Justine Marie--the dead nun--where was she? Why, in her grave, Madame Walravens--what can <b>you</b> <b>want</b> with <b>her?</b> <b>You</b> shall go to her, but she {{shall not}} come to you.|$|R
6000|$|... "And what do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> with <b>her,</b> pretty one?" [...] {{said the}} little monster, [...] "for I am {{a friend of}} hers, and, for the matter of that, I am quite as clever as she is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "See here," [...] said Kenneth, sternly, [...] "you {{are getting}} morbid, young man, {{and pretty soon}} you'll be mad yourself. If Lucy is found do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> {{to see you in}} this condition?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'She {{will not}} feel that,' said Ethel; 'but indeed, Tom, I {{see what you}} mean, and like it. It is yourself, and not the conferrer of the benefit, that <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> to care for.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, it {{is a risky}} complaint; and the attacks, {{when they}} come, are so agonizing that to endure them I ought {{to get rid of}} all outside anxieties, folk say. Now--do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>her,</b> sir?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's right," [...] she said. [...] "Now we {{know where}} we are. <b>You</b> <b>want</b> to marry the Duchess, and {{therefore}} <b>you</b> don't <b>want</b> <b>her</b> to have Lawrence. You think that I can stop it, and as I don't want him married, either, you come to me. That is reasonable. Now how can I prevent it?" ...|$|R
60|$|JACKSON. Excuse me, my lady. There's a {{young woman}} from the village, says <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> to see <b>her.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "She is asleep. I {{hope she}} may never waken. What do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> with <b>her?</b> Why are you keeping {{her in this}} house? What devil's brew have you been making that smells of gas and sherry and sealing-wax?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We've played pretty {{square in}} this matter, Wemple," [...] Davies said. [...] "And {{we might as}} well speak up and {{acknowledge}} what each of us knows the other knows. <b>You</b> <b>want</b> <b>her.</b> I want her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What! Did <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> yourself? On {{my honor}} I knew not of it. But have patience. You shall have her yet, {{and all her}} lands, if you will hear my counsel, and keep it." ...|$|E
6000|$|Adelaide kept repeating, with coy slyness: [...] "Isn't it {{too bad you}} {{two have}} me in the way!" [...] and: [...] "Don't mind poor me. Auntie will turn her back any time <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> to." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{never mind}} about me," [...] {{the old woman}} broke in cheerfully. [...] "I'll be no drag on <b>you.</b> If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> granny, granny's not too old to travel; and if <b>you</b> don't <b>want</b> <b>her,</b> why she can look after the cottage, and have an English home ready for you {{whenever}} you {{turn back to the}} old country." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hate you! no;--she {{does not}} hate you. But {{there are so}} many degrees between hating and that kind of love which <b>you</b> <b>want</b> from <b>her!</b> <b>You</b> may be sure of this, that she so esteems you that your {{persistence}} cannot lessen you in her regard." ...|$|R
6000|$|Viola {{put on a}} comically wise look, {{and shook}} her head, as she said, [...] "You didn't go {{the right way to}} work. If you had come back in the carriage, and {{consulted}} her, and said it was a mission--yes, a mission--for you to stand, with a lily in your hand, and reform your two bush-ranger nephews, and that <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> consent and advice, then she would have let you go back and be good aunt, and what-not. Oh, I wish you had, Lucy! That was the way Dermot managed about getting the lodge at Biston. He says he could consult her into going out hunting." ...|$|R
