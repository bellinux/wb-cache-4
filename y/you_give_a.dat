500|$|In February 1870, Wills captained Victoria to a 265-run {{win over}} New South Wales at the MCG. The match {{featured}} Twopenny (Jarrawuk), an Aboriginal paceman who {{was said to}} have been recruited by Lawrence as a foil to Wills' [...] "chucks". Comparing the two, the Melbourne press surmised: [...] "Undoubtedly Wills throws sometimes, but there is some decency about it, some disguise." [...] In March, Victoria trounced a Tasmanian XVI in Launceston under Wills' leadership, though not without criticism of his bowling action. The accusations of throwing were growing louder, and one-time ally Hammersley, now Melbourne's foremost sportswriter, emerged as Wills' most vocal critic. He accused Wills of resorting to throwing to maintain pace as he aged, and criticised him for introducing a type of bouncer designed to injure and intimidate batsmen. The Australasian, Hammersley's newspaper, described Wills' modus operandi: [...] "If I cannot hit your wicket or make <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>a</b> chance soon, I'll hit you and hurt you if I can. I'll frighten you out." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} written by Lifehouse lead singer Jason Wade. [...] It was {{produced}} by American record producer Ron Aniello and was mixed by Brendan O'Brien. When asked about the song {{in an interview with}} Billboard, Wade said, [...] "It was the most uptempo, radio-friendly song. We all decided it was the right choice to release it as the first single." [...] He went on to describe his expectations when writing songs, saying, [...] "My ultimate goal in writing songs is to connect with people. In the lyrics, you don't tell the whole picture: <b>You</b> <b>give</b> <b>a</b> road to start on that people can relate to. We're honest, nice guys and I hope that comes across in everything we do." [...] After being asked how he wrote the song in an interview with Launch, Wade explained, [...] "I wrote that song without thinking about what was gonna happen to it and then it just kinda took over from there." [...] He also said in the interview that he wrote [...] "Hanging by a Moment" [...] in about five minutes.|$|E

2500|$|PC Zone hailed it as [...] "one {{of the few}} {{games that}} {{has the power to}} engage your {{imagination}} with pretty pictures, then actually live up to your imaginings when you get your hands on it". and GameZone gave it [...] "Editor's Choice", calling it [...] "a bona fide winner". However, GameSpy asked [...] "How much slack can <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>a</b> game that in many ways manages to achieve [...] lofty goal, but buries it under a painfully incomplete implementation?". Reviewers complained of low frame rates, frequent crashes, and bugs that made it impossible to complete the game; [...] "the game was simply unplayable out of the box". [...] "t's not that X3 is a bad game, or that it isn't fun - it just isn't done." [...] Complaints were also made about its complicated interface, exacerbated by an unhelpful manual which references [...] "features and options that aren't even in the final version".|$|E
2500|$|Critical {{response}} to Bayonetta's character has been mainly positive. Computer and Video Games praised her as {{more interesting than}} the game's storyline, describing her as the [...] "sexiest collection of pixels [...] ever seen", though not a character they considered a sex object. They further compared her to [...] "Lara Croft without the prudishness, Rubi from Wet played with honest sexuality", {{and one of the most}} memorable characters they'd seen. GamesRadar stated the character deserved plenty of respect, describing her as [...] "sexy, witty and can certainly handle herself in a fight" [...] and further named her one of the game's most positive points as she [...] "kicks all sorts of ass and is funny too." [...] GamePro felt that the character's [...] "overt sexuality and frantic anime-inspired shenanigans" [...] hampered the game's presentation, adding they would have enjoyed the character more if less focus had been put on her sexuality. [...] IGN's Ryan Clements described the character as a [...] "hardcore badass" [...] that was also [...] "brimming with sexual energy", further describing her as an [...] "immensely powerful protagonist". However, associate editor Nicole Tanner disagreed, noting she did not find the character's sexuality at all empowering as [...] "just because <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>a</b> girl an attitude and guns isn't enough to offset what she looks like". Other members of IGN's staff named her their favorite video game character, describing her as [...] "the playfulness and versatility of Dante" [...] combined with [...] "visually inventive combat". They cited her constant nudity as a point of appeal, calling the mechanic of her hair serving as her clothing both one of the stupidest and one of the coolest elements of a character.|$|E

That was what all the boys said, and my boy {{believed}} it, though {{he had never heard}} of anybody that it happened to. He believed that if <b>you</b> <b>gave</b> <b>a</b> chicken-cock burnt brandy it could lay eggs, and that if <b>you</b> <b>gave</b> <b>a</b> boy burnt brandy it would stop his growing. That was the way the circus-men got their dwarfs, and the India-rubber man kept himself limber by rubbing his joints with rattlesnake oil.|$|R
