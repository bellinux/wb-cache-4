2500|$|Stephen Dorff portrays Hal Hartman, an unhinged Texas Ranger that pursues Leatherface and {{his family}} for revenge {{for the murder of}} his daughter. Dorff {{described}} Leatherface as a [...] "survival film for my character and a retribution film for Hartman, who I play. But it definitely has the moments of some sick stuff going on, and I think you realize that this family's not to be messed with. <b>You</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> clear away from the Sawyers and not confront them." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, you do. Take it from me. This {{is about}} the punkest joint I ever was in. <b>You</b> don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> in a dairy-kitchen like this." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{waste time}} hyer!" [...] cried Barringford almost roughly. It made him angry {{to think that}} his first shot had not laid the elk low. [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> behind, why--" ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Wrenn felt a good {{wholesome}} {{desire to}} spank her, but he said, most politely: [...] "You're awful tired. Don't <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> here tonight? Or maybe some other hotel; and I'll stay here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> in Europe or not? that's what I want to know," [...] Delia pursued to her sister. [...] "If {{you want}} to go bang home you're taking the right way to do it." ...|$|E

6000|$|James Forsyte replied, {{tumbling}} {{over his}} own words: [...] "Why! what do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> here for? There's nothing {{for you to do}} here--there's nothing to see here, unless you go up the Citadel, an' you won't do that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I forgot," [...] she murmured. [...] "You {{looked as}} though you were posing for a statue of some one in exile," [...] she observed. [...] "Come, let us go a little lower down--unless <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> here and be blown to pieces." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Caleb, I {{have a great}} mind to go {{and feed}} your {{squirrel}} for you, if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> here and help the boys to make the mole. In fact, I should like to buy him of you, {{if you would like}} to sell him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You <b>want</b> <b>to</b> go home?" [...] I began slowly. [...] "Why, Whit, I can't keep you. I wouldn't try if <b>you</b> didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay.</b> But I'll {{tell you}} confidentially, {{if you leave}} me at this stage I'm ruined." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Exactly. What <b>you</b> <b>want</b> is, <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> here quite quietly, just as {{if nothing}} had happened, whilst the friend of whom I spoke just now went and got back that key which is causing so much trouble." ...|$|R
60|$|FRANK. No: I always <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay.</b> But I {{advise you}} to go away.|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{good many}} people know of it; and such things are hard to keep. It may come out--some rumor of it--in the morning papers. The {{question}} is whether <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> till they know it here; {{whether it would be}} wise, or useful." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, let us convert you instead," [...] Sybil declared. [...] "We {{want to look}} at the sun, and we want to {{take you}} with us. You are really a very stupid person, you know. Why do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> all alone amongst the shadows?" [...] Arranmore smiled faintly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Our good friend's {{diagnosis}} was correct. I'd give a leg {{to say it}} wasn't, but it was. It is this here new Spanish influenza. Not a bad attack. <b>You</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> in bed and keep warm, and I'll write you out a prescription. You ought to be nursed. Is this young lady a nurse?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Cap'n Bill, [...] "you've {{got to go}} home, anyhow, 'cause <b>you</b> don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> here, I take it. And, {{when you}} get home, it wouldn't worry you much to tell the Wizard what's {{happened}} to us." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Billy," [...] {{he began}} at last, and stopped again. [...] "Billy, {{in this country}} somehow one wants to talk like a Russian. Billy, my dear--I'm not your father, I'm not your judge. I'm--unreasonably fond of you. It's not my {{business}} to settle what is right or wrong for you. If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> in Moscow, stay in Moscow. Stay here, and stay as my guest...." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have never}} seen two men fight," [...] said she, [...] "and I don't say I wouldn't like it, just once; but {{you would have to}} have on boxing-gloves; I couldn't stand a fight with plain hands, so you needn't think of it. Martin, take down the hammock just as quickly as you can. And if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> here, Mr. Raybold, you can stay, {{but if you want to}} talk, you can talk to the trees." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I see {{him more}} from the family point of view, I suppose," [...] Letitia observed, [...] "and yet, in a way, he is rather a {{wonderful}} person. For instance, I have never seen him hurry, I have never seen him angry, in the ordinary sense of the word; in fact he has the most amazing complacency I ever knew. Of course, Aunt Caroline," [...] she went on, turning to the Duchess a few moments later, [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> with the men, pray do so. If not, you might {{take into account the}} fact that I have been trying to catch your eye for the last three minutes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "O' course, {{everything}} may {{be perfectly}} reg'lar here," [...] continued Jed Wallop. [...] "Although, like you, I have my doubts. But unless <b>you</b> <b>want</b> me <b>to</b> <b>stay,</b> I'll git home." [...] And {{a little later}} he took his departure.|$|R
5000|$|I don't know... It {{will all}} be clear in the {{negotiations}} following me turning this actual album in. And, of course, the performance and how they actually treat the work will determine whether <b>you</b> still <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> in that position or not.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{said her}} mother, {{after she had}} given her a little time, [...] "you needn't be troubled. Your father can easily get the ticket again; he can {{telephone}} down for it. Nothing has been done yet. But didn't <b>you</b> really <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay,</b> then?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Without {{looking at}} him the Right Bower rose, leaned against the open door with his hands behind him and his face towards the landscape, and said, {{apparently}} to the distant prospect: [...] "The claim's played out, the partnership's played out, and the sooner we skedaddle out of this the better. If," [...] he added, turning to the Old Man, [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay,</b> {{if you want to}} do Chinaman's work at Chinaman's wages, if you want to hang on to the charity of the traders at the Crossing, you can do it, and enjoy the prospects and the Noah's doves alone. But we're calculatin' to step out of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{laughed at}} his changed expression, and then swung herself easily to a sitting posture {{on the low}} {{projecting}} branch of a hemlock. The act was still girlish, but, nevertheless, she looked down upon him in a superior, patronizing way. [...] "Now, Clarence," [...] she said, with a half-abstracted manner, [...] "don't you be a big fool! If you talk that way to mother, she'll only tell you to wait {{two or three years}} until you know your own mind, and she'll pack me off to that horrid school again, besides watching me like a cat every moment you are here. If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> here, and see me sometimes like this, you'll just behave as you have done, and say nothing. Do you see? Perhaps you don't care to come, or are satisfied with Mary and mother. Say so, then. Goodness knows, I don't want to force you to come here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Thomas, you cannot go back; the {{distance}} is too great, {{the tide is}} against us, {{and it is time}} that you and I were both in our beds. Nothing may happen to that baby; but, attend to my words now, if any harm should come to that child it will go hard with you. If it should die it would be of no use for you to talk about practical jokes. You would be held responsible for its death. I was going to say to you that it might be as well for you not to say anything about this little venture until I had seen how Williamson Green took the joke. Some people get angry with very little reason, although I hardly believe he's that sort of a man; but now things are different. He thinks all the world of that child, which is the only one they've got; and if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> outside of jail or the house of refuge I warn you never to say a word of where you have been this night.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't like you, Pritchard," [...] he shrieked. [...] "I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> go with <b>you.</b> I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> with Elizabeth. I am {{not really}} afraid of her. She'd like to kill me, I know, but she's too clever--oh, she's too clever! I'd like <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> with her." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "So they did. But {{as soon as}} Gilbert {{heard that}} you had applied for it he went to them--they had a {{business}} meeting at the school last night, you know--and told them that he withdrew his application, and suggested that they accept yours. He {{said he was going}} to teach at White Sands. Of course he knew how much <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> with Marilla, and I must say I think it was real kind and thoughtful in him, that's what. Real self-sacrificing, too, for he'll have his board to pay at White Sands, and everybody knows he's got to earn his own way through college. So the trustees decided to take you. I was tickled to death when Thomas came home and told me." ...|$|R
