500|$|The lyrics {{start off}} with Martin recalling: [...] "Was a long and dark December/From the rooftops I remember/There was snow". Martin {{emphasizes}} towards the thoughts of a soldier going into battle. The line [...] "If you love me, why'd <b>you</b> <b>let</b> me go?", talks about a man's love of a woman, who does not reciprocate his love. The song ends with Martin playing the piano and singing, and pleading in nearly spoken-words: [...] "If you love me, won't <b>you</b> <b>let</b> me know?" [...] In live performances of the song, he plays the piano part on his acoustic guitar.|$|E

500|$|According to Neil McCormick of The Sydney Morning Herald, {{he writes}} that the lyrics [...] "I don't {{want to be a}} soldier", is a way that Martin can conjure John Lennon into the song's melody.

500|$|Musically, {{it is one}} of Coldplay's {{more diverse}} pieces, {{featuring}} many different time signatures. While the majority of the song is in common time, or 4/4, the interlude of [...] "if you love me, won't <b>you</b> <b>let</b> me know?" [...] is in 6/4, preceding two bars of 4/4 before going back into the verses. The outro, consisting of Chris Martin's vocal accompanied by a piano switches from 4/4, 3/4, 5/4 and 6/4.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Thunder" [...] is a ballad {{about finding}} the [...] "strength of rising after the fall" [...] and follows the self-empowerment {{theme of the}} album. The song begins with the lyrics [...] "First it was heaven, ev'rything roses and fire," [...] and she later proclaims [...] "I’m coming back with the thunder." [...] Lewis {{projects}} a stance of empowerment as she performs the line [...] "With an empty heart, I am free again" [...] over a [...] "striding" [...] beat accompanied by a piano. Angela Wilson of Vibe described the track as [...] "a celebratory salute to self love" [...] and highlighted the lines [...] "And I won’t wait any longer / When <b>you</b> <b>let</b> me down, I got stronger," [...] as empowering. Will Hodgkinson of The Times thought that [...] "Thunder" [...] was about her former record label boss and friend Simon Cowell, writing that the lyrics [...] "I won’t wait any longer, when <b>you</b> <b>let</b> me down I got stronger," [...] was Lewis' way of saying [...] "Check me out now, you high-waisted berk." [...] The song, in the key of B major, has a tempo of 92beats per minute. Lewis' voice spans more than two octaves, from F3 to G5.|$|E
500|$|It {{was during}} the {{negotiations}} to purchase the truce necessary to secure the Roman retreat to the wall that the first recorded utterance, attributable with any reasonable degree of confidence, to a native of Scotland was made. When Julia Domna, wife of Septimius Severus, criticised the sexual morals of the Caledonian women, the wife (whose name is unknown) of the Caledonian chief Argentocoxos allegedly replied: [...] "We fulfill the demands of nature {{in a much better}} way than do you Roman women; for we consort openly with the best men, whereas <b>you</b> <b>let</b> yourselves be debauched in secret by the vilest." ...|$|E

500|$|Reimer {{plays in}} the {{butterfly}} style of goaltending. Observers have attributed Reimer's success during the 2010–11 season to his ability to maintain his focus and confidence. [...] Reimer tries {{to focus on the}} basics of playing goal, feeling that the fundamentals of goaltending are the key to success, saying [...] "It’s not about making the great save, or making a diving save or playing outside yourself. It’s all about pushing, stopping, and being square and just relying on that. Most of the time if <b>you</b> <b>let</b> out a rebound the defenceman is there so it’s more about being solid fundamentally." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Dream a Little Dream of Me" [...] delves {{into the}} backstory of hunter Bobby Singer. The writers always knew his history would be [...] "grounded in family". Reflecting this, the {{original}} teaser depicted the supernatural deaths of Bobby's children; while eating dinner with his family, his children's throats are supernaturally slit, {{and they would}} ask him, [...] "Why, daddy, why did <b>you</b> <b>let</b> this happen?" [...] However, the writers could not determine where to go from there. Following Humphris' earlier pitch of Bobby being an expert exorcist because of a previous failed exorcism, the focus changed to Bobby's torment about killing his demonically possessed wife.|$|E
500|$|R. Kelly, portraying [...] "The Remix Killer", {{released}} an unofficial remix {{of the song}} in April 2008. During most of his section of the song, Kelly sings of shining, drinking and two-stepping in a club, and he promises to kiss any place on Mariah's body she wants: [...] "Girl, if <b>you</b> <b>let</b> me, I'm gonna touch it / But if I touch it, I'm gonna wanna hit it." [...] Later, he mimics Carey's bridge: [...] "If some honies up in here that want me to touch her body / Touch it / Let me hear you say, 'I-i-i-i do.'" [...] According to Kelly, the remix is unofficial, and his lyrics are freestyle rap.|$|E

500|$|... "Mother's Day" [...] {{has been}} the subject of several {{retrospective}} reviews of the series. Philip Lewis of Arts.Mic praised the episode as an example of Nickelodeon's potential to cover a serious subject, noting its treatment of [...] "the loss of a parent" [...] as one of the series' most memorable moments. Moviepilot's Kristy Anderson wrote that the development of Chuckie's backstory was a surprise as [...] "ew would have expected to be confronted by the topic of death while watching a cartoon about babies". In their book Flickipedia: Perfect Films for Every Occasion, Holiday, Mood, Ordeal, and Whim, authors Michael Atkinson and Laurel Shifrin echoed Anderson's sentiment, commenting that the episode could [...] "hit you like a truck if <b>you</b> <b>let</b> it".|$|E
500|$|Homeless, Apu {{moves into}} the {{apartment}} complex where Kirk Van Houten lives. The octuplets then speak their first words, which put together, say [...] "Mommy, will <b>you</b> <b>let</b> daddy come back...cookie!" [...] Marge and Manjula go to Apu's and arrive in time {{to prevent him from}} committing suicide by hanging. Apu is then subjected to several tasks to redeem himself (such as eating a light bulb), though Manjula says it will take time for everything to get back to normal. In bed, Manjula, finally satisfied with what he has done, kisses Apu while Homer watches from the window, on a ladder. The couple continues and Homer, traumatized, hops backwards on the ladder all the way home, without falling, mimicking what he did earlier.|$|E
500|$|In 2006, Frank was one {{of three}} Representatives to oppose the Respect for America's Fallen Heroes Act, which {{restricted}} protests (notably those of Fred Phelps' Westboro Baptist Church) at soldiers' funerals. He opposed the bill, which passed unanimously in the Senate, on civil liberties and constitutional grounds. Frank said of the vote, [...] "I think it's very likely to be found unconstitutional. [...] It's true that when you defend civil liberties you are typically defending people who do obnoxious things... You play into their hand when <b>you</b> <b>let</b> them provoke you into overdoing it. I don't want these thugs to [...] claim [...] America is hypocritical." [...] The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People scored him at 100% in 2006 indicating a pro-affirmative-action stance.|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, it is [...] "an {{inspirational}} {{song about}} finding one’s destiny, and becoming numb to the negativity and just following your dreams". [...] "Numb"'s lyrical message {{was described by}} Erika Ramirez of Billboard to simply be [...] "Forget your troubles and fist-pump!". The single opens with the lines, [...] "They say life is a battlefield / I say bring it on" [...] and its chorus consists of [...] "Just go numb / You never know until <b>you</b> <b>let</b> go". Ryan Hadfield of Consequence of Sound explained that Usher inadvertently describes the logic behind the musical ambition of Looking 4 Myself in [...] "Numb", when he sings [...] "Keep on doing the same old thing/Are you expecting change/Is that really insanity/Or just a loser’s game".|$|E
500|$|The Independents Andy Gill {{awarded a}} four-out-of-five star rating to Syro {{and called it}} [...] "a {{collection}} primarily concerned with the somatic rather than cerebral sides of Richard James' music, overdosing somewhat on staccato, bouncing synth twangs and jittery drum'n'bass beats." [...] "aisatsana [...] ", Syros closing track, drew comparisons to the works of French composer Erik Satie from both The Independent and Drowned in Sound, whose reviewer Tom Fenwick awarded the album a full 10-out-of-10 rating. Summarising the album, Fenwick said that [...] "Syro sees a master craftsman return with renewed inspiration. And while it might not technically be James' most innovative album, it way [...] well be his best … and once <b>you</b> <b>let</b> the hype drain away—what's revealed is pretty much flawless." ...|$|E

In July 2005, it was announced by the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) that Will & Graces season premiere for season eight would be performed live. It was also confirmed that actor Alec Baldwin would appear in the episode. This was Baldwin's third appearance, as he guest starred in two episodes from season seven, playing Will's boss. His initial decision to do the show was to work with Megan Mullally, who plays Karen; [...] "I just love Megan. And so I said, 'Well, if <b>you</b> <b>let</b> me do it with Megan.' And they said 'You got it.' So I went and did that with them for four [...] It was fun. For me now, it's about who I work with." ...|$|E
