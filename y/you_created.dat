2500|$|The {{direction}} of strategic research also paralleled a major paradigm shift in how companies competed, specifically {{a shift from}} the production focus to market focus. [...] The prevailing concept in strategy up to the 1950s {{was to create a}} product of high technical quality. If <b>you</b> <b>created</b> a product that worked well and was durable, it was assumed you would have no difficulty profiting. This was called the production orientation. Henry Ford famously said of the Model T car: [...] "Any customer can have a car painted any color that he wants, so long as it is black." ...|$|E
2500|$|The band also {{revealed}} that within their concept album trilogy, Holy Wood serves as prequel to Mechanical Animals and Antichrist Superstar despite the latter two preceding Holy Wood in release date. Each album contains its own distinct storyline, which can be linked {{together to create a}} larger overarching storyline encompassing all three. Manson has offered this {{much in the way of}} an interpretation: [...] " [...] wanting to fit into a world that didn't want me, and fighting really hard to get there. [...] are idealism and the desire to start a revolution. If you begin with Holy Wood, then Mechanical Animals really talks about how that revolution gets taken away from you and turned into a product, and then Antichrist Superstar is where you're given a choice to decide if you're going to be controlled by the power that <b>you</b> <b>created</b> or if you want to destroy yourself and then start over. It just becomes a cycle." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to The Oxford Dictionary of Islam, shaytan in the {{singular}} and the plural shayateen {{are used in}} the Quran often interchangeably with Iblis, who is [...] "considered to be a particular shaytan." [...] In Islamic theology, Iblis is a being created from fire who was allowed to mingle with Angels in the heavens until he rejected the command of God to bow before Adam. When God created Adam, the first human, He said to the angels: [...] "And , when your Lord said to the angels, [...] "Indeed, I will make upon the earth a successive authority." [...] They said, [...] "Will You place upon it one who causes corruption therein and sheds blood, while we declare Your praise and sanctify You?" [...] Allah said, [...] "Indeed, I know that which you do not know." [...] All the angels prostrate, but Iblis does not. Iblis justified his decision, because he claims to be better than a human: [...] " [...] said, [...] "What prevented you from prostrating when I commanded you? [...] said, [...] "I am better than him. <b>You</b> <b>created</b> me from fire, and created him from clay." [...] Iblis requests a reprieve until the day of resurrection to try to mislead the people in any way he can. God reprieves Iblis but, He also warns that Iblis would have no authority over His ibād or [...] "servants". [...] "As for My servants, no authority shalt thou have over them." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cao Cao often praised Xun You and said, [...] "Gongda is {{intelligent}} but appears foolish; he is courageous but appears cowardly; he is resilient but appears weak. He neither flaunts {{his talents}} nor brags about his achievements. You {{can be as}} intelligent as him, but you can't pretend to be foolish {{as well as he}} does. Even Master Yan and Dou Wu cannot be compared to him." [...] When Cao Pi was still Cao Cao's heir apparent, his father told him, [...] "Xun Gongda is a role model for people. You should treat him courteously and respectfully." [...] When Xun You was ill, Cao Pi visited him and knelt down beside his bed; such was Cao Pi's level of respect for Xun You. Zhong Yao also once said, [...] "Every time I plan something, I'll carefully think through it again and again until I'm certain that I can't make any more changes. However, after consulting Gongda, he always has new insights to offer." [...] Xun <b>You</b> <b>created</b> 12 strategies for Zhong Yao. Zhong Yao died before he managed to finish writing a book about the 12 strategies, hence some of them were lost. The historian Pei Songzhi thought it was a huge pity that Xun You's strategies were lost because Zhong Yao {{died at the age of}} 79 – some 16 years after Xun You's death – so he probably should have had ample time to finish writing the book.|$|E

All that you had ever dreamt of mythology, all that you had ever seen of statuary, thronged upon you at that supreme moment, and, evolved from your own fancy, the river god was born.

You have little more to learn of me." ...|$|E
