6000|$|... "That is {{precisely}} why you must go back. This room is radioactive; all surface areas are. We calculate that <b>your</b> <b>suits</b> will not protect you for over fifty more minutes. Therefore--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Would {{you care}} to turn over <b>your</b> <b>suits</b> and guns?" [...] the A-class leady asked politely. [...] "The suits are uncomfortable and you'll have no need for weapons. The Russians have given up theirs, as you can see." ...|$|R
50|$|Next {{priority}} is to bid <b>your</b> longest <b>suit.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Hamet. Where {{found you}} {{confidence}} <b>your</b> <b>suit</b> to move? Our broken fortunes are not fit to love. Well; you declared your love:--What followed then? ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, stand not talking," [...] Sir Ralph said; [...] "it is {{time for}} you to change <b>your</b> <b>suits,</b> for these London {{citizens}} are, I have heard, precise as to their time, and the merchant would deem it a slight did you not arrive a few minutes before the stroke of the hour." ...|$|R

One could agree to bid up the line, or support partner's suit first.

60|$|Isa. There's Failer {{close in}} talk with my cousin; he's soliciting <b>your</b> <b>suit,</b> I warrant you, Sir Timorous: Do but observe with what passion he courts for you.|$|E

50|$|Tootie {{was outraged}} by the Mardi Gras Indians' violence, which was disrespecting the culture their {{ancestors}} had died for. Many nights after Carnival, Tootie would come home in a battered suit, covered in blood and bruises from the night’s events. Tootie spoke out against Indian gang violence and turned to music and dance {{as a way to}} express competitive showmanship. In the words of Tootie’s widow, Joyce Montana, Tootie was the first to say, “stop fighting with your guns, and begin fighting with <b>your</b> <b>suits</b> and minds".|$|R

6000|$|... "And {{there are}} good mercers and tailors from London always here to wait on the company at the Wells. You had better see them, my dear, for <b>your</b> <b>suit</b> {{is not of the}} very last fashion--a little lace----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'It was,' says Andy. 'It was his own. When I {{was looking}} at his curios {{yesterday}} {{he stepped out of}} the room for a moment and I pocketed it. Now, will you pick up <b>your</b> <b>suit</b> case and hurry?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have won}} <b>your</b> <b>suit,</b> my fair pleader," [...] cried the captain. [...] "This court finds the {{defendant}} not guilty, and the cruiser shall {{wait a few}} days longer {{that he may have}} an opportunity to come and thank the divine Portia." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, Worry, they're not a bad-looking lot. Slim and trim. We won't have to {{take off}} any beef. Here's Reddy Ray. I let you have him this year, Worry, but the track team will miss him. And here's Peg Ward. I was sure you'd pick him, Worry. And this is Homans, isn't it? I {{remember}} you in the freshmen games. The rest of you boys I'll have to get acquainted with.

6000|$|TRESHAM. [...] In a word, [...] Control's not {{for this}} lady; but her wish [...] To please me outstrips in its subtlety [...] My power of being pleased: herself creates [...] The want she means to satisfy. My heart [...] Prefers <b>your</b> <b>suit</b> to her as 'twere its own. [...] Can I say more? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{glad to hear}} this, Harry, {{and look}} upon {{it as a sign}} that you're coming to your right senses. Hetty would make a much safer and more {{rational}} companion than Jude, and would be much the most likely to listen to <b>your</b> <b>suit,</b> as the officers have, I greatly fear, unsettled her sister's mind." ...|$|E
50|$|Next {{priority}} is to bid <b>your</b> longest <b>suit</b> at the 1-level, promising 6-9 points and at least 4 cards in that suit. Do {{not go to the}} 2-level with less than 10 points.|$|R
