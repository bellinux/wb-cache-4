40|$|This paper {{presents}} ageneral longitudinal {{model for}} estimating school effects and their stability. Previous {{research on the}} stability of school performance over successive years has produced inconsistent findings. We argue that the findings have been inconsistent {{for at least two}} reasons: researchers have estimated ifferent <b>ypes</b> <b>of</b> school effects, and they have not distinguished between instability due to true changes in school performance and instability due to measurement and sampling error. We describe two different <b>ypes</b> <b>of</b> school effects, each relevant o a different policy audience, and we present a longitudinal model that is capable of separating true changes in school effects from sampling and measurement error. The model also provides a means for estimating the effects of school policies and practices while controlling statisti-cally for the effects of factors exogenous to the schooling system. This paper provides an example of the approach based on data describing two cohorts of students from one Education Authority in Scotland. It concludes with a discussion of the limitations of the model and implications for those collecting indicators of school performance for planning and evaluation purposes.

Their uncontested advantage in comparison with classical columns is their high stability in pH range from 2 to 12 {{where there is no}} possibility to use the classical columns. other advantages are their easy and cheap preparation and the absence of frits on the ends of the separating medium because the monolith is covalently bound to the inner side of the capillary [5]. On the other hand, their disadvantage remains to be worse in reproducibility of the stationary phase preparation than in case of classical columns. This PhD Thesis is focused on monoliths based on organic polymers, mainly the methacrylate monoliths. For the first time, this <b>ýpe</b> <b>of</b> monoliths was shown by Peters et al.
