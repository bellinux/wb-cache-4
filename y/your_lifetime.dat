Packer was then able to re-invest the proceeds in a 25% share in the Foxtel pay TV consortium.|$|E

2500|$|In {{his early}} years in Congress, he often issued press {{releases}} critical of shortcomings he detected in the armed forces. In 1973, he criticized the Air Force for devising a plan to purchase 200 beagle puppies, tie the dogs' vocal cords, and conduct tests of poisonous gases. After Aspin began a publicity campaign against the Air Force's plan, an outraged public sent {{a record number of}} letters to the Defense Department, surpassing the amount ever sent about any other subject. In March 1974, Aspin told an audience at Brown University, including future 4-star General Wesley Clark and four West Point cadets: [...] "You, the young officer and cadets sitting there - never in <b>your</b> <b>lifetimes</b> will you see us intervene abroad. We've learned that lesson." ...|$|R

After {{fighting}} for an idea all your life I realize that your backing has saved it for me and meant to thank you with all my heart and soul for what you have done. It has been marvelous. So many letters have been written and not mailed and owing to having been in bed {{a great deal of time}} this summer, the paintings were about all I could muster up enough energy to do what I considered the best of my ability. Just before Stieglitz’s death I took some paintings to him that I considered as having something new in the. He immediately walked right up to them and spoke of the new ideas. His intuition in that way was remarkable and I am so glad to have been allowed to live during his and <b>your</b> <b>lifetimes.</b> It has been a great privilege for which I am truly thankful.|$|R

60|$|And {{is there}} no potent and exhilarating cordial in a {{certainty}} like this? It has been the grand purpose of half <b>your</b> <b>lifetime</b> to obtain it.

2500|$|In 1975, Warner Bros. {{announced}} {{the production of}} a Superman movie to be directed by Richard Donner. Siegel publicly condemned the project and drew attention to his mistreatment by DC Comics. He found sympathizers such as Neal Adams and Jerry Robinson, who waged a public relations campaign for better treatment of comic creators in general. In order to avoid bad press, Warner Bros. agreed to give Siegel and Shuster a yearly stipend, medical benefits, and credit their names in all future Superman stories, in exchange for no longer contesting ownership of Superman. The stipend was initially $20,000"Warner will make monthly payments to each of you at the annual rate of $20,000 for <b>your</b> respective <b>lifetimes,</b> less any applicable withholding taxes, commencing January 1, 1976."

You are {{measuring}} life by its length, when its depth alone is of any import. I want {{no more than a}} year or two at the most, and I promise you, Mr. Scarlett Trent, my most estimable young companion, that, during that year, I will live more than you in <b>your</b> whole <b>lifetime.</b> I will drink deep of pleasures which you know nothing of, I will be steeped in joys which you will never reach more nearly than the man who watches a change in the skies or a sunset across the ocean!

6000|$|Mercy {{read the}} letter through. It was {{described}} by the writer as the last efforts of a dying man. Colonel Roseberry wrote affectionately of his daughter's merits, and regretfully of her neglected education--ascribing the latter to the pecuniary losses which had forced him to emigrate to Canada {{in the character of}} a poor man. Fervent expressions of gratitude followed, addressed to Lady Janet. [...] "I owe it to you," [...] the letter concluded, [...] "that I am dying with my mind at ease about the future of my darling girl. To your generous protection I commit the one treasure I have left to me on earth. Through <b>your</b> long <b>lifetime</b> you have nobly used your high rank and your great fortune as a means of doing good. I believe it will not be counted among the least of your virtues hereafter that you comforted the last hours of an old soldier by opening your heart and your home to his friendless child." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will have}} no foe to meet breast to breast," [...] he said; [...] "if we are to conquer and to root out these hornets it must be by showing {{ourselves}} even more active than they are. Speed and activity go for everything in a war like this, while our own methods of fighting are absolutely useless. Unless we make an end of this matter you may be called away from your homes once a year to repel these attacks, while if you conquer now {{there will be no}} Welsh foray again during <b>your</b> <b>lifetime.</b> Therefore it is worth while to make a great effort, and for once to lay aside our own method of fighting. Your commanders will see that all the exercises are well carried out, and will report to me regarding those who show most zeal and energy. Extra pay will be given to all, and I shall know how to reward those who are reported to me as most deserving of it." ...|$|E
60|$|THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. That is {{what the}} {{fortunate}} always say to the unfortunate. Well, I do not choose. I accept my three score and ten years. If they are filled with usefulness, with justice, with mercy, with good-will: if they are the lifetime of a soul that never loses its honor and a brain that never loses its eagerness, they are enough for me, because these things are infinite and eternal, and can make ten of my years as long as thirty of yours. I shall not conclude by saying live {{as long as you}} like and be damned to you, because I have risen for the moment far above any ill-will to you or to any fellow-creature; but I am your equal before that eternity in which the difference between <b>your</b> <b>lifetime</b> and mine is as the difference between one drop of water and three {{in the eyes of the}} Almighty Power from which we have both proceeded.|$|E

40|$|Making a difference: “If you devote {{yourself}} {{to being the}} best practitioner you can be, you will {{improve the lives of}} thousands of patients in <b>your</b> working <b>lifetime.</b> If you teach students and young doctors, you will help {{to improve the lives of}} hundreds of thousands of patients. If, through research, you change the way we all practise, you will help to improve the lives of millions. ” I still recall those inspiring words of my mentor Paul Freeling, who taught me about general practice as an undergraduate student, and then about primary care research as a half time research fellow, at St Georges, London. I like to think he was right, as research to which I’ve contributed has led to changes in practice within my working lifetime. Regular assessments of severely mentally ill patients,[1] and the use of questionnaires to measure severity of depression before treatment,[2] [3] are now widespread in UK general practice. Research in primary care is at the applied end of the spectrum, which means that useful results can be implemented for the benefit of patients within a few years of publication. <br/...|$|R

Surely, we cannot have commercial and political stability without cominertial and political honour! if, as a nation, we {{lose sight of the}} ideals which have carried us so far, which have so greatly modified the conditions of other peoples than ourselves, we shall perish as a force in the world.

That drawing was made {{with the aid of}} careful measurements, which you will find detailed in the text at page 230. Now, here again is the duplicate Wulfric--permit me to call it your Wulfric; and if you will compare the two you'll find, I think, that though your Wulfric is a great deal smaller than the original one, taken as a whole, yet on one diameter, the diameter from the letter U in Wulfric to the letter R in Rex, it is nearly an eighth of an inch broader than the specimen I have there figured. Well, sir, you may cut as much as you like off a coin, and make it smaller; but hang me if by cutting away at it for all <b>your</b> <b>lifetime</b> you can make it an eighth of an inch broader anyhow, in any direction." ...|$|E

Reflection and experience have {{brought me to}} favour this [...] latter method of holding landed property as on the whole the best, [...] though the arguments may not be all on one side. In the present [...] case, they are to my mind entirely conclusive. First, because I am [...] able thoroughly to repose in you an entire confidence as to your [...] use of the estate during <b>your</b> <b>lifetime,</b> and your capacity to [...] provide wisely for its future destination. Secondly, because you [...] have, delivered over to you with the estate, the duty and office of [...] progressively emancipating it from the once ruinous debt; and it is [...] almost necessary towards the satisfactory prosecution of this [...] purpose, which it may still take very many years to complete, that [...] you should be entire master of the property, and should feel the [...] full benefit of the steady care and attention which it ought to [...] receive from you.|$|E
5000|$|A {{very common}} and major goal of most Taoists {{is to achieve}} {{immortality}} rather than enter the regular after life. Reaching this goal is not easy; there are various tasks that must be met during <b>your</b> entire <b>lifetime</b> to be qualified to be immortal. The two different categories of requirements for immortality include internal alchemy and external alchemy. [...] External alchemy is mastering special breathing techniques, sexual practices, physical exercises, yoga, attempting to produce an elixir of immortality by consuming purified metals and complex compounds, and to develop medical skills. In Taoism one’s soul or energy {{is considered to be}} interlocked with the vital energy, which is what nourishes your soul. Ridding the body of impurities can increase this energy. Aside from these requirements, you must lead an upright, moral and good-hearted life. [...] Internal alchemy includes sophisticated visualization, strict dieting, specific sexual exercises and self-control. A strict diet was committed to kill demons within the body and to stimulate and maintain energy. The body is purified by the consumption of refined substances such as, jade or gold. The many different types of meditation all revolved around the common idea of breathing. Much of a Taoist’s time is spent meditating. A popular rule of thumb for breathing techniques include holding one’s breath for 12 heartbeats, better known as a “little tour”, 420 heartbeats is the “grand tour” and the most prominent achievement in breathing is holding one’s breath for 1000 heartbeats. Carl Jung was among those who interpreted internal alchemy in a purely spiritual, rather than physical, sense.|$|R

"Yet out of {{this evil}} comes some good, since because of his present affection for me, or my bust, I have now and again for your sake, Miriam, {{been able to do}} service, even to the saving of their lives, to those of your faith. Here there are many Christians whom it is an {{amusement}} to Nero to persecute, torture, and slay, sometimes by soaking them in tar and making of them living torches to illuminate his gardens, and sometimes in other fashions. The lives of sundry of these poor people he has given to me, when I begged them of him. Indeed, he has done more. Yesterday Nero came himself to the temple and suggested that certain of the Christians should be sacrificed in a very cruel fashion here as an offering to your spirit. I answered that this could give it little pleasure, seeing that in <b>your</b> <b>lifetime</b> you also were a Christian. Thereon he wrung his hands, crying out, 'Oh! what a crime have I committed,' and instantly gave orders that no more Christians should be killed.

60|$|Sir,--In <b>your</b> <b>lifetime</b> {{on earth}} {{you were not}} more than {{commonly}} curious {{as to what was}} said by 'the herd of mankind,' if I may quote your own phrase. It was that of one who loved his fellow-men, but did not in his less enthusiastic moments overestimate their virtues and their discretion. Removed so far away from our hubbub, and that world where, as you say, we 'pursue our serious folly as of old,' you are, one may guess, but moderately concerned about the fate of your writings and your reputation. As to the first, you have somewhere said, in one of your letters, that the final judgment on your merits as a poet {{is in the hands of}} posterity, and that you fear the verdict will be 'Guilty,' and the sentence 'Death.' Such apprehensions cannot have been fixed or frequent in the mind of one whose genius burned always with a clearer and steadier flame to the last. The jury of which you spoke has met: a mixed jury and a merciful. The verdict is 'Well done,' and the sentence Immortality of Fame. There have been, there are, dissenters; yet probably they will be less and less heard as the years go on.|$|E
