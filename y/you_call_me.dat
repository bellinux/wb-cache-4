25|$|One likely {{reason for}} the {{relatively}} few Japanese words for 'fool' is vagueness. In both English and Japanese, the words for 'fool' have meanings that vary along scales of friendly-hostile, or joking-serious. In English, {{at one end of}} a scale are words like silly goose and at the other end are words like stupid asshole. And in Japanese, at one end are words like kamaboko baka 蒲鉾馬鹿 'silly chump' and at the other end are words like baka-yarō 馬鹿野郎 'damn fool'. The difference is in the degree of lexical diversification along the scales of meaning. English seems to have more 'fool' words with more specificity – Japanese seems to have fewer 'fool' words with more vagueness. There are decided pragmatic and communicative advantages to such lexical vagueness. If <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>me</b> a stupid son-of-a-bitch, I know exactly what you mean. But if <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>me</b> a baka-yarō, I cannot be so sure of what you mean. The expression baka-yarō 馬鹿野郎 {{is one of the most}} insulting terms in the Japanese lexicon, but it is vague and can range in meaning from an affectionate 'silly-willy' to an abusive 'jerk-off fool'. Baka-yarō is so widely used that it has become semantically weak and vague. Such vagueness can serve to conceal hostility and thus to maintain social harmony.|$|E
500|$|Scottish {{producer}} and DJ Calvin Harris claimed that [...] "Yeah 3x" [...] plagiarised his 2009 single [...] "I'm Not Alone". He tweeted, [...] "Choked on my cornflakes when I heard [...] new Chris Brown single this morning. Do {{you know what}} I mean?" [...] After receiving many abusive messages from Brown's fans after posting the comment, he later tweeted, [...] "I don't care that <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>me</b> a nobody. Stealing is still stealing, doesn't matter who you are!...Because Chris Brown is an international celebrity doesn't make it OK to rip off a guy from [...] UK not many people have heard of." ...|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} is about a brokenhearted man who moves on from his past. A Rolling Stone {{reviewer}} called the song a [...] "breakup aria". According to Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian, [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] stands out for its [...] "slow-building sense of drama", which highlights Timberlake at his [...] "husky best". The song begins with the phrase [...] "You were my sun, you were my earth", which according to Timbaland was Timberlake's inspiration to write the song. Tanya L. Edwards of MTV News observed that Timberlake was wronged and said this is demonstrated by the lyrics: [...] "You don't have to say whatcha did / I already know, I found out from him / Now there's just no chance." [...] The chorus contains the lines: [...] "Told me you loved me, {{why did you leave}} me all alone / Now you tell me you need me when <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>me</b> on the phone." [...] Slant Magazines Sal Cinquemani called Timberlake's 2007 single [...] "What Goes Around... Comes Around" [...] an ostensible sequel to [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] both lyrically and musically. Jason Lipshutz of Billboard stated that aside from the presence of Timbaland's [...] "fantastically cluttered production", the difference between [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] and Timberlake's 2013 single [...] "Mirrors" [...] is clear: [...] "10 years ago, Timberlake was broken, and now he is whole".|$|E

I hear <b>you</b> <b>calling</b> <b>me.</b> And oh, the ringing gladness of your voice! The words that made me longing heart rejoice You spoke, do you remember? and my heart Still hears the distant music of your voice! I hear <b>you</b> <b>calling</b> <b>me.</b> Though years have {{stretched}} their weary length between, And on your grave the mossy grass I green: I stand, do you behold me? listening here, Hearing your voice through all the years between.

500|$|The booklet {{contains}} outdated {{discussions of}} health and well-being. Other notes in the booklet, dealing with life and death reflections, {{seem to be more}} personal, like a message typed on one of the last pages, supposedly referring to the loss of a loved one ("I waited all day. You waited all day...but you left before sunset...and I {{just wanted to tell you}} the moment was beautiful. Just wanted to dance to bad music...drive bad cars...watch bad TV...should have stayed for the sunset... if not for me."). The booklet also displays some poems or original sayings not belonging to the songs' lyrics, but to be interpreted as a commentary to the songs and, again, as a reflection on how life should or shouldn't be lived. An example is the poem typed on the [...] "Aye Davanita" [...] page. The song's subtitle is [...] "The song without words", as it is an instrumental track. But the page displays a sort of poem about the wasted life of a young girl. Another episode of [...] "intruder words" [...] is on the [...] "Not for You" [...] lyrics page. After the second refrain, instead of the actual lyrics, the typed words give a hint about the Sisyphus myth ("Yeah, <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>me</b> Sisyphus love. Yeah, I move the rock. I just don't want to talk about moving the rock. Anything that distracts me from moving the rock"). The lyrics to [...] "Whipping" [...] are written on a copy of a petition to Bill Clinton against [...] "pro-life" [...] killings of abortion doctors. An X-ray of Vedder's teeth was pictured instead of lyrics on the page for [...] "Corduroy".|$|E

This new province will be, according to my scheme, a part of the proposed Indian Federation. Pakistan scheme (i.e., scheme of Ch. Rahmat Ali) proposes a separate federation of Muslim Provinces directly related to England as a separate dominion. This scheme originated in Cambridge. The authors of this scheme believe that we Muslim Round Tablers have sacrificed the Muslim nation on the altar of Hindu or the so called Indian Nationalism.|$|E

2500|$|Regarding The Thing, by John Carpenter, I've asked him, {{as he was}} {{preparing}} some electronic music with an assistant to edit on the film, [...] "Why did <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>me,</b> {{if you want to}} do it on your own?" [...] He surprised me, he said - [...] "I got married to your music. This is why I've called you." [...] I was quite amazed, he called me because he had my music at his wedding. Then when he showed me the film, later when I wrote the music, we didn't exchange ideas. He ran away, nearly ashamed of showing it to me. I wrote the music on my own without his advice. Naturally, as I had become quite clever since 1982, I've written several scores relating to my life. And I had written one, which was electronic music. And [...] took the electronic score.|$|E
2500|$|Jean Grey {{appears in}} The Super Hero Squad Show, voiced by Hynden Walch. In the episode [...] "Mysterious Mayhem at Mutant Academy", {{she is the}} only {{cheerleader}} at X-Men academy.

I'll rap you with a mental hurl, if <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>me</b> Marvel Girl! Go Mutants!), after she's done her cheer she uses the Phoenix Force and creates a heavy windstorm in the hallway to open the lockers and find a fractal while under Ringmaster's control. Oddly while the comic book cover intro for the episode shows Jean wearing a childlike version of her classic Phoenix costume, she wears a cheerleader uniform with a X-logo in the actual episode. She also makes an appearance in the episode [...] "Ice Man Cometh" [...] where she is telekinetically keeping the water from the melted ice caps from hitting the school.|$|E
