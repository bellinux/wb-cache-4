40|$|DNA from healthy Malaysian newborns was studied on gene maps after {{digestion}} {{with different}} restriction endonucleases. Of 65 newborns, two {{were found to}} be carriers of two different variants of triplicated alpha-globin loci. In <b>variant</b> <b>no.</b> 1, found in an Malay, the three alpha-globin genes are in an elongated DNA fragment on digestion with Eco RI and Bam HI. The third alpha-globin gene was found in a additional 3. 7 -kb fragment on digestion with Hpa I, Bgl II and Hind III. In <b>variant</b> <b>no.</b> 2, a new type of triplicated alpha-globin loci, found in a Chinese, the three alpha-globin genes reside in an elongated DNA fragment longer than that of <b>variant</b> <b>no.</b> 1 on digestion with Eco RI and Bam HI. The third alpha-globin gene was found in an additional 4. 2 -kb fragment on digestion with Hpa I and Hind III. Digestion of this variant DNA with Bg 1 II produced an abnormal 16. 7 -kb fragment in addition to the normal 7. 0 -kb Bgl-II fragment. The locations of the restriction sites in the two types of triplicated alpha-globin loci are compatible with a mechanism of unequal crossing over following two different modes of misalignment...|$|R

40|$|Ferritin is a {{widespread}} iron mineralizing and detoxification protein that stores iron as a hydrous ferric oxide mineral core within a shell-like structure of 4 / 3 / 2 octahedral symmetry. Iron mineralization is initiated at dinuclear ferroxidase centers inside the protein where Fe(2 +) and O(2) meet and react to form a mu- 1, 2 -peroxodiferric intermediate that subsequently decays to form mu-oxo dimeric and oligomeric iron(III) species and ultimately the mineral core. Several types of channels penetrate the protein shell and are possible pathways for the diffusion of iron and dioxygen to the ferroxidase centers. In the present study, UV/visible and fluorescence stopped-flow spectrophotometries {{were used to determine}} the kinetics and pathways of Fe(2 +) diffusion into the protein shell, its binding at the ferroxidase center and its subsequent oxidation by O(2). Three fluorescence variants of human H-chain ferritin were prepared in which Trp 34 was introduced near the ferroxidase center. They included a control <b>variant</b> <b>no.</b> 1 (W 93 F/Y 34 W), a " 1 -fold" channel <b>variant</b> <b>no.</b> 2 (W 93 F/Y 34 W/Y 29 Q) and a 3 -fold channel <b>variant</b> <b>no.</b> 3 (Y 34 W/W 93 F/D 131 I/E 134 F). Anaerobic rapid mixing of Fe(2 +) with apo-variant no. 1 quenched the fluorescence of Trp 34 with a rate exhibiting saturation kinetics with respect to Fe(2 +) concentration, consistent with a process involving facilitated diffusion. A half-life of approximately 3 ms for this process is attributed to the time for diffusion of Fe(2 +) across the protein shell to the ferroxidase center. No fluorescence quenching was observed with the 3 -fold channel <b>variant</b> <b>no.</b> 3 or when Zn(2 +) was prebound in each of the eight 3 -fold channels of <b>variant</b> <b>no.</b> 1, observations indicating that the hydrophilic channels are the only avenues for rapid Fe(2 +) access to the ferroxidase center. Substitution of Tyr 29 with glutamine at the entrance of the " 1 -fold" hydrophobic channel had no effect on the rate of Fe(2 +) oxidation to form the mu- 1, 2 -peroxodiferric complex (t(1 / 2) approximately 38 ms), a finding demonstrating that Tyr 29 and, by inference, the " 1 -fold" channels do not facilitate O(2) transport to the ferroxidase center, contrary to predictions of DFT and molecular dynamics calculations. O(2) diffusion into ferritin occurs on a time scale that is fast relative to the millisecond kinetics of the stopped-flow experiment...|$|R

40|$|The work {{treats the}} static recalculation of an {{existing}} roof structure of a construction for social purposes and proposes two variants of {{the design of a}} new roof structure. The construction has a rectangular ground plan of 30 m x 47 m and the roof structure is placed on the load bearing circumference concrete walls. Except for the load constituted by the function of the construction and by the climatic area, an extra load of 2 tons suspended at any place of the structure is considered because of the special requirement of working and technological equipment. The <b>variant</b> <b>no.</b> 1 is designed from the steel S 355. The <b>variant</b> <b>no.</b> 2 is designed as a combination of the wood GL 24 h and the aluminium EN-AW 5083.
