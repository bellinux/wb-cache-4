Their needs and exigencies grow...owing to the luxury in which they have been brought up. Hence they impose fresh taxes on their subjects...and sharply raise the rate of old taxes to {{increase}} their yield...But the effects on business of this rise in taxation make themselves felt. For business men are soon discouraged by the comparison of their profits with the burden of their taxes...Consequently production falls off, and with it the <b>yield</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxation.</b>|$|E

5000|$|A {{limiting}} {{factor in determining}} the government budget is the capacity to tax. Per capita income (PCI) is the most often used measure of relative fiscal capacity. [...] But this measure fails to base tax capacity computation on other important tax bases like the sales and property tax and corporate income taxes. A representative tax system should assess the level of personal income, the value of retail sales {{and the value of}} property to compute fiscal capacity. To do so the average tax rate for each base is computed by dividing the total revenue derived by the total value of the base. Thus, as an example, income taxes collected would be divided by total income to <b>yield</b> a rate <b>of</b> <b>taxation.</b>|$|R
