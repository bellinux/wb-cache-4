25|$|Two years {{previous}} to {{the present}} day events, a rider arrives to the Witch's Hut from Brave, and demands to show themselves and asks for magic. The person, King Fergus, is met by a witch who asks what he wants and he says he needs something to ensure the future of his kingdom and says he will pay the price. She says he can pay her later and calls it an IOU and offers him a contract to sign and he stamps it with his signet ring. She says it’s a deal and she blends up a potion using a pluck of his hair. Later on, Fergus and Merida walking among the clans. Fergus says he’ll take the tongue of the next man who disrespects her. She sees the men writing and thinks they’re sending love notes but Fergus says they’re writing their last will and testaments. Fergus also gave Merida his prized bow that she can carry into her first battle, and Merida thanked her father for keeping her safe. Merida pulls a sword and challenges the man who knocks her down, but the person who defeated her was Mulan, who says she can teach her how to fight better than any man there and will teach her honor as well. Some of the men watching mock her and call Mulan her nursemaid, but tells her no one will follow her out of fear and says to ask her father since they already follow him. Later that day, Merida came looking for him by the water. He says the invaders are sailing in and he’s watching for them. She asks if they will win the war and then says she wants to know how he inspired all these men to follow him into battle. He looks at the helm and she asks if everything is all right. Fergus says <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> you’re the first one willing to die and says that tells them how important it is. He tells her he’s the Bear King and can face anything. She sees her father with the helm and discovers that Mulan had kept Merida from going with him. When she arrived and sees a knight coming towards Fergus, Merida aims an arrow at the knight, but misses as the knight kills Fergus. The Knight removes his helm, who is then revealed to be Arthur.|$|E

With obvious parallels {{to her own}} activities, she describes her vision for the piece: [...] "Il s'agit d'exprimer la puissance de la femme. Samson n'est rien, là. C'est le cadavre de la force. Dalila, c'est la passion qui ruine tout." [...] ("What <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> {{is the power of}} woman. Samson is a secondary consideration. He is the corpse of dead strength.

500|$|Despite {{doing well}} in his A-level examinations, because of his report from Harrow {{he was unable to}} obtain a place at any university. After working as a {{gardener}} for two years, and a stint as an office worker which he loathed, he discovered that he enjoyed acting and enrolled at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA). During his time there he appeared in numerous theatre productions, including the lead roles of Gregers Werle in Ibsen's The Wild Duck, Marcus Andronicus in Titus Andronicus, and Stephen Daedalus in an adaptation of James Joyce's novel Ulysses. However, he was disappointed to find that he was treated [...] "like a nonce" [...] for being an Old Harrovian. He also made himself more unpopular by being outspoken and taking on roles in his second and third years despite the practice being forbidden by school policy. One of these was his first break into film – the 2001 horror-thriller The Hole. Fox feels that in landing the role his name [...] "probably helped – it's a combination of timing, luck and contacts". Nonetheless, [...] "the name opens some doors, but then <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> you can do the job".|$|E

Somebody at Hasbro (who was actually sort of a genius) named Bob Pruprish, realized that a comic book was protected under the first amendment, and there couldn't be restrictions based on how you advertised for a publication.|$|R
5000|$|The Telethon company put on {{a contest}} for the {{campaign}} despite the few sponsors involved that year.

To qualify for the draw, <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> a preference for products and services available on that Telethon. The prize was a total of $ 1,000,000 in products associated with the 16th solidarity campaign.|$|R
2500|$|Subsequently, both Reese and Alan Truscott {{published}} {{books on}} the scandal. Reese's book stated: [...] "The basis of the charge, as everybody knows, is that Schapiro and I communicated length in hearts to one another by means of illegal signals. If you want to support that charge by reference to the hands played, what <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> is {{that a number of}} illogical, uncharacteristic, and implausible bids or plays were made that can be explained only on the basis that the players had improper knowledge of one another's hands." [...] It then goes on to argue for the logic of the pair's bidding and play on the various hands from the Olympiad. Truscott's book emphasizes the unlikelihood of the observed variations in finger signals being coincidental, or of such a large number of witnesses colluding to fabricate the evidence.|$|E

2500|$|Apparently, Cao Hong had {{previously}} offended Cao Zhen, another relative of Cao Cao who {{also served as}} a general in Wei. In 224, when Cao Zhen returned from a campaign, Cao Pi ordered Wu Zhi to host a banquet in his residence in Cao Zhen's honour. During the banquet, Wu Zhi instructed actors to put up a skit to make fun of Cao Zhen and Zhu Shuo (朱鑠), who were fat and thin respectively. Cao Zhen was enraged and he shouted at Wu Zhi, [...] "Are you and your men seeking a fight with me and my men?" [...] Cao Hong and Wang Zhong egged Wu Zhi on by saying, [...] "If you want to make the General (Cao Zhen) admit that he is fat, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> that you're thin." [...] Cao Zhen drew his sword, glared at them and said, [...] "I'll kill whoever dares to mock me." [...] When Cao Hong got into trouble later, Cao Zhen told Cao Pi, [...] "If Cao Hong is to be executed, he'll definitely say something nasty about me." [...] Cao Pi replied, [...] "I'll deal with him myself. Why do you need to worry?" ...|$|E

2500|$|EastEnders {{programme}} makers {{took the}} decision that the show was to be about [...] "everyday life" [...] {{in the inner city}} [...] "today" [...] and regarded it as a [...] "slice of life". Creator/producer Julia Smith declared that [...] "We don't make life, we reflect it". She also said, [...] "We decided to go for a realistic, fairly outspoken type of drama which could encompass stories about homosexuality, rape, unemployment, racial prejudice, etc., in a believable context. Above all, we wanted realism". In 2011, the head of BBC drama, John Yorke, said that the real East End had changed significantly since EastEnders started, and the show no longer truly reflected real life, but that it had an [...] "emotional truthfulness" [...] and was partly [...] "true to the original vision" [...] and partly [...] "adapt to a changing world", adding that [...] "If it was a show where every house cost a fortune and everyone drove a Lexus, it wouldn't be EastEnders. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> shades of that change, but certain things are immutable, I would argue, like The Vic and the market." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 224, Cao Pi ordered Wu Zhi to host {{a banquet}} in his {{residence}} to celebrate Cao Zhen's return from a campaign. In Cao Pi's imperial edict, all officers holding the rank of Senior General (上將軍) with [...] "Specially Advanced" [...] (特進) status and below had to attend. During the banquet, Wu Zhi instructed actors {{to put up a}} skit to make fun of Cao Zhen and Zhu Shuo (朱鑠), who were fat and thin respectively. Cao Zhen turned furious and he shouted at Wu Zhi, [...] "Are you and your men seeking a fight with me and my men?"

[...] Wu Zhi also drew his sword and insulted Cao Zhen by saying, [...] "Cao Zidan, you're not meat under a butcher's cleaver. My throat won't tremble when I swallow you and my teeth won't chatter when I chew on you. How dare you behave so rudely!" [...] Zhu Shuo stood up and tried to reduce tensions by telling Wu Zhi, [...] "His Majesty ordered you to host entertainment for everyone. Do you have to do this?" [...] Wu Zhi then shouted at Zhu Shuo, [...] "Zhu Shuo, how dare you leave your seat!" [...] Everyone then returned to their seats. Zhu Shuo felt outraged but did not say anything, and returned to his seat and used his sword to hit the ground.|$|E

Half my time, I suppose, has been spent in primeval surroundings; the rest in contact with the latest efforts of a rather unfinished civilization. Well, what <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> me here is vastly different. These old houses, your smoothed-down ways, are a revelation to me. The polish on some of your furniture has taken several hundred years to put on; that in my Victoria quarters smells of the factory, and the board walls of other hotels I've lived in rend into big cracks because they're fresh from the mill. I'm full of interest; everything's new to me. But so far my curiosity's impersonal; I'm taking no hand in anything." ...|$|E
60|$|Of {{course the}} great {{government}} stores {{are in the}} capitals, and practically there are no stores in the villages, except for {{what you might call}} emergency supplies. But you must not imagine, Dolly, that shopping, here, is like shopping at home--or in America, as I am learning to say, for Altruria is home now. That is, you don't fill your purse with bank-notes, or have things charged. You get everything you want, within reason, and certainly everything you need, for nothing. You have only to provide yourself with a card, something like that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> at the Army and Navy Stores in London, when you first go to buy there, which certifies that you belong to this or that working-phalanx, and that you have not failed in the Obligatories for such and such a length of time. If you are not entitled to this card, you had better not go shopping, for there is no possible equivalent for it which will enable you to carry anything away or have it sent to your house. At first I could not help feeling rather indignant when I was asked to show my work-card in the stores; I had usually forgotten to bring it, or sometimes I had brought my husband's card, which would not do at all, unless I could say that I had been ill or disabled, for a woman is expected to work quite the same as a man. Of course her housework counts, and as we are on a sort of public mission, they count our hours of travel as working-hours, especially as Aristides has made it a point of good citizenship for us to stop every now and then and join in the Obligatories when the villagers were getting in the farm crops or quarrying stone or putting up a house. I am never much use in quarrying or building, but I come in strong in the hay-fields or the apple orchards or the orange groves.|$|E
