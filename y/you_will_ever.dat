500|$|Madonna: Like an Icon was {{released}} on 27 August 2007, in the United Kingdom by Bantam Press. The book cover was designed by Holly MacDonald, with an image of Madonna from 2002, during the premiere of her film, Swept Away. It {{was released}} {{more than a year}} later in the United States. The biography faced mixed reviews from critics. Sarah Churchwell from The Guardian criticized O'Brien's extended commentary about Madonna's recording process. She believed that more emphasis should have been given on Madonna's personal life as well. Pointing out examples like Madonna's relationship with actor Warren Beatty, which was widely covered in the media but was only lightly touched in the book, Churchwell wondered about the claim of the book in its press release: [...] "This is the closest <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>ever</b> come to Madonna's autobiography". The reviewer concluded by saying, [...] "Since her voice is nowhere in evidence, this book, however capable and intelligent its writer, is probably about the farthest <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>ever</b> get from Madonna's autobiography." ...|$|E

[...] Many Mets players were rooting for Davis to break camp with the team, but he was sent down to the minors at the end of spring training. [...] On April 19, however, the Mets purchased Davis's minor league contract. At that point Davis had played only 65 games in his life above the Single-A level.|$|E

GameSpot considered the game's sound its weakest point, but still commended it, claiming it has [...] "more 'quality' songs than Final Fantasy VII".

Both Colin and his brother Keith inherited their father's love of rugby; Keith played as a flanker for Australia between 1936 and 1946, with his career interrupted by the Second World War. According to author Max Howell, Keith was a [...] "football genius", and was a star during the 1937 South African tour of Australia.

Keith was on the ill-fated 1939 Wallaby tour to England; the team docked at Plymouth, {{but the next day}} war was declared and they returned to Australia without playing a game.

After Thome hit his 600th home run, Twins closer Joe Nathan said, [...] "He is the world's nicest man." [...] Teammate Michael Cuddyer added, [...] "He is the nicest, gentlest, kindest guy <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>ever</b> meet... to everything except the baseball, he still hits that really hard." [...] His kindness comes up in conversations with many MLB players. When he signed with the Phillies in the offseason before the 2012 season, Phillies general manager Rubén Amaro, Jr. cited Thome's constant positive attitude as a main reason for his signing. As an exercise in remaining humble, he annually visited his high school prior to spring training. A Sports Illustrated article said that Thome frequently signs autographs for fans and that he is [...] "endlessly patient with requests".

500|$|Other {{critics were}} not as pleased with Dragon Warrior VII.

Game Informer even went as {{far as to say that}} [...] "four million Japanese can be wrong", referring to the game's immense popularity in Japan. Because of the game's delay in being developed, its release was after the PlayStation 2's release, which created some negative feedback, particularly about the game's graphics. IGN commented on this, calling the game [...] "a game that makes only a bare minimum of concessions to advancing technology, but more than makes up for this with its deep gameplay, massive quest, and sheer variety." [...] GameSpot called the graphics [...] "not good" [...] and warned readers that if the [...] "most rewarding things" [...] they [...] "got out of Final Fantasy VII were the full-motion video interludes, you definitely won't be wowed by anything you see in Dragon Warrior VII." ...|$|E

Matthew Perpetua wrote a positive review of [...] "Hair", describing it as another inspirational {{song in the}} mold of [...] "Born This Way", but {{felt that it was}} a bit weirder. Perpetua concluded the review by jokingly adding that the song will become [...] "n anthem for salons everywhere." [...] Jody Rosen from the same publication felt that [...] "although Gaga is not the first singer to create a connection between self-esteem and liberation to free-flowing coiffure, she seems to be the most committed to the idea." [...] Dan Martin from NME classified [...] "Hair" [...] as an empowerment anthem, using the [...] "simple image of the wind blowing through a person’s hair to illuminate the album’s Love-Yourself-And-Let-It-All-Hang-Out message way more effectively than the title track. It trumps it once again by being quite the gayest thing <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>ever</b> hear for a long time." [...] Tim Jonze from The Guardian felt that the message of [...] "Hair" [...] was not particularly a new one, since the 60's musical Hair also preached the same message. Although he described some of the lyrics as [...] "trite", Jonze opined that [...] "these weaknesses can also be strengths, and there's something admirable about the way the [...] address confused teenagers in search of their identity." [...] Writing for The Vancouver Sun, Leah Collins described the song as [...] "a pumping anthem designed to pump up your follicles with pride."

And fun it was, with the gang of New Directions taking on Valentine's Day, with flirting, kissing and, of course, singing. Without the bullying, this was a much lighter episode of Glee, and the results gave way to a lot more laughs and story development." [...] He went on to praise Ashley Fink's performance as Lauren Zizes, and said of Puck's falling in love with Lauren, [...] "I can't decide if I want to root for this couple, but I certainly know I'm going to be rooting for Lauren." [...] Canning ultimately gave the episode an 8.5 out of 10. Wyndham Wyeth of Paste went on to praise the episode for its depiction of relationships in high school, as well as the backing vocals for Salling's performance of [...] "Fat Bottomed Girls" [...] by Queen. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a positive review and a grade of [...] "A−": Silly Love Songs' is a fine example of the show at what's very nearly its absolute best. There’s nothing too heady here, but if the show has one tone that it's nailed almost completely consistently, it’s the feeling of teenage romance, the sense that the person you're in love with is the only person <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>ever</b> be in love with [...] followed almost immediately by the crippling feeling of heartbreak, of losing that person too soon. Teenage life moves fast and is filled with heightened emotions. And like most musicals, Glee has always been at its best when it embraces those two sides of its characters' lives. As such, 'Silly Love Songs', which is pretty much just an excuse to play around with the show's many romantic pairings among its glee club characters, is a lot of fun without trying all that hard." [...] In conclusion of his review, he wrote, [...] "The best episodes play that elation and devastation off of each other. The worst episodes flounder about for some sort of emotional foothold. But when Glee just tells small, sweet stories about these kids and the ways they're trying to cope with being in high school when they know they're meant for bigger things, it can be terrific. Tonight was one of those episodes, and tonight's episode was terrific. Here's to a good February sweeps." ...|$|E
