40|$|ABSTRACT: The paper {{contains}} {{a description of}} a newly <b>introduced</b> <b>slug</b> species, Deroceras panormitanum (Lessona et Pollonera, 1882), spreading in Europe for several dozen years and now discovered in SW Poland, in the city of Wrocaw. One third of slugs recorded from Poland are introduced species, some of them starting to penetrate also habitats under negligible human impact.

25|$|The same snails {{that some}} people raise or gather as food also are {{agricultural}} pests that cause considerable crop damage. <b>Introduced</b> <b>slug</b> and snail varieties tend to be worse pests than native species, probably {{due in part to}} the lack of natural controls. Snail pests attack crops ranging from leafy vegetables to fruits that grow near the ground, such as strawberries and tomatoes, to citrus fruits high up on trees.|$|R

The vinyl was purchased without graffiti protection, and so it does not wear well if vandalised. Several sets are run with their 'M' logos missing or worn away.|$|R
50|$|This slug {{species was}} {{originally}} described and named from specimens collected in Ireland. In 1842, an Irish naturalist named William Andrews (1802-1880) sent material {{that he had}} found at Caragh Lake in County Kerry to the Irish naturalist George James Allman, who then <b>introduced</b> the <b>slug</b> to science as a new species.|$|R

In May, we collected new specimens of different ages in the same locality, indoor garden of Hyatt Regency Belgrade hotel. In the case of large population densities Valencia slug could cause severe damage to greenhouse plants in our country, yet it is unlikely that it could survive winter outdoor in Serbia, and we do not expect its permanent outdoor establishment...|$|R

50|$|Diarylide yellow {{pigments}} {{are considered}} to be non-toxic. However, {{there is some evidence that}} these pigments can break down when exposed to temperatures above 200 degrees C to release 3,3'-Dichlorobenzidine, which is a carcinogen and is listed in the U.S. EPA’s Toxics Release Inventory. 3,3’-dichlorobenzidine is structurally similar to one of the polychlorinated biphenyl congeners, PCB 11 (3,3’-dichlorobiphenyl), and there is some evidence that the use of diarylide <b>yellow</b> pigments <b>introduces</b> PCB 11 to the environment.|$|R
50|$|Rosa hemisphaerica, {{also known}} as the sulphur rose, is a rose species with pale yellow flowers native to western Asia.

Some factors continue to threaten the individuals that have been planted in the habitat, such as fires started during military exercises and through arson.|$|R

In the 1940s, <b>yellow</b> was <b>introduced,</b> and would eventually become the team's primary color, replacing white altogether; black would become the secondary color, used in their alternate kit.|$|R
