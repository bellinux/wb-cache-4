25|$|Again and again, {{revert to}} your old principlesâ€”seek peace and ensue it; leave America, {{if she has}} taxable matter in her, to tax herself. I am not here going into the distinctions of rights, nor {{attempting}} to mark their boundaries. I do not enter into these metaphysical distinctions; I hate the very sound of them. Leave the Americans as they anciently stood, and these distinctions, born of our unhappy contest, will die along with it... Be content to bind America by laws of trade; <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> done it... Do not burthen them with taxes... But if intemperately, unwisely, fatally, you sophisticate and poison the very source of government by urging subtle deductions, and consequences odious to those you govern, from the unlimited and illimitable nature of supreme sovereignty, you will teach them by these means to call that sovereignty itself in question... If that sovereignty and their freedom cannot be reconciled, which will they take? They will cast your sovereignty in your face. No body of men will be argued into slavery.|$|E
500|$|With ten {{points on}} offer for {{the winner of}} the Grand Prix, it was {{possible}} that Hamilton would clinch the Championship in Shanghai. Massa remained confident, saying that the race was just like any other: [...] "You have a pressure but it is a different pressure, but <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> the pressure on your side." ...|$|E
2500|$|Early {{into his}} journey, he meets an old king named Melchizedek or {{the king of}} Salem, who tells him to sell his sheep so as to travel to Egypt and {{introduces}} {{the idea of a}} Personal Legend. Your Personal Legend [...] "is what <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> wanted to accomplish. Everyone, when they are young, knows what their Personal Legend is." [...] He adds that [...] "when you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it." [...] This is the core theme of the book.|$|E

6000|$|... "Ah--that public-house {{experience}} {{accounts for}} your knowing about the adulteration of the ale {{when we went}} and had some that Sunday evening. I thought when I married <b>you</b> that <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> lived in your father's house." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course, {{that was}} where he thought <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> belonged." [...] Mrs. Erwin lay {{quiescent}} for a while, in apparent uncertainty as to how she should next attack the subject. [...] "How did you first meet?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Olympio {{broke his}} silence, {{which was the}} subject of much speculation, in a letter {{published}} on 21 February. In that letter, he expressed confidence in Fabre and told his supporters: [...] "I will never forget the moments of enthusiasm and confidence <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> shown in all circumstances, and I thank you forever." [...] In a radio interview on 23 February, however, he stressed that he was still in charge of the UFC. Regarding his delayed and arguably unenthusiastic endorsement of Fabre, he said that it had been necessary to consult with other political actors before backing Fabre, and he pointed to his health as the reason he was unable to accompany Fabre on the campaign trail.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{his final}} {{departure}} from Rideau Hall as governor general, Massey retired to Batterwood House, {{in the village}} of Canton, near Port Hope, Ontario. For his service to the Crown, he was awarded from the Queen the Royal Victorian Chain, making him the second non-royal or non-head of state, the first Canadian, and one of the only two Canadians to have ever received the honour. Just prior {{to the end of his}} time as governor general, the Queen wrote to Massey: [...] "I wish to send you my congratulations and my sincere thanks for the manner in which you have discharged [...] duties. I know that as my personal representative <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> sought to maintain the right relationship between the Crown and the people of Canada. I am grateful to you for this because I regard it as the most important function among the many duties of the appointment which you have held with such distinction." [...] The Queen had wanted to appoint Massey as a Knight of the Order of the Garter, but Prime Minister John Diefenbaker, after consulting the rest of Cabinet, advised the Queen against conferring the honour.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{arguing that}} Austen's novels have feminist elements, {{scholars}} have still noted {{that women are}} frequently represented as confined in Austen's novels {{and that there are}} few depictions of female authority figures. Women are literally confined in small spaces but are constrained even more effectively by social factors such as [...] "miseducation" [...] and [...] "financial dependency". Gilbert and Gubar argue that women [...] "must acquiesce in their own confinement, no matter how stifling" [...] because [...] "they are too vulnerable in the world at large". For example, in Persuasion Anne Elliot describes the differences between men and women: [...] "We live at home, quiet, confined, and our feelings prey upon us. You are forced on exertion. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> a profession, pursuits, business of some sort or other, to take you back into the world immediately, and continual occupation and change soon weaken impressions." [...] Butler points out that Austen's novels lack depictions of female mentors or authority figures. In the novels, Butler argues, women do not progress from ignorance to knowledge, for example, {{and many of them are}} [...] "oddly and even unnaturally ineffective". Instead, they marry authority figures. As Gilbert and Gubar put it, [...] "becoming a woman means relinquishing achievement and accommodating oneself to men and the spaces they provide". For example, in Persuasion, as Mary and Louisa grow up they lose their independence and become reliant on those around them.|$|E
60|$|If McDowell's {{force was}} now beyond our reach, {{we should be}} utterly helpless. Apprehension of {{something}} like this, and no unwillingness to sustain <b>you,</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> been my reason for withholding McDowell's force from you. Please understand this, and {{do the best you}} can with the force <b>you</b> <b>have.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no; {{you were}} better employed. You need {{not tell me}} that <b>you</b> <b>had</b> a {{pleasant}} evening. I see it in your eye. I perfectly see how the hours passed: that <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> something agreeable to listen to. In the intervals of the concert it was conversation." ...|$|R
60|$|MADAME. Don't interrupt: Up {{to within}} a short time <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> lived from hand to mouth-now you are in easy circumstances--for which you need give credit to no one but yourself. The turning point in your life {{occurred}} in 1840-7-8.|$|R

'I {{knew you}} were embarrassed, sir,' {{returned}} the son, raising his head for a moment, and then falling into his former attitude, 'but I had no idea we were the beggared wretches you describe. How could I suppose it, bred as I have been; witnessing the life <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> led; and the appearance <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> made?' ...|$|E

Well, then, your man, Jim 'Arisen, fights Crab Wilson, of Gloucester, at Crawley Down to-morrow mornin' for a stake." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Pasmer {{dropped her}} eyes and fingered {{the edge of her}} fan with a submissiveness that seemed to Mrs. Brinkley the {{perfection}} of duplicity; she wanted to shake her. [...] "I knew," [...] sighed Mrs. Pasmer, [...] "that <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> been such a friend of his." ...|$|R

6000|$|Lowe {{described}} as perfectly unjust and unfounded the criticisms [...] {{which had been}} made of your leadership. <b>You</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> been [...] courteous and conciliatory with the whole House and with [...] individual members, including himself.

6000|$|Felix was red {{up to the}} ears. His eight years' {{seniority}} to Lance {{were eight}} times eight more shyness and embarrassment, but he could only obey; and at his first greeting his hand was taken--'hoped to <b>have</b> seen <b>you</b> sooner,' the Bishop said; 'but <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> escaped me in the vestry.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, come, mine {{host of the}} Hand and Bottle," [...] {{he cried}} in his usual hard, sarcastic tone; [...] "be a man {{as much as in}} <b>you</b> lies. <b>You</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> a foolish trick of repentance; but, as I remember, it was {{commonly}} of a morning, before <b>you</b> <b>had</b> swallowed your first dram.
