As I [...] write, our towns are near deserted. They look as languid as a [...] consumptive girl. What has become of our sinewy and athletic [...] fellow-citizens? They are coursing through ravines and over [...] mountain tops. Their tracks are visible in every direction. [...] Occasionally a horseman will dash among us. His steed betrays [...] hard usage.

"The English general," [...] Jack said, [...] "has {{heard that}} the people of <b>your</b> <b>neighborhood</b> are hostile, and that those who would pass through with animals and stores for the army are {{prevented}} from doing so.

Those who take up arms he will meet with arms; but so long as they interfere not with him he makes no inquiry as to whether their wishes are for King Charles or Philip of Anjou; but if they evince an active hostility he will be forced to punish them. You know how Marshal Tesse has massacred unarmed citizens whom he deemed hostile, and none could blame the English general did he carry out reprisals; but it will grieve him to have to do so. He has therefore sent me with this small troop to warn you that if the people of this village and district interfere in any way with his friends, or evince signs of active hostility, he will send a regiment of horse with orders to burn the village to the ground, and to lay all the district bare." ...|$|E
6000|$|Now if the {{doctrines of}} policy {{contained}} in these preambles, {{and the force}} of these examples in the acts of Parliament, avail anything, what can be said against applying them with regard to America? Are not the people of America as much Englishmen as the Welsh? The preamble of the act of Henry the Eighth says, the Welsh speak a language no way resembling that of his Majesty's English subjects. Are the Americana not as numerous? If we may trust the learned and accurate Judge Barrington's account of North Wales, and {{take that as a}} standard to measure the rest, there is no comparison. The people cannot amount to above 200,000: not a tenth part of the number in the colonies. Is America in rebellion? Wales was hardly ever free from it. Have you attempted to govern America by penal statutes? You made fifteen for Wales. But your legislative authority is perfect with regard to America: was it less perfect in Wales, Chester, and Durham? But America is virtually represented. What! does the electric force of virtual representation more easily pass over the Atlantic than pervade Wales, which lies in <b>your</b> <b>neighborhood?</b> or than Chester and Durham, surrounded by abundance of representation that is actual and palpable? But, Sir, your ancestors thought this sort of virtual representation, however ample, to be totally insufficient for the freedom of the inhabitants of territories that are so near, and comparatively so inconsiderable. How, then, can I think it sufficient for those which are infinitely greater, and infinitely more remote? ...|$|E
