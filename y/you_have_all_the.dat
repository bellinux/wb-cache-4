And usually women feel stupid and silly and they blame themselves 'cause <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> signs most of the time, but you love the guy so you don't {{want to see them}} go. And in this song, it's kind of like a celebration of the breakup...|$|E
500|$|Musician and filmmaker Rob Zombie observes, [...] "Most of {{the kids}} who come to my shows seem like really imaginative kids with a lot of {{creative}} energy they don't know what to do with" [...] and that metal is [...] "outsider music for outsiders. Nobody wants to be the weird kid; you just somehow end up being the weird kid. It's kind of like that, but with metal <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> weird kids in one place". Scholars of metal have noted the tendency of fans to classify and reject some performers (and some other fans) as [...] "poseurs" [...] "who pretended {{to be part of the}} subculture, but who were deemed to lack authenticity and sincerity".|$|E

500|$|Their debut EP, How Am I Supposed to Kill You If <b>You</b> <b>Have</b> <b>All</b> <b>the</b> Guns?, Recorded by Lee Boylan and {{released}} by Irish indie label FIFA Records in early 2007, sold out and generated {{a significant amount}} of interest in the media and in the Irish blogging community in the process. In May 2007, Fight Like Apes won Phantom FM's Topman Unsigned Band Search; their prize was to be a support act of The Holloways at show in Dublin. Fight Like Apes played both Electric Picnic (their first major Irish festival) and Hard Working Class Heroes in 2007 and also performed at the CMJ Music Marathon in New York City. They were also chosen to play the Futureshock stage at EXIT in Serbia after sending a demo of their songs to the organisers. On 13 October 2007, Fight Like Apes performed [...] "Jake Summers" [...] on television chat show, Tubridy Tonight.|$|E
500|$|The rivalry, {{which is}} the oldest in the sport, is fueled by history, competitiveness, and {{cultural}} implication. Both schools {{are located in the}} state of Maryland, a historical hotbed for lacrosse, and have traditionally been two of the sport's powerhouses. Many of the opposing players have had past associations in grade school, high school, or youth club sports. Hopkins' current coach and former player Dave Pietramala said, [...] "Everybody knew each other; we had all played together at some point or another. It was a fierce, intense game and there was no love lost on the field." [...] Additionally, Johns Hopkins is a private university, while Maryland is a public institution. Former Terrapins coach Dick Edell said:"To get the juices flowing before the game, [...] kids that it was the blue-collar guys against the future executives—that this was their only chance to get them before they got into the real world. Plus, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> kids who came from the same high school, or worked the camps together, so there was that closeness that you have to live with for the other 364 days, no matter who wins." ...|$|E
500|$|Owing to the {{combination}} of Pink Floyd's partial breakup and Waters' dominance on the project, The Final Cut is sometimes viewed as a de facto Waters solo album. [...] The personal quality assigned to the lyrics are related to Waters' struggle to reconcile his despair at the changing social face of Britain, and also {{the loss of his}} father during the Second World War. [...] Gilmour's guitar solos on [...] "Your Possible Pasts" [...] and [...] "The Fletcher Memorial Home" [...] are, however, sometimes considered the equal of his best work on The Wall. [...] More recent reviews of the album have weighed its importance alongside the band's breakup. [...] Writing for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine said [...] "with its anger, emphasis on lyrics, and sonic textures, it's clear that it's the album that Waters intended it to be. [...] And it's equally clear that Pink Floyd couldn't have continued in this direction...", [...] Stylus Magazine wrote: [...] "It's about pursuing something greater even when <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> money that you could ever want. [...] And either failing or succeeding brilliantly. [...] It's up to you to decide whether this record is a success or a failure, but I'd go with the former every time." [...] Rachel Mann of The Quietus said [...] "flawed though it is, The Final Cut remains a tremendous album" [...] and [...] "still has something fresh to say". [...] Mike Diver of Drowned in Sound was less generous: [...] "Rays of light are few and far between, and even on paper the track titles – including 'The Gunner's Dream' and 'Paranoid Eyes' – suggest an arduous listen. [...] Q Magazine once compiled a top ten list of depressing records, and this was on it. [...] Enough said, I think." ...|$|E

[...] It features carnival rides and attractions which assist in this purpose, which is the focus of multiple albums and songs within the group's discography.
