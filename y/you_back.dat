5|$|Press Gang {{has proved}} to be a series that can {{transport}} <b>you</b> <b>back</b> to how you felt as a teenager, sharper that the world but with as much angst as acute wit... Never again can a show get away with talking down to children or writing sloppily for them. Press Gang, possibly the best show in the world.|$|E
5|$|Seeing all the singers, {{you really}} {{come face to}} face with a lot of people that are {{predominantly}} younger. That's inspiring, because they come up to you and they're such big fans and they share with you what song touched them the most and how they had to learn every single ad lib and dissect it. As a vocalist it brought me back to, 'Yeah, that's what I used to do to my Whitney Houston record and my Mariah Carey record and my Etta James record.' It brings <b>you</b> <b>back</b> to a place where it becomes your personal responsibility to infuse the next generation with more information about learning every intricate note. That's why a song called 'Sing for Me' is a special song. It's one of those singer's songs where if you're not a vocalist you can't mess with that song.|$|E

25|$|O you, my lovely boy, {{who hold}} in your power Time's {{hour-glass}} and his sickle—you who wane {{as you grow}} older and in that show your friends withering as you yourself grow up: if Nature, sovereign mistress over chaos, as you go onwards will ever pluck <b>you</b> <b>back,</b> she keeps you to demonstrate her power to hold up time. Yet fear her, you who are Nature's darling: she may detain her treasure, but not keep it forever. Her last account, though delayed, must be paid and her discharge is to render you up.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the things}} the movie does best is {{transport}} <b>you</b> <b>back</b> in time and into nature. In the early scenes as Joel leaves his aunt's home to travel across the South by rickety bus and horse and carriage, you feel the strangeness, wonder and anxiety of a child abandoning everything that's familiar to go to a place so remote he has to ask directions along the way. The landscape over which he travels is so rich and fertile that you can almost smell the earth and sky. Later on, when Joel tussles with Idabell (Aubrey Dollar), a tomboyish neighbor who becomes his best friend (a character inspired by the author Harper Lee), the movie has a special force and clarity in its evocation of the physical immediacy of being a child playing outdoors.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{their lack}} of graphics, text adventures include a {{physical}} dimension where players move between rooms. Many text adventure games boasted their total number of rooms to indicate how much gameplay they offered. These games are unique in that they may create an illogical space, where going north from area A takes you to area B, but going south from area B did not take <b>you</b> <b>back</b> to area A. This can create mazes that do not behave as players expect, and thus players must maintain their own map. These illogical spaces are much more rare in today's era of 3D gaming, and the Interactive Fiction community in general decries the use of mazes entirely, claiming that mazes have become arbitrary 'puzzles {{for the sake of}} puzzles' and that they can, in the hands of inexperienced designers, become immensely frustrating for players to navigate.|$|E

500|$|Falcons {{defensive}} end Chuck Smith questioned the Vikings' toughness {{because of the}} ease with which they had won during the season. [...] "It's one thing to beat up on people," [...] said Smith, [...] "but how do you react when someone's finally hitting <b>you</b> <b>back?</b> We've been slugging it out all year." [...] Years later, Smith went on to criticize Gary Anderson in particular for his missed field goal and its contribution to the Vikings' loss.|$|E
500|$|On {{her first}} day on set, Smart was shocked to learn the {{producers}} wanted to cut the scene, a decision she felt was a mistake. She said [...] "They had done this brilliant thing {{and now they were}} going to undo it. They were just being practical. They said, [...] "It would be hours to get <b>you</b> <b>back,</b> your hair, your make-up." [...] Smart spoke to the hair and makeup artists and guaranteed producers they could get it right in two takes; they did it in one, and the scene stayed in.|$|E
500|$|Both Rachel and Janet are Detective Constables in the Major Incident Team of the Manchester Metropolitan Police Service, {{with the}} team headed by DCI Gill Murray (Amelia Bullmore), who is loosely based on Diane Taylor. Producers were {{undecided}} on what age DCI Murray would be, but had originally pictured an actress older than Bullmore. After auditioning, Bullmore returned a month later, intent on playing Murray [...] "tough", however, when meeting casting director Beverley Keogh in the toilets beforehand, Bullmore recounted that Keogh said to her: [...] "That's not what we've got <b>you</b> <b>back</b> for. We were interested in seeing a warmer side".|$|E

500|$|According to {{the most}} popular version of the story, Pipp showed up at Yankee Stadium that day with a severe headache, and asked the team's trainer for two aspirin. Miller Huggins, the Yankees' manager, noticed this, and said [...] "Wally, take the day off. We'll try that kid Gehrig at first today and get <b>you</b> <b>back</b> in there tomorrow." [...] Gehrig played well and became the Yankees' new {{starting}} first baseman. This story first appeared in a 1939 New York World-Telegram on Gehrig's career, in which Pipp was interviewed. Pipp was later quoted to have said, [...] "I took the two most expensive aspirin in history." ...|$|E

There, he told the gathered crowd, [...] "Lord Salisbury and I have brought <b>you</b> <b>back</b> peace—but a peace I hope with honour." [...] The Queen offered him a dukedom, which he declined, though accepting the Garter, as long as Salisbury also received it. In Berlin, word spread of Bismarck's admiring description of Disraeli, [...] "Der alte Jude, das ist der Mann!" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{hidden track}} [...] "Honey" [...] is a percussive, lighthearted love song that {{contains}} a sample of singer Nancy Wilson's 1978 song [...] "I'm in Love". The track opens with a reprise of [...] "Amerykahn Promise", with an announcer saying, [...] "We hope you enjoyed your journey and now we’re putting control of <b>you</b> <b>back</b> to you", and a countdown leading to [...] "Honey". According to Badu, the song is about [...] "a lover, a fictitious character named Slim, who I'm chasing." [...] Allmusic's Andy Kellman commented that the song is included as an unlisted track as [...] "it doesn't fit into the album's fabric, what with its drifting, deeply sweetened, synth-squish-and-string-drift groove." ...|$|E

500|$|Following the game, Burrows accused Auger {{of having}} a {{personal}} vendetta against him for a play against the Predators the previous month that had made him look bad. After Burrows had been hit into the boards by Nashville forward Jerred Smithson during a game on December 8, 2009, Auger assessed Smithson with a five-minute major and a game misconduct. However, the league later rescinded because it was believed Burrows had embellished injury. Burrows claimed that Auger told him before the January 11 game: [...] "you made me look bad [...] so I'm going to get <b>you</b> <b>back</b> tonight." [...] He went on to tell reporters that Auger [...] "should stay out {{for the rest of}} the year making calls like that ... We just blew two points because of his officiating tonight." ...|$|E
500|$|Much of {{the story}} is told by the songs, with the lyrics {{coordinating}} with the events {{of the story}}. For example, [...] "Don't You Want Me" [...] introduces the affair between Greg and Connie, allowing them to flirt in the presence of Fran. It pre-empts the result of their relationship with the line [...] "we will both be sorry"; this is unsung by the characters, but nonetheless emphasise in the episode. The song also speaks to the relationship between Greg and Roger, with Greg singing [...] "don't you want me?" [...] when he fears that he will be fired, and tells of Greg's character with lines including [...] "Don't forget it's me who put you where you are now // And I can put <b>you</b> <b>back</b> there too".|$|E
500|$|The staff {{opted for}} a more {{immersive}} storyline, with increased use of cut scenes and a plot that focused less on the Space Pirates and Metroids that permeate {{the rest of the}} series. Retro decided that the game would follow a theme of light and dark, which originated from [...] "something that everyone understands: the conflict between good and evil". Mike Wikan, the game's senior designer, elaborated on the theme: [...] "We wanted a push and pull, the whole game is pushing and pulling <b>you</b> <b>back</b> and forth between the dark and the light. It ended up being that we wanted something that would feed into that dichotomy, that conflict between the two, and how the player's basic abilities reflect that." [...] The developers asked the producers of , another Nintendo game, for advice because the game also used the theme of parallel worlds.|$|E
