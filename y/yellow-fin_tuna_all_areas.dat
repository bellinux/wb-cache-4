40|$|We {{made some}} {{researches}} on {{the relations between}} the fishing conditions of tuna and general oceanographical conditions, comparing the fishing season of Summer with that of Winter. The results obtained were as the following. 1. Fishing rate per 100 hooks amounted to 6. 4 in Summer and to 7. 4 in Winter. 2. In the case of <b>Yellow-fin</b> <b>tuna</b> the percentage of fish caught in Winter was 52. 5 and in Big-eyed tuna the percentage was 16. 7 0, and that in Summer was 63. 9 and 2. 3 respectively. And from this fact it was elicited that the fluctuation of Big-eyed tuna catch in Summer was irregular. 3. The body length composition of Yellow-fintuna showed the varying range of 100 - 160 cm; the most general standard of size of the fish lay within the range of 130 - 150 cm; and a greater number of large-sized fish was found in Summer than in Winter. 4. The sex ratio of <b>Yellow-fin</b> <b>tuna</b> was about 692 in Winter; 57. 1 in Summer (both in the case of male). The almost all the fish caught in both seasons were found to be near the state of Ripenning. 5. The optimum temperature for catch was found to be 20 °- 23 °C in Winter; 23 °, [...] 25 °C in Summer. 6. Oceanographical and astronomical conditions in Winter and those in Summer showed different appearances; having quite intimate relations with the fishing conditions respectively. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{economy of}} Manihiki is {{dominated}} by the cultivation of black pearls and there are pearl farms dotted around the lagoon. Tourism provides a secondary source of income, although facilities are rudimentary. The reef provides excellent swimming and snorkeling among colourful tropical fish and coral, making scuba diving a major attraction for visitors. Visitors are allowed to snorkel or free-dive but not scuba dive without a permit. Visitors can obtain a permit at the administration office either from the Island Secretary or the Mayor or the Deputy Mayor. There is good fishing in the open waters beyond the reef, including catches of <b>Yellow-fin</b> <b>Tuna</b> and Flying fish. Tours of the pearl farms can be also be arranged.|$|R

50|$|The {{steep sides}} of the plateau cause deep-water {{currents}} to rise up {{when they hit the}} bank; this upwelling brings with it nutrients and minerals from the bottom, feeding the local ecosystem. Over 130 species from numerous classes of the animal kingdom call the bank home at least temporarily. Some such fish are the Atlantic cod, silver hake, yellow-tail flounder, blue-fin and <b>yellow-fin</b> <b>tuna,</b> striped bass, blue fish and numerous species of shark including the great white shark. Shellfish such as the American lobster, sea scallops, squid and ocean quahogs are also prevalent. Many marine birds call the bank home including gannets, shearwaters, storm petrels, fulmars, puffins and razorbills. Reptiles are even present, primarily being represented by the leatherback sea turtle. Possibly the most famous animals on Stellwagen Bank are the mammals. Five species of seals (harp seal, gray seal, harbor seal, hooded seal, and ringed seal), and numerous whale species swim in the waters of Stellwagen. Whale watchers can frequently see humpback whales, minke whales and fin whales. There are occasional sightings {{of one of the most}} critically endangered whale species, North Atlantic right whale. Several other whale species can also be seen here including the sperm whale, beluga, orca, pilot whale, White-beaked dolphin, Atlantic white-sided dolphin, common dolphin, bottlenose dolphin, Risso’s dolphin, harbor porpoise, blue whale, and sei whale.|$|R

After making some researches according to the features derived from the regional and seasonal devisions, the following results were obtained. (1) It was in Winter and at the North side of the sea front that the Fishing Rate per 100 hooks reached its maximum at the figure of 6. 0 %; and the next one was observed, in Summer, at the Southern Sea Front, at the figure of 5. 8 %. (2) At the southern sea fronts, an abundant appearance of Big-eye tuna (38 %) was observed, the fish body being large, 30 % of those fish caught having the trunk-length more than 141 ~ 150 cm and body-weight more than 60 kg. At the northern sea front, in winter, the appearance of Marlin's reached 33. 7 % of the total, main species of which being Sail Fish. (3) The main sources of the Catch are, except the Summer Season at the southern sea front, composed of <b>Yellow-fin</b> <b>tuna.</b> (4) Through both Summer and Winter, good catch percentage was seen at the southern sea front along the water-line about 20 miles off the seaside of Taliabu Island. (5) At the Southern Sea Front, about 25 miles off the seaside and in case of the Northern Sea Front, about 30 miles off, the Drift-Line could not help being overwhelmed by the running waves, and this showed the existence of a Tide current. The detailed Sea condition of these fronts should be reported in the next paper...|$|R
