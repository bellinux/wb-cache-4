Perhaps you are right, God knows. At any rate, it isn't mine, so we had better part. Still, I rather admire your courage. I wonder what this young fellow is like for whose sake you are {{prepared}} to lose so much; more than <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> <b>maybe,</b> for I had grown fond of you. Well, good-bye, I'll see about your getting off. There, don't think that I bear malice although I am so angry with you. Write to me {{when you get into}} a tight place," [...] and rising, she kissed her, rather roughly but not without affection, and flung out of the room like one who feared to trust herself there any longer.|$|E
5000|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} during a popular resurgence for punk rock, with older punk bands reuniting and newer ones receiving international exposure, and All Set {{has been seen}} as exemplifying the period. In his review of All Set, Roger Catlin of the Hartford Courant proclaimed [...] "what an unusual summer we're having. The Sex Pistols, the Misfits and the Dictators are on reunion tours, and there are new albums from Patti Smith, the Specials and the Buzzcocks. What year is this exactly?" [...] After Ear Candy Mag pointed out that popular acts such as Oasis, Green Day and Rancid mixed punk rock and pop as was the Buzzcocks style, Diggle said that he thought the revival was [...] "exciting, it brings guitar back. In Britain there's a lot more guitar bands happening." [...] When asked whether he felt that [...] "these new groups are stealing the Buzzcocks' thunder for doing what the Buzzcocks were doing 20 years ago," [...] Diggle replied [...] "Well, there's a hint of that, but <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>maybe</b> it will develop. Everybody takes a starting point at some time." [...] On 23 June 1996, Buzzcocks even opened the Sex Pistols' reunion tour, Filthy Lucre Tour, at Finsbury Park.|$|E

5000|$|He added, [...] "I think I {{have pretty}} much nailed where I was at to the mast. But people come to gigs for {{different}} reasons: it isn't necessarily about what the person on stage is singing. But at the same time, <b>you</b> do <b>think,</b> 'Well, <b>maybe</b> this'll change their minds.'" ...|$|R
2500|$|However, Faugheen's career took a major turn as {{just before}} the start of the Punchestown festival in late April 2014, his stablemate Vautour [...] "failed a late fitness test" [...] {{according}} to Mullins, that made them switch targets during that week with Faugheen running instead in the early Tuesday's race Herald Champion Novice Hurdle which was over the 2 miles trip. In the race he was against a couple of Vautour's former rivals of which Faugheen [...] "made light work" [...] and made Mullins to reconsider his future prospect: [...] "You'd have to consider staying hurdling with him next season. Looking at him beforehand, I thought he was a chaser, but there's no harm in having another good hurdler and that would certainly make <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>maybe</b> he should stay at this game".|$|R

'Why, all I want to {{know from}} you, my friend, is, whether you are seeking to do this Mr. Alan Fairford good or harm; because {{if you come to}} do him good, I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> could <b>maybe</b> get speech of him--and if to do him harm, I will take the liberty to give you a cast across the Firth, with fair warning not to come back on such an errand, lest worse come of it.' ...|$|R
5000|$|I decided {{right there}} {{that out of}} sheer {{frustration}} {{and not being able}} to afford a psychologist, I was going to write this, think about it. People watching the news sometimes get so disgusted by what they see. Susan Smith drowning her kids... guys going into McDonald's, lighting up the whole place. You hear things that disgust you so much that even if you're Mother Teresa, there comes a breaking point. One day you're gonna watch the news and you're gonna say, 'Whoever did that despicable thing should pay with their life.' <b>You</b> <b>think</b> — for <b>maybe</b> just a minute — that whoever did that should die, without any fuckin' jury. I was going to give everybody that sick fantasy. And tell it as truthfully as I could.|$|R
5000|$|Two soundtrack albums were released. The first, Woodstock: Music {{from the}} Original Soundtrack and More, was a 3-LP (later 2-CD) album {{containing}} {{a sampling of}} one or two songs by most of the acts who performed. A year later, Woodstock 2 was released as a 2-LP album. Both albums included recordings of stage announcements (many by Production Coordinator John Morris, e.g., [...] "told that the brown acid is not specifically too good", [...] "Hey, if <b>you</b> <b>think</b> really hard, <b>maybe</b> we can stop this rain") and crowd noises (i.e., the rain chant) between songs. In 1994, a third album, Woodstock Diary was released. Tracks from all three albums, as well as numerous additional, previously unreleased performances from the festival but not the stage announcements and crowd noises, were reissued by Atlantic as a 4-CD box set titled Woodstock: Three Days of Peace and Music.|$|R
5000|$|Ferlinghetti takes a {{distinctly}} populist approach to poetry, emphasizing throughout his work [...] "that art should {{be accessible to}} all people, not {{just a handful of}} highly educated intellectuals." [...] This perception of art as a broad sociocultural force, as opposed to an elitist academic enterprise, is explicitly evident in Poem 9 from Pictures of the Gone World, wherein the speaker states: “‘Truth is not the secret of a few’ / yet / <b>you</b> would <b>maybe</b> <b>think</b> so / the way some / librarians / and cultural ambassadors and / especially museum directors / act” (1-8). In addition to Ferlinghetti’s aesthetic egalitarianism, this passage highlights two additional formal features of the poet’s work, namely, his incorporation of a common American idiom as well as his experimental approach to line arrangement which, as Crale Hopkins notes, is inherited from the poetry of William Carlos Williams.|$|R

5000|$|On March 2, 2012, Limbaugh {{defended his}} {{previous}} comments about Fluke, saying, [...] "not one person says that, 'Well, did <b>you</b> ever <b>think</b> about <b>maybe</b> backing off {{the amount of}} sex that you have?'" [...] Limbaugh said that requiring insurance companies to cover contraception is [...] "no different than if somebody knocked on my door that I don't know and said, 'You know what? I'm out of money. I can't afford birth-control pills, and I'm supposed {{to have sex with}} three guys tonight.'" [...] Limbaugh commented on Fluke receiving a call from President Obama, who stated that her parents should be proud of her, saying, [...] "I'm gonna button my lip on that one." [...] He {{went on to say that}} if his daughter had testified that [...] "she's having so much sex she can't pay for it and wants a new welfare program to pay for it," [...] he would be [...] "embarrassed" [...] and [...] "disconnect the phone", [...] "go into hiding", and [...] "hope the media didn't find me". He continued later, [...] "Oh! Does she have more boyfriends? They're lined up around the block. They would have been in my day." [...] He continued that Fluke testified that her [...] "sex life is active. She's having sex so frequently that she can't afford all the birth-control pills that she needs. That's what she's saying." ...|$|R

50|$|As a witch, Tiffany {{possesses}} First Sight, {{the ability}} to see 'what is really there' (as opposed to second sight, which shows people what they think ought to be there). She also possesses Second Thoughts, which are defined as 'the thoughts <b>you</b> <b>think</b> about the way you think'. Whilst other witches are said to have this trait as well, Tiffany also recognizes some of her thoughts as Third Thoughts (the thoughts <b>you</b> <b>think</b> about the way <b>you</b> <b>think</b> about the way <b>you</b> <b>think),</b> and Fourth Thoughts (the thoughts <b>you</b> <b>think</b> about the way <b>you</b> <b>think</b> about the way <b>you</b> <b>think</b> about the way <b>you</b> <b>think).</b> All these thoughts sometimes cause Tiffany to walk into door frames.|$|R
