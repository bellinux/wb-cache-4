500|$|The duet aria, [...] "" [...] (Take me from {{myself and}} give me to <b>You!),</b> <b>again</b> <b>for</b> soprano and alto, is in triple time. The tune of Johann Heermann's hymn [...] "Meinen Jesum lass ich nicht" [...] (I will not {{let go of my}} Jesus) is {{interwoven}} in the texture as a cantus firmus of the upper strings in unison. The movement is a [...] "love duet" [...] characterized by [...] "antiphonal avowals of commitment" [...] to God rather than a carnal desire. The musicologist Julian Mincham compares its presentation to Monteverdi's L'incoronazione di Poppea. The movement begins with sparse scoring and becomes more richly textured as it progresses, adding the chorale tune.|$|E
2500|$|Clarkson's {{views are}} often showcased on {{television}} shows. In 1997, Clarkson {{appeared on the}} light-hearted comedy show Room 101, in which a guest nominates things they hate in life to be consigned to nothingness. Clarkson dispatched caravans, houseflies, the sitcom Last of the Summer Wine, the mentality within golf clubs, and vegetarians. He has made several appearances on the prime time talk shows Parkinson and Friday Night with Jonathan Ross since 2002. By 2003, his persona was deemed to fit the mould for the series Grumpy Old Men, in which middle-aged men talk about any aspects of modern life which irritate them. Since the topical news panel show Have I Got News for You dismissed regular host Angus Deayton in October 2002, Clarkson {{has become one of}} the most regularly used guest hosts on the show. Clarkson has appeared as a panellist on the political current affairs television show [...] Question Time twice since 2000. On 2 October 2015 he presented Have I Got News for <b>You</b> <b>again</b> <b>for</b> the first time since his dismissal.|$|E

6000|$|Hearing this, {{the blessed}} Simeon fell at his feet, saying, [...] "Thou art {{my father and}} my mother, and my teacher of good works, and guide to the kingdom of heaven. For thou hast gained my soul, which was already being sunk in perdition. May the Lord repay <b>thee</b> <b>again</b> <b>for</b> it. For these are the things which edify. I will now go into a monastery, where God shall choose; and let his will be done on me." [...] The elder said, [...] "My son, before thou enterest, hear me. Thou shalt have tribulation; for thou must watch and serve in nakedness, and sustain ills without ceasing; and again thou shalt be comforted, thou vessel {{precious}} to God." ...|$|R

6000|$|...
