40|$|Abstract. Flying wing {{configuration}} is {{a promising}} candidate for {{various kinds of}} unmanned aerial vehicles. However, this kind of configuration eliminates conventional vertical tail and rudder, thus existing severe problems on <b>yawing</b> <b>control.</b> To make the flying wing configuration into practical use, it is especially necessary to gain a deep understanding on the <b>control</b> characteristics of <b>yawing</b> <b>control</b> devices. To the innovative <b>yawing</b> <b>control</b> device: split-drag-rudder, which is most widely used on flying wing configuration, the paper introduced its current research and mechanical feature, then carefully analyzed its <b>yawing</b> <b>control</b> characteristics, three-axis control coupling effect, also influencing regularities on aerodynamics and stabilities. The conclusions can help to provide basis on engineering application for split-drag-rudder, and to some extent, help to solve the <b>yawing</b> <b>control</b> problem for the flying wing configuration. ...|$|R
50|$|An unusual {{feature of}} the Harrier family of {{aircraft}} is their use of two types of flight control to provide pitch, roll and <b>yaw</b> control: conventional <b>control</b> surfaces for wingborne flight, and a system of reaction <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> directing jets of bleed air from the high-pressure compressor of the engine out through the extremities of the nose, tail, and at the wingtips during vectored thrust-borne flight and hover modes. The two systems are fully interlinked but air is not supplied to the reaction <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> during conventional wingborne flight.|$|R

40|$|In wind farms, wakes {{originating}} from upstream turbines cause reduced energy extraction and increased loading variability in downstream rows. The prospect of mitigating these detrimental effects through coordinated controllers at the wind-farm level has fueled {{a multitude of}} research efforts in wind-farm control. The main strategies in wind-farm control are to influence the velocity deficits in the wake by deviating from locally optimal axial induction setpoints on the one hand, and steering wakes away from downstream rows through yaw misalignment on the other hand. The current work investigates dynamic induction and <b>yaw</b> <b>control</b> of individual turbines for wind-farm power maximization in large-eddy simulations. To this end, receding-horizon optimal control techniques combined with continuous adjoint gradient evaluations are used. We study a 4 × 4 aligned wind farm, and find that for this farm layout <b>yaw</b> <b>control</b> {{is more effective than}} induction control, both for uniform and turbulent inflow conditions. Analysis of optimal <b>yaw</b> <b>controls</b> leads to the definition of two simplified <b>yaw</b> <b>control</b> strategies, in which wake meandering and wake redirection are exploited respectively. Furthermore it is found that dynamic yawing provides significant benefits over static <b>yaw</b> <b>control</b> in turbulent flow environments, whereas {{this is not the case}} for uniform inflow. Finally, the potential of combining overinductive axial induction <b>control</b> with <b>yaw</b> <b>control</b> is shown, with power gains that approximate the sum of those achieved by each control strategy separately...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Individual {{pitch control}} (IPC) for {{reducing}} blade loads {{has been investigated}} and proven successful in recent literature. For IPC, the multi-blade co-ordinate (MBC) transformation is used to process the blade load signals from the rotating to a stationary frame of reference. In the stationary frame of reference, the yaw error of a turbine can be appended to generate IPC actions {{that are able to}} achieve turbine <b>yaw</b> <b>control</b> for a turbine in free yaw. In this paper, IPC for <b>yaw</b> <b>control</b> is tested on a high-fidelity numerical model of a commercially produced wind turbine in free yaw. The tests show that <b>yaw</b> <b>control</b> using IPC has the distinct advantage that the yaw system loads and support structure loading are substantially reduced. However, IPC for <b>yaw</b> <b>control</b> also shows a reduction in IPC blade load reduction potential and causes a slight increase in pitch activity. Thus, the key contribution of this paper is the concept demonstration of IPC for <b>yaw</b> <b>control.</b> Further, using IPC for yaw as a tuning parameter, it is shown how the best trade-off between blade loading, pitch activity and support structure loading can be achieved for wind turbine design. 1...|$|R

40|$|Wind tunnel {{investigations}} {{have been conducted}} of forebody strakes for <b>yaw</b> <b>control</b> on 0. 06 -scale models of the F/A- 18 aircraft at free-stream Mach numbers of 0. 20 to 0. 90. The testing was conducted in the 7 - by 10 -Foot Transonic Tunnel at the David Taylor Research Center and the Langley 7 - by 10 -Foot High-Speed Tunnel. The principal objectives of the testing were {{to determine the effects}} of the Mach number and the strake plan form on the strake <b>yaw</b> <b>control</b> effectiveness and the corresponding strake vortex induced flow field. The wind tunnel model configurations simulated an actuated conformal strake deployed for maximum <b>yaw</b> <b>control</b> at high angles of attack. The test data included six-component forces and moments on the complete model, surface static pressure distributions on the forebody and wing leading-edge extensions, and on-surface and off-surface flow visualizations. The results from these studies show that the strake produces large <b>yaw</b> <b>control</b> increments at high angles of attack that exceed the effect of conventional rudders at low angles of attack. The strake <b>yaw</b> <b>control</b> increments diminish with increasing Mach number but continue to exceed the effect of rudder deflection at angles of attack greater than 30 degrees. The character of the strake vortex induced flow field is similar at subsonic and transonic speeds. Cropping the strake planform to account for geometric and structural constraints on the F- 18 aircraft has a small effect on the <b>yaw</b> <b>control</b> increments at subsonic speeds and no effect at transonic speeds...|$|R

40|$|Forebody strakes {{were tested}} in a {{low-speed}} wind tunnel to determine their effectiveness producing <b>yaw</b> <b>control</b> on a generic fighter model with a symmetric 60 deg half-angle chine forebody. Previous studies conducted using smooth, conventionally shaped forebodies show that forebody strakes provide increased levels of <b>yaw</b> <b>control</b> at angles of attack where conventional rudders are ineffective. The chine forebody shape was chosen for this study because chine forebodies can be designed with lower radar cross section (RCS) values than smooth forebody shapes. Because the chine edges of the forebody would fix the point of flow separation, it was unknown if any effectiveness achieved could be modulated as was successfully done on the smooth forebody shapes. The results show that use of forebody strakes on a chine forebody produce high levels of <b>yaw</b> <b>control,</b> and when combined with the rudder effectiveness, significant <b>yaw</b> <b>control</b> is available for a large range of angles of attack. The strake effectiveness was very dependent on radial location. Very small strakes placed {{at the tip of}} the forebody were nearly as effective as very long strakes.
