5|$|Julianna Helt {{from the}} Pittsburgh Post-Gazette found that time travel forms a central theme as Miranda {{constantly}} wonders how time travel could be possible. In When <b>You</b> <b>Reach</b> Me, Marcus helps Miranda {{realize that the}} three old ladies from A Wrinkle in Time lied to Meg by promising they would return five minutes before they left. Marcus explains:"So the garden is where they appear when they get {{home at the end}} of the book. Remember? They land in the broccoli. So if they had gotten home five minutes before they left, like those ladies promised they would, then they would have seen themselves get back. Before they did".|$|E
5|$|The {{two main}} {{characters}} are Miranda, and the laughing man (Marcus). Stead began writing When <b>You</b> <b>Reach</b> Me in 2007 after reading {{an article in}} The New York Times gave her {{an idea for a}} novel about traveling in time to save someone's life. The article was about a man who woke up in Denver suffering from amnesia, having forgotten who he was or why he was there. Many people worked with the man to help him regain his memory. Under hypnosis, he spoke about his apparent wife, Penny, and two daughters who died in a car crash. However, when he and Penny reunited, the man found out she was only his fiancée— and they had no children. Upon reading this, Stead wondered if somehow the man had returned to the past to prevent an accident but lost his memory along the way. In addition, the article reminded Stead of a strange old man, called the 'laughing man', who lived near her house as a child.|$|E
5|$|When <b>You</b> <b>Reach</b> Me is a Newbery Medal-winning {{science fiction}} and mystery novel by Rebecca Stead, {{published}} in 2009. It {{takes place in}} the Upper West Side in New York during 1978 and 1979 and follows the protagonist, Miranda Sinclair. She receives a strange note asking her to record future events and write down the location of her spare key. As the novel progresses, Miranda receives three more notes with requests. The novel contains three story lines— the appearance of Miranda's mom on the game show, The $20,000 Pyramid, Miranda's best friend Sal suddenly not talking with Miranda, and the appearance of a laughing man. Central themes in the novel include independence, redemption and friendship. Stead also wanted to demonstrate the possibilities that she saw in time travel. The author hoped to show her children what New York was like in her childhood, and demonstrate how in an earlier time children were more independent.|$|E

5|$|E.V.O.: Search for Eden is a side-scrolling {{platformer}} action {{game where}} players must navigate {{a creature of}} their own design across a number of environments resembling Earth's past. The game is divided into five distinct geological periods: the Cambrian Period and the Ordovician Period of the Paleozoic Era ("The World Before Land") from 500 million years ago to 450 million years ago, then the Carboniferous period ("Early Creatures of Land"), the Mesozoic Era ("Age of Dinosaurs"), the late Neogene period ("Ice Age"), and finally the early Quaternary period ("Early Man"). Each period has its own map screen, which is divided into various levels. While each era takes historical liberties with both its inhabitants and time frames, the player's choices for evolution are dependent on the current era of play, ranging from aquatic bodies during the Age of Fish to mammalian physiology during the Age of Man. During the first two eras you are forced to gain a new body to progress, but once <b>you</b> <b>reach</b> the Age of Dinosaurs, a side quest {{will give you the}} option to remain as a reptile, or become a bird, gaining the ability of flight. As you enter the Ice Age as a bird or reptile, you are immediately given the option to become a mammal. You can finish the game as a reptile, bird, or mammal and the outcome is still the same, only the interaction dialogue is affected by your choices.|$|E

25|$|Today, modern {{bookbinding}} {{is divided}} between hand binding by individual craftsmen {{working in a}} one-room studio shop and commercial bindings mass-produced by high speed machines in a production line factory. There is a broad grey area between the two divisions. The size and complexity of a bindery shop varies with job types, for example, from {{one of a kind}} custom jobs, to repair/restoration work, to library rebinding, to preservation binding, to small edition binding, to extra binding, and finally to large run publisher's binding. There are cases where the printing and binding jobs are combined in one shop. A step up to the next level of mechanization is determined by economics of scale until <b>you</b> <b>reach</b> production runs of ten thousand copies or more in a factory employing a dozen or more workers.|$|E

And I was dancin' on the rocks there... right on the rocks where the waves were, like, blowin' and splashin'. Really, it was so fantastic. And the moon was bright, ya know, and I started dancin' and singin' and I sang that song and it stayed. It's just the kind of moment that you want to find when you're writin' songs.|$|E

25|$|Nevada and Arizona {{are both}} {{generally}} arid with desert lands and mountains, and receive {{large amounts of}} snow in the higher elevations in and near the mountains. New Mexico, Utah, and Colorado are generally arid, with desert lands and mountains as well. They all receive decent amounts of snow and large amounts of snow in the high elevations in the mountains, although some areas in far southwestern and southern New Mexico do not receive much snow at all. West Texas is generally arid as well but does not receive {{the same amount of}} snow that the other southwestern states receive at their high elevations. The terrain of western Texas in the Southwest is the flat, rolling land of the plains, which eventually turns into a desert with some hills, and there are significant mountains as well once <b>you</b> <b>reach</b> the Trans-Pecos area.|$|E
25|$|To access this region, two provincial roads: Provincial Route No. 28 (gravel), {{linking the}} towns of Tanti with Taninga (near the town of Salsacate). After {{traveling}} nearly 40km from Tanti, and climb over 1,700 meters <b>you</b> <b>reach</b> the far north of the region, more precisely {{at the foot of}} the massif 'Los Gigantes'. From there you can follow the same route to the town of Taninga. The second option is the provincial route RP 34 (tarmac), located about 30km south of the former. It crosses the city of Villa Carlos Paz, crossing {{the towns of}} San Antonio de Arredondo, Villa Icho Cruz, Mayu Sumaj, Cuesta Blanca, and deposited us in the Pampa de Achala. This road is also known as Camino de las Altas Cumbres or route Jorge Raúl Recalde, in tribute to this rally racer. Continuing along the same route, it accesses the Traslasierra Valley. While these are the two most relevant options, there are regional roads and tourist access to reach specific sectors within the region. As mentioned above, except for these two alternatives, the other, in most cases are suitable only for special vehicles, and yet they can not access certain areas.|$|E
25|$|A {{good example}} that {{highlights}} {{the pros and}} cons of using dynamic arrays vs. linked lists is by implementing a program that resolves the Josephus problem. The Josephus problem is an election method that works by having a group of people stand in a circle. Starting at a predetermined person, you count around the circle n times. Once <b>you</b> <b>reach</b> the nth person, take them out of the circle and have the members close the circle. Then count around the circle the same n times and repeat the process, until only one person is left. That person wins the election. This shows the strengths and weaknesses of a linked list vs. a dynamic array, because if you view the people as connected nodes in a circular linked list then it shows how easily the linked list is able to delete nodes (as it only has to rearrange the links to the different nodes). However, the linked list will be poor at finding the next person to remove and will need to search through the list until it finds that person. A dynamic array, on the other hand, will be poor at deleting nodes (or elements) as it cannot remove one node without individually shifting all the elements up the list by one. However, it is exceptionally easy to find the nth person in the circle by directly referencing them by their position in the array.|$|E

500|$|When <b>You</b> <b>Reach</b> Me was {{inspired}} by a newspaper article about a man suffering from amnesia, and by parts of her childhood and her favorite book, A Wrinkle in Time. After completing much of the novel, Stead gave the draft to her editor, Wendy Lamb, who liked it. They expanded on the initial concepts and published When <b>You</b> <b>Reach</b> Me on July 14, 2009, under Wendy Lamb Books, an imprint of Random House. The book was well received by critics, who praised its realistic setting and the author's deft handling of small details. The novel has reached the best-seller lists of The New York Times, Los Angeles Times and USA Today. In addition to receiving the 2010 Newbery Medal, When <b>You</b> <b>Reach</b> Me [...] won several Best Book of the Year awards.|$|E
500|$|When <b>You</b> <b>Reach</b> Me is {{classified}} in the science fiction and mystery genres, but includes features of some other genres. Monica Edinger of The New York Times found When <b>You</b> <b>Reach</b> Me to be [...] "a hybrid of genres, it is a complex mystery, a work of historical fiction, a school story and one of friendship, with a leitmotif of time travel running through it." [...] Augusta Scattergood of the Christian Science Monitor wondered, [...] "Is When <b>You</b> <b>Reach</b> Me science fiction? Time travel? A highly imaginative girl's completely conceived experience? Maybe it's historical fiction. After all, it is set in 1979." [...] According to Mary Quattlebaum of The Washington Post, the novel is of the science fiction and time travel genres. Quattlebaum found that, unlike the usual time travel stories, When <b>You</b> <b>Reach</b> Me does not involve [...] "cheesy time travel machines and rock-'em-sock-'em action [...] far surpasses the usual whodunit or sci-fi adventure to become an incandescent exploration of 'life, death, {{and the beauty of}} it all.'" [...] Both Kirkus Reviews and Publishers Weekly found that despite the book's science-fiction devices, the setting was still [...] "firmly rooted in reality." ...|$|E
500|$|When <b>You</b> <b>Reach</b> Me {{takes place}} during the 1978-1979 school year of Miranda, the main character. Stead placed Miranda's home in the Upper West Side, New York City, where Stead grew up. Many parts of the novel explore [...] "the same streets where Stead grew up, and riffs on some of her experiences". Stead was {{inspired}} to use this setting because she moved into an apartment near her childhood home early {{in the development of}} the story. There she had experienced her first independence while exploring the streets, only to find a scary man near her house. Wondering why he was there, Stead later used this encounter as [...] "the anchor as she wrote When <b>You</b> <b>Reach</b> Me".|$|E
