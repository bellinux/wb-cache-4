5|$|From the {{renovation}} in 1980 until 1985 the non-profit 5th Avenue Theatre successfully operated as {{a venue for}} touring Broadway shows. As the United States went through an economic downturn from 1985 to 1989 there was a shortage of touring shows for venues like the 5th. Consequently, many of the country's Broadway houses went unused for extended periods of time. However, the 5th remained open during these <b>years</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> reduced staff and was used for community events and local promoters.|$|E

5|$|M. nigrocincta is a gamergate species, {{which allows}} female workers to be fertile, {{and these are}} then able to {{reproduce}} in both queenless and queenright (colonies with a queen) colonies. This means a colony which loses its queen can still thrive {{in the absence of}} the queen. In laboratory colonies of M. nigrocincta where there was no queen present, worker-laid eggs were reared to mature males, showing that workers are highly fertile. The average life expectancy of an adult worker M. nigrocincta ant is 1.1 to 1.2 <b>years,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> maximum expectancy of 1.3 years (400 or more days). Larvae collected from M. nigrocincta are 4.7mm in length but increase to 9.7mm when matured.|$|E

5|$|The Sylvester Medal is {{a bronze}} medal awarded by the Royal Society (London) for the {{encouragement}} of mathematical research, and accompanied by a £1,000 prize. It was named in honour of James Joseph Sylvester, the Savilian Professor of Geometry at the University of Oxford in the 1880s, and first awarded in 1901, having been suggested {{by a group of}} Sylvester's friends (primarily Raphael Meldola) after his death in 1897. Initially awarded every three <b>years</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> prize of around £900, the Royal Society have announced that starting in 2009 it will be awarded every two years instead, and is to be aimed at 'early to mid career stage scientist' rather than an established mathematician. The award winner is chosen by the Society's A-side awards committee, which handles physical rather than biological science awards.|$|E

Drummond also signed a multi-year contract. Kaman signed a one-year $8 million contract with the Dallas Mavericks. Wallace re-signed with the Nets for 4 years and $40 million. The Memphis Grizzlies did not make Mayo a $7.2 million qualifying offer, thus allowing him to become an unrestricted free agent. He subsequently signed with the Mavericks for two <b>years</b> (<b>with</b> <b>a</b> player option in the second year). The New Orleans Hornets matched the Phoenix Suns' 4-year $58 million contract for Gordon.|$|E
5|$|While {{tropical}} cyclones {{may well}} seriously damage settlement, total destruction encourages rebuilding. For example, the destruction wrought by Hurricane Camille on the Gulf coast spurred redevelopment, greatly increasing local property values. Research {{indicates that the}} typical hurricane strike raises real house prices {{for a number of}} <b>years,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> maximum effect of between 3 percent to 4 percent three years after occurrence. However, disaster response officials point out that redevelopment encourages more people to live in clearly dangerous areas subject to future deadly storms. Hurricane Katrina is the most obvious example, as it devastated the region that had been revitalized after Hurricane Camille. Many former residents and businesses do relocate to inland areas away from the threat of future hurricanes as well.|$|E

5|$|After Bryant retired, Ray Perkins {{extended}} Alabama's consecutive {{bowl game}} streak to 25 <b>years</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{victory in the}} 1983 Sun Bowl. However, the streak ended when the 1984 team finished {{the season with a}} record of five wins and six losses and failed to qualify for a bowl {{for the first time in}} 26 years. The bowl absence lasted only one season as Perkins led the Crimson Tide to wins in both the Aloha and Sun Bowls before he resigned as head coach following the 1986 season. Bill Curry continued the bowl tradition and led the Crimson Tide to Hall of Fame, Sun and Sugar Bowl appearances in his three seasons as head coach. After Curry, Gene Stallings took Alabama to the Fiesta, Blockbuster, Gator, Citrus and Outback Bowls. Stallings also led the Crimson Tide to victory in the first Bowl Coalition national championship game with a 34–13 victory over Miami in the Sugar Bowl. In August 1995, as part of the penalty imposed by the NCAA for rules violations, Alabama was ruled ineligible to participate in the 1995 bowl season.|$|E
5|$|After the 1998 season, Wells {{was traded}} to the Toronto Blue Jays for Roger Clemens, who had just {{completed}} two consecutive Cy Young Award-winning seasons. In a regular season that included another perfect game by a Yankees pitcher, this one by David Cone, New York led the AL East with 98 wins and beat the Rangers in the ALDS. This led to an ALCS against the rival Red Sox. New York won the first two games en route to a 4–1 series win, and went on to sweep the Braves in the 1999 World Series. The postseason results gave the 1998–99 Yankees a 22–3 playoff record, and the team held a 12-game winning streak in World Series competition dating back to 1996. Although the 2000 Yankees had an 87–74 regular season record that was the worst among playoff qualifiers, the team won consecutive playoff series to claim the AL championship. New York's pennant placed them in the 2000 World Series against the cross-town Mets, the first Subway Series in 44 <b>years.</b> <b>With</b> <b>a</b> four games to one victory, the Yankees gained their third successive title. As of 2016, the 2000 Yankees are the most recent MLB team to repeat as World Series champions and the Yankees of 1998–2000 are the last team to win three consecutive World Series.|$|E
5|$|An earlier cathedral was located, between 1075 and 1228, on {{the hill}} top near the ancient fort at Old Sarum. In the early 13th century {{it was decided to}} move the {{location}} of the cathedral to the plain. The new building was designed in the Lancet Gothic style (otherwise known as Early English Gothic) by Elias of Dereham and Nicholas of Ely and begun in 1220, starting at the eastern end, and rising westward until by 1258 it was complete, except for the façade and central tower. The façade, huge cloister and polygonal chapter house were then constructed by Richard Mason and were completed by about 1280, the later work employing Geometric Decorated tracery in the openings of windows and arcades. It was about fifty years before the major undertaking of the tower and spire was commenced, the architect being Richard Farleigh and the details being rather more intricate and elaborate than the earlier work. The entire cathedral was complete by 1380, and the only subsequent inclusion of note has been the reinforcement of the arches of the tower when one of the piers developed a bend. This three-part building program spanning 160 <b>years</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> fifty-year gap in the middle is the shortest and least diverse and makes Salisbury by far the most homogenous of all the cathedrals.|$|E
