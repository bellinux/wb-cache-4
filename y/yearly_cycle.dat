25|$|The Sefer Torah is read {{during the}} Torah reading {{which is part}} of the Shabbat morning services, with a longer reading than during the week. The Torah is read over a <b>yearly</b> <b>cycle</b> of 54 parashioth, one for each Shabbat (sometimes they are doubled). On Shabbat, the reading is divided into seven sections, more than on any other holy day, {{including}} Yom Kippur. Then, the Haftarah reading from the Hebrew prophets is read.|$|E

On certain {{days of the}} year, such as Easter, May Day, and Christmas, particular songs celebrate the <b>yearly</b> <b>cycle.</b> Weddings, birthdays, and funerals may also be noted with songs, dances and special costumes. Religious festivals often have a folk music component. Choral music at these events brings children and non-professional singers {{to participate in a}} public arena, giving an emotional bonding that is unrelated to the aesthetic qualities of the music.|$|E

2500|$|The {{solar year}} is about eleven days longer than twelve lunar months. The Bible does not {{directly}} mention the addition of [...] "embolismic" [...] or intercalary months. However, without the insertion of embolismic months, Jewish festivals would gradually shift outside of the seasons required by the Torah. This has been ruled as implying a requirement for the insertion of embolismic months to reconcile the lunar cycles to the seasons, which are integral to solar <b>yearly</b> <b>cycles.</b>|$|R

25|$|Bihu is {{a series}} of three {{prominent}} festivals. Primarily a non-religious festival celebrated to mark the seasons and the significant points of a cultivator's life over a <b>yearly</b> <b>cycle.</b> Three Bihus, rongali or bohag, celebrated with the coming of spring {{and the beginning of the}} sowing season; kongali or kati, the barren bihu when the fields are lush but the barns are empty; and the bhogali or magh, the thanksgiving when the crops have been harvested and the barns are full. Bihu songs and Bihu dance are associated to rongali bihu. The day before the each bihu is known as 'uruka'. The first day of 'rongali bihu' is called 'Goru bihu' (the bihu of the cows), when the cows are taken to the nearby rivers or ponds to be bathed with special care. In recent times the form and nature of celebration has changed with the growth of urban centres.|$|E

However, boundary changes in 2004 resulted in Didsbury being split mainly between the two new wards of Didsbury East and Didsbury West while a small section of West Didsbury was incorporated into the new ward of Chorlton Park. [...] Didsbury East is represented by Labour councillors James Wilson, Andrew Simcock and Kelly Simcock.

2500|$|The {{original}} {{inhabitants of}} the territory that is now Maine were Algonquian-speaking Wabanaki peoples, including the Passamaquoddy, Maliseet, Penobscot, Kennebec and Androscoggin. During the later King Phillip's War, many of these peoples would merge {{in one form or}} another to become the Wabanaki Confederacy, aiding the Wampanoag of Massachusetts & the Mahican of New York. Afterwards, many of these people were driven from their natural territories, but most of the tribes of Maine continued, unchanged, until the American Revolution. Before this point, however, most of these people were considered separate nations. Many had adapted to living in permanent, Iroquois inspired settlements, while those along the coast tended to be semi-nomadic-- traveling from settlement to settlement on a <b>yearly</b> <b>cycle.</b> They would usually winter inland & head to the coasts by summer.|$|E
2500|$|Cattle ranches in the Tongue River Basin are {{predominantly}} [...] "cow calf" [...] instead of [...] "yearling" [...] operations. The <b>yearly</b> <b>cycle</b> of a [...] "cow calf" [...] operation {{begins with the}} birth of calves from February to May. At spring roundup the calves are branded. Bulls are put with the cows to start the nine-month gestation cycle to produce next year’s calf crop on the month chosen by the rancher, after which the bulls are again separated from the herds. The herds are moved to summer pasture, and in June and July attention focuses on cutting and storing hay for the next winter. Feed crops are harvested in late summer or fall. The late fall roundup separates the calves which are sold to cattle buyers and shipped by truck. The herd is moved to the pasture where they will be fed for the winter, and in about the first week of December enough snow accumulates to start the process of feeding hay to carry the herd through the winter. Ranch chores, repairs and maintenance, work on building projects, doctoring cattle and the like go on all year round.|$|E

The subjects were broad and the inspiration spontaneous, but the speakers still followed Maiorescu's elaborate ceremonial, which reduced {{direct contact with the}} listeners. In 1864, Pogor discussed the French Revolution, and specifically its [...] "impact on modern ideas". There was a break in the following year, with Maiorescu having been involved in a sex scandal, but the lecturers returned in 1866, when the common theme was [...] "factors of national life throughout history". Pogor was also contributing to the Junimea who's who of Romanian poetry, selecting for reading pieces by the 18th-century boyar Ienăchiță Văcărescu. At the prelecțiuni, Pogor spoke about Ancient Greek art; in 1867, about Shakespearean tragedy; during later cycles, he discovered and introduced for the general public the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer. Still focused on national identity constructs and the philosophy of history, he promoted at Junimea the evolutionist treatise History of Civilization in England, by Henry Thomas Buckle.|$|E
