As Mexican American author, Denise Chavez, in her book [...] "Loving Pedro Infante" [...] put it humorously, [...] "If you're a Mexican, and don't know who he is, you should be tied to a hot stove with a yucca rope and beaten with sharp dry corn husks as you stand in a vat of soggy fideos. If your racial and cultural background ethnicity is Other, then it's about time <b>you</b> <b>learned</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> most famous of Mexican singers and actors." ...|$|E
5000|$|According to {{producer}} Jorge Madrid y Campos, who {{was also}} his legal representative, Pedro Infante's fame has increased greatly since his death. The presence of so many admirers at his shrine {{on the anniversary of}} his death is remarkable, as are the musical tributes from singers of the ranchera and mariachi genres that pay homage to him. As Mexican American author, Denise Chavez, in her book [...] "Loving Pedro Infante" [...] put it humorously, [...] "If you're a Mexican, and don't know who he is, you should be tied to a hot stove with a yucca rope and beaten with sharp dry corn husks as you stand in a vat of soggy fideos.

40|$|In {{chapter 3}} of the lecture notes, <b>you</b> <b>learned</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> prism {{compressor}} and grating compressor. Both compressor types use geometrical path length differences to generate negative group delay dispersion. (a) Read the paper O. E. Martinez et. al., ’Negative group-velocity dispersion using refraction’, J. Opt. Soc. Am. A 1 (10), 1003 - 1006 (1984) to get {{familiar with the}} idea that refraction as well as diffraction off a grating will always result in negative group delay dispersion (GDD). Show that this is the case for the grating compressor. If one wants to do chirped-pulse amplification as mentioned in the lecture notes or one wants to compress pulses in the anomalous dispersion regime of optical materials (e. g. pulses in the 1. 3 µm to 1. 6 µm wavelength range, where almost all transparent materials exhibit anomalous dispersion), large amounts of adjustable positive dispersion is required. Here, we will find out how to obtain positive GDD from a grating arrangement. (b) Use the above mentioned paper by Martinez to derive the GDD of a grating compressor. Hint: you just have to do the calculation for a two-grating compressor arrangement- the full GDD of a four-grating compressor is twice the result you will get. (c) Now, modify your equation for the case of an arrangement as shown in Fig. 2 of the Martinez paper (grating- telescope- grating). Show that this modified optical setup can be used to produce positive GDD. (d) How would one choose the magnification factor in a real-world implementation of such a pulse stretcher? And where would you put the grating if you wanted to implement an optical pulse shaper...|$|E

30|$|Cognitive Research: Principles and Implications (CRPI) {{is a new}} journal with ambitions. Not only do we want {{to publish}} first-rate {{cognitive}} research, we want to change the standard way that our discipline thinks about basic and applied research. The standard view is dichotomous: Is your research basic, fundamental, and pure or applied, translational, and practical? We know about dichotomies in our trade. Remember when <b>you</b> <b>learned</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> nature-nurture debate? The topic might have been intelligence or mental illness, and the question was framed in terms of whether this attribute of our lives was due to our genetic endowment or to what we had learned in the world. Some cases were reasonably clear: eye color — nature; memory for the names of U.S. Republican presidential candidates — nurture. However, for the more interesting cases, we learned soon enough that the correct answer is almost never nature or nurture; it is both. Having gotten that question right on the midterm, we moved on to a discussion of how much of intelligence or mental illness or whatever can be attributed to genes and how much to environment. Eye color and Republican candidates’ names hold down the two ends of a nature-nurture continuum, but where is something like intelligence on that continuum? The press and the Internet are fond of this exercise. “Thank your parents if you are smart,” says the United Kingdom’s Daily Mail, because “up to 40  % of a child’s intelligence is inherited.” What does such a claim mean? The article does go on {{to say that this is}} an estimate of how much variance is explained by genetics. Interestingly, these discussions of apportioning variance tend to stick with the main effects and never discuss the interaction term in this implicit two-way analysis of variance, though much of the action presumably lies in that interaction term.|$|E

Its newsroom budget is less than $25,000 a month. It has but 19 editorial staff; it has faced repeated attacks from regime-allied oligarchs. The fact its reporting survives at all, let alone flourishes, comes down to the unlikeliest of pairings: a journalist from Minnesota and an Anglo-Pakistani billionaire.
