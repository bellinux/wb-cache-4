Jimmy Pitaro, president of Disney Interactive Studios stated [...] "we wanted to take everything that worked so well and make it epic." [...] Each character was picked based on how they would fit in the game, as said by TQ Jefferson, [...] "what you're going to see as we roll out and reveal more characters, is that they're going to be more characters that you've known forever and they make sense," [...] Jefferson said. [...] "And the other characters, <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> them as well, but once you see them in-game, you're going to understand why we made the choices that we made. These characters bring a certain narrative strength with them and, just as important, they bring a unique bit of gameplay with them ... characters that are the most fun to play ... that have the most impact on story. Once you see the full spectrum of characters, it's not just an Avengers game. It's very much a Marvel super heroes game." ...|$|E

According to this most affable and {{distinguished}} prelate, now no more, he once arrived in a large country house shortly before dinner-time; he was led to his chamber, he dressed, and went downstairs. Not knowing the plan of the house, he found {{his way into the}} library, a chamber lined with the books of many studious generations. Here the learned bishop remained for a few minutes, when the gong sounded for dinner, and a domestic, entering the apartment showed the prelate the way to the drawing-room, where the other guests were now assembled. The bishop, when the company appeared complete, and was beginning to manoeuvre towards the dining-room, addressed his host (whom we shall call Lord Birkenhead), and observed that the ecclesiastic had not yet appeared.|$|R
