5|$|I {{wanted to}} speak a little about people who {{impressed}} the most, and somehow I kept on ignoring his performances in my previous two banters during this Olympiad, which is ridiculous, but I think pride of place goes to Eugenio Torre. <b>You</b> <b>probably</b> <b>know</b> who he is, and you probably have read about his results by now, but what he achieved during this Olympiad is absolutely tremendous. He {{is by no means}} a young man by now and he... played a tremendous level of opposition. The Philippines are a decently strong team and they played very, very decent opposition almost throughout the tournament. The result Eugenio showed in this event is absolutely fantastic.|$|E
25|$|Indie {{asked me}} if I would keep the Barely Legal Radio program on Indie but stop doing mornings. I said yes. I loved doing the morning show for 2½ years but I am also looking forward to not getting up at 4 am any more. If you've ever had a morning job like this, <b>you</b> <b>probably</b> <b>know</b> the relief I feel, but I will still miss seeing Liz and Jose every day, having David Lynch as my weatherman, and talking to Timothy Olyphant about sports each morning. These will always rank with the coolest things I’ve ever been {{fortunate}} enough to do in my entire life.|$|E
500|$|Gedeon {{was drafted}} into the {{military}} in January 1941, and reported to the Army instead of spring training. [...] He was inducted at Fort Thomas, Kentucky and reported to the Cavalry Replacement Center at Fort Riley on March 18. [...] He immediately became an acting corporal of Troop B of the First Squadron for the thirteen-week training program. The Bentley Historical Library at the University of Michigan owns a copy of an April 1941 fraternity newsletter with a note from Gedeon. [...] "As <b>you</b> <b>probably</b> <b>know</b> by this time", {{he wrote to his}} Phi Gamma Delta brothers, [...] "Old Ged has been drafted." [...] On being assigned to the cavalry, Gedeon joked in the letter to his fraternity that [...] "the only horse I ever saw in my life was the one the milkman used." ...|$|E

It’s obvious that there was {{something}} crooked about the wreck, and what you have told us implies that some men with money are anxious to cover up their tracks. I suspect they’ve grown richer since the bogus gold was shipped, and might be willing to spend a good sum to keep the matter dark.

500|$|By early 1965 Josiffe was in Dublin, {{where he}} worked at various horse-related jobs while {{continuing}} to badger Thorpe by letter about his missing luggage and the continuing National Insurance card issue. However, Thorpe rejected any responsibility for these matters. In mid-March 1965 Josiffe wrote a long letter to Thorpe's mother, which began: [...] "For the last five years, as <b>you</b> <b>probably</b> <b>know,</b> Jeremy and I have had a homosexual relationship." [...] The letter blamed Thorpe for awakening [...] "this vice that lies latent in every man", and accused him of callousness and disloyalty. Ursula Thorpe gave the letter to her son, who drafted a quasi-legal statement rejecting the [...] "damaging and groundless accusations" [...] and accusing Josiffe of attempting to blackmail him. The document was never sent; instead, Thorpe turned to Bessell for advice.|$|E
500|$|Some {{commentators}} have criticized Ryan's votes {{for what they}} believe were deficit-increasing policies during the George W. Bush administration as being inconsistent with fiscal conservatism. While he voted for the two Bush tax cuts (in 2001 and 2003), he also voted for the 2003 bill that created the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit, the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), and the $700 billion bank bailout, and Ryan was one of 32 Republicans in the House {{to vote for the}} auto industry bailout. In 2011 President Barack Obama criticized Ryan as [...] "not [...] on the level" [...] by describing himself as a fiscal conservative while voting for these policies, as well as two [...] "unpaid for" [...] wars. Columnist Ezra Klein wrote in 2012: [...] "If you know about Paul Ryan at all, <b>you</b> <b>probably</b> <b>know</b> him as a deficit hawk. But, Ryan has voted to increase deficits and expand government spending too many times for that to be his north star." ...|$|E

Club stated, [...] "For {{the first}} time, Cudi is more {{interested}} in throwing an actual party than a pity party, and with his bass-engulfed beats and chewy, sing-along hooks, he’s well-suited to the task. In spite of its brighter outlook, though, Indicud is still a Kid Cudi record." [...] Logan Smithson of PopMatters said, [...] "If you've heard a Kid Cudi album before, <b>you</b> <b>probably</b> <b>know</b> what you’re going to get from Indicud, and for those who have been patiently awaiting his latest release, that's great news. Indicud features some of Kid Cudi’s best songs to date, and is an overall enjoyable listen from start to finish." [...] Chris Coplan of Consequence of Sound stated, [...] "It's ass-backwards to make other people look the best on your solo album. Still, that might demonstrate the path of Kid Cudi isn't about being a rapper, a singer, or something in between. The point is, this record just proves that Kid Cudi has a lot of sorting to do, and continuing down the same old path simply won’t cut it in the long-run." [...] Joe Gross of Rolling Stone said, [...] "Someday this Cleveland MC/producer/former weed enthusiast will find the lyrical and vocal charisma to match the scrumptiously dark, quasi-industrial tenor of his moody beats. But Cudi’s pitchy-dawg voice remains his own worst enemy." ...|$|E

But I want to emphasize up front that smart tenants realize that if they push their legal rights to the limit, they probably will lose the lease in the end.

500|$|In November 2004 it was {{announced}} that Leslie Grantham had not renewed his contract and that Den Watts would depart EastEnders in what was described by The Mirror as an [...] "explosive" [...] and final exit. The storyline became one of [...] "the program's biggest and most high-profile narratives", dominating the entire year, and made the character of Chrissie Watts the [...] "centrepiece" [...] of the show. The lead-up to the 20th anniversary episode in February was an immensely high-profile affair, with Imogen Ridgway and Richard Godwin of the Evening Standard dryly observing that [...] "unless you've been living on Titan <b>you</b> <b>probably</b> <b>know</b> that EastEnders is 20 years old and Dirty Den is once again leaving Albert Square." [...] Events in the show centre around Chrissie manipulating Sam Mitchell and Zoe Slater in a plot of revenge against Den, the three women being dubbed the [...] "Witches of Walford" [...] by the popular press in reference to Shakespeare's play, Macbeth. The prelude to Den's death further highlighted and showcased Chrissie's manipulative character and conniving personality in her representation as a [...] "strong" [...] and [...] "forceful" [...] figure. When she secretly learns that Zoe is pregnant by Den, she plays on Zoe's insecurities and vulnerabilities and [...] "coerces" [...] her into having an abortion. The pregnancy represented a double blow to Chrissie as Den had always resisted having children with her, and as with Kate Mitchell, Chrissie determines to teach Zoe a harsh lesson about [...] "messing with other people's husbands". The possessive nature of his wife was noted by Den, who warns Zoe that Chrissie [...] "tends to blame the women that lead me astray." ...|$|E

In 2010, Vice President of the United States Joe Biden, while speaking to the European Parliament, said: [...] ""As <b>you</b> <b>probably</b> <b>know,</b> some American politicians and American journalists refer to Washington, D.C. as the 'capital of the free world.'

2500|$|AMM is a British free {{improvisation}} {{group that}} was founded in London, England, in 1965. The group was initially composed of Keith Rowe on guitar, Lou Gare on saxophone and Eddie Prévost on drums. The three men shared a common interest in exploring music {{beyond the boundaries of}} conventional jazz, {{as part of a larger}} movement that helped spawn European free jazz and free improvisation. AMM have never been well known to the general public, but have been influential on the field of improvised music. Most of their recordings have been released on Matchless Recordings, which was run by founding member and percussionist Eddie Prévost. In a 2001 interview, founding member Keith Rowe was asked if [...] "AMM" [...] was an abbreviation; he replied, [...] "The letters AMM stand for something, but as <b>you</b> <b>probably</b> <b>know</b> it's a secret!" ...|$|E
