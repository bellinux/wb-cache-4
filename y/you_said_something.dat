6000|$|... "Oh! my {{attendant}} knights! no, indeed; {{you gave}} me such very slight hope of success; besides, <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>something</b> about my not wanting them." ...|$|E
60|$|MRS. MEGAN. [Impassive.] <b>You</b> <b>said</b> <b>something</b> abaht makin' {{a picture}} of me. [With faint eagerness.] So I thought I might come, in case you'd forgotten.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, get to business, then," [...] went on {{the lumber}} merchant. [...] "I {{am not going to}} stay here all day. <b>You</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> had <b>something</b> to say that would {{interest}} me." ...|$|R
60|$|Ans. When {{you have}} proved {{that there is}} no such thing as an orderly edifying of the church, without water baptism precede, then it will be time enough to think <b>you</b> have <b>said</b> <b>something.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "No; nothing. I {{shall be}} back to dinner. But I must go down to Birmingham, to see a friend of Happerton's on business. I will breakfast at the station. As <b>you</b> <b>said</b> to-day, <b>something</b> must be done. If it's to sweep a crossing, I must sweep it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The explosion! The strike!" [...] she exclaimed; {{suddenly}} enlightened. [...] "Now I remember! <b>You</b> <b>said</b> <b>something</b> about Hampton being nitro-glycerine--human nitro-glycerine. You predicted this strike." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "True, true, uncle--I had forgot that," [...] exclaimed the {{volatile}} Hector; [...] "but <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>something</b> just now that put {{everything out of}} my head." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{were going}} into the law, weren't you?" [...] I asked. [...] "I {{remember}} <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>something</b> about it that day we met at Beverly Farms." ...|$|E
6000|$|TERESA. Do you? I think <b>you</b> {{might have}} <b>said</b> <b>something</b> {{more to me}} than [...] "Is that yourself?" [...] You couldn't say less to the postman.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am. Why did {{the fellow}} hint he'd come {{because he wanted}} to see <b>you?</b> He <b>said</b> <b>something</b> about looking for a line for a wagon road, but he'd have struck the valley the road will go through sooner if he'd pushed on east. I can't see what he did want." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{certainly}} is," [...] he answered. [...] "I believe <b>you</b> {{have already}} <b>said</b> <b>something</b> {{very much like}} your last remark. Still, you see, I don't propose to come often." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{am going}} to tell you. <b>You</b> <b>said</b> <b>something</b> so strange and so wrong that you must answer for it. But first I must know its truth.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It doesn't much matter. <b>You</b> <b>said</b> <b>something</b> {{about some}} {{property}} you've got in diamonds, {{and you said}} once that you must go out to look after it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, son, up in Adrian's chamber {{just now}} <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>something</b> about having made {{a map of}} the hiding-place of the gold. Where is it, for it should be put in safety?" ...|$|E
60|$|THE STATUE. Ha ha! Do you {{remember}} how I frightened <b>you</b> when I <b>said</b> <b>something</b> like that to you from my pedestal in Seville? It sounds rather flat without my trombones.|$|R
6000|$|... "Just {{to ask him}} if there's {{anything}} we can do," [...] murmurs Socrates persuasively. [...] "He's like to hang to-morrow, <b>you</b> <b>said,</b> well! grant <b>something</b> then to a dying man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, brother," [...] said Hake, laughing, [...] "ye {{look at me}} as earnestly as if <b>you</b> had <b>said</b> <b>something</b> smart; whereas I regard {{your idea}} as but a clumsy one. A billet of wood laid across your friend's bed might more fitly suggest {{that you wanted to}} knock out his brains, or damage his skin, or burn him alive!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. But that's your idea. Don't you {{remember}} <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>something</b> {{of the kind}} {{the night of the}} election, years ago? It occurred to me to-day, when I was looking at him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{long are}} you going to remain at the Hall, Dick? When you came back <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>something</b> about going out West with your father to look up that mining claim in Colorado." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's what I {{tried to}} hint. You {{can count on}} my {{recommendation}} when it's likely to be of use, but <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>something</b> that was rather illuminating. You want to use your judgment?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have fancied now {{and then}} that <b>you</b> must have <b>said</b> <b>something</b> remarkably in my favor that day at Scarthwaite," [...] he said. [...] "I never quite {{understood}} what brought up the subject, but Julia once referred to a picture." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's true," [...] Colston broke in. [...] "I {{took it from}} him, {{for fear}} of an accident. Mr. Jernyngham was in a very nervous and excited state. He has, of course, been bearing a heavy strain, and I imagine <b>you</b> must have <b>said</b> <b>something</b> that rather upset his balance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Be {{right along}} now, Mr. Lander," [...] said the clerk, soothingly. He stepped {{out to the}} {{platform}} that the teams drove up to from the stable, {{and came back to}} say that it was coming. [...] "I believe <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> wanted <b>something</b> you could drive yourself?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{what did}} you say to him? <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>something.</b> You did not, at any rate, bid him {{remember}} that he was a poor labouring man, and that you were a lady of high rank." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thanks for the compliment, Freddie; but I should {{imagine that}} {{something}} a little more solid than a persuasive way would be required in a case like this. <b>You</b> <b>said</b> <b>something</b> a while ago about five hundred pounds?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Concealed your affection, Reginald!" [...] she repeated. [...] "How strangely that sounds! But listen. <b>You</b> <b>said</b> <b>something</b> {{just now}} about my allowance. If I allude {{to it in}} return, will you {{believe that it is}} entirely for your sake?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are you {{setting a}} trap for me?" [...] she asked. [...] "No!" [...] she cried, before Amelius could answer, [...] "I am not mean enough to {{distrust}} you--I forgot myself. <b>You</b> have innocently <b>said</b> <b>something</b> that rankles in my mind. I can't leave it {{where you have}} left it; I don't like {{to be told that}} I shouldn't recognize her. Give me time to think. I must clear this up." ...|$|R
40|$|If only {{he could}} learn to control his behavior, he would … If {{only he could}} {{organize}} and plan better, he would be … H ave you ever heard someone say or have <b>you</b> ever <b>said</b> <b>something</b> like this to a student or perhaps to your own child? Helping children gain self-control to reduce problem behaviors and increase desirable behaviors is a never-ending issue with educators. Likewise, facilitating the de-velopment and use of organization and planning skills by children can be challenging. For many, the traditional method of helping children develop self-control, organi-zation, and planning skills is to discuss with them {{what they are doing}} wrong and then, when time permits, de-scribe to them what they should do instead.

6000|$|... "No, there's that, of course. I was {{thinking}} of girls in general. Some girls bar golf, and then it's rather difficult {{to know how to}} start conversation. But, tell me, were there any topics which got on Miss Bennett's nerves, if you know what I mean? It seems to me that {{at one time or another}} <b>you</b> may have <b>said</b> <b>something</b> that offended her. I mean, it seems curious that she should have broken off the engagement if you had never disagreed or quarrelled about anything." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I can; and I do like it, and I {{mean to do}} it. But it isn't {{only about}} that I've come to speak to you. <b>You</b> <b>said</b> <b>something</b> to me to-day, before Honyman, that was very improper." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, you won't see {{anything}} of her, Georgie. She's busy with her music or her mother all day. Besides, you're {{going up to}} town tomorrow, aren't you? I thought <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>something</b> about an Institute meeting?" [...] The mother spoke.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{begin to}} perceive,' he said, 'you rushed into an {{undertaking}} that became awkward, {{and when you}} had to draw off, the young fellow was upset and did not mind his business. So far I understand, but <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>something</b> about prison.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hush! hush! {{you must}} not say that. Come and shake hands, Jack, and make it up. I do feel irritable--I don't know what's the matter with me. Remember, Mr. Keller doesn't like your joining in the talk at dinner-time--he thinks it is taking a liberty. That was one reason why I stopped you. And <b>you</b> might have <b>said</b> <b>something</b> to offend Madame Fontaine--that was another. It will not be long before {{we go back to}} our dear old London. Now, be a good boy, and leave me to my work." ...|$|R

6000|$|Submitting sadly, {{she let me}} {{take her}} in my arms, and try to cheer her. But when I alluded to what I owed to her admirable devotion and courage, she entreated me to be silent. [...] "Don't bring it all back!" [...] she cried, shuddering at the remembrances which I had awakened, [...] "Father <b>said</b> <b>you</b> had <b>something</b> to tell me. What is it?" ...|$|R
