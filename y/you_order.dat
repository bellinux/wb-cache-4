500|$|Questlove was the [...] "musical powerhouse" [...] behind {{several of}} the Soulquarians' {{projects}} during the late 1990s and early 2000s, including Voodoo and Things Fall Apart. In a 2002 interview, he told critic Jim DeRogatis {{about his role in}} recording Voodoo and being a part of the Soulquarians, stating [...] "I tried to do all in my power that I could to bring people together – to bring Common to Electric Lady, have him record here whenever so that he could record with some of these other artists. You'd just come into [...] A Room, you don't even know who has a session, but you call me: 'Who's down there?' 'Common's in there today'. So you come down, <b>you</b> <b>order</b> some food, sit down and bulls—, watch a movie, and then it's, 'Let's play something'. And I say, 'Who wants this ?' And it would be, 'I want it!' 'No, I want it!'". Questlove has referred to the recording experience at the studio as a [...] "left-of-center black music renaissance".|$|E

2500|$|In May 2015, Black {{addressed}} the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development. She {{told the audience}} that anxiety and depression have [...] "no objective signs. When you examine a person, you can't get an objective disease; it's {{not in front of}} you" [...] - a claim that appears to diverge from the principles underpinning the mental state examination, where clinical signs of anxiety, such as tremor, or clinical signs of depression, such as psychomotor retardation, are identified. She also appeared to suggest that because mental illnesses do not show up on X-rays, they have less of a scientific basis than diseases that do. With stress disorders and depression, she explained: [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>order</b> an X-ray or a test, you don't get a positive result".|$|E

2500|$|A Midrash {{found in}} [...] {{support for the}} proverb that if a person tells {{you that you have}} a donkey's ears, do not believe it, but if two tell it to <b>you,</b> <b>order</b> a halter. For Abraham called Hagar Sarai's servant the first time in [...] saying, [...] "Behold, your maid is in your hand." [...] And then the angel called Hagar Sarai's servant the second time in [...] saying, [...] "Hagar, Sarai's handmaid." [...] Thus, {{thereafter}} in [...] Hagar acknowledged that she was Sarai's servant, saying, [...] "I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai." [...] Similarly, Rava asked Rabbah bar Mari where Scripture supports the saying of the Rabbis that if your neighbor (justifiably) calls you a donkey, you should put a saddle on your back (and not quarrel to convince the neighbor otherwise). Rabbah bar Mari replied that the saying found support in [...] where first the angel calls Hagar [...] "Sarai's handmaid," [...] and then Hagar acknowledged that she was Sarai's servant, saying, [...] "I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai.".

2500|$|Young Kilpatrick {{had little}} {{experience}} in commanding cavalry, and he demonstrated that by attacking fortified infantry positions in a piecemeal fashion. West {{of the road}} Merritt went in first, with his 6th Pennsylvania cavalrymen fighting dismounted. Anderson's Georgians repulsed their attack easily. Farnsworth was to follow, but he was astonished to hear Kilpatrick's order for a mounted cavalry charge. The Confederate defenders were positioned behind a stone fence with wooden fence rails piled high above it, too high for horses to jump, which would require the attackers to dismount under fire and dismantle the fence. The terrain leading to it was broken, undulating ground, with large boulders, fences and woodlots, making it unsuitable for a cavalry charge. Accounts differ as {{to the details of}} the argument between Farnsworth and Kilpatrick, but it is generally believed that Kilpatrick dared or shamed Farnsworth into making the charge the latter knew would be suicidal. Farnsworth allegedly said, [...] "General, if <b>you</b> <b>order</b> the charge I will lead it, but you must take the awful responsibility." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{aftermath}} of the 20 July plot coincided with the rout of the German armies in both {{the east and the}} west. In the east Operation Bagration destroyed Army Group Centre and drove the Germans out of Byelorussia and eastern Poland: they were also forced out of the Balkans. In the west, the Americans, British and Canadians broke out of the Normandy pocket and swept across France, taking Paris on 25 August and Brussels on 3 September. The German command in the west was reorganised following the suicide of Kluge, the arrest of Stülpnagel and the incapacitation of Rommel. Field Marshal Walter Model, known as [...] "the Führer's fireman" [...] for his reputation for stabilising dangerous situations, was appointed both OB West and commander of Army Group B on 16 August, but even he could not do justice to both jobs. At Blumentritt's urgent request, supported by Model, Hitler agreed to ask Rundstedt to resume his post as OB West, which at a meeting on 1 September he agreed to do, saying [...] "My Führer, whatever <b>you</b> <b>order,</b> I shall do to my last breath." ...|$|E

2500|$|Second, Searle {{believes}} we can rationally {{do things}} that don't result from our own desires. It is widely believed that one cannot derive an [...] "ought" [...] from an [...] "is", i.e. that facts about how the world is can never {{tell you what you}} should do ('Hume's Law'). By contrast, in so far as a fact is understood as relating to an institution (marriage, promises, commitments, etc.), which is to be understood as a system of constitutive rules, then what one should do can be understood as following from the institutional fact of what one has done; institutional fact, then, can be understood as opposed to the [...] "brute facts" [...] related to Hume's Law. For example, Searle believes the fact that you promised to do something means you should do it, because by making the promise you are participating in the constitutive rules that arrange the system of promise making itself, and therefore understand a [...] "shouldness" [...] as implicit in the mere factual action of promising. Furthermore, he believes that this provides a desire-independent reason for an action—if <b>you</b> <b>order</b> a drink at a bar, you should pay for it even if you have no desire to. This argument, which he first made in his paper, [...] "How to Derive 'Ought' from 'Is'" [...] (1964), remains highly controversial, but even three decades later Searle continued to defend his view that [...] "..the traditional metaphysical distinction between fact and value cannot be captured by the linguistic distinction between 'evaluative' and 'descriptive' because all such speech act notions are already normative." ...|$|E

5000|$|When Muhammad {{heard that}} Abu Sufyan's caravan was {{returning}} from Syria, he consulted the Muslims {{over whether to}} attack. He did not listen to either Abu Bakr or Umar. Then Sa'd ibn Ubadah stood up and said: [...] "Allah's Messenger, you want us Ansar. If <b>you</b> <b>ordered</b> us to plunge our horses into the sea, we would do so. If <b>you</b> <b>ordered</b> us to goad our horses as far as Bark al-Ghimad, we would do so." [...] Muhammad then called upon the men to march to Badr.|$|R
