500|$|The song {{quotes a}} line from the Merseys' 1966 hit [...] "Sorrow" [...] – [...] "With <b>your</b> <b>long</b> blonde hair and your eyes of blue" [...] – a {{reference}} that has led some commentators to interpret [...] "It's All Too Much" [...] as a love song to Harrison's wife, Pattie Boyd, a blonde-haired former fashion model. At another point on the recording, the trumpets play part of Jeremiah Clarke's [...] "Prince of Denmark's March". The Beatles' use of musical and lyrical quotations here pre-dates [...] "All You Need Is Love", which was written by Lennon and recorded in June 1967 for the group's appearance on the Our World television broadcast. While noting the similar ideological theme behind the two compositions, Inglis writes of Harrison and Lennon [...] "presenting alternative accounts of the same subject" [...] in the manner of French Impressionists such as Monet, Renoir and Manet, each of whom painted their own interpretations of sites in Paris and Argenteuil.|$|E
500|$|In the {{original}} pitch to overseas The Walt Disney Company executives, Povenmire and Marsh constructed storyboards and recorded them with dialogue and sound-effects. As a prototype, Ferb {{did not speak}} at all. However, after considering comedy's [...] "big duos" [...] including Wallace and Gromit and Jay and Silent Bob, the creators chose to have Ferb speak {{at least once in}} most episodes (but in [...] "Summer Belongs To You" [...] he spoke nine times and in [...] "The Lizard Whisperer" [...] gives an entire short speech that lasts about 45 seconds), but to have him remain silent and allow Phineas to speak for him the majority of the time. Although Ferb's taciturnity is generally not commented on in the series, Phineas mentions it while he and his brother were in England on the episode [...] "A Hard Day's Knight": [...] "I'll be the top half since I tend to do more of the talking and you will be on the bottom part because of <b>your</b> <b>long</b> spindely legs". Despite being quiet, Ferb is a polyglot, being able to speak in human, animal, and alien tongues.|$|E
2500|$|Southey's {{contemporary}} James Losh {{believed that}} the poem was [...] "superior to anything before written by Southey". A letter from Charles Lamb to Southey dated 6 May 1815 said, [...] "I have, since the receipt of your present, read it quite through again, and with no diminished pleasure. I don't know whether I ought {{to say that it}} has given me more pleasure than any of <b>your</b> <b>long</b> poems. Kehama is doubtless more powerful, but I don't feel that firm footing in it that I do in Roderick". An anonymous review in the December 1814 Theatrical Inquisitor argued, [...] "It is scarcely possible to view the errors of exalted genius without breathing a sigh of compassion and regret. The generous mind feels humiliated at the contemplation [...] Such are the feelings that must be excited by the reader of Southey's poems [...] The story of the present poem is interesting, and would probably have made an excellent romance. It has, however, several capital defects, that make it altogether unfit for an heroic poem".|$|E
