I am at the ends of the earth, but the distance cannot tempt me to make my vows to another goddess. Love of the truth brought me to Tibur, but Onuava’s favorable powers came with me. Thus, divine mother, far from my home-land, exiled in Italy, I address my vows and prayers to <b>you</b> <b>no</b> less.|$|E

25|$|I {{always had}} the feeling that no one {{understood}} me anyway, that no one knew who I was and what made me do this or that.

They don't even have to have been there, but if they do, they understand even better. Here in prison they were with me a lot. They came every night, whether I wanted them to or not. Before the trial I could still chase them away when they wanted to come.|$|E

500|$|Tom Young from BBC Music {{said that}} he did not see the actual {{performances}} on the tour and felt that [...] "some of the magnitude of the performance is lost and the track/scene changes appear needlessly long-winded. [...] As far as live albums go, this is a job well done." [...] Stephen M. Deusner from Pitchfork gave a negative review for the album, stating [...] "Madonna herself is mostly to blame. On stage, she draws from a deep well of amazing pop songs and has the money and power to reinvent this sort of traveling circus. So why not try to break down the wall between performance and audience and hold a gigantic rave? [...] Åkerlund gives you everything you don't want from a concert film: incessant quick cuts that you give <b>you</b> <b>no</b> sense of space or stage, overdubbed music and vocals that give <b>you</b> <b>no</b> sense of performance, and only a few shots of the audience to gauge their excitement." [...] Mini Anthikad-Chhibber The Hindu commented that [...] "Madonna pulls out all stops in this effort turn the world into a dance floor and one just has to doff one's hat to her energy." [...] At the 50th Grammy Awards held on February 10, 2008 at Staples Center in Los Angeles, The Confessions Tour won in the category of Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video.|$|E

500|$|Two {{songs are}} sung by Marianne in the film, with lyrics adapted from seventeenth-century poems.

The melody of [...] "Weep <b>You</b> <b>No</b> More Sad Fountains", Marianne's first song, appears in the opening credits, while her second song's melody features again during the ending credits, this time sung by dramatic soprano Jane Eaglen. The songs were written by Doyle before filming began. The composer received his first Academy Award nomination for his score.|$|E
500|$|In April 1954, McCarthy {{was also}} under {{attack in the}} Army–McCarthy {{hearings}}.

In an exchange that reflected the increasingly negative public opinion of McCarthy, Welch rebuked the senator: [...] "Have <b>you</b> <b>no</b> sense of decency, sir?

500|$|Even before Welch asked McCarthy, [...] "Have <b>you</b> <b>no</b> {{sense of}} decency, sir, at long last?" [...] in the hearings, {{one of the}} most {{prominent}} attacks on McCarthy's methods was an episode of the television documentary series See It Now, hosted by journalist Edward R. Murrow, which was broadcast on March 9, 1954. Titled [...] "A Report on Senator Joseph R. McCarthy", the episode consisted largely of clips of McCarthy speaking. In these clips, McCarthy accuses the Democratic party of [...] "twenty years of treason", describes the American Civil Liberties Union as [...] "listed as 'a front for, and doing the work of', the Communist Party", and berates and harangues various witnesses, including General Zwicker.|$|E
500|$|During {{the trials}} Jesus speaks very little, mounts no defense, and gives very {{infrequent}} and indirect {{answers to the}} priests' questions, prompting an officer to slap him.

[...] In [...] the high priest then asks Jesus, [...] "Are you the Messiah, the Son of the Blessed One?" [...] Jesus replies, [...] "I am", and then predicts {{the coming of the}} Son of Man. This provokes Caiaphas to tear his own robe in anger and to accuse Jesus of blasphemy. In Matthew and Luke, Jesus' answer is more ambiguous: in [...] he responds, [...] "You have said so", and in [...] he says, [...] "You say that I am".|$|E
