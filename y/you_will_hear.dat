25|$|Along the African coast <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>hear</b> that dirge-like {{strain in}} all their songs, as at work or {{paddling}} their canoes to and from shore, they keep time to the music. On the southern plantations <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>hear</b> it also, and in the negro melodies every where, plaintive and melodious, sad and earnest. It seems like the dirge of national degradation, the wail of a race, stricken and crushed, familiar with tyranny, submission and unrequited labor… And here I cannot help noticing the similarity existing between the working chorus of the sailors and the dirge-like negro melody, to which my attention was specially directed by an incident I witnessed or rather heard.|$|E
25|$|A {{wide variety}} of wild animals and birds have been {{observed}} in the area. The ones you might see when rambling around the countryside are wild boar, deer, foxes, hares and rabbits. The birds in your garden will include sparrows, swallows, starlings, crows, rooks, magpies, pigeons, finches and robins {{and you may be}} lucky enough to see flocks of migrating wild geese flying by. In the forest, <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>hear</b> - and sometimes see - owls and woodpeckers. Some species have suffered from hunting in recent years but there are now considerable efforts to protect flora and fauna. An area of the commune's forest is now a nature reserve.|$|E
500|$|No {{post-production}} overdubbing {{was done}} in the studio. Occasional wrong notes can be heard in the final product of the recording. Wednesday 13 admitted, [...] "First off, let me say this is a live recording. This is not a live recording where we went back into the studio and overdubbed guitar parts or vocals. This is us ... LIVE! If we make a mistake, <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>hear</b> it. If my voice cracks, you hear it. This is as close to a live experience as we could give." ...|$|E

500|$|Williams felt music lacked energy, citing Limp Bizkit's [...] "Nookie" [...] as {{the last}} {{energetic}} record. Williams suggested his engineer, Andrew Coleman, to [...] "put the drums and bass on the right, keys in the middle, and the mothafucking guitar and backgrounds on the left". Coleman denied his request, saying, [...] "those systems were different back then. If we do that, you'll be in a club and all <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>hear</b> {{on one side of}} the club is drums and on the other side, just chords." ...|$|E
500|$|In December 1895, the Boston Daily Globe {{published}} a lengthy biography of Lowe, whom the paper described as Boston's [...] "quiet, unassuming but phenomenal second baseman." [...] The Globe {{noted that the}} ease with which Lowe played the game led many to understate his value to the club:"For a grand player, Lowe is seldom given the credit often dished out to his inferiors. His work does not appeal to the bleachers and grandstand like the less natural and clumsy player who is often seen floundering around like a fish out of water, while the crowd enjoy the effort and go home to tell what great playing they saw. 'He is a hard worker,' <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>hear</b> them say. Bobby Lowe is not only a hard worker but a conscientious player and an artist of the first magnitude." ...|$|E
500|$|Martin Singer, an {{attorney}} representing Cosby, {{made a statement}} in which he asserted Dickinson was not being truthful in her account. After Singer's statement, Dickinson reappeared on a subsequent broadcast of Entertainment Tonight to reassert her account from her prior interview on the program. In addition, she publicized photographs she took with a Polaroid camera of Cosby wearing a checkered bathrobe {{in order to support}} her assertions. In the interview with Kevin Frazier she stated her account was the truth: [...] "It is not a lie. It is my right as a woman. I have to speak up {{and you have to be}} able to go in and just be brave and do it for all the women that can't come forward." [...] She explained her motivation for going public and her desire for her voice to be heard: [...] "The loss of innocence that I suffered and that these women suffered is why I'm sitting here today. And I don't care about what Cosby or networks or anybody says, <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>hear</b> me." ...|$|E

500|$|Rumors that Isabeau and Orléans were lovers {{began to}} circulate, a {{relationship}} that was considered incestuous. Whether the two were intimate has been questioned by contemporary historians, including Gibbons who believes the rumor may have been planted as propaganda against Isabeau as retaliation against tax increases she and Orléans ordered in 1405. An Augustinian friar, Jacques Legrand, preached a long sermon to the court denouncing excess and depravity, in particular mentioning Isabeau and her fashions—with exposed necks, shoulders and décolletage. The monk presented his sermon as allegory {{so as not to}} offend Isabeau overtly, but he cast her and her ladies-in-waiting as [...] "furious, vengeful characters". He said to Isabeau, [...] "If you don't believe me, go out into the city disguised as a poor woman, and <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>hear</b> what everyone is saying." [...] Thus he accused Isabeau as having lost touch with the commoners and the court with its subjects. At about the same time a satirical political pamphlet, Songe Veritable, now considered by historians to be pro-Burgundian propaganda, was released and widely distributed in Paris. The pamphlet hinted at the Queen's relations with Orléans.|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) {{received}} {{rave reviews}} from most music critics. In {{an article for}} The Source, The Ghetto Communicator wrote [...] "This record is harsh, {{but so is the}} world that we live in. For B-boys n'girls who come from the core of the hard, this is the hip-hop album you've been waiting for". Rolling Stones review was decidedly ambivalent, praising the album's sound, but noting that [...] "Wu-Tang... are more ciphers than masterful creations. In refusing to commodify themselves, they leave blank the ultimate canvas—the self." [...] Entertainment Weekly was more enthusiastic, giving the album an A, and writing that [...] "With its rumble jumble of drumbeats, peppered with occasional piano plunking, Enter has a raw, pass-the-mike flavor we haven't heard since rap was pop's best-kept secret." [...] Touré declared of the album, that [...] "This is hip-hop you won't find creeping up the Billboard charts but <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>hear</b> booming out of Jeep stereos in all the right neighborhoods." [...] However, Enter the Wu-Tang had surprising chart success, despite its raw, underground sound. It peaked at number 41 on the Billboard 200 chart and reached number eight on Billboards Top R/Hip Hop Albums chart. The album continued to sell steadily and was eventually certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America on May 15, 1995.|$|E

2500|$|Extol {{generally}} received {{high praise}} from critics, who championed the album as marking {{the return of}} a classic band. Petra Schurer of Metal Hammer Germany rated the album six out of seven, lauding the band for combining brilliant solos and forceful vocals {{with a sense of}} groove, a style which only a few bands pursue. He praised the band for creating songs which build slowly, not only through instrumentation but through the band's vocals. Rob Houston of HM rated the album four-point five stars out of five, calling it [...] "a long overdue masterpiece" [...] that is [...] "next to flawless, {{with some of the most}} amazing song structures <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>hear</b> this year." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some {{argue that}} such a fund {{is part of an}} ongoing refusal by the Japanese {{government}} to face up to its responsibilities, while others say that the Japanese government has long since finalised its responsibility to individual victims and is merely correcting the failures of the victims' own governments. California Congressman Mike Honda, speaking before U.S. House of Representatives on behalf of the women, said that [...] "without a sincere and unequivocal apology from the government of Japan, the majority of surviving Comfort Women refused to accept these funds. In fact, as <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>hear</b> today, many Comfort Women returned the Prime Minister's letter of apology accompanying the monetary compensation, saying they felt the apology was artificial and disingenuous." ...|$|E
2500|$|Among {{those with}} a more {{negative}} view of the album was Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic, who described the album's sound as [...] "passé" [...] and summed the band's effort up as [...] "opting to create a muddled, colorless murk", giving it 2 and a half out of 5 stars. Johan Wippsson from Melodic acknowledged the band's progression but felt that the album is [...] "weak" [...] and [...] "too shattered". [...] NME magazine's Dan Silver gave it a rating of 2/10, calling it the [...] "sound of a band trying and failing to forge a new identity", and referring to the song [...] "Hands Held High", a song about terrorist attacks and war, as [...] "far and away the funniest thing <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>hear</b> all year".|$|E
