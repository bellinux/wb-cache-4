500|$|Colin Salmon plays James Middleton, a {{civil servant}} who sits between the British {{government}} and the Ministry of Defence. Salmon previously worked with Sky1 on Hex. He was attracted to the role in Strike Back due to the script being [...] "a page-turner, and they're rare. It's really lovely to sit down to start reading something and then {{not be able to}} stop because <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what's going to happen next," [...] as well as hearing of who was involved in the project. A member of The Prince's Trust charity, Salmon took the opportunity to visit some of their projects in Soweto while the series was filmed.|$|E
500|$|Yeats {{was raised}} {{a member of}} the Protestant Ascendancy, which was at the time {{undergoing}} a crisis of identity. While his family was broadly supportive of the changes Ireland was experiencing, the nationalist revival of the late 19th century directly disadvantaged his heritage, and informed his outlook for the remainder of his life. In 1997, his biographer R. F. Foster observed that Napoleon's dictum that to understand the man <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> {{what was happening in the}} world when he was twenty [...] "is manifestly true of W.B.Y." [...] Yeats's childhood and young adulthood were shadowed by the power-shift away from the minority Protestant Ascendancy. The 1880s saw the rise of Charles Stewart Parnell and the home rule movement; the 1890s saw the momentum of nationalism, while the Catholics became prominent around the turn of the century. These developments had a profound effect on his poetry, and his subsequent explorations of Irish identity had a significant influence on the creation of his country's biography.|$|E

500|$|Sesame Street {{has used}} many writers in its long history. As Dave Connell, one of Sesame Streets {{original}} producers, has stated, {{it was difficult}} to find adults who could identify a preschooler's interest level. Fifteen writers a year worked on the show's scripts, but very few lasted longer than one season. Norman Stiles, head writer in 1987, reported that most writers would [...] "burn out" [...] after writing about a dozen scripts. According to Gikow, Sesame Street went against the convention of hiring teachers to write for the show, as most educational television programs did at the time. Instead, Cooney and the producers felt that {{it would be easier to}} teach writers how to interpret curriculum than to teach educators how to write comedy. As Stone stated, [...] "Writing for children is not so easy". Long-time writer Tony Geiss agreed, stating in 2009, [...] "It's not an easy show to write. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> the characters and the format and how to teach and be funny at the same time, which is a big, ambidextrous stunt".|$|E
500|$|VA Deputy Undersecretary for Health Administrative Operations William Schoenhard wrote a memo on March 15, 2013 {{indicating}} that the VA was changing its performance measure for appointment wait times. The new goal involved measuring {{the number of days}} between a veteran's desired appointment date and the actual date of the appointment. A VA Office of the Medical Inspector report from December 2013 showed a dramatic change in March 2013 of the number of appointments booked within the 14-day window for the Ft. Collins, Colorado outpatient clinic. When investigators asked VA employees to explain [...] "what occurred in March 2013" [...] the employees said that [...] "they were instructed by Business office staff to access the appointment schedule, review it for capacity, inform the Veteran of schedule availability, and then enter the Desired Date as the patient appointment date" [...] and [...] "By entering the Desired Date as the appointment date, the wait time … appears to be zero days." [...] The Ft. Collins clinic is overseen by the Cheyenne, Wyoming, Veterans Affairs office. A coordinator at the Cheyenne office sent an email on June 19, 2013 with instructions on how to manipulate the appointment dates. The coordinator wrote, [...] "Yes, it is gaming the system a bit, but <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> {{the rules of the game}} you are playing.” ...|$|E
500|$|Although Salman Khan was {{initially}} signed {{for the lead}} role, he later withdrew due to creative differences with the director. Shah Rukh Khan (who had originally declined due to a scheduling conflict with Karan Johar's Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna) was later confirmed as Kabir Khan. Khan accepted the role partly because he used to play hockey in college: [...] "I feel hockey as a sport has been monstrously neglected in our country. I used {{to play the game}} during college. In fact, I was quite a good hockey player. So the role was a lot like going back to my past." [...] Some media sources called the actor's role offbeat, since it departed from his usual romantic image and included neither lip synched songs nor a single female lead. Casting of the 16 actresses as the hockey players took over six months. Amin described the process as [...] "very, very difficult" [...] and [...] "very strenuous because the requirement was they had to play – and act". A four-month training camp was held where the girls learned the rules of the game, took acting lessons and followed a strict diet; safety precautions were also taken. According to Amin, [...] "Learning hockey is very tricky unlike, say, football. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> how to hold the stick, how to manoeuvre it, so it doesn't look fake on screen ... For those who were originally players, we had {{to make sure they were}} able to act as well. The dialogue was weighty; it isn't frivolous. It has to be delivered with a certain tone, in a certain manner". The actors, including Khan and the rest of the supporting cast, participated in a number of rehearsals and script readings before principal photography began.|$|E
