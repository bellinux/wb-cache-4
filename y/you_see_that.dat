25|$|Finding the French escort to be {{substantially}} larger than anticipated, {{and that it}} was manoeuvring to intercept them, Forrest called his captains together for a conference aboard his ship. The three captains met on the quarterdeck of Augusta, whereupon Forrest stated 'Well, gentlemen, <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> they have come out to engage us.' Suckling replied 'I {{think it would be a}} pity to disappoint them', to which Langdon agreed. Forrest then closed the discussion by saying 'very well, go onboard your ships again', which Langdon and Suckling proceeded to do, the conference having lasted just half a minute.|$|E
500|$|The dragons {{featured}} in the episode's finale were implemented by Bluebolt, UK, the lead VFX agency for the first season. VFX supervisor Angela Barson confirmed that the CGI dragons {{were among the most}} stressful effects, prompting sleepless nights. Commenting on the episode's climactic scene where the hatchling dragons are revealed, actress Emilia Clarke told VH1, [...] "You see the relationship that Dany has with her eggs, and <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> grow and grow and grow and kind of the intuitive connection she has with them, <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> develop really beautifully." [...] Clarke also hinted that she expected to [...] "get to play with some more dragons!" [...] in the second season, based on her conversations with book author and executive producer George R.R. Martin. [...] "VFX Data Wrangler" [...] Naill McEvoy has confirmed that dragon presence will be increasing in season two.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{featured}} guest actress Gillian Jacobs as the kidnapper Joanne Ostler. Jacobs explained her character's motivations, [...] "I'm a very mysterious figure, and at {{the beginning}} of the episode <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> I have taken this boy, have kidnapped him. I have taken him to this room and have him hooked him up to these EKG machines. I'm trying to get him to finish writing this piano piece which I need to help solve an equation...

500|$|In 2014, Kinberg {{said of the}} {{wobbling}} chess {{piece at}} the end of the film, [...] "There is a scene before the credits where Magneto's playing chess, and <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> he can just make the chess piece move, so there's a hint that he's starting to regain his powers. The leap from there was that cure from The Last Stand didn't work exactly the way they thought it would, and so we just leaped forward however many years, and he's got his powers back." ...|$|E
500|$|Dana White, {{president}} of Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), {{told reporters that}} he did not like the episode. He added, [...] "People like the [...] media always try to tell me that we're mainstream. [...] Did <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> Simpsons episode? Chuck Liddell signs an autograph for somebody, and he says, 'That will be $45, please'. The sport isn't like that at all. Then the promoter of the show fights Marge Simpson in the octagon, sucker-punches her in the face, and then says, 'You're the only woman I've ever hit that I didn't love'. That's the way mainstream looks at us and thinks of us, and I know that." ...|$|E
500|$|Naughty Dog {{designed}} Elena as a sidekick and {{a romantic}} interest to Drake, and her personality to complement his. However, she proves just as capable as Drake at gun battles and resourcefulness. Her voice actor commented, [...] "In the first game, she's a lot younger, she's {{a lot more}} naive, and she looks at things as being very possible, {{and in the second}} (game), has seen murders and adventure...the way that any person grows, <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> in her. She's a little bit more hesitant, a little more cynical". Commentators have mentioned how unusually strong and resilient Fisher is for a female character, and GamesRadar UK called her one of the strongest heroines in video gaming.|$|E

500|$|I don't want to {{escalate}} it because I like Madonna, [...] She's been {{to my house}} for dinner. It {{was something that was}} said {{in the heat of the}} moment, and probably should not have been said. [...] Would I apologize to her if I saw her? Yeah, because I don't want to hurt any artist's feelings. It was my fault. I instigated the whole thing. But it applies to all those bloody teenage singers. [...] The reaction to it was so hysterical, It was like I said, 'I think all gays should be killed or I think Hitler was right.' I just said someone was lip-synching. I'm not afraid to speak my mind. I'm not going to mellow with age. I get more enraged about things as I get older because <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> these injustices go on.|$|E
500|$|In the [...] "Inside the Episode" [...] {{featurette}} {{published by}} HBO following the airing of the episode, David Benioff {{spoke about the}} revelation in King's Landing, and Tommen's decision to abolish [...] "trial by combat," [...] stating [...] "This moment is a grievous blow for Cersei because she's been counting on trial by combat really {{since the end of}} season five. This was always her ace in the hole, the Mountain was never going to lose a trial by combat there's no one out there who could beat him. And then Tommen takes it away from her and knowing really what he's doing. He might be a weak King, but he's not an idiot, he understands that this move is going to mean that she's probably not going to fare that well in this trial. So it's a pretty devastating moment for Cersei, and <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> in her reaction, and partly because it just bodes so ill for this coming trial, and partly because it's her own son who's really betrayed her." ...|$|E
500|$|During an {{appearance}} on Top of the Pops, Morrissey appeared waving gladioli. A 2004 BBC Radio 2 feature on the song noted that the performance was most people's introduction to The Smiths and, [...] "therefore, to the weird, wordy world of Morrissey and the music of Johnny Marr". Uncut magazine, commentating on the nationally televised debut, wrote that [...] "Thursday evening when Manchester's feyest first appeared on Top of the Pops would be an unexpected pivotal cultural event {{in the lives of}} a million serious English boys. His very English, camp glumness was a revolt into Sixties kitchen-sink greyness against the gaudiness of the Eighties new wave music, as exemplified by Culture Club and their ilk. The Smiths' subject matter may have been 'squalid' but there was a purity of purpose about them that you messed with at your peril." [...] Noel Gallagher said of the performance: [...] "None of my mates liked them — they were more hooligan types. They came into work and said 'Fuckin' hell, did <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> poof on [...] "Top of the Pops" [...] with the bush in his back pocket?' But I thought it was life-changing." ...|$|E

500|$|Just {{prior to}} his {{departure}} for the front, the new army commander had held lengthy consultations with both Hitler and Halder. They impressed upon Model that great firmness {{would be necessary to}} save the army from destruction, and his vehement tone in reply so impressed Hitler that upon the General's departure he remarked: [...] "Did <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> eye? I trust that man to do it, but I wouldn't want to serve under him". When Model took over, his sector was in a shambles: the Kalinin Front had broken through the line and was threatening the Moscow-Smolensk railway, the main supply route for Army Group Centre. Despite the danger, he realized the precarious position the attackers themselves were in and immediately counterattacked, cutting off the Soviet 39th Army. In the ferocious battles that followed, he repelled multiple Soviet attempts to relieve their trapped soldiers, the last being in February. He then squeezed out the pocket at his leisure, in a series of operations culminating in mid-July. For this, he was awarded the Oak Leaves to the Knight's Cross and promoted to colonel general (Generaloberst).|$|E
500|$|In March 2014, Dinklage {{confirmed}} that Season 4 would [...] "stick fairly closely" [...] to Tyrion's plot line in A Storm of Swords, adding that [...] "those reversals of fortune really send [...] down the rabbit hole." [...] He {{notes that the}} character changes in Season 4, and [...] "really ends up {{in a different place}} than he thought he was going to. It's fueled a bit by anger towards his family, and trying to find his place in the world. <b>You</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> some people rely on drunk, funny Tyrion. I think funny and drunk lasts only so long. He sobers up in many ways. And love is in his life , and that causes a tremendous amount of damage – because he's vulnerable and he doesn't like to be vulnerable. He's completely stripped of his defense mechanisms." [...] Of Tyrion's relationship with his brother Jaime, Dinklage said, [...] "If you're raised together, you have an unspoken dialogue many times, and it's very easy, especially between Jaime and Tyrion. They have a real friendship, a good brotherhood. They look after each other." [...] As in the novels, Tyrion is (unfairly) found guilty of Joffrey's murder and condemned to death; the HBO series does not use the reveal that his first wife was not really a prostitute to motivate Tyrion to kill his father, and he does not lie to Jaime that he is guilty of killing Joffrey.|$|E
500|$|... "We {{did a lot}} of work on {{character}} and set-up, and then kept changing the set up while we were doing the animation," [...] Hui noted. [...] "In Antz, we had a facial system that gave us all the facial muscles under the skin. In Shrek, we applied that to whole body. So, if you pay attention to Shrek when he talks, <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> when he opens his jaw, he forms a double chin, because we have the fat and the muscles underneath. That kind of detail took us {{a long time to get}} right." [...] One of the most difficult parts of creating the film was making Donkey's fur flow smoothly so that it didn't look like that of a Chia Pet. This fell into the hands of the surfacing animators who used flow controls within a complex shader to provide the fur with many attributes (ability to change directions, lie flat, swirl, etc.). It was then the job of the visual effects group, led by Ken Bielenberg, to make the fur react to environment conditions. Once the technology was mastered, it was able to be applied to many aspects of the Shrek movie including grass, moss, beards, eyebrows, and even threads on Shrek's tunic. Making human hair realistic was different from Donkey's fur, requiring a separate rendering system and a lot of attention from the lighting and visual effects teams.|$|E

And again he made his shrugging motion. [...] "She does it all, really. The others--they are nothing--what they are Madame has made them. And now they think they've done it all, <b>you</b> <b>see.</b> <b>You</b> <b>see,</b> <b>that's</b> it." ...|$|R

500|$|Because rehearsals did {{not start}} until October 1874 and lasted longer than anticipated, the premiere was delayed. The final rehearsals went well, and in a {{generally}} optimistic mood the first night was fixed for 3 March 1875, the day on which, coincidentally, Bizet's appointment as a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour was formally announced. The premiere, which was conducted by Adolphe Deloffre, was attended by many of Paris's leading musical figures, including Massenet, Offenbach, Delibes and Gounod; during the performance the last-named was overheard complaining bitterly that Bizet had stolen the music of Micaëla's act 3 aria from him: [...] "That melody is mine!" [...] Halévy recorded his impressions of the premiere {{in a letter to}} a friend; the first act was evidently well received, with applause for the main numbers and numerous curtain calls. The first part of act 2 also went well, but after the toreador's song there was, Halévy noted, [...] "coldness". In act 3 only Micaëla's aria earned applause as the audience became increasingly disconcerted. The final act was [...] "glacial from first to last", and Bizet was left [...] "only with the consolations of a few friends". The critic Ernest Newman wrote later that the sentimentalist Opéra-Comique audience was [...] "shocked by the drastic realism of the action" [...] and by the low standing and defective morality of most of the characters. According to the composer Benjamin Godard, Bizet retorted, in response to a compliment, [...] "Don't <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> all these bourgeois have not understood a wretched word of the work I have written for them?" [...] In a different vein, shortly after the work had concluded, Massenet sent Bizet a congratulatory note: [...] "How happy you must be at this time—it's a great success!".|$|E

6000|$|... ‘The jewels,’ I replied. ‘Ah, sir, had <b>you</b> <b>seen</b> <b>that</b> treasure, {{sapphire}} and emerald and opal, and {{the golden}} topaz, and rubies red as the sunset—of what incalculable worth, of what unequalled beauty to the eye!—had <b>you</b> <b>seen</b> it, as I have, and alas! as she has—you would understand and tremble at your danger.’ ...|$|R
