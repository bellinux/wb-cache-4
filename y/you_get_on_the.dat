500|$|Canada {{entered the}} final facing {{pressure}} {{to defeat the}} Soviets. [...] The Soviet national team's easy victory over the National Hockey League's all-stars in the 1979 Challenge Cup left the Canadians searching to regain command of their rivalry with the Soviets. [...] Coach Scotty Bowman called it a [...] "must win game" [...] for Canada: [...] "We really are favorites in the final. [...] Nobody in this country will tolerate a loss." [...] The players also spoke of their desire to show the Soviets {{that they were the}} world's top hockey nation. During their pre-game preparations, Tikhonov called upon his team to play the finest games of their lives: [...] "Today you got to play so well that the entire Canadian population will talk about you afterwards and remember you for a long time. [...] Play so well that the Canadian fans when they will leave Forum will wait for you when <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bus after the game and admire you." ...|$|E
500|$|Shelley (Daily Mail) {{regularly}} spoke negatively of {{the character}} and wrote, [...] "The most eccentric member of the Carter clan may dress like a female version of Compo from Last of The Summer Wine but she acts like the meanest con in Prisoner Cell Block H." [...] He added that the characters of Babe, Sylvie and Stan are [...] "unremittingly grim and unappealing", but Babe was namingly [...] "gratuitously vile". Shelley was pleased when Babe left in May 2015 and said [...] "the last thing anyone wanted was {{for her to come}} back" [...] when discussing her return in September 2015. Laura Morgan of Digital Spy praised Babe's introduction, writing that her addition [...] "worked beautifully". Sally Brockway, writing for magazine Soaplife, wrote, [...] "She may rustle up a mean trifle, but you'll pay the price if <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wrong side of Aunt Babe Smith." [...] Ellis (Inside Soap) said, [...] "Of all the villains in Walford, we never would have thought that a trifle-making, Reliant-Robin-driving, apron-wearing aunt {{would turn out to be}} the most fearsome! She may not have the brute force of Phil Mitchell or the steely determination of Gavin Sullivan, but Babe is not someone we'd ever want to do battle with." [...] A reporter from Soaplife noted that [...] " [...] Babe's own desperation that makes her the monster of the woman she is..." ...|$|E
2500|$|Felt was {{publicly}} {{optimistic about}} the American intervention, declaring at a 1963 press conference that the war could be won in three years. He bristled at {{members of the press}} who did not seem sufficiently enthusiastic about ongoing American military operations. Introduced to Associated Press correspondent Malcolm W. Browne at a Saigon press conference, Felt growled, [...] "So you're Browne. Why don't <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> team?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They've got the scent," [...] said Maggot when out of earshot; [...] "but we'll do 'em yet. Whenever <b>thee</b> <b>gets</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> leeside o' that hedge, John, do 'ee clap on all {{sail for}} Balaswidden, where {{the boys are}} waitin', an' tell 'em {{to be ready for}} a call.

6000|$|... "Now <b>you</b> {{had better}} <b>get</b> {{over to your}} corner and grind that lot out, Chetwode," [...] he said pleasantly. [...] "How are <b>you</b> <b>getting</b> <b>on</b> with <b>the</b> typing, eh?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then why didn't <b>you</b> <b>get</b> out <b>on</b> <b>the</b> gun, Steve?" [...] {{was the old}} gunner's dry response; and {{the second}} gun captain said no more.|$|R
6000|$|... "By heavens! I shall go to Wajo!" [...] he cried, and a {{semicircle}} of heads nodded grave approbation while a slightly ironical voice said deliberately--"You are a made man, Tom, if <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{right side of}} that Rajah of yours." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'And it's so too. There ain't a {{book that}} begins with it. It lays over 'em all, Peters.

6000|$|... "You {{ought to}} marry a man who worships you," [...] he said; [...] "then you could do as you liked with him. Plenty of men will worship you, if <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> private side of their natures. You ought to marry one such. They would never fight you off." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, all right. As he didn't {{spend any}} of it, it doesn't much matter. Not that it's much catch having a thief roaming at large about the house. Anyhow, what {{put you on}} to him?

6000|$|... "That is {{not exactly}} what will be done, {{although}} it amounts to much the same thing.

But if <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right side of Jenny Wren and ask her to keep a secret, she'll do it. No one knows how to keep a secret better than she does.|$|E
6000|$|However, we {{all turned}} {{out into the}} open road which leads across the plain and down the Main valley, in the {{direction}} of Mayence. For the first ten miles or so, it is a dusty level. The surface is perfect; but 'twas a blinding white thread. As I toiled along it, that broiling June day, I could hear the voice of my backer, who followed on horseback, exhorting me in loud tones, 'Don't scorch, miss; don't scorch; never mind ef you lose sight of 'em. Keep your wind; that's the point. The wind, the wind's everything. Let 'em beat you on the level; you'll catch 'em up fast enough when <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Taunus!' ...|$|E

When the train comes in, he waits for all other passengers to get on board, then, as the train pulls out, he rushes forward and catches on the last car. At the same time one of the other fellows rushes out as if to catch him, but he is too late.
