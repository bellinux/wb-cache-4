Rolling Stone published an article in which Madonna advocated [...] "intense personal exploration" [...] over drug use. While being asked if [...] "Devil Pray" [...] could run the risk of being misunderstood as a song encouraging drugs, Madonna replied: [...] "I'm certainly not judging people who take drugs or saying 'don't do drugs', however, I'm saying <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>all</b> of these things to connect to a higher level, but ultimately you're going to be lost. People who are getting high are instinctively also trying to connect to a higher level of consciousness, but are doing {{it in a way that}} will not sustain them." ...|$|E
500|$|Clarkson has {{cited the}} color red as the album's only theme. A color {{traditionally}} associated with Christmas, she affiliated the color to various emotions in the holidays. Wanting to stray {{away from her}} usual pop sound, she described Wrapped in Reds music as a representation to explore different genres such as jazz, country and Memphis soul. She recalled: [...] "What's cool about Christmas albums is you can do jazz, rock and roll, you can do pop, you can do blues, like <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>all</b> that stuff and it works—cause it's all classic and it's Christmasy sounding." [...] She {{also noted that the}} album's multitude of styles positively contributed to her artistic goal, saying: [...] "My best friend from childhood heard it and said, 'This is what you sound like, before everything else.' And I agree, It's my core sound. Back in the day, when artists came out with things like [...] "Fall to Pieces" [...] and [...] "Bridge over Troubled Water", those songs transcended genres. It wasn't, 'Where is it going to fit?' You catered to whatever the song calls for. And that's exactly what I did—without having to have an umbrella for everything." ...|$|E

5000|$|Then-guitarist Marc Ford concurred with Colt's sentiment, {{adding that}} the {{atmosphere}} created by recording in a house fostered his musical relationship with Rich Robinson. [...] "It just keeps flowering," [...] he noted in 1996.

Mark Smith, of techno-duo Garland writes about the language: [...] "By entering the name of a sound, drawing your own bars and typing notes with numbers, you can make simple beats and melodies almost immediately. If you memorise a few different command lines a broad range of modulations and structural changes becomes possible. Whatever simple information you entered beforehand becomes hugely pliable - and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>all</b> this to your own uploaded bank of samples. Given that just about anyone can get up and running with a few minutes, those who are willing to put their time into live coding software like ixi lang can reach highly intuitive and fluid levels of improvised composition" ...|$|E
5000|$|Philip {{has said}} that a main theme of Survivors is [...] "fitting in", as Lucky is a Lone Dog at heart and feels {{out of place in}} his Leashed Pack. Philip says that the theme is {{especially}} relevant to many of the young readers, who are trying to find [...] "their own place in the world {{and at the same time}} keeping hold of their new identity". Philip has also said that an advantage of writing stories is that [...] "you can do all the romance and war and friendship and loyalty. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>all</b> that human stuff through animals." [...] Philip {{has said that}} an advantage of writing about dogs is that they [...] "are so much less self-reliant than cats", which she believes will [...] "make for some good stories". Another main theme of the series is the complex canine pack structure that is different, but is also familiar to a human family.|$|E
5000|$|Michael was {{featured}} on the Season 3 premiere of [...] "Penn & Teller: Fool Us" [...] on The CW, hosted by Alyson Hannigan. He performed the Multiplying Martini Bottles and did not fool Penn & Teller. Penn Jillette said of Michael's performance: [...] I wanna really address something important here that there's this view that laypeople have, and I think even some magicians have, that real technical skill - sleight of hand skill - is cards or coins, small stuff you manipulate, and you can palm; <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>all</b> this. With apparatus magic, they often think that the props are doing the trick. I {{want people to know}} how hard this is to do. It's a really hard thing to handle. The speed that you do that; the clarity, the cleanness...not only are you- obviously you're funny, but everybody knows that. And obviously you're likeable, everybody knows that. But what they may not know is just handling those props -- if you told somebody, 'Here are the props, here's how it's done, here are the secrets,' they would still stumble through it for months. And you just have a beautiful presentation. [...] "Penn & Teller: Fool Us" [...] Ep. 304 ...|$|E
5000|$|Later {{on in the}} song, T-Pain takes a {{line from}} the single by Unk, [...] "Walk It Out" [...] when he says, [...] "...Walk it out."

5000|$|Vedder took {{inspiration}} from the 1999 WTO protests in Seattle, Washington when writing [...] "Grievance". When speaking about [...] "Grievance" [...] in an interview, Vedder stated:I think technology went wrong somewhere. It just went into the wrong direction. Instead of helping us and freeing us, it seems to enslave us. That's what I talk about in [...] "Grievance", about the dangers and {{what a lot of}} people don't see or don't want to see.
