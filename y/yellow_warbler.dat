25|$|The 2-mm-long coffee borer beetle (Hypothenemus hampei) is {{the most}} {{damaging}} insect pest to the world's coffee industry, destroying up to 50 {{percent or more of}} the coffee berries on plantations in most coffee-producing countries. The adult female beetle nibbles a single tiny hole in a coffee berry and lays 35 to 50 eggs. Inside, the offspring grow, mate, and then emerge from the commercially ruined berry to disperse, repeating the cycle. Pesticides are mostly ineffective because the beetle juveniles are protected inside the berry nurseries, but they are vulnerable to predation by birds when they emerge. When groves of trees are nearby, the American <b>yellow</b> <b>warbler,</b> rufous-capped warbler, and other insectivorous birds have been shown to reduce by 50 percent the number of coffee berry borers in Costa Rica coffee plantations.|$|E
25|$|In the Caribbean 600 {{species of}} birds have been {{recorded}} of which 163 are endemic such as the tody, Fernandina's flicker and palmchat. The American <b>yellow</b> <b>warbler</b> is found in many areas as is the green heron. Of the endemic species 48 are threatened with extinction including the Puerto Rican amazon, yellow-breasted crake and the Zapata wren. According to Birdlife International in 2006 in Cuba 29 species of bird {{are in danger of}} extinction and two species officially extinct. The black-fronted piping guan is endangered as is the plain pigeon. The Antilles along with Central America lie in the flight path of migrating birds from North America so the size of populations is subject to seasonal fluctuations. In the forests are found parrots, bananaquit and toucans. Over the open sea can be seen frigatebirds and tropicbirds.|$|E

50|$|An {{analysis}} {{of the distribution of}} Taiwan’s 17 endemic bird species, using data from bird surveys conducted from 1993 to 2004, classified the firecrest as uncommon (along with the Formosan magpie, Taiwan bush <b>warbler,</b> <b>yellow</b> tit and Taiwan barwing). It found that the flamecrest occurred in high- and mid-altitude coniferous forests, and in high-altitude broad-leaved mixed forests, mainly at 2000-3600 m above sea level. The sites where it was recorded had an average altitude of about 2550 m, the highest of all the endemic birds. Its habitats had the coldest mean temperature and lowest warmth index of all 17 endemics, as well as the highest annual rainfall for the five uncommon species, though its distribution regarding vegetation and human disturbance was {{similar to those of the}} others.|$|R

5000|$|This is a mid-sized New World warbler, {{though it}} is one of the largest species in the Setophaga genus (formerly Dendroica) which {{comprises}} a lion's share of the species in the family. In total length, the species can range from 12 to 15 cm long, with a wingspan of 19 to 24 cm. Body mass can vary from 9.9 to 17.7 g, though averages between 11 and 14 g. Among standard measurements, the wing chord is 6.3 to 8.4 cm, the tail is 5 to 6.6 cm, the bill is 0.8 to 1.1 cm and the tarsus is 1.8 to 2.2 cm. In summers, males of both forms have streaked backs of black on slate blue, white wing patches, a streaked breast, and conspicuous yellow patches on the crown, flank, and rump (the latter giving rise to the species's nickname [...] "butterbutt" [...] among birdwatchers). Audubon's warbler also sports a yellow throat patch, while the myrtle warbler has a white throat and eye stripe, and a contrasting black cheek patch. Females of both forms are more dull, with brown streaking front and back, but still have noticeable <b>yellow</b> rumps. Goldman's <b>warbler,</b> of Guatemala, resembles Audubon's but has a white lower border to the yellow throat and otherwise darker plumage; males replace the slate blue of Audubon's with black.|$|R

40|$|Having {{valuable}} high-quality stopover sites {{available for}} migratory birds {{is one of}} the [...] key factors for the success of migration. However, beside the conservation of breeding [...] and wintering grounds, the actual protection of valuable stopover sites has often been [...] somewhat neglected. Overall 93 of 315 passerine species along the East-Asian [...] Australasian Flyway (EEAF) are declining. That’s the highest overall number of [...] threatened passerines on any known flyway. Additionally, the high human density in [...] South-East Asia and the ongoing degradation of natural resources further poses a [...] serious problem and threat to migratory songbirds and necessitates urgent action. [...] This study aims to identify valuable areas for migratory songbirds along the vast EAAF [...] (China, Japan, Korea, Far Eastern Russia and Alaska) and to develop a first approach [...] for Strategic Conservation Planning. The main methodological framework encompasses [...] predictive modeling (TreeNet, stochastic gradient boosting) and the Strategic [...] Conservation Planning Tool ‘Marxan’. [...] Overall, six models were created by using mistnet data (fall migration) of five selected [...] index species (Arctic <b>Warbler,</b> <b>Yellow</b> Wagtail, Bluethroat, Siberian Rubythroat & Black- [...] faced Bunting) as well as a by developing a ‘Species Richness Index’ (songbirds) and [...] choosing widely used predictive environmental layers. [...] In northern Russia and Alaska, most contiguous areas with a high index of occurrence [...] are concentrated on the coastline of the Pacific Rim with smaller patterns in the interior [...] and differences between their extents. In central-east Asia contiguous areas were [...] found along the coastline stretching deeper inland than for the other regions. For the [...] ‘Species Richness Index’, valuable areas were mostly predicted for the areas along the [...] border of China and Russia, and comprise large parts of the Manchurian forest [...] (deciduous).
