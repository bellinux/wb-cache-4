500|$|Designed by Bolliger & Mabillard, {{the steel}} track of Nitro is {{approximately}} [...] long, and {{the height of}} the lift is [...] high. The roller coaster also features five inversions. The track is painted red with <b>yellow</b> <b>rails</b> and blue supports.|$|R
50|$|As {{the ride}} had gotten rough {{with age and}} wasn't {{particularly}} smooth anymore, it made a good conversion candidate to improve the experience in the space constrained park. At the time of closing, on September 5, 2016, the coaster had a paint scheme of purple track with <b>yellow</b> <b>rails</b> and gray supports.|$|R
500|$|The steel {{track of}} Goliath is {{approximately}} [...] long, and {{the height of}} the lift is [...] high. It is made up of 150 foundations, 300 pilings, 106 supports, and 850 anchor bolts. The roller coasters has no inversions though it does feature seven camelback hills. The track is painted red with <b>yellow</b> <b>rails</b> while the supports are painted blue. It was manufactured by Clermont Steel Fabricators located in Batavia, Ohio.|$|R
50|$|Aspen Lake {{is also a}} {{good spot}} for bird-watching, {{reportedly}} one of the areas where the rare <b>yellow</b> <b>rail</b> has nested.|$|E
50|$|The {{wetlands}} {{that surround}} the bay support a variety of fauna. Notable terrestrial species include the American alligator and the bobcat, while bird species include the <b>yellow</b> <b>rail,</b> purple gallinule, and pelican.|$|E
50|$|The <b>yellow</b> <b>rail</b> feeds {{primarily}} on small invertebrates and compliments its diet with plant seeds. Beetles (Coleoptera) {{account for the}} highest proportion of the birds' diet, followed by spiders (Araneae) and snails (Gastropods), whereas plant matter is dominated by sedges (Cyperaceae) and rushes (Juncaceae).|$|E
5|$|As {{its name}} suggests, Superman: Ultimate Flight is themed after DC Comics' Superman character. The {{track of all}} three rides is red, with <b>yellow</b> <b>rails</b> and blue supports. The rides' queues are {{contained}} within each ride's footprint and contain various elements of Superman theming. The installations at Six Flags Great America and Six Flag Great Adventure have dedicated gift shops near the ride's exit that sell a variety of DC Comics merchandise.|$|R
50|$|The steel {{track of}} Goliath is {{approximately}} 4038.8 ft long, and {{the height of}} the lift is 174.8 ft high. It is made up of 150 foundations, 300 pilings, 106 supports, and 850 anchor bolts. The roller coasters has no inversions though it does feature seven camelback hills.

50|$|The Nature Conservancy, {{a nonprofit}} {{organization}} that owns most of the Sycan Marsh and some of the surrounding forest, offers self-guided automobile tours of the marsh. No hunting, fishing, camping, or pets are allowed in the preserve, which has no services and few opportunities for hiking. However, the marsh, attracting thousands of migrating tundra swans, sandhill cranes, <b>yellow</b> <b>rails,</b> black tern, white-faced ibises, and other species, offers opportunities for bird-watching. Access to the preserve is by unpaved forest roads.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>yellow</b> <b>rail</b> {{are very}} elusive and seldom seen. They {{generally}} {{call at night}} resembling the sound of two stones being clicked together [...] "tik-tik tik-tik-tik" [...] in repetition. When approached, {{they are more likely}} to rely on camouflage and escaping on foot through dense vegetation, rather than flushing.|$|E
50|$|Southeast of {{the city}} of Anahuac is the Anahuac National Wildlife Refuge which is popular among birdwatchers because almost 250 species of birds (see {{external}} link) have been reported there. Anahuac NWR is home to several species of marsh birds called rails including <b>yellow</b> <b>rail,</b> clapper rail and black rail.|$|E
50|$|Further {{from the}} core on the {{northeast}} side of the bay sits the Anahuac National Wildlife Refuge, a 34000 acre federal nature preserve. The coastal habitats in the park offer opportunities for viewing species ranging from the American alligator and bobcat to bird species such as the fulvous whistling-duck and the <b>yellow</b> <b>rail.</b>|$|E
50|$|The ride {{is located}} {{at the front of the}} park in the Ghosttown area, {{although}} the theme of the coaster doesn't match the rest of the park section. The single blue train rides on orange and <b>yellow</b> <b>rails</b> held by blue (formerly green) structural supports. The coaster features a single loop and a double corkscrew. The actual ride time is very short, as the roller coaster completes the 1,565 foot run in approximately 37 seconds. The ride only has the ability to run one 28 seat train due to lack of block brakes/sections.|$|R

5|$|While some Batman: The Ride clones {{opened with}} dark blue track and supports, others {{featured}} gray and yellow. Over the years {{there have been}} modifications in Batman: The Ride color schemes, with more incorporating yellows, blues, and purples. The original ride at Six Flags Great America retained the original black color scheme until 2004, when the track was painted yellow, and supports dark purple. Six Flags Great Adventure's originally featured a black color scheme with <b>yellow</b> <b>rails</b> until 2004, when the track was repainted yellow. For the 2010 season, the clone at Six Flags Magic Mountain was repainted medium blue with black supports.|$|R
50|$|The Malbaie River in the Gasp√© Peninsula empties {{into the}} Baie de la Malbaie on the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. A barachois has formed {{at the mouth}} of the river, while the salt marshes there are home to <b>yellow</b> <b>rail</b> and Nelson's sharp-tailed sparrow. The river also {{provides}} spawning habitat for Atlantic salmon. The Nature Conservancy of Canada has initiated a project to protect the area.|$|E
50|$|The {{wetlands}} {{are extremely}} important for birds, both year-round inhabitants and migrating waterfowl. Close to 200 species inhabit the wetlands, including some endemic {{species such as}} the black-polled yellowthroat (Geothlypis speciosa). Two native species have not been observed recently; the <b>yellow</b> <b>rail</b> (Coturnicops noveboracensis) {{has not been seen}} since 1964 and may be locally extinct, and the endemic slender-billed grackle (Quiscalus palustris) is presumed extinct. The Lake Patzcuaro salamander (Ambystoma dumerilii) is endemic to the basin.|$|E
50|$|The {{entire area}} {{was covered by}} ice during the last glaciation, and the peatlands have {{accumulated}} over the last ten thousand years. Plants from more temperate regions mix with arctic species. A majority of the wetland is peat bog, although salt marshes occur along the coast, and marshes and wet meadows occur along the major rivers. The wetlands provide important habitat for migratory birds including shorebirds (e.g., <b>yellow</b> <b>rail)</b> and waterfowl (e.g., snow geese). Large mammals include polar bear and wolverine.|$|E

These include common nighthawk, grizzly bear, olive-sided flycatcher, peregrine falcon, rusty blackbird, short-eared owl, wood bison, woodland caribou, wolverine and <b>yellow</b> <b>rail.</b> In addition the bull trout (Dolly Varden) and the Nahanni aster are listed but without a status and the Canada warbler and western toad are listed as possibly existing in the park.|$|E
50|$|Klamath Marsh National Wildlife Refuge was {{established}} in 1958 as an inviolate sanctuary, or for any other management purpose, for migratory birds. The refuge primarily consists of 40,000 acres. Originally designated as Klamath Forest National Wildlife Refuge, the Refuge was renamed as {{virtually all of the}} historic Klamath Marsh now lies within Refuge boundaries. This large natural marsh provides important nesting, feeding, and resting habitat for waterfowl, while the surrounding meadowlands are attractive nesting and feeding areas for sandhill crane, <b>yellow</b> <b>rail,</b> and various shorebirds and raptors. The adjacent pine forests also support diverse wildlife including the great gray owl and Rocky Mountain elk. During summer months, opportunities to canoe in Wocus Bay allow for wildlife observation and a great scenic route.|$|E
5000|$|The {{proposal}} {{is studying the}} impact the new roadway will have on protected species of fauna in Saskatchewan such as the burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia), loggerhead shrike (Lanius ludovicianus), Sprague's pipit {Anthus spragueii}, peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), <b>yellow</b> <b>rail</b> (Coturnicops noveboracensis), monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) and northern leopard frog (Rana pipiens). Flora of Saskatchewan which may be impacted would be the prairie ragwort (Senecio plattensis) and Geyer's onion (Allium geyeri). The Presbyterian Indian Residential School Cemetery is also located in this vicinity north of Dewdney Avenue and east of Pinkie Road. [...] The project is being planned to meet any requirements set forth under the Building Canada Plan as well as evaluation of project procedures for environmental concerns as set out by the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act.|$|E

40|$|Rails (Family: Rallidae) {{are among}} the least studied birds in North America, in large part due to their elusive nature. As a wetland-dependent species, {{understanding}} the timing of their migration and their habitat needs during migration is especially important since management needs to be timed to balance the needs of many species. I developed and verified a new distance sampling based nocturnal ATV spotlight survey because traditional call-broadcast surveys are not effective during autumn migration because of the drop off in call rate after the breeding season. These surveys allow us to ask point-level questions about what habitats rails select during migration and how it changes over time. Through these standardized surveys from 2012 - 2016 across 11 public properties in Missouri, USA, I documented the migratory timing and habitat use of migratory rails. Sora (Porzana carolina) have a wide migratory window, beginning in early August and continuing {{through the end of}} October with a peak in late September. Virginia Rail (Rallus limicola) and <b>Yellow</b> <b>Rails</b> (Coturnicops noveboracensis) have shorter migratory periods, from late September through the end of October. Rails, especially Sora, migrate earlier than waterfowl, which can create a mismatch of habitat needs. We performed a 3 year experiment to examine the response of Sora and waterfowl to early autumn wetland flooding. Sora responded positively without a negative impact on waterfowl. I used monitoring data to create species distribution models to inform estimates of migratory connectivity for all three species using stable hydrogen isotopes. Sora and <b>Yellow</b> <b>Rails</b> were estimated to migrate generally north-south, with Virginia Rails coming from a wider east-west range. Through better understanding the migratory connectivity, timing and habitat use of rails in the autumn I provide a foundation to inform conservation and management of these fascinating and elusive birds. We provide a description of all variables used (Appendix II), GPS data of survey tracks and detection points (Appendix III), data sets of bird observation points, survey data, and vegetation information (Appendix IV), data sets of stable hydrogen isotope data (Appendix V), data sets of species distribution models (Appendix VI) ...|$|R
