6000|$|... "I'm very sorry,--it {{was only}} fun; and I {{thought it would}} help <b>you</b> <b>both,</b> <b>for</b> how the deuce should I know you liked the man when you said you hated him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Walter!" [...] she said, [...] "I once parted <b>you</b> <b>both,</b> <b>for</b> {{your good}} and for hers. Wait here, my brother!--wait, my dearest, best friend, till Laura comes, and {{tells you what}} I have done now!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{shall have}} to ask <b>you</b> <b>both</b> <b>for</b> your names and addresses," [...] the {{official}} continued. [...] "I think I won't ask you any more questions at present. Seems to me headquarters had better take this on." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Admit it!” {{repeated}} the agitated Judge; “I here give thee {{a right to}} shoot deer, or bears, or anything thou pleasest in my woods, forever. Leather-Stocking is the only other man that I have granted the same privilege to; {{and the time is}} coming when it will be of value. But I buy your deer—here, this bill will pay <b>thee,</b> <b>both</b> <b>for</b> thy shot and my own.” ...|$|R
60|$|I am so glad Susy {{has gone}} on that trip and that you are trying the electric. May <b>you</b> <b>both</b> prosper. <b>For</b> <b>you</b> are mighty dear to me and in my {{thoughts}} always.|$|R
6000|$|... "Are <b>you</b> <b>both</b> ready <b>for</b> service again?" [...] the Count de la Noue, who {{had sent}} {{for them to}} come to his lodgings, asked on the evening of the third day after the capture of Orleans.|$|R
6000|$|... "The saints forfend!" [...] {{said the}} knight. [...] "Y' are speedy, but not sly. Ye would blunder me headforemost into John Amend-All's camp. I thank <b>you</b> <b>both</b> <b>for</b> your good courage; but, in sooth, {{it may not}} be." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm much {{obliged to}} <b>you</b> <b>both</b> <b>for</b> warning me that I am {{so easy to}} deceive," [...] the General remarked satirically. [...] "Unfortunately, the {{mischief}} is done. Three men have answered my advertisement already. I expect them here tomorrow to be examined for the place." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank <b>you</b> <b>both</b> <b>for</b> the welcome," [...] {{said the}} visitor with a {{pleasant}} smile, as he {{shook hands with}} Mrs Roby. [...] "I thought I recognised your voice, Captain Wopper, as you passed Mrs Leven's door, and came out {{to see how you}} and my old friend here get on together." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I thank <b>thee,</b> Ada, <b>both</b> <b>for</b> the {{dressing}} {{and the good}} wish," [...] said Glumm gravely, as he rose {{and walked into the}} hall, followed by his persevering and insatiable little friend.|$|R
6000|$|... "See you then, Jacques," [...] said Madame Defarge, wrathfully; [...] "and see you, too, {{my little}} Vengeance; see <b>you</b> <b>both!</b> Listen! <b>For</b> other crimes as tyrants and oppressors, I have this race {{a long time}} on my register, doomed to {{destruction}} and extermination. Ask my husband, is that so." ...|$|R
60|$|Cyd. I'll strait descend; Heaven did <b>you</b> here <b>for</b> <b>both</b> our safeties send.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{promised the}} both of you to give you an answer to-day. I've been {{thinking}} and thinking and thinking, till I began to get angry with <b>you</b> <b>both</b> <b>for</b> plaguing me so; and even now I don't seem any nearer than ever I was to making up my mind.' Eric said suddenly: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A wire {{signed with}} your name? They knew enough of <b>you</b> <b>both</b> <b>for</b> that. They weren't sure {{of how much}} you had learnt in that house. Their {{kidnapping}} of Miss Tuppence is the counter-move to your escape. If necessary they could seal your lips with a threat of {{what might happen to}} her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That I {{swear to}} be," [...] Fergus said, as he stooped and kissed her. [...] "I feel how great is the boon {{that you have}} given me; and shall, to my life's end, be deeply thankful to <b>you</b> <b>both</b> <b>for</b> the {{confidence}} which you have placed in me, in thus intrusting her to my care.|$|E
6000|$|... "What ails thee, young One? what? Why pull so at thy cord? [...] Is it {{not well}} with <b>thee?</b> well <b>both</b> <b>for</b> bed and board? [...] Thy plot of grass is soft, and green as grass can be; [...] Rest, little young One, rest; what is't that aileth thee? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will have}} no threats; you are powerless, as you very well know. Let things remain as they are or, by God! <b>you</b> shall <b>both</b> suffer <b>for</b> it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well, then, that is settled. In {{the second}} place, {{tell me if}} I am right. <b>You</b> are <b>both</b> wanted <b>for</b> {{stealing}} sixteen horses over {{at a place called}} Kepples." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘You don’t know, sir, yet, what a {{complete}} understanding can exist between {{my sister and}} me, though no spoken word—perhaps hardly {{as much as a}} look—may have passed between us. She not only feels as I have described, but she very well knows that I am taking this opportunity of speaking to <b>you,</b> <b>both</b> <b>for</b> her and for myself.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|Esmond {{raised his}} hand. [...] "Then I arrest <b>you</b> <b>both</b> <b>for</b> concealing Prospector Tomlinson and contriving his escape. You will hand {{them over to}} Robertson at the outpost, Trooper Grieve, and then come on after us {{as fast as you}} can. I don't wish to submit either of you to any indignity, Leger, unless you are likely to make it necessary." ...|$|E
60|$|Alv. What {{interest}} can I have, or what delight, To blaze their shame, or {{to divulge}} my own? If proved, you hate me; if unproved, condemn. Not racks or tortures could have forced this secret, But too much care {{to save you}} from a crime, Which would have sunk <b>you</b> <b>both.</b> <b>For,</b> let me say, Almeyda's beauty well deserves your love.|$|E
60|$|Miss Fennimore was not gratified by her apt pupil's remark. 'If Phoebe's conduct do not fill <b>you</b> with reverence, <b>both</b> <b>for</b> her {{and that}} which actuates her, I can only stand astonished,' she said.|$|R
6000|$|... "Pooh!" [...] Frank said; [...] "diggers are {{constantly}} dreaming about lucky places--and no wonder, {{when they are}} always thinking about them. I consider it madness to keep on toiling here, even if your mate is ill. It is folly {{to give in to}} him in this way, and <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>both</b> to be half-starved when you can earn, at any rate, enough to keep <b>you</b> <b>both</b> by working <b>for</b> others." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Surely you {{can speak}} out to me, dearest! All I {{care about is}} your happiness. Both Lady Lufton and I {{think that it would}} be a happy {{marriage}} if <b>you</b> <b>both</b> cared <b>for</b> each other enough. She thinks that he is fond of you. But if he were ten times Lord Lufton I would not tease you about it if I thought that you could not learn to care about him. What was it you were going to say, my dear?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, sir, {{you will}} soon {{get used to}} me. Surely you and she must have had enough of shore people and their confounded half-and-half ways to last <b>you</b> <b>both</b> <b>for</b> a lifetime. A {{particularly}} merciful lot they are too. You ask Flora. I am alluding to my own sister, her best friend, and not a bad woman either as they go." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The boy {{is getting}} on wonderfully well," [...] the Rajah said {{one day to}} his sister. [...] "His {{exercises}} have given him so much nerve, and so steady a hand, that he already shoots very fairly. I should expect him to grow up into a fine man, Margaret, were it not that I have the gravest fears as to this mad enterprise, which I cannot help telling <b>you,</b> <b>both</b> <b>for</b> your good and his, is, in my opinion, absolutely hopeless." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Holmes," [...] said Athelney Jones, [...] "You are {{a man to}} be humored, and we {{all know}} that you are a {{connoisseur}} of crime, but duty is duty, and I have gone rather far in doing what you and your friend asked me. I shall feel more at ease when we have our story-teller here safe under lock and key. The cab still waits, and there are two inspectors down-stairs. I am much obliged to <b>you</b> <b>both</b> <b>for</b> your assistance. Of course you will be wanted at the trial. Good-night to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{knew how}} it would be!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "I leave <b>you</b> <b>both</b> alone <b>for</b> less than a minute, and there you sit, as grave as two owls. I ask you, now, is this the place to wander off into the clouds? When two people sit {{looking at each other}} as you were doing a minute ago, here in Luigi's, at midnight, with {{champagne}} in their glasses, and a supper, ordered regardless of expense, on the table before them, they are either without the least sense of the fitness of things, or else--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{been talking}} with the lad; and, on {{comparing}} his dreams with my dreams, his feelings with my feelings, and his wishes with my wishes, I fear we think too much alike consarning <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>both</b> of us to be very happy." ...|$|R
60|$|LARRY [unimpressed and hostile]. I didn't {{stand on}} {{ceremony}} with you: you needn't stand {{on it with}} me. Fine manners and fine words are cheap in Ireland: <b>you</b> can keep <b>both</b> <b>for</b> my friend here, who is still imposed on by them. I know their value.|$|R
6000|$|... "Pity I {{did not ask}} it, then, but I won't go back on my word. And {{now that}} I have got my terms I will tell you my reasons for making {{up my mind to}} go. First of all, gentlemen, I have been observing <b>you</b> <b>both</b> <b>for</b> the last few days, and if you will not think me impertinent I may say that I like you, and believe that we shall come up well to the yoke together. That is something, let me tell you, when one has a long journey like this before one.|$|E
6000|$|... "Consolation {{has come}} {{to me from the}} best of good women. Mrs. Staveley writes as lovingly as my mother might have written, if death had spared her. I have replied with all the {{gratitude}} that I really feel, but without taking advantage of the services which she offers. Mrs. Staveley has it in her mind, as you had it in your mind, to bring Philip back to me. Does she forget, do you forget, that Helena claims him? But you both mean kindly, and I love <b>you</b> <b>both</b> <b>for</b> the interest that you feel in me.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{need not}} {{ask you how}} you are, my boy," [...] Mr. Renshaw said as Wilfrid, who had leapt from his horse as Marion ran up, hastened forward {{with her to the}} house. [...] "Your mother has told us so much about your illness that I hardly {{anticipated}} seeing you looking a picture of health. Mr. Atherton, I am delighted to see you. My wife has told me how much we all owe to <b>you</b> <b>both</b> <b>for</b> your care of Wilfrid and for having brought him and my wife safely {{out of the hands of}} the natives." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh! I {{have ordered}} the chair round; it won't hurt {{me with the}} glasses up. Gillian, my dear, you must put on the white dress that Mrs. Grinstead's maid did up for you---it is quite simple, and I should like you to look nice! Well---oh, how tired <b>you</b> <b>both</b> look! Ring <b>for</b> some fresh tea, Gillian. Have you found a house?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "MY DEAR BROTHER, MY DEAR SISTER,--I {{write to}} <b>you</b> <b>both</b> at once, <b>for</b> want of time. I {{will follow the}} advice you are so good as give me; and will take leave of the Queen [our dear Mamma] by Letter. And that the reading of my Letter may not frighten her, I will send it by my Sister, to be {{presented}} in a favorable moment.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Well, my dears,' he went on, with {{a horrible}} grin, 'you need {{not tell me}} how you came here now, you will have plenty of time for that. We have made up our minds to take <b>you</b> <b>both</b> with us, <b>for</b> it's a horrible lonely life in the bush, without the {{pleasure}} of ladies' society. But I never dreamt that I was in for such a slice of luck as this.' ...|$|R
