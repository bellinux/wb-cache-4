[...] For each gradually varied flow transition, you must know both boundary conditions and <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>also</b> calculate length of that transition. [...] (e.g. For an M1 Profile, you must find the rise at the downstream boundary condition, the normal depth at the upstream boundary condition, and also the length of the transition.) [...] To find the length of the gradually varied flow transitions, iterate the “step length”, instead of height, at the boundary condition height until equations 4 and 5 agree. [...] (e.g. For an M1 Profile, position 1 would be the downstream condition and you would solve for position two where the height is equal to normal depth.) ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No," [...] she returned; and then, {{suddenly}} coming near, {{spoke in}} a low tone: [...] "I will go there to please you, and <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>also</b> do as I tell you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{certainly}} {{might have}} done so, but <b>you</b> <b>must</b> remember, <b>also,</b> that {{a great many of}} us might have been killed too. One cannot always expect to have the luck we had in those two fights; and, I am sure, we should bitterly regret gaps being made in our number." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is strange," [...] he said, [...] "since <b>you</b> <b>must</b> then believe <b>also</b> {{that you}} will come to a cruel death, which has terrors for the young and fair." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay," [...] said he, [...] "I have {{no right}} to claim it as my church. I fear <b>you</b> <b>must</b> regard me <b>also</b> as a heathen,--as you do George Roden." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Wix hesitated. [...] "He hates HER. Don't stoop so--lift up your hair. You {{know how}} I'm {{affected}} toward him," [...] she added with dignity; [...] "but <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>also</b> know that I see clear." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is most fitting," [...] she sobbed, [...] "that I {{should give}} you thanks who but for <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>also</b> have become 'a woman of the Assassins,' or an {{inhabitant}} of the House of Death." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And behold, {{the title}} fits a dweller {{on the earth}} whom <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>also</b> worship, for such omens do not come by chance," [...] cried the same voice, but from another quarter of the crowded hall.|$|E

And me <b>also</b> <b>you</b> <b>must</b> see--me <b>also</b> <b>you</b> <b>must</b> hear! Or I will first claim you for my own {{in the face of}} the world; and, having vindicated my rights, I will seek out and extinguish the wretched rival who has dared to interfere with them." ...|$|R

[...] he cried, [...] "I {{care not to}} have those pebbles about my ears, yet I cannot go back alone, so it is very clear, my crazy comrade, that <b>you</b> <b>must</b> come <b>also.</b> Now we are beyond their reach!

6000|$|... "Straight up {{and down}} is not bad," [...] said the frames, who ran that way in {{the sides of the}} ship, [...] "but <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>also</b> expand yourselves sideways. Expansion is the law of life, children. Open out! open out!" ...|$|E

"Then, as {{you have}} heard of that enigmatical personage, citoyenne, <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>also</b> have guessed, and know, {{that the man who}} hides his {{identity}} under that strange pseudonym, is the most bitter enemy of our republic, of France [...] . of men like Armand St. Just." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What pleases <b>you</b> <b>must</b> please me <b>also,</b> madame," [...] he answered, {{in a tone}} so {{cold that}} it belied his words. [...] "That it please you, is reason enough why you should marry... Whom did your Majesty say?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You're too amazing," [...] Vanderbank mused. His musing had {{presently}} {{the effect}} of making him rise; meditation indeed beset him after {{he was on his}} feet.

6000|$|... "We don't {{mind for}} ourselves," [...] said her aunt, {{stroking}} the little girl's head tenderly; [...] "but {{we love you}} {{as if you were}} our own child, and we are heart-broken to think that <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>also</b> endure poverty, and work for a living before you have grown big and strong." ...|$|E

40|$|As {{part of his}} {{farewell}} speeches, Jesus enjoined on {{his immediate}} collaborators the new commandment of love in these words: “My children, I am {{with you for a}} little while; you will look for me….

6000|$|... "You couldn't. You'd {{break your}} heart and die. And {{if you can imagine}} my living there, and pouring out Mr. Barry's tea for him, <b>you</b> <b>must</b> imagine <b>also</b> what I should have to say to myself about you. 'He will die, of course.

6000|$|... "But {{time has}} not proved the {{stability}} of their conceptions. And <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>also</b> view the other side. A superior people must look upon all others as inferior peoples. This comes home to you. To be a Roman were greater than to be a king, and when the Romans rubbed against your savage ancestors in the German forests, they elevated their brows and said, 'An inferior people, barbarians.'" ...|$|E

60|$|The {{fact that}} the table moved toward us and {{directly}} away from the psychic was in itself suspicious; but, {{as a matter of}} fact, at other sittings we obtained sidewise movements of the table--generally to the left. The present experiment did not stand alone. <b>You</b> <b>must</b> remember <b>also</b> that the table was at this time more than two feet from Mrs. Smiley's toes, her dress was tacked to the floor, and her ankles controlled by a tape whose ends were nailed to the floor four feet behind her chair.|$|R
