6000|$|... "You {{want to buy}} a slave!" [...] {{repeated}} Mr. Renfrew. [...] "What {{on earth}} do you {{want to buy a}} slave for? <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> you want now at the Orangery." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course it}} was," [...] assented the other, [...] "but {{that was long}} ago. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> repaid me since then ... when you had the means ... and now there is the picture...." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And haven't <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> your share, papa, with {{troubles}} in the office, {{and trying to}} find a trace of baby Howard?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You can't {{get out of}} me what is not in me. You can't wrest from me what I {{have not}} got. Mine is but a poor calling. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> two guineas from me, already. Do {{you know how long}} it has taken me (allowing for a long and arduous training) to earn such a sum?' ...|$|R
5000|$|If your allies win, you benefit {{whether or}} not <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> power <b>than</b> they <b>have.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "If you can {{but give}} as good {{an account of}} the bush rangers, we shall be indeed {{grateful}} to you. As it is, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> justified my selection of you for the post." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{the first}} place, your men are inexhaustible. If we kill one class you call out another; and anyway {{one-half}} {{of those we}} kill get well again, and {{the net result is}} that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> ever." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No such thing; a {{thousand}} or twelve hundred dollars would purchase the house, {{and all the}} land we can see--some twelve or fifteen acres, at the most. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> two thousand salted away, I know, Moses, between prize-money, wages, adventures, and other matters." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{had enough}} and I paid your debts not long since," [...] he said. [...] "In fact, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> your share, with the {{consequence}} that Grace gets less than hers." [...] He knitted his brows as he indicated the house-master's curt letter. [...] "Then, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> given a stranger {{an opportunity for}} writing to me like this." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, mother, don't be tiresome. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> sense <b>than</b> Janet. Her {{father was}} Vice-consul at Sant Ildefonso, {{one of the}} Antilles." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{problem with}} visual {{programming}} is that <b>you</b> can’t <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 50 visual primitives {{on the screen}} at the same time.|$|R
6000|$|... "Captain Parker," [...] he said, [...] "I wish, publicly, {{to thank}} you for your noble conduct this day. I have always said a surer support could never follow a {{commander-in-chief}} into battle; <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> proved my opinion to be true. I wish, publicly, {{to thank you}}, sir." ...|$|E
60|$|Have {{you seen}} Townshend's {{magnetic}} boy? You heard of him, no doubt, from Count D'Orsay. If {{you get him}} to Gore House, don't, I entreat <b>you,</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> eight people--four is a better number--to see him. He fails in a crowd, and is marvellous before a few.|$|E
60|$|What I {{want to know}} {{is whether}} your art (or {{whatever}} you call it) can get at my diseased mind, through my healthy body. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> once told me that medicine can do this. The time has come for doing it. I am in a bad way, and a bad end may follow. My only medical friend, deliver me from myself.|$|E
6000|$|Rod. [...] Truly, [...] My Lord, {{within this}} {{quarter of an}} hour [...] <b>You</b> <b>have</b> changed <b>more</b> <b>than</b> e'er I saw you change [...] In years.|$|R
6000|$|... "Pray--pray, my dear, don't talk so," [...] {{answered}} the weak, faltering voice of Mrs. Sherwin; [...] "you know <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> your year's allowance of dresses already." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have noticed}} the moral reform in several quarters. Didn't I tell <b>you</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>more</b> {{influence}} <b>than</b> any {{boys in the}} Coll. if you cared to use it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{sooner the}} better," [...] Burt said, with an oath. [...] "And look here, young man," [...] fixing Williams with his bloodshot eyes, [...] "one sign of drawing back, {{and by the}} living jingo I'll let <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> I'm keeping for him. You hear me, eh?" [...] He grasped the youth's white wrist and {{squeezed}} it in his iron grip until he writhed with the pain.|$|E
6000|$|... 'In {{that case}} we shall {{sit down and}} await his return. Ah, Monsieur de Meneval, how I pity you when I see you among all those papers! I was desolate when Monsieur de Bourrienne deserted the Emperor, but <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> taken his place. Come up to the fire, Madame de Remusat! Yes, yes, I insist upon it, for I know that you must be cold. Constant, come and put the rug under Madame de Remusat's feet.' ...|$|E
60|$|It {{will have}} been seen that the Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale embraces {{the entire length of}} the entire top of the head; and since--as has been {{elsewhere}} set forth--the head embraces one third of the whole length of the creature, then setting that length down at eighty feet for a good sized whale, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> twenty-six feet for the depth of the tun, when it is lengthwise hoisted up and down against a ship's side.|$|E
6000|$|... "Telephone me," [...] said Mr. Crewe, [...] "and if I can get off, I will. I'd {{like to talk}} to <b>you.</b> <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> sense <b>than</b> {{most women}} I know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! it {{does not}} signify," [...] said her ladyship in a tone almost of disappointment. [...] "I had {{forgotten}} it. Mr Gresham and <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>more</b> inconvenience <b>than</b> we had." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I believe," [...] he said {{as though}} {{there had been no}} pause in their conversation, [...] "that the man would be more than glad to find us gone when he returns. It is not {{necessary}} to jeopardize our lives for two more days in order that we may thank him, however much we may appreciate his services to us. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> balanced your obligations to him and from what he told me I feel that you especially should not remain here longer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are quite}} right," [...] {{the old man}} said heartily. [...] "You have done more than enough fighting, and there is no saying how long this war may drag on. I told you, when I first heard of your {{engagement}} to the young countess, that I was glad indeed that you were not always to remain a soldier of fortune; and I am sure that the king will consider that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> done your duty, by remaining in his service for a year, after having so splendid a prospect before you. Frederick is disengaged at present, and I will go over with you to him, and will myself open the matter." ...|$|E
60|$|I may, however, while expressing {{my thanks}} to the 'London Editor' for drawing my {{attention}} to this, I trust, purely American method of procedure, venture to differ from him {{in one of his}} criticisms. He states that he regards the expression 'complete' as applied to a story, as a specimen of the 'adjectival exuberance of the puffer.' Here, it seems to me, he sadly exaggerates. What my story is is an interesting problem. What my story is not is a 'novelette'--a term which <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> once applied to it. There is no such word in the English language as novelette. It should not be used. It is merely part of the slang of Fleet Street.|$|E
6000|$|... "You may {{do as you}} like, as far as I am concerned," [...] said Mrs. Jansenius. [...] "But I hope <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> sense <b>than</b> {{to throw}} away your {{education}} for nothing." ...|$|R
60|$|THE STATUE. You {{might as}} well have gone without {{thinking}} such a lot about it, Juan. You are like all the clever men: <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> brains <b>than</b> is good for you.|$|R
2500|$|Take no arms by day, or by night, {{from any}} man, as from such acts a deal of misfortune springs, <b>having,</b> I trust <b>you</b> <b>have,</b> <b>more</b> arms <b>than</b> <b>you</b> ever will <b>have</b> need for.|$|R
6000|$|... "Your Majesty," [...] he said, [...] "I {{will admit}} that I alone of those present here had some {{knowledge}} of this proposal. I hope that your Majesty will not look upon my presence here as disloyal or unseemly. Only in my heart is deep engraven {{the love of my}} country and her people, and the one dread of my life has been the coming of the Turk. Your Majesty, no one has been a more sincere admirer than myself of the wise and careful manner in which you have ruled this country. Young though you are, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> fulfilled our most sanguine expectations. Only I fear that unaided we may as well hope to stem the tide of the mighty Danube as repel this Turkish invasion." ...|$|E
6000|$|... § XXXV. Finally, {{as regards}} {{quantity}} of ornament I have already said, again and again, you cannot {{have too much}} if it be good; that is, if it be thoroughly united and harmonised by the laws hitherto insisted upon. But you may easily have too much if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> you have sense to manage. For with every added order of ornament increases the difficulty of discipline. It {{is exactly the same}} as in war: you cannot, as an abstract law, have too many soldiers, but you may easily have more than the country is able to sustain, or than your generalship is competent to command. And every regiment which you cannot manage will, on the day of battle, be in your way, and encumber the movements it is not in disposition to sustain.|$|E
6000|$|... "Signore," [...] {{returned}} Maso, earnestly {{and with}} more of gentle feeling than he was accustomed to betray, [...] "you are both liberal beyond my desires, and but too well disposed for my poor wants. I have {{come up to the}} castle at your order, and to do you pleasure, but not in the hope to get money. I am poor; that it would be useless to deny, for appearances are against me--" [...] here he laughed, his auditors thought in a manner that was forced--"but poverty and meanness are not always inseparable. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> suspected to-day that my life is free, and I admit it; but {{it is a mistake to}} believe that, because men quit the high-road which some call honesty, in any particular practice, they are without human feeling. I have been useful in saving your lives, Signori, and there is more pleasure in the reflection, than I should find in having the means to earn twice the gold ye offer. Here is the Signor Capitano," [...] he added, taking Sigismund by the arm, and dragging him forward, [...] "lavish your favors on him, for no practice of mine could have been of use without his bravery. If ye give him all in your treasuries, even to its richest pearl, ye will do no more than reason." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why?" [...] he asked, [...] "why? Sometimes I wish with {{my whole}} soul I could give it up. I've {{always said that}} <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>more</b> sense <b>than</b> most women, but even you could not understand." ...|$|R
