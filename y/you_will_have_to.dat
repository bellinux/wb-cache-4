25|$|The raised ranch is {{a two-story}} house, {{in which a}} {{finished}} basement serves as an additional floor. It may be built into a hill to some degree, such that the full size {{of the house is}} not evident from the curb. However, it does not become a raised ranch simply by having two floors. For it to be a raised ranch, <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> climb a flight of steps to get to the main living floor - if not it is just a bi-level house. Among real estate agents, this term is commonly misused.|$|E
25|$|The Transfer System on {{the other}} hand, was never popular with the racers. While very {{efficient}} and less error prone than the cumulative method (and allowing the ABA to run much quicker events with fewer finish line scores), the good racers generally did not like it since they would only get to race once, win their transfer moto and wait for hours if the races are big enough to race the mains ({{on the other}} hand you get to relax a little without the anxiety of doing poorly {{in the next two}} qualifying motos). This means the racers race less often in the ABA and the fun of BMX is in the racing, even if you are losing. Even racers who do not do well did not like the transfer system because the fewer actual races you are in, the less chance <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> improve your skills in actual race conditions You also race two times less for your money paid for in entrance fees in the ABA in the Transfer system if you win your first moto.|$|E

500|$|The trial {{commenced}} on 20 April 2015 at Lüneburg Regional Court (Landgericht). In {{an opening}} statement, Gröning asked for forgiveness for his mainly clerical role at Auschwitz {{in the summer}} of 1944, by saying: [...] "For me there's no question that I share moral guilt," [...] the 93-year-old told the judges, acknowledging that he knew about the gassing of Jews and other prisoners. [...] "I ask for forgiveness. I share morally in the guilt but whether I am guilty under criminal law, <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> decide." ...|$|E
500|$|Aside from music, {{association}} football {{played a}} major role throughout his life. As well as playing the game, in parking lots, fields, and even inside recording studios, growing up he followed the Brazilian club Santos and its star player Pelé. Marley surrounded himself with people from the sport, and in the 1970s made the Jamaican international footballer Allan [...] "Skill" [...] Cole his tour manager. He told a journalist, [...] "If you want to get to know me, <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> play football against me and the Wailers." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} twentieth century, DeLee {{observed}} that obstetric complications and deaths were so common that he [...] "often wondered whether nature did not intend women should be used up {{in the process of}} reproduction, in a manner analogous to that of the salmon, which dies after spawning. Perhaps laceration, prolapse and all the evils are, in fact, natural to labor and in fact normal... If you adopt this view, I have no ground to stand on, but, if you believe that a woman after delivery should be as healthy, as well as anatomically perfect as she was before, and that the child should be undamaged, then <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> agree with me that labor is pathogenic, because experience has proved such ideal results exceedingly rare." ...|$|E

500|$|The Group then {{agreed to}} produce and sell 60 JATO engines to the United States Army Air Corps. To do so they formed the Aerojet Engineering Corporation in March 1942, in which Parsons, Forman, Malina, von Kármán, and Summerfield each {{invested}} $250, opening their offices on Colorado Boulevard and bringing in Amo Smith as their engineer. Andrew G. Haley was recruited by von Kármán as their lawyer and treasurer. Although Aerojet was a for-profit operation that provided technology for military means, the founders' mentality was rooted in the ideal of using rockets for peaceful space exploration. As Haley recounted von Kármán requesting: [...] "we will make the rockets—you must make the corporation and obtain the money. Later on <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> see that we all behave well in outer space." ...|$|E
500|$|Zelda {{never became}} {{particularly}} domestic, nor showed {{any interest in}} housekeeping. By 1922, the Fitzgeralds had employed a nurse for their daughter, a couple to clean their house, and a laundress. When Harper & Brothers asked her to contribute to Favorite Recipes of Famous Women she wrote, [...] "See {{if there is any}} bacon, and if there is, ask the cook which pan to fry it in. Then ask if there are any eggs, and if so try and persuade the cook to poach two of them. It is better not to attempt toast, as it burns very easily. Also, in the case of bacon, do not turn the fire too high, or <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> {{get out of the house}} for a week. Serve preferably on china plates, though gold or wood will do if handy." ...|$|E
500|$|To avoid bloodshed, Cowboy Frank Patterson promised Hurst {{they would}} return the mules and Hurst persuaded the posse to withdraw. Hurst went to nearby Charleston, but the Cowboys showed up {{two days later}} without the mules, {{laughing}} at Hurst and the Earps. In response, Hurst had printed and distributed a handbill in which he named Frank McLaury as specifically assisting with hiding the mules. He reprinted this in The Tombstone Epitaph on July 30, 1880. Virgil later said that McLaury had {{asked him if he}} had posted the handbills. When Virgil said he had not, McLaury said if Virgil had printed the handbills it was Frank's intention to kill Virgil. He warned Virgil, [...] "If you ever again follow us as close as you did, then <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> fight anyway." [...] This incident was the first run-in between the Clantons and McLaurys and the Earps.|$|E

500|$|Cowboy Frank Patterson [...] "made {{some kind}} of a compromise" [...] with Captain Hurst, who persuaded the posse to withdraw, with the {{understanding}} that the mules would be returned. The Cowboys showed up two days later without the mules and laughed at Hurst and the Earps. In response, Capt. Hurst printed a handbill describing the theft, and specifically charged Frank McLaury with assisting with hiding the mules. He also reproduced the flyer in The Tombstone Epitaph, on July 30, 1880. Frank McLaury angrily printed a response in the Cowboy-friendly Nuggett, calling Hurst [...] "unmanly", [...] "a coward, a vagabond, a rascal, and a malicious liar", and accused Hurst of stealing the mules himself. Capt. Hurst later cautioned Wyatt, Virgil, and Morgan that the Cowboys had threatened their lives. Virgil reported that Frank accosted him and warned him, [...] "If you ever again follow us as close as you did, then <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> fight anyway." [...] A month later, Earp ran into Frank and Tom McLaury in Charleston, and they told him if he ever followed them as he had done before, they would kill him.|$|E

Marina and his advisers went into a nearby boatshed for consultation. Twenty-nine minutes later, they reappeared and handed the lieutenant a sealed envelope addressed to the commanding officer of the Charleston. The captain's emissary, amid vigorous protestations from the governor, broke the seal and read the message which contained a notification of the surrender of the island of Guam.
