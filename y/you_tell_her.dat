The song also contains a sample from [...] "Beep Beep" [...] by The Playmates. A few seconds after the track, begins an untitled hidden track: the sample, [...] "Go home to your mother! Doesn't she ever watch <b>you!?</b> <b>Tell</b> <b>her</b> this isn't some Communist daycare center! Tell your mother I hate her! Tell your mother I hate you!" [...] is spoken by Stole from the Waters film Desperate Living.
