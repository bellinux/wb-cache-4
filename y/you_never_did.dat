25|$|So I {{wrote this}} song that I loved and I {{sent it to}} them and he and Joel, I remember, left me a great message saying, I hate you, you bastard, I love this song. We're gonna have to do it. We're gonna have to re-build the Wiltern Theater, which they had taken down, it was {{a million dollars to}} re-do the ending... and I felt all his hostility for Universal. A guy named Sean Daniels, who was head of production, one day said to me, well there is hostility because we {{understand}} you waited about eight months to come up with that final song and <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>did</b> it. I said, where'd you hear that? I did it in two days. He said, Jimmy Iovine. So I went to Jimmy Iovine and I said all that to his, yeah it's true, I know. I blamed you but you can't be upset with me. I'm not like a writer. I've gotta make my way with these people. I had to have a scapegoat.|$|E
60|$|CAPT. G. <b>You</b> <b>never</b> <b>did,</b> darling. On my {{soul and}} honor <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>did.</b> I haven't {{a thing to}} forgive you.|$|E
6000|$|... "Is that so?" [...] piped a squeaky little voice. [...] "If you say <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>did,</b> I suppose <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>did,</b> though I {{want the}} word of some one else before I will believe it. What is it you never did?" ...|$|E
60|$|Jack. I {{will take}} very good care <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>do.</b> She is {{excessively}} pretty, {{and she is}} only just eighteen.|$|R
6000|$|... "'I knew you'd say that, Mrs. B.; I knew you'd say that! <b>You</b> <b>never</b> <b>do</b> {{agree with}} me in any of my plans and undertakin's.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{going for}} walks, or music, or books, or seeing {{interesting}} people. <b>You</b> <b>never</b> <b>do</b> anything that's really worth doing {{any more than}} I do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What! 'Midmore got Sidney to heel? <b>You</b> <b>never</b> <b>did</b> that, Sperrit.' This was Mr. Fisher, M.F.H., {{enlarging}} the breach Midmore had made.|$|E
60|$|CHARTERIS. Never mind, dearest: <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>did</b> {{understand}} me; and {{you never}} will. Our vivisecting friend has made a successful experiment at last.|$|E
6000|$|Kate {{shuddered and}} began to cry. [...] "Oh, father!" [...] she exclaimed, [...] "don't say that. Surely <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>did</b> such things as that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That," [...] said Jimmy, with {{sympathetic}} friendliness, [...] "if {{you will}} {{allow me to}} say so, is the cardinal mistake you detectives make. <b>You</b> <b>never</b> <b>do</b> think." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Have {{you heard}} the latest romance in high life, Babe?' he observed, as they were leaving the court. 'But of course <b>you</b> haven't. <b>You</b> <b>never</b> <b>do</b> hear anything.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No-o-o, <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>do.</b> But <b>you</b> get sorry, and that's worse. You'll be awful sorry when I {{tell you}} this, Anne--and you'll be 'shamed of me, I s'pose." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Art! Pris. Bayard artful! Mordaunt, <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>did</b> a {{human being}} greater injustice; a child cannot have greater truth and sincerity than Tom's sister." ...|$|E
6000|$|AUGUSTA. Minnie, I'm {{willing to}} say that I was mistaken about you. You may have been unwise, but <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>did</b> {{anything}} wrong. Isn't it so? ...|$|E
6000|$|Isaac. <b>You</b> <b>never</b> <b>did</b> a wiser thing, believe me; and, as for deceiving your friend, that's {{nothing at}} all--tricking is all fair in love, isn't it, ma'am? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'So! Tumble?' {{repeated}} Desprez. 'Probably healthful. I hazard the guess, Madame Tentaillon, that tumbling is {{a healthful}} way of life. And have <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>done</b> anything else but tumble?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm not {{speaking}} about you. I call it downright interference on his part. And I do think you {{give way to}} him. <b>You</b> <b>never</b> <b>do</b> anything that I suggest." ...|$|R
6000|$|Alon. Will <b>you</b> <b>never</b> have <b>done,</b> sir? I {{must tell}} you, sir, you have tattled long enough; and 'tis now good manners {{to hear me}} speak. Here's a torrent of words indeed; a very impetus dicendi; will <b>you</b> <b>never</b> have <b>done?</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was very}} blind," [...] she said, humbly, [...] "and now I have gone and insisted to poor Emily Grey that <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>did</b> any such thing." ...|$|E

6000|$|... ‘How, sir? <b>You</b> <b>never</b> <b>did</b> {{anything}} wrong? and I {{heard you}} asking pardon but this moment, not of your God, sir, {{but of a}} common fellow-worm!’ the Colonel cried.|$|E
6000|$|... "The lad hath {{indifferent}} penetration," [...] said Mr, Tilghman, laughing, {{and adding}} more soberly: [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>do</b> worse than this, Richard, Maryland may some day {{be proud of}} you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So! Tumble?" [...] {{repeated}} Desprez. [...] "Probably healthful. I hazard the guess, Madame Tentaillon, that tumbling is {{a healthful}} way of life. And have <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>done</b> anything else but tumble?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{must not}} flurry yourself, Mary Ann,' {{interposed}} Mrs. Cluppins. 'You really must consider yourself, my dear, which <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>do.</b> Now go away, Raddle, there's a good soul, or you'll only aggravate her.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is courteous, but I forgive it, Portia, as I {{know you}} will repent of your folly. But <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>did</b> know which side {{to look for the}} butter." ...|$|E
6000|$|Her uncle smiled, {{as if she}} {{had said}} {{something}} peculiarly acceptable to him, and asked, hesitatingly, [...] "When you say <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>did,</b> you know, what is the full phrase?" ...|$|E
6000|$|She laughed gaily. [...] "I deserve that," [...] she said, [...] "and I accept it. But perhaps I {{have done}} {{something}} that <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>did.</b> I have sailed a felucca." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Take {{my advice}} now, if <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>do</b> again," [...] said Bertram, as they parted; [...] "make {{yourself}} master {{of your own}} house, and as soon after as possible make her the mistress of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>do</b> {{anything}} more foolish than that, {{you will get}} through life well enough. Appearances were against me, and you jumped at conclusions a little too fast. Let us say no more about it." ...|$|R
60|$|MRS. G. You {{want me to}} go, of course. <b>You</b> <b>never</b> told {{me about}} this, though I've been married to you for ever so long; and <b>you</b> <b>never</b> would have told me if I hadn't found out; and <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>do</b> tell me {{anything}} about yourself, or what you do, or what you take an interest in.|$|R
6000|$|... 'My dear Mr Chuzzlewit,' simpered Merry, 'as to light-headedness, {{there never}} was such a feather of a head as mine. It's perfect balloon, I declare! <b>You</b> <b>never</b> <b>DID,</b> you know!' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It ain't {{much you}} don't hear, Dicky," [...] ses Bob Pretty, turning on 'im; [...] "the on'y thing <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>did</b> 'ear, {{and never will}} 'ear, is any good of yourself." ...|$|E
60|$|STRAKER. [unimpressed] That's because <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>done</b> any Mr Robinson. My {{business}} is {{to do away with}} labor. You'll get more out of me and a machine than you will out of twenty laborers, and not so much to drink either.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you mean}} perhaps she lies? She lies {{whenever}} it suits her, I'm very sure. But I know when people lie--and that's what I've loved in <b>you,</b> that <b>YOU</b> <b>never</b> <b>do.</b> Mrs. Beale didn't yesterday at any rate. He HAS seen her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am sure Nat {{will look}} well after us," [...] Myra said confidently; [...] "besides, mamma, I {{am certain that}} you could not walk down there. <b>You</b> know <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>do</b> walk, and I cannot {{recollect}} your walking so far as you have done to-day." ...|$|R
