One Japanese superstition says that if {{a butterfly}} enters <b>your</b> <b>guest</b> room and perches behind the bamboo screen, the person whom you most love is coming to see you. Large numbers of butterflies are viewed as bad omens. When Taira no Masakado was secretly preparing for his famous revolt, there appeared in Kyoto so vast a swarm of butterflies that the people were frightened— thinking the apparition to be a portent of coming evil.|$|E

You can do this, of course, by making investments to upgrade guest services or provide better products, facilities, and programs, {{but this is not}} the only place to invest your money—and it may not even be the best course. As it turns out, guests 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of their experiences can be improved without huge investments. Instead, if you can get <b>your</b> <b>guests</b> to focus on the positive aspects of their experiences, their perceptions of your operation (and their evaluations) will likely improve. The other side of this coin is to avoid calling attention to unpleasant aspects of an experience. In this chapter, I want to discuss ways to encourage <b>your</b> <b>guests</b> to focus on their experience in a positive way (and to minimize attention on unpleasantness). This involves guiding the guest experience...|$|R
