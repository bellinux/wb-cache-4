500|$|Book III {{covers the}} mediaeval Quadrivium, the four {{subjects}} which supplemented the Trivium being mathematics, geometry, music and astronomy. He argues {{that there are}} infinitely many numbers, as you can always add one (or any other number) to whatever number <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> limit. He attributes geometry to Ancient Egypt, arguing that because the River Nile flooded and covered the land with mud, geometry was needed to mark out people's land [...] "with lines and measures". Isidore distinguishes astronomy from astrology, and covers the world, {{the sky and the}} celestial sphere, the zodiac, the sun, moon, stars, Milky Way, planets and the names of the stars. He derives the curved (curvus) vault of the heavens from the Latin word for [...] "upside-down" [...] (conversus). He explains eclipses of the sun as the moon coming between the earth and the sun, and eclipses of the moon as happening when it runs into the shadow of the earth. He condemns the Roman naming of the planets after their gods: Jupiter, Saturn, Mars, Venus, and Mercury.|$|E
2500|$|This is at {{the heart}} of the tetralogy's achievement. Updike once said of the Rabbit books that they were an {{exercise}} in point of view. This was typically self-deprecating, but contains an important grain of truth. Harry's education extends no further than high school, and his view is further limited by a range of prejudices and a stubborn, combative spirit, yet he is the vehicle for a half-million-word meditation on postwar American anxiety, failure and prosperity. A mode had to be devised to make this possible, and that involved pushing beyond the bounds of realism. In a novel like this, Updike insisted, you have to be generous and allow your characters eloquence, [...] "and not chop them down to what <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> right size." ...|$|E

[...] In November 2012, {{she was diagnosed with}} plantar fasciitis in her right foot and had decided then that the 2013 World Championships would be her last professional race.

[...] When asked about her future away from the sport, she said, [...] "It's a complete blank. [...] I can't imagine what I'll be doing. [...] I can't do anything useful for society, but I will completely cut off connection with the world of athletics." [...] She cried with her mother and left these final words for future athletes: [...] "Always do what <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> right thing no matter what anybody tells you." ...|$|E
