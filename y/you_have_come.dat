25|$|By {{the captain}} of the port in which you have cast anchor I have been courteously requested, as a soldier, and, above all, as a gentleman, to hold a conference with you, adding that you have advised him that war has been {{declared}} between our respective nations, and that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> for the purpose of occupying these Spanish islands.|$|E

Churchill wrote to express his {{gratitude}} for Chamberlain's willingness to stand by him in the nation's hour of need, and Lord Baldwin, the only living former Prime Minister besides Chamberlain and Lloyd George, wrote, [...] "You have passed through fire since we were talking together only a fortnight ago, and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> out pure gold." ...|$|E

You will either take your place as providers of care, or your numbers will dwindle as most dispensing activities are replaced by robotics and pharmacy technicians. I am a physician, and I say our profession and the patients that we serve need you 'on the team' as clinical pharmacist practitioners. But, will you truly join us?" ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the mid-1990s}} Sunny Day Real Estate defined the [...] "emo" [...] genre for many. Weezer's album Pinkerton (1996) was also influential. By 2000 {{and on into}} the new decade emo {{was one of the}} most popular rock music genres. Popular acts {{included}} platinum selling success of Bleed American by Jimmy Eat World (2001) and Dashboard Confessional's The Places <b>You</b> <b>Have</b> <b>Come</b> to Fear the Most (2003). The new emo had a much more mainstream sound than in the 1990s and a far greater appeal amongst adolescents than its earlier incarnations. At the same time, use of the term [...] "emo" [...] expanded beyond the musical genre, becoming associated with fashion, a hairstyle and any music that expressed emotion. The term [...] "emo" [...] has been applied by critics and journalists to a variety of artists, including multi-platinum acts such as Fall Out Boy and My Chemical Romance and disparate groups such as Paramore and Panic! at the Disco, even when they reject the label.|$|E

2500|$|On Littlejohn's show of 8 July 1994, he was {{critical}} of two lesbians, {{one of whom was}} Linda Bellos.

2500|$|Abby Kelley Foster gave {{testimony}} to the persecution she had suffered as a woman: [...] "My life has been my speech. For fourteen years I have advocated this cause by my daily life. Bloody feet, sisters, have worn smooth the path by which <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> hither." [...] Abby H. Price spoke about prostitution, as she had the year before, arguing that too many women fell to prostitution {{because they did not}} have the job opportunities or education that men had.|$|E
2500|$|In [...] {{the prophet}} Ezekiel the [...] "son of man" [...] sets down God's word against {{the king of}} Tyre: the king was the [...] "seal of perfection", adorned with {{precious}} stones from {{the day of his}} creation, placed by God in the garden of Eden on the holy mountain as a guardian cherub. But the king sinned through wickedness and violence, and so he was driven out of the garden and thrown to the earth, where now he is consumed by God's fire: [...] "All the nations who knew you are appalled at you, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> to a horrible end and will be no more." [...] (v.19).|$|E
2500|$|... you {{four people}} have played an {{extremely}} negative {{role in the}} liberation of thought, {{the role of a}} brake. [...] As far as I'm concerned, this is because <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> too much under the influence of people like Kang Sheng. … Kang Sheng passed his time reading between the lines looking for [...] "allusions" [...] without taking account of the real subject of articles and the general idea. [...] He made a sort of talent of looking for a particular point he could attack. [...] He had learned this from Stalin, from Andrei Zhdanov and the KGB, and acted thus {{from the time of the}} Yan'an era.|$|E

2500|$|The {{result was}} that, unlike in Afghanistan, the Reagan Doctrine was rather quickly applied in Angola and Nicaragua, with the United States {{providing}} military {{support to the}} UNITA movement in Angola and the [...] "contras" [...] in Nicaragua, but without {{a declaration of war}} against either country. Addressing the Heritage Foundation in October 1989, UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi called the Heritage Foundation's efforts [...] "a source of great support. No Angolan will forget your efforts. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> to Jamba, and you have taken our message to Congress and the Administration". U.S. aid to UNITA began to flow overtly after Congress repealed the Clark Amendment, a long-standing legislative prohibition on military aid to UNITA.|$|E
2500|$|Emo {{broke into}} the {{mainstream}} media {{during the summer of}} 2002. Jimmy Eat World's Bleed American album went platinum on the strength of [...] "The Middle", which topped Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. Dashboard Confessional reached number 22 on the chart with [...] "Screaming Infidelities" [...] from their Vagrant Records debut album, The Places <b>You</b> <b>Have</b> <b>Come</b> to Fear the Most (which was number five on the Independent Albums chart), and was the first non-platinum-selling artist to record an episode of MTV Unplugged. The resulting live album topped the Independent Albums chart in 2003, and went platinum. New Found Glory's album, Sticks and Stones, debuted at number four on the Billboard 200. The Get Up Kids' 2002 album, On a Wire, peaked at number 57 on the Billboard 200 and number three on Top Independent Albums chart. Their 2004 album, Guilt Show, peaked at number 58 on the Billboard 200.|$|E
2500|$|The narrow {{lanes of}} Bowbazar have {{numerous}} kothas - quarters which house numerous {{singing and dancing}} girls (baijis). There are renowned dance teachers coaching the dancing girls. The Telegraph carried a candid report, [...] "The Kathak master who would arrive every day in a rickshaw through the narrow alleys of Bowbazar was the famed Kathak guru Ram Narayan Mishra of the Lucknow gharana (school). He was accompanied {{by one of his}} young students, a boy named Chitresh Das. Das remembers his guru going from baiji-quarter to baiji-quarter, the burly bouncers touching his feet, mothers of baijis in their zari (gold-bordered saris) personally dressing a paan (betel leaf) for him." [...] There used to be rules and norms, and Bowbazar was meant for the cultured rich. In olden days if anyone misbehaved, they were just told, [...] "Matlab se aaye, jaiye Sonagachi (if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> with bad intentions, go to Sonagachi, the red light district)." [...] However, things have changed and the kothas of Bowbazar are in decline.|$|E

2500|$|On 31 March 2005 {{following}} a urinary tract infection, he developed septic shock, {{a form of}} infection with a high fever and low blood pressure, but was not hospitalised. Instead, he was monitored {{by a team of}} consultants at his private residence. This was taken as an indication by the pope, and those close to him, that he was nearing death; it would have been in accordance with his wishes to die in the Vatican. Later that day, Vatican sources announced that John Paul II had been given the Anointing of the Sick by his friend and secretary Stanisław Dziwisz. The day before his death, one of his closest personal friends, Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka visited him at his bedside. During {{the final days of the}} pope's life, the lights were kept burning through the night where he lay in the Papal apartment on the top floor of the Apostolic Palace. Tens of thousands of people assembled and held vigil in St. Peter's Square and the surrounding streets for two days. Upon hearing of this, the dying pope was said to have stated: [...] "I have searched for you, and now <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> to me, and I thank you." ...|$|E
2500|$|Murphy's accomplishments are all {{the more}} {{remarkable}} as he was deaf. He was known as [...] "Silent Mike" [...] due to his affliction, and contemporary reports state that, though he was deaf, the affliction was not so severe as to prevent him from hearing all remarks. One report in 1905 noted: [...] "It was characteristic of Murphy to encourage the belief that he was very deaf and thus break down the caution of the lads who prided themselves on their ability to outwit the veteran." [...] In 1908, The Washington Post noted that, though Murphy had been [...] "rather deaf" [...] for several years, his deafness had worsened, such that anyone wanting to speak with him [...] "has to shout {{at the top of his}} lungs." [...] Murphy joked at the time, [...] "I'm not much of a one to tell secrets to." [...] When he was in Reno in 1910 for the Jack Johnson–James Jeffries fight, Murphy recalled being approached by a woman who went on at length telling him about her marital problems. After she finished, Murphy told her, [...] "Madame, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> to the right person. Your secrets are safe. I have not heard a word you said." ...|$|E
2500|$|Transferred to Supreme Army Command as Chief of Staff to the Quartermaster General {{at the end}} of April 1918, Thaer {{reported}} to Hindenburg and Ludendorff on 1 May 1918. [...] He had already resolved that he would report openly on the frontline situation to the two men running the war. [...] By that criterion he failed. [...] The field-marshall hero of Tannenberg was sympathetic: [...] "My dear Mr von Thaer, your nerves have certainly been affected by the last few terrible weeks through which <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>come.</b> [...] I think that the good spirits at Supreme Army Command will soon set you right". [...] Thaer encountered a similar, if less avuncular, reaction a little later when he {{reported to}} First Quartermaster General Erich von Ludendorff: [...] "What's your game? [...] What {{do you want me to}} do? [...] Should I now make peace at any price?" [...] Thaer replied: [...] "Excellence, I said nothing about that. [...] Ot is my duty - and it is a very painful duty - to point out that the condition of our troops is not going to improve, but will continue slowly to deteriorate". [...] Ludendorff persisted: [...] "If the condition of our troops is getting worse, if discipline is deteriorating, then that is your fault and the fault of all those field commanders who do not get it. [...] How else can it be that entire divisions can found too drunk to fight, unable to implement the necessary advances. [...] That is the explanation for the great March offensive, and now [...] Operation Georgette, not progressing further.|$|E
