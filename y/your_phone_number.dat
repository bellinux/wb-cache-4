30|$|Both short- and {{long-term}} knowledge can influence visualization affordances and biases. However, {{it is difficult}} to distinguish whether Type 2 processing is using significant working memory capacity to temporarily hold knowledge or if participants have stored the relevant knowledge in long-term memory and processing is more automatic. Complicating the issue, knowledge stored in long-term memory can influence decision making with visualizations using both Type 1 and 2 processing. For example, if you try to remember Pythagorean’s Theorem, which you may have learned in high school or middle school, you may recall that a 2 [*]+[*]b 2 [*]=[*]c 2, where c represents the length of the hypotenuse and a and b represent the lengths of the other two sides of a triangle.
