And he said, 'I remember the kind of dresses she used to wear. They were old and faded and gray.' And then he walked some more. And he said, 'I remember how she was always bent over the stove, trying to stretch what little we had.' And that was the beginning, that night, of his walk. And he walked that floor until just about daybreak.|$|E

25|$|They say it's a {{government}} takeover of health care, a big lie just like Goebbels. You say it enough, you repeat the lie, you repeat the lie, you repeat the lie and eventually, people believe it. Like blood libel. That's {{the same kind}} of thing. The Germans said enough about the Jews and the people believed it and you had the Holocaust. <b>You</b> <b>tell</b> a lie over and over again. And we've heard on this floor, government takeover of health care.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} said by some that I asked for too much. Perhaps so. <b>You</b> <b>tell</b> me -- what quality of {{leadership}} would ask too little? What sort of leadership would be content merely to maintain a standard of living that for so long has been so meager for so many? The shame upon me and my administration {{would have been in}} not struggling for something better. Today, I am not ashamed..... The most meaningful measurement of progress is that certain things are no longer acceptable to us as a people.|$|E

After the photograph was published in newspapers across the United States, Hartnett received a telegram from Baseball Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis instructing him not to have his photograph taken with Capone in the future. Hartnett replied with a telegram to the Commissioner whimsically stating, [...] "OK, but if you don't want me to have my picture taken with Al Capone, <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> him." ...|$|E
500|$|Mr. Brownlee, we {{have listened}} to you {{with a great deal}} of {{attention}} and the answers you have given seem pretty hard to meet. But I have one more question...

500|$|A seventh album, {{tentatively}} titled Can't <b>You</b> <b>Tell,</b> {{was recorded}} in 2003, but it was cancelled after its first two singles – the title track and [...] "One Believer" [...] – both failed to make Top 40 upon their releases in late 2004 and early 2005 respectively. Diamond Rio's second Greatest Hits package, Greatest Hits, Volume 2, was released in 2006. Like their first Greatest Hits album, this compilation included several new songs {{as well as the}} band's greatest hits; one of these new songs, [...] "God Only Cries", was released as a single, peaking at No.30. Shortly after the album's release, Diamond Rio parted ways with Arista Nashville.|$|E

During the interview before the song they reiterated {{their support for the}} campaign and their intentions to support charity with the proceeds. The campaign was ultimately successful, and [...] "Killing in the Name" [...] became the number-one single in the UK for Christmas 2009. Zack de la Rocha spoke to BBC One upon hearing the news, stating that: ...|$|E

500|$|Bush {{continued}} {{to serve on}} the NACA through 1948 and expressed annoyance with aircraft companies for delaying development of a turbojet engine because of the huge expense of research and development as well as retooling from older piston engines. He was similarly disappointed with the automobile industry, which showed no interest in his proposals for more fuel-efficient engines. General Motors told him that [...] "even if it were a better engine, [...] would not be interested in it." [...] Bush likewise deplored trends in advertising. [...] "Madison Avenue believes," [...] he said, [...] "that if <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> the public something absurd, but do it enough times, the public will ultimately register it in its stock of accepted verities." ...|$|E

500|$|Against the Washington Senators on August 12, 1896, Lajoie {{made his}} major league debut. He played first base and {{recorded}} a single. Ed Delahanty was being considered {{to play the}} first base position after Dan Brouthers retired. Delahanty, however, wanted Lajoie to play first so he could return to his natural position of left field. Delahanty said to Lajoie, [...] "Look, sonny, <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> the boss you’re a first baseman and you and me are gonna get along." [...] Lajoie became the team's first baseman {{and by the end}} of the season, he and Delahanty were roommates.

Hoffman responded, [...] "I went 2-for-4, double, RBI." [...] to which Greg replied, [...] "That'll be the last (blanking) time <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> me how you did. When I ask you how you did, it's how the team did." [...] Hoffman never forgot that. Given their age difference, Hoffman considered his brothers more role models than playmates.
