500|$|The {{original}} folk metal band Skyclad {{was also}} known {{to deal with}} serious political subjects but through lyrics that were littered with puns and humor. Other bands have continued to feature fun and humorous lyrics. This includes Finntroll with their obsession on trolls. The lyrics of Korpiklaani also [...] "focused on having a good time, drinking [...] partying." [...] In a review of Turisas' The Varangian Way album, James Christopher Monger of Allmusic commented that some listeners might be put off by [...] "the concept of grown men in pelts" [...] singing such lyrics as [...] "come with us to the south, write <b>your</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> our roll." [...] Heri Joensen of Týr contends that a listener needs to be confident in his masculinity to listen to such traditional Faeroese lyrics as his own [...] "young lads, happy lads, step upon the floor, dance merrily." ...|$|E
500|$|The lyrical {{content of}} the {{interlude}} is spare and largely revolves around Rihanna chanting, [...] "cake cake cake cake cake cake." [...] Aside from the repetitive chant of [...] "cake", the interlude consists of multiple sexual metaphors. The lyric [...] "I know you wanna bite this/ It's so enticing/ Nothing else like this, I'ma make you my bitch/ And it's not even my birthday/ But you wanna put <b>your</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> it" [...] is a metaphor referring to a vagina. Rihanna sings about the desire to have spontaneous sex. Rihanna promises her lover that she will make him do whatever she pleases, singing [...] "I'mma make you my bitch." [...] T'Cha Dunlevy of The Montreal Gazette described the lyric as a [...] "promise", with Rihanna intending to act upon her desires. The interlude ends mid-verse and mid-lyric with a fade at 1:18. Katherine St. Asaph of Popdust described the fade as [...] "ungraceful", as well as writing that it makes the track appear as {{though it is not}} finished. Upon the fade, Rihanna puts forward the line [...] "Ooh, I wanna fuck you right now." [...] Dunlevy and St. Asaph were critical of the final line, with the former labelling it as [...] "blatant", and the latter noting that [...] "cursing makes everything obvious." ...|$|E
500|$|Brown was {{nominated}} in the Best Actress category at the 2009 British Academy Television Awards {{based on her}} performance in the episode, becoming the first soap actress nominated in the category since 1988, when Jean Alexander was shortlisted {{for her role as}} Hilda Ogden in Coronation Street. She commented that she was proud to be nominated, but was not overly excited as: [...] "I don't believe anything is going to happen until it does, until you see <b>your</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> a paper or it actually happens and you have something in your hand." [...] Brown lost out to Anna Maxwell Martin, but the show's executive producer, Diederick Santer, described the nomination as his proudest moment of 2009, saying: [...] "I'm not one to complain to the referee, but it's beyond me why she didn't win. Week in, week out, she turns out amazing performances. The audience knew it and we knew it. With the greatest respect to the actress who won, you could hear the audience in the Royal Festival Hall that night sigh with disappointment. It was a missed opportunity by BAFTA [...] to connect with a big audience." [...] McLean agreed that Brown deserved to win, but commented on the awards: [...] "never underestimate snobbery towards soap." [...] Brown spoke of the nomination in 2013, saying: [...] "You never [...] if you're in a soap. [...] I would've liked it, yes. I would've felt it had crowned my acting in a way, made it sound worthwhile, I think. So I didn't care that I didn't get nominated for any other awards that time!" ...|$|E

500|$|Minaj {{has been}} {{embroiled in a}} feud with veteran rapper Lil' Kim since her success with Pink Friday. Kim accused Minaj of copying her image saying, [...] "If {{you are going to}} steal my swag, you gonna have to pay. Something gotta give. You help me, I help you. That's how it goes to me." [...] Minaj's single [...] "Roman's Revenge" [...] with Eminem was {{believed}} to be a response to Kim's comments, although she later denied this, she responded to the situation in an interview with HOT 97's Angie Martinez saying, [...] "She picked a fight with Foxy, then she picked a fight with Eve, then she picked a fight with Remy, then it was Mrs. Wallace, then it was Nicki Minaj. Every time you in the news, it's 'cause you gettin' at somebody! Where's your music? Put your music out, and when I see <b>your</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> Billboard, that's when I'll respond to you. Other than that, goodbye. It's Barbie, bitch." [...] Lil' Kim reignited the feud with the release of her mixtape Black Friday (the title of which directly referenced Minaj). The artwork portrays Lil' Kim decapitating Minaj with a sword. A fragment of a diss track called [...] "Tragedy" [...] was released in response by Minaj in April 2011. Following the release of Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded, critics suggested that the track [...] "Stupid Hoe" [...] may have contained attacks directed at Kim. Lil' Kim later suggested in an interview with 105's Breakfast Club that the song [...] "Automatic" [...] was similar to her unreleased material, also calling Minaj [...] "obnoxious" [...] and [...] "catty".|$|E
2500|$|Call Me by Your Name {{had been}} in {{development}} since 2007, when producers Peter Spears and Howard Rosenman optioned the screen rights to Aciman's novel. Ivory had been set to co-direct the film, but ended up writing the script and co-producing. Guadagnino, who came on board as a location consultant, became the sole director in 2016. The film was financed {{through a variety of}} international sources. Principal photography took place in Crema, Italy in May and June of 2016. Cinematographer Sayombhu Mukdeeprom shot Call Me by <b>Your</b> <b>Name</b> <b>on</b> 35mm film.|$|E
2500|$|In 1989, Kane {{acknowledged}} Finger as [...] "a contributing force" [...] in the character's creation, and wrote, [...] "Now that my long-time {{friend and}} collaborator is gone, I {{must admit that}} Bill never received the fame and recognition he deserved. He was an unsung hero ... I often tell my wife, if I could go back fifteen years, before he died, I would like to say. 'I'll put <b>your</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> it now. You deserve it.'"

2500|$|Gary Neal was {{persistent}} and by winter of 1959 was nearing completion of his signature petition to place Morse on the May ballot. Morse soon found himself {{at a meeting}} with Neal where they discussed his efforts. Neal said to Morse, “if [...] we [...] don’t put <b>your</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> the ballot, your enemies will." [...] It was clear the {{elephant in the room}} with Gary Neal and Wayne Morse was the Oregon Republican Party. Morse shot back about the Oregon Republicans, “I say to the Republican Party, trot out your governor. I’m ready to take him on.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Equal in foulness to {{the third}} Baldrick, Private Baldrick also matches his {{immediate}} predecessor in terms of stupidity. His [...] "cunning plans", like those of his Elizabethan ancestor, have an insane, perverse logic to them. Examples include carving his name on a bullet, {{in relation to the}} old saying [...] "a bullet with <b>your</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> it", his explanation being that if he owns the bullet, it won't ever kill him as he won't ever shoot himself ("shame", comments Captain Blackadder), and the chances of there being two bullets with [...] "Baldrick" [...] on them are [...] "very small indeed". He has also been known to eat cigarettes as seen in the last episode of the series.|$|E
2500|$|Immediately after {{finishing}} at Tuskegee, Stewart moved to New York and enrolled at New York University, where {{he earned a}} law certificate in 1896 {{and worked as a}} legal assistant in his father's law office. [...] A strong follower of Washington's principles, Stewart's father operated his office and his business relationship with his son under strict guidelines. [...] He required that his son sign a contract which specified his employment and compensation in detail, noting that [...] "my intention is to pay you $3 per week to cover your fare, lunches; allow you 5% of all my fees; at 21, I shall make you Notary Public and put <b>your</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> the door." ...|$|E

But Spotted Tail, you cannot read or write. You claim that the government has tricked your people and placed the lines of your reservation a long way inside of where it was agreed that they should be. [...] You signed that paper, knowing only what the interpreter told you it said. If anything happened when the paper was being made up that changed its order, if you had been educated and could read and write, you could have known about it and refused to put <b>your</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> it. Do you intend to let your children remain in the same condition of ignorance in which you have lived, which will compel them always to meet the whiter man at a great disadvantage through an interpreter, as you have to do? [...] As your friend, Spotted Tail, I urge you to send your children with me to this Carlisle School and I will do everything I can to advance them in intelligence and industry in order that they may come back and help you." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Washburn, he and Cimino {{spent three}} days {{together}} in Los Angeles at the Sunset Marquis, hammering out the plot. The script eventually went through several drafts, evolving into a story with three distinct acts. Washburn did not interview any veterans to write The Deer Hunter nor do any research. [...] "I had a month, that was it," [...] he explains. [...] "The clock was ticking. Write the fucking script! But all I {{had to do was}} watch TV. Those combat cameramen in Vietnam were out there in the field with the guys. I mean, they had stuff that you wouldn't dream of seeing about Iraq." [...] When Washburn was finished, he says, Cimino and Joann Carelli, an associate producer on The Deer Hunter who went on to produce two more of Cimino's later films, took him to dinner at a cheap restaurant off the Sunset Strip. He recalls, [...] "We finished, and Joann looks at me across the table, and she says, 'Well, Deric, it's fuck-off time.' I was fired. It was a classic case: you get a dummy, get him to write the goddamn thing, tell him to go fuck himself, put <b>your</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> the thing, and he'll go away. I was so tired, I didn't care. I'd been working 20 hours a day for a month. I got on the plane the next day, and I went back to Manhattan and my carpenter job." ...|$|E
