25|$|The {{story was}} recounted in Ibn Ishaq's Sīrah. On {{his way to}} murder Muhammad, Umar met his best friend Nua'im bin Abdullah who had {{secretly}} converted to Islam but had not told Umar. When Umar informed {{him that he had}} set out to kill Muhammad, Nua'im said, “By God, you have deceived yourself, O Umar! Do you think that Banu Abd Manaf would let <b>you</b> <b>run</b> around alive once you had killed their son Muhammad? Why don't you return to your own house and at least set it straight?”.|$|E
25|$|Bernstein {{performed}} a wide repertoire from the baroque era to the 20th century, although perhaps from the 1970s onwards {{he tended to}} focus more on music from the romantic era. He was considered especially accomplished with the works of Gustav Mahler and with American composers in general, including George Gershwin, Aaron Copland, Charles Ives, Roy Harris, William Schuman, and of course himself. Some of his recordings of works by these composers would likely appear on many music critics' lists of recommended recordings. A list of his other well-thought-of recordings would probably include individual works from Haydn, Beethoven, Berlioz, Schumann, Liszt, Nielsen, Sibelius, Stravinsky, Hindemith, and Shostakovich, among others. His recordings of Rhapsody in Blue (full-orchestra version) and An American in Paris for Columbia Records, released in 1959, are considered definitive by many, although Bernstein cut the Rhapsody slightly, and his more 'symphonic' approach with slower tempi is quite far from Gershwin's own conception of the piece, evident from his two recordings. (Oscar Levant, Earl Wild, and others come closer to Gershwin's own style.) Bernstein never conducted Gershwin's Piano Concerto in F, or more than a few excerpts from Porgy and Bess, although he did discuss the latter in his article Why Don't <b>You</b> <b>Run</b> Upstairs and Write a Nice Gershwin Tune?, originally published in The New York Times and later reprinted in his 1959 book The Joy of Music.|$|E

500|$|When the Bengali saint Ramakrishna {{once asked}} a devotee why one {{would prefer to}} worship Mother over him, this devotee rhetorically replied, [...] "Maharaj, {{when they are in}} trouble your devotees come running to you. But, where do <b>you</b> <b>run</b> when you are in trouble?" ...|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to his predecessor, who was actively involved in most elements of his government, Getty preferred to set the government's broad direction and leave lower-level details to his ministers. [...] Ralph Klein, while serving as Environment Minister under Getty, commented that [...] "If you are a minister, <b>you</b> <b>run</b> that portfolio yourself" [...] and expressed {{an appreciation for the}} freedom that the Premier gave his cabinet. [...] Al Adair, who served in two different portfolios under Getty, described this approach in his memoirs as [...] "you make the decisions, <b>you</b> <b>run</b> your department, but make mistakes and you're gone". [...] Lisac credits him for knowing when to intervene and when not to, but Adair felt that his approach led to ministers working too much in isolation.|$|E
500|$|Gray, Darwin, and Hooker became lifelong {{friends and}} colleagues, and Gray and Hooker {{conducted}} research on Darwin's behalf in 1877 on their Rocky Mountain expedition. After Hooker returned to England and reported to Darwin on their adventure, Darwin wrote back to Gray: [...] "I have just... heard prodigies of your strength & activity. That <b>you</b> <b>run</b> up a mountain like a cat!" ...|$|E

500|$|Alistair Brownlee and Jonathan Brownlee were {{considered}} strong favourites before the race. The 2000 men's Olympic triathlon champion, Canadian Simon Whitfield, said that, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>run</b> this Olympic race ten times, {{one of the}} Brownlee brothers will win {{nine out of ten}} times. But they won’t win it that 10th time, and you try to be that person to be there to capitalise on it that 10th time.” Among other contenders were Javier Gómez of Spain, who was the ITU Triathlon World Champion in both the 2008 World Championships and the 2010 World Championships; New Zealander Bevan Docherty; Whitfield of Canada and the 2008 Olympic champion Jan Frodeno from Germany.|$|E
500|$|The {{focal point}} of {{criticism}} was Storm of Zehirs story. [...] Critics considered its focus on trade and economics shallow compared to the epic adventures presented in Neverwinter Nights 2 and Mask of the Betrayer. [...] GameSpy referred to the storyline as a [...] "boringly generic adventure", and GameSpot said [...] "The quests reflect this mundane storyline. <b>You</b> <b>run</b> a lot of lame errands to kill specific monsters and recover lost or stolen merchandise, and you clean out a bunch of formulaic dungeons, caves, graveyards, and the like". Other complaints included the presence of random encounters on the overland map, which were considered excessive, as well as long load times.|$|E
500|$|... "What's Your Name" [...] is an midtempo electro song, and bases its melody on {{thrusting}} new wave-influenced synths. It {{contains a}} [...] "whimsical" [...] beat that utilizes sirens and wind instruments. Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune compared the song's synth riff {{to the music}} that was popular during the 1980s MTV generation, while John Soeder from The Plain Dealer noted its similarity to British duo the Eurythmics. Usher monotonously repeats the pick-up line hook, [...] "What's your name?", and thereby pays homage to his bachelor history. The song's lyrics describe [...] "the feeling you get when <b>you</b> <b>run</b> into a woman that makes you speak gibberish".|$|E

500|$|... "Touch My Body" [...] rides a {{relatively}} restrained slow-dance groove, with some light, orchestral-synth flourishes thrown in. The rhythm is almost completely carried by an effortless keyboard bump, the easygoing repetitiveness of which eventually wears the listener down, and {{sets up a}} delicate frame for Carey to sing around. She pulls back when the song picks up the pace, and Carey keeps it simple here, playing with tempos rather than range. Indeed, she almost quietly slides into the chorus. [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>run</b> around and brag about this secret rendezvous, I will hunt you down", she sings, letting the last line trail off. But you don't necessarily believe her, as the feel is more playful that sinful.|$|E
500|$|... "Bad Timing" [...] {{was written}} by Pendleton Ward and Kent Osborne. They {{previously}} collaborated with Jack Pendarvis and Adam Muto {{to come up with}} the idea for the episode, with the former duo adapting that to a storyboard. The creator of Adventure Time, Ward resigned from his occupation as its runner during production of the season. Osborne is the head of story. Alluding to the episode, for Hulu, Muto and Osborne summarized it as Lumpy confounding the concept of time travel. The writers related the episode to [...] "one of those situations where <b>you</b> <b>run</b> into someone from high school and you're like, 'Woah, why didn't I ever notice you before? Alluded to in this episode, the one it precedes involves time travel as well.|$|E
500|$|In his 1980 {{commentary}} on the story, Dick also suggested that his reasoning for making Bors sympathetic {{was a result of}} a form of trust he advanced towards robots, as opposed to androids. [...] "Perhaps", he suggested, [...] "it's because a robot does not try to deceive you as to what it is". One of the themes that runs throughout all of Dick's fiction is the [...] "power of empathy" [...] and he uses it as the [...] "key element defining the authentic human being". For example, when Silvia meets the robot that runs the government, she exclaims [...] "My God, you have no understanding of us. <b>You</b> <b>run</b> all this, and you're incapable of empathy. You're nothing but a mechanical computer." ...|$|E

500|$|Some regard Youngblood, who was {{considered}} to be an excellent pass rusher, as the best defensive lineman in Gators history as well {{as one of the top}} five players in the University of Florida's football program. When Time magazine chose him for their 1970 All-America Team, it said of Youngblood: [...] "Deceptively fast for his size, he reads screens and swing passes so adroitly that he intimidates quarterbacks by his mere presence." [...] His coach Doug Dickey told The Sporting News, [...] "He is difficult to move when <b>you</b> <b>run</b> at him, has the speed and agility to pursue down the line of scrimmage, and the strength and quickness to rush the passer." [...] In one of a series of articles written for The Gainesville Sun in 2006, Youngblood was ranked as the No. 5 all-time greatest player for the Florida Gators.|$|E
500|$|Standing [...] {{tall and}} {{weighing}} , Perry was small {{for a typical}} fullback, even during his era. Also unlike typical fullbacks, Perry's forte was not to run with power, but rather he was a straight-ahead runner who combined power and speed with deceptive elusiveness. His role was primarily as a ball carrier rather than a blocker, {{and he had a}} knack for finding holes in opposing defensive lines. [...] "If you saw a hole, you take it," [...] Perry described his running style to The Sacramento Bee. [...] "If you didn't, you kept moving until you did. <b>You</b> <b>run</b> with instinct." [...] Perry was known for his speed, which earned him the nickname [...] "The Jet". He ran the 100-yard dash in 9.5 seconds in 1947, two-tenths of a second slower than Mel Patton's then-world record of 9.3 seconds.|$|E
500|$|Several {{tracks on}} Sir Lucious Left Foot contain humorous skits with {{dialogue}} from additional vocalists, including Chris Carmouche, Dax [...] "Dirty Dr." [...] Rudnak, Big Rube, Henry Welch, and Keisha Atwater. Welch and Carmouche are {{featured in a}} skit {{at the beginning of}} [...] "Be Still", in which they make a reference to [...] "tea bagging". Dax Rudnak concludes [...] "General Patton" [...] with a skit about a sex maneuver called [...] "the David Blaine", which according to the skit is [...] "when you’re making love to someone from behind, then have a friend take over and <b>you</b> <b>run</b> to a window and wave at your partner". In an interview for Time Out Chicago, Big Boi was asked whether he [...] " [...] taking credit for this, or is this something people do?", to which he responded [...] "Yeah, man! You know, man, they do it now!".|$|E

500|$|Gaven {{has had a}} {{prominent}} career in musical theatre and has appeared in many rock musicals. She told TheaterWeek in 1993 that she thinks those kinds of musicals are harder to sing in compared to standard musicals, and that [...] "the nature {{of rock and roll}} is that it's on the edge. It's written to be done dangerously. You can't be careful and do it at the same time. If you don't do it dangerously, <b>you</b> <b>run</b> the risk of losing the impact." [...] During her career, Gaven has sung in both mezzo-soprano and soprano roles, and has been cited for her belting. According to Alvin Klein, theatre critic for The New York Times, she [...] "is categorically a mezzo soprano." [...] Gaven has also been noted for her strong voice, and was once told by a sound technician at An Evening Dinner Theater in Elmsford, New York that [...] "We always turn off the mikes when you sing" [...] because she did not need amplification.|$|E
500|$|Once he and Harding were inaugurated, Herrick made ill-advised {{decisions}} that turned crucial Republican constituencies against him, alienating farmers by opposing {{the establishment of}} an agricultural college. On the other hand, according to Sinclair, [...] "Harding had little to do, and he did it very well". His responsibility to preside over the state Senate allowed him to increase his growing network of political contacts. Harding and others envisioned a successful gubernatorial run in 1905, but Herrick refused to stand aside. In early 1905, Harding announced he would accept nomination as governor if offered, but faced with the anger of leaders such as Cox, Foraker and Dick (Hanna's replacement in the Senate), announced he would seek no office in 1905. Herrick was defeated, but his new running mate, Andrew L. Harris, was elected, and succeeded as governor after five months in office on the death of Democrat John M. Pattison. One Republican official wrote to Harding, [...] "Aren't you sorry Dick wouldn't let <b>you</b> <b>run</b> for Lieutenant Governor?" ...|$|E
500|$|Barton {{does not}} believe Hollywood offers the same opportunity. In the film, Los Angeles {{is a world of}} false fronts and phony people. This is evident in an early line of the {{screenplay}} (filmed, but not included in the theatrical release); while informing Barton of Capitol Pictures' offer, his agent tells him: [...] "I'm only asking that your decision be informed by a little realism– [...] if I can use that word and Hollywood in the same breath". Later, as Barton tries to explain why he's staying at the Earle, studio head Jack Lipnick finishes his sentence, recognizing that Barton wants a place that is [...] "less Hollywood". The assumption is that Hollywood is fake and the Earle is genuine. Producer Ben Geisler takes Barton to lunch at a restaurant featuring a mural of the [...] "New York Cafe", a sign of Hollywood's effort to replicate the authenticity of the East Coast. Lipnick's initial overwhelming exuberance is also a façade. Although he begins by telling Barton: [...] "The writer is king here at Capitol Pictures", in the penultimate scene he insists: [...] "If your opinion mattered, then I guess I'd resign and let <b>you</b> <b>run</b> the studio. It doesn't, and you won't, and the lunatics are not going to run this particular asylum".|$|E
