40|$|A resume is a {{marketing}} tool used to highlight your qualifications {{for a job}} or opportunity. Contrary to popular belief, <b>your</b> <b>resume</b> will not get you a job; instead, {{it will be one}} of your most valuable tools used to secure an interview. Resume Basics: 1. Be concise: Generally a resume should be one page in length, if you think <b>your</b> <b>resume</b> should be longer, come see us. Use phrases instead of sentences and use bullets to organize your information. 2. Customize <b>your</b> <b>resume</b> for each audience: Consider starting a Master Resume that includes all of your experience, projects, research etc. When applying, concisely format one page of the most relevant information for <b>your</b> <b>resume.</b> 3. Choose an appropriate format: There are two main types of resumes: Chronological and Functional. Chronological is the most common format and focuses on individual experiences. Sections in a Chronological Resume will vary based on your experience and field; within each section, experience will be listed in order by date with the most recent at the top. Functional resumes focus on skills, instead of job experience. They are often used when experience is limited or outside of the desired field. 4. Do NOT use a template: Using templates and word boxes make it difficult to update <b>your</b> <b>resume...</b>|$|E

40|$|As a {{high school}} student, you may think {{that you do not}} need a resume until you are about to {{graduate}} from college or you begin your post-high school career search. From getting your first full-time job to applying for college and scholarships, a resume is essential because employers, college recruiters and scholarship readers, want to see a brief summary of your abilities, education, and experiences. <b>Your</b> <b>resume</b> should include information that will put you and your abilities in a favorable light and make you stand out from the crowd. It is up to you what you want to include on <b>your</b> <b>resume,</b> the topics below are to give you a starting point for your senior resume. Having a resume in high school is just good sense. You never know when a recruiter at a college fair or a potential employer might request one from you. Remember: <b>Your</b> <b>resume</b> should be visually appealing (no spelling or grammatical errors, do not use too many different font styles and sizes, use headings to cleanly and clearly organize <b>your</b> <b>resume</b> contents).

40|$|A well-written {{cover letter}} {{encourages}} the prospective employer {{to look at}} <b>your</b> <b>resume</b> and bring you in for an interview. You should personalize and target your letter to a particular employer and convey your enthusiasm for the employer and position. A cover letter should state your employment objective. It can also convey information that did not fit on <b>your</b> <b>resume</b> or was not necessarily appropriate for a resume. The goal of the cover letter is to tell the employer why they should hire you. Getting Started As with <b>your</b> <b>resume,</b> a cover letter should be professional in tone, short, concise, and error-free. Remember, you are selling yourself to the employer in your letter and not merely expressing your interest in working for them. There is no “best ” way to write a cover letter, though set forth below are overviews of the paragraphs in a fourparagraph cover letter. If you {{find it difficult to}} start writing, one suggestion is to ignore all conventions of business writing and format—simply write out what you wish you could say. Getting your thoughts on paper is the first step; once your thoughts have been written, you can rephrase them so that they are organized and appropriate for a cover letter. Cover Letter Presentation A cover letter is a professional business letter. The paper should be the same quality as <b>your</b> <b>resume.</b> Similar to <b>your</b> <b>resume,</b> you should use a simple font such as Times New Roman, Arial, or Century Schoolbook (use the same font as on <b>your</b> <b>resume).</b> Font size should range from 11 – 12 point, and the overall letter should not exceed one page...|$|E
