2500|$|After Sharapova {{had beaten}} fellow Russian Anastasia Myskina at the 2004 WTA Tour Championships, Myskina criticized Sharapova's father, saying: [...] "He was just <b>yelling</b> <b>and</b> <b>screaming</b> {{instructions}} {{to her and}} I thought he just might jump right on the court {{at one point in}} the match." [...] At the Fed Cup semifinals two weeks later, Myskina stated she would stop playing for Russia if Sharapova joined the Russian team the following season: [...] "If she joins our team next season you won't see me there for sure. His behaviour is totally incorrect, simply rude. I don't want to be around people like him." [...] Larisa Neiland, assistant to Russia Fed Cup captain Shamil Tarpishchev, added: [...] "Her father's behaviour (at the WTA Tour Championships) was simply outrageous. I just don't see how he could work with the rest of us." [...] However, Tarpishchev himself played down the problem, insisting: [...] "I feel that things will calm down soon and we'll have Myskina, Sharapova, Kuznetsova and everyone else playing for Russia." ...|$|E

However, Clooney continued to describe the event in later interviews, {{as well as the}} cover story of the October 2003 issue of Vanity Fair, in which he states: [...] "I would not stand for him humiliating and <b>yelling</b> <b>and</b> <b>screaming</b> at crew members, who weren't allowed to defend themselves. I don't believe in it and it makes me crazy. So my job was then to humiliate the people who were doing the humiliating." [...] Executive producer and production manager Gregory Goodman later stated about Clooney's comments in the media, [...] "It doesn't reflect well on [...] It's like some stupid sandbox quarrel." [...] In early 2012, Clooney indicated that he and Russell had mended their relationship, saying [...] "We made a really, really great film, and we had a really rough time together, but it's a case of both of us getting older. I really do appreciate the work he continues to do, and I think he appreciates what I'm trying to do." ...|$|E

60|$|Such {{at least}} was the endearing {{experience}} of the companions {{at the end of}} their day's pleasure. Not that it was really the end, for there was the airy swoop homeward in the Elevated train, through all that ugly picturesqueness of bridges and boats and blocks of buildings, with the added interest of seeing the back-flying streets below now full of children let loose from school for the afternoon, and possessing the roadways and sidewalks as if these, too, were common property like the park. It seemed to the companions that the children increased toward the shabbier waterside, and decreased wherever the houses looked better, through that mystical law of population by which poverty is richer than prosperity is in children. They could see them <b>yelling</b> <b>and</b> <b>screaming</b> at their games, though they could not hear them, and they yelled and screamed the louder to the eye because they were visibly for the greatest part boys. If they were the offspring of alien parents, they might be a proof of American decay; but, on the other hand, the preponderance of boys was in repair of that disproportion of the sexes which in the east of these States is such a crying evil.|$|E

60|$|On May 20 {{he was in}} {{a little}} wood, putting up a house instead of one that had been blown down by a hurricane, and he had sent his few {{faithful}} pupils to get grass for the thatch. Nine natives from a village about three hours' walk distant came to the house where his wife was, and asked for him. She said he was in the little wood. They went thither, and while eight hid themselves in the bush, one went forward and asked for some calico. Mr. Gordon took a bit of charcoal and wrote on a bit of wood directions to his wife to give the bearer some cotton, but the man insisted that he must come himself to give out some medicine for a sick man. Mr. Gordon complied, walking in front as far as the place where lay the ambush, when the man struck him with a tomahawk on the spine, and he fell, with a loud scream, while the others leaping out fell upon him with blows that must have destroyed life at once, <b>yelling</b> <b>and</b> <b>screaming</b> over him. Another went up to the house. Mrs. Gordon had come out, asking what the shouts meant. 'Look there!' he said, and as she turned her head, he struck her between the shoulders, and killed her as soon as she had fallen.|$|E

60|$|I only {{killed one}} and wounded two; but my man Friday, taking his aim {{much better than}} I, killed two and wounded three. You may be sure {{they were in a}} dreadful consternation, at, such an {{unexpected}} disaster, and those who had yet escaped our penetrating shot, immediately jumped upon their feet, but were in such a confusion, that they knew not which way to run or look; not knowing from whence their destruction came. We threw down our pieces, and took up others, giving a second dreadful volley; but as they were loaded only with swan shot, or small pistol bullets, we perceived only two of them fall; tho many were wounded, who run <b>yelling</b> <b>and</b> <b>screaming</b> about like mad creatures. 'Now, Friday,' said I, 'lay down your piece, and take up the musket, and follow me.' He did so, with great courage, when showing ourselves to the savages we give a great shout, and made directly to the poor victim, who would have been sacrificed, had not our first fire obliged the butchers, with three others, to jump into a canoe. By my order, Friday fired at them, at which shot I thought he had killed them all, by reason of their falling {{to the bottom of the}} boat; however, he killed two, and mortally wounded a third. In the mean time, I cut the flags that tied the hands and feet of the poor creature, and lifting him up asked him in the Portuguese tongue, What he was? He answered me in Latin, Christiantis; but so very weak and faint, that he could scarce stand or speak. Immediately I gave him a dram; and a piece of bread to cherish him, and asked him, What countryman he was? He said, Hispaniola; and then uttered all the thankfulness imaginable for his deliverance. 'Signior,' said I, with as much Spanish as I was master of, 'let us talk afterwards, but fight now; here, take this sword and pistol, and do what you can.' And, indeed, he did so with much courage and intrepidity, that he cut two of them to pieces in an instant, the savages not having the power to fly for their lives. I ordered Friday to run for those pieces we had left at the tree, which he brought me with great swiftness, and then I gave him my musket, while I loaded the rest. But now their happened a fierce encounter between the Spaniard & one of the savages who had made at him with one of their wooden swords; and though the former was as brave as could be expected, having twice wounded his enemy in the head, yet being weak & faint, the Indian had thrown him upon the ground, & was wrestling my sword out of his hand, which the Spaniard very wisely quiting, drew out his pistol, and shot him through the body before I could come near him, though I was running to his assistance.' As to Friday, he pursued the flying wretches with his hatchet, dispatching three, but the rest were too nimble for him. The Spaniard taking one of the fowling pieces, wounded two, who running into the wood Friday pursued and killed; but the other, notwithstanding his wounds, plunged himself into the sea & swam to those who were left in the canoe; which, with one wounded, were all that escaped out of one and twenty.
