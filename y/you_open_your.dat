25|$|Again, {{suppose it}} were like this: people-seeds drift {{about in the}} air like pollen, and if <b>you</b> 	<b>open</b> <b>your</b> windows, one may drift in and take root in your carpets or upholstery. You don’t want children, so you fix up your windows with fine mesh screens, the very best you can buy. As can happen, however, and on very, very rare {{occasions}} does happen, one of the screens is defective; and a seed drifts in and takes root.|$|E

6000|$|... "No. It's not {{terrible to}} say it--only {{the fact is}} terrible," [...] I went on. I may be wrong. But I swear I'm right. When <b>you</b> <b>opened</b> <b>your</b> coat, showed that bloody breast--well, I'll never forget her eyes.|$|R
50|$|If <b>you</b> cannot <b>open</b> <b>your</b> {{surprised}} eyes to {{the kind}} face.|$|R

6000|$|... "Three pounds, Hassan, silence, {{and good}} day! You'll live longer if <b>you</b> <b>open</b> <b>your</b> windows now and then, {{and get a}} little fresh air, instead of praying {{yourself}} hoarse." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Artillery, too!" [...] exclaimed the captain, his {{military}} pride reviving a little, to unsettle his last convictions of duty. [...] "Did <b>you</b> <b>open</b> <b>your</b> columns, and charge your enemies, in line?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "What {{else would}} you call it, Eugenia? Wouldn't you be ashamed if <b>you</b> <b>opened</b> <b>your</b> Sunday paper and came upon a full page article about your nephew having got {{intoxicated}} at the races and fought a book-maker--having broken up a political meeting--having been sued for breach-of-promise by a barmaid [...] ." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thrums," [...] {{he would}} say persuasively, [...] "Thrums, Thrums. <b>You</b> <b>opens</b> <b>your</b> mouth like this, and shuts it like this, and that's it." [...] Yet when he had coaxed her thus for many days, what does she do but break her long silence with the word [...] "Tommy!" [...] The recoil knocked her over.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{must win}} it, of course. She {{is to be}} won, like any other woman. The fruit won't fall into your mouth merely because <b>you</b> <b>open</b> <b>your</b> lips. You must climb the tree." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What? Can't <b>you</b> <b>open</b> <b>your</b> mouth now? You yelp {{out your}} infernal rot loud enough {{when you are}} drunk. What {{do you mean by}} abusing people in that way?--you old useless boozer, you!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She is a {{beautiful}} woman, nevertheless," [...] continued de Batz with a smile. [...] "During the next act, my good St. Just, I would suggest that <b>you</b> <b>open</b> <b>your</b> eyes {{as well as your}} ears." ...|$|E
500|$|I saw the Statue of Liberty. And I said to myself, [...] "Lady, you're such a beautiful! <b>You</b> <b>opened</b> <b>your</b> {{arms and}} <b>you</b> {{get all the}} foreigners here.

6000|$|... "It {{ought to}} be good, for you beat it up yourself, Tom," [...] cried, Maud. [...] "It was so funny to see you working away, and never {{guessing}} who the cake was for. I perfectly trembled every time <b>you</b> <b>opened</b> <b>your</b> mouth, for fear you 'd ask some question about it. That was the reason Polly preached and I kept talking when she was gone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{tired of}} this, but I'll endure it till one o'clock. Till one o'clock, mind--no longer. If <b>you</b> <b>open</b> <b>your</b> mouth against me only once after that time you can't travel so far but I will find you." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "The {{paper the}} captain {{selected}} for your room," [...] continued Mr. Tredgold, severely, [...] "was decorated with branches {{of an unknown}} flowering shrub, on the top twig of which a humming-bird sat eating a dragonfly.

6000|$|... "And {{leave the}} {{business}} at Frankfort {{to take care of}} itself, at the busiest time of the year!" [...] his father added ironically. [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>open</b> <b>your</b> mouth again, Fritz, put food and drink into it--and confine yourself to that." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{am going}} to run no chances with you," [...] {{continued}} Andy Jimson. [...] "You have got to keep very quiet. Don't <b>you</b> <b>open</b> <b>your</b> mouth once after we get started. I've got a pistol handy, and I {{know how to use}} it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes!' {{said the}} Chief, 'we har! and the wonder is, that a pleeseman an't 'ad in now, {{and we took}} off agen. <b>You</b> can't <b>open</b> <b>your</b> lips here, without a pleeseman.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>you</b> don't <b>open</b> <b>your</b> {{mouth to}} her any oftener {{than you do}} to me, you might stay on the farm a year without her knowing {{what we have been}} doing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'News? I have no news, {{except that}} if <b>you</b> will <b>open</b> <b>your</b> mouth <b>you</b> shall see what dates taste like.' And he plucked a date, {{and put it}} into his father's mouth.|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{is nothing}} to be ashamed of," [...] Captain Holland said. [...] "Rope {{climbing}} is a thing that only comes with practice; and as to nervousness, most landsmen are afraid to trust themselves to a rope at all. Did <b>you</b> <b>open</b> <b>your</b> eyes?" ...|$|E

60|$|No, no! It is no use {{trying to}} get out of it. They measure you, and bang your chest and your back, they look at your eyes and make <b>you</b> <b>open</b> <b>your</b> mouth to look at your teeth, but anyhow they take you away for three years.|$|E
