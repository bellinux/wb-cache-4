[...] Cuse correctly guessed Ken Leung, who had guest starred as one-time character Carter Chong, a young and angry mental patient. [...] In mid-May, they contacted Leung's agent and were informed in July that he was available and interested in working on Lost. [...] To limit the leak of spoilers, Lindelof and Cuse auditioned Leung with a character and scene created specifically for the audition that would not be used in the show but was [...] "analogous to the role [...] really want." [...] Leung believed that he was auditioning for the role of Russell, a [...] "brilliant mathematician" [...] in his late thirties with immense knowledge across various scientific fields, limited social skills and broken personal relationships. [...] Leung was the only actor who tried out for this part, as writers had written the role of Miles for him; had he not accepted the job, the character would have been completely rewritten. [...] The name Miles Straume was simply chosen because the writers thought that [...] "it would be cool if his name sounded like 'maelstrom' [...] ".|$|E

5000|$|The {{doctrine}} of tawhid, {{in the words}} of the prominent Mu’tazili scholar Chief Justice Qadi Abd al-Jabbar (d. 415 AH/1025 AD), is: [...] the knowledge that God, being unique, has attributes that no creature shares with Him. This is explained by the fact <b>that</b> <b>you</b> know <b>that</b> the world has a creator who created it and that: He existed eternally in the past and He cannot perish while we exist after being non-existent and we can perish. And <b>you</b> know <b>that</b> <b>He</b> was and is eternally all-powerful and that impotence is not possible for Him. And <b>you</b> know <b>that</b> <b>He</b> is omniscient of the past and present and that ignorance is not possible for Him. And <b>you</b> know <b>that</b> <b>He</b> knows everything <b>that</b> was, everything that is, and how things that are not would be if they were. And <b>you</b> know <b>that</b> <b>He</b> is eternally in the past and future living, and that calamities and pain are not possible for Him. And <b>you</b> know <b>that</b> <b>He</b> sees visible things, and perceives perceptibles, and <b>that</b> <b>He</b> does not have need of sense organs. And <b>you</b> know <b>that</b> <b>He</b> is eternally past and in future sufficient and it is not possible for Him to be in need. And <b>you</b> know <b>that</b> <b>He</b> is not like physical bodies, and that it is not possible for Him to get up or down, move about, change, be composite, have a form, limbs and body members. And <b>you</b> know <b>that</b> <b>He</b> is not like the accidents of motion, rest, color, food or smells. And <b>you</b> know <b>that</b> <b>He</b> is One throughout eternity and there is no second beside Him, and that everything other than He is contingent, made, dependent, structured, and governed by someone/thing else. Thus, if you know all of <b>that</b> <b>you</b> know the oneness of God.|$|R

Not only did he enjoy it, and plan to enjoy it, he had an insatiable demand, an insatiable {{appetite}} - not only for sodomy, but for killing." [...] Norris further elaborated that Bonin had followed a depressingly familiar routine in his murders of luring or forcing his victim into the van, before overpowering and binding his victim. He would then repeatedly rape his captive between and throughout instances of torture, before finally reaching the [...] "climax of the orgy" [...] by killing his victim. Norris further asserted that Bonin considered murder a group sport, and would typically groom people of a low mentality to participate in many of his murders.|$|E

[...] Cao Cao ignored Xun You's advice and attacked Zhang Xiu at Rang County (穰縣; present-day Dengzhou, Henan).

[...] The aides returned to Charleston and reported this comment to Beauregard. At 1 a.m. on April 12, the aides brought Anderson a message from Beauregard: [...] "If you will state the time which you will evacuate Fort Sumter, and agree in the meantime that you will not use your guns against us unless ours shall be employed against Fort Sumter, we will abstain from opening fire upon you." [...] After consulting with his senior officers, Maj. Anderson replied that he would evacuate Sumter by noon, April 15, unless he received new orders from his government or additional supplies. Col. Chesnut considered this reply to be too conditional and wrote a reply, which he handed to Anderson at 3:20a.m.: [...] "Sir: by authority of Brigadier General Beauregard, commanding the Provisional Forces of the Confederate States, we have the honor to notify <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> will open fire of his batteries on Fort Sumter in one hour from this time."

2500|$|Around 1905, {{before he}} joined the Poporanists, Mihail Sadoveanu was the prime target of Sanielevici's anti-Sămănătorism. The Marxist critic was {{especially}} reductive {{when it came to}} Sadoveanu's [...] "baroque" [...] brand of literary naturalism: [...] "not naturalism, but pure bestiality. Mr. Sadoveanu has the soul of a Wachtmeister. When a Wachtmeister tells <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> 'has lived', it means that he has been to many drunken parties and has had many women". The first (amiable) split between Ibrăileanu and Sanielevici was about their different interpretations of Sadoveanu's stories. Outside commentators were perplexed by the obscure rationale of their debate. According to a 1906 column by writer Marin Simionescu-Râmniceanu: [...] "That which Mr. Sanielevici finds to be poisonous for our society in Sadoveanu's work, Mr. Ibrăileanu will judge to be the absolute opposite. [...] Whatever Curentul Nou has said over one page, regarding Sadoveanu's work, is denied on the other. Wouldn't it then have been better not to have said it at all?" [...] Writing in 2003, literary historian Nicolae Manolescu suggested that the reason was entirely subjective: [...] "It is practically impossible to comprehend for instance why H. Sanielevici found Sadoveanu's prose to be so violent in subject and primitive in style, while [...] Ibrăileanu and others readily viewed it as profoundly balanced and artistic in manner." [...] Jicu is inclined to believe that Sadoveanu was more the [...] "collateral victim" [...] of Sanielevici's attack on Iorga, and that Sanielevici was at his worst in assessing the quality of Sadovenian writings.|$|E
2500|$|One anecdote, {{taken from}} the Purana, narrates that the {{treasurer}} of Svarga (paradise) and god of wealth, Kubera, went one day to Mount Kailash {{in order to receive}} the darshan (vision) of Shiva. Since he was extremely vain, he invited Shiva to a feast in his fabulous city, Alakapuri, so that he could show off to him all of his wealth. Shiva smiled and said to him: [...] "I cannot come, but you can invite my son Ganesha. But I warn <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is a voracious eater." [...] Unperturbed, Kubera felt confident that he could satisfy even the most insatiable appetite, like that of Ganesha, with his opulence. He took the little son of Shiva with him into his great city. There, he offered him a ceremonial bath and dressed him in sumptuous clothing. After these initial rites, the great banquet began. While the servants of Kubera were working themselves to the bone in order to bring the portions, the little Ganesha just continued to eat and eat and eat. His appetite did not decrease even after he had devoured the servings which were destined for the other guests. There was not even time to substitute one plate with another because Ganesha had already devoured everything, and with gestures of impatience, continued waiting for more food. Having devoured everything which had been prepared, Ganesha began eating the decorations, the tableware, the furniture, the chandelier. Terrified, Kubera prostrated himself in front of the little omnivorous one and supplicated him to spare him, at least, the rest of the palace.|$|E
