25|$|Speculating on why Weir did {{not receive}} a medal during the Olympics {{even though he had}} good {{technical}} scores, Claude Mailhot of RDS network said, “This may not be politically correct, but do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> lost points due to his costume and his body language?” Alain Goldberg replied ”They’ll think all the boys who skate will end up like him. It sets a bad example.” Goldberg and Mailhot then made bigoted jokes about how Weir should 'compete in the women’s division'.|$|E
500|$|Lucas North is a main {{character}} in the seventh, eighth, and ninth series; the ninth series reveals that Lucas [...] "isn't who <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> is." [...] Following {{the creation of the}} character by the show's writers, Armitage was chosen early in the casting process, since the producers believed he could carry the mystery of the character. A tentative viewer of Spooks, he was approached for the role following the completion of the second series of Robin Hood, in which he portrayed series regular Sir Guy of Gisbourne. After agreeing to appear in Spooks, Armitage learned how to speak fluent Russian and lost a stone in weight in order to fit the description of his character.|$|E
500|$|Hopps, who had {{previously}} written for animated series such as Buzz Lightyear of Star Command, Justice League, and Darkwing Duck, researched for the episode by re-reading every available comic book that featured Green Goblin. Hopps notes that [...] "you might consider him [...] crazed, but he's truly brilliant and has thought things out far in advance. He's always several steps ahead of where <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> is. So while I'm writing Goblin, I'm always trying {{to keep in mind}} where he's going next." [...] While penning the fight sequence between Goblin and Spider-Man, Hopps paid close attention to brawls detailed in [...] "Catalysts" [...] in order to better grasp [...] "how we could make it different and really up the stakes." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, Chubby!" [...] Then {{she turned}} with that {{sweetish}} smile to Mrs. Morel. [...] "Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> always grumbling, Mrs. Morel?" ...|$|R

500|$|Ford and Goebel both {{served in}} the U.S. Navy during World War II, and after the war, Ford urged Goebel to run for Congress against the incumbent, an isolationist named Barney Jonkman. Goebel {{declined}} to run, but suggested to Ford that, [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> ought to be beaten, why don't you run?" [...] Ford did run for Congress in 1948, and Goebel {{was one of his}} close circle of early supporters, the original Ford-for-Congress group. Ford won the election and won re-election for twelve more terms. In 1960, Goebel was a leader in the movement to nominate Ford as the Vice Presidential candidate on the ticket with Richard Nixon, serving as Chairman of the [...] "Ford for Vice President Committee" [...] at the Republican National Convention in Chicago.|$|E
500|$|Following Ros's {{death in}} the series eight finale, Lucas [...] "sees the team's been {{slightly}} shattered by it" [...] and responds by [...] "trying to pull the team together and aiming {{to be a strong}} figure for Harry." [...] The ninth series reveals a dark secret in Lucas's past that will lead to the [...] "ultimate betrayal." [...] Armitage revealed that Lucas [...] "isn't quite who <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> is." [...] It sees the introduction of a character named Maya, played by Laila Rouass, who is Lucas's old flame and possible first love; she is involved in Lucas's secret. Lucas states that Maya means more to him than his job and reputation. Vaughn would use Maya as a way of controlling him. Armitage also revealed Lucas goes off the radar [...] "quite a lot this series" [...] and behaves [...] "quite strangely." ...|$|E
500|$|According to screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, Sparrow is a trickster {{who uses}} wit and deceit to attain his goals, preferring to end {{disputes}} verbally instead of by force. He walks {{with a slightly}} drunken swagger and has slurred speech and flailing hand gestures. Sparrow is shrewd, calculating, and eccentric. He fools Norrington and his crew to set sail on the royal ship Interceptor, which compels the admiration of Lieutenant Groves as he concedes: [...] "That's {{got to be the}} best pirate I have ever seen". Norrington himself acquiesces to this praise: [...] "So it would seem", in sharp contrast to what he had previously proclaimed: [...] "You are without doubt the worst pirate I have ever heard of". In the third film, while he leaves Beckett's ship stranded and makes off, Lieutenant Groves asks him: [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> plans it all out, or just makes it up as he goes along?" ...|$|E

500|$|Writing for The Washington Post, Allison Stewart {{opined that}} the track {{describes}} an eccentric night of romance, beginning with [...] "a body full of liquor with a cocaine kicker" [...] {{and ending with}} [...] "you and me/Making love like gorillas". She concluded, [...] "for all its awfulness" [...] the song is the [...] "image shifter Mars needs". Idolator's Emily Tan commented [...] "the libidinous lyrics are disguised with epic guitars and Phil Collins-esque heavy drum combinations...strong enough to soundtrack a scene in a drama series". Jason Lipshutz of Billboard magazine similarly felt that the [...] "drums and keyboards are nicely overwhelming, but the overall concept floats {{too far away to}} make a dent on the listener". Day Hyman of Spin thought that the lyrics on the album [...] "desperately needed kick in the pants" [...] mainly noticed on [...] "Gorilla". He also drew comparisons on the [...] "Prince-channeling" [...] vibe. On the critical side, Amy Dawson of Metro described it as a [...] "Phil Collins-esque low point" [...] in the album, [...] "in which the button-eyed singer makes plans to go at it {{in the same way as}} said giant ape, all over a Phil Collins-esque synth/percussion combo backing… but by the time the jungle noises kick in, <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> surely must be in on the joke." ...|$|E
2500|$|The song [...] "Battlefield", {{from the}} This Is My Battlefield 2004 Panzer AG album samples Captain Rhodes asking Sarah in {{reference}} to Miguel's zombie bite: [...] "You {{think he wants to}} walk around after he's dead? <b>You</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> wants to be one of these things?" [...] The line [...] "Sit down or so help me god I'll have you shot" [...] appears once {{near the end of the}} song.|$|E
2500|$|... "One Step Closer" [...] {{is a slow}} tempo song, with Bono's lyrics {{centered}} around traffic images, leading to the singer being stranded on a refuge island. The origins of the song {{go back to the}} All That You Can't Leave Behind sessions. [...] It was revived for Atomic Bomb, with Lanois introducing a pedal steel guitar, in addition to guitars from the Edge and Bono, and musical influences varying from country music to The Velvet Underground making themselves felt. [...] One recording of the song ran for more than 15 minutes, with Bono adding many verses that were subsequently dropped. Jacknife Lee also contributed to the final form of the recording. [...] "One Step Closer" [...] is billed in the album with thanks to Noel Gallagher of Oasis. The title of the song comes from a conversation Bono had with Gallagher about Bono's dying father, Bob Hewson. Bono asked, [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> believes in God?" [...] to which Gallagher replied, [...] "Well, he's one step closer to knowing." [...] Through the end of the Vertigo Tour, the song had never been performed in any U2 concert. The title of the album derives from a lyric in the song [...] "Fast Cars", which was only available on some versions of the album.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> shown {{sense in}} choosin' of her?" [...] pursued Jeff's mother, {{resolute}} {{to find some}} praise of him in Westover's words.|$|R

2500|$|Cao Cao admired Guan Yu's character, {{but he also}} {{sensed that}} Guan had no {{intention}} of serving under him for long. He told Zhang Liao, [...] "Why don't you make use of your friendship with Guan Yu to find out his objective?" [...] When Zhang Liao asked Guan Yu, the latter replied, [...] "I'm aware that Lord Cao treats me very generously. However, I've also received many favours from General Liu and I've sworn to follow him until I die. I cannot break my oath. I'll leave eventually, so you should help me convey my message to Lord Cao." [...] Zhang Liao did so, and Cao Cao was further impressed with Guan Yu. The Fu Zi gave a slightly different account of this incident. It stated that Zhang Liao had a dilemma on whether to convey Guan Yu's message to Cao Cao or not: if he did, Cao Cao might execute Guan Yu; if he did not, he would be failing in his service to Cao Cao. He sighed, [...] "Lord Cao is my superior and is like a father to me; Guan Yu is like a brother to me." [...] He eventually made his decision to tell Cao Cao. Cao Cao said, [...] "A subject who serves a lord but does not forget his origins is truly a man of righteousness. When do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> will leave?" [...] Zhang Liao replied, [...] "Guan Yu has received favours from Your Excellency. He'll most probably leave after he has repaid your kindness." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Oh, don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> changed?' said Mrs. Heep. 'There I must umbly beg {{leave to}} differ from you. Don't {{you see a}} {{thinness}} in him?' ...|$|R
