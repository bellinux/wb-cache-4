2500|$|After tip-off, Troy State scored {{their first}} basket after 54 seconds. Player Paul Bryan later said, jokingly, [...] "It {{was a little}} touch and go there early." [...] Despite their frenetic pace, the Trojans [...] "only" [...] had 15 points after the first three minutes. As the game settled into its soon-to-be record {{breaking}} groove, points came steadily; with 3:14 remaining in the first half, Troy eclipsed the 100-point mark. Guard Tommy Davis said, [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>one</b> guy hitting, then everybody gets in the act. It becomes contagious." [...] At {{the end of the}} first half, the score was 123–53. They made 21 three-pointers in the first 20 minutes, and their 123 points had already broken their own NCAA single half record from the year before (103), which was also set against DeVry.|$|E
2500|$|Surah 27:54-58 {{refers to}} the {{punishment}} that befell the people of Lut: [...] "And (remember) Lut when {{he said to his}} people, 'Do you commit al-Fahishah (evil, great sin, every kind of unlawful sexual intercourse, sodomy) while <b>you</b> <b>see</b> (<b>one</b> another doing evil without any screen) Do you practice your lusts on men instead of women? Nay, but you are a people who behave senselessly.' There was no other answer given by his people except that they said: 'Drive out the family of Loot from your city. Verily, these are men who want to be clean and pure!' So We saved him and his family, except his wife. We destined her to be of those who remained behind. And We rained down on them a rain (of stones). So evil was the rain of those who were warned." [...] Muhammad has also thus said: [...] "Whoever of you finds (someone) doing the deed of the people of Lot, kill the one who does it and the one to whom it is done." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gil Scott-Heron {{was born}} in Chicago, Illinois. His mother, Bobbie Scott-Heron, was an opera singer who {{performed}} with the New York Oratorio Society. Scott-Heron's father, Gil Heron, nicknamed [...] "The Black Arrow", was a Jamaican football player in the 1950s who {{became the first black}} man to play for Celtic Football Club in Glasgow. Gil's parents separated in his early childhood and he was sent to live with his maternal grandmother, Lillie Scott, in Jackson, Tennessee. When Scott-Heron was 12 years old, his grandmother died and he returned to live with his mother in The Bronx in New York City. He enrolled at DeWitt Clinton High School, but later transferred to The Fieldston School after impressing the head of the English department with one of his writings and earning a full scholarship. As one of five black students at the prestigious school, Scott-Heron was faced with alienation and a significant socioeconomic gap. During his admissions interview at Fieldston, an administrator asked him, [...] "'How would you feel if <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>one</b> of your classmates go by in a limousine while you're walking up the hill from the subway?' And [...] said, 'Same way as you. Y'all can't afford no limousine. How do you feel?'" [...] This type of intractable boldness would become a hallmark of Scott-Heron's later recordings.|$|E
