In 1946, Clementine Paddleford, a food writer for the New York Herald Tribune, wrote that “pretty girls” served popovers “unendingly,” dispensing one thousand daily at the Manhattan Candlelight. Paddleford described the restaurant’s salad bar as a special feature and said dinners were “simple, plain-American – good!” Beef, lamb, and calf’s liver were available “plain roasted as <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>at</b> home” or “plain broiled” with “no lathering of strange sauces,” Paddleford said, adding that by this time Murphy was serving a half million diners annually at her two locations.|$|E
2500|$|Mark Kanarick of All Game Guide {{also gave}} Virtual Springfield a {{three out of}} five rating. He praised the game for its {{references}} to the television series, noting that [...] "The inside jokes and story-lines alone make the game worth it for those that are fans. For casual viewers and non-viewers, however, {{there is not enough}} here to warrant purchase of The Simpsons: Virtual Springfield." [...] Kanarick further wrote that while exploring Springfield was fun at times, [...] "it is also very tedious. Reading the map can be a problem, especially for younger kids. If you do not utilize the map to its full extent, you will most likely find yourself lost in the town and unsure of where to go next. Although it is a full town, <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>at</b> times feel very constricted, as you can only change directions at certain corners. The rest of the time you are just moving where the computer is telling you to." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "What were <b>you</b> <b>doing</b> <b>at</b> {{the bottom}} of the ravine?" [...] asked Barney quite suddenly, after the manner of one who administers a third degree.|$|R
6000|$|... "You'll niver see me any plainer than <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>at</b> {{this very}} moment," [...] the old soldier answered, taking a sidelong glance of {{suspicion}} at his companion.|$|E
6000|$|... "You do {{too much}} writing, lad. My head {{would be like to}} go to pieces if I were to sit half the hours that <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>at</b> a desk." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't I? Well, I only know, if {{you slept}} in school, and were a junior, {{you would get}} a proper good licking for going on as <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>at</b> night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A favour, Chapeau; I {{suppose you}} want to go to Echanbroignes already, to tell Michael Stein's pretty daughter, of all the gallant things <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>at</b> Saumur." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now," [...] Sir Giles resumed, [...] "I presume I may {{expect to}} receive an explanation. What does this impropriety mean? What were <b>you</b> <b>doing</b> <b>at</b> the milestone?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are right}} there, Terence; {{but you may}} live a good many years before {{you get a chance}} of calling a whole British army under arms, as <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>at</b> Salamanca." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I think <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> <b>at</b> this moment,' replied Masham; 'and I think,' he continued, smiling, 'that you may {{probably}} continue {{very much}} in love with her, even {{during the rest of the}} week.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then isn't {{that all}} I want?--unless indeed I ought perhaps to ask rather if it isn't all <b>you</b> <b>do!</b> <b>At</b> any rate," [...] said Lord John, [...] "I may {{see you again}} here?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You'll soon {{get used}} to it," [...] said Mr. Jobson, gently. [...] "Look at me! I felt like <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>at</b> first, and now I wouldn't go back to old clothes--and comfort--for anything. You'll get to love them boots.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now," [...] {{cried the}} leopard from his perch, [...] "you'd better {{look out for}} yourselves! You can't laugh <b>at</b> him as <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>at</b> me. The bear has both claws and teeth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will find}} it very lonely there, father; and, of course, we can fit you up a {{laboratory}} here, {{and you can go}} on just the same way as <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>at</b> home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But he'll think me so plain. <b>You</b> <b>did</b> <b>at</b> first, <b>you</b> know. But he won't be uncivil {{enough to}} tell me so, as <b>you</b> <b>did.</b> And Mary is to be married in Easter week? Oh, dear, oh, dear; I shall be so shy among them all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And He {{does the}} best for us, of course. Yet He does seem these last seasons to have kind of lost His grip over the weather. Well, maybe it will {{be made up to}} us this year. And what did <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>at</b> Horndean, mother?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think that}} you know very well," [...] he answered. [...] "I am sure that <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> <b>At</b> St. Étarpe you were content to accept what, believe me, is quite inevitable. Here--well, you have been doing all you can to avoid me, haven't you?" ...|$|E
60|$|You do not come, dearest Fanny, though I am here waiting, and I {{begin to}} be uneasy about <b>you.</b> <b>Do</b> <b>at</b> least write, do. We have been here since Tuesday, and here is Saturday, and every morning {{there has been an}} anxious looking forward for you....|$|E

6000|$|Ah, if <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>at</b> such times, <b>you</b> {{might lead}} him [...] Home by a thread. Good! Again you are smiling: [...] You have no faith in such shrift, and but little [...] In priest or penitent.|$|R
6000|$|As I rose to comply, [...] "Maude" [...] called out: [...] "Mr. Mitchell wishes {{the threads}} {{fastened}} to mama's wrists. He wants you and Mr. Fowler {{to hold them}} the way <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>at</b> Mr. Miller's house." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well, then," [...] said Maggie, pouting. [...] "I {{can say it}} as well as you can. And {{you don't}} mind your stops. For you ought to stop twice as long at a {{semicolon}} as <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>at</b> a comma, and you make the longest stops where there ought to be no stops at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I should rather {{think it}} is," [...] said the earl. [...] "I {{was lucky enough}} to get it early, and it hasn't been moved for thirty years. I like to give it to a man who knows it, as <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> <b>at</b> the first glance. Now there's my friend Johnny there; it's thrown away upon him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pshaw! Living in {{one house}} as <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> <b>at</b> your age I {{would have known}} {{all there was to}} know on such a matter, and yet kept my word. But there, the blood is different, and you are {{somewhat}} over-honest for a lover. Was she frightened for you, now, when that knave made at you with the sword?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Beric {{looked at}} her in surprise. [...] "It is the lady Ennia!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "Why, what are <b>you</b> <b>doing</b> <b>at</b> this time of night in so lonely a place, and without other attendants than this woman?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then, all {{thanks and}} all honor to your generosity, my lord, in {{granting}} us the immunities <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>at</b> {{the outset of}} this voyage. But, my lord, permit me one word more. Is not Oro omnipresent--absolutely every where?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But how are <b>you</b> {{going to}} <b>do</b> that?" [...] the prince asked in surprise. [...] "It {{is one thing}} to slip {{out of the hands of}} Alva's minions as <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>at</b> Brussels, but another thing {{altogether}} to get two women out of prison." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have looked}} up that mining {{property}} in Colorado very carefully, and shall {{go out there}} {{as soon as the}} coming winter is at an end. Perhaps I will take one or all of you with me, but that will depend upon how good <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>at</b> your studies this winter. I shan't take anybody along that can't show a good report." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{know enough}} to be disrespectful!" [...] exclaimed Mrs. Elwell. [...] "I suppose {{you want to go}} to school to idle away your time, as <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>at</b> home--lazy good-for-nothing that you are!" [...] Chester thought of the {{drudgery}} that had been his portion all his life. He resented being called lazy when he was willing enough to work, but he made one more appeal.|$|E
6000|$|... "You're in {{a terrible}} hurry, Mister Peacocke. I don't want to drop in and spoil your little game. You're making money of your little game. I can help you as to {{carrying}} on your little game, better than <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>at</b> present. I don't want to blow upon you. But as you're making money out of it, I'd {{like to make a}} little too. I am precious hard up,--I am." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{it is to}} be hoped you'll put up {{a better}} game than <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>at</b> Townshead's ranch. I was a little sorry for the girl," [...] he said. [...] "Met her once or twice in Vancouver, and she didn't seem well off." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> Uncle Richard?" [...] said Mary, pausing {{about six}} feet away and holding out her hand. [...] "I heard you scolding my poor dad about his bow-window. In fact, you woke me up; and, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> know, you used exactly the same words as <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>at</b> your visit after we came down from London last year." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here, Barrymore," [...] said Sir Henry, sternly; [...] "we {{have made}} up our minds to have the truth out of you, so it will save you trouble to tell it sooner rather than later. Come, now! No lies! What were <b>you</b> <b>doing</b> <b>at</b> that window?" ...|$|R
