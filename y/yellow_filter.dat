500|$|During an 1861 Royal Institution {{lecture on}} colour theory, Maxwell {{presented}} the world's first demonstration of colour photography by this principle of three-colour analysis and synthesis. Thomas Sutton, {{inventor of the}} single-lens reflex camera, took the picture. He photographed a tartan ribbon three times, through red, green, and blue filters, also making a fourth photograph through a <b>yellow</b> <b>filter,</b> which, according to Maxwell's account, was not used in the demonstration. Because Sutton's photographic plates were [...] insensitive to red and barely sensitive to green, {{the results of this}} pioneering experiment were far from perfect. It was remarked in the published account of the lecture that [...] "if the red and green images had been as fully photographed as the blue," [...] it [...] "would have been a truly-coloured image of the riband. By finding photographic materials more sensitive to the less refrangible rays, the representation of the colours of objects might be greatly improved." [...] Researchers in 1961 concluded that the seemingly impossible partial success of the red-filtered exposure was due to ultraviolet light, which is strongly reflected by some red dyes, not entirely blocked by the red filter used, and within the range of sensitivity of the wet collodion process Sutton employed.|$|E
2500|$|The three color {{records are}} stacked as shown at right, with a UV filter on top {{to keep the}} {{non-visible}} ultraviolet radiation from exposing the silver-halide crystals, which are naturally sensitive to UV light. [...] Next are the fast and slow blue-sensitive layers, which, when developed, form the latent image. [...] When the exposed silver-halide crystal is developed, it is coupled with a dye grain of its complementary color. [...] This forms a dye [...] "cloud" [...] (like {{a drop of water}} on a paper towel) and is limited in its growth by development-inhibitor-releasing (DIR) couplers, which also serve to refine the sharpness of the processed image by limiting the size of the dye clouds. The dye clouds formed in the blue layer are actually yellow (the opposite or complementary color to blue). [...] There are two layers to each color; a [...] "fast" [...] and a [...] "slow." [...] The fast layer features larger grains that are more sensitive to light than the slow layer, which has finer grain and is less sensitive to light. [...] Silver-halide crystals are naturally sensitive to blue light, so the blue layers are {{on the top of the}} film and they are followed immediately by a <b>yellow</b> <b>filter,</b> which stops any more blue light from passing through to the green and red layers and biasing those crystals with extra blue exposure. [...] Next are the red-sensitive record (which forms cyan dyes when developed); and, at the bottom, the green-sensitive record, which forms magenta dyes when developed. [...] Each color is separated by a gelatin layer that prevents silver development in one record from causing unwanted dye formation in another. On the back of the film base is an anti-halation layer that absorbs light which would otherwise be weakly reflected back through the film by that surface and create halos of light around bright features in the image. In color film, this backing is [...] "rem-jet", a black-pigmented, non-gelatin layer which is removed in the developing process.|$|E
40|$|The magnocellular system {{plays an}} {{important}} role in visual motion processing, controlling vergence eye movements, and in reading. <b>Yellow</b> <b>filters</b> may boost magnocellular activity by eliminating inhibitory blue input to this pathway. It was found that wearing <b>yellow</b> <b>filters</b> increased motion sensitivity, convergence, and accommodation in many children with reading difficulties, both immediately and after three months using the filters. Motion sensitivity was not increased using control neutral density filters. Moreover, reading-impaired children showed significant gains in reading ability after three months wearing the filters compared with those who had used a placebo. It was concluded that <b>yellow</b> <b>filters</b> can improve magnocellular function permanently. Hence, they should be considered as an alternative to corrective lenses, prisms, or exercises for treating poor convergence and accommodation, and also as an aid for children with reading problems...|$|R

50|$|C-41 film {{consists}} of an acetate or polyester film base, onto which multiple emulsions are coated. Each layer is only sensitive to a certain color of visible light. In the classic illustrative example, there are three emulsions: one is red sensitive, another is green sensitive, and the top is blue-sensitive. Beneath the blue layer is a <b>yellow</b> <b>filter,</b> composed of dyes or colloidal silver. All silver-based photographic emulsions have some sensitivity to blue light, regardless of what other colors they may be sensitized for. This filter layer serves to remove the blue light, which would expose the layers beneath it. Beneath the blue-sensitive layer and the <b>yellow</b> <b>filter</b> are the green and red sensitive layers.|$|E

The effects on log MAR visual acuity, Pelliâ€“Robson contrast sensitivity with and without glare, and reading (measured with MNRead charts) without glare were determined. Results Statistically {{significant differences were found}} between the overall effect of glare and between CPFs for visual acuity and contrast sensitivity.

40|$|There are {{two types}} of Oxford Filter; blue filters enhance short {{wavelength}} light and yel,low enhance long wavelength light. These filters have previously been shown to improve reading performance, vergence eye movements and perception of visual form and motion. In this thesis the effects of such filters were examined in both an unselected primary school population, and in a clinical population of children with identified visual and/or reading difficulties. A school based visual screening study established that just over 40 % of children identified a filter as beneficial when viewing text. These children reported a significantly higher number of visual symptoms and had significantly reduced convergence and accommodation eye movements compared to non-filter choosers. A further trial of filter use revealed that those using blue filters made significant improvements in accommodative function and in spelling ability. A cross-over, randomised controlled trial was conducted in the clinical sample with psychometric, orthoptic and psychophysical assessments administered before and after filter use. Poor readers made significant improvements in reading following filter use, but a smaller dyslexic group were not found to improve their reading. Performance on a Matrices task significantly improved after using <b>yellow</b> <b>filters</b> specifically. There was also evidence that children with reduced saccades improved their spelling with the use of <b>yellow</b> <b>filters,</b> but had reduced spelling following blue use. Although filters impacted upon both orthoptic and literacy measures these improvements appear not to be causally linked. A random dot kinematogram task (RDK) revealed a correlation between magnocellular functioning under blue and yellow lighting conditions and reading; lower reading was associated with poorer RDK thresholds. This association was specific to reading and not evident in relation to dyslexia. Visual search accuracy was also shown to improve significantly after the use of blue and <b>yellow</b> <b>filters.</b> Together these findings have implications for the treatment of orthoptic abnormalities and literacy performance.

50|$|At {{the end of}} World War II Japan {{produced}} simple, {{tiny and}} inexpensive Hit-type cameras designed for the war-torn and destitute home market (see image). The Petie camera was created under similar conditions in post-war Germany. These cameras used 16mm film, against the 17.5mm film of the Japanese cameras, but both used paper-backed film and created 14mm square images. The Petie had a 20mm (f9.0) fixed-focus lens and a shutter speed set at 1/50 sec. The 1955 model came with a meniscus lens, later replaced with an achromatic lens. It came with accessories such as a closeup lens, <b>yellow</b> <b>filter,</b> lens hood, table top tripod, and case. All subsequent Kunik models were based on this one.|$|E
50|$|In 1873, Hermann Wilhelm Vogel {{discovered}} that the spectral sensitivity could be extended to green and yellow light by adding very small quantities of certain dyes to the emulsion. The instability of early sensitizing dyes and their tendency to rapidly cause fogging initially confined their use to the laboratory, but in 1883 the first commercially dye-sensitized plates appeared on the market. These early products, described as isochromatic or orthochromatic depending on the manufacturer, made possible a more accurate rendering of colored subject matter into a black-and-white image. Because they were still disproportionately sensitive to blue, {{the use of a}} <b>yellow</b> <b>filter</b> and a consequently longer exposure time were required {{to take full advantage of}} their extended sensitivity.|$|E

50|$|The film {{cassette}} system was redesigned {{but it was}} only with the Robot IIa launched in 1951 that film could accept a standard 35 mm cassette. The special Robot cassettes type-N continued their role for take up. A small bakelite box was sold to allow people to rewind colour film into the original cassettes as demanded by the film processing companies. The camera was synchronized for flash. The swinging viewfinder was retained but now operated by a lever rather than moving the entire housing. Both the deep purple filter and the <b>yellow</b> <b>filter</b> were eliminated in the redesign. Some versions were available with a double wind motor which could expose 50 frames.

50|$|Color {{infrared}} transparency {{films have}} three sensitized layers that, {{because of the}} way the dyes are coupled to these layers, reproduce infrared as red, red as green, and green as blue. All three layers are sensitive to blue so the film must be used with a <b>yellow</b> <b>filter,</b> since this will block blue light but allow the remaining colors to reach the film. The health of foliage can be determined from the relative strengths of green and infrared light reflected; this shows in color infrared as a shift from red (healthy) towards magenta (unhealthy). Early color infrared films were developed in the older E-4 process, but Kodak later manufactured a color transparency film that could be developed in standard E-6 chemistry, although more accurate results were obtained by developing using the AR-5 process. In general, color infrared does not need to be refocused to the infrared index mark on the lens.|$|E

25|$|Both {{types of}} {{melanophore}} {{are important in}} physiological colour change. Flat dermal melanophores often overlay other chromatophores, so when the pigment is dispersed throughout the cell the skin appears dark.

Likewise, after melanin aggregation in DCUs, the skin appears green through xanthophore (<b>yellow)</b> <b>filtering</b> of scattered light from the iridophore layer. On the dispersion of melanin, the light is no longer scattered and the skin appears dark. As the other biochromatic chromatophores are also capable of pigment translocation, animals with multiple chromatophore types can generate a spectacular array of skin colours by making good use of the divisional effect.|$|R
