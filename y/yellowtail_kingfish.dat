25|$|The blacktip trevally, Caranx heberi (also {{known as}} the blacktip {{kingfish}} and <b>yellowtail</b> <b>kingfish),</b> is a species of large marine fish classified in the jack family Carangidae. The blacktip trevally is distributed throughout the tropical to subtropical Indian and West Pacific Oceans, ranging from South Africa {{in the west to}} Fiji, Japan and northern Australia in the east. It inhabits coastal waters throughout its range, preferring moderately deep clear waters over rocky and coral reefs. The blacktip trevally is easily distinguished by its yellow fins and a dark upper caudal fin lobe which gives the species its common name, as well as a host of other anatomical features. The species is known to reach a maximum size of 1 m. It is a benthopelagic predator, commonly forming small shoals where it takes a variety of fishes, cephalopods and crustaceans as prey. Little is known of reproduction in the species, and spawning is assumed to take place in more tropical regions of its range, with juveniles known to inhabit bays and large estuaries. Blacktip trevally are often caught using hook and line and various nets in commercial fisheries although don't make up {{a large part of the}} market. They are also popular with anglers due to their fighting ability and decent table qualities.|$|E

50|$|This {{omission}} of the aquaculture industry from mandatory reporting is significant for Spencer Gulf, South Australia. In this region, {{southern bluefin tuna}} and <b>yellowtail</b> <b>kingfish</b> sea-cage aquaculture are the two largest industrial contributors of nitrogenous nutrient pollution to the marine environment. The Spencer Gulf is particularly vulnerable to impacts because its water exchange with the ocean is constrained and the waters are naturally very low in nutrients by world standards. The existing marine communities have evolved to these unique circumstances, and are therefore particularly susceptible to changes in their environment. Iconic marine species of the region include the giant Australian cuttlefish and the little penguin, {{both of which are}} in decline.|$|E
5000|$|The {{economy is}} based on the huge grain-handling {{facilities}} (with a total capacity of over 337,500 tonnes), the canning and fish processing works, lambs, wool and beef, and tuna farming for the Japanese market. Home of Australia's largest commercial fishing fleet, Port Lincoln now has a thriving aquaculture industry that farms the following species: tuna, <b>yellowtail</b> <b>kingfish,</b> abalone, mussels, oysters, and experimental farming in seahorses and spiny lobsters. Before the advent of aquaculture, the main fishing was for Southern bluefin tuna. Frank Moorhouse recommended the South Australian government loan the Haldane family 20,000 pounds which they used to build a super vessel. The MFV Tacoma was Australia's first purpose-built tuna fishing vessel. It revolutionised the industry and began catching bluefin tuna off the coast of Port Lincoln in the early 1950s.|$|E
50|$|The {{shrimp scad}} (Alepes djedaba) (also {{known as the}} slender <b>yellowtail</b> <b>kingfish),</b> is a species of {{widespread}} tropical marine fish of the jack family, Carangidae.

The species is commonly found on inshore reefs and sandy substrates. It has the common body profile of a scad, and may be difficult to differentiate from others in the genus Alepes. It is one of the larger scads, growing to 40 cm, but often is encountered at much smaller sizes. The shrimp scad often forms large schools, and is carnivorous, consuming a variety of crustaceans and small fish. It is of moderate importance to fisheries throughout its range.|$|E

40|$|This study {{compared}} the mass-specific routine metabolic rate (RMR) of similar sized mulloway (Argyrosomus japonicus), a sedentary species, and <b>yellowtail</b> <b>kingfish</b> (Seriola lalandi), a highly active species, acclimated {{at one of}} several temperatures ranging from 10 – 35 °C. Respirometry {{was carried out in}} an open-top static system and RMR corrected for seawater–atmosphere O 2 exchange using mass-balance equations. For both species RMR increased linearly with increasing temperature (T). RMR for mulloway was 5. 78 T − 29. 0 mg O 2 kg− 0. 8 h− 1 and for <b>yellowtail</b> <b>kingfish</b> was 12. 11 T − 39. 40 mg O 2 kg− 0. 8 h− 1. The factorial difference in RMR between mulloway and <b>yellowtail</b> <b>kingfish</b> ranged from 2. 8 to 2. 2 depending on temperature. The energetic cost of routine activity can be described as a function of temperature for mulloway as 1. 93 T − 9. 68 kJ kg− 0. 8 day− 1 and for <b>yellowtail</b> <b>kingfish</b> as 4. 04 T − 13. 14 kJ kg− 0. 8 day− 1. Over the full range of temperatures tested Q 10 values were approximately 2 for both species while Q 10 responses at each temperature increment varied considerably with mulloway and <b>yellowtail</b> <b>kingfish</b> displaying thermosensitivities indicative of each species respective niche habitat. RMR for mulloway was least thermally dependent at 28. 5 °C and for <b>yellowtail</b> <b>kingfish</b> at 22. 8 °C.

The basal unsupplemented diet resulted in significantly lower weight gain, red blood cell glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and bactericidal activities than the supplemented diets. Muscle Se concentration was increased by Se supplementation from SeCys, SeMet or Se-yeast, but not selenite. There {{was no difference in}} GPx activity of fish fed with any supplemented diets. The bioavailability of Se from SeMet and Se-yeast was similar for all measurements. The most digestible sources of Se were from SeMet and Se-yeast, whereas the least was from fishmeal.
