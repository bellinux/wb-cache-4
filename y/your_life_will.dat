500|$|The lyrical meaning behind [...] "Give It Away" [...] is {{centered}} on the philosophy of selflessness and altruistic behavior. The song is titled after its most prevalent lyrical phrase [...] "give it away", which is taken from an experience Kiedis had with his former girlfriend—punk rock singer Nina Hagen—in the early 1980s. Hagen was several years Kiedis' senior and became a role-model during his drug addiction to heroin: [...] "she realized how young and inexperienced I was then, so she was always passing on gems to me, not in a preachy way, just by seizing on opportunities." [...] When Kiedis was looking through her closet he came across a jacket he liked, and commented to Hagen that it was [...] "really cool". Upon expressing this, Hagen immediately told him to keep it. Her reasoning behind this selflessness was due to an attempt to constantly make her life more enjoyable, and explained to Kiedis that [...] "if you have a closet full of clothes {{and you try to}} keep them all, <b>your</b> <b>life</b> <b>will</b> get very small. But if you have a full closet and someone sees something they like, if you give it to them, the world is a better place." ...|$|E

This very night <b>your</b> <b>life</b> <b>will</b> be {{required}} of you. Then who will get all that you have prepared for yourself?’" [...] – Luke 12:16–20.|$|E
2500|$|Newman & Newman also {{proposed}} a ninth stage of life, Elderhood. Elderhood refers to {{those individuals who}} live past the life expectancy of their birth cohorts. There are {{two different types of}} people described in this stage of life. [...] The [...] "young old" [...] are the healthy individuals who can function on their own without assistance and can complete their daily tasks independently. The [...] "old old" [...] are those who depend on specific services due to declining health or diseases. This period of life is characterized as a period of [...] "immortality vs. extinction." [...] Immortality is the belief that <b>your</b> <b>life</b> <b>will</b> go on past death, some examples are an afterlife or living on through one's family. Extinction refers to feeling as if life has no purpose.|$|E

2500|$|The LDS temple rituals {{formerly}} {{provided an}} example in which capital punishment is contemplated for violation of historical blood oaths in the Endowment ritual. The blood oaths in the ceremony related to protecting the ritual's secrecy. In {{keeping with the}} idea that grievous crimes must be answered with bloodshed and that blood atonement should be voluntary, participants made an oath that rather than ever revealing the secret gestures of the ceremony, they would rather have [...] "my throat ... be cut from ear to ear, and my tongue torn out by its roots"; [...] "our breasts ... be torn open, our hearts and vitals torn out and given to the birds of the air and the beasts of the field"; [...] "your body ... be cut asunder and all your bowels gush out" [...] showing an entire refusal to accept the promises made in the washing and anointing ordinances. The gory wording was removed early in the 20th century and changed to a less explicit reference to [...] "different ways in which life may be taken." [...] Vestigial accompanying suggestive gestures were removed by the LDS Church in 1990 [...] However the temple ceremony still states that [...] "under no condition, even at the peril of <b>your</b> <b>life,</b> <b>will</b> you ever divulge" [...] information regarding the rituals. There are no documented instances of a person who has been killed for violating these oaths of secrecy.|$|E
2500|$|For Kierkegaard, true {{individuality}} {{is called}} selfhood. Becoming {{aware of our}} true self is our true task and endeavor in life—it is an ethical imperative, as well as preparatory to a true religious understanding. Individuals can exist {{at a level that}} is less than true selfhood. We can live, for example, simply in terms of our pleasures—our immediate satisfaction of desires, propensities, or distractions. In this way, we glide through life without direction or purpose. To have a direction, we must have a purpose that defines for us the meaning of our lives. Kierkegaard puts it this way in Either/Or, Here, then, I have your view of life, and, believe me, much of <b>your</b> <b>life</b> <b>will</b> become clear to you if you will consider it along with me as thought-despair. You are a hater of activity in life-quite appropriately, because {{if there is to be}} meaning in it life must have continuity, and this your life does not have. You keep busy with your studies, to be sure; you are even diligent; but it is only for your sake, and it is done with as little teleology as possible. Moreover, you are unoccupied; like the laborers in the Gospel standing idle in the marketplace, you stick your hands in your pocket and contemplate life. Now you rest in despair. Nothing concerns you; you step aside for nothing; “If someone threw a roof tile down I would still not step aside.” You are like a dying person. You die daily, not in the profound, earnest sense in which one usually understands these words, but life has lost its reality and you “Always count the days of your life from one termination-notice to the next.” You let everything pass you by; nothing makes any impact. But then something suddenly comes along that grips you, an idea, a situation, a young girl’s smile, and now you are “involved,” for just on certain occasions you are not “involved,” so at other times you are “at your service” in every way. Wherever there is something going on you join in. You behave in life as you usually do in a crowd. “You work yourself into the tightest group, see to it, if possible, to get yourself shoved up over the others so that you come to be above them, and as soon as you are up there you make yourself as comfortable as possible, and in this way you let yourself be carried through life.” But when the crowd is gone, when the event is over, you again stand on the street corner and look at the world.
