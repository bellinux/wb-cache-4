To gain the best results on so little rehearsal, Wood developed two facets of his conducting that remained his trademark throughout his career. First, he bought sets of the orchestral parts and marked them all with minutely detailed instructions to the players; secondly he developed a clear and expressive conducting technique. An orchestral cellist wrote that [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>watched</b> him, you couldn't come in wrong." [...] The violist Bernard Shore wrote, [...] "You may be reading at sight in public, but you can't possibly go wrong with that stick in front of you". Thirty-five years after Wood's death, André Previn recounted a story {{by one of his}} players who recalled that Wood [...] "had everything planned out and timed to the minute ... at 10a.m. precisely his baton went down. You learned things so thoroughly with him, but in the most economical time." ...|$|E
