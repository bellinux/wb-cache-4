2500|$|Most reviewers {{found its}} premise to be interesting, {{but there is}} no {{consensus}} on Esuno's ability to explore it properly. While Ash Brown of Experiments in Manga concluded [...] "Esuno does some interesting things with it", Shaenon Garrity wrote for About.com that [...] "The concept of urban legends coming to life is intriguing, but it's been done better—with creepier creatures, more atmospheric artwork, and cleverer twists on the basic premise—in manga like Eiji Otsuka's and Housui Yamazaki's Kurosagi Corpse Delivery Service and CLAMP's xxxHolic." [...] Thomas Zoth of Mania considered the first volume [...] "fails {{to take full advantage of}} its potential" [...] because of its episodic nature and lack of characters development. In a review of the whole series, Richard Eisenbeis of Kotaku dubbed it [...] "great fun" [...] and said it [...] "gets a lot of mileage out of its premise", praising how it interchanges between horror, action, comedy and romance and how in [...] "each case <b>you</b> <b>learn</b> <b>about</b> a different Japanese urban legend and get hints about the deeper motivations and personal histories of each of the three main characters." [...] Both Carlo Santos of Anime News Network and Chris Zimmerman of Comic Book Bin also praised its mix of action and horror, and Santos called it [...] "the perfect horror-suspense blend". Lori Henderson of Manga Xanadu said [...] "it's the human elements of the stories, and their resolutions that [...] found to be the most interesting". Oliver Ho of PopMatters considered it is full of aspects that were worth [...] "a ponderous and academic exercise", saying that the series [...] "seems to be a meditation ... on the relationship between storytelling and psychology." [...] He compared the fact that in the manga [...] "characters must confront personal demons and fears in order to overcome evil spirits" [...] to an affirmation by Bruno Bettelheim's on The Uses of Enchantment, where he writes that [...] "a myth, like a fairy tale, may express an inner conflict in symbolic form and suggest how it may be solved." ...|$|E

For example, if <b>you</b> have already <b>learned</b> <b>about</b> proactive interference and recently <b>learned</b> new information <b>about</b> retroactive interference, the knowledge <b>you</b> <b>learned</b> <b>about</b> retroactive interference has the tendency to impede the retrieval of the knowledge of proactive interference.|$|R

6000|$|Of Jess {{they heard}} but little. She wrote every week, it is true, and gave an {{accurate}} account {{of all that}} was going on at Pretoria and of her daily doings, but {{she was one of those}} people whose letters tell one absolutely nothing of themselves and of what is passing in their minds. They ought to have been headed [...] "Our Pretoria Letter," [...] as Bessie said disgustedly after reading through three sheets in Jess's curious, upright handwriting. [...] "Once you lose sight of Jess," [...] she went on, [...] "she might as well be dead for all <b>you</b> <b>learn</b> <b>about</b> her. Not that one learns very much when she is here," [...] she added reflectively.|$|E

What earthly thing do <b>you</b> <b>learn</b> <b>about</b> people by meeting {{them in a}} general crush, where all are coming, going, laughing, talking, and looking at each other? No person of common sense ever puts forth any idea he cares twopence about, under such circumstances; all that is {{exchanged}} is a certain set of commonplaces and platitudes which people keep for parties, {{just as they do}} their kid gloves and finery. Now there are our neighbors, the Browns. When they drop in of an evening, she knitting, and he with the last article in the paper, she really comes out {{with a great deal of}} fresh, lively, earnest, original talk. We have a good time, and I like her so much that it quite verges on loving; but see her in a party, when she manifests herself over five or six flounces of pink silk and a perfect egg-froth of tulle, her head adorned with a thicket of crêped hair and roses, and it is plain at first view that talking with her is quite out of the question. What has been done to her head on the outside has evidently had some effect within, for she is no longer the Mrs. Brown you knew in her every-day dress, but Mrs. Brown in a party state of mind, and too distracted to think of anything in particular. She has a few words that she answers to everything you say, as for example, 'Oh, very!' 'Certainly!' 'How extraordinary!' 'So happy to,' etc. The fact is, that she has come into a state in which any real communication with her mind and character must be suspended till the party is over and she is rested. Now I like society, which is the reason why I hate parties." ...|$|E

5000|$|She has {{recalled}} {{this period}} of her career as essential to her development as a fashion journalist. [...] I was a reporter. I was reporting on the lingerie business and perfume launches — what everybody at Women's Wear Daily has to start off with. That's where <b>you</b> <b>learn</b> <b>about</b> the industry; that's the baptism by fire. <b>You</b> <b>learn</b> <b>about</b> fabrics, you have to cover Premiere Vision, which is the big fabric fair in Paris, {{and you have to}} figure out who the perfume nose is at Christian Dior and the difference between the fragrances. You have to learn a lot about the people and processes of each industry within the fashion industry. And that's the best way to learn about fashion.

Its newsroom budget is less than $25,000 a month. It has but 19 editorial staff; it has faced repeated attacks from regime-allied oligarchs. The fact its reporting survives at all, let alone flourishes, comes down to the unlikeliest of pairings: a journalist from Minnesota and an Anglo-Pakistani billionaire. Each has his own reasons for loving Ukraine, and the Post brought them together." ...|$|E

I was soon being asked to write pieces and conduct those works with the groups that commissioned them. Through conducting, <b>you</b> <b>learn</b> <b>about</b> what works in composition.

5000|$|The {{timing of}} {{the events in the}} series and novel differ considerably. The novel begins in 1886 and the series begins in 1874. The writers of the series {{understood}} how difficult it would be to present the series in the order that events take place in the novel. Producer Sita Williams stated that, [...] "The novels actually start with the engagement of June to Bosinney, {{in the middle of the}} story. <b>You</b> <b>learn</b> <b>about</b> Soames' wooing of Irene and about Young Jolyon's affair with the governess, Hélène, through the gossip and memories of the other characters. It's great for a novel, but not for TV. This isn't like adapting Dickens, who wrote perfect, straightforward, linear narratives. Galsworthy is more complicated than that. So we had to look at the back story and tease out the important things and put them on screen." ...|$|E
