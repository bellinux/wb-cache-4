40|$|Abstract: Privacy {{preferences}} are the handling rules and constraints under which a data subject allows {{a third party}} to process, store, and use his personal data. We have analysed Facebook and show how the Social Network System fails to collect, manage, and hand-over to third-parties user’s consent. Todays technical solutions of collecting the consent on the Internet can be argued to fullfil the regulatory requirements of an informed consent to the service’s Privacy Policy and Terms of Service. We found no change in Facebook’s processes for collecting and managing user consent from 2009 to 2011. The technical solutions used today neither allow to manage, thus change this consent over time, nor allow to hand-over the consent to a third party. We sketch one technical solution, which lends a lot from public key infrastructures. A social network is already trusted by users to keep or federate their data. Hence, we describe the next step of Social Networks becoming an authority and sign the consent collected from its users to making the available data verifiable for third-parties. Better yet, if <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>trust</b> the Social Network a user himself can run his own certificate authority {{or a group of}} users can provide one as a community service. ...|$|R

40|$|It {{seems to}} be a {{generally}} acknowledged fact that you should never trust a computer and that you should trust the person operating the computer even less. This in particular becomes a problem when the party that <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>trust</b> is one which is separated from you and is one on which you depend, e. g. because that party is the holder of some data or some capability that you need in order to operate correctly. How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> perform a given task involving interaction with other parties while allowing these parties a minimal influence on you and, if privacy is an issue, allowing them to learn as little about you as possible. This is the general problem of secure multiparty computation. The usual way of formalizing the problem is to say that a number of parties who <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>trust</b> each other wish to compute some function of their local inputs, while keeping their inputs as secret as possible and guaranteeing the correctness of the output. Both goals should be obtained even if some parties stop participating or some malevolent coalition of the parties start deviating arbitrarily from the agreed protocol. The task is further {{complicated by the fact that}} besides their mutual distrust, nor do the parties trust the channels by which they communicate. A general solution to the secure multiparty computation problem is a compiler which given any feasible function describes an e#cient protocol which allows the parties to compute the function securely on their local inputs over an open network...|$|R

5000|$|Early in {{the reign}} of Emperor Gaozu's son and {{successor}} Emperor Taizong, Lu Chengqing was serving as the census officer for the commandant at Qin Prefecture (秦州, roughly modern Tianshui, Gansu), when he {{had an opportunity to}} report to Emperor Taizong the status of military affairs west of the Yellow River (i.e., in modern central Gansu). Emperor Taizong was impressed by the clarity of his report, and promoted him to be a low-level official at the ministry of civil service. He was later promoted to by the deputy minister of census. On one occasion, when Emperor Taizong asked about historical population counts, Lu discussed historical population counts all the way from Xia Dynasty and Shang Dynasty, down to Tang's immediate predecessors Northern Zhou and Sui. Emperor Taizong was impressed, and soon made him the deputy minister of defense but further also made him in charge of civil service matters. Lu initially declined, stating, [...] "Civil service matters should {{be in the hands of}} the minister of civil service, and for me to handle them would be to exceed my authorities." [...] Emperor Taizong insisted, stating, [...] "I <b>trust</b> <b>you.</b> Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>trust</b> yourself?"

5000|$|Taken {{together}} in the model of Information Theory, information is what <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> expect and <b>trust</b> is what you know. Linking both concepts, trust is seen as qualified reliance on received information. In terms of trusted systems, an assertion of trust cannot {{be based on the}} record itself, but on information from other information channels. The deepening of these questions leads to complex conceptions of trust which have been thoroughly studied in the context of business relationships. It also leads to conceptions of information where the [...] "quality" [...] of information integrates trust or trustworthiness {{in the structure of the}} information itself and of the information system(s) in which it is conceived: higher quality in terms of particular definitions of accuracy and precision means higher trustworthiness.|$|R

In 1444, Mark of Ephesus on his deathbed praised Gennadius's irreconcilable attitude towards the Latins and the union. It was to Gennadius that the angry people went after seeing the Uniate services in the great church of Hagia Sophia. It is said that he hid himself, but left a notice on the door of his cell: [...] "O unhappy Romans Byzantines, why have you forsaken the truth?

However, on 18 December, the Country Party leader and Deputy Prime Minister John McEwen announced that if McMahon were named the new Liberal leader, {{he and his}} party would not serve under him. His reasons were never stated publicly, but in a private meeting with McMahon, he said [...] "I will not serve under <b>you</b> because I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>trust</b> you". McEwen's shock declaration triggered a leadership crisis within the Liberal Party; even more significantly, it raised {{the threat of a}} possible breaking of the Coalition, which would spell electoral disaster for the Liberals. Up to that time, the Liberals had never won enough seats in any House of Representatives election to be able to govern without Country Party support. Indeed, since the Coalition's formation in 1923, the major non-Labor party had only been able to govern alone once, during Joseph Lyons' first ministry—and even then, Lyons' United Australia Party had come up four seats short of a majority and needed confidence and supply support from the Country Party to govern.|$|R
5000|$|Martin Luther {{explained}} that this commandment is given “first {{of all that}} every one shall help his neighbor to secure his rights, and {{not allow them to}} be hindered or twisted, but shall promote and strictly maintain them, no matter whether he be judge or witness.” Luther also asserted that this command extends to the spiritual jurisdiction and prohibited slander against preachers and Christians by calling them heretics, apostates, seditious, wicked, etc. Thirdly, he described the commandment against false witness to prohibit the public judgment and reproof of his neighbor. One can indeed see and hear the neighbor sin, but one has no command to report it to others. If one judges and passes sentence, one falls into a sin which is greater than his (except for judges, parents, and preachers.) Over and above our own body, spouse, and temporal possessions, we have yet another treasure, namely, honor and good report illustrious testimony of an upright and unsullied name and reputation, with which we cannot dispense. For it is intolerable to live among men in open shame and general contempt. Therefore God wishes the reputation, good name, and upright character of our neighbor to be taken away or diminished as little as his money and possessions, that every one may stand in his integrity before wife, children, servants, and neighbors. And in the first place, we take the plainest meaning of this commandment according to the words (Thou shalt not bear false witness), as pertaining to the public courts of justice, where a poor innocent man is accused and oppressed by false witnesses in order to be punished in his body, property, or honor. [...] Martin Luther, The Large Catechism Slanderers are not content with knowing a thing, but “proceed to assume jurisdiction, and when they know a slight offense of another, carry it into every corner, and are delighted and tickled that they can stir up another's displeasure baseness, as swine roll themselves in the dirt and root in it with the snout.” Luther describes this as meddling with the judgment and office of God, and pronouncing sentence and punishment with the most severe verdict. Without wielding the sword, the slanderer employs a poisonous tongue to the shame and hurt of your neighbor. [...] God therefore would have it prohibited that any one speak evil of another even though he be guilty, and the latter know it right well; much less if he <b>do</b> <b>not</b> know it, and have it only from hearsay. But you say: Shall I not say it if it be the truth? Answer: Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> make accusation to regular judges? Ah, I cannot prove it publicly, and hence I might be silenced and turned away in a harsh manner the penalty of a false accusation. [...] "Ah, indeed, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> smell the roast?" [...] If <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>trust</b> yourself to stand before the proper authorities and to make answer, then hold your tongue. But if you know it, know it for yourself and not for another. For if you tell it to others, although it be true, you will appear as a liar, because you cannot prove it, and you are, besides acting like a knave. For we ought never to deprive any one of his honor or good name unless it be first taken away from him publicly. [...] Martin Luther, The Large Catechism [...] Matthew Henry taught that the prohibition against false witness concerns our own and our neighbor’s good name. “Thou shalt not bear false witness” forbids: “1. Speaking falsely in any matter, lying, equivocating, and any way devising and designing to deceive our neighbor. 2. Speaking unjustly against our neighbor, to the prejudice of his reputation; and (which involves the guilty of both). 3. Bearing false witness against him, laying to his charge things that he knows not, either judicially, upon oath (by which the third commandment, and the sixth and eighth, as well as this, are broken), or extrajudicially, in common converse, slandering, backbiting, tale-bearing, aggravating what is done amiss and making it worse than it is, and any way endeavoring to raise our own reputation upon the ruin of our neighbor’s." ...|$|R
