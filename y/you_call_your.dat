500|$|Gandhi's views {{came under}} heavy {{criticism}} in Britain {{when it was}} under attack from Nazi Germany, and later when the Holocaust was revealed. He told the British people in 1940, [...] "I {{would like you to}} lay down the arms you have as being useless for saving you or humanity. You will invite Herr Hitler and Signor Mussolini to take what they want of the countries <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>your</b> possessions... If these gentlemen choose to occupy your homes, you will vacate them. If they do not give you free passage out, you will allow yourselves, man, woman, and child, to be slaughtered, but you will refuse to owe allegiance to them."

500|$|Filming for Crossroads {{initiated}} in March 2001 in Baton Rouge and Hammond, Louisiana, near Spears' hometown. Due {{to the fact}} that Spears was also recording her third studio album along with the film's production, filming only wrapped up after six months. Additional scenes were filmed in Los Angeles, California. Crossroads had a total budget of $10 million; a relatively low budget by industry standards. According to the Louisiana Film and Video Commission, the film was originally titled What Friends are For. Spears described it as a teen movie that deals with real issues that normal teenagers live on a daily basis. She continued to explain the film's content, saying that it [...] "is about this journey that the three of us best friends take, finding ourselves and what we want out of life and getting our friendship back. Friends are all you have {{at the end of the}} day. When your boyfriend breaks up with you, who do <b>you</b> <b>call?</b> <b>Your</b> girlfriend. I just love that message." ...|$|E

Users can opt out from most of this data collection, but telemetry data for error reporting and usage is also sent to Microsoft, and this cannot be disabled on non-Enterprise versions of Windows10.

2500|$|The authors {{argue that}} a major factor for Israel's {{economic}} growth {{can be found in}} the culture of the Israel Defense Forces, in which service is mandatory for most young Israelis. The authors believe that IDF service provides potential entrepreneurs with the opportunities to develop a wide array of skills and contacts. They also believe that IDF service provides experience exerting responsibility in a relatively un-hierarchical environment where creativity and intelligence are highly valued. IDF soldiers [...] "have minimal guidance from the top, and are expected to improvise, even if this means breaking some rules.
