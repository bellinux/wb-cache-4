50|$|Yemen's {{currency}} is the <b>Yemeni</b> <b>riyal</b> (YR), which was floated {{on the open}} market in July 1996. Periodic intervention by the Central Bank of Yemen has enabled the riyal to gradually depreciate approximately 4 percent per year since 1999. Its valued averaged YR191.5 per US$1 in 2005, and has averaged YR197.5 in 2006. In late November 2006, the exchange rate was about YR198 per US$1.|$|E
50|$|During {{the years}} {{immediately}} following unification (1990-96), Yemen experienced a very high average rate of inflationâ€”40 percent. Economic reforms brought this rate down to only 5.4 percent in 1997, but high oil prices and cuts in the fuel subsidy {{in recent years have}} had a negative impact on the inflation rate, which has generally been on the rise despite some fluctuations. In 2004 efforts by the Central Bank of Yemen to tighten the money supply were offset by a weakening US$, to which the <b>Yemeni</b> <b>riyal</b> is linked in a managed float, and by rising global commodity prices, resulting in an inflation rate of 12.5 percent. In July 2005, the government succumbed to public opposition and lowered the new general sales tax from 10 to 5 percent. This tax, coupled with reductions in government fuel subsidies and higher import prices, is expected to result in an estimated inflation rate of 15 percent in 2006, up from 11.8 percent in 2005.|$|E
50|$|In 2012, al Qaeda in Yemen offered 3 kg of gold (about US$160,000) {{for killing}} Ambassador Feierstein, and 5 million <b>Yemeni</b> <b>riyals</b> (about US$23,000) for killing an American soldier in Yemen.|$|R
5000|$|Some months later, in 27 of March, 2016, three {{suspected}} US drone strikes hit AQAP positions {{inside their}} government buildings onside Zinjibar, reportedly killing some 14 AQAP soldiers. Three {{days after the}} take over, AQAP issued a bounty of 7 million <b>Yemeni</b> <b>riyals</b> ($32,500) {{on the head of}} the pro-government Popular Committee, Abdullatif al-Sayed, alleging he had [...] "stabbed the mujahedeen in the back".|$|R
50|$|On April 2, 2015, Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) {{stormed the}} central prison, freeing {{hundreds}} of prisoners including two senior AQAP commanders. They attacked {{the central bank}} and seized 17 billion <b>Yemeni</b> <b>riyals</b> and 1 million U.S. dollars before {{taking control of the}} presidential palace in the city. It is reported the entire city is under their control and they plan to establish an Islamic emirate in the wider Hadramaut region.|$|R
50|$|On July 30, 2014, the Yemeni {{government}} announced {{an increase in}} fuel prices as part of reforms to subsidy programs, which aimed at unlocking foreign funding and easing pressure on the budget. The lifting of subsidies came after pressure from the International Monetary Fund, which conditioned its continued financial assistance on these reforms. The government raised the price of regular gasoline to 200 <b>Yemeni</b> <b>riyals</b> per liter (93 US cents) from 125 riyals (58 US cents). Diesel used for public transport and trucks rose to 195 riyals per liter (91 US cents) from 100 riyals (46 US cents).|$|R
5000|$|Amnesty International {{denounced the}} {{recruitment}} of young boys {{under the age of}} 17 at hands of the Yemen's Houthi armed group to fight as child soldiers {{on the front lines of}} the Yemeni Civil War. In mid-February 2017, four boys, aged between 15 and 17, were recruited by Huthis in Sana'a; the total numbers of the boys recruited is unknown. Since the children have been excited to shoot Kalashnikovs and guns and wear military uniforms, Houthis have run local centers that hold activities such as prayers, sermons and lectures where they have been encouraged to join front-line battles to defend Yemen against Saudi Arabia. As the report clarified, they always take one recruit from each family because of the few fighters at the front-line combats because of the few fighters at the front lines in the combats and when son dies, a monthly salary, estimated between 20,000 and 30,000 <b>Yemeni</b> <b>Riyals,</b> has been given to the family. According to the UN agencies, nearly 1,500 cases of children were recruited by all parties to the conflict since March 2015.|$|R
