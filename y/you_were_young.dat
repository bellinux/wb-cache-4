500|$|Wish You Were Here is Floyd's {{second album}} with a {{conceptual}} theme written entirely by Roger Waters. [...] It reflects his {{feeling that the}} camaraderie that had served the band was, by then, largely absent. [...] The album begins with a long instrumental preamble and segues into the lyrics for [...] "Shine On You Crazy Diamond", a tribute to Syd Barrett, whose mental breakdown had forced {{him to leave the}} group seven years earlier. [...] Barrett is fondly recalled with lines such as [...] "Remember when <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>young,</b> you shone like the sun" [...] and [...] "You reached for the secret too soon, you cried for the moon".|$|E
500|$|She {{lived for}} a few months in a flat Starr owned at 34 Montagu Square, central London, but {{returned}} to Kenwood as Lennon and Ono preferred to live there instead, rather than in isolated Weybridge. Lennon and Cynthia had one last short meeting at Kenwood (with Ono alongside Lennon), where Lennon accused her of having an affair in India, saying she was no [...] "innocent little flower". McCartney visited her and Julian that year, and on the way to Kenwood he composed a song in his head which later became [...] "Hey Jude". Talking about their divorce, McCartney later said: [...] "We'd been very good friends for millions of years and I thought it was a bit much for them suddenly to be personae non gratae and out of my life". Cynthia recalled, [...] "I was truly surprised when, one afternoon, Paul arrived on his own. I was touched by his obvious concern for our welfare ... On the journey down he composed 'Hey Jude' in the car. I will never forget Paul's gesture of care and concern in coming to see us." [...] She was once asked if Lennon had written any songs about their time together, and answered: [...] "It was too sloppy when <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>young</b> to dedicate anything to anybody. Macho Northern men didn't do that in those days". In contrast, Lennon said he wrote the 1965 song [...] "Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)" [...] about an affair he was having, but rendered it in [...] "gobbledegook" [...] so Cynthia would not know.|$|E

However, she said she did not feel his behavior was intimidating nor did she feel sexually harassed, though she allowed that [...] "Some other women might have".

After 36 days, Zhou Tai was appointed as the new Administrator (太守) of Xincheng Commandery. Sima Yi secretly instructed a Master of Writing (尚書) to tease Zhou Tai, [...] "You discarded your plain clothing and entered a high office.
