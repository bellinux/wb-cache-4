It is funny how simple beginnings can lead you down convoluted paths of learning and discovery. About {{a year and a}} half ago, I was playing around with my automatic garage door remote control unit. I was experimenting with signal encoding at the time, and I wanted to look at the scheme used in my remote. One thing led to another, and before I knew it, I was trying to determine the RF frequency at which the transmitter was operating. I then built RF filters to look at signal levels and RF generators to aid in prototyping and testing. Next came RF mixing, frequency doubling, and so on. You can see where I’m going here. I became hooked on RF and all of the art that goes along with getting RF circuits working properly. Currently, all of my design-related pursuits are focused on circuits and test equipment at radio frequencies. When it comes to RF test equipment, the spectrum analyzer is the Holy Grail. Unfortunately, both new and used RF spectrum analyzers are extremely expensive. There are a variety of home-brew spectrum analyzers available on the ’Net. Some are more sophisticated than others because all of the circuit elements are built from scratch. They feature complex filter constructions, have precise PCB layouts that turn PCB traces into inductors, and include a lot of discrete components. Other somewhat simpler designs feature integrated modules borrowed from the TV/VCR tuner world. These are easier to build, but they lack sophistication and functionality. As I was browsing the ’Net for an alternative to a home-brew spectrum analyzer, I stumbled across the Maxim MAX 3550, which seemed almost too good to be true. Not onl...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. Comm.) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2004. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Many fund {{managers}} {{who are supposed}} to have your best interest at heart have become just as greedy, have vested interests and their performance has been mediocre. Until they clean up their act, <b>your</b> <b>best</b> <b>bet</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> opt for an index fund, or the type that uses our money to track a stock market index, provided the initial and ongoing costs are low if you invest in shares. A great many funds have been run well and conscientiously. However, it’s often not clear to individuals which ones these are. In the absence of clarity, those index funds that are very low-cost are investorfriendly by definition and are the best selection for most of those who wish to own equities. Warren Buffet Throughout the past twenty years, investment funds have been transforming financial markets. There has been a tremendous growth in this industry {{and at the end of}} 2003 more than USD 13 trillion were invested in investment funds around the globe. In the United States, 12 percent of all money invested in mutual funds resides in index mutual funds and investors can choose from 149 index funds. Academics have researched mutual funds in depth and most are in favour of index-related funds. The reason for this is that the average US mutual fund that is actively managed does not manage to outperform its benchmark index. In South Africa, the scenario is very different. There are currently only nine index unit trusts with a net asset value of ZAR 1. 4 billion. This represents only 60 basis points of all money invested in South African unit trusts. In this study, a few factors are discussed as possible contributors to this situation, with exchange-traded funds and enhanced index fund strategies identified as the most significant factors. This study investigates whether active unit trusts succeed in outperforming their benchmark index. It provides empirical research showing that All-Share Index have been a better risk-adjusted investment over the twenty years studied. This may be seen as a reason why investors prefer enhanced strategies since they provide a premium on the index’s return, and the risk and costs are lower than for active unit trusts. Exchange-traded funds have accumulated investments of close to ZAR 6 billion since the launch of the first Satrix fund, Satrix 40, in 2001. These funds aim at the same return as index unit trusts and have significant cost advantages over index unit trusts. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Many {{fund managers}} {{who are supposed to}} have your best interest at heart have become just as greedy, have vested interests and their performance has been mediocre. Until they clean up their act, <b>your</b> <b>best</b> <b>bet</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> opt for an index fund, or the type that uses our money to track a stock market index, provided the initial and ongoing costs are low if you invest in shares. A great many funds have been run well and conscientiously. However, it’s often not clear to individuals which ones these are. In the absence of clarity, those index funds that are very low-cost are investorfriendly by definition and are the best selection for most of those who wish to own equities. Warren Buffet Beleggingsfondse het tot gevolg gehad dat daar ‘n drastiese verandering in finansiële markte oor die afgelope twintig jaar plaasgevind het. Daar was ‘n aansienlike groei in hierdie industrie en aan die einde van 2003 was daar wêreldwyd meer as USD 13 triljoen in beleggingsfondse belê. In die Verenigde State behoort 12 persent van alle geld wat in effektetrusts belê is aan indeksfondse en beleggers het 149 indeksfondse waaruit gekies kan word. Effektetrusts is al in diepte deur akademici bestudeer en die meeste is ten gunste van indeks-verwante fondse. Die rede hiervoor is dat die gemiddelde effektetrust in die Verenigde State nie dit reg kry om beter as sy indeks maatstaf te presteer nie. In Suid Afrika is die omstandighede heeltemal anders. Daar is huidiglik slegs nege indeksfondse met ‘n netto bate waarde van ZAR 1. 4 biljoen. Dit verteenwoordig slegs 60 basis punte van al die geld wat in Suid Afrikaanse effektetrusts belê is. In hierdie studie word daar ‘n paar faktore bespreek wat moontlik bygedra het tot hierdie situasie. Beursverhandelde fondse en ”verbeterde” indeksfondse word geïdentifiseer as die twee vernaamste faktore. Hierdie studie kyk of aktiewe effektetrusts suksesvol was om beter te presteer as hulle maatstaf indeks. Empiriese navorsing word gegee wat wys dat die Algemene Indeks ‘n beter risiko-aangepaste belegging was oor die twintig jaar van die studie. Dit kan gesien word as ‘n rede hoekom beleggers “verbeterings” strategieë verkies wat ‘n premie bied op die indeks se prestasie en beide die risiko en koste is laer as met aktiewe fondse. Beursverhandelde fondse het beleggings ten bedrae van ZAR 6 biljoen opgebou sedert die begin van die eerste Satrix fonds, Satrix 40 in 2001. Hierdie fondse mik vir dieselfde opbrengs as indeks effektetrusts en het groot koste voordele bo indeksfondse...|$|E

Versions of what might be called quasi-consequentialism can be rendered metaphysically coherent, but these are consequentialisms in name only, and they are best seen as components of an account of practical rationality that has strong echoes of traditional natural law theory.

40|$|Business {{innovation}} {{is key to}} a creating a highly productive Canadian economy. One concern is that Canadian businesses have relatively low levels of business research and development (R&D), despite access {{to some of the}} world’s most generous R&D tax subsidies. This doesn’t mean that tax credits do not stimulate R&D; indeed, research suggests they do. Rather, low business R&D appears to be rooted in structural aspects of the economy and, more importantly, a lack of demand-related pressure to pursue innovation as a business strategy. This paper looks at the impact of the federal R&D tax credit, and proposes tax options aimed at improving Canada’s innovation performance. It argues that Canada’s <b>best</b> <b>bet</b> <b>is</b> to focus on creating a competitive tax system across the entire innovation value chain. The current system is mainly designed to “push ” firms to undertake R&D through generous upfront subsidies. Meanwhile, the rewards of innovation—income from intellectual property and new products and services—are taxed at rates that are far less competitive. The federal government should focus its efforts on addressing market “pull ” factors by keeping taxes on the rewards of innovation at internationally competitive levels. It should also consider options to reduce tax disincentives for small, innovative firms to grow into larger, globally competitive companies...|$|R

Kenneson, to be [...] "religious" [...] conveys an {{institutional}} connotation, {{usually associated with}} Abrahamic traditions: to attend worship services, to say Mass, to light Hanukkah candles. To be [...] "spiritual," [...] in contrast, connotes personal practice and personal empowerment {{having to do with}} the deepest motivations of life. As a result, in cultures that are deeply suspicious of institutional structures and that place a high value on individual freedom and autonomy, spirituality has come to have largely positive connotations, while religion has been viewed more negatively. Abrahamic religions have been viewed as negative institutions because they propagate a certain way of believing. Abrahamic traditions emphasize that one’s <b>best</b> <b>bet</b> <b>is</b> to look outside to a higher power that can guide and correct one's corporeal misjudgements. In these traditions, God above is the source of wisdom and illumination. Robert Wuthnow argues that spirituality is about much more than going to church and agreeing or disagreeing with church doctrines. Scholar Robert Wuthnow argues that spirituality is the shorthand term used in Western society to talk about a person's relationship with God. For many people, how they think about religion and spirituality is certainly guided by what they see and do in their congregations. At a deeper level, it involves a person's self-identity—feeling loved by God, and these feelings can wax and wane.|$|R
50|$|For {{practicing}} quick-draw extensively, {{the very}} <b>best</b> <b>bet</b> <b>is</b> a Jordan holster sewn {{to a wide}} stout belt, with tie-down straps to secure {{the bottom of the}} holster firmly to your leg. It is best to prep a new quick-draw holster by putting the gun inside of six or seven gallon-size Ziploc bags and sealing each one, then wetting the holster thoroughly in a bucket of warm water with a little soap in it and jamming the gun into the holster to shape it, then letting the holster dry completely. Without the bags, the gun will be a loose fit in the holster. For uniformed police-officers, it does them good to learn how to unsnap the safety strap, which is snapped across the hammer to lock the gun into the holster, {{as an integral part of}} the quick-draw, without slowing or stopping the hand in that process. (Do not use a thumb-break safety strap for quick-draw.) A shoe-repair shop can sew a small bent-up piece of sheet metal to the bottom of the tag-end of the safety strap to hold it away from the holster and enable the extended fingers sweeping up the side of the holster to pop the snap on the safety strap so that it will fly up out of the way as the hand draws the gun.|$|R
5000|$|According to Philip D. Kenneson, to be [...] "religious" [...] conveys an {{institutional}} connotation, {{usually associated with}} Abrahamic traditions: to attend worship services, to say Mass, to light Hanukkah candles. To be [...] "spiritual," [...] in contrast, connotes personal practice and personal empowerment {{having to do with}} the deepest motivations of life. As a result, in cultures that are deeply suspicious of institutional structures and that place a high value on individual freedom and autonomy, spirituality has come to have largely positive connotations, while religion has been viewed more negatively. Abrahamic religions have been viewed as negative institutions because they propagate a certain way of believing. Abrahamic traditions emphasize that one’s <b>best</b> <b>bet</b> <b>is</b> to look outside to a higher power that can guide and correct one's corporeal misjudgements. In these traditions, God above is the source of wisdom and illumination. Robert Wuthnow argues that spirituality is about much more than going to church and agreeing or disagreeing with church doctrines. Scholar Robert Wuthnow argues that spirituality is the shorthand term used in Western society to talk about a person's relationship with God. For many people, how they think about religion and spirituality is certainly guided by what they see and do in their congregations. At a deeper level, it involves a person's self-identity—feeling loved by God, and these feelings can wax and wane.|$|R
5000|$|When an {{approaching}} storm {{turns out to}} be a tornado, Dorothy takes shelter in the farmhouse as Aunt Em and Uncle Henry hide in the storm cellar. As the tornado hits the farm, the house, with Dorothy inside, is lifted right up into the air and carried for miles within the cyclone ("The Tornado"). It finally comes to rest with a bump in the middle of an emerald green field covered with flowers. There, Dorothy is met by the Munchkins, who are all dressed in blue, and Addaperle, the Good Witch of the North, who tells her that she is in the land of Oz. Furthermore, her house has fallen on Evamean, the Wicked Witch of the East, and killed her, freeing the Munchkins from her evil powers. Dorothy, distressed and confused, wants only to return to Aunt Em, Uncle Henry, and Toto in Kansas. With her magic unable to take Dorothy beyond the country boundaries, Addaperle decides her <b>best</b> <b>bet</b> <b>is</b> to follow the Yellow Brick Road to Emerald City in the centre of Oz, and see the great and powerful Wizard of Oz, or [...] "The Wiz" [...] for short ("He's the Wizard"). She gives the child the Witch of the East's silver slippers, and tells her not to take them off before she reaches home, for they hold a mysterious, but very powerful charm that will keep her safe.|$|R
