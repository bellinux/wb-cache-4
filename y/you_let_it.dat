Drake then ends up on a balcony singing in front of the Toronto skyline. Both are shown in scenes contemplating intermixed with Songz joining Drake on the balcony. Subsequently scenes are shown of Drake and Songz riding through Toronto nightlife, along with the contemplative scenes, such as a young boy playing basketball in which Songz has an illusion that it is him, and little girl blowing a dandelion. The video ends with the skyline and a quote stating, [...] "Making your mark on the world is hard. If it were easy, everybody would do it. But it's not. It takes patience, it takes commitment, and it comes with plenty of failure along the way. The real test is not whether you avoid this failure, because you won't. It's whether <b>you</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> harden or shame you into inaction, or whether you learn from it; whether you choose to persevere."- Barack Obama ...|$|E
500|$|... "It's Not Up to You" [...] {{has been}} {{described}} as a [...] "dizzying ballad" [...] and a song that lifts the album upward. Michael Paoletta of Billboard described the track as [...] "melancholy". Its lyrics are about [...] "love for the unknown devices that culminate in 'perfect days'", and [...] "pleas to find beauty in unlikely places". The [...] "caressing lyrics" [...] of [...] "Undo" [...] assure that: [...] "It's not meant to be a strife/It's not meant to be a struggle uphill". Biographer Mark Pytlik writes, [...] "Undo" [...] is a held hand, a reassuring reminder that anything can happen once <b>you</b> <b>let</b> <b>it.</b> If you are in pain, undo it, Björk suggests, no hint of disingenuousness in her voice, over climbing strings and a rising choir". [...] "Pagan Poetry" [...] is a [...] "harp-splashed" [...] song that concerns unrequited love. The track builds slowly, [...] "with Björk wailing over swelling keyboard crescendos," [...] until, at the four-minute mark, [...] "all the music drops away, leaving Björk utterly exposed" [...] as she sings [...] "I love him, I love him/I love him, I love him/I love him, I love him". The song also features [...] "a flotilla of music boxes with an Asian-teahouse touch." [...] The instrumental interlude [...] "Frosti" [...] {{has been described}} as a [...] "metallic tundra". Its sound stems from a music box, creating an intimate, fairy tale-like effect.|$|E

In an interview at the showcase Dobson mused, [...] "It's almost like when an animal is in a small cage, but when <b>you</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> out it's running around like crazy.

2500|$|In Rolling Stone, David Fricke called Kid A [...] "a work of {{deliberately}} inky, often irritating obsession... But this is pop, a {{music of}} ornery, glistening guile and honest ache, {{and it will}} feel good under your skin once <b>you</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> get there." [...] The Village Voice called the album [...] "oblique oblique oblique... Also incredibly beautiful." [...] Spin found it Radiohead's [...] "best and bravest" [...] album. Billboard described it as [...] "an ocean of unparalleled musical depth" [...] and [...] "the first truly groundbreaking album of the 21st century." [...] Robert Christgau wrote that Kid A is [...] "an imaginative, imitative variation on a pop staple: sadness made pretty." [...] Pitchfork gave it a perfect score, calling it [...] "cacophonous yet tranquil, experimental yet familiar, foreign yet womb-like, spacious yet visceral, textured yet vaporous, awakening yet dreamlike... it's clear that Radiohead must be the greatest band alive, if not the best since you know who." ...|$|E
2500|$|Set dresser Frank Silva {{was cast}} as the mysterious [...] "Bob". Lynch himself recalls that the idea {{originated}} when he overheard Silva moving furniture around in the bedroom set, and then heard a woman warning Silva not to block himself in by moving furniture {{in front of the}} door. Lynch was struck with an image of Silva in the room. When he learned that Silva was an actor, he filmed two panning shots, one with Silva {{at the base of the}} bed, and one without; he did not yet know how he would use this material. Later that day, during the filming of Sarah Palmer having a vision, the camera operator told Lynch that the shot was ruined because [...] "Frank [...] was reflected in the mirror." [...] Lynch comments, [...] "Things like this happen and make you start dreaming. And one thing leads to another, and if <b>you</b> <b>let</b> <b>it,</b> a whole other thing opens up." [...] Lynch used the panning shot of Silva in the bedroom, and the shot featuring Silva's reflection, in the closing scenes of the European version of the pilot episode. Silva's reflection in the mirror can also be glimpsed during the scene of Sarah's vision at the end of the original pilot, but it is less clear. A close-up of Silva in the bedroom later became a significant image in episodes of the TV series.|$|E
2500|$|In 1973, the Miracles, with Griffin, re-emerged {{with the}} {{critically}} acclaimed album, Renaissance – their first without Smokey Robinson on lead vocals, {{which included the}} Marvin Gaye composition, [...] "I Love You Secretly", [...] "What Is a Heart Good For" [...] (the intended first single), and the charting single,"Don't Let It End (Til <b>You</b> <b>Let</b> <b>It</b> Begin)". The following year, in 1974, after releasing the much-covered single [...] "Give Me Just Another Day", the group had their first top 20 hit in three years with the million-selling funk song, [...] "Do It Baby". This {{was followed by the}} top 10 R hit, [...] "Don't-Cha Love It." [...] Late that following year, the group recorded the disco smash, [...] "Love Machine", which came off their self-written-and-produced hit album, City of Angels. [...] "Love Machine" [...] reached number-one on the Hot 100 in early 1976, the Miracles' first since [...] "Tears of a Clown", and later sold over 4.5million copies. The Miracles, who had long been written off by the music industry, had proven that they could have big hits without Robinson. Despite this success,however, in 1976, the Miracles' relationship with Motown imploded during contract renewals after their contract with the label had expired. When Motown, then going through a contract issue with Stevie Wonder, advised the group to wait [...] "six months" [...] to discuss a new contract, the group took on an offer to sign with Columbia Records, signing with them in 1977. Following this, Billy's brother Donald joined them on lead guitar, replacing Marv Tarplin. The group immediately had problems after signing with Columbia, starting with the release of their first Columbia single, [...] "Spy For Brotherhood". Expecting controversy from the single as well as possible threats from the FBI, Columbia pulled the song from the airwaves. The group failed to have a hit during their short Columbia run and in 1978, Pete Moore decided to retire from the road while Billy Griffin wanted to return to his solo career, leading to the group to disband. {sfn|Ryan|2011|p=88}} ...|$|E
