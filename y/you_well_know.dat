25|$|In 1968, Callas told Lord Harewood, De Hildalgo had {{the real}} great {{training}}, {{maybe even the}} last real training of the real bel canto. As a young girl—thirteen years old—I was immediately thrown into her arms, meaning that I learned the secrets, the ways of this bel canto, which of course as <b>you</b> <b>well</b> <b>know,</b> is not just beautiful singing. It is a very hard training; it {{is a sort of}} a strait-jacket that you're supposed to put on, {{whether you like it or}} not. You have to learn to read, to write, to form your sentences, how far you can go, fall, hurt yourself, put yourself back on your feet continuously. De Hidalgo had one method, which was the real bel canto way, where no matter how heavy a voice, it should always be kept light, it should always be worked on in a flexible way, never to weigh it down. It is a method of keeping the voice light and flexible and pushing the instrument into a certain zone where it might not be too large in sound, but penetrating. And teaching the scales, trills, all the bel canto embellishments, which is a whole vast language of its own.|$|E
500|$|In {{terms of}} {{advanced}} technology, the Soviet Union was {{far behind the}} United States, Western Europe, and Japan. Vacuum tube electronics remained in use long after they became obsolete elsewhere, and many factories in the 80s still used 1930s-vintage machine tools. General Nikolai Ogarkov in an unusually candid interview with an American journalist in 1982 admitted that [...] "In America, even small children play with computers. We do not even have them in all {{the offices of the}} Defense Ministry. And for reasons <b>you</b> <b>well</b> <b>know,</b> we cannot make computers widely available in our society." [...] Soviet manufacturing was not only primitive by Western standards, but extremely inefficient, often requiring 2-3 times the labor force of a mill or factory in the US.|$|E
2500|$|President Shachtman {{issued a}} call for the {{biennial}} convention of the IFWU {{to be held in}} the Executive Council chamber at the AFL Building in Washington, D.C., on July 13, 1927. The union's constitution required the convention to be held in May, but AFL leaders (including the influential Executive Council member, Matthew Woll) demanded that Shachtman delay the meeting until such time as he could guarantee that a large majority of delegates would be pro-AFL. [...] "As <b>you</b> <b>well</b> <b>know,</b> your International Union is today being financed to a great part by the reorganizing activities going on here in New York City," [...] Woll and two others wrote Shachtman, [...] "and that without this income your organization would be practically bankrupt." [...] The letter was thinly-veiled blackmail, and Shachtman knuckled under to it.|$|E
6000|$|He {{paused in}} thought, and {{then shook his}} head. [...] "Nothing, Thuvia, that is true; yet I could have sworn you loved me. Indeed, <b>you</b> <b>well</b> <b>knew</b> how near to worship has been my love for you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Distinguished me with,' {{suggested}} Carker, bending {{his head}} again: 'I {{will not say}} to you how honoured I am; for a man like <b>you</b> <b>well</b> <b>knows</b> how much honour he has {{in his power to}} bestow at pleasure.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Spare {{to insult}} me, Miriam. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>well</b> why it is. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>well</b> that I am no traitor, and that I do not fly for fear." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your mother, as <b>you</b> <b>well</b> <b>know,</b> my dear Derby, {{would be}} delighted, {{did you take}} any {{interest}} {{in the affairs of}} the island." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Noble Jabaster, I {{see much}} difficulty. Alroy no longer quits his palace. Our {{entrance}} unwatched is, <b>you</b> <b>well</b> <b>know,</b> impossible. What say you, Scherirah?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The prince rarely {{gives an}} opinion," [...] said the baron. [...] "Indeed, as <b>you</b> <b>well</b> <b>know,</b> he rarely speaks; he thinks and he acts." ...|$|E
6000|$|I do {{not wish}} to pain <b>you.</b> How <b>well</b> <b>you</b> <b>KNOW</b> I don't! Give me [...] a little time. I am {{disposed}} to agree to your last request.|$|R
60|$|BURKE--[Scornfully.] Is it {{blaming the}} sea for your {{troubles}} ye are again, God help <b>you?</b> <b>Well,</b> Anna <b>knows</b> it now. 'Twas in her blood, anyway.|$|R
60|$|ABSOLUTE Oh, come to me--rich only thus--in loveliness! Bring no portion {{to me but}} thy love--'twill {{be generous}} in <b>you,</b> Lydia--for <b>well</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> {{it is the only}} dower your poor Beverley can repay.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hush, naughty one!" [...] {{returned}} Hilda. [...] "You {{are very}} ungrateful, for <b>you</b> <b>well</b> <b>know</b> he has wit enough to worship you, at all events." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{mean you}} by hints so dark, and a {{question}} so sudden? The chaplain, as <b>you</b> <b>well</b> <b>know,</b> is absent at Perth upon an {{assembly of the}} brethren." ...|$|E
6000|$|To show one's tongue, as <b>you</b> <b>well</b> <b>know,</b> [...] Is not {{considered}} nice to do; [...] But {{if it were}} like Mr. Toad's [...] I'd want to show it--wouldn't you? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Is {{there any}} sense," [...] she demanded, [...] "in {{being in love}} with a person who, as <b>you</b> {{perfectly}} <b>well</b> <b>know,</b> thoroughly dislikes and detests you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will have}} no threats; you are powerless, as <b>you</b> very <b>well</b> <b>know.</b> Let things remain as they are or, by God! you shall both suffer for it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do not say so. Go {{down and}} take your place with them, and speak your mind with them,--as <b>you</b> so <b>well</b> <b>know</b> how. Who among them can do it so well?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you suppose, Mr. Bragg, {{there is}} any body in all this region who will swear to the fact? Proof, <b>you</b> <b>well</b> <b>know,</b> is very {{requisite}} even to obtain justice." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A truce on this folly, Sir Percy," [...] he said roughly, [...] "as <b>you</b> <b>well</b> <b>know,</b> I {{had never}} any {{intention}} of fighting you with these poisoned swords of yours and..." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{promised that}} with two lads I would follow Thayendanega's gang until {{we found out}} what the villains were about, as all of <b>you</b> <b>well</b> <b>know,</b> an' within the hour we three will set off." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am no skilled electrician, as <b>you</b> very <b>well</b> <b>know.</b> My calling <b>you</b> {{here was}} an accident. So I don't know how to command you, nor what {{to ask you to}} do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank <b>you.</b> <b>Well,</b> <b>you</b> must <b>know</b> that {{my mother}} had a {{beautiful}} voice-- O! much more beautiful than mine. Indeed, I do not joke, so you need not laugh. It was so sweet that men were always forced to listen till she was done. They could not help it." ...|$|R
60|$|ASHER. I've {{just called}} up the Department in Washington and given them a piece of my mind--told 'em they'd have to conscript labour. Damn these unions, making all this trouble, and {{especially}} today, when you're going off. I haven't {{had a chance to}} talk to <b>you.</b> <b>Well,</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> that I'm proud of you, my boy. Your grandfather went off to the Civil War when he was just about your age.|$|R
6000|$|... "Russia, of course," [...] the King exclaimed, bitterly. [...] "An {{independent}} Theos {{has always}} been against her policy. She debauched the Republic, she tried--as <b>you</b> <b>well</b> <b>know,</b> Brand--to make my accession a virtual Russian protectorate." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I believe you, Gilbert,' {{said his}} father; 'but <b>you</b> <b>well</b> <b>know</b> {{that the only}} way of atoning for the past, as well as of {{avoiding}} such wretchedness and disgrace for the future, is to show greater firmness.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'My part in them,' said Mr. Wickfield, {{shaking his}} white head, 'has much matter for regret--for deep regret, and deep contrition, Trotwood, <b>you</b> <b>well</b> <b>know.</b> But I would not cancel it, {{if it were}} in my power.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Aye, but I'm {{a little}} {{doubtful}} of going in upon them by myself; now, <b>you</b> are <b>well</b> <b>known</b> to them all, {{and it will}} be no detriment to you just to let me go in with you." ...|$|R
60|$|STRAMMFEST. It {{is quite}} simple, as <b>you</b> very <b>well</b> <b>know.</b> A dozen {{travellers}} {{arrive at the}} boundary. The official collects their passports. He counts twelve persons; then counts the passports. If there are twelve, he is satisfied.|$|R
60|$|SYLVIA. <b>Well,</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> it's {{an awfully}} long time ago. I forget.|$|R
6000|$|... "It isn't {{your health}} I mean. There are other things, as <b>you</b> <b>well</b> <b>know.</b> You do your day's {{work and you}} take your pleasure, and you go through both as if your feet were on a treadmill." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As <b>you</b> <b>well</b> <b>know,</b> I {{came home}} from Canada {{to take care of}} him. Still, I agree with the executors. If you can still persuade Dick to believe in you, he must be saved in spite of himself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That, unfortunately," [...] de Grost declared, with {{a little}} sigh, [...] "is, as <b>you</b> <b>well</b> <b>know,</b> out of the question. You are too clever for me, Bernadine. After all, I shall {{have to go back}} to my farm." ...|$|E
