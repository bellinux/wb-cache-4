50|$|In December 2003 a 2005-dated {{base was}} {{introduced}} for new registrations. Beginning at approximately AVA 0001, the debossed left sticker box was removed, as in approximately November 2006 the state {{switched to a}} single sticker displaying both month and <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>expiry,</b> a practice that would be continued on the 2007 base.|$|E
5000|$|For sixty years, between 1910 and 1970, Georgia issued plates annually. The {{plates were}} dated with the <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>expiry.</b> In 1940, the slogan [...] "Peach State" [...] {{was added to}} the plates and used for the next thirty years. County coding was {{introduced}} in 1957 and it was revised in 1962. The 1962 codes were used through 1970.|$|E
5000|$|The 2010 design {{consists}} of black lettering superimposed over a pictoral reference {{of a landscape}} of hills. Between the main number and the registration districts, two traditional Swazi [...] "beehive" [...] huts (known as Gucasithandaze) are shown over a background of the setting sun. Plates are valid for five years, and have a sticker indicating the <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>expiry.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Senate {{elections}} {{must be held}} {{within one}} <b>year</b> <b>of</b> the <b>expiry</b> <b>of</b> the fixed term of the senate. The constitution originally provided for senate terms on calendar years, beginning on 1 January and ending on 31 December 6 years later. This was changed {{as a result of}} the 1906 referendum to terms beginning on 1 July and ending on 30 June, primarily to enable simultaneous elections to be held in March. The amendments were passed, being approved by 82.65% of voters with a majority in all 6 states. Despite the intention to hold elections in March, the first such Federal election was March 1983. Since 1906 section 13 provides that ...|$|R
50|$|The Government changed {{during the}} Senate term as the Coalition of the Nationalist Party led by Prime Minister of Australia Stanley Bruce and the Country Party led by Earle Page lost the {{confidence}} of the House of Representatives and called an election for October 1929. The Labor Party, led by James Scullin, won the election with a large majority. This {{was the first time in}} which an election for the House of Representatives was held without an election for the Senate. Section 13 of the Constitution requires an election to occur within one <b>year</b> <b>of</b> the <b>expiry</b> <b>of</b> senate terms and the terms of senators elected in 1925 were not due to expire until 1932.|$|R
50|$|Luveni {{was educated}} at Lautoka Fijian School {{and then at}} Nabua Secondary School in Suva, before enrolling in Adi Cakobau School in Sawani. She {{graduated}} in dentistry from the Fiji School of Medicine in 1967, the first Fijian woman to do so. After graduation, she worked for twenty years for the Ministry of Health, before working for the United Nations Population Fund as project manager for reproductive health from 1987 to 2002. She resigned three <b>years</b> ahead <b>of</b> the <b>expiry</b> <b>of</b> her term {{to take up a}} post as HIV project officer for the Ministry of Health, working as project manager for Fiji Network for People Living with HIV, a non-governmental organization.|$|R
5000|$|Temporary/export {{plates are}} similar to, {{and in the}} same series as, the regular issues. However at the right hand side of the plate is a green band, showing month and <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>expiry.</b> Until 2001 {{temporary}} tourist (duty-free) plates had registrations from the normal series except that the prefix used was GG. This series reached past GG90000, and was probably superseded by the dated green band style when the suffix letter was introduced.|$|E
50|$|The council {{voted on}} 30 June 2006 {{to make a}} review of alleged human rights abuses by Israel a {{permanent}} feature of every council session. The Council's special rapporteur on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is its only expert mandate with no <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>expiry.</b> The resolution, which was sponsored by Organisation of the Islamic Conference, passed {{by a vote of}} 29 to 12 with five abstentions. Human Rights Watch urged it to look at international human rights and humanitarian law violations committed by Palestinian armed groups as well. Human Rights Watch called on the Council to avoid the selectivity that discredited its predecessor and urged it to hold special sessions on other urgent situations, such as that in Darfur.|$|E
50|$|To {{show that}} a vehicle is {{registered}} in Australia, a sticker must be displayed in the lower left corner of either the rear left window or windscreen in annual colors on a 6-year cycle: blue, red, purple, brown, green and orange. This sticker is issued to the registered {{owner of the vehicle}} upon payment of the next year's registration fee, and shows the expiry date of the registration. They are color-coded for easy recognition of the <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>expiry.</b> The sticker shows the plate number, Vehicle Identification Number, make, model, and color of the vehicle, along with other such information. This acts as an anti-theft device, because transplanting the plates from one car to another will be in contrast to the details on the sticker.|$|E

50|$|The Western Australia {{registration}} sticker shows {{only the}} month and <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>expiry.</b> However, since the Western Australian police now have such {{easy access to}} registration information based on the numberplate via in-car computer systems found in all police vehicles, registration stickers in Western Australia have been completely scrapped. As of 1 January 2010 they {{will no longer be}} required or made - a move that is said to save at least $2 million over 4 years in costs for printing and postage. Car owners will also feel the relief of not having to perform the tedious task of removing and re-applying the registration sticker every 6-12 months. As of 1 January 2013 NSW have also scrapped registration stickers. NT also scrapped registration stickers as of 1 January 2014.|$|E

40|$|Most of the {{discussion}} about fiscal stimulus focuses on the multiplier of government spending on impact. In this paper we shift the focus to the multiplier at the end, i. e. to {{the period in which}} a deficit spending program terminates. We show that recent time series analyses as well as economic models of different schools of thought predict that the multiplier turns negative before spending expires. This means that aggregate output at the time <b>of</b> <b>expiry</b> <b>of</b> fiscal stimulus is predicted to be lower than it could be without deficit spending. We set up a simple model that explains this phenomenon. Using phase diagram analysis we prove that the aggregate capital stock at the time <b>of</b> <b>expiry</b> <b>of</b> fiscal stimulus is lower than it would be without the deficit spending program. This fact explains why aggregate output is below its laissez faire level as well. We then calibrate an extended version of the model for the US and demonstrate how fiscal stimulus slows down recovery from a recession in the medium-run...|$|R
