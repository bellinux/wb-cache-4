Some men grab at it so much like they was going to set a dislocation of the shoulder that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>smell</b> the arnica and hear 'em tearing off bandages. Some take it up like a hot horseshoe, and hold it off at arm's length like a druggist pouring tincture of asafoetida in a bottle.

6000|$|He {{threw open}} the door of the sitting-room. In spite of his anxiety, Amelius burst out laughing. The Frenchman's inexhaustible contrivances had {{transformed}} the sitting-room into a bedroom for Sally. The sofa had become a snug little white bed; a hairbrush and comb, and a bottle of eau-de-cologne, were on the table; a bath stood near the fire, with cans of hot and cold water, and a railway rug placed under them to save the carpet. [...] "I dare not presume to contradict you, sir," [...] said Toff, [...] "but there is my conception of duty! In the kitchen, I have another conception, keeping warm; <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>smell</b> it up the stairs. Salmi of partridge, with the littlest possible dash of garlic in the sauce.

[...] He spoke quite seriously, with the air of a profound moralist, asserting principles that did equal honour to his head and his heart.|$|E
60|$|We held a good lift {{to clear}} the {{coastwise}} and Continental shipping; and we had need of it. Though our route is in no sense a populated one, there is a steady trickle of traffic this way along. We met Hudson Bay furriers out of the Great Preserve, hurrying to make their departure from Bonavista with sable and black fox for the insatiable markets. We over-crossed Keewatin liners, small and cramped; but their captains, who see no land between Trepassy and Blanco, know what gold they bring back from West Africa. Trans-Asiatic Directs, we met, soberly ringing the world round the Fiftieth Meridian at an honest seventy knots; and white-painted Ackroyd & Hunt fruiters {{out of the south}} fled beneath us, their ventilated hulls whistling like Chinese kites. Their market is in the North among the northern sanatoria where <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>smell</b> their grapefruit and bananas across the cold snows. Argentine beef boats we sighted too, of enormous capacity and unlovely outline. They, too, feed the northern health stations in ice-bound ports where submersibles dare not rise.|$|E

Take her out into the country. One works just {{as well in the}} sunshine. You do better work if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>smell</b> flowers growing around you while your brain is active. Lend her to me for a week. I'll take her to my cottage in the Ardennes. There I live with the sun--breakfast at sunrise, to bed at sunset. I will dictate to you, Miss Julia--dictate beautiful things. You shall be proud always. You shall say--'I have worked for Selingman. Conceited ass!' you will probably add. Thank Heavens that I am conceited!

60|$|This is the {{conclusion}} of the statements which I wished to put before you. You see {{we have not been able}} to have any accessories. If you will come in such numbers to hear a lecture of this kind, all I can say is, that diagrams cannot be made big enough for you, and that it is not possible to show any experiments illustrative of a lecture on such a subject as I have to deal with. Of course my friends the chemists and physicists are very much better off, because they can not only show you experiments, but <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>smell</b> them and hear them! But in my case such aids are not attainable, and therefore I have taken a simple subject and have dealt with it in such a way that I hope you all understand it, at least so far as I have been able to put it before you in words; and having once apprehended such of the ideas and simple facts of the case as it was possible to put before you, you can see for yourselves the great and wonderful issues of such an apparently homely subject.|$|E
60|$|But what is this? While I am {{noting the}} terrors of the English clime, {{they have all}} turned {{themselves}} into allures and delights. There have come three or four days, since I arrived in London, of so fine and mellow a warmth, of skies so tenderly blue, and so heaped with such soft masses of white clouds, that one wonders what there was ever to complain of. In the parks and in the gardened spaces which so abound, the leaves have grown perceptibly, and the grass thickened so that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>smell</b> it, if you cannot hear it, growing. The birds insist, and in the air is that miraculous lift, as if nature, having had this banquet of the year long simmering, had suddenly taken the lid off, to let you perceive with every gladdening sense what a feast {{you were going to}} have presently in the way of summer. From the delectable vision rises a subtile haze, which veils the day just a little from its own loveliness, and lies upon the sighing and expectant city like the substance of a dream made visible. It has the magic to transmute you to this substance yourself, so that while you dawdle afoot, or whisk by in your hansom, or rumble earthquakingly aloft on your omnibus-top, you are aware of being a part, very dim, very subtile, of the passer's blissful consciousness. It is flattering, but you feel like warning him not to go in-doors, or he will lose you {{and all the rest of}} it; for having tried it yourself you know that it is still winter within the house walls, and will not be April there till well into June.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the things}} the movie does best is {{transport}} you back in time and into nature. In the early scenes as Joel leaves his aunt's home to travel across the South by rickety bus and horse and carriage, you feel the strangeness, wonder and anxiety of a child abandoning everything that's familiar to go to a place so remote he has to ask directions along the way. The landscape over which he travels is so rich and fertile that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> almost <b>smell</b> the earth and sky. Later on, when Joel tussles with Idabell (Aubrey Dollar), a tomboyish neighbor who becomes his best friend (a character inspired by the author Harper Lee), the movie has a special force and clarity in its evocation of the physical immediacy of being a child playing outdoors.|$|R
