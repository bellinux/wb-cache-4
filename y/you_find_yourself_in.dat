We'll never say never with anything," [...] he remarked. [...] "As soon as you say, 'I'm not gonna do that anymore,' <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>yourself</b> <b>in</b> a situation where you wanna do that. Shane [...] and Craig [...] are awesome guitarists and great fun to play in a band with, so we definitely won't say that the band is done. But obviously, for the foreseeable future, all of our energy is going into Blink-182." [...] In an interview with Blunt Magazine in March 2009, Hoppus was asked if +44 will continue again, where he stated [...] "I think so, yes. I love Shane [...] and Craig [...] They are great guitarists and good friends and I'd love to do another record with them. I know that Tom DeLonge plans to continue doing Angels & Airwaves in some capacity but right now all of our efforts are on Blink." ...|$|E

Now, in future {{you had better}} have an impulse just the other way and, when <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>yourself</b> <b>in</b> {{the midst of a}} row in which you have no personal concern, let your first thought be {{how to get out of}} it, as quickly as you can.

On all sides are rocks and {{mountains}} rough and stony; so <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>yourself</b> <b>in</b> another of those punch-bowls which the Arabs seem to consider choice sites for settlements.[FN#20] The Fiumara, hereabouts very winding, threads the high grounds all the way down from the plateau of Al-Madinah: during the rainy season it becomes a raging torrent, carrying westwards to the Red Sea the drainage of a hundred hills. Water of good quality is readily found in it by digging a few feet below the surface at the angles where the stream forms the deepest hollows, and in some places the stony sides give out bubbling springs.[FN#21] ...|$|E
60|$|I {{have almost}} {{forgotten}} {{in the interest of}} the human spectacle that there is a sea somewhere about at Rockaway Beach, and it is this that the people have come for. I might well forget that modest sea, it is so built out of sight by the restaurants and bath-houses and switch-backs and shops that border it, and by the hotels and saloons and shows flaring along the road that divides the village, and the planked streets that intersect this. But if you walk southward on any of the streets, you presently find the planks foundering in sand, which drifts far up over them, and then <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>yourself</b> <b>in</b> full sight of the ocean and the ocean bathing. Swarms and heaps of people in all lolling and lying and wallowing shapes strew the beach, and the water is full of slopping and shouting and shrieking human creatures, clinging with bare white arms to the life-lines that run from the shore to the buoys; beyond these the lifeguard stays himself in his boat with outspread oars, and rocks on the incoming surf.|$|E
60|$|Your breakfast done, {{turn out}} the gas, remount the stairs quietly, open gently {{the front door and}} slip out. <b>You</b> will <b>find</b> <b>yourself</b> <b>in</b> an unknown land. A strange city grown round you in the night.|$|R
6000|$|... "My good fellow, {{this is a}} {{very serious}} business, and <b>you</b> may <b>find</b> <b>yourself</b> <b>in</b> a pretty bad {{position}} if you try to hide anything from me. You say that your fare told you that he was a detective?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are {{so extreme}} in your statements, Octavia, dear," [...] said Aunt Ellen, mildly, {{looking up from}} her paper.

60|$|It {{is a most}} lonely spot, and the walks are picturesque in the extreme. The farm {{consists}} of grazing land lying {{at the bottom of}} an irregular valley. On each side are the fantastic limestone hills, formed of rock so soft that you can break it away with your hands. All this country is hollow. Could you strike it with some gigantic hammer it would boom like a drum, or possibly cave in altogether and expose some huge subterranean sea. A great sea there must surely be, for on all sides the streams run into the mountain itself, never to reappear. There are gaps everywhere amid the rocks, and when you pass through them <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>yourself</b> <b>in</b> great caverns, which wind down into the bowels of the earth. I have a small bicycle lamp, and it is a perpetual joy to me to carry it into these weird solitudes, and to see the wonderful silver and black effect when I throw its light upon the stalactites which drape the lofty roofs. Shut off the lamp, and you are in the blackest darkness. Turn it on, and it is a scene from the Arabian Nights.|$|E

We {{shall not}} have to explore our way into a hall dimly lighted by the expiring embers of a wood fire--nor be obliged to spread our beds {{on the floor of}} a room without windows, doors, or furniture. But you must be aware that when a young lady is (by {{whatever}} means) introduced into a dwelling of this kind, she is always lodged apart from the rest of the family. While they snugly repair to their own end of the house, she is formally conducted by Dorothy, the ancient housekeeper, up a different staircase, and along many gloomy passages, into an apartment never used since some cousin or kin died in it about twenty years before. Can you stand such a ceremony as this? Will not your mind misgive you when <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>yourself</b> <b>in</b> this gloomy chamber--too lofty and extensive for you, with only the feeble rays of a single lamp to take in its size--its walls hung with tapestry exhibiting figures as large as life, and the bed, of dark green stuff or purple velvet, presenting even a funereal appearance? Will not your heart sink within you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Our friend smiled thoughtfully. [...] "Why, {{that is very}} curious! Do {{you know}} that in Fifth Avenue the American type seems to have got back its old supremacy? It is as if no other would so well suit with that sublimity! I have not heard that race-suicide has been {{pronounced}} by the courts amenable to our wise State law against felo de se, but in the modern Fifth Avenue {{it is as if}} our stirp had suddenly reclaimed its old-time sovereignty. I don't say that there are not other faces, other tongues than ours to be seen, heard, there; far from it! But I do say it is a sense of the American face, the American tongue, which prevails. Once more, after long exile in the streets of our own metropolis, <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>yourself</b> <b>in</b> an American city. Your native features, your native accents, have returned in such force from abroad, or have thronged here in such multitude from the prospering Pittsburgs, Cincinnatis, Chicagos, St. Louises, and San Franciscos of the West, that you feel as much at home in Fifth Avenue as you would in Piccadilly, or in the Champs Elysées, or on the Pincian Hill. Yes, it is very curious." ...|$|E
