You meet bad things. These are stories of contact and conflict, of a border that is more cultural than political." [...] According to Haaretz, [...] "excavation directors Prof. Shlomo Bunimovitz and Dr. Zvi Lederman of Tel Aviv University say they do not suggest that the human figure on the seal is the biblical Samson. Rather, the geographical proximity to the area where Samson lived, and the time period of the seal, show that a story was being told at the time of a hero who fought a lion, and that the story eventually found its way into the biblical text and onto the seal." ...|$|E

The game entered the manufacturing stage on November 5. On November 8, IGN gave a full preview, again praising the graphics, and writing [...] "This game is running on a rock-solid 3D engine with completely rotatable dungeons, brilliant animation for nearly every interactive element (of which there are many), and first-rate lighting effects of all different kinds [...] In the beginning, simple refined touches are impressive, amid the generally sharp atmosphere of the game (while there is no visible aliasing, the graphics aren't heavily filtered, either). Even when all <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> are rats, and all <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> with is a dagger, you can admire how barrels come apart when you smash them, in realistically shaded pieces and a puff of dust, or all the different limbs you can bloodily excise from your foes." [...] The game was shipped by Black Isle Studios on December 3.|$|E

2500|$|In a 2000 {{article in}} The New Yorker Alex Ross {{described}} him as a bully. Boulez did not disagree: “Certainly I was a bully. I’m not ashamed of it at all. The hostility of the establishment to what {{you were able to}} do in the Forties and Fifties was very strong. Sometimes <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> against your society.” Boulez's hostility was not only directed against the establishment. When, in 1951, Henri Dutilleux, who was only {{a few years older than}} Boulez, presented his First Symphony, Boulez greeted him by turning his back. As Dutilleux said many years later: [...] "the problem was he had a lot more power than me. Indeed, he has often seemed to enjoy expressing his contempt for other musicians who do not share his musical views." [...] The most notorious instance of this is Boulez's declaration in 1952 that [...] "any musician who has not experienced‍—‌I do not say understood, but truly experienced‍—‌the necessity of dodecaphonic music is USELESS. For his whole work is irrelevant to the needs of his epoch." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sega {{attempted}} to emulate this success with their Alex Kidd series, {{which began in}} 1986 on the Master System with Alex Kidd in Miracle World. [...] It's a platformer that features horizontal and vertical scrolling levels, the ability to punch enemies and obstacles, and shops where the player can buy power-ups and vehicles. Some of the bosses are fought through a minigame of rock-paper-scissors where others <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> or crash the Sukopako [...] "motorbike" [...] into a pirate bear. The environments are varied, including mountains, caves, oceans, forests, and underwater segments. Another Sega platformer series that began that same year is Wonder Boy. The original Wonder Boy in 1986 was inspired more by Pac-Land than Super Mario Bros, and features skateboarding segments that gives the game {{a greater sense of}} speed than other platformers at the time, while its sequel, Wonder Boy in Monster Land, takes the series in a new direction by combining action-adventure and action role-playing elements with traditional platforming. Wonder Boy in turn inspired platformers such as Adventure Island, Dynastic Hero, Popful Mail, and Shantae.|$|E

We may not have that answer for our fans, which is disappointing, but we did try, and that's more than a lot of people." [...] O'Day said that though she is pursuing her own career as a solo artist, she would never turn down the chance to get onstage with her former bandmates. [...] "I have so much respect for that situation, if there was ever interest in me coming back ... and making music with the girls, I would never say no to something like that," [...] she said. [...] "In regards to the other negativity, I really just chose not to comment," [...] said O'Day. [...] "I wrote a blog on my MySpace page, and if anyone wants to know how I feel, they can go there." [...] O'Day later seemed to have more of a positive feeling about the whole situation. She stated, [...] "After being kicked out, I learned <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> to stay happy, and that takes forgiveness of yourself." ...|$|E

5000|$|Shadow and Bone is Bardugo’s first novel. When Entertainment Weekly {{questioned}} Bardugo {{about her}} {{inspiration for the}} series, she explained, [...] "In most fantasy, darkness is metaphorical; it’s {{just a way of}} talking about evil (darkness falls across the land, a dark age is coming, etc.). I wanted to take something figurative and make it literal. So the question became, 'What if darkness was a place?' What if the monsters lurking there were real and more horrible than anything you’d ever imagined beneath your bed or behind the closet door? What if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> them on their own territory, blind and helpless in the dark? These ideas eventually became the Shadow Fold." ...|$|R

60|$|Well, wise work is, briefly, {{work with}} God. Foolish work is work against God. And work done with God, which He will help, may be briefly {{described}} as 'Putting in Order'--that is, enforcing God's law of order, spiritual and material, over men and things. The {{first thing you}} have to do, essentially; the real 'good work' is, with respect to men, to enforce justice, and with respect to things, to enforce tidiness, and fruitfulness. And against these two great human deeds, justice and order, there are perpetually two great demons contending,--the devil of iniquity, or inequity, and the devil of disorder, or of death; for death is only consummation of disorder. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> these two fiends daily. So far as you don't fight against the fiend of iniquity, you work for him. You 'work iniquity,' and the judgment upon you, for all your 'Lord, Lord's,' will be 'Depart from me, ye that work iniquity.' And so far as you do not resist the fiend of disorder, you work disorder, and you yourself do the work of Death, which is sin, and has for its wages, Death himself.|$|E

The pheasant and the fox are bred to give pleasure by their chase; they are tenderly cared for and watched over and kept from harm {{at the hands of}} all who do not wish to kill them for the joy of killing, and they are not so elusive but they can be seen by easy chance. The pheasant especially has at times all but the boldness of the barnyard in his fearless port. Once from my passing train, I saw him {{standing in the middle of}} a ploughed field, erect, distinct, like a statue of himself, commemorative of the long ages in which his heroic death and martyr sufferance have formed the pride of princes and the peril of poachers. But I never once saw him shot, though almost as many gunners pursue him as there are pheasants in the land. This alone shows how shy the gunners are; and when once I saw the trail of a fox-hunt from the same coign of vantage without seeing the fox, I felt that I had almost indecently come upon the horse and hounds, and that the pink coats and the flowery spread of the dappled dogs over the field were mine by a kind of sneak as base as killing a fox to save my hens.|$|E
