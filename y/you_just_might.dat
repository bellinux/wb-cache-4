And well they just didn't make it that easy for me, did they? So I might've shot a gun once or twice again, but it wasn't my fault. You know what, people get what they deserve, they really do. I might've poisoned someone by accident, but he never should've talked to me like that. You just don't do that. Anyway, people get what they deserve, and I think a lot of them have what's coming to them, and I'm not sure I'm done yet." [...] About Sheila's personality, Brown said: [...] "Sheila's just evil. There's nothing bitchy about what she does, [...] it's very straightforward. She's manipulative but never in a bitchy way, in a way to get things accomplished, and get things done the way she wants to. When being nice and being diplomatic and when being all those things don't work any longer, she snaps." [...] On Sheila's relationship with Stephanie Forrester, Brown said: [...] "Stephanie made my life miserable. So anyway, I shot Stephanie. I did. Stephanie felt she could be a better provider for my child than I could. And you know what, you don't keep a mother like Sheila away from her child, you just don't do that. And Stephanie couldn't stop me." [...] Brown also added that, [...] "To be a good villain, you have to make the character real for you." ...|$|E

However, if you are a strategist who enjoys a slow-paced, turn-based game then you will not find anything better than Planetarion.

5000|$|The final {{lines of}} the poem differ {{somewhat}} from the preceding stanzas, and arguably even move beyond the strict theme of prayer: 'To the world you might be one person, But to one person <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>might</b> be the world.' In terms of broader thematic parallels, such a play on the words 'one person' and 'world' can {{be compared with the}} notion of microcosm in universality, which also expresses something of the cultural contribution of, and human interest in, the small nation of Nauru. The personhood / world dichotomy, pithily expressed here by Gobure, is also a theme taken up in writing commanding universal interest. The Evangelist John's words are apposite: 'He came into the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.' (John 1.10) ...|$|E
