50|$|The {{solenette}} or <b>yellow</b> <b>sole,</b> Buglossidium luteum, is {{a species}} of flatfish in the family Soleidae, and {{the only member of}} its genus. It is characterized by its small size, low-slung semi-circular mouth, and regularly placed dark fin rays. A common and widespread species, it is native to sandy bottoms in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. It is of little commercial value.|$|E

50|$|The Wellington {{green gecko}} {{is much larger}} and more heavily built than the Auckland green gecko and can be {{distinguished}} by the <b>yellow</b> <b>soles</b> on its feet instead of grey-green. It lives arboreally in scrub and forest areas, especially kanuka and manuka. Although it hunts nocturnally, for moths and flies, it also likes to sun-bask. It displays an aggressive behaviour, baring its open blue mouth and barking if provoked.|$|R
60|$|You {{tossed a}} blanket from the bed, You lay upon your back, and waited; You dozed, {{and watched the}} night {{revealing}} The thousand sordid images Of which your soul was constituted; They flickered against the ceiling. And when all the world came back And the light crept up between the shutters, And you heard the sparrows in the gutters, You had such {{a vision of the}} street As the street hardly understands; Sitting along the bed's edge, where You curled the papers from your hair, Or clasped the <b>yellow</b> <b>soles</b> of feet In the palms of both soiled hands.|$|R

50|$|Consumption of {{very large}} amounts of papaya may cause carotenemia, {{harmless}} <b>yellowing</b> of <b>soles</b> and palms. A very large dose {{would need to be}} consumed; papaya contains about 6% of the level of beta carotene found in carrots (the most common cause of carotenemia).|$|R
5000|$|The Air Jordan VII was {{released}} in 1992 with a new design by Tinker Hatfield. This shoe introduced the huarache technology which allowed the shoes to better conform to the users foot. A few things were no longer featured on the new model, such as the visible air sole, the Nike Air logo, and the <b>yellowing</b> <b>soles.</b> This was the first Air-Jordan in the line {{that did not have}} any distinctive [...] "Nike Air" [...] on the outer portions of the shoe. The [...] "Nike Air" [...] branding was still on the in-soles, which Air Jordans VIII-XI also had. The VIIs were also known for a successful ad campaign in which Bugs Bunny appeared alongside Michael Jordan to market the shoes.|$|R
50|$|Charmander {{is known}} as the Lizard Pokémon. Charmander are small, bipedal lizard-like Pokémon native to Kanto. They have blue eyes, red-orange skin, three-clawed toes, yellow bellies, and <b>yellow</b> <b>soles</b> under their feet. The end of a Charmander's tail is alight with a flame, and the flame's size {{reflects}} both the physical health and the emotions of the individual. When it rains, steam is said to spout from the tip of its tail. If the flame were to ever go out, the Charmander would die. When Charmander receives enough experience from battles, it evolves into Charmeleon (at level 16 in the video games), and later Charizard. With the help of the Mega Stone it could further evolve into Mega Charizard X/Mega Charizard Y. The idea to feature Charmander and the other Red and Blue starters in a significant role in Pokémon X and Y came {{about a year and a}} half into the development of the games. The Mega Evolutions for the three Pokémon's final forms were created, and the designers decided that they should give players an opportunity to find one of these Pokémon in order to see their Mega Evolved form.|$|R
50|$|In Digimon Adventure 02, set in 2002, Tai is 14 {{years old}} and has more hair. He usually wears the Odaiba Middle School uniform; a white buttoned shirt with long sleeves, under an opened green shirt with long sleeves, gray pants, and white and blue sneakers. Originally, Tai wore his goggles but gave them to Davis on the younger boy's first day in the Digital World. In the summer, he wears a green shirt under a blue T-shirt with a yellow border on the top, a yellow {{triangle}} on each sleeve, and a yellow triangle in the middle, which is cut by a yellow line. He also wears yellow wristbands on his hands, light brown shorts, gray socks, and blue and yellow sneakers with white soles. The series epilogue, which takes place in 2027 depicts Tai as a 39-year-old with his hair cut {{who works as a}} diplomat for the United Nations representing the Digital World. While his causal attire is yellow shirt under a zipped grayish blue jacket with a blue collar, wears blue pants and blue shoes with <b>yellow</b> <b>soles,</b> his business attire is a white shirt under a black suit, and a blue tie.|$|R

50|$|The {{crown and}} nape are black, with the {{individual}} feathers rather long and loosely arranged, tipped with buff narrowly barred with black. The sides {{of the head and}} neck are a more uniform tawny-buff, irregularly barred with black. The mantle, scapulars and back are of a similar colour but are more heavily barred, the individual feathers having black centres and barring. The head has a yellowish-buff superciliary stripe and a brownish-black moustachial stripe. The sides of the neck are a rusty-brown with faint barring. The chin and throat are buff, the central feathers on the throat having longitudinal stripes of rusty-brown. The breast and belly are yellowish-buff, with broad stripes of brown at the side and narrow stripes in the centre. The tail is rusty-buff with black streaks in the centre and black mottling near the edge. The wings are pale rusty-brown irregularly barred, streaked and mottled with black. The plumage has a loose texture, and elongated feathers on the crown, neck and breast can be erected. The powerful bill is greenish-yellow with a darker tip to the upper mandible. The eye has a yellow iris and is surrounded by a ring of greenish or bluish bare skin. The legs and feet are greenish, with some yellow on the tarsal joint and <b>yellow</b> <b>soles</b> to the feet. Juveniles have similar plumage to adults but are somewhat paler with less distinct markings.|$|R
50|$|This {{is a large}} species {{growing to}} at least 115 mm. It can be {{distinguished}} by its numerous (3 to 6), longitudinal, tuberculate notal ridges. The ridge and bases of the tubercles are a blue-grey colour. The tubercles are capped in <b>yellow.</b> The foot <b>sole</b> has a black longitudinal foot stripe. The rhinophoral clavus possesses 27 to 30 lamellae.|$|R
5000|$|This slug is 1.5 to 2 centimeters long. It is {{variable}} {{in color and}} patterning, being white, orange, or gray, with or without banding, and it has gray tentacles and a <b>yellow</b> or orange <b>sole.</b> It becomes compact and [...] "nearly bell-shaped" [...] when contracted. The tubercles that texture the dorsal surface of its body taper to sharp, prickle-like points, inspiring the common name hedgehog slug.|$|R
50|$|The owl limpet {{grows to}} {{a length of}} up to nine centimetres. The often much eroded shell has an {{elongated}} low cone shape with the apex close to one end. The anterior slope is concave. The general colour is brownish grey with pale markings and the foot is pale grey with a <b>yellow</b> or orange <b>sole.</b> There is also a small form that lives on the shells of mussels. It is even more elongated, up to twenty-five millimetres long, and dark blue with concentric growth rings. Its foot and head are entirely black.|$|R
60|$|I boated to the Holy Port in 1862, when Messieurs Blandy's {{steamship}} Falcon {{was not in}} existence. And now as the Luso steamed along shore, no external change appeared. A {{bird's-eye view}} of the islet suggests a podão or Madeiran billhook, about six miles by three. The tool's broken point is the Ilha da Cima, facing to north-east, a contorted pile which resembles a magnified cinder. The handle is the Ilheu Baixo, to the south; and the blade is the tract of <b>yellow</b> sandy lowlands--the <b>sole</b> specimen of its sort in the Madeiras--connecting the extremities. Three tall cones at once disclose vulcanism; the Pico de Facho, or Beacon Peak (1,660 feet), the Pico de Anna Ferreira (910 feet), and the sugarloaf Pico de Castello (1,447 feet). The latter rises immediately north of the single town, and its head still shows in white points {{the ruins of the}} fort which more than once saved the population from the 'Moors.' The lower levels are terraced, as usual in this archipelago, and the valleys are green with vines and cereals. The little white Villa Baleira is grouped around its whiter church, and dotted with dark vegetation, trees, and houses, straggling off into open country. Here lodge the greater part of the islanders, now nearly 1,750 souls. The population is far too thick. But the law of Portugal has, till lately, forbidden emigration to the islanders unless a substitute for military service be provided; the force consists of only 250 men, and the term of service is three years; yet a remplaçant costs upwards of 50l. Every emigrant was, therefore, an energetic stowaway, who landed at Honolulu or Demerara without shoes and stockings, and returned in a few years with pounds sterling enough to purchase an estate and a pardon. Half-a-dozen boats, some of them neat little feluccas with three masts, are drawn up on the beach: there is not much fishing; the vine-disease has raged, and the staple export consists of maize in some quantities; of cantaria, a grey trachyte which works more freely than the brown or black basalt, and of an impure limestone from Ilheu Baixo, the only calcaire used in Funchal. This rock is apparently an elevated coral-reef: it also produces moulds of sea-shells, delicately traced and embedded in blocks of apparently unbroken limestone. Of late a fine vein of manganese has been found in the northern or mountainous part of the island: specimens shown to me by Mr. J. Blandy appeared remarkably rich.|$|R
5000|$|I An old man sits In {{the shadow}} of a pine tree In China. He sees larkspur, Blue and white, At the edge of the shadow, Move in the wind. His beard moves in the wind. The pine tree moves in the wind. Thus water flows Over weeds. II The night is of the colour Of a woman's arm: Night, the female, Obscure, Fragrant and supple, Conceals herself. A pool shines, Like a {{bracelet}} Shaken in a dance. III I measure myself Against a tall tree. I find that I am much taller, For I reach right up to the sun, With my eye; And I reach to the shore of the sea With my ear. Nevertheless, I dislike The way ants crawl In and out of my shadow. IV When my dream was near the moon, The white folds of its gown Filled with <b>yellow</b> light. The <b>soles</b> of its feet Grew red. Its hair filled With certain blue crystallizations From stars, Not far off. V Not all the knives of the lamp-posts, Nor the chisels of the long streets, Nor the mallets of the domes And high towers, Can carve What one star can carve, Shining through the grape-leaves. VI Rationalists, wearing square hats, Think, in square rooms, Looking at the floor, Looking at the ceiling. They confine themselves To right-angled triangles. If they tried rhomboids, Cones, waving lines, ellipses -- As, for example, the ellipse of the half-moon -- Rationalists would wear sombreros. [...] Each of these six landscapes of the imagination is a poem in its own right, each conveying an image, simply sculpted and precise, contributing to a pastiche effect. The first displays the influence of haiku and orientalism on Stevens, the second evokes the romantic mystery of night, the third is a wry comment about the duality of the human condition, the dream in the fourth bears comparison to Klee and Chagall, the fifth acknowledges the subtlety of nature, and the sixth associates this subtlety with a reality that evades a rationalist point of view. The sixth can also be understood as Stevens's gentle contribution to the ancient quarrel between philosophical reason and poetic imagination, recommending that philosophers trade in their square hats for sombreros. Buttel appreciates in the fourth landscape a hallucinatory effect such that [...] "space shrinks, the imagination expands, and the illogical perspective surprises the reader into a recognition of heavenly grandeur". Apropos of the first landscape, he cites Earl Miner in support of the idea that [...] "the objectivity, indirectness, and condensation of the haiku technique seem to have had a more beneficial and lasting effect on his style than the merely ornamental details of orientalism". Buttel reads the fifth landscape as a reaction against [...] "Romantic softness" [...] in favor of [...] "hard clarity", in the spirit of Imagism. The poem's central symbol is not something beyond the poem or something merely intimated by it, but is rather in the star, in the manner that Ezra Pound and the Symbolists recommended.|$|R
