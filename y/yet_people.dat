25|$|Within Shinto it is {{believed}} that the nature of life is sacred, because the kami began human life. <b>Yet</b> <b>people</b> cannot perceive this divine nature, which the kami created, on their own; therefore, magokoro, or purification, is necessary in order to see the divine nature. This purification can only be granted by the kami. In order to please the kami and earn magokoro, Shinto followers are taught to uphold the four affirmations of Shinto.|$|E
25|$|Lack of {{behavior}} change: Some communities have toilets, <b>yet</b> <b>people</b> prefer to defecate in the open. In some cases, these toilets {{are provided by}} the government or other organizations and the people do not like them, or do not value them. They continue to defecate in the open. Also, older people are often found to defecate in the open and they are hesitant to change their behavior and go inside a closed toilet.|$|E

40|$|Urban {{places are}} {{typically}} designed and represented as static images. <b>Yet</b> <b>people’s</b> dynamic engagement with city space, that includes memory of other places, {{is a significant}} factor in place-making. Through visual research, autoethnography and art installation this thesis visualises urban place as a lived, shifting, interwoven place and as a nexus for communication acts. The author’s participatory exhibition of layered, malleable and fragmented representations contributes to our understandings of urban places and memory...|$|R
25|$|After Wilma passed, a {{sense of}} desperation {{developed}} in the region because people were being held in shelters due to the extensive damage. Thousands of tourists remained stranded in shelters, and the priority was to send them home immediately, according to President Vicente Fox. Buses arrived in Cancún from Mérida, where tourists were hoping to find flights home. The United States embassy told tourists to go to Mérida, although {{the next day they}} had to change their announcements because Mérida had become so packed with people. The road to Mérida was very dangerous and practically impassable for taxis, <b>yet</b> <b>people</b> dealt with the exorbitant fees being charged for passage.|$|E
25|$|Every {{hierarchy}} {{for working}} models includes both general working models (higher in the hierarchy) and relationship-specific working models (lower in the hierarchy). Studies {{have supported the}} existence of both general working models and relationship-specific working models. People can report a general attachment style when asked to do so, {{and the majority of}} their relationships are consistent with their general attachment style. A general attachment style indicates a general working model that applies to many relationships. <b>Yet,</b> <b>people</b> also report different styles of attachments to their friends, parents and lovers. Relationship-specific attachment styles indicate relationship-specific working models. Evidence that general working models and relationship-specific working models are organized into a hierarchy comes from a study by Overall, Fletcher and Friesen.|$|E
500|$|... {{there is}} a {{standard}} of righteousness that might does not make right, that the end does not justify the means, and that expediency as a working principle is bound to fail. The only hope of perfecting human relationships is {{in accordance with the}} law of service under which men are not so solicitous about what they shall get as they are about what they shall give. <b>Yet</b> <b>people</b> are entitled to the rewards of their industry. What they earn is theirs, no matter how small or how great. But the possession of property carries the obligation to use it in a larger service...|$|E

500|$|The {{only other}} times he rode it were in 1980, when he {{finished}} fourth, and in 1982, as the defending champion. When he was criticised, he said: [...] "I don't go into offices and tell people to work harder, <b>yet</b> <b>people</b> ask {{me to be the}} strongest on the cobbles." [...] Hinault fell seven times in that race, including 13km from the finish when a small black dog called Gruson ran out in a bend and ran under his wheel. Hinault had been clear with Roger De Vlaeminck, Hennie Kuiper and Marc Demeyer. The incident made Hinault angry and he raced back to the others and won in Roubaix.|$|E
500|$|A {{streaming}} free {{live performance}} was hosted by iTunes on 9 February 2012. McCartney performed live from Capitol Studios in Los Angeles, {{where much of}} the album was recorded. People tuned into the show by accessing iTunes on their PCs or Macintosh computers. The live performance was later released, as Paul McCartney's Live Kisses, directed by Jonas Åkerlund, airing on PBS' Great Performances in September 2012. The performance was released on DVD and Blu-ray on 13 November 2012. In an interview with Billboard, McCartney said that he didn't rule out the possibility of a tour of the album with the musicians who played on it: [...] "We haven't really talked about it <b>yet.</b> <b>People</b> have plenty of ideas and suggestions. I'd like to see how it goes live, just how much we enjoy it. If we all enjoy it, then we've got to think about taking it out." ...|$|E
2500|$|To the outsider, {{it seems}} incomprehensible that anyone should admire, let alone acquire {{an animal that}} has {{difficulty}} in breathing or walking. <b>Yet</b> <b>people</b> are passionate about owning and breeding animals which they know and love, even though the animals manifestly exhibit serious health and welfare problems... Notwithstanding the motivations of the breeders, the time has surely come for Society as a whole to take {{a firm grip on}} the welfare [...] issues that evidently arise in dog breeding.|$|E

50|$|Fractionalism is the {{government}} system that is the closest to a confederation but differs when the market system is a central market owned mostly by {{the government}} and very little by the <b>people,</b> <b>yet</b> the <b>people</b> have more control over it than the control of the government. This is possible by the fact that in fractionalism, the central government, on the federal level, is made up of several levels to ensure the utmost security for the people's government.|$|R
60|$|The consternation of the Revolutionary Committee, {{no longer}} {{sustained}} by Colonna, absent in France, was complete. Had the advanced guard of Garibaldi been in sight, it might {{still have been}} the wisest course to rise; but Monte Mario was not <b>yet</b> <b>peopled</b> by them, and an insurrection against the papal troops, reanimated by the reported arrival of the French, and increased in numbers by the fugitives from Viterbo, would have been certainly a rash and probably a hopeless effort. And so, {{in the midst of}} confused and hesitating councils, the first division of the French force arrived at the gates of Rome, and marched into the gloomy and silent city.|$|R
2500|$|On May 5, 2013, Savant made {{an error}} in a {{combinatorics}} problem. The question was how many 4-digit briefcase combinations contain a particular digit (say 5, for example). She said the answer was 4000, <b>yet</b> <b>people</b> showed the correct answer—3439—using various strategies. [...] The incorrect answer of 4000 counted those combinations {{with more than one}} [...] "5" [...] multiple times (twice for [...] "1535", three times for [...] "1555", for instance). [...] So, the correct answer is to take all possible combinations minus the combinations in which each digit is not a 5 to the nth power, or 10,000 - 94 = 3439.|$|E
2500|$|A {{bottleneck}} in a person's cognitive navigational {{system could}} be disastrous, for instance if there were need for a sudden detour on a long road trip. And <b>yet,</b> <b>people</b> are still capable of getting place to place functionally. Lack of experience in a locale, or simply sheer size, can disorient one's mental layout, especially in a large and unfamiliar place with lots of overwhelming stimuli. In these environments people are still able to orient themselves, and even find their way around using landmarks. This ability to [...] "prioritize objects and regions in complex scenes for selection (and) recognition" [...] was labeled by Chun and Jiang in 1998. Landmarks give people guidance by activating [...] "learned associations between the global context and target locations." [...] Mallot and Gillner (2000) showed that subjects learned an association between a specific landmark and {{the direction of a}} turn, thereby furthering the relationship between associations and landmarks. Shelton and McNamara (2001) succinctly summed up why landmarks, as markers, are so helpful: [...] "location...cannot be described without making reference to the orientation of the observer." ...|$|E
2500|$|Michael Musto of The Village Voice {{commented on}} the media's {{reaction}} to the incident, saying, [...] "Janet became a symbolic Joan of Arc to burn at the stake. I actually do think her breast {{was used as a}} diversionary tactic – I'm not sure to distract from Iraq specifically – but it did distract from important issues, from things we actually should be appalled by. The story got an undue amount of attention when the fact is, nobody has proved how her breast harmed anyone." [...] Speaking to Robert Tannenbaum of Blender Magazine, Jackson had strong, if guarded, views on the reactions, saying the furor [...] "is hypocritical, with everything you see on TV. There are more important thing to focus on than a woman's body part, which is a beautiful thing. There's war, famine, homelessness, AIDS". The fact that it happened in an election year [...] "did have {{a great deal to do}} with it. They needed something to focus on instead of the war, and I was the perfect vehicle for that. People are going to think what they want. It was an accident. It was not a stunt. That was embarrassing for me to have all those people see my breast. That's like having your penis hanging out in front of millions and millions of people." [...] Janet declared the reaction to the accidental exposure as [...] "contradictory", noting it to occur in an era where commercials for beer and Viagra are both [...] "very sexual" [...] and [...] "practically omnipresent". Jackson also said the mishap was [...] "not intentional" [...] and a [...] "costume accident", also commenting on some media outlets editing her taped apology, saying, [...] "Sometimes they cut out that I said it was an accident...That's what the media does, that's the way they are because they want it to be told a different way." [...] In Glamour Magazine, Janet exclaimed, [...] "It's hard to believe that there's a war and famine going on in the world and <b>yet</b> <b>people</b> made such a big deal about a breast. People said that it was done intentionally to sell records. Do you know what? I have never pulled a stunt. Why would you do that and have your album come out two months later? It doesn't make sense." [...] In the ensuing months, Janet felt overwhelmed by the hostility towards her. [...] "People think I'm immune to being hurt by what's said. They ask me questions that shock me. Not everybody is as strong as the next person and words can kill. People push you and you start to think, 'Can I handle this?' But I know I can." ...|$|E
