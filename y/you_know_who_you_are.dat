500|$|Reviewing the CD-ROM based Saturn port, EGM {{commented that}} the {{graphics}} are identical to the arcade version but that there are missing sound effects and [...] "unbearable" [...] slowdown when first performing a special move. They rated it the best home version of the game to date but felt that with Mortal Kombat II having considerably aged by this point, any port needed to be near arcade perfect to stand out. Next Generation felt that the Saturn version was arcade perfect, but that the Mortal Kombat series {{as a whole was}} grossly overrated and lacked any gameplay innovations to make it stand out from other fighting games. They summarized that [...] "if you are a fan of the game (and <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> <b>are),</b> then the Saturn version is everything you can hope for - an arcade-perfect translation - and yet, there is nothing outside of a flashy presentation and a little gore to recommend this game over a million others just like it." [...] Scary Larry of GamePro agreed that the Saturn port [...] "duplicates the arcade version perfectly", but argued that the slowdown and load times make the game frustrating to play. He concluded that the conversion would make a decent holdover until Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 hit the Saturn, but fails to measure up to Mortal Kombat 3 on the PlayStation. Sega Saturn Magazine was extremely disappointed with {{the final version of the}} Saturn port, calling it [...] "much worse than any of the versions seen on the cartridge format," [...] as opposed to the vastly superior pre-release version they had reviewed five months earlier.|$|E
500|$|... "Breakaway" [...] {{has also}} been covered by contestants from reality {{television}} singing competitions. Katie Stevens covered the song on the ninth season of American Idol. Despite listening to the judges' comments to sing a contemporary song, her rendition was criticized from the judges; Randy Jackson thought the note was too big for Stevens while Ellen DeGeneres felt Stevens did not sell the lyrics. Kara DioGuardi said, [...] "I don't think <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> yet as an artist", an opinion agreed by Simon Cowell. Jim Cantiello of MTV noted that Stevens' performance of the song was her weakest performance in the show, stating [...] "Unfortunately, her uneven vocals on 'Breakaway' exposed her youthful inexperience." [...] The same opinion was echoed by Eric Ditzian of MTV who opined that Stevens failed to resonate her youthful energy favouring the song choice. [...] "Breakaway" [...] was performed by Julie Zorrilla in the semi-finals of American Idol season 10. Samantha Stephens of The Republican felt Zorrilla's performance was mediocre. Gil Kaufman of MTV remarked that Zorrilla's voice was shaky and it lacked personality. After landing in the bottom two, Belle Amie, an English pop quartet contestant on the seventh season of The X Factor, decided to perform [...] "Breakaway" [...] as their survival song. Nevertheless, they were eliminated in the episode. Swedish Idol contestant, Alice Hagenbrant covered the song which appeared in Det bästa från Idol, an album released from the musical competition. The song was also performed by Megan Hilty on the episode titled [...] "Understudy" [...] of the American television series Smash, which aired on April 7, 2012. Matt Tucker of KSiteTV.com thought the performance was [...] "lovely", describing {{it as one of}} the things that stood out in the episode. The song was covered by Jenna Ushkowitz, Kevin McHale and Darren Criss, on the 97th episode, [...] "Frenemies", of the musical series Glee, which aired on February 25, 2014. For the thirteenth season of American Idol, the song is used as the send off song when a contestant is voted off. The contestant who is voted off, their cover of the song is played during the goodbye montage video package. It was also used in thirtieth season of Brazilian soap opera Malhação.|$|E

2500|$|Virgo is the eponymous debut studio album by American house music duo Virgo, {{released}} in 1989 on Radical Records in the United Kingdom. It compiles two 12" [...] EPs {{released in}} the United States on Trax Records, Do <b>You</b> <b>Know</b> <b>Who</b> <b>You</b> <b>Are?</b> by Virgo Four and Ride by M.E.. Both were pseudonyms of Eric Lewis and Merwyn Sanders, two art students and childhood friends from Chicago. The album was first reissued in 2010 on Rush Hour Recordings.|$|E
2500|$|Virgo {{was also}} {{included}} in The Guardians 2007 list of the 1000 Albums to Hear Before You Die, and [...] In a retrospective review, Richard Carnes of Resident Advisor awarded the album {{four and a half}} out of five stars, calling Do <b>You</b> <b>Know</b> <b>Who</b> <b>You</b> <b>Are?</b> [...] "the finest house music 12-inch ever created." [...] He also considered [...] "Take Me Higher" [...] to be [...] "one of the best electronic music tracks of all time." [...] "In a Vision" [...] was included in the 1999 compilation , therefore being recognized as an influence in the IDM style pioneered by Warp Records.|$|E
2500|$|When they {{approached}} Trax Records, Sanders and Lewis called themselves M.E., {{a reference to}} their initials, [...] "with a possible nod to the Gary Numan tune {{of the same name}} as well." [...] However, and despite Sanders' complaints, label head Larry Sherman insisted in releasing half of the material under the pseudonym Virgo Four as an effort to associate the duo with Virgo, a sort of supergroup consisting of Marshall Jefferson, Vince Lawrence, and Adonis. In 1989, the material was released as two 12" [...] EPs in the United States - Do <b>You</b> <b>Know</b> <b>Who</b> <b>You</b> <b>Are?</b> by Virgo Four, and later Ride by M.E. The same year, the tracks were compiled and released as a CD album titled Virgo in the United Kingdom. It was licensed to Radical Records (also known as Radikal), the house offshoot of 80s urban label StreetSounds. Since its release, several bootleg editions of the album appeared.|$|E

2500|$|The first side of Virgo {{includes}} Virgo Four's Do <b>You</b> <b>Know</b> <b>Who</b> <b>You</b> <b>Are?</b> EP. Its opening track, [...] "Do You Know Who You Are", {{features an}} [...] "odd, nagging, guitar line" [...] reminiscent of funk music. Following track [...] "In a Vision" [...] {{has been described}} as [...] "strutting space-age bleep-house". Electro rhythms can be heard on [...] "Take Me Higher", a track with [...] "euphorically melancholic reggaematics". Richard Carnes of Resident Advisor felt that [...] "Going Thru Life"'s [...] "lolloping piano riff" [...] showcases the duo's [...] "visceral approach to music making." [...] He also considered that the Ride material - included as the album's second side - [...] "should really be looked upon as a different entity to the first half", as it features a [...] "darker and more vocal-led direction to their first EP." [...] He added that Ride [...] "could easily slot into a set of contemporary techno." [...] A [...] "low-slung house" [...] track, [...] "School Hall" [...] alludes to the high school parties were Lewis and Sanders were introduced to house music. [...] "Never Want To Lose You" [...] has been referred to as [...] "jacking balladry". Closing track [...] "All the Time" [...] {{has been described as}} [...] "a spirited attempt to introduce the sound of slap bass into the lexicon of house." ...|$|E

[...] These comments are likely directed towards TVT Records' Steve Gottlieb, who refused to let Reznor out of his contract, sparking legal battles between the two parties. The [...] "no thanks" [...] part may be a response to the liner notes of Ministry's Psalm 69: The Way to Succeed and the Way to Suck Eggs album, which featured a cryptic [...] "no thanks, <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> are."
