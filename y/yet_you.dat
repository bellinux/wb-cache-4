Sometimes one needs advice, but one must study... All of us, that is, I myself and Borodin, and Balakirev, and {{especially}} Cui and Mussorgsky, did disdain these things. I consider myself lucky that I bethought myself in time and forced myself to work. As for Balakirev, owing to his insufficient technique he writes little; Borodin, with difficulty; Cui, carelessly; and Mussorgsky, sloppily and often incoherently.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{the lack}} of a system for {{checking}} for copying errors, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has a more rapid rate of variation than nuclear DNA. This 20-fold higher mutation rate allows mtDNA to be used for more accurate tracing of maternal ancestry. Studies of mtDNA in populations have allowed ancient migration paths to be traced, such as the migration of Native Americans from Siberia or Polynesians from southeastern Asia. It has also been used to show that there is no trace of Neanderthal DNA in the European gene mixture inherited through purely maternal lineage. Due to the restrictive all or none manner of mtDNA inheritance, this result (no trace of Neanderthal mtDNA) would be likely unless there were a large percentage of Neanderthal ancestry, or there was strong positive selection for that mtDNA (for example, going back 5 generations, only 1 of your 32 ancestors contributed to your mtDNA, so if one of these 32 was pure Neanderthal you would expect that ~3% of your autosomal DNA would be of Neanderthal origin, <b>yet</b> <b>you</b> would have a ~97% chance to have no trace of Neanderthal mtDNA).|$|E

500|$|Arriving at Wessagusset, Standish {{found that}} many of the Englishmen had gone to live with the Massachusetts, and he ordered them to be called back to Wessagusset. [...] Pecksuot was a Massachusett warrior and leader of the group {{threatening}} Wessagusset; he came to the settlement with Wituwamat and other warriors the day after Standish's arrival. [...] Standish claimed simply to be in Wessagusset on a trading mission, but Pecksuot said to Hobbamock, [...] "Let him begin when he dare... he shall not take us unawares." [...] Later in the day, Pecksuot approached Standish, looking down on him, and said, [...] "You are a great captain, <b>yet</b> <b>you</b> are but a little man. Though I be no sachem, yet I am of great strength and courage." ...|$|E
500|$|Executive {{producer}} Diederick Santer {{has discussed}} the [...] "wonderfully dysfunctional mother-son relationship" [...] Nick shares with Dot and her perpetual willingness to give Nick another chance {{regardless of his}} history of wrongdoing. Santer explained: [...] "There’s that thing where you sort of dare to hope that someone’s changed, which is really tragic. They’ve let you down a hundred times, and <b>yet</b> <b>you</b> still hope that the hundred and first time they’ll have changed." [...] Actor Leslie Grantham has stated that Dot is the [...] "one friend in [...] life", while series story producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins has affirmed: [...] "Dot’s always going to forgive him. And that’s the beauty of Nick and Dot." [...] Concurring with this sentiment, John Altman (Nick) agreed: [...] "No matter what he does, she’ll forgive him. So {{did a lot of}} gangsters' mothers throughout history. Probably Al Capone's mother thought he was a sweet lad, you know." ...|$|E
500|$|Chopin's successes as a {{composer}} and performer {{opened the door}} to western Europe for him, and on 2 November 1830, he set out, in the words of Zdzisław Jachimecki, [...] "into the wide world, with no very clearly defined aim, forever." [...] With Woyciechowski, he headed for Austria again, intending to go on to Italy. Later that month, in Warsaw, the November 1830 Uprising broke out, and Woyciechowski returned to Poland to enlist. Chopin, now alone in Vienna, was nostalgic for his homeland, and wrote to a friend, [...] "I curse the moment of my departure." [...] When in September 1831 he learned, while travelling from Vienna to Paris, that the uprising had been crushed, he expressed his anguish in the pages of his private journal: [...] "Oh God!... You are there, and <b>yet</b> <b>you</b> do not take vengeance!" [...] Jachimecki ascribes to these events the composer's maturing [...] "into an inspired national bard who intuited the past, present and future of his native Poland." ...|$|E

500|$|The pilot episode saw {{a mostly}} {{positive}} reception. Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter wrote [...] "...the entertainment value and suspense of Falling Skies is paced just right. You {{get the sense}} that we'll get those answers eventually. And <b>yet,</b> <b>you</b> want to devour the next episode immediately." [...] Thomas Conner of the Chicago Sun-Times called it [...] "...a trustworthy family drama but with aliens." [...] He continued, [...] "It's 'Jericho' meets 'V', with the good from both and the bad discarded. It'll raise the summer-TV bar significantly." [...] Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly gave the series a B+ and wrote, [...] "A similar, gradually developed, but decisive conviction makes Falling Skies an engaging, if derivative, chunk of dystopian sci-fi." [...] He continued, [...] "...Falling Skies rises above any one performance; it's the spectacle of humans versus aliens that draws you in." [...] In the Boston Herald, Mark A. Perigard gave the series a B grade, writing [...] "Don't look now, but Falling Skies could be a summer obsession." ...|$|E
500|$|Planet Bollywood gave {{a rating}} of a 7 out of 10, {{particularly}} praising the twist ending, and wrote, [...] "The Don of the 21st century is stylish with flaws, <b>yet,</b> <b>you</b> do enjoy the experience of watching it in the cinema." [...] While labelling the film a [...] "disappointment", film critic Sukanya Verma questioned Akhtar's decision behind remaking such an important film. She further criticised Akhtar for taking a fairly simple but engaging storyline, strangling it mercilessly, and {{turning it into a}} shockingly unimaginative adaptation. Verma also found Khan to be inconsistent in the dual roles; however, she praised Chopra's portrayal of Roma, and wrote, [...] "The seriousness with which Priyanka Chopra plays Roma is rather notable. She is a picture of restrained toughness and bubbling seduction." [...] Giving a 1 out of 5, film critic Rajeev Masand panned the film, terming it an exercise in indulgence, and wrote, [...] "Spiffily shot and stylishly packaged, the new Don may wear a new look, but what it's clearly lacking is the raw energy, the unpredictability of Chandra Barot's original thriller." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{ensemble}} {{performances were}} frequently {{mentioned in the}} critiques. Lowry cited the cast {{as one of the}} show's strongest assets, and Robert Biano in USA Today wrote that Fargo cast was [...] "with nary a false note". The Daily Telegraph critic Michael Hogan singled out Dunst, Danson and Wilson for their work on the show, as did the San Francisco Chronicle David Wiegand, whose opinion was that many of the performers' signature roles enhanced Hawley's script. Matt Zoller Seitz of New York magazine found Wilson to be the stand out among a pool of actors that [...] "deserve their own stand-alone appreciations". He said of the actor's performance: [...] "He's a young man, and he's in good shape, but he carries himself like an older, heavier one, as if weighed down by burdens he hasn't fully acknowledged because he's not ready <b>yet.</b> <b>You</b> get a sense of a personality, perhaps a soul, in the process of evolving." [...] Reviews from Entertainment Weekly and The Washington Post singled out Donovan, Smart, Milioti, Garrett, and Offerman for their acting. Grantland, the New York Observer, and the Los Angeles Times also praised the ensemble performances.|$|E

500|$|... "Can't Hold Us Down" [...] lyrically {{discusses}} feminism; {{the song}} criticizes [...] "common" [...] gender-related double standards, {{in which men}} are applauded for their sexual behaviors, while women who behave {{in a similar fashion}} are disdained. In the book Therapeutic Uses of Rap and Hip-Hop, Susan Hadley and George Yancy discuss that [...] "Can't Hold Us Down" [...] is a hip hop song that [...] "encourages young women to be proud, strong, and empowered to be all that they can be". At the song's first verse, Aguilera sings [...] "Call me a bitch 'cause I speak what's on my mind / Guess it's easier for you to swallow if I sat and smiled"; she later rejects that all women [...] "should be seen, not heard" [...] and encourages them to [...] "shout louder" [...] during the chorus. Aguilera comments on the double standard with the lyrics [...] "The guy gets all the glory the more he can score / While the girl can do the same and <b>yet</b> <b>you</b> call her a whore". Lil' Kim shares a similar sentiment during her verse in the bridge, questioning why a man is able to give a woman [...] "some sex or sex her raw" [...] while [...] "if the girl do the same and then she's a whore".|$|E
500|$|The 19th century {{transcription}} of Merina oral history, Tantara ny Andriana eto Madagasikara, relates that Andriamampandry privately {{assessed the}} leadership qualities {{of each of}} the four selected sons, with disappointing results. He presented Andriambonimena of Alasora with a beautiful parrot, which the prince killed and served as food. The elder concluded that he was [...] "a gun that loads itself." [...] The oldest son, Andrianjakanavalonamandimby, was given a pot of honey, which he smashed in order to eat every last drop. Afterward Andriamampandry remarked that the kingdom had become a pot of honey without a lid, implying the first one to come along would be free to reach his hand inside and take all its bounty for himself. He visited Andriantomponimerina at Ambohidratrimo and offered him a zebu kidney (considered unpalatable), which the prince ordered to be prepared as a meal nonetheless, leading the elder to remark, [...] "This man can't even resist the temptation to eat the kidney." [...] He visited Andrianavalonimerina at Ambohitrabiby carrying a lemon and a weaver's stake, which the prince's wife demanded he give to them, demonstrating their greediness. Andriamampandry also visited prince Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana at Ambohimanga, carrying an axe and a rope. The prince asked to borrow the two items, then ordered a servant to use the axe and rope to butcher a zebu, put some of the best meat in a basket, cook the rest of the good meat for their meal, and set aside the neck and the ribbed part of the tripe in a second basket. The elder dined with the prince and spent the night at the village. When Andriamampandry was about to leave, the prince returned the rope and axe, gave him the basket of fine meat for his wife, and gave him the second basket, declaring [...] "These are the parts for the axe (i.e. the neck) and the rope (i.e. the striated omasum)." [...] Andriamampandry was deeply impressed by the hospitality and foresight of the prince. He related these incidents to Andriamasinavalona, who decided to test his sons in turn by calling them together to his house, then observing how they slept on the bed they shared there. Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana had his head highest on the pillow, but Andriamasinavalona failed to understand the significance of this, and Andriamampandry rebuked him, remarking [...] "You are the king, and <b>yet</b> <b>you</b> do not understand?" ...|$|E
