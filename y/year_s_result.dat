Poor sleep {{is a risk}} factor for age-related disease; however, the extent to which sleep accounts for variation in LTL is unknown. Methods. The present study examined associations of self-reported sleep duration, onset latency, and subjective quality with LTL in a community-dwelling sample of 245 healthy women in midlife (aged 49 - 66 <b>years).</b> <b>Result</b> <b>s.</b> While sleep duration and onset latency were unrelated to LTL, women reporting poorer sleep quality displayed shorter LTL (r = 0. 14, P = 0. 03), independent of age, BMI, race, and income (b = 55. 48, SE = 27. 43, P = 0. 04). When analyses were restricted to participants for whom sleep patterns were chronic, poorer sleep quality predicted shorter LTL independent of covariates and perceived psychological stress. Conclusions. This study provides the first evidence that poor sleep quality explains significant variation in LTL, a marker of cellular aging. Copyright © 2011 Aric A. Prather et al...|$|R

Comparisons of lay believers with non-believers confirmed previous observations; believers had a higher propensity for intuitive thinking, lower propensity for rational thinking, and more external locus of control. In contrast, practitioners were equivalent to non-believers in rational thinking and had the highest internal locus of control. This highlights the importance of considering level of involvement with psychic practice in understanding the thinking styles of believers. Results suggested that practitioners may have rationalised their beliefs and constructed a coherent model of psychic phenomena that satisfies a propensity for rational thinking within a community of belief...|$|R

40|$|Objective. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{estimate}} the age at natural menopause in women with SLE. Methods. One thousand and thirty-nine consecutive SLE patients < 60 years of age were surveyed. Demographic and clinical data were queried by a single investigator. SLE characteristics and co-morbidities were retrieved from their medical records. Natural menopause was defined as amenorrhoea ≥ 12 months in the absence of previous hysterectomy, CYC exposure and severe chronic kidney disease (SCKD). Pregnant women and those with menses during the 12 months prior to interview were considered premenopausal. Median age at menopause was estimated by both logit and survival analyses. In addition, mean age at menopause was calculated for patients aged ≥ 40 years. Factors associated with age at natural menopause were assessed by Cox regression analysis. Results. A total of 961 SLE women were analysed. At interview, most patients (81. 6 %) were premenopausal, 7. 9 % had natural menopause, 6. 3 % were postmenopausal previously exposed to CYC, 4. 1 % had undergone hysterectomy before menopause and 0. 1 % presented with SCKD and amenorrhoea. The mean age at interview was 35. 2 <b>years</b> (<b>s.</b> d. 10. 1), the mean age at SLE diagnosis was 26. 9 <b>years</b> (<b>s.</b> d. 8. 6) and the mean duration of disease was 8. 2 <b>years</b> (<b>s.</b> d. 7. 1).

40|$|To {{assess the}} {{variation}} of soil respiration at different forest stages we measured it in a coppiced oak (Quercus cerris L.) chronosequence in central Italy during two campaigns, spanning 2 successive years, in four stands {{at different stages}} of the rotation: 1 <b>year</b> (<b>S</b> 1), 5 <b>years</b> (<b>S</b> 5), 10 <b>years</b> (<b>S</b> 10) and 17 <b>years</b> (<b>S</b> 17) after coppicing. The contribution of the different components of soil respiration flux (aboveground litter, belowground decomposition soil organic matter and root respiration) was estimated by a paired comparison of manipulative experiments between the recently coppiced stand (S 1) and mature stand (S 17). Ninety percent of soil respiration values were between 1. 7 and 7. 8 μmol m− 2 s− 1, with an overall mean (±SD) of 4. 0 ± 2. 7 μmol m− 2 s− 1. Spatial variation of soil respiration was high (CV= 44. 9 %), with a mean range (i. e. patch size) of 4. 8 ± 2. 7 m, as estimated from a semivariance analysis. In the absence of limitation by soil moisture, soil respiration was related to soil temperature with the exponential Q 10 model (average Q 10 = 2. 25). During summer, soil moisture constrained soil respiration and masked its dependence on soil temperature. Soil respiration declined over the years after coppicing. Assuming a linear decline with stand age, we estimated a reduction of 24 % over a 20 -year-rotation cycle. The response of soil respiration to temperature also changed with age of the stands: the Q 10 was estimated to decrease from 2. 90 in S 1 to 2. 42 in S 17, suggesting that different components or processes may be involved at different developmental stages. The contribution of heterotrophic respiration to total soil respiration flux was relatively larger in the young S 1 stand than in the mature S 17 stand...|$|R

Few empirical studies, however, have been completed on effec-tive procedures for its implementation (Jenkins, Speltz, & Odorn, 1985; adorn & McEnvoy, 1988). There is reason to believe that spontane-ous improvement in the social behaviors of chil-dren with disabilities does not occur through administrative placement of these children with normally developing children (Gresham, 1984; Jenkins et al., 1989; Snyder, Apolloni, & Cooke, 1977). Compared with peers without disabilities, children with disabi lities placed in regular pre-schools tend to be more socially rejected by peers, display more social isolation, place more demands on teacher time, are less attentive, and are more often the recipient of negative behaviors from normally developing children (Burstein...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{investigate}} the developmental concept of the process of differentiation as reflected in cognitive style with three and seven year old male and female Ss. The ideas underlying this study stemmed from the Witkin concept of an analytical versus a global cognitive style. The design, however, differed considerably from the studies of Witkin, Dyk, Faterson, Goodenough, and Karp (1962) by incorporating three aspects of psychological functioning which theoretically should be highly related, although they have never been investigated simultaneously. The three aspects of psychological functioning were perceptual articulation as measured by the Preschool Embedded Figures Test and the Children’s Embedded Figures Test, articulation of teh body concept as measured by the Make-a-Person Test, the Draw-a-Person Test, and the Clown Assembly Test, and verbal articulation as measured by the Entwisle (1966 b) 96 stimulus word association list. The 60 Ss (30 at ages 3 and 7, equal sexes in both groups) were assessed on all of these measures, except the Draw-a-Person Test, which was only administered to the 7 <b>year</b> old <b>Ss.</b> The <b>results</b> and discussion dispelled two widely held myths neither of which had ever had much empirical support in the literature. First, there was unequivocally no support for the consistency construct of the analytical versus the global cognitive style across areas of psychological functioning. Second, there was no evidence of female superiority on measures of verbal articulation. The discussion centred on two findings, which were first, the extension of Entwisle’s (1966 b) model of the syntactic-paradigmatic (S-P) shift to an irrelevant-syntactic-paradigmatic (I-S-P) shift with emphasis on the qualitative aspect of the responses, and second, an improvement in scoring the embedded figures test.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The sample comprised 94 patients of both genders, presenting Class I malocclusion, treated with extractions of the four first premolars and Edgewise mechanics. All the patients selected were whites, being 50 males and 44 females. The mean pretreatment age was 13. 46 <b>years</b> (<b>s.</b> d. 1. 8). The mean treatment time was 2. 09 <b>years</b> (<b>s.</b> d. 0. 58), the mean retention time was 1. 63 <b>years</b> (<b>s.</b> d. 0. 73) and the mean time of postretention evaluation was 5. 31 <b>years</b> (<b>s.</b> d. 1. 61). The dental casts were measured at pretreatment (T 1), posttreatment (T 2) and postretention (T 3), by the PAR index and by the Little irregularity index, and the correction due to treatment (T 1 - 2) and the change at the postretention period (T 3 - 2) were calculated. The descriptive statistics was performed and the Pearson correlation coefficient was applied for the PAR and the Little indices in the total sample, among the times evaluated. RESULTS: The mean PAR reduction due to treatment was 78. 54 %, and 66. 6 %, at the postretention stage related to pretreatment stage. Significant correlations were found for the PAR index at the times evaluated, except between T 1 and T 2 and between T 1 - 2 and T 3. In other words, the higher the treatment correction (T 1 - 2), the lower the posttreatment PAR index (PAR T 2) will be, and the higher will be the PAR change at the postretention period (PAR T 3 - 2). Also, the higher the posttreatment PAR score (PAR T 2), the higher will be the postretention PAR score (PAR T 3).
