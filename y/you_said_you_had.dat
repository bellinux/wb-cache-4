2500|$|You {{were asked}} before the invasion, {{or after the}} invasion, of Iraq if you'd checked with your dad. And I believe, I don't {{remember}} the quote exactly, but I believe <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> checked with a higher authority. I {{would like to ask}} you, what part does your faith play on your policy decisions? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Barnes {{scratched}} their names," [...] cries Ethel, [...] "out of the list, mamma. You {{know you}} did, Barnes; <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> gallipots enough." ...|$|E
6000|$|It was Tommy {{who dropped}} her hand first. [...] "Mother," [...] he cried, [...] "your face is wet, you're {{greeting}} sair, and <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> forgot the way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are not to}} {{be tempted}} by a Grand Marshalship!" [...] said Mr. Sievers. [...] "You hardly expected, when you were at Turriparva, to witness such a rapid {{termination}} of the patriotism of our good friend. I think <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> seen him since your arrival: the interview must have been piquant!" ...|$|R
60|$|MRS. ARBUTHNOT. You must remember, as <b>you</b> <b>said</b> yourself, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> had so few advantages.|$|R
60|$|CZAR. Sweet, you {{are safe}} here. Nothing can harm you here. O love, I knew <b>you</b> trusted me! <b>You</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> would <b>have</b> trust.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am greatly {{obliged to}} you, sir. I don't think I need detain you any longer. <b>You</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> an {{engagement}} later on; won't you keep this cab?" ...|$|E
6000|$|And that is {{all that}} I can {{recollect}} of it--but it is very clever all the way through. But I think, my dear, <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> got it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "At Cedar Lodge. It's {{several miles}} from here," [...] {{answered}} Jack. And then he continued: [...] "You belong around here? I thought <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> a farm near Enwood." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{more than}} ever amazed!" [...] cried Ethel. [...] "I thought you detested it. I thought papa never wished it for <b>you.</b> He <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> not nerve." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Upon my word,' said Gertrude, 'I am very {{indifferent}} about it. But {{would it}} not be better if <b>you</b> <b>said</b> what <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to say to my husband?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Burnt down, Dias! I {{am sorry}} indeed to hear that. How did it happen? I thought <b>you</b> <b>said</b> that <b>you</b> <b>had</b> locked it up, and left no one there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I thought I {{was safe}} here--safe {{from the whole}} world," [...] muttered Lester Lawrence. [...] "But <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> good news for me," [...] he added quickly. [...] "What is it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, get to business, then," [...] went on {{the lumber}} merchant. [...] "I {{am not going to}} stay here all day. <b>You</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> {{something}} to say that would interest me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{words are}} these, Tripp?" [...] said I. [...] "I thought <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> a story. Every {{ferryboat}} that crosses the East River brings or takes away girls from Long Island." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When I {{told you}} that Mr. Glover was at our house <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> should <b>have</b> thought—" [...] She turned and {{regarded}} him with an expression in her eyes which he {{tried in vain to}} decipher.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Tis not the truth. I am {{not to be}} put {{off with}} such an answer. Yourself <b>you</b> <b>said</b> that <b>you</b> <b>had</b> warned him not to cross your path. What path was in your mind?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; I saw the carts full {{of bricks}} go by," [...] said the squire, querulously. [...] "I didn't {{know there was}} to be any brickwork. <b>You</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> would <b>have</b> it made of deal slabs with oak posts." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And when I {{counted on}} you so, for my tea and {{dinner at the}} club!" [...] {{continued}} Mrs. Dallam. [...] "There were other women dying to come. And <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> a headache, and were tired." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, James Hardy," [...] replied his sister. [...] "I thought <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> heard. He's {{coming back}} to Sunwich and going into {{partnership}} with old Swann, the shipbroker. A very good thing for him, I should think." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm not in {{the humor}} to wait. I've waited too long already." [...] The captain paused and cleared his throat. [...] "I believe <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> the {{original}} title papers to the ranch, didn't you?" [...] he went on.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{gathered}} from what <b>you</b> <b>said</b> that <b>you</b> <b>had</b> bought the Castle. Isn't that so? If it still belongs to Lord Dreever, don't {{you think you}} ought to consult him before revising his list of guests?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Joseph was in {{the room}} when <b>you</b> <b>said</b> that <b>you</b> <b>had</b> burnt it," [...] she exclaimed. [...] "You can’t {{contradict}} yourself like that before him. Besides, I’m sure he has {{had nothing to do with}} it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{you will}} {{forgive me if}} it hurts <b>you.</b> They <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> only married him for his money, and he was no more to you {{than one of the}} teamsters. There was a little more I couldn't mention." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> met her, but you didn't tell me all. Your {{story was}} that you had met as estranged people, who were not husband and wife at all in Heaven's sight--not that you had made it up with her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well! If {{it should}} unhappily appear,' he said, 'after due pains and duty on my part, that I am {{brought to a}} {{position}} so desolate as this banishment, I shall not become the lady's persecutor. But <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> no commission from her?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{never get}} to speak to you, said Val. 'I did think I would that first time, and ask you what to do, but then you came in late, and when I began something, <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> your Greek to do, {{and told me to}} hold my tongue.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] {{said the}} doctor, {{in a tone}} of frank relief. [...] "Here you are! I was getting worried about <b>you.</b> Waya <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> been gone since morning!" [...] He stopped and looked at her attentively. [...] "Is {{anything}} the matter?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Forgive us," [...] said Jessie, hastening to explain; [...] "it is not that. If <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> {{taken to}} reading the Bible {{carefully}} and systematically, {{we would not}} have been surprised, but it--it was--your talking so quietly about theology that made us--" ...|$|R
60|$|MAGISTRATE. [Rapping his desk.] Now <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> all <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to say, and {{you will}} be quiet.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, but <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> a {{headache}} {{the beginning of}} the evening, and you really look pale; you certainly need it as a medicine," [...] said Fanny. [...] "I'll leave it to mamma;" [...] and she turned to Mrs. G., who stood gayly entertaining a group of young people.|$|E
6000|$|The girl showed faint {{signs of}} temper. [...] "You {{have told me}} that before. Why don't you do something? <b>You</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> lived in the Bush, and now you have only been a few hours in it. It was seven o'clock when we had breakfast. Can't you even make a fire?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{that day}} at Chiricahua you spoke of faith," [...] he burst out. [...] "You said the {{greatest}} {{thing in the world}} was faith in human nature. You said the finest men had been those who had fallen low and had risen. <b>You</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> faith in me! You made me have faith in myself!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Please, mamma, do tell us {{all about}} it,' said the girl. 'You know I stopped {{directly}} when you made me a sign not to go on asking questions before the little ones. And <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> should <b>have</b> to make us your friends while papa and the grown-ups are away.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Twould <b>have</b> {{been better}} <b>had</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> wished <b>you</b> <b>had</b> never {{attempted}} {{to do what it}} little becomes any white man's gifts to undertake; in which case, not only might we have kept from coming to blows, but Thomas Hutter would now have been living, and the hearts of the savages would be less given to vengeance. The death of that young woman, too, was on-called for, Henry March, and leaves a heavy load on our names if not on our consciences!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{started when}} <b>you</b> <b>said</b> that <b>you</b> <b>had</b> burnt it," [...] persisted Miss Drewitt, unwilling {{to give up}} a theory so much to her liking. [...] "You mark my words if his father and Mr. Chalk and that Mr. Stobell don’t go away for a holiday soon. Good-night." ...|$|R
