25|$|The <b>yellowfin</b> whiting, <b>Sillago</b> schomburgkii, (also {{known as}} the western sand whiting and fine-scaled whiting) is a species of inshore marine fish in the smelt-whiting family Sillaginidae. The species is endemic to the eastern Indian Ocean, ranging from Dampier, Western Australia to Gulf St Vincent in South Australia, with an {{apparent}} division in the populations of the two states. Yellowfin whiting inhabit relatively shallow waters for their entire life, often found on tidal flats and creeks, as well as large estuaries. It {{is one of the}} largest members of the smelt-whiting family, growing to 42cm, and can be distinguished by a number of anatomical and colour related features. Yellowfin whiting are benthic carnivores, preying predominantly on polychaete worms, with minor amounts of copepods, amphipods and bivalves also commonly taken. The species shows a change in diet with age, and also dietary differences with other sillaginids presumably to minimize competition. Reproduction occurs at different times throughout its range, generally focused around summer, with up to 217,000 eggs produced per season. Yellowfin whiting reach sexual maturity at around 20cm, with each individual spawning more than once. The species forms the basis of major fisheries in both Shark Bay, Western Australia and the two Gulfs of South Australia, with around 260 tonnes of fish taken each year. They are also a popular target for shore based anglers, with a reputation as a very good table fish.|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} {{of organic matter}} produced in seagrass meadows (seagrass and epiphytic algae) to the nutrition of a valuable fisheries species (<b>yellowfin</b> whiting <b>Sillago</b> schomburgkii Peters) occurring over unvegetated mudflats was measured using the isotopic composition (d 13 C, d 15 N) of fish, their polychaete prey, and available autotrophic sources at several locations in southern Australia during 2 periods (summer, winter). Values for d 13 C and d 15 N for autotrophs and fishes varied little between seasons. Sources could be separated into 3 groups based on d 13 C: seagrass and epiphytes (mean d 13 C = - 10. 5 马 benthic microalgae and macroalgae (- 19. 5 马 and saltmarsh and mangroves (- 26. 5 驮 Values of d 15 N for the sources were 2 to 5 鮠Values of d 13 C for fish (- 13. 3 驠corresponded with those of their polychaete prey (- 12. 5 驠and ultimately with those of seagrass and epiphytes. Values of d 15 N were 5 to 6 頭ore enriched than sources. Modelling of feasible source mixtures showed that seagrass and epiphytes {{were the most important}} contributors to the nutrition of fish, but their relative importance varied between seasons. The median contribution by other sources was < 10 %. Spatial analyses showed that saltmarsh plants contributed significantly to the variability in S. schomburgkii nutrition among locations, while macroalgae contributed in summer. The similarity in d 13 C values of polychaetes and S. schomburgkii is consistent with source material from a subtidal habitat being incorporated into food webs supporting a fisheries species in adjacent intertidal habitats via a largely sedentary intermediary.
