2500|$|Jonathan Takiff from The Philadelphia Inquirer {{praised the}} album for being [...] "serious and reflective, at times heavily laden with psychic trauma. <b>You</b> <b>might</b> <b>consider</b> Like a Prayer to be 's Misfits...or her {{hour in the}} confessional box". Sal Cinquemani, from Slant Magazine, {{described}} the album as [...] "a collection of pop confections layered with live instrumentation, sophisticated arrangements, deeply felt lyrics, and a stronger, more assured vocal." [...] The review concluded by declaring Like a Prayer [...] "one of the quintessential pop albums of all time. Barry Walters from the San Francisco Examiner, named the album [...] "'s best and most consistent collection yet [...] the album [...] crosses the line between craft and inspiration. From the start, she's had an intuitive grasp of how {{to put on a}} good show. Now she's got the guts to show us what's inside". Senior editor from The Cavalier Daily Chaz Repak, praised Madonna's [...] "improved" [...] songwriting; [...] "her religious faith and her marriage to Sean Penn, are completely well written", however, he ended his review on a more critical note by saying: [...] "Like a Prayer constitutes Madonna's best work to date. But after such work as [...] "Material Girl", [...] "Burning Up" [...] and [...] "Open Your Heart", that's not saying much." [...] Negative criticism came from [...] Spin magazine. Reviewer Christian Logan wrote: [...] "On Like a Prayer your relationship to Madonna changes from to song to song, and it makes you uncomfortable. It's like sitting on a table with a friend who's telling too much about herself to people she doesn't know". Joe Levy, from the same magazine, was also critical, writing that [...] "there's not a lot of old Madonna, nothing of the generation of women who grew up in her wake: Regina, Debbie Gibson, and Taylor Dayne", but highlighted [...] "Keep It Together" [...] as [...] "the only great dance song on the record". At the end of 1989, Like a Prayer was voted the 18th best record {{of the year in the}} Pazz & Jop, an annual poll of American critics published by The Village Voice.|$|E
