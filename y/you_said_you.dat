5|$|The Buccaneers, {{making their}} NFL debut against the Houston Oilers, {{averaged}} {{less than two}} yards per offensive play. They were unable to score despite being given good field position by two Oiler fumbles. Steve Spurrier completed 8 of 21 passes for 36 yards, and starting running backs Jimmy DuBose and Louis Carter rushed for 12 yards on 15 carries. Despite being outgained 169 to 8 by the second quarter, they were only behind 7–0 and missed a chance to tie the score when Lee McGriff dropped a Spurrier pass in the end zone. A later drive ended when Spurrier overthrew John McKay, Jr., instead hitting defender C.L. Whittington. A third chance to tie the score was lost when Mark Cotney dropped an interception of a Dan Pastorini pass with a clear path to the end zone. Whittington gave the Buccaneers {{the ball on the}} Oiler 11-yard line by fumbling a punt, but then killed the Buccaneers’ scoring chances by intercepting another Spurrier pass. Ronnie Coleman ran 25 times for 142 yards for the Oilers. McKay expressed concern over the team’s offense after the defeat, and responded to a reporter’s taunt of “I thought <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> were going to win some games?” by saying, “Houston has been in the league 6,000 years and still hasn’t won a championship. The Bucs will be heard from”. It was a day with a bad beginning, middle, and ending for the Buccaneers. The day began with the Buccaneers getting lost in the maze-like Astrodome interior, and ended with the team’s charter plane bouncing and rolling before righting itself on landing. In addition, starting tackle Dave Reavis was injured during pregame warmups and was lost for the season.|$|E
500|$|There is {{a slight}} {{difference}} in lyrics between the version used in [...] version and the one released on Shades of Purple. The Shades of Purple version includes the line [...] "then you start kissing me, what's that about?" [...] In the Pokémon version, the lyric is [...] "then <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> love me, what's that about?" [...] When asked about the lyric change in an interview, M2M replied [...] "the Pokémon people didn't find it appropriate to have kissing in the lyrics, because it was for younger kids. We think [...] was stupid. The original version is on , and that's the one {{we wanted to go}} with." [...] M2M had not heard of Pokémon until the song was chosen for the soundtrack, as the franchise was not yet popular in Norway.|$|E
500|$|... "Don't Say You Love Me" [...] was {{released}} in October 1999 as the lead song from the [...] soundtrack. There was a minor lyric change between the versions, as the original version contained the lyrics [...] "then you start kissing me", which was deemed inappropriate for Pokémon's young viewers and was changed to [...] "then <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> love me". The original version was retained on Shades of Purple. Promoted by a [...] "nonstop marketing effort", advanced airing on Radio Disney and the affiliation with Pokémon, the single was successful. It charted at No. 2 in Norway, No. 4 in both Australia and New Zealand, No. 16 in the UK and No. 21 on the Billboard Hot 100. It was certified gold in both Australia and the US, and was nominated for the year's best song at the 2000 Spellemannprisen awards.|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, {{the female}} protagonists {{challenge}} their male [...] "suitors" [...] {{to keep up}} instead of being full of empty promises; the women further feel that [...] "He's not fulfilling you like he says". Williams further explained {{the meaning of the}} song during an interview with MTV News, [...] "We've had experiences with men doing a lot of talking but they can’t back it up. <b>You</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> could do this, but you can't, whether that's on the dance floor or wherever else. He said what he could do for you, but..." [...] The lyrics are constructed in the chorus-verse pattern. The song opens with the lines [...] "Hit me" [...] and the first verses sung by Beyoncé follow: [...] "I put it right there made it easy for you to get to / Now you want to act like you don't know what to do". The chorus follows during which the group repeatedly sings the lines [...] "Can you keep up?". Rowland's second verses follow where she sings the lines [...] "Put it on me deep in the right direction". The chorus is repeated twice before the bridge by Williams. After the bridge, the group sings the lines [...] "Here's your papers, baby you are dismissed" [...] letting their man know that he is not good enough for them. Rowland sings a short ad lib, and then the trio ends with a repeated chorus. Nick Reynolds from BBC compared the song Missy Elliott's [...] "Pass That Dutch" [...] and to songs by The Supremes. He further found a name check of Public Enemy's [...] "Bring the Noise". Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine also compared [...] "Lose My Breath with [...] "Pass That Dutch".|$|E

[...] "Tonight" [...] has an instrumentation of a disco bass, and the drumbeat and bass of the song [...] "makes the song the most authentically danceable on the album," [...] according to Popmatters. [...] "I Wonder" [...] has a [...] "chopped and screwed beat and dancing piano lines" [...] that [...] "is club pop for the PBR set," [...] according to Paste Magazine. Lyrically, the song deals with getting older and [...] "staying put". [...] "Much Too Late" [...] is [...] "a rant that seems {{to come out of}} nowhere and doesn't fit in with anything else on this record," [...] as described by PopMatters. [...] "Ten Dollars I Found" [...] is the last track of the album, and was described by Popmatters as the only real ballad from the album.|$|E
