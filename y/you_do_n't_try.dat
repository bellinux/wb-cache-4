60|$|He was {{probably}} most {{at odds with}} me in regard to my theories of fiction, though he persisted in declaring his pleasure in my own fiction. He was in fact, by nature and tradition, thoroughly romantic, {{and he could not}} or would not suffer realism in any but a friend. He steadfastly refused even to read the Russian masters, to his immense loss, as I tried to persuade him, and even among the modern Spaniards, for whom he might have had a sort of personal kindness from his love of Cervantes, he chose one for his praise the least worthy, of it, and bore me down with his heavier metal in argument when I opposed to Alarcon's factitiousness the delightful genuineness of Valdes. Ibsen, with all the Norwegians, he put far from him; he would no more know them than the Russians; the French naturalists he abhorred. I thought him all wrong, but <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>try</b> improving your elders when they have come to three score and ten years, and I would rather have had his affection unbroken by our difference of opinion than a perfect agreement. Where he even imagined that this difference could work me harm, he was anxious to have me know that he meant me none; and he was at the trouble to write me a letter when a Boston paper had perverted its report of what he said in a public lecture to my disadvantage, and to assure me that he had not me in mind. When once he had given his liking, he could not bear that any shadow of change should seem to have come upon him. He had a most beautiful and endearing ideal of friendship; he desired to affirm it and to reaffirm it as often as occasion offered, and if occasion <b>did</b> <b>not</b> offer, he made occasion. It <b>did</b> <b>not</b> matter what <b>you</b> said or <b>did</b> that contraried him; if he thought he had essentially divined you, you were still the same: and on his part he was by no means exacting of equal demonstration, but seemed not even to wish it.|$|R

He explained, [...] "You can't readily observe the tyranny within yourself if <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> consciously <b>try</b> to examine or observe it. Some may think they can accept equal rights for people of various gender persuasions but may, deep down, be homophobic due to the deeply ingrained culture and popular discourse inculcating hatred or at least dislike towards gays, transsexuals, and lesbians. Some may think they are for democracy, but may have a hard time acting democratically when it comes to domestic relations, because inside they believe in some form of social hierarchy. Some may think they are for free speech and against censorship, but can hardly bear any hate speech or unfounded criticisms and accusation against them because they have little tolerance for differing views and in themselves believe in feeding others only the 'right' information." ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this chapter}} we learn {{a few basic}} {{algorithms}} on trees, and how to construct trees {{in the first place}} so that we can run these (and other) algorithms. The good news is that these algorithms have many applications, {{the bad news is that}} this chapter is a bit on the simple side. But maybe that’s not really bad news?! 3. 1 Broadcast Definition 3. 1 (Broadcast). A broadcast operation is initiated by a single processor, the source. The source wants to send a message to all other nodes in the system. Definition 3. 2 (Distance, Radius, Diameter). The distance between two nodes u and v in an undirected graph G is the number of hops of a minimum path between u and v. The radius of a node u is the maximum distance between u and any other node in the graph. The radius of a graph is the minimum radius of any node in the graph. The diameter of a graph is the maximum distance between two arbitrary nodes. Remarks: • Clearly there is a close relation between the radius R and the diameter D of a graph, such as R ≤ D ≤ 2 R. • The world is often fascinated by graphs with a small radius. For example, movie fanatics study the who-acted-with-whom-in-the-same-movie graph. For this graph it has long been believed that the actor Kevin Bacon has a particularly small radius. The number of hops from Bacon even got a name, the Bacon Number. In the meantime, however, it has been shown that there are “better ” centers in the Hollywood universe, such as Sean Connery, Christopher Lee, Rod Steiger, Gene Hackman, or Michael Caine. The center of other social networks has also been explored, Paul Erdös for instance is well known in the math community. Theorem 3. 3 (Broadcast Lower Bound). The message complexity of broadcast is at least n − 1. The source’s radius is a lower bound for the time complexity. • You can use a pre-computed spanning tree to do broadcast with tight message complexity. If the spanning tree is a breadth-first search spanning tree (for a given source), then the time complexity is tight as well. Definition 3. 4 (Clean). A graph (network) is clean if the nodes <b>do</b> <b>not</b> know the topology of the graph. Theorem 3. 5 (Clean Broadcast Lower Bound). For a clean network, the number of edges is a lower bound for the broadcast message complexity. Proof: If <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>try</b> every edge, <b>you</b> might miss a whole part of the graph behind it...|$|R

40|$|Misstatement {{of income}} on {{mortgage}} loan applications (the “liar-loan ” problem) {{is thought to}} have been a contributor to the boom and bust of mortgage markets. We provide nationwide measurements that reflect the degree to which incomes on mid- 2000 home-purchase mortgage loan applications were overstated relative to the actual incomes of mortgage applicants. Our results suggest a substantial degree of income overstatement in 2005 and 2006, one consistent with the average mortgage application overstating income by almost 20 percent. We find the tendency to misstate income was influenced by securitization markets. We find limited evidence that income overstatement played a role in subsequent mortgage defaults. *Helpful comments were provided by seminar participants at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.

They ask us for bread, but we give them stones. It is an insult to a starving people to offer them religion; it is an insult to a starving man to teach him metaphysics. In India a priest that preached for money would lose caste and be spat upon by the people. I came here to seek aid for my impoverished people, and I fully realised how difficult it was to get help for heathens from Christians in a Christian land.|$|R

His career was one of unparalleled production, punctuated by revolutions, voyages, exiles, and other intervals of repose. The tales he tells of his prowess in 1830, and with Garibaldi, seem credible to me, and are borne out, so far, by the narrative of M. Maxime Ducamp, who met him at Naples, in the Garibaldian camp. Like Mr. Jingle, in [...] "Pickwick," [...] he [...] "banged the field-piece, twanged the lyre," [...] and was potting at the foes of the republic with a double-barrelled gun, when he was not composing plays, romances, memoirs, criticisms. He has told the tale of his adventures with the Comedie Francaise, where the actors laughed at his Antony, and where Madame Mars and he quarrelled and made it up again. His plays often won an extravagant success; his novels--his great novels, that is--made all Europe his friend. He gained large sums of money, which flowed out of his fingers, though it is said by some that his Abbotsford, Monte Cristo, was no more a palace than the villa which a retired tradesman builds to shelter his old age. But the money disappeared as fast as if Monte Cristo had really been palatial, and worthy of the fantasy of a Nero. He got into debt, fled to Belgium, returned, founded the Mousquetaire, a literary paper of the strangest and most shiftless kind. In [...] "Alexandre Dumas a la Maison d'Or," [...] M. Philibert Audebrand tells the tale of this Micawber of newspapers. Everything went into it, good or bad, and the name of Dumas was expected to make all current coin. For Dumas, unluckily, was as prodigal of his name as of his gold, and no reputation could bear the drafts he made on his celebrity. His son says, in the preface to Le Fils Naturel: [...] "Tragedy, dramas, history, romance, comedy, travel, you cast all of them in the furnace and the mould of your brain, and you peopled the world of fiction with new creations. The newspaper, the book, the theatre, burst asunder, too narrow for your puissant shoulders; you fed France, Europe, America with your works; you made the wealth of publishers, translators, plagiarists; printers and copyists toiled after you in vain. In the fever of production <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> always <b>try</b> and prove the metal which you employed, and sometimes you tossed into the furnace whatever came to your hand. The fire made the selection: what was your own is bronze, what was not yours vanished in smoke." ...|$|R
