40|$|<b>Yarn</b> <b>construction</b> is an {{important}} attribute in knitting and end use performance of knitwear. Holistically, <b>yarn</b> <b>construction</b> affects fabric thickness and weight, and thereby influences ultraviolet (UV) protection of fabrics. Although impact of <b>yarn</b> <b>construction</b> on UV protection of fabrics is apparent, {{there appears to be}} limited research on it. This paper studied the UV protection of plain-knitted fabrics made of three types of ring-spun cotton yarns varying in yarn twist level and staple length. The results show that these yarn properties affect UV protection of fabrics differently before and after laundering. The modified low-twisted yarn possesses a bulky feature which creates a porous fabric structure for more ultraviolet radiation (UVR) transmission. The extra-long staple yarn offers uniform fabric appearance for higher UVR reflection. However, the regularity of yarn also restricts the fabric shrinkage in laundering and thus improvement in UV protection by shrinkage is not as obvious as that provided by the conventional short-staple yarn.

40|$|This {{publication}} discusses structural {{characteristics to}} consider when selecting carpet, including fiber and <b>yarn</b> <b>construction.</b> The Fibers Both natural and manufactured fibers are used in carpeting. Naturals include wool and silk. Cotton tends to crush and soil easily {{so it is not}} used for carpeting. Manufactured fibers used in carpeting include nylon, polypropylene/olefin, and polyester. As with all commodities, carpet fiber use changes. Times, availability and cost {{have an impact on the}} market. Ninety-nine percent of today 2 ̆ 7 s carpet fibers are manufactured. About 68 percent of the carpet market is nylon, 22 percent polypropylene/olefin, over 9 percent polyester, and one percent wool. Fiber performance in a carpet depends on the construction of both yarn and carpet...|$|E
30|$|The barrier {{properties}} of a textile mainly {{depend on the}} fabric structure, the <b>yarn</b> <b>construction,</b> and the physical and chemical structure of the char resulting from a fire. The chemical and physical structure of the char determines the resistance to char oxidation. The fabric structure also determines the degree of air entrapment in the char. It is the char that often serves as the actual barrier between flames and the vulnerable contents of a soft furnishing product. Such chars are prone to oxidation during flame exposure, which effectively erodes the barrier, giving it a finite period of protection. This protection period depends {{on the nature of}} the organic fiber, minor contaminants in the fiber, the char mass per unit area and the temperature at which the char is exposed ([Horrocks 1996]).|$|E
25|$|Carpet can be {{formulated}} {{from many}} single or blended natural and synthetic fibres. Fibres are chosen for durability, appearance, ease of manufacture, and cost. In terms of scale of production, the dominant <b>yarn</b> <b>constructions</b> are polyamides (nylons) and polypropylene {{with an estimated}} 90% of the commercial market.|$|R
50|$|Braided area rugs can be {{constructed}} {{in a variety of}} different ways including a banded braid construction, cloth braid construction, flat braid <b>construction</b> and <b>yarn</b> braid <b>construction.</b> Banded braid constructions have wide bands of either solid colored or variegated braids made from predetermined patterns to offer an appealing, thick look. A cloth braid construction is indicative of a time when outgrown clothing was cut into strips and then hand braided into a floor covering. This particular construction is unique to one manufacturer, Thorndike Mills. A flat braid construction is a common construction as it's one of the easier and more classic methods. Simply intertwine three ropes of fabric and/or yarn, and you'll have yourself a braided rug. A <b>yarn</b> braid <b>construction</b> evolves from <b>yarn</b> in its initial state to a uniquely finished area rug.|$|R
40|$|A {{modified}} {{process for}} the dry spinning of carbon nanotube (CNT) yarn is reported. The approach gives an improved structure of CNT bundles in the web drawn from the CNT forest and in the yarn produced from the twisted web leading to improved mechanical properties of the yarn. The process enables many different mechanical and physical treatments {{to be applied to}} the individual stages of the pure CNT spinning system, and may allow potential for the development of complex spinning processes such as polymer–CNT-based composite yarns. The tensile strength and yarn/web structure of yarn spun using this approach have been investigated and evaluated using standard tensile testing methods along with scanning electron microscopy. The experimental results show that the tensile properties were significantly improved. The effect of heat treatments and other <b>yarn</b> <b>constructions</b> on the tensile properties are also reported...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Yarn {{hairiness}} is one {{of important}} yarn parameters, which is used for yarn production quality control. It is usually characterized {{by the amount of}} free fibers (fibre loops, fibre ends) protruding from the compact yarn body towards the outer yarn surface. The first question can be if hairiness is really important and why? The reason is obtaining deeper information about yarn structure and its changes during processing. Thanks to detailed knowledge it is possible predict to yarn behaviour and design fabric and textile products precisely in the way the customers demand. Yarn hairiness and its determining is important because it influences the post spinning operation and parameters of textile product (porosity, permeability, transport of moisture, comfort, aesthetic properties and hand). The main factors influencing hairiness are: type of fibres, yarn twist, yarn count, blending ratio, yarn technology production, approach to yarn hairiness observation and measurement condition. This paper concentrates on the influence of <b>yarn</b> <b>construction</b> parameter (yarn count, yarn twist) and technology of production (ring comb and carded, experimental and open end). In this case, the Uster Tester 4 and the new optical approach for yarn hairiness investigation is applied. Results for experimental sets of yarn will be shown...|$|E
40|$|The {{aerodynamic}} {{properties of}} 15 knitted fabrics of varying cover factor, yarn, and fiber compositions were investigated for their aerodynamic properties on circular cylinders in a wind tunnel. Measurements of the drag force, pressure distribution, and the Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) technique {{were used in}} order to obtain {{a better understanding of the}} effects of yarn, fiber composition, cover factor, and elastic deformation on the flow field and drag coefficient. It was clearly demonstrated from the drag force measurements that the <b>yarn</b> <b>construction</b> and fiber composition have a substantial effect on the drag coefficient (CD), with fabrics composed of spun yarn experiencing no CD-drop as opposed to those composed of filament yarn, and being almost unaffected by the cover factor in the range of Reynolds numbers investigated. Hairiness of the spun yarn was found to minimise the drag-reducing effect of the boundary layer transition and increase the trans-critical drag. The hairy surface layer also appeared to retard the turbulent boundary layer as almost no pressure recovery was observed prior to separation on the cylinder model. The effect of elastic deformation was investigated by image analysis of scanned textile samples, and demonstrated that surface roughness might not be directly correlated to cover factor when the fabrics are stretched. Different elastic behavior of fabrics with different cover factors was also found to affect the structure of the knit surface and thus their aerodynamic behavior. The onset of drag crisis found in drag measurements confirmed the deviation from a sequence determined solely by cover factor...|$|E
40|$|The {{archaeological site}} of Spiro, {{which is located}} in eastern Oklahoma, was a major civic-ceremonial center of the Mississippian {{cultural}} period from approximately A. D. 900 to 1400. These prehistoric peoples developed an extensive trade network, a highly developed religious center, and a political system which controlled the region. An exceptionally rich assemblage of artifacts has been recovered from the mounds at Spiro, and Craig Mound has produced the most extensive collection of preserved prehistoric textiles in the southeastern United States (Brown 1976, King 2 ̆ 6 Gardner 1981, Kuttruff 1988). METHODS: A purposeful sample of 71 Spiro textile specimens from burial context in Craig Mound was selected from the collections of the National Museum of Natural History, the Oklahoma Museum of Natural History, and the University of Arkansas Museum. The primary criteria for {{the selection of the}} sample were maximum variation in textile attributes, observable interworking of elements, and a minimum size of two square centimeters. These textiles were subjected to a systematic study of attribute complexes which included fabric structure, patterning, design, coloration, <b>yarn</b> <b>construction,</b> and fibers. An ordinal scale index of production complexity was developed by the author and used to evaluate the number of decisions and the amount of labor involved in the manufacture of the individual textiles. RESULTS: The research reveals textiles from Spiro that are unique in structure and design among reported Mississippian period textiles. Nearly all of the textile fabrication techniques employed could have been produced by finger manipulation and would not require the use of a loom with means of providing both warp tensioning and shedding. There were 116 fabric structures identified in the 71 specimens, and the number of structural variations per textile specimen ranged from 1 to 4. Interworking was done with both 1 and 2 sets of elements and included examples of twining, interlacing, knotting, and wrapping...|$|E

40|$|It {{is known}} that in 1532 the Shroud was being kept inside a silver reliquary in a chapel in Chambéry, France. A severe fire {{broke out in the}} building; the intense heat melted a corner of the casket and {{scorched}} the folded linen within it, producing the now familiar pattern of burns and markings. In 1534, patches were applied to repair the Shroud and a backing of buckram [Holland cloth] was added to strengthen it. Contaminants in the Shroud Close examination has shown that the Shroud has various kinds of contaminants that include organically based chemical compounds that contain carbon; for example, microscopical fungi, insect debris and pollens. These are not only on the surface but also embedded into the fabric and yarn structures. There are also likely to be deposits of smoke from the fire, and hydrocarbons from the vapours of candles, all of which contain carbon compounds. Furthermore, the carbon dating specimens were taken from a corner, close against a join close to the side strip in an area that would probably have been held during displays by hands that were possibly soiled with perspiration and greases. This same corner shows evidence of water staining probably associated with the water used to douse the fire. There are also several stains throughout the Shroud that have evidently soaked through the folded layers that bear tide marks, perhaps from the soiling and rust of an iron water-bucket. Because of the fire and the melting of the metal casket, the heat inside must have been intense, probably reaching a temperature in the region of 900 °C. (the temperature of molten silver). In these circumstances, natural moisture in the Shroud would turn into steam in places at superheat. This would be trapped in the folds of the Shroud. Any contaminants on, or embedded in, the fabric structure would be dissolved by this steam and forced into the weave and <b>yarn</b> <b>construction,</b> and would react chemically with the molecular structure of the fibres of the flax. Problems encountered with the cleansing of the specimens prior to carbon dating Contaminants {{on the surface of the}} cloth, within the interlacements of the weave, on the surfaces of the yarns, and eve...|$|E

40|$|A {{greater sense}} of {{objectivity}} for {{the reconstruction of the}} cloth drape as derived from the VP 8 analysis of the frontal image of the Shroud might be possible if the draping properties of the linen could be measured directly. To carry out appropriate draping tests, however, and any other textile performance tests upon the Shroud itself would necessitate cutting quite large samples, and its significant mutilation, in a way which would be unacceptable. In these circumstances the next best thing would be to carry out textile performance tests upon an accurate replica of the Shroud linen, then link and compare the results obtained with the nondestructive tests that have been made upon the Shroud itself. Shroud Replica An accurate replica of the Shroud linen was in fact produced by the Shirley Institute, Didsbury, Manchester, for the BBC's QED programme on the Shroud as televised in November 1982.

40|$|Increased {{incidence}} of skin cancers worldwide has expedited {{the development and}} research of ultraviolet (UV) -protective clothing. Clothing acting as a second skin for human beings provides a more durable protection against harmful UV radiation than sunscreen creams. The market value of UV-protective clothing is worth considering. This paper will provide important information to textile designers, manufacturers, and consumers about the production and selection of UV-protective knitwear. Although various factors that affect UV protection of fabrics have been studied by researchers, most of them focused on woven fabrics and chemical approaches for improving UV protection. Knitwear {{in the form of}} daily wear is an indispensable form of clothing in summer but there has been limited research concerning the UV-protective properties of weft-knitted fabrics to date, in particular the influence of fabric construction on UV protection factor (UPF) and fabric structural properties. This issue of Textile Progress reviews the major factors that affect UV protection by fabrics, including fibre types, <b>yarn</b> characteristics, fabric <b>construction,</b> colouration, chemical additives, wetness (rather than just the moisture absorbed into the fibres), the stretching that may occur in clothing, and the effects of laundering. Methods for evaluating the UV-protective ability of fabrics are also addressed.

Although various fabric parameters that affect the ultraviolet radiation (UVR) transmission were studied by researchers, most of them focused on woven fabrics and chemical approaches for enhancing UV protection. Knitwear is an indispensable clothing in summer but there were few studies concerning knitted fabrics, in particular the influence of fabric constructions on ultraviolet protection factor (UPF) and structural properties. This thesis aimed at studying the UV protective property of knitted fabrics at a fundamental level by investigating the influence of different knit structures upon UPF with the three main knit stitches incorporated in the cotton knitted fabric constructions, namely, knit, tuck and miss stitches. The impacts of <b>yarn</b> characteristics, fabric <b>constructions,</b> coloration, end-use conditions including stretching, wetting and laundering, on UV protection were comprehensively studied. A metallic biaxial stretching equipment was specially developed {{for the evaluation of}} UV protection of fabrics in stretched condition. The results showed that fabrics with different knit structures have distinct performances in UV protection. A fabric with miss stitches offered remarkable UV protection whereas a fabric with tuck stitches exhibited poor UV protection. The colored knitted fabric with miss stitches imparted relatively better UV protection in a lighter color depth than the fabric with tuck stitches that were dyed in a darker shade. It infers the potential for reducing usage of dyestuffs and chemical auxiliaries in manufacturing UV protective clothing. Besides, knitted fabrics with miss stitches retained good UV protection under the stretched and wet conditions that simulating the daily wearing conditions of knitwear. The results of this study would provide value-added information to textile designers, manufacturers, and consumers for the enhancement of UV protection and selection of UV protective knitwear.
