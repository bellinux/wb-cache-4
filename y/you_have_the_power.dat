2500|$|During an {{interview}} with Lopez, journalist Diane Sawyer of ABC News noted that people [...] "in the abuse counseling industry, have said you can't tell women that, they can't do that. That something that's dangerous, even {{to see it in}} their minds." [...] Lopez responded by stating: [...] "Well, you know, this is a movie that has the touches upon those themes, but really, it's a thriller [...] it's about empowering yourself in any situation, you know, that you have. When I read the script, I saw it as, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> within yourself, no matter how severe the situation can be, to change whatever that is, to find that power within yourself to change any negative situation." ...|$|E

[...] Then truly your feet become pollen. [...] Your hands become pollen. Your body becomes pollen. [...] Your head becomes pollen. Your spirit will then become pollen. [...] Your voice will then become pollen. [...] All of you is as pollen is. And what pollen is, that is what peace is. The trail ahead is now a {{beautiful}} trail. Long life is ahead. [...] Happiness is ahead." [...] "Now," [...] she said, [...] "You {{are ready to go}} on. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> that you need. Walk in beauty." ...|$|E
2500|$|Doughty advocates reappropriating pejoratives like 'morbid', and [...] {{wants to}} reverse the {{attitude}} that [...] "talking about death is deviant". She says, [...] "Death is not deviant, it's actually the most normal and universal act there is." [...] She is working to overcome the belief that dead bodies are dangerous and can only be handled by trained professionals using technical equipment and specialized facilities. She says {{the most important thing}} she wants the public to know is that the corpse is the family's legal quasi-property, and that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> over what happens to that body. Don't let anyone, funeral home, hospital, coroner, etc., pressure you into making a quick decision you might regret. Take the time to do your research and understand your options. The dead person will still be dead in 24 hours; you have time to make the right decision for you. While a body is not commercial property, which can be transferred or held for a debt, for purposes of burial the body is treated as the next of kin's property. Her highest priority changes that she would like to see in US law would be the repeal of the laws in eight states that require a funeral home for at least some part of the process, and to make alkaline hydrolysis available in more than the current eight states.|$|E

6000|$|... "I quite {{agree with}} you in your sentiments, Mr. Grey. Now what {{character}} or what situation in life would you choose, if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> of making your choice?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, on yours. When we {{told him}} of your kind language, he at once assured us all that <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>power,</b> and, if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> promised, would <b>have</b> <b>the</b> inclination, to procure Henry's pardon." ...|$|R
2500|$|As with season one, {{the writing}} team {{came up with}} more [...] "what if" [...] episodes for the series, like season two's [...] "Visitor", which came from the idea of, [...] "what if someone showed up and Clark began {{to believe that he}} wasn't the last person from his planet." [...] In the case of [...] "Nocturne", [...] "what if Clark had been brought up by {{different}} parents?" [...] With [...] "Nocturne", the episode is meant to be [...] "an extreme version of the Clark story". As Gough explains, [...] "Here's a kid with a condition, whose parents literally lock him in the basement. It's an extreme parenting episodeâ€”contrasting how these parents deal with Byron, and how the Kents deal with Clark." [...] The episode also dealt with Clark's fallibility, in the fact that Clark is only a teenager, and he does not always have all of the facts; just because he thinks he is doing the right thing {{does not necessarily mean that}} he is. In this case, Clark believes that he is saving Byron from his abusive parents. Gough clarifies, [...] "'s doing what he thinks is right, but ultimately unleashes the kid, and [...] causes damage. Just because <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> and you think you're right doesn't always mean you're taking the right course of action." [...] Another [...] "what if" [...] episode was [...] "Witness", which originally came from the concept, [...] "what if Clark witnessed a crime and had to testify in court as to why he was standing in the middle of the road at 2 o'clock in the morning?" [...] In the end, the court angle was dropped from the storyline, with Clark making an anonymous phone call to the Sheriff and eventually having to battle the three kryptonite powered thieves that he had witnessed stealing.|$|E

You are strong men; {{but if you do}} not choose to suffer because you are strong, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to take {{everything}} from the weak.

6000|$|... "Not madness, madame," [...] he answered, with chill haughtiness--"not madness, but righteous indignation. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> defied <b>the</b> <b>power</b> of Holy Church as <b>you</b> <b>have</b> defied <b>the</b> <b>power</b> of our {{sovereign}} lady, {{and justice}} is upon you. We {{are here to}} present the reckoning, and see its payment made in full." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That won't suit her; {{you let me}} manage it, and don't {{feel any}} shame or anxiety about it.

6000|$|... "At {{any rate}} I didn't expect that," [...] replied Adrian in a fury. [...] "And now, if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> all <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>you</b> pretend, {{tell me what}} I am to do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then call it forth, Asti," [...] {{answered}} Tua wearily, [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>power.</b> If not, oh! let us die. But say, {{whom would}} you summon? The glory of Amen or {{the ghost of}} Pharaoh, or Ahura, my mother, {{or one of the}} guardian gods?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "What took me there?" [...] he echoed, {{turning his}} feverish eyes upon me, almost with fierceness. [...] "The same motive that {{led me to}} join hands with that ruffian St. Auban, when he spoke of waging war against Mancini; the same motive that led me to break with him when I saw through his plans, and when the {{abduction}} of Mademoiselle was on foot; the same motive that made me {{come to you and}} tell you of the proposed abduction so that you might interfere if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>power,</b> or cause others to do so if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> not." ...|$|R
