500|$|Between 25 January and 29 January, Thomas {{was interviewed}} four times {{by members of}} the Australian Federal Police (AFP) and {{by members of the}} Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO), {{accompanied}} by Pakistani officials. During one of these interviews, a Pakistani official said to Thomas [...] "we told you that you have to prove it... that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> terrorist... you have to prove it that you are an innocent man and why you are sitting here." [...] Thomas was then transferred again, this time to the city of Lahore, where he was kept for another three weeks, and interrogated by Pakistani officials and an American official referred to as [...] "Joe". This man suggested that Thomas return to Afghanistan with a recording device, to obtain information on Al Qaeda figures, a suggestion Thomas rejected because he feared he would be killed. Joe also threatened Thomas that he would be sent to Afghanistan where he would be tortured by having his testicles twisted, and implied that agents would be sent to Australia to rape Thomas' wife. Thomas was then returned to Islamabad.|$|E

2500|$|He {{spent much}} of his later days {{coaching}} at the S.C.G. for the New South Wales Cricket Association, and watching closely the progress of any new player whom he had taken under his wing. He also paid close attention to his overall dress and appearance. If he took exception to this, the youngster would know it. [...] "Son," [...] he would tell him.

2500|$|The Hare runs {{like crazy}} through a forest and meets the Wolf. The Wolf asks: [...] "What's the matter? Why such haste?" [...] / [...] "The camels there are caught and shod!" [...] The Wolf says: [...] "But you're not a camel!" [...] / [...] "Hey, after you are caught and shod, just {{you try to}} prove to them that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> camel!" [...] This joke is a {{suggested}} to be an origin of the popular Russian saying [...] "try to prove <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> camel" [...] in the sense [...] "try to prove something to someone who doesn't want to listen", used in relation to violations of {{the presumption of innocence}} by Russian law enforcement agencies, or when someone has to fight the bureaucracy to get official papers proving that one has lost a leg or is even alive. The Hare and the joke itself were used to illustrate the hassles of a Soviet lishenets in a 1929 issue of a satirical magazine Chudak. Mikhail Melnichenko, in an article about Soviet political jokes cites a 1926 private collection, which renders the joke in a more gruesome form, where [...] the Hare is scared of the rumor that all camels are taken hostages by Cheka and shot (a reference to the Red Terror). A similar parable was told by a 13th-century Persian poet and Sufi Jalal ad-Din Rumi, it which a person was scared to be taken for a donkey and skinned.|$|E

[...] "Release Me" [...] was succeeded by two more hit ballads: [...] "There Goes My Everything" [...] and [...] "The Last Waltz", earning him {{a reputation as a}} crooner, a description which he disputed. [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> crooner," [...] he told The Hollywood Reporter writer Rick Sherwood: [...] "It's something you don't want to be called. No crooner has the range I have. I can hit notes a bank could not cash. What I am is a contemporary singer, a stylised performer." ...|$|E

2500|$|Arturo Toscanini, a {{prominent}} anti-fascist, was furious {{to learn that}} Furtwängler {{would be at the}} Festival. He accepted his engagement in Salzburg on the condition that he would not have to meet Furtwängler. But the two did meet, and argued over Furtwängler's actions. Toscanini argued: [...] "I know quite well that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> member of the Party. I am also aware that you have helped your Jewish friends [...] But everyone who conducts in the Third Reich is a Nazi!". Furtwängler emphatically denied this and said: [...] "By that, you imply that art and music are merely propaganda, a false front, as it were, for any Government which happens to be in power. If a Nazi Government is in power, then, as a conductor, I am a Nazi; under the communists, I would be a Communist; under the democrats, a democrat... No, a thousand times no! Music belongs to a different world, and is above chance political events." [...] Toscanini disagreed and that ended the discussion.|$|E
2500|$|In 1964, Jack Warner {{spoke of}} the [...] "magic quality that {{transformed}} this sometimes bland and not beautiful little girl into a great artist," [...] and in a 1988 interview, Davis remarked that, unlike many of her contemporaries, she had forged a career {{without the benefit of}} beauty. She admitted she was terrified during the making of her earliest films and that she became tough by necessity. [...] "Until you're known in my profession as a monster, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> star," [...] she said, [...] " [...] I've never fought for anything in a treacherous way. I've never fought for anything but the good of the film." [...] During the making of All About Eve, (1950) Joseph L. Mankiewicz told her of the perception in Hollywood that she was difficult, and she explained that when the audience saw her on screen, they did not consider that her appearance was the result of numerous people working behind the scenes. If she was presented as [...] "a horse's ass ... forty feet wide, and thirty feet high," [...] that is all the audience [...] "would see or care about." ...|$|E
