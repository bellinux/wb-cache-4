5|$|The {{national}} flag has {{a length of}} 2.20meters and a width of 1.47m, a ratio of 2 to 3. The field is split into three horizontal colored bands, a yellow band of one-half the flag's width, a blue band of one-quarter the width, and a red band of one-quarter the width. All three bands extend {{the full length of}} the flag. The flag is charged with the Ecuadorian coat of arms scaled to one-half the width of the flag and centered in the field. The coat of arms itself is constructed in a rectangle with proportions 12:10. The national standard has the same design as the {{national flag}}, but is square, with length 0.9m and width 0.9m. When used by military units and organizations, lettering can encircle the coat of arms with a diameter of 55 centimeters. The lettering must be 4cm in height, 3cm in width, gold-colored Roman font, embroidered with gold thread. The only other regulated size is a table flag (banderola) where the flag is 200mm wide and 300mm long. When manufacturing the national flag, sellers to the public must include the name of their company, along with the <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>manufacture,</b> by placing a 20 × 10mm tag on the reverse side of the flag on the sleeve.|$|E
25|$|Some {{collectors}} are generalists {{with very}} broad criteria for inclusion, while others {{focus on a}} subtopic within their area of interest. Some collectors accumulate arbitrarily many objects that meet the thematic and quality requirements of their collection, others—called completists or completionists—aim to acquire all items in a well-defined set that can in principle be completed, and others seek {{a limited number of}} items per category (e.g. one representative item per <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>manufacture</b> or place of purchase). The monetary value of objects is important to some collectors but irrelevant to others. Some collectors maintain objects in pristine condition, while others use the items they collect.|$|E
25|$|Although many kiosks {{have been}} fitted with {{replacement}} backs over recent years, unmodified examples generally have the identity of their manufacturer marked on a plate on the outside {{at the bottom of}} their back panel. The only exceptions are the few Mk1 models made by Bratt Colbran, which are anonymous. A supplementary way of identifying the manufacturer is by means of casting marks on the various component parts – i.e. LF, CC, MF, MS and BC – which were used to various extents over the years. A more consistent manufacturer mark can be found at about shoulder height on the inner face of the back panel. These marks generally identify both the manufacturer and the precise model of kiosk. Up to around 1949, the <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>manufacture</b> is also included. The more recently erected non-BT K6 kiosks (generally painted black) are for the most part new castings, sourced from new manufacturers.|$|E

500|$|The Type 26 {{revolver}} {{was issued}} with a clamshell holster {{similar to the}} French Modèle 1892 revolver. [...] The earliest Type 26 holsters were black, and the cotton lanyards issued with them were a dark blue color known in Japan as kon. A leather pocket for the cleaning rod was provided, sewn onto the forward edge of the holster body. Most examples of holsters are stamped {{on the inside of}} the clamshell flap with the maker's identification and arsenal inspection markings with the <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>manufacture.</b> [...] Very early holsters, issued in the late 1890s and early 1900s, were of a slightly different size and shape and without a pocket for the cleaning rod. A few holsters developed in 1943 have been noted to be all black lacquered hardware, missing the brass and galvanized steel fittings. Holsters produced towards the end of World War II have a last ditch fabric similar to late production Type 94 Nambu pistol holsters, with no shoulder straps or pouches for cleaning rods and ammunition.|$|E
500|$|Han lacquerwares were privately made as well {{as being}} {{manufactured}} in government workshops. Hundreds of laborers could be employed to work on a single luxury item, such as a lacquered cup or screen. Some lacquerwares were inscribed simply with the clan name of the family who owned them. Others were inscribed with the titles of the owner, the specific type of the vessels, their capacities, the precise day, month, and <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>manufacture</b> (according to Chinese era names and their lunisolar calendar), the names of the floor managers who oversaw the items' production and the names of the workers who made them. Even some iron implements made during the age of the monopoly bore inscriptions of the date they were made {{and the name of the}} workshop. Bronze calipers from the Xin dynasty, used for minute measurements, had an inscription stating that it was [...] "made on a gui-you day at new moon of the first month of the first year of the Shijian guo period." [...] The calipers date from 9 AD. Han lacquerwares bearing the imperial mark of the emperor have been found far beyond the Han capital regions by modern archaeologists, in places such as Qingzhen (in Guizhou), Pyongyang (in North Korea), and Noin Ula (in Mongolia).|$|E

Unlike TA4 cars, the current rules allow them to [...] "...compete at a higher level of preparation." [...] Standard body appearance must be maintained, including the OEM grille and badge. As with TA4, Tube frames are not allowed, and roll cages are mandatory. Some engines are required to have restrictor plates, for the purpose of equalizing performance. Minimum Vehicle Base Weights may be changed for the same purpose.|$|E
2500|$|... in 1985 {{a series}} of pieces were {{produced}} under the title The Bizarre Collection, with the mark for the [...] "Royal Staffordshire Pottery by Clarice Cliff", and marketed by the Midwinter pottery. These pieces were all hand painted, unlike some of the later production Wedgwood, and faithfully respected the original designs and production methods {{with the exception of}} the crocus conical sifter. The production actually took lace on the same premises as the original production line of the Newport pottery. [...] The 3 principal designs produced were Honolulu on a 12 inch Mei Ping vase, Summerhouse on a 13 inch [...] wall plate and a striking version of Umbrellas and Rain on a conical bowl. These pieces can be identified with a tiny impressed 85 for the <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>manufacture.</b> There was also a selection of 6 conical sugar sifters, again hand painted, {{with the exception of the}} aforementioned Crocus which was lithographed. Whilst the purists still scoff at these pieces some 30 years later they are actually a very accurate representation of the originals they were copied from and in themselves are now becoming sought after not least because they allow collectors to acquire excellent pieces and a more affordable price.|$|E
