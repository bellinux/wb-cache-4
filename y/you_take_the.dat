Or take a woman's virtue: there is no difficulty in describing it as the duty of ordering the house well, looking after the property indoors, and obeying her husband.|$|E
25|$|Prior to {{his career}} in music, Mos Def entered public life as a child actor, having played roles in {{television}} movies, sitcoms and theater, {{some of which were}} under the name Dante Beze. At the age of 14, he appeared in the TV movie God Bless the Child, starring Mare Winningham, which aired on ABC in 1988. He played the oldest child in the 1990 family sitcom <b>You</b> <b>Take</b> <b>the</b> Kids shortly before it was cancelled. In 1995 he played the character Dante, Bill Cosby's sidekick on the short-lived detective show, The Cosby Mysteries. In 1996 he also starred in a Visa check card commercial featuring Deion Sanders. In 1997 he had a small role alongside Michael Jackson in his short film and music video Ghosts (1997).|$|E

25|$|If {{you could}} {{demonstrate}} that the BBC was grossly extravagant {{there might be a}} case for saying OK take it away.

If <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> money away, which part of the BBC will you remove? The BBC has gone through swingeing staff cuts. It has been cut to the bone, if you divert licence fee money elsewhere, you cut quality and services. There is always that threat from politicians who will say your licence fee is up for grabs. We will take it. There {{is a lot of people}} who want to see the BBC weakened. They talk of this terrible tax of the licence fee. Yet it is the best bargain that is going. Four radio channels and god knows how many TV channels. It is piffling.|$|E

She got too close to Barbie in the '80s and '90s and has now effectively returned to that younger positioning." [...] The doll was again released in two sizes, with the standard-size Sindy a Woolworths exclusive, after Woolworths had not stocked a Sindy doll for four years. The 2006 Sindy was aimed at three- to five-year-old girls, younger than the audience targeted by Bratz dolls, and mothers who wanted a more innocent-looking doll for their daughters than Barbie or Bratz dolls.|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} offered Dr. No to Guy Green, Guy Hamilton, Val Guest and Ken Hughes to direct, {{but all of}} them {{turned it}} down. They finally signed Terence Young who had a long background with Broccoli's Warwick Films as the director. Broccoli and Saltzman felt that Young would {{be able to make a}} real impression of James Bond and transfer the essence of the character from book to film. Young imposed many stylistic choices for the character which continued throughout the film series. Young also decided to inject much humour, as he considered that [...] "a lot of things in this film, the sex and violence and so on, if played straight, a) would be objectionable, and b) we're never gonna go past the censors; but the moment <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> mickey out, put the tongue out in the cheek, it seems to disarm." ...|$|E
500|$|Possibly {{because of}} its size, The Sirens and Ulysses failed to sell at the 1837 Summer Exhibition. In October 1837 wealthy Manchester cotton {{merchant}} Daniel Grant, an admirer of Etty who had already commissioned Venus and her Doves from him, met Etty at Heaton Park races and offered to buy The Sirens and Ulysses and Etty's smaller Samson Betrayed by Delilah unseen {{for a total of}} £200. Etty was hoping for £400 for the two paintings, but on being told by Grant that his firm had lost £100,000 that year offered a price of £300 for the pair. Grant counter-offered £250 (about £ in today's terms), which Etty refused. On leaving {{at the end of the}} evening, Grant suddenly said, [...] "Will <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> money?", startling Etty, who in his surprise agreed. Grant died shortly afterwards, leaving the painting to his brother William, who in turn gave it to the Royal Manchester Institution in 1839.|$|E

500|$|DuVall joined Alice in Chains as {{lead singer}} during the band's reunion concerts. Duff McKagan again joined the band for the reunion tour, playing rhythm guitar on {{selected}} songs. Cantrell explained the reunion, [...] "We want to celebrate {{what we did}} {{and the memory of}} our friend.

It's a tough thing to go through. Do <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> Led Zeppelin approach and never play again, because the guy was that important?

500|$|He {{recalled}} later: [...] "He {{positioned himself}} {{off to one}} side of-and some distance away from-the last Il-2 in a formation of six. He then turned in quickly and opened fire at the enemy's cockpit from an angle of some 30 degrees. The Il-2 immediately burst into flames and crashed. 'Do you see how it's done?', Oberst Mölders' voice came over the R/T. 'Right, now <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> next one.' I carried out the same manoeuvre and, sure enough, the next Il-2 went down on fire. 'And again!' It was like being on a training flight. Another short burst and the third Il-2 was ablaze. The whole lesson had lasted no more than 12 minutes!" [...] In this way, Kaiser scored his 23rd and 24th kills. But because Mölders was officially banned from operational flying, the first Soviet aircraft was never officially credited to him. Within the next two months, it is speculated that Mölders unofficially shot down around another 30 Soviet aircraft. At least six of Mölders' unofficial victories are recorded in his fellow pilots' private log books.|$|E
500|$|Despite stating he was [...] "100 percent" [...] healthy {{after the}} groin injury {{suffered}} two games prior, it appeared the injury was still lingering; after throwing a pass {{during the third}} quarter, Cutler fell down and grabbed his groin, before standing back up. [...] Regarding the injuries, Cutler stated, [...] "It held up OK. It's {{all on the same}} leg so I think that was a problem. But the groin, <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> ankle out of the equation and I would have been fine, I think." [...] Cutler ended the game having completed 21 of 40 passes for 250 yards with a touchdown, interception and a 69.8 passer rating. Despite x-rays on his ankle being negative, Cutler was ruled out of the next week's game against the Baltimore Ravens with a high ankle sprain. During the second quarter, Charles Tillman was also injured, suffering a torn right triceps brachii muscle, and was placed on injured reserve with the designation to return, allowing him to practice after six weeks and play in games two weeks after; as a result, Tillman missed the entire regular season.|$|E
