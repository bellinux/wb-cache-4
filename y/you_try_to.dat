5|$|From the few Greeks of Mani and {{the rest}} of Greeks who live there to Ibrahim Pasha. We {{received}} your letter in which <b>you</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> frighten us saying that if we don't surrender, you'll kill the Maniots and plunder Mani. That's why we are waiting for you and your army. We, the inhabitants of Mani, sign and wait for you.|$|E
5|$|If, after I am {{home in the}} West, {{you make}} me a normal {{contract}} offer, a business deal such as people sign every day all over the world, and I like your offer, then I will come back and work with you {{in accordance with the}} contract. But if <b>you</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> put me to work under coercion of any kind, then I will resist to my dying gasp.|$|E
5|$|Once you're a Catholic, you're {{always a}} Catholic—in {{terms of your}} {{feelings}} of guilt and remorse and whether you've sinned or not. Sometimes I'm wracked with guilt when I needn't be, and that, to me, is left over from my Catholic upbringing. Because in Catholicism you are born a sinner {{and you are a}} sinner all of your life. No matter how <b>you</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> get away from it, the sin is within you all the time.|$|E

25|$|Because in Catholicism {{you are a}} born sinner and you're {{a sinner}} all your life. No matter how <b>you</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> get away from it, the sin is within you all the time.

Bowl at the wicket.' Snow did just that next ball and took Redpath's leg stump – around behind his legs. Three for 269.|$|E
25|$|It's {{a complex}} {{question}} to answer, really. As musicians <b>you</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> find {{a name for}} your band that represents you and you never really do, because, basically, names for bands lose their meaning after a while. They become a series of sounds that you associate with people in music. The {{most important thing for}} a name is that you can imagine forty-thousand people screaming it in unison.|$|E

25|$|I {{fought the}} communists {{as part of}} the {{battalion}} combat teams, I went up the ladder. Battalion staff officer. Company commander. Task Force commander. Special Forces group commander. Brigade commander. All in different periods in our country. Huk campaign. Korean War campaign. The Vietnam War, and I {{was the head of the}} advance party of the PHILCAG (Philippine Civil Action Group to Vietnam) that went to a tiny province at the Cambodian border – the so-called Alligator Jaw – War Zone Z where even Max Soliven said ‘The Viet-Cong will eat us up.’ Of course, we were physically there as non-combat troops. But <b>you</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> be a non-combat troop in a combat area – that is the toughest kind of assignment.|$|E
25|$|Ilê Aiyê's {{success has}} {{continued}} ever since and their numbers have grown into the thousands. Even today, the black only bloco continues to exclude others {{because of their}} skin color. They do this by advertising exclusive parties and benefits for members, as well as physically shunning and pushing you away if <b>you</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> include yourself. Though the media has called it ‘racist’, {{to a large degree}} the black-only bloco {{has become one of the}} most interesting aspects of Salvador’s Carnaval and is continuously accepted as a way of life. Combined with the influence of Olodum in Salvador, musical protest and representation as a product of slavery and black consciousness has slowly grown into a more powerful force. Musical representation of problems and issues have long been part of Brazil's history, and Ilê Aiyê and Olodum both produce creative ways to remain relevant and popular.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} Elle {{was created}} long before Bell was cast; however, Kring noted [...] "when you do cast an actor ... <b>you</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> tailor that character {{a little closer}} to who the actor is. So it's hard to know when one starts to influence the other".|$|E

500|$|In {{the wake}} of the film's withdrawal, Richard Curtis {{admitted}} that the attempt {{to draw attention to the}} cause of lowering [...] emissions may have backfired. Curtis said [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> be funny on a serious subject, it's obviously risky. I hope people who don't like the little film will still think about the big issue and try to do something about it." ...|$|E
500|$|Sony {{then held}} auditions {{for the role}} of the young Peter, who needed to {{resemble}} Garfield. Webb said, [...] "I think we saw the origin of Spider-Man before but not the origin of Peter Parker." [...] Webb felt that when <b>you</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> build the film you must build the protagonist from the ground up. That's why he wanted Parker to begin as a child.|$|E

500|$|In The Independent, Dominic Lawson wrote [...] "As {{often as}} 10:10 {{tried to pull}} the film off YouTube, their critics re-posted it. This, at least, proves what a cataclysmic misjudgement Curtis had made. When <b>you</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> satirise the critics of your campaign, {{and it turns out}} that those very critics embrace your film as demonstrating exactly what they find {{unbearable}} about the climate-obsessed eco-lobby, then you know that you have kicked the ball into your own net".|$|E
500|$|Ross {{has been}} a streaky player {{throughout}} his career. He described this in 2006: [...] "I have gotten in grooves before, and <b>you</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> stay in {{it as long as}} you can until it ends. And it does end. I've been notorious for that my whole career, where I'll hit five or six in a week, where it seems like I can't miss the pitch and I feel good in the batter's box." [...] The most famous of these came in 2010, when Ross's torrid hitting in the playoffs helped San Francisco win the 2010 World Series.|$|E
500|$|The God of War comic series {{received}} mixed reviews. Mike Murphy of Platform Nation {{stated that}} although the comic series serves as a good prequel to the video game series, [...] "the story is bogged down by horrible art... muddy, confusing, and consistently pulls {{you out of the}} story as <b>you</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> figure out just what is going on from panel to panel." [...] Rating it 5 out of 10, Murphy said that he [...] "can’t give this one a pass, even to the hardcore God of War fans" [...] who should [...] "skip it." ...|$|E

500|$|Alistair Brownlee and Jonathan Brownlee were {{considered}} strong favourites before the race. The 2000 men's Olympic triathlon champion, Canadian Simon Whitfield, said that, [...] "If you run this Olympic race ten times, {{one of the}} Brownlee brothers will win {{nine out of ten}} times. But they won’t win it that 10th time, and <b>you</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> be that person to be there to capitalise on it that 10th time.” Among other contenders were Javier Gómez of Spain, who was the ITU Triathlon World Champion in both the 2008 World Championships and the 2010 World Championships; New Zealander Bevan Docherty; Whitfield of Canada and the 2008 Olympic champion Jan Frodeno from Germany.|$|E
500|$|Another {{recurrent}} {{theme in}} the album is that everything is broken, out of place or missing; This is apparent in nearly all songs in the album. Examples include [...] "Fix You" [...] ("When you lose something you can't replace") and also in [...] "X" [...] ("When something is broken, and <b>you</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> fix it, trying to repair it, any way you can") and [...] "Talk" [...] ("Are you lost or incomplete? Do {{you feel like a}} puzzle, you can't find your missing piece?"). This theme is also reflective of the random, incomprehensible pattern on the album's cover (until you [...] "fix" [...] it using the Baudot Code).|$|E
500|$|The film {{features}} {{a number of}} scenes which involve Detectives Frazier and Mitchell (Chiwitel Ejiofor) interrogating several hostages during {{the aftermath of the}} heist. Libatique described these scenes as a [...] "flash-forward" [...] to events, explaining that Lee [...] "wanted a look that would jump out and tell you you’re somewhere else." [...] Libatique photographed the scenes with Kodak Ektachrome 100D 5285 reversal film. Technicolor then cross-processed the filmed footage before it was put through a bleach bypass, which neutralized color temperature and created more contrast. Libatique explained, [...] "Basically, it unifies all the color...When <b>you</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> apply correction, the film moves in very strange ways." ...|$|E
