6000|$|You then, whose {{judgment}} {{the right}} course would steer, Know well each ancient's proper character; His fable, subject, scope in every page; [...] 120 Religion, country, genius of his age; Without all these at once before your eyes, Cavil you may, but never criticise. Be Homer's works your study and delight, Read them by day, and meditate by night; Thence form your judgment, thence your maxims bring, And trace the Muses upward to their spring. Still with itself compared, his text peruse; And let <b>your</b> <b>comment</b> be the Mantuan Muse. When first young Maro in his boundless mind, [...] 130 A work t' outlast immortal Rome design'd, Perhaps he seem'd above the critic's law, And but from Nature's fountains scorn'd to draw: But when t' examine every part he came, Nature and Homer were, he found, the same. Convinced, amazed, he checks the bold design, And rules as strict his labour'd work confine, As if the Stagyrite[13] o'erlook'd each line. Learn hence for ancient rules a just esteem; To copy nature is to copy them. [...] 140 Some beauties yet no precepts can declare, For there's a happiness {{as well as}} care. Music resembles poetry, in each Are nameless graces which no methods teach, And which a master-hand alone can reach. If, where the rules not far enough extend, (Since rules were made but to promote their end) Some lucky license answer to the full The intent proposed, that license is a rule; Thus Pegasus, a nearer way to take, [...] 150 May boldly deviate from the common track; Great wits sometimes may gloriously offend, And rise to faults true critics dare not mend, From vulgar bounds with brave disorder part, And snatch a grace {{beyond the reach of}} art, Which, without passing through the judgment, gains The heart, and all its end at once attains. In prospects thus, some objects please our eyes, Which out of nature's common order rise, The shapeless rock, or hanging precipice. [...] 160 But though the ancients thus their rules invade, (As kings dispense with laws themselves have made) Moderns, beware! or if you must offend Against the precept, ne'er transgress its end; Let it be seldom, and compell'd by need, And have at least their precedent to plead. The critic else proceeds without remorse, Seizes your fame, and puts his laws in force.|$|E

I know you may not believe this, but as a friend, I think you will regret staking out that claim." [...] The White House subsequently released a statement that [...] "of course no threat was intended...The note suggested that Mr. Woodward would regret the observation he made regarding the sequester because that observation was inaccurate, nothing more."

Its a normal flowing river with a high activity of flood in Moon Soon, a very well maintained flood control wall has been constructed to stop the water to enter in the populated area of village. Some three decades ago this river was seen having crystal clear water, but due to high growth in population the river has become a sanitation channel and most of the wastage water of the village has been diverted to Bara river which has destroyed its purity and presently it looks like a drainage canal.

This is a famous hunting ground for migratory birds, hunters from Peshawar gathers in winter for hunting sport. Fishing can also be experienced on the banks of River Kabul.
