But I can't stand saying one thing when everyone knows I mean another. Whats the use in such hypocrisy? If people arrange the world that way for women, theres no good pretending it's arranged the other way. No: I never was a bit ashamed really. I consider I had a right to be proud of how we managed everything so respectably, and never had a word against us, and how the girls were so well taken care of. Some of them did very well: one of them married an ambassador. But of course now I daren't talk about such things: whatever would they think of us! [She yawns]. Oh dear!

30|$|Respondents {{were also}} asked about a variety of family and {{individual}} characteristics. In terms of their parents, participants were asked about the educational attainment of their mothers and fathers. The higher of the two (when two parents were present) was then included {{as a measure of}} the highest parental education, with responses including “eighth grade or less” (1), “beyond the eighth grade but did not complete high school” (2), “high school degree” (3), “attended college but did not finish degree” (4), “four-year college degree” (5), and “graduate or professional degree” (6). Maternal employment was also assessed, with respondents being queried about whether their mother was employed for pay outside the home (yes[*]=[*] 1, no[*]=[*] 0). Since the familial context is likely to influence both dating and marriage patterns among young adults, participants were asked: “For most of the time when <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>growing</b> up, did you think your parents’ marriage was not too happy (1), just about average (2), happier than average (3), or very happy (4).” Since western culture could potentially affect dating and marriage patterns among Chinese young adults, the respondents were also queried as to whether English was spoken in their homes (1 [*]=[*]yes, 0 [*]=[*]no). In regard to parental influence, participants were offered the following statement: “I would be willing to date someone of whom my parents/family did not approve.” Responses ranged from “strongly disagree” (1) to “strongly agree” (5).|$|E

Maternal employment was also assessed, with respondents being queried about whether their mother was employed for pay outside the home (yes = 1, no = 0).

40|$|To {{assess the}} risk of a loan {{applicant}} defaulting, lenders feed applicants ‟ data into credit scoring algorithms. They are always looking to improve the effectiveness of their predictions, which means improving the algorithms and/or collecting different data. Research on financial behavior found that elements of a person‟s family history and social ties can be good predictors of financial responsibility and control. Our study investigated how loan applicants applying for a credit card would respond to questions such as “Did any of your loved ones die while <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>growing</b> up? ” 48 participants were asked to complete a new type of credit card application form containing such requests as part of a “Consumer Acceptance Test ” of a credit card with lower interest rates, but only available to “financially responsible customers. ” This was a double-blind study – the experimenters processing participants were told exactly the same. We found that: (1) more sensitive items are disclosed less often- e. g. friends ‟ names and contact had only a 69 % answer rate; (2) privacy fundamentalists are 5. 6 times less likely to disclose data; and (3) providing a justification for a question has no effect on its answer rate. Discrepancies between acceptability and disclosure were observed – e. g. 43 % provided names and contact of friends, having said they found the question unacceptable. We conclude that collecting data items not traditionally seen as relevant could be made acceptable if lenders can credibly establish relevance, and assure applicants they will be assessed fairly. More research needs to be done on how to best communicate these qualities...|$|E
40|$|Transition into {{adulthood}} is a developmental outcome of late adolescence. The transition to independent living, for all adolescents, represents a normalizing task towards adulthood. For some adolescents with Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD) this transition occurs against a back-drop of impaired social relatedness, lengthy out-of-home placements, limited family support, and limited financial resources. The {{purpose of this}} study was to ascertain the experience of adolescents with PDD who have transitioned into a supervised apartment setting associated with an adult mental health services provider. The research questions addressed in this study were: What is the experience of adolescents with PDD who have transitioned into a supervised apartment setting? How do adolescents with pervasive developmental disorder perceive their current functioning? ^ The concept of transition, proposed by Chick and Meleis (1986) as a central concept of nursing, was used to guide the study. Descriptive qualitative research methodology was used to analyze data. Purposive sampling was used to recruit participants. Ten individuals volunteered to participate in a face-to-face interview that occurred in their apartments. A semi-structured interview was used to gather data around living environment, presentation of self, personal history, and relationships with others. The predominant request posed to participants was: “Tell me about something that has happened in the last few months that helped you understand that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>growing</b> up and becoming more independent in your living. ” Thematic analysis occurred with all interview data. ^ This research resulted in a number of themes. Descriptions of the growing-up event were clustered around issues of increasing independence, clarification of relationship with mother, and accountability. Other identified themes included unrealistic goals for the future and poor physical health. The predominant and unexpected theme from all participant interviews involved chronic sorrow. Participants were sad about their life situations, what they were missing, and what they lacked in social relationships. Nurses need to be aware of the quality of life issues around managing a severely impaired population attempting to live within a community. This study described the life situations of ten impaired participants involved in structured independent living within a community. ...|$|E
40|$|At {{the end of}} his life, Pierre Hadot was a {{professor}} at the Collège de France — a “professor’s professor” — and he helped Michel Foucault, most famously, conceptualize ethics. Hadot devoted his career to recovering the ancient conception of philosophy, according to which the discourses of universities are but a fragment of what philosophy is. His engagement with this theme helped Bendik-Keymer understand and develop a personal counter-culture to his academic work, a kind of original academics truer to the idea of the philosophical school Plato first developed in his Ἀκαδήµεια. But while Plato’s school developed a useful form of life, it had an ambivalent relation to democracy and to everyday people. Whereas Plato was in some ways one of the first egalitarians by merit (especially concerning women), he was also deeply classist in his categorization of intellectual potentials. He effectively thought some people were stupid by nature, having no philosophical worth. Hence the Ἀκαδήµεια existed outside the city, in practice exclusive and somewhat sequestered. To some extent, Plato’s vision of philosophy — at least as explained by Hadot — had the practical point of philosophy right, but this point still needed to be rendered thoroughly democratic in the polyphony and multiple intelligences of people. Doing so coheres with what Foucault was after in his application of Hadot. It is also what Bendik-Keymer is after — to extract what is good from original academics and make it democratic, as opposed to dumbing people down. This “book of becoming” weaves together poetry, photo album, exploded essay (including tears and scotch tape), philosophical commentary, memoir, and aphoristic journal. …The breathtaking result is a philosophical askesis for our time: polyphonic, democratic, practical, and urgent. …This writing is inspiring, honest, and brave. ~Lynne Huffer, author of Mad for FoucaultImagine the kind of philosophy book you might have wished for when <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>growing</b> up. Seeking a reader who would be patient and open-minded enough to live with her own questions and to walk around town with her thoughts, this book would not have a single thesis but would rather work through multiple problems and be an experience, born out of life-experience. It would not be summarizable. It would be larger than the reader and open onto different kinds of readings. This is the kind of philosophy book that was at home in the 19 th century. It is rare to come across a book that does what it says…. [Solar Calendar] enacts…[a] conversation with the reader that is generous, demanding, and disarmingly personal. Its unusual form bears some resemblance to Pessoa’s Book of Disquiet…. ~Shannon Lee Dawdy, author of Patina: a Profane ArcheologySolar Calendar (a follow-up to Bendik-Keymer’s The Ecological Life: Discovering Citizenship and a Sense of Humanity) contains six oddities: a family portrait, a parody-essay, a time-capsule poem, an exploded essay, a poetic record of an act, and an aphorism journal for a year. Their inspirations are Epictetus’ notebooks, Tarkovski’s Mirror, and Apollinaire’s roving “Zone. ” Also experiments in ecology — the study of home — the six sections originate in rifts that challenge us as growing people. They alternate between environmental problems and tensions within families, as if the fissures in love and in society wash back and forth between each other as we try to make a home in the world. Multiple times layer over each other like the sounds of a large, democratic city. The personal and the planetary intersect. The space before, and against, policy where politics arises as assertion opens up in glimpses, fragmenting the body and inertia of oppressive orders. Philosophy arises as a homely and idiosyncratic practice of multiple forms of intuition, reflection and intelligence for muddling through life. Painstaking exercises in being human are grounded in unconditional love and in truthfulness — in the desire to become. [P]hilosophy is an unfinished practice in being human. Unlike any other text I have read in recent memory, Solar Calendar expresses this practice by revealing the cosmos in the personal and the personal in the cosmos. … This is a text that does not rest complacently in the residue of its own insights. ~Ryan Johnson, Department of Philosophy, Elon UniversityTable of Contents // Preface a.
