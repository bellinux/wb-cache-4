METHODS: A total of 44 patients seen by a home care program were studied. Protocol 1 a) <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> {{was measured by the}} patient, a physician and a nurse during a regular home visit (Home 1); b) home <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> measurement was measured for 4 days (HBPM 1); c) office <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> measurement was measured by a physician, a nurse, and the patient; and by 24 -hour ambulatory <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> monitoring. Protocol 2 <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> was measured by the patient, a physician, and a nurse during a special home visit {{in the presence of a}} physician and a nurse only (Home 2); and b) home <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> measurement was taken for the second time (HBPM 2). Echocardiography, guided by a two-dimensional echocardiograph, was performed. RESULTS: Protocol 1 : a) office <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> measurement and Home 1 were significantly higher than ambulatory <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> monitoring, except for systolic and diastolic office <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> measurement taken by the patient or a family member, systolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> taken by a nurse, and diastolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> taken by a physician. b) ambulatory <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> monitoring and HBPM 1 were similar. Protocol 2 : a) HBPM 2 and Home 2 were similar. b) Home 2 was significantly lower than Home 1, except for diastolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> taken by a nurse or the patient. There were significant relationships between: a) diastolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> measured by the patient and the thickness of the interventricular septum, posterior wall, and left ventricular mass; and b) ambulatory and HBPM 2 diastolic and systolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> taken by a physician (home 2) and left ventricular mass. Therefore, the data indicate that home <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> measurement and ambulatory <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> monitoring had good prognostic values relative to "office measurement.

OBJECTIVE: Improvement of self-monitoring and improved <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> control by using a new colour-coded <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> diary.

Secondary outcome: Adherence to <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> self-measurement (number of measurements/entries). METHODS/DESIGN: Randomised controlled study. Population: 138 adult patients in primary care with uncontrolled hypertension despite therapy. The control group uses a conventional <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> diary; the intervention group uses the new colour-coded <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> diary (green, yellow, red according a traffic light system).
