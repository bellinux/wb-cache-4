6000|$|The girl laughed. [...] "Well," [...] she said, [...] "most of {{the folks}} in this {{province}} who read newspapers have. There was a column about <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> sick <b>partner</b> <b>and</b> the doctor. <b>You</b> carried him across the range when he was too played out to walk, didn't you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Be assured I {{will take}} none at {{the hand of}} any man, whether his hat be cocked or broad-brimmed,' {{answered}} the fisherman. 'I tell you in fair terms, Joshua Geddes, that <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>partners</b> are using unlawful craft to destroy {{the fish in the}} Solway by stake-nets and wears; and that we, who fish fairly, and like men, as our fathers did, have daily and yearly less sport and less profit. Do not think gravity or hypocrisy can carry it off as you have done. The world knows <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> we know <b>you.</b> You will destroy the salmon which makes the livelihood of fifty poor families, <b>and</b> then wipe <b>your</b> mouth, <b>and</b> go to make a speech at meeting. But do not hope it will last thus. I give you fair warning, we will be upon you one morning soon, when we will not leave a stake standing in the pools of the Solway; and down the tide they shall every one go, and well if we do not send a lessee along with them.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{one would}} imagine! There was {{probably}} no trail at all. Two {{of our friends}} who live half a mile off don't think they can get back. It's fortunate for us that <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>partner</b> had the strength and courage----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, it doesn't matter, as I've {{nothing to}} do with him. Now that I'm here, I'll say that I'd be glad to {{accommodate}} <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>partner</b> if you want to extend your operations or hold on for better prices at any time. You're putting in a big crop." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Anyhow, I didn't. You {{want to stop}} {{shooting}} rocks {{when there}} are men around. Then you've mussed up the track and can't put her straight. Why don't you hire more boys and rush the job? Can't see why the bosses let two deadbeats like <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>partner</b> have the contract!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{advice to}} you, Cousin Diggory, is that <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>partners</b> should {{continue}} to keep silent as to this voyage of ours. If we come not back, and after a time there is a talk here that we {{have gone to the}} Indies, the news may be carried to London; <b>and</b> <b>you</b> may be questioned, and may be blamed mightily for undertaking such an adventure, without the king's permission; and all sorts of harm may fall upon you. Success would, in my mind, altogether excuse you; <b>and</b> <b>you</b> will be able to offer so great a present to the king that he will be mighty contented. But if you fail, it will be otherwise. Therefore my advice is, till the Swan is anchored in the port say nothing about her. It were best, from the moment we sail, to write off all that has been spent upon her as money lost, just the same as if you knew for certain that she had gone down as soon as she was out of sight of land.|$|R

But because I do believe you--it seems to me all wrong! For the very reasons that you give for not having spoken to me BEFORE, if you really felt as you say you did, are the same reasons why you should not speak to me now. You see, all this time you have let nobody but yourself know how you felt toward me. In everybody's eyes <b>YOU</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>partners</b> have been only the three stuck-up, exclusive, college-bred men who mined a poor claim in the Gulch, and occasionally came here to this hotel as customers. In everybody's eyes I have been only the rich hotel-keeper's popular daughter who sometimes waited upon you--but nothing more. But at least we were then pretty much alike, and as good as each other. And now, {{as soon as you}} have become suddenly rich, and, of course, the SUPERIOR, you rush down here to ask me to acknowledge it by accepting you!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Don't say 'inhuman,'" [...] Madame Fontaine {{answered}} gently; [...] "it is I alone who am to blame. I {{have been}} a cause of estrangement between <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>partner,</b> and I have destroyed whatever little chance I might once have had of setting myself right in Mr. Keller's estimation. All due to my rashness in mentioning my name.

6000|$|Having {{many letters}} {{to write on}} {{returning}} to England after so long an absence, I regret that I must be so brief on the present occasion.

What a vast field is there open to the English mind, acting through our noble language! Let us hope that our authors of true genius will not be unconscious of that thought, or inattentive to the duty which it imposes upon them, of doing their utmost to instruct, to purify, and to elevate their readers. That such may be my own endeavour through the short time I shall have to remain in this world, is a prayer in which I am sure <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> life's <b>partner</b> will join me.

5000|$|Winning battles grants {{the player}} {{experience}} points which go toward gaining levels, making the characters stronger in the process, {{and just like}} Lufia II: Rise of the Sinistrals, several monsters (called [...] "Disc Monsters" [...] in this title and caught in battle {{in a similar manner}} to Pokémon) can be captured instead of slain and used to fight with the party. The monsters can be fused with Eldin, Torma or Rami for three turns in combat once a character's Installation Points ("IP") reach their maximum. These points are visible by a gauge just beneath a characters hit points and ability points, and fill up when they are hit by an enemy. In your new merged state, you lose control of the character but gain two abilities. The first is invincibility: while you're merged with <b>your</b> monster <b>partner,</b> you can not be hurt or given status ailments in any way. The second is a special attack (depends on what form you're in) {{that may or may not}} do more damage than your characters normally can: this same move is repeated until all three turns pass. Once three turns go by, <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> monster <b>partner</b> revert to normal. It's important to note that you can't merge with <b>your</b> selected <b>partner</b> unless he or she has built up at least three hearts worth of Loyalty with the character (Loyalty can be found on the monster's status menu; the max number of hearts is five). Loyalty is raised by simply having <b>your</b> <b>partner</b> accompany <b>your</b> party <b>and</b> earn experience from fights (the partner does not have to actually be an active fighter to raise its Loyalty).|$|R

6000|$|Hard {{work and}} excitement? Let the wind baffle and drop {{in a heavy}} tide- way just as you are sailing your little sloop through a narrow draw-bridge. Behold your sails, upon which you are depending, flap with sudden emptiness, and then see the impish wind, with a haul of eight points, fill your jib aback with a gusty puff. Around she goes, and sweeps, not through the open draw, but {{broadside}} on against the solid piles. Hear {{the roar of the}} tide, sucking through the trestle. And hear <b>and</b> see <b>your</b> pretty, fresh-painted boat crash against the piles. Feel her stout little hull give to the impact. See the rail actually pinch in. Hear <b>your</b> canvas tearing, <b>and</b> see the black, square-ended timbers thrusting holes through it. Smash! There goes <b>your</b> topmast stay, <b>and</b> the topmast reels over drunkenly above you. There is a ripping and crunching. If it continues, your starboard shrouds will be torn out. Grab a rope--any rope--and take a turn around a pile. But the free end of the rope is too short. You can't make it fast, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> hold on <b>and</b> wildly yell for your one companion to get a turn with another and longer rope. Hold on! You hold on till you are purple in the face, till it seems your arms are dragging out of their sockets, till the blood bursts from the ends of your fingers. But <b>you</b> hold, <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>partner</b> gets the longer rope and makes it fast. <b>You</b> straighten up <b>and</b> look at <b>your</b> hands. They are ruined. You can scarcely relax the crooks of the fingers. The pain is sickening. But there is no time. The skiff, which is always perverse, is pounding against the barnacles on the piles which threaten to scrape its gunwale off. It's drop the peak! Down jib! Then <b>you</b> run lines, <b>and</b> pull and haul and heave, and exchange unpleasant remarks with the bridge-tender who is always willing to meet you more than half way in such repartee. And finally, {{at the end of an}} hour, with aching back, sweat-soaked shirt, <b>and</b> slaughtered hands, <b>you</b> are through <b>and</b> swinging along on the placid, beneficent tide between narrow banks where the cattle stand knee-deep and gaze wonderingly at you.
