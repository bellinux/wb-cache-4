Wyman later indicated how [...] "White Tulip" [...] {{helped with}} {{the evolution of the}} show in an interview: [...] "It's very important to constantly try to attract more viewers and to try and not make the show alienating... Our solution {{came in the form of}} ‘White Tulip' and episodes like that, because we realized what we need to do to satiate both our hardcore fans and our financial responsibility is to create a term that we coined a 'mythalone.' It sounds really simple when you say it now, like, ‘Yes, sure, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> standalone case, plus you thread in some great mythology.' But I've got to tell you it took us a long time to get there and realize it. Now we have that our template for telling stories that we think satisfies both parties". He and Pinkner later listed [...] "White Tulip" [...] as one of their favorite episodes.|$|E
500|$|Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly {{described}} Scar as [...] "a {{figure of}} both pity and evil, and of treacherous comedy" [...] with [...] "Irons... filling this devious coward with elegantly witty self-loathing." [...] As an animator, Deja believes that [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> voice to work with, {{your work is}} half done." [...] Enjoying {{the way in which}} Irons [...] "has a way with words and phrasing," [...] Deja deliberately based much of Scar's appearance on the actor himself, specifically the shape of his mouth and facial expressions. Several of the actor's physical attributes were incorporated into Scar's design, with Irons admitting to recognizing his own baggy eyes in his character. Additionally, Deja studied Irons' performances in the films Reversal of Fortune (1990) and Damage (1992) for inspiration, while refusing to watch Disney's The Jungle Book while working on The Lion King in order to avoid being influenced by the film's villain Shere Khan, a tiger.|$|E

A promotional extended play (EP) titled Key Cuts from Remixed with several remixes from {{the album was}} released in September 2005. A contest was launched on Spears' paid fan site for those who pre-ordered the album. The winner received a copy of , a bottle of Spears' fragrance Fantasy with an additional lotion and make-up kit, and a personalized autographed picture of Spears. On November 22, 2005, the day the album was released, a release party was held at an unspecified nightclub in Los Angeles, California, organized by Spears' management and the webmaster of the fansite WorldOfBritney.com. It was a limited event to five hundred people, including members of the fansite or her official fan club. Spears commented: [...] "I {{just wanted to say}} that I love the idea of all my fans getting together to celebrate the release of my new album. I was happy to help! I hope <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> night out at the club and dance all night long!".|$|E

500|$|On July 8, he {{was seriously}} wounded by mortar fire, having just {{returned}} from the canteen bringing chocolate and cigarettes for {{the men at the}} front line. Despite his wounds, Hemingway assisted Italian soldiers to safety, for which he received the Italian Silver Medal of Bravery. Still only 18, Hemingway said of the incident: [...] "When you go to war as a boy <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> illusion of immortality. Other people get killed; not you... Then when you are badly wounded the first time you lose that illusion and you know it can happen to you." [...] He sustained severe shrapnel wounds to both legs, underwent an immediate operation at a distribution center, and spent five days at a field hospital before he was transferred for recuperation to the Red Cross hospital in Milan.

[...] He invoked the image of the hejab {{as a symbol of the}} revolution, saying that, “a nation whose respected women demonstrate in modest garb [...] to express their disgust with the shah’s regime- such a nation will be victorious.” He also said that, [...] "women from all levels of society took part in the recent demonstrations, which we are calling the [...] "referendum of the streets"...women fought side by side with men in the struggle for their independence and their liberty." [...] Khomeini pleaded women to participate in anti-Shah demonstrations in various cities. Furthermore, women later responded to Khomeini’s urge to vote in favor of the Islamic Republic and new constitution cities. Women were so pivotal to the revolution that in response to a suggestion from a top aid to ban women from coming to group audience, Khomeini said [...] "I threw the shah out with these women, there's no problem in their coming." ...|$|E
