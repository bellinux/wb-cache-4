5|$|When {{you think}} about Goya, who painted the most horrendous {{pictures}} of violence and torture and so forth, and they're amazing, exquisite paintings, {{one of the reasons}} they're such wonderful paintings is because what he's saying is, 'Look– look at this.' So if you paint it badly or put it in the sort of wrong perspective, <b>you</b> <b>draw</b> more attention to what's wrong with the image rather than looking at the image.|$|E
25|$|A {{systematic}} error or bias occurs {{when there is}} a difference between the true value (in the population) and the observed value (in the study) from any cause other than sampling variability. An example of {{systematic error}} is if, unknown to you, the pulse oximeter you are using is set incorrectly and adds two points to the true value each time a measurement is taken. The measuring device could be precise but not accurate. Because the error happens in every instance, it is systematic. Conclusions <b>you</b> <b>draw</b> based on that data will still be incorrect. But the error can be reproduced in the future (e.g., by using the same mis-set instrument).|$|E
500|$|McG {{described}} the film's theme as [...] "where <b>you</b> <b>draw</b> {{the line between}} machines and humans". The friendship between Marcus—who was executed (for murder) when humanity still ruled the world—and Kyle Reese illustrates how war and suffering can {{bring out the best}} in people, such as when they worked together to survive during the Blitz. The title was derived from this second chance given to humanity and to Marcus, in addition to John's efforts to save humanity from the machines. The film's original title was Terminator Salvation: The Future Begins, but this was dropped during filming.|$|E

500|$|A Kryptonian sent by {{his parents}} to Earth as an infant to escape the {{destruction}} of his homeworld, Krypton, and raised in Smallville, Kansas, under mental guidance of farmers Martha and Jonathan Kent until he is inspired by the holographic message from his late father to become Earth's greatest protector (Superman is depicted as being 33 years old, {{at least from the}} moment he is found, in the present timeline of the film). Cavill is the first British and non-American actor to play the character. He was previously cast in , which was ultimately shelved, and was considered for the role in the 2006 film Superman Returns, but lost to Brandon Routh. Cavill stated, [...] "There's a very real story behind the Superman character." [...] He explained that everyone's goal has been to explore the difficulties his character faces as a result of having multiple identities – including his birth name, Kal-El, and his alter ego, Clark Kent. Cavill also stated that, [...] "He's alone and there's no one like him," [...] referring to Superman's vulnerabilities. [...] "That must be incredibly scary and lonely, not to know who you are or what you are, and {{trying to find out what}} makes sense. Where's your baseline? What do <b>you</b> <b>draw</b> from? Where do <b>you</b> <b>draw</b> a limit with the power you have? In itself, that's an incredible weakness." [...] In an interview with Total Film magazine, Cavill stated he had been consuming nearly 5,000 calories a day, training for over two hours daily and plowing protein to pack on the muscle mass. Joe Manganiello was considered for the role but could not work out an audition date for the casting director due to scheduling obligations with True Blood. Cooper Timberline was cast as the 9-year-old Clark Kent, and Dylan Sprayberry was cast as the 13-year-old Clark Kent.|$|E

Things have a weird way of happening naturally and organically when they're supposed to. And I feel that this song was just meant to be, for this movie. Basically, I wrote the song for me to go through all these kinds of things as an actress with this character. <b>You</b> <b>draw</b> from all different experiences in your life.

500|$|The Jupiter trojans, {{commonly}} called Trojan asteroids or just Trojans, {{are a large}} group of asteroids that share the planet Jupiter's orbit around the Sun. [...] They are named for heroes in the ancient Greek tales of the Trojan War. [...] Relative to Jupiter, each Trojan librates around one of Jupiter's two stable Lagrange points: , lying 60° ahead of the planet in its orbit, and , 60° behind. Jupiter trojans are distributed in two elongated, curved regions around these Lagrangian points with an average semi-major axis of about 5.2AU. [...] If <b>you</b> <b>draw</b> a line from Jupiter to each group of asteroids (one group that follows Jupiter in its orbit, and others that move ahead of it in its orbit), and then draw lines from Jupiter and both groups to the Sun, you will have two equal-sided triangles.|$|E

500|$|Kenneth Wayne Thomas, in Intrinsic Motivation at Work, {{described}} {{the book as}} [...] "somewhat sympathetic" [...] to Erhard and the est philosophy; Steve Jackson, writing in Westword, similarly included it among [...] "books sympathetic to Erhard, est and Landmark", written by an [...] "old friend of Erhard's". Stephen Goldstein, in a Washington Post review, said Bartley had made it [...] "obvious {{from the start that}} he cares about his subject and his own est experience" [...] and had told [...] "a rather simple, straightforward story that pretty much lets <b>you</b> <b>draw</b> your own conclusions [...] or keep the ones you have already reached."

[...] During the same scene Casey mutters [...] "I have a bad feeling about this," [...] a catch-phrase used by characters throughout the film series. The series is twice referenced directly, by Chuck when Sarah fails to understand his [...] "Chewie" [...] reference, and by Casey, who says, [...] "This {{is what happens when}} <b>you</b> <b>draw</b> your plans from Star Wars."

500|$|On March 8, 2005, a re-release of Too Bad You're Beautiful was issued, {{featuring}} the {{songs from the}} Sin, Sorrow, and Sadness EP. Under direction of producer Richardson, From Autumn to Ashes' third full length album, Abandon Your Friends, was released on August 30, 2005. The album stemmed from the idea that [...] " [...] kind of...what we do. I mean, {{in the sense of}} how life goes on when we go away [...]" [...] Abandon Your Friends met with speculation about the band's internal conflicts surrounding a potential break up. Perri had not been much involved in the process of creating the album and did not attend practice sessions, despite stating in interviews that the album was [...] "a full on collaborative effort" [...] and [...] "We just all had a say in what we were writing." [...] It was revealed in 2007, in interviews, and when Mark posted in the band's Myspace blog that he had ghostwritten Perri's lyrics in a matter of days. The band had made a further move away from the melodic sound of their past albums, and had been a point where the band shifted more focus to Mark's vocals. CMJ reviewer Tracey John explained that the album [...] "continues to unabashedly straddle both ends of the hardcore/emo spectrum", however, the band [...] "doesn't show much of a progression from 2003's The Fiction We Live." [...] The album generally garnered reviews in which it was noted that, as a reviewer at Punk News explained that if you're a [...] "fan of From Autumn to Ashes, you'll be disappointed."Others disagreed, like UK magazine Kerrang! who gave the album a 5 out of 5 review and called it a metal masterpiece. This album would also go on to sell over 100,000 copies. Abandon Your Friends produced one single, [...] "Where Do <b>You</b> <b>Draw</b> The Line?" [...] with an accompanying music video. Unhappy with intraband politics, guitarist Jonathan Cox quit the band.|$|E
