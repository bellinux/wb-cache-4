6000|$|MY DEAR COLVIN,--Thank <b>you</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>your</b> note. This morning I am stupid again; can {{do nothing}} at all; am no good [...] "comme plumitif."

60|$|MY DEAR MACKAY,--Thank <b>you</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>your</b> kind letter, {{and still}} more for your good opinion.

Thank <b>you</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>your</b> information. I have no doubt that it will be sufficient to decide any bets there may be about her." ...|$|E

6000|$|GENTLEMEN,--I thank <b>you</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>your</b> {{invitation}} to the Agricultural dinner, and would promptly accept it and as promptly be there but {{for the fact that}} Mr. Greeley is very busy this month and has requested me to clandestinely continue for him in The Tribune the articles [...] "What I Know about Farming."
