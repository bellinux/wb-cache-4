2500|$|Rachael Blampied had auditioned 5 {{times for}} Shortland Street, with her last being {{for the role}} of Zlata Waldheim. However Blampied was turned down every time as she looked too similar to one of the core actresses, Beth Allen (who portrayed Brooke Freeman). After she auditioned {{for the role of}} Zlata, {{producers}} decided to utilise their similarities and create the role of Bree – a sister for Brooke, specifically for her. Blampied received a call in mid-2011 asking if she was eager to accept the role. She was extremely pleased with the call, saying; [...] "It's the best phone call an actor can wish for – that they're writing a part for you on a show <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> on. It was a complete surprise and totally out of the blue." [...] The character was originally planned to appear nicer but end up being [...] "badder" [...] than Brooke. Blampied started filming her scenes in October 2011. Blampied found her first day of work similar to walking [...] "into a beast" [...] and although she was nervous, she found it was like [...] "a family". In November TVNZ announced that a new addition would be arriving to Brooke's dysfunctional family, with Bree arriving on 9 December. Blampied enjoyed working alongside her screen sister, Allen and Pua Magasiva (who portrayed Brooke's boyfriend Vinnie), saying; [...] "I've had some great scenes with Beth and Pua, which have been enormous fun as they're such generous actors and are heaps of fun to hang out with!" [...] The character was originally envisioned to be killed off {{at the end of her}} stint, but producers were so impressed with Blampied that they rewrote the characters ending by sending her to a psychiatric hospital. Blampied was not aware as to what Bree was to endure throughout her stint but was informed that she was always going to leave after her initial storyline came to an end. She was sad to leave the soap but pleased with her exit, [...] "I was sad to have to leave the show, but it's not a closed exit. One of the writers said to me on my last day, 'Well it's always good to have a crazy in the cupboard.'" [...] Bree made her last appearance on 25 September 2012.|$|E

Besides, this realistic description gets to be very tiresome.

5000|$|Bajraktarević began {{singing at}} an early age and she would later say that she got her voice from her father, a bohemian. As a child, she would sing to him while sitting in his lap. But when she had {{thoughts}} of pursuing a professional singing career, her father was not supportive. Then one day, after coming home hung over from a night of drinking, and with the wave of a hand, he said [...] "Go! If <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a singer, go." [...] In 1947, she was enrolled into elementary school, where she learned to play the mandolin, which was a gift from her parents. After that, she played the mandolin and sang more and more, but her grades in school kept declining. By the time she reached the eighth grade, all interest in school had been lost and she had made a name for herself locally as prominent kafana singer.|$|E

One of the show's strengths is the dynamic relationship between the sisters Billie and Nina Proudman (played by Keddie). Both actresses have spoken of their admiration for each other, with Stewart saying [...] "I've admired Asher ever since Love My Way. She is an actress of extraordinary ability and depth. We have a lovely shorthand and support for each other on set, not unlike Nina and Billie. There's a trust there that allows real spontaneity and joy." [...] Keddie spoke of Kat, saying [...] "It's exhilarating to perform with her; I feel genuinely excited by it. That's a great feeling to have as an actor - when <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> working opposite someone and with someone. It doesn't get much more rewarding than that." [...] Stewart admits to being fond of her character, Billie, despite some heartaches, [...] "I’m really fond of her, though she’s really frustrating sometimes. Though she cheated on Mick season four, it’s my job to see the world through her eyes. You see what happened in the lead-up and it was the ultimate act of self-destruction. It broke my heart." [...] Offspring aired for 5 seasons from 2010-14 before returning to TV screens for a sixth season in 2016. With production of the new series underway Stewart spoke to Colin Vickery of News Ltd, [...] "I really didn’t think it would happen", Stewart said. [...] "It was the best experience I’ve had in a show. You form such deep relationships with the people and also the characters. I feel really confident we’ll be able to deliver something great. I don’t think we’re going to coast on some sort of legacy. We’re really aware of that and all want it to be as fantastic and awesome as it can be. To get to walk around in Billie’s shoes again is fantastic.” The seventh season of the show, including Stewart and other key cast members, is back on screen in 2017.|$|E
