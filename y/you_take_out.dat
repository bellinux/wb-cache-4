5|$|In several Western {{countries}} it {{has been}} seen that absences due to sickness for women are far greater than men. When investigating the reasons behind this, a study done in Sweden published in 1996 found {{that half of the}} difference between genders can be dismissed if <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>out</b> the days missed by pregnant women. When taking into account the health effects of double burden, child birth is always a possibility for mothers who already are faced with taking care of children and having a career and effects them and their health. In many studies people have tried to relate the difference in sickness absences directly to the double burden effect. It has been somewhat successful as women who are faced with work and child care have been known to request more sick days than men in the same situation. Additionally, working wives with children have twice the absence rate as men who are placed in the same position in work family conflicts.|$|E
500|$|Stunt {{coordinator}} Danny Wesiles helped {{arrange the}} more frantic shots, {{such as the}} scene wherein a lunch table kills a teacher. Executive producer Frank Spotnitz later called the scene, [...] "probably {{one of the most}} horrific things we've ever done." [...] Due to the violent nature of the episode—and the table scene in particular—Fox's Standards and Practices department had an issue with the series showing [...] "the impact between the table and the man". In order to comply, the impact was removed, {{but the rest of the}} scene stayed intact. Spotnitz later noted that, [...] "when <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>out</b> the impact, the audience's imagination is ten times worse." ...|$|E
500|$|Courtney Love: [...] "We {{actually}} show Anne Boleyn too. She was Henry VIII's {{wife who}} had her head chopped off. When I was little, I {{used to see}} these pictures of her with this necklace that had a B on it. I always had a fascination with ancient history, Roman especially, and early English, and I kept imagining her getting her head chopped off, for my whole life. Then, I told my friend Joe, who did the art. He always had an obsession with Marie Antoinette too. She was also decapitated. We also thought about Jayne Mansfield, just {{the idea of a}} woman having her mouth and eyes and ears taken away from her. And, hand grenades, the top comes off. You just pull out the pin and it explodes. So, if you take away someone's mouth and their eyes and their senses and their brain, they explode. I saw a grenade in my head, I saw taking out the clip, and then I thought of a human body and what happens if <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>out</b> the clip." ...|$|E

2500|$|In September 2010 Clarkson {{was granted}} a privacy {{injunction}} against his first wife to prevent her from publishing claims that their sexual relationship continued after his second marriage (see AMM v HXW). He voluntarily lifted the injunction in October 2011, commenting that: [...] "Injunctions don’t work. <b>You</b> <b>take</b> <b>out</b> an injunction against somebody or some organisation and immediately news of that injunction and the people involved and {{the story behind the}} injunction is in a legal-free world on Twitter and the Internet. It’s pointless." ...|$|E
2500|$|On June 20, 2000, the City of New York filed {{a lawsuit}} against gun {{manufacturers}} and distributors. [...] Giuliani accused gun companies of [...] "deliberately manufacturing many more firearms than can be bought for the legitimate purposes of hunting and law enforcement." [...] Giuliani also said, [...] "This lawsuit is meant to end the free pass that gun industry has enjoyed for a very, very long time.... The more guns <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>out</b> of society, the more you are going to reduce murder." [...] The lawsuit remains active. [...] During his abortive run for the New York Senate seat in 2000, he advocated a uniform national standard for all gun owners and supported legislation that gave New York State the most restrictive gun laws in the nation.|$|E

[...] "Keep that with you," [...] said he, [...] "and you will always be rich, for <b>you</b> can <b>take</b> <b>out</b> of the purse as many twenty-five-cent silver pieces as you wish, one at a time.

6000|$|... "Inshallah!" [...] {{the sheik}} exclaimed, [...] "but it is wonderful.
