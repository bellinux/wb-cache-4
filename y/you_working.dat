500|$|Some reviewers of the Macintosh Classic {{focused on}} the {{processor}} performance and lack of expansion slots. Liza Schafer of Home Office Computing praised the Classic's ease of use and price, but criticized the [...] display because a full US letter page ( [...] × 11inches) would not fit at full size, and warned those who required high-end graphics and desktop publishing capabilities against buying the Classic. Schafer concluded: [...] "The Classic's value is more impressive than its performance, but its performance will get <b>you</b> <b>working</b> on that novel, database, or spreadsheet." [...] PC Week criticized {{the lack of a}} faster processor, stating, [...] "The 7.8MHz speed is adequate for text applications and limited graphics work, but it is not suitable for power users. As such, the Classic is appropriate as a home computer or for limited computing on the road." [...] Similarly, PC Users review concluded, [...] "The slow processor and lack of expansion slots on the Macintosh Classic offset the low prices". MacWEEK described it as a [...] "fine, inexpensive replacement for the Macintosh Plus that best embodies the original Macintosh vision {{six and a half years}} later". Computer Gaming World was more skeptical, doubting that consumers would purchase a black-and-white computer with no hard drive that was only slightly faster than the Mac Plus.|$|E
