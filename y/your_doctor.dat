25|$|Other body systems {{affected}} by Lyme-like Disease. More common than EM are symptoms due to invasion by the spirochaete {{of the nervous}} system, heart, muscles and joints. These may start weeks or months after the tickbite. Initially, they may include flu-like illness, fever, headache, sore throat, fatigue, aching muscles and joints. More serious are meningitis, Bell's palsy (weakness of the face muscles), swelling of joints, and heart problems with palpitations and breathlessness. Lyme disease is difficult to distinguish from many other illnesses like Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) because the symptoms may be similar. If you have symptoms that could be Lyme disease, {{even if you do}} not remember a tickbite, see <b>your</b> <b>doctor.</b> Diagnosis is helped by a blood test called a Western Blot test, but <b>your</b> <b>doctor</b> will consider whether any other illness could be causing your symptoms and may do some other tests.|$|E

2500|$|Al Gore said on March 21, 2007, {{before a}} U.S. House committee: [...] "The planet has a fever.

2500|$|The American Cancer Society's {{position}} regarding {{early detection}} is [...] "Research {{has not yet}} proven that {{the potential benefits of}} testing outweigh the harms of testing and treatment. The American Cancer Society believes that men should not be tested without learning about what we know and don’t know about the risks and possible benefits of testing and treatment.

2500|$|In a 2006 interview, Cornell {{revealed}} {{that at the}} age of 14, he had a bad PCP experience and suffered from panic disorder and agoraphobia. [...] "I had a bad PCP [...] experience when I was 14 and I got panic disorder. And of course, I wasn't telling anyone the truth. It's not like you go to your dad or <b>your</b> <b>doctor</b> and say, 'Yeah, I smoked PCP and I'm having a bad time.' So I became more or less agoraphobic because I'd have flashbacks. From 14 to 16, I didn't have any friends. I stayed home most of the time. Up till then life was pretty great. The world was big and I felt I could do anything I wanted. Suddenly, I felt like I couldn't do anything. But in the isolation, my imagination really had time to run. I never did any drugs until my late 20s. Unfortunately, being a child of two alcoholics, I started drinking a lot, and that's what eventually got me back into drugs. You often hear that pot leads to harder drugs. But I think alcohol is what leads you to everything, because it takes away the fear. The worst drug experimentation I ever did was because I was drunk and didn't care." ...|$|E
