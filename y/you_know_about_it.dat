500|$|The adult defendants, {{facing the}} death penalty, portrayed {{themselves}} at trial as unwilling {{participants in the}} conspiracy. [...] The examination of defendant Veljko Cubrilović (who helped coordinate the transport of the weapons and was a Narodna Odbrana agent) is illustrative of this effort. Cubrilović stated to the court: [...] "Princip glared at me and very forcefully said 'If you want to know, it is for that reason {{and we are going}} to carry out an assassination of the Heir and if <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> you have to be quiet. If you betray it, you and your family will be destroyed.'" [...] Under questioning by defense counsel Cubrilović described in more detail the basis of the fears that he said had compelled him to cooperate with Princip and Grabež." [...] Cubrilović explained that he was afraid a revolutionary organization capable of committing great atrocities stood behind Princip and that he therefore feared his house would be destroyed and his family killed if he did not comply and explained that he knew such an organization existed in Serbia, at least at one time. When pressed for why he risked the punishment of the law, and did not take the protection of the law against these threats he responded: [...] "I was more afraid of terror than the law." ...|$|E
