5|$|He gave a {{magnificent}} speech. He {{is one of}} the cleverest speakers I have ever heard. The questions on the Mundt-Nixon bill, his views on the loyalty oath, and the problem of international communism were just what he was waiting for. Indeed, he was so skillful—and, I might add, cagey—that those who came indifferent were sold, and even many of those who came to heckle went away with doubts... If he is only a fraction as effective as he was here you have a formidable opponent on <b>your</b> <b>hands.</b>|$|E

5|$|My factual {{position}} in the case {{as well as in}} the world of science of today does not permit me to enter the case against the Food and Drug Administration, since such action would, in my mind, imply admission of the authority of this special branch of the government to pass judgment on primordial, pre-atomic cosmic orgone energy. I, therefore, rest the case in full confidence in <b>your</b> <b>hands.</b>|$|E
5|$|Adomnán in his Life of Saint Columba {{offers a}} longer account, which Abbot Ségéne {{had heard from}} Oswald himself. Oswald, he says, {{had a vision of}} Columba the night before the battle, in which he was toldBe strong and act manfully. Behold, I will be with thee. This coming night go out from your camp into battle, for the Lord has granted me that at this time your foes shall be put to flight and Cadwallon your enemy shall be {{delivered}} into <b>your</b> <b>hands</b> and you shall return victorious after battle and reign happily. Oswald described his vision to his council and all agreed that they would be baptised and accept Christianity after the battle. In the battle that followed, the British were routed despite their superior numbers; Cadwallon himself was killed.|$|E

5000|$|Descartes {{believed}} that a human being was composed of both a material body and an immaterial soul (or [...] "mind"). According to Descartes, {{the mind and the}} body could interact. The body can affect the mind; for example, when you place <b>your</b> <b>hand</b> in a fire, the body relays sensory information from <b>your</b> <b>hand</b> to <b>your</b> mind, which results in your having the experience of pain. Similarly, the mind can affect the body; for example, you can decide to move <b>your</b> <b>hand</b> and <b>your</b> muscles obey, moving <b>your</b> <b>hand</b> as you desired.|$|R

25|$|Hot {{water that}} is {{comfortable}} for washing hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria. Bacteria grow much faster at body temperature (37 C). However, warm, soapy water {{is more effective than}} cold, soapy water at removing the natural oils on <b>your</b> <b>hands</b> which hold soils and bacteria. Contrary to popular belief however, scientific studies have shown that using warm water has no effect on reducing the microbial load on hands.|$|E

25|$|Releasing wild trout helps {{preserve}} {{the quality of}} a fishery. Trout are more delicate than most fish and require careful handling. When a trout has been caught but the hook is still embedded, wet <b>your</b> <b>hands</b> before handling the fish. Dry hands stick to the adhesive slime coating the fish and can pull off its scales. It is preferred for the fish to remain in the water when removing the hook, but holding the trout out of the water will not be lethal, provided the hook is removed quickly and the trout is returned immediately.|$|E
