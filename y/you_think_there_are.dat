2500|$|Rowling {{has said}} that Hogwarts is [...] "a multifaith school". She has further stated on the subject, [...] "The only people I never {{imagined}} there are Wiccans." [...] In response to the query, [...] "o <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> a lot of LGBT students in modern age Hogwarts? I like to imagine they formed an LGBT club," [...] Rowling replied, [...] "But of course." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What do <b>you</b> <b>think!</b> <b>There</b> <b>are</b> Fred and Songbird, and yes, {{there is}} Harold Bird, too! Oh, how glad I am {{that they are}} safe!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What do {{you think}} about it, Gilbert?" [...] demanded Jane. [...] "Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> some {{children}} who really need a whipping now and then?" ...|$|E
30|$|Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> {{tension between}} Buddhist and Catholic communities? All the {{respondents}} say no.|$|R
6000|$|MRS. CLANDON (with {{suppressed}} impatience). Mr. Valentine: do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> anything fast or loud about Phil and Dolly? ...|$|R
5000|$|Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a valid {{place for}} Mot√∂rhead to occupy in today's urban {{military}} industrial wasteland? True of false? ...|$|R
6000|$|R.--Supposing {{it to be}} so, do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> any {{points in}} which our English {{legislation}} is capable of amendment, as it bears on commercial and economical matters, in this present time? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> no {{such things}} as apparitions, Master Bletson?" [...] said Everard. [...] "I used to be sceptical on the subject; but, on my life, to-night has been a strange one." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am {{glad that}} <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> hopes for him. It {{has been a}} long attachment, but he thought it wrong to engage her {{affections}} while he had no prospect of being able to marry.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What made <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> {{something}} wrong with our internal machinery, whereby we might be wanting in a proper regard for victuals?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Didn't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> {{something}} suspicious about Walters' {{turning up}} again after he'd learned your name? <b>There</b> then <b>were</b> rather too many coincidences." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> some love lost {{between the}} master and man or {{mistress}} and maid nowadays," [...] our beaten antagonist feebly sneered.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; we {{were very}} much interested. I was sorry that I knew so little about inventions. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> many {{practical}} ideas amongst his things? I hope there are--he seemed so proud and pleased to show them. Shouldn't you think he had some real inventive talent?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] said Larochejaquelin, [...] "I don't think so. See how our Swiss fought--could any men be {{more true}} to their {{officers}} or their colours? and do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> not thousands in the French army as true, as brave as they? If Lafayette would raise his hand, I for one would join him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We wish to be," [...] said Dr. May, [...] "but {{there are}} little neglects--or <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are.</b> I will not say there are none, for that would be {{answering}} too much for human nature, or that they are fanciful--for that would be as little comfort as to tell a patient that the pain is only nervous--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What makes <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> {{anything}} the matter?" [...] asked George, with a smile. [...] "Have {{you and he}} been having any trouble?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> {{any chance}} of their attacking us to-night, down the slopes, as they did this morning?" [...] Tom asked Mr Harvey.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> {{any chance}} {{that we can get}} out of here?" [...] Fred asked after a long silence, and Sam replied, gravely: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I am. How {{could it}} be {{otherwise}} with me? Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> turns in a person's life when she must do something rash. Think of yourself. If everybody crushed you; if you were ill-treated beyond all belief; if {{the very people who}} ought to trust you doubted you, wouldn't you turn upon somebody and rend him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Winston did {{not answer}} for a moment, and then he laughed. [...] "I fancy Colonel Barrington is wrong," [...] he said. [...] "Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> latent {{capabilities}} in every man, though only one here and there gets an opportunity of using them? In any case, wouldn't it be pleasanter for any one to feel that his virtues were his own and not those of his family?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And do you think,' {{said the}} schoolmaster, marking the glance she had thrown around, 'that an unvisited grave, a {{withered}} tree, a faded flower or two, are tokens of forgetfulness or cold neglect? Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> no deeds, {{far away from}} here, in which these dead may be best remembered? Nell, Nell, there may be people busy in the world, at this instant, in whose good actions and good thoughts these very graves--neglected as they look to us--are the chief instruments.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hafrydda, do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no {{stronger}} feeling than {{pity for}} me in the heart of Branwen?" [...] asked Bladud in a subdued, earnest voice.|$|R
6000|$|... "You haven't? Well, Ludlow, I didn't {{lose any}} time. Perhaps <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> {{no one else}} to blame for the mortification of that poor child." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> any danger, Captain, I {{want to get}} out o' here quick. I'm {{not here}} to study the Tetong with his war-paint on." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am glad of that," [...] she {{answered}} heartily. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> many men in France {{who have been}} asked in marriage by a beautiful maiden--with her own lips--and who have refused her to her face? I know you men would half-despise such a triumph; but believe me, we women know more of what is precious in love. There is nothing that should set a person higher in his own esteem; and we women would prize nothing more dearly." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Now {{the social}} {{question}} is not so hopeless as <b>you</b> <b>think.</b> <b>There</b> <b>are</b> plenty of select fine places {{for you to go}} without a swagger gown. Of course, there is a very small circle here in Chicago which tries to be ultra-fashionable, but it's rather difficult because Chicago men have something else to do and won't be dragooned into studying Ward McAllister. You'll find the people here mostly good, sensible people, like the Harveys, who'll enjoy you in any nice, quiet dress. You can meet them informally at dinner or at their little Sunday evening in. So don't you take any more trouble about it," [...] she ended, [...] "and you needn't pay me for the lecture either." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{look quite}} {{peaceful}} and cheerful," [...] Marion Renshaw said to him. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> really any use {{in all these}} precautions, Mr. Atherton?" ...|$|R
30|$|Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> {{tension between}} Buddhist and Catholic communities? 76 % of {{respondents}} (n[*]=[*] 76) say no and 24 % of respondents (n[*]=[*] 24) say yes.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No more did I,' said Robina, 'but he does cough; I {{hear him}} through {{the wall in the}} morning. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> {{anything}} in it, Lance?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. We haven't {{anyone to}} beat Milligan, certainly. But {{there are the}} second and third places. Don't forget those. That's where we're going to have a look in. There's all sorts of unsuspected talent in Kay's. To look at Peel, for instance, you wouldn't think he could do the hundred in eleven, would you? Well, he can, only he's been too slack to go in for the race at the sports, because it meant training. I had him up here and {{reasoned}} with him, and he's promised to do his best. Eleven is good enough for second place in the hundred, don't <b>you</b> <b>think?</b> <b>There</b> <b>are</b> lots of others in the house who can do quite decently on the track, if they try. I've been making strict inquiries. Kay's are hot stuff, Jimmy. Heap big medicine. That's what they are." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I {{must go on}} with my story. I {{travelled}} {{through a}} deserted land. As the time went by I began to yearn more and more for human beings. But I never found one, and I grew lonelier and lonelier. I crossed Livermore Valley and the mountains {{between it and the}} great valley of the San Joaquin. You have never seen that valley, but it is very large and it is the home of the wild horse. There are great droves there, thousands and tens of thousands. I revisited it thirty years after, so I know. <b>You</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> lots of wild horses down here in the coast valleys, but they are as nothing compared with those of the San Joaquin. Strange to say, the cows, when they went wild, went back into the lower mountains. Evidently they were better able to protect themselves there.|$|E
6000|$|To {{enhance his}} surprise, his {{companion}} {{told him that}} the environs of the Castle, except the single winding path by which the portal might be safely approached, were, like the thickets through which they had passed, surrounded with every species of hidden pitfall, snare, and gin, to entrap the wretch who should venture thither without a guide; that upon the walls were constructed certain cradles of iron, called swallows' nests, from which the sentinels, who were regularly posted there, could without being exposed to any risk, take deliberate aim at any who should attempt to enter without the proper signal or password of the day; and that the Archers of the Royal Guard performed that duty day and night, for which they received high pay, rich clothing, and much honour and profit at the hands of King Louis. [...] "And now tell me, young man," [...] he continued, [...] "did you ever see so strong a fortress, and do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> men bold enough to storm it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{what about}} Mr. Peters? Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> danger he may {{change his mind}} about that five {{thousand}} dollars if we keep him waiting too long?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is {{a terrible}} situation," [...] said Will Osten, in a low tone, with an {{involuntary}} shudder. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> much chance of our surviving, captain?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Matter! Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> {{a single}} person in the county who will not know that his doing so {{is a sign that}} he has quarrelled with me?" ...|$|R
