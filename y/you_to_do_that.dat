2500|$|Laguerre also instituted the {{innovative}} concept of one long {{story at the}} end of every issue, which he called the [...] "bonus piece". These well-written, in-depth articles helped to distinguish Sports Illustrated from other sports publications, and helped launch the careers of such legendary writers as Frank Deford, who in March 2010 wrote of Laguerre, [...] "He smoked cigars and drank Scotch and made the sun move across the heavens ... His genius as an editor was that he made you want to please him, but he wanted <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> by writing in your own distinct way." ...|$|E
2500|$|Most of {{his attack}} is {{directed}} against the common conception of rationality, which he believes is badly flawed. First, he argues that reasons don't cause you to do anything, because having sufficient reason wills (but doesn't force) <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> thing. So in any decision situation we experience a gap between our reasons and our actions. For example, when we decide to vote, we do not simply determine that we care most about economic policy and that we prefer candidate Jones's economic policy. We also {{have to make an}} effort to cast our vote. Similarly, every time a guilty smoker lights a cigarette they are aware of succumbing to their craving, not merely of acting automatically as they do when they exhale. It is this gap that makes us think we have freedom of the will. Searle thinks whether we really have free will or not is an open question, but considers its absence highly unappealing because it makes the feeling of freedom of will an epiphenomenon, which is highly unlikely from the evolutionary point of view given its biological cost. He also says: [...] " [...] All rational activity presupposes free will [...] ".|$|E
