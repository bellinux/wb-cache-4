500|$|Stuart {{was known}} for working {{without the aid of}} sketches, {{beginning}} directly upon the canvas, which was very unusual for the time period. His approach is suggested by the advice which he gave to his pupil Matthew Harris Jouett: [...] "Never be sparing of colour, load <b>your</b> <b>pictures,</b> but keep your colours as separate as you can. No blending, tis destruction to clear & beatiful effect." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "To {{involve the}} public, {{you have to}} make each of <b>your</b> <b>pictures</b> a {{thousand}} times more spectacular than what you might see on the most exquisite day – otherwise you’ll never convey even one-tenth of {{what it feels like to}} be out there on the dullest gray day when nothing’s going on." [...] Bob Walker [...] (Beaver, Christopher, After the Storm: Bob Walker and the East Bay Regional Park District) ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{production}} {{wrapped in}} February 1946, Hitchcock {{had in the}} can what François Truffaut later told him [...] "gets a maximum of effect from a minimum of elements.... Of all <b>your</b> <b>pictures,</b> {{this is the one}} in which one feels the most perfect correlation between what you are aiming at and what appears on the screen.... To the eye, the ensemble is as perfect as an animated cartoon..." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Your {{attitude}} {{is like a}} box of crayons that color your world. Constantly color <b>your</b> <b>picture</b> gray, and <b>your</b> <b>picture</b> will always be bleak. *Try adding some bright colors to the picture by including humor, and <b>your</b> <b>picture</b> begins to lighten up." ...|$|R

2500|$|... "The Fall of the House of Usher" [...] {{has been}} criticized for being too formulaic. Poe was criticized for {{following}} his own patterns established in works like [...] "Morella" [...] and [...] "Ligeia," [...] using stock characters in stock scenes and stock situations. Repetitive themes like an unidentifiable disease, madness, and resurrection are also criticized. Washington Irving explained to Poe in a letter dated November 6, 1839, [...] "You have been too anxious to present <b>your</b> <b>pictures</b> vividly to the eye, or too distrustful of your effect, and had laid on too much colouring. It is erring on the best side--the side of luxuriance." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dick's wealth {{allowed him}} to provide his own funding, and gave him an {{independence}} the other photographers lacked. [...] Stryker attempted to provide some guidance {{for the kind of}} photographs he was looking for, writing to Dick, [...] "It is terribly important that you in some way try to show the town against this background of waste piles and coal tipples. In other words, it is a coal town and <b>your</b> <b>pictures</b> must tell it." [...] Instead, many of Dick's photographs are interiors, bars, and images of ordinary life. [...] Critic Collen McDannel has pointed out that, particularly in regard to his treatment of religion, Dick's work is different from most of the FSA file. [...] Because of his composition of images of the poor surrounded by religious items and by ordinary household objects (objects not in themselves indicating poverty), Dick's photographs are less politically clear than those of the other FSA photographers. [...] His composition [...] "transgresses common assumptions about men and religion and therefore appears to be less 'documentary.'" ...|$|E
