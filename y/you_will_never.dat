5|$|My {{philosophy}} {{about race}} relations is that I'm {{the man and}} I'll set my own patterns in life. I don't rely on anyone else's opinions. I look at a man as a human being; I don't care about his color. Some people feel that because you are black <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> be treated fairly, and that you should voice your opinions, be militant about them. I don't feel this way. You can't convince a fool against his will...If a man doesn't like me because I'm black, that's fine. I'll just go elsewhere, but I'm {{not going to let}} him change my life.|$|E

25|$|Isothermal - This model {{assumes that}} the {{compressed}} gas remains at a constant temperature throughout the compression or expansion process. In this cycle, internal energy {{is removed from the}} system as heat at the same rate that it is added by the mechanical work of compression. Isothermal compression or expansion more closely models real life when the compressor has a large heat exchanging surface, a small gas volume, or a long time scale (i.e., a small power level). Compressors that utilize inter-stage cooling between compression stages come closest to achieving perfect isothermal compression. However, with practical devices perfect isothermal compression is not attainable. For example, unless you have an infinite number of compression stages with corresponding intercoolers, <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> achieve perfect isothermal compression.|$|E

During his time in the Senate, Yeats further warned his colleagues: [...] "If you show that this country, southern Ireland, is going to be governed by Roman Catholic ideas and by Catholic ideas alone, <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> get the North...

500|$|The Room has {{received}} negative reviews for its acting, screenplay, dialogue, production values, score, direction, and cinematography. The film {{is described as}} one of the worst films ever made by several publications. By 2017, the film had a score of 32% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 22 reviews with an average rating of 3.3 out of 10. The critical consensus states [...] "A bona-fide classic of midnight cinema, Tommy Wiseau's misguided masterpiece subverts the rules of filmmaking with a boundless enthusiasm that renders such mundanities as acting, screenwriting, and cinematography utterly irrelevant. <b>You</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> see a football the same way again." [...] Despite the criticism, the film {{has received}} a positive reception from audiences for the same reasons, with some viewers calling it the [...] "best worst movie ever".|$|E

500|$|Frustrated by his {{inability}} to capture his subject, Ingres broke down in tears in his studio, in company. Bertin recalled [...] "consoling him: 'my dear Ingres, don't bother about me; and above all don't torment yourself like that. You want to start my portrait over again? Take your own time for it. <b>You</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> tire me, and {{just as long as}} you want me to come, I am at your orders.'" [...] After agreeing to a breathing spell Ingres finally settled on a design. Early biographers provide differing anecdotes regarding the inspiration for the distinctive seated pose. Henri Delaborde said Ingres observed Bertin in this posture while arguing politics after dinner with his sons. According to Eugène Emmanuel Amaury Duval (he said was related to him by Bertin), Ingres noticed a pose Bertin took while seated outside with Ingres and a third man at a café.|$|E

The day after the documentary aired, WWE accused CNN of taking Cena's comments out of context to present a biased point of view, backing up their claim by posting an unedited video of Cena answering the same question [...] filmed by WWE cameras from another angle [...] in which he is heard beginning the same statement with [...] "absolutely not". A text interview on the website with Cena later had him saying the news outlet should apologize for misrepresenting him, which CNN refused, saying they felt the true answer to the question began with the phrase [...] "my answer to that question". They did, however, edit the documentary on subsequent airings to include the [...] "absolutely not".|$|E
500|$|Niels Matthijs, {{writing for}} Twitch Film, stated that [...] "It's astounding how van Dormael turns each scene into a unique little {{cinematic}} event. There is hardly filler here, no scenes to drag out the running time or to fill some gaps in between other climaxes. Every scene matters and every scene {{is made to}} look like it matters. The director uses all means to his disposal to keep the viewer engaged and interested {{in the life of the}} main protagonist, Nemo Nobody." [...] Fred Topel, writing for Screen Junkies, praised the film's artistry, saying [...] "All of Nemo's lives are painful. No matter what he chooses, he experiences heartbreak, death of loved ones, his own death, and clinical depression. My future seems brighter, but the film makes the strong point that every experience is worthwhile. The goal isn't to choose the easiest path. It's to live." [...] Chris Holt from Starburst magazine wrote that [...] "Mr. Nobody is a film that is remarkable by its very existence and that in itself is something to be happy about. You may love it you may hate it, but you can bet that <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> forget it." [...] Exclaim!s Robert Bell called the film [...] "a powerful movie about what it means to be alive." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{the matter}} {{involved}} the prince, Stacey consulted other {{officers in the}} regiment about what should be done, and found that opinion was divided between allowing Gordon-Cumming {{to remain in the}} regiment while he defended himself, or removing him straight away. The Colonel of the Scots Guards, the prince's younger brother, the Duke of Connaught, was also asked: according to Havers, Grayson and Shankland, the duke [...] "insisted that Gordon-Cumming must be crushed". Stacey disagreed, and thought that the whole story needed to be brought out before such a decision was taken. He reported the situation to the Adjutant-General to the Forces, General Sir Redvers Buller, and requested permission to let Gordon-Cumming retire on half-pay. Buller agreed to the request, but stated that if Gordon-Cumming's legal action failed, the permission would be reviewed. Stacey relayed the message to Gordon-Cumming and told him that signing the note was an error: [...] "Because you signed that document <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> put on a sword in the regiment. If you bring a successful action you will be allowed to retire: if you fail, you will be dismissed [...] the service". The Duke of Connaught strongly disapproved of Buller's decision, and he withdrew to Portsmouth, refusing to again be drawn on the affair, even after his brother requested further advice.|$|E
