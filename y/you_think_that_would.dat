6000|$|Carrie laughed. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> count?" [...] Then {{she laid}} her hand upon his shoulder. [...] "Still, Charley, you will--to please me--be very careful?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Hetty met his glance, and Cheyne saw {{the little}} glow in her eyes. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> have counted for {{anything}} {{with such a}} man?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I like to {{hear you}} preach," [...] said he. [...] "Without a penny, indeed! Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> dance {{attendance}} upon him {{if he were a}} poor man? Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> Laura <b>would</b> ever have looked twice at him? You know as well as I do that she is marrying him only for his money." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very good, Jeeves. We {{will now}} suppose {{that there has}} {{recently}} been some little coolness between this tiger cub and this tigress. For some days, let us say, {{they have not been}} on speaking terms. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> make any difference to the vim with which the latter would leap to the former's aid?" ...|$|R
60|$|The wolf's {{jaw dropped}} in astonishment and terror. 'Do <b>you</b> really <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> happen?' he gasped.|$|R
6000|$|... "I've a great mind {{to write}} a letter, too," [...] said Rollo. [...] "I'll write to my mother. Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> be a good plan?" ...|$|E
6000|$|But Mrs. Greystock had a plan. [...] "Oh, mamma," [...] said Ellinor, {{when the}} plan was {{proposed}} to her, [...] "do not <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> be cruel?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{like men}} who have a future, and wo{{men who have}} a past," [...] he answered. [...] "Or do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> make it a {{petticoat}} party?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You have it--the rotten, insular conceit {{of these}} Englishmen! <b>You</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> she <b>would</b> not come? Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> if I {{were to say}} to her,--'Come and listen while I make garlands of words, while I take you through the golden doors!'--do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> she <b>would</b> not put her hand in mine? Fancy--to live in my fairy chamber, to listen while I give shape and {{substance}} to all that I conceive--what woman would refuse!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{march in}} very good order, Ned; do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> they <b>would</b> keep up such {{discipline}} as that after they had mutinied?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Father! Father! Impossible! Cruel! Oh--do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> I <b>would</b> have {{followed}} you hither from Africa, against your own entreaties, to desert you now?' ...|$|R
6000|$|Violet {{looked away}} from him. [...] "Ah," [...] she said, [...] "don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> be a little hard on them? Is it very {{easy for you to}} go away?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not know}} but that it would do very well. You might alter it a little; call him Mosette, if <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> be any better for a bird's name." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{how far do}} <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> go in {{supporting}} my daughter on the scale she is used to? I don't speak of your mother, who has the first claim upon you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We were {{thinking}} of having two made of the regimental pattern, sir, but smaller and lighter, if <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> it <b>would</b> be allowed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That reminds me," [...] said Dorothy, [...] "of {{the golden}} key I {{picked up on}} the shore. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> it <b>would</b> fit this key-hole, Billina?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> Milosevic <b>would</b> {{not have}} fallen if the United States and NATO had not intervened militarily? Is this a {{legitimate}} {{use of our}} military power? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> have mattered? We {{were both}} very young then, {{and we could}} have faced our {{troubles}} and grown up together. Now we're not the same. You let me grow up alone." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Mrs. Bowen! And <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> be a {{mitigating}} circumstance in his acceptance {{of money from}} her? If he had {{the spirit of a}} man at all, it would make it all the more revolting." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, Sam Rover! do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> money <b>would</b> {{make any}} {{difference}} to me?" [...] and now she raised her face to look him full in the eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> it <b>would</b> pain me, you are mistaken. It pains me more <b>that</b> <b>you</b> should <b>think</b> <b>that</b> I {{could not}} bear it. He was welcome to his wife." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> it <b>would</b> do," [...] says I. [...] "I own it {{troubles}} me. I {{would like}} it very ill, if I advised you at all wrong." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do like pretty {{clothes and}} think I'd {{like to meet}} smart people. The trouble is, they would know I didn't belong where they belonged and might leave me out. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> happen, Jim?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Camping out?" [...] Lady Meadowcroft exclaimed, half roused {{from her}} languor {{by the idea}} of a change. [...] "Oh, do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> be fun? Should we sleep on the ground? But, wouldn't it be dreadfully, horribly uncomfortable?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> prevent it?' {{said his}} mother, smiling. 'He {{is just the}} man to plume himself on making his {{judgment}} conquer his inclination, setting novels at defiance. How magnanimously he would resolve to stifle a hopeless attachment!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, candidly, Miss Reed, don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> {{prefer to}} have old Hannibal, whom you know, as county judge, than a {{stranger}} and a Northern man like ME?" ...|$|R
6000|$|She gave {{a kind of}} gasp of astonishment. [...] "Do <b>you</b> really <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> be right?" [...] She edged {{a little}} away from Dr. Morrell, as if with distrust.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am not certain," [...] said Jonas, [...] "that my dye will color hair; I {{never tried}} it, except on wood. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> black <b>would</b> {{be a pretty}} color?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You shall {{take him}} there. I am {{all alone in}} the world. I can make a home for myself at the cottage. It is empty now. If <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> save you you can try it for six months.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Did {{you think}} my love such a poor and {{superficial}} thing, Avery," [...] he said sternly, [...] "that it must vanish because a blemish came on your fairness? Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> change me? Was your own love for me so slight?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{could tell}} you who it is, if <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> do any good--if {{you think it would}} help me to see it in the true light, or you could help me more by knowing who it is than you can now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{seems to}} me that there is a grave danger of seeing Tuppy come out {{carrying}} a steak-and-kidney pie, but resume, Jeeves, resume. <b>You</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> this <b>would</b> clean everything up?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "MR. Kendricks!" [...] cried Mrs. March, with burlesque severity. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> I <b>would</b> offer <b>you</b> a heroine who was NOT in society? You {{forget that}} I am from Boston!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Frank! oh, Blazes," [...] said Willie sadly, [...] "has money told on you so fearfully already? Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> she <b>would</b> give <b>you</b> up for {{the sake}} of Auberly's dross?" ...|$|R
