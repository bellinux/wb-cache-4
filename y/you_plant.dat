[...] According to Blunt, who did not add the rider to the bill but who supported it, [...] "What it says is if <b>you</b> <b>plant</b> a crop that is legal to plant when <b>you</b> <b>plant</b> it, you get to harvest it". He later led Senate Republicans in defeating an amendment by Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley to repeal the provision. Blunt claimed all the amendment did [...] "was repeat [...] authority that the secretary in a hearing the other day, before the Agri Approp committee the other day, said he already had. And it didn't require the secretary to do anything that the secretary thought was the wrong thing to do. Which {{is one of the reasons}} I thought it was fine..." ...|$|E

2500|$|Much of the incriminating {{evidence}} — bloody glove, bloody socks, blood in {{and on the}} Bronco — was discovered by Los Angeles Police Detective Mark Fuhrman. He was later charged with perjury for falsely claiming during the trial {{that he had not}} used the word [...] "nigger" [...] within 10 years of the trial. Later during the trial, with the jury absent, he pleaded the Fifth Amendment against self-incrimination when asked [...] "did <b>you</b> <b>plant</b> or manufacture any evidence in this case?" [...] In a 2016 interview, defense attorney Alan Dershowitz suggested that Detective Philip Vannatter (not Detective Fuhrman) may have planted evidence on socks, based upon the presence of anti-coagulant in the blood discovered on the socks. Dershowitz said that the jury may have concluded that if the bloody socks evidence was fabricated by the police, then other evidence may have been fabricated as well. F.B.I. expert testimony said that the defense exaggerated the significance of the presence of the anti-coagulant.|$|E

60|$|But I {{leave out}} the soil. In any case we were mostly forced to {{disregard}} it. Perhaps a more fruitful source of failure even than the lack of loam was the attempt to apply calculation and mathematics to gardening. Thus, if one cabbage will grow in one square foot of ground, how many cabbages will grow in ten square feet of ground? Ten? Not at all. The answer is one. You will find {{as a matter of}} practical experience that however many cabbages <b>you</b> <b>plant</b> in a garden plot there will be only one that will really grow. This you will presently come to speak of as the cabbage. Beside it all the others (till the caterpillars finally finish their existence) will look but poor, lean things. But the cabbage will be a source of pride and an object of display to visitors; in fact it would ultimately have grown to be a real cabbage, such as you buy for ten cents at any market, were it not that you inevitably cut it and eat it when it is still only half-grown.|$|E

As if in the same soil <b>you</b> <b>plant</b> nightshade and a myrtle tree, they will each appropriate the mould, moisture, and air administered, for the fostering their several properties--so did my grief find sustenance, and power of existence, and growth, in what else had been divine manna, to feed radiant meditation. Ah! while I streak this paper with the tale of what my so named occupations were--while I shape the skeleton of my days--my hand trembles--my heart pants, and my brain refuses to lend expression, or phrase, or idea, by which to image forth the veil of unutterable woe that clothed these bare realities. O, worn and beating heart, may I dissect thy fibres, and tell how in each unmitigable misery, sadness dire, repinings, and despair, existed? May I record my many ravings--the wild curses I hurled at torturing nature--and how I have passed days shut out from light and food--from all except the burning hell alive in my own bosom? ...|$|E

6000|$|Bio-geology, then, {{begins with}} asking every plant or animal you meet, large or small, not merely--What is your name? That is the {{collector}} and classifier's duty; and a most necessary duty it is, {{and one to}} be performed with the most conscientious patience and accuracy, so that a sound foundation may be built for future speculations. But young naturalists should act not merely as Nature's registrars and census-takers, but as her policemen and gamekeepers; and ask everything they meet--How did you get here? By what road did you come? What was your last place of abode? And now you are here, {{how do you get}} your living? Are you and your children thriving, like decent people who can take care of themselves, or growing pauperised and degraded, and dying out? Not that we have a fear of your becoming a dangerous class. Madam Nature allows no dangerous classes, in the modern sense. She has, doubtless for some wise reason, no mercy for the weak. She rewards each organism according to its works; and if anything grows too weak or stupid to take care of itself, she gives it its due deserts by letting it die and disappear. So, <b>you</b> <b>plant</b> or you animal, are you among the strong, the successful, the multiplying, the colonising? Or are you among the weak, the failing, the dwindling, the doomed? ...|$|E
6000|$|Now {{what does}} all this mean? It means that the life of our souls is in some respects like the life of a plant; and, therefore, that as plants grow, so our souls are to grow. Why do <b>you</b> <b>plant</b> anything, but in order that it may GROW and become larger, stronger, bear flower and fruit? Be sure God has planted us in His garden, Christ's Church, for no other reason. Consider, again--What is life but a continual growing, or a continual decaying? If a tree does not get larger and stronger, year by year, is not that a sure sign that it is unhealthy, and that decay has begun in it, that it is unsound at heart? And what happens then? It begins to become weaker and smaller, and cankered and choked with scurf and moss till it dies. If a tree is not growing, it is sure in the long run to be dying; and so are our souls. If they are not growing they are dying; if they are not getting better they are getting worse. This is why the Bible compares our souls to trees--not out of a mere pretty fancy of poetry, but for a great, awful, deep, world-wide lesson, that every tree in the fields may be a pattern, a warning, to us thoughtless men, that as that tree is meant to grow, so our souls are meant to grow. As that tree dies unless it grows, so our souls must die unless they grow. Consider that! ...|$|E
6000|$|Before I {{finished}} my house, wishing to earn {{ten or twelve}} dollars by some honest and agreeable method, {{in order to meet}} my unusual expenses, I planted about two acres and a half of light and sandy soil near it chiefly with beans, but also a small part with potatoes, corn, peas, and turnips. The whole lot contains eleven acres, mostly growing up to pines and hickories, and was sold the preceding season for eight dollars and eight cents an acre. One farmer said that it was [...] "good for nothing but to raise cheeping squirrels on." [...] I put no manure whatever on this land, not being the owner, but merely a squatter, and not expecting to cultivate so much again, and I did not quite hoe it all once. I got out several cords of stumps in plowing, which supplied me with fuel for a long time, and left small circles of virgin mould, easily distinguishable through the summer by the greater luxuriance of the beans there. The dead {{and for the most part}} unmerchantable wood behind my house, and the driftwood from the pond, have supplied the remainder of my fuel. I was obliged to hire a team and a man for the plowing, though I held the plow myself. My farm outgoes for the first season were, for implements, seed, work, etc., $14.72-1/2. The seed corn was given me. This never costs anything to speak of, unless <b>you</b> <b>plant</b> more than enough.
