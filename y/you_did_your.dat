The first all-women expedition reached the South Pole in 1993. Diana Patterson, {{the first female}} station leader on Antarctica, saw a change happening in 1995.

2500|$|Indeed, Mailer was outspoken {{about his}} mistrust of {{politics}} in general {{as a way of}} meaningful change in America. [...] In Miami and the Siege of Chicago (1968) he explained his view of [...] "politics-as-property" [...] where he likened politicians to property holders who are [...] "never ambivalent about his land, he does not mock it or see other adjacent estates as more deserving than his own". [...] Thus politics is just people trading their influence as capital in an attempt to serve their own interests. [...] This cynical view of politicians serving only themselves perhaps explains his views on Watergate. [...] Mailer saw politics as a sporting event: [...] "If you played for a team, <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>your</b> best to play very well, but there was something obscene… with in starting to think there was more moral worth to Michigan than Ohio State." [...] Mailer thought that Nixon lost and was demonized only because he played for the wrong team. [...] President Johnson on the other hand, Mailer thought, was just as bad as Nixon had been, but he had had good charisma so all was forgiven.|$|E
