40|$|Provides an {{overview}} of age-related changes in both involuntary and voluntary attention in adult Ss as manifested in scalp-recorded event related potential (ERP) s. A decline in orienting with old age was inferred from a substantial reduction with age in the magnitude of deviance-related ERP components. A review of focused attention studies suggested that old and <b>young</b> <b>Ss</b> do not differ substantially {{in the quality of}} attentional operations. In old Ss early selection processes, as reflected in their selection potentials, have a somewhat slower onset than in <b>young</b> <b>Ss,</b> especially in conditions in which selection is based upon complex discrimination of stimulus features. Furthermore, the global pattern emerging from visual and memory search studies is that search-related negativities in the ERPs are smaller and of longer duration in old than in <b>young</b> <b>Ss</b> over the central and anterior scalp sites. These effects could indicate that controlled search is less intense or takes more time per search operation in old than in <b>young</b> <b>Ss.</b> At more posterior scalp sites there was tendency towards an enhanced search-related negativity that could reflect a specific difficulty of old Ss in spatially locating targets in complex visual fields...|$|R

In the FA task, performance of older Ss showed greater interference by incompatible flankers than did that of <b>younger</b> <b>Ss</b> because of stronger response competition caused by partial activation of the incorrect response channel by the incompatible flankers.

40|$|We tested two hypotheses, {{first that}} {{exercise}} training reverses age-related decrements in endothelium-dependent dilation in soleus muscle feed arteries and second that this improved endothelium-dependent dilation {{is the result}} of increased nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability due to increased content and phosphorylation of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) and/or increased antioxidant enzyme content. Young (2 mo) and old (22 mo) male Fischer 344 rats were exercise trained (Ex) or remained sedentary (Sed) for 10 – 12 wk, yielding four groups of rats: 1) <b>young</b> <b>Sed</b> (4 – 5 mo), 2) young Ex (4 – 5 mo), 3) old Sed (24 – 25 mo), and 4) old Ex (24 – 25 mo). Soleus muscle feed arteries (SFA) were isolated and cannulated with two glass micropipettes for examination of endothelium-dependent (ACh) and endothelium-independent [sodium nitroprusside (SNP) ] vasodilator function. To determine the mechanism(s) by which exercise affected dilator responses, ACh-induced dilation was assessed in the presence of Nω-nitro-l-arginine (l-NNA; to inhibit NO synthase), indomethacin (Indo; to inhibit cyclooxygenase), and l-NNA + Indo. Results indicated that ACh-induced dilation was blunted in old Sed SFA relative to <b>young</b> <b>Sed</b> SFA. Exercise training improved ACh-induced dilation in old SFA such that vasodilator responses in old Ex SFA were similar to <b>young</b> <b>Sed</b> and <b>young</b> Ex SFA. Addition of l-NNA, or l-NNA + Indo, abolished the exercise effect. Immunoblot analysis revealed that extracellular superoxide dismutase (SOD) protein content was increased by training in old SFA, whereas eNOS and SOD- 1 protein content were not altered. Addition of exogenous SOD, or SOD + catalase, improved ACh-induced dilation in old Sed SFA such that vasodilator responses were similar to <b>young</b> <b>Sed</b> SFA. Addition of l-NNA abolished the effect of exogenous SOD in old Sed arteries. Collectively, these results indicate that exercise training reverses age-induced endothelial dysfunction in SFA by increasing NO bioavailability and that increases in vascular antioxidant capacity may play an integral role in the improvement in endothelial function...|$|R

40|$|There were no {{differences}} in processing found between 24 young (aged 18 - 24 yrs) and 24 old (aged 65 - 75 yrs) adults in a combined visual selection and memory search paradigm. Data suggest that old Ss achieved relatively fast reaction times (RTs) in the task {{at the cost of}} a high error percentage. These findings, and the morphology of event-related potentials (ERPs), suggest that old Ss performed the task more superficially than did <b>young</b> <b>Ss.</b> In both old and <b>young</b> <b>Ss,</b> high memory load was associated with decreased positivity in the P 3 and slow wave ERP components. This finding is interpreted in terms of the concept of search negativity.
