500|$|According to Coldplay's {{lead singer}} Chris Martin, the song's writing was {{inspired}} by his own behaviour. Martin recalls, [...] "There were some bad things going in our band... the song is about behaving badly towards somebody <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>love</b> and I was certainly doing that to {{some members of the}} band." [...] He added that he supposed it was about time to stop acting like a knobhead. The four members of Coldplay are credited as co-writers of [...] "Trouble".|$|E
500|$|Hawke has {{repeatedly}} denounced what he perceives {{to be an}} overemphasis placed {{on the importance of}} monogamy in romantic relationships: [...] "People have such a childish view of monogamy and fidelity. 'He's cheated so he's bad, she's cheated so she's bad', as opposed to a recognition that our species is not monogamous...Sexual fidelity can't be the whole thing you hang your relationship on. If <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>love</b> somebody you want them to grow, but you don't get to define how that happens. They do." ...|$|E
500|$|Dave McKean drew {{most of the}} {{principal}} art, {{as well as the}} cover art of the graphic novel. In illustrating the story, McKean blends paintings, drawings, photography, and mixed-media collage to come up with striking page designs, and dense symbols. He has said that he was [...] "trying to make the book despite the subject, rather than because of it. At the end of the day, if <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>love</b> to do Batman comics, then that's probably the best thing to do. Not liking them, and then trying to make something out of them is just a waste of time." [...] He also came to think that [...] "overpainted, lavish illustrations in every panel just didn't work. It hampers the storytelling." [...] McKean liberally uses symbolism, imagery, and surrealism, and many scenes involve the use of symbols to denote a particular psychological device. For example, a Greek inscription can be seen scratched on the doorway of Maxie Zeus's electroshock chamber, which translates into [...] "Discover thyself." [...] Much of this symbolism was later explained and expanded upon by the release of the 15th Anniversary Edition containing Morrison's annotated script.|$|E

2500|$|At this point, Woodson officially {{joined the}} group, taking Edwards' place. Woodson's first lead {{on a single}} was 1984's [...] "Treat Her Like a Lady", co-written by himself and Otis Williams, and co-produced by former Earth, Wind & Fire members Al McKay and Ralph Johnson. The single became their biggest success on R radio since 1975, {{reaching}} number-two on the R charts, and just missing the Pop Top 40 at number 48. The group enjoyed further successes with 1985's [...] "Do <b>You</b> <b>Really</b> <b>Love</b> Your Baby," [...] a number 14 R hit co-written by soul star Luther Vandross, and 1986's [...] "Lady Soul," [...] the group's third and final Top 10 R hit of the decade.|$|E
2500|$|According to Rajneesh, one has {{no right}} to knowingly inflict a {{lifetime}} of suffering: life should begin only at birth, and even then, [...] "If a child is born deaf, dumb, and we cannot do anything, and the parents are willing, the child should be put to eternal sleep" [...] rather than [...] "take the risk of burdening the earth with a crippled, blind child." [...] He argued that this simply freed the soul to inhabit a healthy body instead: [...] "Only the body goes back into its basic elements; the soul will fly into another womb. Nothing is destroyed. If <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>love</b> the child, you will not want him to live a seventy-year-long life in misery, suffering, sickness, old age. So even if a child is born, if he is not medically capable of enjoying life fully with all the senses, healthy, then it is better that he goes to eternal sleep and is born somewhere else with a better body." ...|$|E

2500|$|Unlike the {{previous}} albums where the band felt their lyrics were obtuse {{they wanted to}} be direct with the song meaning and based the song's lyrics on love and their relationships. Taylor described [...] "Alley Cats" [...] as one of Goddard's more private songs and speculated that the song seemed [...] "to partly be about his mother and wishing that she was alive to hear this song that he's singing". Taylor stated that the words of the chorus [...] "relate to when you're feeling something that <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>love</b> is coming to an end, and saying that's not really possible". The song [...] "I Feel Better" [...] was described by Taylor as a song [...] "trying to reach a kind of positive conclusion and positive state of mind whilst also trying to think about the terrible state the world is in". Doyle explained that the lyrics were about [...] "the malaise of living in a world where there's climate change and finding solace in the arms of your partner".|$|E
2500|$|Prescott {{stated that}} on Two Eleven, Norwood's vocals {{return to a}} multi-layered style like those present on {{previous}} songs [...] "Angel in Disguise", [...] "Full Moon" [...] and [...] "Afrodisiac". These are present on another ballad on Two Eleven called [...] "Without You", which was originally crafted for singer Alicia Keys. Initially tipped by Norwood as an early contender for {{the second or third}} single, Billboards Andrew Hamp said [...] "Without You" [...] showcases Norwood's [...] "strong vocals" [...] with a [...] "confident" [...] attitude. It drew comparisons to [...] "Enough of No Love" [...] by Keyshia Cole, both Cole's song and Norwood's song were produced by Harmony Samuels. Touching on similar subject, [...] "No Such Thing As too Late" [...] sees Norwood talking about the emotions of a new relationship. Lyrics include the line [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>love</b> somebody / you can wait / 'cause there's no such thing as too late." [...] This goes hand-in-hand with another song [...] "Hardly Breathing", where Norwood speaks of the anguish of having her partner leave. Both of the songs were written and produced by Jim Jonsin and Rico Love.|$|E
