Studley in {{particular}} reasoned: [...] "If I have {{the presence of}} mind to stand here between you and the fire, which is right behind me, <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{the presence of mind}} to go out quietly." [...] Kate Claxton echoed J. B. Studley's line, and stage manager J. W. Thorpe appeared, also urging an orderly exit. But the audience was now thoroughly panicked and ignored the people on the stage.|$|E
2500|$|Manohar, who {{has always}} had a clean image as an administrator, tore apart Srinivasan in an {{interview}} to the tabloid Mumbai Mirror on 3 October 2013. He said that as N. Srinivasan was responsible for the mess in BCCI, he shouldn't be BCCI president any more. He further said [...] "Srinivasan has no right to continue as president. If you had the slightest of conscience, self-esteem and care for the board, <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> put in your papers the moment your son-in-law (Gurunath Meiyappan) was arrested ...|$|E

But <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> regarded an order from the Apostolic See as not less weighty than one from the emperor. ...The government of souls, which belongs to bishops, is more important than the imperial, which is only concerned with the temporal. Your assertion that I have only come to blindly excommunicate is shameless, and your offer to give me an honourable reception if I should have come exactly in the way the emperor wanted me to is contemptuous. With regards to the oaths I have taken to the emperor, I will avoid perjury by pointing out to the emperor what he has done against the unity and peace of the Church and his kingdom. With regards to the bishops, in opposing my efforts in behalf of peace, what they threaten has not been done, from the beginning of the Church.” ...|$|E

2500|$|... ”You say: ‘We worship {{stones and}} walls and boards.’ But {{it is not}} so, O Emperor; but they serve us for remembrance and encouragement, lifting our slow spirits upwards, by those whose names the {{pictures}} bear and whose representations they are. And we worship them not as God, as you maintain, God forbid!... Even the little children mock at you. Go into one of their schools, {{say that you are}} the enemy of images, and straightway they will throw their little tablets at your head, and what you have failed to learn from the wise you may pick up from the foolish... In virtue of the power which has come down to us from St. Peter, the Prince of the Apostles, we might inflict a punishment upon you, but since you have invoked one on yourself, have that, you and the counsellors you have chosen... though you have so excellent a high priest, our brother Germanus, whom <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> taken into your counsels as father and teacher[...] [...] [...] The dogmas of the Church are not a matter for the emperor, but for the bishops.” ...|$|E
