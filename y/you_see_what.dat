Telotte, writing in the book Science Fiction Film, credited the film with exploring the theme of political corruption.|$|E
500|$|In August, {{the band}} {{announced}} {{the recording of}} its fourteenth album with producer Johnny K. At the start of 2013, Megadeth left Roadrunner Records for Mustaine's newly founded label, Tradecraft, distributed through Universal Music Group. The album, Super Collider, was released in June and debuted at number six on the Billboard 200, the band's highest chart position since 1994's Youthanasia. Critical reaction to the album, however, was largely negative. Shortly {{after the release of}} Super Collider, Mustaine stated that he had already started thinking about a fifteenth Megadeth album. He said this had been spurred by the death of Slayer guitarist Jeff Hanneman, which gave him a sense of mortality. Mustaine elaborated: [...] "You know, time is short. Nobody knows how long they're gonna live. <b>You</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> happened with Jeff Hanneman, so I wanna write as much as I can while I can." ...|$|E

500|$|... "I Will Be" [...] is a {{piano and}} guitar led song, which lasts for a {{duration}} of 3 minutes, 58 seconds. The song was composed {{in the key}} of G major using common time and a slow groove at 72beats per minute. Lewis's vocal range spans two octaves, from the low note of B3 to the high note of B5, on the song. The song opens with the lyrics [...] "There's nothing I could say to you, nothing I could ever do to make <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> you mean to me." [...] Chad Grischow for IGN described the song's piano led instrumental to be [...] "overblown", but noted that Lewis has enough [...] "vocal strength to prevent her from being overshadowed by the drowningly lush sound." [...] Eric R. Danton wrote on his review of Spirit for the Hartford Courant daily that [...] "I Will Be" [...] begins with a [...] "spare piano introduction" [...] that [...] "blossoms into an arrangement buoyed by strings and then drums and guitar". Danton described Lewis's vocals as [...] "delicate" [...] and that [...] "take flight on the chorus".|$|E
500|$|A Kryptonian {{general and}} {{megalomaniac}} {{with the same}} superpowers as Superman, bent on transforming Earth into a new Krypton under his reign. Viggo Mortensen was considered for the role. Snyder stated, [...] "Zod is not only one of Superman's most formidable enemies, {{but one of the}} most significant because he has insights into Superman that others don't. Michael is a powerful actor who can project both the intelligence and the malice of the character, making him perfect for the role." [...] When Goyer was asked about why Zod was chosen as the villain, he stated, [...] "The way (Christopher) Nolan and I have always approached movies as well is you never say, 'Hey, which villain would be cool for this movie?' You start with the story first. What kind of story? What kind of theme do you want to tell? So we worked that out. Then, usually the villain becomes obvious in terms of who's going to be the appropriate antagonist for that. When you guys see the movie, the only villain we could've used was Zod and the Kryptonians. I mean, when <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> the whole story is, nothing else would have even made sense." [...] Shannon also commented on his portrayal in comparison to Terence Stamp's original take on Zod, [...] "To follow Terence Stamp's iconic performance in the original, it is daunting, but I just focused on one day at a time. It's interesting that when we started with this, we did a lot of training together and I think that kind of helped loosen things up a little bit. It is a very physical movie at the end of the day. That's a good way to find your way 'into it' [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|Strong {{explained}} in Desperate Housewives: Behind Closed Doors {{that she believed}} {{there to be a}} [...] "conceptual shift" [...] after the filming of the original pilot with Lee, and [...] "they realized they needed something different", stating: [...] "There certainly wasn't something wrong with what [...] did. It was just that instead of vanilla they wanted chocolate, and I happened to be chocolate. When I walked in to audition, Marc Cherry was so sweet. He said, 'I hope you don't mind, but I'm going to close my eyes, because I really want to hear how you sound.' When I was done with the audition, {{he opened his eyes and}} this angelic smile crept across his face, and I thought, 'Oh, good. Something went right.'" [...] The actress also explained that she watched the pilot filmed with Lee and while that was helpful for her own portrayal, she saw that what she had to offer for the role was different, saying: [...] "It's a little strange when you watch someone else in a role you're auditioning for because his or her performance lives in your mind. It can be hard to distinguish yourself sometimes, but I had fun with it." [...] Scenes featuring Lee were refilmed with Strong as her replacement. Strong stated years later that her role and narration as Mary Alice led to her voice becoming significantly recognizable, explaining in a 2012 interview with Entertainment Weekly that fans of the series would recognize her in coffee shops solely by her voice. The actress served as the narrator of almost every episode of the series, with the exceptions of the third season episode [...] "My Husband, the Pig" [...] (in which Steven Culp narrates the episode as the deceased Rex Van de Kamp) and the fifth season episode [...] "Look Into Their Eyes and <b>You</b> <b>See</b> <b>What</b> They Know" [...] (in which Nicollette Sheridan narrates the episode as the deceased Edie Britt).|$|E

2500|$|Although {{the details}} {{have not been}} {{precisely}} established, casualty figures were high for both sides: the French amounting to at least 7,000 killed and wounded; the allies are estimated as 10,000 to 12,000. This casualty rate was the highest in western Europe since the Battle of Malplaquet in 1709 during the War of the Spanish Succession in the reign of Louis XIV, where, as a 13 year old boy, Saxe personally witnessed the carnage.
