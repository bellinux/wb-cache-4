500|$|Although Mitchell's defense {{attorney}} argued that Jones' injuries were inconsistent with {{those found in}} Manson's paintings, Lord Nimmo Smith said during sentencing that he did [...] "not feel able {{to ignore the fact}} that there was a degree of resemblance between the injuries inflicted on Jodi and those shown in the Marilyn Manson paintings of Elizabeth Short that we saw. I think that you carried an image of the paintings in <b>your</b> <b>memory</b> when you killed Jodi." [...] Mitchell was found guilty of murder and sentenced to serve a minimum of twenty years in prison. Manson later dismissed claims that his work inspired the murder, arguing instead that [...] "the education that parents give their children and the influences they receive" [...] plays a more direct role in violent behavior, and criticised media who attempted to [...] " [...] the blame elsewhere." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Animal" [...] {{received}} {{a positive response}} from music critics. Natalie Kaye of Contactmusic.com {{described it as a}} [...] "solid pop song", before adding that the [...] "infectious" [...] chorus is [...] "irrefutably something you'll end up whistling in the shower". Similarly, Ian Wade of BBC Music commented that it [...] "takes approximately one play for its catchiness to cluster bomb <b>your</b> <b>memory</b> bank", and John Bergstrom of PopMatters called it [...] "sharp, catchy pure pop" [...] with a chorus that [...] "charm [...] way into your brain". Rudy Klapper of Sputnikmusic commended lead singer Wyatt's [...] "chameleonic" [...] vocals, calling them [...] "a highlight from the beginning". Klapper concluded, [...] " [...] bounc along a deceptively catchy progression to a jangly chorus that hits immediate pop pay dirt." [...] Neil Ashman of Drowned in Sound commented that it [...] "boasts a number of indelible hooks worked around its staccato synth blasts".|$|E

500|$|The song {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. About.com writer Bill Lamb rated [...] "Come Back to Me" [...] {{three and a}} half stars out of five; he praised its pop sound and Hudgens' [...] "engaging personality", but criticized it for having a manufactured sound from the [...] "Disney pop factory". Moreover, Lamb wrote: [...] "'Come Back to Me' is unlikely to linger too long in <b>your</b> <b>memory,</b> but it also fails to generate any annoying after taste. Program it into your listening when you need a contemporary, breezy, light pop confection... Sure, you are being manipulated by the corporate music establishment, but the song is fun." [...] He also noted that the [...] "Baby Come Back" [...] sample was possibly added to [...] "trigger pleasant deja vu in parents listening along with their kids". In an editorial review for Rhapsody, Nick Cavalieri named the song one of the best tracks on V.|$|E
500|$|Troy Patterson of Slate drew {{comparisons}} to the HBO comedy-drama Sex and the City, and affirmed that it introduced a lewd and cynical {{perspective of the}} so-called [...] "golden age" [...] of advertisement. Nancy Franklin of The New Yorker concluded that [...] "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes" [...] was [...] "smart and tremendously attractive", while Seattle Post-Intelligencer journalist Melanie McFarland {{felt that it was}} a rarity compared to other television installments. Writing for the Boston Globe, Matthew Gilbert remarked that the setting and design were immediately distinguishable. Gilbert wrote, [...] "This is a gorgeously fashioned period piece, from its IBM typewriters and rotary phones to the constant fog of cigarette smoke hanging over every scene. The show has a subtle color palette, to match the ivory metal Venetian blinds at the Sterling Cooper ad agency offices, but it may sit in <b>your</b> <b>memory</b> {{as if it had been}} filmed in black and white." [...] Citing its authenticity as an episode highlight, Randy Cordova from the Arizona Republic noted that [...] "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes" [...] was well-constructed.|$|E
500|$|Atkins's thirteenth single, [...] "It's America", was {{released}} in November 2008. It was the first single from his third album, It's America, released in March 2009. Atkins promoted the album through appearances on Larry King Live and a pre-sale promotion on his website. On the chart dated May 2, 2009, [...] "It's America" [...] became his fifth number 1 hit. Its followup, [...] "15 Minutes", {{was released}} in May 2009 and peaked at number 20 in September. Atkins re-wrote the album's third single, [...] "Chasin' Girls", for his wife {{to make it more}} applicable to their life at the time. After executives at Curb saw the lyrics, the re-written version was released as the album's third single, but did not make top 40. [...] "Farmer's Daughter" [...] followed in early 2010, and after it reached top 5 late in the year, Curb added it and the re-recording of [...] "Chasin' Girls" [...] to a re-issue of It's America. The label also re-released If You're Going Through Hell for exclusive sale at Cracker Barrel restaurants, with [...] "Farmer's Daughter" [...] and the previously-unreleased song [...] "More Like <b>Your</b> <b>Memory</b> (Always Takes Me Back)" [...] added to the track listing.|$|E

500|$|Charles Eaton died in Frankston on 12November 1979. Survived by {{his wife}} and two sons, he was cremated. In {{accordance}} with his wishes, his ashes were scattered near Tennant Creek, site of his 1929 forced landing during the search for the Kookaburra, from an RAAF Caribou on 15April 1981. His name figures prominently in the Northern Territory, commemorated by Lake Eaton in Central Australia, Eaton Place in the Darwin suburb of Karama, Charles Eaton Drive on the approach to Darwin International Airport, and the Charles Moth Eaton Saloon Bar in the Tennant Creek Goldfields Hotel. He is also honoured with a display at the Northern Territory Parliament, and a National Trust memorial at Tennant Creek Airport. At the RAAF's 2003 History Conference, Air Commodore Mark Lax, recalling Eaton's search-and-rescue missions between the wars, commented: [...] "Today, we might think of Eaton perhaps as the pioneer of our contribution to assistance to the civil community—a tradition that continues today. Perhaps I might jog <b>your</b> <b>memory</b> to a more recent series of rescues no less hazardous for all concerned—the amazing location of missing yachtsmen Thierry Dubois, Isabelle Autissier and Tony Bullimore by our P-3s that guided the Navy to their eventual rescue. My observation is that such activities remain vital for our relevance in that we must remain connected, supportive and responsive to the wants and needs of the Australian community." ...|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from television critics. Dave Foster of DVD Times said that [...] "Homer the Smithers" [...] shows [...] "just how dependent upon Smithers Mr. Burns is". He {{added that the}} staging and animation of the scene in which Homer tries to apologize to Burns [...] "will remain engraved in <b>your</b> <b>memory</b> {{in the same way}} as some of the series finest dialogue can". DVD Movie Guides Colin Jacobson enjoyed the episode and commented that [...] "any doubts about Smithers' sexuality will not last long when we see his vacation". Jacobson would have liked to see more scenes from Smithers' vacation, but he still thought the episode offered [...] "nice exposition" [...] for the character. He added: [...] "It’s fun to see more about his pampering of Burns, and it’s amusing to watch Homer take over for him." [...] Jennifer Malkowski of DVD Verdict considered the best part of the episode to be the scenes of Smithers on vacation. She concluded her review by giving the episode a grade of A. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called it a [...] "very good episode, and an unusually straightforward one for this surreal season".|$|E
500|$|... "Can't Get You Out of My Head" [...] was jointly written, composed, and {{produced}} by Cathy Dennis and Rob Davis. Dennis and Davis {{had been brought}} together by British artist manager Simon Fuller, who wanted the duo {{to come up with}} a song for British pop group S Club 7. The song was recorded using Cubase music software, which Davis ran on his Mac computer. Davis began playing an acoustic guitar and ran a 125 beats per minute drum loop, on which Dennis, herself a singer who had enjoyed chart success in the United States, began singing the line [...] "I just can't get you out of my head" [...] in the key of D minor. After three and a half hours, the demo was recorded and the vocals were laid afterwards. Dennis called their recording setup for the song [...] "the most primitive set-up you could imagine! Different producers work in different ways. But it's good to be reminded you don’t have to be reliant on equipment. A song is about melody and lyrics and being able to take something away in <b>your</b> <b>memory</b> that is going to haunt you." [...] She also regarded their production as a [...] "very natural and fluid process," [...] saying: [...] "We know how hard we work sometimes to write songs and then spend months picking them to pieces, but this was the easiest process, the chemicals were all happy and working together." ...|$|E

500|$|The glamorous {{world of}} Hollywood also {{reflected}} in her writing, especially in the second track of the same name. Describing it as a metaphor, Madonna said that [...] "in Hollywood you can lose <b>your</b> <b>memory</b> and your vision of the future. You can lose everything because you can lose yourself." [...] The beginning of the album cleared away what was not important for her, so Madonna could concentrate {{on the things that}} did matter. So, in contrast to the first three tracks, the later songs on American Life also deal with issues close to the singer's heart, like talking about her relationship with her parents on the track [...] "Mother and Father". When Madonna was five, her mother died of breast cancer and the track was [...] "a way of letting go of the sadness and moving on." [...] According to Lucy O'Brien, author of , another concept of American Life was about [...] "nothingness". This was evident in the titles of the songs like [...] "Nobody Knows Me", usage of [...] "no" [...] in [...] "Love Profusion", as well as [...] "Nothing Fails". Usage of the negative tone led Madonna to be sarcastic on people's assumptions about her and emphasize about her knowledge of romantic love. But [...] "Nothing Fails", along with tracks [...] "Intervention" [...] and [...] "X-Static Process," [...] became the centerpiece of the album as a triptych of love songs for Ritchie. Beginning as a humble track that musician-producer Guy Sigsworth wrote for his wife, [...] "Nothing Fails" [...] also has lyrics by singer Jem Archer, who was asked to collaborate with Sigsworth and Madonna during the first collaborative sessions of American Life. The track is followed by the folk-inspired [...] "Intervention" [...] and [...] "X-Static Process," [...] both being reflective and emotional. Her reflective mood continued with the last track [...] "Easy Ride," [...] which was inspired by the imagery of a full-circle and symbolized life for the singer.|$|E

2500|$|Involuntary {{semantic}} memory retrieval (ISM), or [...] "semantic-popping", {{occurs in the}} same fashion as IAM retrieval. However, the elicited memory is devoid of personal grounding and often considered trivial, such as a random word, image, or phrase. ISM retrieval can occur as a result of spreading activation, where words, thoughts, and concepts activate related semantic memories continually. When enough related memories are primed that an interrelated concept, word, thought, or image [...] "pops" [...] into consciousness and you are unaware of the extent of its relatedness within <b>your</b> <b>memory.</b> Spreading activation is thought to build over a period of many hours, days, or even weeks before a random {{semantic memory}} [...] "pops".|$|E
2500|$|The Ardas {{is usually}} always done {{standing}} up with folded hands. The {{beginning of the}} Ardas is strictly set by the tenth Sikh Guru, Guru Gobind Singh.
