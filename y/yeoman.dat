5|$|The Smuts {{family were}} prosperous <b>yeoman</b> farmers, {{long-established}} in the area. For four generations, since 1786, they had farmed in the Malmesbury district, settling {{on the farm}} Ongegund, of which Bovenplaats was a part, in 1818. This area {{was part of the}} so-called Swartland, the chief wheat-growing area of the Cape Colony.|$|E
5|$|Hall i' th' Wood, now a museum, is a late mediaeval <b>yeoman</b> farmer's {{house built}} by Laurence Brownlow. Around 1637 it {{was owned by}} the Norris family, who added the stone west wing. In the 18th century it was divided up into tenements. Samuel Crompton lived and worked there. In the 19th century it {{deteriorated}} further until in 1895 it was bought by industrialist William Hesketh Lever, who restored it and presented it to Bolton Council in 1900.|$|E
50|$|Duckham {{married a}} widow, Mrs. Anne <b>Yeomans,</b> in 1845. Anne <b>Yeomans</b> (née Morgan) had first {{been married to}} John <b>Yeomans</b> (1803-1842) of Moreton, another noted breeder of Hereford cattle, and whose family {{features}} strongly {{in the history of}} the Hereford breed. He was the son of Richard <b>Yeomans</b> (1767-1833) and grandson of John <b>Yeomans</b> (1736-1798) of Howton Court. Anne Duckham, late <b>Yeomans</b> née Morgan, died in 1894. She was the mother of Thomas Duckham's daughter, Ellen.|$|R

50|$|Although the <b>Yeomen</b> Warders {{are often}} {{referred}} to as <b>Yeomen</b> of the Guard, which is a distinct corps of Royal Bodyguards of the British monarch, they are in fact a separate entity within this guard. Gilbert and Sullivan's opera, The <b>Yeomen</b> of the Guard (1888), is set in the 16th century, an earlier era before the two corps were split apart; it concerns what are today the <b>Yeomen</b> Warders.|$|R
5|$|Other {{cast members}} {{included}} Paul Carr as Navigator Lee Kelso, Lloyd Haynes as Communications Officer Alden and Andrea Dromm as <b>Yeoman</b> Smith (Alden and Smith {{were intended to}} be regulars in the show, but were replaced by Uhura and Janice Rand, respectively). The episode also {{is the first time}} long-running background actor Eddie Paskey appeared; his character would later be identified as Lt. Leslie.|$|E
5|$|Robert Peel (1723– 12 September 1795), {{commonly}} known as Parsley Peel, was an influential cotton mill owner and grandfather to Sir Robert Peel, 2nd Baronet, future prime minister of Great Britain. Peel started life as a <b>yeoman</b> farmer but experimented with calico printing, eventually creating a parsley leaf pattern which would become his trademark. Despite losing a number of machines during riots, Peel's company became {{the largest in the}} textile sector by the time of his death, with 23 factories.|$|E
5|$|The Indian Head cent {{was struck}} in large {{quantities}} and most dates remain inexpensive: <b>Yeoman</b> lists all dates from 1900 to 1908 from Philadelphia at $2 in Good-4 condition. The record holder for the denomination is a proof specimen of the 1864-L, of which there were an estimated 20 struck; it sold for $161,000 in 2012.|$|E

5|$|The oldest {{surviving}} {{building in}} Sale is Eyebrow Cottage. Built around 1670, {{it was originally}} a <b>yeoman</b> farmhouse {{and is one of}} the earliest brick buildings in the area. Its name is derived from the decorative brickwork above the windows. It was built in Cross Street, which at the time was a separate village from Sale. Of the twenty-one conservation areas in Trafford, two are in Sale: Ashton upon Mersey and Brogden Grove.|$|E
5|$|<b>Yeoman</b> lists all three-cent pieces before 1863 at $40 in worn G-4 condition, {{except the}} 1851 through 1853 at Philadelphia ($25). All three-cent pieces from 1863 to 1872 are less {{valuable}} in proof than in uncirculated MS-63 condition. Much of the mintage of later dates were melted by the Mint {{after the end}} of the series.|$|E
5|$|Aside from Parliamentary and {{business}} commitments, {{he served as}} a Deputy Lieutenant for Lincolnshire and a Justice of the Peace. Boucherett was also an officer in the <b>Yeoman</b> volunteers, being a Captain the Market Raisin Yeomanry in 1798 and then a Lieutenant-Colonel in and Commandant of the North Lincolnshire Yeomanry from 1814 until his death. He died in a carriage accident on 15 September 1815. At his death, his assets barely covered the debts he had accrued in his lifetime. He was succeeded as the High Steward of Grimsby by the Hon. George Anderson Pelham, the second son of the first Lord Yarborough.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Yeomans</b> was re-elected in the 1998 {{municipal}} election under unusual circumstances. His only opponent was Jan Eisenhardt, a 92-year-old widower who initially justified his candidacy {{on the grounds}} that he wanted <b>Yeomans</b> [...] "to know the thrill of victory" [...] rather than receiving [...] "just another acclamation." [...] Eisenhardt added that his bid was healthy for democracy and that he would decline to serve if elected. <b>Yeomans</b> tried to persuade Eisenhardt to withdraw, indicating that a contested election would cost the city at least $30,000, but Eisenhardt insisted on running. <b>Yeomans</b> subsequently described the election as [...] "ridiculous and unnecessary" [...] while the Montreal Gazette described it as [...] "bizarre." [...] The initially friendly nature of Eisenhardt's challenge turned to bitterness in mid-campaign, after <b>Yeomans</b> was alleged to have made critical remarks about his challenger's physical aptitude for the position. To no-one's surprise, <b>Yeomans</b> was returned without difficulty, winning with 81 per cent support.|$|R
50|$|He {{was born}} in Halifax, the son of Henry <b>Yeomans.</b> <b>Yeomans</b> {{was elected to the}} provincial {{assembly}} in an 1874 by-election held after William McDougall resigned his seat. He lived in Shubenacadie.|$|R

5|$|Authentic {{gardens of}} the <b>yeoman</b> cottager would have {{included}} a beehive and livestock, and frequently a pig and sty, {{along with a}} well. The peasant cottager of medieval times {{was more interested in}} meat than flowers, with herbs grown for medicinal use and cooking, rather than for their beauty. By Elizabethan times there was more prosperity, and thus more room to grow flowers. Even the early cottage garden flowers typically had their practical use—violets were spread on the floor (for their pleasant scent and keeping out vermin); calendulas and primroses were both attractive and used in cooking. Others, such as sweet william and hollyhocks were grown entirely for their beauty.|$|E
5|$|Goronwy and {{his troops}} were again summoned into the King's service to retake Berwick in 1319, after Scottish forces {{had taken it}} a year earlier. The {{majority}} of the forces from Wales came from the southern Marcher Lords, but Goronwy, Gruffudd Llwyd and Hywel ap Gruffudd ap Geruath led those from {{the northern part of}} the country. Around the same time, as a <b>yeoman</b> of the king, Goronwy was made forester of Snowdon. He remained loyal to Edward II, but following the king's death, he resumed service to Edward III.|$|E
5|$|Goronwy ap Tudur Hen (died 1331), {{also known}} as Goronwy ap Tudur or Goronwy Fychan, was a Welsh aristocrat and Lord of Penmynydd. He {{was a member of}} the Tudor family of Penmynydd, Anglesey, North Wales, and a direct {{ancestor}} of Owen Tudor and thereby the Royal House of Tudor. He was a soldier for the English crown, who fought in the First War of Scottish Independence, including in the English invasion which led to the Battle of Bannockburn. He remained loyal to King Edward II of England until the king's death, and was both a <b>yeoman</b> and forester of Snowdon. After his death in 1331, his body was interned in Llanfaes Friary, near Bangor, Gwynedd.|$|E

50|$|P. A. <b>Yeomans</b> {{published}} {{the first book}} on Keyline in 1954. <b>Yeomans</b> described a system of amplified contour ripping to control rainfall runoff and enable fast flood irrigation of undulating land {{without the need for}} terracing.|$|R
5|$|Johnson was {{the second}} son of Rebecca Turner Johnson and John Johnson, a Baptist <b>yeoman</b> who lived in Everton, Liverpool. Religious Dissent marked Johnson from the {{beginning}} of his life, as two of his mother's relatives were prominent Baptist ministers and his father was a deacon. Liverpool, at the time of Johnson's youth, was fast becoming a bustling urban centre {{and was one of the}} most important commercial ports in England. These two characteristics of his home—Dissent and commercialism—remained central elements in Johnson's character throughout his life.|$|E
5|$|On the Job was {{released}} on DVD and Blu-ray on February 18, 2014, courtesy of Well Go USA. Special features include making-of footage, deleted scenes, and film trailers of Special ID, Confession of Murder, and Commitment (all in 2013). Justin Remer of DVD Talk praised both the Blu-ray's video and audio transfers while generally criticizing its special features. Both Kevin <b>Yeoman</b> of High-Def Digest and Jeffrey Kauffman of Blu-ray.com scored the release 3.5/5, and offered similar commentary {{in regard to the}} transfers and special features. On the Job accumulated $167,128 video sales in North America.|$|E
5|$|At first, {{according}} to agreement, the SPARS enlisted personnel received their indoctrination training {{on college campuses}} operated for such by the U.S. Navy. In March 1943, the USCG decided to establish its own training center for the indoctrination of enlisted recruits. The site selected was the Palm Beach Biltmore Hotel, Palm Beach, Florida. Beginning in late June, all enlisted personnel received their indoctrination and specialized training there. Some 70 percent of the enlisted women who received recruit training also received some specialized training. <b>Yeoman</b> and storekeepers represented the largest share, but many SPARS were {{given the opportunity to}} train in other fields. In January 1945, the training of enlisted personnel was transferred from Palm Beach to Manhattan Beach, Brooklyn, New York.|$|E

5000|$|The Queen's Body Guard of the <b>Yeomen</b> of the Guard are a {{bodyguard}} of the British Monarch. The oldest British military corps still in existence, {{it was created}} by King Henry VII in 1485 at the Battle of Bosworth. As a token of this venerability, the <b>Yeomen</b> still wear red and gold uniforms of Tudor style. There are 60 <b>Yeomen</b> of the Guard (plus six officers), drawn from retired members of the British Army, Royal Marines and Royal Air Force, but traditionally not the Royal Navy. [...] This ban on Royal Navy Personnel was lifted in 2011 and two sailors {{joined the ranks of}} the <b>Yeomen</b> of the Guard. However, the role of the Captain of the Queen's Body Guard of the <b>Yeomen</b> of the Guard is a political appointment [...] - [...] the captain is always the government Deputy Chief Whip in the House of Lords.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Yeomen</b> Warders {{were formed}} in 1485 {{by the new}} King Henry VII, the first monarch of the Tudor dynasty; the Tudor rose, a heraldic badge of the dynasty, {{is part of the}} badge of the <b>Yeomen</b> Warders to this day.|$|R
5|$|Balchen {{was born}} in February 1670, the only {{surviving}} child of the <b>yeoman</b> gentleman, John Balchen, and his wife, Ann Edspur. Home educated, Balchen took a commission in the Royal Navy aged 15 and, seven years later, gained promotion to lieutenant. For most of this period Balchen was stationed in the West Indies and, during his service there, was lucky in his health; the West Indies command was considered very dangerous during this period, mortality rates amongst sailors stationed there being very high due to malaria and yellow fever. The high death rate led to rapid promotion for those who survived, and Balchen was made Post Captain at the relatively young age of 27 during the Nine Years' War. Balchen had spent the war aboard HMS Dragon and HMS Cambridge under Admiral John Neville, who was impressed enough with his subordinate to give him command of the prize ship HMS Virgin, the safe conduct of which to England earned him the step to captain.|$|E
5|$|From {{the first}} class of 14 June 1943, until the final class of 16 December 1944, more than 7,000 {{recruits}} were indoctrinated at the Palm Beach station. Approximately, 70 percent of the enlisted women who received recruit training also received some specialized training. <b>Yeoman</b> and storekeepers represented the largest share, but many SPARS were given the opportunity for training in other fields. Some attended other Navy schools and were trained as motion picture sound technicians, link trainer operators, parachute riggers, and air control operators. Others attended USCG schools and learned to be: cooks, bakers, radioman, pharmacist mates, radio technicians, and motor vehicle drivers. In January 1945, the training of enlisted personnel was transferred from Palm Beach to Manhattan Beach, Brooklyn, New York, the largest USCG training station for men.|$|E
5|$|Henry VI {{proved to}} be a weak king and {{vulnerable}} to the over-mighty subjects who developed private armies of retainers. Rivalries often spilled over from the courtroom into armed confrontations, such as the Percy–Neville feud. Without the common purpose of the war in France, Henry's cousin Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York, and Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, used their networks to defy the crown. Henry became the focus of discontent as the population, agricultural production, prices, the wool trade and credit declined in the Great Slump. This led to radical demands from the lower classes. In 1450, Jack Cade raised a rebellion to force Henry to address the economic problems or abdicate his throne. The uprising was suppressed but conflict remained between villagers, gentry and aristocracy. Society remained deeply unsettled and radical demands continued to be suppressed such as those from the <b>yeoman</b> brothers John and William Merfold.|$|E
50|$|The 38 <b>Yeomen</b> Warders, ex-military {{personnel}} {{employed by}} Historic Royal Palaces, also provide security, though their daytime role {{is more concerned}} with managing the large number of visitors. Unlike the soldiers of the Tower Guard, who rotate, the <b>Yeomen</b> Warders are permanent and live in the tower itself. The present body dates from 1485, and they wear similar uniforms to the Sovereign's bodyguards, the <b>Yeomen</b> of the Guard, of which they have been extraordinary members since 1550.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Yeomen</b> of the Guard {{are often}} {{confused}} with the <b>Yeomen</b> Warders of Her Majesty’s Royal Palace and Fortress the Tower of London, popularly known as [...] "Beefeaters", a similar but distinct body. Gilbert and Sullivan's operetta, The <b>Yeomen</b> of the Guard (1888), {{is set in the}} 16th century, an earlier era before the two corps were split apart; it concerns what are today the <b>Yeomen</b> Warders. Both bodies wear identical dress uniforms, consisting of a royal red tunic with purple facings and stripes and gold lace ornaments, red knee-breeches and red stockings, flat hat, and black shoes with red, white and blue rosettes. The gold-embroidered emblems on the back and front of the coats consist of the crowned Tudor Rose, the shamrock and the thistle, the motto [...] "Dieu et mon droit", and the [...] "regal" [...] initial of the reigning sovereign (currently ER for [...] "Elizabeth Regina"). However, the Guard wear a red cross-belt, which distinguishes them from the <b>Yeomen</b> Warders.|$|R
