Ranaut is particularly known for her forthrightness in expressing her opinions in public on issues ranging from film to feminism. A televised interview hosted by Anupama Chopra in which Ranaut spoke out against gender bias and nepotism in Bollywood went viral online, which led Sunaina Kumar of Tehelka to write: [...] "In this age of cookie-cutter heroines with stock responses, Kangana Ranaut is refreshingly real and honest." ...|$|E

El-Faisal tried to recruit British schoolboys for Jihad {{training}} camps, promising them [...] "seventy-two virgins in paradise" [...] if they died fighting a holy war.

Now Morris had been abandoned, fired from his job and left penniless, stricken by a heart attack and seemingly near death. He had begun to question everything. When his FBI interlocutors intimated to Jack Childs their desire to infiltrate the top level of the Communist Party with an informant, Jack had a potential solution, declaring [...] "Morris is <b>your</b> <b>ticket</b> to the top." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although Stax {{had also}} lost their most {{valuable}} artists, they recovered quickly. Johnnie Taylor gave Stax its first big post-Atlantic hit in 1968 with [...] "Who's Making Love", {{which became the}} label's best-selling single to that point. To begin rebuilding its catalog, Stax, under orders from Al Bell, released a whopping 27 albums (a Rufus Thomas album titled May I Have <b>Your</b> <b>Ticket</b> Please? {{was to be the}} 28th album released by the Gulf+Western-owned Stax, but the album was never finished) and 30 singles in mid-1969. [...] Producer and songwriter Isaac Hayes stepped into the spotlight with Hot Buttered Soul. Originally seen just as a solo artistic project for Hayes to make up the numbers, it went on to sell over three million copies in 1969. By 1971, Hayes was established as the label's biggest star and was particularly noted for his best-selling soundtrack to the 1971 blaxploitation film Shaft. Hayes' recordings were among the releases on a third major Stax label, Enterprise, which had been founded in 1967.|$|E
