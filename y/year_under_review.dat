40|$|No {{research}} has been done to date on Economic Value Added (EVA) as a performance measure for South African agricultural co-operatives. The main objective {{of this study is to}} calculate Economic Value Added for South African agricultural co-operatives. Further objectives are to determine whether co-operatives add value to their members’ interest, whether there exists a correlation between EVA performances over the <b>years</b> <b>under</b> <b>review</b> and between the individual groups of co-operatives. The study aims to determine EVA for the grain and oilseeds, wine, meat, timber, tobacco, fruit and vegetables co-operatives. The study further calculated EVA values for all the groups of co-operatives under changing beta-values to look at the sensitivity of EVA. EVA can be described as a value–based performance measure, an investment decision tool and also a performance measure reflecting the absolute amount of shareholder value created. Three basic inputs are needed in the calculation of EVA, namely return on capital earned on investments, the cost of capital for those investments and the capital invested in them. These three inputs are determined before the calculation of EVA can be applied. The values for the determination of these inputs are obtained from the income statements and balance sheets of the respective agricultural co-operatives. After the calculation of the EVA values for all the separate co-operatives, it could be concluded that no grain and oilseed co-operatives created value. There was only one wine co-operative which created value, five which improved from a negative to a positive EVA, three which had negative but improving EVA values. The rest of the wine co-operatives destroyed value. In the case of meat co-operatives three of the four co-operatives destroyed value, while the other one created value in the first (1998) and last <b>year</b> (2001) <b>under</b> <b>review.</b> The timber co-operatives created value, except for one of the three which destroyed value in 2000 and 2001. The tobacco co-operatives destroyed value over the four <b>years</b> <b>under</b> <b>review.</b> In the case of fruit and vegetable co-operatives, one co-operative created value, while the rest of the co-operatives destroyed value. All of the general co-operatives, as well as all the requisites co-operatives destroyed value. Averages for all the groups of co-operatives were calculated as well. Grain and oilseeds, wine, tobacco, general and requisites co-operatives destroyed value. The average of the meat co-operatives showed that this group destroyed value over the first three <b>years</b> <b>under</b> <b>review,</b> but created value in the last year. Timber, fruit and vegetable co-operatives created value over all four of the <b>years</b> <b>under</b> <b>review.</b> The average for all of the co-operatives showed that co-operatives, in general, destroyed value. From this study it becomes clear that no correlation exists between the EVA values calculated for the co-operatives over the four <b>year</b> period <b>under</b> <b>review.</b> There is no correlation between the individual groups of co-operatives either. This means that the EVA performance of co-operatives are not influenced by external factors, but depends on the effective management and decision-making within the agricultural co-operatives. By increasing and decreasing beta-values by 10 % and 20 % respectively and then recalculating EVA with these changed beta-values, the sensitivity of EVA could be determined. There were no significant changes in the EVA values after recalculating them. Most negative EVA values stayed negative and the positive EVA values stayed positive after recalculating EVA. It can be said that EVA is not very sensitive to the changing betas. Dissertation (MSc (Agric)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2006.

According to him: ‘Buhari ought to face the mirror of his campaign promises every day of his finite tenure. He should respect the Buharimeter as the reflection of his vows and accomplishments. This will furnish him with the right perspective he needs to secure a befitting legacy.’ Buharimeter’s one-year report did provide a synopsis of citizens’ perception on the implications of actions of government and also revealed degree at which Nigerians are aware of campaign promises and actions to achieve them.

40|$|Abstract Background Haemodialysis is {{the most}} common form of renal {{replacement}} therapy in Nigeria. The high cost of haemodialysis has made optimal therapy of end-stage renal disease difficult in Nigeria. This paper is a review of data collected over two years of provision of dialysis services in a new tertiary hospital in Southern Nigeria. Methods This retrospective analysis is done on data obtained from the patient case files and dialysis records in the first two years of provision of dialysis services in our centre. A gender comparison of the patients' baseline sociodemographic, clinical and biochemical was performed and a logistic regression model used to assess the predictors of mortality. Results A total of 98 patients had 471 sessions in the two <b>years</b> <b>under</b> <b>review.</b> Males and females had similar characteristics at baseline except for a higher median serum urea in the males. The commonest causes of end-stage renal disease were chronic glomerulonephritis (34. 5 %), hypertension (32. 1 %) and diabetes mellitus (17. 9 %). The main predictor of mortality was under treatment with haemodialysis due to inability to pay for more than a few dialysis sessions. Conclusions This study has highlighted the unchanging demographics of our advanced kidney failure patients. Efforts should be aimed at subsidizing the cost of dialysis for our teeming population of dialysis dependent chronic kidney disease patients. </p...|$|R
