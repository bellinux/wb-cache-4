500|$|Two main {{charges were}} brought to the House of Commons against Marlborough: first, an {{assertion}} that over nine years he had illegally received more than £63,000 from the bread and transport contractors in the Netherlands; second, that he had taken 2.5% from the pay of the foreign troops in English pay, amounting to £280,000. Despite Marlborough's refutations (claiming ancient precedent for the first allegation, and, for the second, producing a warrant signed by the Queen in 1702 authorising him to make the deductions in lieu of secret-service money for the war), the findings were enough for Harley to persuade the Queen to release her Captain-General. On 29 December 1711 (O.S.), before the charges had been examined, Anne, who owed to him the success and glory of her reign, sent her letter of dismissal: [...] "I am sorry for your own sake the reasons are become so public which makes it necessary for me to let <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> render'd it impracticable for you to continue yet longer in my service". The Tory dominated Parliament concluded by a substantial majority that, [...] "the taking of several sums of money annually by the Duke of Marlborough from the contractor for foraging the bread and wagons... was unwarrantable and illegal", and that the 2.5% deducted from the pay of foreign troops [...] "is public money and ought to be accounted for". When his successor, the Duke of Ormonde, left London for The Hague to take command of British forces he went, noted Bishop Burnet, with [...] "the same allowances that had been lately voted criminal in the Duke of Marlborough".|$|E
