[...] The review however stated {{that it was important}} to remember Final Fantasy III as [...] "a slice of history and a missing piece of a blockbuster series," [...] citing that [...] "hardcore RPG players" [...] may enjoy the title more than other Final Fantasy games and calling it [...] "one of the best portable RPGs to date." [...] GameSpy argued that one's enjoyment hinged [...] "entirely on <b>your</b> <b>desire</b> to play a game with decidedly archaic game mechanics that may seem primitive and uninviting" [...] compared to other recent Square Enix titles, noting the game was [...] "quite challenging" [...] and adding that [...] "some people live for this stuff, but others may be annoyed at the game's often unfriendly nature." ...|$|E
500|$|During the 1890s, Elgar {{gradually}} {{built up}} {{a reputation as a}} composer, chiefly of works for the great choral festivals of the English Midlands. The Black Knight (1892) and King Olaf (1896), both inspired by Longfellow, The Light of Life (1896) and Caractacus (1898) were all modestly successful, and he obtained a long-standing publisher in Novello and Co. Other works of this decade included the Serenade for Strings (1892) and Three Bavarian Dances (1897). Elgar was of enough consequence locally to recommend the young composer Samuel Coleridge-Taylor to the Three Choirs Festival for a concert piece, which helped establish the younger man's career. Elgar was catching the attention of prominent critics, but their reviews were polite rather than enthusiastic. Although he was in demand as a festival composer, he was only just getting by financially and felt unappreciated. In 1898, he said he was [...] "very sick at heart over music" [...] and hoped {{to find a way to}} succeed with a larger work. His friend August Jaeger tried to lift his spirits: [...] "A day's attack of the blues ... will not drive away <b>your</b> <b>desire,</b> your necessity, which is to exercise those creative faculties which a kind providence has given you. Your time of universal recognition will come." ...|$|E

The letter {{emphasised}} the Co-operative Movements' community involvement and ethical principles (as laid down by the Rochdale Principles), and asked for Blair to help the movement develop and modernise to [...] "meet the challenges of the next millennium": the Prime Minister was asked to create and sponsor a Co-operative Commission in the mould of the Gaitskell Commission, and was provided with terms of reference for the proposed group.

2500|$|As {{the poet}} implores [...] "Sweet love" [...] (1) {{to conquer the}} lust that is ruining his union with the young man. This {{analysis}} of the sonnet relies upon two assumptions: 1) the young man is the poet's lover and 2) that when the poet refers to [...] "sad interim" [...] (9), he {{does not mean that}} the young man is away from London, but that he is separated from him emotionally - i.e., they are in a [...] "period of estrangement" [...] from one another due to the young man's promiscuity. Thus the poet is [...] "whipping up the young man's flagging affection. Behind lines 9-12 flickers a reminiscence of the situation of Hero and Leander" [...] (Rowse 115). The situation becomes even more clear when we read Sonnet 57, in which the poet, now very worried about the young man's lustful nature, asks him outright, [...] "Being your slave, what should I do but tend/Upon the hours and times of <b>your</b> <b>desire?...</b> dare I question with my jealous thought/Where you may be" [...] (1-2/9-10).|$|E

The day following the wedding, however, according to the memoirs of Count Horace de Viel-Castel, the new Madame de Païva gave her husband a letter ending the marriage. [...] "You have obtained the object of <b>your</b> <b>desire</b> and have succeeded in making me your wife," [...] she wrote. [...] "I, on the other hand, have acquired your name, and we can cry quits. I have acted my part honestly and without disguise, and the position I aspired to I have gained; but as for you, Mons. de Païva, you are saddled with a wife of foulest repute, whom you can introduce to no society, for no one will receive her.

2500|$|On 24 August 2009, Lockerbie campaigner Dr Jim Swire {{wrote to}} Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, {{calling for a}} full inquiry, {{including}} the question of suppression of the Heathrow evidence. This was backed up by a delegation of Lockerbie relatives, led by Pamela Dix, who went to 10 Downing Street on 24 October 2009 and handed over a letter addressed to Gordon Brown calling {{for a meeting with}} the Prime Minister to discuss the need for a public inquiry and the main issues that it should address. An op-ed article by Pamela Dix, subtitled [...] "The families of those killed in the bombing have not given up hope of an inquiry to help us learn the lessons of this tragedy", was published in The Guardian on 26 October 2009. On 1 November 2009, it was reported that Gordon Brown had ruled out a public inquiry into Lockerbie, saying in response to Dr Swire's letter: [...] "I understand <b>your</b> <b>desire</b> to understand the events surrounding the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 but I do not think it would be appropriate for the UK government to open an inquiry of this sort." [...] UK ministers explained that it was for the Scottish government to decide if it wants to hold its own, more limited, inquiry into the worst terrorist attack on British soil. The Scottish government had already rejected an independent inquiry, saying it lacks the constitutional power to examine the international dimensions of the case.|$|E

[...] Entertainment Weekly writer Lisa Schwarzbaum gave the book a [...] "B+" [...] rating and praised it for being [...] "in a class by itself." [...] British author Jenny Colgan in The Guardian wrote [...] "It is jolly, eminently readable and as sweet and safe as BDSM (bondage, discipline, sadism and masochism) erotica can be without contravening the trade descriptions act" [...] and also praised the book for being [...] "more enjoyable" [...] than other [...] "literary erotic books". The Daily Telegraph noted that the book was [...] "the definition of a page-turner", noting that the book was both [...] "troubling and intriguing". A reviewer for the Ledger-Enquirer described the book as guilty fun and escapism, and that it [...] "also touches on one aspect of female existence [...] And acknowledging that fact – maybe even appreciating it – shouldn't be a cause for guilt." [...] The New Zealand Herald stated that the book [...] "will win no prizes for its prose" [...] and that [...] "there are some exceedingly awful descriptions," [...] although {{it was also an}} easy read; [...] "(If you only) can suspend your disbelief and <b>your</b> <b>desire</b> to – if you'll pardon the expression – slap the heroine for having so little self respect, you might enjoy it." [...] The Columbus Dispatch stated that, [...] "Despite the clunky prose, James does cause one to turn the page." [...] Metro News Canada wrote that [...] "suffering through 500 pages of this heroine's inner dialogue was torturous, and not in the intended, sexy kind of way". Jessica Reaves, of the Chicago Tribune, wrote that the [...] "book's source material isn't great literature", noting that the novel is [...] "sprinkled liberally and repeatedly with asinine phrases", and described it as [...] "depressing".|$|E
