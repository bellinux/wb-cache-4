500|$|While {{calling into}} WVEE during their {{interview}} with Ciara and Polow da Don, Hilson said, [...] "I {{just want to}} tell Ciara it’s not about <b>you.</b> <b>People</b> <b>are</b> just reading way too far into it. People take things and make it what they want it to be. It wasn’t taking shots at nobody." [...] I just want to let Atlanta know and Ciara know that this is a true leak. I did, and I don't know if Polow said this on the radio, but I did fight this coming out. I didn't want this coming out because we played it for people when I did it and that's what people said it was about; they started throwing out names. We were like 'No, it's not about that' and we tried to let them know what it was really about. But the fact that people brought back names, it was like ok, that wasn't the reaction we need, so I told Polow, 'let's not do this and he agreed". Ciara happened to call in during the time period and said she was happy of where Hilson was at in her career, to which Hilson responded the same, saying how proud she was, and [...] "watching her from ground zero." [...] Hilson went on to state she was not jealous of anyone's career, noting how all female R artists are the same, pointing out that [...] "Keyshia’s on my album. I’ve worked with Ciara many times. I’m a fan of Beyoncé’s." [...] When asked exactly who the song is about, Hilson said the targets knew who they were, responding, [...] "It’s anybody that ever tried to take me down and didn’t want to see me succeed. I’m not gonna call their names because I feel I’ve addressed it." [...] She further clarified, commenting [...] "I will say this, my journey has been 12 years long and there have been many people, specifically girls, and it really just isn't one person, it's been a lot of people." ...|$|E

"If the Russian fans boo {{their players}} in Moscow like <b>you</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> booing us, I'll {{come back and}} {{apologize}} personally to every one of you, but I really don't think that will happen. We gave it and are doing our best. All of us guys are really disheartened[...] [...] We came out here because we love Canada. They're a good hockey team, and we don't know {{what we could do}} better, but I promise we will figure it out. But it's totally ridiculous – I don't think it is fair that we should be booed." ...|$|E
2500|$|Vocalist Ronnie Radke {{had been}} hinting on Twitter {{that the group}} {{had been working on}} the band's second album, with tweets such as [...] "You guys don't {{understand}} how many light years my next album is from the last one". He and bandmate Ron Ficarro tweeted pictures of them in the studio with Ryan Ogren working on some new music. Ronnie had said {{a little bit about the}} new album to Marshal Music News. He said that, [...] "The last record was so vengeful and bitter and spiteful - so everyone is wondering what I'm gonna sing about next. And I'm just not quite ready to let people know. I'm sorry. When people hear the new stuff though I promise you they will lose their mind. It's light years ahead of my last album. We're demoing new songs right now, as we speak, and I'm telling <b>you,</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> seriously gonna lose their mind." [...] During the band's performance at Dirt Fest 2012 in Birch Run Michigan, Radke announced to the crowd that it would be the group's last show before returning to the studio for the band's second album. Ronnie also said in an interview that the band would be in the studio late 2012 with demos already and hoping for an early 2013 release. In issue number 1442 of Kerrang! Magazine, Ronnie Radke announced in an interview that [...] "The record's finished! That's what we did after the Warped Tour. We just didn't tell anybody!" [...] He also said [...] " [...] early next year !" ...|$|E

5000|$|On March 6, 2007, What the Fuck <b>is</b> Wrong With <b>You</b> <b>People?</b> <b>was</b> {{released}} to some critical praise and popularity.

6000|$|... "It's {{not what}} {{your work is}} worth," [...] he explained. [...] "It's what your {{advantages}} can get for <b>you.</b> <b>People</b> <b>are</b> always going about supposing--just what you suppose--that people ought to get paid {{in proportion to the}} good they do. It's forgetting what the world is, to do that. Very likely some day civilization will get to that, but it hasn't got to it yet. It isn't going to get to it for hundreds and hundreds of years." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is satisfactorily settled," [...] he said. [...] "Blacquard, who is {{in charge}} of the treasury, was delighted to obtain some gold, and has given us five times the amount in assignats. Of this I will take two hundred and fifty louis' worth. You will have seven hundred and fifty louis in assignats, and we will divide the hundred louis in gold. Of the latter, you had best sew up twenty in each of your saddles, and you can carry ten about <b>you.</b> <b>People</b> <b>are</b> so anxious for gold that, in case of need, you can get {{services}} rendered for it that you would fail to obtain for any amount of paper." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{is another}} reason.

It would be different, however, if it were known that the trouble was about something that had no connection with politics; therefore, I should advise you, when you are asked questions, to turn it off with a laugh. Say you got mixed up in an affair between a young lady and her lover, and that, like many other people, you found that those who mingle in such matters often get left in the lurch. You need not say much more than that. You might do anything here without your friends troubling much about it provided {{it had nothing to do}} with politics. Rob a bank, perpetrate a big swindle, run away with a court heiress, and as long as the police don't lay hands on you nobody else will trouble their heads about the affair; but if you are suspected of being mixed up in the most remote way with politics, your best friends will shun you like the plague." ...|$|E

I don't know what <b>you</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> made of. You seem to think that all sins are kept {{together}} in a bag. You talk as if a miser on Monday were always a spendthrift on Tuesday. You tell me this man you have here spent weeks and months wheedling needy women out of small sums of money; that he used a drug at the best, and a poison at the worst; that he turned up afterwards as the lowest kind of moneylender, and cheated most poor people in the same patient and pacific style. Let it be granted--let us admit, for the sake of argument, that he did all this. If that is so, I will tell you what he didn't do. He didn't storm a spiked wall against a man with a loaded gun. He didn't write on the wall with his own hand, to say he had done it. He didn't stop to state that his justification was self-defence. He didn't explain that he had no quarrel with the poor warder. He didn't name the house of the rich man to which he was going with the gun. He didn't write his own, initials in a man's blood. Saints alive! Can't you see the whole character is different, in good and evil? Why, you don't seem to be like I am a bit. One would think you'd never had any vices of your own." ...|$|E
