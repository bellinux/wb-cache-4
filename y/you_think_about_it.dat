And when <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> that's also Peter Parker's core issue." [...] The episode's title, [...] "Interactions," [...] expands the series theme [...] "The Education of Peter Parker" [...] chosen by developer Greg Weisman. Episodes in the early season one arc all shared a naming scheme based on the biological sciences.|$|E

Growing up, I admired the kind of beautiful glamorous woman—from Brigitte Bardot to Grace Kelly—who doesn't seem to be around much anymore. I think it's time {{for that kind of}} glamor to come back. In pop music generally, people have one image. You get pigeonholed. I'm lucky {{enough to be able to}} change and still be accepted. If <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> that's what they do in the movies; play a part, change characters, looks and attitudes. I guess I do it to entertain myself." ...|$|E
500|$|As with {{previous}} ceremonies he produced, Cates centered the show around a theme. This year, he christened {{the show with}} the theme [...] "Togetherness of Moviegoing" [...] commenting, [...] "The thing that's kind of wonderful about movies is that you watch them with other people. The only other areas where you do that, when <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> are religion and sports." [...] He concluded by noting that the movie theater is [...] "a wonderful place where you come together to laugh, to cry." [...] In tandem with the theme, actress Winona Ryder presented a montage featuring film clips from Matinee, Casablanca, and A Streetcar Named Desire depicting audiences inside a movie theater.|$|E

500|$|Clocking in at {{over two}} hours in length and {{containing}} 34 tracks, The Astonishing was planned as an immersive experience that would be best enjoyed as a full album {{as opposed to a}} collection of singles. The album plays out similarly to a film, with Loudwire observing, [...] "It’s an enormous amount of music to absorb in one sitting, but when <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> most movies are around {{two hours in}} length, and The Astonishing is very much like a movie in the way it delivers the storyline." [...] Certain songs, such as [...] "A Savior in the Square" [...] and [...] "Our New World", have reoccurring themes, while others stand more on their own in order to move the plot along.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the initial}} {{popularity}} of Bryan's message, Hanna was convinced the Democrat's support would recede. [...] "He's talking Silver all the time, and that's where we've got him", Hanna stated, pounding his desk, in July. [...] He proved correct; the silver enthusiasm waned by September and Bryan had no ready replacement for it. [...] McKinley, {{on the other}} hand, convinced that his [...] "sound money" [...] campaign had worked, began to promote his tariff issue, stating to the crowds on his front lawn, [...] "I {{do not know what}} <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> but I believe it is a good deal better to open the mills of the United States to the labor of America than to open the mints of the United States to the silver of the world." ...|$|E
500|$|Singer and Sigel {{credited}} Road to Perdition as {{a visual}} influence. Though Sigel shot the first X-Men in anamorphic format, he opted to shoot X2 in Super 35. Sigel felt the recent improvements in film stocks and optics increased the advantages of using spherical lenses, even if the blowup to anamorphic must be accomplished optically instead of digitally. Sigel noted, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> every anamorphic lens is simply a spherical lens with an anamorphizer on it. They'll never {{be as good as}} the spherical lenses that they emulate." [...] Cameras that were used during filming included two Panaflex Millenniums and a Millennium XL, as well as an Aaton 35mm. Singer also used zoom lenses more often than he did in his previous films, while Sigel used a Frazier lens specifically for dramatic moments.|$|E

500|$|Mega Man 6 was {{developed}} {{at the same time}} as the franchise's first spin-off, Mega Man X for Nintendo's newer console, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Series artist Keiji Inafune, credited as [...] "Inafking", stated that having a video game franchise with six titles is very rare, and one of the advantages to this is that players expect certain aspects of each game to be repeated in the next. After having implemented so many different mechanics to the gameplay of past entries, Inafune thought that Rush adaptor assembly was inevitable. The artist struggled with the adaptor designs and ultimately found them to be unrealistic. According to Inafune, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> they shouldn't be able to combine like this. It would be awkward if parts of Rush like his neck were left over after they combined, so what was I supposed to do?" ...|$|E
500|$|Reviews of {{the show}} were often favorable, noting it was fun {{entertainment}} for the family. After Double Dare premiered, Kenneth R. Clark, media writer for the Chicago Tribune, observed that when contestants [...] "squeal and make faces, it is somehow natural, wholesome and infectious," [...] and said, [...] "Double Dare is so refreshing." [...] Noel Holston of the Minneapolis Star and Tribune wrote that [...] "kids and game shows, when <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> go together like hot fudge and ice cream". The Orange County Registers Ellen T. Klein said Double Dare is [...] "such fast-paced, furious and messy fun" [...] and rated the show as [...] "good". In 1988, television critic Ken Tucker cited the interaction between, and the performances of host Marc Summers and announcer Harvey as [...] "the not-so-secret ingredients in the show's success in drawing adult, as well as youthful, viewers".|$|E
500|$|In June 2008, it was {{reported}} that Wellard was to be killed off. A show insider explained: [...] "Wellard has been a much-loved character and everyone will be sad to see him go. But if <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> Wellard was not a puppy when he arrived on Albert Square, so he would be over 100 in dog years by now. It makes sense for him to bow out of the show gracefully." [...] Raddings commented: [...] "I used to take Kyte on set everyday but I found the scenes when Wellard was put down too hard to watch so I asked someone else to take her to filming." [...] The scene in which Wellard was euthanised had to be re-edited, as Kyte could be seen breathing when supposedly dead. At the time of his death, Wellard had been in EastEnders for 14 years, making him one of the show's longest-running characters, and its longest-serving pet.|$|E

[...] She acknowledged to the Herald Sun that it was helpful to have Gibson's production company assist with her music career, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> every talent needs a serious push and help from somebody who is stronger, because it's pretty much impossible for anybody to succeed in this industry. So I've become very lucky, and I'm very grateful. You don't control the situations or the people you meet. I did not plan this. I'm just doing what I've always been doing.

500|$|On Selection Sunday, Temple Owls {{received}} a seven seed and {{was due to}} face Penn State in the 2011 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament on March 17 at the McKale Center in Tucson, Arizona. The two teams had played {{each other in a}} scrimmage in the preseason. They had also met in the 2001 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament when the Owls earned an 84–72 victory in the Sweet Sixteen. Coming into the game, Fran Dunphy had a NCAA tournament record 11-game losing streak, at Penn and Temple Owls. [...] "I probably think about it less than others do," [...] said Dunphy, [...] "but <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> I would be lying if I said I didn't.

500|$|Critics {{praised the}} cast for their hamming and {{effective}} delivery of what Bennion called the [...] "stilted, stagy dialogue"; Toby Dantzic, writing for The Telegraph Saturday Review, called the acting [...] "stellar". The {{attention to detail}} by {{the cast and crew}} was widely praised; the [...] "dated styling" [...] was, for Jackson, [...] "spot on". Louisa Mellor, of the entertainment website Den of Geek, explained that [...] "from the aspect ratio to the music, title font, sets, lighting, camera moves, hair, make-up and costume... everything was recognisable from the sort of 1970s television plays that, when <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> may have provided inspiration for Inside No. 9 as a whole". For her, [...] "the retro send-up provided enough entertainment on its own—these days {{you have to be very}} good to make TV that bad". White, similarly, argued that [...] "it's a gargantuan, incredibly precise task to make such gloriously terrible TV, a skill reserved for only the greatest of comics". Even despite the flaws of the film within the episode, Rebecca Nicholson, of theguardian.com, found it [...] "relatively gripping". Sarah Hughes, writing in i, compared [...] "The Devil of Christmas" [...] to an episode of Tales of the Unexpected; it was she, argued, [...] "both an immaculately conceived homage to Roald Dahl's original anthology series and a worthy contender for its crown".|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Superpower" [...] was {{directed}} by Jonas Åkerlund. It was filmed at the Hawthorne Plaza Shopping Center, a former shopping mall which was converted to a film set in Hawthorne, California. The singer was spotted by media on November 12, 2013 on the location set wearing a Louis Vuitton ski mask while filming the video. Beyoncé does not lip-sync or dance during the video. During an interview, she explained that [...] "Superpower" [...] was a song which [...] "you can just put on repeat and put you in this trance, which is why I didn't want to perform it in the video". With that being said, she wanted to focus on slow motion shots of [...] "really powerful imagery". It features former Destiny's Child members Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams as well as Pharrell Williams, Luke James and Les Twins. The director {{said that it was}} a [...] "spontaneous decision" [...] to include them in the video; Frank Ocean was also originally planned to appear. Åkerlund elaborated on the video: It's a very untraditional way of doing music videos, to not have her lip-synch. For Beyoncé, who's a dancer, it's very unusual to have a video without a dance part. I felt part of this idea for [...] "Superpower" [...] was to have stuff be in contrast to each other, so this song is very soft and very slow, but the action you see is aggressive and very big. We discussed it many times to see if we'd have the performance in the video or not. We decided no, and I think it works really, really well. It's kind of like a brave move, if <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Most artists can act and have all these different things, but they'll still fall back on the performance.|$|E
