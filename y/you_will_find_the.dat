2500|$|Of key {{important}} to Okabayashi's approach was a traditional concept of movement common to most koryū styles but {{not present in}} the teachings of most contemporary Daitō-ryū teachers. This concept was called 'hitoemi', and describes an idiosyncratic movement, readily seen in any Japanese period drama or koryū art, where the warrior class walk and perform techniques while lining their bodies up 'on one line' as they move forward. Okabayashi during his lengthy morning sessions acting uke, or receiver of techniques for Takeda noticed that his movements always seem to conform to this principle while other teachers, even {{those who had been}} taught by Tokimune did not always move so. When he asked the headmaster about this he reputedly replied obliquely saying [...] "The secret of Daitō-ryū {{is to be found in}} our sword. Study the sword movements and <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> answers. [...] " [...] As the koryū sword movements were based upon hitoemi Okabayashi took this to mean that he was moving in the right direction with his practise.|$|E

In one of many letters on the subject, Chekhov would complain, [...] "Anya, I fear, should not have any sort of tearful tone...
