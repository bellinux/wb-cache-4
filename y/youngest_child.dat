Highlights on the importance of mathematics for <b>young</b> <b>children,</b> characteristics of <b>young</b> <b>children</b> with math difficulties or disabilities, math interventions for <b>young</b> <b>children,</b> math instruction in early childhood, and recommendations and implications for practice are presented. While there is a recent increase of literature on math with <b>young</b> <b>children,</b> there is a scarcity of research related to <b>young</b> <b>children</b> with disabilities, particularly utilizing evidence based interventions. Evidence supports the benefits of focusing on mathematics instruction in the preschool years for children with disabilities.

40|$|Research {{has shown}} that <b>young</b> <b>children</b> have some {{understandings}} of death. However, adults are hesitant (or even avoidant) to discuss death with <b>young</b> <b>children</b> for fear that they will scare them, or they are {{not sure what to}} tell them. Sessions were part of this project, educating adults in a child’s development and how that development affects what <b>young</b> <b>children</b> understand about death. The three sessions, completed over two weeks, included three topics including anxieties the adult may have about death, cognitive and emotional development of the <b>young</b> <b>child,</b> and the adult’s role in discussing death with <b>young</b> <b>children.</b> Participants completed a pre- and post-test. Results indicated that adults felt more comfortable discussing the death of a person with a <b>young</b> <b>child,</b> as well as feeling less avoidant of having those discussions...|$|R

5|$|In 1892 Rimsky-Korsakov {{suffered}} a second creative drought, {{brought on by}} bouts of depression and alarming physical symptoms. Rushes of blood to the head, confusion, memory loss and unpleasant obsessions led to a medical diagnosis of neurasthenia. Crises in the Rimsky-Korsakov household {{may have been a}} factor—the serious illnesses of his wife and one of his sons from diphtheria in 1890, the deaths of his mother and <b>youngest</b> <b>child,</b> as well as the onset of the prolonged, ultimately fatal illness of his second <b>youngest</b> <b>child.</b> He resigned from the Russian Symphony Concerts and the Court Chapel and considered giving up composition permanently.

40|$|This chapter {{considers}} the spaces in which <b>young</b> <b>children</b> live their lives, {{and how these}} spaces are caught up with how societies understand <b>young</b> <b>children</b> and early childhood. It identifies three broad ways of theorising the spaces in which <b>young</b> <b>children</b> live their lives, and considers how these both reflect and produce young children’s position within society. First, the chapter considers those, adult-designated, spaces for <b>young</b> <b>children</b> that are so common in the minority world, which are intended to protect <b>young</b> <b>children</b> from {{the dangers of the}} adult world and to shape and ‘improve’ them in line with a range of desired outcomes (both developmental and societal). Second, the chapter explores theories of young children’s spaces, which emphasise the active role that <b>young</b> <b>children</b> play in responding to and shaping the spaces around them. Finally, the chapter develops ideas of inhabiting young children’s spaces to develop and consider a more vital account of the materiality of the spaces in which <b>young</b> <b>children</b> live, which moves beyond beyond the dualistic accounts that have tended to dominate post-Enlightenment Western thought...|$|R

This paper {{describes}} an automatic tissue segmentation algorithm for brain MRI of <b>young</b> <b>children.</b> Existing segmentation methods {{developed for the}} adult brain do {{not take into account}} the specific tissue properties present in the brain MRI of <b>young</b> <b>children.</b> We examine the suitability of state-of-the-art methods developed for the adult brain when applied to the segmentation of the <b>young</b> <b>child</b> brain MRI. We develop a method of creation of a population-specific atlas from <b>young</b> <b>children</b> using a single manual segmentation. The method is based on non-linear propagation of the segmentation into population and subsequent affine alignment into a reference space and averaging. Using this approach we significantly improve the performance of the popular EM segmentation algorithm on brain MRI of <b>young</b> <b>children.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|About the Book:] <b>Young</b> <b>children</b> as {{citizens}} explores how <b>young</b> <b>children</b> (birth to 12 years of age) {{can and should}} participate in civic life. It reflects new images of <b>young</b> <b>children</b> as social actors, together with the increased interest in children's rights in the public sphere. The contributors are early childhood researchers, pedagogues, children and policy makers from Australia and Europe. They present a rich diversity of research-based case studies in which policy-makers and educators have listened to young children¹s views on public issues and responded in respectful and ethical ways. <b>Young</b> <b>children</b> {{as citizens}} is a unique resource for policy-makers, those working in children's services and child advocates. It shows how best to consult <b>young</b> <b>children</b> and it presents a range of arguments that consulting <b>young</b> <b>children</b> about policies and decisions that affect them supports and enhances a vigorous democratic society. Students (undergraduate and postgraduate), teachers and researchers in early childhood studies can use individual chapters of <b>Young</b> <b>children</b> as citizens selectively to explore issues of increasing complexity in different courses. The book {{would be a good}} set text for Honours and Master's programs that address issues of children's rights...|$|R
