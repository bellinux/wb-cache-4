Together they established a formidable cultural and political movement, successfully fighting many cases against police oppression and arbitrariness and for better state education. It was the Alliance that formed the New Cross Massacre Action Committee {{in response to the}} alleged arson attack which resulted in the death of 14 <b>young</b> <b>blacks,</b> and mobilised 20,000 black people and their supporters in March 1981 to protest the death of the young people and the failure of the police to conduct a proper investigation.

500|$|Many of Gordimer's {{works have}} {{explored}} {{the impact of}} apartheid on individuals in South Africa. Journalist and novelist George Packer writes that, as in several of her novels, a theme in Burger's Daughter is of racially divided societies in which well-meaning whites unexpectedly encounter a side of black life {{they did not know}} about. Literary critic Carolyn Turgeon says that while Lionel was able to work with black activists in the ANC, Rosa discovers that with the rise of the Black Consciousness Movement, many <b>young</b> <b>blacks</b> tend [...] to view white liberals as irrelevant in their struggle for liberation. Rosa witnesses this first hand listening to the black university student in Soweto (Duma Dhladhla) and, later, in London, her childhood friend [...] "Baasie" [...] (Zwelinzima Vulindlela), who both dismiss her father as unimportant.|$|E

40|$|This work {{examines}} {{methods used}} by <b>young</b> <b>Black</b> males dealing with societal impositions (i. e. racial oppression, paternal rejection, mis—education, abandonment, and imprisonment) {{as seen in}} Ernest Gaines’ novels Of Love and Dust (1967), In My Father’s House (1978), and a Lesson Before Dying (1993). The paper shows a direct correlation between these external impositions and the destructive behavior demonstrated by the <b>young</b> <b>Black</b> male characters. Gaines’ protagonists, who would be exterminated if Whites in power had their way, suffer from psychological trauma due to the pressures described above. This trauma causes these <b>young</b> <b>Black</b> males to act irresponsibly and thoughtlessly. Furthermore, these <b>young</b> <b>Black</b> males receive guidance from older Black males who teach them to accept the impositions of society {{as a method of}} coping with oppression. Also, this examination addresses the author’s metatextual message regarding the social status of <b>young</b> <b>Black</b> males. Over a span of twenty-six years, Gaines depicts characters who continuously worsen and, over time, ultimately disintegrate...|$|R

[...] had a couple of <b>young</b> <b>Blacks</b> who everybody knew used incendiary language — hateful things that irritated the police. They weren't convicted of murder.

I would be glad for her to make a new constitution, recognizing the emancipation proclamation, and adopting emancipation in those parts of the State to which the proclamation does not apply. And while she is at it, I think it would not be objectionable for her to adopt some practical system by which the two races could gradually live themselves out of their old relation to each other, and both come out better prepared for the new.

After all, the power or element of [...] "contract" [...] may be sufficient for this probationary period, and by its simplicity and flexibility may be the better.|$|E
