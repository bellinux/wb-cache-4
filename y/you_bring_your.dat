If <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> <b>your</b> {{soldiers}} here, we will throw you off the ship and you'll be humiliated {{in front of the whole}} world."

2500|$|Officials {{said the}} {{agreement}} with Teodorin showed that the justice department's Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative, {{under the auspices of}} which the probe into Teodorin had taken place, had become a key deterrent to foreign kleptocrats. [...] "These cases do send a strong message that if <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> <b>your</b> assets into our country, if you buy real estate here, we will find them. We will take them," [...] said U.S. Assistant Attorney General Leslie Caldwell, then head of the justice department's criminal division. The 2014 settlement did not affect Teodorin's ability to enter the U.S., which he continued to enjoy because of his diplomatic immunity.|$|E
2500|$|In Melody Maker, Adam Sweeting said [...] "The Unforgettable Fire is {{the other}} side of the coin from War. Where the latter opened with the {{shattering}} paramilitary drumbeat of 'Sunday Bloody Sunday',... Fire launches into the long shimmer of 'A Sort Of Homecoming,' whose sort-of-mystical lyric adorns the romantic maroon-and-gold sleeve. The fact is, if <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> <b>your</b> established conception of U2 to this record, you'll be disappointed." [...] Kurt Loder was more critical in Rolling Stone, [...] "U2 flickers and nearly fades, its fire banked by a misconceived production strategy and occasional interludes of soggy, songless self-indulgence. This is not a 'bad' album, but neither is it the irrefutable beauty the band's fans anticipated." [...] Village Voice critic Robert Christgau felt Bono's moralizing and [...] "wild romantic idealism" [...] proved careless, specifically on [...] "Pride" [...] and [...] "Elvis Presley and America", but concluded that those qualities work well enough for him throughout the rest of the album [...] "to make a skeptic believe temporarily in miracles". At the end of 1984, it was voted the 29th best record of the year in the Pazz & Jop, an annual poll of American critics published in The Village Voice.|$|E

2500|$|Bradshaw {{has also}} written about holding animals in captivity in {{facilities}} such as zoos, aquaria, and circuses. [...] She wrote a chapter in the book, Metamorphoses of the Zoo: Animal Encounter after Noah, by Ralph R. Acampora. [...] The chapter, titled [...] "Open Door Policy: Humanity's Relinquishment of [...] "Right to Sight" [...] and the Emergence of Feral Culture", discusses the extensive psychic damage caused by the objectification and [...] "forced incarceration of individuals with brains, minds, emotions, and cultures {{comparable to those of}} humans" [...] (Acampora, p.153), who are kept in a captive environment for public display and institutional profit. [...] In a 2011 , Bradshaw was asked to comment on captive animal businesses. [...] She stated, [...] "Captivity is institutionalized trauma. Zoos, aquaria, and other places like circuses are exploitative. They are businesses. Visiting zoos is no different from visiting prisons. These places are filled with animals suffering horribly, surviving by living in disturbing mental states and behaviors such as self-mutilation, depression, unhappiness, premature death, elephants living half as long as their free ranging counterparts, mothers killing their babies, aggression and fighting. Would <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> <b>your</b> child to a concentration camp or to a prison? The comparison is no exaggeration." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Transformer {{brothers}} {{also knew}} where he was, but he didn't look and just held his pole steady. The brothers came and landed {{on the side of}} the canoe. They asked the man, [...] "What are you doing?" [...] He responded, [...] "Oh, you are my grandchildren. Oh this here, this is my food that I am going to feed you with." [...] He tells the three men, [...] "I have a house right here, right there in that little bay. <b>You</b> <b>bring</b> <b>your</b> canoe over and come up ashore." [...] He pulled up his pole and had a lot of the moss ready. In the house, he had a big fire ready and a mountain of rock underneath, already hot. He took some sticks and grabbed the hot rocks and put them in a bowl that was filled with water. When the rocks were dropped in, the water began to boil. He took the boiling water and placed the moss inside and then made soup. The tells the men to have a seat on his bench with his big hyu7kem plate. This was the first hyu7kem plate made because he knew these men were coming. It made this plate really fancy, and fed them with three Mountain Goat horn spoons. The three men ate the moss.|$|E
