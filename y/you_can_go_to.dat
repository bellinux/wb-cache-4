500|$|Author Gary Tillery draws {{parallels}} between Harrison's approach to [...] " [...] {{through the motions}} of living in the material world" [...] and the way someone in the 21st century might play a virtual reality game. Tillery writes that [...] "what we see and experience during the game is actually an illusion" [...] – or maya in the Hindu belief to which Harrison subscribed – and that [...] "hat does matter in the great scheme of things is to wake up from the dreamlike state we mistake for reality." [...] Speaking at a 1974 press conference, in reply to whether there was a [...] "paradox" [...] between his spiritualism and the lifestyle of a musician, Harrison conceded: [...] "It is difficult... <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the Himalayas and miss it completely and [...] be stuck in the middle of New York and be very spiritual... I think one by one we all free ourselves from the chains that we have chained ourselves to, whatever we're chained to." ...|$|E

Spacey had been encouraged {{by a number of}} people he knew who had seen it, and was so impressed that he told Singer and McQuarrie {{that he wanted to be}} in whatever film they did next. Singer read a column in Spy magazine called [...] "The Usual Suspects" [...] after Claude Rains' line in Casablanca. Singer thought that it would be a good title for a film. When asked by a reporter at Sundance what their next film was about, McQuarrie replied, [...] "I guess it's about a bunch of criminals who meet in a police line-up," [...] which incidentally was the first visual idea that he and Singer had for the poster: [...] "five guys who meet in a line-up," [...] Singer remembers. The director also envisioned a tagline for the poster, [...] "All of <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Hell." [...] Singer then asked the question, [...] "What would possibly bring these five felons together in one line-up?" [...] McQuarrie revamped an idea from one of his own unpublished screenplays — the story of a man who murders his own family and disappears. The writer mixed this with the idea of a team of criminals.|$|E

500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Omega taking over Bullet Club's leadership, he and The Young Bucks formed their own subgroup within the stable, called [...] "The Elite". Omega and The Young Bucks {{came up with the}} idea for The Elite themselves, feeling the need to create something new after being forced by NJPW into Bullet Club and what Omega called a [...] "Too Sweet", [...] "Suck it" [...] parody of the nWo. Omega stated that he and The Young Bucks were The Elite, but accepted if NJPW continued calling them Bullet Club [...] "in parentheses" [...] as the stable was their [...] "cash cow". He explained the name change by stating that following Anderson, Gallows and Styles' departures from NJPW, [...] "Bullet Club [...] so much the Bullet Club anymore", adding that the stable [...] "had all sorts of wrestlers come and go. Some were good, some were bad, some were god-awful", but that [...] "there's a place <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> watch the most ridiculous and entertaining stuff in pro wrestling, and it's The Elite". Omega later added his opinion that Anderson, Gallows and Styles' departures had [...] "watered down" [...] Bullet Club's ranks, which is why he wanted to push The Elite to the forefront, claiming that when people said that [...] "Bullet Club [...] been doing some really cool stuff", they always meant him and The Young Bucks and not the other members of the group.|$|E

2500|$|Blomkamp {{wanted the}} aliens to {{maintain}} both humanistic and barbaric {{features in the}} design of the creatures. According to Terri Tatchell, the director's writing partner, [...] "They are not appealing, they are not cute, and they don't tug at our heartstrings. He went for a scary, hard, warrior-looking alien, which is much more of a challenge." [...] The look of the alien, with its exoskeleton-crustacean hybrid and crab-like shells, was meant to initially evoke a sense of disgust from viewers but as the story progresses, the audience was meant to sympathize with these creatures who had such human-like emotions and characteristics. Blomkamp established criteria for the design of the aliens. He wanted the species to be insect-like but also bipedal. The director wanted the audience to relate to the aliens and said of the restriction on the creature design, [...] "Unfortunately, they had to be human-esque because our psychology doesn't allow us to really empathize with something unless it has a face and an anthropomorphic shape. Like if you see something that's four-legged, you think it's a dog; that's just how we're wired... If you make a film about an alien force, which is the oppressor or aggressor, and you don't want to empathize with them, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> town. So creatively that's what I wanted to do but story-wise, I just couldn't." ...|$|E

2500|$|Spirits dead wheel {{turned out}} to be a mixed blessing. As it was {{traveling}} in March 2007, pulling the dead wheel behind, the wheel scraped off the upper layer of the Martian soil, uncovering a patch of ground that scientists say shows evidence of a past environment that would have been perfect for microbial life. It is similar to areas on Earth where water or steam from hot springs came into contact with volcanic rocks. On Earth, these are locations that tend to teem with bacteria, said rover chief scientist Steve Squyres. [...] "We're really excited about this," [...] he told a meeting of the American Geophysical Union (AGU). The area is extremely rich in silica–the main ingredient of window glass. The researchers have now concluded that the bright material must have been produced in one of two ways. One: hot-spring deposits produced when water dissolved silica at one location and then carried it to another (i.e. a geyser). Two: acidic steam rising through cracks in rocks [...] stripped them of their mineral components, leaving silica behind. [...] "The important thing is that whether it is one hypothesis or the other, the implications for the former habitability of Mars are pretty much the same," [...] Squyres explained to BBC News. Hot water provides an environment in which microbes can thrive and the precipitation of that silica entombs and preserves them. Squyres added, [...] "You can go to hot springs and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> fumaroles and at either place on Earth it is teeming with life – microbial life." ...|$|E
