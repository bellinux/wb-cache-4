I {{want you to see}} these kids wearing Bone Thugs & Harmony t-shirts and Metallica hats - this almost schizophrenic identification with popular imagery.

Its quite a nice job we have, and a great lifestyle. —Darren MiddletonWhen asked what inspires the band before live performances.|$|E

There are so {{many details}} down to the hinges and screws <b>that</b> <b>you</b> don’t <b>think</b> <b>about.</b> <b>That</b> was a surprise.

5000|$|First, to sum {{the demand}} {{functions}} without other strong assumptions {{it must be}} assumed that they are independent; that is that one consumer's demand decisions are not influenced by the decisions of another consumer. For example, A is asked how many pairs of shoes he would buy at a certain price. A says at that price I would be {{willing and able to}} buy two pairs of shoes. B is asked the same question and says four pairs. Questioner goes back to A and says B is willing to buy four pairs of shoes, what do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>that?</b> A says if B has any interest in those shoes then I have none. Or A, not to be outdone by B, says [...] "then I'll buy five pairs". And on and on. This problem can be eliminated by assuming that the consumers' tastes are fixed in the short run. This assumption can be expressed as assuming that each consumer is an independent idiosyncratic decision maker.|$|E

Some kind of bizarre behavior like that.ERICKSON: Well, if the kid came in to see me, the first thing I would do would be to want to examine the cross. And I would want to improve it in a very minor way. As soon as I got the slightest minor change in it, the way would be open for a larger change. And pretty soon I could deal with the advantages of a different cross - he ought to have at least two. He ought to have at least three so he could make a choice each day of which one. It's pretty hard to express a psychotic pattern of behavior over an ever-increasing number of crosses.|$|E
5000|$|... "People say, Why dont you do interviews? What do {{you think}} about this? What do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>that?</b> My job in the band is to play drums, to get up on stage and hold the band together. Thats what I do. At {{the end of the day}} thats all thats important. Everything else is irrelevant." [...] —Larry Mullen Jr. In the early days of U2, his {{contributions}} to the band were often limited to fills and drum rolls, but he became more involved in the writing of the songs later, particularly in conjunction with Adam Clayton, his partner in the rhythm section, with whom he has collaborated on solo projects. When the band was first being signed to CBS Records, they refused to sign the band unless Mullen was fired. He was not, and as a result, his drumming became more integrated into the song structures. His experiences in the Artane Boys Band reportedly heavily contributed to the martial beat featured in many of U2s songs, helping to evoke military imagery.|$|E

5000|$|... "When I {{was writing}} {{some of the}} songs of the album I was {{very much aware of}} this contradiction between being an artist, being a musician, trying to be {{creative}} and write songs and, then, at the point you finish an album, the music is finished, the creative side is finished, you then {{have to go out and}} sell and market and promote. And that's like a completely different experience. It's not a very creative process. It's quite - in some ways - a cynical process going on having to sell your music. But you have to do it. I mean, if a modern musician is going to survive as a musician, you have to - in a sense - 'prostitute yourself' to try and sell your music and your art. And I was very much aware of that contradiction. If <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> too much, it can drive you crazy, you know. It's an absurd thing to be doing. That kind of led me thinking about when I was a teenager, when I was just starting out and I was interested in being a musician. And I think a lot of teenage kids have this dream of being pop stars, of being a professional musician. This 'stupid dream' of being famous and 'life is a ball and everything is wonderful'. And, of course, actually the reality is that being a professional musician is a very hard work. It can be very heartbreaking, there's a lot of disappointment, there's a lot of hard work, there's a lot of travelling." ...|$|E

It was also the final NASCAR race for crew chief Steve Letarte, who will be leaving Hendrick Motorsports, where he's worked at since he was 16, and moving to the broadcast booth for NBC Sports next season. After four decades of being a crew chief and winning races in four decades, Jimmy Fennig retired from the sport after the checked flag flew. “Racing is what makes him tick and the competition,’‘ Matt Kenseth said of Fennig. “It’s hard to argue that Jimmy isn’t {{one of the best}} crew chiefs in the garage. There’s not many people that have been in the sport as long as he has and remained relevant and competitive as long as he has. I’ll never forget when we won the Daytona 500 in 2012 and he was smiling and said, ‘The last time I was here was 25 years ago with Bobby Allison - {{that was the last time}} I won the Daytona 500.’ When <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> and all the changes that this sport has had with technology and the cars and engineering and all that stuff compared to where we started, it really says something about somebody that’s still that competitive today.” “Jimmy somehow finds more time in the day and finds a way to work harder than almost anybody I’ve ever met," [...] Carl Edwards said.

40|$|International audienceIt takes 20 {{years to}} build a {{reputation}} and five minutes to ruin it. If <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> you’ll do things differently. - Warren Buffet Today, {{there are more than}} 3. 2 billion Internet users globally (International Telecommunication Union, 2015), making them able to see whatever happens online. One of the major abilities of the Internet, beyond its mass communication technology dimension, is its bi-directionality (Dellarocas, 2003). The Internet allows firms to reach a very large audience at low cost and individuals to diffuse their personal thoughts, opinions and reactions, making them available to any Internet user (Dellarocas, 2003). Social media are global, open, transparent, non-hierarchical, interactive and real-time, and are completely shifting individuals’ behaviors and expectations (Dutta, 2010). Online social platforms are used by billions of people around the world, making them a genuine phenomenon. The leading social networks worldwide ranked by number of active users are: • Facebook (1. 5 billion users), • WhatsApp (900 million users), and • QQ (860 million users) (Statista, 2016 a). Almost two-thirds of American adults use social networking sites. 35 % of 65 -year-olds and older is doing the same. Such behavior has entirely rebuilt the way people get and share information about everything related to their every day’s life (Perrin, 2015) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{practice}} of “spinning ” involves investment bankers allocating lucrative shares in {{initial public offerings}} (IPOs) to executives they are courting. For example, an investment banker courting the business of Joseph Cayre allocated 100, 000 shares of Pixar Animation Studios to him when Pixar went public. Cayre sold the shares that day for a $ 2 million profit. Cristina Morgan, the managing director of investment banking at Hambrecht & Quist, sees nothing unfair in spinning. Allocating hot IPOs to corporate executives, according to Morgan, is neither illegal nor immoral. It’s a business decision. “What we’re talking about is trying to solicit business,” said Morgan {{in an interview with}} Michael Siconolfi (1997). “What do you think about taking them out to dinner? What do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>that?</b> We throw lavish parties with caviar. Is that not trying to influence them, their behavior? I suggest that it is ” (p. A 1). In such ways, many investment bankers, security analysts, traders, and other finance professionals seem to behave as if they lived in a cocoon. Finance professionals can take pride in the contributions they make to society by analyzing the value of companies and stocks, linking entrepreneurs with investors, and operating markets that provide liquidity and optimal sharing of risk. Finance professionals favor regulations that promote fairness, but too often they maintain the naive belief that their own perceptions of fairness are shared by all. They are not. James Penrose (1997) reacted to Morgan’s defenses as follows: “Are [investment bankers] really unable to see any distinction between a golf outing or a dinner with a favored client and a payoff of several hundred thousand dollars? ” (p. A 23). Social norms, including rules of fairness, are rules of behavior enforced by the community. They often make their way into the law. People who violate rules of fairness that are enshrined in th...|$|E

5000|$|Following {{a fourth}} {{incarnation}} as a warehouse and city social services agency, the Hendler Creamery buildings are, {{as of the}} spring of 2014, being planned for refurbishment. The Commercial Group, a Maryland-based real estate and construction company, bought the building in 2012 for $1.08 million, and is planning a $45 million adaptive re-use, featuring 276 units, along with up to 11,000 sq ft of retail. The project includes exclusive amenities such as multiple outdoor courtyards, a pool deck overlooking the Baltimore skyline, basketball courts, and a yoga studio. Kirby Fowler, president of Downtown Partnership of Baltimore Inc., said redevelopment of the Hendler building {{would be the next}} chapter in a decade-long revival for Jonestown. “When <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> what <b>that</b> area used to be like 12 years ago, we’ve gone lightyears toward improvement,” Fowler said. “Albermarle Square four blocks away is this incredibly progressive mixed-income project that came as the result of some HUD money and federal support, and it’s really helped expand Little Italy and Fells Point further north. There’s already progress heading in that direction, and this just continues that.” ...|$|R
