40|$|Reference {{uses of the}} "bibliographic utilities, " as the {{networks}} were most commonly {{referred to in the}} early years, were recognized by reference librarians almost from the moment these services went online. Richard Blood (1977) published a pioneering article that explored the reference potential of OCLC. In rapid succession, other works appeared in the literature describing the usefulness of WLN as a reference tool and praising RLIN's value as well. All of these writings enthusiastically endorsed the use of the utilities in reference (Farmer, 1982; Woods, 1979). In fact, this body of writing might best be characterized as being nearly evangelical in nature: "Spread the word that RLIN (or OCLC) works well at the reference desk; look at what we have done and what <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do; <b>join</b> <b>the</b> revolution " (Bennett, 1986, p. 476).

5000|$|Sui He said, [...] "The King of Han {{sends me}} {{to deliver a}} message to you. I'm curious why you're so close to Chu." [...] Ying Bu responded that he had all along been serving Xiang Yu. Sui He said, [...] "Both you and Xiang Yu are vassal kings. You're willing to be subservient to him because you feel that Chu is {{powerful}} and can be relied on. When Xiang Yu was attacking Qi, he fought ahead of his men. You should personally lead Huainan's forces and fight as Chu's vanguard. Yet now you only send 4,000 men to assist Chu, is this what a subordinate should do? When the King of Han was attacking Chu's capital Pengcheng, you should lead your men to help Xiang Yu and fight with the King of Han day and night. You have a large army but you don't send troops to help and would rather stand by and watch. Is this what a subordinate should do? You are subordinate to Chu in name, but actually you rely on yourself. I feel that this won't be good for you. You refuse to betray Chu because you think that Han is weak. However, although Chu is powerful, Xiang Yu has lost the people's trust when he broke his promises and murdered Emperor Yi, and now he still thinks that his state is strong and he can win any battle. The King of Han is recruiting other vassal lords, and garrisoning in Chenggao and Xingyang. His supply routes from Shu avoid deep trenches and are well defended. When Chu recall its forces, it is separated by Liang in between and is 800-900 li within enemy territory. Now Chu is unable to fight well and is exhausted. Its old and weak soldiers are transporting supplies over great distances. When Chu forces reach Xingyang and Chenggao, Han forces only need {{to put up a}} firm defence. In this way, Chu forces can neither advance by attacking nor retreat. Therefore, I say that Chu is unreliable. If Chu wins Han, other vassal states will help each other for fear of Chu. As such, we can see that if Chu becomes more powerful, it will invite hostility from many sides. It's obvious that Chu is worse than Han. I'm puzzled as to why you choose to depend on Chu, which is at stake, instead of Han, which has nothing to lose. I don't think that Huainan's forces are sufficient to resist Chu, but if you betray Chu, Xiang Yu will be held up in Qi for several months, and Han has higher chances of taking over the empire. I sincerely hope <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>join</b> <b>the</b> King of Han. He'll grant you a fief larger than the current Huainan you have. As such, he sends me to present this plan to you and hope that you'll consider it." [...] Ying Bu agreed but he kept silent about his defection.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays the {{business}} world {{is no longer the}} exclusive province of men as more and more women are taking up the option of self-employment and setting up businesses themselves. Have you every thought about starting up in business? If you have, then this book is for you. This is an exciting time for women now that the changing nature of work is beginning to open up new opportunities and challenges. In particular, it is emerging that business really does matter for women. Business is becoming a real career option for women and an important means of self-advancement, fulfilment and economic independence. Increasingly, business is being seen as a possibl solution to problems arising from unemployment, redundancy, emigration or attempts to return to work after raising a family. Many women too see business as a more attractive alternative than attempting to overcome barriers to advancement in traditional organisations. In the USE, for example, women are going into business for themselves at twice the rate of men. In Ireland too, despite the unemployment statistics, and the gloomy headlines on recession, there are many opportunities for new businesses. Many women are exploiting this potential with women-owned businesses being the fastest growing sector, particularly in the service area. The entrepreneurial spirit is not new for women. Down through the years women have been involved in small-scale enterprises. Women have often been the silent partners with their spouses in running a small business or farm enterprise. Nowadays, however, women are taking a more public and prominent role in the world of business. These women entrepreneurs are not superwomen different from the ordinary community of women. They are women like yourself and <b>you</b> too <b>can</b> <b>join</b> them. <b>The</b> advice from successful Irish business women is {{that if you have a}} good idea for a business you should just go ahead and do it. It is important to have a positive approach and a positive self-image and to believe in your ability to be successful. Most importantly, these women emphasise that {{the business}} idea is vital, that you must know what you are setting out to do, be well-prepared, have done your homework and, above all else, you must plan. The key to success is realism and 'intelligent planned anticipation'...|$|R
