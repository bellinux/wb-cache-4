500|$|In the {{original}} poem, the verse says [...] "Without {{going out of}} my door, I can know the ways of heaven." [...] And so to prevent any misinterpretations – and also to make the song a bit longer – I did repeat that as a second verse but made it: [...] "Without going out of your door / <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>know</b> all things on earth / Without looking out of your window / <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>know</b> the ways of heaven" [...] – so that it included everybody.|$|E
500|$|Ludwig van Beethoven's meditations on illness, {{conscience}} and mortality in the Late String Quartets {{led to his}} dedicating the third movement of String Quartet in A Minor (1825) Op. 132 (see String Quartet No. 15) as a [...] "Hymn of Thanksgiving to God of a convalescent". John Lennon's work [...] "Imagine" [...] owes much of its popular appeal to its evocation of conscience against the atrocities created by war, religious fundamentalism and politics. The Beatles George Harrison-written track [...] "The Inner Light" [...] sets to Indian raga music a verse from the Tao Te Ching that [...] "without going out of your door <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>know</b> the ways of heaven'. In the 1986 movie The Mission the guilty {{conscience and}} penance of the slave trader Mendoza is made more poignant by the haunting oboe music of Ennio Morricone ("On Earth {{as it is in}} Heaven") The song Sweet Lullaby by Deep Forest is based on a traditional Baegu lullaby from the Solomon Islands called [...] "Rorogwela" [...] in which a young orphan is comforted as an act of conscience by his older brother. The Dream Academy song 'Forest Fire' provided an early warning of the moral dangers of our 'black cloud' 'bringing down a different kind of weather... letting the sunshine in, that's how the end begins." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rowling {{has also}} {{maintained}} that Harry is a suitable real-life {{role model for}} children. [...] "The advantage of a fictional hero or heroine is that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>know</b> them better than <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>know</b> a living hero, many of whom you would never meet [...] if people like Harry and identify with him, I am pleased, because I think he is very likeable." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cameron {{had already}} {{published}} magazine articles and a literary book, Faces of Leacock, a 1967 {{study of the}} great Canadian humorist, {{but now he was}} finally free to begin his apprenticeship as a full-time writer. For him, D'Escousse was an ideal home base. [...] "For a writer," [...] Cameron writes, [...] "the great benefit of a village is the way <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>know</b> people." [...] He added that in cities, writers are inevitably drawn into limited circles, but villages let them escape. [...] "My friends in D'Escousse include welders, fishermen, millwrights and mothers on welfare as well as teachers, potters, priests and businessmen." [...] Moreover, a writer who lives in a village watches people change and grow. [...] "An electrician becomes a politician, schoolboys become truckers and contractors, middle-aged civil servants retire and old people take their departures. Knowing them year by year, I can grasp something of the flow of their lives." ...|$|E
