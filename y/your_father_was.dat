6000|$|... "I didn't see {{you when}} I visited your family. They {{said you were}} at college. <b>Your</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> William Elbl, my mother's brother." ...|$|E
60|$|MATTHEW [sullenly]. What call {{have you}} to look down on me? I suppose you think you're {{everybody}} because <b>your</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> a land agent.|$|E
60|$|LADY CHESHIRE. I'm afraid <b>your</b> <b>father's</b> <b>been</b> {{talking to}} you, Bill.|$|R
60|$|LESLIE. <b>Your</b> <b>father</b> <b>is</b> {{trying to}} speak. I'll wager he echoes you.|$|R
60|$|McCOMAS (emphatically). Thank you, Mrs. Clandon. Thank you. (To Dolly.) <b>Your</b> <b>father</b> <b>is</b> fifty-seven.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very likely not," [...] Girdlestone answered, with an irrepressible sneer. [...] "The {{question}} is, did you {{do anything}} that <b>your</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> ashamed of?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you mean}} to tell me <b>your</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> sich a tenderfoot as to come down through this way without any outfit?" [...] Robinson asked sternly.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} been out since <b>your</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> taken down," [...] said Mrs. Upton. [...] "You'll have to asked Harry Parker and your other friends." ...|$|E
5000|$|Tor dadaa ke naak chunavti, huchurrraaaa!the nose of <b>your</b> <b>father</b> <b>be</b> {{marginally}} cut, Come On! ...|$|R
60|$|CUTHBERTSON. What {{has become}} of you, Miss Craven? <b>Your</b> <b>father</b> <b>is</b> getting quite uneasy. We're all waiting for you.|$|R
60|$|LADY BRITOMART. Be quiet, Charles. Now {{listen to}} me, children. <b>Your</b> <b>father</b> <b>is</b> coming here this evening. [General stupefaction].|$|R
6000|$|... "On Saturday he came again. <b>Your</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> gone, {{your uncle}} at home, and, as I said before, {{they had a}} great deal of talk together.|$|E
6000|$|Then {{the mother}} broke into sobs and tears. 'Oh, you wretched boy! What have you done? <b>Your</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> in that straw, {{and you have}} killed him!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And then Susan gave up. 'We cannot save him! Oh, if <b>your</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> here--look at him, {{the poor}} little fellow! I know not what to do.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Peter Littleson!" [...] he interrupted. [...] "But he <b>is</b> one of <b>your</b> <b>father's</b> allies! He and Bardsley and Weiss and <b>your</b> <b>father</b> <b>are</b> {{what they}} call here 'The Invincibles!'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, Ann, <b>your</b> <b>father</b> <b>is</b> different. He likes fusses. I've known <b>your</b> <b>father</b> {{contradict}} a man weighing {{two hundred}} pounds {{out of sheer}} exuberance. There's a lot of <b>your</b> <b>father</b> in you, Ann. I've often noticed it." ...|$|R
6000|$|With {{a silent}} laugh, as preface, she replied, [...] "You'll get a-plenty. <b>Your</b> <b>father</b> <b>is</b> all packed, {{impatient}} {{to leave for}} Ordway." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>your</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> a rich man." [...] Mr. Mariner's {{voice was}} high and plaintive. [...] "He made a fortune over here {{before he went to}} England." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{let anybody}} lead {{you into the}} expense of trying to fight this case with the creditors. It wouldn't be any use. <b>Your</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> deeply involved--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{is not so}} old as <b>your</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> when he died, by many years," [...] said Mrs. Grantly, [...] "and I {{think one}} sees that difference." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear," [...] he said, as he {{adjusted}} the copious folds of his nightcap, [...] "there was that John Bold at <b>your</b> <b>father's</b> again to-day. I must say <b>your</b> <b>father</b> <b>is</b> very imprudent." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Likewise knowed yer <b>father</b> when he <b>was</b> a child. Why, my boy Jacob {{there and}} <b>your</b> <b>father</b> <b>were</b> sworn brothers--that they were sure--weren't ye, Jacob?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No--I won't have it. You {{are a good}} {{hard-working}} darling child, and <b>your</b> <b>father</b> <b>is</b> not the man {{to disappoint}} you when you--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How should I know? Doubtless {{some that}} <b>your</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> taking to London {{and did not}} desire to lose. His iron chest stands open in his chamber." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} my {{presence}} should have annoyed you," [...] I said. [...] "It {{was quite an}} accident. I entered the room thinking <b>your</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is very odd," [...] he said; [...] "I {{thought you}} knew that <b>your</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> {{going to ask me}} down. I {{returned}} from London with him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Miss Sampson, <b>your</b> <b>father</b> <b>is</b> {{the leader}} of this gang of rustlers I have been tracing. Your cousin George Wright, is his {{right-hand}} man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{it would}} seem, if <b>your</b> <b>father</b> <b>is</b> telling you secrets {{all the time}} you are smoking together. But where is this land, Dirck?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "D----n <b>your</b> <b>father,</b> my dear, as I remarked before. And, as {{a matter}} of fact, <b>your</b> <b>father</b> <b>is</b> {{not going to be in}} the way at all. He goes to Kecskem√©t by the night train." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sally Kittridge! Sally Kittridge!" [...] she called, [...] "come {{back this}} minute. What are you about? I should think <b>your</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> {{old enough to}} know better." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What a {{beautiful}} stretch of country," [...] observed Fred, as he gazed around. [...] "I don't wonder that your uncle settled here while <b>your</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> in Africa." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I do not {{understand}} what kind of secret remembrance you mean to infer that <b>your</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> a prey to,' she returned, after a silence. 'You speak so mysteriously.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Don't be afraid, my dear,' {{said her}} aunt. 'Mr. Bulfinch knows that <b>your</b> <b>father</b> <b>is</b> in no {{condition}} {{to have such}} matters brought before him.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Eh? Yes, to be sure, my dear. You know <b>your</b> <b>father</b> <b>is</b> {{almost always}} away now, and {{therefore}} I must write {{to him about}} it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You might,--might do anything. You {{ought to}} do something. You know that you ought. You know that <b>your</b> <b>father</b> <b>is</b> right in what he says." ...|$|R
