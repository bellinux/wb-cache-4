25|$|I admire {{a lot of}} what's {{going on}} out there, but the {{oversize}} kind of cartoon action movies is not something I'm terribly comfortable with. I think what I do is much more in the tradition that the bullets are real and they'll knock you down. I used to really get criticized for my lack of realism, but now I think my films {{are perceived to be}} vastly more realistic than most of the action movies that are happening out there... I {{think one of the things}} about being a director is, you should always try to re-create within yourself the kind of emotions you had watching film when <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>very</b> young. The kind of action movies that I always liked, the kind of comic books I always liked, were the serious ones. The characters were very realistic within the framework of the drama, and that kind of action movie interests me a lot more than the super-heroes. And so in that sense, maybe I'm slightly out of step, I suppose, but so be it.|$|E

2500|$|As Marla Heasley recounts in Bring Back... The A-Team (May 18, 2006), {{although}} sexism was not prevalent {{on the set}} per se, {{there was}} a sense that a female character was not necessary on the show. On her first day on set George Peppard took her aside and told her [...] "We don't want you on the show. None of the guys want you here. The only reason you're here is because the network and the producers want you. For some reason they think they need a girl." [...] The interview continues with Heasley noting that on her last day of work Peppard took her aside again, saying: [...] "I'm sorry that this is your last day, but remember what I said the very first day, that we didn't want a girl, has nothing to do with you. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>very</b> professional, but no reason to have a girl." [...] In Bring Back... the A-Team, Dirk Benedict also remarked that: [...] "It was a guy's show. It was male driven. It was written by guys. It was directed by guys. It was acted by guys. It's about what guys do. We talked the way guys talked. We were the boss. We were the God. We smoked when we wanted. We shot guns when we wanted. We kissed the girls and made them cry... when we wanted. It was the last truly masculine show." ...|$|E
60|$|STRANGWAY. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>very</b> good to come; but I {{would rather}} not.|$|E
60|$|FAITH. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>very</b> kind to me. But {{you don't}} see; nobody sees.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>am</b> rather muddled; <b>you</b> {{have too}} many things; one seems to {{contradict}} another. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> artistic and yet <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> prosaic; <b>you</b> have what <b>is</b> called a 'catholic' taste and yet <b>you</b> <b>are</b> full of obstinate little prejudices and habits of thought, which, if I knew you, I should find very tiresome. I don't think I like you." ...|$|R
60|$|LADY STUTFIELD. Every one I know says <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>very,</b> very wicked.|$|R
6000|$|... 'But {{there are}} many places of shelter near here. This,' {{referring}} to the little porch, 'is better than where <b>you</b> <b>were.</b> <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> welcome to rest here.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you," [...] she answered, piteously. And she added, with {{superficial}} inconsequence, [...] "I shall {{always think}} <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>very</b> cruel." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Campbell: [...] "We weren't enjoying ourselves. It was {{the deadliest}} {{thing that ever}} was, and <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>very</b> lucky to escape." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Have {{you been}} {{considering}} the professor?" [...] she asked, with a smile. [...] "I noticed that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>very</b> gracious to him yesterday." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I guessed. You {{were going}} to say that I must have heard your criticisms in the train. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>very</b> lenient, I thought." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, Lizzie,' said Anne, {{recovering}} her breath, 'I hope, as Helen says, {{you have}} had a pleasant evening; I hope <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>very</b> much edified.' ...|$|E

60|$|JULIA.--Hush, hush! I {{know they}} were taken. I know <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>very</b> good to us. You helped my poor papa out of many a difficulty.|$|E
6000|$|... "Out in the {{sunlight}} there, when my eyes were red, <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>very</b> anxious to look at me," [...] she added, in a dangerous voice.|$|E
6000|$|... "You <b>are</b> <b>very</b> pretty"--she says, we will suppose, {{addressing}} the dolls--"and {{you look very}} amiable. I suppose <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> amiable." ...|$|R
60|$|SYBIL [talking too much]. Mrs. Shand, I think <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> kind {{to take it}} so reasonably.|$|R

6000|$|Mrs. Wilcox took {{occasion}} {{one day to}} remonstrate {{with her}} niece. [...] "Elsie, <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>very</b> rude to Captain Curtis again to-day. He was deeply hurt." ...|$|E
