5|$|There are {{numerous}} bus operators within Sheffield: First South <b>Yorkshire,</b> Stagecoach <b>Yorkshire,</b> TM Travel, Hulleys of Baslow, Powells, G Holmes and Sheffield Community Transport. First South <b>Yorkshire,</b> became {{by far the}} largest bus operator and in recent years implemented a series of fare rises and service cuts which saw bus ridership drop. Recent developments have seen Stagecoach Sheffield taking over <b>Yorkshire</b> Terrier, Andrews and parent company <b>Yorkshire</b> Traction, thus forming one company and in the process expanding their bus services in the city. This has resulted in increased competition, and price drops on certain routes. A zero-fare bus service, the FreeBee (Operated by First South <b>Yorkshire),</b> operated a circular route around the city centre from the Sheffield Interchange. The FreeBee buses stopped in 2014 and is due to save £8 million.|$|E

5|$|After his {{retirement}} from the <b>Yorkshire</b> team, Leyland returned {{to play for}} Harrogate until 1950, when he became chief coach, along with Arthur Mitchell, at <b>Yorkshire.</b> Mitchell was a dour, serious man but the contrast with the cheerier Leyland made an effective partnership. Leyland {{also served as a}} representative of the paper manufacturers Thomas Owen. In 1949, he was among the first group of former professional cricketers to be awarded honorary membership of the MCC. He continued as a respected coach of <b>Yorkshire</b> until illness forced {{his retirement}} in 1963. Suffering from Parkinson's disease, he maintained some connections with <b>Yorkshire</b> cricket and always tried to attend matches played at Harrogate. In recognition of his achievements, the Harrogate grounds erected new gates which were named in his honour. Leyland died in a hospital at Knaresborough on 1 January 1967.|$|E
5|$|After {{scoring a}} second century for Mitchell Main {{at the start}} of the 1910 season, Kilner was chosen to play for <b>Yorkshire</b> Second XI. In his first season, he took three wickets and had a batting average of 12.50 but {{continued}} to do well for Mitchell Main. For 1911, <b>Yorkshire</b> sent Kilner to play for Harrogate Cricket Club which provided a higher standard of cricket than Mitchell Main: the county had a system whereby promising young players were sent to gain experience in competitive matches for local clubs. Kilner began to record good batting and bowling performances. Although his form for <b>Yorkshire</b> Second XI was more inconsistent, he made his first-class debut for <b>Yorkshire</b> that season against Somerset in the County Championship. He scored 0 and 14 and did not bowl. In a further six matches for <b>Yorkshire</b> in 1911, his highest innings was 18 runs, his average with the bat was just 6.66 in ten innings and he did not take any wickets. For Harrogate, he was more successful, with 519 runs and 28 wickets.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1927 season, <b>Yorkshire</b> secretary Frederick Toone approached Wilfred Rhodes to suggest that he should resign from his position as senior professional. Rhodes declined, prompted by his wife's suspicion of a plot against him. This may have been an attempt by <b>Yorkshire</b> to clear the way for a new captain. Lord Hawke was in favour of appointing Herbert Sutcliffe, a professional who had opened the batting for <b>Yorkshire</b> since 1919. In addition to Rhodes, other professionals on the side had debuted for <b>Yorkshire</b> earlier than Sutcliffe. However, Sutcliffe was unusual among professionals: he had received a commission in the British Army in the First World War, his appearance was always immaculate and when speaking he altered his accent to fit what he considered a better class of society. Such characteristics were more common among amateur cricketers, and Sutcliffe in many ways behaved like one. While not particularly popular with his teammates, he was respected.|$|E
