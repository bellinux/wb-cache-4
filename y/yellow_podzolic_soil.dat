Average peanut production in Southeast Sulawesi 2014 reached 0. 46 t, {{on the other hand}} average domestic production is 1. 87 t. The decrease in production is caused by decline in land productivity. Low peanut production is caused by soil fertility. Declining soil fertility can be restored by applying organic matter into the soil, but, in a tropical environment, the rate of organic matter decomposition and mineralization take place very quickly, resulting in additional organic material each planting season. Another alternative is to reduce the organic matter decomposition rate and release carbon in the soil through utilizing agricultural and animal waste into biochar which is resistant to corrosion. The experiment was conducted using a randomized block design which consisted of nine treatments and three replications. The results exhibited that straw biochar at 25 %, or 2. 48   t/ha + manure biochar at 75 % equivalent to 5. 87 t/ha was capable of increasing growth and yield rate for peanut varieties Talam 1.

After pasture installation soil bulk density were higher in the first 0 - 5 cm soil layer, mainly in one chronosequence but small changes were detected in deeper soil layers. Forest conversion to pasture caused appreciable increases in soil pH and exchangeable cation content, at least until nine years after pasture installation. pH levels were greater in the first chronosequence, with highest values (6. 8 to 7. 6) found in 3 and 5 years old pastures respectively.

The avera ge of the tota l weed density minus Cyper us rotundus, Oxalis oxyptera and Cynodon da+-ylon was 141, 124, 62 and 59 plants. m² for 0, 0; 0, 35; 0, 70 and 1, 05 kg a. i. ha- 1 metribuzin, respectively. The lowest dose of metri buzin (0, 35 kg a. i. ha- 1) was as sufficient to promote reduction on weed shoot biomass at the highest did (1, 05 kg a. i. ha- 1). However, {{the mean of the}} total weed density was drastically recuded in the doses of 0, 70 and 1, 05 kg a. i. ha- 1. The metribuzin caused damage to soybean plants at highest dose (1, 05 kg a. i. ha- 1) employed with a slight leaf injury '(chlorosis) until 25 days after emergence. After this period it was observed a total recovery of the plants treat ed with this dose. The yield and the harvest index were not affected by doses of metribuzin...|$|E

50|$|Brown <b>podzolic</b> <b>soils</b> are a {{subdivision}} of the <b>Podzolic</b> <b>soils</b> in the British soil classification. Although classed with podzols {{because they have}} an iron-rich, or spodic horizon, they are, in fact intermediate between podzols and Brown earths. They are common on hilly land in western Europe, in climates where precipitation of more than about 900mm exceeds evapotranspiration for {{a large part of}} the year, and summers are relatively cool. The result is that leaching of the soil profile occurs; in which mobile chemicals are washed out of the topsoil, or A horizon, and accumulate lower down, in the B horizon.|$|R
40|$|Este trabalho apresenta resultados da tendência de movimento de tebuthiuron e {{aldicarb}} aplicados em cana-de-açúcar e banana respectivamente, no perfil vertical de solos de área da região Submédio São Francisco com lençóis subterrâneos encontrados a partir de 1, 5 m de profundidade. Os solos analisados foram: Latossolo Amarelo Distrófico, Latossolo Amarelo Eutrófico, Latossolo Vermelho Eutrófico, Argissolo Vermelho-Amarelo Distrófico, Argissolo Vermelho-Amarelo Eutrófico, Argissolo Amarelo Álico, Argissolo Amarelo Distrófico, Argissolo Amarelo Eutrófico, Argissolo Acinzentado Álico, Planossolo Eutrófico, Neossolo Quartzarênico Distrófico e Neossolo Quartzarênico Álico. A movimentação foi acompanhada por simulação de sistemas para um período de três anos consecutivos, após uma única aplicação, em cenários separados por cultura e tipo de solo. Os resultados indicaram maior tendência de lixiviação de tebuthiuron e de aldicarb em Latossolo Vermelho Eutrófico, Neossolo Quartzarênico Distrófico e Neossolo Quartzarênico Álico. Não há indicativos de risco para a saúde humana, conforme padrão de referência da diretiva 89 / 778 /EEC, para ambos os produtos nos cenários analisados.

The soils analyzed were: Distrophic Red Yellow Latosol (Typic Haplorthox); Eutrophic Yellow Latosol (Typic Eutrorthox); Eutrophic Red Yellow Latosol (Typic Eutrorthox); Distrophic Red <b>Yellow</b> <b>Podzolic</b> (Typic Kandiustults -Soil); Eutrophic Red <b>Yellow</b> <b>Podzolic</b> (Typic Haplustults); Alic <b>Yellow</b> <b>Podzolic</b> (Typic Kandiustults); Distrophic <b>Yellow</b> <b>Podzolic</b> (Typic Kandiustults); Eutrophic <b>Yellow</b> <b>Podzolic</b> (Typic Haplustults); Alic Gray Podzolic (Typic Haplohumults); Eutrophic Planosol (Typic Albaquults); Distrophic Quartzous Sand (Typic Quartzipsament); Alic Quartzous Sand (Typic Quartzipsament). The movement of each product was followed by simulation during a period of three consecutive years after only one application of the pesticide, in separate scenarios for specific crop and soil type. The results showed main tendencies of tebuthiuron and aldicarb leaching in the Eutrophic Yellow Latosol, Distrophic Quartzous Sand and Alic Quartzous Sand.

40|$|Soil cover {{transformation}} and changes of morphological and chemical properties of Albeluvisols in clear-cuttings of middle taiga spruce forests were studied. The observed changes in structure and properties of <b>podzolic</b> texturally-differentiated <b>soils</b> at cuttings of spruce {{forests in the}} middle taiga subzone do not cause their transition to any other soil type. Soil cover of secondary deciduous-coniferous forests which replace cut forests are characterized with a varied soil contour and {{a combination of the}} main type of <b>podzolic</b> <b>soils</b> under undisturbed spruce forests. The increased surface hydromorphism in cut areas causes formation of complicated sub-types of <b>podzolic</b> texturally differentiated <b>soils</b> (<b>podzolic</b> surface-gley <b>soils</b> with microprofile of podzol) and enlarges their ratio (up to 35 – 38 %) in soil cover structure. Temporary soil over-wetting at the initial (5 – 10 years) stage of after-cutting self-restoring vegetation succession provides for soil gleyzation, improves yield and segregation of iron compounds, increases the migratory activity of humic substances. Low content and resources of total nitrogen in forest litters mark anthropogenic transformation processes of <b>podzolic</b> <b>soils</b> at this stage. Later (in 30 – 40 years after logging), soils in cut areas still retain signs of hydromorphism. Forest litters are denser, less acidic and thick with a low weight ratio of organic carbon as compared with Albeluvisols of undisturbed spruce forest. The upper mineral soil horizons under secondary deciduous-coniferous forests contain larger amounts of total iron, its mobile (oxalate-dissolvable) components, and Fe-Mn-concretions...|$|R

Microbial biomass and activity were significantly higher in <b>podzolic</b> <b>soils</b> with Nardus dominated vegetation, than in brown earth soils with Agrostis-Festuca vegetation. Phospholipid fatty acid analysis (PLEA) revealed differences in microbial community structure between soils. The ratio of fungal-to-bacterial fatty acids was higher in the brown earth than in the <b>podzolic</b> <b>soil,</b> whereas the diversity (Shannon-Weaver index) of PLFAs was greater in the <b>podzolic</b> <b>soil.</b> A {{large proportion of the}} microbial biomass (50 %) and activity (40 - 70 %) was within the surface 0 - 5 cm soil, with reduced amounts at lower depths of 5 - 10 cm and 10 - 15 cm. Microbial biomass and activity and nematode abundance showed pronounced summer maxima and winter minima. The long-term removal of sheep grazing from both grassland types resulted in significant reductions in microbial biomass and activity in the surface soil. The abundance of active soil fungi, measured as the fungal fatty acid 18 : 2 omega 6, was significantly reduced by the removal of sheep grazing, as was the ratio of fungal-to-bacterial fatty acids. Bacterial fatty acids were unaffected by the removal of sheep grazing. Possible mechanisms for these changes are discussed. Numbers of soil nematodes were significantly lower in the ungrazed sites. The effects of removing sheep grazing on nematodes and microbial community structure were most pronounced in brown earth soils. Factors responsible for these changes are discussed.
