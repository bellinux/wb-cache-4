500|$|Bushnell {{felt that}} Pong was {{especially}} significant in {{its role as}} a social lubricant, since it was multiplayer-only and did not require each player to use more than one hand: [...] "It was very common to have a girl with a quarter in hand pull a guy off a bar stool and say, 'I'd like to play Pong and there's nobody to play.' It was a way you could play games, you were sitting shoulder to shoulder, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk,</b> you could laugh, you could challenge each other ... As you became better friends, you could put down your beer and hug. You could put your arm around the person. You could play left-handed if you so desired. In fact, {{there are a lot of}} people who have come up to me over the years and said, 'I met my wife playing Pong,' and that's kind of a nice thing to have achieved." ...|$|E
500|$|The regular Football League {{restarted}} in {{time for}} the 1946–47 season. Ramsey moved into club-owned lodgings in Southampton with a close friend from the army, Alf Freeman, an inside-forward who had also signed for the club. Ramsey started the season in the reserve team, selected at centre-forward, and scored in each of the first three games. After five matches, Dodgin and the club trainer Sydney Cann made a decision that changed the course of Ramsey's entire professional playing career: deciding that neither centre-half nor centre-forward truly suited him, they moved him to right-back. McKinstry calls this [...] "exactly the right place for Alf", citing Ramsey's tactical knowledge and fine passing. A close master-and-pupil relationship developed between Ramsey and Cann, who had played at full-back for Torquay United, Manchester City and Charlton Athletic. During training sessions, the two had long discussions about tactics and individual techniques. [...] wanted to learn about the game from top to bottom," [...] Cann recalled; [...] "I have never known anyone with the same quickness of learning as Alf Ramsey. He would never accept anything on its face value... He was the type of player who was a manager's dream because <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> about a decision and he would accept it and there it was, in his game." ...|$|E

[...] The writer and critic Michael Coveney knew Glazier as demanding , irascible, impatient but full of charm", someone who [...] "epitomised 's spirit of tolerance, intellectual curiosity, fast living and taste for the high life".|$|E

2500|$|In April 2010, while Congress was {{considering}} financial reform legislation, a reporter asked McConnell {{if he was}} [...] "doing the bidding of the large banks." [...] McConnell has received more money in donations from the [...] "Finance, Insurance and Real Estate" [...] sector than any other sector according to the Center for Responsive Politics. McConnell responded [...] "I'd say that that's inaccurate. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> to the community bankers in Kentucky." [...] The Democratic Party's plan for financial reform is actually a way to institute [...] "endless taxpayer funded bailouts for big Wall Street banks", said McConnell. He {{expressed concern that the}} proposed $50 billion, bank-funded fund that would be used to liquidate financial firms that could collapse [...] "would of course immediately signal to everyone that the government is ready to bail out large banks". In McConnell's home state of Kentucky, the Lexington Herald-Leader ran an editorial saying: [...] "We have read that the Republicans have a plan for financial reform, but McConnell isn't talking up any solutions, just trashing the other side's ideas with no respect for the truth." [...] According to one tally, McConnell's largest donor from the period from January 1, 2009, to September 30, 2015, was Bob McNair, contributing $1,502,500.|$|E

Edward Condon, June 1949. Condon opposed any cooperation with Congressional attempts to identify security risks within the scientific community. In June 1949, in a sharply critical letter to Oppenheimer, who had provided information to HUAC about a colleague, he wrote: [...] "I {{have lost a}} good deal of sleep trying to figure out how <b>you</b> <b>could</b> have <b>talked</b> this way about a man whom you have known for so long, and of whom you know so well what a good physicist and good citizen he is." [...] In July 1949, he testified before a Senate subcommittee that was considering rules governing the operation of Senate committees. He criticized Thomas and the HUAC for holding closed hearings and then leaking information that denigrated his loyalty and that of other scientists. He said that the committee denied his and his colleagues' requests for public hearings so they could respond.|$|R

Gemma's mother, Sue, believes this where her Gemma's determined spirit came from; '"I don't think <b>you</b> <b>could</b> ever <b>talk</b> Gemma into or out of anything." [...] Sue Rice still lives on the family property in Guyra and a number of her brothers still live in the area. Basil, Gemma's father, passed away in 2004.|$|R
