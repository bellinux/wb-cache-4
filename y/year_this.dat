5|$|After their year {{of active}} service, Western Han-era {{soldiers}} were demobilized and sent home, {{where they were}} obligated to join the local militia that convened every eighth month of the <b>year.</b> <b>This</b> obligation was intended to curb local and regional warlordism that nonetheless became prevalent {{by the end of}} Han. Militias dismissed members who reached the age of fifty-six. By Eastern Han, the obligation upon retired soldiers to join local militias was removed.|$|E

5|$|Dunstan became {{patron saint}} of English goldsmiths and {{silversmith}}s because {{he worked as a}} silversmith making church plate.

5|$|FETA {{began to}} be {{concerned}} over the structural wear of the bridge in the 21st century.

5|$|Ronald Lockley (1903–2000), {{among many}} studies of birds in over fifty books, pioneered {{the science of}} bird migration.

5|$|The {{fortunes}} of Gray's Inn continued to decline after the English Restoration, and by 1719 only 22 students were joining the Inn a <b>year.</b> <b>This</b> fall in numbers was {{partly because the}} landed gentry were no longer sending sons who {{had no intention of}} becoming barristers to study at the Inn.
