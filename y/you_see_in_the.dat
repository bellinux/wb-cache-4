As well as, you will see… like, for example, Johnny, we could have maybe 10 Johnnys at the same time singing, or playing football. So, the decision have to be made at the time when we actually doing choreography, ‘cause I’ll be doing choreography, as well I’ll be in it only one time, that’s it, as Johnny."

500|$|Srikula adepts {{most often}} worship Lalita using the {{abstract}} Sri Chakra yantra, which {{is regarded as}} her subtle form. The Sri Chakra can be visually rendered either as a two-dimensional diagram (whether drawn temporarily {{as part of the}} worship ritual, or permanently engraved in metal) or in the three-dimensional, pyramidal form known as the Sri Meru. It is not uncommon to find a Sri Chakra or Sri Meru installed in South Indian temples, because – as modern practitioners assert – [...] "there is no disputing that this is the highest form of Devi and that some of the practice can be done openly. But what <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> temples is not the srichakra worship you see when it is done privately." ...|$|E

Although unsure {{what he wanted to}} do with his life, Pirkis was cast for his first professional role in 2003, when he appeared in the successful film, [...] The hire occurred after production staff visited Eton to hire boys for the ship's teenage crew. Pirkis attended a workshop and auditions as [...] "a joke", ultimately securing the part of the 13-year-old, eventually one-armed midshipman Lord Blakeney of HMS Surprise. Director Peter Weir thought Pirkis [...] "stood out very early on, but not to the extent that <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film. That was a complete surprise." [...] According to Pirkis, he was at first [...] "nervous" [...] about acting with Russell Crowe, but changed his mind when he realised that Crowe was [...] "a pretty normal guy." ...|$|E

500|$|The ride {{received}} mostly positive reviews {{upon its}} July 2014 opening. Lance Hart from Screamscape {{was impressed with}} the fact that the King's Cross entrance was hidden from the rest of the Diagon Alley area. He also credited Universal for making the train look as realistic as possible: [...] "Clearly they went to great lengths to create these cars to be replicas of what <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> films, both on the outside as well as on the inside as you move down the hallway towards your cabin to take your seat". In terms of the overall experience Hart said, [...] "Universal has managed to turn what would simply be a method of transporting guests between their two parks into yet another must-see attraction ... tying together the overall story and theme of visiting Hogwarts at Islands of Adventure and Diagon Alley inside Universal Studios Florida".|$|E
500|$|Psycho is now {{considered}} to be the first film in the slasher film genre, and has been referenced in films numerous times; examples include the 1974 musical horror film Phantom of the Paradise, 1978 horror film Halloween (which starred Jamie Lee Curtis, Janet Leigh's daughter), the 1977 Mel Brooks tribute to many of Hitchcock's thrillers, High Anxiety, the 1980 Fade to Black, the 1980 Dressed to Kill and Wes Craven's 1996 horror satire Scream. Bernard Herrmann's opening theme has been sampled by rapper Busta Rhymes on his song [...] "Gimme Some More" [...] (1998).

He wore a back brace and complained of pain in his foot, though friends stated he never disclosed {{the nature of his}} injury. A family member said he had been injured by an improvised explosive device (IED) in Iraq and had been prescribed both antidepressant and anti-anxiety medication, though he was suspected to have since ceased taking the medication. Gonzalez' former step-son said that Gonzalez was [...] "a very good guy" [...] who was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). A family member said Gonzalez was on patrol in Iraq when his Humvee was struck, adding that [...] "a portion of his foot was amputated [...] and the evidence is the limp <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> video of him running across the White House lawn."

500|$|Horowitz {{revealed}} the film would contain many light cycles battles, and {{asserted that the}} script for the scenes were [...] "incredibly detailed", and involved an intricate collaborative process. For the disc game, Horowitz and Kitsis wrote a rough draft of the scene, and sent the script to Kosinski; he summarized his perspective of the sequence's visuals to them. [...] "He described them as these underlying platforms," [...] said Horowitz, [...] "that would then coalesce and then {{the way you would}} go from round to round in the game is you defeat someone, they kinda come together as <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> movie." [...] After giving his intake, Kosinski sent various sketches of the scene to the writers and would often revise the script. Kitsis thought that illustrating the character's stories to be the most difficult task in writing Tron: Legacy. The writers collaborated with the creative process throughout production, which was helpful especially considering the difficulties of describing in a tangible way a digital world that [...] "in its very nature defies basic screenwriting conventions." ...|$|E

[...] "I got well enough to do what <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> parade there, but I couldn't do most of Kenny Ortega's knee spins and things like that that we had worked on. When we did shoot it, we had all this choreography and I remember John would yell with a megaphone, 'Okay, do it again, but don't do any of the choreography,' because he wanted it to be a total mess." [...] "Danke Schoen" [...] was somewhat choreographed but for [...] "Twist and Shout", Broderick said, [...] "we were just making everything up". Hughes explained that much of the scene was spontaneously filmed.

500|$|On May 1 at 1:22p.m., Panetta, {{acting on}} the president's orders, {{directed}} McRaven {{to move forward with}} the operation. Shortly after 3p.m., the president joined national security officials in the Situation Room to monitor the raid. They watched night-vision images taken from a Sentinel drone while Panetta, appearing {{in a corner of the}} screen from CIA headquarters, narrated what was happening. Video links with Panetta at CIA headquarters and McRaven in Afghanistan were set up in the Situation Room. In an adjoining office was the live drone feed presented on a laptop computer operated by Brigadier General Marshall Webb, assistant commander of JSOC. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was one of those in the Situation Room, and described it like this: [...] "Contrary to some news reports and what <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> movies, we had no means to see what was happening inside the building itself. All we could do was wait for an update from the team on the ground. I looked at the President. He was calm. Rarely have I been prouder to serve by his side as I was that day."

Schwarzenegger is shown smoking a marijuana joint after winning Mr. Olympia in the 1975 documentary film Pumping Iron.

2500|$|In 2017, Epic Games {{held its}} annual keynote at the Game Developers Conference to {{showcase}} features and non-gaming {{uses for the}} Unreal Engine. Speaking at the keynote, Industrial Light & Magic's CCO John Knoll and Lucasfilm ADG's Principal Engineer and Architect Naty Hoffman detailed how UE4 was extended to render the droid K-2SO in the 2016 film Rogue One, achieving final pixels on screen while bypassing the traditional pre-rendering process. According to fxguide, the team built on UE4 its own render pipeline, called the ADG's GPU real-time renderer, with which they rendered some shots of the droid that were later included in the film. In an interview with Gamasutra, Tim Sweeney commented: [...] "So final pixels rendered in the Star Wars movie, using the Unreal Engine, in real time. And it went into the movie!

[...] In a Time magazine cover story about the film on December 4, 2005, Spielberg said that the source of the film had second thoughts about his actions.

2500|$|In an {{interview}} on All Things Considered, Yale University history professor Beverly Gage, {{who is writing a}} biography of Hoover, stated that the film accurately conveys that Hoover came to the FBI as a reformer seeking [...] "to clean it up, to professionalize it," [...] and to introduce scientific methods to its investigation, eventually including such practices as fingerprinting and bloodtyping. She praises DiCaprio for conveying the tempo of Hoover's speech. However, she notes that the film's central narrative device in which Hoover dictates his memoirs to FBI agents chosen as writers, is fictitious: [...] "He didn't ever have the sort of formal situation that <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> movie where he was dictating a memoir to a series of young agents, and that that is the official record of the FBI." [...] Historian Aaron J. Stockham of the Waterford School, whose dissertation was on the relationship of the FBI and the US Congress during the Hoover years, wrote on the History News Network of George Mason University, [...] "J. Edgar portrays Hoover as the man who successfully integrated scientific processes into law enforcement investigations.... There is no doubt, from the historical record, that Hoover was instrumental in creating the FBI's scientific reputation." [...] Stockham notes that Hoover probably did not write the FBI–King suicide letter to Martin Luther King, Jr., as the film portrays: [...] "While such a letter was written, Hoover almost certainly delegated it to others within the Bureau." ...|$|E
2500|$|The series uses green {{screen to}} augment the live action, {{inserting}} views of outdoor scenes in windows and broadcast images on TV monitors, often in post-production. The Production Designer, Steve Arnold, also describes in detail {{the use of a}} three-sided green screen to insert street scenes outside car windows, with synchronized LED screens above the car (and out of camera shot), that emit the appropriate light onto the actors and parts of the car, such as window frames: [...] "All the driving in the show, anything inside the vehicle is done on stage, in a room that is a big three-sided green screen space. The car does not move, the actors are in the car, and the cameras are set up around them. We have very long strips of LED monitors hung above the car. We had a camera crew go to Washington, D.C. to drive around and shoot plates for what you see outside when you’re driving. And that is fed into the LED screens above the car. So as the scene is progressing, the LED screens are synched up to emit interactive light to match the light conditions <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> scenery you’re driving past (that will be added in post). All the reflections on the car windows, the window frames and door jambs is being shot while we’re shooting the actors in the car. Then in post the green screens are replaced with the synced up driving plates, and it works really well. It gives you the sense of light passing over the actors’ faces, matching the lighting that is {{in the image of the}} plate".|$|E
