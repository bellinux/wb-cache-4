5|$|A {{hallmark}} of the curriculum in the earliest days was study organized around major themes—trees, Shakespeare, Egypt and other subjects—that built over the school <b>year</b> <b>into</b> major class projects, performances, and all-school gatherings. Many of these themes and events have grown into lasting school traditions, with which the school community has come to identify each group and certain times of year. One the school's most cherished traditions, tapping maple trees to make syrup, began with the move to the new building in 1929. The Spring Fair, in which groups one through five each prepare and perform their own dance, has been held annually since the 1930s—the Maypole dance by the fifth group {{dates back to the}} beginning of the Cottage School.|$|E

5|$|A routine became {{established}} in which salesmen {{would provide the}} duckers with labels. The duckers would mark their ducklings with the labels of the firm to whom they wished them to be sold in London. The railway companies would collect ducklings, {{take them to the}} stations, ship them to London and deliver them to the designated firms, in return for a flat fee per bird. By avoiding the need for the duckers to travel to market, or the London salesmen to collect the ducklings, this arrangement benefited all concerned, and ducking became very profitable. By 1870 the duck industry was bringing over £20,000 per <b>year</b> <b>into</b> Aylesbury; a typical ducker would make a profit of around £80–£200 per year.|$|E
5|$|A <b>year</b> <b>into</b> development, Activision {{proposed}} that Black Lotus be made {{part of an}} existing franchise and highlighted similarities to the True Crime series; both games were set in open worlds with plots centred on an undercover cop in a criminal organization. Sales of previous True Crime games had been disappointing, but Activision felt the innovations in Black Lotus could revitalize the franchise and make the game successful in its own right. Activision attached the game to the series and revealed {{it to the public}} as True Crime: Hong Kong in November 2009. They delayed the game until 2010 to allow further refinement. During this period Hollywood action editor Tony Ciccone was hired to consult on the game's visual identity and animations.|$|E
5|$|Before 1923, Coghlan {{had opposed}} the {{amalgamation}} of Northern and Southern Rhodesia, concerned {{that it would}} make responsible government harder to attain. One outcome of the Jameson Raid in 1895–96 had been to prevent the concentration of the BSAC into one administration. Instead, the High Commission in Bechuanaland was maintained, Northern Rhodesia kept its own administration, and Britain oversaw BSAC affairs more closely. One <b>year</b> <b>into</b> his premiership, Coghlan began to consider territorial expansion and staked a claim to northwestern Bechuanaland. The Dominions Office rejected the claim {{on the grounds that the}} Union of South Africa would respond with its own claim for the southern half of the territory.|$|E

5|$|Congress {{began the}} task of {{restoring}} federal coins to circulation in 1864 with a two-cent piece in bronze, and by authorizing a three-cent piece in copper-nickel the following year. In 1866, it authorized a five-cent piece in the latter alloy, the nickel, as {{it has come to}} be known. With the three-cent silver effectively replaced by base-metal pieces, it did not share in the increased mintage of silver coins that began in 1868. The three-cent silver was struck at the rate of a few thousand per <b>year</b> <b>into</b> the 1870s.|$|E
5|$|Rodin {{began the}} project in 1884, {{inspired}} by the chronicles of the siege by Jean Froissart.

One <b>year</b> <b>into</b> the commission, the Calais committee was not impressed with Rodin's progress. Rodin indicated his willingness to end the project rather than change his design to meet the committee's conservative expectations, but Calais said to continue.|$|E

The site's data go back to 1982, and in every year the winter season has had the lowest box office grosses. The weakest winter was 1983, when The Entitys $13 million take led the way to a total of $93.4 million in {{domestic}} grosses for all movies released during that season. On the other end, 2012 had the strongest winter, at $1.24 billion, topped by Safe House, which took in $124 million.|$|E

5|$|Although Arsenal {{was founded}} in 1886, {{it was not until}} 1897 that the club {{appointed}} a permanent manager in charge of first-team affairs, with Thomas Mitchell universally recognised as Arsenal's first professional manager. Mitchell joined Arsenal five months after resigning from Blackburn Rovers in October 1896. The Scotsman's time at Woolwich Arsenal was brief and he left his post barely a <b>year</b> <b>into</b> his contract, though he did manage to take the club from tenth to fifth in the league. Mitchell guided Arsenal through a respectable cup run which culminated in the first round proper. William Elcoat succeeded Mitchell as manager in April 1898, and set about reviving the squad with new additions. The changes did not have the desired effect; his team finished seventh in a league of 18 and were beaten 6–0 by Derby County in the FA Cup first round. He departed in February 1899, and like his predecessor only remained for a season.|$|E

His first match was away against Queensland where he scored 22 and 45, making three stumpings, taking one catch and {{performing}} one run out, followed by scores {{of one and}} 33 in the home match, together with two stumpings. He scored 35 and four at home against Victoria, and then 45 in the second innings of the away match. On 22 November 1940, barely a <b>year</b> <b>into</b> Saggers' career, New South Wales faced a combined Queensland-Victoria team at Brisbane. Saggers scored 58 as his team reached 429 {{in response to the}} oppositions 202 all out. In the Queensland-Victoria team's second innings, where they reached 416, Saggers equalled the world record for most dismissals in an innings, taking seven catches. Saggers then went on to score 47 against South Australia, and 68 against Queensland on 1 January 1941. In his final match before the outbreak of World War II, Saggers scored 63 runs against South Australia. He ended the season with 18 catches with the gloves and 13stumpings.|$|E
5|$|In the 850s, {{the most}} {{persistent}} {{threats to the}} Empire were the emirate of Melitene (Malatya) under Umar al-Aqta, the emirate of Tarsus under Ali ibn Yahya ("Ali the Armenian"), the emirate of Qaliqala (Theodosiopolis, modern Erzurum) and the Paulicians of Tephrike under their leader Karbeas. Melitene, in particular, was {{a major threat to}} Byzantium as its location on the western side of the Anti-Taurus range allowed direct access to the Anatolian plateau. An indication of the threat posed by these states came in 860, when their combined actions turned the <b>year</b> <b>into</b> a veritable annus horribilis for the Byzantines: Umar and Karbeas raided deep into Asia Minor and returned with much plunder; they were followed shortly after by another raid by the forces of Tarsus under Ali, while a naval attack from Syria sacked the major Byzantine naval base at Attaleia.|$|E
5|$|Keenly {{interested}} in the well-being of citizens and affairs related {{to the development of}} the growing town, he was nominated for and eventually elected to Edmonton Town Council as an alderman in 1903, finishing first of nine candidates, with 421 votes. His term was to last two years, but was truncated by a year by Edmonton's incorporation as a city, which meant that the entire city council was elected afresh in the 1904 election. In that election he was again elected to a two-year term, finishing first of seventeen candidates, but this time resigned one <b>year</b> <b>into</b> his term in order to run for mayor in the 1905 election. May's time on council included the time in which Alberta was incorporated as a province; as an alderman he voiced his support for a lavish celebration to be in Edmonton, which was to be the capital city of the new province. While sitting on council, he also voted against a proposed bylaw that would have permitted suffrage for women in civic elections; he had initially voted in favour of the law, but had later reconsidered and reversed his vote, effectively killing the bill. The vote previously had been in favour of the bill, by a margin of one vote.|$|E

5|$|Rumors {{surfaced}} about difficulties {{regarding the}} special effects. By a <b>year</b> <b>into</b> the production, {{millions of dollars}} had been spent, yet almost no usable footage had been created; Abel and Associates was not experienced in motion picture production and the steep learning curve worried the producers. Due to contract obligations, Trumbull served {{as a consultant to}} Abel and Associates, while effects artist Richard Yuricich acted as a liaison between Abel and Paramount. To speed up the work, Abel passed off miniature and matte painting tasks to Yuricich. Despite being relieved of nearly half the effects work, it became clear by early 1979 that Abel and Associates {{would not be able to}} complete the remainder on time. Creative differences grew between Abel and Associates and the Paramount production team, and by mid-February 1979 the two companies parted ways.|$|E
5|$|In Benítez's {{first season}} in charge, Liverpool reached the UEFA Champions League Final, where they beat A.C. Milan on penalties, after the match {{finished}} 3–3 after extra time. The following season, Liverpool reached the FA Cup Final, where they beat West Ham United, again on penalties after a 3–3 draw. Benítez again guided Liverpool to a Champions League Final in 2007, {{but this time}} A.C. Milan beat them 2–1. On 3 June 2010, Benitez paid the price for a disappointing 2009–10 season when Liverpool announced {{he had left the}} club by mutual consent after six years in charge. Benitez, who was one <b>year</b> <b>into</b> a five-year contract, finalised his departure after agreeing a severance payment. Benitez's assistant Sammy Lee took over the reins at Liverpool until Managing director Christian Purslow and former manager Kenny Dalglish found a replacement. On 1 July 2010, former Fulham boss Roy Hodgson was confirmed as the new manager. After a poor tenure, which included Liverpool being 18th after 6 games, and only one away win during Hodgson's time in charge, Hodgson was sacked on 8 January 2011 and was replaced by former manager Kenny Dalglish the day before a 3rd Round FA Cup game against Manchester United. Dalglish signed a three-year contract as permanent manager in May, but was sacked a year later. Although the 2011/12 season ended with a poor 8th-place finish in the Premier League, Dalglish guided Liverpool to two Cup finals at Wembley, ending a six-year trophy drought by winning the League Cup. The second Cup final appearance was the FA Cup, which Liverpool lost to Chelsea. He was replaced by Brendan Rodgers on 1 June 2012.|$|E
