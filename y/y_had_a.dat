40|$|Gene therapy using {{recombinant}} adeno-associated viral vectors overexpressing neuropeptide Y in {{the hippocampus}} exerts seizure-suppressant effects in rodent epilepsy models {{and is currently}} considered for clinical application in patients with intractable mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. Seizure suppression by neuropeptide Y in the hippocampus is predominantly mediated by Y 2 receptors, which, together with neuropeptide Y, are upregulated after seizures as a compensatory mechanism. To explore whether such upregulation could prevent seizures, we overexpressed Y 2 receptors in the hippocampus using recombinant adeno-associated viral vectors. In two temporal lobe epilepsy models, electrical kindling and kainate-induced seizures, vector-based transduction of Y 2 receptor complementary DNA in the hippocampus of adult rats exerted seizure-suppressant effects. Simultaneous overexpression of Y 2 and neuropeptide <b>Y</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> more pronounced seizure-suppressant effect.

40|$|The objetive of {{this work}} was to {{determine}} the relation between the rigidity and strength properties in static bending and specifie gravity of plywood manufactured from five veneer of Pinus elliotti Engelm, plantation from a 30 year-old. Linear simples, multiple and polynomial relations involving the modulus of rupture (MOR), modulus of elasticity (MOE), strees at proportional limit (TLP) and specifie gravity (Me) of the plywood were studied. The specifie gravity did not prove to be a very exact indicator of the rigidity and strength properties of the plywood. The MOE, MOR and TLP in static bending of the plywood showed low coefficients of correlations and determination adjusted for simple linear regression, indicating a little dependence of the specific gravity.

40|$|Estimating the {{population}} {{distribution of the}} usual intake of a nutrient relative to that of another nutrient requires determination of individual-level ratios. If intake data are available on a per-day basis, as with 24 -h dietary recalls, those ratios can be determined in 1 of 2 ways: as the usual ratio of intakes or the ratio of usual intakes. Each of these ratios has its own meaning and determination; the ratio of usual intakes is conceptually consistent with determinations obtained from FFQ data. We present a method for estimating the ratio of usual intakes that uses bivariate modeling of the 2 nutrient intakes in question. Application of the method to the NHANES data for the years 2001 – 2004 yielded estimated distributions for percent of usual energy intake from total fat, percent of usual energy intake from saturated fat, and usual sodium intake per 1000 kcal (4184 kJ) of usual energy intake. Distributions for both the total population and for age-gender subgroups were estimated. Approximately 60 % of adults (> 19 <b>y)</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> usual total fat intake that was within the recommended range of 20 – 35 % of total energy, but only ∼ 34 % had a usual saturated fat intake < 10 % of total energy.

We treated 56 SLE patients with oral CsA at doses of 3 - 5 mg/kg for an average of 26 months. Adverse events not leading to the discontinuation of therapy were observed in 62. 5 % of the patients, the most frequent being hypertrichosis. CsA was slopped because of the occurrence of side effects in 9 / 56 (16 %) of the patients. The most common were nephrotoxicity (3 / 9) and the occurrence of tremors (3 / 9). These effects were always reversible within three months of CsA withdrawal.

Using pooled data from the Women's Health Initiative HT clinical trials including 27, 035 postmenopausal women aged 50 to 79 years who had no history of VTE, we assessed the risk of VTE in relation to age at menopause, age at menarche, parity, bilateral oophorectomy, and time since menopause by Cox proportional hazards models. Linear trends, quadratic relationships, and interactions of reproductive life characteristics with HT on VTE risk were systematically tested. During follow-up, 426 women reported a first VTE, including 294 non-procedure-related events. No apparent interaction of reproductive life characteristics with HT assignment on VTE risk was detected, and there was not a significant association between VTE and age at menarche, age at menopause, parity, oophorectomy, or time since menopause. However, analyses restricted to non-procedure-related VTE showed a U-shaped relationship between age at menopause and thrombotic risk that persisted after multivariable analysis (P 55 <b>y)</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> significantly increased VTE risk (hazard ratio [95 % CI]: 1. 8 [1. 2 - 2. 7] and 1. 5 [1. 0 - 2. 4], respectively).

40|$|Background: Multivitamins are {{frequently}} consumed by children, {{but it is}} unclear whether this affects the risk of allergic disease. Objective: We sought to study the association between multivita-min supplementation and allergic disease in 8 -y-old children. Design: Data were obtained from a Swedish birth cohort study. Information on lifestyle factors, including use of vitamin supple-ments, environmental exposures, and symptoms and diagnoses of allergic diseases, was obtained by parental questionnaires. In addi-tion, allergen-specific IgE concentrations of food and airborne al-lergens were measured in blood samples collected at age 8 y. A total of 2423 children were included in the study. The association be-tween use of vitamin supplements and the selected health outcomes was analyzed with logistic regression. Results: Overall, no strong and consistent associations were ob-served between current multivitamin use and asthma, allergic rhi-nitis, eczema, or atopic sensitization at age 8 y. However, children who reported that they started taking multivitamins before or at age 4 <b>y</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> decreased risk of sensitization to food allergens (odds ratio: 0. 61; 95 % CI: 0. 39, 0. 97) and tendencies toward inverse associations with allergic rhinitis. In contrast, there was no consis-tent association among children who started to use multivitamins at or after age 5 y. Conclusion: Our results show no association between current use of multivitamins and risk of allergic disease but suggest that supple-mentation with multivitamins during the first years of life may re-duce the risk of allergic disease at school age.

Inhibiting the Na-K pump either by exposing the preparation to a K-free solution or by adding the cardioactive steroid strophanthidin increased both aiNa and twitch tension and resulted {{in the development of}} tonic tension, after-contractions and a transient inward current (ITI). The increase of twitch tension was present at lower aiNa than that required to produce the other phenomena. The relationship between the magnitude of the twitch tension and aiNa was always non-linear. Twitch tension increased steeply with aiNa at first but the relationship flattened off at higher aiNa and tension eventually decreased. Over the steep range, the relationship between tension and aiNa could be represented as: twitch tension = b (aiNa) y where <b>y</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> mean value of 3. 2. Changing membrane potential or [Ca 2 +]o changed b but had little effect on y. Mn (2 mmol/l) greatly decreased twitch tension but, at least initially, had little effect on tonic tension.
