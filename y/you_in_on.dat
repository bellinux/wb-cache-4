500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} shows Rihanna sexually seducing her love interest, while {{revealing}} her [...] "nasty secrets". According to Julianne Shepherd of Spin, Rihanna [...] "coyly dares" [...] 'her lover to [...] "sex her up"'. In [...] "Roc Me Out", Rihanna uses her [...] "militaristic alternate persona" [...] and interprets the lyrics [...] "with a command and directness befitting" [...] of it. Rihanna complains to her lover throughout the lines [...] "You’re taking {{too long to}} get {{my head on the}} ground / And my feet in the clouds," [...] before cooing, [...] "I’ve been a bad girl, daddy". She gives him instructions while singing [...] "Get my head on the ground and my feet in the clouds". Priya Elan of NME commented that the song sounds like a [...] "‘Rude Boy’ re-tool from the vocal delivery to her 'Come on boy' line." [...] In the end, Rihanna reveals the [...] "dirtiest secret" [...] through the line [...] "I’ll let <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> a dirty secret, I just want to be loved". David Amidon of PopMatters described the line as the song's [...] "not exactly a dangerous sentiment".|$|E
500|$|Kahn {{said that}} the entire idea for the video was Brown's: [...] "It's an {{interesting}} video for me, because it's so rare that music videos ever try to achieve anything emotional. Chris just basically {{told me a story}} of what he felt this video was going to be, with his heart glowing and how he's, like, cold. It is a very personal story. But it's told in such a graphic manner that I {{fell in love with the}} idea. It's Chris' story. Period. I am the pencil that put it down on the paper." [...] When comparing the song's video to that of [...] "I Can Transform Ya", the director said, [...] "'Crawl' is my favorite one, because — gosh, I'm going to let <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> this — 'cause it's probably his most personal thing he's ever done." [...] He went on to say, [...] "I mean, everything that's happened to him in the year, I think this is going to be his big statement, in terms of what he's feeling and what he's living through right now." [...] When talking about the ideas and concepts of the video, Kahn {{said that the}} video, his first ballad with Brown, should speak for itself through the ideas that he had and the [...] "genesis" [...] of what that idea was.|$|E

2500|$|Velasco {{remarked that}} its {{simplicity}} {{allowed them to}} create a [...] "very heartwarming...and friendly game" [...] and to really highlight a [...] "major component of the game, which is the friendship between the boy and blob." [...] Gomez explained that [...] "everything is about subtlety. There will be hints here and there letting <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> what is taking place. The story will develop {{as much as the}} player wants to venture in the details." ...|$|E
2500|$|JoJo {{describes}} Agápē as a [...] "labor of {{love from}} the heart without limits or boundaries." [...] In an interview with VibeVixen when describing the tape JoJo said [...] "I would say this is definitely the most cohesive body of work. It's more of an experience, there's more interludes," [...] she says. [...] "It'll kind of let <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> what's been happening in my personal life, my family. It really plays on me being from Massachusetts, me living in L.A. and finding myself in between those two worlds, not feeling like I necessarily belong anywhere, but I guess that's how most people feel in their 20s anyway." ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{noting that}} Lungu's Băieți de gașcă stories {{inherently}} fail to explore [...] "a more profound vision", Crețu argues: [...] "Dan Lungu [...] manages to render this shortcoming relative through irresistible comedy: {{not one of}} word play , but one of situation." [...] The volume's eponymous story thus alternates between the apparent seriousness of gang culture and the obstacles they face as individuals, with episodes such as one gang member's frustrations over his girlfriend's nymphomania. Other sections of the volume strike a different note, and include a fictionalized account {{the life of a}} young Englishwoman who decides to settle in Romania. Focusing on Lungu's ability to surprise his readers, Teodorescu commented: [...] "Once in a while, if one does not want to let himself be conquered by his tricks, one may have reactions of mistrust [...] Dan Lungu anticipates this reaction as well and builds up complicity for what he does, like a prestidigitator who, {{at the same time as}} jokingly letting <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> how he has made you believe that he was able to cut himself in two, leads you into the fog of the next trick [...] Whoever carefully reads Dan Lungu gets a free lesson in the manipulation techniques to which all those who wish to have us convinced of the truth in non-literary fiction will expose us without warning and at times successfully." [...] Cristea-Enache, who praised Băieți de gașcă for displaying [...] "natural breathing", [...] "stylistic mobility" [...] and [...] "dexterity", also argued: [...] "When the young prose author will manage to inject more substance into both his stories and novels, we shall have in him a leading exponent of this new-old literature." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "They did," [...] said Ellesworth, [...] "but I don't regret it. I'm {{working now}} on a much bigger thing,--something with greater {{possibilities}} in it. When the right moment comes I'll let <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> the ground floor." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'They're dreadful people, I believe, London landladies,' said Edie, in {{her most}} housewifely manner; 'regular cheats and skinflints, I've always heard, who try to take <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> every {{conceivable}} point and item. We must be {{very careful not to}} let them get the better of us, Ernest, and to make full inquiries about all extras, and so forth, beforehand.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a dirty {{business}} all round," [...] Dauncey declared. [...] "They {{made you}} advance {{the whole of}} the money to buy the land, and they saved their bit for the waterworks and lighting company. It's as plain as a pikestaff why they didn't let <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> that. They knew perfectly well that you'd never be a party to such a low-down scheme as they had in view." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Say!" [...] Del objected. [...] "I {{said it was}} a hunch; and I want to ring <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> it, savve? You're all right, and you've {{learned a}} hell of a lot out of books. You're a regular high-roller when it comes to the laboratory, and all that; but it takes yours truly to get down and read the face of nature without spectacles. Now I've got a theory--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{recognized}} <b>you</b> <b>in</b> church <b>on</b> Sunday. I {{am sorry}} that any local disputes of Sir Leicester's--they {{are not of}} his seeking, however, I believe--should render it {{a matter of some}} absurd difficulty to show you any attention here." ...|$|R

But you'll have to put on some miner's duds and spend to-day riding around the hills to get a little sunburn. You don't look like a miner." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just now," [...] {{continued}} Ellesworth, [...] "I'm {{working on}} a thing that I think will be rather a big thing. I shouldn't want it talked about outside, but it's a matter of taking hold of the cod fisheries of the Grand Banks,--practically amalgamating them--and perhaps combining with them the entire herring output, and {{the whole of the}} sardine catch of the Mediterranean. If it goes through," [...] he added, [...] "I shall {{be in a position to}} let <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> the ground floor." ...|$|E

To-morrow is her birthday, you know, {{and this is a}} surprise I've saved for her. [They all nod.] I've been intriguing my damnedest for the past month to get permission for Martha to go with me. It was difficult because women are supposed to be barred. [Happily.] But I've succeeded. The letter came this morning. How tickled to death she'll be when she hears! I know she's given up hope. [Thoughtfully.] I suppose it's that has been making her act so out-of-sorts lately.|$|E
