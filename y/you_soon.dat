500|$|On January 30, 1904, Hanna {{attended}} the Gridiron Club {{dinner at the}} Arlington Hotel. [...] He neither ate nor drank, and when asked how his health was, responded [...] "Not good." [...] He never again left his Washington residence, having fallen ill with typhoid fever. [...] As the days passed, politicians began {{to wait in the}} Arlington lobby, close to Hanna's house, for news; a letter from the President, [...] "May <b>you</b> <b>soon</b> be with us, old fellow, as strong in body and as vigorous in your leadership as ever" [...] was never read by the recipient. [...] Hanna drifted {{in and out of consciousness}} for several days; on the morning of February 15, his heart began to fail. [...] Roosevelt visited at 3pm, unseen by the dying man. [...] At 6:30pm, Senator Hanna died, and the crowd of congressional colleagues, government officials, and diplomats who had gathered in the lobby of the Arlington left the hotel, many sobbing. [...] Roosevelt biographer Edmund Morris noted Hanna's achievement in industry and in politics, [...] "He had not done badly in either field; he had made seven million dollars, and a President of the United States." ...|$|E
500|$|On 18 February 1916, Ball joined No.13 Squadron RFC at Marieux in France, {{flying a}} two-seat Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2c on {{reconnaissance}} missions. He survived being {{shot down by}} anti-aircraft fire on 27 March. Three days later, he fought {{the first of several}} combats in the B.E.2; he and his observer, Lieutenant S. A.Villiers, fired a drum and a half of Lewis gun ammunition at an enemy two-seater, but were driven off by a second one. After this inconclusive skirmish, Ball wrote home in one of his many letters, [...] "I like this job, but nerves do not last long, and <b>you</b> <b>soon</b> want a rest". In letters home to his father, he discouraged the idea of his younger brother following him into the RFC. Ball and Villiers tried unsuccessfully to shoot down an enemy observation balloon in their two-seater on 10 April. Ball's burgeoning skills and aggressiveness gained him access to the squadron's single-seat Bristol Scout fighter later that month. April 1916 also saw Ball's first mention in a letter home of plans for [...] "a most wonderful machine... heaps better than the Hun Fokker". It is now generally believed that these [...] "plans" [...] were unconnected with the design of the Austin-Ball A.F.B.1, with which he later became involved.|$|E

2500|$|During the 2012–13 season, former Scottish footballer Pat Nevin said of Mkhitaryan, [...] "Eleven {{goals in}} eight league matches already is fantastic, {{but when you}} add {{that he is a}} midfielder, it is phenomenal. You may not have heard of him yet, even if all the scouts at the top European clubs have, but <b>you</b> <b>soon</b> will. He has pace, skill, a rocket of a shot and the ability to arrive in the box like Frank Lampard. This all singles him out as a player who must be watched or more {{importantly}} marked." ...|$|E
2500|$|That same month, Ciara {{said that}} there was no release date for the album. She instead said [...] "I think I'm almost done. I think there was a date December 4 that was {{supposedly}} put in the universe, but the date was never ever confirmed, not from my mouth, but they can definitely look out for this album this winter. I'll be telling <b>you</b> <b>soon.</b> Stay tuned. You know what? I'm giving you guys my video [...] on my birthday, so you never know what could happen around Christmas-time. I love giving gifts." [...] After the premiere of the [...] "Got Me Good" [...] video, the album was slated to drop in early 2013. On April 15, 2013, Ciara revealed the official tracklist for the album and confirmed that it is now titled Ciara. Additionally, she stated that it would be released on June 4, 2013. The album was then postponed to July 9, 2013. The aforementioned singles were swept aside from the album and subsequently under the title Ciara, the album is now led by the single [...] "Body Party". The album artwork features a mirror-flipped image of Ciara.|$|E
2500|$|According to Le Petit Parisien, Reichelt's initial {{attempt to}} ascend {{to the first}} stage of the tower was blocked by a guard, M. Gassion, who had {{witnessed}} previous unsuccessful dummy drops and feared that Reichelt's attempt would end in disaster, though Le Figaro reported that he had merely not received a copy of the order and had to wait for telephone confirmation from his superiors. Despite the guard's resistance, by 8:00a.m. the matter had been resolved: Reichelt, who was visibly shaken by his argument with the guard, was allowed to mount the tower with his two friends and a cinematographer (another was stationed near the foot of the tower to record the jump from below). As he climbed the stairs he paused, turned back to the crowd, raised his hand and wished them a cheery [...] "". (See <b>you</b> <b>soon).</b> His friends continued to try {{to talk him out of}} the jump, but Reichelt was quite determined. At 8:22a.m., observed by a crowd of about 30 journalists and curious onlookers, he readied himself – facing towards the Seine – on a stool placed on a restaurant table next to the interior guardrail of the tower's first deck, a little more than [...] above the ground. After adjusting his apparatus with the assistance of his friends and checking the wind direction by throwing a piece of paper taken from a small book, he placed one foot on the guardrail, hesitated for about 40 seconds, then leapt outwards. According to Le Figaro, he was calm and smiling just before he jumped. His parachute, which had seemed to be only half-open, folded around him almost immediately and he plummeted for a few seconds before crashing into the frozen soil at the foot of the tower.|$|E

2500|$|On 12 July 2017, Haye {{confirmed}} {{that had begun}} strengthening his ankle and he would slowly start training for his next fight which would likely take place in December 2017. On 24 July, negotiations had began for a rematch between Haye and Tony Bellew (28-2-1, 19 KOs) {{to take place in}} December 2017, although they were far from an agreement. Bellew made Haye of his preferred purse, which would reportedly make the rematch worth around £20 million. On 3 August, Hearn stated a rematch between Bellew and Haye was 'virtually dead', due to both fighters believing they are the A-side and have the right to demand ring walks, poster, changing rooms and split of purse. On 6 September, Hearn stated a deal could be made within seven days. According to Bellew's trainer, David Coldwell, both Haye and Bellew had held positive talks and looking more likely to agree to a fight, as long they stay on the same page and agree to the same terms. On 19 September, Haye agreed all the terms and tweeted Bellew to sign the contract. He said, [...] "It's taken months of negotiating but teams have finally agreed all terms for Haye-Bellew 2. Will Bellew put pen to paper?" [...] The fight was reported to take place on Sunday 17 December 2017. Promoter Eddie Hearn stated the fight was not a done deal, but he had hoped to confirm the fight within a week. Bellew replied the following day, tweeting, [...] "I OBLIGE YOU @mrdavidhaye , happy? Now leave me alone with my family please. I'll see <b>you</b> <b>soon</b> enough!" [...] The fight was officially confirmed on 29 September for the fight to take place at the O2 Arena in London. Bellew claimed the rematch wasn't personal anymore, just business and hoping to dedicate a win to his late brother-in-law, who had passed away in August. Haye stated that Bellew wouldn't win the lottery twice. Like the first fight, it was scheduled to be shown live on Sky Box Office.|$|E
