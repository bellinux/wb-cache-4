But Katz's signature grin is a little stiff, a little too aggressive. Leaning forward, she looks {{as if she might}} take a bite out of the next passerby. Which by the way, seems appropriate when <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> on her days behind the mayoral desk. Maybe monochromatic bronze just isn't the right medium for a woman as colorful as ol' Vera. Where's the red blazer? Our suggestion: Get this lady some accessories!

500|$|The {{novel is}} narrated {{in the first}} person through a series of [...] nine journaux intimes, kept by Mountstuart from age 17 until shortly before his death at 85. French {{literary}} journals, always published posthumously, are often extremely candid accounts, particularly of the author's sexual life. Boyd, himself a francophile, includes masturbation, prostitution and Mountstuart's three marriages. While Boyd had earlier written work in the form of memoir or biography, a journal is different: [...] "For a start, it's written without the benefit of hindsight, so there isn't the same feeling you get when <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> and add shape to a life. There are huge chunks missing." [...] The novel's grounding in everyday life and focus on characterisation place it firmly within realism.|$|E

The site's consensus states, [...] "Southside with <b>You</b> <b>looks</b> <b>back</b> on a real-life date with strong performances and engaging dialogue, adding up to a romance that makes for a pretty good date movie in its own right." [...] On Metacritic, {{the film has}} a score of 74 out of 100, based on 42 critics, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews".|$|R

500|$|Kove's first {{ideas for}} The Danish Poet began {{when she went}} {{through a period of}} self-assessment; she wanted to write a story about what she {{described}} as when [...] "you reach a turning point or a milestone and <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> and you think 'how in the heck did I get here?' [...] And you realize that the answer lies somewhere in a complex web of all kinds of stuff, like genetic make-up, upbringing, coincidences, choices you made along the way, missed opportunities, [...] lucky breaks." [...] She felt that it was a natural choice to centre on a relationship between two people, [...] "because relationships, and especially the romantic ones, play a huge role in shaping our lives, and also, obviously, in creating new ones." ...|$|E
500|$|Miller later {{noted that}} unlike other episode scenes {{such as in}} [...] "Grey Matters", Walter's {{breakdown}} at the supermarket [...] "came largely out of nowhere. It was a thought experiment that took {{on a life of}} its own." [...] Miller continued that at the time, he and Stentz thought they were writing Olivia-focused episodes, but [...] "In retrospect, we really wrote a four-part story about Walter, his relationship to children, and the struggle between Walter-who-was and Walter-who-is. If you look at it that way, his decision at the end of 'Northwest Passage' becomes the moment where he reconciles those things. He doesn't resolve them, but he comes to grips with them. Once again in retrospect, I think that's what the supermarket breakdown was really about. This happens — you think a scene is about one thing when you're in the middle of it, and realize it's something else entirely when <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>back.</b> Characters can be sneaky motherfuckers that way." ...|$|E
500|$|The writing staff cited The Wizard of Oz as {{a source}} of {{thematic}} influence for Tron: Legacy in writing the script, with Kitsis stating that [...] "They both have very similar DNA, which is Tron really lives on, in a lot of ways, trying to get home. You're put on this world and you want to go home and what is home? That's in a lot of way inspired us." [...] Kitsis also added that they had to include an"emotional spine to take us into the story or else it just becomes a bunch of moves or gags and stuff", eventually deciding on adding a mysterious destiny to Flynn and giving him a legendary aura - [...] "Kevin Flynn to us was Steve Jobs and Bill Gates all wrapped up into one and John Lennon". The writers decided to create the character of Clu as an evil embodiment of [...] "how <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> on your younger self, (...) that guy [...] thought he knew everything, but he really knew nothing". Bridges liked the idea of the dual perspectives, and contributed with the writers for the characterization of Flynn as a sanguine Zen master by suggesting them to get inspiration from various Buddhist texts. Part of the concepts emerged from a reunion the producers had with scientists from California Institute of Technology and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory to discuss concepts such as isomorphic algorithms and the digitizing of organic matter.|$|E

500|$|The younger alternate-timeline Spock. Quinto {{expressed}} interest in the role because of the duality of Spock's half-human, half-Vulcan heritage, and how [...] "he is constantly exploring that notion of how to evolve in a responsible way and how to evolve in a respectful way. I think those are all things {{that we as a}} society, and certainly the world, could implement." [...] He mentioned he heard about the new film and revealed his interest in the role in a December 2006 interview with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette; the article was widely circulated and he attracted Abrams' interest. For the audition, Quinto wore a blue shirt and flattened his hair down to feel more like Spock. He bound his fingers to practice the Vulcan salute, shaved his eyebrows, and grew and dyed his hair for the role. He conveyed many of Spock's attributes, such as his stillness and the way Nimoy would hold his hands behind his back. Quinto commented that the physical transformation aided in portraying an alien, joking [...] "I just felt like a nerd. I felt like I was 12 again. <b>You</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> at those pictures and you see the bowl cut. There's no question I was born to play the Spock role. I was sporting that look for a good four or five years. The film officially establishes (to Kirk's surprise) that Uhura and Spock are lovers and have been romantically linked for some time, a point which had never been previously explored on TV or in film." [...] Adrien Brody had discussed playing the role with the director before Quinto was cast.|$|E
500|$|Filmmaker Walt Disney {{himself had}} first {{attempted}} {{to adapt the}} Brothers Grimm fairy tale [...] "Rapunzel" [...] into a feature-length animated film during the 1930s and 1940s. However, the project was eventually abandoned because the original fairy tale was considered too [...] "small". When they were first approached to direct Tangled in 2008, directors Nathan Greno and Byron Howard decided {{that it would be}} best [...] "to blow up the scale of the film" [...] and transform it into a [...] "big event", while updating and modernizing the story for a new audience. Flynn was conceived because the directors felt that [...] "Rapunzel needed to get out ... So she needed to meet a guy to take her to where she's going." [...] In the original fairy tale, Rapunzel's love interest is a prince. However, Greno and Howard decided to make him a thief – dubbed [...] "a subtle yet startling twist for Disney" [...] by The New York Times – in order to avoid creating a character who is too [...] "safe", opting for a funnier and [...] "edgier" [...] antihero instead. Greno elaborated, [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> at some of the past Disney princes ... {{a lot of them are}} kind of soft and they're not like people we think are that cool," [...] continuing, [...] "They're good guys, so I guess we sort of took that to the other extreme." [...] However, some of the filmmakers themselves were concerned that Flynn was becoming too edgy. Greno revealed that [...] "There were people ... who were a little worried because they were hearing these rumors, 'Well, it's not a prince it's a thief. He's kind of a ladies' man, and he's very arrogant.'" [...] Greno summarized Flynn's conception and development to Orange: ...|$|E
500|$|Webb {{described}} {{the film as}} [...] "a story about a kid who grows up looking for his father and finds himself." [...] Both Webb and star Garfield described Parker as an outsider by choice, someone hard to get close to. As in the early comic books, the character [...] "is a science whiz. If <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> to the early Stan Lee and Steve Ditko comics, he's a nerd with big glasses," [...] said Webb. He explained [...] "the idea of what a nerd is has changed in 40 or 50 years. Nerds are running the world. Andrew Garfield made a movie [...] about it. ... What was important in those early comics was this notion that Peter Parker is an outsider and how we define that in a contemporary context." [...] Garfield compared his Spider-Man façade {{as a metaphor for}} internet anonymity, saying, [...] "You feel the power of it, the power of not being seen, the power of the mask. Peter becomes witty when he's got that protective layer. It's like he's on a message board. He's got the anonymity of the Internet within that suit, and he can say whatever the [...] @#!*% [...] he likes, and he can get away with anything." [...] Garfield tried to explore Parker as an orphan, whom he feels [...] "are the strongest human beings on the planet." [...] He said Parker is [...] "a human hero [...] goes through all of the same struggles that we all have gone through, especially the skinny ones [...] want more power than they feel they have." [...] He believes Parker represents [...] "a very inspiring, aspirational character that symbolizes goodness—and {{how difficult it is to}} be good—but how worth it it is." [...] Rhys Ifans compared this film to William Shakespeare's Hamlet on the grounds that Spider-Man can be redone over and over in different ways. He felt that they are similar in that they both represent meaningful archetypal young men grappling with the loss of their father. Critics like Claudia Puig of USA Today felt that Garfield's character as the superhero [...] "embodies the nerdy Parker, the anguished fatherless teen and the cocky super-hero in equal doses". Boyd Hoij of Variety noted that Garfield's character as Spider-Man makes an interesting hero in the film because of how it establishes early on that Peter's growing pains along with his search for an identity are common to any teenager and that [...] "his struggles involve real people—and real lives." ...|$|E

They'd tell you they were going to put one in your ear and when <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> and saw the catcher's glove by your head you got the idea you shouldn't take a toehold."

5000|$|According to Sanjeev Kapoor, {{a member}} of Singapore Airlines' International Culinary Panel, Indian food {{has long been an}} {{expression}} of world cuisine. Kapoor claims, [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> in India's history and study the food that our ancestors ate, you will notice how much attention was paid to the planning and cooking of a meal. Great thought was given to the texture and taste of each dish." [...] One such historical record is , (मानसोल्लास, The Delight of Mind), written in the 12th century. The book describes the need to change cuisine and food with seasons, various methods of cooking, the best blend of flavours, the feel of various foods, planning and style of dining amongst other things.|$|R

2500|$|Heenan is [...] {{considered}} by many to be the greatest wrestling manager of all time, including WWE, who placed him at the top of their 25 greatest managers list in 2011. Author Brian Shields notes that many consider him [...] "one of the most significant figures in professional wrestling history". For his work in promoting André the Giant's match with Hulk Hogan at WrestleMania III, often cited as the most famous American professional wrestling match, Heenan received a six-figure payoff—arguably the largest pay day in any managerial career. Broadcaster Peter Rosenberg considers Heenan a personal hero and describes him as the best commentator, manager and bad guy in WWE history. Rosenberg stated that Heenan [...] "operated on multiple levels", adding: [...] "If you were a little kid, he was the foil to your hero. As an adult, <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> and appreciate just how much of a comedic genius he was." ...|$|E
