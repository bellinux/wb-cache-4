Restoration of faunal communities often follows the “Field of Dreams” hypothesis: “if <b>you</b> <b>build</b> it, they will come”.

For example, abundances of several bird species showed marked increases after riparian vegetation had been reestablished in a riparian corridor in Iowa.|$|E

For example, {{if a player}} builds a base and conquers a province, only to have a neighbouring faction attack aforementioned province, the player will start out with his previous base, {{with the exception of}} having no technology researched. Also, the CPU always starts out in the same spot, rather than being random. If <b>you</b> <b>build</b> a defense around the CPU's starting point and it's too close, it will be removed {{at the beginning of the}} defense match. Players may also choose to garrison provinces with units that are instantly available should the province be attacked. These are bought with planetary requisition.|$|E

[...] In conversation with Byrds biographer Johnny Rogan in 1980, Crosby defended the song by stating [...] "it was unusual and not everybody could understand it because they'd never heard anything like it before. At that time everything was supposed to have rhyme and have rhythm. And it neither rhymed nor had rhythm, so it was outside of their experience. It was just a little story and what it said was true ... if <b>you</b> <b>build</b> walls around your mind to keep out the abuse and harshness of life and the pain, then you also shut out the joy and the love." [...] Although [...] "Mind Gardens" [...] is often dismissed by critics and fans for being self-indulgent, Rogan has noted that its raga rock ambiance, symbolic lyrics and attractive backwards guitar effects capture the Byrds at their most creatively ambitious.|$|E

[...] Iowa wrestling coach Dan Gable said his wife cried on learning that Elliott had retired. [...] In 1999, Gable wrote: [...] "Right after I came to coach at the University of Iowa, I {{had a meeting with}} Bump Elliott, who was the Athletic Director. I’ll never forget what Bump said to me: ‘Don’t ask for the moon. Strive to get there, sure, but do it wisely through continuing to build upon what you already have. As <b>you</b> <b>build,</b> come see me, and we’ll see how I can help you out.’ I now call that bit of wisdom the Bump Elliott Rule, and it serves a good reminder to keep things in perspective. Gradual, solid growth is better than any quick fix.""The one thing we emphasized from the start was that our staff had to make sure we were 100 percent loyal to each other and the university," [...] Elliott said {{at the time of his}} retirement. [...] "There could be no jealousy between the coaches and various programs. [...] I wanted no one talking behind anyone's backs. [...] I wanted absolute loyalty.

By contrast, informational processes are [...] observer-relative: observers pick out certain patterns in the world and consider them information processes, but information processes are not things-in-the-world themselves. Since they do not exist at a physical level, Searle argues, they cannot have causal efficacy and thus cannot cause consciousness.

2500|$|To {{develop the}} game's themes, Kaplan {{stated that they}} wanted to create a future that was not typical of what a post-apocalyptic world might be like, opting instead for a future where {{conflict}} still exists but a [...] "bright and aspirational vision" [...] is maintained. The title's creative director, Chris Metzen, acknowledged that parts of Overwatch, such as maps, share [...] "continuity" [...] with Titan. Citing a desire to keep its game styles [...] "simple", and because it contradicted its emphasis on accomplishing goals as a team rather than trying to achieve large numbers of kills, Overwatch does not contain a traditional deathmatch mode. Metzen stated that [...] "we have a long legacy of developing multiplayer games, and it came down to 'is it even possible to build a shooter that doesn't feel cynical, that doesn't feel cruel, that doesn't feel nasty? Can <b>you</b> <b>build</b> one that really promotes teamwork and relationship and having fun with your friends, and not getting killed with a thrown knife from halfway across the map as soon as you jump in?'" ...|$|E
2500|$|The 12-metre {{class rules}} stipulated that the hull {{had to be}} the same {{thickness}} throughout and could not be made lighter in the bow and stern.

[...] Despite attempts to defuse the situation, the [...] "cheating comment" [...] added to the controversy surrounding the Louis Vuitton challenge races. Chris Dickson, skipper of the Kiwi Magic (KZ 7), took the controversy in stride and with humor, and Conner has subsequently stated his regret over his comment. New Zealand syndicate head Sir Michael Fay's comment was that core samples would be taken [...] "over my dead body". Eventually some small holes were drilled to test the hull, and ultrasonic testing was done to rule out air pockets in the construction. The boat was found to be within class rules, and the issue was set aside. Fay ceremoniously lay {{down in front of the}} measurer before the samples were taken.|$|E

Shaffner commented on {{the choice of the}} show's chair, stating, [...] "You find one that you like and then <b>you</b> <b>build</b> it yourself to make it a little shallower and a little more upright and the cushion a little firmer [...] But not too firm or every time the guest sits down they’ll say, 'Oooh this is a hard chair.'" [...] The rest of the set has been described as being [...] "filled with warm wood tones and electric blue screens," [...] and has been compared to the set of his most recent stint on The Tonight Show. The new set features several differences, however, including a remote-controlled moon, and the backdrop being transformed into a giant blue ocean.

He stated that although the game itself was only 15% complete, the narrative was finalized; players would control an original character who begins as a small-time member of the Corleone family, and must work his way up through the ranks. He stated that EA had {{wanted to make a}}n open-world game for some time; [...] "We wanted to make a title with the same style of open world, but with a strong background, one where <b>you</b> <b>build</b> human relationships while creating your own story." [...] He also explained that the player's progression path through the game could be determined by the player, but would intersect with the plot of the film at certain points, and the player would get to participate in famous scenes from the movie; [...] "It's constructed so that players will appear in the scene and will feel as if they are alive within it." ...|$|E
