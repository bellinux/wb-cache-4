40|$|The {{relative}} Age Effect (RAE) {{has been}} analyzed {{in a population}} of Spanish international handball players (n= 161) divided into four different levels: Senior, Junior, Juvenile and Promising Talents. The variables registered were quarter, half <b>year</b> <b>and</b> <b>year</b> <b>of</b> birth using the initial information of their date of birth. The {{data were collected from}} the Royal Spanish Handball Federation on-line data base. The statistical method used was the χ 2 and the minimum level of significance was set at p< 0. 05. The total results on distribution by quarter show a significant difference (χ 2 = 21. 68; p< 0. 01) with a greater frequency of players born in the first quarter (40. 37 %) compared to those born in the second (22. 36 %), third (16. 15 %) and fourth quarter (21. 12 %). The total results on the distribution of birth date by half year show a significant difference (χ 2 = 10. 44; p< 0. 01) with a greater frequency of players born in the first half <b>of</b> the <b>year</b> (62. 73 %).

2500|$|On March 12, 2010, {{during the}} 2010 Rey de Reyes event Dorian Roldan, son of AAA boss Joaquin Roldan {{announced}} that he, Dorian, {{was going to}} take control of the promotion and that he had some help to do so. That help turned out to be L.A. Park, the original La Parka returning to AAA after <b>years</b> <b>and</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> legal battles and threats. After unveiling himself during the show L.A. Park announced that he was siding with Konnan and Dorian Roldan, targeting the [...] "impostor Parka". In order to maintain the illusion that L.A. Park did not really work for AAA, L.A. Park claimed that he came to AAA to beat up La Parka, and since he had done that already he was not sure if he even felt like returning to AAA. L.A. Park did however return to an AAA ring as he had another brawl with La Parka on their April 18 television taping. During the event La Parka challenged L.A. Park to a match at Triplemania XVIII, under any stipulation the original Parka wanted. During AAA's television taping on April 30, 2010 L.A. Park accepted La Parka's challenge for a match at Triplemania XVIII. At an AAA press conference on May 12, 2010 it was announced that the match between the two would be for the rights to the name [...] "La Parka". At Triplemania XVIII L.A. Park faced La Parka in the main event of the show. Near the end of the match Park used a tombstone piledriver, a move that is illegal in Lucha Libre. Joaquin Roldan entered the ring, when L.A. Park attempted to use a steel chair on La Parka. When L.A. Park teased using the chair on Joaquin instead, Dorian entered the ring to protest, but was pushed down by Park, who then hit Joaquin with the chair, which caused Dorian to turn on him, hitting him with a steel chair three times. Halloween and Damián 666 from the Perros del Mal wrestling promotion run to the ring to chase Dorian Roldan away. Then they drag L.A. Park on top of La Parka before rúdo referee Hijo del Tirantes counts for three to give L.A. Park the victory. After the bell rings the rest of Los Perros del Mal, (including Park's son Hijo de L.A. Park) came to the ring to celebrate with L.A. Park who had won the rights to the name [...] "La Parka". After a couple of minutes a group of AAA wrestlers led by Octagón came to ringside and in combination with the arena security managed to remove Los Perros del Mal from the ring. La Parka was taken from the ring on a stretcher, not having moved since L.A. Park applied the piledriver. A bit later it was announced that the match results had been thrown out due to interference by Los Perros del Mal, but the following morning it was confirmed that Tapia had indeed won and would now be known as [...] "La Parka" [...] once again. However, on June 10 AAA announced that it would respect Mexico City Boxing and Wrestling Commission's decision to throw out the match and as a result both L.A. Park and La Parka would keep their names. Park stated that for him the Triplemania match was all about pride and not about names and that all that mattered to him was that he had proven who the true La Parka is, regardless of the names they now go by.|$|E
