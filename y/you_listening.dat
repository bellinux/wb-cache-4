25|$|Four {{months after}} {{publishing}} his first article in Marc’Aurelio, the highly influential biweekly humour magazine, {{he joined the}} editorial board, achieving success with a regular column titled But Are <b>You</b> <b>Listening?</b> Described as “the determining moment in Fellini’s life”, the magazine gave him steady employment between 1939 and 1942, when he interacted with writers, gagmen, and scriptwriters. These encounters eventually led to opportunities in show business and cinema. Among his collaborators on the magazine’s editorial board were the future director Ettore Scola, Marxist theorist and scriptwriter Cesare Zavattini, and Bernardino Zapponi, a future Fellini screenwriter. Conducting interviews for CineMagazzino also proved congenial: when asked to interview Aldo Fabrizi, Italy’s most popular variety performer, he established such immediate personal rapport with the man that they collaborated professionally. Specializing in humorous monologues, Fabrizi commissioned material from his young protégé.|$|E

The Billboard review of the album was also extremely positive, noting that its composition is [...] "infinitely more memorable and unique than the singer's baffling 2009 set, She Wolf", and that it [...] "manages to bridge the divide between the old and new Shakira with a spark that keeps <b>you</b> <b>listening</b> to the very end".|$|E

2500|$|The Rapture {{was well}} {{received}} by critics. Melody Maker hailed the record at its release and wrote: [...] "The Rapture is a fascinating, transcontinental journey through danger and exotica". Describing the arrangements, they added, [...] "it's a vivid cornucopia of lush instrumentation, mandolins vying with cellos and bells, sweeping strings describing starlit oceans and sirens calling from jagged rocks, and attics that hide secret worlds". Steve Malins of Vox {{also liked the}} album. He said, [...] "The title-track is a sublime melodrama recalling the experimentation of Peepshow and 1982's Kiss in the Dreamhouse", [...] before concluding with this sentence, [...] "The Rapture represents an intelligent twist on familiar Banshees obsessions". Liz Buckley of Sun Zoom Spark also praised it, writing, [...] "How is a band that first formed almost two decades ago able to remain both vital and celebrated? Answer: Metamorphosis". Buckley also declared that [...] "the album is able to excite the hairs {{on the back of}} your neck". Select gave it a 4-star rating, hailing the band as [...] "purveyors of scary pop par excellence". Matt Hall noted the ability of the group for [...] "trotting out jolly tunes about mental breakdown, love bordering on obsession and severely dislocated relationships." [...] The reviewer characterized The Rapture as a [...] "fine little Russian doll of a record", and said, [...] "Under the keyboard lines, swelling strings and OTT percussion, at the centre of every song is a nugget of disquiet that keeps <b>you</b> <b>listening</b> again and again".|$|E

She should not be taken for granted." [...] Steve Jones, writing for USA Today, considered Two Eleven Norwood's [...] "most impassioned album in years. Whether she's overjoyed with a new love or ready to be shut of an old one, her heart seems like an open book." [...] Mesfin Fekadu from San Francisco Chronicle stated, [...] "Not many singers have released six consistently amazing albums. Brandy has. Her newest is a collection of R songs that are personal, flavored and fantastic. The album doesn't miss a beat, as Brandy's raspy-yet-earthy tone weaves into each song's beat nicely to create outstanding tracks that will have <b>you</b> <b>listening</b> again and again." [...] People declared Two Eleven [...] "her best work since 2004's career high Afrodisiac" [...] and wrote, [...] "full of subtle, sensual pleasures, the album unfolds at a slow-to-midtempo pace and stays there for most of the time, even when incorporating hip-hop or electronica beats."
