The group was thrown out and, after a heated exchange of words, subsequently parted ways. Ebens allegedly instigated the incident by declaring, [...] "It's because of <b>you</b> <b>little</b> motherfuckers that we're out of work!" [...] referring to U.S. auto manufacturing jobs having been lost to Japan, particularly referring to sales of Chrysler's rebadged Mitsubishis as captive imports, having mistaken the Chinese-American Chin as being Japanese.|$|E

2500|$|Roosevelt {{grew up in}} an {{atmosphere}} of privilege. His father, had graduated from Harvard Law School in 1851 but chose not to practice law after receiving an inheritance from his grandfather. James was a prominent Bourbon Democrat; when he took along five-year-old Franklin to see President Grover Cleveland, the busy president told Franklin, [...] "I have one wish for <b>you,</b> <b>little</b> man, that you will never be President of the United States." [...] Sara was the dominant influence in Franklin's early years; she once declared, [...] "My son Franklin is a Delano, not a Roosevelt at all." [...] James, who was 54 when Franklin was born, was considered by some as a remote father, though biographer James MacGregor Burns indicates James interacted with his son more than was typical at the time. Frequent trips to Europe—he made his first excursion at the age of two and went with his parents every year from the ages of seven to fifteen—helped Roosevelt become conversant in German and French.|$|E
2500|$|On one occasion, as Stephen was mopping {{the kitchen}} floor with a cloth, Rose accidentally stepped into the bowl of water he had been using to perform this task. In response, Rose smashed the boy {{over the head with}} the bowl, then {{repeatedly}} kicked him in the head and chest as she shouted: [...] "You did that on purpose, <b>you</b> <b>little</b> swine!" [...] On another occasion, Rose became hysterical at a missing kitchen utensil, then grabbed a knife she had been using to cut a slab of meat, repeatedly inflicting light scour marks to Mae's chest until her rib cage was covered with light knife wounds. All the while, Mae had screamed, [...] "No, Mum! No, Mum!" [...] as Stephen and Heather stood by, helplessly sobbing. Even Fred occasionally became the recipient of Rose's violence. On one occasion in the late 1970s, Rose chased after Fred with a carving knife in her hand, although Fred was able to slam shut the door of the room into which he had run as Rose plunged at him with the knife, resulting in the knife embedding itself in the door, and Rose's fingers sliding down the blade, almost severing them from her hand. In response, Rose calmly wrapped her hand in a towel and said: [...] "Look what you done, fella. You've got {{to take me to the}} hospital now." ...|$|E
2500|$|There are two {{variations}} {{about how}} the elder of her two children by Charles was given the Earldom of Burford, {{both of which are}} unverifiable: The first (and most popular) is that when Charles was six years old, on the arrival of the King, Nell said, [...] "Come here, <b>you</b> <b>little</b> bastard, and say hello to your father." [...] When the King protested against her calling Charles that, she replied, [...] "Your Majesty has given me no other name by which to call him." [...] In response, Charles created him Earl of Burford. Another is that Nell grabbed young Charles and hung him out of a window of Lauderdale House in Highgate, where she briefly resided, and threatened to drop him unless he was granted a peerage. The King cried out [...] "God save the Earl of Burford!" [...] and subsequently officially created the peerage, saving his son's life. On 21 December 1676, a warrant was passed for [...] "a grant to Charles Beauclerc, the King's natural son, and to the heirs male of his body, of the dignities of Baron of Heddington, co. Oxford, and Earl of Burford in the same county, with remainder to his brother, James Beauclerc, and the heirs male of his body." [...] A few weeks later, James was given [...] "the title of Lord Beauclerc, with the place and precedence of the eldest son of an earl." ...|$|E

2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the first season, 16-year-old Lucas Scott is recruited by coach Whitey Durham to play for the Ravens basketball team after most of the players are suspended for drunk-driving. He soon has troubles with his half-brother Nathan, who is also the Ravens captain, because Nathan wants to remain the star of the team and feels threatened by Lucas's arrival. Encouraged by Dan, who also wants Lucas off the team, Nathan and his teammates make life difficult for Lucas, on one occasion kidnapping him and throwing him into a ditch. Nevertheless, Lucas is determined to stay on the team (although he removes the name [...] "Scott" [...] from his jersey). He is attracted to and shares a deep emotional connection with Peyton (Nathan's girlfriend). Disgusted by Nathan's behavior towards his brother, she eventually breaks up with him. Nathan retaliates by pursuing Lucas's best friend Haley, who agrees to tutor Nathan in return for him leaving Lucas alone. Lucas and Peyton fall in love, but Peyton is initially scared of a romance with Lucas (not wanting to be [...] "serious" [...] with him). Lucas is devastated and starts seeing Peyton's best friend, Brooke, at the same moment Peyton realizes she has made a mistake in turning Lucas away. He soon cheats on Brooke with Peyton, though sex is never involved in the betrayal. On the night that Lucas and Peyton are about to tell Brooke about their affair, Lucas and Keith are involved in a car accident, and, {{for the first time in}} the series, Dan calls Lucas his son so that Lucas can get immediate treatment. Lucas wakes up from a short coma and wants to be with Peyton, but Peyton ends their affair for Brooke's sake after Brooke finds out about their tryst. Lucas's feelings towards Dan are challenged when he learns that Dan wanted joint custody of Lucas, but Karen refused. He also finds himself in Dan's position when Brooke claims to be pregnant, although this turns out to be false as Brooke was lying to seek her revenge on Lucas for breaking her heart. His friendship with Peyton is broken once she learns he had a one-night stand with new resident Nicki not long after she ended their affair. However, his relationship with Nathan improves as Lucas realizes that he got a better deal than Nathan, who is damaged as a result of being raised by Dan. Wanting a fresh start, Lucas decides to leave town with Keith. Lucas and Nathan have a final conversation where Nathan calls Lucas his brother and Lucas says, [...] "I'll miss <b>you,</b> <b>little</b> brother." [...] Before leaving with Keith, he goes to say goodbye to Haley and discovers that she and Nathan have married.|$|E
