500|$|Sarah Warn, {{editor-in-chief}} of lesbian-based website AfterEllen.com, {{thought that the}} portrayal of Emily and Naomi's relationship in the episode was [...] "a good example of a well-plotted, well-executed, and well-acted storyline coming to a satisfying conclusion", which she regarded as [...] "a noteworthy event given how few TV shows <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> about". She felt that Emily's changing relationship with Katie as {{a significant part of}} her character development made her [...] "sympathetic and relatable to those who might have otherwise have difficulty relating to a lesbian character". One critic for PopSugar.com wrote that in this episode the [...] "drama was still in full flow" [...] despite the absence of principal characters Effy and Cook, and was impressed with the episode's [...] "uplifting ending". They believed that Ronni Ancona was [...] "fab" [...] as the twins' mother, and regarded Pandora and Doug's dance at the ball as a [...] "fantastic comic moment". Ellie Newton-Syms of InJournalism Magazine was [...] "thrilled" [...] with the conclusion of Katie and Emily's storyline. The entertainment editor for eurOut.org, a website for European lesbians, wrote that she [...] "almost [...] like joining in" [...] when Emily cried after breaking up with Naomi, and thought that the twins' secret language was [...] "very cute and adorable". Dan French, in a review for Digital Spy, highlighted the episode's [...] "dramas aplenty" [...] and believed Katie and Emily's parents to be [...] "slightly creepy". The Suns Keeley Bolger described Katie and Emily's falling out as [...] "spectacular".|$|E
2500|$|I {{would not}} find this a problem if {{students}} were informed that this was possible, for privacy's sake. However, what was appalling was {{that not only did}} the District not inform parents and students of this fact … hile you may feel that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> this access will not be abused, I feel that this is not enough to ensure the integrity of students, and that even if it was no one would have any way of knowing (especially end-users). [...] I feel it would be best that students and parents are informed of this before they receive their computers.... I could see not informing parents and students of this fact causing a huge uproar.|$|E
2500|$|Coretta {{transferred}} out of Antioch {{when she}} won a scholarship to the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston. It was while studying singing at that school with Marie Sundelius that she met Martin Luther King, Jr. after mutual friend Mary Powell gave King her phone number after he asked about girls on the campus. Coretta {{was the only one}} remaining after Powell named two girls and King proved to not be impressed with the other. Scott initially showed little interest in meeting him, even after Powell told her that he had a promising future, but eventually relented and agreed to the meeting. King called her on the telephone and when the two met in person, Scott was surprised by how short he was. King would tell her that she had all the qualities that he was looking for in a wife, which Scott dismissed since the two had only just met. She told him [...] "I don't see how <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>that.</b> You don't even know me." [...] But King was assured and asked to see her again. She readily accepted his invitation to a weekend party.|$|E

2500|$|On {{returning}} to New York City in January 1937, Schneider {{claimed he was}} never paid in full. Spain claimed that they were paid in full, and were not owed any money. Others who flew for the loyalists included: Bert Acosta, Gordon Berry, and Frederic Ives Lord. When he returned he was questioned by Chief Assistant United States Attorney, John F. Dailey on January 15, 1937 in New York. Eddie's lawyer was Colonel Lewis Landes. On January 20, 1937, Eddie, Bert, and Gordon flew to Washington, D.C. and had to testify again. When talking to reporters Eddie said: I was broke, hungry, jobless... yet {{despite the fact that}} all three of us are old-time aviators who did our part {{for the development of the}} industry, we were left out in the cold in the Administration's program of job making. Can you blame us for accepting the lucrative Spanish offer? He later said [...] "This was a mess... and there was always that never-ending jockeying for the power among the factions to contend with, it got to the point where we did not know who we were fighting and why, and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> we are damn glad to be back." [...] The flyers had their passports confiscated, and they were to be returned when they attested that they had never forsworn allegiance to America.|$|E
2500|$|Overall, the {{majority}} of royal biographers have agreed that even if Charles and Camilla wanted to marry or did try for approval to get married, {{it would have been}} declined, because according to Charles's cousin and godmother Patricia Mountbatten, palace courtiers at that time found Camilla unsuitable as a wife for the future king. In 2005, she stated, [...] "With hindsight, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Charles should have married Camilla when he first had the chance. They were ideally suited, we know that now. But it wasn't possible." [...] "it wouldn't have been possible, not then." [...] When Charles heard of the engagement of Camilla and Andrew Parker Bowles in 1973, he wrote to Lord [...] Mountbatten: [...] "I suppose the feeling of emptiness will pass eventually." [...] Nevertheless, they remained friends. In August 1979, Lord Mountbatten was assassinated by the IRA. Charles was grief-stricken and relied heavily on Camilla for solace. During this period, rumours began circulating among family, friends and neighbours that they had rekindled their intimate relationship. A source close to Camilla confirmed that by 1980 they had indeed rekindled as lovers. However, other sources assert it occurred earlier. Reportedly, Parker Bowles gave consent to the relationship during their marriage, while he also saw other women. In 1981, Charles married Lady Diana Spencer.|$|E
