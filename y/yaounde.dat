5|$|Ngwat-Mahop {{was born}} in <b>Yaoundé</b> on 16 September 1987, and grew up having Samuel Eto'o as his idol. He started his career for Cameroonian minnows Dragon Club de <b>Yaoundé,</b> {{being one of the}} most notable players ever {{to come out of the}} club.|$|E
5|$|Atangana lobbied in {{his later}} life for public health causes, such as the {{eradication}} of sleeping sickness. He never supported the expansion of Cameroun's public school system, since he believed that educated subjects might one day challenge his rule. Atangana's health began to fail him beginning in August 1943. On 1 September, he died in Mvolyé, <b>Yaoundé.</b>|$|E
5|$|Atangana's unfailing {{loyalty and}} subservience to Germany {{prevented}} the French from ever fully trusting him. His first task {{under the new}} colonial regime was to supervise gangs of forced road-construction labourers {{in the town of}} Dschang. In Atangana's absence, the French had appointed a Beti headman named Joseph Atemengue as their local representative in Jaunde (now known by the French spelling, <b>Yaoundé).</b> However, Atemengue never enjoyed the popularity Atangana had among the Beti. Atangana tried to secure an alliance with him by sending his 20-year-old, German-educated daughter, Katerina, to marry him, but she eventually fled from the much older Atemengue and back to her father. Atangana's work performance convinced the French to let him return to <b>Yaoundé</b> in late 1921 or early 1922.|$|E
5|$|Cameroon's {{population}} is almost evenly divided between {{urban and rural}} dwellers. Population density is highest in the large urban centres, the western highlands, and the northeastern plain. Douala, <b>Yaoundé,</b> and Garoua are the largest cities. In contrast, the Adamawa Plateau, southeastern Bénoué depression, {{and most of the}} South Cameroon Plateau are sparsely populated.|$|E
5|$|His {{political}} party, the Cameroon National Union (CNU), {{became the}} sole legal political party on 1 September 1966 and in 1972, {{the federal system}} of government was abolished in favour of a United Republic of Cameroon, headed from <b>Yaoundé.</b> Ahidjo pursued an economic policy of planned liberalism, prioritising cash crops and petroleum development. The government used oil money to create a national cash reserve, pay farmers, and finance major development projects; however, many initiatives failed when Ahidjo appointed unqualified allies to direct them.|$|E
5|$|Intercity bus {{services}} run {{by multiple}} private companies connect all major cities. They {{are the most}} popular means of transportation followed by the rail service Camrail. Rail service runs from Kumba in the west to Bélabo in the east and north to Ngaoundéré. International airports are located in Douala and <b>Yaoundé,</b> with a third under construction in Maroua. Douala is the country's principal seaport. In the north, the Bénoué River is seasonally navigable from Garoua across into Nigeria.|$|E
5|$|No {{one took}} over as {{paramount}} chief upon Atangana's death. His opulent palace went unoccupied and fell into ruins. However, traditional Cameroonian chieftaincies were re-established on 11 July 1977 by Decree #77/609, and by the 1990s, Cameroonian ethnic groups had rejuvenated these dormant traditions. Atangana's daughter Marie-Thérèse became the new Ewondo paramount chief. In December 2000, she began the renovation of his palace at Efoulan, <b>Yaoundé,</b> a project that would cost an estimated 150,000,000 francsCFA.|$|E
5|$|Born in Cairo, Mido {{started his}} career with Egyptian Premier League club Zamalek in 1999. He made his league debut on 22 May 2000 in a 0–0 draw against El Qanah. The next week, Mido scored his first two goals against Aluminium Nag Hammâdi, which Zamalek won 3–2. His African debut came on 28 May 2000, in a 2–1 win against Ethiopian Coffee, making the {{aggregate}} score 3–3, {{which led to the}} game being decided on penalties. Zamalek won 4–2. Zamalek eventually reached the 2000 African Cup Winners' Cup final, beating Cameroonian side Canon <b>Yaoundé</b> 4–3 on aggregate. Mido's performances eventually attracted interest from Belgian club Gent.|$|E
5|$|The {{colonialism}} that Atangana {{had supported}} was ruinous in Cameroon. Production centred on enriching the chiefs, wooing of foreign investment, and the apparatus of colonial administration, and building only that infrastructure that would {{aid in the}} transport and export of cash crops. Nevertheless, Atangana's story became part of Beti folklore. For example, Beti storytellers related his tale in oral poems and songs that took up to a full night to recite. His legacy was largely forgotten by the nation at large between his death and Cameroonian independence. However, the nationalist scholarship that blossomed after Cameroon's independence in 1960 resurrected his story. Charles Atangana Avenue in downtown <b>Yaoundé</b> is named for him. A statue in his likeness tops a hill nearby, which had fallen into disrepair by 2000.|$|E
5|$|During {{his early}} years, Boganda {{was adopted by}} Catholic missionaries. As a boy he {{attended}} the school opened at Mbaiki (the administrative centre for the Lobaye prefecture) by the post's founder, Lieutenant Mayer. From December 1921 to December 1922, he spent {{two hours a day}} with Monsignor Jean-Réné Calloch learning how to read, while spending the rest of his time performing manual labour. On 24 December, he was received into the church under the name Barthélemy, in honour of one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus Christ who was believed to have worked as Christian missionary in Africa. Father Gabriel Herrau sent Boganda to the Catholic School of Betou and then to the school of the Saint Paul Mission at Bangui, where he completed his primary studies under Mgr Calloch, whom he would consider his spiritual father. The missionaries there, encouraged by his intellectual promise and pious demeanour, helped him continue secondary studies at small seminaries in Brazzaville and Kisantu (under Belgian Jesuits) before he moved on to the great seminary at <b>Yaoundé.</b> On 17 March 1938, fulfilling an ambition he had had since age twelve, he was ordained and became the first Roman Catholic priest native to Oubangui-Chari, as the colony was then called. He ministered at Bangui, Grimari and Bangassou, and in 1939, his bishop denied his request to join the French Army. He was needed at home, as many Frenchmen involved with the church had been recalled to the metropole to fight in World War II, during which he served in a number of missions.|$|E
25|$|This impasse {{resulted}} in the <b>Yaoundé</b> Declaration of November 9, 2016 through which African Photography Initiatives and other subscribers intended to generate {{a greater understanding of}} the value of photographs and films and analogue as well as digital archives for the studies in historic, human and social sciences. The declaration calls on the government and other stakeholders in Cameroon to make every effort in order to protect and make accessible for public use the country’s photographic and cinematographic heritage. As a first step, the <b>Yaoundé</b> Declaration recommends the recognition of the CPPA-B and the National Photo Library <b>Yaoundé</b> as cultural property as intended in the law on Cultural Heritage in Cameroon from 18 April 2013.|$|E

25|$|For {{a region}} so heavily forested, the South has a fairly {{developed}} transportation network. Four main roads service the greater {{area of the}} province. The first of these, National Road 2, runs from <b>Yaoundé</b> to Ambam {{and then to the}} border with Gabon and Equatorial Guinea. National Road 7 is located completely in the South, travelling along the coast from Kribi to Campo. National Road 9 comes south from <b>Yaoundé</b> via Mbalmayo and then to Sangmélima, Djoum, and Mintom. Finally, National Road 17 begins at Sangmélima and goes to Megong before crossing the border to Gabon. Other major roads cover the stretches between Mbalmayo and Ebolowa and between Kribi and Edéa in the Littoral Province. Of these, the route from Edéa to Kribi and from Ebolowa and Sangmélima to <b>Yaoundé</b> are paved. All other roads in the province are dirt, and thus subject to weather conditions.|$|E
25|$|In December 1971 Cameroon {{hosted the}} first {{regional}} African youth conference in <b>Yaounde.</b> Bus loads and cars of youth came from Chad and the Central African Republic, including youth visiting from the Philippines, Malaysia, India, Iran, Canada and the United States then in Chad and Cameroon {{for a period}} of service to the community came - during the conference two radio interviews were given. Book exhibits were held in 1974 in the University in <b>Yaounde</b> and a classroom in the Pan-African Institute of the Buea which also attracted radio coverage. In 1978 an international Bahá'í youth Conference was held in Cameroon with 380 attendees from some 19 countries.|$|E

25|$|Over 600 Bahá’ís {{and their}} friends {{gathered}} at the Palais des congrès in <b>Yaoundé</b> to celebrate the Golden Jubilee {{of the founding of}} the Bahá'í community in Cameroon. Mr. and Mrs. Nakhjavani and other guests of honour, went to Limbe to visit the Bahá'í s of the southwest province, and Buea where they were received by the paramount chief, and travelled to Douala.|$|E
25|$|Rural {{inhabitants}} of the South also practice hunting and gathering. Hunters traditionally utilise basic tools such as spears, bows and arrows, knives, and traps. In modern times, guns are increasingly used as well. This latter development {{has led to a}} great depopulation of many animal species, especially as demand has risen in urban centers such as <b>Yaoundé</b> for bush meat from the region.|$|E
25|$|Belonogaster juncea juncea is a {{subspecies}} of Belonogaster juncea and {{is classified}} as a primitively eusocial wasp, meaning that the species is social while exhibiting a morphology that is indistinguishable from that of other castes.

25|$|By 2001 the National Spiritual Assembly was {{registered}} with the Government of Cameroon {{as one of the}} few non-Christian religions. Also in 2003 a project had begun to move the seat of the National Spiritual Assembly from Limbe, in the west, to the central capital, <b>Yaoundé,</b> together with the responsibility to acquire a new National Bahá'í Centres for which the Bahá’í community of the United Kingdom has been asked to help.|$|E
25|$|Based {{physically}} at the <b>Yaounde</b> - Cameroon, it {{is about}} a unique structure of support which aims at improving all the practices which contribute to the smooth running {{of higher education in}} Africa. Its vocation is to accompany the modernization of the governance of higher education thanks to the implementation of expertise, the modules of training, seminars and workshops and especially specific tools of management, analysis and evaluation. It spreads his actions on the whole domain of governance (academic, administrative, financial, social, numerical and of the research) and has a function of observatory of higher education in Africa.|$|E
25|$|Over 324,000 Cameroonians {{live in the}} South Province, and {{the overall}} {{population}} density is about seven inhabitants per square km. The most populous area is the central region south of Cameroon's capital, <b>Yaoundé,</b> in the neighbouring Centre Province and extending south to Ebolowa, west to Kribi, and east to Sangmélima. The {{rest of the population}} lives in the villages and towns built around the roads that criss-cross the terrain. In contrast, the vast tracts of jungle that have little or no road access are scarcely populated. The forest area is also plagued by disease-carrying mosquitoes and blackflies that keep settlers away.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, Isaac Njilah, a {{geologist}} at the University of <b>Yaoundé,</b> {{suggested that the}} natural dam of volcanic rock that keeps in the lake's waters could collapse in the near future. Erosion has worn the dam away, causing holes and pockets to develop in the dam's upper layer, and water already passes through the lower section. Meanwhile, landslides have reduced dam strength on the outside. Seismic activity caused by the lake's volcanic foundation could thus cause the lake wall to give way, resulting in up to 50million cubic metres (1.8billion cuft) of water flooding downhill into areas of the Northwest Province and the Nigerian states of Taraba and Benue. Njilah estimates that the area is {{home to more than}} 10,000people.|$|E
25|$|The Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa {{was founded}} in 1810 as {{a branch of the}} École normale supérieure by Napoleon and later gained independence. ENS and its Italian twin have {{retained}} very close links since this time and since 1988 a special partnership has 80 normaliens going to Pisa every year while half the class of the SNS spend a year at the Paris school. During its history and due to the far reach of the French Empire during the colonial era, many schools have been created around the world based on the ENS model, from Haiti (in Port-au-Prince) to Vietnam (in Hanoi) to the Maghreb (in Tunis, Casablanca, Oran, and Rabat to name but a few) and Subsaharan Africa (in Nouakchott, Libreville, <b>Yaoundé,</b> Dakar, Niamey, Bangui for example). ENS maintains good relations and close links with these institutions. In 2005, ENS opened a branch at the East China Normal University (ECNU) in Shanghai, whose French name was changed to École normale supérieure de l'Est de la Chine to reflect the agreement, and a joint doctoral program between the two institutions was launched.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{rigorous}} system of archiving {{put in place}} by the British administration in the mid-50s, which was maintained by the archive's librarian, Martha Mosinga, after independence, the contents of the CPPA-B are in relatively good shape. However, under the present climatic conditions the holdings are jeopardised by high humidity and temperatures. The Archives contain approximately 120,000 negatives, 14,000 proof sheets (templates on which up to 16 contact prints were mounted for the purpose of reference) and 12 register books. Generally, approximately 500 negatives that are packed in paper envelopes are stored in small wooden boxes. Some of the negatives in the CPPA-B present visual evidence of events such as, among many others, the Governor General’s tour of the Southern Cameroons in December 1957, the Premier’s arrival from the UNO Conference in New York City on 16 March 1959, United Nations Secretary General Dag Hammarskjöld’s arrival at Tiko airport from <b>Yaoundé,</b> views of Victoria’s Barclays Bank building, and the Commonwealth Youth Sunday Celebrations in Buea and Victoria.|$|E
25|$|Cameroon, the world's {{fourth largest}} cocoa producer, saw large scale rioting in late February 2008 in Douala, the country's {{commercial}} capital. Protesters were against inflating food and fuel prices, {{as well as}} the attempt by President Paul Biya to extend his 25-year rule. Protesters set up barricades, burned tires, and targeted businesses that they believed belonged to the Biya family, high members of the ruling party, the government, or France. It became the first protest in the nation's history in which minute- by-minute events were covered by social media. By 27 February, a strike was taking place in thirty-one cities, including <b>Yaoundé,</b> Douala, Bamenda, Bafoussam, Buea, Limbe, Tiko, Muea, Mutengene, and Kumba. At least seven people were killed in the worst unrest seen in the country in over fifteen years. This figure was later increased to 24. Youths were mobilized in ways that had not been seen {{since the days of the}} villes mortes. Part of the government response to the protests was a reduction in import taxes on foods including rice, flour, and fish. The government reached an agreement with retailers by which prices would be lowered in exchange for the reduced import taxes. As of late April 2008, however, reports suggested that prices had not eased and in some cases had even increased.|$|E
25|$|The {{premises}} of the CPPA-B {{is part of}} the old administrative centre of Buea Town and located in an old wooden colonial building. The administrative organ responsible for the management of the CPPA-B is the Ministry of Communication whose Regional Delegation’s office is nearby. The building next to the CPPA-B hosts the National Archives Buea, which is under the authority of the Ministry of Arts and Culture. With the abolition of the Federal system in 1975, Cameroon's national archives were centralised in <b>Yaoundé,</b> the capital of the United Republic of Cameroon. The photographs (negatives, contact prints and proof sheets) which are kept in the CPPA-B cover the years from November 1955 to 2000. With the retirement of the last photographer who worked in that service in 2001, the CPPA-B was locked down and abandoned. Some renovations of the exterior were carried out on the building just {{a few days before the}} celebration of the 50th anniversary of the reunification of Anglophone and Francophone Cameroon in February 2014. Inside the building itself, however, nothing was done. In its present state, the CPPA-B lacks the building integrity, security, fire protection, and air quality control that are basic requirements for a long-term archive.|$|E
25|$|From January to March 1970 Rúhíyyih Khanum crossed Africa {{from east}} to west visiting many country's {{communities}} including Cameroon, meeting with individuals and institutions both Bahá'í and civic. In October 1971 Rúhíyyih Khanum returned from western Africa. She stopped for a time in Mamfe and spoke to the Bahá'ís there and emphasized {{the role of women in}} the growth of the religion. From Mamfe she traveled more widely seeing villages and regional chiefs, attending weddings and giving talks at schools. In many places she took note of women in prominent positions in the community and sometimes spoke to about the Bahá'í law of monogamy to contrast with the traditional cultural practice of polygamy and other traditional forms. A prominent meeting was of the regional conference calling for the progress of the religion in the region. She took part in the program of observances of United Nations Day sharing the stage with members of the staff of the Secretary-General of the UN as well as the staff of the Prime Minister of Cameroon. Reaching Buea she met with the Prime Minister and mentioned her wide travels in relative safety with kind assistance of villagers and truck drivers. From there she continued her travels through Douala and <b>Yaounde</b> and in each case also neighboring villages while also making time for radio interviews and at the University of Cameroon before moving on to Zaire.|$|E
500|$|Collecting {{taxes and}} finding labour grew {{increasingly}} difficult as the decade progressed, thanks to {{greater access to}} paying employment in <b>Yaoundé</b> and on the plantations.

500|$|In 1925, the French {{reduced the}} number of Beti chiefs to 40 and removed the chiefs of <b>Yaoundé</b> from Atangana's direct control. However, in 1928 the <b>Yaoundé</b> chiefs were deemed quarrelsome and incompetent, and Atangana was once again placed over them. In 1929, he wrote a work on {{traditional}} Beti society in which he tried to hide his unremarkable childhood by taking the title of [...] "King" [...] and claiming descent from a fictitious line of Ewondo royalty. By the end of the decade, he was the head of perhaps 130,000 people, the chief of Mvolyé village, and the supervisor of eight sectional chiefs and 72 village chiefs. In reality, his position was one of prestige but little actual power.|$|E
500|$|Atangana {{was born}} {{sometime}} between 1876 and 1885 in Mvolyé, {{a small village}} in what is today <b>Yaoundé,</b> Cameroon. His parents gave him the drum name [...] "He who is known by the nations". He was the eleventh of twelve children born to Essomba Atangana, a headman of the Mvog Atemenge sublineage of the Ewondo ethnic group. Essomba Atangana was {{one of thousands of}} minor Beti leaders living between the Sanaga and Nyong rivers, each charged with providing for his compound and the extended family and slaves who lived there. His father died when Ntsama Atangana was about six years old.|$|E
500|$|French and English are the {{official}} languages of Cameroon. The country {{is often referred}} to as [...] "Africa in miniature" [...] for its geological and cultural diversity. Natural features include beaches, deserts, mountains, rainforests, and savannas. The highest point at almost [...] is Mount Cameroon in the Southwest Region of the country, and the largest cities in population-terms are Douala on the Wouri river, its economic capital and main seaport, <b>Yaoundé,</b> its political capital, and Garoua. After independence, the newly united nation joined the Commonwealth of Nations, although the vast majority of its territories had previously been a German colony and, after World War I, a French mandate. The country is well known for its native styles of music, particularly makossa and bikutsi, and for its successful national football team.|$|E
