25|$|If {{you could}} {{demonstrate}} that the BBC was grossly extravagant {{there might be a}} case for saying OK take it away. But in fact the BBC per minute in almost every category is as cheap as you can find anywhere in the world and produces the best quality. If you take the money away, which part of the BBC will you remove? The BBC has gone through swingeing staff cuts. It has been cut to the bone, if you divert licence fee money elsewhere, <b>you</b> <b>cut</b> quality and services. There is always that threat from politicians who will say your licence fee is up for grabs. We will take it. There {{is a lot of people}} who want to see the BBC weakened. They talk of this terrible tax of the licence fee. Yet it is the best bargain that is going. Four radio channels and god knows how many TV channels. It is piffling.|$|E

500|$|Henry [...] "Hank" [...] Gorham Crisp {{was born}} on December 10, 1896, at Crisp, North Carolina. At the age of five, Crisp moved {{with his family to}} Falkland, North Carolina where his father {{operated}} a retail store. At the age of 13, he lost his right hand {{as a result of an}} accident that occurred as he helped his father fill a silo. After he graduated from Blackstone Military Academy in 1914, Crisp enrolled at Hampden–Sydney College where he played under Charles A. Bernier on the Tigers' football team. After his first game against VMI, one of the Keydets' coaches, impressed by Crisp's performance, told coach Bernier, [...] "Why don't <b>you</b> <b>cut</b> one hand off all your players?" ...|$|E

500|$|Whytock and Ingram {{screened}} {{their version}} of Greed to studio executives, who responded favorably to it but worried that the tragic ending {{would be hard to}} sell to the public. Ingram then sent the 18-reel version to von Stroheim and told him, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>cut</b> one more frame I shall never speak to you again." [...] On April 10, 1924, the Goldwyn Company officially agreed to merge with Metro Pictures, putting von Stroheim's nemesis Thalberg directly in charge of Greed. Von Stroheim and Louis B. Mayer had a lengthy confrontation over the film's editing, which according to both men ended with von Stroheim claiming that all women were whores and Mayer punching him. Mayer disliked the film because of its lack of glamor, optimism or morality and considered it to be a guaranteed flop.|$|E
500|$|Kemper again {{brought his}} victims {{back to his}} mother's house, this time {{beheading}} them {{in his car and}} carrying a headless corpse into his mother's house to have sex with. He then dismembered the bodies, removed the bullets to prevent identification and, the next morning, discarded their remains. Remains were found at Eden Canyon a week after the murders, and more were found near Highway 1 in March. When questioned in a later interview as to why he removed his victim's head before having sex with the body, he explained: [...] "The head trip fantasies were a bit like a trophy. You know, the head is where everything is at, the brain, eyes, mouth. That's the person. I remember being told as a kid, <b>you</b> <b>cut</b> off the head and the body dies. The body is nothing after the head is cut off... well, that's not quite true, there's a lot left in the girl's body without the head." ...|$|E
500|$|In late 2000, Brooks was {{declared}} bankrupt by the Federal Court in Perth {{after failing to}} repay a 14,941.64 debt to BankWest. In May 2001, the police raided Brooks' Perth home and found a metre-high cannabis plant. Brooks claimed that the plant belonged to a friend, and then {{announced that he would}} be leaving the state. Having moved to South Australia in 2003, Brooks started Local, which he billed as the state's leading lifestyle magazine. The venture was run solely by him and his wife, and was dominated by advertising. Journalist Peter FitzSimons criticised the lack of grammar checking and copyediting, citing a quote from Kieren Perkins, which was rendered thus in the publication: [...] "I was over the moon. Winning is something you strive to do but when I consider all the factors being married two children twenty seven years of age competing in my third Games and I broke fifteen minutes twice in two days it really was quite outstanding and whichever way <b>you</b> <b>cut</b> it Grant Hackett was just the next generation of swimmer [...]" [...] Brooks stood 200cm and weighed 95kg during his career, but {{in the early part of}} the 21st century fought a battle with obesity, after ballooning to 150kg. As of 2007, he had lost substantial weight and fought off his alcohol problems.|$|E

500|$|Christie {{commented that}} [...] "people didn't do scenes {{like that in}} those days", and that she found the scenes {{difficult}} to film: [...] "There were no available examples, no role models ... I just went blank and Nic [...] shouted instructions." [...] The scene caused problems with censors {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic. [...] The American censor advised Nicolas Roeg explicitly, saying, [...] "We cannot see humping. We cannot see the rise and fall between thighs." [...] The scene's much celebrated fragmented style, in which scenes of the couple having sexual intercourse are intercut with scenes of the couple post-coitally getting dressed to go out to dinner, partly came about through Roeg's attempt to accommodate the concerns of the censors: [...] "They scrutinised it and found absolutely nothing they could object to. If someone goes up, <b>you</b> <b>cut</b> and the next time you see them they're in a different position, you obviously fill in the gaps for yourself. But, technically speaking, there was no 'humping' in that scene." [...] In the end, Roeg only cut nine frames from the sequence, and the film was awarded an R rating in the United States. In Britain, the British Board of Film Classification judged the uncut version to be [...] "tasteful and integral to the plot", and a scene in which Donald Sutherland's character can be clearly seen performing oral sex on Christie's character was permitted, but it was still given an X rating—an adults only certificate.|$|E
500|$|After {{reading the}} harsh reviews of [...] "Friday", Black said that [...] "those hurtful {{comments}} really shocked me." [...] Ark Music {{offered to take}} the video down from YouTube, but Black refused the offer, saying {{that she did not}} wish [...] "to give the haters the satisfaction that they got me so bad I gave up." [...] Black's father has accompanied her in public to guard against potential accosters. In response to criticism over the song's significant use of Auto-Tune, Black performed an acoustic version during an interview with ABC News, which earned over 180,000 dislikes on YouTube (84% of total ratings) by November 2011. Later in the interview Black's mother, Kelly, stated that she was [...] "angry and upset" [...] after Black was brought to tears by comments, such as [...] "I hope you go cut yourself and die" [...] and [...] "'I hope <b>you</b> <b>cut</b> yourself and get an eating disorder so you'll look pretty." [...] Black said, however, that soon she was able to ignore such comments, and asked Justin Bieber, her idol, to perform a duet with her. Although Bieber has not released an official announcement regarding the offer, he posted on Twitter [...] "sunday comes after saturday? weird." [...] Bieber later sang part of the chorus at one of his concerts. Rolling Stone's Perpetua again praised Black after the interview and said, [...] "She is actually a pretty decent singer. [...] She is a total sweetheart. [...] Black comes off as a well-adjusted, happy and grateful kid." [...] He also pointed out Black's intention to donate part of the profits from the song to school arts programs and relief efforts in Japan following the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. Benni Cinkle, who became known as [...] "that girl in pink" [...] and appears during the second verse of the video, released her own song entitled [...] "Can You See Me Now" [...] and created an anti-bullying organization (That Girl In Pink Foundation) due to the negative response she got from [...] "Friday".|$|E
