25|$|Pains {{occupy a}} {{distinct}} and vital {{place in the}} philosophy of mind for several reasons. One is that pains seem to collapse the appearance/reality distinction. If an object appears to you to be red it might not be so in reality, but if you seem to <b>yourself</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in pain you must be so: there can be no case here of seeming at all. At the same time, one cannot feel another person’s pain, but only infer it from their behavior and their reports of it.|$|E

He reminded the six men and three women that they were not politicians and it was not their job to protect the image of the country. You have been told that this will have an international ramification and will affect the image of Mauritius… this is not your role, Fekna said. You must not allow <b>yourself</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> influenced by this, you are not politicians, you have to base yourself on what has happened.|$|E

500|$|Learning to be <b>yourself,</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{authentic}} {{and to act}} with integrity, rather than conforming to any external moral system, is arguably the fundamental motif of Williams's work, according to Sophie Grace Chappell. [...] "If there's one theme in all my work it's about authenticity and self-expression," [...] Williams said in 2002. [...] "It's the idea that some things are in some real sense really you, or express what you and others aren't... The whole thing has been about spelling out the notion of inner necessity." [...] He moved moral philosophy away from the Kantian question, [...] "What is my duty?", {{and back to the}} issue that mattered to the Greeks: [...] "How should we live?" ...|$|E

You expect <b>yourself</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the best friend, have a great career, be really talented and be able to cook—you just have to be great at everything. I think genders have been washed out a little bit -- like you have to have masculine qualities as well as feminine.

500|$|In {{making the}} album Parablepsia, Kawada {{describes}} {{the concept of}} the album as [...] "E.M.R.", which stands for [...] "Electric. Mami Kawada. Rock". She considers [...] "Borderland" [...] to be most representative of her style, so she wanted to make an album which included songs which sounded similar to it. Originally, she only wanted a single song to convey the theme of the album, but for Parablepsia, several songs do. This includes the title song [...] "Parablepsia", which she describes as a song about not losing yourself in a society which moves around in circles, [...] "Fly Blind", which is a song about not always allowing <b>yourself</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> influenced by society, [...] "Eager Eyes", which is the song in the album which has the closest style to [...] "Borderland", [...] "It's no big deal", which takes inspiration from a phrase that her father used to say to her, and [...] "Dendritic Quartz", which is about flowers which constantly bloom and will never wither; [...] "Dendritic Quartz" [...] takes inspiration from a pendant she owns which has a pattern of trees.|$|E

2500|$|After the tweet was posted, some Twitter users would {{sometimes}} juxtapose a screenshot {{of it with}} another tweet {{to indicate that the}} targeted person refused to acknowledge losing an argument or suffering some other humiliation. Use of the term [...] "corncob" [...] in this sense—without also quoting the source tweet for context—became widespread on Twitter in 2017. The Ringers Kate Knibbs observed that, while use and familiarity with the slang use of [...] "corncob" [...] remained limited to communities on Twitter, the term represents an archetype that is universal and identifiable throughout contemporary culture. According to Knibbs, [...] "the condition of being a corn cob—of allowing <b>yourself</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> defined by and reduced to a piercing insistence that a perceived slight has not diminished you— spread far beyond a small corner of Twitter." [...] Among public figures whose recent behavior fit the [...] "corncob" [...] archetype, Knibbs listed Donald Trump, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, actress Louise Linton, Kim Kardashian's friend Jonathan Cheban, Kanye West (noting his numerous outbursts and 2016 song [...] "Famous"), and Taylor Swift (noting her 2017 song [...] "Look What You Made Me Do").|$|E
2500|$|Keys {{began working}} on the album in May 2009. During this time, Keys and her audio {{engineer}} bought several vintage keyboards, describing the Moog as her [...] "special best friend". Recording took place in The Oven Studios in Long Island, New York. Keys expressed that she [...] "didn't know what to do" [...] when she {{began working on}} the album, but knew to do it. After exhausting herself, she stated that she [...] "finally found the key, {{and that is to}} allow <b>yourself</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> free". She explained that the album dealt with overcoming depression. She went on to say, [...] "I found more freedom. Before, I thought I could only show the strong side of me. Now there’s a mixture of strong and delicate. A new sound, a new emotion. That’s a lot of who I am right now" [...] Recording for the album was completed between August and September 2009. Keys described that she [...] "love melody so much", but approached the album with a [...] "free zone". The album includes production by Kerry [...] "Krucial" [...] Brothers, Jeff Bhasker, Noah [...] "40" [...] Shebib and Swizz Beatz.|$|E
2500|$|Baum's {{fairy tale}} {{contains}} many other allusions to American {{life in the}} late 19th and early 20th centuries. For instance, Dorothy's loyal companion, Toto, could be a play on [...] "teetotalers" [...] which {{is a person who}} never drinks alcohol. The prohibitionists deemed alcohol consumption should be unlawful and they were longtime political allies of Populists during the late 19th century. Toto trots [...] "soberly" [...] behind Dorothy on their adventure. The Winged Monkeys have been thought to resemble the Plains Indians who were [...] "once free people" [...] but were now enslaved by the Wicked Witch of the West. Their actions can be good or bad depending on how they are controlled; however, they [...] "belong to this country alone" [...] and therefore cannot leave, as can be said for American Indians. The Yellow Winkies that inhabit the Land of the West could represent Asian workers in California during the gold rush; their harsh work environment can be seen as enslavement. The lenses that the groups must wear before entering the City of Oz to dim the emeralds' shine turn out to be fake, like the Wizard. The Emerald City is not a city made of emeralds but a plain, white city where the emerald color lenses cast a green hue on everything and everyone. This shows that anything can be made to look spectacular if you allow <b>yourself</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> tricked. Baum traveled all over the United States and would have been introduced to all these events in the 19th century, making it very likely that he drew inspiration from the land around him.|$|E

2500|$|Speaking to The Sun {{newspaper}} in June 2008, Swash {{has talked about}} his dissatisfaction with the direction the producers had taken Mickey. In Swash's opinion, Mickey had only been used for [...] "light relief" [...] since September 2005, when Swash was forced to take a three-month break from the serial after he contracted meningoencephalitis — a rare form of viral meningitis, which makes the brain swell up. EastEnders writers were reported to be [...] "frantically reworking scripts" [...] to explain Mickey's sudden disappearance, and according to Swash, this meant that a big storyline concentrating {{on the relationship between}} Mickey and his estranged father Mike had to be cut. He has commented, [...] "My illness had a massive impact on my job. When I came back I couldn’t find my feet. New producers came in and brought in new actors and I got lost down the pecking order [...] Ever since I came back, I’ve had nothing regular. As an actor you want storylines to stretch <b>yourself.</b> <b>To</b> <b>be</b> fair, I didn't work as much when the Miller family arrived in 2004. When it was just Mickey, I got really good stuff. I was over the moon about the family but producers needed to concentrate on developing their characters and I had to take a back seat [...] Mickey just became light relief – the joker. That’s all right but I’ve got more ambition. I would have stayed for ages if I had good stuff, but I wasn’t getting the work [...] I wasn't that upset when I was told [...] I kind of predicted it [...] My character hadn’t been working out for ages [...] it will be a relief not to be Mickey Miller any more!" ...|$|E
