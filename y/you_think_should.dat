60|$|I am {{very well}} {{pleased with the}} good opinion you express of me; and wish it were any way {{in my power to}} answer your expectations, for the service of my country. I have {{carefully}} read your several schemes and proposals, which <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>should</b> be offered to the Parliament. In answer, I will assure you, that, in another place, I have known very good proposals rejected with contempt by public assemblies, merely because they were offered from without doors; and yours, perhaps, might have the same fate, especially if handed into the public by me, who am not acquainted with three members, nor have the least interest with one. My printers have been twice prosecuted, to my great expense, on account of discourses I writ for the public service, without the least reflection on parties or persons; and the success I had in those of the Drapier, was not owing to my abilities, but to a lucky juncture, when the fuel was ready for the first hand that would be at the pains of kindling it. It is true, both those envenomed prosecutions were the workmanship of a judge, who is now gone to his own place.[95] But, let that be as it will, I am determined, henceforth, never to be the instrument of leaving an innocent man at the mercy of that bench.|$|E
6000|$|SCENE II.--AMANDA's Dressing-room. Enter AMANDA {{followed}} by her MAID. Maid. If you please, madam, only {{to say whether}} you'll have me buy them or not? Aman. Yes--no--Go, teaser; I care not what you do. Pr'ythee, leave me. [Exit MAID.] Enter BERINTHIA. Ber. What, {{in the name of}} Jove, is the matter with you? Aman. The matter, Berinthia! I'm almost mad; I'm plagued to death. Ber. Who is it that plagues you? Aman. Who do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>should</b> plague a wife but her husband? Ber. O, ho! is it come to that?--We shall have you wish yourself a widow, by-and-by. Aman. Would I were anything but what I am! A base, ungrateful man, to use me thus! Ber. What, has he given you fresh reason to suspect his wandering? Aman. Every hour gives me reason. Ber. And yet, Amanda, you perhaps at this moment cause in another's breast the same tormenting doubts and jealousies which you feel so sensibly yourself. Aman. Heaven knows I would not. Ber. Why, you can't tell but there may be some one as tenderly attached to Townly, whom you boast of as your conquest, as you can be to your husband? Aman. I'm sure, I never encouraged his pretensions. Ber. Psha! psha! no sensible man ever perseveres to love without encouragement. Why have you not treated him as you have Lord Foppington? Aman. Because he presumed not so far. But let us drop the subject. Men, not women, are riddles. Mr. Loveless now follows some flirt for variety, whom I'm sure he does not like so well as he does me. Ber. That's more than you know, madam. Aman. Why, do you know the ugly thing? Ber. I think I can guess at the person; but she's no such ugly thing neither. Aman. Is she very handsome? Ber. Truly I think so. Aman. Whate'er she be, I'm sure he does not like her well enough to bestow anything more than a little outward gallantry upon her. Ber. [Aside.] Outward gallantry! I can't bear this.-- [Aloud.] Come, come, don't you be too secure, Amanda: while you suffer Townly to imagine that you do not detest him for his designs on you, you have no right to complain that your husband is engaged elsewhere. But here comes the person we were speaking of. Enter COLONEL TOWNLY. Col. Town. Ladies, as I come uninvited, I beg, if I intrude, you will use the same freedom in turning me out again. Aman. I believe it is near the time Loveless said he would be at home. He talked of accepting Lord Foppington's invitation to sup at Sir Tunbelly Clumsy's. Col. Town. His lordship has done me the honour to invite me also. If you'll let me escort you, I'll let you into a mystery as we go, in which you must play a part when we arrive. Aman. But we have two hours yet to spare; the carriages are not ordered till eight, and it is not a five minutes' drive. So, cousin, let us keep the colonel to play at piquet with us, till Mr. Loveless comes home. Ber. As you please, madam; but you know I have a letter to write. Col. Town. Madam, you know you may command me, though I am a very wretched gamester. Aman. Oh, you play well enough to lose your money, and that's all the ladies require; and so, without any more ceremony, let us go into the next room, and call for cards and candles. [Exeunt.] ...|$|E

60|$|About {{two o'clock}} in the day, Mr Alf did make a speech,--and a very good speech it was, if {{correctly}} reported in the 'Evening Pulpit.' Mr Alf was a clever man, ready at all points, with all his powers immediately at command, and, no doubt, he did make a good speech. But in this speech, in which we may presume that it would be his intention to convince the electors that they ought to return him to Parliament, because, of the two candidates, he was the fittest to represent their views, he did not say a word as to his own political ideas, not, indeed, a word that could be accepted as manifesting his own fitness for the place which it was his ambition to fill. He contented himself with endeavouring to show that the other man was not fit;--and that he and his friends, though solicitous of proving to the electors that Mr Melmotte was about the most unfit man in the world, had been guilty of nothing shabby in their manner of doing so. 'Mr Melmotte,' he said, 'comes before you as a Conservative, and has told us, by the mouths of his friends,--for he has not favoured us with many words of his own,-- that he is supported by the whole Conservative party. That party is not my party, but I respect it. Where, however, are these Conservative supporters? We have heard, till we are sick of it, of the banquet which Mr Melmotte gave yesterday. I am told that very few of those whom he calls his Conservative friends could be induced to attend that banquet. It is equally notorious that the leading merchants of the City refused to grace the table of this great commercial prince. I say that the leaders of the Conservative party have at last found their candidate out, have repudiated him;--and are seeking now to free themselves from the individual shame of having supported the candidature of such a man by remaining in their own houses instead of clustering round the polling booths. Go to Mr Melmotte's committee-room and inquire if those leading Conservatives be there. Look about, and see whether they are walking with him in the streets, or standing with him in public places, or taking the air with him in the parks. I respect the leaders of the Conservative party; but they have made a mistake in this matter, and they know it.' Then he ended by alluding to the rumours of yesterday. 'I scorn,' said he, 'to say anything against the personal character of a political opponent, which I am {{not in a position to}} prove. I make no allusion, and have made no allusion, to reports which were circulated yesterday about him, and which I believe were originated in the City. They may be false or they may be true. As I know nothing of the matter, I prefer to regard them as false, and I recommend you to do the same. But I declared to you long before these reports were in men's mouths, that Mr Melmotte was not entitled by his character to represent you in parliament, and I repeat that assertion. A great British merchant, indeed! How long, do <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> <b>should</b> a man be known in this city before that title be accorded to him? Who knew aught of this man two years since,--unless, indeed, it be some one who had burnt his wings in trafficking with him in some continental city? Ask the character of this great British merchant in Hamburg and Vienna; ask it in Paris;--ask those whose business here has connected them with the assurance companies of foreign countries, and you will be told whether this is a fit man to represent Westminster in the British parliament!' There was much more yet; but such was the tone of the speech which Mr Alf made with the object of inducing the electors to vote for himself.|$|E

5000|$|John Cage and I became {{interested}} in the use of chance in the 50s. I think one of the very primary things that happened then was the publication of the [...] "I Ching," [...] the Chinese book of changes, from which you can cast your fortune: the hexagrams.Cage took it to work in his way of making compositions then; and he used the idea of 64—the number of the hexagrams —to say that you had 64, for example, sounds; then you could cast, by chance, to find which sound first appeared, cast again, to say which sound came second, cast again, so that its done by, in that sense, chance operations. Instead of finding out what <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>should</b> follow—say a particular sound—what did the I Ching suggest?Well, I took this also for dance.I was working on a title called, “Untitled Solo,” and I had made—using the chance operations—a series of movements written on scraps of paper for the legs and the arms, the head, all different.

Smith was a strong advocate of the since obtained four-year status for Louisiana State University at Alexandria. In 2001, Smith {{was inducted into the}} Manship Hall of Fame. At the time, he described his newspaper philosophy accordingly: [...] "This {{is more than just a}} business. You have to be concerned about the world and where it's going, about your country and where it's going, about your city and your state and where they're going -- how you can influence what <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>should</b> be done.... There are far more concerns, far more rewards than in most careers or businesses."

Pulliam, the uncle of former Vice President Dan Quayle, held The Town Talk for only four years; the company itself was sold in 2000 to the Virginia-based Gannett Company.|$|E
