25|$|Sheriff Bill Presley and his deputies have a {{difficult}} task ahead of them {{as they attempt to}} solve the shocking double murder discovered Sunday morning. Texarkana residents can help in this investigation {{and at the same time}} if they are not careful, they can hinder the investigation and cause the officers to spend many hours following blind trails. Persons who have information which might furnish a clue to the identity of the slayer or slayers or which might indicate a motive for the crime should not divulge such information on street corners or at cold drink stands but should immediately make it available to the officers. Do not spread rumors regardless of how much basis for fact there is in them. Do not say 'I heard' or 'they say', because the chances are that the person listening will repeat your information and enlarge upon it. Before long the story grows to such proportions as to necessitate a detailed investigation by the officers, thereby perhaps pulling them off the true trail and sending them up a blind alley. Stick to facts that you know of <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>personal</b> knowledge and relay those facts as quickly as possible to the officers.|$|E

Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said: [...] "In {{an era when}} heavy rockers {{have no idea what}} happened in the '80s, much less the '30s, it's hard not to warm to this, even if his music isn't <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>personal</b> bag." [...] Barry McCallum of Independent Online called the album [...] "reckless and uninhibited—but it's not all that hard to imagine Manson letting go; he's had fun here." [...] Chronicles of Chaos also praised its concept, and {{went on to say that}} it might be one of the best albums in the band's discography, Alternative Press and Q each complimented the album's production, while Billboard highlighted the album's lyrical content and Manson's [...] "diatribes on religion, sex and prejudice." [...] Entertainment.ie called it an entertaining pop album, and summarized that [...] "the pop world would be a much more boring place without —and that's what really counts." ...|$|E

His main criticism was [...] "it doesn't really take any risks [...] it doesn't feel like it's an altogether new gaming experience." [...] However, he wrote [...] "True Crimes strengths lie in the solid ways that everything is put together." [...] He concluded [...] "it's a solid title through and through, but you won't find {{a whole lot of}} water cooler moments in there [...] If you're tired of the whole GTA thing and want more substance, {{this may not be the}} game for you. For everyone else though, TC: NYC is definitely worth checking out." [...] He scored the PC version 6.5 out of 10, and was critical of Aspyr's work on the port; [...] "it seems the company did little more than get the game up and running on the PC and didn't bother to fine-tune a few of the controls for the system." [...] He was highly critical of the graphics; [...] "Pop-up is a major problem [...] LOD on characters is also pretty screwy, with entirely mis-matched low-res models filling in for some characters [...] shadows and such pop in and out of view, camera movement during cutscenes would cut at odd times or display the wrong angle for a split second, etc. etc. It simply feels unpolished." ...|$|E

Eurogamer's Jim Rossignol was critical of the AI; [...] "the perps you take down never suggest that they are anything other than mindless automata ready to be slain, and exhibit an artificiality that could never be described as 'intelligence'."

[...] Of the graphics, he wrote, [...] "the frame rate {{has a knack for}} chugging. Considering it's a console and not a five year-old PC running this game, it's unacceptable. Out of nowhere, the frame rate will completely bottom out while Marcus patrols the streets." [...] He called the game [...] "unfinished." [...] GameSpot's Greg Mueller accused the game of being [...] "so riddled with problems that it feels like it was rushed to make it to store shelves in time for the holidays. He cited [...] "collision detection issues and edge detection problems that cause you to get stuck {{on the edge of a}} platform. [...] the game will actually freeze up entirely from time to time [...] There are also some pretty ugly clipping issues here too."

In this presentation I will discuss a framework, which leverages the ubiquity of the cell phone, to aggregate multiple wearable biological sensors.

Safety in Safe Routes to School goes beyond protecting children who are walking or bicycling from collisions with people driving cars. It also includes addressing personal safety threats like bullying, robbery, sexual harassment, and gang activity, as well as fear of violence and crime that can also pose a great barrier to walking, bicycling, and being physically active outdoors. When addressing violence and crime, we can draw from traditional components of Safe Routes to School programs, as well as strategies and intaitives often undertaken by other organizations who can become great allies in making the route to school – and the community as whole – safer. This action sheet provides an overview of the impacts of crime and violence on communities, specifically impacts on children walking and bicycling to school. It also addresses strategies to address personal safety concerns, and how to get started in <b>your</b> <b>own</b> community. <b>Personal</b> Safety Concerns Threats to children and teens traveling to and from school and being physically active in their neighborhoods take many forms. Violence and crime do not uniformly affect all communities. In some communities, certain personal safety concerns may be non-existent, while in others, they may pose a significant danger. Here are some concerns that can impact children safely walking, bicycling, and being physically active in their communities: Bullying. In 2013, about 22 percent of students ages 12 through 18 reported being bullied at school at least once during the school year. Bullying does not just occur when students are at school and it is likely that students who worry about being bullied on the school campus feel vulnerable when unaccompanied on the way to and from school...|$|R
