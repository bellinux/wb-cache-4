6000|$|... "Yes; {{but when}} they aren't, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> {{struggling}} to keep their eyes straight. A dog avoids your eye when he's something to conceal; a man stares at you. Listen!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Off in the curragh, yer honour. Me and Tim Connolly {{helped them}} carry it round the Nose, and they {{launched}} her there. There they are. Sure <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> for yourself." ...|$|E
60|$|TIMSON. On me larst legs, sir. 'Ere! <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>'em</b> for yerself! Shawn't trouble yer long....|$|R
6000|$|... "That's the idea, Scraps," [...] {{said the}} Glass Cat, approvingly. [...] "I'm glad {{to find you}} have decent brains. Mine are {{exceptionally}} good. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>'em</b> work; they're pink." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I beg {{to differ}} with you," [...] {{returned}} the cat, in a haughty tone. [...] "Three heads are better than two, and my pink brains are beautiful. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>'em</b> work." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, {{sometimes}} {{they have something}} like a book-case," [...] replied Jonas, [...] "with shelves and glass doors. Then the curiosities are all put upon the shelves, and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> through the glass doors. But this can only be done with very valuable curiosities." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Three nicks," [...] replied Grenfell. [...] "After {{the third}} one, a rounded peak. I can't tell whether I {{remember}} it from another time, but that description {{came to me}} as if I'd used it, and I think I must have done so. Anyway, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> yonder." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Of course, plenty. You {{have heard}} of the Mylodon, the {{gigantic}} Sloth? His bones, skin, and hair were lately found in a cave in Patagonia, with a lot of his fodder. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> at the British Museum in South Kensington. Primitive Patagonian man used the female of the species as a milch-cow. He was a genial friendly kind of brute, accessible to charm of manner and chopped hay. They fed him on that, in a domesticated state.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm glass, and transparent, too, {{which is}} more than can be said of some folks," [...] {{answered}} the cat. [...] "Also I have some lovely pink brains; <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>'em</b> work." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never. I don't complain, you know, {{at the way}} I'm made, for I've never {{yet seen}} any living thing as {{beautiful}} as I am. I have the handsomest brains in the world. They're pink, and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>'em</b> work." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Scraps hasn't enough {{brains to}} hurt her, so don't worry," [...] remarked the cat, which was {{trotting}} {{along in a}} very dainty and graceful manner. [...] "The only brains worth considering are mine, which are pink. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>'em</b> work." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Every reformation {{must have}} its victims. You can't expect the fatted calf {{to share the}} enthusiasm of the angels over the prodigal's return. Another darling {{weakness}} of the Academy {{is that none of}} its luminaries must 'arrive' in a hurry. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> coming for years, like a Balkan trouble or a street improvement, {{and by the time they}} have painted a thousand or so square yards of canvas, their work begins to be recognised." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't like {{leaving them}} to themselves. Look here, Surajah, {{you go down}} to the stable, and mount at once. Tell the syce I shall come for my horse in a few minutes. Then ride out, and take your post where <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> come out of the gate, and then follow them closely. I will stay here, and see them safely through the gate, and then mount and follow you. I shall {{overtake}} you before you get to the ford." ...|$|E
60|$|Then the Ethiopian put {{his five}} fingers close {{together}} (there {{was plenty of}} black left on his new skin still) and pressed {{them all over the}} Leopard, and wherever the five fingers touched they left five little black marks, all close together. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> on any Leopard's skin you like, Best Beloved. Sometimes the fingers slipped and the marks got a little blurred; but if you look closely at any Leopard now you will see that there are always five spots--off five fat black finger-tips.|$|E
6000|$|... "A pretty scene, ain't it?" [...] said Mr. M'Leod. [...] "My good lady's {{sitting under}} the tree, and that's {{my little girl}} in pink on the far court. But I'll take you to your room, and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>'em</b> all later." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{really is}} crazy," [...] remarked the Glass Cat. [...] "But that isn't to be {{wondered}} at when {{you remember how}} many different things she's made of. For my part, I'm made of pure glass--except my jewel heart and my pretty pink brains. Did you notice my brains, stranger? <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>'em</b> work." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So it is, partly; but {{it serves}} {{to keep the}} water out in the wet season too. If <b>you</b> watch <b>'em</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>'em</b> {{building}} the earth up and patting it down hard if it gets broken down. Sometimes, in very wet weather, thar will be a flood, and then the whole lot, dogs and owls and snakes, get drowned all together. Mighty nasty places they are, I tell yer, when they are desarted. At other times <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>'em</b> plain enough, and can ride through 'em at a gallop, for the horses are accustomed to pick thar way; but {{after a year or}} two, when the grass grows again, and is breast high in summer, and you come across one of them, the first you know about it is the horse puts his foot in a hole, and you are flying through the air. Many a fall have I had from them darned little things." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have had}} a light fixed there for the benefit or the fishermen," [...] he said, [...] "a light which I work from my own dynamo. Between where we are sitting now and there--only a little way out to sea--is a jagged cluster of cruel rocks. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> if you care to swim out in calm weather. Fishermen who tried to come in by night were often trapped there and, in a rough sea, drowned. That is why I had that pillar of light built. On stormy nights it shows the exact {{entrance}} to the water causeway." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All {{about him}} are the eyes, Taug, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>them!</b> But {{they do not}} come {{very close to the}} fire--there are few eyes close to Goro. They fear the fire! It is the fire that saves Goro from Numa. Do you see them, Taug? Some night Numa will be very hungry and very angry--then he will leap over the thorn bushes which {{encircle}} Goro and we will have no more light after Kudu seeks his lair--the night will be black with the blackness that comes when Goro is lazy and sleeps late into the night, or when he wanders through the skies by day, forgetting the jungle and its people." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, I {{want you}} to avoid the Stollers as far as <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>them.</b> This {{is to be a}} real wedding-journey day, with no {{extraneous}} acquaintance to bother; the more strangers the better. Wurzburg is richer than anything I imagined. I've looked it all up; I've got the plan of the city, so that we can easily find the way. We'll walk first, and take carriages whenever we get tired. We'll go to the cathedral at once; I want a good gulp of rococo to begin with; there wasn't half enough of it at Ansbach. Isn't it strange how we've come round to it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They live in {{the cottage}} by the big house <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> through <b>them</b> trees. His pop looks after Mr. Wilson's prize dawgs. That's his job." ...|$|R
6000|$|Butler {{shook his}} head. [...] "O Jeanie, this is entirely a wild dream. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> never <b>see</b> <b>them</b> but through some great lord's intercession, and I {{think it is}} scarce {{possible}} even then." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, {{many parts}} of the sea are full of creatures so small and so thin and colourless, that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> hardly <b>see</b> <b>them</b> even in a clear glass tumbler. Many of them are larger than others, but the most of them are very small." ...|$|R
6000|$|The Angler’s Guide to the Thames {{says that}} “jack and perch are {{also to be}} had about here,” but there the Angler’s Guide is wrong. Jack and perch may be about there. Indeed, I {{know for a fact}} that they are. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> there in shoals, when you are out for a walk along the banks: they come and stand half out of the water with their mouths open for biscuits. And, if you go for a bathe, they crowd round, and get in your way, and irritate you. But they are not to be “had” by a bit of worm on the end of a hook, nor {{anything}} like it—not they! ...|$|E
60|$|And Pau Amma? You can {{see when}} you go to the beach, how all Pau Amma's babies make little Pusat Taseks for {{themselves}} under every stone and bunch of weed on the sands; <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> waving their little scissors; and in some parts of the world they truly live on the dry land and run up the palm trees and eat cocoa-nuts, exactly as the girl-daughter promised. But once a year all Pau Ammas must shake off their hard armour and be soft-to remind them of what the Eldest Magician could do. And so it isn't fair to kill or hunt Pau Amma's babies just because old Pau Amma was stupidly rude a very long time ago.|$|E
6000|$|... "For goodness' sake, Hirst," [...] Hewet protested; [...] "one {{might think}} you were an old cripple of eighty. If it comes to that, I had an aunt who died of cancer myself, but I put a bold face on it--" [...] He rose and began tilting his chair {{backwards}} and forwards on its hind legs. [...] "Is any one here inclined for a walk?" [...] he said. [...] "There's a magnificent walk, up behind the house. You come out on to a cliff and look right down into the sea. The rocks are all red; <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> through the water. The other day I saw a sight that fairly took my breath away--about twenty jelly-fish, semi-transparent, pink, with long streamers, floating {{on the top of}} the waves." ...|$|E
50|$|It is {{threatened}} by habitat loss, and is mostly extirpated (extinct) apart from the Iberia Marshlands where <b>you</b> <b>can</b> still <b>see</b> <b>them</b> very rarely in Argentina. Approximately half of its range still exists {{in the north and}} northeast in southern Paraguay, northeastern Argentina, and western Uruguay.|$|R
5000|$|Deary {{has said}} of historians: [...] "They are nearly as seedy and devious as politicians... They pick on a {{particular}} angle and select the facts to prove their case and {{make a name for}} themselves... They don’t write objective history... Eventually <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> through <b>them</b> all. They all come with a twist." ...|$|R
60|$|But {{when there}} is no chance for him to run away, he can often defend himself, for he can kick like a good fellow. His hind-legs fly so fast when he is kicking that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> hardly <b>see</b> <b>them,</b> and he has been known to drive off a lion by this means of defence.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you were}} better acquainted with us wood folk, you'd know that Jimmy Hedgehog is hiding {{over there in}} the ferns. Watch and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> waving {{directly}} against the wind, which tells that something heavy is moving among them. When I caught sight of those delicious clover heads I could see that young hedgehog was getting ready to go for them. The only thing that held him back was the fear that you might try to make trouble for him. I had to scoop them up lively, or they'd gone into Jimmy's stomach while you were asking questions. I {{may not be able to}} make such a terrible show of fighting; but when it comes to getting the best of whatever is being passed around your Mr. Bunny Rabbit doesn't often get left, more especially if Jimmy Hedgehog is the only fellow he has to beat.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you see," [...] she said, {{waving her}} hand to {{indicate}} the whole circuit of earth, [...] "how large it is? Look!" [...] pointing now to mountains in the west. [...] "Those are the Vahanas--one, two, three--the highest--I can tell you their names--Vahana-Chara, Chumi, Aranoa. Do you see that water? It is a river, called Guaypero. From the hills it comes down, Inaruna is their name, and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> there in the south--far, far." [...] And in this way she went on pointing out and naming all the mountains and rivers within sight. Then she suddenly dropped {{her hands to her}} sides and continued: [...] "That is all. Because we can see no further. But the world is larger than that! Other mountains, other rivers. Have I not told you of Voa, on the River Voa, where I was born, where mother died, where the priest taught me, years, years ago? All that you cannot see, it is so far away--so far." ...|$|E
60|$|It is {{a gloomy}} place here after all, and I shall be glad when I {{get out of}} it; for the river is down {{in the bottom of}} such a deep gorge, that we cannot see out any where. There are some old castles about on the hills, and they look pretty enough at a distance; but when you get near them they are nothing but old walls all {{tumbling}} down. The vineyards are not pretty either. They are all on terraces kept up by long stone walls; and when you are down on the river, and look up to them, you cannot see any thing but the walls, with the edge of the vineyards, like a little green fringe, along on the top. But there is no great loss in this, for the vineyards are not pretty when <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>them.</b> They look just like fields full of beans growing on short poles.|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{are the two}} men," [...] he continued, [...] "who are out {{to spoil}} my show if they <b>can.</b> <b>You</b> may <b>see</b> <b>them</b> again under very {{different}} circumstances." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, she's {{probably}} {{getting off}} some of those yarns of hers, or telling about some people. She can't {{step out of the}} house without coming back with more things to talk about than most folks would bring back from Japan. There ain't a ridiculous person she's ever seen but what she's got something from them to make you laugh at; and I don't believe we've ever had anybody in the house since the girl could talk that she hain't got some saying from, or some trick that'll paint <b>'em</b> out so't <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>'em</b> and hear 'em. Sometimes I want to stop her; but when she gets into one of her gales there ain't any standing up against her. I guess it's lucky for Irene that she's got Pen there to help entertain her company. I can't ever feel down where Pen is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, sir," [...] {{promptly}} replied Captain Cephas, [...] "I don't {{go to see}} no Mrs. Trimmer. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> both of <b>them</b> {{just the}} same as <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> one--they're all along the same way. I'll go cut the Christmas tree." ...|$|R
