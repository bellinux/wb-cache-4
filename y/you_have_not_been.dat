2500|$|The {{family first}} rented a house {{at what was}} called Nook Farm in 1871 before buying land there and {{building}} a new house. Twain said of Hartford, [...] "Of all the beautiful towns {{it has been my}} fortune to see, this is the chief…. You do not know what beauty is if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> here." [...] He was attracted to the town which had the highest per-capita income of any city in the United States at that time.|$|E
2500|$|... "Well, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> saints {{in the way}} {{you have}} acted toward the darker peoples of the world and toward even your own people. But, in truth, Mr. Russert, any human being who gives themself over to the doing of evil could be {{considered}} a devil. In the Bible, in the Book of Revelation, it talks about the fall of Babylon. It says Babylon is fallen because she has become the habitation of devils. We believe that that ancient Babylon is a symbol of a modern Babylon, which is America." ...|$|E
60|$|MRS GILBEY [rather shocked] I hope <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> exceeding, Juggins.|$|R

60|$|Limb. Nay, nothing; {{but that}} I thought <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> so well given. I was only afraid of Pug's jewels.|$|R
2500|$|The BBC {{was forced}} to apologise after many viewers complained about [...] "over-talking" [...] by its {{commentary}} team during the TV coverage of the event in 2011. It {{said in a statement}} that views on commentary were subjective but that they [...] "do appreciate that over-talking can irritate our audience". The BBC added that it hoped it had achieved [...] "the right balance" [...] across its coverage and was [...] "of course sorry if on occasion <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> satisfied". Tim Henman and John McEnroe were among the ex-players commentating.|$|E
2500|$|On August 5, {{shortly before}} his assassination, a priest visited García Moreno and warned him, [...] "You have been warned that your death was decreed by the Freemasons; but <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> told when. I have just heard that the assassins {{are going to try}} and carry out their plot at once. [...] For God's sake, take your {{measures}} accordingly!" [...] García Moreno replied that he had already received similar warnings and after calm reflection concluded that the only measure he could take was to prepare himself to appear before God.|$|E
2500|$|In 1975 the {{scientists}} said that Genie's voice had clearly strengthened and she modified both pitch and volume for emphasis and stress, but {{she continued to}} avoid speaking if possible because controlling her voice remained very difficult for her. Her vocalizations were still soft and breathy, and they wrote that, [...] "it is still very difficult to understand her if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> with her {{for a period of}} time." [...] In mid-1975 she could speak with a relatively normal declarative sentence stress pattern, and began to do so with increasing frequency. Even then her pronunciation also remained abnormal, as she still frequently deleted and substituted sounds in her speech, and she remained unable to use intonation to indicate a question.|$|E

6000|$|... "My dear Dora, I wish <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> so hasty," [...] Mary was gently saying; but Edmund was {{standing}} up, looking quite judicial.|$|R

60|$|THE WOMAN. I cannot {{understand}} you at all. I fear <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> observing the rules laid down for shortlived visitors.|$|E
60|$|BROADBENT [taking off {{his leather}} cap {{with dignity and}} placing it on the table]. I hope <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> anxious about me.|$|E
6000|$|... "If <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> in uniform, <b>you</b> would {{probably}} <b>have</b> {{been shot down}} as spies, without the trouble of capture," [...] said Brant quietly.|$|R

6000|$|... "Do {{you do it}} {{fairly and}} {{squarely}} because you believe that you're a failure, or because you partly feel that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>n't</b> <b>been</b> fairly dealt with?" ...|$|R
60|$|W. Not {{act like}} a traitor, but like one that was once a Christian, {{and would have been}} so still, if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> a Dutchman.|$|R
6000|$|... "No doubt ye think," [...] said Freydissa, [...] "that if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> caught {{sleeping}} ye {{would have}} given the Norsemen some trouble to secure you." ...|$|R
60|$|I hope <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> {{leading a}} double life, {{pretending to be}} wicked and being really good all the time. That would be hypocrisy.|$|E

6000|$|... 'So glad! I hoped you would, {{since you}} are so fond of greys. Besides, it is cooler in this weather. I hope <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> waiting.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Maybe," [...] {{said the}} voice, [...] "but how know I that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> near some case of foul {{sickness}} {{and will not}} bring it here?" ...|$|E
