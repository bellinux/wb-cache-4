500|$|The {{earliest}} recorded use of {{the word}} [...] "cootie" [...] appears in Albert N. Depew's [...] World War I memoir, Gunner Depew (1918): [...] "Of course <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> word 'cooties' means....When you get near the trenches you get a course in the natural history of bugs, lice, rats and every kind of pest that had ever been invented." [...] The word may be derived from Malaysian kutu, a head louse. In North American English, children use the word to refer to a fictitious disease or condition, often infecting members of the opposite sex. Among children, the word [...] effectively serves as a device for enforcing separation of the sexes.|$|E
500|$|Regarding {{the choice}} of the title, Moyer commented, [...] "Usually there's some name or phrase that sort of sums up, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> vibe of the record's about, so this one's Indestructible, and it is an {{aggressive}} record, this record's about kicking ass." [...] Donegan, commenting on the meaning of the title, stated, [...] "We feel that we've become indestructible to be able to survive this long in the business, and continuing a success with it." [...] Draiman concluded, [...] "We have been through a lot. No matter what gets thrown at us, as a band, no matter what happens in the musical environment, we're still here, we're still viable, and still standing." ...|$|E
500|$|Warner Bros. {{requested}} {{in press}} releases that critics {{not discuss the}} film's ending. Richard Schickel of Time magazine disregarded the request and revealed Rusty's innocence in his review. He wrote, [...] "Carolyn's murderer has an excellent motive both for killing her... But {{it is hard to}} accept the possibility that the real perpetrator would leave his escape from the trap entirely to chance." [...] Jay Boyar of the Orlando Sentinel surmised, [...] "It's not that Warner Bros. is actually concerned that reviewers will tip the solution to the murder mystery. It's that the studio wants to further the impression that the movie is full of surprises." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times stated, [...] "Even if you think <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> solution is, the performances are so clever and the screenplay... is so subtle that it could well turn out that your expectations are wrong." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are right, sir," [...] replied Mr. Ogilvy, mysteriously, [...] "the joke {{is on my}} side, and {{the best}} of it is that not one of <b>you</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> joke is!" ...|$|R

500|$|David Goodman comments, {{regarding}} the plot partially following Herbert that [...] "there {{is always a}} bit of trouble pitching a Herbert storyline to the network." [...] Samm Levine had originally been selected to voice Kyle, but the character was recast because, as show producer Seth MacFarlane comments, [...] "it seemed a lot funnier when Peter was beating up a kid if he was younger and more defenseless." [...] A deleted scene had been made which showed Chris asking for money and stating [...] "I spent my last ten bucks on a ham costume," [...] and Peter replying with [...] "it's just sitting there right now, but <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> great thing is, it's just three months until Halloween and I am done." [...] Peter's ancestor shown preparing to wrestle with a kangaroo was described by Seth MacFarlane to be [...] "a very strange gag," [...] which was added after {{the other parts of}} the episode had been created. Quagmire's profanity-laced tirade during the golf game was bleeped out on TV, but uncensored on DVD. The scene of Stewie remembering the time the Griffins had a nymphomaniac from Wisconsin in their attic was edited as FOX objected to the sounds of the woman having an orgasm being shown over a shot of a wide-awake Stewie.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} David Robert Jones is {{a reference}} to English musician David Bowie, who was born with that name. [...] "In Which We Meet Mr. Jones" [...] was the first appearance of the character. When actor Jared Harris was first cast for the part, he was told Jones was [...] "possibly a major, important character", {{as indicated by the}} episode's title. Whether his character would make a reappearance later in the season depended on how well received Jones was by the show's audience, Harris' performance, and if the writers felt they had more to tell about the character. [...] Harris later described Jones in a May 2009 interview, [...] "I think you could sense that there was a great bit of ambiguity about the character which was useful. He's a bad guy that might be on the right side. He just might be fighting for the good guys. Those guys are always great parts because you leave the audience guessing about what side he's really on. He's one of those guys that if he's fighting for the right cause, he's a tremendous ally. But if he's fighting on the wrong cause, he's a formidable opponent. He's an anti-hero who is fighting for the just cause". Harris asserted in a February 2009 interview that he did not sign a recurring contract, meaning that the character was not meant to be permanent. He affirmed this by believing the character's personality rendered Jones incapable of joining the regular cast, [...] "You'd have to keep [...] chained like a dog. You couldn't let him loose. You certainly couldn't let him use his hands. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> f--k he'd do".|$|E
2500|$|Pueblo is {{mentioned}} in the song [...] "Stuart" [...] by the satirical punk rock band Dead Milkmen, {{as the source of}} the pamphlet entitled [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> queers are doing to our soil?".|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] she remarked. [...] "Mr. Burton, I'm {{ashamed of}} you! What does that mean, I wonder? You men!" [...] she went on, with a sigh. [...] "One {{has to be}} so careful. You are such deceivers, <b>you</b> <b>know!</b> <b>What's</b> <b>the</b> attraction?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{curious that}} <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> errand was, unless Miss Graham told you." [...] Mrs. Keith looked sternly at Millicent, who blushed.

2500|$|Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Devil thinks {{when he sees}} men use {{violence}} to propagate the gospel? He sits with folded arms behind the fire of hell, and says with malignant looks and frightful grin: [...] "Ah, how wise these madmen are to play my game! Let them go on; I shall reap the benefit. I delight in it." [...] But {{when he sees the}} Word running and contending alone on the battle-field, then he shudders and shakes for fear.|$|E
2500|$|Playing with a busted lip {{since early}} in the game, Colt McCoy ended up with 256 passing yards and four touchdowns. [...] He also contributed career-best 68 rushing yards, {{including}} the [...] scramble that helped seal the victory. The win may have had added significance for McCoy since he grew up only two hours from Lubbock, attended Tuscola Jim Ned high school, and is dating a Texas Tech student who serves as a recruiter for the Red Raiders football team. [...] Although McCoy has now completed 24 touchdowns (2 shy of the UT single season record) he is known for shunning the limelight, preferring to give credit to his coaches and teammates. Former Texas wide receiver Roy Williams, who attended the game on the sidelines, said of McCoy [...] "And <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> scary thing is? [...] He's not even good yet." ...|$|E

I'll publish this, sir, to the medical world;" [...] and as he shrieked out {{the words of the}} threat, he stood on tiptoes and brandished his eye-glasses up almost into his enemy's face.|$|R
