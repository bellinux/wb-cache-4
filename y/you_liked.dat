It enabled you to put out stuff that <b>you</b> <b>liked</b> without, in those days, having to worry about whether it was going to work commercially. I've never been a good business man.|$|E
500|$|Designer Milton Knight {{recalled}} that [...] "audiences actually wanted a wilder, raunchier Cool World. The premiere audience I saw it with certainly did." [...] The critical {{reaction to the}} film was generally negative. Roger Ebert wrote, [...] "The DJ who was hosting the radio station's free preview of Cool World leaped onto the stage and promised the audience: 'If <b>you</b> <b>liked</b> Roger Rabbit, you'll love Cool World!' He was wrong, but you can't blame him—he hadn't seen the movie. I have, and I will now promise you that if <b>you</b> <b>liked</b> Roger Rabbit, quit while you're ahead." [...] The film was a box-office disappointment. While other film projects followed, Bakshi began to focus more attention on painting.|$|E

Over {{the course of the}} recording sessions, U2 added various overdubs to the song, but producer Brian Eno believed these additions negatively impacted the track. Eno aided the group in editing down the song, and he explained his assistance as such: [...] "I'd go in and say, 'The song has gone, whatever it is <b>you</b> <b>liked</b> about this song is not there anymore. Sometimes, for example, the song would have disappeared under layers of overdubs." ...|$|E

[...] EGM believed that, [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>liked</b> Rogue Squadron, it's a good bet you'll like Naboo even more." [...] GameSpot's Ryan Davis, however, thought that the game remained fun despite the [...] "general lack of innovation over its predecessor" [...] and believed it to be [...] "one of the best EpisodeI titles to hit the market". The Nintendo 64 version received mostly positive reviews and received an aggregate score of 82percent and 84 from GameRankings and Metacritic, respectively.|$|E

500|$|Ironsword: Wizards & Warriors II was {{initially}} reviewed and received positive ratings in the June1989 issue of Electronic Gaming Monthly. Steve Harris {{said that the}} game was very large and expansive, noting that it [...] "is so big, and has so much to offer, most of the competition pales by comparison". Ed Semrad called the game [...] "a worthy sequel that fortunately {{is better than the}} original", similarly noting the game's size as well as difficulty. Donn Nauert appreciated the game's good graphics which complement the adventure theme, but he noted that some of the precise movements that are required in various areas may cause some frustration in gameplay. Jim Allee praised all the aspects of the game, saying [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>liked</b> Wizards & Warriors, you'll love Ironsword". All four reviewers lauded the game's involving gameplay and graphics.|$|E

[...] " [...] was somebody that you couldn't decide if <b>you</b> <b>liked</b> or hated, and I think that Britten's dilemma is something that we're not only sympathetic for, but somehow we want him to win."

He considered its story to be [...] "good" [...] but [...] "nothing great" [...] and its graphics to be [...] "decent"; but he commented that the game was [...] "really all about the gameplay", which he praised as [...] "quite compelling and fun". Benjamin E. Sones of Computer Games Magazine considered the game's story to be [...] "quite good", but he faulted Looking Glass for failing to detail the events of the first game for new players. He wrote that Thief IIs graphics were passable but that its sound design was [...] "phenomenal".

500|$|Entertainment Weeklys Bob Strauss {{offered the}} game effusive praise, writing: [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>liked</b> playing with toy {{soldiers}} as a kid, you'll think you've {{stepped on a}} land mine and gone to heaven". Strauss believed that its cutscenes, voice clips and [...] "nonstop action" [...] served to [...] " [...] the usually stodgy war game genre". After highlighting its multiplayer and citing its installation process as [...] "the coolest [...] I've ever seen", he concluded that the game [...] "makes other war simulations look as flat as Risk." [...] A reviewer for Next Generation called it [...] "a game that any strategy fan has to pick up." [...] While complaining {{at the lack of}} a high-resolution mode, he applauded the gameplay for its combination of simple and intuitive control with deep and complex strategy, and said the full motion video cutscenes add considerably to the game's depth. He also complimented the soundtrack and fast pace. Peter Smith of Computer Games Magazine called Command & Conquer [...] "an adrenaline rush in a box", writing: [...] "Everything about this game shouts quality." [...] Smith lauded the game's music and sound effects, gameplay and story, and even its install program. Smith noted some minor problems, citing issues with the game's artificial intelligence, but finished by saying that [...] "Westwood has really raised the bar with this one." [...] Chris Hudak of GameSpot wrote: [...] "Starting from the load-screens and straight on 'til morning, Command & Conquer is one of the finest, most brilliantly-designed computer games I have ever seen." ...|$|E

For me to do Hellboy 3, it could kill me – in terms of physically demanding, for a guy my age, but it's worth it because anyone who sits and listens to Guillermo's version of how this thing ends is completely seduced.

2500|$|IGN's Tom McNamara {{scored the}} game 8.1 out of 10, writing [...] "Ties That Bind {{is quite a}} solid romp, and a cut above most of the games in the genre that are marred by poor controls, poor balancing, {{annoying}} music, bad voice acting, thin stories, {{and a host of}} other problems that define the vast middle ground. Surreal Software has a very clear and detailed vision of the location and the people and tortured souls that populate it, an intuitive and smooth control scheme, and a dripping, engaging atmosphere of unpredictable nightmare." [...] Like other critics, however, he felt the game didn't build on the original sufficiently; [...] "it doesn't do a whole lot to expand on the theme of the original -- nightmare prison visions come alive, ghosts that kill, and churning violence [...] Still, if <b>you</b> <b>liked</b> the original, you should like Ties That Bind." ...|$|E
