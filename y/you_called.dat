500|$|Chandler and the Experience {{found time}} to record between {{performances}} in Europe. They began on October 23, recording [...] "Hey Joe" [...] at De Lane Lea Studios, with Chandler as producer and Dave Siddle as engineer. The song featured backing vocals by the Breakaways. Soon after the session began, Chandler asked Hendrix to turn his guitar amplifier down, and an argument ensued. Chandler commented: [...] "Jimi threw a tantrum because I wouldn't let him play guitar loud enough... He was playing a Marshall twin stack, {{and it was so}} loud in the studio that we were picking up various rattles and noises." [...] According to Chandler, Hendrix then threatened to leave England, stating: [...] "If I can't play as loud as I want, I might as well go back to New York." [...] Chandler, who had Hendrix's immigration papers and passport in his back pocket, laid the documents on the mixing console and told Hendrix to [...] "piss off". Hendrix laughed and said: [...] "All right, <b>you</b> <b>called</b> my bluff", and they got back to work. Redding wrote in his diary that they completed two songs during the October 23 session, but the second one has never been positively identified. Author Sean Egan speculated that it might have been Howlin' Wolf's [...] "Killing Floor" [...] or Wilson Pickett's [...] "Land of a Thousand Dances". Chandler decided that they should use an Experience original for the B-side of the single, so he encouraged Hendrix to start writing; he composed his first Experience song, [...] "Stone Free", the following day. Chandler, in an effort to minimize studio expenses, purchased rehearsal time at the Aberbach House in London. He abandoned this practice after realizing how quickly the group could learn songs while warming up in the studio. On November 2, 1966, the Experience returned to De Lane Lea to continue work on their first single. During the session, they recorded [...] "Stone Free" [...] and a demo version of [...] "Can You See Me". This marked {{the first time that the}} Experience recorded a song that was eventually included on the original UK release of the album.|$|E

CTU President Helen Kelly commented [...] "the use of this law is unhelpful and is having the effect of making all political groups nervous about how this law is being and could be used." [...] Civil Liberties group Who's Watching <b>You</b> <b>called</b> the raids [...] "a despicable show of force by the coercive arm of the state" [...] and said that [...] "The extensive use of surveillance to allegedly gather information is another telling example of the Government and police force's willingness to disregard the people of Aotearoa." [...] Canterbury University academic and social justice campaigner David Small told bFM that the raids were draconian and probably illegal. Former inspector in charge of the Auckland police criminal intelligence Ross Meurant called the raids [...] "extreme and excessive" [...] and claimed the police were guilty of [...] "self-hype and self-justification." ...|$|E

When I heard you have become famous now, I travelled here to visit you and reminisce our past days, as well as to tour the region. Are you suspecting my intentions when <b>you</b> <b>called</b> me a 'spokesman'?" [...] Zhou Yu said, [...] "I may not be as good as the musicians of ancient times, but I still know how to appreciate a beautiful piece of music." [...] Zhou Yu then invited Jiang Gan to dine with him. After the meal, before he left, Zhou Yu told Jiang Gan, [...] "I've something confidential to attend to, and I need to leave now.

2500|$|On March 9, {{during a}} segment of Mad Money, Cramer admitted, [...] "OK, I'm a tempting target. Plenty of people come in and give their {{criticism}} on this show. But we're dealing with serious issues here; we need solutions, which I offer almost every night. I don't want ad hominem attacks. Take The New York Times columnist Frank Rich and Jon Stewart; I criticize Obama, so both of them seize on the urban legend that I recommended Bear Stearns the week before it collapsed, when I simply told an e-mailer that the deposit in his account at Bear Stearns was safe. 'Your money is safe in Bear Stearns,'" [...] Cramer repeated, referring to his own quote during a March 11, 2008 segment of Mad Money. Moreover, Cramer outlined, [...] "But through a clever sound bite, Stewart, and subsequently Rich—neither of whom have bothered {{to listen to the}} context of the pulled quote—pass off the notion of account safety as an out-and-out buy recommendation. If <b>you</b> <b>called</b> Mad Money and asked me about Citigroup, I would tell you that the common stock might be worthless, but I would never tell you to pull your money out of the bank because I was worried about its solvency. Your money is safe in Citi as I said it was in Bear. The fact that I was right rankles me even more." ...|$|E
