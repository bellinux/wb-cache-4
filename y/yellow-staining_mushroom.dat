[...] Genevier described the Agaricus mushrooms commonly eaten (perhaps sometimes inadvisedly) {{in the region of}} Nantes, and attempted to clarify the distinctions between them. He proposed a detailed reclassification into 5 species, including this new one. Apparently up until that time, these <b>yellow-staining</b> <b>mushrooms</b> were considered to be just varieties of other species which are edible: A. arvensis, A. edulis, and A. silvicola.|$|R
