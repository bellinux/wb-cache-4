5|$|Alligators and {{crocodiles}} {{were first}} farmed {{in the early}} 20th century, but the facilities involved were zoo-like and their main source of income was from tourism.

Farming involves breeding and rearing captive stock on a self-contained basis, whereas ranching means the use of eggs, juveniles, or adults taken each <b>year</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> wild. Commercial organisations must satisfy the criteria of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) by demonstrating that, in the area concerned, they do not adversely impact the wild population.|$|E

The funds were provided by a loan of £13,000 repaid over the next 20years with income from the Judd Foundation (of which The Skinners' Company were trustees), which rapidly increased when the leases on the Sandhills Estate in London were renewed in 1906.

The Festival of the Bands is another annual musical event featuring brass bands from Italy and beyond during the last week of August.
