5|$|After his two Broadway triumphs, Adler {{returned}} to <b>Yiddish</b> theater.|$|E
5|$|Goldfaden {{was both}} a {{theoretician}} and a practitioner of theater. That {{he was in no}} small measure a theoretician – for example, he was interested almost from the start in having set design seriously support the themes of his plays – relates to a key property of <b>Yiddish</b> theater {{at the time of its}} birth: in general, writes Bercovici, theory ran ahead of practice. Much of the Jewish community, Goldfaden included, were already familiar with contemporary theater in other languages. The initial itinerary of Goldfaden's company – Iaşi, Botoşani, Galaţi, Brăila, Bucharest – could as easily have been the itinerary of a Romanian-language troupe. <b>Yiddish</b> theater may have been seen from the outset as an expression of a Jewish national character, but the theatrical values of Goldfaden's company were in many ways those of a good Romanian theater of the time. Also, <b>Yiddish</b> was a German dialect which became a well-known language even among non-Jews in Moldavia (and Transylvania), an important language of commerce; the fact that one of the first to write about <b>Yiddish</b> theater was Romania's national poet, Mihai Eminescu, is testimony that interest in <b>Yiddish</b> theater went beyond the Jewish community.|$|E
5|$|In 1904 Adler had the Grand Theater {{built in}} {{what was to be}} the <b>Yiddish</b> Theater District at the corner of Bowery and Canal Street, the first {{purpose-built}} <b>Yiddish</b> theater in New York. His wife Sara had branched out to do her own plays at the Novelty Theater in Brooklyn, and the family had taken up residence in a four-story brownstone, with an elevator, in the East Seventies. (They would later move one more time, to Riverside Drive.) Around this time Lincoln Steffens wrote a piece saying that <b>Yiddish</b> theater in New York had eclipsed English-language theater in quality.|$|E
5|$|Ion Ghica was a {{valuable}} ally for <b>Yiddish</b> theater in Bucharest. On several occasions he expressed his favorable {{view of the}} quality of acting, and even more of the technical aspects of the <b>Yiddish</b> theater. In 1881, he obtained for the National Theater the costumes that had been used for a <b>Yiddish</b> pageant on the coronation of King Solomon, which had been timed in tribute to the actual coronation of Carol I of Romania.|$|E
5|$|Jacob Pavlovich Adler (born Yankev P. Adler; February 12, 1855 – April 1, 1926) was a Jewish {{actor and}} star of <b>Yiddish</b> theater, first in Odessa, {{and later in}} London and in New York City's <b>Yiddish</b> Theater District.|$|E
5|$|The {{two most}} popular Hannukah foods are potato pancakes, levivot, also known by the <b>Yiddish</b> latkes; and jelly doughnuts, known as sufganiyot in Hebrew, pontshkes (in <b>Yiddish)</b> or bimuelos (in Ladino), as these are deep-fried in oil. Hannukah pancakes are made {{from a variety of}} ingredients, from the {{traditional}} potato or cheese, to more modern innovations, among them corn, spinach, zucchini and sweet potato.|$|E
5|$|There {{were also}} many <b>Yiddish</b> theatres, {{particularly}} around Whitechapel. These developed into professional companies, after {{the arrival of}} Jacob Adler in 1884 {{and the formation of}} his 'Russian Jewish Operatic Company' that first performed in Beaumont Hall, Stepney, and then found homes both in the Prescott Street Club, Stepney, and in Princelet Street in Spitalfields. The Pavilion became an exclusively <b>Yiddish</b> theatre in 1906, finally closing in 1936 and being demolished in 1960. Other important Jewish theatres were Feinmans, The Jewish National Theatre and the Grand Palais. Performances were in <b>Yiddish,</b> and predominantly melodrama. These declined, as audience and actors left for New York and the more prosperous parts of London.|$|E
5|$|At this time, <b>Yiddish</b> {{theater in}} London meant amateur clubs. The arrival of {{professional}} <b>Yiddish</b> actors from Russia worked great changes, bringing <b>Yiddish</b> theater in London {{to a new}} level and allowing a modest professionalism, though never at much more than a poverty wage. Adler's memoir acknowledges many people who helped him out in various ways. Eventually, with the aid in particular of Sonya's relative Herman Fiedler—a playwright, orchestra leader, and stage manager—the Adlers and the Grodners were able to take over the Prescott Street Club. There they presented generally serious theater to audiences of about 150. Fiedler adapted The Odessa Beggar from Felix Pyat's The Ragpicker of Paris, a tragicomic play written {{on the eve of the}} Revolutions of 1848. Adler starred in it, in a role he would continue to play throughout his career.|$|E
5|$|Goldfaden left Romania in 1896; soon Juvilier's was {{the only}} active <b>Yiddish</b> theater troupe in the country, and foreign troupes had almost entirely ceased coming to the country. Although Lateiner, Horowitz, and Shumer kept writing, and {{occasionally}} managed {{to put on a}} play, {{it was not a good}} time for <b>Yiddish</b> theater – or any theater – in Romania, and would only become worse as the economy continued to decline.|$|E
5|$|Goldfaden was {{churning}} out a repertoire – new songs, new plays, and translations of plays from Romanian, French, and other languages (in {{the first two}} years, he wrote 22 plays, and would eventually write about 40) – {{and while he was}} not always able to retain the players in his company once they became stars in their own right, he continued for many years to recruit first-rate talent, and his company became a de facto training ground for <b>Yiddish</b> theater. By the end of the year, others were writing <b>Yiddish</b> plays as well, such as Moses Horowitz with Der tiranisher bankir (The Tyrannical Banker), or Grodner with Curve un ganev (Prostitute and Thief), and <b>Yiddish</b> theater had become big theater, with elaborate sets, duelling choruses, and extras to fill out crowd scenes.|$|E
5|$|Having already famously played Shylock in Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice on the <b>Yiddish</b> {{stage at}} the People's Theater, he played the role again in a 1903 Broadway production, {{directed}} by Arthur Hopkins. In this production, Adler spoke his lines in <b>Yiddish</b> {{while the rest of}} the cast spoke in English. The New York Times review of Adler's performance was not favorable: in particular his naturalistic acting style was not what audiences of the period expected in a production of Shakespeare. Some other reviews (such as that in Theater magazine) were friendlier; in any event the same production was revived two years later.|$|E
5|$|The congregation's first {{president}} was Max Shuwolf, a Hungarian Jew who had first immigrated to Galveston, Texas, then ran a small dry goods store in Montgomery. He donated two rooms in his house, {{where the new}} congregation held its first services. The congregation's first constitution was written in <b>Yiddish.</b> Services were held in Hebrew and <b>Yiddish,</b> men and women sat separately, and men covered their heads, as mandated by the constitution.|$|E
5|$|This {{golden age}} {{was not to}} last. The years 1905–1908 saw half a million new Jewish {{immigrants}} to New York, and once again the largest audience for <b>Yiddish</b> theater was for lighter fare. Adler hung on, but the Thomashefskys were making a fortune at the Thalia; plays with titles like Minke the Servant Girl were far outdrawing fare like Gordin's Dementia Americana (1909). It would be 1911 before Adler scored another major success, this time with Tolstoy's The Living Corpse (also known as Redemption), translated into <b>Yiddish</b> by Leon Kobrin.|$|E
5|$|Adler was {{not content}} to {{continue}} long in this mode, and sought a playwright who could create pieces that would appeal to the Jewish public, while still providing a type of theater he could be proud to perform. He recruited Jacob Gordin, already a well-respected novelist and intellectual, recently arrived in New York and eking out {{a living as a}} journalist at the Arbeiter Zeitung, precursor to The Forward. Gordin's first two plays, Siberia and Two Worlds were commercial failures—so much so that Mogulesko and Kessler quit the company—but The <b>Yiddish</b> King Lear, starring Adler and his new wife Sara was such a success that the play eventually transferred to Finkel's larger National Theater. This play (based only very loosely on Shakespeare) played well with the popular audience, but also with Jewish intellectuals who until this time had largely ignored <b>Yiddish</b> Theater, ending for a time the commercial dominance of operettas such as those of Horowitz and Joseph Lateiner. The next year, Gordin's The Wild Man solidified this change in the direction of <b>Yiddish</b> theater, which was entering what is retrospectively seen as its first period of greatness.|$|E
5|$|Born in the Poltava Governorate of the Russian Empire (present-day Ukraine), she emigrated {{with her}} family to the United States in the early 20th century. Nevelson learned English at school, as she spoke <b>Yiddish</b> at home.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert and Sullivan operas {{have been}} {{translated}} into many languages, including Portuguese, <b>Yiddish,</b> Hebrew, Swedish, Dutch, Danish, Estonian, Hungarian, Russian, Japanese, French, Italian, Spanish (reportedly including a version of Pinafore transformed into zarzuela style), Catalan and others.|$|E
5|$|His {{father was}} by all {{accounts}} a cold and jealous man. Both parents were Jewish, but decided against raising the boys as Jews. Reich and his brother, Robert, were brought up to speak only German, were punished for using <b>Yiddish</b> expressions and forbidden from playing with the local Yiddish-speaking children.|$|E
5|$|In Rugrats, {{the root}} of Jewish themes stem from Boris and Minka Kropotkin, the Russian Jewish {{maternal}} grandparents of infant Tommy Pickles. Boris and Minka follow traditional Jewish practices and speak in heavy <b>Yiddish</b> accents. Tommy and the Pickles family therefore partake in several Jewish activities throughout the series, particularly through holidays.|$|E
5|$|One of Adler's {{most famous}} roles {{from this period}} was as the villain Franz Moore in Herman Fiedler's {{adaptation}} of Schiller's The Robbers, which introduced Schiller into <b>Yiddish</b> theater. On at least one occasion in 1886, he played both Franz Moore and the play's hero, Franz's brother Karl Moore: in the play they never meet.|$|E
5|$|A call {{like this}} might be a bit ambiguous, but it was unsettling to those who were {{on the side of the}} status quo. <b>Yiddish</b> theater was banned in Russia {{starting}} September 14, 1883, as part of the anti-Jewish reaction following the assassination of Czar Alexander II. Goldfaden and his troupe were left adrift in Saint Petersburg. They headed various directions, some to England, some to New York City, some to Poland, some to Romania.|$|E
5|$|Adler went on {{the road}} with Boris Thomashefsky, who at the time was {{pioneering}} the touring circuit for <b>Yiddish</b> theater in America. They played in Philadelphia and Chicago, where word arrived of an opportunity to take over Poole's, Heine having moved on to the Thalia. Adler returned to New York, where he managed also to win Mogulesko and Kessler away from Heine.|$|E
5|$|Adler {{wrote in}} his memoir that the passion of his future wife Sonya Oberlander (and of her family) for theater, and their vision of what <b>Yiddish</b> theater could become, kept him in the {{profession}} despite his uncle's view. When she was cast by Rosenberg opposite Jacob Spivakovsky {{in the title role}} of Abraham Goldfaden's darkly comic operetta Breindele Cossack, she pulled strings so that the role of Guberman would be reassigned to Adler.|$|E
5|$|Agudath Israel was {{established}} as an Orthodox synagogue in 1902 by <b>Yiddish</b> speaking Ashkenazi Jews, recent Eastern European immigrants who rejected the Reform practices of Montgomery's established Congregation Kahl Montgomery/Temple Beth Or. After renting quarters {{for a number}} of years, the congregation purchased its first permanent building on Monroe Street in 1914, and constructed a new building at McDonough and High Street in 1928.|$|E
5|$|From 1947 to 1950 {{he studied}} the Talmud, {{philosophy}} and literature at the Sorbonne, where he {{was influenced by the}} existentialists, attending lectures by Jean-Paul Sartre and Martin Buber. He also taught Hebrew, and worked as a translator for the <b>Yiddish</b> weekly Zion in Kamf. In 1948, when he was 19, he was sent to Israel as a war correspondent by the French newspaper L'arche, and after the Sorbonne became chief foreign correspondent of the Tel Aviv newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth.|$|E
5|$|Nonetheless, Iacob Ber Ghimpel, {{who owned}} a <b>Yiddish</b> theater there, {{was glad to have}} a figure of Goldfaden's stature. Goldfaden {{completed}} the play he'd started in Paris, Rabi Yoselman, oder Die Gzerot fun Alsas ("Rabbi Yoselman, or The Alsatian Decree"), in five acts and 23 scenes, based on the life of Josel of Rosheim. At this time he also wrote an operetta Rothschild and a semi-autobiographical play called Mashiach Tzeiten (Messiah Times) that gave a less-than-optimistic view of America.|$|E
5|$|The City of London police {{informed}} the Metropolitan force, as their protocol demanded, and both services issued revolvers to the detectives {{involved in the}} search. The subsequent investigation was challenging for the police because of the cultural differences between the British police and the largely foreign residents of the area covered by the search. The police {{did not have any}} Russian, Latvian or <b>Yiddish</b> speakers on the force.|$|E
5|$|The Pavilion Theatre {{opened on}} Nos.191–193Whitechapel Road, {{the site of}} a former clothes factory, in 1828. It was the first major theatre to open in the East End of London. The {{original}} building was destroyed in a fire in 1856, and was replaced by a larger theatre that could accommodate over 1,000 people, becoming the centre of <b>Yiddish</b> theatre in Britain. It closed in 1934.|$|E
5|$|The {{largest and}} oldest Jewish {{cemetery}} in Lithuania, first mentioned in 1592, was also located in Žvejai. It {{was known in}} the local Jewish community as Shnipishok. The <b>Yiddish</b> placename later became associated with the whole borough of Šnipiškės, now bordering Žirmūnai on the west. Although the cemetery was officially closed in 1830 and was subject to gradual deterioration, there were further interments. Vilna Gaon, {{as well as other}} famous Vilnian Jews, were interred in the cemetery.|$|E
5|$|Tzara {{was born}} in Moinești, Bacău County, in the {{historical}} region of Western Moldavia. His parents were Jewish Romanians who reportedly spoke <b>Yiddish</b> as their first language; his father Filip and grandfather Ilie were entrepreneurs in the forestry business. Tzara's mother was Emilia Rosenstock, née Zibalis. Owing to the Romanian Kingdom's discrimination laws, the Rosenstocks were not emancipated, and thus Tzara was not a full citizen of the country until after 1918.|$|E
5|$|Bellman {{has been}} {{translated}} into at least 20 languages, including English, most notably by Paul Britten Austin, and into German, for example by Hannes Wader. German Communist leader Karl Liebknecht liked Bellman's songs and translated some into German. Hans Christian Andersen {{was one of the}} first to translate Bellman into Danish. Bellman's songs have been translated and recorded in Icelandic (by Bubbi), Italian, French, Finnish (for instance by Vesa-Matti Loiri), Russian, Chuvash and <b>Yiddish.</b> English interpretations have been recorded by William Clauson, Martin Best, Freddie Langrind made some Norwegian translations in 2008. Sven-Bertil Taube, Roger Hinchliffe and Martin Bagge. Schoolchildren two hundred years on still learn some of his songs, and several including Gubben Noak and Fjäriln vingad are known by heart by many Swedes.|$|E
5|$|By November 1885, Adler had a {{theatrical}} club of his own, the Princes Street Club, No. 3 Princes Street (now Princelet Street, E1), purpose-built, financed by a butcher named David Smith. It seated 300; playing every night except Friday, he was earning about £3 s.10 a week, {{but with a}} fame well {{out of proportion to}} the meagre money. Many of the most prominent figures in <b>Yiddish</b> theater, including Sigmund Mogulesko, David Kessler, Abba and Clara Shoengold, and Sara Heine (the future Sara Adler), gave guest performances when they passed through London.|$|E
5|$|East Midwood was {{organized}} in 1924 by Jacob R. Schwartz, a dentist who {{was concerned that}} his two sons had no nearby Hebrew school which they could attend. From the start his intention had been to create a Conservative synagogue: Conservative Judaism {{was seen as a}} compromise between Orthodox and Reform, providing the familiar (and lengthy) Hebrew services of Orthodox Judaism, but, like Reform, adding some English prayers. East Midwood differed from earlier Ashkenazi synagogues in New York, as services were to be conducted in Hebrew and English only (not Hebrew and <b>Yiddish),</b> and the members were to come from immigrants from all over Europe, not just one city or region.|$|E
5|$|Joseph {{was also}} {{unable to stop}} those who came to hear him speak from desecrating the Sabbath, and his <b>Yiddish</b> sermons had {{no impact on the}} younger generation. In addition, he had to contend with a number of obstacles: he had no {{administrative}} experience or training, local Orthodox rabbis (particularly Joshua Seigel) and Jews outside his congregation did not accept his authority, and non-Orthodox Jews and groups criticized him. These problems were exacerbated by a stroke suffered in 1895, which partially incapacitated him, followed by a relapse in 1900 which left him bedridden.|$|E
5|$|Kafka's parents {{probably}} spoke a German {{influenced by}} <b>Yiddish</b> that was sometimes pejoratively called Mauscheldeutsch, but, as the German language {{was considered the}} vehicle of social mobility, they probably encouraged their children to speak High German. Hermann and Julie had six children, of whom Franz was the eldest. Franz's two brothers, Georg and Heinrich, died in infancy before Franz was seven; his three sisters were Gabriele ("Ellie") (1889–1944), Valerie ("Valli") (1890–1942) and Ottilie ("Ottla") (1892–1943). They all died during the Holocaust of World War II. Valli was deported to the Łódź Ghetto in Poland in 1942, {{but that is the}} last documentation of her. Ottilie was his favorite sister.|$|E
5|$|Nevelson's first {{experience}} of art {{was at the}} age of nine at the Rockland Public Library, where she saw a plaster cast of Joan of Arc. Shortly thereafter she decided to study art, taking drawing in high school, where she also served as basketball captain. She painted watercolor interiors, in which furniture appeared molecular in structure, rather like her later professional work. Female figures made frequent appearances. In school, she practiced her English, her second language, as <b>Yiddish</b> was spoken at home. Unhappy with her family's economic status, language differences, the religious discrimination of the community, and her school, Nevelson set her sights on moving to high school in New York.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} decades, Adler would play in (or, in some cases, merely produce) {{numerous}} plays by Gordin, but also classics by Shakespeare, Schiller, Lessing; Eugène Scribe's La Juive; dramatizations of George du Maurier's Trilby and Alexandre Dumas, fils' Camille; and {{the works of}} modern playwrights such as Gorky, Ibsen, Shaw, Strindberg, Gerhart Hauptmann, Victor Hugo, Victorien Sardou, and Leonid Andreyev. Frequently {{the works of the}} great contemporary playwrights—even Shaw, who was writing in English—would be staged in New York in <b>Yiddish</b> years, even decades, before they were ever staged there in English.|$|E
