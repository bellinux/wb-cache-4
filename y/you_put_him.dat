500|$|Recording {{sessions}} for the group's self-titled debut took place from September to December 1991. The album {{was released on}} March 31, 1992, on compact disc, vinyl, and audio cassette. Ice-T states that Body Count was intentionally different from his solo hip hop albums in that [...] "An Ice T album has intelligence, and at times it has ignorance. Sometimes it has anger, sometimes it has questions. But Body Count was intended to reflect straight anger. It {{was supposed to be}} the voice of the angry brother, without answers. [...] If you took a kid and <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> in jail with a microphone and asked him how he feels, you'd get Body Count: 'Fuck that. Fuck school. Fuck the police.' You wouldn't get intelligence or compassion. You'd get raw anger." [...] From the album, [...] "There Goes The Neighborhood" [...] was released as a single, while [...] "Body Count's in the House" [...] was featured in the film Universal Soldier.|$|E
500|$|A {{major concern}} with the second act was the {{effectiveness}} of the characters He and She (later called by Rodgers [...] "Mr. and Mrs. God"), before whom Billy appeared after his death. Mr. and Mrs. God were depicted as a New England minister and his wife, seen in their parlor. The couple was still part of the show at the Boston opening. Rodgers said to Hammerstein, [...] "We've got to get God out of that parlor". When Hammerstein inquired where he should put the deity, Rodgers replied, [...] "I don't care where <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>Him.</b> Put Him on a ladder for all I care, only get Him out of that parlor!" [...] Hammerstein duly put Mr. God (renamed the Starkeeper) atop a ladder, and Mrs. God was removed from the show. Rodgers biographer Meryle Secrest terms this change a mistake, leading to a more fantastic afterlife, which was later criticized by The New Republic as [...] "a Rotarian atmosphere congenial to audiences who seek not reality but escape from reality, not truth but escape from truth".|$|E
500|$|Olajuwon has {{referred}} to basketball as a science, and described his signature move in vivid detail: [...] "When the point guard throws me the ball, I jump to get the ball. But this jump is the set-up for the second move, the baseline move. I call it the 'touch landing.' The defender is {{waiting for me to}} come down because I jumped but I’m gone before I land. Defenders say 'Wow, he's quick,' but they don’t know that where I’m going is predetermined. He's basing it on quickness, but the jump is to set him up. Before I come down, I make my move. When you jump, you turn as you land. Boom! The defender can’t react because he's waiting for you to come down to defend you. Now, the first time when you showed that quickness, he has to react to that quickness, so you can fake baseline and go the other way with your jump hook. All {{this is part of the}} Dream Shake. The Dream Shake is you dribble and then you jump; now you don’t have a pivot foot. When I dribble I move it so when I come here, I jump. By jumping, I don’t have a pivot foot now. I dribble so now I can use either foot. I can go this way or this way. So he's frozen, he doesn’t know which way I’m going to go. That is the shake. <b>You</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> in the mix and you jump stop and now you have choice of pivot foot. He doesn’t know where you’re gonna turn and when." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>You</b> must <b>put</b> <b>him</b> {{in a book}} or a play right away. You are {{the only}} man capable of doing it. You might die at any moment, and your very {{greatest}} work would be lost to the world. I could write Orion's simple biography, and make it effective, too, by merely stating the bald facts--and this I will do if he dies before I do; but <b>you</b> must <b>put</b> <b>him</b> into romance. This was the understanding you and I had the day I sailed.|$|R
6000|$|... "And," [...] {{continued}} Incarnacion, throwing {{down the}} match and putting {{his foot on}} it, [...] "if this boaster, this turkey-cock, says she did, <b>you</b> could <b>put</b> <b>him</b> out like that?" ...|$|R
2500|$|On November 9, 2015, Fedorov was {{inducted}} into the Hockey Hall of Fame. During the weekend festivities, many of his past coaches and teammates commented on Sergei's career. Scotty Bowman was speaking about having to put Sergei on defence when injuries were piling up: [...] "He was the best defenseman in the league for a six-week period". Former teammate Brendan Shanahan said: [...] "I'm convinced if Sergei played defense, he could have won a Norris Trophy...He was so talented, so strong." [...] Wayne Gretzky spoke on their friendship: [...] "He was one of my closer friends that played on another team. Actually, the year he won the Hart Trophy I think it was, he lived with us for six weeks in the offseason and we trained together and {{spent a lot of time}} together". Alex Oveckhin said he was [...] "the best player I've ever played with. He was unbelievable. <b>You</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> in every position and he was going to be the best. His hockey sense was unbelievable. His shot and vision, unbelievable.|$|E
6000|$|... "That there Roger Cly, master," [...] said Mr. Cruncher, with a taciturn and iron-bound visage. [...] "So <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> in his coffin?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My horses {{never were}} in harness," [...] added the lady. [...] "Bullfinch would kick the {{carriage}} to pieces, if <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> in the traces." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You could, my boy. But I wouldn't advise it. Who {{would want}} a stuffed wolf around anyhow? Of course, <b>you</b> might <b>put</b> <b>him</b> in some club-house or furrier's window--or {{something}} like that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then," [...] said Ethel, as {{she heard}} her affirmative, [...] "I don't think it is for his dignity, for <b>you</b> to <b>put</b> <b>him</b> into Parliament to please you and then take him out to please you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's right. Live at his expense {{as much as}} you can, {{and take}} warning by his foolish example. That's the use of such a friend. The only use <b>you</b> can <b>put</b> <b>him</b> to," [...] says the venerable sage.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dat's true--only fellows don't like be made feel it," [...] {{said the}} German, [...] "Nokes, {{he was made}} feel it when <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> over de gate." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why don't <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> into a chair?" [...] growled Mat, looking round reproachfully {{from the}} frying-pan, as Valentine {{recovered}} his erect position again with young Thorpe's assistance.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you greatly," [...] Harry said. [...] "I do {{not know}} how I should have managed without your aid. If <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> down here I will try and bring him round." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Well, then, he {{must take}} his {{chance in the}} {{seclusion}} of that conservatory sort of place where <b>you</b> have <b>put</b> <b>him.</b> I’ll try to find somebody we can trust to look after him. Meantime, I will leave the case to you.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Which? There is only one, isn’t there?” {{said the}} Minister; “the ‘Cousin Teresa’ man, of course. I think every {{one would be}} pleased if we knighted <b>him.</b> Yes, <b>you</b> can <b>put</b> <b>him</b> down {{on the list of}} certainties—under the letter L.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{feel very}} unhappy about her," [...] Olive resumed. I know that she's anxious and troubled all the time. Can't you do something, Ben? Have {{a talk with}} that disgusting thing, and see if <b>you</b> can't <b>put</b> <b>him</b> {{straight}} again, somehow?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'There,' said Squeers, when he {{had quite}} done; 'rub away {{as hard as you}} like, you won't rub that off in a hurry. Oh! you won't hold that noise, won't <b>you?</b> <b>Put</b> <b>him</b> out, Smike.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't put it away; {{let me look}} again. That {{man with}} the rope round his neck--I saw him--I saw you come {{to him in the}} Duomo. What was it that made <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> into a picture with Tito?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Fuller {{with some}} dryness, [...] "that's the best plan, but <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> {{on the right}} track and kept him there; I guess I know my son. Has he made trouble for you in other ways?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Neither of {{them would}} carry him a mile. He wants about as good an animal as <b>you</b> can <b>put</b> <b>him</b> upon. I don't know what I'm to do. It's all very well for Laura {{to say that he}} must be mounted." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It seems," [...] said Ellen, {{with much}} regret and commiseration, [...] "that {{all this was}} from poor little Armine using such {{shocking}} language that Rob, as a senior boy, <b>you</b> know, <b>put</b> <b>him</b> under the pump at last {{to put a stop}} to it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Now if <b>you</b> be ready, <b>put</b> <b>him</b> all against Daniel, {{with their}} before-feet upon the same line, and I give the signal'--then he added: 'One, two three--advance!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... ('Does he not? Another act of coercion! I suppose <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> up to [...] this, madam, as a {{pleasing}} course of discipline. You {{think you have}} [...] the whip-hand of me, do you? Pooh! See if he'll stay at Oxford!') ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It isn't {{possible}} that <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> off!" [...] his wife reproached him, {{when he told}} what had passed between him and Breckon. [...] "Oh, you couldn't have let him think that we didn't want him for her! Surely you didn't!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course it}} has," [...] said his son, curtly. [...] "If you didn't want Captain Nugent aboard with you why didn't <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> ashore? It wouldn't have delayed you long. Think of the worry and anxiety you've caused poor Mrs. Kingdom." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then it's hard to {{see your}} object for playing the crook with Stormont, though I don't suppose he'd have done the square thing if <b>you</b> had <b>put</b> <b>him</b> on the right track," [...] Scott remarked. [...] "However, that's not our business. You'll find room and some {{blankets}} in the bunk-house." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Matthew, he hasn't," [...] {{she whispered}} back, [...] "and I think his {{lying to you}} so is almost the worst thing he's done. The next time <b>you</b> may <b>put</b> <b>him</b> with the coon. Only, the coon's too good for him. But I reckon Jim Redfield will look out for him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But {{about the}} respectable {{business}} first,' said my aunt. 'If {{he had been}} your own boy, <b>you</b> would have <b>put</b> <b>him</b> to it, just the same, I suppose?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Madam" [...] {{says the}} Major rising [...] "Jemmy Jackman is {{becoming}} an older file than I was aware of, and <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> to shame. You are thoroughly right Madam. You are simply and undeniably right.--And if you'll excuse me, I'll take a walk." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, in course? But {{they are}} such fools, Father Bernard. They does think theyselves such grand folks. Now don't they? I'd give a dandy of punch all round {{to the company}} just to hear <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> down once; I would. But he isn't {{upsetting}} at all, then?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{suppose you}} {{thought he was}} a lily of the valley, and so <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> in an {{appropriate}} pot, and tended him according. You made up your mind he was a lily of the valley and it was no good his being a cow-parsnip. You wouldn't have it." ...|$|E
60|$|THE BISHOP. <b>You</b> {{might have}} <b>put</b> <b>him</b> in his coffin that way, Mrs Collins. And I {{should have been}} very sorry; because we are all fond of Sinjon.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] Garnet responded good-humoredly, [...] "it's {{a pretty}} tough country up yonder and I suppose the lad's of some service. You're saving us a pile of money in experts' fees and I don't see why <b>you</b> shouldn't <b>put</b> <b>him</b> on the company's payroll. I {{mentioned}} the thing to Walthew; he was agreeable." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2010 Gazey {{explained}} his character's laid back attitude {{to whom he}} spends time with stating, [...] "It's great that he bobs {{in and out of}} situations - <b>you</b> can <b>put</b> <b>him</b> anywhere and he's unfazed by anyone or anything. <b>You</b> can <b>put</b> <b>him</b> with the oldies like Betty, then you throw him with the young ones and he just fits." [...] Going on to talk of how his then, impending storyline involving a new love interest would impact on his unfazed attitude he said: [...] "It's time to see him out of his depth. That's probably where the love interest will help. He's relatively new to the relationship scene - I don't think he's ever had anything like that before. To see him not feel as comfortable as he is usually - to faze the unfazed." ...|$|R
