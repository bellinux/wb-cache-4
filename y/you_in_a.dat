No living person possesses a tithe of his information respecting the Hudson's Bay countries...

He can create a wilderness and people it with warring savages, or climb the Rocky Mountains with <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> snow-storm, so clearly and palpably, that only shut your eyes and you hear the crack of the rifle, or feel the snow-flakes melt on your cheeks as he talks.|$|E

25|$|In October 2013, Mim Museum, {{a private}} mineral museum, {{opened its doors}} to the public. It has on display some 1600 {{minerals}} from more than 60 countries. mim museum's collection {{is considered to be}} one of the world's paramount private collection for the variety and quality of its minerals. A didactic circuit, accompanied by screens showing films and scientific applications of mineralogy, will reveal a world of unsuspected marvels—priceless both from an aesthetic and scientific point of view. Mimodactylus libanensis “mimo”, the fossil of a pterodactyl is featured in a special wing. This one-of-a-kind complete specimen in the Middle-East was found in Lebanon. It is promoted by means of state-of-the-art modern techniques: a hologram, an auto-stereoscopic movie, a full-scale reconstitution and a game “fly with mimo” – an entertainment that delights children and adults. Moreover, mim hosts a thematic exhibition of 200 marine fossils. “Fish’n’Stone” was organized with the collaboration of Mémoire du Temps. Known throughout the world, those fossils were quarried in the Lebanese mountains. The history of the fossil formation is shown through an animation that submerses you in the marine life – a time capsule that takes <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> journey to some 100 million of years ago.|$|E

500|$|One of my very {{greatest}} fears as a {{child was}} being ridiculed in public. And there it was coming true. As a television presenter, I'd been respected. People {{come up to you}} in the street and shake your hand and talk to <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> respectful way. And suddenly, overnight, this was transformed into [...] "Icke's a nutter."

500|$|In practice, Fellini {{shot his}} films while playing taped music because, as he {{explained}} in a 1972 interview, [...] "it puts <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> strange dimension in which your fantasy stimulates you". For La Strada, Fellini used a variation by Arcangelo Corelli {{that he planned to}} use on the sound track. Rota, unhappy with that plan, wrote an original motif (with echoes of the [...] "Larghetto" [...] from Dvořák's Opus 22 Serenade for Strings in E major [...] ) with rhythmic lines matched to Corelli's piece that synchronize with Gelsomina's movements with the trumpet and Il Matto's with the violin.|$|E

500|$|The {{track is}} built on a {{recreation}} of electronic musician Aphex Twin's piano composition [...] "Avril 14th". The song begins with a minute long introduction sung by Legend. [...] "Blame Game" [...] has a lush, cello-driven production with predominant piano. After Legend's introduction, West raps his verses in a highly melodic manner, almost singing his lines. West's forceful delivery expresses hurt and contempt. The song's soulful sound juxtaposes West's angry lyrics: [...] "been {{a long time since}} I spoke to <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> bathroom, ripping you up, fuckin' and chokin' you". He subsequently raps less antagonistically and repeatedly confesses [...] "I can't love you this much".|$|E

[...] Paul Tatara of CNN called The Sweet Hereafter [...] "devastating" [...] and said Ian Holm gives [...] "the performance of his hugely impressive career." [...] David Denby of New York mazine said that the film had [...] "Ian Holm's greatest role in the movies," [...] and that the cast are [...] "all excellent."

500|$|While {{speaking}} with the media during his campaign, Amondson voiced his anti-alcohol message and attempted to address concerns that prohibition increases crime. In an AP interview, he explained that during Prohibition, [...] "the budget was balanced, prisons were emptied, mental institutions emptied and cirrhosis of the liver declined." [...] He concluded, [...] "I'd rather have 100 Al Capones in every city than alcohol sold in every grocery store." [...] Amondson made an appearance on The Daily Show with comedian Jon Stewart. He spoke with correspondent Ed Helms who joked with the candidate. During the segment, Amondson remarked, [...] "alcohol cuts the supply of oxygen to the brain and puts <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> kind of retarded state." [...] A short clip followed that showed Amondson in his Grim Reaper attire. Earl Dodge also appeared on the show in a separate interview with Helms.|$|E

500|$|Abbott is the {{inventor}} of a style of maze called logic mazes. A logic maze has a set of rules, ranging from the basic (such as [...] "you cannot make left turns") to the extremely complicated. These mazes are also called [...] "Multi-State mazes". [...] The reason for this name is that sometimes you can return to a position you were in before, but be traveling in a different direction. That change in direction can put <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> different state and open up different choices for you. One example, from the book SuperMazes, would be a rolling-die maze. Where you can move from a particular square depends on what number is facing up on the die. If you return to that same square, the die {{may be in a}} different state, with a different number on top. Thus, you would have different options than the first time.|$|E
500|$|During {{the run of}} The Mikado, Bond met Lewis Ransome, a young civil {{engineer}} from a wealthy Quaker family. [...] He {{had just returned from}} America, and the two compared travel experiences. Ransome admitted to Bond that, after watching The Mikado, he had mentioned to his sister that he [...] "liked the little one with the big sash best. So next day when she saw a photograph of <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> shop window she went in and bought it. She gave it to me and I have it now." [...] Thus, despite Bond's aversion to romance, began a long friendship that led, twelve years later, to Bond's second marriage. Ransome, several years younger than Bond, proposed marriage on many occasions {{over the course of the}} relationship, but Bond told him that she would not marry while she continued on the stage. Over the years, the two spent many of Bond's days off (Sundays) relaxing together in the country.|$|E
500|$|The song's {{lyrics are}} {{constructed}} in the verse-pre-chorus-chorus form. It begins with guitar strumming, and Beyoncé sings the hook-intro, [...] "To the left, to the left: everything you own in a box to the left". In bar seven, she sings the first verse, arguing with her boyfriend about the indifference of their relationship, and tells him to walk away. The pre-chorus and chorus follow, [...] "You must not know 'bout me...I can have another you by tomorrow / I could have another <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> minute...Don't you ever for a second get to thinking / You're irreplaceable". In the second verse, Beyoncé recollects the moment she discovered her boyfriend's infidelity. The same pattern leads to the second chorus. Towards the end, Beyoncé sings the bridge, where she tells her lover, [...] "Replacing you is so easy". The song closes with an ad-libbed chorus. The Boston Globe noted that Beyoncé sings some parts {{of it in a}} higher register [...] "that complements the lyrics' wounded sensibility".|$|E

500|$|In 2006, {{he played}} Mark Thatcher in Coup!, a dramatisation of the {{attempted}} coup in Equatorial Guinea. He also starred as Adrien opposite Nicholas Tennant in the UK premiére of Members Only at the Trafalgar Studios. He accepted the {{part because it}} was [...] "funny, plausible, plausibly absurd and cruel" [...] and he liked {{that it was a}} translation from an original French play. He enjoyed working on it, telling What's on Stage: [...] "Nick is a really good actor and really good to work with in that you can have completely frank discussions about tiny issues and it's totally ego-free. We're all just discussing the point and not playing games with each other. It does make the working practice easier. If there's only two of <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> play, you are equally responsible – there's nobody else to blame if it goes wrong. So its a greater risk and there's no hiding". At the end of the year, he appeared opposite Richard Wilson in Whipping it Up, a play about whips in a fictional David Cameron government. To research his role, he watched more Commons debates.|$|E
500|$|Sir Lucious Left Foot was {{recorded}} {{over a period}} of three years, beginning on Martin Luther King, Jr. Day in 2007. Big Boi has said that he [...] "always start working on albums on Martin Luther King Day. It's a good luck charm". The album was primarily recorded at Stankonia Recording Studio in Atlanta, Georgia, the studio used by OutKast for their previous albums. Additional recording took place at The Dungeon Recording Studios, The Slumdrum Dreamhouse, and King of Crunk in Atlanta, Dungeon East Studios in Decatur, Georgia, Instrumental Zoo in Miami, Florida, and Kush Studios in Palm Island, Florida. Big Boi discussed the Stankonia studio's environment in an interview for The Guardian, calling it [...] "comfortable but gritty enough to get <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> state of mind of being raw and ready to kill stuff", while noting that the sessions were accompanied by [...] "some candles, a little red light, maybe some crunk juice and a cigar; every now and then perhaps a little 'purple'". While searching for a new record label, he completed recording for the album. The album was mastered on May 27, 2010.|$|E
500|$|A {{portion of}} the clip's premise was {{inspired}} by Jackson's then-relationship with record producer Jermaine Dupri, which was unconfirmed and had generated speculation within the media. Meyers explained, [...] "In the other video we were shooting, {{she came out of}} the trailer wearing a So So Def jacket, and that's when I got the idea, 'it would be great if you do a whole video if you look like you do now when you're going home'. It took her a minute, she thought about it, she asked JD if he'd be okay with doing the video, 'cus I was begging and I was like, 'if I could get the two of <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> simple video together, it's gonna be gold.' She asked and he said yea, and that's when my video came to life." [...] Meyers also had the idea for Dupri's cameo due to persistent rumors of their relationship circulating in the media, saying [...] "That's the whole concept here, a real simple video and then the slam dunk is JD's in the video. He hasn't been in any of her stuff and all the rumors of 'are they together, are they not together.'" ...|$|E
