500|$|Tragedy befell Alice on 29 May 1873, {{when her}} {{youngest}} and favourite son, Friedrich, called [...] "Frittie", died after falling 20feet from a window. The child suffered from haemophilia, {{and although he}} regained consciousness, the internal bleeding could not be stopped. Alice never recovered from Frittie's death, writing to her mother two months later: [...] "I am glad {{you have a little}} coloured picture of my darling. I feel lower and sadder than ever and miss him so much, so continually." [...] However, the Queen's attention was more focused on the engagement of her son Prince Alfred to the Grand Duchess Marie Alexandrovna of Russia, the only surviving daughter of Tsar Alexander II and his first wife, Empress Marie Alexandrovna. The Tsar had refused to present his daughter for pre-marriage inspection in England, and instead invited the Queen to meet the family in Germany. Alice supported this suggestion, and on the same day she wrote to the Queen about how much she missed Frittie, the Queen wrote to Alice in scathing terms: [...] "You have entirely taken the Russian side, and I do not think, dear child, that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>tell</b> me...what I ought to do." ...|$|E
500|$|In the film, Carey's {{character}} Billie Frank argues {{with her}} boyfriend and producer Dice (Max Beesley) and they break-up. Her emotional pain leads her to solo songwriting. Dice also misses Billie, and also begins writing a song. Billie goes to Dice's apartment {{in an attempt to}} reconcile. He was not home, but the music he has written is and Billie realizes they wrote the same song: [...] "Never Too Far". She kisses the sheet music, leaving a lipstick imprint, which Dice later discovers. Dice plans a reconciliation, but is killed by Billie's former producer Timothy Walker (Terrence Howard) after Dice did not pay the US$100,000 from their agreement to release Billie from Walker's contract. At Billie's first show at Madison Square Garden, her management and support crew see a report of the murder on television. They wonder if Billie was with him, they see that she is there and has seen the report. Billie onstage commands the band to stop playing [...] "Loverboy", tells the crowd never to take someone for granted, and that if you love them, <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>tell</b> them, because you might never have the chance to tell them how you really feel. She then starts to sing [...] "Never Too Far".|$|E
2500|$|The Elijah {{of legend}} {{did not lose}} any {{of his ability to}} afflict the comfortable. The case of Rabbi Eliezer son of Rabbi Simon ben Yohai is illustrative. Once, when walking a beach, he came upon a hideously ugly man—the prophet in disguise. The man greeted him courteously, [...] "Peace be with thee, Rabbi." [...] Instead of {{returning}} the greeting, the rabbi could not resist an insult, [...] "How ugly you are! Is there anyone as ugly as you in your town?" [...] Elijah responded with, [...] "I don’t know. Perhaps <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>tell</b> the Master Architect how ugly is this, His construction." [...] The rabbi realized his wrong and asked for pardon. But Elijah would not give it until the entire city had asked for forgiveness for the rabbi and the rabbi had promised to mend his ways.|$|E
