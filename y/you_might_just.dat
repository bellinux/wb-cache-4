On the show's music Alexander Gilmour, writing for Financial Times said that the show: [...] "has half a dozen numbers that bring the house down", and that [...] "it feels grown-up.

500|$|The Marble Index [...] "failed to {{challenge}} the supremacy of Nashville Skyline, From Elvis in Memphis, Abbey Road and Diana Ross & the Supremes Join the Temptations on the album charts of 1969". Although Holzman {{was pleased with the}} album, Nico's longevity with the label was unlikely; he was increasingly concerned with her heroin use and she had a difficult, irresponsible attitude. Nico left the United States before she was officially released from Elektra, after a violent incident in a New York City bar. Biographers refer to her leaving the U.S. as an exile; Nico said, [...] "When you live in a dangerous place, you also become increasingly dangerous. <b>You</b> <b>might</b> <b>just</b> wind up in jail." [...] In London she recorded two more albums with Cale in the same vein: Desertshore (1970) and The End... (1974), now considered parts of a trilogy. The album was reissued as a CD in 1991 with two bonus tracks. Songs off The Marble Index have been included in Nico compilations, including The Classic Years (1998), Femme Fatale (2002), and The Frozen Borderline – 1968–1970 (2007). To celebrate Elektra's 60th anniversary, [...] "Frozen Warnings" [...] was released as a single on October 25, 2010, with [...] "No One Is There" [...] as its B-side.|$|E

Eurogamer stated [...] "Like a compacted version of its parent game, {{this is the first}} DLC that has felt like a genuine expansion, as opposed to a just a few inconsequential missions thrown together." [...] IGN noted that [...] "he stories and characters here are filled with that trademark Fallout dark humor, elevating these quests to a level that rivals the main game" [...] and that [...] "he major draw to Point Lookout... is its emphasis on exploration." [...] Edge calls it [...] "the best expansion so far and the game at its worst," [...] stating [...] "if you want a microcosm of Fallout 3, equal parts adventuring, grinding, questing and scavenging, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>just</b> think it the best expansion so far." [...] Edge goes on to criticize Point Lookout for using [...] "a lot of what you might call 'economy content' in Point Lookout: recycled enemies, text journals, variant weapons, and bogus forks in the storyline." ...|$|E
