5|$|The Swedish {{automotive}} startup Uniti Sweden AB {{has been}} working on an electric city car entirely designed to be sustainable. The CEO Lewis Horne said “When people sell electric cars, the motivation is sustainability. So, why are they so heavy, and why are they the same cars? Where <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>take</b> out petrol and you put in the huge battery and you call it sustainable. But it’s not.”. The company has been designing a car that uses sustainable and recycled material such as bio-composite to reduce the footprint of the car during production. In addition, the fully automated factory provided in partnership with Siemens will be able to work with the lights turned off during 22h per day to save energy.|$|E

500|$|Ayala Ben-Yehuda from Billboard {{positively}} {{noted that}} the album was [...] "certainly more adventurous than anything from her peers", but felt that its execution seemed a [...] "little forced". She singled out the tracks [...] "Gypsy" [...] and [...] "Why Wait" [...] as album highlights. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine thought that [...] "she (Shakira) takes quite well to the (electro-pop) sound", but felt that the album had a [...] "bit of an identity problem". Ben Ratliff from The New York Times gave the album a negative review and criticized The Neptunes' productions. He concluded the review by saying that [...] "there should be no American edition of Shakira: <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>take</b> her, in all her daffiness, or leave her".|$|E

5000|$|Moynihan has {{repeatedly}} denied political ties. In {{response to the}} various political accusations leveled against him, Moynihan calls the Far right [...] "a bunch of isolated losers" [...] and further that:Whether they're the Marxist/Communist/Socialist {{people who think that}} humans want to get along on a grand scale, or whether it's the Nazis, who think that if everyone was just of the same race, they'd all get along perfectly, or the anarchists, who think everyone would love to live this way if <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>took</b> away the police.|$|R
500|$|The Futon Critic {{placed the}} episode {{first in the}} site's annual [...] "50 Best Episodes" [...] list. [...] E! said that [...] "Through the Looking Glass" [...] was {{possibly}} [...] "the best episode ever of the entire series." [...] TV Guide described [...] "Through the Looking Glass" [...] as [...] "a dizzying exercise in adventure, sustained tension and time-shifting rug pulling [...] spectacularly produced, amazingly directed and gloriously acted." [...] IGN gave the double episode a perfect 10/10 – the best review of the season – saying it was [...] "nothing short of a masterpiece of storytelling with a brilliantly paced narrative." [...] IGN would conclude that the flashforward was the [...] "Biggest Shock" [...] in 2007 television. Both IGN and The Los Angeles Times would later declare [...] "Through the Looking Glass" [...] as the second best Lost episode, behind [...] "The Constant". BuddyTV praised the unpredictability, saying that [...] "no other show can even attempt to do what Lost does." [...] BuddyTV would later call [...] "Through the Looking Glass" [...] the best finale of 2007 and Charlie's death the saddest TV death of 2007. [...] "Through the Looking Glass" [...] was TV.coms [...] "Editor's Choice" [...] for [...] "Best Episode" [...] of 2007. [...] AOLs TV Squad gave the episode a 7/7, noting that [...] "the writers followed through on Desmond's premonitions and successfully delivered the highly anticipated game-changer." [...] Television Without Pity gave the third season finale an [...] "A". [...] The Sydney Morning Herald wrote that Lost [...] "may have unjumped [...] with [...] flashforward." [...] Entertainment Weekly ranked {{it as one of}} the top ten episodes of 2007, saying that the cliffhanger [...] " [...] new dimensions to [...] creative world." [...] Zap2It questioned [...] "whether to be deeply frustrated (again), really, really confused (a distinct possibility) or just in awe of the incredible mind-(ahem) show runners… have pulled off." [...] The writing for Locke was criticized, and one IGN writer said that [...] "it seems irrational that he would go and [...] in the back without explaining himself." [...] Lindelof stated [...] "that we might be willing to give [...] the benefit of the doubt for any action he took in response to , even if considered slightly 'out of character'." [...] Film and television director and writer Kevin Smith said that [...] "to do [...] seasons and then suddenly throw a massive curveball is just so dramatically satisfying, <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>take</b> your hats off to the writers in a big, bad way." ...|$|E
2500|$|A new {{scene with}} Regan at the {{hospital}} receiving treatment to diagnose her [...] "unusual" [...] behavior. The doctor tells Chris MacNeil that Regan told him to [...] "keep his fingers away from her Goddamn cunt," [...] as depicted in the novel. This scene sets up her bizarre behavior earlier and clarifies the scene where Chris tells Regan [...] "it's just like the doctor said, it's just nerves. <b>You</b> <b>just</b> <b>take</b> your pills and you'll be fine." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although the ALF members reject {{violence}} against people, many activists support attacks on property, comparing {{the destruction of}} animal laboratories and other facilities to resistance fighters blowing up gas chambers in Nazi Germany. Their argument for sabotage is that the removal of animals from a laboratory simply means they will be quickly replaced, but if the laboratory itself is destroyed, it not only slows down the restocking process, but increases costs, possibly {{to the point of}} making animal research prohibitively expensive; this, they argue, will encourage the search for alternatives. An ALF activist involved in an arson attack on the University of Arizona told No Compromise in 1996: [...] "t is much the same thing as the abolitionists who fought against slavery going in and burning down the quarters or tearing down the auction block ... Sometimes when <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>take</b> animals and do nothing else, perhaps that is not as strong a message." ...|$|E

5000|$|In early 2009, Elsley began finding writers for the North American version. Elsley said [...] "We {{started at}} the top of the Hollywood tree and worked our way down, and it wasn't until we got to the bottom that we {{actually}} found writers we liked. We started saying to agents, 'Who have <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>taken</b> on? Who's got a great play on somewhere?' And that turned up just incredible writers that have never done anything." [...] After reading 400 scripts around the clock, a team of six was formed.|$|R

"Now, see here, Glo," [...] {{continued}} the parent, rather sternly, [...] "don't {{let me hear}} any more about 'aspirations'-which are always adulterated with terra alba-nor 'aims'-which {{will give you the}} gripes like anything. <b>You</b> <b>just</b> <b>take</b> this two shilling-piece and invest every penny of it in lollipops!" ...|$|E

2500|$|On {{choosing}} {{to write the}} character and develop the series initially, Goddard said, [...] "With Matt Murdock I just had such a personal connection to that character it was just like, 'I have to do this.'
