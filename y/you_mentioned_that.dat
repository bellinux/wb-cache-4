6000|$|... "Ay! I rose {{this morning}} at an early hour, and imagining that both you and Beckendorff had not yet made your appearance, I escaped from the grounds, {{intending}} to explore part of the surrounding country. In my stroll I came to a narrow winding road, which I am convinced lies in the direction towards Reisenburg; there, for some reason or other, I loitered more than an hour, and very probably should have been too late for breakfast had not I been recalled to myself by the approach of a horseman. It was Beckendorff, covered with dust and mud; his horse had been evidently hard ridden. I did not think much {{of it at the}} time, because I supposed he might have been out for three or four hours and hard worked, but I nevertheless was struck by his appearance; and when <b>you</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>that</b> he went out riding at a late hour last night, it immediately occurred to me that had he come home at one or two o'clock it was not very probable that he would have gone out again at four or five. I have no doubt that my conjecture is correct; Beckendorff has been to Reisenburg." ...|$|E
60|$|With {{respect to}} the grounds, you have there the {{advantage}} of being in good hands, namely, those of Nature; and, assuredly, whatever petty crosses from contrariety of opinion or any other cause you may now meet with, these will soon disappear, and leave nothing behind but satisfaction and harmony. Setting out from the distinction made by Coleridge which <b>you</b> <b>mentioned,</b> <b>that</b> your house will belong to the country, and not the country be an appendage to your house, you cannot be wrong. Indeed, in the present state of society, I see nothing interesting either to the imagination or the heart, and, of course, nothing which true taste can approve, in any interference with Nature, grounded upon any other principle. In times when the feudal system was in its vigor, and the personal importance of every chieftain might be said to depend entirely upon the extent of his landed property and rights of seignory; when the king, in the habits of people's minds, was considered as the primary and true proprietor of the soil, which was granted out by him to different lords, and again by them to their several tenants under them, for the joint defence of all; there might have been something imposing to the imagination in the whole face of a district, testifying, obtrusively even, its dependence upon its chief. Such an image {{would have been in the}} spirit of the society, implying power, grandeur, military state, and security; and, less directly, in the person of the chief, high birth, and knightly education and accomplishments; in short, the most of what was then deemed interesting or affecting. Yet, with the exception of large parks and forests, nothing of this kind was known at that time, and these were left in their wild state, so that such display of ownership, so far from taking from the beauty of Nature, was itself a chief cause of that beauty being left unspoiled and unimpaired. The improvements, when the place was sufficiently tranquil to admit of any, though absurd and monstrous in themselves, were confined (as our present Laureate has observed, I remember, in one of his essays) to an acre or two about the house in the shape of garden with terraces, &c. So that Nature had greatly the advantage in those days, when what has been called English gardening was unheard of. This is now beginning to be perceived, and we are setting out to travel backwards. Painters and poets have had the credit of being reckoned the fathers of English gardening; they will also have, hereafter, the better praise of being fathers of a better taste. Error is in general nothing more than getting hold of good things, as every thing has two handles, by the wrong one. It was a misconception of the meaning and principles of poets and painters which gave countenance to the modern system of gardening, which is now, I hope, on the decline; in other words, we are submitting to the rule which you at present are guided by, that of having our houses belong to the country, which will of course lead us back to the simplicity of Nature. And leaving your own individual sentiments and present work out of the question, what good can come of any other guide, under any circumstances? We have, indeed, distinctions of rank, hereditary legislators, and large landed proprietors; but from numberless causes the state of society is so much altered, that nothing of that lofty or imposing interest, formerly attached to large property in land, can now exist; none of the poetic pride, and pomp, and circumstance; nor anything that can be considered as making amends for violation done to the holiness of Nature. Let us take an extreme case, such as a residence of a Duke of Norfolk, or Northumberland: of course you would expect a mansion, in some degree answerable to their consequence, with all conveniences. The names of Howard and Percy will always stand high in the regards of Englishmen; but it is degrading, not only to such families as these, but to every really interesting one, to suppose that their importance will be most felt where most displayed, particularly in the way I am now alluding to. This is contracting a general feeling into a local one. Besides, were it not so, as to what concerns the Past, a man would be sadly astray, who should go, for example, to modernise Alnwick and its dependencies, with his head full of the ancient Percies: he would find nothing there which would remind him of them, except by contrast; and of that kind of admonition he would, indeed, have enough. But this by the bye, for it is against the principle itself I am contending, and not the misapplication of it. After what was said above, I may ask, if anything connected with the families of Howard and Percy, and their rank and influence, and thus with the state of government and society, could, in the present age, be deemed a recompence for their thrusting themselves in between us and Nature. Surely it is a substitution of little things for great when we would put a whole country into a nobleman's livery. I know nothing which to me would be so pleasing or affecting, as to be able to say when I am in the midst of a large estate--This man is not the victim of his condition; he is not the spoiled child of worldly grandeur; the thought of himself does not take the lead in his enjoyments; he is, where he ought to be, lowly-minded, and has human feelings; he has a true relish of simplicity, and therefore stands the best chance of being happy; at least, without it there is no happiness, because there can be no true sense of the bounty and beauty of the creation, or insight into the constitution of the human mind. Let a man of wealth and influence shew, by the appearance of the country in his neighbourhood, that he treads in the steps of the good sense of the age, and occasionally goes foremost; let him give countenance to improvements in agriculture, steering clear of the pedantry of it, and showing that its grossest utilities will connect themselves harmoniously with the more intellectual arts, and even thrive the best under such connection; let him do his utmost to be surrounded with tenants living comfortably, which will bring always with it the best of all graces which a country can have--flourishing fields and happy-looking houses; and, in that part of his estate devoted to park and pleasure-ground, let him keep himself as much out of sight as possible; let Nature be all in all, taking care that everything done by man shall be in the way of being adopted by her. If people chuse that a great mansion should be the chief figure in a country, let this kind of keeping prevail through the picture, and true taste will find no fault.|$|E

40|$|I {{spoke with}} {{you last night}} along with my client Bill Patterson {{regarding}} his property at 1120 W. Redlands Blvd. in Redlands. As you know Caliber Collision Center has occupied Bill's property for the past 15 years, however, they will be moving {{as a result of}} the proposed future RR line coming to Redlands in the years to come. Per our conversation as it sits right now Bill's property will become land locked once construction starts. <b>You</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>that</b> SANBAG has ordered a Preliminary Title Report and is going to do a title search to try and find if a legal easement for ingress and egress existed at one time for the property. Can you find out what Title Company you have ordered this from and what progress they are making and pass along their findings? FYI- I have ordered a Prelim from First American Title Insurance Company in Ontario, but haven't received it yet. Bill has asked me to market the property to get a new tenant or sell the property, but without future legal access into the property it makes it virtually impossible. Attached is an aerial photo showing the subject property. Please advise. Thank you...|$|E

There are several names on the list that I correspond with regularly and also a couple that Iâ€™ve been wondering about. However, in the letter itself <b>you</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>that</b> you had sent me a package on May 28 th and as yet you had received not acknowledgement from me. But I did write you soon after receiving some camel cigarettes. If for some reason the letter did not reach you, I would like to express my thanks again now and also let you know that you have the correct address. How Iâ€™d like to get up to Rhode Island for a good swim. Here at Miami Beach we have plenty of bathing facilities, but during the summer the temperature of the water reaches 85 or 88 degrees, and after a swim you are not refreshed like you lucky folks are a home. There is one break we get here in Florida though, and that is we can go bathing and lay on the beach wile you are wrapped up in heavy winter clothing to keep warm. The ocean temperature averages around 70 or 75 degrees in the winter and it sure feels good. Even this simmer we are getting the breaks. So far the hottest day we have had has been 86 and Iâ€™ve seen by the Providence Papers that you have had much warmer days even though you can look forward to a cool day now and then. Well, again thanks for the letter and packages Iâ€™ve had from you folks. Keep up the good work, and {{best of luck to you}} all. Sincerely, T/Sgt. B. F. Bullock T/Sgt. Bertram F.
