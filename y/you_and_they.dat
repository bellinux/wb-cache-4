They come up to <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> know who you are. And they go, 'We're really excited about Battlefield Earth.'"

500|$|Eastwood {{is known}} for his {{economical}} film shoots; his regular camera operator, Steve Campanelli, indicated the rapid pace at which Eastwood films—and his intimate, near-wordless direction—also featured during Changelings shoot. Eastwood limited rehearsals and takes to garner more authentic performances. Jolie said, [...] "You've got to get your stuff together and get ready because he doesn't linger... He expects people to come prepared and get on with their work." [...] Campanelli sometimes had to tell Jolie what Eastwood wanted from a scene, as Eastwood talked too softly. To provide verisimilitude to certain scenes, Eastwood sometimes asked Jolie to play them quietly, as if just for him. At the same time he would ask his camera operator to start filming discreetly, without Jolie's seeing it. Malkovich noted Eastwood's direction as [...] "redefining economical", saying Eastwood was quiet and did not use the phrases [...] "action" [...] and [...] "cut". He said, [...] "Some —like Clint Eastwood or Woody Allen—don't really like to be tortured by a million questions. They hire <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> figure you know what to do, and you should do it... And that's fine by me." [...] Ryan also noted the calmness of the set, observing that her experiences working with director Sidney Lumet on 100Centre Street and Before the Devil Knows You're Dead were useful due to his sharing Eastwood's preference for filming a small number of takes. Donovan said Eastwood seldom gave him direction other than to [...] "go ahead", and that Eastwood did not even comment on his decision to play Jones with a slight Irish accent: [...] "Actors are insecure and they want praise, but he's not there to praise you or make you feel better... All he's there to do is tell the story, and he hired actors to tell their story." [...] Gaffer Ross Dunkerley said he often had to work on a scene without having seen a rehearsal: [...] "Chances are we'll talk about it for a minute or two, and then we're executing it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Despite his {{opposition}} to idolatry, his father Azar would still send Ibrahim to sell his idols in the marketplace. Once there, Ibraham would call out to passersby, [...] "Who will buy my idols? They will not help <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> cannot hurt you! Who will buy my idols?" [...] Then Ibrahim would mock the idols. He would {{take them to the}} river, push their faces into the water and command them, [...] "Drink! Drink!" [...] Once again, Ibrahim asked his father, [...] "How can you worship what does not see or hear or do you any good?" [...] Azar replied, [...] "Dare you deny the gods of our people? Get out of my sight!" [...] Ibrahim replied, [...] "May God forgive you. No more will I live with you and your idols." [...] After this, Ibrahim left his father's home for good.|$|E

It is {{a charming}} scene, and we may {{reasonably}} assume that there was reality in the salutations. Such civilities of intercourse between proprietors and their laborers are still, says Dr. W. M. Thomson, common in the East. [...] "The Lord be with you is merely the [...] "Allah makum!" [...] of ordinary parlance; and so too the response, The Lord bless thee" [...] ('The Land and the Book,' p.648). Modern Moslems are particular {{in the matter of}} salutations. [...] "Abuhurairah reports that he heard Mohammed say, You will not enter into paradise until you have faith, and you will not complete your faith until you love one another, and that is shown by. making salaam to friends and strangers" [...] (Kitto's 'Bible Illustrations,' in loc.).|$|E
