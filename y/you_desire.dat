25|$|In 1894, Boyce {{was elected}} to the Idaho state senate as a Populist from Shoshone County, Idaho. Boyce battled for the eight-hour day for miners, the {{establishment}} of an arbitration board to settle labor disputes, and an investigation of the 1892 mining war. He objected to appropriations for the state militia, charging that it was a tool used by the state and mine owners to suppress labor. He called for legislation to forbid employment of aliens, to outlaw yellow-dog contracts and prohibit company stores. In {{one of the most dramatic}} speeches he ever made, Boyce denounced the blacklist:Senate bill fifty six provides for no class, no special legislation, but under its provisions those relentless persecutors, known as corporations, are prevented when they discharge an employee from following him with a blacklist and depriving him of the means of earning an honest living in another part of the state….Why do you not produce some argument against it to show that it should not become a law? No, it is not necessary: you of the Republican party have the votes to kill the bill and that is all <b>you</b> <b>desire.</b> But remember these words: the laboring men of Idaho have asked you for bread and you give them a stone: we ask you for justice and you treat us with scorn, but the day is fast approaching when your action will be condemned by every man who has one drop of manly blood in his veins.|$|E
500|$|In {{her final}} soliloquy, Brünnhilde thanks the Rhinemaidens for their [...] "good advice". They have {{apparently}} {{told her the}} full story of Siegfried's ensnarement and betrayal, and advised that only {{the return of the}} ring to the waters of the Rhine can lift its curse. Brünnhilde sings: [...] "What <b>you</b> <b>desire</b> I will give you: from my ashes take it to yourselves. The fire...will cleanse the curse from the ring". She exhorts the Rhinemaidens to [...] "carefully guard it" [...] in the future, then leaps into the flames of Siegfried's pyre. The fire blazes up to fill the stage, representing the destruction of the gods. As the Rhine overflows its banks the Rhinemaidens appear, making for the ring. Hagen, who covets the ring, shouts to them [...] "Get back from the ring!" [...] (Zurück vom Ring!), the last words of the drama. He is seized by Woglinde and Wellgunde and dragged into the Rhine's depths, as Flosshilde grabs the ring, holds it aloft, and joins her sisters [...] swimming in circles as the waters of the Rhine [...] gradually subside.|$|E

2500|$|Sonnet 147 {{reveals a}} paradox within the poet, {{and perhaps the}} {{population}} at large, between desiring the exact sin or ill which makes one sickly, unstable, or less completely whole as an individual, and knowing the thing <b>you</b> <b>desire,</b> {{in this case the}} poet's mistress, is the very thing causing trouble. Scholar Don Paterson, like many other Shakespearean scholars, have proposed this particular sonnet was in part inspired by an ending passage in The Old Arcadia written by Sir Phillip Sydney, which reads, [...] "Sicke to the death, still loving my disease".|$|E

2500|$|Pull {{motivation}} {{is the opposite}} of push. It is a type of motivation that is much stronger. [...] "Some of the factors are those that emerge {{as a result of the}} attractiveness of a destination as it is perceived by those with the propensity to travel. They include both tangible resources, such as beaches, recreation facilities, and cultural attractions, and traveler's perceptions and expectation, such as novelty, benefit expectation, and marketing image." [...] Pull motivation can be seen as the desire to achieve a goal so badly that it seems that the goal is pulling us toward it. That is why pull {{motivation is}} stronger than push motivation. It is easier to be drawn to something rather than to push yourself for something <b>you</b> <b>desire.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Since the Kamikaze {{attacks were}} to be made only if the pilots had volunteered, there were two methods to collect volunteers. One was an {{application}} for all pilots in general, and another was a survey for the special flight officer probationary cadets (college graduates like Kiyoshi Ogawa) only. The survey asked: [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>desire</b> earnestly/wish/do {{not wish to be}} involved in the Kamikaze attacks?" [...] Kiyoshi Ogawa had to circle one of the three choices, or leave the paper blank. The reason that the special flight officer probationary cadet had to answer such a survey rather than send the applications at their own will was because the military had known that the students who had come from college had a wider vision, and would not easily apply for such a mission. Some college graduates, who did not volunteer willingly, were pressured to circle [...] "desire earnestly" [...] in the survey.|$|E

[...] "For the Palestinian people, death has become an industry, at which women excel, and so do all the people living on this land.
