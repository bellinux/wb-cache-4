50|$|The <b>yellow</b> <b>boxfish</b> (Ostracion cubicus) is {{a species}} of boxfish. It {{can be found in}} reefs {{throughout}} the Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean as well as the south eastern Atlantic Ocean. It reaches a maximum length of 45 cm.|$|E

5000|$|The Mercedes-Benz Bionic was {{a concept}} car created by DaimlerChrysler AG under the Mercedes Group. It was first {{introduced}} in 2005 at the DaimlerChrysler Innovation Symposium in Washington, D. C. The Bionic was modelled after a type of fish, the <b>yellow</b> <b>boxfish,</b> Ostracion cubicus, [...] and also has 80% lower nitrogen oxide emissions with its selective catalytic reduction technology.|$|E
5000|$|In 2006, Mercedes-Benz {{unveiled}} its Bionic concept car, {{which was}} inspired by the shape of the <b>yellow</b> <b>boxfish.</b> [...] It was assumed that due to the extreme agility with which boxfish maneuver, that their shape was aerodynamic and self stabilizing. However, analysis by scientists suggests that boxfish agility is instead due to the combination of an aerodynamically unstable body {{and the manner in which}} the fish use their fins for movement.|$|E
50|$|The {{exterior}} {{design was}} modelled after the <b>yellow</b> <b>boxfish</b> (Ostracion cubicus), a marine fish {{that lives in}} coral reefs. Mercedes-Benz decided to model the Bionic after this fish due to the supposed low coefficient of drag of its body shape and the rigidity of its exoskeleton; this influenced the car's unusual looks. Other parts of the design include {{the fact that the}} rear wheels are partially fitted with plastic and that it's considered as a lightweight vehicle. Mercedes-Benz reported a drag coefficient of 0.19; for comparison, the production vehicle with the lowest ever Cd value was the GM EV1, at 0.195. While the Bionic had a much larger internal volume than the EV1, the Bionic's larger frontal area made the EV1 more aerodynamic overall, as drag {{is a product of the}} area and the drag coefficient.|$|E
