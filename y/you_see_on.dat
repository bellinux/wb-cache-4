500|$|At {{the start}} of the 2001–02 season, he had an {{unsuccessful}} trial with Cambridge United. He was then set to sign for Northampton Town, however, Kevin Wilson was sacked and the club's plans to sign the defender were halted. Stuart eventually joined Bury in October 2001 on a short-term contract, which was later extended to a two-and-a-half-year deal in February 2002. He made his debut for the club in the 1–0 away win at Hartlepool United in the Football League Trophy on 16 October 2001. He was sent-off in his third game for Bury in the 5–1 defeat to Brentford. Stuart scored his only goal for Bury on 22 December 2001, in the 1–1 draw at home to Blackpool. Bury went 1–0 down in the first-half, before Stuart equalised in the 53rd minute, with a shot that went in off the post. During his 18-month spell with Bury, Stuart was a first-team regular, making 61 appearances in the Third Division, scoring once. Bury finished seventh in the league during the 2002–03 season, qualifying for the play-offs. He also gained a total of four red cards and four yellows in the 18-months he was with Bury, including a red card in the 2002–03 play-off semi-final first leg against Bournemouth. Stuart was allegedly elbowed in the face by Wade Elliott, which resulted in his nose being broken and Stuart reacting by grabbing Elliott's shirt. Referee, Jeff Winter, adjudged Stuart had thrown a punch, whilst Andy Preece criticised Stuart for raising his arms to another player, defended him saying [...] "I can't see why he thinks Jamie has punched him in the face...the explanation from the ref doesn't add up with what <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>on</b> the video." ...|$|E

500|$|Vocalist David Draiman states that, lyrically, {{the album}} was {{inspired}} by various occurrences of bad luck that happened to him. [...] "I had a motorcycle accident, and I had my garage burn down with most of my vehicles," [...] Draiman commented. [...] "...I've had really bad relationships that I've {{been in and out}} of. They've left their mark", he concluded. The song [...] "Indestructible" [...] is [...] "an anthem for soldiers", Draiman comments.

[...] "Inside the Fire" [...] is about [...] "standing over the body of my girlfriend, who just killed herself, and the Devil is standing over me, whispering in my ear to kill myself," [...] says Draiman. The song [...] "The Night" [...] is, [...] "just kind of meant to portray the night almost as like a living entity that sets you free. You're enveloped by it, enmasked by it," [...] Draiman comments. The band's vocalist also says the song [...] "Perfect Insanity" [...] is about [...] "toying with the idea of insanity. Coming at you from the perspective from the individual who is [...] and warning people around him, particularly his love interests, about his psychotic tendencies." [...] Draiman says the track [...] "Divide" [...] "is meant to detract from the idea 'oh, let's all be one, let's all be united!' Fuck that, be yourself, be an individual, stand out, make your mark, make an impact." [...] Commenting on the meaning of the song [...] "Façade", Draiman says it is, [...] "...a song {{from the perspective of a}} girl in a relationship where she's abused... she's thinking about killing him, like <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>on</b> the news." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bianca's exit storyline centred upon an extramarital {{affair with}} her mother's boyfriend Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass). Lindsey Coulson, who played Bianca's mother Carol, {{returned}} to the serial especially to facilitate Palmer's exit. Carol had last been seen on-screen in 1997. When the affair was uncovered, Bianca was disowned by Carol, and her marriage to Ricky ended after Carol forced her to confess the affair to him too. Bianca's exit week was spread out over five episodes, beginning with an hour-long special on Sunday 5 September 1999 (at the time the typical weekly broadcast was 3 episodes a week). Mal Young, BBC's Controller of Continuing Drama Series, described the revelatory hour-long Bianca special as a Play For Today, and Kathryn Flett of The Guardian described the week's episodes as a [...] "bravura, edge-of-the-sofa, five-night performance". Commenting on her exit in 1999, Palmer said, [...] "It was really sad. We were all crying our eyes out – the crew {{as well as the}} cast.

2500|$|Michael Musto of The Village Voice {{commented on}} the media's {{reaction}} to the incident, saying, [...] "Janet became a symbolic Joan of Arc to burn at the stake. I actually do think her breast {{was used as a}} diversionary tactic – I'm not sure to distract from Iraq specifically – but it did distract from important issues, from things we actually should be appalled by. The story got an undue amount of attention when the fact is, nobody has proved how her breast harmed anyone." [...] Speaking to Robert Tannenbaum of Blender Magazine, Jackson had strong, if guarded, views on the reactions, saying the furor [...] "is hypocritical, with everything <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>on</b> TV. There are more important thing to focus on than a woman's body part, which is a beautiful thing. There's war, famine, homelessness, AIDS". The fact that it happened in an election year [...] "did have {{a great deal to do}} with it. They needed something to focus on instead of the war, and I was the perfect vehicle for that. People are going to think what they want. It was an accident. It was not a stunt. That was embarrassing for me to have all those people see my breast. That's like having your penis hanging out in front of millions and millions of people." [...] Janet declared the reaction to the accidental exposure as [...] "contradictory", noting it to occur in an era where commercials for beer and Viagra are both [...] "very sexual" [...] and [...] "practically omnipresent". Jackson also said the mishap was [...] "not intentional" [...] and a [...] "costume accident", also commenting on some media outlets editing her taped apology, saying, [...] "Sometimes they cut out that I said it was an accident...That's what the media does, that's the way they are because they want it to be told a different way." [...] In Glamour Magazine, Janet exclaimed, [...] "It's hard to believe that there's a war and famine going on in the world and yet people made such a big deal about a breast. People said that it was done intentionally to sell records. Do you know what? I have never pulled a stunt. Why would you do that and have your album come out two months later? It doesn't make sense." [...] In the ensuing months, Janet felt overwhelmed by the hostility towards her. [...] "People think I'm immune to being hurt by what's said. They ask me questions that shock me. Not everybody is as strong as the next person and words can kill. People push you and you start to think, 'Can I handle this?' But I know I can." ...|$|E
2500|$|As scripted by writer Rockne S. O'Bannon, Alien Nation was {{originally}} called, Future Tense. The film {{took some of}} its concept from the TV series In the Heat of the Night, with science fiction elements integrated in the plot. During production, the film had a working title called, Outer Heat, which essentially was an amalgam of In the Heat of the Night and a 1960s science fiction TV series, The Outer Limits. Jack Collis emphasized that the film was not a [...] "space epic" [...] but more of an action film. He admitted, [...] "We did build a spaceship, but it's a simple thing that <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>on</b> a TV monitor describing the landing of the aliens several years ago, before they became assimilated into our society. It gives us a background {{but not a lot}} of detail, ..." [...] Collis noted that the film was even [...] "reminiscent of the work I did in Cocoon." [...] An earlier draft of the film was actually written by director James Cameron in 1987, but his name however, was not credited in the final cut of the film. One conceit of the script was that immigrations officials ran out of names for the 300,000 aliens, and began to name them after familiar appellations of the past. Actor Mandy Patinkin's original name for his character was set to be George Jetson. However, three days before the start of shooting, Hanna-Barbera wouldn't allow the name to be used. Expressing his disappointment, Patinkin said, [...] "I assumed that the name of the character I agreed to play was George Jetson. And I was pretty pissed off that there was a screw-up and that the name couldn't be used." [...] He went on to say, [...] "I thought it made a tremendous difference to the piece that the guy's name was George Jetson because it gave a cartoon feeling, an innocence that was important to the movie's whole idea. It's a great loss to the piece that we couldn't recover, a great misfortune that couldn't be solved. It would have helped a lot." [...] In reference to the cartoon character, the producers would leave in the name [...] "George" [...] as a substitute. Patinkin added, [...] "Everything in the script is Jetson, everything on the makeup is labeled Jetson, we always refer to him as Jetson. Not even George, but Jetson. So in our minds, he's George Jetson. So as far as I'm concerned, anybody who sees the movie, they're watching George Jetson no matter what the hell they call him." [...] To understand his role of being a police officer, Patinkin spent two weeks hanging out with the New York City Police Department. He took their training course, joined them on patrol, and spent time with them at the firing range. Commenting on the character development of Francisco, he said [...] "It's one of the better jobs that people from his race have acquired. He feels very {{proud of the fact that}} he's able to be a cop." [...] In 2013, when asked about his role in the film, Caan initially replied, [...] "Why would you bring up that?" [...] before stating, [...] "Yeah, well, I don’t know. I don’t have too many... I mean, I loved Mandy Patinkin. Mandy was a riot. But... I don’t know. It was a lot of silly stuff, creatively. And we had this English director who I wasn’t really that fond of. I mean, nice guy, but... it was just one of those things where, you know, you don’t quit, you get through it. It certainly wasn’t one of... I wouldn’t write it down as one of my favorite movies. But it was pretty popular." ...|$|E
