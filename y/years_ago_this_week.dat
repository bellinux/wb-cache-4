40|$|In {{this article}} drawing {{on her new}} book, All the Way with the USA, Ann Capling argues that Australia needs a trade policy that puts trade, rather than foreign relations, at centre-stage.   A <b>YEAR</b> <b>AGO</b> <b>this</b> <b>week,</b> Australian trade negotiators in Washington were in the final frantic stages of trying to stitch {{together}} {{a free trade agreement}} with the United States.   Throughout the year-long negotiation, the Howard government had stressed the importance of getting a good deal for Australia, which included the removal of US restrictions on major Australia’s agricultural exports. In the dying hours of the negotiations, however, it was evident that the agreement was going to fall well short of Australia’s expectations - despite a personal plea from the prime minister to President Bush for the smallest of concessions. Australia’s trade negotiators always knew this would be a difficult negotiation, but even they were shocked at the lousy deal on offer from Washington. Yet their recommendation that the agreement not be signed was overridden by Prime Minister Howard, who was clearly of the view that a bad deal was better than no deal at all. For Howard, the issue was not so much about specific costs and benefits for industries or for social programs, or even the net economic benefits overall. Fundamentally, this trade agreement was about politics, not economics. At the domestic political level, Howard’s triumph in securing a free trade agreement with the US was promoted as evidence of his economic and foreign policy credentials, especially compared to the new leader of the Labor opposition, Mark Latham. The Coalition argued that any move by Labor to block the trade agreement was evidence of its anti-Americanism, and showed that a Latham Labor government could not be trusted to manage Australia’s relations with the United States, including the alliance. This proved to be a remarkably effective political tactic: although Labor was deeply divided on the merits of the agreement, in the end, Latham was not willing to torpedo it. Apart from domestic political considerations, there was one reason above all why Howard would not allow our negotiators to return home empty-handed. Australia’s pursuit of the trade agreement was driven by the prime minister’s very strong desire to strengthen Australia’s political and strategic links with the US - an objective that assumed even greater importance with the so-called ‘war on terror’. Howard saw the trade agreement as a means of binding Australia more closely to the United States. As Trade Minister Mark Vaile put it at the signing ceremony, ‘This is the commercial equivalent of the ANZUS Treaty’. But Washington sees it as much more than that, and the Bush administration has made clear that the trade agreement carries with it the expectation of continuing Australian support for the strategic framework of US interests - a commitment that will not end with Australia’s involvement in Iraq. This point was underlined by the US Trade Representative, Robert Zoellick, who declared that any country seeking an FTA with the US must offer its cooperation ‘or better - on foreign policy and security issues’. Since uttering these words, Zoellick has become deputy secretary of state in the new Bush administration and can be expected to hold Australia to this understanding. It has been a cardinal rule of Australian foreign policy that commercial, political and security interests should not be mixed like this. Indeed, the greatest significance of the Australia-US FTA is that it subordinates Australia’s trade interests to other political and strategic interests that {{have little to do with}} our economic welfare. This subordination of trade policy to other political, strategic and electoral concerns could not have come at a worse time. Australia’s trade performance has deteriorated sharply over the past few years and export growth across key sectors - including agriculture, manufacturing and services - has declined dramatically since the late 1990 s. Nor is Australia keeping pace with its competitors, as our share of global markets has also declined markedly during this period. At the same time, imports have grown strongly, resulting in massive trade deficits and the slowing of economic growth. This is not sustainable over the long term, especially in the absence of a coherent trade and industry policy aimed squarely at addressing economic concerns rather than shoring up other foreign policy objectives. Australia urgently needs a new trade policy - one that focuses on investment in infrastructure and education, research and innovation, and industry and export development. For its part, the Coalition government believes that Australia’s salvation will be found in further free trade agreements. Few trade experts share this rosy view. Kim Beazley is eager to press Labor’s credentials in economic policy - getting trade policy right would be an excellent place to start. • Ann Capling is associate professor of political science at the University of Melbourne.

The British Task Force {{eventually}} won the air-war by a whisper and managed to establish a beachhead at San Carlos. After the battle for the Falklands was over, Admiral John ‘Sandy’ Woodward, commander of the 1982 British taskforce admitted that the conflict was ‘a lot closer run than many would care to believe’. As a Royal Navy commander, Woodward was very conscious of the role that a jingoistic British media had played during the war in highlighting the successes of Britain’s Royal Marine Commandos, Parachute Regiment, Scots Guards and Ghurkhas – all elite units of the British Army - in the ground phase of the war. Gritty accounts written by some of the 29 journalists ‘embedded’ with the taskforce contemporaneously described the desperate infantry battles at Goose Green, Darwin, Mount Kent, Mount Longdon, Two Sisters, Mount Tumbledown and Port Stanley as heroic, classic old-style infantry engagements. These battles, whose names are etched permanently into the British Army’s collective martial psyche, are often portrayed as the decisive elements of Margaret Thatcher’s Falklands war. British victory in the Falklands however was essentially decided by a narrow air superiority enjoyed by the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force. It was also far from assured and the deployment of the taskforce – to a remote archipelago 8, 000 miles from Britain – was at all times fraught and problematic...|$|E
40|$|Three <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>this</b> <b>week,</b> the U. S. Supreme Court {{released}} its 5 - 4 decision overturning Louisville and Seattle’s voluntarily implemented integration plans and threatening many voluntary plans across the country, {{the type of}} plans courts had encouraged for many years.   The Parents Involved decision, issued on June 28, 2007, reflected a divided Supreme Court with four justices strongly supporting these voluntary plans and four justices strongly opposed. Justice Kennedy’s opinion decided the issues and explicitly accepted some kinds of desegregation efforts. The divided decision confused many educators and it was somewhat unclear what did remain legal.   In 2008, the Bush Administration {{sent a letter to}} school districts misguidedly interpreting the Parents Involved decision in a way that suggested only race-neutral means of pursuing integration would be legal. This was an inaccurate description of Kennedy’s controlling opinion and suggested that school authorities should abandon all efforts to intentionally pursue integration. As President Barack Obama took office, civil rights groups and other stakeholders anticipated that his administration would be more supportive of integration efforts, including issuing new guidance to replace that from 2008.   Yet, well into the second year of the Obama Administration (which announced earlier this year that it would reinvigorate the Office of Civil Rights) no such guidance about voluntary integration has been issued. From our contacts with school districts across the country, we believe that this guidance is much needed.  In addition to these legal and policy constraints and the opportunities and challenges presented by rapidly shifting demographics in the nation’s public schools, school districts, like other governmental bodies, face significant financial pressure in the wake of declining revenues stemming from the economic crisis.   This economic pressure is forcing school districts to make deep cuts in services, which is another potential constraint for integration efforts.

40|$|Thirty <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>this</b> <b>week,</b> the 19 th President of the American Society of Cytopathology (ASC) {{rose from}} his chair and moved to the podium in the Grand Ballroom of the Hilton Hotel in Washington, D. C., to deliver the annual presidential address. 1 His message {{expressed}} the society's hopes and aspirations for the future of our profession, goals at times seemingly easily within reach but often proving to be disconcertingly difficult to achieve. He chose to describe achievement of these goals for the future {{in the form of an}} allegory illustrating cytopathology as it would be practiced in the "laboratory of the future. " In this presentation, he envisioned refinements to our daily practice that would include: 9 ̆ 5 Voluntary inspection and accreditation of cytopathology laboratories. 9 ̆ 5 Enhanced continuing education programs for cytotechnologists and cytopathologists 9 ̆ 5 Establishment of the American Registry of Cytopathology. 9 ̆ 5 A standardized curriculum for schools of cytotechnology. 9 ̆ 5 Subspecialty boards in cytopathology through the American Board of Pathology. 9 ̆ 5 A standardized cytopathology nomenclature. All these innovations were fully implemented and functioning effectively in your president's laboratory of the future. Taken together, these predictions sound both reasonable and very appropriate by our current standards. However, the date of that speech was November 3, 1971, and the laboratory of the future displayed a calendar on one of its virtual walls indicating the year to be 1976 -just five years into the future. Some of you in this room who attended the 1971 meeting will recall that address offered by Dr. Stanley F. Patten, and you will no doubt remember also that the goals and aspirations embedded in that allegory were matters of intense discussion in the 1970 and 1971 executive sessions of the ASC. Some of those topics, in fact, had been major goals from the very inception of both this organization, in 1951, and the International Academy of Cytology, established in 1957. In the case of some of these goals, achievement came relatively rapidly, while with others, successful attainment was elusive. Let us now consider the evolution of these changes, not through a narrow, 5 -year window, as depicted in Stan's speech, but rather from a 30 -year perspective, which affords a far broader horizon of opportunity. Due in large part to the early leadership of Dr. Thomas R. Simon, and later Dr. Stanley Inhorn, and the concerted efforts of the Ad Hoc Committee on Laboratory Accreditation, the first goal to become a reality was implemented on January 1, 1973, with the initiation of the Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program and publication of established accreditation criteria for cytopathology laboratories...|$|E
