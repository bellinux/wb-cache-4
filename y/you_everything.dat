500|$|Lyrically {{the track}} is written about a failing {{relationship}} {{caused by a}} partner who abuses alcohol. The singer speaks {{of a man who}} faces a disconnect between his personality while drunk and sober, causing the inability to forge a connection. During the second verse Gomez sings [...] "Why is it so different when we wake up? / Same lips, same kiss, but not the same touch / Don't you know that you do it just enough, but not enough / But I know what's next, and I want so much", describing a lover who can only show his true emotions while intoxicated. Later in the song she expresses the pain she feels having wasted so much time into her relationship, and decides to leave her dysfunctional lover: [...] "You've got a hold on me / You're like a wasted dream / I gave <b>you</b> <b>everything</b> / But you don't know how to love me when you're sober".|$|E
500|$|... "4 in the Morning" [...] {{was written}} by Stefani and Kanal, who was also {{responsible}} for its production, while Mark [...] "Spike" [...] Stent provided additional production. Described as a 1980s-inspired midtempo synthpop ballad, the track's instrumentation includes a [...] "light" [...] keyboard, which [...] "runs tie the song together from intro through break", a guitar, synthetic strings and a slick sheen. [...] "4 in the Morning" [...] has a midtempo beat, which according to some critics is [...] "perfect for a slow dance". Stefani's vocals throughout the song's chorus presents a [...] "fast-talking" [...] approach. Lyrically, [...] "4 in the Morning" [...] talks about transparency in a romantic relationship, with the protagonist pleading for a lover to make up his mind. Bill Lamb of About.com added that the song also deals with a relationship on the edge, which {{can be seen in}} the lines: [...] "I'm lying here in the dark, I'm watching you sleep, it hurts a lot." [...] In the chorus, she sings: [...] "I give <b>you</b> <b>everything</b> that I am/I'm handing over everything that I've got/'cause I wanna have a really true love." ...|$|E
500|$|Producer {{and writer}} Chip Johannessen {{felt that the}} scene in this episode in which a human hair is {{discovered}} with a message inscribed upon it was a [...] "perfect" [...] moment, in that it [...] "told <b>you</b> <b>everything</b> about this guy ... but {{you had no idea}} what he was or what he was going to do next ... you know what kind of crazy motherfucker would do that, but where he is or what he's going to do next, who knows". The episode's opening nightmare sequence, in which Jordan Black (Brittany Tiplady) is terrified by a clown crawling along the ceiling, was inspired by the childhood nightmares of Morgan and Wong, and left Tiplady suffering from bad dreams herself for several nights after filming. Producer John Peter Kousakis recalls having visited the episode's set late during production, having felt that make-up effects supervisor Toby Lindala had been doing [...] "fabulous" [...] work on the series' prosthetic body parts. Walking on set to find Lindala's recreation of a quartered corpse, Kousakis remarked [...] "we're doing something special here, but we're also doing something really outrageous". Lance Henriksen also found this scene too graphic to film all at once, taking time between shots to compose himself.|$|E

500|$|British {{newspapers}} The Guardian and The Times both {{gave the}} film {{four out of}} five stars. The Times James Bone said that it [...] "boasts the same sly cultural references and flashes of brilliance that have earned the television series a following that ranges from tots to comparative literature PhDs". The Guardians Peter Bradshaw stated that it [...] "gives <b>you</b> <b>everything</b> you could possibly want" [...] and that he thought, [...] "Eighty-five minutes [...] not long enough to do justice to 17 years of comedy genius". Ed Gonzalez praised the film for its political message, likening the Itchy & Scratchy cartoon at the beginning to President Schwarzenegger's situation later on, as well as the film's visual gags. Randy Shulman praised the cast, and described them as having [...] "elevated their vocal work to a craft that goes way beyond simple line readings", and particularly praised Kavner who he said [...] "gave what must be the most heartfelt performance ever". Roger Ebert gave a positive review, but admitted he was [...] "generally [...] a fan of movies spun off from TV animation". He called it [...] "radical and simple at the same time, subversive and good-hearted, offensive without really meaning to be". Richard Corliss of Time said that the film [...] "doesn't try to be ruder or kinkier, just bigger and better".|$|E
500|$|Tom Young from BBC Music {{said that}} he did not see the actual {{performances}} on the tour and felt that [...] "some of the magnitude of the performance is lost and the track/scene changes appear needlessly long-winded. [...] As far as live albums go, this is a job well done." [...] Stephen M. Deusner from Pitchfork gave a negative review for the album, stating [...] "Madonna herself is mostly to blame. On stage, she draws from a deep well of amazing pop songs and has the money and power to reinvent this sort of traveling circus. So why not try to break down the wall between performance and audience and hold a gigantic rave? [...] Åkerlund gives <b>you</b> <b>everything</b> you don't want from a concert film: incessant quick cuts that you give you no sense of space or stage, overdubbed music and vocals that give you no sense of performance, and only a few shots of the audience to gauge their excitement." [...] Mini Anthikad-Chhibber The Hindu commented that [...] "Madonna pulls out all stops in this effort turn the world into a dance floor and one just has to doff one's hat to her energy." [...] At the 50th Grammy Awards held on February 10, 2008 at Staples Center in Los Angeles, The Confessions Tour won in the category of Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video.|$|E
500|$|Foster {{signed for}} League Two side Rotherham United on 20 June 2011. He signed a one-year {{contract}} with the club, with an option of a second year. Foster made his debut for the club in a 3–0 home victory against Gillingham on 27 August 2011, coming on as an 84th-minute substitute with Rotherham already holding a three-goal advantage. After making no further first-team appearances the following month, Foster was made available for loan by manager Andy Scott. Scott stated Foster lacked both desire and fitness since signing for the club — [...] "If {{you want to be}} match fit, you get yourself match fit. You can work in training, you can stay behind, you have days off, you can get yourself fit. Luke has not been in the side and that tells <b>you</b> <b>everything</b> you need to know". However, no loan move materialised, and Foster made his second appearance for Rotherham in a 3–3 away draw at Morecambe on 25 October 2011. He appeared as a 27th-minute substitute in the club's following match four days later, a 1–1 draw against Northampton Town, and subsequently made his first start in a 2–0 home victory over Aldershot Town on 5 November — Rotherham's first win in 10 matches. In December 2011, Rotherham manager Andy Scott revealed that Foster would miss the rest of the 2011–12 season {{as a result of a}} cruciate ligament damage sustained in a match against Hereford United on 10 December 2011. He was released by Rotherham in May 2012, having made six appearances for the club.|$|E

In the chorus lines, she harmonizes over the sample from [...] "La Di Da Di", [...] "Cause tonight's the night that I give <b>you</b> <b>everything</b> / Music knocking until the morning light / 'Cause we like to party". In the second verse, Beyoncé belts out [...] "in a thick stack of smooth, layered vocals".
