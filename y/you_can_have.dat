5|$|Darla's just misunderstood. Her {{intentions}} are pure, they're {{just kind of}} warped. From her perspective—first she has to eat—she just happens to eat people! Second, {{she was in love}} with Angel, and I always viewed Darla as the jilted ex-wife that could never get over being dumped. If you really look at her, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> sympathy and empathy for her. In the beginning of her life she was a prostitute, Joss and I actually talked about that a lot, that she was probably abused growing up. She did what she needed to do to survive, she just lacked the people skills.|$|E
5|$|Using her {{influence}} at The Miami Herald, Douglas wrote columns about poverty: <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> {{the most}} beautiful {{city in the world}} as appearance goes, the streets may be clean and shining, the avenues broad and tree lined, the public buildings dignified, adequate and well kept... {{but if you have a}} weak or inadequate health department, or a public opinion lax on the subject, all the splendors of your city will have not value. In 1948 Douglas served on the Coconut Grove Slum Clearance Committee, with a friend of hers named Elizabeth Virrick, who was horrified to learn that no running water or sewers were connected to the racially segregated part of Coconut Grove. They helped pass a law requiring all homes in Miami to have toilets and bathtubs. In the two years it took them to get the referendum passed, they worked to set up a loan operation for the black residents of Coconut Grove, who borrowed the money interest-free to pay for the plumbing work. Douglas noted that all of the money loaned was repaid.|$|E

500|$|In 2002, in {{collaboration}} with dynamicist Harold Levison, Stern wrote, [...] "we define an überplanet as a planetary body in orbit around a star that is dynamically important enough to have cleared its neighboring planetesimals ... And we define an unterplanet as one {{that has not been}} able to do so," [...] and then a few paragraphs later, [...] "our Solar System clearly contains 8 überplanets and a far larger number of unterplanets, the largest of which are Pluto and Ceres." [...] While this may appear to contradict Stern's objections, Stern noted in an interview with Smithsonian Air and Space that, unlike the IAU's definition, his definition still allows unterplanets to be planets: [...] "I do think from a dynamical standpoint, there are planets that really matter in the architecture of the solar system, and those that don't. They're both planets. Just as <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> wet and dry planets, or life-bearing and non-life-bearing planets, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> dynamically important planets and dynamically unimportant planets." ...|$|E

He views his Uncle Ben (his father's brother) as his role model rather than his father because Ben {{went out to the}} world as a teenager and was rich by the age of 21. He repeatedly reminds Willy of this.

In one match, Boycott faced a delivery from Foord which he dispatched to the boundary for four. Foord turned to Parkinson and asked: [...] "Christ almighty, what's this lad's name?"

500|$|When {{discussing}} {{the central theme}} of Batman, director Tim Burton explained, [...] "the whole film and mythology of the character is a complete duel of the freaks. It's a fight between two disturbed people", adding that [...] "The Joker {{is such a great}} character because there's a complete freedom to him. Any character who operates on the outside of society and is deemed a freak and an outcast then has the freedom to do what they want... They are the darker sides of freedom. Insanity is in some scary way the most freedom <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>have,</b> because you're not bound by the laws of society".|$|E
500|$|After Mars {{was dropped}} by the label {{less than a year}} after being signed, he stayed in Los Angeles and landed a music {{publishing}} deal in 2005 with Steve Lindsey and Cameron Strang at Westside Independent. [...] Lindsey showed Mars and Jeff Bhasker (who Mars met through Mike Lynn) the ins and outs of writing pop music, and acted as a mentor helping them to hone their craft. Bhasker explained that Lindsey would [...] "mentor us, and kind of give us lectures as to what a hit pop song is, because <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> talent and music ability, but understanding what makes a hit pop song is a whole other discipline." [...] Mars played cover songs around Los Angeles in a band with Bhasker and Eric Hernandez, (Mars' brother), who is now The Hooligans' drummer.|$|E
500|$|Married to the {{daughter}} of the lord of Pont Audemer, Neville died around 1176. After his death, the monks of Battle Abbey petitioned the king to have Neville's body buried at their monastery, perhaps hoping through this action to secure some of Neville's estate. The king is supposed to have replied [...] "I will have his money, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> his body, the demons of hell his soul. Neville had at least four sons – Ives, Thomas, Ralph, and Geoffrey. Neville may have been the father of Alan de Neville, who was a royal justice. [...] Hugh de Neville, who was chief forest justice under Kings Richard I, John, and Henry III, was probably the grandson of the Chief Forester, the son of Ralph. Neville was succeeded in office by Thomas fitzBernard.|$|E

500|$|... "Paranoid Android" [...] was {{recorded}} in actress Jane Seymour's 15thcentury mansion {{near the village of}} St Catherine, near Bath, Somerset. The first edit was over 14minutes long and included a long organ interlude performed by Jonny Greenwood. Radiohead played this extended version during a tour with Alanis Morissette in September 1996. [...] "When we started playing it live, it was completely hilarious," [...] recalled O'Brien. [...] "There was a rave down section and a Hammond organ outro, and we'd be pissing ourselves while we played. We'd bring out the glockenspiel and it would be really, really funny." [...] Before the song's first live performance, Yorke told audiences that [...] "f <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> sex to this one, you're fucking weird." [...] He also sarcastically referred to the version of the song played during the tour as [...] "a Pink Floyd cover".|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, {{director}} Sam Mendes {{had been}} working on a film version of the story for several years, and in June 2003 Sondheim was approached to write the script. Although he turned down the offer, Mendes and producer Walter F. Parkes obtained his approval to use writer John Logan instead. Logan had previously collaborated with Parkes on Gladiator, and claimed his biggest challenge in adapting the Sondheim stage play [...] "was taking a sprawling, magnificent Broadway musical and making it cinematic, and an emotionally honest film. Onstage, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> a chorus sing as the people of London, but I think that would be alienating in a movie." [...] Mendes left to direct the 2005 film Jarhead, and Burton leaped at taking over the direction after his project, Ripley's Believe It or Not!, fell apart due to its excessive budget.|$|E
500|$|Bridges {{opined that}} Tron: Legacy was evocative {{of a modern}} myth, adding that ideas {{alluding}} to technological advancement were prevalent throughout the film. To Cyriaque Lamar of io9, the film's approach to technology was reminiscent of a kōan. [...] "One {{of the things that}} brought me to this film," [...] affirmed Bridges, [...] "was the idea of helping to create a modern-day myth to help us navigate through these technological waters [...] I dig immediate gratification as much as anybody, but it happens so fast that if you make a decision like that, you can go far down the wrong path. Think about those plastic single-use water bottles. Where did that come from? Who decided that? <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> a couple of swigs of water [...] and those bottles don't disintegrate entirely.

500|$|Domestically, the {{reaction}} to the cancellation was split along partisan lines. The Department of Defense was surprised by the announcement; internal expectations were that the number of B-1s ordered would be reduced to around 150. Congressman Robert Dornan (R-CA) claimed, [...] "They're breaking out the vodka and caviar in Moscow." [...] In contrast, it appears the Soviets were more concerned by large numbers of ALCMs representing a much greater threat than a smaller number of B-1s. Soviet news agency TASS commented that [...] "the implementation of these militaristic plans has seriously complicated efforts for the limitation of the strategic arms race." [...] Western military leaders were generally happy with the decision. NATO commander Alexander Haig described the ALCM as an [...] "attractive alternative" [...] to the B-1. French General Georges Buis stated [...] "The B-1 is a formidable weapon, but not terribly useful. For the price of one bomber, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> 200 cruise missiles." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{violence}} of the fight clubs serves not to promote or glorify physical combat, but for participants to experience feeling {{in a society where}} they are otherwise numb. The fights tangibly represent a resistance to the impulse to be [...] "cocooned" [...] in society. Norton believed that the fighting between the men strips away the [...] "fear of pain" [...] and [...] "the reliance on material signifiers of their self-worth", leaving them to experience something valuable. When the fights evolve into revolutionary violence, the film only half-accepts the revolutionary dialectic by Tyler Durden; the Narrator pulls back and rejects Durden's ideas. Fight Club purposely shapes an ambiguous message, the interpretation of which is left to the audience. Fincher elaborated, [...] "I love this idea that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> fascism without offering any direction or solution. Isn't the point of fascism to say, 'This is the way we should be going'? But this movie couldn't be further from offering any kind of solution." ...|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} towards [...] "Fight for This Love" [...] {{has been}} mixed. Ruth Harrison from 'Female First' {{was impressed by}} the song after initially being worried that Cole {{would not be able to}} cope going solo. She said [...] "Whilst it does sound just a little bit Girls Aloud-y, we still love it, and can see it being a huge hit on the club circuit up and down the country ... we think this is going to send her well on her way to global superstardom." [...] Popjustice also liked the song saying [...] "'Fight For This Love' is very definitely not just a Girls Aloud single with one person singing it... its one of those songs <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> on repeat for an hour and a half without getting bored. One thing that hits you is - well, is this really what Cheryl sounds like? Vocally it's a big surprise... As it turns out, she sounds really great - strong, confident, direct. Like a proper pop singer. It's a sleek, powerful production..." ...|$|E
