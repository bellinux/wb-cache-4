2500|$|Flight attendants at {{the carrier}} voted to {{organize}} their workgroup under the Transport Workers Union of America in December 2010, citing scheduling concerns among other {{issues in their}} work rules and the airline's pilots elected to vote on whether to join the International Brotherhood of Teamsters in July 2012. In August 2012, the pilots voted to organize and joined the Teamsters. Allegiant's chairman and CEO, Maurice J. Gallagher Jr., has {{been critical of the}} unionization of airline employees and has stated that [...] "Unionization {{is one of those things}} that clogs the arteries and makes <b>you</b> <b>less</b> quick and not as nimble as you need to be on top of your game... In this industry and others that are heavily unionized, you ultimately end up with bankruptcy as the primary driver" ...|$|E
2500|$|Monáe's {{roots in}} Kansas City, Kansas, {{where she was}} born and raised, are evident in her lyrics and style. According to Carrie Battan's Pitchfork feature on Monáe, the song [...] "Ghetto Woman" [...] {{directly}} addresses Monáe's working-class K.C., Kansas mother – as well as the portrayal of working-class black women in U.S. culture – with the line [...] "Carry on, ghetto woman, even when the news portrays <b>you</b> <b>less</b> than you could be." [...] Monáe also told the London Evening Standard that she has internalized her KCK (K.C., KS) roots by wearing the working-class uniform of her parents and expressing concern that she cannot let [...] "her community down". On her album The ArchAndroid, especially in songs like [...] "Cold War" [...] or [...] "BabopbyeYa", Monáe relates [...] "the dystopian cityscapes depicted in Metropolis to the boarded-up projects of poverty-wracked Kansas". Kansas City, therefore, represents not only Monáe's physical roots within her hometown, but also serves as an important influence on her lyrics and science-fictional setting.|$|E
