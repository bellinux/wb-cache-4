500|$|McG {{described}} the film's theme as [...] "where <b>you</b> <b>draw</b> <b>the</b> line between machines and humans". The friendship between Marcus—who was executed (for murder) when humanity still ruled the world—and Kyle Reese illustrates how war and suffering can {{bring out the}} best in people, such as when they worked together to survive during the Blitz. The title was derived from this second chance given to humanity and to Marcus, in addition to John's efforts to save humanity from the machines. The film's original title was Terminator Salvation: The Future Begins, but this was dropped during filming.|$|E
500|$|On March 8, 2005, a re-release of Too Bad You're Beautiful was issued, {{featuring}} the {{songs from the}} Sin, Sorrow, and Sadness EP. Under direction of producer Richardson, From Autumn to Ashes' third full length album, Abandon Your Friends, was released on August 30, 2005. The album stemmed from the idea that [...] " [...] kind of...what we do. I mean, {{in the sense of}} how life goes on when we go away [...]" [...] Abandon Your Friends met with speculation about the band's internal conflicts surrounding a potential break up. Perri had not been much involved in the process of creating the album and did not attend practice sessions, despite stating in interviews that the album was [...] "a full on collaborative effort" [...] and [...] "We just all had a say in what we were writing." [...] It was revealed in 2007, in interviews, and when Mark posted in the band's Myspace blog that he had ghostwritten Perri's lyrics in a matter of days. The band had made a further move away from the melodic sound of their past albums, and had been a point where the band shifted more focus to Mark's vocals. CMJ reviewer Tracey John explained that the album [...] "continues to unabashedly straddle both ends of the hardcore/emo spectrum", however, the band [...] "doesn't show much of a progression from 2003's The Fiction We Live." [...] The album generally garnered reviews in which it was noted that, as a reviewer at Punk News explained that if you're a [...] "fan of From Autumn to Ashes, you'll be disappointed."Others disagreed, like UK magazine Kerrang! who gave the album a 5 out of 5 review and called it a metal masterpiece. This album would also go on to sell over 100,000 copies. Abandon Your Friends produced one single, [...] "Where Do <b>You</b> <b>Draw</b> <b>The</b> Line?" [...] with an accompanying music video. Unhappy with intraband politics, guitarist Jonathan Cox quit the band.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Independent Investigations Group member John Rael, Minchin explains that what upsets him most about paranormal beliefs is [...] "special pleading" [...] by people who say vague things such as [...] "there is no harm in it". Minchin states that {{there is very little}} harm in something like reiki, but asks [...] "where do <b>you</b> <b>draw</b> <b>the</b> line?" [...] when it comes to needing real evidence if a therapy works or not. He states that he is an atheist as well as a skeptic, and cannot understand how someone can be a skeptic and still be religious. [...] "If you apply doubt to anything...the whole religion thing is obviously a fantasy." ...|$|E

25|$|Another way of {{thinking}} about it is that the problem is not about the chance that the other side is black, it's about <b>the</b> chance that <b>you</b> <b>drew</b> <b>the</b> all black card. If <b>you</b> <b>drew</b> a black face, then it's twice as likely that that face belongs to the black card than the mixed card.|$|R
2500|$|Brando made {{a similar}} comment on Larry King Live in April 1996, saying [...] "Hollywood is run by Jews; it is owned by Jews, {{and they should have}} a greater {{sensitivity}} about the issue of—of people who are suffering. Because they've exploited—we have seen the—we have seen the nigger and greaseball, we've seen the chink, we've seen the slit-eyed dangerous Jap, we have seen the wily Filipino, we've seen everything, but we never saw the kike. Because they knew perfectly well, that that is where <b>you</b> <b>draw</b> <b>the</b> wagons around." [...] Larry King, who is Jewish, replied, [...] "When you say—when you say something like that, you are playing right in, though, to anti-Semitic people who say the Jews are—" [...] Brando interrupted: [...] "No, no, because I will be the first one who will appraise the Jews honestly and say 'Thank God for the Jews'." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a January 2002 {{interview}} for politics/current affairs magazine Magill, Norris discussed {{the age of}} consent, incest, [...] paedophilia and pederasty. The interviewer, restaurant critic Helen Lucy Burke, said, [...] "I found some of his views on sexual matters deeply disturbing - notably on sex with minors". According to Burke, Norris didn't seem to support a minimum age of consent. When asked [...] "Where would <b>you</b> <b>draw</b> <b>the</b> line?" [...] Norris replied, [...] "I would hope we could produce a society where people would be inclined to draw lines for themselves". On 30 May 2011, Burke was a guest on the talk radio show Liveline. Burke {{said that she had}} read the article to Norris before publication, and that he had wholeheartedly endorsed what was written. During the show, it was noted that the Magill article had been reported in a newspaper shortly after publication. The newspaper, Ireland on Sunday, went with the headline [...] "Senator Backs Sex With Children". Burke claimed that, when Norris saw the reaction to the interview, he [...] "back-tracked" [...] and denied saying what had been quoted. She also called Norris' views [...] "evil" [...] and [...] "against the law".|$|E
2500|$|Within {{a week of}} the episode's {{original}} broadcast, {{the official}} Comedy Central website included four deleted scenes from [...] "O Biclops Where Art Thou?". The first 75-second clip is an extended scene of Dongalor proposing to the Cute Girl, in which he discusses his empty heart and his [...] "empty bed...well, empty except for the concubines." [...] In the second clip, an extended scene of the hottub Truth or Dare? game, upon learning that Aneka slept with a troll who lost an eye in battle, an exasperated Kröd asks, [...] "Where do <b>you</b> <b>draw</b> <b>the</b> line? Have you ever 69ed an orc? Teabagged an ogre? Tossed a hobgoblin's salad?" [...] In the third, two-minute clip, Kröd expresses excitement about being called before the Elite Resistance Council, and Aneka expresses anger {{that he wanted to}} go without her. When the two next appear before the council together, the elder Gustav the Short and Curly and Kröd gets into an argument over whether one should have pubic hair atop their heads. In the final, one-minute clip, Kröd expresses anger upon learning of the Pagan village attack: [...] "They can raid our villages, they can burn our crops, they can steal our cattle, but I refuse {{to live in a world}} where good men are shot in the anuses!" [...] Kröd and his friends then get into a discussion about how to pluralize anus before visiting the village.|$|E

60|$|Where would <b>you</b> <b>draw</b> <b>the</b> line, {{and where}} would you begin to leave out?--I would only draw the line when I was {{purchasing}} a picture.

Do you think that that would be the best division, or should you prefer any division which takes special arts, and keeps those arts together?--I should like the Pagan and Christian division.

But this I know, that you, and Issachar also, are striving to snare Fate in a web of sand, and that Fate will be too strong for it and you. I love this woman and she loves me, because such is our destiny, and no barriers which man may build can serve to separate us. Also of this I am assured, that by your plots <b>you</b> <b>draw</b> <b>the</b> evils you would ward away upon the heads of us all, for from them shall spring war, and deaths, and misery.|$|E
6000|$|III. Lastly.

Strive to get the retirement and succession of masses in irregular ground: much may be done in this way by careful watching of the perspective diminutions of its herbage, as well as by contour; and much also by shadows. If <b>you</b> <b>draw</b> <b>the</b> shadows of leaves and tree trunks on any undulating ground with entire carefulness, you will be surprised to find how much they explain of the form and distance of the earth on which they fall.|$|E
