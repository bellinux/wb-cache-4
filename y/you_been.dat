500|$|Many {{other artists}} have covered the song. Joan Baez, who has {{sometimes}} been speculated {{to be the subject}} of the song, covered it on her 1965 album Farewell, Angelina. It is one of four Dylan covers on that album, the others being the title track, [...] "Mama, <b>You</b> <b>Been</b> on My Mind" [...] (recorded as [...] "Daddy, <b>You</b> <b>Been</b> on My Mind"), and [...] "A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall". Baez sings [...] "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue" [...] in a falsetto voice, but retains the power of Dylan's version. Baez has continued to perform the song at live concerts well into the modern era.|$|E

The best-remembered tune from the show is the seven-minute-long [...] "The Ballad of Barry and Freda – Let's Do It". It concerns a couple, Barry and Freda; she is hungry for sex, he isn't. It climaxes with the lines [...] "beat me on the bottom with a Woman's Weekly, let's do it! Let's do it tonight!". The song was performed numerous times by Wood in her live performances. Wood said of the number: [...] "A joy to write, a sod to learn, and I daren't finish a show without it.

500|$|The album's sound also {{incorporates}} diverse musical {{elements from}} various genres such as funk, soul, rock, dubstep, and electro music. Houston Press writer Shea Serrano describes the album as a [...] "new {{take on the}} traditional Southern rap sound. It's slow and fast, wonky and flimsy, lyrical and hook-driven". Tom Breihan of Pitchfork Media perceives [...] "1980s synth-funk" [...] as its predominant musical element, but also finds each track musically varied, stating [...] "New melodic elements flit {{in and out of}} tracks just as you start to notice them, and there's a lot going on at any given moment". Big Boi has called the music [...] "basically what <b>you</b> <b>been</b> getting from Outkast. Raw lyricism and the funkiest grooves you can lay your ears on." ...|$|E

500|$|After the Pixies {{broke up}} in 1993, Santiago {{had stayed in}} touch with every band member. In the summer of 2003, Black decided to begin reuniting the Pixies and called Santiago first. Santiago later explained: [...] "He called me on my {{cellphone}} and I was in Cape Cod visiting family. He said in this coy voice, 'Hey Joey, uh, <b>you</b> <b>been</b> hearin' these rumors that we're getting back together? Gee, I wonder who started it?'

DreamWorks asked the Pixies in early 2004 to compose a song for the Shrek 2 soundtrack. They agreed, and early versions of this new song were recorded in Santiago's basement. With his soundtrack experience, the band, in the words of Deal, [...] "worked it up a bit in Joey's Pro Tools thing", before submitting it to the studio. DreamWorks rejected the song, so the band released it as a single, [...] "Bam Thwok".|$|E

Roger, having danced with Connie, is aroused, but Duane says that all the pills were Tic Tacs. Greg finally reaches the envelope, and Fran's name is circled.

She duets with Connie, and, hugging Fran, Greg mouths to Connie that Fran is getting sacked. Connie and Fran, the latter oblivious, sing to each other, as Roger signs his divorce papers.
