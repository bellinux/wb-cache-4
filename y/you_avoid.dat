Drake then ends up on a balcony singing in front of the Toronto skyline. Both are shown in scenes contemplating intermixed with Songz joining Drake on the balcony. Subsequently scenes are shown of Drake and Songz riding through Toronto nightlife, along with the contemplative scenes, such as a young boy playing basketball in which Songz has an illusion that it is him, and little girl blowing a dandelion. The video ends with the skyline and a quote stating, [...] "Making your mark on the world is hard. If it were easy, everybody would do it. But it's not. It takes patience, it takes commitment, and it comes with plenty of failure along the way. The real test is not whether <b>you</b> <b>avoid</b> this failure, because you won't. It's whether you let it harden or shame you into inaction, or whether you learn from it; whether you choose to persevere."- Barack Obama ...|$|E
2500|$|Byrd {{later called}} joining the KKK [...] "the {{greatest}} mistake I ever made." [...] In 1997, {{he told an}} interviewer he would encourage young people {{to become involved in}} politics but also warned, [...] "Be sure <b>you</b> <b>avoid</b> the Ku Klux Klan. Don't get that albatross around your neck. Once you've made that mistake, you inhibit your operations in the political arena." [...] In his last autobiography, Byrd explained that he was a KKK member because he [...] "was sorely afflicted with tunnel vision—a jejune and immature outlook—seeing only what I wanted to see because I thought the Klan could provide an outlet for my talents and ambitions." [...] Byrd also said in 2005, [...] "I know now I was wrong. Intolerance had no place in America. I apologized a thousand times... and I don't mind apologizing over and over again. I can't erase what happened." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although Lewis's piano playing is {{commonly}} labelled boogie woogie, gospel music was another major {{influence in the}} formation of his technique. [...] In Joe Bonomo's 2009 book Jerry Lee Lewis: Lost and Found, Memphis producer and musician Jim Dickinson calls Lewis's occasional penchant for interrupting the standard boogie woogie left-hand progression by omitting the seventh and repeating the fifth and sixth, creating a repetitive, driving, quasi-menacing momentum, [...] "revolutionary, almost inexplicable. [...] Maybe Ella Mae Morse, maybe Moon Mullican had done it, but not in a way that became the propelling force of the song. [...] Rock and roll piano up to that point had been defined by Rosco Gordon, Ike Turner, and to an extent, Ray Charles. [...] None of them were doing that. [...] Even Little Richard, as primitive as he plays, wasn't doing that shuffle...There was something in Jerry Lee that didn't want to play that seventh, and that's the church. [...] Certainly in white spiritual music <b>you</b> <b>avoid</b> sevenths." ...|$|E

2500|$|Throughout 2011 and 2012, Julian Assange {{has been}} a {{repeated}} target of Brown's condemnation and personal attacks. Calling Assange a [...] "douchey ideologue", a [...] "greedy, paranoid fame-whore", a [...] "Chomsky-quoting grad school student <b>you</b> <b>avoid</b> talking to at parties", and an [...] "epic donkey lusting for celebrity" [...] while mockingly referencing his physical appearance and personal hygiene, Brown harshly criticized the WikiLeaks founder over {{the manner in which}} his organization gathers and distributes information and the way he presents himself in public. Specific things Brown took issue with include what he saw to be Assange's tendency to blame the U.S. and the Jews, his [...] "cozy relations with despots like Alexander Lukashenko", his 2012 [...] "trumped up schlock of a TV show on a Kremlin-backed TV propaganda unit" [...] whose first episode saw him interview Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and [...] "accept Nasrallah's answers about the future of Middle East without bringing up that Hezbollah’s charter calls explicitly for the destruction of Israel and the establishment of an Islamic State", his decision to put up a paywall on the WikiLeaks website, etc. By April 2013, Brown seemingly started coming around on Assange, praising him and WikiLeaks for republishing the Kissinger cables and creating the Public Library of U.S. Diplomacy (PlusD).|$|E
2500|$|Those {{who seek}} immorality must not {{associate}} with women. On the ninth {{day of the}} third month, {{the second day of}} the sixth month, the sixth day of the ninth month, and the third day of the twelfth month, [...] should remain in their rooms and make sure not to look at women. If the Six Corpses (the Three Corpses of the adept himself and of the woman that he looks at?) cause chaos, the blood in your viscera will be disturbed and aroused, your three hun souls will be unguarded. Your spirit will weaken and your qi will leave. All of these [...] will accumulate, and bring about death. As for why <b>you</b> <b>avoid</b> [...] on these days, it is not only to block off lasciviousness. It is [...] to pacify the female palaces. The female palaces are in the shen and the male palaces are in the yin. Yin and shen punish each other. Both execute each other. On these days the Three Corpses of men and women come out from the pupils of the eyes. Female Corpses beckon the male, and male Corpses beckon the female. Misfortune and harm pass back and forth, making the spirit perish and thus blemishing your rectitude. Even if a person does not notice it, his body is exposed and has already been harmed because the Three Corpses fight within the eyes, while blood is shed within the Niwan (a compartment in the brain). On these days, even if it is a girl who you are extremely fond of, or a wife of a close friend, you absolutely must not look them face to face.
