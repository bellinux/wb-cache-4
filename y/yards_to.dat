The entrances are interweaved with the Hudson Yards developments, with the main entrance wedged between 50 Hudson <b>Yards</b> <b>to</b> the east and 55 Hudson <b>Yards</b> <b>to</b> the west. The rest of the Hudson Yards development is located {{very close to the}} south of the station. Both entrances are based on a design by architect Toshiko Mori, which itself is based on the design of smaller station entrances in the Paris Métro.|$|E
5|$|For the game, Trent Richardson ran for 107 <b>yards</b> <b>to</b> {{extend his}} streak of {{consecutive}} games rushing {{for at least}} 100 <b>yards</b> <b>to</b> five games. The defense was dominant in completing their second shutout {{of the season and}} only allowing Vanderbilt 190 yards of total offense. The victory improved Alabama's all-time homecoming record to 77–13–1 and their record against the Commodores to 59–19–4 (61–18–4 without the NCAA vacations and forfeits).|$|E
5|$|Fresno State's {{offensive}} woes {{continued on}} their next drive. On second down, Carr was sacked for {{a loss of}} 18 <b>yards</b> <b>to</b> the 6-yard line. On third down, Hunt recorded another sack {{which resulted in a}} safety to make the score 12-0 SMU. Zach Line rushed for an 8-yard touchdown to cap an 11-play, 67-yard drive after the safety.

5|$|The Atlanta Falcons overcame a 20–7 halftime {{deficit to}} defeat the Buccaneers in {{overtime}} on a Mick Luckhurst field goal. The strategy of running out the clock with a conservative offense that had worked so well against the Lions the previous week backfired against the Falcons. The Buccaneers' offensive line failed to dominate, and the Falcons wound up running 57 offensive plays in the second half, while the Buccaneers ran only 26. Twenty of those plays were runs by Gerald Riggs, who finished the day with 127 yards rushing. The Buccaneers outgained the Falcons 255 <b>yards</b> <b>to</b> 190 in the first half, but were outgained 300 <b>yards</b> <b>to</b> 68 in the second half, in which the Buccaneers never advanced beyond midfield. The win left Atlanta undefeated at 4–0.|$|E
5|$|The Auburn Tigers upset {{expectations}} and tied the Commodores 7–7. Ammie Sikes scored first for Vanderbilt. Auburn scored after a Sikes fumble.

5|$|The Commodores {{ended the}} Tennessee {{game with a}} 7–0 record, having racked up 459 points with no points scored against them.

Virginia gained 495 <b>yards</b> <b>to</b> Vanderbilt's 198. Buck Mayer, the South's first {{consensus}} All-American, starred for Virginia.|$|E

5|$|After {{defeating}} Clemson in {{the inaugural}} Chick-fil-A Kickoff Game, Alabama announced in December 2008 they would {{return for the}} 2009 edition against the Virginia Tech Hokies. The Tide dominated play {{for most of the}} game, outgaining Tech in total offense by 498 <b>yards</b> <b>to</b> 155, but mistakes, penalties, and poor play by the special teams allowed the Hokies to hang on until 18 fourth-quarter points sealed the 34–24 Alabama victory.|$|E

5|$|Beginning {{from their}} 26-yard line after a kickoff, Clemson {{attempted}} to again cut into Tech's lead. The Tigers, again {{guided by the}} running offense of Spiller and Jamie Harper, advanced to the 37-yard line, where Parker's passing attack took over. Parker completed two passes before Georgia Tech defender Jerrard Tarrant ran {{in front of a}} long throw downfield. He intercepted Parker's pass and returned it 50 <b>yards</b> <b>to</b> the Clemson 28, where Tech's offense began anew. Despite the good field position, Tech was unable to gain a first down but still was within range of a 40-yard field goal from Blair, who extended the Yellow Jackets' lead to 33–20.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} the train reached Eccles, the day's drizzle had been {{replaced}} by a storm. The doctors carried Huskisson, still on his door, off the train into a torrent of hail and thunder and walked the few hundred <b>yards</b> <b>to</b> the vicarage, frequently losing their footing as they climbed the deep cutting. Meanwhile, Stephenson and Wilton restarted the train and went on to Manchester to fetch medical assistance.|$|E
5|$|Continuing Navy's {{drive from}} the {{previous}} quarter, Polanco and Eckel continued to run up the middle and {{the right side of}} New Mexico's defense for small gains. Polanco attempted two passes, the first of which was incomplete and the second to slotback Marco Nelson for a first down at the Midshipmen 44-yard line. After 12 plays and over six minutes of game time, the drive reached midfield. After six more rushing plays from Polanco, Eckel, and slotback Eric Roberts, the team reached the Lobos' 28-yard line. Needing three <b>yards</b> <b>to</b> achieve a fourth down conversion, Navy coach Paul Johnson called a time-out. On the next play, Frank Divis threw his second halfback option pass of the day to Polanco, gaining six <b>yards</b> <b>to</b> keep the drive alive. Eckel, Divis, and Roberts rushed for six more plays before the drive came to a halt at the Lobos' 5-yard line. On the final play of the drive, Midshipman kicker Geoff Blumenfeld kicked a 22-yard field goal to make the score 34–19 with 2:07 left in the game.|$|E

Forster {{finished}} {{the season with}} another league winner's medal as Celtic clinched their third consecutive Scottish League title, and his form over the year saw him voted into the PFA Scotland Team of the Year alongside teammates Virgil van Dijk and Kris Commons.|$|E

5|$|From {{that point}} on, the Colts {{took over the}} game. Four plays after the ensuing kickoff, Colts {{defensive}} back Bob Sanders intercepted Grossman's pass and returned it 38 <b>yards</b> <b>to</b> the Bears 41-yard line. Chicago's defense eventually forced a punt, but Smith's 32-yard kick pinned the Bears back at their own 8-yard line. The Bears drove to their own 47, but on a fourth down conversion attempt, tight end Desmond Clark dropped a potential first down reception after being leveled by defensive back Matt Giordano. The Colts subsequently called eight consecutive Dominic Rhodes runs before turning the ball over on downs themselves, leaving only 1:42 remaining in regulation. Five plays later, the game was over.|$|E
