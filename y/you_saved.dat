Flea wrote [...] "Dear plains all American pipeline, my daughter just dared step on the beach {{for a few minutes}} where we live about 75 miles from the Santa Barbara oil spill you caused. She got your oil shit product all over her feet." [...] Flea stated he can no longer surf there or take his daughter to the beach further saying [...] "Some kid in the hood who made a mistake selling drugs will go to jail and have his life ruined but you, you evil lying scumbags will get away with a paltry fine that means nothing to you.

2500|$|Although Rivette {{submitted}} {{his film}} to the Institut des Hautes Études Cinématographiques because it [...] "was {{the kind of}} thing that would have pleased my parents", he was not accepted by the school. He took courses at the Sorbonne, but began frequenting screenings at Henri Langlois's Cinémathèque Française with Bouchet instead of attending classes. At the Cinémathèque, Rivette, [...] Claude Chabrol, Jean-Luc Godard, François Truffaut, Suzanne Schiffman, Gruault and Bouchet were immersed in films from the silent and early [...] "talkie" [...] eras that they were previously unfamiliar with. He and this group of young cinephiles became acquainted as they customarily sat in the Cinématographique's front row for screenings; Rivette met Truffaut at a screening of The Rules of the Game, and sat next to Godard for several months before the latter introduced himself. Rivette was active in post-screening debates, and Rohmer said that in film-quiz competitions at the Studio Parnasse he was [...] "unbeatable". Rivette credited Langlois's screenings and lectures for helping him persevere during his early impoverishment in Paris: [...] "A word from <b>you</b> <b>saved</b> me and opened the doors of the temple". Unlike his contemporaries, Rivette attended screenings at the Cinémathèque well into the 1970s.|$|E
