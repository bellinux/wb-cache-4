5000|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began in}} Paris in July 2010. Allen {{states that the}} fundamental aesthetic for the camera work was to give the film a warm ambiance. He describes that he likes it (the cinematography), [...] "intensely red, intensely warm, because {{if you go to}} a restaurant and you're there with your wife or your girlfriend, and it's got red-flecked wallpaper and turn-of-the-century lights, <b>you</b> both <b>look</b> <b>beautiful.</b> Whereas if you're in a seafood restaurant and the lights are up, everybody looks terrible. So it looks nice. It's very flattering and very lovely." [...] To achieve this he and his cinematographer, Darius Khondji, used primarily warm colors in the film's photography, filmed in flatter weather and employed limited camera movements, in attempts to draw little attention to itself. This is the first Woody Allen film to go through a digital intermediate, instead of being color timed in the traditional photochemical way. According to Allen, its use here is a test to see if he likes it enough to use on his future films.|$|R
