500|$|Stetson's {{original}} {{concept for}} the New History Warfare trilogy was largely skeletal, and developed as the albums were recorded. New History Warfare Vol. 1 {{was released in}} 2008 and had a narrative concept of a story {{of people who had}} been living at sea for generations. New History Warfare Vol. 2: Judges, released in 2011, told the story of one of these people finally arriving on land. New History Warfare Vol. 3: To See More Light expanded on this, with Stetson stating that [...] "it’s a war story. It’s finding <b>your</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> this shining beacon on the mountaintop," [...] and that it [...] "deals with death and love." ...|$|E
500|$|Jon Favreau {{said it was}} {{originally}} his intent to create a film trilogy for Iron Man, with Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) becoming Iron Monger during the sequels. After a meeting between Favreau and various comic book writers, including Mark Millar, Stane became the main villain in Iron Man. Millar argued the Mandarin, whom Favreau originally intended to fill that role, was too fantastical. Favreau concurred, deciding, [...] "I look at Mandarin more like how in Star Wars you had the Emperor, but Darth Vader is the guy {{you want to see}} fight. Then you work <b>your</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> the time when lightning bolts are shooting out of the fingers and all that stuff could happen. But you can't have what happened in Return of the Jedi happen in A New Hope. You just can't do it." [...] Favreau also discussed in interviews how the films' version of Mandarin [...] "allows us to incorporate the whole pantheon of villains". He mentioned that S.H.I.E.L.D. would continue to have a major role.|$|E

She comes to the gate– the gate is closed with a human leg; she goes into the yard– there a barrel full of blood; she goes up the stairs– there dead {{children}}; the porch is closed with an arm; on the floor– arms, legs; the door is closed with a finger. Baba Yaga comes to meet her {{at the door and}} asks her, “Have you seen anything, my dear, on <b>your</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> my house?” “I saw,” the girl answers, “the gate closed with a leg.” “That is my iron latch.” “I saw a barrel in the yard full of blood.” “That is my wine, my darling.” “I saw children lying on the stairs.” “Those are my pigs.” “The porch is closed with an arm.” “That is my latch, my golden one.” “I saw in the house a hairy head.” “That is my broom, my curly one,” said Baba Yaga, then got angry with her prying goddaughter and ate her.|$|E
500|$|On the April 18 of Impact Wrestling, James {{defeated}} Ms. Tessmacher {{to become}} the number one contender to the Knockouts Championship. James received her title match the following week, but was defeated by defending champion Velvet Sky. On the May 23 episode of Impact Wrestling, James defeated Sky after attacking her injured knee to become a three-time Knockouts Champion. The following week, James began portraying a villainous persona by calling out Velvet Sky, acting sarcastic and pompous towards her, and also did not help Sky when she was attacked by Gail Kim. James turned villainous on the June 13 episode of Impact Wrestling, when she attacked Sky when the latter {{said that she was}} ready for a rematch. James and Sky had their rematch on the June 27 episode of Impact Wrestling, where James retained her championship. On the July 4 episode of Impact Wrestling, James justified her actions by claiming that getting {{to the top of the}} Knockouts division requires [...] "clawing and scratching <b>your</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> the top"; James also claimed that [...] "no woman would ever be as great as her" [...] and she'll [...] "stand atop the division as the greatest Knockouts Champion of all time". On the July 25 episode of Impact Wrestling, James successfully defended the championship against Gail Kim. At the September 6 airing of Knockout Knockdown, James defeated Serena Deeb to qualify for the gauntlet battle royal finals, in which James was lastly eliminated by Gail Kim. James lost the Knockouts Championship on the September 19 episode of Impact Wrestling to ODB. Four days later, it was revealed that James had failed to come to terms on a contract renewal with TNA. James later stated in an interview that she technically wasn't under contract with TNA, but she did not confirm that she was gone. On November 15, 2013, James appeared in an interview on WWE.com, discussing her history with WWE and the possibility of making a return to the company. At the December 6 airing of World Cup of Wrestling, James was a member of Team USA, along with James Storm, Christopher Daniels, Kazarian and Kenny King. James was defeated by Team Aces & Eights' Ivelisse Vélez following interference from the other members of Aces & Eights. Team USA would go on to defeat Team Aces & Eights in a 5-on-5 elimination tag team match, in which James gained a measure of retribution by eliminating Vélez during the match. James and Storm were presented with the trophy afterwards.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Dual Spires enhanced" [...] video at the Psych website lists further {{references}} to Twin Peaks. Shawn's name for Gus in this episode is [...] "Lodge Blackmunn", a direct {{reference to the}} Black and White Lodge. Leo the Cinnamon Owl is a reference to Killer BOB, who possessed Leland Palmer and often {{took the form of}} an owl. The sheriff's deputy is Deputy Frost, named after Twin Peaks co-creator Mark Frost. The doctors of both Dual Spires and Twin Peaks have coconuts in their offices. Both Paula's and Laura's diaries described meetings with [...] "J". Sheriff Jackson tells Bob he needs to be strong for his wife. Dr Hayward says the same thing to Leland Palmer in Twin Peaks. Upon entering the town Gus mentions that the residents are looking {{at him as if he}} were the first black man they had ever seen. There are very few black men in Twin Peaks. When they enter the Sawmill Diner Bob Barker says [...] "Top of the morning to you." [...] In the first season of Twin Peaks, Pete Martell corrected Josie Packard on the saying. Maudette wears an orchid in her hair; Harold grew orchids in Twin Peaks. In the library Shawn asks if they can [...] "poke around" [...] but he and Gus immediately say [...] "peek" [...] in correction. Thus [...] "peek", as in Twin Peaks, is spoken twice. A man wearing a hat in the Sawmill Diner gives Shawn and Gus a thumbs up. The older room service attendant did the same thing to Agent Cooper in Twin Peaks. A record player is featured prominently in both the Barker and Palmer homes. The Roadhouse was also a location in Twin Peaks. Both Maudette and Audrey Horne love to dance. Paula's friend Jack is completely blind in one eye, referencing Twin Peaks' brothel named [...] "One Eyed Jacks". In the library Shawn and Gus find a book entitled [...] "Putt <b>Your</b> <b>Way</b> <b>to</b> a Better Future." [...] After Leland Palmer killed Maddy Ferguson he was seen putting golf balls around in his living room. When Randy is using the table saw it resembles the sawmill scene from the extended opening credits of Twin Peaks. When Maudette is placed in the body bag it is bent in such a way that it resembles a smile, like the smiling bag clue Agent Cooper found. On Maudette's desk beside her computer is a roll of green tape like the kind used by Leland Palmer to tie up Jacques Renault. In the cabin Bob Barker lights a match and holds it up like Leland Palmer did when describing BOB to Agent Cooper. Bob Barker wears a gold ring on his pinky, something Agent Cooper did in Twin Peaks. In the cabin the walls are red with red drapes as an allusion to the [...] "Red Room" [...] in Agent Cooper's dream.|$|E

2500|$|In late 2001, Zhang was {{transferred}} to the eastern coastal province of Shandong to become governor.

[...] This was seen as Zhang trying to send a signal that he intended to distance himself from a political culture rife with corruption and complex rules around guanxi. In Shandong, Zhang was known to conduct 'undercover visits' to survey the lives of ordinary people. When Zhang left office, Shandong's GDP had exceeded 2 trillion yuan (~$300 billion), ranking second among provinces in the country.|$|E

Though Jimmy Early and the Dreamettes' first {{performance}} together is successful ("Fake <b>Your</b> <b>Way</b> <b>to</b> the Top"), Jimmy is desperate for new material. Curtis convinces Jimmy and Marty {{that they should}} venture beyond traditional rhythm and blues and soul audiences and aim for the pop market. C.C. composes [...] "Cadillac Car" [...] for Jimmy and the Dreamettes, who tour ("Cadillac Car (On the Road)") and record the single upon their return ("Cadillac Car (In the Recording Studio)"). [...] "Cadillac Car" [...] makes its way up the pop charts, but a cover version by white pop singers Dave and the Sweethearts ("Cadillac Car" [...] (Reprise)) steals the original recording's thunder. Angered by [...] "Cadillac Car's" [...] usurpation, Curtis, C.C., and Jimmy's producer, Wayne, resort to payola, bribing disc jockeys across the nation to play Jimmy Early and the Dreamettes' next single, [...] "Steppin' to the Bad Side". As a result, the record becomes a major pop hit. Conflict arises between Marty and Curtis when Curtis moves in on Marty's turf: Jimmy Early. Things become more complicated when Effie begins dating Curtis, and Jimmy, a married man, begins an affair with Lorrell ("Party, Party").|$|E
2500|$|In Odisha, {{the festival}} is known as Deepavali (Odia: ଦୀପାବଳୀ). The festival day starts with drawing rangolis {{in front of the}} house. The rangoli is drawn in the shape of {{sailboat}} on {{the ground in front of}} the house and is filled with items such as cotton, salt, mustard, asparagus root, turmeric and a wild creeper. Prasad is placed in the central chamber, over which a deepa of a jute stem with cloth wick is lit. This marks the beginning of Puja. Tarpanam – the ritual meant to invoke the spirits of the ancestors. Immediately after the dusk, all members of household gather for lighting Kaunria (pith of the jute plant). A lighted lamp is placed inside an earthen pot that is tied to a pole erected in front of the house. All the members then hold a bunch of jute stick in their hands and light them from the fire from the main deepa and raise the bunch towards the sky chanting the following verse. Then, in the presence of every member of the house, a bundle of the Kaunria is lit during the Puja and raised skywards accompanied with the chant: [...] "Badbadua ho andhaara re aasa aalua re jaa" [...] meaning [...] "O' forefathers come in the dark of the evening, we light <b>your</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> the heaven". The significance of the ritual is that we show respect to our ancestors who reinforce their absence from the physical world by our presence.|$|E
