[...] "You seem to be a handy man and a man of action," [...] I continued, [...] "and I am sure I could find you a {{comfortable}} job somewhere in the States." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tush! can't {{you make}} it a little more out of the common way than that? But, Harcourt, without joke, you need not trouble yourself. I did want you to see her; but I don't care twopence as to your liking her. I shall think much more of your wife liking her--if <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> wife." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Miss Rayner, did you ever--when {{you were}} {{standing}} quiet like a lady--did <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> cowboy dive {{at you with}} a terrible lunge--grab you and hold you so you couldn't move or breathe or scream--hug you till all your bones cracked--and kiss you so fierce and so hard {{that you wanted to}} kill him and die?" ...|$|E

6000|$|He laughed, and said: [...] "How {{strange that}} seems! I suppose I shall {{get used to}} it. But in town we seem never to have a whole day for a day's work; {{we always have to}} do part of it at night, or the next morning. Do <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> day here that's too large a size for its work?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know any}} good word to say," [...] she answered, [...] "except {{that you take}} {{excellent}} care of babies, and I am {{not at all sure}} that that would have any weight with Stephen Petter. Since you are going to the inn, and since we have already talked together so much, I wish I did properly know you. Did <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> sister at Vassar?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hurt!"--Mrs. Cassidy gave a soprano {{scream of}} delight. [...] "Well, say--did <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> brick house fall on you?--well, that's {{just the way}} it feels--just like when they're digging you out of the ruins. Jack's got a left that spells two matinees and a new pair of Oxfords--and his right!--well, it takes a trip to Coney and six pairs of openwork, silk lisle threads to make that good." ...|$|E
60|$|Mister, <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> real shock--something {{that came}} out of nowhere and just knocked you flat? I have, and I'm {{going to tell you about}} it.|$|R

I come up, after having fallen asleep myself, below, and find you in your wrapper here, with the nightmare. Affery, woman,' said Mr Flintwinch, with a {{friendly}} grin on his expressive countenance, 'if <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> dream of this sort again, it'll be a sign of your being in want of physic.

6000|$|... "Oh, let us!" [...] cried Imogene, rushing {{down to the}} brink. [...] "I don't want {{to throw}} stones into it, but to get near it--to get near to any bit of nature. They do pen you up so from it in Europe!" [...] She stood and watched Colville skim stones over the current. [...] "When you stand by the shore of a swift river like this, or near a {{railroad}} train when it comes whirling by, don't <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> morbid impulse to fling yourself forward?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Morpheus paraphrases the Chinese philosopher Zhuangzi {{when he asks}} Neo, “Have <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> dream, Neo, {{that you}} were so sure was real?

6000|$|... "Like that--enough to give colic to an ostrich, eh? Awful. Well, {{there was}} a cook there who loved me--an old fat, Negro woman with spectacles. I used {{to hide in the}} kitchen and turn her to, to make me dulces--sweet things, you know, mostly eggs and sugar--to pass the time away. I am like a kid for sweet things. And, by the way, why don't <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> pudding at your tablydott, Mr. Schomberg? Nothing but fruit, morning, noon, and night. Sickening!

Excellent light wines on the premises, French cookery, millions of roses, two cows (for milk punch), vegetables cut for the pot, and handed in at the kitchen window; five summer-houses, fifteen fountains (with no water in 'em), and thirty-seven clocks (keeping, as I conceive, Australian time; having no reference whatever to the hours {{on this side of the}} globe).|$|E
6000|$|GILBEY. My Uncle Phil was a teetotaller. My {{father used}} to say to me: Rob, he says, dont <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> weakness. If you find one getting a hold on you, make a merit of it, he says. Your Uncle Phil doesnt like spirits; and he makes a merit of it, and is {{chairman}} of the Blue Ribbon Committee. I do like spirits; and I make a merit of it, and I'm the King Cockatoo of the Convivial Cockatoos. Never put yourself in the wrong, he says. I used to boast about what a good boy Bobby was. Now I swank about what a dog he is; and it pleases people just as well. What a world it is! ...|$|E

[...] "I've often heard what good beasts you are, {{in spite of}} your power to do {{mischief}} to mankind, and now I know that the stories are true.

6000|$|I {{was born}} a yellow pup; date, locality, {{pedigree}} and weight unknown. The first thing I can recollect, an old woman had me in a basket at Broadway and Twenty-third trying to sell me to a fat lady. Old Mother Hubbard was boosting me to beat the band as a genuine Pomeranian-Hambletonian-Red-Irish-Cochin-China-Stoke-Pogis fox terrier. The fat lady chased a V around among the samples of gros grain flannelette in her shopping bag till she cornered it, and gave up. From that moment I was a pet--a mamma's own wootsey squidlums. Say, gentle reader, did <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> 200-pound woman breathing a flavour of Camembert cheese and Peau d'Espagne pick you up and wallop her nose all over you, remarking {{all the time in}} an Emma Eames tone of voice: [...] "Oh, oo's um oodlum, doodlum, woodlum, toodlum, bitsy-witsy skoodlums?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ippegoo," [...] he said solemnly {{and very}} slowly, [...] "I am not your torngak. I am an angekok, and as I chanced to be passing by your hut in my wanderings, I stopped to hear. I have heard {{enough to be}} able to tell you that you shall never be an angekok. Nor shall <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> torngak. You do not need one. You are wise enough already, much wiser than your master, who is no better than a miserable puffin. Is it not the duty of one who would be an angekok to go away and live alone for many days fasting, and praying, and meditating? Has not Ujarak advised you to change the ancient customs? Pooh! he is a fool. You cannot succeed now. All the spirits of water, earth, and air have been insulted. This {{assembly}} must break up. You must leave off trying. You may all be thankful that the ice does not burst up and crush you; that the sky does not fall upon you; that the great sea does not roll its maddest waves over you. Up, all of you--Begone!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not at all. You need a {{lot more}} than that. That's only the start. You've got to follow up the good work, you see. That's where a number of chappies would slip up, and I'm pretty certain I should have slipped up myself, but for another {{singularly}} rummy occurrence. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> what-do-you-call it? What's the word I want? One of those things fellows get sometimes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pretty? Oh, PRETTY doesn't {{seem the}} right word to use. Nor beautiful, either. They don't go far enough. Oh, it was wonderful--wonderful. It's the first thing I ever saw that couldn't be {{improved}} upon by imagination. It just satisfies me here"--she put one hand on her breast--"it made a queer funny ache {{and yet it was}} a pleasant ache. Did <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> ache like that, Mr. Cuthbert?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> man try {{to explain}} to you what {{happened}} in a book {{as far as he}} has read? It is a most instructive thing. Sinclair, the man who shares my rooms with me, made such an attempt the other night.
