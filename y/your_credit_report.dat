50|$|Individuals {{experiencing}} {{identity theft}} can take immediate steps {{to limit the}} damage to their finances and personal life. The {{first step is to}} contact one of the three national <b>credit</b> <b>reporting</b> companies and place an initial fraud alert. This is done by contacting a national <b>credit</b> <b>reporting</b> company, asking them to put a fraud alert on <b>your</b> <b>credit</b> file, and confirming that they will notify the other two companies of this change. The next step is to order free <b>credit</b> <b>reports</b> from each of the three national <b>credit</b> <b>reporting</b> companies. Lastly, report the identity theft to the FTC and print an FTC identity theft affidavit and then file a police report and ask for a copy of the report.|$|R

5000|$|Credit {{scores are}} {{compiled}} from information sources relating to credit, such as number of credit accounts held, balances on each account, dates of collection activity, and so on. Credit scores do not measure any financial or personal {{activity that is}} not related to credit, and identity fraud that does not involve credit will not appear on <b>your</b> <b>credit</b> <b>report</b> or affect your credit score. Credit scores and the credit scoring system are also very predictable—there are specific steps you follow to improve your credit score, dispute errors in credit reports, etc.|$|E

They offered most of the features you could get from the normal local phone companies such as caller ID, call waiting, three way calling, speed dial, call blocker, and call waiting ID. Comm South did allow payment arrangements/extensions if you were unable to pay your bill by the due date but the payment extension was never allowed beyond only a week or two. If you were disconnected for non payment by Comm South, it was never reflected on <b>your</b> <b>credit</b> <b>report</b> because a) it was prepaid service and b) you didn't have to use your real name or social security number.|$|E
40|$|In an {{increasingly}} digital world, it can often feel like numbers define us. Whether {{your social security}} number, your phone number, or <b>your</b> <b>credit</b> score, the cold truth is that your identity is often boiled down to a single number. In the financial world, <b>your</b> <b>credit</b> score traditionally defines <b>your</b> eligibility for <b>credit</b> {{and the cost of}} credit, but the uses of credit scores have expanded to include premiums for insurance, employment eligibility, and other non-financial determinations. Particularly in tough financial times, small fluctuations in credit scores can have large impacts on consumers’ access to affordable credit. As furnishers and <b>credit</b> <b>reporting</b> agencies increasingly send information to each other electronically and use electronic forms for error resolution, the human element of the consumer can get lost in the translation. <b>Credit</b> <b>reporting</b> agencies investigate consumer disputes electronically by using codes to signify complicated and nuanced challenges to errors on <b>credit</b> <b>reports</b> without paying much attention to the specific claims made by consumers. In a system dominated by cold numbers, how can consumers defend their reputations and hold furnishers responsible for errors on their <b>credit</b> <b>reports?</b> This article addresses whether or not consumers can bring state claims against data furnishers and how the system can be reformed to create a more fair and efficient method of resolving <b>credit</b> <b>report</b> inaccuracies. First, this article explains the current regulation of the <b>credit</b> <b>reporting</b> market and the competing preemption provisions of the Fair <b>Credit</b> <b>Reporting</b> Act. Second, using recent case law, this article analyzes the different methods that courts use to reconcile the competing provisions of FCRA. Third, this article argues for adoption of a more inclusive standard, the recklessness standard, for state claims brought by consumers, particularly because of the industry’s movement towards electronic dispute resolution systems. Finally, this article makes recommendations to clarify preemption under the FCRA and improve the dispute process for consumers, including possible actions by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and federal legislation...|$|R

5000|$|One of {{the most}} typical mistaken belief about credit rating {{is that the only}} trait that matters is <b>your</b> <b>credit</b> rating- whether you have {{actually}} made payments on time as well as satisfied your monetary obligations in a prompt way.

Furthermore, your repayment background is only shown in <b>your</b> <b>credit</b> history ...|$|R
5000|$|This is, however, not {{the case}} with the Making Home Affordable Programs through the federal government. When using the Home Affordable Foreclosure Alternatives (HAFA) Program, short sales and Deeds in Lieu may not impact <b>your</b> <b>credit</b> <b>report</b> as {{negatively}} as other programs or options. From the Making Home Affordable website: [...] "Unlike conventional short sales, a HAFA short sale completely releases you from your mortgage debt after selling the property. This means you will no longer be responsible for the amount that falls [...] "short" [...] of the amount you still owe. The deficiency is guaranteed to be waived by the servicer. In a HAFA short sale, your mortgage company works with you to determine an acceptable sale price. HAFA has a less negative effect on your credit score than foreclosure or conventional short sales." [...] Homeowners can utilize specialized negotiators to ensure their rights are protected.|$|E
50|$|Fortunately, {{there are}} {{precautions}} {{that one can}} take {{in order to prevent}} identity theft. There are simple ways in which to avoid becoming a victim of identity fraud and an easy way to remember them is the acronym SCAM. SCAM reminds us to 1. Be stingy when giving out personal information to others 2. Check financial information regularly and recognize when something strange has occurred 3. Ask for a copy of <b>your</b> <b>credit</b> <b>report</b> often, and 4. Maintain careful financial records. It is necessary to be aware of phishing and to always be cautious of giving your personal information out through e-mail, website or over the phone. Also be sure that the phone number, name and mailing address registered to your bank account is all correct as there are cases in which bank statements have been sent to false addresses and identities have been stolen. Check these bank statements regularly and be sure that there are no charges to your account that you do not recognize.|$|E
40|$|<b>Your</b> <b>credit</b> <b>report</b> is {{a history}} of your credit {{management}} behavior. There are three major U. S. credit bureaus: Equifax, Experian and TransUnion. The credit bureaus gather information on your credit use and provide it to lenders and other businesses. <b>Your</b> <b>credit</b> <b>report</b> affects your buying power. It affects your ability to obtain a credit card, a loan, a job, an apartment and sometimes the rate you pay for your automobile insurance.

50|$|Like {{the other}} major <b>credit</b> <b>reporting</b> bureaus, Experian is chiefly {{regulated}} in the United States by the Fair <b>Credit</b> <b>Reporting</b> Act (FCRA).

Like its main competitors, TransUnion and Equifax, Experian markets <b>credit</b> <b>reports</b> directly to consumers. Experian heavily markets its for-profit <b>credit</b> <b>reporting</b> service, FreeCreditReport.com, and all three agencies have been criticised and even sued for selling <b>credit</b> <b>reports</b> that can be obtained at no cost.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the development of}} a <b>credit</b> <b>reporting</b> system in China. We first outline the rationale for having a <b>credit</b> <b>reporting</b> system through reviewing the literature on asymmetric information.

First we present a case study of a private <b>credit</b> <b>reporting</b> agency in Chengdu that was established in 2000. This was the first <b>credit</b> <b>reporting</b> agency in Chengdu and one of the earliest in China. Second, we discuss the progress the People’s Bank of China has made in establishing a unified national <b>credit</b> <b>reporting</b> system since 2004. It is clear that China has made much progress in developing a <b>credit</b> <b>reporting</b> system, already operating the largest <b>credit</b> <b>reporting</b> database in the world.
