500|$|On 15 July 2015, he {{was found}} guilty of being an {{accessory}} to the murder of at least 300,000 Jews. Reacting to the sentence, Auschwitz survivor Eva Mozes Kor said that she was [...] "disappointed" [...] adding: [...] "They are trying to teach a lesson that if <b>you</b> <b>commit</b> such a crime, you will be punished. But I do not think the court has acted properly in sentencing him to four years in jail. It is too late for that kind of sentence... My preference would have been to sentence him to community service by speaking out against neo-Nazis. I would like the court to prove to me, a survivor, how four years in jail will benefit anybody." [...] Gröning's defence lawyer, Hans Holtermann, was quoted as saying that he would review the verdict before deciding whether to appeal. On 28 November 2016, the appeal was declined by the German Federal Court of Justice (BGH). In August 2017 Oskar Gröning was considered to be fit for prison.|$|E
500|$|Downey {{acknowledged}} the potential controversy over his role: [...] "At {{the end of}} the day, it's always about how well <b>you</b> <b>commit</b> to the character. If I didn't feel it was morally sound, or that it would be easily misinterpreted that I'm just C. Thomas Howell , I would've stayed home." [...] Jackson stated: [...] "When I first read the script, I was like: What? Blackface? But when I saw him [...] he, like, became a black man ...It was just good acting. It was weird on the set because he would keep going with the character. He's a method actor." [...] Stiller commented on Downey's portrayal of a white actor playing a black man: [...] "When people see the movie— {{in the context of the}} film, he's playing a method actor who's gone to great lengths to play a black guy. The movie is skewering actors and how they take themselves so seriously." [...] Stiller previewed the film before the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and several black journalists reacted positively to the character.|$|E
500|$|The game's dark nihilistic {{tone and}} violent nature was {{singled out by}} many critics as {{representing}} something unique {{in the world of}} video gaming. GameSpot concluded that, [...] "like it or not, the game pushes the envelope of video game violence and shows you countless scenes of wholly uncensored, heavily stylized carnage". Game Informer praised the game's audacity and competent technical capabilities, stating [...] "it's a frightening premise that places gamers in a psychological impasse. The crimes that <b>you</b> <b>commit</b> are unspeakable, yet the gameplay that leads to these horrendous acts is so polished and fierce that it's thrilling." [...] IGN complimented the game's overall challenge, calling it a [...] "solid, deep experience for seasoned gamers pining for some hardcore, challenging games". Watchmojo listed the game at #6 in its [...] "Top 10 Rockstar Games", calling it the publisher's [...] "most controversial game to date" [...] while adding that [...] "if you've got the stomach for it, the tense stealth experience is really exhilarating from start to finish".|$|E

Once you {{establish}} that they are believers, you shall not return them to the disbelievers. They are not lawful to remain married to them, nor shall the disbelievers be allowed to marry them. Give back the dowries that the disbelievers have paid. <b>You</b> <b>commit</b> no error by marrying them, {{so long as you}} pay them their due dowries.

2500|$|He {{then turns}} {{to the subject of}} morality, {{maintaining}} that we do not need religion to be good. Instead, our morality has a Darwinian explanation: altruistic genes, selected through the process of evolution, give people natural empathy. He asks, [...] "would <b>you</b> <b>commit</b> murder, rape or robbery if you knew that no God existed?" [...] He argues that very few people would answer [...] "yes", undermining the claim that religion is needed to make us behave morally. In support of this view, he surveys the history of morality, arguing that there is a moral Zeitgeist that continually evolves in society, generally progressing toward liberalism. As it progresses, this moral consensus influences how religious leaders interpret their holy writings. Thus, Dawkins states, morality does not originate from the Bible, rather our moral progress informs what part of the Bible Christians accept and what they now dismiss.|$|E

2500|$|Surah 27:54-58 {{refers to}} the {{punishment}} that befell the people of Lut: [...] "And (remember) Lut when {{he said to his}} people, 'Do <b>you</b> <b>commit</b> al-Fahishah (evil, great sin, every kind of unlawful sexual intercourse, sodomy) while you see (one another doing evil without any screen) Do you practice your lusts on men instead of women? Nay, but you are a people who behave senselessly.' There was no other answer given by his people except that they said: 'Drive out the family of Loot from your city. Verily, these are men who want to be clean and pure!' So We saved him and his family, except his wife. We destined her to be of those who remained behind. And We rained down on them a rain (of stones). So evil was the rain of those who were warned." [...] Muhammad has also thus said: [...] "Whoever of you finds (someone) doing the deed of the people of Lot, kill the one who does it and the one to whom it is done." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the Orthodox Church {{there are}} no [...] "categories" [...] of sin as found in the Christian West. In the pre-Vatican II Catholic catechism, sins were {{categorized}} as [...] "mortal" [...] and [...] "venial." [...] In this definition, a [...] "mortal" [...] sin was one which would prevent someone from entering heaven unless one confessed it before death... These categories do {{not exist in the}} Orthodox Church. Sin is sin. Concerning Confession, having a list of deadly sins could, in fact, become an obstacle to genuine repentance. For example, imagine that <b>you</b> <b>commit</b> a sin. You look on the list and do not find it listed. It would be very easy to take the attitude that, since it is not on a list of deadly sins, it is not too serious. Hence, you do not feel the need to seek God's forgiveness right away. A week passes and you have completely forgotten about what you had done. You never sought God's forgiveness; as a result, you did not receive it, either. We should go to Confession when we sin—at the very least, we should ask God to forgive us daily in our personal prayers. We should not see Confession as a time to confess only those sins which may be found on a list.|$|E
