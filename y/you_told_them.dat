"The Carolina {{fans that}} week were {{carrying}} around a poster {{with the image}} of a tiger with a gamecock standing on top of it, holding the tiger's tail as if he was steering the tiger by the tail," [...] Jay McCormick said. [...] "Naturally, the Clemson guys didn't take too kindly to that, and on Wednesday and again on Thursday, there were sporadic fistfights involving brass knuckles and other objects and so forth, some of which resulted, according to the newspapers, in blood being spilled and persons having to seek medical assistance. [...] After the game on Thursday, the Clemson guys frankly told the Carolina students that if you bring this poster, which is insulting to us, to the big parade on Friday, you're going to be in trouble. And naturally, of course, the Carolina students brought the poster to the parade. If you give someone an ultimatum and they are your rival, they're going to do exactly what <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> not to do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Nonsense,' said Rupert; 'do {{you think}} that if anyone read its history, they would learn any such lesson unless <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> beforehand?' ...|$|E
60|$|MINNIE (her eyes {{falling on}} the {{travelling}} pillow and the pincushion; picking theron: up in turn). I guess <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> that, too.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, but we're {{a scratch}} lot. Have <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>'em</b> we shall need a {{substitute}} even if Crandall can play?" [...] said a Lieutenant of Engineers with a D.S.O. to his credit.|$|R
6000|$|Has it ever {{occurred}} to you that one object of reading is to learn things you never thought of before, and would never think of now, unless <b>you</b> were <b>told</b> <b>them?</b> ...|$|R
60|$|McCOMAS. Remember: I've {{not given}} <b>you</b> away. I've <b>told</b> <b>them</b> {{it was all}} their fault.|$|R
6000|$|... 'They knew of it?' cried Eustacie, {{sitting up}} suddenly. 'Then <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>them.</b> Go--go; let me never see you more! You {{have been his}} death!' ...|$|E
60|$|PHOEBE (sadly). I think I understand. I am afraid, Sergeant, you do {{not tell}} those poor young men the noble things I thought <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'That {{is being}} against me. A woman {{should be with}} her husband. <b>You</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> to do this. And they have nearly killed me,--me and my baby.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'I will myself {{send for}} him,' he said, 'and {{thank him for}} having {{defeated}} this disgraceful plot of the Vicomte de Tulle. I suppose you are quite sure of all the circumstances, as <b>you</b> have <b>told</b> <b>them</b> to me?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>you</b> had <b>told</b> <b>them</b> we were going, dear," [...] said Mrs. March, {{when the}} couple were {{themselves}} gone, [...] "we should have been as old as ever. Don't let us tell anybody, this morning, that we're going. I couldn't bear it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'I see,' the {{stranger}} might say by this time, 'that {{there is a}} great difference among these boys; have <b>you</b> <b>told</b> me about <b>them</b> all?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Perhaps <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> {{that you}} would return with the Fitz-pompeys, but they are gone; or Mrs. Aberleigh, {{and she is not}} here; or perhaps--but they have gone too. Everyone has gone.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{would do}} for a man, and in that I {{respected}} Captain Dornton's convictions, as <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> to me. But for a girl, how could she be independent, except with money?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{would have}} done no good;--and your going there has done good. It has opened your eyes {{to more than one}} thing, I don't doubt. But tell me,--have <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> in Norfolk that you were coming here?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear me! Won't {{the truth}} do, then? I hoped <b>you</b> could have <b>told</b> <b>them</b> {{something}} consoling. I {{am thinking of}} the poor mother now. Your Russia is a cruel country." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Plain, indeed," [...] Penelope assented, and {{she spoke}} in a low tone because there was fear in her heart. [...] "Why have <b>you</b> <b>told</b> me about <b>them?</b> They throw a new light upon everything,--an awful light!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bingley! We {{shall have}} to go back by the next boat, dear. People are {{beginning}} to wonder where <b>you</b> are. I've <b>told</b> <b>them</b> that <b>you</b> are taking a rest in the country. But they will suspect something if you don't come back at once." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That was {{a severe}} {{broadside}} you poured into him, Lindsay. I {{could see that}} they were absolutely flabbergasted, when <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> about Mysore. Their manner, before that, had been almost insolent. But you cut their comb finely." ...|$|E
60|$|THE CLERK. What did you expect? <b>You</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> our gallant fellows {{is falling}} {{at the rate}} of a {{thousand}} a day in the big push. Dying for Little Pifflington, you says. Come and take their places, you says. That ain't the way to recruit.|$|E
6000|$|Breckenridge {{straightened}} {{himself and}} looked at Torrance with a little flash in his eye. [...] "You must take my word--I shall not substantiate it. If you had had an army corps of cut-throats ready to do what <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> that night, Larry would have gone alone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look in, by all means," [...] {{said the}} man. [...] "No doubt {{you will find}} that drunken booby as wrong in what he <b>told</b> <b>you</b> about <b>them</b> as he is about {{everything}} else." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{two young}} men in a gig, ma'am, {{who want to see}} the house--yes, and if <b>you</b> please, I <b>told</b> <b>them</b> so!" [...] in quick reply to a gesture of dissent from the housekeeper. [...] "I went to the hall-door and <b>told</b> <b>them</b> it was the wrong day and the wrong hour, but the young man who was driving took off his hat in the wet and begged me to bring this card to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{may seem}} strange to you, sir," [...] {{returned}} Gridley; [...] "I {{should not have}} liked to see you {{if this had been}} the first time of our meeting. But you know I made a fight for it, you know I stood up with my single hand against them all, <b>you</b> know I <b>told</b> <b>them</b> the truth to the last, and <b>told</b> <b>them</b> what they were, and what they had done to me; so I don't mind your seeing me, this wreck." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Yes,” said Nettie quietly. “I {{heard what}} <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>them.</b> They {{deserved}} it, {{and you did}} it very well. Now, I’ve been talking about nothing for most of two hours, and this place seems nice and quiet. You don’t mind my sitting here with you a little?” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was very}} wise of you," [...] Sabatini said. [...] "It {{might have led}} to disappointments--to trouble of many sorts. So <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> nothing, eh? That is excellent. After we have landed, I must hand you over to my valet. Then {{we will have a}} little talk." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Only this," [...] {{she replied}} {{in a voice}} of unnatural calm. [...] "Your murderers whom you set on {{in the name of}} law and justice have made a mistake. <b>You</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> to murder Allan Quatermain for reasons of your own. Well, they have murdered his wife instead." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank <b>you,</b> miss. I <b>told</b> <b>them</b> you'd {{be willing}} they should come sometimes. They like this place ever so much, {{and so do}} I," [...] said Ben, feeling that few spots {{combined}} so many advantages {{in the way of}} climbable trees, arched gates, half-a-dozen gables, and other charms suited to the taste of an aspiring youth who had been a flying Cupid at the age of seven.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear {{life and}} heart!" [...] exclaimed Mrs. Emory, pausing {{in the act}} of {{scalding}} a milk-can when Murray emerged from a side door. [...] "What on earth is the matter, Mr. Murray? You ain't sick now, surely? I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>them</b> pond fogs was p'isen after night! If you've gone and got--" ...|$|R
5000|$|This issue {{also became}} a topic of {{discussion}} during some of Bremer's Q&A sessions with students who attended Bremer's presentations during Bremer's campus speaking tours. Some questioned Bremer {{if he could have}} done things differently in Iraq, but were notably disappointed when he avoided the question. Bremer allegedly responded to one such question with, [...] "I will tell <b>you</b> what I <b>told</b> <b>them,</b> I'm saving that for my book...I need more time to reflect".|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, do {{you suppose}} if I'd known where that first visit of ours to Waterlow {{was going to bring}} you out I'd have taken you within fifty miles--?" [...] He stopped suddenly; then in another tone: [...] "Jerusalem, there's no one like you! And <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> it was all YOU?" ...|$|E
6000|$|BURKE--[Thoroughly exasperated.] Is it {{no shame}} {{you have at}} all? I'm a fool to be wasting talk on you and you {{hardened}} in badness. I'll go out of this and lave you alone forever. [He starts for the door--then stops to turn on her furiously] And I suppose 'tis the same lies <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> all before that you told to me? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You--you {{were the}} drummer boy, I remember, and {{strutted}} {{in front of}} the regiment as if you were the colonel. Egad, I remember how you fooled the Kaskaskians when <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> we were going away." [...] He looked at me, but his eyes were still fixed on the point beyond. [...] "You were always older than I, Davy. Are you married?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I heard {{last night}} of the {{expected}} passengers," [...] pursued Jim, [...] "and am now rigging up tackle to hoist 'em on board. I meant to have <b>told</b> <b>you</b> of <b>'em</b> last night, but we got into that stiff argument about teetotalism, which put it completely out of my head." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So they did. But {{as soon as}} Gilbert {{heard that}} you had applied for it he went to them--they had a {{business}} meeting at the school last night, <b>you</b> know--and <b>told</b> <b>them</b> that he withdrew his application, and suggested that they accept yours. He {{said he was going}} to teach at White Sands. Of course he knew how much you wanted to stay with Marilla, and I must say I think it was real kind and thoughtful in him, that's what. Real self-sacrificing, too, for he'll have his board to pay at White Sands, and everybody knows he's got to earn his own way through college. So the trustees decided to take you. I was tickled to death when Thomas came home and told me." ...|$|R
6000|$|REV. S. [piteously] Frank, my boy: when I wrote {{those letters}} I put myself into that woman's power. When I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> about <b>them</b> I put myself, to some extent, I {{am sorry to}} say, in your power. She refused my money with these words, which I shall never forget. [...] "Knowledge is power" [...] she said; [...] "and I never sell power." ...|$|R
