5000|$|Whereas {{in other}} paper {{productions}} {{a series of}} drying cylinders is used, in tissue production only one cylinder (the <b>yankee</b> <b>cylinder)</b> dries the paper. This {{is due to the}} necessity of creping and made possible by the low grammage (gsm = gram per square meter) of the paper sheet for tissue products, which is in the range of 14-45 gsm. For the production of the higher gsm in this range, some machines are nevertheless provided with some (4-10) drying cylinders after the yankee. In this case one speaks of [...] "wet creping", as the creping of the paper done on the yankee is not made on the fully dried paper and the completement of drying is accomplished after the <b>yankee</b> <b>cylinder.</b>|$|E
50|$|In September 2008, Metso sold 83% of its foundry in Sweden to an {{investment}} group assembled by the Primaca investment company. The Metso Foundries Karlstad unit specialized in casts of wind power components, diesel engine blocks and <b>Yankee</b> <b>cylinders</b> for paper machines.|$|R
50|$|<b>Yankee</b> <b>cylinders</b> are {{traditionally}} made {{of cast iron}} and have diamaters up to 6 m, therefore much higher than conventional drying cylinders. The width is a bit larger {{than that of the}} paper: typical for tissue are paper machine widths 1,74m 2,32m and 2,70m and their multiples (usually nowadays the doubles of these values are typical). Therefore yankees are very heavy (~100t) and difficult to cast.Since a couple of decades the production of yankees made of steel is gaining market and new machines are practically always nowadays equipped with a steel yankee, which is much lighter, easier to produce and to transport.|$|R

50|$|Paper that is creped is {{produced}} {{on a paper}} machine that has a single large steam-heated drying cylinder (yankee) fitted with a hot-air hood. The raw material is paper pulp. The <b>Yankee</b> <b>cylinder</b> is sprayed with adhesives to make the paper stick. Crêping {{is done by the}} Yankee's doctor blade that is scraping the dry paper off the cylinder surface. The crinkle (crêping) is controlled by the strength of the adhesive, geometry of the doctor blade, speed difference between the yankee and final section of the paper machine and paper pulp characteristics.|$|E
50|$|A Yankee dryer is a {{pressure}} vessel {{used in the}} production of tissue paper. On the Yankee dryer, the paper goes from approximately 42-45% dryness to just over 89% dryness. In industry, MG cylinders or Yankee dryers are primarily used to remove excess moisture from pulp that is about to be converted into paper. The <b>Yankee</b> <b>cylinder</b> can be equipped with a doctor blade and sprayed with adhesives to make the paper stick. Creping is done by the Yankee's doctor blade that is scraping the dry paper off the cylinder surface thereby crêping the paper. The crinkle (crêping) is controlled by the strength of the adhesive, geometry of the doctor blade, speed difference between the yankee and final section of the paper machine and paper pulp characteristics.|$|E
40|$|The <b>Yankee</b> <b>cylinder</b> {{is used in}} most of Metso Paper's machines. It is used in {{the drying}} and creping process. Since the outcome of these {{processes}} largely affect the paper's final quality {{it is important that the}} <b>Yankee</b> <b>cylinder</b> behaves in a controlled fashion. One important parameter affecting the behaviour of the <b>Yankee</b> <b>cylinder</b> is its surface temperature. The objective of this thesis was to search for and evaluate methods for measuring the surface temperature of a <b>Yankee</b> <b>cylinder</b> during operation. Metso Paper is looking for a method having an accuracy of ΔT = 1 °C, a response time of t 300 °C, making this method unsuitable for measuring the surface temperature of the <b>Yankee</b> <b>cylinder.</b> Gold cup pyrometers require the gold hemisphere to have a reflectance of ρ= 1. Because of the environment surrounding the <b>Yankee</b> <b>cylinder</b> it would be difficult keeping the gold hemisphere as clean as required making this method unsuitable as well...|$|E
40|$|Valmets own foundry in Karlstad has {{during a}} long period of time had {{problems}} being profitable. The goal today is to turn this around. Today there are three different productionlines; engine blocks, Yankeecylinders and components for the wind turbine industry. This master thesis has focused on examining if value stream mapping is a useful tool to use in a foundry, and therefore outside the typical manufacturing industry. The target has also been to evaluate if there is a possibility to improve the flow in the foundry and also the results. During the 20 weeks this work has been done at the foundry data has been collected and analyzed. It has been possible to confirm irregularities in the production at several places. Due to limited time the focus of this theses has been at three different areas: The sand core manufacturing, the forming of concrete for <b>Yankee</b> <b>cylinders</b> and also the molds for the castings of engine blocks. Together with the measured times and values a new proposition of the sand core manufacturing has been developed. There has also been a request in examining the possibilities of changing from three shifts to two shifts at the sand core manufacturing. This has been examined and economical calculations has been made. Simulations have been done in a program called Flexsim. The Flexsim model was a simplification of the real situation which therefore affects the reliability of the result. To continue improving the model is something that is recommended for future thesises. As a complement to the simulations made in Flexim manually simulations was made too, to examine the possibilities of reducing the number of shifts from three to two. The result was clear, it was possible to go down to two shifts. It would though cost approximately 800. 000 kr more per year. But with this investment it is possible to produce 5 motor blocks a week steadily for a long time which helps with the payoff of the investment. Every sold motor block results in a profit of approximately 150. 000 kr. It was also found that it is problematic to make use of value stream mapping in a process that is large, contains a large number of sub-steps and also is very irregular. However, the value flow analysis could be used as a complement to the other simulations. For the production of <b>Yankee</b> <b>cylinders,</b> it was decided that the focus should be on the introduction of a new cement mixer that Valmet bought into. The problem has been how it will be able to reach all three pits, as these are large and extends over a large area. After discussion, it was decided to proceed with a concept that means that the entire cement mixer will be mobile. Valmet themselves then took the decision that the results shall be recorded and then transferred to Valmet since the introduction of the mixer extends too big for this thesis. In summary, it has been noted that there are a lot of things to do. The foundry is in great need of improvements in productivity, standardization, 5 S and so on, and there is a huge potential in the future to improve profitability. Even outside the three areas that this thesis has focused on...|$|R
40|$|In {{production}} of tissue paper, the adhesion of a liquid adhesive creping aid, compound polymer, as creping aids on the Yankee dryer surface was investigated. A compound polymer was prepared based on mixing ratio of poly (amideamine) -epichlorohydrin resin (PAE) as an adhesive agent, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as a modifier agent, and cationic fatty acid (CFA) and ethylene glycol (EG) as release agents. In order {{to simulate the}} <b>Yankee</b> dryer <b>cylinder,</b> the adherence of paper to the substrate that was coated by the compound polymer solution was measured using a peel strength test. Results indicated that increasing the percent of total solid content of compound polymer would increase peel strength of paper. Peel strength of paper increases if EG as a release agent is used. The amount of PVA/PAE resin {{in the formulation of}} creping aid was critical for building a flexible and tough coating layer on to the substrate and to provide adequate adhesion of paper in peel strength test...|$|R
40|$|The {{strength}} of the adhesion between the paper and the drying <b>Yankee</b> <b>cylinder</b> is of great importance {{with respect to the}} final properties of a tissue paper product. Therefore, the effects of a few potentially important pulp properties have been evaluated in laboratory experiments. Four highly different kraft pulps were used, and the adhesion strength was measured by means of the force required when scraping off a paper from a metal surface with a specifically designed knife mounted on a moving cart. The adhesion strength was observed to increase with increasing grammage and increasing degree of beating of the pulp. It was also found that pulpscontainingmore fines, or with higher hemicellulose content, gave rise to higher adhesion strength...|$|E
40|$|This thesis have {{investigated}} a few materials that exhibits non-stick properties for applications in tissue machines. In {{the process of}} making tissue there is problems with build up of fibres and glue. To overcome these problems Valmet AB are looking to find coatings that will facilitate cleaning. The main problem area is the drying section where glue is used to help the sheet to stick to the steam filled <b>Yankee</b> <b>cylinder</b> which is performing the final drying of the sheet. A basic discussion of the theory behind surface properties is made before the materials are chosen, experiments are conducted and results presented. The materials are ranked in order of performance based on the experimental data. To ensure that the top performing materials can be applied to usage in a real tissue machines a few possible future studies is suggested. The top performing materials were fluoropolymers. These materials are very expensive which making their usage limited to critical parts. Two silicon based materials performed at a surprisingly high level making them highly attractive for wider usage in less critical areas in a tissue machine...|$|E
40|$|The creping {{process and}} the {{conditions}} on the <b>Yankee</b> <b>cylinder</b> are the key factors in the production process. They need to be kept under good control {{in order to maintain}} a high and uniform quality. A natural coating always develops {{on the surface of the}} <b>Yankee</b> <b>cylinder</b> due to evaporation from dissolved and dispersed substances and to fiber fragments that remain on the surface after creping. Nevertheless, coating chemicals are sprayed onto the Yankee surface in order to modify the adhesion between the paper and the dryer cylinder. To be able to control the process, on-line measurements of coating thickness as well as of the crepe structure of the tissue paper produced would be very valuable. In the work described in this thesis, the coating layer was analyzed chemically and morphologically to provide information about the coating layer before starting any on-line measurements. The chemicals added and the constituents of the pulps are known to the paper producers, but what is left on the cylinder and whether there are different layers of coating still remain to be investigated. The chemical analysis indicated that the adhesive content was higher in an inner layer of the coating than in the outer layer. The relative amount of polyamide-amine resin calculated on the basis of the nominal nitrogen content in the resin was low indicating that the coating consisted of a significant amount of carbohydrates or other substances. The coating layer could not be considered transparent. It was observed that the coating was thick and appeared patch-wise and that it contained fiber fragments. Measurements on a laboratory scale, to further be applied on-line on the tissue machine, have been investigated and evaluated in this study. The thickness of the coating layer on a laboratory dryer has been measured. The method was based on fluorescence with an optical brightener added to the coating chemicals sprayed on the Yankee dryer. With a UV-LED (Ultra Violet - Light Emitting Diode) the coating layer was exposed to UV-light and the intensity of the light emitted by the optical brightener in the layer was measured. The intensity in the trials with different thickness of the coating and no coating was scattered and no trend could be seen between the different trial points. Attempts were made to measure the wavelength of the tissue paper produced with an optical fiber perpendicular to and at an angle to the paper surface. The paper was travelling in a slow speed while the measurements were made. The collected signal to noise ratio was low and it was not possible to detect any representative characteristic wavelength of the tissue...|$|E
40|$|The creping {{process and}} the {{conditions}} on the <b>Yankee</b> <b>cylinder</b> dryer are key factors in a tissue paper mill, and they therefore need to be kept under good control {{in order to maintain}} a high and uniform quality. To this end it would be valuable {{to be able to make}} on-line measurements of Yankee coating thickness as well as the crepe structure of the tissue paper. The adhesion of paper to the cylinder affects the creping process and more information about the parameters that affect the adhesion is therefore of interest. To perform trials on a full scale or in a pilot plant is very costly and laboratory creping equipment is therefore sought after in order to be able to measure the adhesion force. The coating layer for use on the cylinder was analysed. It contained a large amount of carbohydrates and could not be considered transparent. The thickness of the coating layer was measured on a laboratory cylinder with a method based on fluorescence. An optical brightener was added to the coating chemicals and the coating layer was subjected to UV-radiation. The intensity of the light emitted by the optical brightener was measured and gave an indication of the thickness of the coating layer. The equipment has to be further investigated before it is possible to implement the new sensor on-line. New creping equipment and an adhesion method were developed for use on a laboratory scale. The equipment can operate with different creping angles and the force needed to crepe the paper can be measured. The highest creping force was obtained for papers of high grammage, low dryness at adhesion, high drainability, high fines content and high hemicellulose content. A more direct method is to analyse the structure of the produced paper. Measurements were made on a tissue paper with an optical fibre sensor while the paper was travelling at low speed. The collected signal was mathematically analysed and the characteristic wavelength was calculated for different paper samples. These values were close to the wavelengths measured with an off line method by a commercial crepe analyser. Baksidestext The creping process is the heart of tissue paper manufacture. To control the process better, on-line measurements of paper structure and coating thickness are sought after. The creping is highly dependent on the adhesion of the paper to the Yankee dryer. To be able to measure the adhesion, laboratory creping equipment was also required. Different pulp parameters affect the adhesion and some of them have been investigated in this work. The coating on the <b>Yankee</b> <b>cylinder</b> consisted mainly of fiber fragments and could not be considered as transparent, which had to be considered when choosing a method to measure coating thickness. A method based on the light emitted from an optical brightener in the coating when subjected to UV-irradiation was used, but has to be further improved before it can be used on-line. A new laboratory creping method was developed to determine the adhesion between paper and metal, and the force needed to scrape off the paper with a doctor blade was measured. The highest creping force was obtained for papers made of pulp with a high drainability, high fines content and high hemicellulose content. An optical method using reflected light to measure crepe wavelength on-line was developed. The paper travelled under a sensor and the light collected was mathematically analyzed to determine the most common wavelength...|$|E
40|$|This report {{contains}} {{the development and}} {{construction of a new}} patented doctor blade. A doctor blade is used when creping soft paper from a large rotating <b>Yankee</b> <b>cylinder.</b> At the current state the doctor blade are in use for four to six hours before it needs to be switch due to wearing, stopping the production of soft paper. The new idea is to have a very long and small blade that will slide into a fixed blade and be continuously pulled when creping paper. The company CS Production had a concept of the fixed blade but wanted to further develop it since the blade was too wide.   Measurements where done with the old blade and with the old testing device to measure the pull force required to pull the blade. New concepts where made by the method of brainstorming and evaluated with an elimination matrix. Rivet joints where selected as the joining technique for the new design. The new concept contains one dominant blade that smaller parts were assembled to form the final blade. The material selected for the dominant blade and the section blade was a cold rolled stainless spring steel strip and for the middle disc the material was aluminum bronze string casted. Test on the pull force required where done with the new doctor blade in the new test rig.  FEM simulation where done on {{a small part of the}} blade to see where stresses are occurring in the blade. The FEM result showed that no stresses where on the middle discs, rivets or section blades. This is not reliable results because the small doctor blade is pushing down onto the middle discs and stresses should be occurring on the discs.  Further testing is needed to see if the blade can withstand the forces applied to it...|$|E
40|$|In a {{world where}} global warming and {{environmental}} issues are becoming more relevant questions {{regarding the use of}} energy are becoming more important. Metso Paper Karlstad and Metsä Tissue are among many companies striving towards increasing the energy efficiency of their tissue paper machines. This was the objective of this Master’s Thesis; to perform an energy study with the tool named pinch analysis to investigate potential energy efficiency improvements of tissue paper machines. Pinch analysis indentifies potential reduction in external hot and cold utilities and also the potential in increased energy efficiency through process integration. The study was performed on an existing mill; Katrinefors mill, a computer simulated machine including only the Yankee hood and also the same computer simulated Yankee hood in a scaled model of the Katrinefors mill. A separate pinch analysis was performed on the three machines. The results showed potential reduction in utilities for all three machines; 17 % for the Katrinefors mill, 21, 5 % for the computer simulated Yankee hood and 21 % for the computer simulated Yankee hood in a scaled model of the Katrinefors mill. In this work retrofits are also proposed which presents alternatives on how to reduce the utility demand. Other indications, not originating directly from the pinch analysis were also taken into consideration in the retrofit that can contribute to a reduced utility demand. These were mainly potential process integration possibilities which implied integrations that would increase the energy efficiency of the machine. Two possibilities were visible and the most important one, which was present for all three machines, implied that parts of the steam used inside the <b>Yankee</b> <b>cylinder</b> could be generated with the moist air extracted from the Yankee hood. Further cooling and condensing the moist air contributed to the increased energy efficiency since the heat available was utilised to a greater extent. For the suggested retrofits the amount of energy saved for the Katrinefors mill is 182 kWh per tonne tissue paper, 270 for the Yankee hood and the same number for the computer simulated Yankee hood in a scaled model of the Katrinefors mill. There are two main benefits for the suggested retrofit; first and foremost the system would become more energy efficient since the energy available would be utilized more effectively through further condensation and cooling of the moist air. Secondly the demand for hot utilities would be decreased as part of the steam could potentially be generated by the moist air stream...|$|E
