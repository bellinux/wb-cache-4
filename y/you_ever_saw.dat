500|$|Waterloo was {{the decisive}} {{engagement}} of the Waterloo Campaign and Napoleon's last. According to Wellington, {{the battle was}} [...] "the nearest-run thing <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>saw</b> in your life". Napoleon abdicated four days later, and on 7 July coalition forces entered Paris. The defeat at Waterloo ended Napoleon's rule as Emperor of the French, and {{marked the end of}} his Hundred Days return from exile. This ended the First French Empire, and set a chronological milestone between serial European wars and decades of relative peace.|$|E
500|$|Joe Leydon from Variety {{found the}} film's plot {{predictable}} and slow-paced, but noted [...] "the trip itself is never less than pleasant, and often extremely funny". The New York Times Stephen Holden described Chef as [...] "aggressively feel-good" [...] and [...] "shallow but enjoyable". Michael O'Sullivan of The Washington Post gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars {{and found it}} [...] "deeply satisfying, down to the soul", praising the [...] "incredible" [...] food photography, the [...] "colorful supporting cast" [...] and the [...] "wryly observant" [...] humor, raving, [...] "There's nothing terribly profound about [...] "Chef". But its messagethat relationships, like cooking, take a hands-on approachis a sweet and sustaining one." [...] San Francisco Chronicle film critic Mick LaSalle opined that Chef was Favreau's best film to date, highlighting the [...] "natural and convincing" [...] chemistry between Favreau and Anthony and the [...] "vivid" [...] scenes featuring big-name actors in small roles. USA Today Scott Bowles gave Chef 3.5 out of 4 stars and called it [...] "a nuanced side dish, a slow-cooked film that's {{one of the most}} heartwarming of the young year". Ken Choy of Wide Lantern noted the structural problems but admitted, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>saw</b> the Kristen Bell sloth video on Ellen, that was me during the entire 2nd half of the movie. Non-stop tears. It was happy-crying because Favreau's character was doing what he wanted." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ingres's own {{paintings}} {{vary considerably}} {{in their use}} of colour, and critics were apt to fault them as too grey or, contrarily, too jarring. Baudelaire—who said [...] "M. Ingres adores colour like a fashionable milliner"—wrote of the portraits of Louis-François Bertin and Madame d'Haussonville: [...] "Open your eyes, [...] nation of simpletons, and tell us if <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>saw</b> such dazzling, eye-catching painting, or even a greater elaboration of colour". Ingres's paintings are often characterized by strong local colours, such as the [...] "acid blues and bottle greens" [...] Kenneth Clark professed to [...] "perversely enjoy" [...] in La Grande Odalisque. In other works, especially in his less formal portraits such as the Mademoiselle Jeanne-Suzanne-Catherine Gonin (1821), colour is restrained.|$|E

2500|$|Within Indiana Reformatory and Indiana State Prison, from 1924 to 1933, Dillinger {{began to}} become {{embroiled in a}} {{criminal}} lifestyle. Upon being admitted to the prison, he is quoted as saying, [...] "I will be the meanest bastard <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>saw</b> when I get out of here." [...] His physical examination upon being admitted to the prison showed that he had gonorrhea. The treatment for his condition was extremely painful. He became embittered against society because of his long prison sentence and befriended other criminals, such as seasoned bank robbers like Harry [...] "Pete" [...] Pierpont, Charles Makley, Russell Clark, and Homer Van Meter, who taught Dillinger {{how to be a}} successful criminal. The men planned heists that they would commit soon after they were released. Dillinger studied Herman Lamm's meticulous bank-robbing system and used it extensively throughout his criminal career.|$|E
2500|$|Jay Ellis elaborates on Chigurh's {{encounter}} with {{the man behind the}} counter at the gas station. [...] "Where McCarthy gives us Chigurh's question as, 'What's the most <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>saw</b> lost on a coin toss?', he says, 'the film elides the word 'saw', but the Coens of course tend to the visual. Where the book describes the setting as 'almost dark', the film clearly depicts high noon: no shadows are notable in the establishing shot of the gas station, and the sunlight is bright even if behind cloud cover. The light through two windows and a door comes evenly through three walls in the interior shots. But this difference increases our sense of the man's desperation later, when he claims he needs to close and he closes at 'near dark'; it is darker, as it were, in the cave of this man's ignorance than it is outside in the bright light of truth." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{conservative}} {{contributor to}} Ain't it Cool News said the film featured [...] "ingenious comedy that we remember from Airplane!" [...] and was [...] "funny and inventive." [...] Kathleen Parker of Washington Post Writers Group described {{the film as}} [...] " [...] The Best Movie <b>You</b> <b>Ever</b> <b>Saw,</b> but it’s something. It’s radical in its assault on the left wing; it’s brave given the risk of peer ridicule {{and the potential for}} career suicide. And it’s funny — if you like that sort of thing. Generally, I don’t." [...] Michael Brendan Doherty of The American Conservative considered the movie to be funny [...] "in parts", but concluded that [...] "Far from lampooning the Left, “Carol” insults conservatives by presuming that they are so simple as to be won over by fat jokes and flatulence. But the audience, imagining itself to be persecuted by Hollywood, is so grateful to be flattered by Zucker and company that they chuckle obediently at every cheap laff." [...] Steven Rea of The Philadelphia Inquirer gave the movie one star out of five, called it [...] "jaw-droppingly awful," [...] and [...] "about as not-funny as a comedy can get." [...] Lou Lumenick of the New York Post wrote, [...] "Even if it weren't three years too late to parody Moore (ineptly played by Kevin Farley), Moore's ridiculous tribute to Cuban health care in Sicko is far funnier than anything in this desperately laughless farce from David Zucker." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{had begun}} to despair of meeting old Moodie, when, all at once, I {{recognized}} his hand and arm protruding from behind a screen that was {{set up for the}} accommodation of bashful topers.
