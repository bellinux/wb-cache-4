2500|$|Rav Nahman bar Isaac {{derived from}} the words [...] "if not, blot me, I pray, out of <b>Your</b> <b>book</b> <b>that</b> You have written" [...] in [...] that three books are opened in heaven on Rosh Hashanah. Rav Kruspedai said {{in the name of}} Rabbi Johanan that on Rosh Hashanah, three books are opened in Heaven – one for the {{thoroughly}} wicked, one for the thoroughly righteous, and one for those in between. The thoroughly righteous are immediately inscribed definitively in the book of life. The thoroughly wicked are immediately inscribed definitively in the book of death. And the fate of those in between is suspended from Rosh Hashanah to Yom Kippur. If they deserve well, then they are inscribed in the book of life; if they do not deserve well, then they are inscribed in the book of death. Rabbi Abin said that [...] tells us this when it says, [...] "Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous." [...] "Let them be blotted out from the book" [...] refers to the book of the wicked. [...] "Of the living" [...] refers to the book of the righteous. [...] "And not be written with the righteous" [...] refers to the book of those in between. Rav Nahman bar Isaac derived this from [...] where Moses told God, [...] "if not, blot me, I pray, out of <b>Your</b> <b>book</b> <b>that</b> You have written." [...] "Blot me, I pray" [...] refers to the book of the wicked. [...] "Out of Your book" [...] refers to the book of the righteous. [...] "That you have written" [...] refers to the book of those in between. It was taught in a Baraita that the House of Shammai said that there will be three groups at the Day of Judgment – one of thoroughly righteous, one of thoroughly wicked, and one of those in between. The thoroughly righteous will immediately be inscribed definitively as entitled to everlasting life; the thoroughly wicked will immediately be inscribed definitively as doomed to Gehinnom, as [...] says, [...] "And many of them who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life and some to reproaches and everlasting abhorrence." [...] Those in between will go down to Gehinnom and scream and rise again, as [...] says, [...] "And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried. They shall call on My name and I will answer them." [...] Of them, Hannah said in [...] "The Lord kills and makes alive, He brings down to the grave and brings up." [...] The House of Hillel, however, taught that God inclines the scales towards grace (so that those in between do not have to descend to Gehinnom), and of them David said in [...] "I love that the Lord should hear my voice and my supplication [...] [...] [...] The cords of death compassed me, and the straits of the netherworld got hold upon me," [...] and on their behalf David composed the conclusion of [...] "I was brought low and He saved me."–17a1.|$|E

I had such a fright for a moment, not seeing you; for I left my little plush bag with my purse in it at Stearns's, and I've got to hurry right back; though I'm afraid they'll be shut when I get there, Saturday afternoon, this way; but I'm going to rattle at the front door, and perhaps they'll come--they always stay, some of them, to put the goods away; and I can tell them I don't want to buy anything, but I left my bag with my purse in it, and I guess they'll let me in. I want you to keep these things for me, Edward; and I'll leave my shopping-bag; I sha'n't want it any more. Don't lose any of them. Better keep them all in your lap here together, and then nobody will come and sit on them."
