Andre {{concludes that}} the {{original}} sense of otium was related to military service and the idleness {{that happened in the}} winter, as opposed to the business (negotium) {{of the rest of the}} year. The most ancient Roman calendar divided the year into ten months devoted to war and farming, leaving the winter months of January and February vacant for individual otium. Andre shows that the beauty of the individual otium poses rest. Titus Maccius Plautus in his play Mercator says that while you are young is the time to save up for <b>your</b> <b>retirement</b> otium so you can enjoy it later, in his claim tum in otium te conloces, dum potes, ames (then you may set yourself at your ease, drink and be amorous).|$|E

Look at what these people who claim to be running things are doing today, and these are frauds.

60|$|Thus, my lord, {{the morning}} of your life was clear and calm; and, though it was {{afterwards}} overcast, yet, in that general storm, you were never without a shelter. And now you are happily arrived to the evening of a day, as serene as the dawn of it was glorious; but such an evening as, I hope, and almost prophecy, is far from night: 'Tis the evening of a summer's sun, which keeps the day-light long within the skies. The health of your body is maintained by the vigour of your mind: Neither does the one shrink from the fatigue of exercise, nor the other bend under the pains of study. Methinks, I behold in you another Caius Marius, who, in the extremity of his age, exercised himself almost every morning in the Campus Martius, amongst the youthful nobility of Rome. And afterwards in <b>your</b> <b>retirements,</b> when you do honour to poetry, by employing part of your leisure in it, I regard you as another Silius Italicus, who, having passed over his consulship with applause, dismissed himself from business, and from the gown, and employed his age, amongst the shades, in the reading and imitation of Virgil.|$|R

'And this {{occasions}} me {{to congratulate}} myself again,' he pursued, 'on the circumstance that our place has {{had nothing to}} do with <b>your</b> temporary <b>retirement.</b> It very easily might have had a hand in it; because it is undeniable that we are sometimes a most unlucky place, in our effects upon people who will not leave us alone. Mr Clennam, I am quite unreserved with you. As between yourself and myself, I know I may be. I was so, when I first saw you making the mistake of not leaving us alone; because I perceived that you were inexperienced and sanguine, and had--I hope you'll not object to my saying--some simplicity.' ...|$|R

In the morning, {{as soon as you}} are awakened, prepare yourself to meditate on some mystery of our Lord; beginning from his holy nativity, and continuing to his glorious ascension: the subjects of the meditations are marked, and put in order, in the book of Exercises. Employ, at the least, half-an-hour in prayers; and apply yourself to it with all those interior dispositions, which you may remember you practised in <b>your</b> <b>retirement</b> of a month. Consider every day one mystery, in such manner, that if, for example, on Monday, the birth of our Saviour was the subject of your meditation, that of his circumcision shall be for Tuesday, and so in course, till in a month's time, having run through all the actions of Jesus Christ, you come to contemplate him ascending into heaven in triumph. You are every month to begin these meditations again in the same order.|$|E
60|$|This is a {{very faint}} and meagre little word, {{addressed}} to you late of a terrifically windy winter's night by an old friend who doesn't happen[B] to be in very good physical case (only for the moment, thank goodness, probably!) and yet who doesn't want the New Year to edge an hour nearer before he has made you Both--made you all Three--a sign of affectionate remembrance amounting to tenderness pure and simple. I wish there were a benediction I could call down on your house and your associated life in sufficiently immediate and visible form: you would then see it flutter into your midst and perch upon your table even while you read these lines. I have thought of you constantly these past weeks, and have only not written {{to you from the}} fear of appearing to assume that <b>your</b> <b>retirement</b> has been to you woeful or in any degree heart-breaking. I couldn't congratulate you positively, on the event, and yet I hated to condole, in the case of people so gallant and distinguished. So I have been hovering about you in thought like an anxious mother armed, in the evening air, with a shawl or extra wrap, for a pair of belated but high-spirited children liable to feel a chill, but not quite venturing to approach the young people and clap the article on their shoulders. I have remained in short with my warm shawl on my hands, but if I were near you I should clap it straight on your shoulders at the first symptom of a shiver, and wrap it close round and tuck it thoroughly in. Forgive this feeble image of the confirmed devotion I hold at your service. To see you will be a joy and a relief--the next time I go up to town: I mean if it so befalls that you are then in residence at the Palace. I do go up on the 31st--Monday next--to stay till Easter: where my address is 105 Pall Mall, S. W., and if you should be at Hampton Court the least sign from you would bring me begging for a cup of tea. I hope, meanwhile, with all my heart, that these weeks spent in looking, after so many years, Comparative Leisure in the face, have had somewhat the effect of mitigating the austerity of that countenance. There are opportunities always lurking in it--the opportunity, heaven-sent, in Lord Wolseley's case--as I venture to think of it--of sitting down again to the engaging Marlborough. But here I am talking as if you wouldn't know what to do! Whatever you do, or don't, please believe, both of you, in the great personal affection that prompts this and that calls toward you, to the threshold of the New Year, every pleasant possibility and all ease and honour and, so far as you will consent to it, rest.|$|E

The whole structure which I have been attempting to build, will tumble into ruins without this. Be constantly watchful and careful, not only to maintain intimate communion with God, and to renew it daily in <b>your</b> seasons of <b>retirement,</b> but guard <b>your</b> conduct. Let piety control and regulate it. Show your pupils that it makes you amiable, patient, forbearing, benevolent in little things, {{as well as in}} great things, and your example will co-operate with your instructions, and allure your pupils to walk in the paths which you tread. But no clearness and faithfulness in religious teaching will atone for the injury which a bad example will effect. Conduct speaks louder than words, and no persons are more shrewd than the young, to discover the hollowness of empty professions, and the heartlessness of mere pretended interest in their good.|$|R
