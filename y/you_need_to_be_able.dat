5000|$|While Pigliucci is {{an atheist}} himself, {{he does not}} believe that science {{necessarily}} demands atheism because of two distinctions: the distinction between methodological naturalism and philosophical naturalism, and the distinction between value judgements and matters of fact. He believes that many scientists and science educators fail to appreciate these differences. Pigliucci has criticized New Atheist writers for embracing what he considers to be scientism (although he largely excludes philosopher Daniel Dennett from this charge). In a discussion of his book Answers for Aristotle: How Science and Philosophy Can Lead Us to a More Meaningful Life, Pigliucci told Skepticality podcast host Derek Colanduno, [...] "Aristotle was the first ancient thinker to really take seriously the idea that you need both empirical facts, you need an evidence-based approach to the world and <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to reflect on the meaning of those facts...

50|$|There are {{a number}} of clever {{approaches}} to implementing the inmost loop, since listing the elements of a lattice within a rectangular region efficiently is itself a non-trivial problem, and efficiently batching together updates to a sieve region in order to take advantage of cache structures is another non-trivial problem. The normal solution to the first is to have an ordering of the lattice points defined by couple of generators picked so that the decision rule which takes you from one lattice point to the next is straightforward; the normal solution to the second is to collect a series of lists of updates to sub-regions of the array smaller than the size of the level-2 cache, with the number of lists being roughly the number of lines in the L1 cache so that adding an entry to a list is generally a cache hit, and then applying the lists of updates one at a time, where each application will be a level-2 cache hit. For this to be efficient <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to store a number of updates at least comparable {{to the size of the}} sieve array, so this can be quite profligate in memory usage.|$|E
5000|$|Instructor role in Project Based Learning {{is that of}} a facilitator. They do not {{relinquish}} {{control of}} the classroom or student learning but rather develop an atmosphere of shared responsibility. The Instructor must structure the proposed question/issue so as to direct the student's learning toward content-based materials. The instructor must regulate student success with intermittent, transitional goals to ensure student projects remain focused and students have a deep understanding of the concepts being investigated. The students are held accountable to these goals through ongoing feedback and assessments. The ongoing assessment and feedback are essential to ensure the student stays within the scope of the driving question and the core standards the project is trying to unpack. According to Andrew Miller of the Buck Institute of Education, formative assessments are used [...] "in order to be transparent to parents and students, <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to track and monitor ongoing formative assessments, that show work toward that standard."

Fans of the show immediately took to social media after the episode aired to express their outrage, to which Perry replied that he had been referring to Moone's posing skills in a confined space, and not her body. The model was ultimately eliminated the following episode, in which she'd been unable to fit into a size 10 dress for a photo shoot and had to have her photo taken as a close-up. During the episode's deliberation, Perry stated that he wasn't looking for [...] "Australia's next top head". Perry went on to explain, [...] "As a model, no matter what environment you're shooting in, <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to make it work, and she didn't.

5000|$|Not {{only does}} the Kano model feature {{performance}} attributes, but additionally incorporates an [...] "excitement" [...] attribute as well. Excitement attributes {{are for the most}} part unforeseen by the client but may yield paramount satisfaction. Having excitement attributes can only help you, but in some scenarios it is okay to not have them included. The beauty behind an excitement attribute is to spur a potential consumers' imagination, these attributes are used to help the customer discover needs that they've never thought about before. The key behind the Kano model is for the engineer to discover this [...] "unknown need" [...] and enlighten the consumer, to sort of engage that [...] "awe effect." [...] Having concurrent excitement attributes within a product can provide a significant competitive advantage over a rival. In a diverse product assortment, the excitement attributes act as the WOW factors and trigger impulsive wants and needs {{in the mind of the}} customer. The more the customer thinks about these amazing new ideas, the more they want it. Out of all the attributes introduced in the Kano model, the excitement ones are the most powerful and have the potential to lead to the highest gross profit margins. Innovation is undisputedly the catalyst in delivering these attributes to customers; <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to distinguish what is an excitement today, because tomorrow it becomes a known feature and the day after it is used throughout the whole world.|$|E
