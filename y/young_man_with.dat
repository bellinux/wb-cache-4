5|$|The {{two seasons}} of Carnivàle {{take place in}} the Depression-era Dust Bowl between 1934 and 1935, and consist of two main plotlines that slowly converge. The first {{involves}} a <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>with</b> strange healing powers named Ben Hawkins (Nick Stahl), who joins a traveling carnival when it passes near his home in Milfay, Oklahoma. Soon thereafter, Ben begins having surrealistic dreams and visions, which set him on the trail of a man named Henry Scudder, a drifter who crossed paths with the carnival many years before, and who apparently possessed unusual abilities similar to Ben's own.|$|E

Although David Nutter had to convince his manager that the role would not hurt the actor's film career to persuade Welling to read the pilot script, after reading the script Welling agreed to audition.|$|E

5|$|Krishna is {{also known}} by {{numerous}} names, such as Govinda, Mukunda, Madhusudhana, Vasudeva, and Makhan chor. The anecdotes and narratives of Krishna's life are generally titled as Krishna Leela. He is a central character in the Mahabharata, the Bhagavata Purana and the Bhagavad Gita, and is mentioned in many Hindu philosophical, theological, and mythological texts. They portray him in various perspectives: a god-child, a prankster, a model lover, a divine hero, and as the universal supreme being. His iconography reflects these legends, and show him in different stages of his life, such as an infant eating butter, a young boy playing a flute, a <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>with</b> Radha or surrounded by women devotees, or a friendly charioteer giving counsel to Arjuna.|$|E
5|$|Late one night, Ashley (Ashley Ryder)– a <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>with</b> a childlike mentality– {{arrives at}} the caravan home of his Uncle David (David Hoyle) on the Isle of Sheppey. Ashley confides in his uncle that his mother has been {{physically}} abusing him by stubbing cigarettes out on his hand. David lambasts the mother and society in general; the two embrace in a kiss {{before going to bed}} together. The next morning, they awake and have breakfast in bed before David bathes Ashley in the bathtub, telling him a story about an unhappy nuclear family. Going to a local café and then a park bench, David continues to explain his anti-establishment opinions about society. Ashley reveals that he wants to die, and the two express their love for one another.|$|E

When he was nine years old, {{he went to the}} Rouwkoop Boarding School in Rondebosch (Cape Town). Here he stood out for his academic achievements and was subsequently elected Queen's Scholar by the Senate of the South African College in Cape Town. In the six years he spent at the College, after arriving in 1857, he received a broad education in arts and sciences, and developed himself into a well-balanced <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>with</b> obvious leadership qualities. He graduated from South African College in September 1863 with the equivalent of a modern bachelor's degree in arts and sciences.|$|E

40|$|An {{exploratory}} study {{was carried out}} in order to explore social representations of social and psychosocial life cycle crisis, in connection to the social economical context in Argentina in <b>young</b> <b>men,</b> in ages between 20 and 30 years old, with elementary and high school studies, living in Buenos Aires city. Semi-structured interviewing were achieved and analyzed qualitatively. The results show that the social representation of the crisis is mainly perceived as coming from external reasons, such as the economic causes in <b>young</b> <b>men</b> <b>with</b> elementary studies and principally inner reasons (related to personal problems) in those with high school or more studies. However, when they propose solutions, <b>young</b> <b>men</b> <b>with</b> elementary school studies use individual and willing full strategies, while <b>young</b> <b>men</b> <b>with</b> high school studies stress the importance of social policies, but without personally involvement and in a narrative frame where they make a distinction between "we" and "they" (the problematic people) ...|$|R

5|$|Duchesne {{now called}} on Basil Orchard and Wilfred Boothroyd {{to counter the}} defence's evidence. Orchard, another doctor from Penetanguishene, testified that Lamb had {{suddenly}} abandoned any show of amnesia during an interview in August 1966. He saw no evidence that Lamb was insane {{and said that he}} was simply a <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>with</b> strong impulses who sometimes could not control them. Boothroyd, of Sunnybrook Hospital in Toronto, then spoke, arguing that Lamb had been acting out strong feelings of anger and bitterness and fully intended to kill the people he confronted, knowing and understanding what that meant. Lamb, he said, was capable of all kinds of emotion and was perfectly able {{to understand the nature of}} what he had done. Justice Stark intervened during Boothroyd's testimony, asking how he could give a reliable opinion on Lamb when he had never examined him. He also remarked that his opinion was contrary to every doctor who had testified so far.|$|E

40|$|Objective: It {{has been}} {{reported}} that the neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio is significantly elevated in patients with low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (< 35 mg/dL). But in this study, some patients had hypertension that may have affected the neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio. This study consisted of 1274 asymptomatic healthy <b>young</b> <b>men.</b> In contrast <b>with</b> the previous study, we investigated the neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio in healthy <b>young</b> <b>men</b> <b>with</b> low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol compared with controls. Methods: We studied 1274 asymptomatic young males (military personnel screening) who underwent routine health check-up. Of them, 102 subjects had low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Results: The neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio was significantly higher among the <b>men</b> <b>with</b> low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol than that of the control group (P < 0. 001). Conclusion: We conclude that the neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio is significantly elevated in asymptomatic healthy <b>young</b> <b>men</b> <b>with</b> low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol compared with control participants...|$|R

The criminality of lots of these <b>young</b> <b>men</b> <b>with</b> an immigration background results from {{a failure of the}} integration process. Furthermore, the experiences show that their religious knowledge is often rudimentary and ‘erroneous’. This is an obstacle for integration.
