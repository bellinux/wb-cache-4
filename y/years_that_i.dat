It is possible that Byron did not respond because he was married and, according to the 20th-century Byron biographer Phyllis Grosskurth, [...] "Nicolo {{was the last person}} he would have wanted to hear from." ...|$|E
500|$|McDiarmid was {{surprised}} when Lucas approached him 16 years after Return of the Jedi to reprise the role of Palpatine. In an interview, he stated, [...] "When we were doing Return of the Jedi there was a rumor that George Lucas had nine films in his head, and he'd clearly just completed three of them." [...] McDiarmid added, [...] "Someone said that, 'Oh, I think what he might do next is go back in time, and show how Vader came to be.' It {{never occurred to me}} in a million <b>years</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would be involved in that, because I thought, 'oh well, then he'll get a much younger actor [...]' That would be obvious." [...] However, [...] "I was the right age, ironically, for the first prequel when it was made. ... So I was in the very strange and rather wonderful paradox of playing myself when young at my own age, having played myself previously when 100-and-I-don't-know-what." ...|$|E

500|$|Spain's first match during {{qualification}} for the 2010 World Cup {{was against}} Bosnia and Herzegovina where Villa scored the only {{goal of the}} game. He {{would go on to}} score four goals in Spain's next three games, including a last minute winner against Belgium. Another goal during a friendly match against Chile saw him end the year with 12 goals, breaking Raúl's record of 10 goals held since 1999. Villa began 2009 with a goal against England in a 2–0 friendly, with this goal, he broke another record and became the first Spanish international to have scored in six consecutive games, seeing off records set by Telmo Zarra and László Kubala. Speaking of the goal, he said, [...] "I am very happy with the goal. Truth is, I really want to see it on TV. The record is very nice. I would never have imagined in <b>years</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would be able to obtain it. I am very proud and I hope I can continue breaking records." ...|$|E
500|$|After the 2009 Afghan presidential election, Afghan President Karzai's {{views about}} the {{security}} issues confronting Afghanistan {{and how best to}} deal with them reportedly changed. This impacted the working relationship between the President of Afghanistan and some of his cabinet ministers including his intelligence chief. Saleh said, [...] "He [...] thought democracy had hurt him as a person. His family had been attacked by the media unfairly, and the West was criticizing him unfairly. So after a presidential election, he was a changed man, and we could not have the same relationship as before the presidential election." [...] Political analyst Ahmed Rashid in 2010 observed the same, [...] "Karzai's new outlook is the most dramatic political shift he has undergone in the twenty-six <b>years</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have known him." [...] Both Saleh and Interior Minister Hanif Atmar subsequently had strong disagreements with Karzai on how to proceed against the Taliban, who Karzai began referring to as [...] "brothers". At that point Saleh and Atmar were increasingly isolated in the Karzai administration.|$|E
500|$|In the {{following}} season, Hextall remained with Hershey, appearing in 53games during [...] the 1985–86 season. He recorded 30wins {{and the lowest}} GAA average of his career to that point, 3.41. The Bears finished the regular season as league leaders, and won the John D. Chick Trophy as the South Division Champions. Hextall lived up to his aggressive reputation in the Conference final, played against the St. Catharines Saints, fighting three different members of the opposition side during a single bench-clearing brawl. The Bears advanced to the Calder Cup final, having beaten the New Haven Nighthawks 4–1 and the St.Catharines Saints 4–3. In the final, they faced the Adirondack Red Wings, who won the championship by four games to two. Hextall played 13games in the playoffs, of which his team won five, and his GAA was3.23. He was named as the Dudley [...] "Red" [...] Garrett Memorial Award winner, as the AHL's outstanding rookie player. Looking back on {{his time in the}} AHL, Hextall reflected that despite his initial disappointment at not being selected to play for the Flyers straight away, [...] "the two <b>years</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> spent in the American League got me to the point where I was sure I could be a No.1 goaltender at the NHL level." ...|$|E

[...] Writing thirty years later about the 1969 violent takeover by black Cornell students of Willard Straight Hall, Sowell characterized the students as [...] "hoodlums" [...] with [...] "serious academic problems [...] admitted under lower academic standards", and noted [...] "it so happens that the pervasive racism that black students supposedly encountered at every turn on campus and in town was not apparent to me during the four <b>years</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> taught at Cornell and lived in Ithaca." ...|$|E
2500|$|Griffin is {{sometimes}} {{the object of}} her own humor, {{particularly with regard to}} her D-list status. While Griffin paints herself as a Hollywood outsider, she has a group of close celebrity friends such as Rosie O'Donnell, Joan Rivers, Jerry Seinfeld, Gloria Estefan, Whoopi Goldberg, Jennifer Coolidge, Rachel True, Larry David, Ricky Gervais, Anderson Cooper, Cher and Lance Bass. Griffin's longtime friendship with Bass was the catalyst for a feud between her and gossip blogger Perez Hilton, in which Griffin expressed anger over Hilton's [...] "outing" [...] of Bass on his website, calling Hilton's attacks on Bass [...] "mean" [...] and [...] "unfunny". Hilton responded by saying that Griffin's anger was hypocritical, considering all of the gay jokes she makes about Clay Aiken in her stand-up routines. In 2007, Griffin commented on her aversion to making fun of celebrity friends by saying, [...] "There's nothing I won't do, {{but on the other hand}} I'm full of shit because that changes. For example, you know Lance Bass from 'N Sync and how he's gay now? All those <b>years</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> knew he was gay, he and I were friends, I would never say, 'Hey, by the way, did you know that Lance Bass is gay?'" [...] Griffin and Hilton ended their feud after the death of Griffin's father, and Hilton appeared on an episode of her show in 2007. Yet in July 2008, he asserted that Griffin's assistant Jessica Zajicek had quit because she could not take Griffin's now hectic career. Griffin dismissed these statements as false as Zajicek is still working for Griffin. However, the season premiere of The D-List depicted that Zajicek was no longer working for Griffin; Griffin explained early in the episode that Zajicek [...] "has decided to move on".|$|E

2500|$|For {{some time}} the Duke {{and his colleagues}} {{had been looking for}} a way out of their difficulty, by which they could save themselves, satisfy public clamor and yet avoid {{responsibility}} before history. Bazaine stated in his defence [...] "I have graven on my chest two words - Honneur et Patrie. They have guided me for the whole of my military career. I have never failed that noble motto, no more at Metz than anywhere else during the forty-two <b>years</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have loyally served France. I swear it here, before Christ". Despite a vigorous defence of Bazaine's actions by Lachaud, and the presentation of a number of strong witness statements from his staff including Colonel Willette, the court found Bazaine guilty of negotiating with and capitulating to the enemy before doing all that was prescribed by duty and honour. It was clear even to the most partial observer, that the verdict bore very little relation to the evidence. For example, the Marshal surrendered only after receiving letters recommending him to do so from his generals, but the presentation of these at the trial was ignored. [...] "I have read every word of the evidence [...] and believe it to be the most malicious casuistry" [...] (New York Times correspondent). A letter which Prince Frederick Charles wrote in Bazaine's favour only added to the wrath of the people, who cried aloud for his execution. The court sentenced Bazaine to 'degradation and death', and to pay the costs of the enormous trial (300,000 francs), which was to leave the Marshal's young family penniless. [...] Bazaine's reaction on being read the sentence of the court was [...] "It is my life you want, take it at once, let me be shot immediately, but preserve my family". Since the Revolution, only two French Marshals have been condemned to death — Ney, by a Bourbon, and Bazaine, by an Orléans. But, as though the judges themselves felt a twinge of conscience at the sentence, they immediately and unanimously signed a petition for 'Executive Clemency' to the President of the Third Republic, Marshal MacMahon, although Bazaine refused to sign this petition himself.|$|E
