500|$|Dalglish {{was pleased}} with Liverpool's game and told the press: [...] "The most {{important}} thing is that we got our own standard of football right. We were the better team in all departments and we know that if we get it right then we will be there or thereabouts." [...] Hysén, the man of the match, said of his centre-back partner Hansen: [...] "It is so easy playing alongside Alan. He tells <b>you</b> <b>where</b> to go and what position to take up." [...] He saw similarities with Liverpool and playing for a national team: [...] "The standards are so amazingly high. I just want to win things with them." ...|$|E
500|$|Much of {{the story}} is told by the songs, with the lyrics {{coordinating}} with the events {{of the story}}. For example, [...] "Don't You Want Me" [...] introduces the affair between Greg and Connie, allowing them to flirt in the presence of Fran. It pre-empts the result of their relationship with the line [...] "we will both be sorry"; this is unsung by the characters, but nonetheless emphasise in the episode. The song also speaks to the relationship between Greg and Roger, with Greg singing [...] "don't you want me?" [...] when he fears that he will be fired, and tells of Greg's character with lines including [...] "Don't forget it's me who put <b>you</b> <b>where</b> you are now // And I can put you back there too".|$|E
500|$|The cartooning is far looser than in Brown's earlier work, and {{concerned}} more with gesture and expression than literal detail. They are rendered with a brush, and amongst {{the simplest and}} sparsest in his body of work. There is nonetheless {{a significant amount of}} hatching, and the backgrounds are naturalistic, in contrast to the thin, distorted figures. [...] Brown had been paring his artwork since the Playboy stories, as he was not happy with his style and sought [...] "to rebuild [...] style in a way that [...] would like". [...] He continued this with I Never Liked <b>You,</b> <b>where</b> he has said he was [...] "trying to get even more pared down than The Playboy". [...] Certain inanimate objects receive a focus imbuing them with special significance, such as Chet's habitual after-school package of soda crackers or the Brown family home—a house that, to reviewer Darcy Sullivan, [...] "is as much a character [...] as in The Playboy".|$|E

500|$|Santer {{said there}} were three big clues to the killer's identity, [...] "one in the Christmas Day episode, one more {{recently}} than Christmas and there's another one that, if I were to tell <b>you</b> <b>where</b> it was, would perhaps give it away too easily," [...] however, in a chat with Sharon Marshall shown on This Morning on 18 February 2010, he said the second clue was about halfway through the investigation and the third was [...] "on screen but not necessarily in the programme". He {{also said that the}} outcome would be [...] "surprising", [...] "satisfying" [...] and [...] "in retrospect, inevitable", adding that [...] "it makes sense". Santer confirmed the clues in an interview on the EastEnders website: on Christmas Day Stacey disappears and it is never explained why, and then reappears on Boxing Day appearing [...] "not quite with it"; Stacey is the only character still sufficiently angry enough to spit on Archie's grave at his funeral; and Stacey is the first character to feature in the Christmas Day trailers.|$|E
500|$|War for Cybertron was {{announced}} December 16, 2009, {{and was released}} in North America on June 22, 2010 with the PAL region release following on June 25, 2010. It is powered by Unreal Engine 3. [...] Physics for the game are handled using the Havok physics library. A demo was released on June 10, 2010 which allowed for players to play various multiplayer matches using two of the game's character classes. [...] Developer High Moon Studios designed the friendly AI so that as a player progresses through the story any accompanying characters will help the player, but still require the player to advance through the game. [...] "The buddies don't advance the story for you. [...] They {{get to the point}} to kinda show <b>you</b> <b>where</b> to go, but then they'll take up defensive positions and wait for you to progress the story" [...] said Game Director Matt Tieger. [...] "They're not finishing objectives for you, but they like to stay near you, they'll heal you if you get too wounded, they're pretty smart." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{watching}} {{the first several}} episodes of season three, Aaron Riccio of Slant Magazine gave the show 3.5/4 stars, and praised it for making a [...] "huge, game-changing step forward". He continued that [...] "Hard science meets soft comedy, {{and the results are}} consistently surprising and rarely disappointing. The solid mythology and high stakes keep the series moving as forward as quickly as FlashForward and The Event, but the dual tones of the two worlds offer considerably more breadth in the stories it tells... captivating television". Robert Bianco from USA Today praised Torv, Noble, and Jackson's performances. He however disliked the new plotline of two Olivias, explaining [...] "It's hard to fault the execution of the first two episodes, which skillfully set up Fringe's two competing universes and two misplaced Olivias... Yet well-done isn't the same as welcome. I'm not giving up on the show, which was one of last year's best. But I don't want to spend weeks watching our Olivia suffer and their Olivia make Walter and Peter suffer. You have to give writers leeway to take <b>you</b> <b>where</b> they want to go — but at a certain point, commercial entertainment has to be entertaining, or there's no reason to watch".|$|E

500|$|Initially, {{the song}} [...] "Everyone's at It" [...] was {{announced}} {{to be released}} as the lead single from the album, but it was ultimately decided on [...] "The Fear". While discussing It's Not Me, It's You, Allen stated that her intention was to make [...] "bigger sounding, more ethereal songs, real songs. [...] I think I've grown up a bit {{as a person and}} I hope it reflects that." [...] She released a demo version of the song, which was then called [...] "I Don't Know", onto her Myspace account, along with another song, [...] "I Could Say", in April 2008. The singer declared about the inspiration for the song, which has to do with materialism and the pressures of being rich and famous: [...] tell <b>you</b> <b>where</b> the inspiration for it came from. I was walking down this street, in this village {{in the middle of the}} countryside in the U.K., and there was this little girl who must have been eight or nine, walking down the street with her mum in, like, high-waisted hot pants and a little crop top. And I just thought, 'That's not really right.' And I could tell she was the kind of girl that would be trying out for Pop Idol in five years time, and wants to be famous when she grows up. And there's definitely the whole culture of that where I come from, and it's not necessarily a culture that I think is particularly healthy. But at the same time, I'm very aware that I am a part of that culture – but it's not something that I feel particularly comfortable with.|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} series of Torchwood, Gwen functioned as an {{audience}} surrogate. Russell T Davies likened her character type {{to that of}} 2005–06 Doctor Who lead female Rose Tyler (Billie Piper): [...] "She is the ordinary person who stumbles into something extraordinary and finds herself their equal." [...] Eve Myles characterised Gwen as an ambitious and feisty young woman, who {{at the same time}} embodies many aspects of the girl next door archetype. [...] Her distinct role within the team {{stems from the fact that}} [...] "she's there for the people", who she feels [...] "instinctive and passionate" [...] about. Producer Richard Stokes noted that Gwen possesses more [...] "human empathy" [...] than the more mercenary members of the team, who are seen to be [...] "technology-and-alien-obsessed". In this vein, lead actor John Barrowman commented that Gwen brings a [...] "little bit of soul" [...] back to Jack. Describing the ways in which Gwen's methods differ from the rest of the team, Myles explained how her police procedural training relates to the job: [...] "she deals with the families, she deals with profiling, she deals with searching people's backgrounds. It's a new way of working she brings in". Myles stated that Gwen would have made a [...] "fantastic policewoman" [...] prior to joining Torchwood, drawing on the character's ability to get vulnerable characters to [...] "open up by making them feel comfortable". Myles perceived Gwen to be [...] "the heart and emotion of Torchwood", and [...] "Torchwood's social worker" [...] who can [...] "run and fight and stand in her own corner and win". Gaining insight into Torchwood through curiosity, Gwen becomes part of Torchwood because they need her, just as she needs them. Gwen's friendship with former colleague Andy is used by the production team to juxtapose her extraordinary life with a mundane one, as well as highlighting her transformation into a harder woman. Andy is present immediately before Gwen first encounters Torchwood, and Myles feels his later appearances [...] "takes you right back to the beginning, it reminds <b>you</b> <b>where</b> she came from, how Jack found Gwen". Myles observed that Gwen's many facets prevent her from getting bored; she feels constantly challenged [...] "physically", [...] "mentally" [...] and [...] "morally" [...] through portraying the character.|$|E
