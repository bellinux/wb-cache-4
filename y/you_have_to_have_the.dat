2500|$|Deceiving youths into donning {{handcuffs}} became Gacy's typical {{modus operandi}} in subduing his victims. After plying a youth with drink, drugs or generally gaining his trust, Gacy {{would produce a}} pair of handcuffs (occasionally {{as part of a}} clowning routine) which he would persuade his intended victim into donning. With his victim manacled and unable to free himself, Gacy would then make a statement to the effect of: [...] "The trick is, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> key", before proceeding to rape and torture his captive.

Hansen said he did not agree with cap and trade schemes, like the NZETS that included forestry offsets. [...] "In my opinion <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> simplest, transparent scheme so I just say it should be a flat fee proportional to the amount of carbon in the fuel.

2500|$|Hip hop {{culture has}} spread to both urban and {{suburban}} communities throughout the United States and subsequently the world. These elements were adapted and developed considerably, particularly as the art forms spread to new continents and merged with local styles in the 1990s and subsequent decades. Even as the movement continues to expand globally and explore myriad styles and art forms, including hip hop theater and hip hop film, the four foundational elements provide coherence and a strong foundation for hip hop culture. [...] Hip hop is simultaneously a new and old phenomenon; the importance of sampling tracks, beats and basslines from old records [...] to the art form means {{that much of the}} culture has revolved around the idea of updating classic recordings, attitudes, and experiences for modern audiences. Sampling older culture and reusing it in a new context or a new format is called [...] "flipping" [...] in hip hop culture. Hip hop music follows in the footsteps of earlier African-American-rooted musical genres such as blues, jazz, rag-time, funk, and disco {{to become one of the}} most practiced genres worldwide. It is the language of urban environments and the youth around the world, many who do not know what Hip Hop (the consciousness which makes up the collective culture of Hip Hop) is or what it means to [...] "Be Hip Hop" [...] , have recently begun to attribute being Hip Hop with being black, however that is race , not culture and not consciousness. as KRS-One says [...] "Hip Hop is the only place where you see Martin Luther King Jr. s; 'I have a dream speech' in real life" [...] and [...] "To be Hip Hop <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> courage to be you and be Hip Hop all the time not just when it's popular or convenient, and have repped it when it wasn't and you were the only one repping it." [...] He also notes that Hip Hop is beyond something as simple minded as race or gender or nationality, it belongs to the world.|$|E

60|$|I {{have lived}} a {{severely}} moral life. But {{it would be}} a mistake for other people to try that, or for me to recommend it. Very few would succeed: you have to have a perfectly colossal stock of morals; and you can't get them on a margin; <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> whole thing, and put them in your box. Morals are an acquirement--like music, like a foreign language, like piety, poker, paralysis--no man is born with them. I wasn't myself, I started poor. I hadn't a single moral. There is hardly a man in this house that is poorer than I was then. Yes, I started like that--the world before me, not a moral in the slot. Not even an insurance moral. I can remember the first one I ever got. I can remember the landscape, the weather, the--I can remember how everything looked. It was an old moral, an old second-hand moral, all out of repair, and didn't fit, anyway. But if you are careful with a thing like that, and keep it in a dry place, and save it for processions, and Chautauquas, and World's Fairs, and so on, and disinfect it now and then, and give it a fresh coat of whitewash once in a while, you will be surprised to see how well she will last and how long she will keep sweet, or at least inoffensive. When I got that mouldy old moral, she had stopped growing, because she hadn't any exercise; but I worked her hard, I worked her Sundays and all. Under this cultivation she waxed in might and stature beyond belief, and served me well and was my pride and joy for sixty-three years; then she got to associating with insurance presidents, and lost flesh and character, and was a sorrow to look at and no longer competent for business. She was a great loss to me. Yet not all loss. I sold her--ah, pathetic skeleton, as she was--I sold her to Leopold, the pirate King of Belgium; he sold her to our Metropolitan Museum, and it was very glad to get her, for without a rag on, she stands 57 feet long and 16 feet high, and they think she's a brontosaur. Well, she looks it. They believe it will take nineteen geological periods to breed her match.|$|E
