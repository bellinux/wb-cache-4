We can still function. That made a big impression on me.|$|E

2500|$|Harrison's first {{assignment}} {{under her}} new Fox contract {{was as a}} [...] "Biker Chick" [...] in Men Against Evil, a TV pilot which became the TV series Felony Squad. [...] "I had three words, [...] "Go, man, go!" [...] I was all of 20, and dressed in this really racy motorcycle outfit. Those were my first words! This was still the era of stardom and premieres. When you were put under a studio contract, every minute of your life was so exciting, because <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> something so unique and special." [...] (Three years later, Harrison co-starred as Felony Squad star Dennis Cole's love interest in the NBC TV series Bracken's World.) Harrison's next assignment was in the campy Batman TV series; she appeared briefly as one of three high school cheerleaders in the Batman episodes [...] "The Joker Goes to School" [...] and [...] "He Meets His Match, The Grisly Ghoul", which aired in early March 1966. To prepare Harrison for her few seconds onscreen, her Fox dance coach worked Harrison and her fellow cheerleaders {{early in the morning}} and on through the day. Linda, a former high school cheerleader, complained, [...] "You're going to use up all my energy, so when the shot comes, I won't have any." [...] Her coach complained that [...] "Linda Harrison gave me a hard time." [...] After the brief late afternoon shot, Harrison's overworked leg muscles failed on her way home, and Richard D. Zanuck had to carry her upstairs to their Wilshire-Westwood apartment.|$|E
2500|$|Filming {{began at}} the Cinecittà studio in Rome again in mid-May 1966, {{including}} the opening scene between Eastwood and Wallach when Blondie captures Tuco {{for the first time}} and sends him to jail. The production then moved on to Spain's plateau region near Burgos in the north, which doubled for the southwestern United States, and again shot the western scenes in Almería in the south. This time, the production required more elaborate sets, including a town under cannon fire, an extensive prison camp and an American Civil War battlefield; and for the climax, several hundred Spanish soldiers were employed to build a cemetery with several thousand grave stones to resemble an ancient Roman circus. For the scene where the bridge was blown up, it had to be filmed twice as in the first take all three cameras were destroyed by the explosion. Eastwood remembers, [...] "They would care if <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> a story about Spaniards and about Spain. Then they'd scrutinize you very tough, but the fact that you're doing a western that's supposed to be laid in southwest America or Mexico, they couldn't care less what your story or subject is." [...] Top Italian cinematographer Tonino Delli Colli was brought in to shoot the film and was prompted by Leone to pay more attention to light than in the previous two films; Ennio Morricone composed the score once again. Leone was instrumental in asking Morricone to compose a track for the final Mexican stand-off scene in the cemetery, asking him to compose what felt like [...] "the corpses were laughing from inside their tombs", and asked Delli Colli to create a hypnotic whirling effect interspersed with dramatic extreme close ups, to give the audience the impression of a visual ballet. Filming concluded in July 1966.|$|E
2500|$|Puyi came to Beijing on 9 December 1959 {{with special}} {{permission}} from Mao Zedong and lived {{for the next}} six months in an ordinary Beijing residence with his sister before being transferred to a government-sponsored hotel. Puyi had the job of sweeping the streets, and got lost on his first day of work, which led him to tell astonished passers-by: [...] "I'm Puyi, the last Emperor of the Qing dynasty. I'm staying with relatives and can't find my way home". One of Puyi's first acts upon returning to Beijing was to visit the Forbidden City as a tourist, where he pointed out to other tourists that many of the exhibits were the things he had used in his youth. He voiced his support for the Communists and worked at the Beijing Botanical Gardens. Working as a simple gardener gave Puyi a degree of happiness that he had never known as an emperor, though he was notably clumsy. Behr noted that in Europe people who played roles analogous to the role Puyi played in Manchukuo were generally executed; for example, the British hanged William Joyce ("Lord Haw-haw") only for being the announcer on the English-language broadcasts of Radio Berlin, Italian Communist guerrillas shot Benito Mussolini, and the French executed Pierre Laval, so many Westerners are surprised that Puyi was released from prison after only nine years to start a new life. Behr wrote that the Communist ideology explained this difference, writing: [...] "In a society where all landlord and 'capitalist-roaders' were evil incarnate, it did not matter so much that Puyi was also a traitor to his country: he was, in the eyes of the Communist ideologues, only behaving true to type. If all capitalists and landlords were, by their very nature, traitors, it was only logical that Puyi, the biggest landlord, should also be the biggest traitor. And, in the last resort, Puyi was far more valuable alive than dead". In early 1960, Puyi met Premier Zhou Enlai, who told him: [...] "You weren't responsible for becoming Emperor at the age of three or the 1917 attempted restoration coup. But you were fully to blame for what happened later. You knew perfectly well what <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> when you took refuge in the Legation Quarter, when you traveled under Japanese protection to Tianjin, and when you agreed to become Manchukuo Chief Executive." [...] Puyi responded by merely saying that though he did not choose to be an emperor, he had behaved with savage cruelty as boy-emperor and wished he could apologize to all of the eunuchs he had flogged during his youth.|$|E
