25|$|With 30.5% of Morocco's {{population}} of 34.3m aged 14 or younger, {{according to the}} CIA, job creation for the young {{is one of the}} government's major priorities. 2007 data indicate that 17.6% of those in the 15–24 age group are unemployed. This rises to around one third in urban areas—rural communities often employ the young in agriculture, including on the family farm, as soon as they leave school, contributing to relatively high <b>youth</b> <b>employment</b> rates (lower levels of official unemployment registration are also a factor).|$|E
25|$|Children’s {{allowances}} for students {{up to the}} age of twenty-seven were introduced, together with a flexible retirement age, new married couples’ and families’ legislation, an extension of co-determination, rehabilitation and special employment rights for the severely handicapped, adjustments and increases in the pensions of war victims, a revision of child benefit, a new <b>youth</b> <b>employment</b> protection law, health insurance for farmers, pension schemes for the self-employed, and guaranteed works’ pensions. Although the principle of the social welfare state was enshrined in the constitution of West Germany, and laws and measures taken (often jointly by the CDU/CSU coalition partners and the SPD) to meet this commitment, it was only when the SPD came to power in Bonn that the provisions of the social welfare system “reached a level which few other countries could equal.” In 1975, three tax levels were introduced that removed many lower-income persons from the tax rolls and raised child benefit payments.|$|E

Speaking in favour of democracy, he stated that when the AD governors accepted President Olusegun Obasanjo's request to avoid local council polls, they fell into a trap.

25|$|In 1927, Harcourt took a {{leave of}} absence from the British Army and in 1929 he {{travelled}} to Australia. He eventually applied for a discharge from the army and decided to settle in Victoria. Later he moved to Tasmania where he took a job with the government and became a civil servant. He also became involved in the Boy Scouts and in 1933 he served as secretary and organiser of the first World Scout Jamboree to be held in Australia, taking place over Christmas 1933–34. On 28 April 1939, while he was working with the <b>Youth</b> <b>Employment</b> Office in Hobart, Harcourt was involved in a motor vehicle accident at Kings Meadows, Launceston. While attempting to take evasive action to avoid hitting a car that was driving {{on the wrong side of}} the road, Harcourt's car collided with a pedestrian who had been walking on the road. Although Harcourt rushed the pedestrian, an eight-year-old boy, to hospital, the boy's injuries proved fatal. An inquest was subsequently held and found that Harcourt was in no way to blame for the accident.|$|E
25|$|Assuming {{that low}} turnout is a {{reflection}} of disenchantment or indifference, a poll with very low turnout may not be an accurate reflection of the will of the people. On the other hand, if low turnout {{is a reflection}} of contentment of voters about likely winners or parties, then low turnout is as legitimate as high turnout, as long as the right to vote exists. Still, low turnouts can lead to unequal representation among various parts of the population. In developed countries, non-voters tend to be concentrated in particular demographic and socioeconomic groups, especially the young and the poor. However, in India, which boasts an electorate of more than 814 million people, the opposite is true. The poor, who comprise the majority of the demographic, are more likely to vote than the rich and the middle classes, and turnout is higher in rural areas than urban areas. In low-turnout countries, these groups are often significantly under-represented in elections. This has the potential to skew policy. For instance, a high voter turnout among the elderly coupled with a low turnout among the young may lead to more money for retirees' health care, and less for <b>youth</b> <b>employment</b> schemes. Some nations thus have rules that render an election invalid if too few people vote, such as Serbia, where three successive presidential elections were rendered invalid in 2003.|$|E

Jenny Marra, Labour's deputy finance and <b>youth</b> <b>employment</b> spokeswoman, also decided not to stand.

500|$|In May 2006, Baird {{was asked}} to find $1 billion in cuts for 2006 and 2007. On September 25, {{on the same day}} that the {{government}} announced a $13.2 billion surplus, Baird announced cuts to sixty-six federal programs, including Status of Women, medicinal marijuana research, Canadian museums, adult literacy, <b>youth</b> <b>employment</b> and social development and the British Columbia pine beetle program. One of the most controversial cuts was to the federal Court Challenges Program, which provided funding for Canadians to pursue rights cases in the Canadian court system. Baird argued that government funding would be redirected in a way that [...] "reflects the priorities of working families" [...] and that he [...] "just [...] think it made sense for the government to subsidize lawyers to challenge the government's own laws in court." [...] In justifying cuts to adult literacy programs, Baird referenced his government's support for youth literacy and said, [...] "We've got to fix the ground level problem and not be trying to do repair work after the fact." ...|$|E
500|$|Boyack {{said that}} as leader, she would {{campaign}} on better funding for healthcare, improvements to childcare, education and <b>youth</b> <b>employment</b> opportunities, and the devolvement of power to local government. She backed the scrapping of the Trident programme. She wanted to reform Council tax, which had been frozen since the SNP {{came to power in}} 2007, and suggested the existing eight tax bands should be redrawn. She would allow local authorities to raise a tourism tax, while environmentally friendly power firms and bus companies would be created to raise public funds. She supported establishing a consensus on whether or not to have full tax devolution, but had [...] "reservations" [...] about the prospect of devolving further taxes to Holyrood. She favoured devolving welfare benefits to Scotland. She told STV's Stephen Daisley that she wished [...] "to make Scottish Labour a force in Scottish politics again". After publishing a list of social justice-themed policies, she announced plans to establish a commission similar to the Social Justice Commission created by UK Labour leader John Smith in 1994, which had helped shape Labour policy in areas such as employment and welfare.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} the Centre Party {{proposed a}} special youth {{contract of employment}} for those aged under 26, allowing their term of employment to be ended by their employer {{up to two years}} after they begin work. This controversial proposal (not adopted by the Alliance as a whole) was intended to increase <b>youth</b> <b>employment</b> by making taking on new employees less risky for the employer, but it was criticised by the red-green parties as reducing job security for the young. A similar contract introduced by the French government (the Contrat première embauche) caused angry demonstrations and riots in France.
