25|$|Unless {{you have}} secret incriminating {{evidence}} against Furtwängler supporting your accusation {{that he was}} a tool of Nazi Party, I beg to take violent issue with <b>your</b> <b>decision</b> to ban him. The man never was a Party member. Upon numerous occasions, he risked his own safety and reputation to protect friends and colleagues. Do not believe that the fact of remaining in one's own country is alone sufficient to condemn a man. On the contrary, as a military man, you would know that remaining at one's post often requires greater courage than running away. He saved, and for that we are deeply his debtors, the best part of his own German culture... I believe it patently unjust and most cowardly for us to make of Furtwängler a scapegoat for our own crimes. If the man is guilty of specific crimes, accuse him and convict him. As far as I can see, it is no punishment to be banned from sordid, filthy Berlin and if the man now old and ill is willing and anxious to return to his exacting task and responsibilities he should be encouraged for that is where he belongs, right in Berlin...|$|E

500|$|The $210 million LIRR plan faced great criticism, and one {{particular}} section received heavy opposition. New York State Senator John J. Santucci, representing the Rockaways, raised concerns that a [...] tunnel for the link, which would {{connect to the}} Rockaway Beach Branch, would require razing part of Forest Park, a plan that was opposed by his constituents. Santucci said that the link's construction would irreversibly destroy part of the park, destroying a community landmark and [...] "stripping away {{the resources of the}} people for the luxury of the few." [...] In October 1974, the president of the Hammel Holland Seaside Civic Association wrote to Mayor Abraham Beame, [...] "It is our earnest plea to you that <b>your</b> <b>decision</b> on this rape of Forest Park be rescinded." [...] The association's president further said that although it would be cost-ineffective to create a premium service to JFK Airport, the Rockaway Beach Branch should still be reactivated for local passengers.|$|E
500|$|Barton {{does not}} believe Hollywood offers the same opportunity. In the film, Los Angeles {{is a world of}} false fronts and phony people. This is evident in an early line of the {{screenplay}} (filmed, but not included in the theatrical release); while informing Barton of Capitol Pictures' offer, his agent tells him: [...] "I'm only asking that <b>your</b> <b>decision</b> be informed by a little realism– [...] if I can use that word and Hollywood in the same breath". Later, as Barton tries to explain why he's staying at the Earle, studio head Jack Lipnick finishes his sentence, recognizing that Barton wants a place that is [...] "less Hollywood". The assumption is that Hollywood is fake and the Earle is genuine. Producer Ben Geisler takes Barton to lunch at a restaurant featuring a mural of the [...] "New York Cafe", a sign of Hollywood's effort to replicate the authenticity of the East Coast. Lipnick's initial overwhelming exuberance is also a façade. Although he begins by telling Barton: [...] "The writer is king here at Capitol Pictures", in the penultimate scene he insists: [...] "If your opinion mattered, then I guess I'd resign and let you run the studio. It doesn't, and you won't, and the lunatics are not going to run this particular asylum".|$|E

2500|$|In {{the second}} incident, Yang Biao (楊彪), the Grand Commandant, {{was arrested and}} imprisoned for {{allegedly}} conspiring with Yuan Shu, a warlord who rebelled against the Eastern Han dynasty. Man Chong, {{who was in charge}} of interrogating Yang Biao, received requests from his colleagues Xun Yu and Kong Rong to refrain from using torture on Yang Biao during the interrogation. However, Man Chong ignored them and did everything by the book. A few days later, Man Chong reported to Cao Cao: [...] "Yang Biao had nothing to say when I interrogated him. Before executing a criminal, we must first produce evidence of his guilt and show it to the public. Yang Biao is a reputable man. If we execute him without sufficient evidence to show that he is guilty, the people will lose faith in us. I hope you will reconsider <b>your</b> <b>decision</b> carefully and not be too hasty in ordering Yang Biao's execution." [...] Cao Cao then released Yang Biao. Xun Yu and Kong Rong were initially angry with Man Chong when they found out that he tortured Yang Biao during the interrogation.

2500|$|At this point, Cleon and Demosthenes {{declined}} {{to push the}} attack further, preferring to take as many Spartans as they could prisoner. [...] An Athenian herald offered the Spartans a chance to surrender, and the Spartans, throwing down their shields, agreed at least to negotiate. [...] Cleon and Demosthenes met with the Spartan commander Styphon (Styphon had initially been the third in command, but Epitadas had been killed and his first successor was severely wounded and had been left for dead). [...] Styphon requested to send a herald to the mainland to seek advice; the Athenians refused to allow any of the trapped men to leave, but permitted as many heralds from the mainland as were desired to pass back and forth. [...] Several messengers did so, the last of whom left Styphon with the message [...] "The Spartans order you to make <b>your</b> <b>decision</b> yourselves, {{so long as you}} do nothing dishonorable." [...] Styphon and his men, with no hope of victory or escape, surrendered. [...] Of the 440 Spartans who had crossed over to Sphacteria, 292 survived to surrender; of these, 120 were men of the elite Spartiate class.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to {{the sixteenth}} world congress, a major split {{occurred}} in the FI's section in Brazil. The International was doubtful from the beginning about the participation in Lula's government of a leader of its Brazilian section, later saying that [...] "from the beginning there were different positions about ... participation in the government, in the International {{as well as in}} your ranks. But once the DS had decided in favour of participation, without hiding our reservations and doubts, we respected <b>your</b> <b>decision</b> and tried to help rather than put a spoke in your wheel. So we made an effort to convince comrades in our own sections that logically speaking the question of participation in the government should be subordinated to a judgement of the government’s orientations." [...] As time went on, the International became more openly critical of its section's role in government. Members in Brazil were then in two different organisations: a majority group, Socialist Democracy (Brazil), which is inside the PT; and a minority ENLACE current in the PSOL, which opposes participation in capitalist government. However, Socialist Democracy withdrew from active participation in the Fourth International in 2006, leaving ENLACE as its Brazilian section.|$|E
2500|$|The choice {{received}} generally {{positive reactions}} from Republicans and conservatives.

Independent-Democratic Senator Joe Lieberman stated that McCain made a [...] "bold choice" [...] in picking a [...] "maverick {{who has done}} {{exactly the same thing}} at the state level that he's done at the federal level." [...] However, some Republicans did not receive the choice favorably. Charles Krauthammer of the Washington Post wrote, [...] "The Palin selection completely undercuts the argument about Obama's inexperience and readiness to lead.... To gratuitously undercut the remarkably successful 'Is he ready to lead' line of attack seems near suicidal." [...] David Frum of National Review wrote: [...] "The longer I think about it, the less well this selection sits with me.... If it were <b>your</b> <b>decision,</b> and you were putting your country first, would you put an untested small-town mayor [...] a heartbeat away from the presidency?".
