5|$|Jan Smuts {{was born}} in 1870, the second son of a {{traditional}} Boer farming family. By rural tradition, the eldest son {{would be the only}} child to receive a full formal education; however, on the death of his elder brother in 1882, 12-year-old Jan was sent to school for the first time. After four <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>education</b> he had made exceptional progress, gaining admission to study at Victoria College in Stellenbosch. He graduated in 1891 with first-class honours in Literature and Science. With this strong academic background, he applied for, and won, the Ebden scholarship for overseas study, electing to read Law at Christ's College, Cambridge. After further academic success, and the recipient of many prestigious academic awards, he graduated in 1894 with double First-class honours. After graduating, Smuts passed the examinations for the Inns of Court, entering the Middle Temple. In 1895, despite the prospect of a bright future in the United Kingdom, the homesick Smuts returned to South Africa.|$|E

30|$|The {{relationship}} between education and earnings is statistically significant and non-linear for both sexes. The returns to education at almost all levels are higher for women than for men: except for non-university post-secondary education, the coefficients {{on all the}} education dummies are significantly higher for women. Completing secondary education appears to be critical for men. Up to three <b>years</b> <b>of</b> secondary <b>education,</b> the incremental return from an additional <b>year</b> <b>of</b> schooling, though significant, is small. There is a jump in the incremental return upon completing four <b>years</b> <b>of</b> secondary <b>education,</b> and the earnings differentials between successive stages <b>of</b> <b>education</b> beyond this level imply a constant percentage increase in earnings from an additional <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>education.</b> In contrast, for women, the returns from completing primary education and from obtaining a university degree are substantial. In the interim education levels, the incremental return from an additional <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>education</b> is steady.|$|R
