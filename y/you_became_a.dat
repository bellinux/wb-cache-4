"Mabel," [...] Lunn wrote, [...] "was invincibly English and I {{was much}} consoled during the dark days of 1940 {{by the fact}} that her {{confidence}} in final victory was never shaken."

[...] "I asked you," [...] he said, [...] "because you have never written anything unpleasant about Anglicanism since <b>you</b> <b>became</b> <b>a</b> Roman Catholic." [...] But Lunn could never have written [...] "anything unpleasant" [...] about Mabel's Church, and when the first shock of his conversion was over, [...] "Mabel soon yielded not merely notional but real assent to the belief that the doctrinal differences which separated Mabel the Anglican from Arnold the Catholic were infinitely, yes infinitely, less than those which had separated Mabel the Anglican from Arnold the agnostic." ...|$|E
