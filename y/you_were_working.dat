500|$|At {{the behest}} of XL owner Richard Russell, the xx {{recorded}} their debut album at the label's small, in-house recording studio—XL Studio—making them the first act to record there. It was once the head office building's rear garage before Russell transformed it {{at the beginning of}} 2008 into a makeshift writing, rehearsal, and demo space for XL's artists. McDonald was assigned in September to manage and properly equip the room, which he liked because it was soundproof and [...] "isolated {{from the rest of the}} office, so it wasn't like <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>working</b> in the record company's presence." [...] Croft, on the other hand, called it a [...] "pretty confined space" [...] the size of a bathroom. Over the next few months, McDonald and Pawson prepared a budget for the label to fund the studio's preliminary setup, which would have recording equipment specifically suited for the xx, including a modestly sized soundboard ideal for recording a small group.|$|E

5000|$|Work is no work at all. It is a {{question}} of agency and attachment. When these two are not there, work ceases to be work, it becomes a play, it becomes spontaneous, and it becomes natural.

"No, no, no," [...] she repeated, {{though not}} without an effort, [...] "it is best {{as it is}} settled for all, and decidedly so for me, for with her to write to me about you every day, and to look after you, I shall be a hundred times more at ease than if I thought <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>working</b> {{yourself}} to death {{with no one to}} remonstrate." ...|$|E

And we must remember, grandfather--mind I do not share all Alice's prejudice, and have no inclination in any way to doubt the honesty of my cousin Fred--but at the same time, in bare justice to Frank, we must not forget that Fred was really a rival of his in your affections, and that he would possibly benefit greatly by Frank's disgrace, and, we must also remember that the only evidence against Frank, {{with the exception of the}} circumstantial proof, comes from him.|$|E

The old man must give up his business sometime, {{and he has no}} son; I suppose he'll want a son-in-law who can take to it. But he has rather grasping fingers of his own, I fancy. I daresay he wants a man who can put some money into the business. If I were not as poor as a rat, I would gladly invest some money in that way, for the sake of having you settled on the estate. I'm sure I should profit by it in the end. And perhaps I shall be better off in a year or two. I shall have a larger allowance now I'm of age; and when I've paid off a debt or two, I shall be able to look about me." ...|$|E
6000|$|We {{went into}} the room, taking the flowers with us. The Professor's actions were {{certainly}} odd {{and not to be}} found in any pharmacopeia that I ever heard of. First he fastened up the windows and latched them securely. Next, taking a handful of the flowers, he rubbed them all over the sashes, as though to ensure that every whiff of air that might get in would be laden with the garlic smell. Then with the wisp he rubbed all over the jamb of the door, above, below, and at each side, and round the fireplace in the same way. It all seemed grotesque to me, and presently I said, [...] "Well, Professor, I know you always have a reason for what you do, but this certainly puzzles me.

50|$|There is a {{very great}} {{similarity}} in handling clay and glass.

But the manipulation of a hand-thrown pot {{can be compared to}} blowing a mouth-shaped piece of glass. The opening of the glass is identical to the way clay handles. I only had to watch them make glass for a day or two. It came very naturally.|$|R
6000|$|I {{actually}} met you, my friend, {{for the first}} time that evening, and in trouble too, though you may have forgotten the incident. We had made a mistake about the time of dinner, and arriving half an hour too soon, were shown into a long room that opened on to the verandah. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>working</b> there, being I believe a private secretary at the time, copying some despatch; I think you said that which gave an account of the Annexation. The room was lit by a paraffin lamp behind you, for it was quite dark and the window was open, or at any rate unshuttered. The gentleman who showed us in, seeing that you were very busy, took us to the far end of the room, where we stood talking in the shadow. Just then a door opened opposite to that which led to the verandah, and through it came His Excellency the Administrator, Sir Theophilus Shepstone, a stout man of medium height with a very clever, thoughtful face, as I have always thought, one of the greatest of African statesmen. He did not see us, but he caught sight of you and said testily-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For {{the best}} of reasons. I {{preferred}} tearing it up to throwing it away upon such a man as you! What was the first news that reached me in the morning? Just as my little plan was complete, what did I hear? I heard that you--you!!!--were the foremost person in the house in fetching the police. You were the active man; you were the leader; <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>working</b> harder {{than any of them}} to recover the jewel! You even carried your audacity far enough to ask to speak to ME about the loss of the Diamond--the Diamond which you yourself had stolen; the Diamond which was all the time in your own hands! After that proof of your horrible falseness and cunning, I tore up my letter. But even then--even when I was maddened by the searching and questioning of the policeman, whom you had sent in--even then, there was some infatuation in my mind which wouldn't let me give you up. I said to myself, 'He has played his vile farce before everybody else in the house. Let me try if he can play it before me.' Somebody told me you were on the terrace. I went down to the terrace. I forced myself to look at you; I forced myself to speak to you. Have you forgotten what I said?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Take my advice: {{always look}} cheerful if you can; always {{put your hand}} on the oar when the order is given, and row {{as if you were}} glad to be at work again; and always make a show, as if <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>working</b> your hardest. Never {{complain}} when you are struck unjustly, and always speak respectfully to the overseer. In that way you will find your life much easier than you would think. You will be chosen for small boat service; and that is a great thing, as we are not chained in the small boats. Some men are foolish and obstinate, but, so far from doing any good, this only brings trouble on themselves; they come in for punishment daily, they are closely watched, and their lives made hells for them. Even as a help to escape it pays best to be cheerful and alert. We all think of escape, you know, though it is seldom indeed that a chance ever comes to any of us. It is the one thing except death to look forward to, and there is not a man among us who does not think of it scores of times a day; but, small as the chance is, it is greatest for those who behave best. For instance, it is they only who man small boats; and when a small boat rows ashore, it is always possible that the guard may be careless--that he will keep the boat at the landing place, instead of pushing off at once into deep water, as he ought to do--and that in this way a chance will, sooner or later, come for springing ashore and making a dash for liberty." ...|$|E
