40|$|Abstract Background Every {{company has}} some kind of {{employee}} turnover and we can tell that som business has higher employee turnover than other business. Employee turnover is individual for all companies but in companies that is in the same business simularities can be seen. The employee turnover in the line of business hotel, merchandise trade and restaurants was according to Confederation of Swedish Enterprise closer to 40 % during the period of 2006 - 2007 and close to the business with highest turnover, the service sector. This is comparable to the buildning activity that with it’s 22 % is one of the business with lowest turnover. We have chosen {{to take a look at}} the employee turnover and possible strategies behind it in fast-food restaurants. If they have a strategy, what is it? Purpose: We would like to create an understanding to the turnover in fast food industries and illustrate the different factors that makes the employees leave the industrie. Delivery: To fulfill the purpose, a qualitative study has been made. We have conducted three interviews with the responsible for five different McDonald’s restaurants. Results: We have established there is a strategi behind the turnover for fast-food restaurants. We found this strategy already at the recruitment. The leaders that we have interviewed means there is no thought behind their employee turnover, it’s just a fact. Employees quits and new employees starts. We mean that this is not the case. The strategy that we have found is not an out-spoken strategy. The leaders is already at the recruitment of new employees aware of the fact that everyone can’t advance in the hierarchy there is. They have to find employees who don’t want to advance. Dispite the fact that there is a posibility to make a quick career there is a limited number of higher positions and the leaders must have this in mind when they recruite new employee. They are aware that most of the employees are students at the age of 16 - 18 and most of these employees are going to quit. These employees are often looking for a new workplace or will proceed studying in another city. Above factors makes us say that we have found a strategy behind the employee turnover of fast-food restaurants. To increase or reduce <b>your</b> <b>employee</b> turnover you as a leader should look in to the strategies that you can find in the recruitment. There you can find one of the keys to how you can control <b>your</b> <b>employee</b> turnover. The reason to why employees choose to end their employment can in some ways be affected and if you as a leader find <b>your</b> <b>employee</b> turnover dysfunctional it may be a good idea to investigate the reason to why <b>employees</b> are leaving <b>your</b> organization. ...|$|R
