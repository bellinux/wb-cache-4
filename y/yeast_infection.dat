5|$|In {{women with}} {{cervicitis}} (inflammation of the cervix) or vaginitis (inflammation of the vagina) and in {{young men with}} UTI symptoms, a Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrheae infection may be the cause. These infections are typically classified as a urethritis rather than a urinary tract infection. Vaginitis may also {{be due to a}} <b>yeast</b> <b>infection.</b> Interstitial cystitis (chronic pain in the bladder) may be considered for people who experience multiple episodes of UTI symptoms but urine cultures remain negative and not improved with antibiotics. Prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate) may also be considered in the differential diagnosis.|$|E

25|$|The vagina is {{self-cleansing}} {{and therefore}} usually {{does not need}} special hygiene. Doctors generally discourage the practice of douching for maintaining vulvovaginal health. Since a healthy vagina is colonized by a mutually symbiotic flora of microorganisms that protect its host from disease-causing microbes, any attempt to upset this balance may cause many undesirable outcomes, including {{but not limited to}} abnormal discharge and <b>yeast</b> <b>infection.</b>|$|E
25|$|Topically {{administered}} ketoconazole {{is usually}} prescribed for fungal infections {{of the skin}} and mucous membranes, such as athlete's foot, ringworm, candidiasis (<b>yeast</b> <b>infection</b> or thrush), jock itch, and tinea versicolor. Topical ketoconazole is also used {{as a treatment for}} dandruff (seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp) and for seborrheic dermatitis on other areas of the body, perhaps acting in these conditions by suppressing levels of the fungus Malassezia furfur on the skin.|$|E
25|$|BV {{is caused}} by an {{imbalance}} of the naturally occurring bacteria in the vagina. There {{is a change in}} {{the most common type of}} bacteria and a hundred to thousandfold increase in total numbers of bacteria present. Typically, bacteria other than Lactobacilli become more common. Risk factors include douching, new or multiple sex partners, antibiotics, and using an intrauterine device, among others. However, it is not considered a sexually transmitted infection. Diagnosis is suspected based on the symptoms, and may be verified by testing the vaginal discharge and finding a higher than normal vaginal pH, and large numbers of bacteria. BV is often confused with a vaginal <b>yeast</b> <b>infection</b> or infection with Trichomonas.|$|E

25|$|For HSV-2, {{subclinical}} shedding {{may account}} {{for most of the}} transmission. Studies on discordant partners (one infected with HSV-2, one not) show that the transmission rate is approximately 5 per 10,000 sexual contacts. (Effect of Condoms on Reducing the Transmission of Herpes Simplex Virus Type 2 From Men to Women. A Wald, AGM Langenberg, K Link, et al. JAMA. 2001;285(24):3197) Atypical symptoms are often attributed to other causes such as a <b>yeast</b> <b>infection.</b> HSV-1 is often acquired orally during childhood. It may also be sexually transmitted, including contact with saliva, such as kissing and mouth-to-genital contact (oral sex). HSV-2 is primarily a sexually transmitted infection, but rates of HSV-1 genital infections are increasing.|$|E
25|$|The {{successful}} {{partnership between}} Hazen in New York City and Brown in Albany {{was due in}} part to the efficiency of the United States Postal Service in the 1940s. In her New York City laboratory, Hazen cultured organisms found in soil samples and tested their ability to fight against two fungi: Cryptococcus neoformans, a fungus responsible for the chronic disease cryptococcosis, which affects lungs, skin, and other body parts like the central nervous system, and Candida albicans, which causes candidiasis, which can be minor in some cases (e.g. a vaginal <b>yeast</b> <b>infection),</b> or a serious infection in patients treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. If she found such promising antifungal activity in a particular culture, she would mail it to Brown in a mason jar.|$|E
25|$|Denture-related {{stomatitis}} (also termed denture sore mouth, denture stomatitis, chronic atrophic candidiasis, Candida-associated denture induced stomatitis, and denture-associated erythematous stomatitis) is {{a common}} condition where mild inflammation and redness of the oral mucous membrane occurs beneath a denture. In about 90% of cases, Candida species are involved, which are normally a harmless component of the oral microbiota in many people. Denture-related stomatitis {{is the most common}} form of oral candidiasis (a <b>yeast</b> <b>infection</b> of the mouth). It is more common in elderly people, and in those who wear a complete upper denture (a denture which replaces all the upper teeth, worn by someone with no natural teeth in their upper jaw). Denture-related stomatitis is more likely to develop when the denture is left constantly in the mouth, rather than removing it during sleep, and when the denture is not cleaned regularly.|$|E

25|$|Masturbation among {{adolescents}} contributes to them developing {{a sense of}} mastery over sexual impulses, {{and it has a}} role in the physical and emotional development of prepubescents and pubescents. Babies and toddlers will play with their genitals {{in much the same way}} as they play with their ears or toes. If such play becomes all-consuming, it may be necessary to look for an underlying cause of this, such as the child being tense and in need of comfort, or that others may be overreacting and thus reinforcing the habit. It could be caused by a low-grade urinary tract or <b>yeast</b> <b>infection,</b> or the child may be overstimulated and in need of soothing, or indeed understimulated and bored. Alongside many other factors, such as medical evidence, age-inappropriate sexual knowledge, sexualized play or aggression, and precocious or seductive behavior, excessive masturbation may alternatively be an indicator of sexual abuse.|$|E
25|$|Rask {{apparently}} {{suffered from}} symptoms of Pre-AIDS starting in late 1974, including diarrhea, swollen lymph nodes, weight loss, and fatigue. Although the symptoms receded temporarily following drug treatments in 1975, the symptoms later grew considerably worse. Following {{a vacation in}} South Africa in July 1977, {{she could no longer}} breathe and relied on bottled oxygen. She flew back to Denmark, where tests at Copenhagen's Rigshospitalet discovered she had contracted a number of opportunistic infections, such as Staphylococcus aureus (staph infection), candidiasis (<b>yeast</b> <b>infection),</b> and Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP, a fungal infection of the lungs formerly known as Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia). Tests also showed that Rask had a nearly non-existent T-cell count, leading to a severely depressed immune system. At the time, the doctors treating Rask were at a loss to explain her disease progression, which in retrospect, would come to be seen {{as one of the first}} cases of AIDS recorded outside Africa.|$|E

500|$|Within the {{genitourinary}} and gastrointestinal tracts, commensal flora {{serve as}} biological barriers by competing with pathogenic bacteria {{for food and}} space and, in some cases, by changing the conditions in their environment, such as pH or available iron. As {{a result of the}} symbiotic relationship between commensals and the immune system, the probability that pathogens will reach sufficient numbers to cause illness is reduced. However, since most antibiotics non-specifically target bacteria and do not affect fungi, oral antibiotics can lead to an [...] "overgrowth" [...] of fungi and cause conditions such as a vaginal candidiasis (a <b>yeast</b> <b>infection).</b> There is good evidence that re-introduction of probiotic flora, such as pure cultures of the lactobacilli normally found in unpasteurized yogurt, helps restore a healthy balance of microbial populations in intestinal infections in children and encouraging preliminary data in studies on bacterial gastroenteritis, inflammatory bowel diseases, urinary tract infection and post-surgical infections.|$|E
500|$|During one scene, Wendy tells Stan {{that she}} smelled Ms. Ellen taking a [...] "smelly dump" [...] in the {{bathroom}} {{in an attempt to}} make him less attracted to her. In the original script, Wendy originally told Stan that she had a <b>yeast</b> <b>infection,</b> but Comedy Central censors made Parker and Stone change the line. Parker and Stone said although the network typically provides great leniency in permitting obscene jokes, they often object to lines about female hygiene problems. During a cafeteria scene, a boy visible at a lunch table in the background looks exactly like Craig Tucker, but the color of his hat has been changed to make him appear to be a different character. The idea of Ms. Ellen taking one of the children to dinner came from Parker's real-life experiences. At his school, the children were able to have lunch with the teacher and principal if they were awarded [...] "Student of the Week". Parker said he went on one of the lunches once and found the experience [...] "really, really creepy" [...] because he had the impression the teacher and principal were having a romantic affair.|$|E

30|$|In {{pediatric}} oncology units, there often are more <b>yeast</b> <b>infections</b> than mold infections. In {{the study by}} Mor et al. [10], concerning 75 children with IFI and malignancy pathologies, positive blood cultures for yeast were obtained in 100 % of infected cases. The main underlying diagnoses associated with <b>yeast</b> <b>infections</b> were acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and neuroblastoma (26.7 % each); five patients (older than aged 15 years, with invasive <b>yeast</b> <b>infections)</b> underwent hematologic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Sung et al. [27] performed {{a survey of the}} available data from the pediatric cancer population (more specifically patients with AML) and IFI. They reported that during the induction and consolidation phases of treatment, respectively, 10 % and 6 % of children developed Candida infection. In this study, Candida spp. represented 25.9 % of infection-related mortality (overall 11 % ± - 2 %). The authors observed {{that in the case of}} intensive timing induction phase, compared with standard timing induction, the rate of <b>yeast</b> <b>infections</b> can increase 2.5 -fold (8.4 % vs. 19 %; p < 0.01). So, the timing of the chemotherapy, regardless of dose, has an impact on the patient's risk for developing IFI. In children hospitalized in the PICU, the existence of an underlying malignancy is very important and increases from 17.5 % to 46 % the predicted probability of ICI [3].|$|R
