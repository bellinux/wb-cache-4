500|$|Many {{fans were}} unhappy with Doggett's condescension towards Scully during her apology. Robert Patrick, {{the actor who}} portrayed Doggett, however, had a {{different}} interpretation: [...] "The whole essence of the scene was, 'Look, I'm here for you. I've got your back. We're partners now.' And you give that {{the weight of a}} marine saying to someone, 'I'll jump on a grenade for you, so <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>trust</b> me.' The idea was to really assure the fans that the show was continuing on." ...|$|E

She stated: [...] "(I was) one of those kids... holding everything inside... internalizing everything. And that really can affect you, and feeling helpless and hopeless, and finding that person that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>trust,</b> that adult, like I did later on in life, that I felt comfortable and safe to tell my issues, my worries, my pains, my aches to. This is what the Trevor Project is really all about. And they have a 24-hour hotline... There's someone there that you can speak with 24 hours that will be there for you." [...] She made an official It Gets Better video which was released on December 1, 2010.|$|E
2500|$|Whilst {{at first}} {{appearing}} as an immature prankster, Lionel's second stint saw the character {{develop into a}} more sensitive character with [...] "little-boy-lost" [...] vulnerability. John Leigh described Lionel as likeable, stating; [...] "Lionel is this great trier. That's why people have latched on to him. He doesn't have all the swankiness of the doctors – their money and their looks. A lot of people always see themselves as falling a bit short of the mark and everyone does in some way. People identity with this struggle." [...] Leigh {{found it difficult to}} understand how Lionel attracted women, saying, [...] "Lionel is the sort of person you want to meet when you're ready to settle down. He's a nice guy. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>trust</b> him. He can cook. He can fix things. None of these things is exciting to a young woman." ...|$|E

2500|$|The New Republic writer James Kirchick {{accused the}} network of [...] "often virulent anti-Americanism, worshipful {{portrayal}} of Russian leaders." [...] Edward Lucas wrote in The Economist (quoted in Al Jazeera English) that the core of RT was [...] "anti-Westernism." [...] Julia Ioffe wrote [...] "Often, it seemed that Russia Today was {{just a way to}} stick it to the U.S. from behind the façade of legitimate newsgathering." [...] Shaun Walker wrote in The Independent that RT [...] "has made a name for itself as a strident critic of US policy." [...] Allesandra Stanley wrote in The New York Times that RT is [...] "like the Voice of America, only with more money and a zesty anti-American slant." [...] David Weigel writes that RT goes further than merely creating distrust of the United States government, to saying, in effect: [...] "You can trust the Russians more than <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>trust</b> those bastards." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although McKenna avoided {{giving his}} {{allegiance}} {{to any one}} interpretation (part of his rejection of monotheism), he was open {{to the idea of}} psychedelics as being [...] "trans-dimensional travel". He proposed that DMT sent one to a [...] "parallel dimension" [...] and that psychedelics literally enabled an individual to encounter 'higher dimensional entities' or what could be ancestors or spirits of the Earth, saying that if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>trust</b> your own perceptions it appears that you are entering an [...] "ecology of souls." [...] McKenna also put forward the idea that psychedelics were [...] "doorways into the Gaian mind", suggesting that [...] "the planet has a kind of intelligence, it can actually open a channel of communication with an individual human being" [...] and that the psychedelic plants were the facilitators of this communication. In a more radical version of biophysicist Francis Crick's hypothesis of directed panspermia, McKenna speculated on the idea that psilocybin mushrooms may be a species of high intelligence, which may have arrived on this planet as spores migrating through space and which are attempting to establish a symbiotic relationship with human beings. He postulated that [...] "intelligence, not life, but intelligence may have come here [...] in this spore-bearing life form". He said, [...] "I think that theory will probably be vindicated. I think in a hundred years if people do biology they will think it quite silly that people once thought that spores could not be blown from one star system to another by cosmic radiation pressure," [...] and also believed that [...] "few people {{are in a position to}} judge its extraterrestrial potential, because few people in the orthodox sciences have ever experienced the full spectrum of psychedelic effects that are unleashed." ...|$|E
