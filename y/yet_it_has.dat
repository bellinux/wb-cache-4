5|$|The Milky Way {{passes through}} much of Canis Minor, <b>yet</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> few deep-sky objects. William Herschel {{recorded}} four objects in his 1786 work Catalogue of Nebulae and Clusters of Stars, including two he mistakenly believed were star clusters. NGC 2459 {{is a group of}} five thirteenth- and fourteenth-magnitude stars that appear to lie close together in the sky but are not related. A similar situation has occurred with NGC 2394, also in Canis Minor. This is a collection of fifteen unrelated stars of ninth-magnitude and fainter.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{found only}} {{on the island of}} Virgin Gorda, it has since been {{reported}} on Tortola and Moskito Island. Its range is sometimes estimated to encompass the entire British Virgin Islands, although the original expedition by Thomas did not find any specimens on Tortola, Anegada, or other smaller islands, nor in the United States Virgin Islands of Saint Croix, Saint Thomas, and Saint John. Its distribution is considered unusual because despite being separated from its closest relative, S.nicholsi in Puerto Rico, another species, the Puerto Rican Crested Toad (Bufo lemur), has a geographic range that includes both islands, <b>yet</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> not diverged.|$|E
5|$|Another {{argument}} for sociality {{is based on}} the healed injuries in several Smilodon fossils, which would suggest that the animals needed others to provide it food. This argument has been questioned, as cats can recover quickly from even severe bone damage and an injured Smilodon could survive if it had access to water. The brain of Smilodon was relatively small compared to other cat species. Some researchers have argued that Smilodons brain would have been too small for it to have been a social animal. An analysis of brain size in living big cats found no correlation between brain size and sociality. Another argument against Smilodon being social is that being an ambush hunter in closed habitat would likely have made group-living unnecessary, as in most modern cats. <b>Yet</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> also been proposed that being the largest predator in an environment comparable to the savanna of Africa, Smilodon may have had a social structure similar to modern lions, which possibly live in groups primarily to defend optimal territory from other lions (lions are the only social big cats today).|$|E

5|$|The Parliament and Council {{have been}} {{compared}} to the two chambers of a bicameral legislature. However, there are some differences from national legislatures; for example, neither the Parliament nor the Council have the power of legislative initiative (except {{for the fact that}} the Council has the power in some intergovernmental matters). In Community matters, this is a power uniquely reserved for the European Commission (the executive). Therefore, while Parliament can amend and reject legislation, to make a proposal for legislation, it needs the Commission to draft a bill before anything can become law. The value of such a power has been questioned by noting that in the national legislatures of the member states 85% of initiatives introduced without executive support fail to become law. <b>Yet</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> been argued by former Parliament president Hans-Gert Pöttering that as the Parliament does have the right to ask the Commission to draft such legislation, and as the Commission is following Parliament's proposals more and more Parliament does have a de facto right of legislative initiative.|$|E
25|$|Deforestation {{may follow}} a Kuznets curve (cf. forest {{transition}} curve). Among countries with {{a per capita}} GDP of at least $4,600, net deforestation has ceased to exist. <b>Yet</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> been argued that wealthier countries are able to maintain forests along with high consumption by ‘exporting’ deforestation.|$|E

The Explorer is used extensively {{in an air}} ambulance capacity throughout the UK, but is gradually being phased out of service for renewal purposes. It has five rotor blades to ensure a smooth flight which can prove particularly beneficial for patients suffering head or spinal injuries. Twin turbine engines give it a cruising speed of , and skid landing gear allows it to cope with all types of terrain.

25|$|Both the Indian and Pakistani governments {{condemned}} the attack, and officials {{on both sides}} speculated that the perpetrators intended to disrupt improving {{relations between the two}} nations, since the attack came just a day before Pakistani Foreign Minister Khurshid Mahmud Kasuri was to arrive in New Delhi to resume peace talks with Indian leaders.

As of 2011, nobody has been charged for the crime <b>yet.</b> <b>It</b> <b>has</b> been allegedly linked to Abhinav Bharat, a Hindu fundamentalist group in India. Other allegations also concurred on Lashkar-e-Taiba. A United States report declared Arif Qasmani to be involved in the attack. Consequently, after consulting with the United Nations, the United States declared him an international terrorist.|$|E
25|$|With its ancestry {{going back}} to the horse bus days of the 1880s, Chelverton Road Garage was {{converted}} to a motor-bus garage in 1912. The garage is well hidden in a side road with a modest frontage, <b>yet</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> an allocation of 112. It has been modernised twice, firstly in 1935 and then again in 1985. The garage was well known for being allocated the pre-war RTs in 1940 which displaced the STLs. During the war the garage was underutilised and was used to store de-licensed buses. Renamed Putney in 1963 after the closure of Putney Bridge garage (F) it started to receive both short and long wheelbase AEC Routemasters for its central London routes. The Routemasters remained at the garage until July 2005 when both the 14 and 22 were converted to low floor one-person-operated buses.|$|E

25|$|The team {{reported}} that they had been able to identify compound nuclei fissioning with half-lives > 10−18 s. This result suggests a strong stabilizing effect at Z=124 and points to the next proton shell at Z>120, not at Z=114 as previously thought. A compound nucleus is a loose combination of nucleons that have not arranged themselves into nuclear shells <b>yet.</b> <b>It</b> <b>has</b> no internal structure and is held together only by the collision forces between the target and projectile nuclei. It is estimated that it requires around 10−14s for the nucleons to arrange themselves into nuclear shells, at which point the compound nucleus becomes a nuclide, and this number is used by IUPAC as the minimum half-life a claimed isotope must have to potentially be recognised as being discovered. Thus, the GANIL experiments do not count as a discovery of element 124.|$|E
25|$|The Culture has {{achieved}} artificial intelligences where each Mind has thought processing capabilities many {{orders of magnitude}} beyond that of human beings, and data storage drives which, if written out on paper and stored in filing cabinets, would cover thousands of planets skyscraper high (as described by one Mind in Consider Phlebas). <b>Yet</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> managed to condense these entities to a volume of several dozen cubic metres (though much of the contents and the operating structure are continually in hyperspace). Minds also demonstrate reaction times and multitasking abilities orders of magnitude greater than any sentient being; armed engagements between Culture and equivalent technological civilizations sometimes occur in timeframes as short as microseconds, and standard Orbital Minds are capable of running all of the vital systems on the Orbital while simultaneously conversing with millions of the inhabitants and observing phenomena in the surrounding regions of space.|$|E
25|$|The family Megalosauridae {{was first}} defined by Thomas Huxley in 1869, <b>yet</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> been contested {{throughout}} history {{due to its}} role as a ‘waste-basket’ for many partially described dinosaurs or unidentified remains. In the early years of paleontology, most large theropods were grouped together and up to 48 species were included in the clade Megalosauria, the basal clade of Megalosauridae. Over time, most of these taxa were placed in other clades and the parameters of Megalosauridae were narrowed significantly. However, some controversy remains over whether Megalosauridae should be considered its own distinct group, and dinosaurs in this family remain some of the most problematic taxa in all Dinosauria. Some paleontologists, such as Paul Sereno in 2005, have disregarded the group due to its shaky foundation and lack of clarified phylogeny. However, recent research by Carrano, Benson, and Sampson has systematically analyzed all basal tetanurans and determined that Megalosauridae should exist as its own family.|$|E

25|$|On April 11, 2013, Zuckerberg led {{the launch}} of a 501(c)(4) {{lobbying}} group called FWD.us. The founders and contributors to the group were primarily Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and investors, and its president was Joe Green, {{a close friend of}} Zuckerberg. The goals of the group include immigration reform, improving the state of education in the United States, and enabling more technological breakthroughs that benefit the public, <b>yet</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> also been criticized for financing ads advocating a variety of oil and gas development initiatives, including drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the Keystone XL pipeline. In 2013, numerous liberal and progressive groups, such as The League of Conservation Voters, MoveOn.org, the Sierra Club, Democracy for America, CREDO, Daily Kos, 350.org, and Presente and Progressives United agreed to either pull their Facebook ad buys or not buy Facebook ads for at least two weeks, in protest of Zuckerberg ads funded by FWD.us that were in support of oil drilling and the Keystone XL pipeline, and in opposition to Obamacare among Republican United States senators who back immigration reform.|$|E
500|$|Frank Marshall remarked, [...] "In today's {{information}} age, secrecy {{has been}} a real challenge. ... People actually said, 'No, we're going to respect Steven's vision.'" [...] Prior to release, moviegoers on the Internet scrutinized numerous photos and the film's promotional LEGO sets in hope of understanding plot details; Spielberg biographer Ian Freer wrote, [...] "What Indy IV is actually about has been the great cultural guessing game of 2007/08. <b>Yet,</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> to be said, there is something refreshing about being ten weeks away from a giant blockbuster and knowing next to nothing about it." [...] To distract investigative fans from the film's title during filming, five fake titles were registered with the Motion Picture Association of America; The City of Gods, The Destroyer of Worlds, The Fourth Corner of the Earth, The Lost City of Gold and The Quest for the Covenant. Lucas and Spielberg had also wanted to keep Karen Allen's return a secret until the film's release, but decided to confirm it at the 2007 Comic-Con.|$|E
500|$|There {{was in any}} case, as art {{historian}} Jeanette Hoorn wryly observed, [...] "no market for post-impressionist painting in outback New South Wales in the 1920s". Rix Nicholas sought to build on her existing success and often focussed on portraits, while her approach to her subject matter became [...] "more and more didactic". Women were frequently portrayed, both as rural workers (as in The Fair Musterer) and in domestic or family scenes (as in On The Hilltop). Several images, such as On the Hilltop and Spring Afternoon, Knockalong portray women caring for a young son in a rural setting. Her most [...] "stereotypically feminine" [...] work was The Summer House, which shows two of Rix Nicholas's friends with some freshly cut flowers, in a setting that, unlike most of her works of the period, screened out the surrounding landscape. It was a picture about which Rix Nicholas was never convinced and which she never publicly displayed. <b>Yet</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> become one of her best known works, its easy acceptance consistent with the way reviewers in the 1930s pigeon-holed her work in terms of conventional gender roles.|$|E
