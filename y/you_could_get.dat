[...] Robert Corell, chairman of the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment was also impressed. [...] "I sat there and I'm amazed at how thorough and accurate. After the presentation I said, 'Al, I'm absolutely blown away. There's a lot of details <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> wrong.'...I could find no error." [...] Michael Shermer, scientific author and founder of The Skeptics Society, wrote in Scientific American that Gore's slide show [...] "shocked {{me out of my}} doubting stance." [...] Eric Steig, a climate scientist writing on RealClimate, lauded the film's science as [...] "remarkably up to date, with reference to some of the very latest research." ...|$|E
500|$|Grey Anatomy {{has been}} {{considered}} an impact on culture by Entertainment Weekly executive editor, Lori Majewski, with her writing: [...] "Grey's Anatomy isn't just a show, it's a phenomenon. When [...] final shows air, every place in New York City is empty. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> a table at the best restaurants." [...] The Daily Beast Jace Lacob also considered the show an impact, comparing its success to that of Friends, and calling it a [...] "cultural phenomenon". Steve Sternberg, a media analyst with Magna Global USA explained that the show appeals to a broad audience, writing: [...] "Roughly 80 percent of households during prime time only have one TV set on. People are looking for shows they can watch with other household members." [...] Grey's Anatomy introduced a [...] "mc-labeling" [...] surge, ever since it dubbed Dempsey's character [...] "McDreamy". Canadian newspaper the National Post considers this trend a [...] "phenomenon".|$|E
500|$|Unlike {{the test}} audience, {{television}} critics generally reacted positively to the pilot, viewing it as original and innovative, USA Today critic Tom Green summarized {{the show as}} a [...] "crisply funny blend of stand-up routines interwoven with more traditional sitcom stuff". Eric Mink of St. Louis Post-Dispatch wrote he thought the show was unusual and intriguing, yet [...] "quite funny". Joe Stein of the San Diego Evening Tribune commented [...] "Not all standup comedians fit into a sitcom format, but Seinfeld does". A more negative response came from a The Fresno Bee critic, that stated [...] "I liked the concept, but Seinfeld 's jokes were so dull that you hoped the standup stuff would fly by so <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> back to the story". Though the critic praised Alexander's acting he commented that his performance {{was not enough to}} keep the show [...] "from being just another piece of summer drivel offered up by a major commercial network".|$|E

500|$|Hartley {{is quick}} to point out that before [...] "Justice", the series did not focus on [...] "the costumes and the capes, the flying and the superhero stuff", because they have their [...] "no flights, no tights" [...] rule in effect. That changed with [...] "Justice", and Hartley {{suggested}} that the actors really had to commit themselves to their roles while wearing the costumes, [...] "otherwise you look like a standup comedian who doesn't like his jokes very much". Young stated that he was one of the luckiest out of the group, because he only had to wear a silver vest and regular pants, unlike Ritchson, who had to put on a [...] "onesie Speedo". Ritchson felt <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> distracted by what you were wearing, but it was best to try to take your mind off of the subject. Hartley, Ritchson, and Young stated that they felt sorry for Gallner for having to wear a costume that they believed [...] "sucked". The group described Gallner's costume as something his mom might have made with [...] "some cotton fabric and a Magic Marker".|$|E
500|$|As Pei, {{neared the}} end of his {{secondary}} education, he decided to study at a university. He was accepted to a number of schools, but decided to enroll at the University of Pennsylvania. Pei's choice had two roots. While studying in Shanghai, he had closely examined the catalogs for various institutions of higher learning around the world. The architectural program at the University of Pennsylvania stood out to him. The other major factor was Hollywood. Pei was fascinated by the representations of college life in the films of Bing Crosby, which differed tremendously from the academic atmosphere in China. [...] "College life in the U.S. {{seemed to me to be}} mostly fun and games", he said in 2000. [...] "Since I was too young to be serious, I wanted to be part of it... <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> a feeling for it in Bing Crosby's movies. College life in America seemed very exciting to me. It's not real, we know that. Nevertheless, at that time it was very attractive to me. I decided that was the country for me." ...|$|E
500|$|It {{was ranked}} tenth on Rolling Stones list of [...] "The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time", with the summary, [...] "Charles' grunt-'n'-groan exchanges with the Raeletts were the closest <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> {{to the sound}} of orgasm on Top Forty radio during the Eisenhower era". In 2000, it ranked number 43 on VH1's 100 Greatest Songs in Rock and Roll and number 96 on VH1's 100 Greatest Dance Songs, being the oldest song in the latter ranking. The same year it was chosen by National Public Radio as one of the 100 most {{influential}} songs of the 20th century. A central scene in the 2004 biopic Ray features the improvisation of the song performed by Jamie Foxx, who won an Academy Award for his portrayal of Charles. For its historical, artistic, and cultural significance, the Library of Congress added it to the U.S. National Recording Registry in 2002. The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame featured it as one of 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll in 2007.|$|E

500|$|While Dykstra's team {{handled the}} ships, the V'Ger cloud was {{developed}} by Trumbull. Trumbull wanted the cloud to have a specific shape to it—"it couldn't just be a blob of cotton," [...] he said, [...] "it had to have some shape that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> camera angles on." [...] A special camera support track was built that could pan and focus over a [...] piece of art, with the light strobed to provide depth. While the team planned on compositing multiple passes to provide physical movement to the cloud shots, Trumbull felt that it detracted from the sense of scale, and so small animations were subtly introduced in the final product. The torpedo effects were simulated by shooting a laser through a piece of crystal mounted on a rotating rod after experiments with Tesla coils proved insufficient. The same effect was recolored and used for the Klingons and the Enterprise; the aliens' torpedoes glowed red while the [...] "good guys" [...] had blue-colored weaponry. V'Ger's destruction of the ships was created using scanning lasers, with the multiple laser passes composited onto the moving model to create the final effect.|$|E
500|$|In June 2014, Ruffalo said he {{believed}} the studio might be considering doing a new standalone Hulk film, saying, [...] "I think they are, for the first time, entertaining the idea of it. When we did The Avengers it was basically 'No!', and now there is some consideration for it. But there's still nothing definitive, not even a skeletal version {{of what it would}} be." [...] In July, Feige stated that the studio was not considering a [...] "Planet Hulk" [...] film at that time, due to wanting to feature Ruffalo's Banner in the film. However, he did not rule out a story that saw the Hulk and Banner end up in space and explained why a solo Hulk film did not occur in Phase Two of the MCU, by saying, [...] "After the first Avengers, Iron Man had his own movie, Thor had his own movie, Captain America had his own movie, and Widow and Fury were in [...] So it was really about, frankly, saving somebody so that the only place <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> Hulk between Avengers movies is the next Avengers movie, so [...] could continue to play with that in [...] Where we go after that, we'll see." [...] In October 2014, again on a solo film, Feige said [...] "we'll see. We'd love to do it, we'd love to find the place to put it, but right now, Hulk will be appearing, with his friends, in their [...] films." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{race was}} met by anti-Trump protests in the first-stage {{finishing}} town of New Paltz, New York, where demonstrators held placards reading [...] "Fight Trumpism", [...] "Die Yuppie $cum", [...] "The Art of the Deal = The Rich Get Richer" [...] and [...] "Trump = Lord of the Flies". The 1989 race was won by the Norwegian rider Dag Otto Lauritzen of the American team 7-Eleven, although there was some controversy about the result as Belgian rider Eric Vanderaerden, who had won four stages and was expected {{to take the lead}} in the general classification in the final stage time trial in Atlantic City but took a wrong turn following a race motorbike. The Soviet rider Viatcheslav Ekimov, who took part as an amateur, won the first stage of the race (following a prologue time trial). Articles published the following year reported that Ekimov [...] "had had the nerve to win a stage as an amateur... and some pros reportedly rewarded him by jamming a feed bag into his wheel", and that he [...] "threatened to win the Tour de Trump last year as an amateur before the pros banded together to eliminate any chance he had of winning". Nonetheless, the first edition of the race was described as [...] "a smashing success" [...] in Sports Illustrated, which noted: [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> past the name, the Tour de Trump, without losing your lunch, and if you could somehow divorce the sporting event from the excess baggage that went with it... what you had was a pretty nice bicycle race".|$|E

500|$|In April 1994, {{the label}} {{arranged}} her {{to fly to}} London and meet with producer Tom Bailey. They recorded the songs [...] "I Want You", [...] "Fly" [...] and [...] "Just Like Honey", which was later re-recorded by Keith Fernley of Bailey's group Babble with {{a different set of}} lyrics and became the song [...] "Father's Field". Lords used lyrics she had previously written in New Zealand based on her personal journals she kept since she was a child. After finishing her recording with Bailey, Lords wanted something with a harder edge to add another dimension to her album. She was introduced to producer Ben Watkins of the electronic group Juno Reactor and decided to incorporate more rave sound. Mainly inspired by the music she would hear at warehouse parties during her stay in London, Lords teamed up with American singer Wonder with whom she created the lyrics to the song [...] "Control". Lords later commented on the inspiration behind the album's sound: [...] "It was in England that I fell in love with techno music. I was working in the UK doing some modelling a couple of years ago, and I was sharing a flat with some other girls in South London. We were really broke, and the cheapest place to go and have a good night out were raves - <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> in for about three bucks. So I went to a lot of raves and clubs, and I {{fell in love with the}} music - it was something that wasn't happening in the States at the time." [...] Lords recorded three more songs with Watkins; [...] "Good-N-Evil", [...] "Outlaw Lover" [...] and [...] "Fallen Angel".|$|E
500|$|Production {{designer}} Carey Meyer {{built the}} ship Serenity {{in two parts}} (one for each level) as a complete set with ceilings and practical lighting installed {{as part of the}} set that the cameras could use along with moveable parts. The two-part set also allowed the second unit to shoot in one section while the actors and first unit worked undisturbed in the other. As Whedon recalled: [...] "...you could pull it away or move something huge, so that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> in and around everything. That meant the environment worked for us and there weren't a lot of adjustments that needed to be made." [...] There were other benefits to this set design. One was that it allowed the viewers to feel they were really in a ship. For Whedon, the design of the ship was crucial in defining the known space for the viewer, and that there were not [...] "fourteen hundred decks and a holodeck and an all-you-can-eat buffet in the back". He wanted to convey that it was utilitarian and that it was [...] "beat-up but lived-in and ultimately, it was home". As Joss Whedon discusses in the DVD commentary, each room represented a feeling or character, usually conveyed by the paint color. He explains that as you move {{from the back of the}} ship in the engine room, toward the front of the ship to the bridge, the colors and mood progress from extremely warm to cooler. Besides evoking a mood associated with the character who spends most time in each area, the color scheme also alludes to the heat generated in the tail of the ship.|$|E

2500|$|The Charger's {{interior}} {{was different from}} all other cars with its pseudo-bucket back seats folded down to interior space accessible via the rear hatch.

2500|$|The murals, {{owned by}} the New York City Housing Authority, are on loan to the Brooklyn Museum.

2500|$|Bing {{later said}} that Callas {{was the most}} {{difficult}} artist he ever worked with, [...] "because she was so much more intelligent. Other artists, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> around. But Callas you could not get around. She knew exactly what she wanted, and why she wanted it." [...] Despite this, Bing's admiration for Callas never wavered, and in September 1959, he sneaked into La Scala in order to listen to Callas record La Gioconda for EMI. Callas and Bing reconciled in the mid 1960s, and Callas returned to the Met for two performances of Tosca with her friend Tito Gobbi.|$|E

According to Roland Challis, the BBC {{correspondent}} who was in Singapore at the time, journalists were open to manipulation by IRD due to Sukarno's stubborn refusal to allow them into the country: [...] "In a curious way, by keeping correspondents {{out of the country}} Sukarno made them the victims of official channels, because almost the only information <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> was from the British ambassador in Jakarta." ...|$|E
