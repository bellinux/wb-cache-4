2500|$|In 2004, Knight reprised {{the role}} of Ruth in Pirates with the Lyric Opera of Chicago. [...] Chicago radio host Bruce Duffie, {{interviewing}} Knight after seeing that production noted, [...] "Gillian Knight {{is one of those}} great personalities who simply go about their business season after season, giving splendid renditions of various roles, and adding luster to their home companies while not going far afield very often and, thus, passing up the opportunity for real world-wide stardom". During that interview, Knight said, [...] "I'm getting a bit controversial here, but there is a snobbish attitude towards Gilbert and Sullivan in the opera world.... I believe in excellence. [...] Now I believe that if Gilbert and Sullivan is done well... then it is excellent, and it should be in a [...] house". [...] She advised audiences, [...] "Don't close your mind to anything because somebody has said, 'Oh, this is Gilbert and Sullivan,' or, 'This is modern music.' [...] Just keep an open mind and <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> at how much you get out of it".|$|E

60|$|As a {{footnote}} <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> {{that one of}} the children is called Junkie.

[...] "Now with {{reference}} to this young man, I watched him coming down the steps from his office this morning. <b>You</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> to hear, Captain, that I found him unprepossessing--in fact I might almost say that I took a dislike to him." ...|$|E

I think I ought to prepare you to receive a person whom <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> to see.

When you hear how cruelly the poor girl has been used, I am sure you will sympathize with her as I do." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>You</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> at my {{knowledge}} of these details. Well, I had them ultimately from Mrs Fyne. Mrs Fyne while yet Miss Anthony, in her days of bondage, knew Mrs de Barral in her days of exile. Mrs de Barral was living then in a big stone mansion with mullioned windows in a large damp park, called the Priory, adjoining the village where the refined poet had built himself a house.|$|E

60|$|<b>You</b> <b>may</b> {{possibly}} <b>be</b> <b>surprised,</b> Sir, at such {{a letter}} from me; 'tis, I own, in the usual way of calculating these matters, more than our acquaintance entitles me to; but my answer is short: Of all the men at your time of life whom I knew in Edinburgh, {{you are the most}} accessible on the side on which I have assailed you. You are very much altered indeed from what you were when I knew you, if generosity point the path you will not tread, or humanity call to you in vain.|$|R

60|$|Perhaps <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> at my {{talking of}} labour and the workman. You {{have heard of}} me, I fear, {{through the medium of}} your {{somewhat}} imaginative newspapers as, if not a 'Japanese young man,' at least a young man to whom the rush and clamour and reality of the modern world were distasteful, and whose greatest difficulty in life was the difficulty of living up to the level of his blue china - a paradox from which England has not yet recovered.|$|E
6000|$|The couple {{made big}} eyes at this, and then I told them of my {{meeting with the}} girl. <b>You</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> but I assure you I had not {{perceived}} this aspect of it till that very moment. It was like a startling revelation; the past throwing a sinister light on the future. Fyne opened his mouth gravely and as gravely shut it. Nothing more. Mrs Fyne said, [...] "You had better go," [...] with an air as if her self-possession had been pricked with a pin in some secret place.|$|E
60|$|DEAR HENLEY, - <b>You</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> to {{hear that}} I am now a great writer of verses; that is, however, so. I have the mania now like my betters, and faith, if I live till I am forty, I shall have a book of rhymes like Pollock, Gosse, or whom you please. Really, I have begun to learn some of the rudiments of that trade, and have written three or four pretty enough pieces of octosyllabic nonsense, semi-serious, semi-smiling. A kind of prose Herrick, {{divested}} of the gift of verse, and you behold the Bard. But I like it.|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{this case}} {{there is no}} {{necessity}} {{to enter into the}} question," [...] the doctor answered. [...] "The boy's lapse of memory refers, as I told you, to his past life--that is to say, his life when his intellect was deranged. During the extraordinary interval of sanity that has now declared itself, he is putting his mental powers to their first free use; and none of them fail him, so far as I can see. His new memory (if I may call it so) preserves the knowledge of what has happened since his illness. <b>You</b> <b>may</b> imagine how this problem in brain disease interests me; and you will not wonder that I am going back to Sandsworth tomorrow afternoon, when I have done with my professional visits. But <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> reasonably <b>surprised</b> at my troubling you with details which are mainly interesting to a medical man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 10. I {{have just}} had a {{remarkable}} proof of the total want of this feeling in the modern mind. I was staying part of this summer in Turin, {{for the purpose of}} studying one of the Paul Veroneses there--the presentation of the Queen of Sheba to Solomon. Well, one of the most notable characters in this picture is the splendor of its silken dresses: and, in particular, there was a piece of white brocade, with designs upon it in gold, which it was one of my chief objects in stopping at Turin to copy. <b>You</b> <b>may,</b> perhaps, <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> at this; but I must just note in passing, that I share this weakness of enjoying dress patterns with all good students and all good painters. It doesn't matter what school they belong to,--Fra Angelico, Perugino, John Bellini, Giorgione, Titian, Tintoret, Veronese, Leonardo da Vinci--no matter how they differ in other respects, all of them like dress patterns; and what is more, the nobler the painter is, the surer he is to do his patterns well.|$|R
5000|$|In Calistus Mulvaney's {{entry in}} the 1910 United States Census (pictured at right), his {{occupation}} is listed as [...] "billiard hall employee" [...] and his position there as [...] "keeper". As {{part of the same}} household, Mulvaney's brother-in-law's listing appears on the same census page, with his occupation and position identically recorded. The census records Mulvaney's age in 1910 as 56, his birthdate as [...] "about 1854", his birthplace as Wisconsin, his spouse's name as Kate, and his area of residence at that time as Chicago Ward 14, Cook Co., Illinois. Although there is a given-name discrepancy, additional illumination is provided by Simpson M. Ritter in the publication From the Annals of Sports. As Simpson is quoted in the book Sports in the Pulp Magazines by John A. Dinan: <b>You</b> <b>may</b> not <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> to learn that Kelly Pool was neither invented by a man named Kelly nor is it of Irish origin. Its inventor, Celestus Mulvaney, was of Irish origin but invented the game in 1893 in Chicago. The first games were played in that city at the Hannah and Hoggs Billiard Hall on Madison St. Simpson M.

'We have Ernest Le Breton {{down here}} now,' Oswald wrote, 'on a holiday from the Exmoors', and <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> {{to hear that}} I shall {{probably}} have him sooner or later for a brother-in-law. He has proposed to and been accepted by my sister Edith; and though it is likely, as things stand at present, to be a rather long engagement (for Le Breton has nothing to marry upon), we are all very much pleased about it here at Calcombe. He is just the exact man I should wish my sister to marry; so pleasant and good and clever, and so very well connected. Felicitate us, my dear Berkeley!' ...|$|E

I should myself like to go to America, but that would not suit Colonel Campian; and, if we are to live in Europe, we must live in England.

40|$|The {{study group}} (SG) concept is a {{relatively}} simple one that offers significant benefits for you, your peers and your company as a whole. The idea is to form a group of six to ten people, pick a book, define a reading schedule and meet {{once a week to}} discuss what you’ve read. Study groups provide enough structure to help you read and digest books and other information better than you would on your own. Yet, SGs don’t require as much time or involve as much pressure as a formal class. It’s a way of fostering your own professional development and keep up with new technology. As Warren Keuffel points out, you can’t always count on your company to provide the training that you want or need: “Engineers should recognize that professional and team development is by nature, and often by organizational default, an activity for which individual engineers need to take responsibility. If you’re the kind of engineer who expects your company to train you with whatever skills you require for well-rounded professional growth, <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> unpleasantly <b>surprised</b> when the time comes to shop those skills around to other shops. ”[1] Your company inherently benefits from software practitioners improving their skill...|$|R

How slyly you will run away to your own room, and blush unseen, like the flower in the poem, {{when you look at}} it! <b>You</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> rather <b>surprised,</b> perhaps, to see some little gold fastenings introduced as additions; but this, the jeweler told me, was a matter of necessity. Your poor dear sister's hair being the only material of the bracelet, when you sent it up to me to be altered, was very different from the hair of that faultless true-love of yours which you also sent to be worked in with it. It was, in fact, hardly half long enough to plait up properly with poor Susan's, from end to end; so the jeweler had to join it with little gold clasps, as you will see. It is very prettily run in along with the old hair though. No country jeweler could have done it half as nicely, so you did well to send it to London after all. I consider myself rather a judge of these things; and I say positively that it is now the prettiest hair bracelet I ever saw.|$|R
2500|$|The film {{received}} positive reviews upon {{release and}} currently holds a 91% [...] "Fresh" [...] rating {{on the website}} Rotten Tomatoes with an average rating of 7.7/10. Roger Ebert gave the film {{three out of four}} stars, writing that the film [...] "provides a good time, high style, a loving salute to an earlier period of filmmaking". The New York Times chief critic of the era, Vincent Canby, pointed out that [...] "had Dame Agatha Christie's Murder on the Orient Express been made into a movie 40 years ago (when it was published here as [...] "Murder on the Calais Coach"), it would have been photographed in black-and-white on a back lot in Burbank or Culver City, with one or two stars and a dozen character actors and studio contract players. Its running time would have been around 67 minutes and {{it could have been a}} very respectable B-picture. Murder on the Orient Express wasn't made into a movie 40 years ago, and after you see the Sidney Lumet production that opened yesterday at the Coronet, <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> both <b>surprised</b> and glad it wasn't.

60|$|I {{am afraid}} it will appear rather comical {{in some aspects}} to you and Mr. Makely, but I {{can assure you that}} it was a very serious matter with the Altrurian authorities. If there had been any hope of a vessel from the {{capitalistic}} world touching at Altruria within a definite time, they could have managed, for they would have gladly kept the yacht's people and owners till they could embark them for Australia or New Zealand, and would have made as little of the trouble they were giving as they could. But until the trader that brought us should return with the crew, as the captain had promised, there was no ship expected, and any other wreck in the mean time would only add to their difficulty. <b>You</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised,</b> though I was not, that the difficulty was mostly with the yacht-owners, and above all with Mrs. Thrall, who had baffled every effort of the authorities to reduce what they considered the disorder of their life.|$|E

If I {{had never heard}} the words, I should have known by the very shock upon his {{features}} that the so-called Oscar Rian had heard his real name. But I'm not quite so ignorant, <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> to hear. Drugger Davis {{was one of the}} most terrible and depraved criminals that ever baffled our police. It is certain he had done murder more than once long before his last exploit with the warder. But he was never entirely fixed for it, curiously enough because he did it in the same manner as those milder--or meaner--crimes for which he was fixed pretty often. He was a handsome, well-bred-looking brute, as he still is, to some extent; and he used mostly to go about with barmaids or shop-girls and do them out of their money. Very often, though, he went a good deal farther; and they were found drugged with cigarettes or chocolates and their whole property missing. Then came one case where the girl was found dead; but deliberation could not quite be proved, and, what was more practical still, the criminal could not be found. I heard a rumour of his having reappeared somewhere in the opposite character this time, lending money instead of borrowing it; but still to such poor widows as he might personally fascinate, but still with the same bad result for them. Well, there is your innocent man, and there is his innocent record. Even, since then, four criminals and three warders have identified him and confirmed the story. Now what have you got to say to my poor little machine after that? Hasn't the machine done for him? Or do you prefer to say that the woman and I have done for him?" ...|$|E
60|$|Of these {{representations}} of human art under heavenly guidance, {{the series of}} bas-reliefs which stud the base of this tower of Giotto's must be held certainly the chief in Europe. [Footnote: For account of the series on the main archivolt of St. Mark's, see my sketch of the schools of Venetian sculpture in third forthcoming number of 'St. Mark's Rest.'] At first <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> at the smallness of their scale in proportion to their masonry; but this smallness of scale enabled the master workmen of the tower to execute them with their own hands; and for the rest, in the very finest architecture, the decoration of most precious kind is usually {{thought of as a}} jewel, and set with space round it,--as the jewels of a crown, or the clasp of a girdle. It is in general not possible for a great workman to carve, himself, a greatly conspicuous series of ornament; nay, even his energy fails him in design, when the bas-relief extends itself into incrustation, or involves the treatment of great masses of stone. If his own does not, the spectator's will. It would be the work of a long summer's day to examine the over-loaded sculptures of the Certosa of Pavia; and yet in the tired last hour, you would be empty-hearted. Read but these inlaid jewels of Giotto's once with patient following; and your hour's study will give you strength for all your life. So far as you can, examine them of course on the spot; but to know them thoroughly you must have their photographs: the subdued colour of the old marble fortunately keeps the lights subdued, so that the photograph may be made more tender in the shadows than is usual in its renderings of sculpture, and there are few pieces of art which may now be so well known as these, in quiet homes far away.|$|E

But they say that once {{he was a very}} {{different}} man, when he was quite young, I mean. But all of a sudden his father--my grand-father, you know--whose picture is on the stairs, died, and within a day or two my mother died too; that was when I was born. After that he broke down, and became what he is now. For twenty years he has lived as he does now, poring all day over books of accounts, and very rarely seeing anybody, for he does all his business by letter, or nearly all of it, and he has no friends. There was some story about his being engaged to a lady who lived at Rewtham when he married my mother, which I daresay you have heard; but I don't know much about it. But, Mr. Heigham"--and here she dropped her voice--"there is one thing that I must warn you of: my father has strange fancies at times. He is dreadfully superstitious, and thinks that he has communications with beings from another world.

6000|$|... 130. But now, may we not ask farther,--is it {{impossible}} for art such as this, prepared for the wise, to please the simple also? Without entering on the awkward questions of degree, how many the wise can be, or how much men should know, {{in order to be}} rightly called wise, may we not conceive an art to be possible, which would deceive everybody, or everybody worth deceiving? I showed you at my First Lecture, a little ringlet of Japan ivory, as a type of elementary bas-relief touched with color; and in your rudimentary series you have a drawing, by Mr. Burgess, of one of the little fishes enlarged, with every touch of the chisel facsimiled on the more visible scale; and showing the little black bead inlaid for the eye, which in the original is hardly to be seen without a lens. <b>You</b> <b>may,</b> perhaps, <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> when I tell you that (putting the question of subject aside for the moment, and speaking only of the mode of execution and aim at resemblance,) you have there a perfect example of the Greek ideal of method in sculpture. And you will admit that, to the simplest person whom we could introduce as a critic, that fish would be a satisfactory, nay, almost a deceptive, fish; while, to any one caring for subtleties of art, I need not point out that every touch of the chisel is applied with consummate knowledge, {{and that it would be}} impossible to convey more truth and life with the given quantity of workmanship.|$|R
6000|$|... 128. <b>You</b> <b>may,</b> perhaps, have <b>been</b> <b>surprised</b> that I {{have not}} yet spoken {{of the works of}} J. D. Harding, {{especially}} if you happen to have met with the passages referring to them in Modern Painters, in which they are highly praised. They are deservedly praised, for they are the only works by a modern[30] draughtsman which express in any wise the energy of trees, and the laws of growth, of which we have been speaking. There are no lithographic sketches which, for truth of general character, obtained with little cost of time, at all rival Harding's. Calame, Robert, and the other lithographic landscape sketchers are altogether inferior in power, though sometimes a little deeper in meaning. But you must not take even Harding for a model, though <b>you</b> <b>may</b> use his works for occasional reference; and if you can afford to buy his Lessons on Trees,[31] it will be serviceable to you in various ways, and will at present help me to explain the point under consideration. And it is well that I should illustrate this point by reference to Harding's works, because their great influence on young students renders it desirable that their real character should be thoroughly understood.|$|R
