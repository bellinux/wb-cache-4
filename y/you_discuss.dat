2500|$|Apology, 1960. Before {{and during}} a City Council meeting, he demanded an apology from Police Chief William H. Parker for Parker's having {{condemned}} some Latino residents of East Los Angeles as [...] "not too {{far removed from}} the wild tribes of the inner mountains of Mexico. I don't think you can throw the genes out of the question when <b>you</b> <b>discuss</b> the behavior patterns of people." [...] Parker made the statement at a hearing [...] before the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights; he refused to apologize but said that the word [...] "wild" [...] was ill-advised.|$|E
2500|$|In a 1999 {{interview}} with Rowling, The Guardian Unlimiteds Joanna Carey said, [...] "JK Rowling {{is every bit}} as witty and subversive as you'd expect. Rowling described her admiration of Jessica Mitford since age 14, her time at Exeter University [...] "not quite the chance to be the 'radical' I planned", and said the later books dealing with Harry's hormones, and deaths would be unlike other children's series like the Famous Five. Carey suggested a parallel between Harry Potter and Prince Harry which Rowling laughs off saying a friend said never let the press make <b>you</b> <b>discuss</b> the royal family.|$|E
2500|$|What ensued {{was one of}} {{the most}} vitriolic {{corporate}} battles of the 1980s, with Perot and Smith publicly exchanging barbs using the media, which delightedly splashed the story over every business publication in the U.S.. Perot notoriously lashed out at Smith in a 1988 exclusive to Fortune Magazine, saying: [...] "My question is: Why haven't we unleashed their potential? The answer is: the General Motors system. It's like a blanket of fog that keeps these people from doing what they know needs to be done. I come from an environment where, if you see a snake, you kill it. At GM, if you see a snake, the first thing you do is go hire a consultant on snakes. Then you get a committee on snakes, and then <b>you</b> <b>discuss</b> it for a couple of years. The most likely course of action is—nothing. You figure, the snake hasn't bitten anybody yet, so you just let him crawl around on the factory floor. We need to build an environment where the first guy who sees the snake kills it." [...] Perot went on to needle Smith regarding the opulent 25th floor GM offices in New York, [...] "An entire teak forest must have been decimated for that floor". Smith, who had obviously ignored the irony of the CEO of the largest public corporation in the world complaining about the opulence of the private office (which Perot had personally paid to furnish) of a rival, had responded to Perot's frequent criticism of GM's executive perks a year earlier, [...] "Perot's office (in Dallas) 'makes mine look like a shanty-town. He has Remingtons; he has a Gilbert Stuart painting hanging on the wall. Nobody runs around saying 'Get rid of Ross's office'".|$|E

2500|$|As Emperor Shunzong {{continued}} to be seriously ill and unable to speak, a group of his close associates—the eunuch Li Zhongyan (李忠言), his concubine Consort Niu, the imperial scholars Wang Shuwen and Wang Pi, and the chancellor Wei Zhiyi—became the key decision-makers. [...] It was said that this group of individuals feared Li Chun for his intelligence and decisiveness, and initially, Li Chun was not created crown prince. [...] However, the eunuchs Ju Wenzhen (俱文珍), Liu Guangqi (劉光琦), and Xue Yingzhen (薛盈珍), {{all of whom were}} favored by Emperor Dezong and who lost their power in the new regime, summoned the imperial scholars Zheng, Wei Cigong, Li Cheng, and Wang Ya to the palace to draft an edict for Emperor Shunzong creating Li Chun as crown prince, anyway. [...] Zheng showed a piece of paper to Emperor Shunzong reading, [...] "The Crown Prince should be the oldest son." [...] Emperor Shunzong, who was unable to speak, nodded, and an edict was thereafter issued in late spring 805 creating Li Chun crown prince. [...] The edict also changed Li Chun's name (from 淳 to 純—both rendered [...] "Chun" [...] in modern Mandarin). It was said that Wang Shunwen was so concerned about Li Chun that he was heard reading from Du Fu's poem about the Shu Han regent Zhuge Liang—"He had not even succeeded in his campaigns when he died. [...] This often caused heroes to weep onto their collars." [...] Wang Shuwen and Wei Zhiyi tried to see if their group could persuade Li Chun to favor their positions by having their associate Lu Zhi (陸質) serve as the attendant to Li Chun's studies. [...] However, it appeared that Li Chun disliked Wang Shunwen and his associates, and whenever Lu tried to speak to him on political matters, Li Chun angrily responded, [...] "His Imperial Majesty commissioned you, sir, to teach me about the classics. [...] Why do <b>you</b> <b>discuss</b> other matters?" ...|$|E

I believe it is the truth that he has no personal ambition, but if the cause he has at heart is to be furthered at all it must be by his taking office.
