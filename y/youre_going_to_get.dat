There are viable alternatives to continuing in the cash crop business for those who can adjust their thinking. Finding alternatives to commodity crop production is the focus of this publication. Certain principles provide insights into ways to move forward. PRINCIPLES OF SUCCESS Its safe to say that if you keep doing what youve been doing, <b>youre</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> keep <b>getting</b> what youve been getting. If you are searching for an enterprise that is easy, profitable, and proven, you will find that many other people are already doing it. To build wealth, do what others cannot or will not doproduce a product that is different and difficult to produce (1). Using these two criteria keeps competition to a minimum. Taking small initial steps is one approach. Adding an alternative, more profitable crop to a corn-soybean rotation or a wheat-barley rotation is a step toward disconnecting from the cash-grain sys-tem, just as farm families who cooperatively market their products directly to consumers as foods, rather than as commodities, are disconnecting from the system. Farmers can also benefit by growing multi-purpose specialty crops that will give them lots of flexibility in both production and market...|$|R
5000|$|When Progressive Conservative Prime Minister Brian Mulroney {{began to}} lose ground in the polls, Chrétien was the major beneficiary. In {{preparation}} for the 1993 election, Chrétien {{won the right to}} have the final say over riding nominations and to veto any candidate that displeased him. Chrétiens use of this power caused some protests within the Liberal Party with John Nunziata publicly complaining that [...] "The backroom guys have taken control of the party. I guess they think they can muzzle us all". Chrétien told one prospective Liberal candidate Hec Clouthier, who informed Chrétien that was probably <b>going</b> <b>to</b> win the nomination to be the Liberal candidate for Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, defeating the incumbent Len Hopkins that: [...] "Well, you might the nomination. But <b>youre</b> not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the chance...I am the boss. I have the right to make this decision. I have an agenda for this country. I want to be prime minister and do great things, and Ive got to put people in place who I can know can win". Chrétien added that he knew Hopkins could win because he won his seat eight times in a row while Clouthier had no equivalent record. When Clouthier refused to withdraw his candidacy as ordered and looked certain to win the Liberal nomination for Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, he was expelled from the Liberal Party. Chrétien was so confident that he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> win the 1993 election that he formed his transition team in October 1992 to prepare for the hand-over of power 13 months before it actually happened.|$|R

[...] Island Records also intervened when the band wanted to title the albums first track [...] "My Name is David Ruffin And These Are The Temptations". Wentz stated [...] "Our label said, <b>Youre</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> sued for doing that, and our lawyer said, Youre definitely going to get sued for doing that, which totally sucked.

Burtons {{audition}} for the role of Kinte was the first of his professional career. As a result of his performance, he was nominated for the Emmy for Best Actor in a Drama Series. Burton reprised the role of Kunta Kinte in the 1988 television film Roots: The Gift. When asked about the societal impacts of Roots, Burton is quoted as saying, [...] "It expanded the consciousness of people.
