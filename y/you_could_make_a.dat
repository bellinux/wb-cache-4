He was pleased that Keane got through the match after 11 months out of action and was confident his team would fare better against ŁKS Łódź, the following Wednesday. Schmeichel felt the upcoming Champions League qualifier {{was more important than}} the Charity Shield game, which he considered as a pre-season match. Ferguson anticipated another challenge from Arsenal in the league: [...] "I think <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> strong case for four teams to challenge for the Premiership but I think Arsenal pose the biggest threat." ...|$|E
500|$|In April 2006, actors Tom Sturridge, Teresa Palmer, and Jamie Bell {{were cast}} for Jumper with Sturridge {{in the lead}} role. The {{following}} July, actor Samuel L. Jackson was cast as an Rolan Cox, with producer Simon Kinberg rewriting the original screenplay draft by Goyer. Principal photography was scheduled {{to take place in}} Tokyo, Rome, Toronto, and New York. Production was stopped in June 2006 after producer Tom Rothman told Liman [...] "The lead is 18. Wouldn't the movie be better if he was 25? You have a huge movie here and adults won't go and see an 18-year-old. They'll consider it a children's movie. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> bigger movie than that." [...] Liman agreed on casting older actors for furthering the romantic aspect of the film. In August, actor Hayden Christensen replaced Sturridge in the lead role as David just two weeks before the beginning of shooting, as the studio [...] "became concerned about not having a more prominent actor in their trio of young stars." [...] After Christensen was recast for the lead role, Liman replaced Palmer with Rachel Bilson.|$|E
500|$|In {{the fall}} of 1961, a Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) PDP-1 {{minicomputer}} was installed in the [...] "kludge room" [...] of the MIT Electrical Engineering Department to complement the older TX-0, and even before its arrival {{a group of students}} and university employees had been brainstorming ideas for programs that would demonstrate the new computer's capabilities in a compelling way. Three of them—Steve Russell, then an employee at Harvard University and a former research assistant at MIT; Martin Graetz, a research assistant and former student at MIT; and Wayne Wiitanen, a research assistant at Harvard and former employee and student at MIT—referring to their collaboration as the [...] "Hingham Institute" [...] as Graetz and Wiitanen were living in a tenement building on Hingham Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts, {{came up with the idea}} for Spacewar. [...] "We had this brand new PDP-1", Steve Russell told Rolling Stone in a 1972 interview. [...] "Marvin Minsky had built some little pattern-generating programs which made interesting patterns like a kaleidoscope. Not a very good demonstration. Here was this display that could do all sorts of good things! So we started talking about it, figuring what would be interesting displays. We decided that probably <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> two-dimensional maneuvering sort of thing, and decided that naturally the obvious thing to do was spaceships." ...|$|E

500|$|Robert Bianco of USA Today was {{critical}} of the episode, writing [...] "It is possible [...] has worn out the Treehouse franchise. [...] three installments just seem to be reaching for jokes that aren't there, and falling in the attempt. [...] As you'd hope from The Simpsons, the segments all boast a few clever moments {{that will make you}} smile if not laugh. But they're not scary, they're not particularly funny, and outside of some tepid Twilight jokes, they're no longer even trying to be real parodies of the original stories." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club also gave the episode a negative review, and felt that [...] "There were laughs in all three segments, but the episode as a whole left something to be desired. The first [...] eventually descended into a long string of mostly lame board game jokes, as if the writers had been coming up with board game puns for the last 15 seasons or something and wanted an excuse to unload a bunch of them all at once. The idea of Bart and Milhouse playing with a Ouija board ripoff was promising, so to see it descend into gags about Marge getting sucked into Clue was disappointing. There were fewer good gags [...] than in the board game segment, but it was balanced out by a fairly solid Hugh Laurie performance. Fortunately, the last segment, the inevitable Twilight parody, was funny across the board, both in how it took the piss out of the Twilight films and how it satirized vampire mania. [...] Still, it wasn't the best [...] "Treehouse" [...] ever, and <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> good claim for it being the worst, particularly if the Twilight segment wasn't in there." ...|$|E
2500|$|Though it is {{intuitively}} {{clear what}} supervenience is, formally specifying {{what it means}} involves a complex technical apparatus and a family of related but subtly different definitions. Most definitions involve comparisons of objects for indiscernibility. According to one standard definition, a set of properties A (e.g. mental properties) supervenes {{on a set of}} properties B (e.g. neural properties), if and only if any two objects x and y which share all properties in B (are [...] "B-indiscernible") must also share all properties in A (are [...] "A-indiscernible"). The intuitive idea is that if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> physical copy of a person, you'd also be making a psychological copy of that person. The reverse does not hold; two people could be in the same mental state, but that mental state could be supported by different brain states (the same mental state could be [...] "multiply realizable" [...] by different brain states). The properties in B are called the base properties (or sometimes subjacent or subvenient properties), and the properties in A are called the supervenient properties.|$|E
2500|$|The four color theorem was proven in 1976 by Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken. It was {{the first}} major theorem to be proved using a computer. Appel and Haken's {{approach}} started by showing that there is a particular set of 1,936 maps, each of which cannot be part of a smallest-sized counterexample to the four color theorem. (If they did appear, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> smaller counter-example.) Appel and Haken used a special-purpose computer program to confirm that each of these maps had this property. Additionally, any map that could potentially be a counterexample must have a portion that looks like one of these 1,936 maps. Showing this required hundreds of pages of hand analysis, Appel and Haken concluded that no smallest counterexamples exists because any must contain, yet do not contain, one of these 1,936 maps. This contradiction means there are no counterexamples at all and that the theorem is therefore true. Initially, their proof was not accepted by all mathematicians because the computer-assisted proof was infeasible for a human to check by hand [...] Since then the proof has gained wider acceptance, although doubts remain [...]|$|E

2500|$|... was {{released}} in 2002 and its expansion pack, , {{was released}} in 2003. The release of these two games brought with them {{a number of new}} features to the online service. The most significant feature to be added was probably the concept of Anonymous Matchmaking. This feature allowed a user who wanted to play a game to simply press a button and automatically be matched up with one or more other players who were similar in skill (based on ranking) and also wanted to play a game. This allowed for people to get into games quickly and easily. It also reduced win-trading, where two people would purposely win and lose games to artificially raise their rank on the ladder. The matchmaking concept was also expanded to team games in a feature called [...] "Arranged Teams". In an arranged team game, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> team with one or more friends, which was then anonymously matched up with another team of the same size and rank. However, a strategy was introduced on how to cheat the automated 'fair' matchups, called 'Abusing', simply by someone losing the Arranged Team Games intentionally with one ally so that with another ally (who wants to gain wins easily) won't find it difficult because the automatic matchups would put the two players up against relatively unskilled players. Automated tournaments were added in the expansion, where players would compete to be crowned tournament champion in a series of games played throughout the day. In addition to the new game styles, a slew of other features were added including selectable chatroom icons unlocked based on the player's number of wins, a friends list, and clan support.|$|E
