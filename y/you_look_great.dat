2500|$|Cruyff {{was noted}} {{by many as}} one of the few truly great players who made the {{transition}} to being a great coach/manager as well. His greatness was summed up by the former Dutch international Johan Neeskens, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>look</b> at the <b>greatest</b> players in history, most of them couldn’t coach. If <b>you</b> <b>look</b> at the <b>greatest</b> coaches in history, most of them were not great players. Johan Cruyff did both – and in such an exhilarating style." [...] Cruyff is undisputedly regarded {{as one of the}} greatest and most influential managers in history of the game, despite his top-level coaching career only lasted 11 years with two clubs. In July 2011, website Football Pantheon included him on its list of the top 50 greatest managers of all time. However, Cruyff's coaching legacy was about not just trophies and records but also the style and identity.|$|R

When have you ever done anything? You're useless. The pair of you. I mean, <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>great,</b> and I'd like to fucking shag you, but that's all."

5000|$|Sun.Star said [...] "She has {{everything}} {{one would expect}} from a beauty queen. She has a statuesque figure, a magnetic doll-like face, and an evident knack for style. Likewise, she {{has everything}} that is befitting of a lady who carries the name “Binibining Pilipinas.” She bears the true inner beauty of a Filipino - charm, brilliance, and poise - and indeed, she is a suitable representative to this year’s Miss International beauty pageant." [...] Elaine Kay Moll, Binibining Pilipinas 2012 1st runner-up and Miss Supranational 2012 3rd runner-up believes her fellow Binibining Pilipinas 2012 winner will do great. [...] "Nicole is very determined. All {{she has to do}} is be confident, be herself, be fierce, and she'll surely shine." [...] Dianne Elaine Necio, Binibining Pilipinas 2011 - International thinks Nicole will return to the Philippines victorious. She added: [...] "During the coronation night, when they were about to announce my successor, Nicole was one of my top bets. I felt she has {{what it takes to get}} the Miss International title," [...] "Nicole was very focused and disciplined all throughout the training. She's ready to battle even before she was given a crown, but she never stops improving and eagerly listens to suggestions. I'm sure she will do well in the competition and bring us the Miss International crown."Full details about her preparations were later on revealed. What does a day in the life of a beauty-queen-in-training look like? For Nicole, it’s never-ending beauty sessions. She wakes up at 7am to get ready for her Japanese lessons. With the Miss International 2012 being held in Japan, knowing the language will make it easier for her to charm them. After an hour of Domo Arigato Gazaimus etc., Nicole Schmitz heads off to her skin doctor for a facial or a body pampering session. Next on the itinerary: fitting sessions and clothes, clothes, clothes! Bb. Pilipinas tends to be secretive about what their candidates will wear in their international competitions but based on past experience, I’m guessing that Nicole Schmitz will be wearing a competitive gown made by a top South American designer and branded outfits ordered from New York City. All will be refitted to make sure they fit her every curve. The outfits a beauty queen brings with her to an international pageant are of prime importance. Many pageants start judging the girls on Day 1, so looking fashionable all the time and wearing the appropriate outfits can add points to Nicole’s scoreboard. Also, knowing that <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>great</b> everyday can boost your confidence level which is exactly why the Bb. Pilipinas team takes fashion requirements seriously. After the fittings, it’s time to practice the catwalk. We all know how Shamcey Supsup dominated the stage with her Tsunami Walk in the Miss Universe 2011 so developing a smashing sashay for the stage is crucial for Nicole Schmitz if she is to stand out in a crowd of beauties. It is no easy task to perfect one’s catwalk and even top models in the world continue to find ways to improve the way they move on stage. Physical training is last on the agenda and that involves practicing her talent portion or working out in the gym under the tutelage of fitness guru to the beauty queens, John Jay Cuay. As for preparing for the Q&A, I have no doubt that the well-spoken law student will perform with high marks in this area given her educational background and her great command of English....Nicole Schmitz has the natural grace of a dancer simply because she happens to be a student of Salsa! The first time I saw her dance was at the Talent Show of Bb. Pilipinas 2012 at the Ali Mall. But Nicole Schmitz won’t be Salsa-ing her way to Okinawa, Japan; she’ll be performing a Poi Dance with flags and LED balls at the Talent Competition of Miss International 2012. Poi is a Maori dance involving the creative swinging of balls or weights that are attached to strings. ...For Nicole, getting physically ready for a pageant as big as Miss International involves not just dancing but also some serious gym work. Under the strict eye of fitness expert John Jay Cuay who specializes in training beauty queens for pageants Nicole Schmitz has been able to develop trimmer arms and a leaner waistline. John was able to help her whittle down her abs from 24.5 to 23 inches. In order to maintain her lean and competitive body, Nicole Schmitz has gone Vegan and has temporarily removed bread and rice from her diet. It’s her first time to go Vegan and she’s seriously considering it as a lifestyle even after the Miss International 2012 beauty pageant is over....Indeed, Nicole Schmitz has a solid gameplan for the Miss International 2012: keep positive, do as many preps as possible and make adjustments along the way. But she’s not leaving it all to that; Nicole believes hard work still needs a smile from lady luck. So her prep team actually includes a Feng Shui expert who has been instructing her as to what charms to wear, what colors will give her good joss, what things to do and avoid and even what direction to sleep in at night! According to the Feng Shui expert, after looking at star charts based on her birth date and time, Nicole Schmitz has luck on her side as she competes for the Miss International 2012 title.|$|E

5000|$|After {{retiring}} from playing, Cruyff {{followed in the}} footsteps of his mentor Rinus Michels, coaching a young Ajax side to victory in the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1987 (1-0). In May and June 1985, Cruyff returned to Ajax again. In the 1985-86 season, the league title was lost to Jan Reker's PSV, despite Ajax having a goal difference of +85 (120 goals for, 35 goals against). In the 1985-86 and 1986-87 seasons, Ajax won the KNVB Cup. [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>look</b> at the <b>greatest</b> players in history, most of them couldn’t coach. If <b>you</b> <b>look</b> at the <b>greatest</b> coaches in history, most of them were not great players. Johan Cruyff did both - and in such an exhilarating style." [...] — Former Dutch international Johan Neeskens It was during this period as manager that Cruyff was able to implement his favoured team formation—three mobile defenders; plus one more covering space - becoming, in effect, a defensive midfielder (from Rijkaard, Blind, Silooy, Verlaat, Larsson, Spelbos), two [...] "controlling" [...] midfielders (from Rijkaard, Scholten, Winter, Wouters, Mühren, Witschge) with responsibilities to feed the attack-minded players, one second striker (Bosman, Scholten), two touchline-hugging wingers (from Bergkamp, van't Schip, De Wit, Witschge) and one versatile centre forward (from Van Basten, Meijer, Bosman). So successful was this system that Ajax won the Champions League in 1995 playing Cruyff's system - a tribute to Cruyff's legacy as Ajax coach.|$|R

60|$|Now if <b>you</b> <b>look</b> at the <b>greater</b> {{number of}} {{religious}} books, whether Popish or Protestant, {{you will find}} that in practice the main thing, almost the one thing, which they are meant to do, is to show the reader how he may escape Hell-torments, and reach Heaven's pleasures after he dies: not how he may do his Duty to God and his neighbour. They speak of that latter, of course: they could not be Christian books at all, thank God, without doing so; but they seem to me to tell men to do their Duty, not simply because it is right, and a blessing in itself, and worth doing for its own sake, but because a man may gain something by it after he dies. Therefore, to help their readers to gain as much as possible after they die, they are not content with the plain Duty laid down in the Bible and in the Catechism, but require of men new duties over and above; which may be all very good if they help men to do their real Duty, but are simply worth nothing if they do not.|$|R
