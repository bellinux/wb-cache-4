They were listening to tracks from the then-unreleased album Heartbeat City and Hutton told Roberts he was particularly impressed by the track [...] "Drive."At that time, everybody was making videos. It was the height of MTV, and when you made a record, you were also thinking about the video. I talked to Elliott about how much I liked that song “Drive,” and I started describing all the different ways I thought they could go with it, {{as far as the}} video. And he said, “You know, everything you’re saying sounds really interesting. Do you mind if… Would you be up for me passing that concept along to Ric Ocasek?” I said, “Sure!” So he got back to me the next day and said, “Ric and I think you should direct the video. We love your idea, <b>your</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> it.” So that’s how that happened. And about a month later, I was in New York at the Astoria Studios over two days, filming the video.|$|E
50|$|Hürriyet Daily News {{reviewer}} Emrah Güler states that, the teasers and {{the constant}} delay of the release date might have fueled debates before it met audiences, but the beautifully shot film featuring unknown actors successfully refrains from making any statements, instead remaining a haunting slice-of-life film about soldiers. Semerci moves his camera skillfully, slowly and with confidence across the skies, naked mountains, and a few soldiers lost along the depressing landscape. Most of the time, the scenes of stillness are enough to give the sense of loneliness, despair and meaninglessness of war, he continues, and when the movie moves into crafty and realistic scenes of military engagement, it refuses to stay a mix of detached action scenes but turn into tales of horror for everyone touched by war. Güller commends the cast by saying, Semerci’s selection of unknown names from acting {{schools around the country}} proves to be the right choice as no one character stands out, and it helps to amplify the sense of voyeurism into the lives of a real group of soldiers. He concedes that, For the Turkish audience, the experience of watching the everyday lives of these soldiers becomes more haunting as these border stations are the epitome of the lives of thousands claimed in the last two decades, and most people don’t have a clue what they look like or {{what it feels like to}} be on the edges of a country. The film strategically moves away from putting forward any message, and simply tells the stories of young men at war. It’s easy to interpret the movie in any way, depending on <b>your</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> the war. Semerci’s simply captures a group of scared young men ready to accept death because it’s the easiest option or, if they’re lucky, about to become damaged goods, scarred for life. This Güller concludes, is where, The unprecedented success of “Nefes” lies.|$|E
