500|$|After a stint {{with the}} {{short-lived}} Army Service Training Program, Groza was sent with the 96th Infantry Division {{to serve as}} a surgical technician in Leyte, Okinawa, and other places in the Pacific theater in 1945. The day he landed in the Philippines, Groza saw a soldier shot in the face. He was stationed in a bank of tents about five miles from the front lines and helped doctors tend to the wounded. [...] "I saw a lot of men wounded with severe injuries", he later said. [...] "Lose legs, guts hanging out, stuff like that. It's a tough thing, but you get hardened to it, and you accept it as part of <b>your</b> <b>being</b> there." ...|$|E
2500|$|Notably, {{the stated}} {{purpose of the}} conference was not to debate {{controversial}} doctrines. In fact the invitation was extended only to those Adventists who [...] "still adhere to the original faith." [...] The Shut-door Adventists and others who had developed new doctrines were therefore explicitly excluded. The biggest draw card {{was to be the}} presence of Miller. In fact Himes wrote to Miller on March 27, 1845, saying, [...] "all depends upon <b>your</b> <b>being</b> there." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{his arrival}} at the ashram, Sachidananda {{reviewed}} Nigamananda’s pilgrimages and said: [...] "My boy! You have travelled widely and seen the religious places and acquired knowledge and experience. All that I had to teach you has been accomplished but {{it is for you}} now to put my teachings into practice. You have to experience for yourself the truth of <b>your</b> <b>being</b> and this can only be done through concerted efforts as well as the practice and observance of yogic principles. Thus you now have to seek out a guru who will provide you the proper guidance in this line.|$|E

2500|$|Another key {{ingredient}} {{was his own}} presence as a master; [...] "A Master shares his being with you, not his philosophy. … He never does anything to the disciple." [...] The initiation he offered was another such device: [...] "... if <b>your</b> <b>being</b> can communicate with me, it becomes a communion. … It is the highest form of communication possible: a transmission without words. Our beings merge. This is possible only if you become a disciple." [...] Ultimately though, as an explicitly [...] "self-parodying" [...] guru, Rajneesh even deconstructed his own authority, declaring his teaching {{to be nothing more}} than a [...] "game" [...] or a joke. He emphasised that anything and everything could become an opportunity for meditation.|$|E
2500|$|Mr. Bell said, in a half-sad and half-complaining tone: [...] "I {{see that}} none of my old friends were over to hear me speak." [...] "No," [...] said Mr. Brownlow, [...] "we were not present, and did not intend being. We {{did not wish to}} witness the {{spectacle}} of <b>your</b> <b>being</b> surrounded by your enemies, who a few months ago were denouncing you as a traitor. We did not wish to hear these men shouting for you and see you in a such a position." [...] Mr. Brownlow then poured forth a torrent of abuse and denunciation of secession. Mr. Bell made no attempt to defend them, nor indeed to defend his own course.|$|E
2500|$|Stewart who was Gates' {{subordinate}} {{for over}} a year, took his former chief's side in the political struggle between Gates and his rival Philip Schuyler. When Gates assumed command of the Northern Department in August 1777, Stewart wrote him, [...] "You can't Imagine my Dear Sir, the Satisfaction it gives me <b>your</b> <b>being</b> sent back to your proper Command. It is so great a thing, to get the better so Nobly of that petty party, for I can call them by no other Name." [...] In another letter to Gates, he wrote of his fellow Pennsylvanian Anthony Wayne having to dig trenches, [...] "We are throwing up a few works at Wilmington, where Wayne is like a mad bear, it falling to his brigade. I believe he heartily wishes all engineers at the devil." ...|$|E

2500|$|I am not uninformed {{that the}} six Nations have been led into some {{difficulties}} {{with respect to}} the sale of their lands since the peace. But I must inform you that these evils arose before the present government of the United States was established, when the separate States and individuals under their authority, undertook to treat with the Indian tribes respecting the sale of their lands. [...] But the case is now entirely altered. The general Government only has the power, to treat with the Indian Nations, and any treaty formed and held without its authority will not be binding. [...] Here then is the security for the remainder of your lands. No State nor person can purchase your lands, unless at some public treaty held under the authority of the United States. The general government will never consent to <b>your</b> <b>being</b> defrauded. But it will protect you in all your just rights.|$|E
