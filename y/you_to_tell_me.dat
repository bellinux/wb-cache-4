[...] She {{therefore}} understood him to speak of , who was said to be the son of her father, and was then, on account of his love of literature, exiled to the Scottish islands.|$|E
500|$|Much {{time and}} focus {{were given to}} animals, {{especially}} the Siamese cats of which Manning was especially fond. She was {{very concerned about the}} health and comfort of her pets, taking them on visits to friends, along with hot water bottles for them in case the temperature dropped. She frequently sacked vets – telling one [...] "I do not pay <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that {{there is nothing wrong with}} my animal" [...] – and trying animal faith healers at times. [...] Additionally, she was a committed supporter of organisations combating animal cruelty. Her love and interest in cats was illustrated in her book Extraordinary Cats, published in 1967.|$|E
500|$|Murray {{was elected}} {{chief justice of}} the Howard Court of Peers, the highest student {{position}} at Howard, and in 1944 she was graduated first in her class. Traditionally, men who were graduated first in the class were awarded Julius Rosenwald Fellowships for graduate work at Harvard University, but that university did not accept women. Murray was rejected despite a letter of support from President Roosevelt. She wrote in response, [...] "I would gladly change my sex to meet your requirements, but since the way to such change has not been revealed to me, I have no recourse but to appeal to you to change your minds. Are <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that one is as difficult as the other?" ...|$|E

500|$|... "Homeless" [...] {{was written}} by Swedish {{songwriter}} Jörgen Elofsson, and produced by Steve Mac. It is an R power ballad, which lasts for a duration of three minutes and 50 seconds. The song was composed on common time in the key of B minor at 68beats per minute. Instrumentation is provided by a piano and a guitar. Lewis's vocal range spans nearly two octaves from low note of A3 to the high note of B5. The song's lyrics revolve around Lewis singing about waiting for her boyfriend {{to come home to}} where she is waiting for him, but feels homeless without his presence. The opening lyrics are [...] "Wait here for you to call me/ For <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that ev'rything's a big mistake." [...] Nick Levine for Digital Spy described Lewis's vocals in the lyric [...] "In this cold I'm walking aimless, feeling helpless" [...] as [...] "a tour de force of despair and misery".|$|E
500|$|Over ominous keys, a {{keyboard}} opening and a repeating drum loop {{in the first}} verse, Beyoncé sings about how her relationship turned sour and puts all her cards on the table, [...] "I told you how you hurt me, baby / But you don't care / Now I'm crying and deserted, baby / But you don't care / Ain't nobody tell me this is love / You're immune to all my pain / I need <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> this love / You don't care, well, that's OK". While singing {{the first and second}} verses, she pulls out the power in her lower register. Each time, her voice slowly builds until the commanding chorus is reached, where towards the end, she sings, [...] "la la la", in a muted saxophone line. Her voice expresses anger as she sings the chorus lines. In the second verse, Beyoncé continues the [...] "wild-eyed pleas", as stated by Guerra and sings the lines, [...] "Even since you knew your power / you made me cry / And now every time our love goes sour / you won't sympathize". Her raw vocals then punch through most powerfully at the second chorus leading up to the bridge. After the bridge, Beyoncé, this time, scats the chorus alongside a multi-octave guitar solo.|$|E
