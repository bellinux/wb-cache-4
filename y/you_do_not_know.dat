25|$|Another {{controversy}} {{concerns the}} fact that most traditional tests of APD use verbal materials. The British Society of Audiology has embraced Moore's (2006) recommendation that tests for APD should assess processing of non-speech sounds. The concern is that if verbal materials are used to test for APD, then children may fail because of limited language ability. An analogy may be drawn with trying to listen to sounds in a foreign language. It is much harder to distinguish between sounds or to remember a sequence of words in a language <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> well: the problem is not an auditory one, but rather due to lack of expertise in the language.|$|E

[...] "Si Te Vas" [...] (If You Go) was the third single from the album, released in 1998; it reached number-eight on Hot Latin Tracks. [...] "Contra la Corriente" [...] (Against the Current) and [...] "No Me Conoces" [...] (<b>You</b> <b>Do</b> <b>Not</b> <b>Know</b> Me) both reached number-two on Hot Latin Tracks., [...] "No Sabes Como Duele" [...] (<b>You</b> <b>Do</b> <b>Not</b> <b>Know</b> How It Hurts) was the last single {{to be released from}} the album in 1999 and reached number-eighteen on the Hot Latin Tracks.

In later life he suffered from gout, a common complaint among middle-class males in the Victorian period.

500|$|Jackson Benson {{believes}} Hemingway used autobiographical {{details as}} framing devices {{about life in}} general—not only about his life. For example, Benson postulates that Hemingway used his experiences and drew them out with [...] "what if" [...] scenarios: [...] "what if I were wounded {{in such a way}} that I could not sleep at night? What if I were wounded and made crazy, what would happen if I were sent back to the front?" [...] Writing in [...] "The Art of the Short Story", Hemingway explains: [...] "A few things I have found to be true. If you leave out important things or events that you know about, the story is strengthened. If you leave or skip something because <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> it, the story will be worthless. The test of any story is how very good the stuff that you, not your editors, omit." ...|$|E
500|$|Abbott {{initially}} {{created the}} game Confusion in the 1970s, {{and had it}} in finished form by 1980. The game was published in Germany by Franjos in 1992; Abbott was not satisfied with this version, however, due to several flaws in it. The rules {{were published in the}} Spanish translation of his book Abbott's New Card Games in 2008, but the game did not get published in North America until 2011. This Stronghold Games version was named [...] "Best New Abstract Strategy Game" [...] for 2012 by GAMES Magazine. The game is based on the idea of not knowing what your pieces are or what they do {{at the beginning of the}} game. His game Eleusis uses a similar idea, in that <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> how cards are to be played at the beginning; George Brancaccio, someone Abbott worked with at the Bank of New York, commented on this, saying [...] "In your game Eleusis, you don't know what cards can be played. Why don't you make a board game where you don't know how pieces move?" [...] This is what gave Abbott the idea, and he began work on it soon after.|$|E

500|$|Forces {{act in a}} {{particular}} direction and have sizes dependent upon how strong the push or pull is. Because of these characteristics, forces are classified as [...] "vector quantities". This means that forces follow {{a different set of}} mathematical rules than physical quantities that do not have direction (denoted scalar quantities). For example, when determining what happens when two forces act on the same object, it is necessary to know both the magnitude and the direction of both forces to calculate the result. If both of these pieces of information are not known for each force, the situation is ambiguous. For example, if you know that two people are pulling on the same rope with known magnitudes of force but <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> which direction either person is pulling, it is impossible to determine what the acceleration of the rope will be. The two people could be pulling against each other as in tug of war or the two people could be pulling in the same direction. In this simple one-dimensional example, without knowing the direction of the forces it is impossible to decide whether the net force is the result of adding the two force magnitudes or subtracting one from the other. Associating forces with vectors avoids such problems.|$|E
500|$|Following the battle, the {{commander}} of the Numidian cavalry, Maharbal, urged Hannibal to seize the opportunity and march immediately on Rome. It is told that the latter's refusal caused Maharbal's exclamation: [...] "Of a truth the gods have not bestowed all things upon the same person. You know how to conquer, Hannibal; but <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> how to make use of your victory." [...] Hannibal had good reasons to judge the strategic situation after the battle differently from Maharbal. As the historian Hans Delbrück pointed out, due to the high numbers of killed and wounded among its ranks, the Punic army was not in a condition to perform a direct assault on Rome. It would have been a fruitless demonstration that would have nullified the psychological effect of Cannae on the Roman allies. Even if his army was at full strength, a successful siege of Rome would have required Hannibal to subdue a considerable part of the hinterland to cut the enemy's supplies and secure his own. Even after the tremendous losses suffered at Cannae and the defection of a number of her allies, Rome still had abundant manpower to prevent this and maintain considerable forces in Iberia, Sicily, Sardinia and elsewhere despite Hannibal's presence in Italy. Hannibal's conduct after the victories at Trasimene (217 BC) and Cannae, {{and the fact that he}} first attacked Rome only five years later, in 211 BC, suggests that his strategic aim was not the destruction of his foe but to dishearten the Romans by carnage on the battlefield and to wear them down to a moderate peace agreement by stripping them of their allies.|$|E
