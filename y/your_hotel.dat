6000|$|... "Well, I'm {{going to}} tell you how to have trained service and how to make <b>your</b> <b>hotels</b> distinctive. They're good hotels, as hotels go, and you really do give people good coffee and good beds and credit conveniences, as you promise, but <b>your</b> <b>hotels</b> are not distinctive. I'm {{going to tell}} you how to make them so." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It's true," [...] he said, [...] "that when I {{first came}} here I was {{temporarily}} resting, so to speak; but didn't I go right out and grab the managership of <b>your</b> new <b>hotel?</b> Positively!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Come, Countess, you are {{weary and}} over-wrought. We {{have had enough}} talking to-night. Let me see you safe back to <b>your</b> <b>hotel.</b> Is it far from here?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's, right, my lad," [...] {{the captain}} said. [...] "I like your spirit. Have you money {{enough to pay}} for <b>your</b> <b>hotel</b> {{expenses}} while you are waiting for a ship?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It don't do to {{keep them}} things waiting about round here," [...] their new friend remarked, carelessly. [...] "I guess I'll send you back to <b>your</b> <b>hotel</b> all right. Step this way." ...|$|E
5000|$|Treat {{the colored}} {{people in a}} truly {{democratic}} spirit. Do not shut the doors of <b>your</b> churches, <b>hotels,</b> schools, and homes against them. Let them enjoy all the privileges which you possess. If they are poor, help them. If they are backward, uplift them, but for heaven's sake do not despise them.|$|R
6000|$|If I {{may take}} a daring image, a mediaeval liberty, I would suppose that in this lonely place the Spirit of Creation spoke to us on this matter. [...] "You are wise men," [...] that Spirit might say--and I, being a suspicious, touchy, over-earnest man for all my {{predisposition}} to plumpness, would instantly scent the irony (while my companion, I fancy, might even plume himself), [...] "and to beget your wisdom is chiefly why the world was made. You are so good as to propose an acceleration of that tedious multitudinous evolution upon which I am engaged. I gather, a universal tongue would serve you there. While I sit here among these mountains--I have been filing away at them for this last aeon or so, just to attract <b>your</b> <b>hotels,</b> you know--will you be so kind----? A few hints----?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I can quite {{understand}} that, Mrs. Inchbare--I know something of her temper myself. Did I understand {{you to say}} that she came to <b>your</b> <b>hotel</b> alone, and that her husband joined her shortly afterward?" ...|$|E
6000|$|When he {{returned}} to the house, he said kindly to his wife, [...] "I have been thinking to-day about <b>your</b> <b>hotel</b> scheme, and I shall write to Sacramento to-night to accept that capitalist's offer." ...|$|E

6000|$|Mrs. March fairly took Miss Triscoe in {{her arms}} to kiss her. [...] "Do you know I felt it must be you, all the time! When did you come? Where is <b>your</b> father? What <b>hotel</b> are you staying at?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Jimmy {{glanced at}} the paper. [...] "Got a wire last minute, and sent over to <b>your</b> <b>hotel,</b> but didn't find you in," [...] he read. [...] "Had to go out {{unexpectedly}} on the Sound steamer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I've come {{straight}} here,' he said, in a dull, bewildered fashion. 'I went to <b>your</b> <b>hotel,</b> Susie, {{in the hope}} of finding you; but when they told me you were out, I felt certain you would be here.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I understand," [...] I said, [...] "that the Chinese {{ambassador}} {{has just}} arrived at <b>your</b> <b>hotel.</b> Would {{you be so}} kind as to ask him whether he would consent to be interviewed as to the reasons of his visit?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Monsieur the Commissioner," [...] he said presently, [...] "and Monsieur Picard, I {{recognise}} {{your point}} of view. Believe me that I appreciate it and that I am willing, to a certain extent, to acquiesce in it. At the same time, there are considerations in this matter which I cannot ignore. I {{do not wish to}} create any disturbance or to make any statements likely to militate against the popularity of <b>your</b> wonderful <b>hotel,</b> Monsieur Picard. Nevertheless, for personal reasons only, notwithstanding the verdict of your doctor, I should like for one moment to examine the body." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Very simply; crossed from Liverpool yesterday, reconnoitred at <b>your</b> <b>hotel,</b> {{was shown}} your telegram, {{went to the}} luggage-office, routed out that the things were taking a gentle tour to Limerick, got them back this morning, and came on.

40|$|The website {{redesign}} for the St. James Hotel in Red Wing, Minnesota, {{provides a}} test case for the best practices relating to website optimization for search engine marketing, using Google search as an example. The goal of search engine optimization {{is to ensure that}} a hotel’s website appears at or near the top of search engine results pages—in the area sometimes called the Golden Triangle. Although the case focuses on Google, the principles are similar for all search engines and meta-search engines. Search engine optimization is based on the idea of making sure that <b>your</b> <b>hotel’s</b> site appears {{near the top of the}} listing when a would-be guest types a keyword query into the search engine. The goal of search engine algorithms is to present the most relevant pages for each query. To make sure that your pages are included in the “relevant” group, your website must include a logical presentation of appropriate keywords on each page. Tags for page headings and photographs should align with keywords for each page’s topic. By including a site diagram, a hotel can assist Google’s web crawlers in locating and indexing all pages on a website. Further authority is added when outside agencies link into a page and when a hotel is listed on the webpages of local tourism agencies. Finally, a hotel can purchase keywords or position on the search results page, in a section clearly labeled as sponsored results. This area does receive users’ attention, but not as much as the “organic” search results do...|$|R

50|$|Shortly {{after the}} pageant, Lee became a {{reporter}} for entertainment news program Scoop TV Entertainment, then launched her acting career in 1993 with the campus drama Our Paradise. She appeared in 1990s television dramas such as Love Is in <b>Your</b> Embrace, <b>Hotel,</b> Icing, Wedding Dress, and First Love, the last of which became the most highly rated Korean drama of all time with a peak viewership rating of 65.8%. She also made her big screen debut in 1996's Piano Man, followed by the films Change and Saturday, 2:00 p.m.. Lee's popularity was at its peak during these years, and in 1998 she hosted her own talk show Lee Seung-yeon's Say Say Say. With her sophisticated and cosmopolitan image, the clothes and accessories she wore became fashion trends, such as her blue-colored contact lenses in Spider, her head kerchief in Cinderella, and her black suit in Man of Autumn.|$|R

5000|$|The Guardian {{described}} onefinestay as “a fantastic {{option for}} staying in London” {{as it is}} “Better than house-sitting, in {{that you have no}} responsibilities, more interesting than a self-catered property or serviced apartment because the owner's possessions, their style, their touch and their personality remain.” [...] Country Life magazine also encouraged it readers to try onefinestay when they wrote “So next time you're heading into town for a meeting, dinner or trip to the theatre, think twice before booking the familiarity of <b>your</b> usual <b>hotel,</b> and live like a local instead”. This point was echoed by The Financial Times who said [...] "Glitterballs, private lifts and antique cocktails might be fun but how much more compelling is the chance to step into the shoes of a local?". These reviews have also been reflected by the European Startup Awards which named onefinestay as Best Travel and Hospitality Startup in 2011.|$|R

500|$|The {{hotel has}} no {{check-in}} desk; {{it uses a}} smartphone check-in system in which you scan a QR code and retrieve your room key from a vending machine. The visitors use a mobile app, named Lucy, that the company describes as a [...] "personal comfort assistant". [...] According to Mary Forgione of The Los Angeles Times, the app can order more pillows, handle room service orders, {{and serve as a}} remote control for both the television and the hotel's music library. The website also suggests that the app can control room temperature, interface with the chat board, provide local knowledge, and coordinate <b>your</b> messages with <b>hotel</b> staff.|$|R
