40|$|Abstract: Maintaining the {{alignment}} of railway track {{is vitally important}} for the smooth and safe passage of railway vehicles. Poor track alignment can result in poor ride quality, flange contact, or even flange climb. Accurate horizontal track geometry can be measured using a dedicated track recording vehicle or from a full track geometry recording system mounted on an in-service vehicle. This paper describes the use of sensors mounted on the bogie of an in-service vehicle to estimate the mean track alignment {{without the use of}} optical or contact sensors. In principle, either bogie lateral acceleration or yaw rate can be processed to give an estimate of mean lateral track irregularity, but a <b>yaw</b> <b>rate</b> <b>gyro</b> provides consistent estimates down to lower vehicle speeds than does an accelerometer and does not require compensation for the effects of bogie roll. An improved estimate can be obtained by inverting the dynamic relationship between themean track alignment and the bogie yawmotion. This is demonstrated with results from a Class 175 vehicle. Continually monitoring the lateral response of a bogie on an in-service vehicle, using only a <b>yaw</b> <b>rate</b> <b>gyro,</b> can provide data enabling the prioritization of maintenance operations...|$|E
40|$|NASA Dryden Flight Research Center and NASA Johnson Space Center are jointly {{conducting}} a phased program {{to determine the}} feasibility of the autonomous recovery of a spacecraft using a ram-air parafoil system for {{the final stages of}} entry from space to a precision landing. The feasibility is being studied using a flight model of a spacecraft in the generic shape of a flattened biconic that weighs approximately 120 lb and is flown under a commercially available ram-air parafoil. Key components of the vehicle include the global positioning system (GPS) guidance for navigation, a flight control computer, an electronic compass, a <b>yaw</b> <b>rate</b> <b>gyro,</b> and an onboard data recorder. A flight test program is being used to develop and refine the vehicle. The primary flight goal is to demonstrate autonomous flight from an altitude of 3, 000 m (10, 000 ft) with a lateral offset of 1. 6 km (1. 0 mi) to a precision soft landing. This paper summarizes the progress to date. Much of the navigation system has been tested, including a heading tracker that was developed using parameter estimation techniques and a complementary filter. The autoland portion of the autopilot is still in development. The feasibility of conducting the flare maneuver without servoactuators was investigated as a means of significantly reducing the servoactuator rate and load requirements...|$|E
40|$|The {{endurance}} of {{an aircraft}} {{can be increased}} {{in the presence of}} failures by utilising flight control systems that are tolerant to failures. Such systems are known as fault tolerant flight control systems (FTFCS). FTFCS can be implemented by developing failure detection, identification and accommodation (FDIA) schemes. Two of the major types of failures in an aircraft system are the sensor and actuator failures. In this research, a sensor failure detection, identification and accommodation (SFDIA); and an actuator failure detection, identification and accommodation (AFDIA) schemes are developed. These schemes are developed using the artificial neural network (ANN). A number of techniques {{can be found in the}} literature that address FDIA in aircraft systems. These techniques are, for example, Kalman filters, fuzzy logic and ANN. This research uses the fully connected cascade (FCC) neural network (NN) for the development of the SFDIA and AFDIA schemes. Based on the study presented in the literature, this NN architecture is compact and efficient in comparison to the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) NN, which is a popular choice for NN applications. This is the first reported instance of the use of the FCC NN for fault tolerance applications, especially in the aerospace domain. For this research, the X-Plane 9 flight simulator is used for data collection and as a test bed. This simulator is well known for its realistic simulations and is certified by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for pilot training. The developed SFDIA scheme adds endurance to an aircraft in the presence of failures in the aircraft pitch, roll and <b>yaw</b> <b>rate</b> <b>gyro</b> sensors. The SFDIA scheme is able to replace a faulty gyro sensor with a FCC NN based estimate, with as few as 2 neurons. In total, 105 failure experiments were conducted, out of which only 1 went undetected. In the developed AFDIA scheme, a FCC NN based roll controller is employed, which uses just 5 neurons. This controller can adapt on-line to the post failure dynamics of the aircraft following a 66 % loss of wing surface. With 66 % of the wing surface missing, the NN based roll controller is able to maintain flight. This is a remarkable display of endurance by the AFDIA scheme, following such a severe failure. The results presented in this research validate the use of FCC NNs for SFDIA and AFDIA applications...|$|E

The main idea of the proposed approach is consists of two parts; 1) self-identification of calibration coefficients that affects long-term performance, and 2) threshold filter to reject the broadband noise component that affects short-term performance. Experimental results with the proposed phased method applied to Epson XV 3500 gyro demonstrate that it effectively yields minimal drift heading angle measurements getting over major error sources in the MEMS gyro output...|$|R
40|$|High angle-of-attack flight regime {{research}} {{is currently being}} conducted for modern fighter aircraft at the NASA Ames Research Center's Dryden Flight Research Facility. This flight regime provides enhanced maneuverability to fighter pilots in combat situations. Flight research data are being acquired to compare and validate advanced computational fluid dynamic solutions and wind-tunnel models. High angle-of-attack flight creates unique aerodynamic phenomena including wing rock and buffet on the airframe. These phenomena increase the level of excitation of the structural modes, especially on the vertical and horizontal stabilizers. With high gain digital flight-control systems, this structural response may result in an aeroservoelastic interaction. A structural interaction on the X- 29 A aircraft was observed during high angle-of-attack flight testing. The roll and <b>yaw</b> <b>rate</b> <b>gyros</b> sensed the aircraft's structural modes at 11, 13, and 16 Hz. The <b>rate</b> <b>gyro</b> output signals were then amplified through the flight-control laws and sent as commands to the flaperons and rudder. The flight data indicated that as the angle of attack increased, the amplitude of the buffet on the vertical stabilizer increased, which resulted in more excitation to the structural modes. The flight-control system sensors and command signals showed this increase in modal power at the structural frequencies up to a 30 degree angle-of-attack. Beyond a 30 degree angle-of-attack, the vertical stabilizer response, the feedback sensor amplitude, and control surface command signal amplitude remained relatively constant. Data are presented that show the increased modal power in the aircraft structural accelerometers, the feedback sensors, and the command signals {{as a function of}} angle of attack. This structural interaction is traced from the aerodynamic buffet to the flight-control surfaces...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, a novel {{attitude}} estimation {{device is}} proposed utilizing cost-effective measurement sensors. The device fuses a rate gyroscope with an accelerometer array to estimate {{and eliminate the}} <b>rate</b> <b>gyro</b> bias online yielding accurate real time aircraft attitude tracking. Attitude determination algorithms are dependent on instantaneous and accurate measurements of translational and rotational body rates for precise estimation of vehicle orientation in three-dimensional space. Measurement error of instantaneous rate sensors, gyroscopes, is introduced via inherent biases and signal noise resulting in gyro drift. Integration of the rate signal for calculation of a net displacement amplifies these minute measurement errors leading to inaccurate and unreliable attitude observation. The proposed device is a departure from typical attitude observers and bias estimators due to its reliance on accelerometers measuring the local gravitational vector in lieu of additional magnetic field sensors or GPS. The end result of this work is a longitudinal attitude estimation device able to compute a <b>rate</b> <b>gyro</b> bias in real-time producing accurate pitch angle tracking while subjected to simulated aircraft flight conditions.
