6000|$|In the Boy's Town {{they had}} regular games and plays, which {{came and went}} in a stated order. The {{first thing in the}} spring as soon as the frost began {{to come out of the}} ground, they had marbles which they played till the weather began to be {{pleasant}} for the game, and then they left it off. There were some mean-spirited fellows who played for fun, but any boy who was anything played for keeps: that is, keeping all the marbles he won. As my boy was skilful at marbles, he was able to start out in the morning with his toy, or the marble he shot with, and a commy, or a brown marble of the Lowest value, and come home at night with a pocketful of white-alleys and blood-alleys, striped plasters find bull's-eyes, and crystals, clear and clouded. His gambling was not approved of at home, but it was allowed him because of the hardness of his heart, I suppose, and because it was not thought well to keep him up too strictly; and I suspect it would have been useless to forbid his playing for keeps, though he came to have a bad conscience about it before he gave it up. There were three kinds of games at marbles which the boys played: one with a long ring marked out on the ground, and a base some distance off, which you began to shoot from; another with a round ring, whose line formed the base; and another with holes, three or five, hollowed in the earth at equal distances from each other, which was called knucks. You could play for keeps in all these games; and in knucks, if you won, you had a shot or shots at the knuckles of the fellow who lost, and who was obliged to hold them down for you to shoot at. Fellows who were mean would twitch their knuckles away when they saw your toy coming, and run; but most of them took their punishment with the savage pluck of so many little Sioux. As the game began in the raw cold of the earliest spring, every boy had chapped hands, and nearly every one had the skin worn off the knuckle of his middle finger from resting it on the ground when he shot. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> knuckle-dabster of fur or cloth to rest your hand on, but it was considered effeminate, and in the excitement you were apt to forget it, anyway. Marbles were always very exciting, and were played with a clamor as incessant as that of a blackbird roost. A great many points were always coming up: whether a boy took-up or edged beyond the very place where his toy lay when he shot; whether he knuckled down, or kept his hand on the ground in shooting; whether, when another boy's toy drove one marble against another and knocked both out of the ring, he holloed [...] "Fen doubs!" [...] before the other fellow holloed [...] "Doubs!" [...] whether a marble was in or out of the ring, and whether the umpire's decision was just or not. The gambling and the quarrelling went on till the second-bell rang for school, and began again as soon as the boys could get back to their rings when school let out. The rings were usually marked on the ground with a stick, but when there was a great hurry, or there was no stick handy, the side of a fellow's boot would do, and the hollows for knucks were always bored by twirling round on your boot-heel. This helped a boy to wear out his boots very rapidly, but that was what his boots were made for, just as the sidewalks were made for the boys' marble-rings, and a citizen's character for cleverness or meanness was fixed by his walking round or over the rings. Cleverness was used in the Virginia sense for amiability; a person who was clever in the English sense was smart.|$|E

This problem, which will be called the randomized shortest path problem, is introduced in this paper. The global degree of randomness of the routing policy will be quantified by the expected Shannon entropy spread into the network, and is provided a priori by the designer. Then, necessary conditions allowing to compute the optimal randomized policy – minimizing the expected routing cost – are derived. Iterating these necessary conditions, reminiscent of Bellman’s value iteration equations, allows to compute the optimal policy, that is, the set of conditional probabilities of following a link in each node. Interestingly and surprisingly enough, the proposed model, while formulated in a totally different framework, reduces to Akamatsu’s model [3], introduced in transportation science, for a special choice of the entropy constraint. We therefore revisit Akamatsu’s model by recasting it into a statistical physics formalism allowing to easily derive all the quantities of interest in an elegant, unified, way. For instance, the optimal policy can be obtained by solving a linear system of equations, which was not noticed by Akamatsu. Finally, simulation results show that the system behaves as expected. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the color value of four kinds of highly transparent ceramics (Zenostar Zirconia, Lava Zirconia, Cercon Zirconia and Upcera Zirconia) after veneered on three different post core materials including noble metal alloy, Co-Cr alloy and composite resin. Highly transparent ceramics after veneered were made into specimens with 10 mm in diameter and 1. 0 mm in thickness. The color of core ceramics after veneered on different post core materials were measured with Color Analyzes. The results showed that their color value were significantly different from each other. Zenostar ZR Translucent and Lava Plus High Translucency Zirconia can be easily affected by the background color because of its high translucency. Therefore, resin post core materials should be selected without cause prosthesis mismatch of colors in clinical work.

In this case studie it was shown in many events the forecasts was improved by using this method. Many navigation softwares do not include weather observations in their algorithms and is entirely based on polardiagrams and weather predictions. Taking observations into the software by correct the current forecast by previous errors could help to improve the final results of the navigation system. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{justification}} for using {{games in the}} classroom has been well demonstrated as benefiting students {{in a variety of}} ways. These benefits range from cognitive aspects of language learning to more co-operative group dynamics. The benefits are as follows: Affective: - games lower the affective filter - they encourage creative and spontaneous use of language - they also promote communicative competence - games are both motivating and fun Cognitive: - games reinforce learning - they both review and extend learning - games focus on grammar in a communicative manner Class Dynamics: - games are extremely student centered - the teacher acts only as facilitator - games build class cohesion - they can foster whole class participation - games promote healthy competition Adaptability: - games can be easily adjusted for age, level, and interests - they utilize all four skills - games require minimum preparation after the initial development stage You can successfully use games in many ways, such as for a quick review, after material has been covered or as a cool-down activity {{at the end of a}} lesson to practice what has been covered (as well as to inject an element of fun). <b>You</b> <b>could</b> also <b>use</b> <b>a</b> game to practice specific new language in groups or pairs for a limited time, as a short introduction to new vocabulary or a concept, as a prompt for writing work, even as a link into a new part of the lesson. Games may even be used merely to change the pace of a lesson...|$|R

Med hjälp av Trafikverket har vi genomfört detta examensarbete. Vi hade fått tydliga direktiv från Trafikverket gällande examensarbetets syfte. Det gjorde det enkelt för oss att avgränsa arbetet efter de riktlinjer som var angivna och möjliga att genomföra. Studiens syfte var att förstå varför det inte går ge ut {{relevant}} trafikinformation. I dagsläget har man tekniken för ett väl fungerande system. Ett system där man enkelt kan få realtidsinformation i samband med trafiken, vägarbeten och eventuella hinder. I rapporten har vi även sammanfattat alla navigationssystem som man kan ha användning av som trafikant. Vi har gjort en omvärldsanalys på hur man i andra länder ger ut trafikinformation och hur de står sig jämtemot Sveriges trafikinformationssystem. För vårt examensarbete har vi använt oss av diverse olika rapporter och intervjuer. Detta tillsammans med personer som har kunskap inom området. Vi har även använt oss av åtskilliga hemsidor för att inhämta information. Rekommendationer för examensarbetet {{kommer att}} beskrivas genom fem teman. I rapporten har vi utfört en mängd olika intervjuer som vi sammanställt till teman. Teman var utformade efter det vi kände var mest relevant från intervjuerna. Våra teman speglar bilden av vad vi har lagt vikt med detta examensarbete. In this report, we have explained {{the problems that}} may occur with today's technology and what possible solutions to improve with time. With {{the help of the}} Swedish Transport Administration, we have implemented this thesis. We got the clear directions from the Swedish Transport Administration regarding purpose of this thesis. This made it easy for us to delineate our work after the guideline that was definer. The study's purpose was to try to understand why you can´t give out the relevant traffic information. Today we have the technology create a well smooth operation system. A system where you can easily get real-time information related to traffic, road works and obstructions. In this report we have summarized all the navigation system that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>use</b> as <b>a</b> road user. We have done an analysis of how other countries give out their traffic information and how good they are against the Swedish traffic information system. For our thesis we have used various of different reports and interviews. The interviews have been with people who have knowledge in the field. We have also used numerous websites to gather information. Recommendations for the thesis will be described through five themes. In this report, we have conducted a variety of interviews that we have compiled for themes. Themes were designed for what we felt was most relevant from the interviews. Our themes are a mirror image of what we thought was the most relevant part in our thesis. ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1968, Garrett AiResearch (who {{employed}} designers Ray Holt and Steve Geller) {{was invited}} to produce a digital computer to compete with electromechanical systems then under development for the main flight control computer in the US Navy's new F-14 Tomcat fighter. The design was complete by 1970, and <b>used</b> <b>a</b> MOS-based chipset as the core CPU. The design was significantly (approximately 20 times) smaller and much more reliable than the mechanical systems it competed against, and was used {{in all of the}} early Tomcat models. This system contained [...] "a 20-bit, pipelined, parallel multi-microprocessor". The Navy refused to allow publication of the design until 1997. For this reason the CADC, and the MP944 chipset it used, are fairly unknown.Ray Holt graduated from California Polytechnic University in 1968, and began his computer design career with the CADC. From its inception, it was shrouded in secrecy until 1998 when at Holt's request, the US Navy allowed the documents into the public domain. Since then people have debated whether this was the first microprocessor. Holt has stated that no one has compared this microprocessor with those that came later. According to Parab et al. (2007), [...] The scientific papers and literature published around 1971 reveal that the MP944 digital processor used for the F-14 Tomcat aircraft of the US Navy qualifies as the first microprocessor. Although interesting, it was not a single-chip processor, as was not the Intel 4004they both were more like a set of parallel building blocks <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>use</b> to make <b>a</b> general-purpose form. It contains a CPU, RAM, ROM, and two other support chips like the Intel 4004. It was made from the same P-channel technology, operated at military specifications and had larger chipsan excellent computer engineering design by any standards. Its design indicates a major advance over Intel, and two year earlier. It actually worked and was flying in the F-14 when the Intel 4004 was announced. It indicates that today's industry theme of converging DSP-microcontroller architectures was started in 1971. [...] This convergence of DSP and microcontroller architectures is known as a digital signal controller.|$|R
