500|$|... "A Little Bit" [...] was {{released}} {{as the second}} single, on October 29, 2001. The song was used to promote Bally Total Fitness and thus, a limited CD single pressing was made available to people who joined the club. The song only managed to reach number sixty-two on the Australian Singles Chart. A music video, directed by Hype Williams, features Simpson dancing in a futuristic spaceship-like setting, with her backup dancers. A third single was planned to be released, but after September 11 terrorist attacks, Sony refused to promote a third single, which Joe Simpson believed critical for Jessica's prospects. In a interview in 2004 he said:"When those planes crashed into those buildings, it nearly demolished our career." [...] "When <b>You</b> <b>Told</b> <b>Me</b> <b>You</b> Loved Me" [...] {{was released}} as a promotional single in Brazil. [...] The single however charted and peaked at number 192 on the South Korean Download Chart.|$|E
500|$|Walter Afanasieff, long-time Mariah Carey collaborator, {{worked with}} Simpson on three cuts from Irresistible. One of the songs, [...] "When <b>You</b> <b>Told</b> <b>Me</b> <b>You</b> Loved Me", {{was written by}} Afanasieff in {{collaboration}} with Billy Mann. In an interview with Allpop, Simpson named the song {{as one of her}} favorites and said, [...] "I really base that on a situation of a friend of mine whose parents are divorced. I like the emotion behind that song." [...] Cory Rooney wrote [...] "Hot Like Fire" [...] solely, which Simpson described as [...] "certainly not kid stuff", a song [...] "with a lot of attitude." [...] Louis Biancaniello and Sam Watters were also brought in to write and produce songs for the album. One of the cuts, [...] "For Your Love", according to Simpson, is reminiscent of [...] "I Wanna Love You Forever" [...] (1999). Simpson covered the gospel hymn [...] "His Eye is on the Sparrow" [...] as the last song of the album. She said, [...] "I wanted to give my audience a piece of my heart and soul. The message is there's so much in life that can get you discouraged, but if you trust that you're being watched over, you have a reason to live and a sense of freedom. It's different for everyone, but for me, my relationship with God is the way I clear out the shadows that hang in our lives." ...|$|E
500|$|... "When <b>You</b> <b>Told</b> <b>Me</b> <b>You</b> Loved Me" [...] {{is another}} power ballad about love, this time {{utilizing}} a spanish guitar. Backed by a full 60 piece orchestra, {{the song and}} Simpson's vocals were {{compared to that of}} Mariah Carey and Celine Dion. [...] "Hot Like Fire", which received positive reviews from critics, is a funky mid-tempo number. Compared to the likes of Michael Jackson and Destiny's Child, the song begins with a [...] "faux" [...] telephone call between Simpson and her friend; the latter explains that Simpson's boyfriend has been cheating on her. The lyrics, sung with [...] "hard edge vocals" [...] over synth horns, hip-hop beats, and electronica rhythms, demonstrate Simpson's annoyance at being cheated on by her boyfriend. [...] "Imagination" [...] is a song with electronic and R influences. Rick de Yampert of The Daytona Beach News-Journal commented that the song contained Stevie Wonder-styled funk music. [...] "To Fall in Love Again" [...] and [...] "For Your Love" [...] are ballads; the former is backed by a 60 piece orchestra, and Peter Marsh of BBC Music noted it [...] "morphs [...] into an R'n'B tinged slow jam." [...] It also contains a jazz breakdown, towards its end. Bob Waliszewski wrote that through the latter, [...] "Simpson pledges devotion to a partner". [...] "I Never", produced by Darkchild, infuses Spanish guitars, and has an [...] "urban" [...] tinge. The song portrays the theme of self-respect, and has Simpson getting rid of her cheating partner. The closing track, the cover of the hymn [...] "His Eye Is on the Sparrow", is backed by a gospel choir and [...] "praises God for watching over His children". Reviewers called it one of the standout tracks from the album. According to Kirsten Koba of PopMatters, Simpson sings it [...] "with a depth and passion that is lacking {{on the rest of the}} album." ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{he listened}} to her, he could foresee the {{daunting}} challenges lying ahead. Like a father sharing his life experiences with his daughter, he said, [...] "Just like the time <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>you</b> intended to begin charity work, I reminded you to think whether you would have the strength and the money when more people came to you for help. The task can only be realized with unwavering commitment." ...|$|E
2500|$|Singer turned {{producer}} Mario Winans, {{wrote and}} produced a song for the album called [...] "Wish Your Love Away" [...] where Norwood sings with angst for her lover [...] "who played her like a fool". Centred around a melody of [...] "serrated drums" [...] and a [...] "piping" [...] pan flute Norwood singles [...] "Remember that <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>you</b> were with it, and all them other bitches you could do without." [...] "Do You Know What You Have?", helmed by Mike WiLL Made It, switches direction, with Norwood firing back at her love. In the lyrics she [...] "cuts down her man for failing to return her affections." [...] The subject content changes slightly on the Bangladesh-helmed [...] "So Sick", another record which was written by Garrett. On the song, Norwood addresses a lover who pushes her too far and [...] "violating her trust", it includes the lyrics [...] "How far do you think I'll let you push me before I cross the line?".|$|E
2500|$|Lu Shi (逯式), the Administrator (太守) of the Wei-controlled Jiangxia Commandery (江夏郡), {{often led}} {{his men to}} cause trouble at the border between Wu and Wei. When Lu Xun heard that Lu Shi could not get along with Wen Xiu (文休), a son of the veteran Wei general Wen Ping, {{he came up with}} a plan to stop Lu Shi. He pretended to have {{received}} a letter from Lu Shi and wrote a [...] "reply" [...] as such: [...] "I can sense your sincerity and sorrow when <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>you</b> have disagreements with Wen Xiu. You said both of you cannot exist together and you intend to defect to my side. I have delivered your letter to my lord and will gather my men to welcome you. You should make preparations soon and inform us of the date of your defection." [...] He then left the [...] "reply" [...] letter at the border, where it was picked up by Lu Shi's men. When Lu Shi heard about it, he became afraid and immediately sent his family to the Wei capital Luoyang. His subordinates became distrustful of him and eventually he was dismissed from office.|$|E
