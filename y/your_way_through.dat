500|$|The band's {{style and}} theme changed between their debut album, The Healing of Harms (2006), and Unbreakable. The first album was thematically based on [...] "trying to fight <b>your</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> circumstances", while Fireflight's second project has {{a theme of}} triumph and being [...] " [...] over the things that used to control you". According to the band members, the song [...] "Unbreakable" [...] {{represents}} that change between the two albums: [...] "now it's about finding power in your life", said bassist Wendy Drennen.|$|E
500|$|In a more {{positive}} review, Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer stated that [...] "Stolen Memory" [...] "does {{a good job of}} justifying itself through enjoyable gameplay and clever storytelling. Short, yes, but also surprisingly sweet." [...] He also highlighted positively the story and opined that the ending [...] "adds more shading to Kasumi's flirtatious character", stating that [...] "the obligatory moral choice at the end is dictated by intimate emotional considerations rather than battlefield pragmatism." [...] Eduardo Reboucas of Game Revolution criticized the fact that the story does not fit in a post-story scenario, stating that [...] "Stolen Memory" [...] "is intended to be played as you're making <b>your</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> the suicide mission storyline and not in the aftermath." ...|$|E

500|$|The Prince-inspired [...] "Cross Dresser" [...] has a {{new wave}} style and {{whimsical}} lyrics in which the narrator holds on {{to the memory of}} his lost love by wearing her clothes. Hunt said that he did not intend for the song to have a meaning other than the explicit: [...] "I just thought it was funny. It's {{one of those things that}} people talk about, but that's never really happened to me. But I literally wrote it in 20 minutes. It felt good ... It was really quick and I just thought it was something silly and funny." [...] "It's a Mysterious Hustle" [...] features somber strings, a languid rhythm, an eerie piano vamp, and bitter singing by Hunt. It was recorded solely by Hunt, who played guitar, keyboards, and electronic drums. Its lyrics are about having to [...] "work <b>your</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> the crowd" [...] and [...] "overcome the place you come from", and view the world as [...] "no place to raise a child". Its spoken word conclusion preaches, [...] "If you follow the beaten path, it will keep you tied to the past." ...|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} upon its release. In his review for Breakaway, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of MSN considered [...] "Since U Been Gone", [...] "Walk Away", and [...] "You Found Me" [...] as {{the spine of}} the album. He added that the songs sound mainstream and youthful. Rohin of Blogcritics gave a positive response to the song, emphasizing that [...] "it is almost one of the best pieces of throwaway pop in recent history". He also thought that the song represents a song [...] "that you can roll down the windows of your car and proudly headbang <b>your</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> a yellow light somewhere on a suburban side street." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine thought that Clarkson did a good impression of Pat Benatar in [...] "Since U Been Gone". He concluded his review by emphasizing that Breakaway proves that Clarkson has successfully dodged the sophomore slump but [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] helped her establish her success. The staff of Slant Magazine later ranked [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] at number thirteen in their list of Best Singles of the Aughts, writing that the song proves Clarkson's powerful ability as a vocalist as well as her versatility as an artist.|$|E
500|$|The lyrics for Wasting Light were {{completed}} {{during the week}} each song was being recorded. Grohl said that the words were [...] "what was on my mind each week", most being [...] "written {{from the perspective of}} who I was then and who I am now", with references to the past, life and death, and [...] "time, but questioning whether it matters at all. There's so much focus on the before that people forget there's an after." [...] The frontman said this was helped by the environment - [...] "a lot of retrospection and introspection and nostalgia going back to the way we used to make records" [...] - and working with Vig again, which [...] "made me think a lot about starting over, and rebirth, and making <b>your</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> tragedy and coming out the other side." [...] An example was [...] "I Should Have Known", partially inspired by former Nirvana bandmate Kurt Cobain - [...] "a song like 'I Should Have Known' is about all the people I've lost, not just Kurt". Grohl still tried to do laid-back songs such as [...] "White Limo", which had its lyrics written in just two minutes, specially after Mendel sent him an e-mail saying, [...] "I really like it when you write songs that are silly and mean nothing, too. You don't have to try to write 'Imagine' every time you sit down with a pen and paper".|$|E

500|$|The {{second season}} was made {{available}} {{in its entirety}} on February 14, 2014 (Valentine's Day) at 12:01a.m. PT. Prior {{to the release of}} season 1, three reviewers, Hank Stuever of The Washington Post, Nancy deWolf Smith of The Wall Street Journal, and Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times, commented on possible binge viewing by Netflix customers. Stanley notes that the show [...] "is probably seen best one episode at a time. It's a delicious immorality play with an excellent cast, but the tempo is slow and oddly ponderous—a romp slowed down to a dirge". Smith also notes that due to its [...] "relentless theme", [...] "House of Cards might go down better in smaller portions and thus be enjoyably prolonged", deriding potential binge watchers as people who liken a delicacy to a [...] "bag of M's". However, Stuever disagreed about season 1 saying [...] "So, on the iffy chance that House of Cards draws you in and you simply cannot stop watching, then, yes, you may power-binge <b>your</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> all 13 hours at once". Upon viewing the four episode season 2 preview Time James Poniewozik says [...] "I could easily see powering through the season in a free weekend, precisely because no individual episode needs much time to sink in". Stanley also felt the second season was [...] "binge-worthy" [...] upon viewing the preview. However, Ellen Gray of Philly.com supports not binge-watching the season, as she believes it does not serve it well.|$|E
500|$|Johnson {{stated that}} Valve's aim {{was not to}} make Portal 2 more {{difficult}} than its predecessor, but instead to produce [...] "a game where you think <b>your</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> particular parts of the level, and feel really smart when you solve it." [...] Portal 2 allows the player to take incremental steps to understand the game's mechanics, an approach that led to two basic types of test chamber. The first type, which Valve calls [...] "checklisting", provides a relatively safe environment for player to experiment with a new gameplay concept; the second type combines elements in new ways to force the player to think laterally, providing challenging and rewarding puzzles. Chambers were first developed through whiteboard via isometric drawings. The developers performed a sanity check on the chamber before crafting simple levels with a software tool called the Hammer level editor. Extensive playtesting ensured the solutions to each chamber were neither too obvious nor too difficult, and observed alternative solutions discovered by playtesters. Based on play-testing results, the design team retained these alternative solutions or blocked them if they were considered too easy. These versions were sent back for further play-testing to verify that the new elements did not prevent players from finding solutions; further iterations between artists and playtesters occurred until such issues were resolved. Some elements from Portal were modified to suit Portal 2; whereas players of Portal would {{be familiar with the}} game mechanics, novice players required some training, as would players of Portal for some game elements. For example, the energy spheres used in the first game were replaced with lasers, which provided immediate feedback and reduced the in-game training time.|$|E

The 14th and 11th brigades reached their objectives, with some fighting at Forêt and in the south, the 9th Cavalry Division rested its horses and held the crossings of the Ourthe and Amblève. Guarding the attacking corps from cavalry reported to be between Huy and Durbuy, rather than push on to take the Meuse crossings between Liège and Huy; the southern brigades closed up to the Ourthe at Esneux, Poulseur and Fraiture. By the evening of 5 August, the coup de main was ready but {{it was obvious that}} no surprise could be obtained, given the resistance of the Belgian army [...] "and civilians" [...] in densely populated country, where movement had been slowed by hedges and fences.

50|$|Comper {{was more}} {{interested}} in the welfare of the poor and resigned the charge at St John’s in 1870 to spend more time in the mission he had founded in the Gallowgate slums of Aberdeen in 1867. Wright describes the scene as follows; “The whole area enjoyed an evil reputation. No one ventured out after dark. It was bad enough making <b>your</b> <b>way</b> to church <b>through</b> wet washings, but you also had to hold your nose to prevent smelling the fish barrows parked along one side of the Gallowgate. Often rats were scavenging in the barrows.” From this mission, St Margaret's, Gallowgate, emanated the subsequent mission at St Clement’s-on-the-Quay, which eventually became an independent congregation erecting a church on the quayside with money bequeathed by Sir George Reid’s widow, Margaret Best, one of Comper’s ardent admirers.|$|R
