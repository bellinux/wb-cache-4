[...] Videos of Warren's questioning became popular on the Internet, amassing {{more than one million}} views in a matter of days. At a Banking Committee hearing in March, Warren asked Treasury Department officials why criminal charges were not brought against HSBC for its money laundering practices. With her questions being continually dodged, Warren compared money laundering to drug possession, saying: [...] "If you're caught with an ounce of cocaine, the chances are good you're going to go to jail... But evidently, if you launder nearly a billion dollars for drug cartels and violate our international sanctions, your company pays a fine and <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> and sleep in your own bed at night." ...|$|E

2500|$|D'Arcy {{asked him}} to explain {{the format of the}} show, saying: [...] "The key to a good format is you can explain it in one or two sentences.

[...] Tarrant replied with: [...] "The Colour of Money[...] [...] [...] [...]there are 20 cash machines, all with different amounts in them ranging up to a total of more than £25,000. You choose 10 colours and they have different amounts in them. If all 10 add up to the total of money you want, then you win. If the money is not enough, then you lose out and there's no in between. It's either £80,000 or £90,000 or whatever, or <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> with el zippo."
