500|$|As {{counsel for}} the prosecution, Hastings was the first {{barrister}} to speak. In his opening speech to the jury he criticised Booth for loving money rather than his country, saying {{that one of the}} things which the English prided themselves on was fair play, and [...] "no matter how loudly the defendant raises the cry of patriotism, I feel sure that <b>your</b> <b>sense</b> of fair play, gentlemen, will ensure a verdict that the defendant is unfit to sit in the House of Commons, as he has been guilty of fraud". Hastings then called Gruban to the witness stand, and asked him to tell the jury what had happened. Gruban described how Booth had claimed to have influence over David Lloyd George. Gruban was then cross-examined by Rigby Swift.|$|E
500|$|The series {{not only}} explores Khan's {{conflicts}} with supervillains but also explores conflicts with Khan's home and religious duties. Wilson, a convert to Islam, said [...] "This is not evangelism. It {{was really important}} for me to portray Kamala as someone who is struggling with her faith." [...] Wilson continued, [...] "Her brother is extremely conservative, her mom is paranoid that she's going to touch a boy and get pregnant, and her father wants her to concentrate on her studies and become a doctor." [...] Amanat added, As much as Islam is a part of Kamala’s identity, this book isn't preaching about religion or the Islamic faith in particular. It's about what happens when you struggle with the labels imposed on you, and how that forms <b>your</b> <b>sense</b> of self. It's a struggle we've all faced in one form or another, and isn't just particular to Kamala because she's Muslim. Her religion is just one aspect of the many ways she defines herself.|$|E

500|$|Cisneros {{breaks the}} {{boundary}} between what is a socially acceptable way for women to act and speak and what is not, using language and imagery that have a [...] "boisterous humor" [...] and [...] "extrovert energy" [...] and are even at times [...] "deliberately shocking". Not all readers appreciate this [...] "shocking" [...] quality of some of Cisneros’s work. Both female and male readers have criticized Cisneros for the ways she celebrates her sexuality, such as the suggestive photograph of herself on the My Wicked, Wicked Ways cover (3rd Woman Press, 1987). Cisneros says of this photo: [...] "The cover is of a woman appropriating her own sexuality. In some ways, that’s also why it’s wicked: the scene is trespassing that boundary by saying 'I defy you. I'm going to tell my own story.'" [...] Some readers [...] "failed to perceive the transgressive meaning of the gesture", thinking that she was merely being lewd for shock value, and questioned her legitimacy as a feminist. Cisneros’s initial response to this was dismay, but then she reports thinking [...] "Wait a second, where’s <b>your</b> <b>sense</b> of humor? And why can’t a feminist be sexy?" ...|$|E
500|$|Overall, {{reception}} of the album was positive. Speaking of second-generation artists emerging around the same time, Allmusic's Jason Ankeny wrote that Wainwright [...] "deserves to be heard regardless of his family tree". Furthermore, Ankeny complimented the musician for his songwriting abilities and his [...] "knack for elegantly rolling piano melodies and poignantly romantic lyrics". Music journalist Robert Christgau characterized Wainwright as a [...] "mind-boggling original" [...] whose talent is [...] "too big to let pass". One NME reviewer called the album [...] "floridly impersonal and [...] "grandiosely arranged", but also criticized Wainwright for being [...] "too overwrought and naff". Greenwald complimented Martha's backing vocals on the song [...] "In My Arms", as well as Parks' [...] "positively sterling" [...] string arrangement on [...] "Millbrook". Furthermore, he praised the vocal duet between Rufus and Martha on [...] "Sally Ann", claiming that a similar sibling performance had not been heard since The Everly Brothers. The album's cabaret elements and 1970s singer-songwriter style drew comparisons to Cole Porter and Joni Mitchell. Josh Kun of Salon.com wrote that Wainwright poetically incorporated [...] "foolish love and fantasy love, healing love and destructive love and love that {{makes you want to}} lose <b>your</b> <b>sense</b> of self just so you can find it again." [...] Kun asserted that the songs were [...] "built on a similar set of angled melodies and hairpin turns of phrase", and that each [...] "succeeds as its own distinctly intimate portrait of emotion and desire." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although {{data showed}} crime was {{decreasing}} nationally, a 25–26 July Forum Research poll for the National Post suggested that Canadians believed otherwise. The recent mass shootings and media coverage had a majority fearing [...] "a violent crime wave". Pamela Rutledge, a media researcher studying the psychological impact of news coverage, {{stated that the}} apparent randomness of the crimes could lead to this perception. [...] "They really trigger a sense of fear in us because they aren't explainable [...] There's no way of making sense of it or figuring out why it didn't happen to me.

The drive against Post began to lose energy when Attorney General Palmer’s forecast of an attempted radical uprising on May Day 1920 failed to occur. Then, in testimony before the House Rules Committee on May 7–8, Post proved [...] "a convincing speaker with a caustic tongue" [...] and defended himself so successfully that Congressman Edward W.

2500|$|It is {{important}} to recognize when grief has turned into something more serious, thus mandating contacting a medical professional. Grief can result in depression or alcohol- and drug-abuse and, if left untreated, it can become severe enough to impact daily living. It recommends contacting a medical professional if [...] "you can’t deal with grief, you are using excessive amounts of drugs or alcohol, you become very depressed, or you have prolonged depression that interferes with your daily life." [...] Other reasons to seek medical attention may include: [...] "Can focus on little else but your loved one’s death, have persistent pining or longing for the deceased person, have thoughts of guilt or self-blame, believe that you did something wrong or could have prevented the death, feel as if life isn’t worth living, have lost <b>your</b> <b>sense</b> of purpose in life, wish you had died along with your loved one." ...|$|E
