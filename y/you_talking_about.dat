500|$|The {{episode is}} set on December 27, 2004, the survivors' 97th day on the island. [...] At the beach camp, the corpse of Ray (Marc Vann), the {{freighter}} Kahana doctor, washes ashore. [...] Daniel Faraday (Jeremy Davies) calls the freighter and asks what happened to Ray via morse code. [...] Daniel lies about the response, saying that rescue helicopters will be sent soon; however, Bernard Nadler (Sam Anderson) calls him on this and correctly interprets the freighter's message: [...] "What are <b>you</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about?</b> The doctor is fine." [...] Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox), who suffers from stomach pains throughout the day, forces Daniel to reveal that it was never their intention to rescue the survivors.|$|E
500|$|Darren {{came in for}} casting {{and began}} talking about knowing where to source the {{appropriate}} tuxedos, {{and that he could}} wear a pair of Dean Martin's shoes that he owned. During the course of the meeting, Behr became convinced that Darren was performing the Fontaine piece, having moved into it seamlessly. Darren had deliberately avoiding simply reading the script, as he disliked doing cold reads; instead, he had intentionally improvising things that he felt that the character would say. After Darren left, Behr excitedly told the other writers how good he was, but that perhaps they should still see other actors. Producer Hans Beimler replied, [...] "Are you out of your mind? What are <b>you</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about?</b> Vic Fontaine was just in the room. There's no question, there's no question! He's the guy!" ...|$|E
500|$|There {{are many}} {{unconfirmed}} stories about Henderson. A Padres teammate (variously reported as Steve Finley or Tony Gwynn) once {{offered him a}} seat anywhere on the bus, saying that Henderson had tenure. Henderson supposedly replied, [...] "Ten years? What are <b>you</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about?</b> Rickey got 16, 17 years." [...] One widely reported story was a fabrication that began as a clubhouse joke made by a visiting player. While playing for Seattle in 2000, Henderson {{was said to have}} commented on first baseman John Olerud's practice of wearing a batting helmet while playing defense, noting that a former teammate in Toronto did the same thing. Olerud was reported to have replied, [...] "That was me." [...] The two men had been together the previous season with the 1999 Mets, {{as well as with the}} 1993 World Champion Blue Jays. Several news outlets originally reported the story as fact.|$|E

500|$|Snyder's {{first cut}} of the film was three hours long. In keeping the film tight, Snyder dubbed himself [...] "the gatekeeper" [...] of the comic's easter eggs, [...] "while [...] conspire to say, 'No. Length, length, length. Playability.' [...] I've lost {{perspective}} on that now, because to me, the honest truth is I geek out on little stuff now as much as anybody. Like, people will go, 'We've got to cut. You don't need that shot of Hollis Mason's garage sign.' And I'm like, 'What are <b>you</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about?</b> Of course you do. Are you crazy? How will people enjoy the movie without shit like that in it?' So it's hard for me." [...] Snyder cut the film down to 162 minutes when he realized {{there was a way}} to further trim the film: removing the murder of Hollis Mason, the first Nite Owl, which [...] "was easy without destroying the movie".|$|E
500|$|Both Kanye West and Carlos Mencia responded {{within one}} day of the episode's {{original}} broadcast and said they enjoyed the parodies of themselves, although Kanye West said on his blog that his feelings were hurt. [...] After the episode was broadcast, Mencia wrote on his Twitter feed, [...] "They just made fun of me on South Park. I thought it was hysterical. Catch the rerun." [...] Dave Itzkoff, arts reporter for The New York Times, complimented Mencia for his response. West wrote on his blog, [...] "South Park murdered me last night and it's pretty damn funny. It hurts my feelings but what can you expect from South Park!" [...] West thanked the South Park writers in his blog entry and acknowledged {{he has a problem}} with his ego, but said he was trying to change. Parker and Stone said they were extremely surprised by West's reaction, and felt Mencia was treated far more harshly in the episode than West. Parker said, [...] "It was like, dude, we just said you were a gay fish. What are <b>you</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about?</b> It was so dumb." ...|$|E
500|$|IGN {{contributor}} Robert Canning {{wrote that}} the ending from this episode [...] "did have a season finale feel to it with the big musical number. [...] Still, {{it was a great}} season, and I loved going out with two of the best characters on TV summing up the moment perfectly – Liz: 'We sure had quite a year.' Jack: 'What are <b>you</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about?</b> It's May.'" [...] Canning gave it an 8.5 out of 10 rating. Television columnist Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger {{wrote that the}} [...] "all-star cast of musicians" [...] featured were not able to dominate the episode [...] "to the point where the episode didn't work." [...] Sepinwall, however, added that despite [...] "Kidney Now!" [...] not being a classic 30 Rock episode [...] "it was [...] funny enough – which, I suppose, also makes it an appropriate finale for this uneven season." [...] Further in the review, Sepinwall was complimentary towards Liz's plot, writing that the character's sequence on The Vontella Show was [...] "hilarious, and a fine demonstration of how much confidence Tina Fey has gained as an actress over the years." [...] The A.V. Club’s Nathan Rabin also enjoyed the Liz character, reporting that she [...] "delivered a virtuoso performance in , instantly homing in on the fatal flaw in every relationship and obliterating it with highly quotable sass." [...] In discussion to Tracy's plot, Rabin opined it was the [...] "weakest of the various threads" [...] in this episode. Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad confessed in his recap {{that he was going to}} summarize [...] "Kidney Now!" [...] as [...] "a little disappointing, but then I hit rewind on my DVR and watched it again and realized, wow, they actually hit all of the season finale notes rather perfectly [...] This episode was quite funny." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "I {{got it from}} Sherman, who is {{a friend}} of mine down in Mississippi, who had bought it down at a Goodwill store. When we were down there last time he says to me, 'I didn't tell you when you bought it off me, but that guitar used to be haunted'. I say, 'What are <b>you</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about,</b> Sherman?'. He says, 'There’s 50 solid {{citizens}} here in Como who'll tell you this guitar is haunted. It's the darnedest thing – we’d leave it over in the potato barn and we'd come back in and it would be moved. You'd put it down somewhere and the next morning you’d come back and it would have moved. When you took that guitar the ghost in the barn left'. He told me this not very long ago and I said to him, 'Sherman! Why didn't you tell me this before?' and he said, 'Well the ghost was gone – I didn't want it around here no more!'" ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{introduction}} of Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf) in Kingdom of the Crystal Skull led to speculation that LaBeouf {{will take over}} the franchise from Ford. In an interview with IGN, [...] "Spielberg indicated that LaBeouf has to make multiple Transformers movies before he can move over and take on the fedora and bullwhip of Indiana Jones." [...] The actor himself said, [...] "Am I into it? Who wouldn't be? I don't think that's reality. It's a fun rumor." [...] Ford said he would return for a fifth film {{if it does not}} take another twenty years to develop, while Spielberg responded it would happen [...] "only if you [...] want more". [...] In an interview with Time, when asked about passing the fedora to LaBeouf in the next film, Ford said, [...] "What are <b>you</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about?</b> It's mine. I would love to do another Indiana Jones movie. George Lucas is working on an idea now. Shia can get his own hat. I earned that hat." ...|$|E

2500|$|For {{the third}} {{series of the}} British game show Cluedo, Baker was cast as Professor Plum, a [...] "man {{with a degree in}} suspicion". He was also cast in the 2004 series Strange, as a blind priest who possessed {{knowledge}} of the Devil. Previously, he had appeared as a guest on the quiz show Have I Got News For You and was subsequently described by presenter Angus Deayton as the funniest guest in the series' history. A particular highlight was when Baker gave an anecdotal account of how, while entering a recording studio in Wales, he was accosted {{by a member of the}} public who told Baker: [...] "I will never forgive you, nor will my wife, for what you did to our grammar schools." [...] Baker responded with: [...] "What are <b>you</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about,</b> you daft bugger?" [...] to which the stranger replied: [...] "I'm so sorry. For a moment I thought you were Shirley Williams." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rose {{described}} {{the writing process}} for the album as [...] "a more personal experience to him", and said that due to the events that transpired in the prior year, he would sometimes have trouble coming up with words, and would often write gibberish as a temporary filler. While Rose would be the primary writer, all {{five members of the}} band would contribute. Rose focused on more distressing themes, while Witherspoon, who had just become a father, focused his lyrics on responsibility and commitment. The album's first single, [...] "Unraveling", was co-written by Lowery and is about the collapse of a relationship, while [...] "Confession" [...] indirectly addresses Lowery quitting and returning to the band. On Lowery's return, Rose spoke [...] "Since we all write, it's hard to tell exactly what each song is about, but we like to leave it up to the listeners to decide for themselves," [...] Rose says. [...] "It's funny because in the end you almost don't know what you wrote. I remember telling John one time, 'Dude, that was an amazing line you wrote,' and he went, 'What are <b>you</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about?</b> You wrote that.' We wanted to change the template completely from what we did with our last album, 'Hope And Sorrow'. We were going, 'Let's bring back those other elements Clint brought in that made us what we were.' So we sort of made a silent agreement {{that we were going to}} let Clint run wild. We said we'll jump in when it's time, but if you've got an idea let's go with it." ...|$|E
