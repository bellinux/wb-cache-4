40|$|The {{mechanism}} of the rapid inhibition of hypocotyl elongation by blue light was investigated in cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) and sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) seedlings by measuring the changes in turgor during the response. A special device, based on the resonance frequency principle, was built which permitted simultaneous and continuous measurements of both tissue rigidity (turgor) and growth rate on a single intact hypocotyl. The large decrease in growth rate following blue irradiation was consistently accompanied by a small increase in resonance frequency.

The aims of the study were: (I) to select mutant lines with good <b>yielding</b> <b>properties</b> by comparing mutant lines with mother cultivars for agronomic traits in the M 4 and M 5 generations and (ii) to advance the selected lines to the following generations. The lines used in the experiment were selected from mutant populations of durum wheat cultivars (Sofu and Gediz- 75) treated with etil-methane-sulfonate (EMS). The mutants were identified by visual screening for short straw, long spike and confirmed by measuring some characters of theoretical and practical interest in the M 2 and M 3 generations. The mutants with good <b>yielding</b> <b>properties</b> as compared to the mother cultivars were transferred to the M 4 generation. Eighteen of these lines were from cv.

It is possible to select higher yielding mutant lines with also some important agronomic traits. Selection of high yielding mutant lines could be performed in the M 5 and these lines as a breeding material transferred in the yield experiments. Thus, number of mutant lines can be decreased considerably by early selections in the M 4 and M 5. Mutant lines with desirable characters varied with cultivars. Gdem- 1, 2, 7 lines of cv.

In order to describe the Bauschinger and transient hardening behaviors as well as permanent softening during reverse loading, the modified Chaboche type combined isotropic–kinematic hardening law was applied.

As for weld zones, hardening properties were obtained using the rule of mixture and selectively by direct measurement using sub-sized specimens. Forming limit diagrams were measured for base materials but calculated for weld zones based on Hill’s bifurcation and M–K theories.

40|$|The {{physical}} analysis of plant cell enlargment is extended {{to show the}} dependence of turgor pressure and growth rate under steady-state conditions on the parameters which govern cell wall extension and water transport in growing cells and tissues, and to show the dynamic responses of turgor and growth rate to instantaneous changes {{in one of these}} parameters. The analysis is {{based on the fact that}} growth requires simultaneous water uptake and irreversible wall expansion. It shows that when a growing cell is perturbed from its steady-state growth rate, it will approach the steady-state rate with exponential kinetics. The half-time of the transient adjustment depends on the biophysical parameters governing both water transport and irreversible wall expansion. When wall extensibility is small compared to hydraulic conductance, the growth rate is controlled by the <b>yielding</b> <b>properties</b> of the cell wall, while the half-time for changes in growth rate is controlled by the water transport parameters.

We {{measured in}} vivo extensibility, tissue tension, hydraulic conductance and osmotic {{potential in the}} region of cell elongation in the uppermost internode. The in vivo extensibility of the internode, measured by stretching of living tissue with a custom-made constant stress extensiometer, rose rapidly following submergence of the plant. Both the elastic (Eel) and plastic (Epl) extensibility increased when growth of the internode was induced. The submerged internode displayed tissue tension (elastic outward bending of longitudinally split internode sections); in air-grown control internodes, no such bending occurred. The hydraulic conductance, estimated from the kinetics of tissue shrinkage in 0. 5 molar mannitol and subsequent swelling in distilled water, was not changed by submergence. The osmotic potential, measured with a dew-point hygrometer using frozen-thawed tissue, was only 18 % less negative in the submerged internode than in the air-grown control. This indicates that osmoregulation takes place in rapidly elongating rice internodes.
