40|$|Abstract. —We {{estimated}} {{the effects of}} gill-net mesh size regulations on the <b>yield</b> <b>per</b> <b>recruit</b> of Spanish mackerel Scomberomorus maculatus in Florida. <b>Yield</b> <b>per</b> <b>recruit</b> was calculated with a simulation model that incorporated seasonal fishing rates by sectors (recreational and commercial) and size-varying availabilities offish to the gear and retention probabilities once fish encountered the gear. Gains in yield (g) per recruit were always obtained by increasing mesh size, gill-net fishing mortality, or both. Adoption of a minimum length above the present enforced minimum 30. 5 cm fork length may result in considerable gains in <b>yield</b> <b>per</b> <b>recruit.</b> This, however, depends {{on the assumption that}} there is no cryptic mortality of undersized fish in the recreational fishery.

40|$|A major {{challenge}} for small-scale fisheries management is high spatial {{variability in the}} demography and life history characteristics of target species. Implementation of local management actions that can reduce overfishing and maximize yields requires quantifying ecological heterogeneity at small spatial scales and is therefore limited by available resources and data. Collaborative fisheries research (CFR) is an effective means to collect essential fishery information at local scales, and to develop the social, technical, and logistical framework for fisheries management innovation. We used a CFR approach with fishing partners to collect and analyze geographically precise demographic information for grass rockfish (Sebastes rastrelliger), a sedentary, nearshore species harvested in the live fish fishery on the West Coast of the USA. Data were used to estimate geographically distinct growth rates, ages, mortality, and length frequency distributions in two environmental subregions of the Santa Barbara Channel, CA, USA.

40|$|The {{mortality}} rate and <b>yield</b> <b>per</b> <b>recruit</b> of 'ghol, Pseudosciaena diacanthus, are estimated {{from the age}} composition of catches of the bull-trawlers of the New India Fisheries Ltd., Bombay, for the years 1958 to 1961. The annual {{mortality rate}} estimated from (1) catch per unit effort data and (2) the average catch curve of 1958 -' 61 lies roughly between 0. 55 and 0. 60 and the instantaneous mortality rate between 0. 83 and 0. 87. Since the fishery for 'ghol' was at the beginning stage with only two pairs of bull-trawlers operating commercially, the estimated total mortality rate (Z= 0. 83) is regarded as practically equal to natural mortality rate (M). The <b>yield</b> <b>per</b> <b>recruit</b> Yw/R for various lex els of fishing mortality (F) were calculated with M= 0. 83 and the maximum value of Yw/R was found at a value of F= 0. 6, which shows that the catch from the stock can be stepped up considerably over the present level. Before deciding to step up the catches of 'ghol' by expanding the trawl fishery, {{it is necessary to}} have estimates of fishing mortality generated by the. 'dol' nets and gill nets on this fish...|$|E
40|$|The ocean leatherjacket (Nelusetta ayraudi) has a {{long history}} of {{commercial}} exploitation in New South Wales, Australia. Records of reported landings indicate that substantial peaks of between 600 and 900 tonnes per annum occurred during the 1920 s and again during the 1950 s. These peaks were followed by large declines, which suggest that this species is vulnerable to over-exploitation. In recent years from 2000 / 01 to 2006 / 07, annual commercial landings of ocean leatherjackets using oceanic demersal fish traps and demersal otter trawl have increased from 134 to 430 tonnes. Between 2003 and 2005 ocean leatherjackets in commercial landings ranged approximately between 22 and 65 cm in total length. Ocean leatherjackets were fully recruited to the fishery at two years of age, with the majority of the catch (83 %) aged either two or three years. The instantaneous total mortality rate was estimated from an age-based catch curve as 1. 1. Natural mortality was estimated as approximately 0. 5, based on a maximum age of 6 years. <b>Yield</b> <b>per</b> <b>recruit</b> indicated that under current levels of exploitation the <b>yield</b> <b>per</b> <b>recruit</b> would be maximized at a length at first harvest of 35 cm in total length...|$|E

Cephalopods fishery in India is still in an infant stage with vast scope for exploitation. The present work on the cephalopods fishery along the Bombay coast is an effort to quantify the resource potential of Sepia acculeata.

40|$|Seventy nine {{inbred lines}} of {{sunflower}} {{were selected for}} the character association study to assess the relationship among oil yieldand its components.

Character association analysis revealed positive and significant association of oil <b>yield</b> <b>per</b> plant with seed <b>yield</b> <b>per</b> plant, plantheight, head diameter, volume weight, 100 -seed weight and oil content.

40|$|In {{the present}} study correlation, {{regression}} and path analyses were carried out to decide correlations among the agro - nomic traits and their contributions to seed <b>yield</b> <b>per</b> plant in Crambe abyssinica. Partial correlation analysis indicated that plant height (X 1) was significantly correlated with branching height {{and the number of}} first branches (P 2) was significantly correlated with pod number of primary inflorescence (P 3) was significantly correlated with number of secondary branches (P - grain weight (P 4) was significantly correlated with seed <b>yield</b> <b>per</b> plant (P 7) was significantly correlated with seed <b>yield</b> <b>per</b> plant (P - grain weight (P - grain weight (X 8) was significantly correlated with seed <b>yield</b> <b>per</b> plant (P - grain weight contributed significantly to seed <b>yield</b> <b>per</b> plant at P 7) and 1000 - grain weight (X 8) to seed <b>yield</b> <b>per</b> plant (Y) is Y = 0. 006 X 7 + 1. 222 X 8  - 7. 191. The path coefficient of pod number per plant to seed <b>yield</b> <b>per</b> plant was 0. 967 and that of 1000 - grain weight was 0. 194. The determination coefficient of pod number per plant and 1000 - grain weight to seed <b>yield</b> <b>per</b> plant was 0. 983 and the determination coefficient of other agronomic traits was 0. 130. Coefficient of variance indicated that the length of primary inflorescence showed the greatest variation, followed by seed <b>yield</b> <b>per</b> plant, pod number per plant, number of secondary branches, branching height, pod number of primary inflorescence, number of first branches, seed <b>yield</b> <b>per</b> plot, 1000 - grain w eight and plant height. It was suggested that seed <b>yield</b> <b>per</b> plant in Crambe might be improved by increasing the pod number per plant through selection or cultivation, but the negative correlation between pod number per plant and 1000 - grain weight also needs to be considered. </span...|$|R
40|$|This report {{provides}} {{the results of}} the first underwater television on the ‘Porcupine Bank Nephrops grounds’ ICES assessment area; Functional Unit 16. The survey was multi-disciplinary in nature collecting UWTV, CTD and other ecosystem data. The UWTV results and a scientific basis for survey based catch advice in 2013 are presented. In total 47 UWTV stations were successfully completed. The mean burrow density was 0. 19 burrows/m² (empirical 95 % confidence intervals are from 0. 17 - 0. 21). The final krigged abundance estimate was 992 million burrows with a relative standard error of 5 % and an estimated stock area of 7, 100 km 2. This abundance estimate can be considered as a conservative estimate given that the spatial coverage of {{the southern part of the}} ground was not complete. A correction factor of 1. 26 is proposed based on expert judgments of burrow size and potential detection and identification biases. A <b>yield</b> and spawner <b>per</b> <b>recruit</b> analysis was used to estimate a harvest rate of 5. 0 % for the combined sex F 0. 1 and other F reference points. This harvest rate is low compared to other FUs and can be considered very conservative. Applying this harvest rate to the abundance observed in the survey and using a mean weight in the landings of 45. 0 g implies landings in 2013 of 1, 770 t. The results here could form the basis of the catch advice for 2013. Use the URI link below to search the Marine Institute Data Discovery Catalogue for datasets relevant to this report...|$|R
