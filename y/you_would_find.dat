However, suspicions on the veracity of doorjamb fingerprints found at the Brown crime scene have arisen, including charges that the police planted the fingerprint since it allegedly looks like a rolled fingerprint, the type that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>find</b> on a police fingerprint index card. Both sets of prints have come under serious question as to their validity, good faith collection and possible contamination; even the possibility of their being planted.|$|E

500|$|Speaking to The Times {{about the}} ending of the show in 1989, Curtis hinted that the {{collaborative}} writing process caused tensions amongst the cast: [...] "Everybody on the show thinks they can put in good jokes, despite the fact that Ben Elton and I think there are already quite a few good ones in there to start with. It does usually end up funnier, but it's time to do something over which I have more control." [...] Twenty years on, Curtis recalled in the documentary Blackadder Rides Again that: [...] "They would literally sit around for the entire time discussing the script...sometimes we would just say to them [...] "if you stood up and tried to act this script out, <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>find</b> out things about it." [...] Ben Elton stated that by opening it up, they allowed the cast to question every aspect of the script.|$|E
500|$|Larkin {{chose the}} {{instrumentation}} for each track {{based on the}} various digital environments in the game. When the player is in the game's representation of New Mexico, for example, Larkin used a resonator guitar and flutes, creating what he called something [...] "indigenous to a southwest type of feel that's very contemporary". In other areas Larkin described the game's music as being [...] "less typical than <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>find</b> in most games" [...] because of the exotic landscape the developers had created. To create contemporary and exotic types of music in the game, Larkin employed a combination of real and synthesized instruments. Sometimes Larkin replaced synthesized performances with those of real musicians, as in the track [...] "Gallery Theme", where a synthesized vocal part was eventually discarded in favor of soprano Tasha Koontz. To create an exotic feel, Larkin used a group of Maasai tribesmen's chanting, who were recorded during their visit to Spokane, Washington, where Cyan Worlds was located at that time.|$|E
500|$|Tonight is {{a concept}} album that explores the highs and lows {{associated}} with an evening of debauchery, as stated by a critic on online publication Ventvox. [...] "This album covers all its bases from the initial excitement of the early evening to the numbness of the morning after", writes the reviewer. The line [...] "come on, let's get high" [...] from [...] "Ulysses", the album's first track, reveals this theme. The album has been influenced by non-British music. It has been inspired by the [...] "heavy dub sound of Jamaican reggae stars" [...] and has [...] "the heavy bass and space echo <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>find</b> on a dub mix." [...] The album also has somewhat of an African influence. Alex Kapranos stated in an XFM article that [...] "We're one of these bands that are always gonna sound the same {{no matter what we}} do, but there are other influences there. I guess the drums are a little different, Paul has been listening to a lot of African stuff so that's gonna come through." ...|$|E

500|$|Extant {{biographies of}} Epaminondas universally {{describe}} {{him as one of}} the most talented generals ever produced by the Greek city-states. Even Xenophon, who fails to note his presence at Leuctra, says of his Mantinean campaign: [...] "Now I for my part could not say that his campaign proved fortunate; yet of all possible deeds of forethought and daring the man seems to me to have left not one undone." [...] Diodorus is effusive in his praise for Epaminondas's military record: [...] "For it seems to me that he surpassed his contemporaries...in skill and experience in the art of war. For among the generation of Epaminondas were famous men: Pelopidas the Theban, [...] Timotheus and Conon, also Chabrias and Iphicrates...Agesilaus the Spartan, who belonged to a slightly older generation. Still earlier than these, in the times of the Medes and Persians, there were Solon, Themistocles, Miltiades, and Cimon, Myronides, and Pericles and certain others in Athens, and in Sicily Gelon, son of Deinomenes, and still others. All the same, if you should compare the qualities of these with the generalship and reputation of Epaminondas, <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>find</b> the qualities possessed by Epaminondas far superior".|$|E
500|$|The first {{critical}} review of Very's book {{was written by}} Margaret Fuller and published in Orestes Brownson's Boston Quarterly Review; it said Very's poems had [...] "an elasticity of spirit, a genuine flow of thought, and unsought nobleness and purity", though she admitted she preferred the prose in the collection over the poetry. She mocked the [...] "sing song" [...] style of the poems and questioned his religious mission. She concluded: [...] "I am... greatly interested in Mr Very. He seems worthy to be well known." [...] James Freeman Clarke admired Very's poetry enough to have several published in his journal, the Western Messenger, between 1838 and 1840. William Ellery Channing admired Very's poetry as well, writing that his insanity [...] "is only superficial". Richard Henry Dana Sr. also commented positively on Very's poetry: [...] "The thought is deeply spiritual; and {{while there is a}} certain character of peculiarity which we so often find in like things from our old writers, there is a freedom from quaintness... Indeed, I know not where <b>you</b> <b>would...</b> <b>find</b> any thing in this country to compare with these Sonnets." ...|$|E

It was Hunt's third series credit (his other two being [...] "The Man from the Other Side" [...] and [...] "The Box"). Leading up to the episode's broadcast, executive producer Jeff Pinkner remarked {{in a conference call}} with journalists that it was a [...] "game-changer" [...] because [...] "our characters learn a lot more and the audience is going to learn a lot more about the über-plot of the season’s bad guy, David Robert Jones." [...] Referring to the Observer September, Pinker added that the episode would also peel [...] "back some layers about what his agenda has been and use that as an opportunity to revisit the things on the show we’ve seen before." [...] Fellow executive producer J.H. Wyman elaborated [...] "We always said <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>find</b> out about the Observers this season {{and we were going to}} investigate them a lot more. We’re excited about it all. That’s a highlight– the Observers are a highlight. For us to constantly break what you know and reset and have people go, 'Wow, I didn’t see that coming!' That’s why we get up in the morning is to take people along for the ride. We’re excited about what’s coming up, too." ...|$|E

[...] Originally called, [...] "The Game," [...] it has quickly grown {{into one of the most}} popular and far-reaching elements of the show. The show now holds the annual tradition of matching up entries in the Looks Like Game with teams in the NCAA Tournament and updating the results with each round. The Looks Like Game is also frequently the ending to athlete interviews, particularly if the athlete is associated with a team that has a popular entry. In addition, weekly interviews during the baseball season with Tim Kurkjian are concluded with new submissions to the Looks Like Game because Kurkjian finds the game particularly humorous and often gives uproarious laughter to the segment.|$|E
