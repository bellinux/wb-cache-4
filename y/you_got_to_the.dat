In this case they would probably burst into tears when their dish is mentioned. It would be a heavenly picnic.” ...|$|E

5000|$|Editor Christopher Gay {{spoke about}} the episode in August 2012: Narratively speaking, we wanted the stories of these three {{relations}} of Peggy, Roger, and Don to be their own story. We wanted {{to give you a}} little bit more each time you saw each of the three story lines so that when <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> third one, everything totally made sense. I've talked to people and they've had to watch it a few times to fully digest. Also, the score in the episode is pretty unique and more tonal and atmospheric than what we normally do. It's a guide, too, that helps you feel when one story is ending and another is coming in and knowing that the shift is happening. I think the score and the sound design definitely helped guide the narrative.|$|E

5000|$|The {{season has}} {{ultimately}} met a negative reception, {{primarily due to}} the cast being seen as fairly forgettable, and the final two and winner Vecepia Towery being perceived as having poor gameplay. However, {{the use of the}} Purple Rock tiebreaker {{has been one of the}} most polarizing moments in Survivor history, with critics divided on whether or not it was an unfair solution to a tie, or if it made for entertaining television. Host Jeff Probst was not fond of this season, ranking it his second-to-least favorite (as of season 19). Probst stated, [...] "Dramatically, I just felt like Marquesas never got any momentum, and by the time <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> final two with Neleh and Vecepia — I'm sleeping." [...] He also said that the environment in Marquesas was the most brutally unpleasant in the show's history due to the biting no-no flies. However, Survivor columnist Dalton Ross of Entertainment Weekly gave this season a positive review, calling it, [...] "an underrated season that saw the first totem pole shake-up: where people on the bottom got together to overthrow those on the top. Yes, it was a weak final two, but it also had a woman peeing on a guy's hand. Plus: Purple rock!!!" [...] The exit of John Carroll is widely considered to be the foundation of modern Survivor strategy by columnists and fans alike. Joe Reid of The Wire ranked it among the bottom 10, at #19, in 2014, saying that Rob had [...] "a comparatively ignominious debut" [...] despite his future reputation, called John [...] "a preening dyngus," [...] and said that [...] "Vecepia backing into a victory because she didn't piss anyone off was anti-climactic." [...] Fansite [...] "The Purple Rock Podcast" [...] also ranked Marquesas in the bottom 10 at #20, saying that although the season [...] "gets bonus points" [...] for featuring the Purple Rock, the season [...] "sort of limps to the finish line" [...] in its storytelling and character narratives. Former Survivor contestant and reality TV podcaster Rob Cesternino also ranked it in the bottom 10 at #21, while a corresponding poll on his website saw it rank just outside the bottom 10 at #18.|$|E
