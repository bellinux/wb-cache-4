5|$|In Vienna, {{two women}} were {{poisoned}} at their workplace in 1997, and the measured concentrations {{in one of them}} were the highest ever measured in a human being, 144,000 pg/g of fat. This is about one hundred thousandfold compared with TCDD concentrations in most people today, and about ten thousandfold compared with the sum of all dioxin-like compounds in <b>young</b> <b>people</b> <b>today.</b> She survived but suffered from difficult chloracne for several years. The poisoning likely happened in October 1997, but was not discovered until April 1998. At the institute where the women worked as secretaries, high concentrations of TCDD were found in one of the labs, suggesting that the compound had been produced there. The police investigation failed to find clear evidence and no one was ever prosecuted. Aside from malaise and amenorrhea there were surprisingly few other symptoms or abnormal laboratory findings.|$|E

40|$|The role of {{critical}} imagination in research with <b>young</b> <b>people</b> The postmodern {{world of difference}} and uncertainty invites people to dream and to “imagine the unimaginable ” (O’Farrell, 1999, p. 15) to maximise choices and freedoms, particularly within the otherwise constraining systems of education. Various forms of imagination {{can be applied to}} ways of working with disadvantaged high school students as researchers, helping them to reconnect their lifeworlds with the education systems to which they are subject. The SARUA (Student Action Research for University Access) project is presented here as an example of such activity in which a disciplined and critical imagination can help to empower <b>young</b> <b>people.</b> Critical theory provides a framework for empowering research with <b>young</b> <b>people,</b> such as in the SARUA project, and it too can be strengthened through the “art of imagining ” (Grundy, 1996) to increase its relevance to students living in postmodern times. The role {{of critical}} imagination in research with <b>young</b> <b>people</b> <b>Today’s</b> youth inhabit a world where roles, traditions and understandings are shifting at an unprecedented rate. In these postmodern times, the only certainty left is that of uncertainty and risk. The postmodern world of difference and uncertainty, however, invites people to dream and to “imagine the unimaginable ” to maximise choices and freedoms, particularly within the otherwise constraining systems of education (O’Farrell, 1999). This paper, based on a current PhD research project, should be understood as a work-in-progress leading to discussion and enlargement of the ideas out forward. The paper considers the role of imagination in various forms applied to working with <b>young</b> <b>people</b> as researchers, exemplified by the SARUA (Studen...|$|R
