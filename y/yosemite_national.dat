5|$|Even {{before the}} {{establishment}} of <b>Yosemite</b> <b>National</b> Park, tourists began to travel into the Merced Canyon and Yosemite Valley as early as 1855. The first roads were constructed into Yosemite Valley in the 1870s. The first was Coulterville Road, followed by Big Oak Flat Road, a trading route from Stockton to Merced Canyon. Environmental movements led by John Muir and Robert Underwood Johnson convinced the U.S. Congress to establish <b>Yosemite</b> <b>National</b> Park in 1890. With {{the creation of the}} national park tourism to the Valley and the Merced River increased significantly, leading to many other roads being built throughout the upper Merced River watershed. Other national forests protecting more of the Merced River upper basin followed, including Sierra National Forest and Stanislaus National Forest.|$|E
5|$|While most {{pesticide}} {{effects are}} likely to be local and restricted to areas near agriculture, there is evidence from the Sierra Nevada mountains of the western United States that pesticides are traveling long distances into pristine areas, including <b>Yosemite</b> <b>National</b> Park in California.|$|E

50|$|He was a {{founding}} member of the American Society of Landscape Architects and actively involved in numerous planning and design organizations and commissions, including the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, the National Capital Park and Planning Commission, the Baltimore Park Commission, the National Park Service Board of Advisers for <b>Yosemite,</b> the <b>National</b> Conference on City Planning, the American City Planning Institute, the National Institute of Arts and Letters, and the American Academy in Rome. Olmsted received many awards and honors during his long career, among them the American Academy Gold Medal (1949) and the U.S. Department of the Interior Conservation Award (1956).|$|R
5|$|Muir and his Sierra Club {{continued}} to lobby {{the government and}} influential people {{for the creation of}} a unified <b>Yosemite</b> <b>National</b> Park. In May 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt camped with Muir near Glacier Point for three days. On that trip, Muir convinced Roosevelt to take control of Yosemite Valley and Mariposa Grove away from California and return it to the federal government. In 1906, Roosevelt signed a bill that did precisely that.|$|E
5|$|Yosemite's first {{concession}} {{was established}} in 1884 when John Degnan and his wife established a bakery and store. In 1916, the National Park Service granted a 20-year concession to the Desmond Park Service Company. It bought out or built hotels, stores, camps, a dairy, a garage, and other park services. Desmond {{changed its name to}} the <b>Yosemite</b> <b>National</b> Park Company in December 1917 and was reorganized in 1920.|$|E
5|$|Galen Clark {{retired as}} the state grant's {{guardian}} in 1896, leaving Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove of Big Trees under ineffective stewardship. Pre-existing problems in the state grant worsened and new problems arose, but the cavalry could only monitor the situation. Muir and the Sierra Club continued to lobby the government and influential people {{for the creation of}} a unified <b>Yosemite</b> <b>National</b> Park. The Sierra Club began to organize annual trips to Yosemite in 1901 in an effort to make the remote area more accessible.|$|E
30|$|At {{the same}} time that the Starr King fire was burning in <b>Yosemite,</b> Grand Teton <b>National</b> Park was contending with the equally large Waterfall Canyon fire, which was pouring smoke into Jackson, Wyoming. Considerable public outcry {{occurred}} when the smoke obscured the mountains, and some accused the park of having a “scorched earth” policy (Kilgore 1975). The fire burned into October when late autumn snows extinguished it.|$|R
5000|$|Grizzly Peak is themed around California's {{wilderness}} and national parks with particular references to <b>Yosemite</b> and Redwood <b>national</b> parks. Its main attraction is Grizzly River Run, a Gold Rush-esque river rapids ride around {{the summit of}} Grizzly Peak. Nearby is the Redwood Creek Challenge Trail; a playground area that includes elements from Disney's Brother Bear and Disney·Pixar's Up. A special entrance exclusive to guests of Disney's Grand Californian Hotel & Spa is located in this area.|$|R
5000|$|EWG {{has used}} {{computer}} mapping tools {{to demonstrate the}} surge in mining claims near the Grand Canyon, <b>Yosemite</b> and other <b>national</b> parks. The House of Representatives passed the first update of the nation’s hardrock mining law since 1872 in 2007. The bill, which bans mining claims around national parks and wilderness and imposes the first-ever royalties on minerals taken from public lands, awaits action in the Senate. [...] EWG staff testified before both the House and Senate during consideration of mining reform.|$|R
5|$|In 1864, Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove {{of giant}} sequoia trees were {{transferred}} from federal to state ownership. Yosemite pioneer Galen Clark became the park's first guardian. Conditions in Yosemite Valley were made more hospitable {{to people and}} access to the park was improved in the late 19th century. Naturalist John Muir and others became increasingly alarmed about the excessive exploitation of the area. Their efforts helped establish <b>Yosemite</b> <b>National</b> Park in 1890. Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove were added to the national park in 1906.|$|E
5|$|Lincoln {{is largely}} {{responsible}} for the institution of the Thanksgiving holiday in the United States. Before Lincoln's presidency, Thanksgiving, while a regional holiday in New England since the 17th century, had been proclaimed by the federal government only sporadically and on irregular dates. The last such proclamation had been during James Madison's presidency 50 years before. In 1863, Lincoln declared the final Thursday in November of that year to be a day of Thanksgiving. In June 1864, Lincoln approved the Yosemite Grant enacted by Congress, which provided unprecedented federal protection for the area now known as <b>Yosemite</b> <b>National</b> Park.|$|E
5|$|Overgrazing of meadows (especially by sheep), logging {{of giant}} sequoia, and other damage caused Muir {{to become an}} {{advocate}} for further protection. Muir convinced prominent guests {{of the importance of}} putting the area under federal protection; one such guest was Robert Underwood Johnson, editor of Century Magazine. Muir and Johnson lobbied Congress for the Act that created <b>Yosemite</b> <b>National</b> Park on October 1, 1890. The State of California, however, retained control of Yosemite Valley and Mariposa Grove. Muir also helped persuade local officials to virtually eliminate grazing from the Yosemite high country.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} year {{he sold his}} company. He left the Bay Area in 1882 and moved to Victoria, British Columbia. While there, he participated in the Amos Bowman Geological Survey. While participating in the survey, he served as draftsman and documented the Cascade Mountains. In 1884 he {{moved back to the}} United States and traveled throughout the northwest and west, painting such sites as Mt. Rainier. He lived in Portland, Oregon, painting landscapes and also traveling to <b>Yosemite</b> and Yellowstone <b>National</b> Park to paint.|$|R
50|$|Johnson entered West Point in 1899, and {{graduated}} and was commissioned a second {{lieutenant in the}} 1st Cavalry on June 11, 1903. Douglas MacArthur {{was one of his}} West Point classmates. From 1907 to 1909 he was stationed at Pampanga, Philippines, but later was transferred to California. In {{the early years of the}} 20th century, most national parks in the United States were administered by units of the United States Army. Johnson was subsequently stationed at <b>Yosemite</b> and Sequoia <b>national</b> parks. He was promoted to first lieutenant on March 11, 1911, and was named superintendent of Sequoia National Park in 1912.|$|R
5000|$|Clyde began {{climbing}} in the Sierra Nevada in 1910, when {{he visited}} <b>Yosemite</b> and Sequoia <b>National</b> Parks, writing to his mother that [...] "I climbed the highest mountains in the region". He also visited McCloud, near Mount Shasta, that summer. He began a regimented program of mountaineering in the Sierra Nevada in 1914, including {{the first of his}} first ascents. He also joined the Sierra Club in 1914. He first climbed Mount Shasta in 1916, and climbed that peak a total of 12 times. While living in Southern California during his wife's illness, he climbed Mount San Jacinto in 1917. Following his wife's death in 1919, he climbed extensively in the Kings-Kern Divide region of the southern Sierra.|$|R
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began in}} October 1988, {{in and around}} Los Angeles, California. Shortly {{before the beginning of}} location shooting, Hollywood union truck drivers or teamsters went on strike to protest pay cuts and overtime changes. With deadlines looming, the production searched for non-union drivers, aware that the Teamsters might retaliate by sabotaging equipment or flying airplanes above the filming to ruin audio recordings. After one of the production's camera trucks exploded in the studio parking lot, the non-union drivers headed to <b>Yosemite</b> <b>National</b> Park under cover of darkness with a police escort.|$|E
5|$|The crew of {{the newly}} {{commissioned}} USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-A) are enjoying shore leave after the starship's shakedown cruise goes poorly. At <b>Yosemite</b> <b>National</b> Park James T. Kirk, recently demoted back to Captain after {{the events of the}} previous two films, is camping with Spock and Dr. Leonard McCoy. Their leave is interrupted when the Enterprise is ordered by Starfleet Command to rescue human, Klingon, and Romulan hostages on the planet Nimbus III. Learning of the Enterprises mission, the Klingon Captain Klaa decides to pursue Kirk for personal glory.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Mark Kirkland {{and a lot of}} new designs and backgrounds had to be created for the wilderness scenes. The backgrounds were designed by animator Debbie Silver. The design of the forest ranger was based on then-Vice President Al Gore. In the episode, Marge watches an old film which includes a comment from naturalist John Muir. The impression of Muir was done by Dan Castellaneta, who originally based the voice on an impersonator he met at <b>Yosemite</b> <b>National</b> Park. However, the producers asked him to make the voice older and crazier.|$|E
5000|$|The Scottish-born, American naturalist John Muir (1838 -1914), {{was another}} {{important}} early {{advocate of the}} preservation of wilderness in the United States. He petitioned the U.S. Congress for the National Park bill that was passed in 1890, establishing <b>Yosemite</b> and Sequoia <b>National</b> Parks. The Sierra Club, which he founded, {{is now one of}} the most important conservation organizations in the United States. The spiritual quality and enthusiasm toward nature expressed in his writings inspired others, including presidents and congressmen, to take action to help preserve large areas of undeveloped countryside. He is today referred to as the [...] "Father of the National Parks". In 1916, the National Park Service was created to protect national parks and monuments.|$|R

5000|$|John Muir ( [...] ; April 21, 1838 - December 24, 1914) {{also known}} as [...] "John of the Mountains", was a Scottish-American naturalist, author, {{environmental}} philosopher, glaciologist and early advocate {{for the preservation of}} wilderness in the United States. His letters, essays, and books describing his adventures in nature, especially in the Sierra Nevada, have been read by millions. His activism has helped to preserve the <b>Yosemite</b> Valley, Sequoia <b>National</b> Park and many other wilderness areas. The Sierra Club, which he founded, is a prominent American conservation organization. The 211 mi John Muir Trail, a hiking trail in the Sierra Nevada, was named in his honor. Other such places include Muir Woods National Monument, Muir Beach, John Muir College, Mount Muir, Camp Muir and Muir Glacier. In Scotland, the John Muir Way, a 130-mile-long route, was named in honor of him.|$|R
5|$|Development for Firewatch {{began with}} a single {{painting}} by Moss. Jane Ng, lead environmental artist at Campo Santo, was tasked with translating Moss' work into 3D environments while maintaining his stylized artistic vision. Moss, who had previously been known primarily for his graphic design work, had joined Vanaman and Rodkin to found Campo Santo after spending many years working {{on the periphery of}} game development. In creating the painting, Moss emulated National Park Service posters from the New Deal era in both color palette and iconography. The development team went on a camping trip to <b>Yosemite</b> <b>National</b> Park for inspiration for the game, where they visited a lookout tower built with the same design as its video game counterpart. Further inspiration for the game came from Vanaman and Anderson's experiences growing up in rural Wyoming.|$|E
5|$|Like Yellowstone National Park before it, <b>Yosemite</b> <b>National</b> Park was {{at first}} {{administered}} by various units of the United States Army. Captain Abram Wood led the 4th Cavalry Regiment into the new park on May 19, 1891, and set up Camp A.E. Wood (now the Wawona Campground) in Wawona. Each summer, 150 cavalrymen traveled from the Presidio of San Francisco to patrol the park. Approximately 100,000 sheep were illegally led into Yosemite's high meadows each year. The Army lacked legal authority to arrest the herders, but instead escorted them several days' hike from their flock, which left the sheep vulnerable. By the late 1890s sheep grazing {{was no longer a}} problem, but at least one herder continued to graze his sheep in the park into the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|The Merced River and {{its tributaries}} are a popular {{recreational}} area {{in part because of}} <b>Yosemite</b> <b>National</b> Park. There are many activities within the watershed, including boating, fishing, camping and hiking. Whitewater rafting is permitted throughout Merced River Canyon from the downstream half of Yosemite Valley to the entrance of Lake McClure. The most difficult rapids in this segment rate Class III and Class IV, mostly upstream of El Portal. There is also boating on Lake McClure. Camping throughout the upper Merced watershed is generally only permitted in designated campgrounds. Campgrounds along the Merced River {{and its tributaries}} include ones at Railroad Flat, McCabe Flat, Willow Placer, Merced Lake, Vogelsang Lake, Sunrise Creek, May Lake, Bridalveil Creek, and a ski hut at Ostrander Lake, the source of Bridalveil Creek.|$|E
50|$|Watkins often photographed Yosemite {{and had a}} {{profound}} influence over the politicians debating its preservation as a national park. His photographs did more than just capture the national park; he created an icon. Half Dome, for example, did already exist, but Watkins’ photographs brought it to people {{in a way that}} they could experience it. It became iconic through his photographs, became something people wanted to see in person. His images had a more concrete impact on <b>Yosemite</b> becoming a <b>national</b> park than just encouraging people to visit. It is said that Senator John Conness passed Watkins’ photographs around Congress. His photography was also said to have influenced President Abraham Lincoln and was one of the major factors in Lincoln signing the bill in 1864 declaring Yosemite Valley inviolable. The bill paved the way for the National Parks system in its entirety. One of Yosemite’s many mountains is named Mount Watkins in honor of Watkins’ part in preserving Yosemite Valley.|$|R
40|$|The National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) {{was used}} to {{simulate}} several winter storms traveling across <b>Yosemite</b> and Yellowstone <b>National</b> Parks, two tropical storms originating in the Caribbean Ocean, two tropical cyclones in the Arabian Sea, and three nor’easters on the East Coast of North America. The wind speed, precipitation, and pressure fields for each simulated storm compared well with characteristics of the observed storms. The sea-surface temperature of the Pacific, Atlantic, and Arabian Sea were artificially heated by 10 o C (18 o F) to approximate the conditions following the Genesis Flood and simulations run again. Changes in winds, storm motion, and precipitation were analyzed for the warmer temperature. The current locations of North America, the Arabian Sea, the Caribbean Ocean, and the East Coast of the United States {{were used in the}} simulations. Wind speed and precipitation were dramatically increased for all cases, as much as a six-fold increase in precipitation for the mountains of the western United States and in northeastern North America. The increased precipitation rate would have produced glaciers on the order of 1. 1 km (3, 000 feet) thick in less than 500 years. Tropical cyclones increased in intensity to becom...|$|R
30|$|Fire scars are {{a primary}} source of {{information}} for documenting the historic fire regimes. Several studies in Yosemite have determined that fires were frequent {{in the past but}} decreased sharply after the mid- 1800 s, coinciding with Euro-American settlement of the Yosemite region. Swetnam (1993) reported fire scar records in five giant sequoia groves located from <b>Yosemite</b> to Sequoia <b>National</b> Park that confirmed the presence of fire in the Sierra Nevada for the past 3, 000 years. Between 1300 and the mid- 1800 s, intervals free of fire scars ranged from less than 13 yr during dry periods to between 15 yr and 30 yr during cool periods. Swetnam et al. (2000) examined fire scars in the southwestern part of Yosemite along a transect from 1, 090 m to 2, 425 m. They found that mean fire return intervals for fires recorded by 25 % or more of the fire-scarred trees ranged from 4.94 yr in ponderosa pine at the lowest elevation to 10.57 yr in Jeffrey pine at the highest. Swetnam et al. (2000) also found that 55 % of the fire scars occurred in the latewood part of the tree ring, indicating that these fires burned between July and early October. An additional 21 % occurred between June and July and 17 % between mid-September and December.|$|R
