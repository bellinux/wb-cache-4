Television personality Ed McMahon also resided at the Drexelbrook, as Dick Clark's neighbor, prior to teaming up with Johnny Carson on Do <b>You</b> <b>Trust</b> Your Wife?, then The Tonight Show.

25|$|Griffin {{scored a}} coup when Tonight Show host Jack Paar accidentally emerged onto {{the set of}} Play Your Hunch during a live broadcast, and Griffin got him {{to stay for a}} {{spontaneous}} interview. After Paar left The Tonight Show, but before Johnny Carson took over (Carson was still hosting Who Do <b>You</b> <b>Trust?</b> for ABC), Griffin was one of the many guest hosts who presided over Tonight in the interim. Griffin was considered the most successful of the guest hosts, and was rewarded with his own daytime talk show on NBC in 1962. This live, 55-minute program was not successful however, and was cancelled in 1963.|$|E
25|$|Johnny Carson's {{success on}} ABC's Who Do <b>You</b> <b>Trust?</b> led NBC to {{invite him to}} take over Tonight {{a few months before}} Paar's departure. Carson {{declined}} the offer because he feared the difficulty of interviewing celebrities for 105 minutes daily. Bob Newhart, Jackie Gleason, Groucho Marx, and Joey Bishop all also declined. NBC finally convinced Carson to sign by early February 1962. Carson can be seen discussing his upcoming job {{for the first time on}} the February 11, 1962, episode of What's My Line?. Due to Carson having six months left on his ABC contract, NBC used multiple guest hosts until he could take over. Guest hosts included Merv Griffin, Art Linkletter, Joey Bishop, Arlene Francis (the first woman to host The Tonight Show), Bob Cummings, Jerry Lewis, Groucho Marx, Donald O'Connor, and others.|$|E

500|$|Teasing John's role in [...] "Exit Wounds" [...] Marsters {{stated that}} he's someone [...] "who's in way {{over his head}} and doesn't even know it yet" [...] and that [...] "things do change" [...] in regards to his character. Chibnall, Marsters and {{producer}} Richard Stokes discuss the role of [...] "Exit Wounds" [...] in developing John's character and placing him on a redemptive path. Marsters felt the character to be on a [...] "journey" [...] whilst Chibnall deliberately played upon the question of [...] "can <b>you</b> <b>trust</b> him, or can't you?" [...] Stokes commented that the character isn't the [...] "selfish and anarchic" [...] character seen in [...] "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang" [...] and that his [...] "affection and love for Captain Jack are enough to make him try and do the noble thing". Stephen James Walker, a writer of reference works on Doctor Who and its spin-offs, notes that because of the reluctance of Hart's collaboration with Gray and his remorse for his actions the episode leaves the audience [...] "a little more favourably disposed" [...] towards the character. In April 2008 Marsters indicated that he expected to return to Torchwood in the near future. He later expressed a desire to be part of Torchwoods fourth series after it was revealed the show would be largely produced in Los Angeles.|$|E
500|$|The cast of Blue Velvet {{included}} several then-relatively unknown actors. Isabella Rossellini had gained some exposure before the film for her Lancôme {{ads in the}} early 1980s and for being the daughter of actress Ingrid Bergman and Italian film director Roberto Rossellini. After completion of the film, during test screenings, ICM Partners—the agency representing Rossellini—immediately dropped her as a client. Furthermore, the nuns at the school in Rome that Rossellini attended in her youth called {{to say they were}} praying for her. Dennis Hopper was the biggest [...] "name" [...] in the film, having starred in Easy Rider (1969), while Kyle MacLachlan had played the central role in Lynch's critical and commercial failure Dune (1984), a science fiction epic based on the novel of the same name. MacLachlan later became a recurring collaborator with Lynch, who remarked: [...] "Kyle plays innocents who are interested in the mysteries of life. He's the person <b>you</b> <b>trust</b> enough to go into a strange world with." [...] Dennis Hopper—said to be Lynch's third choice—accepted the role, reportedly having exclaimed, [...] "I've got to play Frank! I am Frank!" [...] as Hopper confirmed in the Blue Velvet [...] "making-of" [...] documentary The Mysteries of Love, produced for the 2002 special edition. For the role of Dorothy Vallens, Lynch met Isabella Rossellini at a restaurant, and she accepted the role. Laura Dern, then just 19 years old, was cast after various successful actresses at the time turned it down, including Molly Ringwald.|$|E

500|$|Walter Afanasieff, long-time Mariah Carey collaborator, {{worked with}} Simpson on three cuts from Irresistible. One of the songs, [...] "When You Told Me You Loved Me", {{was written by}} Afanasieff in {{collaboration}} with Billy Mann. In an interview with Allpop, Simpson named the song {{as one of her}} favorites and said, [...] "I really base that on a situation of a friend of mine whose parents are divorced. I like the emotion behind that song." [...] Cory Rooney wrote [...] "Hot Like Fire" [...] solely, which Simpson described as [...] "certainly not kid stuff", a song [...] "with a lot of attitude." [...] Louis Biancaniello and Sam Watters were also brought in to write and produce songs for the album. One of the cuts, [...] "For Your Love", according to Simpson, is reminiscent of [...] "I Wanna Love You Forever" [...] (1999). Simpson covered the gospel hymn [...] "His Eye is on the Sparrow" [...] as the last song of the album. She said, [...] "I wanted to give my audience a piece of my heart and soul. The message is there's so much in life that can get you discouraged, but if <b>you</b> <b>trust</b> that you're being watched over, you have a reason to live and a sense of freedom. It's different for everyone, but for me, my relationship with God is the way I clear out the shadows that hang in our lives." ...|$|E

2500|$|Carson hosted several shows besides Carson's Cellar, {{including}} the game show Earn Your Vacation (1954) and the CBS variety show The Johnny Carson Show (1955–1956). He {{was a guest}} panelist on the original To Tell the Truth starting in 1960, later becoming a regular panelist from 1961 until 1962. After the prime time The Johnny Carson Show failed, he moved to New York City to host Who Do <b>You</b> <b>Trust?</b> (1957–1962), formerly known as Do <b>You</b> <b>Trust</b> Your Wife?. In 1958, he appeared as a guest star in an episode entitled [...] "Do <b>You</b> <b>Trust</b> Your Wife" [...] on NBC's short-lived variety show, The Polly Bergen Show. On Who Do <b>You</b> <b>Trust?,</b> Carson met his future sidekick and straight man, Ed McMahon. Although he believed moving to daytime would hurt his career, Who Do <b>You</b> <b>Trust?</b> was a success. It was the first show where he could ad lib and interview guests, and because of Carson's on-camera wit, the show became [...] "the hottest item on daytime television" [...] during his five years at ABC.|$|E
