2500|$|These traits come to {{the fore}} in Hi, Mom!s [...] "Be Black, Baby" [...] {{sequence}}. This sequence parodies cinéma vérité, the dominant documentary tradition of the 1960s, while simultaneously providing the audience with a visceral and disturbingly emotional experience. De Palma describes the sequence as a constant invocation of Brechtian distanciation: [...] "First of all, I am interested in the medium of film itself, and I am constantly standing outside and making people aware that they are always watching a film. At the same time I am evolving it. In Hi, Mom! for instance, there is a sequence where you are obviously watching a ridiculous documentary and you are told that and you are aware of it, but it still sucks <b>you</b> <b>in.</b> <b>There</b> is a kind of Brechtian alienation idea here: you are aware of what you are watching {{at the same time that}} you are emotionally involved with it." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'What are <b>you</b> doing <b>in</b> <b>there,</b> Bradshaw? Why were <b>you</b> not <b>in</b> {{school this}} afternoon? Come out at once.' This in deep and thrilling tones.|$|R

6000|$|... 'Algiers,' he said. 'I {{have never}} been there, but I {{understand}} that it is quite a place. Are <b>you</b> <b>in</b> business <b>there,</b> Mr Johnson?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nelly--I'm so sorry--I didn't {{really have}} the chance to tell <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> how sorry I was for the way I spoke to you. Gee! it was fierce of me--but I felt--I couldn't dance, and--oh--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Stop!" [...] she said, with a {{stamp of}} her slim foot. [...] "Stay where you are! We must have our talk out HERE. I'm {{not going to}} waste words with <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>there,</b> before HER." ...|$|E
6000|$|Elijah {{stared at}} him in silence for some time, then spoke: [...] "I told <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> I wouldn't pay you one penny of the money and I'll hold to what I said--in there I said it indoors, and I say again that indoors I'll never pay you--no, not one penny piece. But if I happen some day to meet you out of doors then I'll pay you. Now go." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No, sir. I {{could have}} sworn I had heard <b>you</b> moving <b>in</b> <b>there</b> not a moment ago. It's most extraordinary... very sorry, sir." ...|$|R
6000|$|DOCTOR. Wait {{till she}} sends {{for you at}} least--at least. Man alive, he'll kill you if <b>you</b> go <b>in</b> <b>there!</b> What are <b>you</b> bothering him for? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sure is a junk heap, {{this old}} block," [...] {{observed}} Pepper, as he fumbled {{in the dim}} light with his keys. At length he opened a door, turned on a light and led Lane into his apartment. [...] "I have three rooms here, and the back one opens into a kind of areaway from which I get into an abandoned storeroom, or I guess it's an attic. To-morrow afternoon about three you meet me here and I'll take <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> and let you have a look through the peep-hole I made. It's no use to-night, because there'll be only boys at the club, and I'm going to take you right in." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Get off the box, you old noodle," [...] quoth the pseudo-proconsul peremptorily. [...] "Thou and thy {{friend the}} postilion will remain {{here in the}} road, and on the morrow you'll explain to whomsoever it may concern that the English spy made a murderous attack on you both and left you half dead outside the postern gate of the {{cemetery}} of Ste. Anne. Here," [...] he added as he threw a purse down to the two men--who half-dazed and overcome by superstitious fear had indeed scrambled down, one from his box, the other from his horse--"there's a hundred francs for each of <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>there,</b> and mind you drink {{to the health of}} the English spy and the confusion of your brutish proconsul." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{would find}} it {{difficult}} to maintain yourself. I have thought of a better way than that. I am acquainted with a Phongee, who lives in a temple in a lonely spot, four miles away. He is a good man, though somewhat strange in his habits; and I feel sure that, on my recommendation, he would take <b>you</b> <b>in.</b> <b>There</b> would be little chance of your being discovered there. You could not go dressed as you are, but must disguise yourself as a peasant; though it might be well to retain your present attire, which may be useful to you, afterwards. I fear that you will fare badly with him, in the way of food; there will be enough to eat, but it will be of the simplest." ...|$|E
6000|$|Come with me, if you please. I {{shall not}} folget nothing what can to merit your attention. Here we are near to cathedral; will <b>you</b> come <b>in</b> <b>there?</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{more of us}} the better," [...] {{explained}} Joey; [...] "we {{help each}} other. Besides, I particularly want <b>you</b> <b>in</b> it. <b>There's</b> a sort of superior Pickwickian atmosphere surrounding you that disarms suspicion." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hi, Phil, you rat, {{come out}} of that!" [...] roared Captain Hannock, savagely. [...] "What {{business}} have <b>you</b> got <b>in</b> <b>there?</b> Git into the cabin and lively, or I'll warm you good!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And did you {{get that}} out of your silly Dream Book, you Greek?" [...] howled Jackson through a cough. [...] "Don't talk of heaven to me--it's a lie--I know it--and they are all fools that believe in it. Do you think, you Greek, that there's any heaven for you? Will they let <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>there,</b> with that tarry hand, and that oily head of hair? Avast! when some shark gulps you down his {{hatchway}} one of these days, you'll find, that by dying, you'll only go from one gale of wind to another; mind that, you Irish cockney! Yes, you'll be bolted down like one of your own pills: and I should like to see the whole ship swallowed down in the Norway maelstrom, like a box on 'em. That would be a dose of salts for ye!" [...] And so saying, he went off, holding his hands to his chest, and coughing, as if his last hour was come.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, {{give it a}} rest, then; t'ain't {{good for}} yer. And, look 'ere! Any time they don't treat <b>you</b> fair <b>in</b> <b>there,</b> tip us the wink, and we'll come over and do in your 'ousekeeper." ...|$|R

5000|$|Kobylt and Chiampou {{were active}} during David Westerfield's {{trial for the}} Murder of Danielle van Dam. Kobylt shouted, [...] "Hey, Westerfield, are <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>there?</b> Did you kill Danielle?". Kobylt also tossed {{broccoli}} at [...] "vegetable head" [...] jurors, who were not convicting Westerfield swiftly enough in his opinion. They also interviewed Danielle’s parents, Damon and Brenda van Dam.|$|E
5000|$|In 2007, {{referring}} to the International Biographical Centre, the American Bibliographical Institute and Marquis Who's Who, Jan Margosian, consumer information coordinator for the Oregon Department of Justice, warned consumers to be wary and called the companies [...] "pretty tacky", adding [...] "I don't know why they would put <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> if they weren't hoping {{to get you to}} buy the book.. [...] "You truly have to look at how they are marketing and what the spin is. It's something you might want to watch out for." ...|$|E
5000|$|The track, [...] "Chamber of Reflection", {{references}} a freemasonry concept, which DeMarco subsequently {{likened to}} his home studio: [...] "It's a room people go into before you're initiated into freemasonry. It's like a meditation room, and they lock <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> {{for a period of}} time. The purpose is to reflect on what you've done in your life already and move on from it. I think that's what I did in home studio right here. It was actually therapeutic. I feel a little enlightened, a little less heavy. It's tight.". The main melody is lifted from the 1975 Shigeo Sekito song [...] "ザ・ワード２".|$|E

6000|$|... "It {{might be}} as well if I pushed on for the inlet and brought George or Acton back with me," [...] he suggested. [...] "We could make {{something}} to carry <b>you</b> <b>in,</b> if <b>there</b> was too much sea for the gig." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2007, {{referring}} to the International Biographical Centre, the American Biographical Institute, {{as well as the}} far longer-lived Marquis Who's Who, Jan Margosian, consumer information coordinator for the Oregon Department of Justice, lumped all biographical reference volumes together in a [...] "warning to consumers" [...] to be wary and called all such companies [...] "pretty tacky", adding that [...] "I don't know why they would put <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> if they weren't hoping to get you to buy the book.

5000|$|Joe Boyd, the band's {{longtime}} record producer, {{returned for}} the album. Boyd was flexible with the group's creative development, and rarely interfered with their process. His {{approach to the}} ISB's output was {{to allow them to}} decide what material appeared on the final product as Boyd, who also produced other extravagant acts like Fairport Convention and Nick Drake, encouraged unique musical compositions. Williamson later praised Boyd saying, [...] "He used to just sort of get <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>there.</b> And if you said to him, 'Well I would like such and such' he would get it for you. But otherwise, just let you get on with it". Boyd, noticing the group's change and potential faults, attempted to intervene, but, in the end, continued allowing the band to develop their new concepts. Another major production member was John Wood, sound engineer at Sound Techniques. The studio initially included only basic recording equipment not yet able to showcase the band's full musical inventiveness. By their third album, the facilities held 16-tracks, allowing the group to overdub and jump tracks to generate their multi-instrumental sound.|$|E
