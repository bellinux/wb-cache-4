5|$|Most middle {{aged and}} <b>young</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> urban Maharashtra dress in western outfits such as skirts and {{trousers}} or shalwar kameez with the traditionally nauvari or nine-yard sari, disappearing from the markets {{due to a}} lack of demand. Older women wear the five-yard sari. Traditionally, Brahmin women in Maharashtra, unlike those of other castes, did not cover their head with the end of their saree. In urban areas, the five-yard sari is worn by younger women for special occasions such as marriages and religious ceremonies. Maharashtrian brides prefer the very Maharashtrian saree – the Paithani – for their wedding day.|$|E

In Tabasco, Cortés anchored his ships at Potonchán, a Chontal Maya town. The Maya prepared for battle but the Spanish horses and firearms quickly decided the outcome. The defeated Chontal Maya lords offered gold, food, clothing and a group of <b>young</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> tribute to the victors. Among these women was a young Maya noblewoman called Malintzin, who was given the Spanish name Marina. She spoke Maya and Nahuatl and became the means by which Cortés was able to communicate with the Aztecs. From Tabasco, Cortés continued to along the coast, and went on to conquer the Aztecs.|$|E

5|$|The {{dispute between}} Norreis and his monks {{dragged on for}} years. The interdict of 1207–1213 caused further delays, {{but when it was}} lifted in 1213 the case against Norreis was finally heard. A papal legate visited the abbey and found that the monks were lacking in food, clothes, and other necessities. The liturgy was not being {{performed}} according to the monastic rule because the monks lacked the proper clothing. Charity to the poor had ceased, the monastic buildings were dilapidated, and the monks were forced to beg for their needs. The legate found that the abbot was living well, wearing non-monastic clothes, and enjoying the company of <b>young</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> his dwelling, while his monks suffered. Norreis was deposed from the abbacy by the papal legate in 1213.|$|E
