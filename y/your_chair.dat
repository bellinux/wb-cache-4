2500|$|The {{large white}} Second French Empire-style mansion, hidden behind tall trees, afforded the writer a {{multitude}} of work environments, but he usually wrote at a large dining table. It also allowed him to alternately work on his writings and then on his sketches and watercolours {{for hours at a}} time, moving his armchair and paint easel from the library towards the parlor one room at a time in search of sunlight. His meditative view of sunsets at the Bevin House were incorporated in the book, where the prince visits a small planet with 43 daily sunsets, a planet where all that is needed to watch a sunset [...] "is move <b>your</b> <b>chair</b> a few steps." ...|$|E
2500|$|The seventh {{track on}} Odd Blood, [...] "Rome", {{features}} beats taken from Moroccan and Syrian dance music that Keating's wife {{had on her}} iPod, while for [...] "Strange Reunions", Yeasayer created a short song under three minutes by exploring unconventional time signatures in different parts {{in the style of}} fellow New York City band Dirty Projectors. [...] "Mondegreen" [...] follows and is an old song created by Keating using samplers plugged into a television set. Using four channels which showed programs like infomercials and soap operas, he recorded four banks of sound and structured a song by singing on top of the material. The last track, [...] "Grizelda", is, according to Tuton, [...] "a nice way to close an album. It lulls you into sitting back in <b>your</b> <b>chair,</b> puts you in a trance a bit, although the subject matter might be a bit dark." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the November 2010 FOMC meeting, Warsh was {{extremely}} {{skeptical of the}} Fed's plan to generate economic activity and jobs by trying to lower long-term interest rates. Although unemployment was close to 10%, Warsh told his colleagues that he would only vote for QE2 {{out of respect for}} Chairman Bernanke: [...] "If I were in <b>your</b> <b>chair,</b> I would not be leading the Committee in this direction, and frankly, if I were in the chair of most people around this room, I would dissent." [...] Even if unemployment were [...] "unacceptably high," [...] he suggested that he would vote against the program continuing if inflation inched up a bit: [...] "if inflation were to move up and were to be broadly consistent with the implicit inflation target [...] in different people's minds around this room, even if unemployment were unacceptably high, I think that would be time to stop this program. If inflation expectations were {{to move out of the}} range that they have been in for a long time, that would be a reason to end this program, even if unemployment were exceptionally high and GDP were well below what we think the economy is ultimately capable of." [...] The Federal Reserve has a legal dual mandate to pursue maximum employment as well as to ensure price stability.|$|E

2500|$|The Boston Globe writer Scott McLennan {{called the}} band [...] "relentless" [...] in his {{favorable}} review. He {{went on to}} explain that, [...] "New Found Glory flaunts the chemistry brewed over the 14 years that these five Floridians have been together. Guitarists Chad Gilbert and Steve Klein maneuver speedy melodies around singer Jordan Pundik's tales of love and loss, while drummer Cyrus Bolooki and bassist Ian Grushka propel the band. New Found Glory is at its best when sounding highly caffeinated, even if breakneck tempos belie a song's blue mood." [...] Vanessa Spates of daily newspaper The Lantern awarded Radiosurgery an [...] "A" [...] grade in her review. She wrote that [...] "Seven studio albums is an impressive feat for a punk rock band in a post-rock era. They keep a youthful quality in the manic guitars and the fury of drums. The entire album is infectious and invokes a lot of heartbreak anthems that everyone can relate to." [...] Roz Smith, writing for New Jersey tabloid The Aquarian Weekly, felt the album was undeniably [...] "catchy", emphasizing its [...] "choruses, upbeat guitar riffs, bass grooves and slamming drums." [...] Nicole Villeneuve of Candadian magazine Exclaim! also offered a positive review and wrote how the album was full of [...] "lively hooks and crisp songs in a taut pop-punk package." [...] Chad Grischow of IGN scored the album at 8.5 out of 10 and called it a [...] "vibrant, infinitely listenable treat." [...] He {{went on to explain}} that, [...] "Channeling the brand of freewheeling, fun-loving pop-punk the quintet burst onto the scene playing years ago, the lean, in-your-face set of tracks examining a crumbled relationship hits hard." [...] Rock Sound journalist Terry Bezer explained how there [...] "isn't a wasted minute on Radiosurgey", whilst awarding a near perfect 9 out of 10 score. He noted how the album [...] "will delight pop-punk purists and NFG faithful alike", before praising the songwriting as some of the band's most infectious to-date. Steve M, staff writer for Sputnikmusic awarded Radiosurgery a [...] "great" [...] 3.5 out of 5 score. He felt the album contained [...] "all the little quirks of their earlier material," [...] before adding, [...] "it is difficult not {{to get caught up in}} Radiosurgery for what it is: a short and sweet pop-punk album designed to get you out of <b>your</b> <b>chair</b> and moving." [...] Consequence of Sound writer Kevin Barber awarded the album three stars out of five in his review. He wrote that, [...] "On Radiosurgery, New Found Glory have found their older, faster, and stronger sound, dishing out anthemic choruses, while still holding on to their [...] "" [...] maturity." [...] Jason Heller of The A.V. Club was less receptive, awarding the album a [...] "C" [...] grade and bemoaning the bands, [...] "same bouncy/bittersweet dynamic. It's also stuck religiously to its chunky, melodic sound. But where 2009's Not Without A Fight had a hint of a bite, Radiosurgery shows all the signs of tooth decay." ...|$|E

[...] "Lean back in <b>your</b> <b>chairs,</b> you {{children}} of the city, lean down and look at your mother.

60|$|And now come, Susan; come, my children. Draw <b>your</b> <b>chairs</b> round me, all of you. There is a dimness {{over your}} figures.

500|$|The {{experience}} changed Logan's opinion of Monroe, and he later compared her to Charlie Chaplin in {{her ability to}} blend comedy and tragedy. Bus Stop became a box office success, grossing $4.25 million, and received mainly favorable reviews.
