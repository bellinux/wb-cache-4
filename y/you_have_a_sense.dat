2500|$|The author makes a {{point of}} {{grounding}} his work on a foundation of historical fiction, which he channels to evoke important social and political elements of primarily the European medieval era that differ markedly from elements of modern times, including the multigenerational, rigid, and often brutally consequential nature of the hierarchical class system of feudal societies that is in many cases overlooked in fantasy writing. Even as A Song of Ice and Fire is a fantasy series that employs magic and the surreal as central to the genre, Martin is keen to ensure that magic is merely one element of many that moves his work forward, not a generic deus ex machina that is itself the focus of his stories, which is something he has been very conscious about since reading Tolkien; [...] "If you look at The Lord of the Rings, what strikes you, it certainly struck me, is that although the world is infused with this great sense of magic, there is very little onstage magic. So <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of magic, but it's kept under very tight control, and I really took that to heart when I was starting my own series." [...] Martin's ultimate aim is an exploration of the internal conflicts that define the human condition, which, in deriving inspiration from William Faulkner, he ultimately describes as the only reason to read any literature, regardless of genre.|$|E

Just so companionable is the music of the ballads in that enchanted country of Gerard's fancy, in the land of the Valois. All the while you read, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of the briefness of the pleasure, you know that the hero cannot rest here, that the girls and their loves, the cottage and its shelter, are not for him. He is only passing by, happy yet wistful, far untravelled horizons are {{alluring}} him, the great city is drawing him to herself and will slay him one day in her den, as Scylla slew her victims.|$|E

[...] "They think of but one thing, they talk of but one thing, they dream of but one thing. Instead of getting over it, {{as time goes}} on, it takes {{possession}} of them more and more. There are men, of course, who would be unaffected by it-- who could shake it off. I warn you in particular against it, because, {{in spite of all}} that is said, I am convinced <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of humour; and that being so, it will lay hold of you.

60|$|But let me {{give you}} a solemn warning. You have a {{magnificent}} chance, dear boy, with all the advantages of wealth and station. I beseech you not to throw it away by any exhibition of talent. The field is clear and the British people are waiting for a leader. But remember that the British people like their leaders dull. Capacity they mistrust, versatility they cannot bear, and wit they utterly abhor. Look at the fate of poor Lord Parnaby. His urbanity gained him the premiership, but his brilliancy overthrew him. How could the fortunes of the nation be safe with a man whose speeches were pointed and sparkling, whose mind was so quick, so agile, that it reminded you of a fencer's play? Every one is agreed that Lord Parnaby is flippant and unsubstantial; we doubt his principles and we have grave fears about his morality. Take warning, my dear boy, take warning. Let the sprightly epigram never lighten the long periods of your speech nor the Attic salt flavour the roast beef of your conversation. Be careful that your metaphors show no imagination and conceal your brains as you would a discreditable secret. Above all, if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of humour, crush it.

50|$|As James Surowiecki {{writes in}} his article for The New Yorker, “Hanging Tough,” {{referencing}} economist Frank Knight, “Risk describes a situation where <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of the range and likelihood of possible outcomes. Uncertainty describes a situation where it’s not even clear what might happen, let alone how likely the possible outcomes are.” However, one person’s risk may be another person’s uncertainty. Perception, not necessarily reality, defines this distinction. Although there is risk in almost any endeavor, actors in high-risk situations may feel such a level of discomfort that they cross the line from risk into uncertainty.|$|E

[...] Owen continued, [...] "There are enough questions here to lure you back for a while". Jo Curtis at UnrealityTV.com found the pilot [...] "funny; it’s very funny, but probably only if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of humour that tends towards black", and described the comedy and Karvan's character transformation as [...] "a breath of fresh air." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} in theaters in its native country of Iceland in September.

5000|$|Bryant said on {{the subject}} of the comic's gay humor: [...] "The 'Older Teen' rating is {{appropriate}} for this book thanks to the language and more adult humor that plays out throughout each page however particularly as the series likes to play around with gender roles (for example, Ronnie, one of the lone females of the series, is seen and treated as a gay male due to her short hair) and will sometimes take jabs that can be taken in worse lights in the wrong hands (constant 'homo' jokes are made against Ronnie due to her open crush on Robin).

[...] Blurt Magazine writer John Moore gave the album 4 stars stating that [...] "it’s simply confounding that Bare and his band aren’t as big as groups like Arcade Fire and My Morning Jacket".

5000|$|From 28 April 1952, when he {{was called}} up to do his {{national}} service until 1954, {{he served in the}} British Army's Royal Fusiliers, first at the BAOR HQ in Iserlohn, Germany, and then on active service during the Korean War. He had gone into Korea feeling sympathetic to communism, coming as he did from a poor family, but the experience left him permanently repelled. He experienced a situation where he {{knew he was going to}} die, the memory of which stayed with him and formed his character; he later said, [...] "The rest of my life I have lived every bloody moment from the moment I wake up until the time I go to sleep."

For Mr. Logan, {{with the aid of}} expert {{craftsmen}} and a cast of principals that we do not believe an act of divine cooperation could have greatly improved upon, has given the charming Marseilles folk play a stunning pictorial sweep, a deliciously atmospheric flavor and a flesh-touching intimacy. And, embraced by these graphic, sensuous virtues are the rich human, comic elements that flowed out of Pagnol's little pictures and glimmered upon the Broadway stage [...] [...] [...] To be sure, there are flaws in the compound. The cutting is often too abrupt, some scenes are confused by intercutting, and the tempo in the early phases is much too fast. Also, occasionally the actors are costumed too prettily, and the domestic magnificence of the Panisses in the last part is tasteless and absurd [...] [...] [...] But on the whole, the appropriate atmosphere of Marseilles is literally and colorfully conveyed — in excellent color, by the way. Perhaps there will be some prim objection to the lush emotionalism of it all and to the frankness of the musical nudging, but we loved it." ...|$|E

40|$|Global warming has put green {{economics}} in an uncomfortable position. Should we support nuclear energy, long considered an anathema, {{as a temporary}} expedient? Or should we resist nuclear energy's seductive appeal as a palliative for global warming? Is green economics {{forced to choose between}} {{the lesser of two evils}} – global warming and nuclear energy? Or is there a more palatable alternative consistent with our moral beliefs, our stated principles and concern for humanity? The objective of this paper is to develop a green economics position on nuclear energy. This is essential given the renewed interest in nuclear energy in the USA and Europe as part of a judicious mix to improve energy security and attenuate global warming. Schumacher (1989) wrote a generation ago, "When a thing is intelligible <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of participation; when a thing is unintelligible, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of estrangement" (p. 89). The goal of this paper is to make nuclear energy 'intelligible' in order to formulate a green position on nuclear energy. Section one of this paper will briefly discuss the urgency of global warming and section two, the fundamentals of nuclear energy. The third and fourth sections discuss the pros and cons of nuclear energy respectively; and the final section develops a position on nuclear energy consistent with the principles of green economics. green economics; nuclear energy; nuclear power; energy security; sustainability; sustainable development; global warming. ...|$|E
