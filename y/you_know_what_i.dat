In the parody film Shriek If <b>You</b> <b>Know</b> <b>What</b> <b>I</b> Did Last Friday the Thirteenth (2000), a killer wearing a Jason Voorhees-style hockey mask is set on fire, his mask melting to resemble that of Ghostface. The film Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (2001) features Ghostface, as Shannen Doherty and Craven provide cameos as themselves making the then non-existent Scream 4, but Doherty objects when Ghostface {{turns out to be}} played by the orangutan, Suzann.|$|E

Then they're like, 'We want to hear a hip-hop record.' 'Why is she dressing like this? She should show less skin.' 'She should show more.' <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> mean?

500|$|Liam Cunningham, who portrays Davos Seaworth, {{spoke about}} {{the writing of the}} episode {{following}} its airing, and revealed how he reacted to the scene, saying [...] "It was initially shocking. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> thought was my favorite bit, and I said it to David and Dan, it was at that moment when the reveal comes and you kind of go, 'Oh my God,' it puts things into context with Melisandre. It doesn't explain or blah, blah, blah. … It's confirmed like, she's a witch, but there was such a touch of humanity.

Parker was quoted: [...] "But it's really like a publicist couldn't have orchestrated this any better for us. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> mean? It's like it's been phenomenal.

500|$|Although Milian was a {{songwriter}} since her teenagers years, she only felt real growth during the production sessions when Dre told her, [...] "there are no rules". Previously, Milian would write songs that followed rules, {{where she would}} have a hook, a verse, and another verse with similar sound and melody. For So Amazin, she wrote with a [...] "no rules theory", which was her biggest obstacle while recording the album. She said, [...] "It was just, <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what?</b> <b>I</b> can change up the melody I can do different things. Sometimes I might get stuck but wait half an hour and it'll come to you and end up being hot. So that's probably my biggest obstacle, just stepping away from doing the usual that I know and stepping into something new. Once I got past all that, it was just easy. With flying colors, I started writing all the records." ...|$|E

500|$|Originally, [...] "Castle Walls" [...] {{belonged to}} Diddy, who had {{commissioned}} the song for his fifth album Last Train to Paris with his group Dirty Money. But Diddy told T.I., [...] "Yeah, {{this is my}} record, but <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what,</b> <b>I</b> {{think this is a}} better fit for you. I think you should rock out on this one. I think this speaks volumes to where you are, what you going through, what you living and how you feel." [...] Consequently, Christina Aguilera was chosen as the featured guest on the song, which appeared on T.I.'s album No Mercy. Alex da Kid, producer of the song, said about the collaboration, [...] "I love it. I think it's amazing. It's my sound, just kind of an evolution of that. I think it'll cater to a lot of different people." [...] T.I. told RapFix Live about the track's inspiration: ...|$|E
500|$|The {{performance}} of the I'm Breathless songs began with [...] "Sooner or Later" [...] sung atop a grand piano, followed by [...] "Hanky Panky", where Madonna {{stood in front of}} a microphone and sang it.

500|$|Tired {{of being}} the only boy in his class to have never kissed a girl, Butters {{purchases}} his first kiss from Sally, who sells kisses for $5. Having won the respect of his classmates, he devises a plan to advertise Sally's services to other unpopular boys at the school. Sally gives Butters a 40 percent cut for his advertising and managing services, and Butters soon turns the venture into a full-fledged [...] "kissing company" [...] by recruiting more girls to fill in during times in which Sally is busy. Upon learning about Butters' business, Kyle tells him that he is [...] "nothing but a common pimp". Oblivious to what the word means, Butters attends a pimp convention where he seeks advice from more-experienced pimps, including one called Keyshawn. Afterward, he starts to mimic the pimp jargon, such as referring to Sally as his [...] "bottom bitch", and incorporating [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> am saying?" [...] into his conversations.|$|E

500|$|Prior to the album's release, Cooder {{played a}} union hall in San Francisco for a longshoremen's union, which {{according}} to him, [...] "got every turn of phrase. They'd never heard of me before or any of my records, but they understood all of these lyric things immediately. Because they've been educated in the union, <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> mean? Because they lived it." [...] On October 14, Cooder performed at This Land Is Your Land, a concert at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. in tribute to Woody Guthrie. Cooder did not tour in promotion of Election Special, as the Kennedy Center was his last show. In an interview for The Strand at the time, he expressed disinterest in playing larger concert venues for the album, finding them more suitable for [...] "fame" [...] purposes rather than spreading a political message. Cooder remarked on the album's potential with listeners in general in an interview for Uncut, saying that: ...|$|E
500|$|... "Hanky Panky" [...] {{was first}} {{performed}} on Madonna's third concert tour, the Blond Ambition World Tour of 1990. She performed the song {{dressed in a}} green and white striped vaudeville-style corset, playing {{the part of a}} nightclub singer, {{standing in front of a}} microphone. Near the end of the performance, Madonna joked: [...] "You all know the pleasures of a good spanking, don't you? [...] When I hurt people, I feel better, <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> mean?". Regarding the [...] "shameless promotion" [...] of Dick Tracy in this segment, author Lucy O'Brien said that [...] "along with her yen for artistic expression, Madonna has always had an eye on the bottom dollar... the Dick Tracy section is the least dynamic part of the show". Two different performances [...] were released on video, the first was included in Blond Ambition Japan Tour 90, taped from the performance at Yokohama Stadium in Yokohama, Japan, on April 27, 1990, and the other once included on Blond Ambition World Tour Live, taped at the Stade de l'Ouest in Nice, France, on August 5, 1990.|$|E
500|$|Rehearsals {{began in}} January 1945; either Rodgers or Hammerstein was always present. Raitt was {{presented}} with the lyrics for [...] "Soliloquy" [...] on a five-foot long sheet of paper—the piece ran nearly eight minutes. [...] Staging such a long solo number presented problems, and Raitt later stated that he {{felt that they were}} never fully addressed. [...] At some point during rehearsals, Molnár came to see what they had done to his play. [...] There are a number of variations on the story. [...] As Rodgers told it, while watching rehearsals with Hammerstein, the composer spotted Molnár {{in the rear of the}} theatre and whispered the news to his partner. [...] Both sweated through an afternoon of rehearsal in which nothing seemed to go right. [...] At the end, the two walked to the back of the theatre, expecting an angry reaction from Molnár. [...] Instead, the playwright said enthusiastically, [...] "What you have done is so beautiful. [...] And <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> like best? [...] The ending!" [...] Hammerstein wrote that Molnár became a regular attendee at rehearsals after that.|$|E
