6000|$|Grez--for {{that is our}} destination--has {{been highly}} {{recommended}} for its beauty. [...] "Il y a de l'eau," [...] people have said, with an emphasis, as if that settled the question, which, for a French mind, I am rather led to think it does. And Grez, when we get there, is indeed a place worthy of some praise. It lies out of the forest, a cluster of houses, with an old bridge, an old castle in ruin, and a quaint old church. The inn garden descends in terraces to the river; stableyard, kailyard, orchard, and a space of lawn, fringed with rushes and embellished with a green arbour. On the opposite bank there is a reach of English-looking plain, set thickly with willows and poplars. And between the two lies the river, clear and deep, and full of reeds and floating lilies. Water-plants cluster about the starlings of the long low bridge, and stand half-way up upon the piers in green luxuriance. They catch the dipped oar with long antennæ, and chequer the slimy bottom with the shadow of their leaves. And the river wanders hither and thither among the islets, and is smothered and broken up by the reeds, like an old building in the lithe, hardy arms of the climbing ivy. You may watch the box where the good man of the inn keeps fish alive for his kitchen, one oily ripple following another {{over the top of}} the <b>yellow</b> <b>deal.</b> And you can hear a splashing and a prattle of voices from the shed under the old kirk, where the village women wash and wash all day among the fish and water-lilies. It seems as if linen washed there should be specially cool and sweet.|$|E

5000|$|Lighting {{was handled}} by Kino Flo Celebs. The visual effects company was Image Engine, located in Vancouver. The {{name of the}} weapons company in Chappie - [...] "Tetravaal" [...] - is a {{reference}} to Blomkamp's 2003 short film of the same name, which centers on a police robot in Johannesburg with a similar design to Chappie. Blomkamp has said that Chappie is [...] "basically based" [...] on Tetra Vaal. [...] Blomkamp also employed a robot with a similar design in his 2005 short Tempbot, and both Tempbot and his 2006 short/advertisement <b>Yellow</b> <b>deal</b> with a thinking and learning robot which tries to assimilate into society.|$|E

I {{used to wear}} <b>yellow</b> a good <b>deal</b> in {{my early}} days, and would do so now if Sir John was not so painfully {{personal}} in his observations, and {{a man on the}} question of dress is always ridiculous, is he not? ...|$|R
5|$|For {{the first}} time in U.S. history, SCATANA was invoked, thus {{stranding}} tens of thousands of passengers across the world. The FAA closed American airspace to all international flights, causing about five hundred flights to be turned back or redirected to other countries. Canada received 226 of the diverted flights and launched Operation <b>Yellow</b> Ribbon to <b>deal</b> with the large numbers of grounded planes and stranded passengers.|$|R
50|$|The {{idea for}} AppyParking came from Dan Hubert, a former {{advertising}} creative. In 2012, after having trouble parking when {{going to a}} gig at The Royal Albert Hall, he asked a traffic warden about the rules for the single yellow lines. Having heard that the rules for this area were to be found a few roads away from the area he was enquiring about, Dan saw an opportunity. While still working full-time, Hubert started to contact every London borough and digitize their Controlled Parking Zones from basic PDF maps. Originally named <b>Yellow</b> Line Parking, <b>dealing</b> only with single yellow line parking restrictions, the company was expanded and rebranded as AppyParking in 2014.|$|R
40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{the use of}} code switching as a communication strategy in the film Yellow Card. The film <b>Yellow</b> Card <b>deals</b> with HIV and AIDS concerns and inevitable discusses issues pertaining to sex and sexuality, which are unspeakable in the public domain. This research reveals that code-switching is employed {{for the purposes of}} linguistic avoidance, whenever there is need to avoid a direct reference to the words and phrases considered taboo. It also occurs for intra-group identity where it functions as a communication technique for aligning or alienating interlocutors depending on the situations. Code switching is also employed to express concepts that can only be identified through a specific language and to create humour in different speech situations. Also revealed is the fact that code-switching is intra-language, occurring within the same language (formal and informal English), and inter-language, occurring between two languages (Shona and English). Critical Discourse Analysis (Fairclough, 1995) was used as both a theoretical guide and a methodological thrust. CDA views language as socially constituted and socially constituting. Data was gathered using in-depth textual analysis of the language content of the film Yellow Card and wa...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{information on}} {{all aspects of}} the biology of Cyperus esculentus L. (<b>yellow</b> nutsedge) and <b>deals</b> with its taxonomy, morphology, genetic diversity, distribution, habitat requirements, ecology and life cycle, with special emphasis on uses and cultivation, history of introduction, impact and management in Europe. C. esculentus is a tuber geophyte and most likely originates from the Mediterranean and Southwest Asia. It is a variable plant and four wild-type varieties are presently recognized, in addition to a cultivated form. C. esculentus reproduces primarily by its underground tubers, although abundant seeds are produced. In temperate climates, tubers usually sprout in late spring and the plant withers {{at the beginning of the}} winter. C. esculentus is only cultivated in the València region in Spain. Invasion foci emerged across Europe at the beginning of the 1980 s and at present, C. esculentus is most abundant on arable land and in ruderal habitats, followed by riverine vegetation. In heavily infested regions of Europe, C. esculentus causes substantial yield losses in field crops and although different management strategies are available, C. esculentus remains difficult to control...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: 2 ̆ 2 To {{build an}} {{autonomous}} vehicle capable of road following, {{it is necessary}} to compute the position and the orientation of the vehicle relative to the road. One way of doing so is to acquire images from a camera on the vehicle and extract some road features from these images. Knowing the geometric transformation between the camera and the ground plane, it is easy to compute the position and the orientation of the vehicle relative to these road features. In our case, we are building a system to track 2 ̆ 7 structured roads 2 ̆ 7, roads that have lane markings, shoulders, and other structure. For these roads, the easiest visual features to track are white lines and the <b>yellow</b> lines. To <b>deal</b> with a variety of roads, light, and weather conditions, we need to build robust extractors of these features. In the case of the white stripe, we use our knowledge about its shape to extract it. We create a mask with a shape similar to the current white stripe and convolve a search area in the image with it. The maximum correlation gives us the location of the stripe. To reduce the signal/noise ratio, and to be robust in the cases of light and weather variations, we use a large mask. By taking into account the current running total during the convolution phases, we reduce the computational time drastically and so get a fast operator to track the white stripe. In the case of the yellow stripes, the color is a strong characteristic of this kind of stripe, and the hue is only slightly affected by lighting and weather variations (we can get in the image a dark or a light yellow, but it is always a yellow color). We build the yellow stripe tracker based on the hue information. 2 ̆...|$|R
