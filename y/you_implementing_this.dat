40|$|Like {{any other}} {{technologies}} or techniques, implementing Six Sigma (SS) in an organisation requires a comprehensive understanding on surrounding {{issues on the}} implementation process. Many have been written on this topic which strongly suggests that “It is not what <b>you</b> <b>implement,</b> but how <b>you</b> <b>implement</b> it”. In <b>this</b> paper, a reflection on organisational issues relating {{to the implementation of}} Total Quality Management (TQM) is discussed, especially several underlying factors which managers or other members of organisations who implement it often overlook. Although SS proponents of have attempted hard to articulate the differences between SS and TQM, it is difficult to deny that there is a large degree of similarities between the two. Consequently, we still can draw several key lessons and apply them to SS which will prevent us from facing similar obstacles we had in the past with TQM...|$|R

40|$|The University of Iowa Libraries {{implemented}} a free document delivery service on July 1, 2007. We combined four separate document delivery services into one free service {{and used the}} ILLiad software to process and track all of these requests. All University of Iowa faculty, staff, and students can now request any material held locally through this service and will be provided a scanned PDF copy that is posted on the web via ILLiad. Since the University of Iowa Libraries consists of the Main Library, Hardin Library for the Health Sciences, and nine branch libraries, the coordination of staff and resources for this project was daunting. Not only did ILLiad have to be installed at each library, to replace the Ariel software for posting scanned documents on the web, but all the full-time staff and student workers needed to be trained on a brand new software and workflow. Since July 1 st, several incidents have happened that have required {{an evaluation of the}} policies for this service and of course the statistics have skyrocketed in the few months the service has been available without charge. While the service will be continued, there are definitely some lessons learned that will make this session invaluable if <b>you</b> are considering <b>implementing</b> <b>this</b> at your own library...|$|R

Make {{a report on the}} workshop Course material Paper of Korngold and Gabriele [1] and book chapter of Balling [2], Slides [3], exercises [4] on Response Surface Model building and Design of Experiments. Assignment IV The fourth assignment concludes the MDO workshop. 1. Study the MDO approach {{described in the}} paper of Korngold and Gabriele [1]. Compare the approach of the paper with the approach that has been followed during the workshop. Explain the role of the Global Sensitivity Equations (GSE) in the approach of Korngold and Gabriele [1], and discuss how <b>you</b> would <b>implement</b> <b>this</b> in your system optimization of the semiconductor case (we do not ask you to actually carry out the implementation). For additional reading on the GSE see e. g. Balling [2]. 2. Make a report on the assignments of the workshop, including a short introduction and appendices. The appendices may contain a selection of Matlab les, tables and plots of results on RSM model building and optimization, and any other relevant work done for the workshop in addition to the assignments. An evaluation of the workshop and suggestions for improvements as part of the conclusions are welcome. For the report please note the following conditions: 1 The report is a main determinant for your nal grade. However, individual teams may be invited for an oral defence, The deadline for submission will be announced; Please hand in two copies of the report at the ofce of L. F. P.
