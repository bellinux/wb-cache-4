5|$|I {{remember}} {{most of the}} video you had shot with the crane, some Steadicam, plus some panning. So you have about five different cameras shooting a performance, and after they edit like crazy. It gives {{you a lot of}} freedom, but I feel very frustrated because I like to see somebody dancing. I hate when there's too much editing. I like the steadiness of the performance because then you can really enjoy the movement of the body. <b>You</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> skill.|$|E
5|$|Both yes–no {{questions}} and wh-questions in English are mostly formed using subject–auxiliary inversion (Am I going tomorrow?, Where can we eat?), which may require do-support (Do you like her?, Where did he go?). In most cases, interrogative words (wh-words; e.g. what, who, where, when, why, how) {{appear in a}} fronted position. For example, in the question What did <b>you</b> <b>see?,</b> <b>the</b> word what appears as the first constituent despite being the grammatical object of the sentence. (When the wh-word is the subject or forms part of the subject, no inversion occurs: Who saw the cat?.) Prepositional phrases can also be fronted when they are the question's theme, e.g. To whose house did you go last night?. The personal interrogative pronoun who is the only interrogative pronoun to still show inflection for case, with the variant whom serving as the objective case form, although this form may be going out of use in many contexts.|$|E

500|$|As {{winners of}} the FA Cup in the {{previous}} season, Arsenal contested the 2005 FA Community Shield against league champions Chelsea.

500|$|Not all reviews were as positive. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} episode a [...] "B–" [...] {{and called it}} [...] "alternately deeply moving and really, really stupid".

I'm sitting on a phone booth or lying on a car, to hint that I'm dead, that I'm singing from the dead. It's all about separation. It's almost like the director {{knew what was going to}} happen, but he can't have known. It's just one of those fate things." ...|$|E
