40|$|Individuals with hearing {{impairment}} {{are confronted with}} a lot of problems due to the condition of their disability. This has a negative impact on their social and psychological well-being with multiplying effect on their interpersonal relationship. Therefore, this study investigated the psycho-social influence of {{hearing impairment}} on interpersonal behavior of <b>youths</b> <b>with</b> hearing loss. MethodologyThe study adopted a survey research design. A sample consisting of 211 participants with hearing loss were purposively selected from the Federal College of Education (Special) Oyo, Nigeria. A questionnaire, part of Psycho-social Competence Scale (PCS), was used for data collection with reliability coefficient of 0. 72. ResultsThe findings revealed that hearing impairement affects social interaction of <b>youths</b> <b>with</b> hearing impairment, hearing loss affects emotional well-being of <b>youths</b> <b>with</b> hearing impairment and <b>youths</b> <b>with</b> hearing impairment feel inferior in company of persons without hearing impairment. Based on this, it was recommended that a friendly home environment should be made and <b>youths</b> <b>with</b> hearing impairment should be advised to accept their loss and take it as a challenge {{that can be used to}} achieve a better end and the society should have right attitude and beliefs toward <b>youths</b> <b>with</b> hearing impairment...|$|R

Neuroimaging scans from 44 <b>youths</b> <b>with</b> DSM-IV BPD and 22 healthy controls (HC) were analyzed using cross-sectional area measurements and a novel method of volumetric parcellation. Univariate analyses of variance were conducted on CC subregions using both volume and traditional area measurements. <b>Youths</b> <b>with</b> BPD had smaller middle and posterior callosal regions, and reduced typical age-related increases in CC size.

40|$|The {{literature}} has suggested timing processing {{as a potential}} endophenotype for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); however, whether the subjective internal clock speed presented by verbal estimation and limited attention capacity presented by time reproduction could be endophenotypes for ADHD is still unknown. We assessed 223 <b>youths</b> <b>with</b> DSM-IV ADHD (age range: 10 - 17 years), 105 unaffected siblings, and 84 typically developing (TD) youths using psychiatric interviews, intelligence tests, verbal estimation and time reproduction tasks (single task and simple and difficult dual tasks) at 5 -second, 12 -second, and 17 -second intervals. We found that <b>youths</b> <b>with</b> ADHD tended to overestimate time in verbal estimation more than their unaffected siblings and TD youths, implying that fast subjective internal clock speed might be a characteristic of ADHD, rather than an endophenotype for ADHD. <b>Youths</b> <b>with</b> ADHD and their unaffected siblings were less precise in time reproduction dual tasks than TD youths. The magnitude of estimated errors in time reproduction was greater in <b>youths</b> <b>with</b> ADHD and their unaffected siblings than in TD <b>youths,</b> <b>with</b> an increased time interval at the 17 -second interval and with increased task demands on both simple and difficult dual tasks versus the single task. Increased impaired time reproduction in dual tasks with increased intervals and task demands were shown in <b>youths</b> <b>with</b> ADHD and their unaffected siblings, suggesting that time reproduction deficits explained by limited attention capacity might be a useful endophenotype of ADHD...|$|R
40|$|Objective To review {{studies of}} {{psychological}} adjustment among {{children and adolescents}} with chronic arthritis {{to determine whether they}} are at more risk for development of adjust-ment problems than controls. Methods We used meta-analytic techniques to review 21 studies reporting overall adjustment problems, internalizing symptoms, externalizing symp-toms, or self-concept among <b>youths</b> <b>with</b> arthritis. Results <b>Youths</b> <b>with</b> arthritis displayed increased risk for overall adjustment problems and internalizing symptoms, but not for exter-nalizing symptoms or poor self-concept. Risk was greater in studies making comparisons to study controls rather than to norms and in studies including mixed disease samples (arthritis plus other rheumatic diseases) rather than samples of <b>youths</b> <b>with</b> arthritis only. Conclu-sions Results suggest the importance of assessing for internalizing problems among <b>youths</b> <b>with</b> chronic arthritis. Future research may benefit from inclusion of child self-report of adjust-ment problems, diagnostic specificity in reporting results, and use of adjustment measures without somatic items.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} how teachers in schools for <b>youths</b> <b>with</b> intellectual disabilities view their pupils’ abilities to access sex education. The study is based on individual interviews with five teachers in years 6 - 9. The theoretical framework has been set by Michel Foucault’s theories on normality and power and “the ignored curriculum” as described by Nathalie A. Gougeon. It is also supported by additional theories on normality and sexuality. The results of the study show that, these pupils have a harder time finding information about sex and relationships, because of the stigma surrounding people with intellectual disabilities in relation to sexuality, and because of the lack of information about sex outside the classroom for <b>youths</b> <b>with</b> intellectual disabilities. <b>Youths</b> <b>with</b> no intellectual disabilities learn about sex also outside of classrooms to a large extent, which is more difficult for <b>youths</b> <b>with</b> intellectual disabilities. The role of the teacher as provider of sex education is therefore crucial...|$|R

5|$|Punk {{was a form}} of rebellious {{rock that}} began in the 1970s, and was loud, aggressive, and often very simple. Punk began as a {{reaction}} against the popular music of the period, especially disco and arena rock. American bands in the field included, most famously, The Ramones and Talking Heads, the latter playing a more avant-garde style that was closely associated with punk before evolving into mainstream new wave. Other major acts include Blondie, Patti Smith, and Television. In the 1980s some punk fans and bands became disillusioned with the growing popularity of the style, resulting in an even more aggressive style called hardcore punk. Hardcore {{was a form of}} sparse punk, consisting of short, fast, intense songs that spoke to disaffected <b>youth,</b> <b>with</b> such influential bands as Bad Religion, Bad Brains, Black Flag, Dead Kennedys, and Minor Threat. Hardcore began in metropolises like Washington, D.C., though most major American cities had their own local scenes in the 1980s.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To clarify {{whether the}} {{symptoms}} of inattention and distractibility commonly seen {{in children and adolescents}} with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) represent true comorbidity with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or a manifestation of obsessional anxiety. METHOD: Phenotypic features and functional correlates of ADHD-like symptoms were examined in <b>youths</b> <b>with</b> and without OCD from a large sample of pediatric psychiatry patients consecutively referred since 1997. RESULTS: The number, frequency, and types of core ADHD symptoms as well as ADHD-associated functional indices were identical in all <b>youths</b> <b>with</b> DSM-IV-diagnosed ADHD irrespective of {{the presence or absence of}} comorbid OCD. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that when ADHD-like symptoms are seen in <b>youths</b> <b>with</b> OCD, they reflect a true comorbid state of OCD plus ADHD and that the ADHD syndrome may be independent of OCD in comorbid youths...|$|R

There are trends toward polypharmacy {{and the increased}} use of newer mood stabilizers in <b>youths</b> <b>with</b> psychiatric illness despite a paucity of studies examining the short- and long-term efficacy and safety of these agents in the pediatric population. METHOD: PubMed was used to identify peer-reviewed publications from the past 30 years (January 1975 to August 2005) studying lithium and anticonvulsants in <b>youths</b> <b>with</b> psychiatric illness. RESULTS: Evidence supporting the use of lithium and valproate in the treatment of juvenile bipolar disorder and reactive aggression has grown. Evidence for the use of other anticonvulsants in <b>youths</b> <b>with</b> psychiatric illness is sparse. Side effects from lithium and anticonvulsants are typically mild to moderate. Data are accumulating in regard to the longer-term safety of lithium and DVPX in the juvenile psychiatric population. Although data in regard to the newer anticonvulsants are limited, they may have more desirable side-effect profiles. CONCLUSION: Double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of lithium and anticonvulsants are greatly needed as clinical use of these agents has risen without sufficient evidence supporting their efficacy in the pediatric population...|$|R
