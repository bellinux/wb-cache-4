Asked how she felt about Terri being a 'love to hate' character, Gilsig replied: [...] "As long as <b>you</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> hate her, that's OK. It would be a different show if there weren't characters like Terri or Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch), otherwise you'd be at Disneyland. It would be the happiest place on Earth." [...] Gilsig {{does not know how}} long her character will feature in the series, and has explained [...] "When Terri was created, she was created obviously to be an obstacle between Emma and Will. They needed an obstacle, otherwise there's no show. What's been fun about it is that she's managed to emerge as a character unto herself with her own complexities." ...|$|E

Musker and Clements stated that while Tiana already starts as a sympathetic character, the events of the plot make her [...] "understand things in a deeper level" [...] and change people around her.
