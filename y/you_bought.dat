500|$|The game's sidequests include minor {{tasks and}} quests, {{optional}} bosses and dungeons, {{and the most}} minigames of any Final Fantasy {{at the time of}} its release. These minigames include Gunner's Gauntlet (a third-person/first-person shooter game) and Sphere Break (a mathematical coin game involving addition and multiplication), as well as the fictional underwater sport blitzball originally featured in Final Fantasy X with a different control scheme.

[...] Kellman selected [...] "Amor Gitano", [...] "Irreemplazable" [...] and the [...] "Get Me Bodied" [...] remix as the highlights of the EP. The EP led to Beyoncé receiving a nomination for Pop New Artist of the Year at the 2008 Lo Nuestro Awards, and [...] "Bello Embustero" [...] was nominated for Record of the Year at the 8th Annual Latin Grammy Awards.|$|E

500|$|Game Informers Andrew Reiner {{cited the}} example of coin {{redistribution}} in the game, which meant that [...] "You could win every minigame and collect the most coins but still end up in last place", when giving a second opinion of the game. While acknowledging issues relating to the waiting times during board games, IGN's Peer Schneider praised this installment for relieving the problem slightly, specifically referring to the Mini Bowsers, who all take their turns {{at the same time}} in [...] "Story" [...] mode. The quantity and accessibility of the minigames was lauded by GameSpot, although the reviewer Ryan Davis proceeded to note [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>bought</b> Mario Party 4 last year, Mario Party 5 is hard to recommend.", noting a lack of change to the series formula. Generally, critics cited having a fun experience in Mario Party 5, although the minigames received a more enthusiastic reaction than the actual board game, with GameSpy commenting that [...] "the sheer volume can keep you compelled. If only you didn't have to deal with all that BS in-between" [...] when referring to gameplay of the actual board game.|$|E
500|$|Bill Lamb from About.com commented: [...] " [...] {{album is}} {{state of the}} art dance-pop loaded with hits from 'Holiday' and 'Lucky Star' to 'Borderline'. Irresistible pop hooks glide across shimmering synth beats to make this a {{landmark}} album of the early 80's." [...] Jonathan Ross from Q said that [...] "'Borderline' is sweet and 'Holiday' still fizzes with invention and joie de vivre....this quintessentially '80s dance hit also features a barrelhouse piano solo." [...] Robert Christgau wrote in The Village Voice, [...] "In case <b>you</b> <b>bought</b> the con, disco never died — just reverted to the crazies who thought it was worth living for. This shamelessly ersatz blonde is one of them, and with the craftily orchestrated help of a fine selection of producers, remixers, and DJs, she's come up with a shamelessly ersatz sound that's tighter than her tummy — essence of electro, the D in DOR." [...] Don Shewey from Rolling Stone was of the opinion that [...] "without overstepping the modest ambitions of minimal funk, Madonna issues an irresistible invitation to the dance." [...] Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine rated the album four and a half out of five stars and commented: [...] "Heralding the synth-heavy movement was a debut album [...] that sounds just as fresh today as it did almost two decades ago." [...] In March 2012, the publication placed the album at number 33 on their [...] "Best Albums of the 1980s" [...] list. Michaelangelo Matos from Spin selected the album among [...] "The Definitive Guide to Classic Disco" [...] and noted that it [...] "mashed-up street sounds and reinvigorated disco for a generation that {{wanted nothing to do with}} polyester suits, ending an era and birthing a new one." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} Dragon Quest game {{is often}} cited as the first console RPG. GameSpot called the original Dragon Quest one of the fifteen most influential games of all time and the [...] "most influential role-playing games of all time", stating that nearly all Japanese RPGs since then have drawn from its gameplay [...] "in some shape or form." [...] Next Generation said it was [...] "probably the first ever 'Japanese style' RPG", and listed the series collectively as number 56 on their [...] "Top 100 Games of All Time". They commented, [...] "While never as ambitious as Square's Final Fantasy series, later installments of Dragon Warrior can't be beaten for sheer size (if you only had enough cash to buy you one game that had to last you a month, <b>you</b> <b>bought</b> a Dragon Warrior title)." [...] In response to a survey, Gamasutra cites Quinton Klabon of Dartmouth College as stating Dragon Warrior translated the D experience to video games and set the genre standards. Games such as Mother, Breath of Fire and Lufia & the Fortress of Doom were inspired by various Dragon Quest titles. Dragon QuestIIIs class-changing system would shape other RPGs, especially the Final Fantasy series. Dragon Quest IVs [...] "Tactics" [...] system, where the player can set the AI routines for NPCs, {{is seen as a}} precursor to Final Fantasy XIIs [...] "Gambits" [...] system. Dragon Quest V is cited as having monster recruiting and training mechanics that inspired monster-collecting RPGs such as Pokémon, Digimon, and Dokapon, and in turn the modern trend of collecting achievements. Dragon Quest V also introduced the concept of a playable pregnancy. The real world and dream world setting of Dragon Quest VI is considered an influence on the later Square RPGs Chrono Cross and Final FantasyX. The Dragon Quest series was recognized by Guinness World Records, with six world records in the Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition. These records include [...] "Best Selling Role Playing Game on the Super Famicom", [...] "Fastest Selling Game in Japan", and [...] "First Video Game Series to Inspire a Ballet".|$|E

2500|$|The album's {{release was}} preceded by two double A-sided singles. The first, [...] "King"/"Food For Thought", was {{released}} as UB40's debut single in February 1980.

Upon the single's release [...] "Food for Thought" [...] gained more radio airplay than [...] "King" [...] – speaking about the single in 2010, Bob Lamb said, [...] "'Food for Thought' was actually the B-side of 'King' originally: although it was a double A-side 'King' was always going to be the main song, but the DJs picked up on 'Food for Thought' because it was quicker and chirpier, more dancey, more of a radio track. So they played that a lot, and really that became the hit, 'Food for Thought', but whenever <b>you</b> <b>bought</b> the record it always said 'King'/'Food for Thought' – 'King' was always, like, the first name on the record, which I thought was pretty cool." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Dillinger Escape Plan {{announced}} their departure from Relapse Records in 2009. The band had become {{dissatisfied with the}} music industry and music media, and decided {{to create their own}} record label to release their fourth studio album. Commenting on the dissolving [...] "indie band culture", Weinman stated, [...] "back in the day there were record labels that you trusted, loved and <b>you</b> <b>bought</b> everything on it and you discovered a lot of great new music because of it. You listen to every single song back to front a million times, it'd be worn out to death before you moved onto another record. You'd read everything in the booklet, you'd read all the lyrics, you'd read all the notes, you'd discover something new." [...] Speaking to Kerrang! about the decision, he said: [...] "The most important thing was to keep evolving and changing. We didn't want to be stuck in some long contract that won't be relevant in a few years time... Or possibly even tomorrow. So half out of necessity, half out of choice, we decided to do this ourselves. The hard part is figuring out whether you're sacrificing your creative side because you're so busy with the business. That's the challenge and we're figuring it out".|$|E
