5|$|If {{you talk}} to people who perform a Burrakatha, <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> huge {{difference}} in the way the older generation performs the art vis-à-vis the way the way the younger generation performs it... This has happened because of the advent of television. Burrakatha is a long-format art form. The point we are making is that if we don't protect these folk arts, they will be on their way out.|$|E

"Here <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> <b>an</b> {{ambassador}} with a diva {{from the}} opera, exchanging the latest gossip from the chancelleries for intimate {{news of the}} world behind the scenes.

Go into Cincinnati or any city, and find an educated negro, who rides in his carriage, and <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> man who has risen by the powers of his own mind to his exalted state of respectability. The slaves in Washington are more refined than many in high places, and the black boys will take the shine off many of those they brush and wait on.|$|E

"Observe {{what happens}} when sunbeams are {{admitted}} into a building and shed light on its shadowy places. <b>You</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> multitude of tiny particles mingling in a multitude of ways... their dancing is an actual indication of underlying movements of matter that are hidden from our sight... It originates with the atoms which move of themselves [...] Then those small compound bodies that are least removed from the impetus of the atoms are {{set in motion by}} the impact of their invisible blows and in turn cannon against slightly larger bodies. So the movement mounts up from the atoms and gradually emerges to the level of our senses, so that those bodies are in motion that we see in sunbeams, moved by blows that remain invisible." ...|$|E

But although Toegye turned down Jeonggu's recommendation, Jeonggu and his fellow students hastily attached wooden planks to the floor while Toegye was out. Consequently, {{this part of the}} floor is not very elegant in construction and appearance (see Gallery photo below).|$|R
