25|$|While using a gas stove, it is {{advised to}} also use {{ventilation}}. Studies {{show that in}} homes with gas stoves, if ventilation is used while using gas stoves, then children have lower odds of asthma, wheezing and bronchitis as compared to children in homes that never used ventilation. If venting isn’t possible, then replacing gas stoves with electric stove could be another option. Replacing gas stoves with electric ranges could greatly reduce the exposure to indoor NO2 and improve the respiratory function of children with asthma. It {{is important to keep}} gas stoves and heaters in good repair so they are not polluting extra NO2. 2015 International Residential Code that requires that vent hoods are used for all stoves and set standards for residential buildings. This requires that all range hoods have a vent that discharges outside. You can also prevent NO2 exposure by avoiding cigarette smoking and not idling <b>your</b> <b>car</b> whenever possible.|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, the Terrapins were coached by former Florida State head coach Tom Nugent. While with the Seminoles, Nugent {{had wanted to}} recruit a black player, but felt the racial climate there was unsuitable. He said that [...] "the head of the Ku Klux Klan lived in Tallahassee. You'd come to <b>your</b> <b>car</b> and there'd be a notice on it announcing a Klan meeting that night." [...] When he took over at Maryland in 1959, Nugent saw his opportunity. He {{instructed}} the Terrapins' quarterbacks coach Lee Corso to find a black player who was academically and athletically suited to come to College Park. Corso had been impressed by Roger Staubach's preferred receiver, Darryl Hill, during a freshman match between Maryland and Navy, and had also heard a rumor that he was considering leaving the Naval Academy. In 1962, Corso convinced Hill to transfer to Maryland, a school that had just 32 African-Americans in its 35,000 student body, and become the first black player in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). Once there, Hill quickly befriended the team's only Jew, linebacker Jerry Fishman.|$|E

According to Madonna, [...] "his is the direction of my record. That's what we intended, to make a record that you can play at a party or in <b>your</b> <b>car,</b> where you don't have to skip past a ballad. It's nonstop."

500|$|A {{reviewer}} for Dawn commended {{the album}} for being [...] "full of danceable, likeable tracks, {{and even the}} occasional, successful ballad like 'Until I Get Over You'".

[...] "AM to PM" [...] was said to hint at [...] "quite a lot of talent", and was praised for its [...] "slick lyrics, a fast pace, and a phat vibe".

He added that the songs sound mainstream and youthful. Rohin of Blogcritics gave a positive response to the song, emphasizing that [...] "it is almost one of the best pieces of throwaway pop in recent history". He also thought that the song represents a song [...] "that you can roll down the windows of <b>your</b> <b>car</b> and proudly headbang your way through a yellow light somewhere on a suburban side street." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine thought that Clarkson did a good impression of Pat Benatar in [...] "Since U Been Gone". He concluded his review by emphasizing that Breakaway proves that Clarkson has successfully dodged the sophomore slump but [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] helped her establish her success.

[...] Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly wrote that the song [...] "is rescued by Beyoncé, who whips the chorus with a belt so powerful you'd think it insulted her mother." [...] Slant Magazines Matthew Cole also praised the song writing, [...] "'Lift Off' is a study in stylized blockbuster excess, with West's best fanfare since Encore eventually being drowned out by a simulated rocket launch that will sound awesome in <b>your</b> <b>car</b> stereo provided it doesn't cause your subwoofers to bust your windows." [...] Rob Harvilla of Spin found a [...] "hook so ridiculous ('We gon take it to the moon / Take it to the stars!') that only Beyoncé could sell it."

500|$|The Molloy {{character}} {{is based on}} actor David Niven's performance as the character A. J. Raffles, a gentleman thief, in the 1939 film Raffles. The music heard {{at the beginning of}} the episode during the burglaries is taken from the film The Pink Panther, in which Niven played The Phantom, a similar character. Flanders tells Homer that his Shroud of Turin beach towels were stolen during one of the burglaries. Apu protects the Kwik-E mart with a rifle in a way similar to many of the images of Korean Grocery store owners during the 1992 Los Angeles riots.] Homer's dream of riding a nuclear bomb into oblivion is a reference to the famous scene from the film [...] Homer's line [...] "So I said, Look buddy, <b>your</b> <b>car</b> was upside-down when I got here. And as for your grandmother, she shouldn't have mouthed off like that!" [...] is a reference to Flannery O'Connor's short story [...] "A Good Man Is Hard to Find". The scene of Homer and Principal Skinner talking in front of the museum is a reference to a scene from the television series Dragnet. In a reference to the plot of the 1963 film It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, Molloy sends the residents of Springfield on a hunt for a treasure that is buried under a big letter. The ending sequence of the episode also references the film by using the same music and camera angles. In another scene that references It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, Bart tricks American actor Phil Silvers into driving his car into a river, just like Silvers's character did in the film.|$|E

40|$|Environmental campaigns often promote energy {{conservation}} {{by appealing to}} economic (for example, lower electricity bills) rather than biospheric concerns (for example, reduced carbon emissions), assuming that people are primarily motivated by economic self-interest. However, people also care about maintaining a favourable view of themselves (they want to maintain a 'positive self-concept'), and may prefer {{to see themselves as}} 'green' rather than 'greedy'. Consequently, people may find economic appeals less attractive than biospheric appeals. Across two studies, participants indicated feeling better about biospheric ('Want to protect the environment? Check <b>your</b> <b>car's</b> tire pressure') than economic ('Want to save money? Check <b>your</b> <b>car's</b> tire pressure') tyre-check appeals. In a field experiment, we found that an economic tyre-check appeal ('Do you care about your finances? Get a free tire check') elicited significantly less compliance than parallel biospheric and neutral appeals. Together, these studies discredit the conventional wisdom that appealing to economic self-interest {{is the best way to}} secure behaviour change. At least in some cases, our studies suggest, this strategy is not effective. ...|$|R
