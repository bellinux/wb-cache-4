6000|$|Except the Zobtenberg, rising {{blue and}} massive, on the {{southern}} horizon (famous mythologic Mountain, reminding you of an ARTHUR'S SEAT in shape too, only bigger and solitary), this Country, for many miles round, has nothing that could be called a Hill; it is definable as a bare wide-waving champaign, with slight bumps on it, or slow heavings and sinkings. Country mostly under culture, though it is of sandy quality; one or two sluggish brooks in it; and reedy meres or mires, drained in our day. It is dotted with Hamlets of the usual kind; and has patches of scraggy fir. Your horizon, even where bare, is limited, owing to the wavy heavings of the ground; windmills and church-belfries are your only resource, and even these, from about Leuthen and the Austrian position, leave the Borne quarter mostly invisible to you. Leuthen Belfry, the same which may have stood a hundred years before this Battle, ends in a small tile-roof, open only at the gables:--"Leuthen Belfry," [...] says a recent Tourist, [...] "is of small resource for a view. To south <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> distance, Sagschutz, Lobetintz and other Hamlets, amid scraggy fir-patches, and meadows, once miry pools; but to north you are soon shut in by a swell or slow rise, with two windmills upon it [important to readers at present]; and to eastward [Breslau side and Lissa side], or to westward [Friedrich's side], one has no view, except of the old warped rafters and their old mouldy tiles within few inches; or, if by audacious efforts at each end, {{to the risk of}} your neck, you get a transient peep, it is stopt, far short of Borne, by the slow irregular heavings, with or without fir about them."

50|$|The {{town hall}} {{was built by}} {{what was then the}} market square. The town hall square got its current length in the 1370s. Covered with a board roof in 1374, the town hall was {{probably}} a single-decked stone building with a basement. The attic was used as a storeroom.

50|$|A legend {{about the}} {{mountain}} claims {{it used to}} be the home of a troll. The troll hated people walking on his mountain, disturbing his rest, so he used to lie on top of the mountain to scare them away. If someone came too close, he threw rocks and boulders at them. If you walk the path to Sørmyrseter, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> still <b>see</b> <b>some</b> of them. The troll was careful only to be outside when it was cloudy, but once he was surprised by the sun and turned to stone. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> still clearly <b>see</b> its nose, mouth and chin if you look from the right angle, which is where the mountain has its name from; the ugly man.|$|R

Planting longleaf pine seedlings {{is an important step}} to meet this goal.

As the housing situation improved, most middle-class residents moved to better houses and immigrants left the shantytowns for the blocks. The blocks are termed [...] "HLM" [...] — habitation à loyer modéré ("moderated rent flats"), and districts of blocks are termed cités (housing estates). <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> Parisian housing estates here: https://www.flickr.com/photos/31090725@N08/sets/72157607880274493/. A popular urban planning concept at this time, popularized by Le Corbusier, a Swiss architect, was to separate areas of towns or cities according to several functions: living center (blocks), commercial center and working center, with the centers being connected by buses.

50|$|Gibbons was {{employed}} by Wren {{to work on}} St Paul's Cathedral and later was appointed as master carver to George I. He was also commissioned by King William III to create carvings, some of which adorn Kensington Palace today. An example of his work {{can be seen in}} the Presence Chamber above the fireplace, which was originally intended to frame a portrait of Queen Mary II after her death in 1694. Also in the Orangery at Kensington, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> his pieces. Many fine examples of his work can still be seen in the churches around London - particularly the choir stalls and organ case of St Paul's Cathedral. Some of the finest Gibbons carvings accessible to the general public are those on display at the National Trust's Petworth House in West Sussex, UK. At Petworth the Carved Room is host to a fine and extensive display of intricate wooden carvings by Gibbons.|$|E
5000|$|Bingo Bonus: call {{house in}} {{a certain number of}} calls and win the jackpot. This is played across all Mecca Bingo clubs in the UK and the jackpot varies from £750 to £1500, {{depending}} on the club in which it is played. The number of calls in which to call house varies also, for example the Mecca Club in Beeston states that if you call house in 46 numbers or less on the bonus page, then you win an extra £1500. In Mecca Knotty Ash, if you call house in 49 numbers or less on the bingo bonus page, you win an extra £1000. In Mecca Thanet, if you call house in 47 numbers or less on the bingo bonus page, you win an extra £1000. As <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see,</b> in <b>some</b> Mecca clubs it is easier to win £1000 on the bingo bonus page than others, because the number of calls required to win varies {{depending on the size of}} the club.|$|R
50|$|Eythorne {{also had}} a rhubarb-canning factory which was in {{operation}} until after the war. There was also a blacksmith's opposite the Crown Inn; the buildings fell into disuse and were redeveloped in the 1980s. Along the Colred Road {{was the site of}} the original Baptist church until the late 19th century, when it was moved to Chapel Hill due to a neighbour complaining about being woken up on Sunday with loud hymn singing. That neighbour bought the land for the chapel, which is still being used till this day. The nearby woods along the Coldred Road is named locally as Thommies Hole and was used as a training ground during the war. Some of the trenches dug can still be made out. There was also a narrow-gauge railway line, and that is now used as a footpath (although largely overgrown); <b>you</b> <b>can</b> still <b>see</b> <b>some</b> of the sleepers in place.|$|R
50|$|This {{is going}} {{clockwise}} around the loop. The loop tracks split {{from the main}} line just north of Orient Heights, turned east and then split with one direction heading east and the other south. Much of the rail's path was converted to roads when the line was removed, but <b>you</b> <b>can</b> still <b>see</b> <b>some</b> of the existing railbed that curved out into Crystal Cove at Winthrop Beach Station, and {{the remnants of the}} rail bridges as it crossed Belle Isle March to connect at Orient Heights. Today, one can drive along Veteran's Road (current path of the old line) to experience the course of the commuter train as it ran parallel to Shirley Street. The location of the various railway stations in Winthrop had a tremendous influence on the pattern of Winthrop's suburban growth; business and commerce grew up naturally around these stations and ultimately into what would become today's neighborhoods.|$|R
