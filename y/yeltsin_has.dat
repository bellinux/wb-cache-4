5000|$|... "Boris, you are wrong" [...] (Борис, ты не прав) is a {{political}} catchphrase, originally said by Yegor Ligachev to Boris Yeltsin on 1 July 1988 to tackle Yeltsin's split from Soviet politics. Ligachev {{was at the time}} a member of the Politburo, while Yeltsin was First Deputy Chairman of the Soviet State Committee for Construction. Speaking at the 19th All-Union Conference of the CPSU, Ligachev said: [...] "Dear comrades! We should not be silent because communist <b>Yeltsin</b> <b>has</b> chosen a wrong path. It turned out that the man does not have a creative, but a destructive force. His assessment of the perestroyka process, the approach and the method of work have been declared untenable and erroneous in the party. There are reasonable proposals in his speech, but in general it indicates that you, Boris, have not drawn the correct political conclusions". The form [...] "Boris, you are wrong" [...] was popularized by Gennady Khazanov.|$|E
5000|$|Historical {{evidence}} released under Russian President Boris <b>Yeltsin</b> <b>has</b> {{been brought}} to light indicating that the Soviet Union did not plan to invade Poland. In fact, Jaruzelski actually tried to persuade the Soviets to invade Poland {{in order to support}} martial law, only to be sternly turned down. This left the Solidarity [...] "problem" [...] to be sorted out by the Polish government (see also Soviet reaction to the Polish crisis of 1980-1981). However, the exact plans of the Soviet Union at that time have never been determined. Jaruzelski, however, has justified cracking down by alleging that the threat of Soviet intervention was quite likely had he not dealt with Solidarity internally. This question, as well as many other facts about Poland in the years 1945-1989, are presently under the investigation of government historians at the Institute of National Remembrance (Instytut Pamięci Narodowej, IPN), whose publications reveal facts from the Communist-era archives. Additionally, there are numerous confirmations from Czech army officers of the time speaking of Operation Krkonoše, plan of armed invasion of Poland, because of which many units of the Czechoslovak People's Army were stationed on highest alert, ready for deployment within hours.|$|E

50|$|Since Putin’s {{restructuring}} of provincial executives in 2004, placing them under direct appointment by the Kremlin upon approval of their legislatures, federalist supporters have also charged {{the president in}} reducing the provincial role of the Federation Council. Where <b>Yeltsin</b> <b>had</b> envisioned a chamber composing of regional concerns, they argue, critics view Putin's restructuring as deeply centralizing the Council to reflect the president’s and United Russia’s political interests, taking away provincial voices. Putin supporters counter these criticisms by acknowledging that <b>Yeltsin</b> <b>had</b> also appointed governors to Russia's federal subjects {{in the early days}} of the Federation.|$|R

But, while the net impact of the new team is likely to be positive, we should not expect any dramatic improvement in Russian economic performance in the near term. Moreover, there are good reasons to careful I v calibrate our expectations concerning the amount of success the new team will have in introducing a new reform agenda. ...|$|E

With {{the collapse of the}} Soviet Union, it seems logical to analyze pre-Bolshevik foreign policy to ascertain the likely direction of Russian policy in the Pacific. Russia and Japan have had economic relations throughout their history; one of the primary obstacles to normalized relations has been the Kurile Islands. Since <b>Yeltsin</b> <b>has</b> indicated his willingness {{on the issue of the}} islands, the possibility exists for closer Russo-Japanese relations. The reliance on military power has been overtaken by the need to ensure a country's economic health. Japan, an ally during the Cold War, can now be viewed as an economic competitor. Russia, an adversary during the Cold War, could become an economic ally. Continued U. S. influence in the Pacific requires a re-assessment of traditional relationships. Alliances unheard of in the Cold War are now possible. Closer ties between Russia and Japan could present new challenges to the United States in the Pacific. In order to prevent a loss of influence in the Pacific, new policy choices with regard to Russia and Japan need to be examined. [URL] United States Nav...|$|E
5000|$|In 1998, Duma deputy Aleksandr Salii {{asked the}} office of the Russian Prosecutor-General to {{investigate}} claims that a double <b>had</b> been impersonating <b>Yeltsin</b> for official purposes since the real Yeltsin's heart surgery in November 1996. Salii told journalists that he and colleagues had examined some 1,500 photographs and gathered evidence showing that a [...] "New Yeltsin" [...] had appeared after 1996, with the supposed decoy frequently displaying his injured hand, whereas the real <b>Yeltsin</b> <b>had</b> always tried to conceal that hand. <b>Yeltsin</b> <b>had</b> frequently disappeared from public view in preceding years, sometimes in circumstances that aroused widespread suspicion. In July 1995, Yeltsin disappeared from public view for weeks following a heart operation.

40|$|The {{hybrid of}} {{democratic}} and theocratic institutions of revolutionary Iran is now {{over twenty years}} old, and is undergoing challenge. An elected president with popular legitimacy but no control {{of the means of}} coercion is endeavouring to open up and liberalise, but is being opposed by the conservatives with theocratic vetoes, newspaper closures and street violence. Part One of this report looks at the diarchy of President Khatami and Supreme Leader Khamenei, their legitimacies, their ‘minimalist’ strategies, and their common interest in restraining their wilder supporters from provoking chaos or civil war. The report then considers the elements of ‘civil society’ resulting from deep structural change in Iran: demography and education, the role of women and the free press. Finally, this part considers the journalistic comparison of Khatami with Gorbachev, and finds that although both are/were attempting limited reform of a faltering system of which they were themselves a part, no Iranian <b>Yeltsin</b> <b>has</b> yet emerged. Part Two of the report is the results of in-depth interviews with 14 prominent reformers. They are optimistic about the prospects for long-term change; all the conservatives can do is postpone change or perpetrate a bloodbath, they cannot put the clock back. Our sample tended to consider the oil companies a bad influence. However, they made a sharp distinction between American companies, which they thought more ethical and transparent, and the secretive European, Arab and Japanese companies. Asked what the oil companies should do to promote democratic developement, the interviewees emphasised transparency above all...|$|E
40|$|As {{this issue}} of >i>Problems of Economic Transition>/i> goes to press, {{observers}} of the Russian scene are keeping a watchful eye on the political underpinnings of Russian economic reforms. After the December 1995 Duma elections, which saw a strong turnout for left-of-center groups and the subsequent sacking of key reformers in the government, including Anatolii Chubais, the June presidential elections take on heightened importance. Currently, the lead candidates are President Boris Yeltsin {{and leader of the}} Communist Party of the Russian Federation Gennadii Ziuganov. There are both short-term and long-term concerns associated with the presidential campaign and election. In the short term, President <b>Yeltsin</b> <b>has</b> already begun to increase state spending and credits to state enterprises in an effort to win support. This type of budget busting, plus the replacement of Chubais with the much more conservative Kadannikov as deputy prime minister for economics, has jeopardized Russia's relationship with the West, particularly the IMF and the World Bank. Even if the immediate issue of the IMF loan is resolved to everyone's satisfaction, strains in the relationships will remain, as will doubts over Yeltsin's real commitment to reform. In the longer run, many Russian and Western observers are concerned that if Yeltsin wins he will be too weak to promote reforms. First, his health is likely to restrict his ability to push reforms past a conservative Duma. Second, it is likely that in order to win he will have to seriously compromise his earlier positions on key reform issues including macrostabilization policies, privatization, and market access. If Ziuganov wins the election, it is fairly certain that reforms will at least be frozen, if not rolled back significantly. ...|$|E

Failure of the two groups to reach a compromise led to Yeltsin dissolving the Congress of People's Deputies in September 1993, leading to a constitutional crisis.|$|R
