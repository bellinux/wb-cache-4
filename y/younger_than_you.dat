60|$|CAESAR. Sphinx: you presume on your centuries. I am <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>you,</b> {{though your}} voice {{is but a}} girl's voice as yet.|$|E
6000|$|... 'As well as ever; and as {{glad to see}} you, as ever;' Mr Pecksniff made response. 'Why, you are <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>you</b> used to be!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And now, good night, Mr. Bridegroom; {{you want}} your beauty sleep, though I must say you look {{considerably}} <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>you</b> did two months ago.|$|E
6000|$|... "You ain't young," [...] objected Mrs. Hatchard. [...] "I'm {{three years}} <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> what <b>you</b> are," [...] said Mr. Hatchard, dispassionately.|$|R
6000|$|She went away, {{and shortly}} {{returned}} with a dry--"Miss Marget, the lady {{will be glad to}} see you; and that's more, my <b>young</b> madam, <b>than</b> <b>you</b> had a right to count upon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Griffin," [...] {{answered}} the Voice. A <b>younger</b> student <b>than</b> <b>you</b> were, almost an albino, six feet high, and broad, {{with a pink}} and white face and red eyes, who won the medal for chemistry." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, no; they're of very {{different}} type. I should imagine that he's <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>you</b> are. He was at Herbert's one afternoon when you called." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are looking}} very well, uncle," [...] she said, {{surveying}} him calmly; [...] "and <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>you</b> did last year. How is my cousin Morris? Will the aerophone talk yet?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And mine’s a good one," [...] {{said the}} Third, [...] "registered A1 at Lloyd’s, but she don’t {{worry about me}} going away. Your wife’s thirty years <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>you,</b> isn’t she?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Alban ran in, and {{received}} the visitor cordially with both hands. [...] "Welcome back to England! I needn't ask if the sea-voyage has done you good. You are looking ten years <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> when <b>you</b> went away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not much," [...] she said, hastily. [...] "What! {{trust that}} poor critter to you? No, sir! Thar's more ways of feeding a baby, <b>young</b> man, <b>than</b> <b>you</b> knows on, {{with all your}} 'nat'ral nourishment.' But it looks kinder logy and stupid." ...|$|R
50|$|Through the few {{references}} available, {{it can be}} {{presumed that}} Bao Si was born in 792 BC (three years <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> King <b>You)</b> and died in 771 BC (assuming that her death happened by suicide shortly after the Quanrong attack).|$|R
6000|$|... "And mine's good one," [...] {{said the}} Third, [...] "registered A 1 at Lloyds', but she don't {{worry about me}} going away. Your Wife's thirty years <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>you,</b> isn't she?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{are ever}} too sharp for us, in words, John. The damsel is <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>you,</b> by full two years; {{and yet she}} can always {{put you in the}} wrong, with her tongue." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{feel as if}} I'd presumed too far," [...] she said. [...] "After all, I'm only a {{girl and}} <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>you</b> are, which doesn't seem to justify my {{imposing}} my half-formed views on you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There was {{something}} here," [...] he muttered, [...] "something which has gone. What's that? Quest, {{your eyes are}} <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> mine. Can <b>you</b> see anything underneath that tree?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{you might}} do that. There are plenty of <b>younger</b> lads <b>than</b> <b>you</b> are {{trumpeters}} in the cavalry. I {{will look at the}} list and see what regiments have vacancies; but I doubt whether they will take you without a letter from your father saying that you are enlisting with his consent." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Leo, [...] "I am <b>younger</b> and {{stronger}} <b>than</b> <b>you.</b> Come, help me," [...] {{and he began}} to fasten the end of his rope to a strong, projecting point of ice. [...] "Now," [...] he said, [...] "hold my ankles." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because I think Tillett {{is paying}} her attentions," [...] was the reply. [...] "He’s ten years <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>you</b> are, and a bachelor. A girl would {{naturally}} prefer {{him to a}} middle-aged widower with five children." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wonder," [...] he said, [...] "how you others {{discover}} {{the secret of}} eternal youth. You and Macheson and Wilhelmina all look <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>you</b> did last year. I {{seem to be getting}} older all by myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|He had {{expected}} his companion {{to show signs}} of astonishment at his rashness, but Harding nodded. “I began with five but I was <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>you</b> are,” he said. “Business pays best yonder. What are you strongest at?” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's about it, isn't it? Haven't I hit it off?" [...] He paused, {{as though}} for a reply, {{but she was}} not as yet able to make him any. [...] "Come here, my dear." [...] She came and stood by him, so that he could put his arm round her waist. [...] "If it be as I suppose, you are better {{disposed}} to this <b>young</b> man <b>than</b> <b>you</b> are likely to be to any other, just at present." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because," [...] said Lambourne coolly, [...] "you {{dare not}} {{for your life}} lay a finger on me. I am <b>younger</b> and {{stronger}} <b>than</b> <b>you,</b> and have in me a double portion of the fighting devil, though not, it may be, quite {{so much of the}} undermining fiend, that finds an underground way to his purpose--who hides halters under folk's pillows, and who puts rats-bane into their porridge, as the stage-play says." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I dropt {{from the}} Star of Hope," [...] {{answered}} the gentleman, laughing. [...] "You {{have hit the}} mark, <b>young</b> sir, nearer <b>than</b> <b>you</b> think, for that {{is the name of}} the vessel that brought me here. I am a missionary; my name is Westwood; and I am thankful to say I have been successful in making a good commencement on this island. This is my wife--allow me to introduce you--and if you will come with me to my cottage--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We do. Love is {{one thing}} and {{friendship}} quite another. Because I'm <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>you....</b> I've got imagination.... I know what I am talking about. Mr. Capes, do you think... do you think I don't {{know the meaning of}} love?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not absurd at all," [...] Chavigny said. [...] "Turenne was {{a captain}} {{when he was}} a year <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>you</b> are, and there is many a noble who has been made a colonel before he ever drew sword in battle." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But then {{it seems}} disgraceful to be flogged, {{and to be}} sent to stand {{in the middle of a}} room full of people; and you are such a great girl: I am far <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>you,</b> and I could not bear it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You have lacked address. The {{woman does}} not live {{that is not}} to be won by any man who sets his mind to do it, if only he be of her station and have the means to {{maintain}} her in it or raise her to a better. A woman's love, sir, is a tree whose root is vanity. Your attentions flatter her, and predispose her to capitulate. Then, if you but wisely choose your time to deliver the attack, and do so with the necessary adroitness--nor is overmuch demanded--the battle is won with ease, and she surrenders. Believe me, Chatellerault, I am a <b>younger</b> man <b>than</b> <b>you</b> by full five years, yet in experience I am a generation older, and I talk of what I know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear Bessie, {{you know}} {{that is not what}} I meant. In that respect they are both alike. But you, when you were engaged, were about three years <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> the man, and I am nearly twenty years <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> Sir Francis. <b>You</b> don't suppose that I can put myself {{altogether}} on the same platform with him as you did with your lover. It is absurd to suppose it. Do you let him go his way, and me go mine. You may be sure that not a word of reproach will ever fall from my lips."--"Till we are married," [...] Cecilia had intended to say, but she did not complete the sentence.|$|R
500|$|While Malkmus {{was still}} abroad, Kannberg {{moved in with}} a friend and his roommate Jason Fawkes in Sacramento, California. Fawkes and Kannberg formed a new band called Pa, with Fawkes on drums. Kannberg said, [...] "I didn't know if Pavement {{was going to do}} {{anything}} so I just said, 'Let's start another band.'" [...] The duo frequently jammed, and considered a future release on Drag City. Pa recorded a series of instrumental demos, including new songs [...] "Two States", [...] "Forklift", and [...] "Collapse", at <b>Young's</b> Louder <b>Than</b> <b>You</b> Think studios during a trip to Stockton. After Kannberg and Fawkes had returned to Sacramento, Malkmus visited and the group decided to turn the Pa songs into a Pavement project. Malkmus wrote lyrics to [...] "Forklift" [...] and presented the band with [...] "two or three other songs" [...] he had previously written.|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps two," [...] {{returned}} Mrs. Merrick; [...] "for {{her youngest}} sister, {{who was named}} Violet, married a vagabond Irishman and had a daughter about a year <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>you.</b> The mother died, but whether the child survived her or not I have never learned." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Jes' so, child, {{she died}} when she was a year <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>you</b> be; she was not lost, for God took her. Poor Hitty! her life jest dried up like a brook in August,--jest so. Well, she was {{hopefully}} pious, and it was better for her." ...|$|E
6000|$|Haldane was in {{excellent}} spirits when, accompanied by Boone, he greeted me in Winnipeg station. [...] "I feel less rusty already, {{and you look}} several years <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>you</b> did a few months ago," [...] he said. [...] "But we have breakfast ready, and can talk comfortably over it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, fair sirs {{and sweet}} lady, though <b>you</b> be <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> I, <b>you</b> have surely {{heard of the}} Black Death. Well named was it, for never was pestilence more dire; and the venom was so strong, that the very lips and eyelids grew livid black, {{and then there was}} no hope. Little thought of such disease was there, I trow, in kings' houses, and all the fair young lords and ladies, the {{children}} of King Edward, as then was, were full of sport and gamesomeness as you see these dukes be now. And never a one was blither than the Lady Joan--she they called Joan of the Tower, being a true Londoner born--bless her! My aunt Cis would talk by the hour of her pretty ways and kindly mirth. But 'twas even as the children have the game in the streets-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are a young gentleman {{after my}} own heart," [...] Prince Charles said, [...] "and I promised myself on {{shipboard}} {{that we should}} be great friends; but I have been so busy since I landed, and you have been so occupied in my service, that I have seen but little of you. On your return I hope that I shall be able to have you near my person. I am half jealous of you, for while <b>you</b> are <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> I am <b>you</b> have seen good service and taken part in great battles, but hitherto I have led a life almost of idleness." ...|$|R
500|$|Pavement {{was formed}} in 1989 in Stockton, California, by Stephen Malkmus and Scott Kannberg. Malkmus and Kannberg had {{previously}} performed together in the band Bag O' Bones. Pavement had its start playing at open mike nights at clubs and bars. The songs the band played during this time were mostly covers, although they also performed many original songs that would later be released on Slay Tracks. Malkmus recalls, [...] "It was pretty reasonable {{to be able to}} make a single for $1,000, so we decided to go for it. We didn't have any real plans because we weren't a real band." [...] Two local studios existed in Stockton, the cheaper and less professionally minded of which was Gary <b>Young's</b> Louder <b>Than</b> <b>You</b> Think Studio. The band decided to record at Young's studio due to their admiration of other local punk bands who had recorded there, including The Young Pioneers and The Authorities. Kannberg reportedly borrowed $800 from his father to record Slay Tracks.|$|R
