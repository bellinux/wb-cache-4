"Work" [...] was {{positively}} reviewed by writers of Entertainment Weekly; Kyle Anderson opined that the track was [...] "a thoroughbred {{entry in the}} song of summer race", while Ray Rahman called it a [...] "bulletproof party banger". Devone Jones of PopMatters viewed Azalea's [...] "sombre thought-processing" [...] as [...] "well-executed", and appreciated her for [...] "picking gritty [...] beats over EDM and dance music as well as deciding to rap about her life before her new-found fame as opposed to her fame". Likewise, Craig Mathieson of The Sydney Morning Herald explained that the song highlighted Azalea's [...] "ability to meld the club music sounds that are permeating American hip-hop and pop into something unexpected and affecting". In an October 2013 publication, Kitty Empire of The Observer wrote that [...] "Work" [...] was [...] "ear-catching", and contained Azalea's [...] "best-known zing"; [...] "Valley girls giving blowjobs for Louboutins / What do <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>that?</b> / Head over heels?". In 2014, Nolan Feeney of Time said [...] "Work" [...] was [...] "by far the best thing she's done", and highlighted Azalea's conviction and [...] "rapid-fire" [...] delivery, while Digital Spy's Lewis Corner felt the song [...] "remains one of [...] finest moments".

2500|$|Scott {{has also}} said, [...] "I've always been {{interested}} in spirituality, and I've never joined any religion. And it really turns me off when people from one religion say theirs is the only way. And I believe all religions are just different ways to spirituality. And if <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>that</b> universality, well, then I'm all for it." [...] Despite Scott's pluralist perspective, The Waterboys have been labelled as [...] "Christian rock" [...] by some reviewers and heathens by some Christians [...]|$|E

2500|$|In 1987, MTV was in {{its early}} years. They were {{traveling}} to several colleges. MTV made a stop in Marquette, MI. It was there that Mike Pearson {{and a group of}} college friends from State University of New Paltz were dancing in front of the MTV Team. Mike began to dance with one hand behind his head and one hand extended out straight.

2500|$|Different {{scholars}} have varying interpretations for {{the concept of}} amanitvam, humility, as virtue in the Bhagwad Gita. For example, Prabhupada explains humility to mean one should not be anxious to have the satisfaction of being honored by others. The material conception of life makes us very eager to receive honor from others, but {{from the point of}} view of a man in perfect knowledge—who knows that he is not this body—anything, honor or dishonor, pertaining to this body is useless. Jopson explains amanitvam, humility, as lack of arrogance and pride, and one of twenty six virtues in a human being that if perfected, leads one to a divine state of living and the ultimate truth. Eknath Easwaran writes that the Gita's subject is [...] "the war within, the struggle for self-mastery that every human being must wage if he or she is to emerge from life victorious", and [...] "The language of battle is often found in the scriptures, for it conveys the strenuous, long, drawn-out campaign we must wage to free ourselves from the tyranny of the ego, the cause of all our suffering and sorrow". To get in touch with your true self, whether <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>that</b> God, Brahman, etc., one has to let go of the ego. [...] The Sanskrit word Ahamkara literally translates into The-sound-of-I, or quite simply the sense of the self or ego.|$|E
