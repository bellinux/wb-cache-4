2500|$|When T.I. {{spoke on}} {{the feel of the}} album he stated: [...] "It has a more {{balanced}} blend of that vintage 'U Don't Know Me,' 'Top Back,' Trap Muzik sound with some of the more mainstream radio records that <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> Paper Trail. It's more of a cohesive blend." [...] In an interview with Rap-Up, T.I. revealed his thoughts on the album and claimed: [...] "I think it’s a lot more urban than Paper Trail, and less apologetic than No Mercy. I think it’s more diversified than T.I. vs. T.I.P. though. It’s got a lotta heart, it’s got a lotta edge. It’s a creative album. It’s probably harder than most of the shit that’s coming out right now.|$|E
