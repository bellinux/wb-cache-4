Here I {{sit with}} my paper, my pen and my ink, First of this thing, and that thing, and t'other thing think; Then my {{thoughts}} come so pell-mell all into my mind, That the sense or the subject I never can find: This word is wrong placed,--no {{regard to the}} sense, The present and future, instead of past tense, Then my grammar I want; O dear! what a bore, I think I shall never attempt to write more, With patience I then my thoughts must arraign, Have them all in due order like mutes in a train, [...] 10 Like them too must wait in due patience and thought, Or else my fine works will all come to nought. My wit too's so copious, it flows like a river, But disperses its waters on black and white never; Like smoke it appears independent and free, [...] 15 But ah luckless smoke! it all passes like thee-- Then at length all my patience entirely lost, My paper and pens in the fire are tossed; But come, try again--you must never despair, Our Murray's or Entick's are not all so rare, [...] 20 Implore their assistance--they'll come to your aid, Perform all your business without being paid, They'll tell you the present tense, future and past, Which should come first, and which should come last, This Murray will do--then to Entick repair, [...] 25 To find out the meaning of any word rare. This they friendly will tell, and ne'er make you blush, With a jeering look, taunt, or an O fie! tush! Then straight all your thoughts {{in black and white}} put, Not minding the if's, the be's, and the but, [...] 30 Then read it all over, see how it will run, How answers the wit, the retort, and the pun, Your writings may then with old Socrates vie, May on the same shelf with Demosthenes lie, May as Junius be sharp, or as Plato be sage. [...] 35 The pattern or satire to all of the age; But stop--a mad author I mean not to turn, Nor with thirst of applause does my heated brain burn, Sufficient that sense, wit, and grammar combined, My letters may make some slight food for the mind; [...] 40 That my thoughts to my friends I may freely impart, In all the warm language that flows from the heart. Hark! futurity calls! it loudly complains, It bids me step forward and just hold the reins, My excuse shall be humble, and faithful, and true, [...] 45 Such as I fear can be made but by few-- Of writers this age has abundance and plenty, Three score and a thousand, two millions and twenty, Three score of them wits who all sharply vie, To try what odd creature they best can belie, [...] 50 A thousand are prudes who for CHARITY write, And fill up their sheets with spleen, envy, and spite[,] One million are bards, who to Heaven aspire, And stuff their works full of bombast, rant, and fire, T'other million are wags who in Grubstreet attend, [...] 55 And just like a cobbler the old writings mend, The twenty are those who for pulpits indite, And pore over sermons all Saturday night. And now my good friends--who come after I mean, As I ne'er wore a cassock, or dined with a dean. [...] 60 Or like cobblers at mending I never did try, Nor with poets in lyrics attempted to vie; As for prudes these good souls I both hate and detest, So here I believe the matter must rest.-- I've heard your complaint--my answer I've made, [...] 65 And since to <b>your</b> <b>calls</b> all the tribute I've paid, Adieu my good friend; pray never despair, But grammar and sense and everything dare, Attempt but to write dashing, easy, and free, Then take out your grammar and pay him his fee, [...] 70 Be not a coward, shrink not to a tense, But read it all over and make it out sense. What a tiresome girl!--pray soon make an end, Else my limited patience you'll quickly expend. Well adieu, I no longer your patience will try-- [...] 75 So swift to the post now the letter shall fly.|$|E

Meanwhile, the three fugitives hiding in the brothel where Robin had previously hidden and Esteban that night disguised as [...] "Estefania" [...] a fictional co-worker of Adriana in [...] "Concorde". Andres also learns of the alleged conspiracy in the alleged plotters were Milton and Ricardo Diaz to sink Concorde and therefore had been killed. Esteban accomplished using his false identity to talk to Adriana in her university (where she's studying Laws) for information to flee the country in one of the planes and whose opportunity arises for a trip to Panama whose Andres would do by order of his father (though a strategy to get him away from Buendia and Adriana) and who in turn directs Botero blame Buendia as the mastermind of the death of Milton, but Botero abort his mission after see Adriana in the reception and even Acero guarantees a good paying job. Andres decides to help the fugitives to flee the country as well as an information gained by Adriana, the captain would handle the plane was close to the family Acero, Captain AugustoFajardo, decides to do a favor Andres despite his lack of prior planning. Esteban then takes the information to his friends (even Robin had never ridde in plane) while Carlos wrote a complete history of all that had happened to Susana and outlines a plan in would enter as stowaways on the plane which would land abandoned on a track through the jungle in Panama, for lack of money Robin decides to dress as a prostitute to get money which gets several dollars. Paulino who suspected the unusual flight of Andres to Panama mistakenly believe that on the plane were the 2 million dollars and encouraged by his mother plans to call the police into believing that the plane was leaving with a drug shipment. The flight leaves at 7:30 am for all but inadvertently anticipates the flight 15 minutes before due to weather conditions.

Once all three are up, the pilot and copilot ignore Andre's plans and fugitives, and fugitives ignore the sudden change pilot so Robin decides armed hijack the plane. Therefore, the plane takes off and surprise the police orders to cancel the flight (thanks to Paulino puff), Robin in principle stands firm on keeping kidnapped the plane in which Carlos and Andres vainly trying to dissuade her.

Andrés and Carlos Alberto deter Robin because even though they were flying Air Force would force them to land or kill them. Having no other option, Andrés stop the aircraft and the pilots pressed by Robin to turn the aronave and fugitives flee taking advantage of the control tower would not see them. Robin, Carlos Alberto and Esteban manage to flee but Esteban was severely injured his right foot.
