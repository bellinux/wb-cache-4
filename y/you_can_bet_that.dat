The director uses all means to his disposal to keep the viewer engaged and interested {{in the life of the}} main protagonist, Nemo Nobody." [...] Fred Topel, writing for Screen Junkies, praised the film's artistry, saying [...] "All of Nemo's lives are painful.

2500|$|Sandé {{said the}} key to a {{successful}} song was simplicity. The singer pointed out that she could never have used songs which she wrote when she was 17 because she made the songs too complicated; saying there were too many words and parts to the track. She stated that the key feature to a classical song was keeping the [...] "melody simple" [...] and having big [...] "lyric effective", which was much easier said than actually done. Sandé said that another important key to a good song when songwriting is using [...] "honesty" [...] and [...] "raw emotion" [...] as the best way to write. She said that if she attempts to write something which is [...] "too smart" [...] the creative process will not work for her. [...] "Kill the Boy" [...] {{was one of the first}} ideas that came to Sandé's head. If she has to work on a song longer than a day, she will not go back to it because it won't work. She went on to say if it was to work, the idea for the song would be almost instant. Sandé said that all her songs are about world peace and political issues. She is the same person since gaining the record deal with Virgin Records, and they are the same songs which she planned for the album before gaining the deal. She said that a lot of people didn't see the potential in the songs or in her, but once she gained the record deal, she gained more confidence. [...] "When you get knocked back so much you kind of learn to believe in yourself, stand up for yourself, because <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>bet</b> <b>that</b> nobody else is going to do it." ...|$|E

Remembering Dick, and how he always wished for an instrument to help work out his plan for irrigation, I was certainly surprised to see these strangers surveying--and surveying upon Laddy's plot of land. It was a sandy road there, and Jose happened to be walking. So I reined in and asked these engineers what they were doing. The leader, who was that same bold fellow who had followed me, seemed much pleased at being addressed. He was swaggering--too friendly; not my idea of a gentleman at all. He said {{he was glad to}} tell me he was going to run water all over Altar Valley. Dad, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>bet</b> <b>that</b> made me wild. That was Dick's plan, his discovery, and here were surveyors on Laddy's claim.|$|E

5000|$|Mesoblast's {{solution}} for back pain came under heavy criticism from competitor Regenexx in August 2015. Dr. Chris Centeno said the trial results were [...] "spit shined" [...] with confusing and misleading language, press releases for phases 1 and 2 {{did not include}} images of MRIs to prove that discs were regenerated and expressed doubts about maintaining cell quality while mass-producing cells. He also said the host's immune system removes the injected stem cells. [...] Centeno said: [...] "Whenever you see a company drop key imaging results that are needed to impress insurers (like positive MRI changes in the spine) <b>you</b> <b>can</b> almost <b>bet</b> <b>that</b> there are serious troubles brewing. Then when you observe that what should take a few sentences to describe {{whether or not the}} product helped pain and function actually takes an entire page of reported numbers sliced and diced 10 different ways, you know there are serious issues." ...|$|R

60|$|Enough! I hated Kerner, {{and one day}} I met him and {{we became}} friends. He was young and gloriously melancholy because his spirits were so high and life had so much in store for him. Yes, he was almost riotously sad. That was his youth. When a man begins to be hilarious in a sorrowful way <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>bet</b> a million <b>that</b> he is dyeing his hair. Kerner's hair was {{plentiful}} and carefully matted as an artist's thatch should be. He was a cigaretteur, and he audited his dinners with red wine. But, most of all, he was a fool. And, wisely, I envied him, and listened patiently while he knocked Velasquez and Tintoretto. Once {{he told me that}} he liked a story of mine that he had come across in an anthology. He described it to me, and I was sorry that Mr. Fitz-James O'Brien was dead and could not learn of the eulogy of his work. But mostly Kerner made few breaks and was a consistent fool.|$|R

You see, Worry wants the boys to elect a captain soon. But perhaps he has not confided in you youngsters. He will suggest that you elect Homans or me. Well, I won't run for the place, so it'll be Homans. He's the man to captain us, that's certain. Graves thinks, though, that he can pull the wires and be elected captain. He's way off. Besides, Peg, he's making a big mistake. Worry doesn't like him, and when he finds out about this break in {{training}} we'll have a new third-baseman. No doubt Blake will play the bag. Graves is the only drag in Worry's baseball machine now, and he'll not last.... So, Peg, don't think any more about it. Mind you, the whole team circles round you. You're the pivot, and as sure as you're born you'll be Wayne's captain next year. That's something for you {{to keep in mind}} and work for. If Graves keeps after you--hand him one! That's not against rules. Punch him! If Worry knew the truth he would pat you on the back for slugging Graves. Cheer up, Peg!

40|$|The {{tone of the}} {{presentation}} is set with {{the writing of the}} abstract. Wanting a trip to Vienna is not a good enough reason for framing an abstract unless the data are really interesting. If you don't find them so, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>bet</b> your life <b>that</b> nobody else will. Have you presented the work before? Increasingly, the forms inviting abstracts stipulate that they should contain novel data. This protects the audience from boredom and your reputation from the aspersion that you never have anything new to say. It has been my practice to communicate similar data at a second meeting provided it contains some new results and that it is targeted at a totally unrelated specialist group. Hopefully, no one will have heard the information before. However, it is not acceptable to simply rehash the same abstract but should reflect the special interests of the second group. If one genuinely wants the abstract accepted for oral presentation it must contain a clear hypothesis, a brief description of methods, an exposition of results, and a conclusion. That well worn phrase 'results will be presented' simply raises the suspicion that the author is hoping that the data will be ready by the time that the conference begins. Sometimes, in the rush to meet deadlines for abstract submission, the needs of coauthors are overlooked. This is a sensitive area and can easily temporarily wreck {{what appeared to be a}} harmonious collaboration. Do make sure that all coauthors have seen the abstract before submission and are happy with the content [...] it is good research practice and important to the smooth running of the research group...|$|R

50|$|The Neo-Futurist {{aesthetic}} {{demands that}} everything that transpires in their theater be non-illusory, {{which is to say}} that they pretend nothing; actors only play themselves. All plays take place on a stage, specifically, the stage on which they are performed, in the present. If one of the performers reports that something has happened, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>bet</b> <b>that</b> it really happened. Much of their work contains the possibility of failure, a unique theatrical component that keeps them and the audience honest. Their plays are wildly eclectic, touching on all genres and tones; plays may be political, satirical, personal, tragic, comic, abstract, musical, surreal, poetic, and so on.|$|E

The basic gist is that he was stolen from his mother, Nina Webster, when he was just a baby and promptly disappeared from the shows landscape." [...] Hughes also wrote of Ronan returning to solve Diane Jenkins (Maura West) murder, saying: [...] "All of this is great theater, and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>bet</b> <b>that</b> producers and writers will milk the story for all its worth, potentially allowing Branson the opportunity to cultivate his character into something more permanent." [...] When Bransons exit in November 2012 was announced, Jamey Giddens of Zap2it wrote: [...] "Jeff Branson has had more stints on The Young and the Restless than Sharon Newman in the funny farm." [...] He also said that it was a [...] "bummer" [...] to see Branson leave, as he thought the characters relationship with Phyllis was [...] "smoking hot".

Mekaal Hasan Band's (MHB's) third studio album, Andholan is the first release of theirs to feature a new and improved Indo-Pak line-up that features the recorded debut and introduction of Indian singer, Sharmistha Chatterjee on lead vocals. Mekaal Hasan and Mohammad Ahsan Papu, who were the founding members of this critically acclaimed music group, reprise their roles as lead guitarist and flautist, respectively, with Indian heavyweights and band members Gino Banks and Shledon D'Silva joining them on their live performances. The innovative songwriting process that went into the making of this album incorporates the sounds of classic jazz-rock groups from the 70's, classical/Sufi music melodies and a dash of rock fusion to make this a thoroughly exquisite album. From the adrenalin-pumping introductory song [...] "Ghungat" [...] to the tranquility-evoking, conclusive track “Kinarey”, this album will leave you in a state of spellbinding bliss.|$|E
