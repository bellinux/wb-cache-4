500|$|Officials {{and members}} of the Archduke's party {{discussed}} what to do next. The archduke's chamberlain, Baron Rumerskirch, proposed that the couple remain at the Town Hall until troops could be brought into the city to line the streets. Governor-General Oskar Potiorek vetoed this suggestion on the grounds that soldiers coming straight from maneuvers would not have the dress uniforms appropriate for such duties. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> Sarajevo is full of assassins?" [...] he concluded.|$|E
500|$|Later {{commentators}} generally {{described the}} Arthurdale experiment as a failure. Roosevelt herself was sharply discouraged by a 1940 visit {{in which she}} felt the town had become excessively dependent on outside assistance. However, the residents considered the town a [...] "utopia" [...] compared to their previous circumstances, and many were returned to economic self-sufficiency. Roosevelt personally considered the project a success, later speaking of the improvements she saw in people's lives there and stating, [...] "I don't know whether <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> is worth half a million dollars. But I do." ...|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Kennedy {{sat down}} for an {{interview}} with entertainer Jack Paar. The senator was in a grave mood; when asked how he thought the White House might accommodate a family as large as his, he responded, [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> is going to be my biggest problem?" [...] When Paar more seriously asked if jobs would solve the problems of urban ghettos, Kennedy replied that while job opportunity was important, it needed to be accompanied by [...] "compassion for one's fellow human beings." [...] Paar then asked, [...] "What {{did you think when you}} heard that Dr. King had been assassinated?" [...] Kennedy answered, [...] "That more and more people are turning to violence.

To escape the pressures of London, the family moved to rural Down House in September. On 11 January 1844, Darwin mentioned his theorising to the botanist Joseph Dalton Hooker, writing with melodramatic humour [...] "it is like confessing a murder". Hooker replied [...] "There may in my opinion have been a series of productions on different spots, & also a gradual change of species. I shall be delighted to hear how <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> this change may have taken place, as no presently conceived opinions satisfy me on the subject." ...|$|E
500|$|Ferraro gained immediate, {{large-scale}} media attention. At first, journalists {{focused on}} her novelty as {{a woman and her}} poor family background, and their coverage was overwhelmingly favorable. Nevertheless, Ferraro faced many press questions about her foreign policy inexperience, and responded by discussing her attention to foreign and national security issues in Congress. She faced a threshold of proving competence that other high-level female political figures have had to face, especially those who might become commander-in-chief; the question [...] "Are you tough enough?" [...] was often directed to her. Ted Koppel questioned her closely about nuclear strategy and during Meet the Press she was asked, [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> in any way the Soviets might be tempted to try to take advantage of you simply because you are a woman?" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{existence}} of the band itself caused a debate in the metal underground. For example, during the early 1990s, Bård Faust of Emperor brought up the subject when he discussed with Euronymous, guitarist/vocalist from the seminal black metal band Mayhem, in his zine Orcustus about the Norwegian scene. Faust asked: [...] "Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> something is terribly wrong when it {{has gone so far}} that we have a Christian [...] "death metal" [...] band here (Crush Evil)? Any advice on how we should kill them?" [...] Euronymous replied to this: [...] "It's bad enough to have a couple of society bands, but a Christian band is too much. But don't worry, we have plans. They will not continue for a very long time." [...] However, the band persevered despite these threats. Antestor was never forced to split apart, and in an almost ironic twist of fate, Jan Axel Blomberg (better known as Hellhammer, the drummer for Mayhem) was Antestor's session drummer on their latest two releases.|$|E

500|$|In 2007, Edwards {{was part}} of a panel that {{appeared}} on CNN's Paula Zahn Now, along with Roland S. Martin and Jesse Lee Peterson. The purpose was to discuss racial segregation in American cities. He told Zahn that white children should seek out those who share [...] "the same values and traditions and heroes," [...] and that [...] "forced integration" [...] was a [...] "march toward totalitarianism." [...] He said: [...] "Crime and violence follow African-Americans wherever they go, and if <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> is racist, then spend some time on the mean streets of south Memphis." [...] Martin described his remarks as unfit for national television. Edwards made a second appearance on Paula Zahn Now in 2009, during which he said: [...] "Whites are in for the fight of their lives. America is becoming balkanized. We are being robbed of having a future in the very nation our ancestors carved from the wilderness." ...|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Unapologetic Bitch" [...] {{talks about}} a scorned lover rediscovering their inner strength, with Madonna [...] "shooting a few poison arrows {{into the heart of}} some dude who's done her wrong," [...] as noted by Rolling Stone Rob Sheffield. During the song, she {{repeatedly}} labels an ex's bad behavior as [...] "bullshit" [...] and tells him, [...] "fuck you". In another part, she mocks, [...] "When we did it, I'll admit it, wasn't satisfied." [...] In the chorus, she sings: [...] "It might sound like I’m an unapologetic bitch / but sometimes you know I gotta call I like it is." [...] The song was allegedly written about Madonna's ex-boyfriend Brahim Zaibat. She told Rolling Stone that the song [...] "it's like, fuck you, I'm going to have fun. You think you're going to ruin my life and <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> it's over for me, but guess what? It's not. Life goes on."

500|$|... "Liberty Walk" [...] {{was written}} by Cyrus, Nicholas J. Scapa, John Read Fasse, Michael McGinnis, Antonina Armato and Tim James. It was {{produced}} by the latter three under their stage name Rock Mafia. The song serves as the opening track of Can't Be Tamed (2010). In an interview with Sway Calloway for MTV News, Cyrus explained the lyrical inspiration of the song which is about female empowerment, saying: [...] "It's just about freeing yourself from anything you think is holding you back. And I think that's really important, especially for girls, {{because so many people}} are told, 'No, you can't do something,' or, 'You need to be this because Mom and Dad say that, teachers say this.'" [...] Upon the making of the song, Cyrus stated in the same interview that she tried to combine a serious topic with a lighter sound, explaining: [...] "I wrote it for women that feel like they're stuck in abusive relationships, but it's a dance song". She elaborated: [...] "So <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> must be kind of a sad ballad, but it's a party song. ... It's about breaking free." ...|$|E

[...] featuring her, {{in the words}} of Lester, [...] "sweet, sultry and sour" [...] voice, which suggests [...] "a frictional relationship with the high life." [...] A critic from Digital Spy, Robert Cospey, wrote that the track [...] "finds [...] caught between fame and a more innocent time" [...] with the lines [...] "My head's filling up fast with wicked games/ How can I fuck with fun again when I'm known?" [...] The tongue-in-cheek word [...] "Yeah!" [...] is repeated after each verse. Another lyric, [...] "It's a new art form showing people how little we care" [...] is described as [...] "perfectly damning the wave of banal hedonism most recently celebrated by the MTV Video Music Awards", according to Kevin Liedel from Slant Magazine. At the bridge, Lorde sings [...] "I fall apart, with all my heart/ And you can watch from your window", which was described as a [...] "perfect" [...] commentary on the breakdowns of teenage celebrities in an article published by The Huffington Post.|$|E
500|$|In the 1962 U.S. Senate special {{election}} in Massachusetts, Kennedy initially faced a Democratic Party primary challenge from Edward J. McCormack, Jr., the state Attorney General. Kennedy's slogan was [...] "He {{can do more}} for Massachusetts", the same one John had used in his first campaign for the seat ten years earlier. McCormack {{had the support of}} many liberals and intellectuals, who thought Kennedy inexperienced and knew of his suspension from Harvard, a fact which later became public during the race. Kennedy also faced the notion that with one brother President and another U.S. Attorney General, [...] "Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> Teddy is one Kennedy too many?" [...] But Kennedy proved to be an effective street-level campaigner. In a televised debate, McCormack said [...] "The office of United States Senator should be merited, and not inherited," [...] and said that if his opponent's name was Edward Moore, not Edward Moore Kennedy, his candidacy [...] "would be a joke". Voters thought McCormack's performance overbearing, and with the family political machine's finally getting fully behind him, Kennedy won the September 1962 primary by a two-to-one margin. In the November {{special election}}, Kennedy defeated Republican George Cabot Lodge II, product of another noted Massachusetts political family, gaining 55percent of the vote.|$|E
500|$|In the {{conclusion}} of the [...] "Inside the Episode" [...] segment Weiss spoke about Arya's story, saying [...] "Arya is in danger, she's got an open wound in her stomach, and the one person who has protected her to this point unfortunately gets murdered. The fact that the Many-Faced God gets {{the people who have been}} promised to him really makes <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> there's almost an inevitability about what happens to people who run afoul of the Faceless Men, as Arya has done." [...] Weiss continued about the final part of the sequence, [...] "Arya's telling Jaqen by putting the face on the wall that 'this account is settled, and we're good here, and now I'm going to walk away,' and I think she knows what the answer's going to be. The implication, obviously, is that Jaqen was, on some level, rooting for the outcome that he got. He may be [...] "no one," [...] but there's still enough of a person left in him to respect, and admire who this girl is and what she's become. Arya finally tells us something that we've kind of known all along, that she's not no one, she's Arya Stark of Winterfell." ...|$|E

500|$|Most visibly {{during the}} 2012 term, in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, Sotomayor {{was part of}} a {{landmark}} 5–4 majority that upheld most of the provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (while being part of a dissent against the reliance upon the Constitution's Taxing and Spending Clause rather than Commerce Clause in arriving at the support). Legal writer Jeffrey Toobin wrote, [...] "Sotomayor's concerns tended toward the earthbound and practical. Sometimes, during oral arguments, she would go on tangents involving detailed questions about the facts of cases that would leave her colleagues stupefied, sinking into their chairs. This time, though, she had a simple line of inquiry. States require individuals to buy automobile insurance (implicitly suggesting the unavoidable comparison to health insurance and the fairness of the applying the same principle to health insurance as well)." [...] Sotomayor concluded with the incisive rhetorical flourish in the Court directed at the attorneys: [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> if some states decided not to impose an insurance requirement that the federal government would be without power to legislate and require every individual to buy car insurance?" [...] For Toobin, this distinction drawn by Sotomayor was the heart of the argument for the case in which she was part of the prevailing majority opinion.|$|E
500|$|Beghe {{played an}} ice hockey {{star in the}} Perry Mason TV film The Case of the All-Star Assassin, an NBC-TV telefeature {{broadcast}} November 19, 1989. In 1991 he played a State Trooper in the film Thelma & Louise (reuniting him with Sarandon, with whom he'd appeared in Compromising Positions), and was Demi Moore's love interest in the 1997 film G.I. Jane. He had recurring roles on Picket Fences and Melrose Place, and became a cast member of Chicago Hope in 1997, portraying electrician Danny Blaines opposite romantic interest Dr. Austin played by Christine Lahti. In a 1997 interview in The Boston Herald, Beghe spoke about his respect for his fellow cast members in Chicago Hope: [...] "I think it's the best cast assembled that I've ever seen. One for one, they're incredible. And to work with Christine Lahti? I'd drop {{a lot of things}} for that. She's so good and smart and dedicated. I've become a better actor just for working with her." [...] He commented on his character on Melrose Place, a closeted military officer who had feelings for Matt, played by Doug Savant: [...] "I thought we should kiss, but it was too much. TV is a very specific medium, and you're naive if <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> everything is just based on artistic decisions. If it prevents them from selling some products, that's a major consideration. But I'm an actor. I'll do whatever it takes." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2007 the duo fronted the UK {{version of}} Apple Inc.'s [...] "Get a Mac" [...] adverts, with Mitchell playing PC. The adverts {{received}} much criticism. Writing in The Guardian, Charlie Brooker {{claimed that the}} use of Mitchell and Webb in the adverts was a curious choice. He compared the characters of PC and Mac in the adverts to those of Mark and Jeremy in Peep Show, stating that [...] "when you see the ads, you think, 'PCs are a bit rubbish yet ultimately lovable, whereas Macs are just smug, preening tossers.'" [...] The British Sitcom Guide also criticised the pair for [...] "selling their souls". One journalist called the adverts [...] "worse than not funny", and accused Mitchell and Webb of [...] "an act of grave betrayal" [...] for taking corporate work. In an interview with The Telegraph, Robert Webb responded to the duo's critics, stating that [...] "when someone asks, 'Do you want to do some funny ads for not many days in the year and be paid more than you would be for an entire series of Peep Show?' the answer, obviously, is, 'Yeah, that's fine.'" [...] In the same interview, Mitchell also said: [...] "I don't see what is morally inconsistent with a comedian doing an advert. It's all right to sell computers, isn't it? Unless <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> capitalism is evil– which I don't. It's not like we're helping to flog a baby-killing machine." ...|$|E
