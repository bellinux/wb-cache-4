25|$|The Bigfoot {{researchers}} {{say that no}} human can walk that way in the film. Oh, yes they can! When you're wearing long clown's feet, you can't place the ball of your foot down first. You have to put your foot down flat. Otherwise, you'll stumble. Another thing, when {{you put on the}} gorilla head, you can only turn your head maybe a quarter of the way. And to look behind you, you've got to turn your head and <b>your</b> <b>shoulders</b> and your hips. Plus, the shoulder pads in the suit are {{in the way of the}} jaw. That's why the Bigfoot turns and looks the way he does in the film. He has to twist his entire upper body.|$|E
500|$|There is an {{aesthetic}} focus on Béart's body, Julien telling Marie that [...] "I love your neck, your arms, <b>your</b> <b>shoulders,</b> your mouth, your stomach, your eyes -- I love everything." [...] The focus {{is more than}} erotic as it symbolises Marie's fight for corporeality. The film includes Rivette's first ever sex scenes, one of them arranged by Béart. The five candid and emotionally charged sex scenes focus on their upper bodies and faces, and on their erotic monologues that employ elements of fairy tale, horror, and sadomasochism.|$|E

When he received word about his election it was via telephone call from fellow Hall member Ted Williams. Upon hearing of Doby's election, Gene Mauch, said, [...] "You have {{to be some kind of}} special person to go through what Larry and Jackie Robinson went through. They both are.

500|$|... "Black & Blue" [...] {{received}} {{a positive response}} from music critics. John Bergstrom of PopMatters described it as [...] "smooth, winning blue-eyed soul", and Neil Ashman of Drowned in Sound commented that its breathy vocals, piano chords and synth backing made it a [...] "successful blend of melancholy and dancefloor-ready rhythms". Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian deemed the falsetto vocals and synths [...] "naggingly infectious", citing it as the band's strong point: [...] "the trio may be faceless, but they write a good tune". Sputnikmusic's staff reviewer Rudy Klapper felt that the [...] "techno swirl" [...] of the song [...] "nail the juxtaposition between Wyatt's moody lyrics and the irrepressible production". Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music rated [...] "Black & Blue" [...] four stars out of five and recommended it for when [...] "you just need something to lift the spirits a bit, without someone shouting something stupid in your ear". He continued, [...] "It basically wants to rub <b>your</b> <b>shoulders</b> {{at the end of}} a long hard day, and whisper something funny in your ear while <b>your</b> <b>shoulders</b> untie." [...] Natalie Kaye of Contactmusic.com said that although it begins melancholy, it [...] "swells to become one of the noisiest points on Miike Snow". Paul Mitchell of The Skinny felt that Wyatt channels Paddy McAloon's breathy vocal style on [...] "Black & Blue", but without the [...] "lyrical wit". He rated the song three stars out of five and called it [...] "decent", finding the remixes available on the release more interesting. A more critical review came from Pitchfork Media's Marc Hogan, who wrote that it [...] "promisingly... splits the difference between Prince and piano-pop, only to underwhelm as a whole".|$|E
500|$|Not all {{reviews of}} the season were positive. A.V.

He described the season as a [...] "weekly exercise in South Park schizophrenia", with some episodes faring better than others, although he said {{the first half of the}} season was generally strong. Josh Modell, also of the A.V. Club, agreed that the season was uneven, with several episodes [...] "you kinda shrugged <b>your</b> <b>shoulders</b> at", but others like [...] "Butters' Bottom Bitch" [...] that he found [...] "pretty damn funny".|$|E
500|$|After {{completing}} his Piano Sonata No. 3 (1973), [...] "a formidable piece of abstract composition" [...] according to Bowen, Tippett {{returned to the}} modern vernacular in his fourth opera The Ice Break (1976). Describing the music in {{an introduction to the}} published libretto, Tippett identifies [...] "two archetypal sounds: one relating to the frightening but exhilarating sound of the ice breaking on the great northern rivers in the spring; the other related to the exciting or terrifying sound of the slogan-shouting crowds, which can lift you on <b>your</b> <b>shoulders</b> in triumph, or stamp you to death". [...] Although the work was generally regarded as a critical and public failure, aspects of its music have been recognised as among Tippett's best. The critic John Warrack writes that, after the violence of the opening acts, the third act's music has a lyrical warmth comparable to that of The Midsummer Marriage". William Mann in The Times [...] was equally enthusiastic, finding the music compelling and worthy of many a rehearing.|$|E

500|$|Joey Thurmond of Push Square wrote how playing {{through the}} {{campaign}} from Modern Warfare {{reminded him of}} its sheer memorability and how it had long endured with fans compared with other games in the series, saying [...] "there's tension and gravity shot through the experience, {{as if the world}} is on <b>your</b> <b>shoulders</b> to push past every enemy line with explosive bravado or exacting stealth. [...] There's a grounded feel to player characters that make you another cog in the machine with the abilities and limitations of an ordinary soldier, not a supernatural saviour." [...] He praised the game's graphical enhancements, saying [...] "Modern Warfare Remastered looks and sounds like a fresh game on par with today's graphical and aural standards" [...] and calling it a [...] "ridiculously faithful remake", but wrote that the game still showed some slight signs of age, such as artificial intelligence problems and pacing issues. In short, he commended Raven Software [...] "for arguably delivering the most substantial, masterful remake we have ever experienced", and that [...] "Modern Warfare Remastered celebrates this legacy with updated visuals and sound that really go above and beyond the call of duty, sprucing up an old care package for a more modern age to near-perfection." ...|$|E
500|$|Either/Or portrays two life views. Each life view {{is written}} and {{represented}} by a fictional pseudonymous author, with the prose of the work reflecting and depending on the life view being discussed. For example, the aesthetic life view is written in short essay form, with poetic imagery and allusions, discussing aesthetic topics such as music, seduction, drama, and beauty. The ethical life view is written as two long letters, with a more argumentative and restrained prose, discussing moral responsibility, critical reflection, and marriage. The views of the book are not neatly summarized, but are expressed as lived experiences embodied by the pseudonymous authors. The book's central concern is the primal question asked by Aristotle, [...] "How should we live?" [...] His book was certainly informed by Epictetus; [...] "Consider first, man, what the matter is, and what your own nature is able to bear. If you would be a wrestler, consider <b>your</b> <b>shoulders,</b> your back, your thighs; for different persons are made for different things. Do {{you think that you}} can act as you do and be a philosopher, that you can eat, drink, be angry, be discontented, as you are now? You must watch, you must labor, you must get the better of certain appetites, must quit your acquaintances, be despised by your servant, be laughed at by those you meet; come off worse than others in everything—in offices, in honors, before tribunals. When you have fully considered all these things, approach, if you please—that is, if, by parting with them, you have a mind to purchase serenity, freedom, and tranquillity. If not, do not come hither; do not, like children, be now a philosopher, then a publican, then an orator, and then one of Caesar’s officers. These things are not consistent. You must be one man, either good or bad. You must cultivate either your own reason or else externals; apply yourself either to things within or without you—that is, be either a philosopher or one of the mob." [...] His motto comes from Plutarch, [...] "The deceived is wiser than one not deceived." ...|$|E

2500|$|A proper stance {{starts with}} your feet being aligned at the target, {{followed}} by your knees, hips and shoulders.
