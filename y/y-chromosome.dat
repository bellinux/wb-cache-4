5|$|Domestication is {{also studied}} {{by using the}} genetic {{material}} of present-day horses and comparing it with the genetic material present in the bones and teeth of horse remains found in archaeological and palaeological excavations. The variation in the genetic material shows that very few wild stallions contributed to the domestic horse, while many mares were part of early domesticated herds. This {{is reflected in the}} difference in genetic variation between the DNA that is passed on along the paternal, or sire line (<b>Y-chromosome)</b> versus that passed on along the maternal, or dam line (mitochondrial DNA). There are very low levels of <b>Y-chromosome</b> variability, but a great deal of genetic variation in mitochondrial DNA. There is also regional variation in mitochondrial DNA due to the inclusion of wild mares in domestic herds. Another characteristic of domestication is an increase in coat color variation. In horses, this increased dramatically between 5000 and 3000 BC.|$|E
5|$|However, {{mitochondrial}} DNA reflects {{only the}} history of the females in a population and so may not represent {{the history of}} the population as a whole. This can be partially overcome by the use of paternal genetic sequences, such as the non-recombining region of the <b>Y-chromosome.</b> In a broader sense, only studies that also include nuclear DNA can provide a comprehensive evolutionary history of a population.|$|E

Alexandre Colonna-Walewski (1810–1868), {{the son of}} {{his mistress}} Maria Walewska, although acknowledged by Walewska's husband, was also widely known to be his child, and the DNA of his direct male descendant {{has been used to}} help confirm Napoleon's <b>Y-chromosome</b> haplotype. He may have had further unacknowledged illegitimate offspring as well, such as Eugen Megerle von Mühlfeld by Emilie Victoria Kraus and Hélène Napoleone Bonaparte (1816–1907) by Albine de Montholon.|$|E
50|$|Outside Fennoscandia, {{distribution}} of Haplogroup I1-M253 is closely correlated {{with that of}} Haplogroup I2a2-M436; but among Scandinavians (including both Germanic and Uralic peoples of the region) nearly all the Haplogroup I-M170 <b>Y-chromosomes</b> are I1-M253. Another characteristic of the Scandinavian I1-M253 <b>Y-chromosomes</b> is their rather low haplotype diversity (STR diversity): {{a greater variety of}} Haplogroup I1-M253 <b>Y-chromosomes</b> has been found among the French and Italians, despite the much lower overall frequency of Haplogroup I1-M253 among the modern French and Italian populations.|$|R

5|$|No genetic {{studies to}} date have {{correlated}} these prehistoric remains to any modern breed. What has been studied are Y-chromosomes (Y-DNA) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) obtained from Exmoor ponies. The <b>Y-chromosome</b> is passed on through the male line, and worldwide shows very little genetic variation in horses, except for a second <b>Y-chromosome</b> haplotype found in China, suggesting that a very limited number of stallions contributed to the original genome of the domestic horse. The Exmoor pony shares this general <b>Y-chromosome</b> haplotype. In contrast, mitochondrial DNA is passed on though the female line, and shows far more variation than Y-DNA, indicating {{that a large number}} of wild mares from several regions have contributed to modern domestic breeds. Some mtDNA-haplotypes have been found in DNA samples obtained from wild horses in prehistoric deposits, while other mtDNA-haplotypes have only been found in domesticated horses, from both living individuals and archeological finds. The Exmoor pony has a high frequency of pre-domestication mtDNA-haplotypes, but these are also found in different breeds all around the world. Currently, for the British Isles, there are only three DNA archeological samples available, all from Ireland. Although wild horses were abundant after the last ice age, the lack of sufficient pre-domestication DNA samples makes it impossible to determine the contribution of the wild horses of the British Islands to modern breeds, including the Exmoor pony. A 1995 study of morphological characteristics, the outward appearance of organisms, indicated that the Exmoor, Pottock, and Tarpan have an extremely close resemblance; these breeds were consistently grouped together in the results from several analyses, with the Exmoor showing the closest relationship to the Tarpan of all the breeds studied, at 0.27; the next-closest breeds to the Tarpan were the Pottock and Merens, both with a genetic distance from the Tarpan of 0.47. The distance between the Exmoor and Pottock was 0.37, and between the Exmoor and Merens was 0.40; a significantly wider gap than the distance between the Exmoor and Tarpan.|$|E

25|$|Research {{published}} in 2003 on <b>Y-chromosome</b> marker variation, {{taken from a}} larger sample population and from more sites throughout Britain, came to a different conclusion.

Southern England, including Kent, had markedly lower frequencies of non-indigenous <b>Y-chromosome</b> markers than eastern England, where Danish Viking settlement is attested. However, the study could not distinguish between North German and Danish populations, thus the relative proportions of genetic input derived from the Anglo-Saxon settlements and later Danish Viking colonisation could not be ascertained.|$|E

40|$|Sorrel (Rumex acetosa L.) is {{dioecious}} model {{plant with}} heteromorphic sex chromosome system with 2 n= 12 +XX in females and 2 n= 12 +XY 1 Y 2 in males. Sex {{is determined by}} the X:autosome balance. The major sex determining genes locate on X-chromosomes and the <b>Y-chromosomes</b> are not required for sex expression. <b>Y-chromosomes,</b> which contain genes for pollen fertility, constitute 26 % of male genome but the structure and functions of the Ys are largely unknown. AFLP using Mse I/ Pst I digestion reveals very low levels of male specific markers in R. acetosa and related species. Fifteen primer-combinations tested in R. acetosa generated 1085 bands, 4 of which were male specific. Two male associated DNA fragments, MADR 1 (583 bp) and MADR 2 (133 bp), were isolated and sequenced. These sequences show similarity to short stretches (up to 20 - 30 bp) of known sequences from several organisms. The deduced amino acid sequence of MADR 1 showed similarity to phosphatase genes from Arabidopsis thaliana, while MADR 2 showed similarity to retroelement sequences. The generation of very few male specific AFLP markers and their sequence similarity to the stretches of human DNA from autosomes and both the X and <b>Y-chromosomes</b> indicate the likely origin of the Ys from the X-chromosome...|$|R
