First released to developers at the 2000 Professional Developers Conference in Orlando, Florida, then {{made available for}} download, version 5.5 focused on improved print preview capabilities, CSS and HTML standards support, and developer APIs; this version was bundled with Windows Me. Version 5.5 also includes support for 128-bit encryption. Although {{it is no longer}} available for download from Microsoft directly it can also be installed with MSN Explorer 6.0 as msnsetup_full.exe. The full version of MSN Explorer can be downloaded only if you use Windows 95, Windows NT 4.0, Windows 98, Windows 98 SE and Windows 2000 if Internet Explorer 5.5 has not yet been installed. The full version will work on also Windows ME and Windows XP but you will need to download it on Windows 2000 or earlier and transfer the setup file to the newer operating system. If <b>you</b> <b>still</b> <b>want</b> to download it on a newer operating system the only way is to use an outdated web browser such as Netscape 4.8.|$|E
500|$|During the April 22 {{broadcast}} of Comedy Central's The Daily Show, host Jon Stewart {{responded to the}} censorship of [...] "201" [...] with a ten-minute monologue about the death threats, expressing disgust toward Revolution Muslim, culminating with a song telling Revolution Muslim to [...] "go fuck [...] ". Stewart criticized Comedy Central's decision to alter the episode, while simultaneously acknowledging they likely did so to protect their employees from [...] "possible harmful repercussions". Bill Maher, host of the HBO talk show Real Time with Bill Maher, said the threats against [...] "201" [...] demonstrated {{the importance of the}} First Amendment and other American civil liberties, and said, [...] "When South Park got threatened last week by Islamists incensed at their depiction of Muhammad, it served—or should serve—as a reminder that our culture isn't just different than one that makes death threats to cartoonists. It's better." [...] He added jokingly, [...] "If you don't get that, and <b>you</b> <b>still</b> <b>want</b> to kill someone over a stupid cartoon, please make it Garfield." ...|$|E
500|$|Though Reitman {{has claimed}} in countless {{interviews}} {{that he wrote}} the parts specifically for George Clooney, Vera Farmiga, Anna Kendrick, Jason Bateman, Danny McBride, Melanie Lynskey, Amy Morton, Sam Elliott and Zach Galifianakis, some of the actors publicly stated their confusion in Reitman's assertion, if only because they knew he was meeting with other actors all along including his choice to fill his last lead role with Ellen Page (who starred in Reitman's previous film Juno) for the part that Kendrick ultimately played. On the part played by Farmiga, he cited her ability to walk {{a fine line between}} aggressiveness and femininity. On Kendrick, Reitman cited that he was inspired by her performance in Rocket Science. On Clooney, he said, [...] "If you're going to make a movie about a guy who fires people for a living and <b>you</b> <b>still</b> <b>want</b> to like him, that actor better be damn charming and I don't think there's a more charming actor alive than George Clooney. I was very lucky he said yes." [...] Reitman said, on the B.S. Report with Bill Simmons, that he considered Steve Martin for the part if Clooney declined the role. Reitman said that he would have changed the movie with Martin and given Martin [...] "his Lost in Translation." ...|$|E

50|$|What Southport {{is famous}} for is the shit and the piss throwing. Because the inmates {{have no access to}} each other, what they do is fill cups up with shit and piss and throw it at each other.

5000|$|The lyrics {{speak of}} a young, {{hesitant}} romance that is ultimately more self-centered and defensive than caring, capturing the subtle insecurities of teenage love. Billboard felt that the lyrical content of [...] "Let's Not Fall in Love" [...] encompasses [...] "the scary moments that accompany {{the start of a}} relationship", depicting [...] "the pressures and worries of starting a new relationship and committing to a person, and the potential pain that accompanies the risk of opening up to someone."

40|$|This is {{the most}} {{important}} chapter of this book. In this chapter, we cover all the nuances the programmer should know when porting an existing CGI script to work under mod_perl, or when writing one from scratch. This chapter’s main goal is to teach the reader how to think in mod_perl. It involves showing most of the mod_perl peculiarities and possible traps the programmer might fall into. It also shows you {{some of the things that}} are impossible with vanilla CGI but easily done with mod_perl. Before You Start to Code There are three important things you need to know before you start your journey in a mod_perl world: how to access mod_perl and related documentation, and how to develop your Perl code when the strict and warnings modes are enabled. Accessing Documentation mod_perl doesn’t tolerate sloppy programming. Although we’re confident that you’re a talented, meticulously careful programmer whose programs run perfectly every time, <b>you</b> <b>still</b> might <b>want</b> to tighten up some of your Perl programming practices. In this chapter, we include discussions that rely on prior knowledge of some areas of Perl, and we provide short refreshers where necessary. We assume that you can already program in Perl and that you are comfortable with finding Perl-related infor-mation in books and Perl documentation. There are many Perl books that you may find helpful. We list some of these in the reference sections at the end of each chapter. If you prefer the documentation that comes with Perl, you can use either its online version (start a...|$|R
