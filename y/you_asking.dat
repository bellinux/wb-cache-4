500|$|At the October 30, 2007 {{debate in}} Philadelphia and the November 15 debate in Las Vegas, Biden was noted for some one-liners that drew some {{laughter}} from the audience. First, when speaking about Rudy Giuliani at the Philadelphia debate, Biden stated, [...] "There's only three things he mentions in a sentence: a noun, and a verb and 9/11." [...] At the Las Vegas debate Biden seemed to attack all his opponents when he stated, [...] "I know there's more to say, Campbell. I appreciate <b>you</b> <b>asking</b> me the question and I'm sorry I answered it. I know you're not supposed to answer questions, based on what I've heard." ...|$|E
500|$|Film critic Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film {{four out of}} four stars and called it [...] "a {{wonderful}} film." [...] The Hollywood Reporter lauded the film as [...] "Winsome, touching and arguably the funniest Pixar effort ever, this gorgeously rendered, high-flying adventure is a tidy 90-minute distillation of all the signature touches that came before it." [...] Although the San Francisco Chronicle noted that the film [...] "contains many boring stretches of mindless freneticism and bland character interaction," [...] it also declared that there are scenes in Up of [...] "such beauty, economy and poetic wisdom that they belong in any anthology of great movie moments...to watch Up with any attention is to be moved and astonished by the economy with which specific visuals are invested with emotion throughout ..." [...] Variety enthused that [...] "Up is an exceptionally refined picture; unlike so many animated films, it's not all about sensory bombardment and volume...Unsurprisingly, no one puts a foot wrong here. Vocal performances...exude a warm enthusiasm, and tech specifications could not be better. Michel Giacchino's full-bodied, traditional score is superlative..." [...] The Globe and Mail stated that Up is [...] "the kind of movie that leaves <b>you</b> <b>asking</b> 'How do people {{come up with this}} stuff?'" [...] along with an overall positive review on the film, despite it being predictable.|$|E
500|$|Metacritic {{gave the}} season a Metascore—a {{weighted}} average {{based on the}} impressions of a select fifteen critical reviews—of 81, signifying [...] "universal acclaim". James Poniewozik of Time labeled the series {{as one of the}} six best dramas on television. He praised Bell as [...] "a captivating star," [...] and said that the series [...] "uses its pulp premise to dramatize a universal teen experience: that growing up means sleuthing out the mystery of who you really are." [...] Kay McFadden of The Seattle Times called Veronica Mars an update to the [...] "classic California film noir". She felt that Veronica Mars was the best new series on UPN, and that the title character was potentially [...] "this season's most interesting character creation". McFadden described the series as [...] "Alias in its attitude, Raymond Chandler in its writing and The O.C. in its class-consciousness." [...] James South of Paste praised the [...] "crisp, clever writing", and noted the supporting characters were more than just plot devices. He commended Bell's portrayal of Veronica as [...] "simultaneously smart, vulnerable, tough and injured", and found the guest stars were well-utilized. South wrote the remaining cast was [...] "uniformly good", but gave Dohring a special mention for his acting. Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com praised the first-season finale for being [...] "just the sort of satisfying capper you look for in a series that, week after week, keeps <b>you</b> <b>asking</b> questions".|$|E

500|$|Although not a ratings success, {{the series}} was a {{critical}} success from its first season. Robert Abele of LA Weekly said [...] "in this smart, engaging series about a former popular girl turned crime-solving high school outcast, the hard-boiled dialogue comes from its teen protagonist's mouth {{in a way that}} stabs any potential cutesiness in the heart with an ice pick." [...] In her review, Paige Wiser of the Chicago Sun Times said that [...] "on Veronica Mars, wholesome is out; gritty reality is in. The show never soft-pedals the timeless, fundamental truth that high school is hell." [...] Joyce Millman of The Phoenix felt that {{the series was}} [...] "a character study masquerading as a high-school drama". Joy Press of The Village Voice saw the series as [...] "a sharp teen noir in the making. Tinged with class resentment and nostalgia for Veronica's lost innocence, this series pulses with promise." [...] Michael Abernethy of PopMatters said that [...] "intrigue, drama, and humor, Veronica Mars is also a lesson book for the disenfranchised. Few TV series aim so high; even fewer succeed so well." [...] James Poniewozik of Time labeled it as one of the six best dramas on television. He praised Bell as [...] "a captivating star", and said that the series [...] "uses its pulp premise to dramatize a universal teen experience: that growing up means sleuthing out the mystery of who you really are."

2500|$|According to {{an article}} from The New York Times, [...] "over the years, Frazier has lost a fortune through a {{combination}} of his own generosity and naïveté, his carousing, and failed business opportunities. The other headliners from his fighting days—Ali, George Foreman, and Larry Holmes—are millionaires." [...] Asked about his situation, Frazier became playfully defensive, but would not reveal his financial status. [...] "Are <b>you</b> <b>asking</b> me how much money I have?" [...] he said. [...] "I got plenty of money. I got a stack of $100 bills rolled up over there {{in the back of the}} room." [...] Frazier blamed himself, partly, for not effectively promoting his own image. [...] In a 2006 HBO documentary on the fight in Manila, Frazier was interviewed living in a one-room apartment on the second floor of his gym.|$|E

2500|$|Later, after Zhong Hui {{secretly}} accused Deng Ai {{of plotting}} a rebellion, Sima Zhao wanted {{to lead his}} forces to station at Chang'an. Shao Ti told Sima Zhao {{that there was no}} need for him to go to Chang'an because Zhong Hui was capable of arresting Deng Ai on his own since he had five to six times more troops than Deng Ai. Sima Zhao replied, [...] "Have you forgotten what you said previously? Why are <b>you</b> <b>asking</b> me not to go (to Chang'an) now? Please keep secret what we spoke about. I treat people with trust and respect. As long as they remain loyal to me, I will not doubt them. Jia Chong recently asked me, 'Are you suspicious of Zhong Hui?' I replied, 'If I send you on a mission today, do you think I doubt you?' He could not respond to my reply. Everything will be settled when I arrive in Chang'an." [...] By the time Sima Zhao reached Chang'an, Zhong Hui had already been killed in the mutiny, just as Sima Zhao foresaw.|$|E
2500|$|The {{group that}} most {{characterized}} London streets were beggars and vagrants. The broad eighteenth-century definition for beggar embraced {{not just the}} poorest people having {{to live on the}} street, but virtually anyone who would stop <b>you</b> <b>asking</b> for money, work, or offering you a service such as: shoe cleaners, linkboys, milkmaids, chimney sweeps, etc. Begging was quite an art, the way you held your body, the sores you showed or not showed, the tone of the voice, your gender and age, the time of the year, the narrative strategies you decided to adopt, all these elements affected the way you begged and had to be consider carefully. Moreton regards beggars and vagrants as potential criminals in disguise and affirms that they [...] "should be suppressed, who lounge about all day, to see where they can steal at night" [...] and that [...] "all shoe-cleaners, I mean boys and sturdy vagrants, be suppressed, [...] as for link-boys, alias thieves with lights". Shoeblacks are a peculiar example of a vagrant occupation. Established as an employment {{at the end of the}} seventeenth-century, shoe cleaning provided a perfect excuse for approaching passers-by without incurring a penalty.|$|E
2500|$|The {{historical}} text Han Jin Chunqiu {{mentioned that}} Cao Rui had all along {{been aware of}} his mother's fate, and he was angry and sad about it. After he became emperor, his stepmother Guo Nüwang became the empress dowager. When he asked her about how his mother died, Guo replied, [...] "The Late Emperor {{was the one who}} ordered her death, so why are <b>you</b> <b>asking</b> me? You're your father's son so you can blame your dead father. Are you going to kill your stepmother for your real mother?" [...] Cao Rui turned furious and forced Empress Dowager Guo to commit suicide. He had her buried with the funeral rites befitting that of an empress, but also ordered her dead body to be treated {{in the same manner as}} she did to his mother – hair covering face, mouth stuffed with rice husks. However, the historical text Weilüe stated that after Empress Dowager Guo died of illness in 235, Cao Pi's concubine Lady Li (李夫人) told Cao Rui about the fate of his mother. Cao Rui was deeply grieved and he ordered Guo's dead body to be treated in the same manner as she did to his mother.|$|E

2500|$|Stinkoman 20X6 (abbreviated to 20X6; {{pronounced}} [...] "twenty exty-six"), {{a parody}} of the Mega Man and EarthBound games' [...] "year 200X", originated from Strong Bad Email #57, japanese cartoon, an email asking Strong Bad what he would look like {{if he were in}} a Japanese anime. The main character, Stinkoman, is an anime version of Strong Bad with blue hair, a shiny body and robot boots. He is always looking for a fight, asking various characters he interacts with to engage him in a [...] "challenge" [...] ("Are <b>you</b> <b>asking</b> for a challenge?"). The characters in 20X6 cartoons each have a counterpart in the Homestar Runner universe, and their features are {{a parody of}} anime and Japanese video game stereotypes. The game of the same name was heavily based on the Mega Man series, particularly the first 6 levels. Stinkoman's name comes from a conversation Homestar Runner and Strong Bad had while marooned on a desert island. Strong Bad created Stinkoman by applying several anime stereotypes (head shaped like a little bean, big shiny eyes, shiny body, mouth that is tiny when closed and huge when opened, blue hair, and robot boots) to his own appearance.|$|E
