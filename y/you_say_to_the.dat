2500|$|Obama {{communications}} aide Robert Gibbs, who {{had worked}} for Kerry's campaign, recommended Favreau to Obama as an excellent writer, and in 2005 he began working for Barack Obama in his United States Senate office, before joining Obama's presidential campaign as chief speechwriter in 2006. His interview with Obama was on the Senator's first day. Uninterested in Favreau's résumé, Obama instead questioned Favreau on what motivated him to work in politics, and what his theory of writing was. He described this theory to Obama as, [...] "A speech can broaden the circle of people who care about this stuff. How do <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> average person that's been hurting: 'I hear you, I'm there?' Even though you've been so disappointed and cynical about politics in the past, and with good reason, we can move in the right direction. Just give me a chance." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Be {{careful what}} <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Nome King," [...] warned the Wizard. [...] "He {{has a bad}} temper and the least little thing makes him angry." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What do <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> youngster, old man?" [...] said Thrummings, {{holding up}} his lantern into his comrade's {{wrinkled}} face, as if deciphering some ancient parchment.|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{why have}} you done it at all? Why have you mixed your name up in {{anything}} so ridiculous? What was it <b>you</b> did <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> archbishop?" ...|$|R
50|$|Carrion <b>you</b> devour, <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> least.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are a {{positive}} wizard, Major Selby," [...] she said archly. [...] "What have <b>you</b> been <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> poor boy <b>to</b> cheer him up so? He {{has a bad}} headache this morning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Shall I put it more plainly?" [...] {{continued}} Captain Wragge. [...] "What do <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> universally-accepted maxim that 'all stratagems {{are fair}} {{in love and}} war'?--Yes or No?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Remember, {{that she}} has her {{attachment}} to plead in her excuse; but dare <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> world that you still remember, with gentle feelings, the man whom you stigmatize with such opprobrious epithets?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear Poirot, I am {{sure you}} are capable of {{thinking}} of seventy! But, seriously, {{in spite of what}} I heard <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> detectives, you surely cannot still believe in the possibility of Alfred Inglethorp's innocence?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you would}} {{speak with the}} King at all," [...] said the thrall, [...] "the less <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> him <b>the</b> better, for he is {{in no mood to}} be troubled just now. He sets out for the Springs to-morrow morning." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Was {{that what}} <b>you</b> were <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tree?" [...] asked the Egyptian, demurely. Then, perhaps {{thinking}} it wisest not to press this point, she continued irrelevantly, [...] "It seems such a pity {{that you are}} a minister." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I heard <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cop {{that you}} lived here, so I came along {{to tell your}} folks what had happened, {{so that they could}} do something. The maid said that your uncle was {{expected}} any minute, so I waited." ...|$|E

6000|$|BURGE [shining at her] Of {{course they}} do. Come! let me prove {{to you what}} we think of you. Shall we find you a first-rate {{constituency}} to contest at the next election?

6000|$|... "You'll soon get posted up," [...] Mr. Henneford declared. [...] "I can see you've got a {{quick way}} of dealing with things. So long till five o'clock, then. There's a dozen chaps waiting down-stairs to see you. We'll leave it to your {{judgment}} just what <b>you</b> want <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Press. Ring the bell and have the waiter bring their cards up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, there's {{just enough}} truth in what <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> <b>to</b> make <b>the</b> remark unbearable.

6000|$|... "Does he?" [...] {{retorted}} Haney.

Owning a paying mine has not changed me heart to a stone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{it seems}} to me that you are arguing against yourself, Hilda. Everything <b>you</b> <b>say</b> points <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fact that this man is the John Simcoe he claims to be. If he is not Simcoe, who can he be?" ...|$|R

60|$|Fairy me tribber is what <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fairies {{when you}} want them to give you a cup of tea, but it is not so easy as it looks, for all the r's should be {{pronounced}} as w's, and I forget this so often that David believes I should find difficulty in making myself understood.|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{you don't}} {{want to be}} a parson," [...] said the General, [...] "and with your father's example before your eyes, I am sure I don't wonder.
