5000|$|... “We cannot {{leave our}} {{discussion}} of the Psalms without referring to that one feature of them which is perhaps the greatest stumbling block to the modern reader: Imprecations, such as those we read in Psalms 68 (69) and 108 (109), and the appalling simplicity of Psalm 136 (137): “Happy the man who shall seize <b>your</b> <b>little</b> <b>ones</b> and dash them against the rock.” However the Hebrews may have felt about their Babylonian conquerors, we are not edified by a prayer that another conqueror may dash out the brains of Babylonian infants. Many are the expressions of dissatisfaction with such utterances, and many the attempts to rationalize them…Now Christians, like unbelievers, rarely turn the other cheek; when evil threatens their lives, their country, their goods the defend themselves with violence, as they feel morally free to do; {{they believe that they}} may, within the limits of Christian charity, desire that others suffer evil and inflict evil themselves upon others. We Christian are not, perhaps, so spiritually advanced beyond the ancient Hebrews as we sometimes like to think.” The Two-Edged Sword, pages 283-284.|$|R

6000|$|And {{it came to}} {{pass that}} Jesus spake unto them, and bade them arise. [...] And they arose from the earth, and He said unto them, Blessed are ye [...] because of your faith.

5000|$|Similarly, a Midrash {{taught that}} the Reubenites and the Gadites {{cherished}} their property more than human life, putting their cattle before their {{children when they}} told Moses in [...] "We will build sheepfolds here for our cattle, and cities for our little ones." [...] Moses told them that their priorities were wrong {{and that they should}} rather do the more important things first, when Moses told them in [...] "Build you cities for <b>your</b> <b>little</b> <b>ones,</b> and folds for your sheep." [...] The Midrash saw in their different priorities application of the words of [...] "A wise man's understanding is at his right hand" [...] — applying to Moses — and [...] "A fool's understanding at his left" [...] — applying to the Reubenites and the Gadites. God told the Reubenites and the Gadites that as they showed greater love for their cattle than for human souls, there would be no blessing in it for them. The Midrash thus saw in their fate application of the words of [...] "An estate may be gotten hastily at the beginning; but the end thereof shall not be blessed," [...] and the words of [...] "Do not weary yourself to be rich; cease from your own wisdom." ...|$|R

40|$|Evidence-based library {{practice}} {{is not so}} simple when the research is just emerging. For years we’ve advised families to limit children’s screen time, based on guidelines rooted in television research. Today’s touchscreen devices provide very different opportunities for families. These devices are so new, we don’t yet have {{a body of research}} to support best practices, leaving families with conflicting messages about appropriate media use. At VPL, we developed programs about using touchscreen apps to support children in developing early literacy skills, and in creating, interacting, and learning. Apps for <b>Your</b> <b>Little</b> <b>Ones</b> and Apps for Your School-Age Kid are programs for parents and caregivers focusing on how to use apps. Instead of a list of recommended apps, we walk parents through the practical aspects of sharing or encouraging positive app use. We talk about apps in the context of family activities – how they can be tools for early literacy and facilitate creativity. We show how apps can have a role in talking, singing, reading, writing, and playing with children, and how apps can give older children opportunities to create, socialise, and discover. We will describe the rational, content, and practical aspects of these programs, our experiences delivering them to different communities, and the lessons we learned. We will demo some of the apps we explored with our parents. We will give you the materials to take and adapt this program for your community. Let’s look beyond outdated media guidelines and ask how our families are really using technology...|$|R

If you really believe that He is the sworn enemy of all misery and disease, you will show yourselves too the sworn enemies of everything that causes misery and disease, and work together like men to put all pestilential filth and damp out of this parish.
