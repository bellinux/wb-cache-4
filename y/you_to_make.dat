If you insist on having a system of eternal and immutable 'truth,' you can get it only by abstracting from those characteristics of reality, which we try to express by the terms individuality, time, and change. But you must pay the price for a formula that will enable <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> assertions that hold good far beyond the limits of your experience.

[...] Fraser McAlpine of the BBC compared the song's message to that of the German fairy tale [...] "Rapunzel"; Rihanna is not willing to throw her hair out of the castle for just any man to come and satisfy her, [...] "particularly not someone who isn't prepared to make the climb up to her scarily high window." ...|$|E

The Japanese board of directors initially disapproved of the plan, but all four points were approved by Nakayama, who told Kalinske, [...] "I hired <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the decisions for Europe and the Americas, so go ahead and do it."

[...] Nintendo's console debuted against an established competitor, while NEC's TurboGrafx-16 failed to gain traction, and NEC soon pulled out of the market. [...] In large part due to the popularity of Sonic the Hedgehog, the Sega Genesis outsold the SNES in the United States nearly two to one during the 1991 holiday season. This success led to Sega having control of 65% of the 16-bit console market in January 1992, making it the first time Nintendo was not the console leader since December 1985.|$|E

The soothing track starts off with Blige singing with a dark voice, [...] "So {{you think you know}} how to love a woman/ But I think it's still some things you need to know." [...] As the flowery instrumental builds with a serene piano melody and accentuating horns, Blige goes on to warn that a woman needs more than material things. A writer of Billboard magazine further noted that the song was schooling men on just how good to love a woman. During her lines, Beyoncé sings with a vibrato voice, [...] "A woman / Needs <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> love to her / She needs more than sex / Oh, a real woman needs a real man / They don’t talk about it, be about it / Put that work in, still shows his woman real romance". According to Rob Markman of MTV News, [...] "From there, the song plays as a lyrical how-to. Communication is a must, as is respect, but coming home late and being a one-minute man is a no-no." [...] Writers further noted that the duet was inspired by the music from the 1990s including a new jack swing-era R production. Beyoncé and Blige further sing the lines [...] "She doesn’t want makeup sex, she wants your respect." [...] The song also has an extended bridge section during the 2:30 mark where Blige sings the lines [...] "Pick up your phone…just to say you're still in love from time to time…" [...] with a vocal styling which was compared to Michael Jackson's [...] "Off the Wall" [...] era. It ends with the sound of sparkler synths.Jada Gomez-Lacayo of HipHopDx compared the song with Aaron Hall's material. Ayanna Guyhto of Yahoo! Music compared the first minute of the song with Busta Rhymes' songs due to the speedy wordplay. She further noted that it was similar to the songs by Keith Sweat from the 1990s.|$|E
500|$|Deprived of {{political}} power, Oppenheimer continued to lecture, write {{and work on}} physics. He toured Europe and Japan, giving talks {{about the history of}} science, the role of science in society, {{and the nature of the}} universe. In September 1957, France made him an Officer of the Legion of Honor, and on May 3, 1962, he was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society in Britain. At the urging of many of Oppenheimer's political friends who had ascended to power, President John F. Kennedy awarded Oppenheimer the Enrico Fermi Award in 1963 as a gesture {{of political}} rehabilitation. Edward Teller, the winner of the previous year's award, had also recommended Oppenheimer receive it, in the hope that it would heal the rift between them. A little over a week after Kennedy's assassination, his successor, President Lyndon Johnson, presented Oppenheimer with the award, [...] "for contributions to theoretical physics as a teacher and originator of ideas, and for leadership of the Los Alamos Laboratory and the atomic energy program during critical years". Oppenheimer told Johnson: [...] "I think it is just possible, Mr. President, that it has taken some charity and some courage for <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> this award today." [...] The rehabilitation implied by the award was partly symbolic, as Oppenheimer still lacked a security clearance and could have no effect on official policy, but the award came with a $50,000 tax-free stipend, and its award outraged many prominent Republicans in Congress. The late President Kennedy's widow Jacqueline, still living in the White House, made it a point to meet with Oppenheimer to tell him how much her husband had wanted him to have the medal. While still a senator in 1959, Kennedy had been instrumental in voting to narrowly deny Oppenheimer's enemy Lewis Strauss a coveted government position as Secretary of Commerce, effectively ending Strauss' political career. This was partly due to lobbying by the scientific community on behalf of Oppenheimer.|$|E
