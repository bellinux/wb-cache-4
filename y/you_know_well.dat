2500|$|At about 17:30 Mohammed Zaki, Leader of Republic Guards, joined Morsi {{with some}} of the Republic Guards {{officers}} and conducted the arrest. It was reported from Morsi's assistant Yahya Hamed the flow of conversation took place as Morsi saying [...] "Mohammed (Leader of Republic Guards) <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>well</b> {{you are going to be}} trailed for that." [...] and Mohammed Zaki replying: [...] "I know, however I had already told them I don't want in, because of my special good relations with the president." ...|$|E
2500|$|This {{little way}} of Therese is the {{foundation}} of her spirituality. [...] Within the Catholic Church Thérèse's way was known for some time as [...] "the little way of spiritual childhood," [...] but Thérèse actually wrote [...] "little way" [...] only three times, and she never wrote the phrase [...] "spiritual childhood." [...] It was her sister Pauline who, after Thérèse's death, adopted the phrase [...] "the little way of spiritual childhood" [...] to interpret Thérèse's path. Years after Thérèse's death, a Carmelite of Lisieux asked Pauline about this phrase and Pauline answered spontaneously [...] "But <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>well</b> that Thérèse never used it! It is mine." [...] In May 1897, Thérèse wrote to Father Adolphe Roulland, [...] "My way is all confidence and love." [...] To Maurice Bellière she wrote, [...] "and I, with my way, will do more than you, so I hope that one day Jesus will make you walk by the same way as me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Failures in {{both the}} East and the West began a tide of events that was to {{overwhelm}} Asquith's Liberal Government. Strategic setbacks combined with a shattering personal blow when, on 12 May 1915, Venetia Stanley announced her engagement to Edwin Montagu. Asquith's reply was immediate and brief, [...] "As <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>well,</b> this breaks my heart. I couldn't bear {{to come and see}} you. I can only pray God to bless you—and help me." [...] Venetia's importance to him is illustrated by a letter written in mid-1914; [...] "Keep close to me beloved in this most critical time of my life. I know you will not fail." [...] Her engagement; [...] "a very treacherous return after all the joy you've given me", left him devastated. Significant though the loss was personally, its impact on Asquith politically can be overstated. The historian Stephen Koss notes that Asquith [...] "was always able to divide his public and private lives into separate compartments (and) soon found new confidantes to whom he was writing with no less frequency, ardour and indiscretion." ...|$|E
