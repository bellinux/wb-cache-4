500|$|... "I Will Be" [...] is a {{piano and}} guitar led song, which lasts for a {{duration}} of 3 minutes, 58 seconds. The song was composed {{in the key}} of G major using common time and a slow groove at 72beats per minute. Lewis's vocal range spans two octaves, from the low note of B3 to the high note of B5, on the song. The song opens with the lyrics [...] "There's nothing I could say to <b>you,</b> <b>nothing</b> I could ever do to make you {{see what you mean}} to me." [...] Chad Grischow for IGN described the song's piano led instrumental to be [...] "overblown", but noted that Lewis has enough [...] "vocal strength to prevent her from being overshadowed by the drowningly lush sound." [...] Eric R. Danton wrote on his review of Spirit for the Hartford Courant daily that [...] "I Will Be" [...] begins with a [...] "spare piano introduction" [...] that [...] "blossoms into an arrangement buoyed by strings and then drums and guitar". Danton described Lewis's vocals as [...] "delicate" [...] and that [...] "take flight on the chorus".|$|E
500|$|As {{a result}} of {{repeated}} racial bigotry, Russell refused to respond to fan acclaim or friendship from his neighbors, thinking it was insincere and hypocritical. This attitude contributed to his legendarily bad rapport with fans and journalists. He alienated Celtics fans by saying, [...] "You owe the public the same it owes <b>you,</b> <b>nothing!</b> I refuse to smile and be nice to the kiddies." [...] This supported the opinion of many white fans that Russell (who was by then the highest-paid Celtic) was egotistical, paranoid and hypocritical. The already hostile atmosphere between Russell and Boston hit its apex when vandals broke into his house, covered the walls with racist graffiti, damaged his trophies and defecated in the beds. In response, Russell described Boston as a [...] "flea market of racism". In King Of The Court by Aram Goudsouzian, he was quoted saying, [...] "From my very first year I {{thought of myself as}} playing for the Celtics, not for Boston. The fans could do or think whatever they wanted." [...] Referring to a time when the Celtics could not sell out the Boston Garden despite hockey’s popularity in the same stadium, Russell recalled “We [...] did a survey about what we could do to improve attendance. Over 50 percent of responses said 'There’s too many black players.'” In retirement, Russell described the Boston press as corrupt and racist; in response, Boston sports journalist Larry Claflin claimed that Russell himself was the real racist.|$|E

2500|$|CBS and Warner Bros. {{terminated}} Sheen's {{contract on}} March 7, 2011. He {{was replaced by}} Ashton Kutcher. In the aftermath of his dismissal, Sheen remained vocally critical of Chuck Lorre, and filed a wrongful termination lawsuit against Lorre and Warner Bros., which was settled the following September 26. That same month, Sheen, while presenting an award at the Primetime Emmy Awards, addressed [...] "everybody here from Two and a Half Men" [...] and stated, [...] "From {{the bottom of my}} heart, I wish <b>you</b> <b>nothing</b> but the best for this upcoming season.

As far as {{the second half of the}} 19th century, this word can be found used several times to represent a feast in a short story called [...] "La mulata de rumbo", from the Cuban folklorist Francisco de Paula Gelabert: [...] "...I have more enjoyment and fun in a rumbita with those of my color and class...", or [...] " [...] Leocadia was going to bed, as I was telling <b>you,</b> <b>nothing</b> less than at twelve noon, when one of his friends from the rumbas arrived, along with another young man that he wanted to introduce to her…" [...] According to Alejo Carpentier [...] "…it is significant that the word rumba have passed to the Cuban language as a synonym of holgorio, lewd dance, merrymaking with low class women (mujeres del rumbo)." ...|$|E
