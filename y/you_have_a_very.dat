500|$|Specter then {{introduced}} legislation in April 2010 {{to amend the}} federal Wiretap Act to clarify that {{it is illegal to}} capture silent visual images inside another person's home. He said: [...] "This is going to become law. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> significant invasion of privacy with these webcams, as more information is coming to light." [...] Speaking {{on the floor of the}} Senate, he said: ...|$|E
500|$|The company's {{independence}} was maintained after Whitbread {{acted as a}} white knight by raising its {{stake in the company}} from 13 to 23 per cent, and the family and many small shareholders refused to sell their stakes. The chairman of Whitbread, Colonel Whitbread, is reputed to have said, [...] "You are a very old firm. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> good name. You mustn't go out." [...] At the time, it was rare for a company to win the emotional argument for independence, {{and it was the first}} time a regional brewery had headed off an offer from a national company. In 1970, Charles Boddington retired and his son Ewart assumed the directorship.|$|E
2500|$|In 1997, {{one of the}} {{international}} alpine skiing classifiers was Mirre Kipfer. [...] She said [...] "Sometimes athletes try to cheat, to hide what they can really do. [...] They are athletes {{who want to be}} in a class [...] that is more advantageous to for them. [...] In testing and classification they don't show what they can really do. [...] They try to show that they are not able to do some movement, and that is why we have started functional testing." [...] She goes on to say [...] "The second problem is that when <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> good athlete who is very well trained in the sport, you don't want to punish that person for their good performance. [...] He or she might be an elite athlete doing a very good sport performance, and you might be tempted to say 'OK, he is doing so well he must be in another class.' We do try to get fewer classes so that we don't get, for example, 10 or 12 gold medals in alpine sports. [...] We try to review the classes, but you always have borderline classes and it is always difficult. [...] In winter the aim is to have three classes, like sitting, standing and blind: that is certainly the future that we are all looking to." ...|$|E
6000|$|Lady Olive {{looked at}} him a little curiously as she took the seat at his left, hers by unspoken consent as his fianc√©e. [...] "My dear Stirling," [...] she whispered, [...] "have <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> trying morning? <b>You</b> look somehow as though <b>you</b> <b>had</b> been worried." ...|$|R
60|$|GREAT-HEART. I {{perceive}} {{you knew}} him; for <b>you</b> <b>have</b> given <b>a</b> <b>very</b> right character of him.|$|R
5000|$|Voice: Most of {{the female}} {{characters}} <b>you</b> encounter <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> calm voice, though {{it depends on the}} situation.|$|R
60|$|MISS P.--Well, no; I don't think <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> bad temper, Mr. Milliken, a--Horace.|$|E
60|$|Paul Ruttledge. I'm afraid <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> bad {{opinion of}} me, Charlie. Well, maybe I earned it.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not this time, my dear. He is coming, but we {{have been}} talking you over. Ave, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> young doctor, and rather too much interested.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here it is," [...] said Mr. Lee, as {{they stopped}} at a store where then were two huge windows filled with mirrors of all sizes. [...] "Now which one will <b>you</b> <b>have?</b> Not <b>a</b> <b>very</b> large one for such <b>a</b> <b>very</b> little lady. But there is a nice little one that will just suit <b>you,</b> and it <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> pretty frame." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I understand, Captain Joyce," [...] {{said the}} general, [...] "that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> allowed <b>a</b> <b>very</b> {{important}} prisoner to slip through your fingers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Truly, <b>you</b> must <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> high {{opinion of}} me, Mr Rokesmith, when {{you believe that}} in {{prosperity}} I neglect and forget my old home.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In that case," [...] Nigel pointed out, [...] "if {{you will}} {{permit me to}} make a suggestion, sir, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> simple course open to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no; {{make him}} eat pap {{with a wooden}} spoon, like a Kafir," [...] said another. [...] "I will feed him--if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> long spoon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{ask you to}} dine with us quietly some time, but mind, {{you come}} at your own risk; don't blame me if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> dull evening." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And the DEAREST? Well, <b>you</b> will <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> lady-like {{wardrobe}} {{with one}} pocket-handkerchief in it! I wonder {{you do not}} purchase a single shoe." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Arthur"--with {{a little}} stamp--"I am ashamed of you. How {{can you think}} such things of me? <b>You</b> must <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> poor opinion of me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am open {{to renew}} the loan at the {{original}} interest until this time next year, when, no matter what I may have to part with, it will be paid off. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> already <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> fair return on your money," [...] I said.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think it's a {{place where}} <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> nice time, papa," [...] said his daughter, and Burnamy smiled with her; not because he knew {{anything}} about it.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I didn't go every day. Moreover I think <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> {{different}} idea in {{this country}} of what constitutes--well, what constitutes making love. A man commits himself much sooner.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "May I ask if I am right, sir," [...] he began, [...] "in {{believing that}} <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> {{unfavorable}} opinion of Miss Gwilt? You are quite convinced, I think--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let {{this end}} right here," [...] ordered Col. Zane. [...] "Clarke, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> made <b>a</b> <b>very</b> strong statement. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> {{anything}} to substantiate your words?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'He shall {{tell you}} himself to-morrow, my dear. Now, good night! <b>you</b> <b>have</b> been <b>a</b> <b>very</b> good child. Now, go to sleep, my dear one.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Beechnut. [...] "I am {{glad you}} are going. <b>You</b> will <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> {{pleasant}} journey, I have no doubt,--that is, if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> accidents enough." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't be nervous," [...] {{said the}} O'Kelly, [...] "and don't {{try to do}} too much. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> fair voice, but it's not powerful. Keep cool and open your mouth." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You have, undoubtedly; {{and there}} are {{situations}} in which very high spirits would denote insensibility. Your prospects, however, are too fair to justify want of spirits. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> smiling scene before you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, no, Catch, you do {{not think}} so; you think you think. Go and take all the odds you can get upon Goshawk. Come, now, to-morrow you will tell me <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> pretty book. Eh! mon cher Catch?' ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{shook her}} head. [...] "You say those things much too glibly," [...] she declared. [...] "I {{am afraid that}} <b>you</b> <b>have</b> served <b>a</b> <b>very</b> long apprenticeship." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are too modest," [...] Madame de Melbain said slowly. [...] "Louise <b>has</b> told me <b>a</b> good deal. I {{think that}} <b>you</b> <b>have</b> been <b>a</b> <b>very</b> {{faithful}} friend." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why couldn't {{you tell}} that woman {{to send the}} servants, without {{mentioning}} her legacy?" [...] Rothsay asked. [...] "My friend Lepel, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> done <b>a</b> <b>very</b> foolish thing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And indeed, indeed, sir," [...] said Arthur warmly. [...] "I shall in {{all ways}} trust you. I know and believe <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> noble heart, {{and you are}} Jack's friend, and you were hers. You shall do what you like." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "H'm, not of much use, I fear," [...] said Tregarthen. [...] "Hitchin {{is a tough}} old rascal, with a hard {{heart and}} a miserly disposition. However, it may be worth while to make the attempt, for <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> oily tongue, Oliver." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Upon my word <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> {{beautiful}} butler," [...] answered Pendennis, gallantly, [...] "and I don't {{wonder at}} the young fellows raving about her. When we were of their age, Captain Costigan, I think plainer women would have done our business." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing so dire as that, I believe. But if you've made me {{question}} {{the propriety of}} applying the blessing in all cases, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> done <b>a</b> <b>very</b> good thing." ...|$|R
6000|$|The man hesitated in his answer, and the Provost continued, [...] "You evidently {{did do it}} on purpose, and in that case, {{although}} it was carried too far, for I hear <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> narrow escape of being stifled, still you brought it upon yourself, and I {{hope it will be}} a lesson to you not to risk the lives of Eton boys for your amusement. I know nothing about this affair, but if you can point out the boys you suspect I will of course inquire into it." ...|$|R
60|$|In Euripides <b>you</b> <b>have</b> oftentimes <b>a</b> <b>very</b> near {{approach}} to comedy, and I hardly know any writer in whom {{you can find}} such fine models of serious and dignified conversation.|$|R
