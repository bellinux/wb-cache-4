Croshaw went on to say: [...] "I went in expecting a slew of interesting portal-based puzzles and that's exactly what I got, but what I wasn't expecting was some of the funniest pitch black humor I've ever heard in a game". He states that, while the game was short, the two- to three-hour length of the game was perfect as the game did not outstay its welcome, and called the ending [...] "balls-tighteningly fantastic", while praising the game as [...] "absolutely sublime from start to finish" [...] (adding that he would jam forks in his eyes if he ever praised a game so highly ever again).|$|E

Weapons also have a numerical value assigned, where upon a successful weapon strike you deal 'damage' equal to the number associated with your weapon type. This damage is dealt against your opponents Body/Armor. Typically, once you reach 0 body or less, you then begin the death stage which will be found in the [...] A subset of the point system is the Location System, where points vary depending on where your opponent is struck. If they are wearing armor in that location, then the 'damage dealt' effects their Armor Points (AP), versus if you strike a location without armor you deal damage against your opponents Body Points (BP). The majority of LARP's utilize this system.|$|E
