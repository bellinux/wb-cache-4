Frank advised on [...] "the human experience of space and time", helping Marvel conceive ideas for their cinematic multiverse, and suggesting dialogue for characters based on their beliefs, whether they were materialist, rationalist, reductionist, or [...] "had this enlarged perspective." [...] He noted that modern movie goers may not necessarily understand these complex scientific ideas, but do appear to appreciate [...] "amazing things happen from science. So by grounding <b>your</b> <b>stories</b> enough in science to not so much make them plausible, but to allow that science to open up new possibilities—people are used to that in their lives. So I think {{it makes sense to}} them, and it's exciting to them". This was an aspect of previous MCU films that Frank called a [...] "great thing ... speaking as a scientist", saying that [...] "they build a coherent and consistent universe that respects the scientific process and that uses enough of real science to make things plausible or build off them." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{his other}} works he experimented {{more with less}} {{traditional}} approaches to reality, so that [...] "the most frightful, the most unusual things are told with the deadpan expression". A commonly cited example is the physical and spiritual ascending into heaven of a character while she is hanging the laundry out to dry in One Hundred Years of Solitude. The style of these works fits in the [...] "marvellous realm" [...] described by the Cuban writer Alejo Carpentier and was labeled as magical realism. Literary critic Michael Bell proposes an alternative understanding for García Márquez's style, as the category magic realism is criticized for being dichotomizing and exoticizing, [...] "what is really at stake is a psychological suppleness which is able to inhabit unsentimentally the daytime world while remaining open to the promptings of those domains which modern culture has, by its own inner logic, necessarily marginalised or repressed." [...] García Márquez and his friend Plinio Apuleyo Mendoza discuss his work in a similar way,"The way you treat reality in your books ... has been called magical realism. I have the feeling your European readers are usually aware of the magic of <b>your</b> <b>stories</b> but fail to see the reality behind it ..." [...] "This is surely because their rationalism prevents them seeing that reality isn't limited {{to the price of}} tomatoes and eggs." ...|$|E
