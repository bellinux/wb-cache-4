2500|$|When Sondheim {{was about}} ten years old (around {{the time of his}} parents' divorce), he became friends with James Hammerstein, son of lyricist and playwright Oscar Hammerstein II. The elder Hammerstein became Sondheim's {{surrogate}} father, influencing him profoundly and developing his love of musical theatre. Sondheim met Hal Prince, who would direct many of his shows, at the opening of South Pacific, Hammerstein's musical with Richard Rodgers. The comic musical he wrote at George School, By George, was a success among his peers and buoyed the young songwriter's self-esteem. When Sondheim asked Hammerstein to evaluate it as though he had no knowledge of its author, he said it was the worst thing he had ever seen: [...] "But if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>why</b> it's terrible, I'll tell you." [...] They {{spent the rest of the}} day going over the musical, and Sondheim later said, [...] "In that afternoon I learned more about songwriting and the musical theater than most people learn in a lifetime." ...|$|E
