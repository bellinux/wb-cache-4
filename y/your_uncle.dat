25|$|Vancouver {{has always}} {{featured}} acts that don't fit any one particular musical slot. The 1990s were no different. Such as: Daytona, Bob's <b>Your</b> <b>Uncle,</b> Big Tall Garden, Coal, 2 Left Feet, Shine, Rymes with Orange, Circle C, Sarcastic Mannequins, Custer's Last Bandstand, Catherine Wheel, The Wingnuts, Dear God, and Pull offered an eclectic element {{to the local}} scene. Many of which received airplay on COAST 800 / 1040 AM from 1990-93.|$|E

25|$|In {{his later}} years, Monkhouse was {{probably}} {{better known for}} hosting television quiz shows than for being a comedian. One of his biggest successes was The Golden Shot from 1967 until 1972 and again in 1974. This was broadcast live for 52 weeks a year and drew up to 17 million viewers. His tenure ended with allegations, which he denied, {{that he had taken}} bribes to include branded goods on the programme as advertisements. He returned in 1974 after comedians Norman Vaughan and Charlie Williams were found wanting. The dozens of other shows Monkhouse presented included Celebrity Squares, Family Fortunes and Bob's Full House. Audiences regularly topped 15 million. In the late 1980s he hosted two series of the revival of the talent show Opportunity Knocks, which aired as Bob Says Opportunity Knocks. He then moved to ITV to front two more game shows, Bob's <b>Your</b> <b>Uncle</b> and the $64,000 Dollar Question, neither of which were popular successes.|$|E

For example: [...] "left over right; right over left, and Bob's <b>your</b> <b>uncle</b> – a reef knot." ...|$|E
2500|$|.....And Bob's <b>your</b> <b>uncle</b> is an {{expression}} of unknown origin, that means [...] "and there it is" [...] or [...] "and there you have it." [...] It is commonly used in Great Britain and Commonwealth countries. Typically, someone says it to conclude a set of simple instructions or when a result is reached. The meaning {{is similar to that of}} the French expression [...] "et voilà!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Want to {{know how}} to {{discipline}} your school buddy, your math teacher, your cat, and the housefly?

Just read the 50+ humorous guidance and playful instructions in this book that will tell you exactly what to do and how to do it. As the author suggests, [...] "When I was a kid, everybody believed that disciplining a child will create miracles. And sometimes it does. This book is about the fact that everything and everyone can be disciplined. (Except, of course, ourselves, because our personality is as sturdy as the icebergs at the North Pole. When I wrote the first instructions on how to discipline our family members, I suddenly realized: I can discipline anyone from a UFO to the police and the ghost in the attic. And I did, with no mercy!" ...|$|E
2500|$|On one occasion, Mu'awiya {{ascended the}} minbar and praised Allah. When {{he wanted to}} speak, a lad of the Ansar {{interrupted}} him and said, [...] "Mu'awiya! What makes you {{and the people of}} your house more entitled to this wealth than us! We have no wrong action against you that we know of other than our slaying of <b>your</b> <b>uncle</b> Walid, your grandfather 'Uqba, and your brother Hanzala." [...] Mu'awiya said, [...] "By Allah, nephew, you did not kill them. Rather Allah killed them with angels upon angels {{at the hands of the}} sons of their father. That was not a fault nor a loss." [...] The Ansari said, [...] "So where is the fault and loss then?" [...] He said, [...] "You spoke the truth. Do you need something?" [...] He said, [...] "Yes. I look after an old woman and sisters and things have been hard on us." [...] Mu'awiya said, [...] "Take what you can from the treasury." [...] The boy took it and then Mu'awiya resumed his khutba.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, it is <b>your</b> <b>uncle</b> {{that has}} the leetle property. And what had <b>your</b> <b>uncle</b> to do with Lady Ongar? What is <b>your</b> <b>uncle</b> to your friend Archie?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What you {{say about}} the royal parties and the court is {{intended}} for impertinence, knowing as you do know <b>your</b> <b>uncle's</b> position." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'I {{am going}} to try to write to <b>your</b> <b>uncle.</b> Johnnie, supposing you lose me, I look to <b>your</b> <b>uncle</b> and you for care of the little ones.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No. With <b>your</b> <b>uncle,</b> {{a minute}} or two later. He was wearing mauve pyjamas and carried a pistol. Have you ever seen <b>your</b> <b>uncle</b> in pyjamas and a pistol?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ay! I hope <b>your</b> <b>uncle</b> did {{not expect}} a godson like your dear Coeur de Lion, whom you have been romancing about all the way home. What is the country <b>your</b> <b>uncle</b> has seen, {{and you want to}} see, Johnnie?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'If asking {{would do}} any good, my dear,' sighed Honor; 'but I don't think nurse knows. You see, {{you belong to}} <b>your</b> <b>uncles</b> now.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I only hope," [...] he said {{a little}} gravely, [...] "that <b>your</b> <b>uncle</b> will not expect too much from my coming. It seems churlish to refuse, and even though our views are as far apart as the poles, I know that <b>your</b> <b>uncle</b> means well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is no doubt," [...] she admitted, [...] "that <b>your</b> <b>Uncle</b> Theodore was inveigled into supporting, to {{a certain}} extent, a party whose leaders have shown {{themselves}} utterly irresponsible.

6000|$|... "Then why do {{you tell}} me all this {{rigmarole}} about <b>your</b> <b>uncle</b> and his leetle property, and Warwickshire?

6000|$|... "Yes, he's {{had plenty}} of time, if he did the deed {{as long ago as}} that. Did he have {{anything}} else besides <b>your</b> <b>uncle's</b> watch?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite well. Of course, {{you know}} that your father and <b>your</b> <b>Uncle</b> Sam were wounded by some flying shells, and that <b>your</b> <b>Uncle</b> Dick {{suffered}} from a gas attack. But they are all recovering rapidly, and I don't doubt but what they will soon be as well as ever." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is true enough," [...] I answered. [...] "The {{only point}} for doubt {{is what he}} has done with the money he {{received}} on their account. <b>Your</b> <b>Uncle</b> Ferdinand there was the person who was intrusted with the plans and commission. For some reason or other <b>your</b> <b>Uncle</b> Maurice has carried it through, and to tell you the truth, I believe he has gone off with the money. If you take my advice you will bring <b>your</b> <b>Uncle</b> Ferdinand upstairs, and the lady who is with him, if you like, and let the others fight it out." ...|$|E
6000|$|At this {{question}} Dick Rover's face {{took on a}} sudden sober look. [...] "No; I {{never wanted to be}} separated from <b>your</b> <b>uncle,</b> that's true," [...] he said. [...] "But I tell you what we did used to do. When his pranks got too wild I and <b>your</b> <b>Uncle</b> Sam used to hold him in." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "True. You are a gentleman's daughter. But who {{was your}} mother? Who are <b>your</b> <b>uncles</b> and aunts? Do not imagine me ignorant of their condition." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Fanny, {{it is all}} happily settled, {{and without}} the {{smallest}} hesitation on <b>your</b> <b>uncle's</b> side. He had but one opinion. You are to go." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Rather! It was my {{introduction}} to <b>your</b> <b>uncle's</b> household. Selina {{sat on my}} left, and Louise on my right. You sat opposite, tired and disagreeable." ...|$|R
