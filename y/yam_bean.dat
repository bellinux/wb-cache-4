50|$|Although little {{research}} has been devoted to this plant, some important studies have been conducted including one on how to relieve these health problems. Studies show problems are resolved when the <b>yam</b> <b>bean</b> seeds are exposed to pre cooking treatments such as lactic-acid fermented using a low level technological process. The fermentation method also reduces the amount of time and energy to produce a viable food product from the <b>yam</b> <b>bean.</b> In addition to research on cooking treatments, some research has been conducted on the genetic variability of the plant. The <b>yam</b> <b>bean</b> has a high level of genetic variability, which will be useful during the hybridization of the plant in order to increase food production and sustainability. While the <b>yam</b> <b>bean</b> has been subject to cultivation, there has been little artificial selection on specific traits. If the <b>yam</b> <b>bean</b> could be grown in large quantities, this crop could be the important source of protein needed by the people of sub-Saharan Africa.|$|E
50|$|This <b>yam</b> <b>bean</b> is a {{very useful}} crop because of the extreme {{conditions}} it can thrive in, including high rainfall, acidity, and infertile soils, and its resistance to several major crop pests. It is also useful because of its high nitrogen-fixing ability, replenishing soil it is grown in of its nitrogen. In West Africa, {{the seeds of the}} African <b>yam</b> <b>bean</b> are primarily used, while in the East and Central regions of Africa, the tubers are primarily used. The African <b>yam</b> <b>bean</b> is a legume that is rich in protein and starch and an important source of calcium and amino acids. It contains amino acids that are important for the development in early pre-school and school aged children and also those required for adults. The <b>yam</b> <b>bean</b> is a useful source of nutrients for many African communities with a nutritional value comparable to that of the soybean, although the cooking time for the <b>yam</b> <b>bean</b> is much longer (4-6 hours). However, some health problems have been discovered in relation to consumption of these beans including flatulence, stomach cramps, diarrhea and dizziness. These problems result from the way they are usually cooked.|$|E
50|$|Sphenostylis stenocarpa {{belongs to}} the Fabaceae family {{characterized}} by its fruit (legume) and stipulated leaves. Three species of Sphenostylis are important food sources in Africa, including the under-exploited African <b>Yam</b> <b>Bean</b> or Sphenostylis stenocarpa, which can be consumed as dry cooked seeds or tuber. Seeds are usually added to soups, made into sauces, or milled into flour. The African <b>yam</b> <b>bean</b> is grown in countries of West Africa such as Cameroon, Cote d’Ivoire, Ghana, Nigeria, and Togo. The tuber grows as the root source, while the <b>yam</b> <b>bean</b> develops into the pod containing 20-30 seeds found above the ground. These seeds {{can be found in}} colors including brown, black, and red varieties. It grows as a vine to heights of about 3m and produces brightly colored flowers in 100-150 days.|$|E
40|$|Proximate {{analyses}} of two traditional grain legumes consumed in Eastern Nigeria- Bambara groundnut (Voadzeia subterranean) and African <b>yam</b> <b>beans</b> (Sphenostylis stenocarpa) were carried out. Bambara groundnut {{was found to}} contain 2. 86 ± 0. 02 % moisture, 32. 40 ± 0. 02 % protein, 7. 35 ± 0. 02 % fat, 5. 78 ± 0. 02 % ash, 2. 68 ± 0. 02 % crude fiber and 51. 78 ± 0. 02 % total carbohydrates. African <b>yam</b> <b>beans</b> contained the following: 1. 96 ± 0. 02 % moistuire, 37. 21 ± 0. 02 % proteins, 9. 49 ± 0. 02 % fat, 5. 35 ± 0. 02 Ash, 3. 55 ± 0. 02 crude fiber and 44. 4 ± 0. 02 % total carbohydrates. The result indicates that the two underutilized food legumes have high protein content with African <b>yam</b> <b>beans</b> having slightly higher value of the protein nutrient. They also contain varying levels of ash content, crude fiber and carbohydrates. This reveals that bambara groundnut and African <b>yam</b> <b>beans</b> are important food sources that can be exploited particularly in the developing countries were there is shortage in animal protein and under nutrition facing many families in developing countries...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Amino acid {{composition}} of raw and cooked African <b>yam</b> <b>beans</b> and African locust beans have been determined. The {{results showed that}} cooked or raw beans contained all the amino acid commonly found in protein food materials. Cooking has significant effect on some essential amino acid contents of the two seeds (P> 0. 05). When the samples were cooked, the essential amino acid content of African <b>yam</b> <b>beans</b> and African locust beans were observed to change from 1. 12 to 0. 97 g per 16 g N and from 1. 69 to 1. 79 g/ 16 g N respectively. African locust beans showed isoleucine and threonine to be its limiting amino acids. Their values increased slightly on cooking from 2. 27 to 2. 31 (African <b>yam</b> <b>beans)</b> and from 2. 91 to 3. 33 g per 16 g N(African locust beans). The advanced amino acid profile of the two cooked seed samples compares favourably with whole hen’s egg {{and most of them}} meet the daily requirement of FAO and WHO. The amounts of lysine, proline and glutamic acids amounts reduces cooking any of the two studied beans, while the remaining amino acids showed slight but varied percentage changes on cooking.
