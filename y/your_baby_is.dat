It {{may be that the}} archbishop's sermon is not so fine as some of those discourses twenty years ago which used to delight the {{faithful}} in Granada. Or it may be (pleasing thought!) that the critic is a dullard, and does not understand what he is writing about. Everybody who has been to an exhibition has heard visitors discoursing about the pictures before their faces. One says, [...] "This is very well;" [...] another says, [...] "This is stuff and rubbish;" [...] another cries, [...] "Bravo! this is a masterpiece:" [...] and each has a right to his opinion. For example, one of the pictures I admired most at the Royal Academy is by a gentleman on whom I never, to my knowledge, set eyes. This picture is No. 346, [...] "Moses," [...] by Mr. S. Solomon. I thought it had a great intention, I thought it finely drawn and composed. It nobly represented, to my mind, the dark children of the Egyptian bondage, and suggested the touching story. My newspaper says: [...] "Two ludicrously ugly women, looking at a dingy baby, do not form a pleasing object;" [...] and so good-by, Mr. Solomon. Are not most of our babies served so in life? and doesn't Mr. Robinson consider Mr. Brown's cherub an ugly, squalling little brat? So cheer up, Mr. S. S.

When Pharaoh's kind daughter found the child, and cherished and loved it, and took it home, and found a nurse for it, too, I dare say there were grim, brick-dust colored chamberlains, or some of the tough, old, meagre, yellow princesses at court, who never had children themselves, who cried out, [...] "Faugh! the horrid little squalling wretch!"

40|$|Choosing {{the right}} time to start {{introducing}} solid food has been a dilemma for centuries. This decision can be even more difficult for <b>babies</b> who <b>were</b> born prematurely. The Window of Opportunity There is a reasonably small window of opportunity to start <b>your</b> <b>baby</b> on solids. Too soon (before 16 weeks postnatal age) and there is an increased risk of allergy and anaemia because the gut is not ready. Most babies do not yet have enough control over their tongues and mouth muscles. Instead of swallowing the food, they push their tongues against the spoon or the food. This tongue-pushing reflex helps <b>babies</b> when they <b>are</b> breastfeeding or drinking from a bottle. Most babies lose this reflex at about 4 months of age. Too late (after 7 - 10 months postnatal age) and <b>your</b> <b>baby</b> may have developed a resistance to having anything but milk in his or her mouth. There is also a risk of anaemia with starting solids late because a <b>baby</b> <b>is</b> born with only enough iron stores to last about 6 months and after that needs to get iron from food.
