50|$|<b>Yersiniosis</b> {{is usually}} {{self-limiting}} {{and does not}} require treatment. For severe infections (sepsis, focal infection) especially if associated with immunosuppression, the recommended regimen includes doxycycline in combination with an aminoglycoside. Other antibiotics active against Y. enterocolitica include trimethoprim-sulfamethoxasole, fluoroquinolones, ceftriaxone, and chloramphenicol. Y. enterocolitica is usually resistant to penicillin G, ampicillin, and cephalotin due to beta-lactamase production.|$|E
50|$|Yersinia enterocolitica is a Gram-negative bacillus-shaped bacterium, {{belonging}} to the family Enterobacteriaceae. It is motile at temperatures of 22-29°C, but becomes nonmotile at normal human body temperature. Y. enterocolitica infection causes the disease <b>yersiniosis,</b> which is an animal-borne disease occurring in humans, {{as well as in}} a wide array of animals such as cattle, deer, pigs, and birds. Many of these animals recover from the disease and become carriers; these are potential sources of contagion despite showing no signs of disease. The bacterium infects the host by sticking to its cells using trimeric autotransporter adhesins.|$|E
50|$|The portal {{of entry}} is the {{gastrointestinal}} tract. The organism is acquired usually by insufficiently cooked pork or contaminated water, meat, or milk. Acute Y. enterocolitica infections usually lead to mild self-limiting enterocolitis or terminal ileitis and adenitis in humans. Symptoms may include watery or bloody diarrhea and fever, resembling appendicitis or salmonellosis or shigellosis. After oral uptake, Yersinia species replicate {{in the terminal}} ileum and invade Peyer's patches. From here they can disseminate further to mesenteric lymph nodes causing lymphadenopathy. This condition can be confused with appendicitis, so is called pseudoappendicitis. In immunosuppressed individuals, they can disseminate from the gut to the liver and spleen and form abscesses. Because Yersinia species are siderophilic (iron-loving) bacteria, people with hereditary hemochromatosis (a disease resulting in high body iron levels) {{are more susceptible to}} infection with Yersinia (and other siderophilic bacteria). In fact, the most common contaminant of stored blood is Y. enterocolitica. See <b>yersiniosis</b> for further details.|$|E
40|$|Introduction Y. enterocolitica is the causative {{agent of}} <b>yersiniosis</b> – a {{foodborne}} zoonosis with substantial importance to public health. Y. enterocolitica is {{widespread in the}} environment and animal populations, posing a potential source of infection to humans. Objective. Presentation of <b>yersiniosis</b> as a zoonotic foodborne disease of relevance to public health. State of knowledge Swine {{play an important role}} as a reservoir of Y. enterocolitica and insufficiently thermally processed pork is the main source of infection to humans. The correlation between strains isolated from pigs and from clinical cases of human <b>yersiniosis</b> has been sufficiently proven. <b>Yersiniosis</b> usually appears with gastrointestinal disturbances in children, whereas in adults it manifests in a pseudo-appendix form. The extra-enteric form of <b>yersiniosis</b> is rare. Classical bacteriological methods used for classifying Y. enterocolitica as pathogenic {{does not take into account}} the new aspects of the pathogenesis of <b>yersiniosis.</b> The examples are biotype 1 A strains, commonly regarded as non-pathogenic, although they are increasingly often isolated from clinical cases of <b>yersiniosis.</b> Molecular methods seem much more effective and accurate in the diagnostic. New diagnostic tools such as real-time PCR, allows not only qualitative examination, but also quantitative evaluation of genes expression level, or single nucleotide polymorphism detection. Conclusions <b>Yersiniosis</b> is an important food-borne zoonosis with wide range of clinical symptoms. Considering the fact that pork is the main source of infection for humans, public information campaigns seems to be an important element of the preventive measures against Y. enterocolitica infections...|$|E
40|$|Background: Foodborne Yersinia enterocolitica infections {{continue}} to be a public health problem in many countries. Consumption of raw or undercooked pork is the main risk factor for <b>yersiniosis</b> in Germany. Small children are most frequently affected by <b>yersiniosis.</b> In older children and young adults, symptoms of disease may resemble those of appendicitis and may lead to hospitalization and potentially unnecessary appendectomies. Y. enterocolitica infections may also cause sequelae such as reactive arthritis (ReA), erythema nodosum (EN), and conjunctivitis. Methods: We studied clinical aspects of <b>yersiniosis,</b> antimicrobial use, and self-reported occurrence of appendectomies, reactive arthritis, erythema nodosum and conjunctivitis. To assess post-infectious sequelae participants of a large population-based case–control study on laboratory-confirmed Y. enterocolitica infections conducted in Germany in 2009 – 2010 were followed for 4 weeks. Results: Diarrhea occurred most frequently in children ≤ 4 years (95 %); abdominal pain in the lower right quadrant was most common in children 5 – 14 years of age (63 %). Twenty-seven per cent of patients were hospitalized, 37 % were treated with antimicrobials. In 6 % of <b>yersiniosis</b> patients ≥ 5 years of age, appendectomies were performed. Self-reported symptoms consistent with ReA were reported by 12 % of <b>yersiniosis</b> patients compared to 5 % in a reference group not exposed to <b>yersiniosis.</b> Symptoms consistent with EN were reported by 3 % of <b>yersiniosis</b> patients compared to 0. 1 % in the reference group. Symptoms of conjunctivitis occurred with the same frequency in <b>yersiniosis</b> patients and the reference group. Conclusions: Acute Y. enterocolitica infections cause considerable burden of illness with symptoms lasting for about 10 days and hospitalizations in {{more than a quarter of}} patients. The proportion of <b>yersiniosis</b> patients treated with antimicrobial drugs appears to be relatively high despite guidelines recommending their use only in severe cases. Appendectomies and post-infectious complications (ReA and EN) are more frequently reported in <b>yersiniosis</b> patients than in the reference group suggesting that they can be attributed to infections with Y. enterocolitica. Physicians should keep recent Y. enterocolitica infection in mind in patients with symptoms resembling appendicitis as well as in patients with symptoms of unclear arthritis...|$|E

Results A total of 47, 627 cases of <b>yersiniosis</b> were reported. The mean annual incidence of <b>yersiniosis</b> was 7. 2 / 100, 000 population. A downward trend {{in the number of}} reportable cases has occurred since 2002. Almost all Y. enterocolitica infections were reported as single cases, i. e., with no apparent links to other cases. The number of reported infections showed substantially less seasonal variation than in other zoonotic enteric diseases. The incidence was highest in children under five years (58 / 100, 000 population), in particular in one-year-old children (108 / 100, 000 population). Almost 97 % of infections were acquired domestically. High incidences occurred in the eastern German federal states Thuringia, Saxony, and Saxony-Anhalt. Differences in incidences across federal states were driven primarily by incidence differences in children under five years. Hospitalization was reported for 17 % of cases, the proportion being highest among teenagers. Almost 90 % of Y. enterocolitica strains were diagnosed as serotype O: 3, which is the serotype most frequently isolated from pigs. Conclusions <b>Yersiniosis</b> is a zoonotic foodborne disease of relevance to public health in Germany because of its high incidence and risk for sequelae. The incidence of reported <b>yersiniosis</b> in Germany varies markedly from state to state, mainly due to incidence difference among young children. More research efforts should be directed towards the elucidation of risk factors of <b>yersiniosis</b> in this age group. </p...|$|E
40|$|In 194 {{patients}} presenting {{with acute}} abdominal pain from whom sequential serum samples were taken, {{the frequency of}} <b>yersiniosis,</b> established serologically, was significantly higher (23 %) than in 320 control subjects (2 %). <b>Yersiniosis</b> occurred in 31 % of patients with acute appendicitis. Acute-phase serum samples only, obtained in a further 307 patients, yielded a falsely low frequency of <b>yersiniosis</b> (4 %). Y pseudotuberculosis was five times more common than Y enterocolitica, and Y pseudotuberculosis type IV {{was the most common}} serotype, accounting for 43 % of Yersinia infections. Yersinia may play a more important part in the aetiology of acute abdominal pain, and particularly acute appendicitis, than has been previously appreciated. Antibody titres to both Y enterocolitica and Y pseudotuberculosis frequently rise late in infections causing abdominal pain.

40|$|Simple {{cost-effective}} bacterins are {{the earliest}} and most successfully used commercial vaccines in fish. In particular, those prepared from Yersinia ruckeri have proven effective at controlling Enteric Red Mouth Disease (ERM) and <b>yersiniosis</b> in rainbow trout and Atlantic salmon, respectively. However, {{the emergence of}} outbreaks of ERM caused by atypical biotypes of Y. ruckeri and reports of vaccine failure resulting in mass mortality of hatchery Atlantic salmon has reinvigorated interest in vaccines against fish bacterial diseases. Therefore {{the objective of this}} study was to identify surrogates of protection against <b>yersiniosis</b> using cDNA microarray to characterise the response of host genes in the gills of unvaccinated and vaccinated Atlantic salmon challenged with Y. ruckeri. Differentially expressed genes were identified using two-way ANOVA and restricted to those with > 2. 5 -fold change at P< 0. 05. Using cDNA microarray we identified the expression of 6 genes in response to infection and 4 genes associated with the protective host response to <b>yersiniosis.</b> Analysis by real-time PCR confirmed that three immunologically relevant genes, namely a cathelicidin (47 -fold) and a C-type lectin (19 -fold) increased in response to <b>yersiniosis.</b> Including collagenase (17 -fold increase), an important tissue remodelling and repair enzyme, these genes represent 3 of 6 non-protective and/or pathological responses to <b>yersiniosis.</b> Genes associated with the protective host response included an immunoglobulin gene and a selenoprotein that showed significant fold changes (15 -fold increases each), highlighting the importance of antibody-mediated protection against <b>yersiniosis.</b> These findings provide much needed knowledge of the host-pathogen interaction in response to bacterial infection and immunisation in fish. Significantly, we identified a transcriptional biosignature consisting of predominantly immune-relevant genes (14 up and 3 down-regulated) in the gills of Atlantic salmon after immersion vaccination and before bacterial challenge. This biosignature may be used as a surrogate of protection and therefore as a predictor of vaccine success against <b>yersiniosis...</b>|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{elucidate}} the gastrointestinal manifestations of <b>yersiniosis.</b> During the period 1974 to 1983, Yersinia enterocolitica infection was diagnosed in 458 patients, by isolation from fecal samples or by antibody response. At first admission, 184 patients had abdominal pain; 200, diarrhea; 45, vomiting; and 36, weight loss. Ulcerative colitis was diagnosed in 7 patients, Crohn's disease in 2, and unspecific colitis in 11. Mesenteric lymphadenitis or ileitis were found in 43 of 56 patients at laparotomy. The patients were followed for 4 to 14 years (1987). Thirty-eight patients were readmitted with abdominal pain and 28 with diarrhea; these symptoms were significantly correlated with the corresponding symptoms at first admission. Chronic colitis was diagnosed in 4 patients, chronic weight loss in 12. A follow-up inquiry (380 patients) indicated that patients with right iliac fossa pain during the acute infection less frequently developed chronic abdominal complaints. Gastrointestinal symptoms are common in both the acute and chronic states of <b>yersiniosis.</b> The correlations between acute and chronic symptoms indicate that <b>yersiniosis</b> is a chronic disease.

40|$|<b>Yersiniosis</b> is a food-borne {{illness that}} has become more {{prevalent}} in recent years due to human transmission via the fecal-oral route and prevalence in farm animals. <b>Yersiniosis</b> is primarily caused by Yersinia enterocolitica and less frequently by Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. Infection is usually characterized by a self-limiting acute infection beginning in the intestine and spreading to the mesenteric lymph nodes. However, more serious infections and chronic conditions can also occur, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. Y. enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis are both heterogeneous organisms that vary considerably in their degrees of pathogenicity, although some generalizations can be ascribed to pathogenic variants. Adhesion molecules and a type III secretion system are critical for the establishment and progression of infection. Additionally, host innate and adaptive immune responses are both required for yersiniae clearance. Despite the ubiquity of enteric Yersinia species and their association as important causes of food poisoning world-wide, few national enteric pathogen surveillance programs include the yersiniae as notifiable pathogens. Moreover, no standard exists whereby identification and reporting systems can be effectively compared and global trends developed.

40|$|<b>Yersiniosis</b> is {{an acute}} or chronic enteric {{zoonosis}} caused by enteropathogenic Yersinia species. Although <b>yersiniosis</b> is predominantly associated with gastroenteric forms of infection, extraintestinal forms are often reported from the elderly or patients with predisposing factors. <b>Yersiniosis</b> is often reported {{in countries with}} cold and mild climates (Northern and Central Europe, New Zealand and North of Russian Federation). The Irish Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) currently records only 3 - 7 notified cases of <b>yersiniosis</b> per year. At the same time pathogenic Yersinia enterocolitica is recovered from pigs (main source of pathogenic Y. enterocolitica) at the levels similar to that observed in Yersinia endemic countries. Introduction of Yersinia selective culture procedures may increase Yersinia isolation rates. To establish whether {{the small number of}} notifications of human disease was an underestimate due to lack of specific selective culture for Yersinia we carried out a prospective culture study of faecal samples from outpatients with diarrhoea, with additional culture of appendix and throat swabs. Higher levels of anti-Yersinia seroprevalence than <b>yersiniosis</b> notification rates in endemic countries suggests that most <b>yersiniosis</b> cases are unrecognised by culture. Subsequently, in addition to a prospective culture study of clinical specimens, we carried out serological screening of Irish blood donors and environmental screening of human sewage. Pathogenic Yersinia strains were not isolated from 1, 189 faeces samples, nor from 297 throat swabs, or 23 appendix swabs. This suggested that current low notification rates in Ireland are not {{due to the lack of}} specific Yersinia culture procedures. Molecular screening detected a wider variety of Y. enterocolitica-specific targets in pig slurry than in human sewage. A serological survey for antibodies against Yersinia YOP (Yersinia Outer Proteins) proteins in Irish blood donors found antibodies in 25 %, with an age-related trend to increased seropositivity, compatible with the hypothesis that <b>yersiniosis</b> may have been more prevalent in Ireland in the recent past. Y. enterocolitica is a heterogeneous group of microorganisms that comprises strains with different degree of pathogenicity. Although non-pathogenic Y. enterocolitica lack conventional virulence factors, these strains can be isolated from patients with diarrhoea. Insecticidal Toxin Complex (ITC) and Cytolethal Distending Toxins can potentially contribute to the virulence of non-pathogenic Y. enterocolitica in the absence of other virulence factors. We compared distribution of ITC and CDT loci among pathogenic and non-pathogenic Y. enterocolitica. Additionally, to demonstrate potential pathogenicity of non-pathogenic Y. enterocolitica we compared their virulence towards Galleria mellonella larvae (a non-mammalian model of human bacterial infections) with the virulence of highly and mildly pathogenic Y. enterocolitica strains. Surprisingly, virulence of pathogenic and non-pathogenic Y. enterocolitica in Galleria mellonella larvae observed at 37 °C did not correlate with their pathogenic potential towards humans. Comparative phylogenomic analysis detects predicted coding sequences (CDSs) that define host-pathogen interactions and hence providing insights into molecular evolution of bacterial virulence. Comparative phylogenomic analysis of microarray data generated in Y. enterocolitica strains isolated in the Great Britain from humans with diarrhoea and domestic animals revealed high genetic heterogeneity of these species. Because of the extensive human, animal and food exchanges between the UK and Ireland the objective of this study was to gain further insight into genetic heterogeneity and relationships among clinical and non-clinical Y. enterocolitica strains of various pathogenic potential isolated in Ireland and Great Britain. No evidence of direct transfer of strains between the two countries was found...|$|E
30|$|Non-infectious {{causes of}} granulomatous {{lymphadenitis}} include sarcoidosis, berylliosis and sarcoid-like reaction, {{and these are}} rarely associated with abscesses or necrosis [31]. Infectious granulomatous lymphadenitis can be further categorised as suppurative or non-suppurative. Suppurative infections are associated with central abscesses, necrosis and granulomas and include tularaemia, cat-scratch disease, <b>yersiniosis</b> and lymphogranuloma venereum.|$|E

40|$|Yersinia enterocolitica biotype 1, {{serotype}} O: 21 {{was isolated}} from feces or rectal washings of {{three members of}} one family in northwestern Saskatchewan. The three isolates gave positive pathogenicity tests in guinea pigs with cultures grown at 22 degrees C as inoculum. All three cases showed clinical symptoms consistent with <b>yersiniosis.</b> All three cases had symptoms of diarrhea and abdominal pain, and two cases had recorded fever. In two cases, appendicitis was initially suspect. One case with ileitis and peritonitis was fatal. The environmental source of the infection was not found, but river water, milk, and person-to-person spread are discussed as possible sources of the infections. The need for microbiology laboratories to culture stool specimens specifically for Y. enterocolitica, using cold-enrichment techniques is emphasized. This family outbreak of <b>yersiniosis</b> provides further evidence that certain biotype 1 strains of Y. enterocolitica are pathogenic...|$|E
40|$|Although {{pathogenic}} Yersinia {{have been}} described several decades ago, human Yersinia infections remain enigmatic. The high prevalence in Europe and the variety of manifestations should be known to most clinicians. Both Yersinia enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis may cause similar clinical pictures. The clinical spectrum encompasses both intestinal and extraintestinal infectious syndromes and reactive or postinfectious immunological manifestations. The limited value of the currently available serodiagnostic techniques and the broad clinical spectrum make reactive <b>yersiniosis</b> a difficult diagnosis. <b>Yersiniosis</b> {{must be considered in}} the differential diagnosis of rheumatic and collagen vascular diseases. In selected indications the use of newer diagnostic tools such as immunoblotting and indirect immunofluorescence may increase the diagnostic yield in idiopathic reactive manifestations or recurrent or persisting infections of unknown origin.
