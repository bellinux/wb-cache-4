The company was presented with a flag by Mrs. J. R. R. Adams at this event. Mrs. Adams made the following speech at the flag presentation: [...] Captain Murff— In respect to you and your gallant soldiers, and in behalf of the married ladies here assembled, I present to you this silken flag. It is emblematic of that flag which is now struggling so hard to wave in freedom over our shores. You will perceive upon it inscribed the words, [...] "Conquer we must, In God is our trust." [...] We have placed these simple, but beautiful words there, hoping that they may remind you, when <b>you</b> <b>re</b> far away, of the great necessity of placing all your trust on Him who knoweth all things, and who doeth all things well. His ever watchful eye will beam with love upon you; he will be your solace and hope in the hour of need; your light and comfort in the dark night of trouble. That God who has promised mercy to the shorn lamb will never forsake you if you will love him, obey him, and reverence his holy name. Ask of him, then, to smile upon you in this most glorious undertaking; place yourselves under his heavenly protection, and then, valiant warriors, rally forth in the defence of your country, your homes and your firesides, and say with confidence, and with cheerful hearts, [...] "Oh, conquer we must, for our cause is just; See, there is our motto, in God is our trust." [...] This was the chosen motto of your honored, illustrious Washington. Under it he led forth the gallant heroes of the revolution; under it your forefathers fought and died, and thereby purchased for us those blessings, of liberty, freedom and peace, which once were ours, and which shall be ours again. You are now about to leave your friends, your homes and your loved ones here, for the tented field, to battle in your country's cause; and I sincerely trust that this flag may be a pillar of light by day to shield and protect you, and as a pillar of fire by night to lead you on to victory and success. Think not that you will be forgotten by those you are leaving behind. Oh, no, brave soldiers, our thoughts will follow after you, and, in spirit, we will wander with you far over the beautiful hills and pleasant valleys of our own dear sunny South, and we will bless our weary soldiers; and from our hearts will ascend to heaven a silent and a fervent prayer that the God of battles will be with you; that he will shield and comfort you, and return you all again, crowned with honors, to the homes and friends from which you are now parting. Then take this flag, and have it carried in triumph until peace shall be restored to our beloved country, and until our independence shall be recognized by all the great nations of the earth. (Advancing and placing the staff in Captain Murff's hand, continued,):Our fingers have made for brothers and sons, :I give it to you now in trust, :That you never will leave it while sabres and guns :Can save it from trailing in dust.:Bright banner of beauty in glory unfurl, :On continent, ocean and sea, :To nations and kingdoms throughout the wide world; :Go, flag of the brave and the free.:May laurel on laurel around thee entwine, :And still they dominion be peace, :Whilst the stars in thy circle forever shall shine, :And God's blessings on thee increase.|$|E

40|$|Development is empowerment, {{and that}} is not just a {{methodology}} or a development gimmick. Empowerment means that people get equipped to deal with their own situation in a practical and viable way. The first step towards empowerment is assisting communities in making power analyses. Help them understand the difference between positive and negative power and how to cope with that. Power is important, believe me, I have been in different power circles including being a Minister, I know what power is. In Sindebele, the language spoken in south western Zimbabwe, the equivalent word for development means actually taking control over what you need to work with for survival. So development in this sense means empowerment {{and that is}} a very fundamental human right. When things are difficult and resources are scarce, it are always the weakest, who benefit the last, and it are the strongest that get the resources before the poor. I find that {{a great deal of the}} poorest people in the poverty stricken bracket of our communities are women. So it is not by design that I focus on women, it is because women are there and because the majority of people that need empowerment, are women. A foremost strategy of people working for development has to be assisting communities to understand power. One cannot empower somebody else. People can only empower themselves and an essential prerequisite for empowerment is understanding power and how it is acquired, exercised and maintained, between women and men, between those who own resources and those who do not. Power dynamics play within the family, the community, the society and the globe. Power is neutral until it is acquired and used. But completely without it, we just are lethargic. Power enables people and enhances life but one should clearly distinguish positive and negative power. Positive power is one of caring and sharing, the power to connect and to work together. Negative power is the power that dominates and oppresses. It is selfish, greedy and wants things for itself. It is often possessed by men, but by powerful women too. They want to flex their muscles and exercise their power in order for their presence to be felt. However, since everybody has to take part in this power analyses, I favour a family approach rather than a women approach. Both men and women must be exposed to the same kind of dialogue. The powers that be As a member of a rural community, for instance, ask yourself what the existing powers are and which powers prevent you from acquiring positive power. Who is it that is sharing positive power in your family and in your community and how can you link up to this person? Power shared is power gained. If it is a negative power that is exercised in your community; who is exercising it? Is it your husband, your children, your neighbour, a rich neighbour, the politician, the rural councillor? This power could prevent your community from doing things, from accessing economic resources or infrastructure. Then together you determine what the strategies are which need to be put in place in order to acquire positive power and to reverse this negative power. There is a limit to which you can hold negative power. Sustainable development exists when you can regenerate your energies and when <b>you</b> can <b>re</b> focus and reconnect to a wider world. The positive power is the power we should use in development. In agriculture for instance we go back to our culture of working together. The basis of the village groups is a tradition of collective work called amalima whereby all members attend to each family s fields in rotation. Most jobs are done collectively gathering firewood, fetching water, even home improvements, which have been extensive. You have to identify what you need to grow or build and having identified that you can see and find out whether your neighbours also want to grow or build the same and how they want to do that. This is a process of empowering themselves through empowering each other. This applies for any activity, be it food processing, harvesting or building dams. One example is the Give a Dam Programme that started with the drought of 1993 - 94. Various member communities wanted to have a dam for water. In order for the communities to achieve the implementation of a dam, they needed for instance the approval of a councillor for permits, a government official to peg the dam, they had to authorise a NGO to get the tools and had to organise themselves to arrange manual labour. By working around this, they also discover that individuals might be blocking the process. An NGO or political leader, who is promising things that do not happen, a local leader who is corrupt and using people s time and resources. The process of discovering, discussing and developing strategies to cope is really learning and understanding the power dynamics. Identifying the problem is the problem half solved. A politician who wanted to peg a dam for political reasons at a spot not to the liking of the community, saw his intentions abandoned. On the other hand communities can be convinced by a technical expert to choose a spot farther away from the village than their initial choice, simply for physical and geographical reasons. To me both examples illustrate positive power. Constructive criticism and engagement with others along the line. Then together you share power.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{senseless}} things to do is re-inventing the wheel. Still, how do you know, {{what is going on}} in the field of agricultural research in the world around you, your region, your country or even abroad? Secondly, doing research, requires access to reliable information, either from previous or new research. Information management, including libraries, research journals and databases, are essential for research organisations but also for politicians and planners, who need to know what research to support, expand, copy or abolish. Nonetheless, in recent years the research budgets especially in the developing countries have been declining and libraries and other information processing activities faced paradoxically the first and heaviest budget cuts. An extra reason and challenge to organise information storage, distribution and overall management as efficient as possible. Knowing where you are going accommodates a rich variety in concepts, examples and methodologies to achieve this. Small wonder that technologies, such as geographical information systems and new information and communication technologies, receive ample attention. The first part is specifically written for the research manager and explains how to establish a Management Information System, which is practically illustrated with cases in Ghana, Uganda, Zambia and Latin American countries.

40|$|When <b>you</b> <b>re</b> a {{smallholder}} farmer, it is {{not always}} easy to get your inputs since many traders only sell in bulk, charge extra for small quantities or only sell in towns and cities. Being an independent and a small rural business, making contact with giant agriculture suppliers can be equally difficult. To improve this situation, Care Zambia launched the Rural Enterprise and Agri-business Promotion (REAP) programme in 1999. Its aim is to support local business people to supply farmers in remote rural areas with necessary inputs while reducing real and opportunity costs. It also provides farmers a channel to sell the farm outputs to urban based buyers, through the same local traders. REAP thus wants to create networks of community based agri-traders and provide a channel for dissemination of market information to smallholder farmers. The programme involves not only loans to start-up small businesses, organising transport and building up stocks of inputs, but it also includes a training programme. This covers financial management, book keeping, accounting, stock taking and doing deals with companies as their supplier and their retail outlet. The input stocks, which are allowed to be built up to a certain level, serve as collateral for the loans. So far, REAP has trained 27 agents, who serve approximately 5, 400 rural families, with inputs from 8 agri-suppliers. A general lesson from the programme is that these services, which were often provided by now-defunct marketing boards, sometimes need a good push to get off the ground, and cannot always be expected to take shape spontaneously.

Longboarders of all ages and abilities will benefit from the practical advice offered by a writing team of seasoned travellers and pros. There s plenty to soak up, whether <b>you</b> <b>re</b> planning a road trip to Europe, a cold-water trip to Iceland, or a boat trip to the Maldives. A selection of real-life traveller s tales illustrate the pleasure and pain experienced by loggers searching for the elusive perfect wave...|$|E
40|$|When <b>you</b> <b>re</b> {{using your}} mobile device, you can connect to several {{wireless}} networks {{at the same}} time, such as 3 G (HSPA) / 4 G (LTE) and WiFi. These links could be used {{at the same time}} to increase the download speed or make streaming of video more reliable. These links introduce differences in delay and TCP should fail if you simply try to aggregate them at the network layer because this will also introduce network reordering in relation to the difference in network delay. There are several existing solutions out there that tries to fix this, but if you simply use Linux and transparently send packets over two different network links which has a large difference in network delay, you will notice that the TCP connection can maintain a high throughput which corresponds to the sum of possible throughput for both links. A patch from August 2013 has made the situation even better, but how does it work? In this thesis, we have investigated how Linux TCP is robust against network reordering. We have also done extensive testing of Linux TCP s performance where we have transparently sent packets from a TCP connection over two different network paths which differs in both latency and delay...|$|E
