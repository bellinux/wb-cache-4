500|$|Seven men met {{to draft}} the {{invitation}} to the Protestant Dutch Stadtholder, William, Prince of Orange, to invade England and assume the throne. The signatories to the letter included Whigs, Tories, and the Bishop of London, Henry Compton, who assured the Prince that, [...] "Nineteen parts of twenty of the people... are desirous of change". William needed no further encouragement. Although the invitation was not signed by Churchill (he was not, as yet, of sufficient political rank to be a signatory), he declared his intention through William's principal English contact in The Hague – [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> anything else that I ought to doe, you have but to command me". Churchill, like many others, was looking for an opportune time to desert James.|$|E

2500|$|I {{put myself}} in the (Those who fear {{expansion}} of Government control) group, and do not {{hide the fact that}} I have a clear bias on Anthropogenic global warming (AGW). [...] My bias is based on fear of Government expansion and the observation of AGW data presentation fraud – not based on financial or any other personal benefit. [...] I merely have found that the closer you look at the data and alarmists’ [...] presentations, the more fraud you find and the less <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> an AGW problem... For decades, as a professional experimental test engineer, I have analyzed experimental data and watched others massage and present data. [...] I became a cynic; My conclusion – “if someone is aggressively selling a technical product whose merits are dependent on complex experimental data, he is likely lying”. [...] That is true whether the product is an airplane or a Carbon Credit.|$|E

2500|$|On 11 August 2010, at {{a public}} forum Tony Abbott was asked a {{question}} about his views on {{the absence of an}} R18+ rating for video games and whether he has any policies relating to the subject. His reply was if the Coalition won the upcoming election he would be happy to examine the issue of an R18+ classification rating for video games. Although he admitted he did not know there had been a debate on the issue [...] "If what happens with video games is not roughly analogous to what happens in other areas, that seems silly," [...] he said. He added [...] "Instinctively I'm with you, and it's something I'd be happy to look at, if we are in Government," [...] finishing off with [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a problem, I would be happy to look at it." [...] However the Liberal/National coalition led by Abbott did not win government, the Australian Labor Party retaining power through a coalition with Green and Independent members.|$|E
2500|$|In {{reference}} to Gore's alleged conflict of interest, {{some critics have}} labeled Gore a [...] "carbon billionaire." [...] In response to these criticisms Gore stated that it is “certainly not true” {{that he is a}} “carbon billionaire” and that he is [...] "proud to put my money where my mouth is for the past 30 years.

[...] Gore was challenged on this topic by Tennessee Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn who asked him: [...] "The legislation that we are discussing here today, is that something {{that you are going to}} personally benefit from?” Gore responded by stating: [...] "I believe that the transition to a green economy is good for our economy and good for all of us, and I have invested in it." [...] Gore also added that all earnings from his investments have gone to the Alliance for Climate Protection and that [...] "If you believe that the reason I have been working on this issue for 30 years is because of greed, you don’t know me."

I am proud of it." ...|$|E
