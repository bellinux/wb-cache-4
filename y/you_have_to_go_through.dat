If we're talking about the 'new me,' that's it and why it's {{at the end of}} the record. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> those things and make the changes you have to make and be there and go, 'Okay, I did it.' It doesn't come that easy. [...] I just didn't hold back this time, and writing that way has made me feel really purified, like I've actually gotten a chance to break through instead of just wallowing in all of my problems. It's not about all the times that I've been afraid and tormented and sad, it's about looking at those situations and stomping them out. It feels really good to sing these songs now." ...|$|E

In June 1951, she finally secured the return of Alexis by agreeing to cancel her receivership action and divorce suit in California in return for a divorce [...] "guaranteed by L. Ron Hubbard". She met him in Wichita to resolve the situation. He told her that she was [...] "in a state of complete madness" [...] due to being dictated to and hypnotized by Hollister and his [...] "communist cell". Playing along, she told Hubbard that he was right and that the only way she could break free of their power was by going through with the divorce. He replied, [...] "You know, I'm a public figure and you're nobody, so if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> the divorce, I'll accuse you of desertion so it won't look so bad on my public record."

500|$|Following its release, {{multiple}} critics {{found that}} the lyrics alluded to her turbulent high profile relationship with Canadian recording artist Justin Bieber. However, Gomez insisted that the song wasn't about [...] "one specific person". During an interview with Nicole Mastrogiannis of iHeartRadio, the singer explained {{the meaning of the}} album track-by-track, saying that [...] "Sober" [...] was about being blinded by love in an unhealthy relationship: [...] "It's easy to run away from your feelings, but I have to understand, and people need to understand, that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> everything. You have to feel it. You gotta get through the other side as best as you can, and everyone has been in that situation where you can't help it. Even if it's not even that, it's like love drunk in a way." [...] In her analysis of the song, Alexis Rhiannon of Bustle wrote that [...] "as soon as [...] heard those lyrics, my brain started racing through the options of who this could be? Could it be about Justin Bieber, like I'm almost sure [...] "Camouflage" [...] is?" [...] Richard Braxter of Popology Now expressed doubt over Gomez's claims that the song wasn't about someone specific, saying: [...] "We’re sure there’s some weight to that, but we can’t help but think there’s some hints of Justin Bieber in this track." ...|$|E

"I don't {{know much}} about those matters, but I do know that it takes about five years' grinding, and what is called 'walking the hospitals,' that is, going round the wards with the surgeons, before one is {{licensed}} to kill.

I really don't know which of the places was the worst; the big department stores or the separate places for jewelry and toys and books and stationery and antiques; they were all alike, and all maddening. And the rain outside, and everybody coming in reeking; though I don't believe that sunshine would have been any better; there'd have been more of them. I declare, it made my heart ache for those poor creatures behind the counters, and I don't know whether I suffered most for them when they kept up a ghastly cheerfulness in their attention or were simply insulting in their indifference. I know they must be all dead by this time. 'Going up?' 'Going down?' 'Ca-ish!' 'Here, boy!' I believe it will ring in my ears as long as I live. And the whiz of those overhead wire things, and having to wait ages for your change, and then drag your tatters out of the stores into the streets!
