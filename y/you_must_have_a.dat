In the case of the carousel, the kinetic discussion would involve perhaps a study of the walker's shoes and the friction they need to generate against the floor of the carousel, or perhaps the dynamics of skateboarding, if the walker switched to travel by skateboard. Whatever the means of travel across the carousel, the forces calculated above must be realized. A very rough analogy is heating your house: <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> certain temperature to be comfortable, but whether you heat by burning gas or by burning coal is another problem. Kinematics sets the thermostat, kinetics fires the furnace.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Action,' replied Schulembourg, 'is the {{exercise}} of our faculties. Do not mistake restlessness for action. Murillo, who passed a long life almost {{within the walls of}} his native city, was a man of great action. Witness the convents and the churches that are covered with his exploits. A great student is a great actor, and as great as a marshal or a statesman. <b>You</b> <b>must</b> act, Mr. Walstein, <b>you</b> <b>must</b> act; <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> object in life; great or slight, still <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> object.

2500|$|... "Upright to {{the point}} of priggishness, he fined all who swore in his presence", {{according}} to Charles Carlton, a biographer of Charles I, who describes Henry as an [...] "obdurate Protestant". In addition to the alms box to which Henry forced swearers to contribute, he made sure his household attended church services. His religious views were influenced by the clerics in his household, who came largely from a tradition of politicised Calvinism. Henry listened humbly, attentively, and regularly to the sermons preached to his household, and once told his chaplain, Richard Milbourne, that he esteemed most the preachers whose attitude suggested, [...] "Sir, you must hear me diligently: <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> care to observe what I say." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hastings {{represents}} the traditional English gentleman—not too bright but absolutely scrupulous, {{a throwback to}} the Victorian-era gentleman who is always concerned about [...] "fair play". Hastings himself notes that he is somewhat old-fashioned. While Poirot, who is not above lying, surreptitiously reads other people's letters or eavesdrops, Hastings is horrified of such acts and usually refuses to perform them to help Poirot in one of his cases. Although he lacks Poirot's intellect, Poirot often compliments Hastings' ability to remember facts and details about their cases even if he deplores the manner in which Hastings tells the story at times. Hastings' physical appearance is rarely described in the novels because he is often the narrator. However, it is mentioned that he, like Poirot, has a moustache which becomes a target of the detective's criticism in Peril at End House: 'And your moustache. If <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> moustache, let it be a real moustache, a thing of beauty such as mine.' Although he has served in the army, Hastings is not a ruthless man by nature, with Poirot noting during his final letter to Hastings in Curtain that he knows that Hastings is not a murderer.|$|E
