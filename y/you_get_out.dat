500|$|Governor John Hampton was so {{confident}} of the arrangements, he was heard {{to say to}} Moondyne Joe: [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> again, I'll forgive you". However, the rock broken by Moondyne Joe was not removed regularly, and eventually a pile grew up until it obscured the guard's view of him below the waist. Partially hidden behind the pile of rocks, he occasionally swung his sledgehammer at the limestone wall of the prison. On 7 March 1867, Moondyne Joe escaped through a hole he had made in the prison wall. A {{few days before the}} second anniversary of his escape, Moondyne Joe was recaptured, returned to prison, and sentenced to an additional four years in irons. Eventually, Governor Frederick Weld heard of his predecessor Hampton's promise, and decided that further punishment would be unfair. Moondyne Joe was given a ticket of leave in May 1871.|$|E
500|$|On March 30, 2003, {{ten weeks}} before release, an unmastered version of Hail to the Thief {{containing}} unfinished tracks was leaked online. Jonny Greenwood wrote on Radiohead's official forum: [...] "We're kind of pissed off about it, to be honest... Work we've not finished, being released in this sloppy way, ten {{weeks before the}} real version is even available... It's not [...] I'm pissed off about, it's just the situation I guess. It's stolen work, fer fuck's sake." [...] Colin Greenwood said the leak was [...] "like being photographed with one sock on when <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> {{of bed in the}} morning," [...] but expressed dismay at the cease-and-desist orders sent by label EMI to radio stations and fan sites playing the leaked tracks, saying: [...] "Don't record companies usually pay thousands of dollars to get stations to play their records? Now they're paying money to stations not to play them." ...|$|E
500|$|Christman {{contacted}} the Scientology critics based in Clearwater, and arranged flight transportation to Florida. She {{arrived at the}} airport in California to find that her flight was cancelled. Her former supervisor, Janet Weiland, was waiting for her close to the ticket counter, and tried to convince her to remain in the organization. Christman eventually got on a flight to Tampa, Florida, but was met at the gate when she arrived by agents of Scientology. Tampa police were notified, and escorted Christman safely away from the Scientologists. While a member of Scientology, Christman had given over $1 million to the organization; she used her inheritance money to pay for coursework. She commented to the St. Petersburg Times of Florida about the thought process she underwent after leaving the organization, [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> and you get the whole thing, you're like, 'What was I thinking?'. I know the people inside are brainwashed and they're laughing at me. But to me, the truth is, I'm free. I can do what I want. I can say what I want." ...|$|E

500|$|Despite being {{promoted}} as the show's heart and moral conscience, {{the flaws in}} Gwen's own morality are explored throughout the series; a press release noted that she is both selfless and selfish. The first series sees Gwen embark on a brief affair with colleague Owen Harper. Executive producer Russell T Davies explains that the episode [...] "Countrycide" [...] was deliberately structured {{in order to make}} the affair seem inevitable as Gwen struggles to cope with Torchwood life. For Davies, the dalliance is a [...] "human" [...] one, told in an adult manner characterised by [...] "lust and anger and hurt and the joy <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of the initial stages of having an affair". Myles commented that Gwen's compromised morality, as demonstrated by her affair was suitably challenging for a science fiction audience, and served to demonstrate that none of the Torchwood team were [...] "safe" [...] from temptation. Writer Stephen James Walker argues that Gwen's moral ambiguity made her a more compelling character. Since she was introduced as an audience surrogate, Walker claimed it would have been an easy trap to make her a [...] "one-dimensional paragon of virtue". Instead, the writers made Gwen more [...] "realistic" [...] by giving her [...] "distinct human failings", which Walker felt made her [...] "arguably the most complex and interesting of the five regulars". He identified these failures as her [...] "tendency towards egotism", [...] "self-righteousness", and [...] "selfishness", evident in her [...] "highly questionable treatment" [...] of boyfriend Rhys Williams. Walker cited her affair with Owen as an example, as well as the scene in [...] "Combat" [...] where she confesses this betrayal to Rhys after dosing him with the amnesia drug Retcon so he won't remember.|$|E

[...] But after a time, callers would {{regularly}} try to elicit this response, so he's stopped replying this way routinely. Hartmann ends each show with the phrase, [...] "Activism begins with you, democracy begins with <b>you.</b> <b>Get</b> <b>out</b> there, get active! Tag, you're it!" ...|$|E

Representative Miller estimated that the exchange lasted for about ten seconds. She told the Investigative Subcommittee that she did not at any point ask Representative Smith to change his vote on the Medicare legislation.|$|E

Don Rosa, a subsequent cartoonist of Donald Duck, described his placement of the imaginary town: [...] "I won't bother to say precisely where I situated Duckburg and Calisota on America's west coast... but if <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> a good map and compare the coastline, you'll see that I stuck the old gold-prospector's adopted hometown directly across the bay from a very appropriately named actual city." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, Knight reprised {{the role}} of Ruth in Pirates with the Lyric Opera of Chicago. [...] Chicago radio host Bruce Duffie, {{interviewing}} Knight after seeing that production noted, [...] "Gillian Knight {{is one of those}} great personalities who simply go about their business season after season, giving splendid renditions of various roles, and adding luster to their home companies while not going far afield very often and, thus, passing up the opportunity for real world-wide stardom". During that interview, Knight said, [...] "I'm getting a bit controversial here, but there is a snobbish attitude towards Gilbert and Sullivan in the opera world.... I believe in excellence. [...] Now I believe that if Gilbert and Sullivan is done well... then it is excellent, and it should be in a [...] house". [...] She advised audiences, [...] "Don't close your mind to anything because somebody has said, 'Oh, this is Gilbert and Sullivan,' or, 'This is modern music.' [...] Just keep an open mind and you may be surprised at how much <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of it".|$|E
2500|$|About ninety animators {{worked on}} the film {{at one point or}} another; some {{worked on the}} project for as long as two years. [...] In terms of the film's {{animation}} style and settings, the film combines Eastern world culture (predominantly Japanese) with Western world culture (predominantly California). In May 2013, Disney released concept art and rendered footage of San Fransokyo from the film. San Fransokyo, the futuristic mashup of San Francisco and Tokyo, was described by Hall as [...] "an alternate version of San Francisco. Most of the technology is advanced, but much of it feels retro … Where Hiro lives, it feels like the Haight. I love the Painted ladies. We gave them a Japanese makeover; we put a cafe on the bottom of one. They live above a coffee shop." [...] According to production designer Paul Felix, [...] "The topography is exaggerated because what we do is caricature, I think the hills are 1½ times exaggerated. I don't think you could really walk up them … When you get to the downtown area, that's when you get the most Tokyo-fied, that pure, layered, dense kind of feeling of the commercial district there. When <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of there, it becomes more San Francisco with the Japanese aesthetic. … (It's a bit like) Blade Runner, but contained to a few square blocks. You see the skyscrapers contrasted with the hills." ...|$|E

2500|$|Many Nisei {{worked to}} prove {{themselves}} as loyal American citizens. Of the 20,000 Japanese Americans {{who served in the}} Army during World War II, [...] "many Japanese-American soldiers had gone to war to fight racism at home" [...] and they were [...] "proving with their blood, their limbs, and their bodies that they were truly American". It was not only men either, some one hundred Nisei women volunteered for the WAC (Woman's Army Corps), where, after undergoing rigorous basic training, they had assignments as typists, clerks, and drivers. Satoshi Ito, an internment camp survivor, reinforces the idea of the immigrants’ children striving to demonstrate their patriotism to the United States. He notes that his mother would tell him, [...] "‘you’re here in the United States, you need to do well in school, you need to prepare yourself to get a good job when <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> into the larger society’". He said she would tell him, [...] "‘don’t be a dumb farmer like me, like us’" [...] to encourage Ito to successfully assimilate into American society. As a result, he worked exceptionally hard to excel in school and later became a professor at the College of William & Mary. His story, along with the countless Japanese Americans willing to risk their lives in war, demonstrate the lengths many in their community went to prove their American patriotism.|$|E
