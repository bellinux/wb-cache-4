500|$|In 2012, Madonna {{released}} her twelfth studio album, MDNA. The lead single, [...] "Give Me All Your Luvin'", and subsequent releases from the album were not {{added to the}} Radio 1 playlist, despite the former featuring rappers Nicki Minaj and M.I.A., two artists who receive regular rotation on the station. Radio 1 DJ Scott Mills defended their decision not to play Madonna saying, [...] "I don't think we play Madonna any more. There {{is a lot of}} research, and if <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>a</b> 17-year-old about her, they go 'don't care' [...] it's a sign of the times, things change, it's a generational thing. I like Madonna, does a 17-year-old? [...] probably not {{at the top of their}} list. And that's horrible, but that is the way it is [...] and also youth audiences are so fickle in what they like and what they don't like, and they're quite opinionated, you just have got to keep on top of that." ...|$|E

2500|$|Several {{sources have}} {{postulated}} that the track [...] "Last to Die", with its chorus of [...] "Who'll {{be the last}} to die for a mistake/Whose blood will spill, whose heart will break", was inspired by Vietnam Veterans Against the War representative (and future senator and presidential candidate) John Kerry's 1971 testimony to the U.S. Senate, in which he asked [...] "How do <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>a</b> man {{to be the last}} man to die in Vietnam? How do <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>a</b> man to be the last man to die for a mistake?".|$|E

"DEAR SIR--When you did me {{the favor}} of calling here a few days since, <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> <b>a</b> {{question}} relating to my governess, Miss Gwilt, which I thought rather a strange one at the time, and which caused, as you may remember, a momentary embarrassment between us.|$|R

2500|$|When {{someone asks}} a Muslim scholar about {{performing}} a specific action, the reply {{will be a}} fatwa explaining which of these five categories this action would fall under. So if <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>a</b> Muslim scholar to give a fatwa about adultery, they {{would tell you that}} it is [...] "Not Permitted". If you ask about fasting in Ramadan, they would answer that it is [...] "Obligatory". Muslims are usually encouraged to ask for reasoning and evidence behind any fatwa, and should avoid blindly following the opinions of Muslim scholars without understanding the reasons behind them. This is because Muslims should always feel that they are practicing Islam to gain the pleasure of God, and not to gain the pleasure of acceptance of any human being.|$|E
2500|$|US and India {{continue}} to differ on {{issues ranging from}} trade to civil liberties. The Indian Home Ministry, through an affidavit submitted to the Delhi High Court on 13 February 2015, claimed that Country Reports on Rights & Practices have become instruments of foreign policy: [...] "The US, UK and EU have clearly mentioned in government documents and pronouncements that these reports are made {{for the purpose of}} their being used as instruments of foreign policy." [...] The affidavit also claimed that the reports by US, UK and European Parliament were biased since they [...] "do not provide opportunity to the Government of India or the local embassy/high commission to record their opinion and are heavily biased against the targeted country". The 2014 State Department’s annual Trafficking in Persons (TIP) report appeared to classify the Khobragade incident as an example of human trafficking, stating: [...] "An Indian consular officer at the New York consulate was indicted in December 2013 for visa fraud related to her alleged exploitation of an Indian domestic worker." [...] In response, India has shown no urgency to allow visits to India by the newly appointed US anti-people trafficking ambassador Susan P. Coppedge and the US special envoy for LGBT rights Randy Berry. Under Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code homosexuality is illegal in India. Indian Ambassador to the USA, Arun K.Singh reiterated India's commitment to work within an international framework to tackle the problem of trafficking but rejected any [...] "unilateral assessments" [...] by another country saying [...] "We will never accept it" [...] and downplayed the importance of the visits: [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>a</b> U.S. official when somebody will be given a visa, they always say ‘we will assess when visa is applied for.’ ... I can do no better than to reiterate the U.S. position." ...|$|E
5000|$|Another {{etymology}} {{states that}} michelada is a portmanteau of mi chela helada. The word chela {{is a popular}} term for a beer in Mexico. When <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> for <b>a</b> chela, <b>you</b> are <b>asking</b> for <b>a</b> cold beer; therefore the phrase mi chela helada means [...] "my ice cold beer".|$|R

But when <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> <b>a</b> question, a minute ago, {{it seemed the}} most natural thing in the world to answer you.
