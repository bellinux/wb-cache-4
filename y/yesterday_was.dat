500|$|Although Clark {{had left}} the Byrds prior to {{completion}} of the Fifth Dimension album, he did participate in the recording of the songs [...] "Eight Miles High" [...] and [...] "Captain Soul" [...] from that record. [...] As a result, Younger Than <b>Yesterday</b> <b>was</b> the first album to be entirely recorded by the Byrds without Clark's participation. [...] As on Fifth Dimension, guitarists Jim McGuinn and David Crosby continued to hone their songwriting skills {{in an attempt to}} fill the void left by Clark's departure.|$|E

500|$|After Gram Parsons' departure, McGuinn and Hillman {{decided to}} recruit noted session guitarist Clarence White as a {{full-time}} member of the band in late July 1968. [...] White, who had contributed countrified guitar playing to every Byrds' album since 1967's Younger Than <b>Yesterday,</b> <b>was</b> brought in at Hillman's suggestion as someone who could handle the band's older rock repertoire and their newer country-oriented material. [...] Shortly after his induction into the band, White began to express dissatisfaction with drummer Kevin Kelley and soon persuaded McGuinn and Hillman to replace him with Gene Parsons (no relation to Gram), who White had previously played with in the country rock band Nashville West.|$|E
500|$|Released on February 6, 1967, the Byrds' fourth album, Younger Than <b>Yesterday,</b> <b>was</b> {{more varied}} than its {{predecessor}} and saw the band successfully mixing psychedelia with folk rock and country and western influences. [...] Although it received generally positive reviews upon its release, the album was, to a degree, overlooked by the record-buying public and consequently peaked at number 24 on the Billboard chart and number 37 on the UK Albums Chart. [...] However, music expert Peter Buckley {{has pointed out that}} although the album may've passed the Byrds' rapidly shrinking teen audience by, it found favor with [...] "a new underground following who disdained hit singles, but were coming to regard albums as major artistic statements." ...|$|E
500|$|Crosby's ambitions {{for artistic}} control within the band were {{expanding}} {{along with his}} compositional skill, and the resulting turmoil would ultimately lead to his dismissal from the group during recording sessions for the Byrds' next album, The Notorious Byrd Brothers. [...] One source of discontent for Crosby during the recording of Younger Than <b>Yesterday</b> <b>was</b> related to the Bob Dylan cover [...] "My Back Pages". [...] The song had been suggested as a suitable vehicle for the Byrds by their manager, Jim Dickson, but since {{it was the fourth}} song from Dylan's Another Side of Bob Dylan album that the band had covered, Crosby felt that recording [...] "My Back Pages" [...] was formulaic and a step backwards artistically. [...] However, since the album's release, critics have praised the song as one of the Byrds' strongest Dylan interpretations.|$|E

500|$|Although Younger Than <b>Yesterday</b> <b>was</b> {{somewhat}} {{overlooked by}} the record-buying public {{at the time}} of its release, achieving only moderate chart success as a result, its critical stature has grown substantially over the years. [...] In his 2003 book Eight Miles High: Folk-Rock's Flight from Haight-Ashbury to Woodstock, Richie Unterberger states that Younger Than Yesterday [...] "was [...] best album besides Mr. Tambourine Man, and more progressive in many ways." [...] The author goes on to say that the album and its follow-up are [...] "now revered as two of the great 1960s albums by historians and fans", while also acknowledging that [...] "at the time, though, the Byrds were considered by many to be waning." [...] Unterberger also praised the album in his review for the AllMusic website, describing it as one of [...] "the most durable of the Byrds' albums".|$|E
500|$|The American {{rock band}} The Byrds {{released}} {{a recording of}} [...] "My Back Pages" [...] on February 6, 1967, {{as part of their}} fourth album, Younger Than Yesterday. The title of Younger Than <b>Yesterday</b> <b>was</b> itself directly inspired by the song's refrain of [...] "Ah, but I was so much older then/I'm younger than that now." [...] "My Back Pages" [...] was subsequently issued as a single by The Byrds on March 13, 1967, with the version included on the single being a radio edit that omitted the song's second verse, {{in order to reduce the}} playing time from 3:08 to 2:31. The single reached #30 on the Billboard Hot 100 but failed to chart in the United Kingdom. [...] "My Back Pages" [...] was the last single by The Byrds to reach the Top 40 of the U.S. charts.|$|E
500|$|Crosby also {{fought to}} have the song [...] "Why" [...] (co-written with McGuinn) {{included}} on the album, despite it having already been issued as the B-side of the band's [...] "Eight Miles High" [...] single, some eleven months earlier. [...] However, the version of [...] "Why" [...] included on Younger Than <b>Yesterday</b> <b>was</b> recorded during sessions for that album and is a totally different take from the previously released B-side version. [...] Exactly why Crosby insisted on resurrecting the song, when there was newer original material in reserve, remains a mystery, although the Byrds' roadie, Jimmi Seiter, has speculated {{that it was an}} attempt to increase Crosby's share of the songwriting on the album. [...] Author Peter Lavezzoli has commented that [...] "Why" [...] features verses with a chord structure reminiscent of [...] "(Love Is Like a) Heat Wave" [...] by Martha and the Vandellas and a raga-flavored lead guitar solo inspired by the music of sitarist Ravi Shankar. [...] However, Rogan has noted that the song's Indian classical music influences were considerably watered down on the re-recorded version that appeared on Younger Than Yesterday when compared to the earlier B-side recording.|$|E

[...] The Columbia/Legacy reissue featured six bonus tracks, including [...] "Lady Friend" [...] and [...] "Old John Robertson", which had both been issued on a non-album single in July 1967. [...] The remastered CD also included the David Crosby-penned track [...] "It Happens Each Day", which had been omitted from the original album, and [...] "Don't Make Waves", a song that had been written and recorded by the Byrds for the 1967 Alexander Mackendrick film Don't Make Waves. [...] The final track on the Columbia/Legacy CD extends to include a hidden track featuring the guitar parts from [...] "Mind Gardens", which were heard on the album playing backwards, but are presented here playing forwards, as they were originally recorded.|$|E
