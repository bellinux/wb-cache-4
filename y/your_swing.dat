6000|$|Presumptuous bard! {{how could}} you dare A woman with a cloud compare? Strange pride and {{insolence}} you show Inferior mortals there below. And is our thunder in your ears So frequent or so loud as theirs? Alas! our thunder soon goes out; And only makes you more devout. Then is not female clatter worse, That drives you not to pray, but curse? [...] We hardly thunder thrice a-year; The bolt discharged, the sky grows clear; But every sublunary dowdy, The more she scolds, the more she's cloudy. [How useful were a woman's thunder, If she, like us, would burst asunder! Yet, though her stays hath often cursed her, And, whisp'ring, wish'd the devil burst her: For hourly thund'ring in his face, She ne'er was known to burst a lace.] [...] Some critic may object, perhaps, That clouds are blamed for giving claps; But what, alas! are claps ethereal, Compared for mischief to venereal? Can clouds give buboes, ulcers, blotches, Or from your noses dig out notches? We leave the body sweet and sound; We kill, 'tis true, but never wound. [...] You know a cloudy sky bespeaks Fair weather when the morning breaks; But women in a cloudy plight, Foretell a storm to last till night. [...] A cloud in proper season pours His blessings down in fruitful showers; But woman was by fate design'd To pour down curses on mankind. [...] When Sirius[2] o'er the welkin rages, Our kindly help his fire assuages; But woman is a cursed inflamer, No parish ducking-stool can tame her: To kindle strife, dame Nature taught her; Like fireworks, she can burn in water. [...] For fickleness how durst you blame us, Who for our constancy are famous? You'll see a cloud in gentle weather Keep the same face an hour together; While women, {{if it could be}} reckon'd, Change every feature every second. [...] Observe our figure in a morning, Of foul or fair we give you warning; But can you guess from women's air One minute, whether foul or fair? [...] Go read in ancient books enroll'd What honours we possess'd of old. [...] To disappoint Ixion's[3] rape Jove dress'd a cloud in Juno's shape; Which when he had enjoy'd, he swore, No goddess could have pleased him more; No difference could he find between His cloud and Jove's imperial queen; His cloud produced a race of Centaurs, Famed for a thousand bold adventures; From us descended ab origine, By learned authors, called nubigenae; But say, what earthly nymph do you know, So beautiful to pass for Juno? [...] Before Æneas durst aspire To court her majesty of Tyre, His mother begg'd of us to dress him, That Dido might the more caress him: A coat we gave him, dyed in grain, A flaxen wig, and clouded cane, (The wig was powder'd round with sleet, Which fell in clouds beneath his feet) With which he made a tearing show; And Dido quickly smoked the beau. [...] Among your females make inquiries, What nymph on earth so fair as Iris? With heavenly beauty so endow'd? And yet her father is a cloud. We dress'd her in a gold brocade, Befitting Juno's favourite maid. [...] 'Tis known that Socrates the wise Adored us clouds as deities: To us he made his daily prayers, As Aristophanes declares; From Jupiter took all dominion, And died defending his opinion. By his authority 'tis plain You worship other gods in vain; And from your own experience know We govern all things there below. You follow where we please to guide; O'er all your passions we preside, Can raise them up, or sink them down, As we think fit to smile or frown: And, just as we dispose your brain, Are witty, dull, rejoice, complain. [...] Compare us then to female race! We, to whom all the gods give place! Who better challenge your allegiance Because we dwell in higher regions. You find the gods in Homer dwell In seas and streams, or low as Hell: Ev'n Jove, and Mercury his pimp, No higher climb than mount Olymp. Who makes you think the clouds he pierces? He pierce the clouds! he kiss their a--es; While we, o'er Teneriffa placed, Are loftier by a mile at least: And, when Apollo struts on Pindus, We see him from our kitchen windows; Or, to Parnassus looking down, Can piss upon his laurel crown. [...] Fate never form'd the gods to fly; In vehicles they mount the sky: When Jove would some fair nymph inveigle, He comes full gallop on his eagle; Though Venus be as light as air, She must have doves to draw her chair; Apollo stirs not out of door, Without his lacquer'd coach and four; And jealous Juno, ever snarling, Is drawn by peacocks in her berlin: But we can fly where'er we please, O'er cities, rivers, hills, and seas: From east to west the world we roam, And in all climates are at home; With care provide you as we go With sunshine, rain, and hail, or snow. You, when it rains, like fools, believe Jove pisses on you through a sieve: An idle tale, 'tis no such matter; We only dip a sponge in water, Then squeeze it close between our thumbs, And shake it well, and down it comes; As you shall to your sorrow know; We'll watch your steps where'er you go; And, since we find you walk a-foot, We'll soundly souse your frieze surtout. [...] 'Tis but by our peculiar grace, That Phoebus ever shows his face; For, when we please, we open wide Our curtains blue from side to side; And then how saucily he shows His brazen face and fiery nose; And gives himself a haughty air, As if he made the weather fair! 'Tis sung, wherever Celia treads, The violets ope their purple heads; The roses blow, the cowslip springs; 'Tis sung; but we know better things. 'Tis true, a woman on her mettle Will often piss upon a nettle; But though we own she makes it wetter, The nettle never thrives the better; While we, by soft prolific showers, Can every spring produce you flowers. [...] Your poets, Chloe's beauty height'ning, Compare her radiant eyes to lightning; And yet I hope 'twill be allow'd, That lightning comes but from a cloud. [...] But gods like us have too much sense At poets' flights to take offence; Nor can hyperboles demean us; Each drab has been compared to Venus. We own your verses are melodious; But such comparisons are odious. [Observe the case--I state it thus: Though you compare your trull to us, But think how damnably you err When you compare us clouds to her; From whence you draw such bold conclusions; But poets love profuse allusions. And, if you now so little spare us, Who knows how soon you may compare us To Chartres, Walpole, or a king, If once we let you have <b>your</b> <b>swing.</b> Such wicked insolence appears Offensive to all pious ears. To flatter women by a metaphor! What profit could you hope to get of her? And, for her sake, turn base detractor Against your greatest benefactor. [...] But we shall keep revenge in store If ever you provoke us more: For, since we know you walk a-foot, We'll soundly drench your frieze surtout; Or may we never thunder throw, Nor souse to death a birth-day beau. [...] We own your verses are melodious; But such comparisons are odious.] ...|$|E

50|$|Titleist {{works closely}} with Diamana and Aldila shafts and allows the golfer to choose from various shafts that best fit into <b>your</b> <b>swing.</b> Listed below are the {{possible}} options of shafts.|$|E
50|$|Stiffness is {{much less}} complex {{than the other two}} topics. This is {{directly}} and solely tied to <b>your</b> <b>swing</b> speed. The faster the swing, the stiffer the shaft. This is because the faster you swing, the more the club will bend; if the club bends too much, it will whip through impact and the face will be square for a very short time. Stiffer shafts don't flex as much and keep the face squarer through contact. The other side is less stiff shafts will produce a higher ball speed off the face. So the goal is to get the most flexible shaft that fits <b>your</b> <b>swing,</b> but stiff enough so it doesn't hurt your control. This is why it is important that you make sure you are swinging the right shafts for you. Possible options are junior, women, senior, regular, stiff, and xstiff.|$|E

50|$|The flex point is, simply, {{where the}} shaft bends. While {{this may seem}} like an easy concept, the flex point of the club has {{a huge impact on}} the flight of the ball. Shafts that have a flex point closer to the head tend to have more of a draw bias than those that have ones near the grip. However, this whip-like flex near the head {{produces}} a faster club head speed. The idea is to find a point that fits <b>your</b> <b>swing</b> in regards to the face being square while maximizing the club head speed.|$|E
50|$|The right stance {{not only}} allows for proper alignment, {{but also for}} a {{balanced}} swing, prepared usage of the proper muscles, and the maximum strength and control over <b>your</b> <b>swing.</b> We align our body to the target only after we have aligned the club head to the target. A proper stance starts with your feet being aligned at the target, followed by your knees, hips and shoulders. Your feet should be shoulder width apart, your front foot should be slightly opened towards the target and your back foot should be perpendicular to the target. As you increase in club, your stance should widen for further stability. Your shoulders will be naturally open to the target line because your arms are not at equal length while holding the club. Make sure to close your shoulders slightly to stay aligned with the target line. The proper stance affects how controlled the backswing is, governs the amount of hip turn in the backswing, and allows for the hips to clear through the downswing. Your front arm should be extended at all times to allow the club to travel in its maximum arc.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Stability {{control for}} walking bipeds has been consid-ered a complex task. Even {{two-dimensional}} fore-aft stability in dy-namic walking {{appears to be}} difficult to achieve. In this paper we prove the contrary, starting from the basic belief that in nature sta-bility control must be the sum of a number of very simple rules. We study the global stability of the simplest walking model by deter-mining the basin of attraction of the Poincaré map of this model. This shows that the walker, although stable, can only handle very small disturbances. It mostly falls, either forward or backward. We show that it is impossible for any form of swing leg control to solve backward falling. For the problem of forward falling, we de-vise a simple but very effective rule for swing leg action: “You will never fall forward if you put <b>your</b> <b>swing</b> leg fast enough in front of your stance leg. In order to prevent falling backward the next step, the swing leg shouldn’t be too far in front. ” The effectiveness of this rule is demonstrated with our prototype “Mike. ” Index Terms—Legged locomotion, passive dynamic walking, re-flex, swing leg control.
