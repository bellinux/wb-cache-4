50|$|Marine {{life can}} be {{explored}} by participating {{in a variety of}} snorkeling activities. There are miles of coral reefs on Staniel Cay and neighbouring islands and Cays. The waters surrounding the islands are clear and shallow, making snorkeling easy for first-timers, but a variety of places exist for more experienced divers. Grottos can be found around the island, including Thunderball grotto which is a natural limestone cavern which can be entered underwater or at low tide. Light enters through a vaulted ceiling and a variety of sea-life swim in the water below, including the purple parrotfish, <b>yellowtail</b> <b>snappers,</b> Angelfish and Sergeant Majors. The island is surrounded by shallow reefs within a few feet of the surface. Farther out from the islands, the waters are cluttered with thousands of shallow water sites, coral heads, and reefs. Snorkeling does not require the specialized technique, training and gear which means it is available from many activity providers, including hotels, lodges and resorts on and around Staniel Cay. Alternatively, local snorkeling guides can provide the information for independent snorkeling adventures.|$|R
40|$|In {{tropical}} coastal ecosystems, several {{fish and}} invertebrate species utilize inshore seagrass beds and mangroves during their juvenile stage before migrating as adults to coral reefs. Measuring the actual contribution of these nursery habitats to reef populations remains a major challenge. Fish otoliths (earbones) are very useful as natural tags {{due to their}} permanent recordings of environmental factors. Signatures of stable carbon and oxygen isotopes that are incorporated into otoliths vary regionally in surface waters, and thus reflect differences in water composition among habitats, making them suitable to trace earlier residence areas of fish. In this study, we determined the stable carbon and oxygen isotope signatures in the juvenile margin of otoliths of adult <b>yellowtail</b> <b>snappers</b> (Ocyurus chrysurus) from coral reefs, and compared these to the signatures in otoliths of juvenile fish collected in different nursery embayments harboring seagrass beds, to trace the origin of individual reef fishes. Unique in our approach is that our experimental reef fish represent a complete population {{on the scale of}} an entire island, and that all potential nurseries were sampled. Of all adult reef fish caught, 97 % were identified as having resided as juveniles in one of the seagrass nurseries, yet different bays contributed unequally to the adult population. Additionally, we combined these data with a spatial simulation model that showed that adult dispersal away from reef areas near the mouth of bays was limited. These findings show that the spatial distribution of nursery areas and their productivity are important drivers of population dynamics, and can lead to a source-sink structure in a closed demersal fish population on the reef. Understanding source-sink dynamics of marine animals is of major importance for the design and placement of marine reserves, especially when life stages utilize spatially different habitats and sourcesink dynamics occur within life stages...|$|R
5000|$|For culinary, sanitary, and {{aesthetic}} reasons, the minimum quality and freshness of fish {{to be eaten}} raw must be superior to that of fish {{which is to be}} cooked. Sushi chefs are trained to recognize important attributes, including smell, color, firmness, and freedom from parasites that may go undetected in commercial inspection. Commonly used fish are tuna (maguro, shiro-maguro), Japanese amberjack, <b>yellowtail</b> (hamachi), <b>snapper</b> (kurodai), mackerel (saba), and salmon (sake). The most valued sushi ingredient is toro, the fatty cut of the fish. This comes in a variety of ōtoro (often from the bluefin species of tuna) and chūtoro, meaning [...] "middle toro", implying that it is halfway into the fattiness between toro and the regular cut.

40|$|Marine {{aquaculture}} is {{a diverse}} industry {{with a number}} of different culture systems, depending on the location of the operation (subtidal or intertidal) and the species being grown. As a result, the nature and potential for environmental impact can vary greatly. If the aquaculture farm is sited and operated appropriately, the environmental impact can be minimal. For the purposes of this environmental assessment guide, aquaculture is defined as the propagation or rearing of molluscs or finfish in marine waters. When a marine aquaculture proposal does not fall into this definition (e. g. aquaculture on land using seawater) it may require a referral to the Environment Protection Authority (EPA) under Schedule 22 (5) (2) of the Development Regulations 1993.

50|$|Second is {{the patch}} reef community. Patch reefs form {{in shallow water}} (three to six meters deep), some in Hawk Channel and some on the outer reef, but mainly on White Bank between Hawk Channel and the outer reefs. Patch reefs start from corals growing on a hard bottom, but grow upward as new corals {{establish}} themselves on the skeletons of dead corals. Most {{of the structure of}} patch reefs is formed from star (Montastraea annularis, Siderastrea siderea) and brain corals (Diploria spp.). Other corals attach wherever there is an opening. Patch reefs may grow up {{to the surface of the}} water, and spread outwards. Dome-type patch reefs (such as Hen and Chickens), found in Hawk Channel and on White Bank, are round or elliptical, and are generally less than three meters high, but may reach up to nine meters high. Dome-type patch reefs are surrounded by sand which is kept clear due to browsing by long-spined sea urchins and grass-eating fish. Linear-type patch reefs are found on the outer reefs, and are linear or curved. They occur in single or multiple rows, trending the same direction as the bank reefs on the outer reefs. Linear-type patch reefs often include Elkhorn coral, which is rare on the dome-type patch reefs. As dead coral skeletons age and are weakened by the activities of boring sponges, worms, and mollusks and by wave action, parts of a patch reef may collapse. Patch reefs provide habitat for spiny lobsters and for many species of fish, including Bluehead wrasse (Thalassoma bifasciatum), damselfish (Chromis spp.), Ocean surgeon, French and Queen angelfish (Pomacanthus spp.), White, Caesar and Spanish grunts (Haemulon ssp.), <b>Yellowtail</b> and other <b>snappers,</b> Redband and Stoplight parrotfish (Sparisoma ssp.), Sergeant major (Abudefduf saxatilis), Tomtate (Haemulon aurolineatum), Trumpetfish (Aulostomus maculatus), filefish, groupers, snappers, Bar jack (Caranx ruber), Great barracuda, pufferfish, squirrelfish, cardinalfish, and green morays (Gymnothorax funebris).|$|R

Através da análise do incremento marginal, foi verificada a formação anual de uma zona translúcida a partir do final do outono e durante o inverno. Foram observadas ciobas de 2 a 19 anos. Os comprimentos furcais (CF) médios retrocalculados variaram de 108 mm para idade 1 a 524 mm para idade 19. A equação de Von Bertalanffy ajustada aos CF médios retrocalculados foi CFt = 567, 1 (1 - e - 0. 130 (t + 0. 773)).

40|$|Creel and trawl {{surveys of}} Biscayne Bay {{were carried out}} in 1982 - 1983 to assess {{commercial}} fish and macro-invertebrate habitats and fisheries. Dredged and/or barren bottom was dramatically less productive than seagrass, algae or hard bottom areas. Low fish abundance and diversity in north Biscayne Bay appeared to be correlated with high turbidity and low seagrass abundance. Substantive increases in fish and crustacean productivity in north Biscayne Bay will occur only if seagrass communities can be re-established. Deeper dredged areas in North Bay will not likely become recolonized with seagrass even if turbidity levels are reduced. Hard bottom areas in South Bay are associated with high diversity of fish fauna and serve as nursery areas for several highly desirable species (e. g. hogfish, <b>yellowtail</b> <b>snapper,</b> lane snapper).

40|$|In {{the present}} study, five loci (mitochondrial and nuclear) were sequenced to {{determine}} the genetic diversity, population structure, and demographic history of populations of the <b>yellowtail</b> <b>snapper,</b> Ocyurus chrysurus, found {{along the coast of}} the western South Atlantic. O. chrysurus is a lutjanid species that is commonly associated with coral reefs and exhibits an ample geographic distribution, and it can therefore be considered a good model for the investigation of phylogeographic patterns and genetic connectivity in marine environments. The results reflected a marked congruence between the mitochondrial and nuclear markers as well as intense gene flow among the analyzed populations, which represent a single genetic stock along the entire coast of Brazil between the states of Pará and Espírito Santo. Our data also showed high levels of genetic diversity in the species (mainly mtDNA), as well a major historic population expansion, which most likely coincided with the sea level oscillations {{at the end of the}} Pleistocene.

Both species are heavily exploited in the region. Our objective was to characterize site fidelity and movement behavior along the reef tract {{to the north and}} south of the release point. Fishes were collected by baited hook and line from the surface, surgically-tagged with coded-acoustic transmitters, and returned to the reef by snorkelers. Tracking of fish movement behavior was conducted by five acoustic receivers deployed on the seafloor from Davis Reef in the south to Pickles Reef in the north. Fishes were tracked for up to eight months. Results indicated that the majority of signal detections for individual fish from both species were recorded at the two Conch Reef receivers. Limited movement from Conch Reef to Davis Reef was recorded, but no signal detections were recorded at the two sites to the north of Conch Reef. These results suggest that both species show site fidelity to Conch Reef. Future studies will seek to characterize this site fidelity with increased temporal and spatial resolution at Conch Reef.

40|$|Populations of Ocyurus chrysurus were {{compared}} genetically and morphometrically along the West Atlantic coast {{to test the}} null hypothesis of population homogeneity in the area. Brazilian populations {{were found to be}} differentiated in shape (canonical variates analysis; F[48, 515] = 10. 84, p < 0. 0001). Analyses of mitochondrial DNA sequences (663 bp of the control region) did not show any differences between Brazilian populations but could detect differences between Brazilian and Caribbean (Belize) populations. The samples from Pernambuco differed significantly from the other Brazilian populations in allozyme frequencies (11 loci; FST = 0. 167; p < 0. 05), but this may have resulted from the small number of samples analysed for that population. Sequence variation of Belize samples departed from neutral expectations (Fu’s FS =- 8. 88; p < 0. 001). A mismatch distribution analysis points to an ancient population expansion in that area. We conclude that the genetic data do not allow the rejection of the null hypothesis of panmixia for Brazil-ian <b>yellowtail</b> <b>snapper</b> populations which should be treated as a single genetic stock, with a latitudinal gradient on their morphology which probably results from phenotypic plasticity.

40|$|Mesophotic coral {{ecosystems}} (MCEs; reefs 30 - 150 m depth) are {{of increased}} research interest {{because of their}} potential role as depth refuges from many shallow reef threats. Yet few studies have identified patterns in fish species composition and trophic group structure between MCEs and their shallow counterparts. Here we explore reef fish species and biomass distributions across shallow to upper-MCE Caribbean reef gradients (5 - 40 m) around Utila, Honduras, using a diver-operated stereo-video system. Broadly, we found reef fish species richness, abundance and biomass declining with depth. At the trophic group level we identified declines in herbivores (both total and relative community biomass) with depth, mostly driven by declines in parrotfish (Scaridae). Piscivores increased {{as a proportion of}} the community with increased depth while, in contrast to previous studies, we found no change in relative planktivorous reef fish biomass across the depth gradient. In addition, we also found evidence of ontogenetic migrations in the blue tang (Acanthurus coeruleus), striped parrotfish (Scarus iserti), blue chromis (Chromis cyanea), creole wrasse (Clepticus parrae), bluehead wrasse (Thalassoma bifasciatum) and <b>yellowtail</b> <b>snapper</b> (Ocyurus chrysurus), with a higher proportion of larger individuals at mesophotic and near-mesophotic depths than on shallow reefs.

40|$|This study {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} a survey designed to provide economic information about the financial status of commercial reef fish boats with homeports in the Florida Keys. A survey questionnaire was administered in the summer and fall of 1994 by interviewers in face-to-face meetings with owners or operators of randomly selected boats. Fishermen were asked for background information about themselves and their boats, their capital investments in boats and equipment, and about their average catches, revenues, and costs per trip for their two most important kinds of fishing trips during 1993 for species in the reef fish fishery. Respondents were characterized with regard to their dependence on the reef fish fishery as a source of household income. Boats were described in terms of their physical and financial characteristics. Different kinds of fishing trips were identified by the species that generated the greatest revenue. Trips were grouped into the following categories: <b>yellowtail</b> <b>snapper</b> (Ocyurus chrysurus); mutton snapper (Lutjanus analis), black grouper (Mycteroperca bonaci), or red grouper (Epinephelus morio); gray snapper (Lutjanus griseus); deeper water groupers and tilefishes; greater amberjack (Seriola dumerili); spiny lobster (Panulirus argus); king mackerel (Scomberomorus cavalla); and dolphin (Coryphaena hippurus). Average catches, revenues, routine trip costs, and net operating revenues per boat per trip and per boat per year were estimated for each category of fishing trips. In addition to its descriptive value, data collected during this study will aid in future examinations of the economic effects of various regulations on commercial reef fish fishermen.
