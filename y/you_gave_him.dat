500|$|In early July 1778, the Prussian general Johann Jakob von Wunsch (1717–1788) {{crossed into}} Bohemia near the {{fortified}} town of Náchod with several hundred men. The local garrison, commanded by Friedrich Joseph, Freiherr (Baron) von Nauendorf, then a rittmeister (captain of cavalry), included only fifty hussars. Despite the poor numerical odds, Nauendorf sallied out to engage Wunsch's men. When his small force reached Wunsch's, he greeted the Prussians as friends; {{by the time}} the Prussians were close enough to realize the allegiance of the hussars, Nauendorf and his small band had acquired the upper hand. Wunsch withdrew; the next day, Nauendorf was promoted to major. In a letter to her son, the [...] Empress Maria Theresa [...] wrote: [...] "They say you were so pleased with Nauendorf, a rookie from Carlstadt or Hungary, who killed seven men, that <b>you</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> twelve ducats." ...|$|E

[...] According to Stoller, the duo was [...] "surprised at the kind of knowledge that he had about black music. We figured that he had these remarkable pipes and all that, but we didn't realize that he knew {{so much about the}} blues. We were quite surprised to find out that he knew as much about it as we did. He certainly knew a lot more than we did about country music and gospel music." [...] Leiber remembered the recording process with Presley, [...] "He was fast. Any demo <b>you</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> he knew by heart in ten minutes." [...] As Stoller recalled, Presley [...] "was 'protected'" [...] by his manager and entourage. [...] "He was removed. ... They kept him separate." ...|$|E

500|$|It is Day 15, October 6, 2004, and Claire {{wakes up}} from nightmares two {{nights in a}} row, screaming. In the first, Claire wakes to find herself no longer pregnant, as she walks into the forest and {{encounters}} John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) at a table, playing cards. She asks him why he is there, but Locke interrupts, telling her [...] "He was your responsibility, but <b>you</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> away, Claire. Everyone pays the price now." [...] Locke looks up with one white and one black eye. She hears crying and finds a baby crib. After unfolding several layers of material she dips her hands into {{a pool of blood}} and then wakes screaming; she has injured her hands by digging her nails deeply into her palms. In the second dream, someone holds Claire down and injects something into her stomach, though she has no wound.|$|E
500|$|In early July 1778, the Prussian General Johann Jakob von Wunsch (1717–1788) {{crossed into}} Bohemia near the {{fortified}} town of Náchod, {{in the opening}} action of the War of the Bavarian Succession. Nauendorf had only 50 Hussars, but they sallied from their garrison to engage the larger Prussian force. Encountering Wunsch, Nauendorf greeted the old Prussian general and his men as friends; {{by the time the}} Prussians realized the allegiance of the Hussars, Nauendorf and his small force had acquired the strategic advantage. Following a brief skirmish, Wunsch withdrew. The next day Nauendorf was promoted to major. In a letter to her son, Joseph, the Empress Maria Theresa wrote: [...] "They say you are so pleased with the rookie Nauendorf, the Carlstätter or Hungarian who killed seven men, that <b>you</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> 12ducats." [...] Enamored with the possibility of acquiring Bavaria, Joseph encouraged successful raids against the Prussian troops. On 7August 1778, with two squadrons of his regiment, Nauendorf led a raid against a Prussian convoy at Biebersdorf in the County of Kladsko. The surprised convoy surrendered, and Nauendorf captured its officers, 110men, 476horses, 240wagons of flour, and 13transport wagons.|$|E

2500|$|In 1991 Bjelke-Petersen faced {{criminal}} trial for perjury {{arising out of}} the evidence he had given to the Fitzgerald inquiry (an earlier proposed charge of corruption was incorporated into the perjury charge). Bjelke-Petersen's former police Special Branch bodyguard Sergeant Bob Carter told the court that in 1986 he had twice been given packages of cash totalling $210,000 at the premier's office. He was told {{to take them to}} a Brisbane city law firm and then watch as the money was deposited in a company bank account. The money had been given over by developer Sng Swee Lee, and the bank account was in the name of Kaldeal, operated by Sir Edward Lyons a trustee of the National Party. John Huey, a Fitzgerald Inquiry investigator, later told Four Corners: [...] "I said to Robert Sng, 'Well what did Sir Joh say to you when <b>you</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> this large sum of money?' And he said, [...] "All he said was, 'thank you, thank you, thank you'." [...] The jury could not agree on a verdict. In 1992 it was revealed that the jury foreman, Luke Shaw, {{was a member of the}} Young Nationals and was identified with the [...] "Friends of Joh" [...] movement. A special prosecutor announced in 1992 there would be no retrial because Bjelke-Petersen, then aged 81, was too old. Developer Sng Swee Lee refused to return from Singapore for a retrial. Bjelke-Petersen said his defence costs sent him broke.|$|E
