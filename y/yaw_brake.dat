5000|$|Roller Bearing - Brake (Semi-active system): The nacelle {{is mounted}} on a roller bearing and it is free to rotate towards any direction, but when the {{necessary}} orientation is achieved an active <b>yaw</b> <b>brake</b> arrests the nacelle. This prevents the uncontrolled vibration and reduced gyroscopic and fatigue loads.|$|E
50|$|A {{compromise}} that offers several advantages {{is the use}} of electric yaw brakes. These replace the hydraulic mechanism of the conventional brakes and with electro-mechanically actuated brake calipers. The use of electric yaw brakes eliminates the complexity of the hydraulic leakages and the subsequent problems that these cause to the <b>yaw</b> <b>brake</b> operation.|$|E
5000|$|The roller yaw bearing is {{a common}} {{technical}} yaw bearing solution followed by many wind turbine manufacturers as it offers low turning friction and smooth rotation of the nacelle. The low turning friction permits the implementation of slightly smaller yaw drives (compared to the gliding bearing solution), {{but on the other}} hand requires a <b>yaw</b> <b>braking</b> system.|$|R
50|$|Some {{manufacturers}} use {{a plurality}} of smaller yaw drives (usually six) to facilitate easy replacement. Such a configuration with plurality of yaw drives often offers the possibility of active <b>yaw</b> <b>braking</b> using differential torque from the yaw drives. In this case half of the yaw drives apply a small mount of torque for clockwise rotation {{and the other half}} apply torque in the opposite direction and then activate the internal magnetic brakes of the electric motor. In this way the pinion-gear rim backlash is eliminated and the nacelle is fixed in place.|$|R

5000|$|Gliding yaw bearing - Electric yaw drive: The nacelle {{is mounted}} on a {{friction}} based gliding bearing and the azimuth rotation is achieved via a plurality of powerful electric drives. The need for a <b>yaw</b> <b>brake</b> is eliminated and {{depending on the size}} of the yaw system (i.e. size of the wind turbine) the gliding bearing concept can lead to significant cost savings.|$|E
50|$|To {{solve this}} problem, yaw systems {{incorporate}} pre-tensioned gliding bearings. These bearings have gliding pads that are pressed via pressure elements against the gliding disk {{to stabilize the}} nacelle against undesirable movement. The pressure elements can be simple steel springs, pneumatic, or hydraulic pre-tension elements, etc. The use of pneumatic or hydraulic pre-tension elements allows active control of the yaw bearing pre-tension, which provides <b>yaw</b> <b>brake</b> function.|$|E
50|$|The {{disk brake}} {{requires}} a flat circular brake disk and plurality of brake calipers with hydraulic pistons and brake pads http://svendborg-brakes.dk/uk/products/brakes/active_brakes.html. The hydraulic yaw brakes {{are able to}} fix the nacelle in position thus relieving the yaw drives from that task. The cost however of the <b>yaw</b> <b>brake</b> {{in combination with the}} requirement of a hydraulic installation (pump, valves, pistons) and its installation in the vicinity of brake pads sensitive to lubricant contamination is often an issue.|$|E
50|$|The sensors {{monitored}} {{as inputs}} for the brake system include the wheel speed sensors, traction battery state of charge, <b>yaw</b> sensor, <b>brake</b> pedal, stroke sensor, steering wheel angle, hydraulic actuator pressure, hydraulic pressures of each wheel caliper circuit, and accelerator position. Other information and inputs are also monitored.|$|R
30|$|WTGs {{are used}} to extract the kinetic energy from the wind and then convert it into electricity. Wind {{turbines}} usually rotate at a speed of 3 – 30  miles/h. WTGs system normally consists of wind turbine, generator, grid interface converters, wind blades, <b>yaw</b> control, <b>brake,</b> gear box, control device, and an anemometer, etc.|$|R

5000|$|Roller yaw bearing - Hydraulic yaw drive: The nacelle {{is mounted}} on a roller bearing and the azimuth {{rotation}} is achieved via a plurality of powerful hydraulic motors or ratcheting hydraulic cylinders. The benefit of the yaw system with hydraulic drives {{has to do with}} the inherent benefits of the hydraulic systems such as the high power-to-weight ratio and high reliability. On the downside however the hydraulic systems are always troubled by leakages of hydraulic fluid and clogging of their high pressure hydraulic valves. The hydraulic yaw systems often (depending on the system design) also allow for the elimination of the <b>yaw</b> <b>brake</b> mechanism and their replacement with cut-off valves.|$|E
50|$|The active yaw {{systems are}} {{equipped}} {{with some sort of}} torque producing device able to rotate the nacelle of the wind turbine against the stationary tower based on automatic signals from wind direction sensors or manual actuation (control system override). The active yaw systems are considered to be {{the state of the art}} for all the modern medium and large sized wind turbines, with a few exceptions proving the rule (e.g. Vergnet). The various components of the modern active yaw systems vary depending on the design characteristics but all the active yaw systems include a means of rotatable connection between nacelle and tower (yaw bearing), a means of active variation of the rotor orientation (i.e. yaw drive), a means of restricting the rotation of the nacelle (<b>yaw</b> <b>brake)</b> and a control system which processes the signals from wind direction sensors (e.g. wind vanes) and gives the proper commands to the actuating mechanisms.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{wind turbine}} design and {{manufacturing}} companies experiment with alternative yaw breaking methods {{in order to}} eliminate the drawbacks of the existing systems and {{to reduce the cost}} of the system. One of these alternatives involves the use of air pressure in order to achieve the necessary yaw braking moment. In this case, some of the gliding surface (usually the axial, due to higher available surface) is utilized in order to accommodate the <b>yaw</b> <b>brake</b> pads and the pneumatic brake mechanism. The pneumatic actuator can be a conventional pneumatic cylinder or even a flexible air chamber which inflates when supplied with pressurized air. Such a device is able to exert very high braking forces due to the high active surface. This is achieved with a simple industrial air pressure compression system (...) which is a reliable and low cost solution. Furthermore, in the even of leakage, the environmental impact is practically zero compared to hydraulic oil leakages. Finally brake actuators can be produced with very low cost from lightweight plastic materials thus significantly reducing the overall cost of the system.|$|E

40|$|During maximum braking {{the average}} ratio of drag-force {{friction}} coefficient {{developed by the}} antiskid system to maximum drag-force friction coefficient available at the tire/runway interface was higher on dry surfaces than on wet surfaces. The gross stopping power generated by the brake system on the dry surface was {{more than twice that}} obtained on the wet surfaces. With maximum braking applied, the average ratio of side-force friction coefficient developed by the tire under antiskid control to maximum side-force friction available at the tire/runway interface of a free-rolling yawed tire was shown to decrease with increasing <b>yaw</b> angle. <b>Braking</b> reduced the side-force friction coefficient on a dry surface by 75 percent as the wheel slip ratio was increased to 0. 3; on a flooded surface the coefficient dropped to near zero for the same slip ratio. Locked wheel skids were observed when the tire encountered a runway surface transition from dry to flooded, {{due in part to the}} response time required for the system to sense abrupt changes in the runway friction; however, the antiskid system quickly responded by reducing brake pressure and cycling normally during the remainder of the run on the flooded surface...|$|R
30|$|According to Lin et al. (2016), {{their study}} {{considers}} three primary configurations and failure statistic analysis of wind turbines in China. This paper summarizes {{the failures of}} wind turbine components, such as frequency converters, generators, gearboxes, pitch systems, <b>yaw</b> systems, blades, <b>braking</b> systems and sub-synchronous machines. Although there are many failure types and various causes, we can deduce four primary reasons for these failures: lack of core technologies; inferior quality due to price competition; design standards and wind farm climate differences; and no mandatory quality certification and exterior factors, such as wind farm construction, power grids and maintenance. Finally, while aiming to improve the reliability, a reliability management method {{with regard to the}} design, manufacturing and maintenance of wind turbines was proposed.|$|R
40|$|Tidal {{power is}} a growing {{industry}} {{in the world but}} particularly in the United Kingdom. Many companies have started the race to achieve a cheap and efficient tidal turbine design. For instance, Tidal Energy Limited has opted for an innovative design by incorporating three horizontal axis turbines in a triangular frame that will be lying on the seabed. This project is called “DeltaStream” and a test device will be placed in Ramsey Sound, in the Welsh coast. The design of the project includes a yawing mechanism capable to turn the nacelle around the vertical axis in order for the turbines to face the tidal flow. This mechanism maximizes the power production as the tidal speed changes in direction every 6 hours. But it has another function. Due to the tidal speeds and the water density, the torque created in the rotor is very large. As Tidal Energy Ltd. has opted for an optimized blade design with no blade pitching mechanism, the only way to decrease the huge rotor torque in order to stop it is by the yawing of the nacelle away from the flow. However, it is believed by the author of this thesis that the yawing mechanism can be improved in system redundancy terms, in relation with the important role that accomplishes in the overall turbine design. The present thesis is an analysis of the weakest points of the current yaw system design and an investigation in an alternative to be cheaper, simpler and improved in reliability terms. The proposed design uses motors with reduction planetary gearboxes attached to the nacelle to drive the gear ring fixed on the tower structure. The new design is believed to be more reliable than the original due to the high level of redundancy. Nevertheless, it is not as cheap as expected due to a very expensive <b>yaw</b> <b>brake</b> system. In that point, the author recommends further investigation in the price reduction of that component without decreasing the level of brake fixation...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{proposes a}} control {{system based on}} fuzzy logic control theory to improve the vehicle {{handling}} and lateral stability by combined control of four-wheel steering and active braking. A fuzzy logic controller, with the yaw rate error and side-slip angle error as inputs and with the corrective yaw moment and rear steering angle as outputs, is developed to follow the desired yaw rate and side-slip angle generated by the reference model. A side-slip angle estimator based on the dynamic vehicle model and kinematic vehicle model is designed. To generate the corrective <b>yaw</b> moment, the <b>brake</b> torque is properly distributed to the effective wheel. The proposed control system is evaluated under various driving conditions, e. g. lane change manoeuvre and step steer manoeuvre.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to design a brake control {{algorithm}} for meeting the driver`s steering will during AEB in operation. When the driver recognizes obstacles suddenly, the driver steers abruptly during AEB in operation. At this time it is difficult to generate sufficient lateral tire force depending on the driver`s steering input because AEB uses the maximum tire force in longitudinal direction. The proposed AEB control algorithm calculates desired deceleration by using relative distance, velocity of vehicle model and desired <b>yaw</b> rate for <b>brake</b> control using the driver model with steering wheel angle. Finally, the algorithm makes the brake force distributed for heading to direction which driver wants to go. The proposed algorithm is validated by using the computer simulation software, CarSim and MATLAB/Simulink. ? ??? ??????? ? ??????????? ICT????????????? ????? ?????.

40|$|Basically, {{there are}} two main {{techniques}} to control the vehicle yaw moment. First method is the indirect yaw moment control, which works on the basis of active steering control (ASC). The second one being the direct yaw moment control (DYC), which is based on either the differential braking or the torque vectoring. An innovative idea for the direct yaw moment control is introduced by using an active controller system to supervise the lat-eral dynamics of vehicle and perform as an active yaw moment control system, denoted as the stabilizer pendulum system (SPS). This idea has further been developed, analyzed, and implemented in a standalone direct yaw moment control system, as well as, in an inte-grated vehicle dynamic control system with a differential <b>braking</b> <b>yaw</b> moment controller. The effectiveness of SPS has been evaluated by model simulation, which illustrates its superior performance especially on low friction roads. [DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 4027499]...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{wind energy}} plays {{a vital role}} in the world {{renewable}} energy scenario. The modern wind turbine system has a complex and repairable components due to sophistication and centralized control. The failure characteristics of the onshore wind turbines depend on the terrain conditions. In the main mountain pass and hill area, there is a heavy uncertainty in the wind that is due to the frequent change in the direction of wind and the change in the velocity. It causes a rapid failure in the individual sub assemblies. There is a substantial need for improving the reliability in the stages of design, manufacturing, operation and maintenance. Normally the infant mortality failures are more in the onshore wind turbine and the failure rate is constant during normal operating period. It is a surprise that the failure rate has rapidly increased during normal operating period of the wind turbines placed exactly in the mountain pass and hilly area due to the high uncertainty in the wind. This paper deals with reliability analysis of major components of wind turbine system and its sub system such as rotor system, gear box, brake system, generator, hydraulic system and yaw system. This paper also investigates the reliability of wind turbines and its sub assemblies placed at Aramboly pass in India by using Weibull software as reliability tool for a grid connected 250 kW wind turbine. This analysis yields some surprising results about some sub assembly like <b>yaw</b> system, <b>brake</b> system and generator which are most unreliable...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper aims at {{presenting}} {{the interest of}} the Linear Parameter Varying methods for vehicle dynamics control, in particular when some actuators may be in failure. The cases of the semi-active suspension control problem and the <b>yaw</b> control using <b>braking,</b> steering and suspension actuators will be presented. In the first part, we will consider the semi-active suspension control problem, where some sensors or actuator (damper leakage) faults are considered. From a quarter-car vehicle model including a non linear semi-active damper model, an LPV model will be described, accounting for some actuator fault represented as some varying parameters. A single LPV fault-tolerant control approach is then developed to manage the system performances and constraints. In the second part the synthesis of a robust gain-scheduled H 1 MIMO vehicle dynamic stability controller (VDSC), involving front steering, rear braking, and four active suspension actuators, is proposed to improve the yaw stability and lateral performances. An original LPV method for actuator coordination is proposed, when the actuator limitations and eventually failures, are taken into account.

40|$|Abstract. Vehicle {{stability}} in 4 wheel drive(4 WD) vehicles has been pursued by torque split based technology and brake based technology. The brake based methods are essentially brake maneuver strategies using the active {{control of the}} individual wheel brake. By comparison, the torque split based technologies realize stability by varying the traction torque split through powertrain to create an offset yaw moment. In the 4 WD hybrid electric vehicle adopting separate front and rear motor, the vehicle stability enhancement algorithm using the rear motor control has some advantages such as faster response, braking energy recuperation, etc. However, since {{the left and right}} wheels are controlled by the same driving and regenerative torque from one motor, stability enhancement only by the front and rear motor control has a limitation in satisfying the required offset yaw moment. Therefore, to obtain the demanded offset <b>yaw</b> moment, a <b>brake</b> force distribution at each wheel is required. In this paper, a vehicle stability control logic using the front and rear motor and electro-hydraulic brake(EHB) is proposed for a 4 WD hybrid electric vehicle. A fuzzy control algorithm is suggested to compensate the error of the sideslip angle and the yaw rate by generating the direct yaw moment. Performance of the vehicle stability control algorithm is evaluated using ADAMS and MATLAB Simulink co-simulation...|$|R
40|$|The main {{aim of this}} {{research}} project is to extend theories of four-wheel-steering as developed by J. Ackermann to include an individually steered four-wheel steering system for passenger vehicles. Ackermann’s theories, including theories available in this subject area, dwell much on vehicle system dynamics developed from what is called single track model and some call it a bicycle model. In the bicycle model, the front two wheels are bundled together. Similarly, the rear wheels are bundled together. The problem with {{this is that it}} assumes two front wheels or two rear wheels to be under the same road, vehicle and operating conditions. The reality on the ground and experiments that are conducted are to the contrary. Therefore this study discusses vehicle disturbance rejection through robust decoupling of yaw and lateral motions of the passenger vehicle. A mathematical model was developed and simulated using Matlab R 2008 b. The model was developed {{in such a way that}} conditions can be easily changed and simulated. The model responded well to variations in road and vehicle conditions. Focus was in the ability of the vehicle to reject external disturbances. To generate <b>yaw</b> moment during <b>braking,</b> the brake on the left front wheel was disconnected. This was done because lateral wind generators, as used by Ackermann, were not available.
