5000|$|One of {{the first}} {{philosophers}} to write {{on the theme of}} divine hiddenness was Anselm of Canterbury, who in his Proslogion links it to an existential or spiritual concern: I have never seen thee, O Lord my God; I do not know thy form.

He pants to see <b>thee,</b> <b>and</b> thy face is too far from him. He longs to come to <b>thee,</b> <b>and</b> thy dwelling place is inaccessible. He is eager to find <b>thee,</b> <b>and</b> knows not thy place. He desires to seek <b>thee,</b> <b>and</b> does not know thy face. Lord, thou art my God, and thou art my Lord, yet never have I seen thee. It is thou that hast made me, and hast made me anew, and hast bestowed upon me all the blessings I enjoy; and not yet do I know thee. Finally, I was created to see <b>thee</b> <b>and</b> not yet have I done that for which I was made.|$|R
