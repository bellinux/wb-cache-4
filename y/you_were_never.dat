25|$|You speak truly, O Achilli, and {{we cannot}} answer you a word. You are a Priest; {{you have been}} a Friar; you are, it is undeniable, the scandal of Catholicism, and the palmary {{argument}} of Protestants, by your extraordinary depravity. You have been, it is true, a profligate, an unbeliever, and a hypocrite. Not many years passed of your conventional life, and <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>never</b> in the choir, always in private houses, so that the laity observed you. You were deprived of your professorship, we own it; you were prohibited from preaching and hearing confessions; you were obliged to give hush-money to the father of one of your victims, as we learned from an official document of the Neapolitan Police to be 'known for habitual incontinency;' your name came before the civil tribunal at Corfu for your crime of adultery. You have put the crown on your offences, by as long as you could, denying them all; you have professed to seek after truth, when you were ravening after sin.|$|E

500|$|... "Scream" [...] {{is a song}} {{primarily}} {{directed at}} the tabloid press. As {{far back as the}} late 1980s, Jackson and the press had a difficult relationship. In 1986, the tabloids ran a story claiming that Jackson slept in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber to slow the aging process; he was pictured lying down in a glass box. When Jackson bought a pet chimpanzee called Bubbles, it was reported as evidence of increasing detachment from reality. It was reported that Jackson had offered to buy the bones of Joseph Merrick (the [...] "elephant man"). However, Jackson stated the story is untrue in both an interview with Oprah and an interview with Martin Bashir in Take Two - The Footage <b>You</b> <b>Were</b> <b>Never</b> Meant To See. Still, these stories inspired the pejorative nickname [...] "Wacko Jacko", which Jackson acquired the following year and would come to despise. He stopped leaking untruths to the press, so the media began making up their own stories.|$|E
500|$|Farrell exalted the lyricism of the song, {{stating that}} [...] "Sophie's music has never sounded so lyrically rich" [...] and her [...] "storytelling skills" [...] were visible in it. Considine named the song a [...] "welcome break from lullabies (such as 'The Deer and the Wolf') that risk monotony" [...] on the album. Conversely, AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine {{described}} [...] "Love Is a Camera" [...] as a [...] "bogged down in pretension" [...] moment in Wanderlust; Erlewine {{went on to}} criticize the song's [...] "ceaseless pomp". Kate Bennett of musicOMH wrote that [...] "Love Is a Camera" [...] was [...] "more of the same" [...] "heroine-gazing-forlornly-into-the-distance." [...] She elaborated, [...] "You'd {{have to have a}} heart of cold, igneous rock not to enjoy [...] just a little, but if <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>never</b> a member of your local youth theatre company the sticky-sweetness of it all quickly becomes cloying." [...] The song peaked at number 32 on the UK Airplay Chart, while on the UK Indie chart it reached number 33.|$|E

2500|$|She {{returned}} in triumph to Columbia Pictures and {{was cast in}} the musical You'll Never Get Rich (1941) opposite Fred Astaire {{in one of the}} highest-budgeted films Columbia had ever made. The picture was so successful, the studio produced and released another Astaire-Hayworth picture the following year, <b>You</b> <b>Were</b> <b>Never</b> Lovelier. Astaire's biographer Peter Levinson writes that the dancing combination of Astaire and Hayworth was [...] "absolute magnetism on the screen." [...] Although Astaire made 10 films with Ginger Rogers, his other main dancing partner, Hayworth's sensuality surpassed Rogers's cool technical expertise. [...] "Rita's youthful exuberance meshed perfectly with Fred's maturity and elegance," [...] says Levinson.|$|E
2500|$|Yankees Manager Joe McCarthy, {{struggling}} {{to control his}} emotions, then spoke of Lou Gehrig, {{with whom he had}} a close, almost father-and-sonlike bond. After describing Gehrig as [...] "the finest example of a ballplayer, sportsman, and citizen that baseball has ever known", McCarthy could stand it no longer. Turning tearfully to Gehrig, the manager said, [...] "Lou, what else can I say except that it was a sad {{day in the life of}} everybody who knew you when you came into my hotel room that day in Detroit and told me you were quitting as a ballplayer because you felt yourself a hindrance to the team. My God, man, <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>never</b> that." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{his last}} Hollywood musicals, Kern worked with several new and {{distinguished}} partners. With Johnny Mercer for <b>You</b> <b>Were</b> <b>Never</b> Lovelier (1942), he contributed [...] "a set of memorable songs to entertain audiences until the plot came to its inevitable conclusion". The film starred Astaire and Rita Hayworth and included the song [...] "I'm Old Fashioned". [...] Kern's next collaboration was with Ira Gershwin on Cover Girl starring Hayworth and Gene Kelly (1944) for which Kern composed [...] "Sure Thing","Put Me to the Test," [...] "Make Way for Tomorrow" [...] (lyric by E. Y. Harburg), and the hit ballad [...] "Long Ago (and Far Away)". [...] For the Deanna Durbin Western musical, Can't Help Singing (1944), with lyrics by Harburg, Kern [...] "provided the best original score of Durbin's career, mixing operetta and Broadway sounds in such songs as 'Any Moment Now,' 'Swing Your Partner,' 'More and More,' and the lilting title number." [...] "More and More" [...] {{was nominated for}} an Oscar.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't believe," [...] said Mrs. Tristram, [...] "that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>never</b> angry. A man {{ought to}} be angry sometimes, and <b>you</b> <b>are</b> neither good enough nor bad enough always to keep your temper." ...|$|R

2500|$|He won his Yorkshire cap in 1970, but {{was twice}} forced to remodel his off-break bowling action {{after he was}} {{suspended}} in 1972, and again in 1978. [...] "It was a bad time because <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>never</b> allowed to defend yourself," [...] said Cope. [...] "A committee met and made a decision, which was then passed on down the lines. You didn’t know who was on that committee or what they thought. But Dickie Bird {{and a lot of}} other people have said, 'Geoff, there's nothing wrong; if you were guilty, then an awful lot of others were.' I think that's a fair comment; it was just one of those periods." [...] Cricket writer, Colin Bateman, noted that [...] "Geoff Cope's career was blighted by suspicions that his off-spinner's action was illegal and twice – in 1972 and 1978 – he was suspended by Lord's. The second suspension came after he had broken through into the Test side the previous winter in Pakistan, where he came tantalisingly close to a debut hat-trick".|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to the Bashir documentary, a second video was aired called [...] "Take Two" [...] or [...] "The Footage <b>You</b> <b>Were</b> <b>Never</b> Meant to See". It includes Bashir praising Michael's qualities as a father and his relationships with children in general, while in the Bashir documentary, {{he says he is}} [...] "disturbed" [...] by Michael's relationships with children. Further, an interview with the family was filmed on the night of February 19, 2003, in videographer Hamid Moslehi's home. This part of the production was never aired because Moslehi refused to hand it over following a financial dispute with Jackson. It was found by police in a search of Moslehi's home in November 2003, and it showed the accuser's family praising Jackson, with the accuser insisting no molestation had occurred and that Jackson was [...] "innocent". Gavin Arvizo, his sister Davellin, brother Star, and mother Janet were [...] "upfront" [...] and said that inappropriate behavior had [...] "absolutely not occurred" [...] while also calling him a father figure. They also insisted that although they had slept in Jackson's bed, Jackson himself always slept on the floor. To further the rebuttal, Janet Arvizo issued the statement: ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{made two}} {{pictures}} with Rita Hayworth, {{the daughter of}} his former vaudeville dance idols, the Cansinos. The first, You'll Never Get Rich (1941), catapulted Hayworth to stardom and provided Astaire his third on-screen opportunity to integrate Latin American dance idioms into his style (the first being with Ginger Rogers in [...] "The Carioca" [...] number from Flying Down to Rio (1933) and the second, again with Rogers, was the [...] "Dengozo" [...] dance from The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle (1939)), taking advantage of Hayworth's professional Latin dance pedigree. His second film with Hayworth, <b>You</b> <b>Were</b> <b>Never</b> Lovelier (1942), was equally successful and featured a duet to Kern's [...] "I'm Old Fashioned," [...] which became the centerpiece of Jerome Robbins's 1983 New York City Ballet tribute to Astaire. He next appeared opposite the seventeen-year-old Joan Leslie in the wartime drama The Sky's the Limit (1943), in which he introduced Arlen and Mercer's [...] "One for My Baby" [...] while dancing on a bar counter in a dark and troubled routine. This film, which was choreographed by Astaire alone and achieved modest box office success, represented an important departure for Astaire from his usual charming happy-go-lucky screen persona, and confused contemporary critics.|$|E
