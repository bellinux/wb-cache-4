6000|$|... "That {{is really}} good of you," [...] she said; [...] "and how have you been? <b>You</b> <b>look</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> wan and tired. Have you been doing your own writing?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> sassy to-day, which I take {{is a good}} sign," [...] said Wade. [...] "I've {{got some}} news that will come near to makin' you well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I fancied <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> downcast when <b>you</b> came in," [...] she {{ventured to}} observe, anxious {{to keep away}} from the subject of herself.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, did he so?" [...] cried Harriet. [...] "For demure as you are, Miss Aura, I fancy <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{above the}} diamond shoe-buckles!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Don't say that's all, because--ha--that's not all. You--hum--you think,' said Mr Dorrit, with an accusatory emphasis, 'that I am {{not looking}} well.' 'I thought <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> tired, love.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> like Longstreth," [...] {{finally said}} Mrs. Laramie, [...] "but you're not at ALL like him. You must take after your mother. Miss Longstreth, I don't know if I can--if I ought accept {{anything}} from you. Your father ruined my husband." ...|$|E
6000|$|Her mother said, {{in another}} sense, [...] "I think <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> pulled down," [...] {{and that made}} her and her father laugh again. She got to playing with him, and poking him, and kissing him, {{in the way she}} had with him when she was a girl; it was not so very long ago.|$|E
6000|$|... "Really," [...] {{said the}} Doctor, [...] "one begins to {{understand}} how that beautiful myth of the angels arose. <b>You</b> <b>look</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> hectic, Mr Angel--feverish. Excessive brilliance is almost worse as a symptom than excessive pallor. Curious your name should be Angel. I must send you a cooling draught, if you should feel thirsty in the night...." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm glad to 'ear it," [...] said Mr. Kybird, in a {{somewhat}} reproachful voice, [...] "for your sake; for every-body's sake, though, p'r'aps, I did expect to find <b>you</b> <b>looking</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit down. Ah! it's the wimmen that 'ave the 'arts after all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I thought <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> pale," [...] he said sympathetically, {{and now she}} {{saw that}} he was so. It irritated her that she should be so far from him, in all helpfulness, and she could {{scarcely}} keep down the wish that ached in her heart.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll get it now, mother, if I see <b>you</b> <b>looking</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more jolly; {{and indeed}} things ain't quite so {{bad as they}} seem, for I can pull our little gang through in great shape, though I'm afraid after it's been done I sha'n't {{be able to get}} you and Margie the new outfit I promised." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] said Lady Janet. [...] "Another mystery--eh? And {{another woman}} {{at the bottom of}} it, no doubt. Thank you--that will do--I am {{sufficiently}} answered. No wonder, as a clergyman, that <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> confused. There is, perhaps, a certain grace, under the circumstances, in looking confused. We will change the subject again. You stay here, of course, now you have come back?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Before they enter'd, Baba {{paused to}} hint [...] To Juan some slight lessons as his guide: [...] 'If {{you could just}} contrive,' he said, 'to stint [...] That {{somewhat}} manly majesty of stride, [...] 'T would be as well, and (though there 's not much in 't) [...] To swing a little less from side to side, [...] Which has at times {{an aspect of the}} oddest;-- [...] And also could <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> modest, ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because," [...] she answered, [...] "I {{sometimes}} {{wonder what}} {{there is in the}} world that interests you! Certainly, none of the ordinary things seem to. Tonight, almost for the first time, I saw <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> drawn out of yourself. I was wondering whether it was the music or the people. I suppose, until one gets used to it," [...] she added, looking a little wearily around the house, [...] "an audience like this is worth looking at." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To {{think that}} the moon should be so treacherous," [...] he rejoined imperturbably. [...] "Will <b>you</b> not <b>look</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> closer, fair mistress, the shadows are {{somewhat}} dark, mayhap." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Bob, <b>you</b> are <b>looking</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> pale, {{but so is}} {{everybody}} else; and no wonder, with this heat. But I have not been noticing you, particularly. What do you feel, Bob?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} is about self-empowerment. The chorus {{includes}} the lyrics;"Sometimes <b>you</b> gotta <b>look</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> harder, Sometimes <b>you</b> gotta be, be smarter, Hold on just <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit longer, Just be true to yourself" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So this is {{my niece}} Virginia," [...] he said, holding out both his hands. [...] "I am glad to see you. Take this chair close to me. I am getting an old man, you see, and I have many whims. I like to have any one with whom I am talking almost at my elbow. Now tell me, my dear, what sort of a journey you have had. <b>You</b> <b>look</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> tired, or is it because {{everything}} here is strange to you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, gentlemen," [...] he said genially, [...] "so {{this is the}} end of {{the legend}} of the peacock trees. Sorry to spoil that {{delightful}} traveler's tale, Mr. Paynter, but the joke couldn't be kept up forever. Sorry to put a stop to your best poem, Mr. Treherne, but I thought all this poetry had been going a little too far. So Doctor Brown and I fixed up a little surprise for you. And I must say, without vanity, that <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> surprised." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Deringham, nodding. [...] "We {{grow out}} of them at sixteen in the old country. Of course, Tennyson, Kingsley, Scott. Now I wonder if he would find Elaine a more common type than Vivienne if he went home to Carnaby. Still, if <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more closely, there is {{literature}} which might throw a slightly different light upon the man's character. I notice a bulky volume on soft-wooded trees, somebody on trigonometry, geology in relation to mining, and what I recognize as a standard work on finance and banking." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{all very}} well for the present," [...] said he; [...] "but seriously, I trust that when the first flush of vivacity is over, <b>you</b> will <b>look</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> higher than {{domestic}} endearments and household joys." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>you</b> better <b>look</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> out," [...] were Burke's last words. [...] "If Liz was my {{girl and}} I was {{to sneak out}} to a dance coupled up with an Annie, I'd want a suit of chain armor on under my gladsome rags, all right." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'By Jove, Maisie, <b>you</b> <b>look</b> like <b>a</b> <b>little</b> heathen idol tucked up there.' The eyes {{showed that}} they did not {{appreciate}} the compliment. 'I'm sorry,' he continued. 'The Southern Cross isn't worth looking at unless someone helps you to see. That steamer's out of hearing.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Miss Emily, you shan't {{feel the}} time hang heavy in my company. I can {{converse}} {{on a variety}} of topics, and if there is one thing more than another that I like, it's amusing a pretty young lady. You think me a strange creature, don't you? It's only my high spirits. Nothing strange about me--unless it's my queer Christian name. <b>You</b> <b>look</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> dull, my dear. Shall I begin amusing you before we are on the railway? Shall I tell you how I came by my queer name?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My boy was {{disfigured}} by the blow, {{and this}} villain made his appearance {{the object of}} his jeers. By the way, <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> comical yourself at the present moment, captain, and your colonel would certainly say that you had been getting into mischief. To continue, however, my boy's youth and his destitution--for his pockets were empty--moved the pity of a kind-hearted major, and he advanced him ten Napoleons from his own pocket without security of any kind. Into your hands, Captain Baumgarten, I return these ten gold pieces, since I cannot learn the name of the lender. I am grateful from my heart for this kindness shown to my boy.|$|E
6000|$|GREAT. They will venture: yea, if at {{any time}} any of the King's {{servants}} doth happen to see them, and doth call unto them, {{and tell them that}} they are in the wrong ways, and do bid them beware the danger, then they will railingly return them answer, and say, [...] "As for the word that thou hast spoken unto us {{in the name of the}} King, we will not hearken unto thee; but we will certainly do whatsoever thing goeth forth out of our own mouth." [...] Nay, if <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> farther, you shall see that these ways are warned against enough, not only by these posts, and ditch, and chain, but also by being hedged up; yet they will choose to go there.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, ay; {{you have}} been {{watching}} with one eye asleep, fellow," [...] returned Griffith, [...] "or we should have heard <b>you</b> before! <b>Look</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> north of {{the place where the}} glare of the sun is coming, Miss Plowden, and {{you will be able to}} see our gallant vessel." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think, dear, <b>you</b> are <b>looking</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> better now. I {{will ride}} on. Fortunately {{there is the}} beef tea we made, last night, for Mr. Donald. I will get it made hot, and I will {{get a cup of}} strong tea ready for you. That will do wonders." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By Jove, Maisie, <b>you</b> <b>look</b> like <b>a</b> <b>little</b> heathen idol tucked up there." [...] The eyes {{showed that}} they did not {{appreciate}} the compliment. [...] "I'm sorry," [...] he continued. [...] "The Southern Cross isn't worth looking at unless someone helps you to see. That steamer's out of hearing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Adam," [...] he said, {{in a tone}} of {{friendly}} concession, [...] "you're perhaps right. Perhaps I've gone a little too far in taking notice of the pretty little thing and stealing a kiss now and then. You're such a grave, steady fellow, you don't understand the temptation to such trifling. I'm sure I wouldn't bring any trouble or annoyance on her and the good Poysers on any account if I could help it. But I think <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> too seriously at it. You know I'm going away immediately, so I shan't make any more mistakes of the kind. But let us say good-night"--Arthur here turned round to walk on--"and talk no more about the matter. The whole thing will soon be forgotten." ...|$|E
6000|$|GREAT-HEART. They will venture. Yea, if at {{any time}} any of the King's {{servants}} do happen to see them, and do call unto them, {{and tell them that}} they are in the wrong ways, and do bid them beware the danger, then they will railingly return them answer, and say, 'As for the word that thou hast spoken unto us {{in the name of the}} Lord, we will not hearken unto thee; but we will certainly do whatsoever thing goeth forth out of our own mouth,' &c. (Jer. 44:16, 17). Nay, if <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> further, you shall see that these ways are made cautionary enough, not only by these posts, and ditch, and chain; but also by being hedged up, yet they will choose to go there.[112] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Can't <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{way into}} the future?" [...] Selingman continued, peering through half-closed eyes into his wine glass. [...] "He {{represents}} the only possible link between the only possible political party {{of this country and}} the people. He will win for them in twelve months what they might have waited for through many weary years. He will sit in the high places. History will speak well of him. I will wager you half a dozen pairs of gloves that within a week the Daily Oracle will call him the modern Rienzi. And yet, {{with the end of the}} struggle, with the end of the fierce fighting, comes something--what is it?--disappointment? We have no right to be disappointed, and yet, somehow, one feels that it is the cold and the storm and the wind which keep the best in us--the fighting best--alive." ...|$|E
50|$|I'd {{just been}} riding for Emerica and been with Sole Tech {{for quite a}} while and, uh, and was really {{interested}} in designing clothes, and everybody that I was skating with and hanging around kind of had a style of their own, <b>you</b> know? <b>Looked</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit different from everybody else.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was that}} which induced <b>you</b> to <b>look</b> for <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{relaxation}} at the settlement at my expense," [...] he said. [...] "A trifle paltry, wasn't it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, godfather," [...] said Romola, {{shaking her}} head playfully, [...] "as if it were only bright eyes and soft words that made me love Tito! You know better. You know I love my father and you because you are both good, and I love Tito too because he is so good. I see it, I feel it, in {{everything}} he says and does. And if he is handsome, too, why should I not love him the better for that? It seems to me beauty {{is part of the}} finished language by which goodness speaks. You know you must have been a very handsome youth, godfather,"--she looked up with one of her happy, loving smiles at the stately old man--"you were about as tall as Tito, and you had very fine eyes; only <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> sterner and prouder, and--" ...|$|R
