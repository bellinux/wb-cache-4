500|$|Although {{both were}} {{committed}} O.T.O. members, Northrup's usurpation of Helen's role led to {{conflict between the}} two sisters. The reactions of Parsons and Helen towards Northrup were markedly different. Parsons told Helen to her face that he preferred Northrup sexually: [...] "This {{is a fact that}} I can do nothing about. I am better suited to her temperamentally – we get on well. Your character is superior. You are a greater person. I doubt that she would face what you have with me – or support me as well." [...] Some years later, addressing himself as [...] "You", Parsons told himself that his affair with Northrup (whom he called Betty) marked a key step in his growth as a practitioner of magick: [...] "Betty served to affect a transference from Helen at a critical period ... <b>Your</b> <b>passion</b> for Betty also gave you the magical force needed at the time, and the act of adultery tinged with incest, served as your magical confirmation in the law of Thelema." ...|$|E
500|$|Ben Brantley of The New York Times gave a warm review, {{calling it}} [...] "inspired" [...] and {{comparing}} {{the work to}} other successful recent Broadway musicals: [...] "Like The Full Monty (choreographed by Mr. Mitchell) and Billy Elliot the Musical, it {{is set in a}} hard-times British factory town, where jobs are in jeopardy and spirits need lifting. Like La Cage aux Folles and Priscilla Queen of the Desert, it presents drag queens as the show’s official spirit lifters. And like Hairspray, the musical this production most resembles in tone, Kinky Boots is about finding <b>your</b> <b>passion,</b> overcoming prejudice and transcending stereotypes." [...] Brantley wrote that Lauper's [...] "love- and heat-seeking score" [...] wowed with her [...] "trademark ... mix of sentimentality and eccentricity", and that the costumes and boots courtesy of Gregg Barnes made for [...] "big red scene stealers". He also praised “Raise You Up/Just Be,” as [...] "one of the best curtain numbers since 'You Can’t Stop the Beat' sent Hairspray audiences dancing out of the theater.” Brantley, however, did not extend his praise to Fierstein's script, writing that his [...] "sticky, sermonizing side" [...] comes through in the second half, where [...] "all the clichés stand naked before you." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kate Muir in The Times {{concluded}} that the film is [...] "fairly conventional, and your pleasure in {{it will probably be}} predicated on your love for the game." [...] Conversely, Ross Miller in The National called the film [...] "emotional, inspiring and deeply heartfelt" [...] and wrote [...] "You don’t have to be a golf fan to be taken in by this engrossing, quietly passionate film that not only brings something new to the sports biopic table but also serves as a poignant, often heartbreaking portrait of paternal love and pursuing <b>your</b> <b>passion</b> with everything you have." [...] In January 2017, Justin Lowe in The Hollywood Reporter said the film [...] "offers an engrossing and accessible celebration of the game’s modern origins, enhanced by striking locations and a standout cast." ...|$|E

Woodman has often cited his fear of failure as a catalyst for his success stating, [...] "When I got out of college, I gave myself till I was 30 to invent a product.
