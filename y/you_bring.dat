5|$|What Bethesda had {{originally}} disclosed to us, as an example: In {{that section of}} the game, there is a hanging corpse. What they disclosed to us was a hanging corpse in the dark, pretty far away and without much detail. And yet, when <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> a torch up to the hanging corpse in the actual game, {{you can see that}} it's very mutilated with lots of blood and bones. That was a very different depiction, far more intense, far more extreme than what had been disclosed to us.|$|E

25|$|B. F. Skinner, theorist of operant conditioning, {{shows how}} a pigeon has {{been taught to}} {{distinguish}} between two words and behaves appropriately depending on which one is being presented. It learned each response with a reward of food therefore its behaviour is being shaped by controlling its environment. An example of this conditioning in a consumer behaviour context is a cinema using a consumer incentive scheme. As a consumer, if one is given a card which entitles you to a free movie if <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> a friend and free popcorn on Tuesdays with {{the purchase of a}} ticket per se, one is more likely to go to a movie when perhaps you wouldn’t have otherwise.|$|E

Gadsden was arrested for [...] "parading without a permit", and after witnessing his arrest, Commissioner Connor remarked to the officer, [...] "Why didn't <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> a meaner dog; this one is not the vicious one."

500|$|Critical {{reception}} to the episode's subplot involving Kelly and Ryan {{was largely}} positive. McNutt called Novak's acting [...] "some of [...] best {{work in a}} long time". He called the plots conclusion [...] "the sort of screwed up situation that The Office does well". White wrote that [...] "If it weren't for [...] story ... I might have written this clumsy episode off entirely." [...] Forcella enjoyed the plot, praising the ending {{due to the fact}} that it concluded with [...] "boos and hisses". However, he was confused with the casting, noting that [...] "why bring Sendhil Ramamurthy in for one scene? ... He seems more like someone <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> in for a multi-episode arc." [...] Hyatt lauded the scenes, and wrote [...] "the Ryan-Kelly stuff I give a 10/10." ...|$|E

Their famous holiday song is, [...] "Oh, Meatbowl of Verduke, <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> me such pizza. Meatbowl." [...] When Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) tells Kenneth that they made up their religion, he goes into shock {{at the idea that}} all religions are made up by man. His faith is restored when the three are arrested for the bomb threat Liz called in, using their phone.|$|E
500|$|As {{with the}} soundtrack for Watchmen, {{director}} Zack Snyder {{decided to go}} with covers instead of original songs, saying [...] "If you go with the original song, you just get the moment. But if you go with covers you also {{get all of the}} baggage <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> to it, [...] I like the baggage. It kind of resonates and rings across time, it's not just of the moment." [...] The soundtrack was produced by composer Tyler Bates and musical producer Marius de Vries. While Bates' job was initially only writing a musical score and helping the song transitions, the composer ended working closely with de Vries as [...] "the songs and the score just began bleeding into one another" [...] - the only track in which de Vries worked alone was the remix of [...] "Army of Me".|$|E

The king... was so far forward that he strake a stroke with his sword, yea and more than four, and fought valiantly and so did his company; and they adventured themselves so forward, that they were there all slain, and the next day they were found in the place about the king, and all their horses tied each to other.|$|E
500|$|The {{critical}} and commercial success of The Bends gave Radiohead {{the confidence to}} self-produce their third album. Their label Parlophone gave them a £100,000 budget for recording equipment. Guitarist Jonny Greenwood said [...] "the only concept that we had for this album was {{that we wanted to}} record it away from the city and that we wanted to record it ourselves." [...] According to guitarist Ed O'Brien: [...] "Everyone said, You'll sell six or seven million if <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> out The Bends Pt 2, and we're like, 'We'll kick against that and do the opposite'." [...] A number of producers, including major figures such as Scott Litt, were suggested, but the band were encouraged by their sessions with Godrich. They consulted him for advice on what equipment to use, and prepared for the sessions by buying their own equipment, including a plate reverberator purchased from Jona Lewie. Although Godrich had sought to focus his work on electronic dance music, he outgrew his role as advisor and became the album's co-producer.|$|E
500|$|Although {{she had not}} set out to {{make her}} career in film, Robert De Niro's {{performance}} in Taxi Driver (1976) {{had a profound impact on}} young Streep, who said to herself, [...] "that's the kind of actor I want to be when I grow up". Streep began auditioning for film roles, and underwent an unsuccessful audition for the lead role in Dino De Laurentiis's King Kong. Laurentiis stated in Italian to his son: [...] "This is so ugly. Why did <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> me this". Unknown to Laurentiis, Streep understood Italian and she remarked, [...] "I'm very sorry that I'm not as beautiful as I should be but, you know—this is it. This is what you get". She continued to work on Broadway, appearing in the 1976 double bill of Tennessee Williams' 27 Wagons Full of Cotton and Arthur Miller's A Memory of Two Mondays. For the former, she received a Tony Award nomination for Best Featured Actress in a Play. Streep's other Broadway credits include Anton Chekhov's The Cherry Orchard and the Bertolt Brecht-Kurt Weill musical Happy End, in which she had originally appeared off-Broadway at the Chelsea Theater Center. She received Drama Desk Award nominations for both productions.|$|E

500|$|The {{gameplay}} features {{introduced to}} the game received a mixed response. IGN noted that the Special Games varied in quality between different games, with Casamassina commenting that [...] "they certainly don't make or break the experience." [...] The game's [...] "Power Shots" [...] was also met with an ambivalent reaction—the shot themselves were praised for adding strategy and character, although GameSpot's Ryan Davis commented that [...] "it {{would have been nice}} if you could just skip past the animations and keep the wild moves." [...] In general, the game's multiplayer modes were more popular than single-player, with the [...] "predictable and basic" [...] artificial intelligence contributing to a low difficulty level at times. GameSpy noted how the number of options and variables enhanced the multiplayer experience, and commented that [...] "The game is very good on its own, but it excels when <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> friends into the mix." [...] The mechanics of the tennis gameplay were also popular, with reviewers lauding the game's accessibility as well as its depth relating to the variety of shots available and how the position of the character affects the contact with the ball.|$|E
500|$|The {{match is}} often cited as the best Premier League game ever to have been played. FIFA general {{secretary}} Sepp Blatter praised Kevin Keegan for his attacking football philosophy and personally sent him a faxed letter commending [...] "the positive attitude <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> to our game". Reflecting on the match in 2003, midfielder David Ginola believed that if Newcastle had kept the scoreline at 3–2, they [...] "would have won the league – definitely". As part of the Premier League's [...] "10 Seasons Awards" [...] to commemorate the first ten years of the competition, the 3 April 1996 Liverpool–Newcastle United match was voted by the public and a panel consisting of 10 football experts, as the Match of the Decade. In 2011, Sky Sports celebrated its 20th anniversary with a rundown of the top 20 live Premier League games broadcast on the network; the match was placed at number one, ahead of the Manchester derby played at Old Trafford on 20 September 2009. In May 2012, the match came second to the 2009 Manchester derby in the Premier League 20 Seasons Awards for best match.|$|E
500|$|As {{the matter}} {{involved}} the prince, Stacey consulted other {{officers in the}} regiment about what should be done, and found that opinion was divided between allowing Gordon-Cumming {{to remain in the}} regiment while he defended himself, or removing him straight away. The Colonel of the Scots Guards, the prince's younger brother, the Duke of Connaught, was also asked: according to Havers, Grayson and Shankland, the duke [...] "insisted that Gordon-Cumming must be crushed". Stacey disagreed, and thought that the whole story needed to be brought out before such a decision was taken. He reported the situation to the Adjutant-General to the Forces, General Sir Redvers Buller, and requested permission to let Gordon-Cumming retire on half-pay. Buller agreed to the request, but stated that if Gordon-Cumming's legal action failed, the permission would be reviewed. Stacey relayed the message to Gordon-Cumming and told him that signing the note was an error: [...] "Because you signed that document you will never put on a sword in the regiment. If <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> a successful action you will be allowed to retire: if you fail, you will be dismissed [...] the service". The Duke of Connaught strongly disapproved of Buller's decision, and he withdrew to Portsmouth, refusing to again be drawn on the affair, even after his brother requested further advice.|$|E

500|$|The idea of {{a reality}} series {{originated}} when Doherty and Iswarienko were interested in documenting {{the weeks leading up}} to their wedding in a filming and production style similar to [...] and Deadliest Catch. Doherty had previously worked on reality television when she hosted Scare Tactics and Breaking Up with Shannen Doherty and participated on the tenth season of Dancing with the Stars. She called the project her agreement with Iswarienko to [...] "chronicle this time in our lives and let future brides and future grooms know that [...] not just you and that goes through the stress". According to Doherty, it was a way to celebrate her third marriage: [...] "Can <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> all of those qualities to reality TV? Can you be that brutally honest, that completely raw, but with the quality of those two shows where you do use different cameras and you do want it to look spectacular?" [...] Doherty planned to develop the idea with her own production company, originally partnering with an unidentified television network. However, the series was picked up by WE tv when Doherty thought that the previous network was making the material too sensational. Miller said that he approved the series after seeing its pitch, and he found Doherty an appealing person to watch on reality television.|$|E
