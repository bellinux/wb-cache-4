500|$|Effects {{supervisor}} Scott Farrar {{said that}} Narita did a [...] "good {{job of keeping}} [...] dark. When <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> stage situation of aluminum walls and shiny metal, {{it can be a}} problem. But by keeping the light down, you see a little less and it becomes more textural. Hiro was very keen to avoid that over-bright stage look." [...] The budget meant that many of the Enterprise sets were redresses of those used in [...] Meyer and production designer Herman Zimmerman were only able to make minor adjustments to these sets, as the television series was still in production at the time of filming.|$|E
500|$|Thompson {{spent five}} years writing and {{revising}} the screenplay, both during and between shooting other films. Believing the novel's language to be [...] "far more arcane than in [...] later books," [...] Thompson sought to simplify the dialogue while retaining the [...] "elegance and wit of the original." [...] She observed that in a screenwriting process, a first draft often had [...] "a lot of good stuff in it" [...] but needed to be edited, and second drafts would [...] "almost certainly be rubbish... because <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> panic." [...] Thompson credits Doran for [...] "help me, nourish me and mentor me through that process... I learned about screenwriting at her feet." ...|$|E
2500|$|During filming, she {{was visited}} {{on the set}} by the actor Charles Laughton. She commented {{that she had a}} [...] "nerve" [...] playing a woman in her sixties, to which Laughton replied, [...] "Never not dare to hang yourself. That's the only way you grow in your profession. You must {{continually}} attempt things that you think are beyond you, or <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> complete rut." [...] Recalling the episode many years later, Davis remarked that Laughton's advice had influenced her throughout her career.|$|E

2500|$|Torino Brougham models came {{standard}} {{with extra}} {{exterior and interior}} trim, finer upholsteries, wheel covers, unique emblems, extra sound insulation and [...] "Hideaway" [...] headlights. [...] "Hideaway" [...] headlights were headlight covers that were styled {{to look like the}} grille of the vehicle extended across the front end without any headlights at all. When the lights were turned on, vacuum actuators would flip the covers {{up and out of the}} way to expose the quad headlamps. [...] Motor Trend wrote that [...] "when <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> Brougham, it's the same feeling as an LTD, or even, dare we say it, a Continental. But in a more manageable scale." [...] Motor Trend gave accolades to the 1970 Torino Brougham 2-door for its quiet interior that only allowed [...] "the muffled thump of freeway expansion-joints [...] intrude." ...|$|E

40|$|Several {{researchers}} {{have considered the}} question of using the same items to measure delinquency in different groups. Smith and Davidson (1986) focus on a latent variable indicating a propensity to violence for males and females. They use three items from the 1981 Monitoring the Future national sample of high school seniors: (1) How {{many times in the}} last 12 months have <b>you</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> fight at school? (2) How many times in the last 12 months have <b>you</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> fight with a group of people against another group? (3) How {{many times in the past}} 12 months have you hurt someone badly? They find that the second item, fighting in groups, is a less reliable indicator for white females compared with males and black females. The reliability of the third item, asking respondents about hurting someone badly, is lower for females than for males. While common factor loadings are found for black males and while males with respect to these items on self-reported violence, Smith and Davidson conclude that these measures do not reflect a single comparable latent variable for females. Weis (1976) reports a similar finding regarding measures of violence. Hindelang, Hirschi, and Weis (1981) focus on a comparison of self-reported delinquency formale and female respondents. In their analysis of the Seattle Youth Study, Hindelang et al...|$|R

[...] "They have no taste, and I am {{quite sure that}} if <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> low country {{it would be a}} good thing for you to take at least one of them every morning. People may have given you all sorts of things for your journey, but I do not believe any one has given you this." [...] And she handed me the box over the top of the gate.|$|E
6000|$|I {{insist upon}} the defects of the {{geological}} record the more because {{those who have}} not attended to these matters are apt to say, [...] "It is all very well, but when <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> difficulty with your theory of evolution, you appeal to the incompleteness and the imperfection of the geological record;" [...] and I want to make it perfectly clear to you that this imperfection is a great fact, which {{must be taken into account}} in all our speculations, or we shall constantly be going wrong.|$|E

One man can then go across and the rest will cover him with guns, until he sees that it is safe for the whole crowd to come along." ...|$|E
2500|$|Explaining why {{the maximum}} level of 15 degrees was arrived at, panel member Angus Fraser stated [...] "That {{is the number}} which {{biomechanics}} says that it (straightening) becomes visible. It is difficult for the naked eye to see less than 15 degrees in a bowler's action. We found when the biceps reached the shoulder the amount of bend was around 165 degrees. Very few bowlers can get to 180 degrees because the joint doesn't allow that.... but once you go further than 15 degrees <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>an</b> area which is starting {{to give you an}} unfair advantage and you are breaking the law".|$|R

6000|$|Presently the Doctor resumed: [...] "I {{will take}} the smaller matter first: your conduct to your wife. You went, I hear, and had an explanation. That may have been right or wrong; I know not; at least, you had stirred her temper. At the council she insults you; well, you insult her back--a man to a woman, a husband to his wife, in public! Next, upon the back of this, you propose--the story runs like wildfire--to recall the power of signature. Can she ever forgive that? a woman--a young woman--ambitious, {{conscious}} of talents beyond yours? Never, Otto. And to sum all, at such a crisis in your married life, <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> window corner with that ogling dame von Rosen. I do not dream {{that there was any}} harm; but I do say it was an idle disrespect to your wife. Why, man, the woman is not decent." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{live with}} your inferiors," [...] he said, warming unreasonably, as he knew, to his text. [...] "And <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> groove because, on the whole, it's rather a {{pleasant}} groove. And {{you tend to}} forget what you're there for. You've the feminine habit of making much of details. You don't see when things matter and when they don't. And that's what's the ruin of all these organizations. That's why the Suffragists have never done anything all these years. What's the point of drawing-room meetings and bazaars? You want to have ideas, Mary; get hold of something big; never mind making mistakes, but don't niggle. Why don't you throw it all up for a year, and travel?--see something of the world. Don't be content to live with half a dozen people in a backwater all your life. But you won't," [...] he concluded.|$|E

Perhaps you are right, God knows. At any rate, it isn't mine, so we had better part. Still, I rather admire your courage. I wonder what this young fellow is like for whose sake you are {{prepared}} to lose so much; more than you think, maybe, for I had grown fond of you. Well, good-bye, I'll see about your getting off. There, don't think that I bear malice although I am so angry with you.

Then, one day, the wife {{of one of the}} Greens Committee {{happened}} to mention that the baby needed new shoes, so now they've tacked on another hundred and fifty yards to it. You have to drive over the brow of a hill, and if you slice an eighth of an inch <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> sort of No Man's Land, full of rocks and bushes and crevices and old pots and pans. The Greens Committee practically live there in the summer. You see them prowling round in groups, encouraging each other with merry cries as they fill their sacks. Well, I'm going to fool them today.

[...] But, {{receiving}} no answer, he went on. [...] "You always sulk when I speak to you. I suppose you think I {{have no right to}} row you, but I do it to save you from worse. You can't never be found out." [...] This startled Tom, but Norman had no suspicion. [...] "If you go on, you will get into some awful scrape, and papa will be grieved. I would not, for all the world, have him put out of heart about you. Think of him, Tom, and try to keep straight." [...] Tom would say nothing, only reflecting that his elder brother was harder upon him than any one else would be, and Norman grew warmer. [...] "If you let Anderson junior get hold of you, and teach you his tricks, you'll never be good for anything. He seems good-natured now, but he will turn against you, as he did with Harry.
