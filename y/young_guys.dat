25|$|As {{part of the}} 2014 Lexus IS sports sedan {{launch in}} the US, Lexus partnered with NBCUniversal for the 'It's Your Move After Dark' campaign. The ads took {{advantage}} of real-time marketing by allowing viewers to contribute ad concepts via social networks to influence the creative for the Lexus advertisements. The campaign featured a series of live, improvisational short comedy ads that will run in the commercial pods during NBC's Late Night with Jimmy Fallon. The ads were based on real-time viewer social media submissions each Thursday and performed by New York's comedy troupes including Fun <b>Young</b> <b>Guys,</b> Magnet Theater Touring Company, MB's Dream and Stone Cold Fox. Every Thursday night for four weeks beginning 19 September, {{as part of an}} early commercial break on NBC's Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, improv comedians asked viewers to suggest ad concepts with the #LexusIS hashtag via social media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, Tumblr and Twitter. Submissions would influence the content of the ad and a live, on-air improve performance based on the viewer's ad suggestion will follow at the final commercial break. East and west coast live broadcasts of the commercials will be completely different each time based on their respective social media suggestions. Each Thursday's advertisement would be broadcast live from under the Brooklyn Bridge in New York City. In anticipation of the campaign launch, a 15-second promotional teaser was premiered on 18 September in NBC's late night programming commercial pods. Additionally, the selected comedic concepts and submissions were made be available for viewing and sharing on a custom page at NBC.com the day after each live broadcast. Fans can continue to engage in exclusive, behind-the-scenes content from the campaign on NBC.com.|$|E

On the next episode of Impact!, Jarrett relented to verbal cheap shots taken by Angle regarding Jarrett's children and accepted the match at Bound for Glory. The feud got more personal due to Angle mentioning Jarrett's wife, which led to Foley being named the special enforcer for their match.
