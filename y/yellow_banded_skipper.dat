50|$|The ribbon {{is similar}} to that of the South Africa Medal (1853), but with wider blue {{pinstripe}} bands. It is 32 millimetres wide, with a 2½ millimetres wide golden <b>yellow</b> <b>band,</b> a 4 millimetres wide blue band, a 3 millimetres wide golden <b>yellow</b> <b>band</b> and a 1 millimetre wide blue band, repeated in reverse order and separated by an 11 millimetres wide golden <b>yellow</b> <b>band.</b>|$|R

50|$|Eumenes mediterraneus {{can reach}} {{a length of}} about 15 millimetres. Body is black with yellow markings. Clypeus is mainly yellow and {{scutellum}} has two large spots. Tergite I has a broad apical <b>yellow</b> <b>band.</b> Tergite II has two large <b>yellow</b> <b>bands</b> laterally and a pale and translucent apical lamella. Tergites V and VI have a <b>yellow</b> apical <b>band.</b>|$|R
50|$|Campsomeris trifasciata {{can reach}} {{a length of}} 10 - 15 mm. These wasps show <b>yellow</b> <b>bands</b> on the three {{anterior}} abdominal segments. In males the last three abdominal segments are black and the scutellum has a single <b>yellow</b> <b>band.</b>|$|R

The hindwings are blackish distally and yellow basally. Adults have been recorded on wing from June to October.|$|R
50|$|Idem for {{the cherry}} sawfly but with <b>yellow</b> <b>bands.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Additionally, [...] "yellow band" [...] {{trailers}} {{were introduced}} in approximately 2007 to indicate restricted content, only for distribution on the internet. This practice, while official, appears to have never been widespread (though occasional <b>yellow</b> <b>band</b> trailers are created). A notable example is the <b>yellow</b> <b>band</b> trailer for Rob Zombie's Halloween.|$|R

50|$|The body {{lengths of}} B. ruderatus reach about 22 mm in queens, 16 mm in workers and 15 mm in males. It {{has a long}} face and tongue, which is well adapted for feeding on long-tubed flowers. The basic color {{of the body is}} black with two <b>yellow</b> <b>bands</b> on its mesonoma—one on its {{scutellum}} and one on its pronotum—and a single thin <b>yellow</b> <b>band</b> on the abdomen. A black band is located on the interwing and separates the two <b>yellow</b> <b>bands</b> on the thorax. Similarly, queens are the most difficult to find as the bee is scarce in many areas and queens are less abundant within a colony itself.|$|R
50|$|The bulk of Mount Everest, between 7,000 and 8,600 m, {{consists}} of the North Col Formation, of which the <b>Yellow</b> <b>Band</b> forms its upper part between 8,200 to 8,600 m. The <b>Yellow</b> <b>Band</b> {{consists of}} intercalated beds of Middle Cambrian diopside-epidote-bearing marble, which weathers a distinctive yellowish brown, and muscovite-biotite phyllite and semischist. Petrographic analysis of marble collected from about 8,300 m found it to consist as much as {{five percent of the}} ghosts of recrystallised crinoid ossicles. The upper five metres of the <b>Yellow</b> <b>Band</b> lying adjacent to the Qomolangma Detachment is badly deformed. A 5 - 40 cm thick fault breccia separates it from the overlying Qomolangma Formation.|$|R

The dark blue bands represent British Naval forces, the red band represents the Commonwealth Armies and the dark <b>yellow</b> <b>bands</b> represent the sun.|$|R
25|$|One <b>yellow</b> <b>band</b> of rock {{is below}} the Ordovician {{limestone}} {{going up to the}} summit.

5000|$|It {{is unusual}} among Bombus species in having the hairs {{of the body}} pressed against the body surface rather than [...] "fluffy" [...] as is true for nearly all other species. The {{bumblebee}} is black, with two <b>yellow</b> <b>bands</b> across the thorax and the anterior part of the abdomen of the queen and worker.

50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 50 mm. The forewings {{are similar in}} pattern to those of Milionia meeki and Milionia rawakensis, but the basal patch is often joined to the band. The hindwings have a narrow, marginal <b>yellow</b> <b>band,</b> and a rather small patch of the same colour posteriorly on the disc. This patch is connected with the anal angle {{by means of a}} narrow <b>yellow</b> <b>band.</b>|$|R

25|$|From Camp III to Camp IV, climbers {{are faced}} with two {{additional}} challenges: the Geneva Spur and the <b>Yellow</b> <b>Band.</b> The Geneva Spur is an anvil shaped rib of black rock named by the 1952 Swiss expedition. Fixed ropes assist climbers in scrambling over this snow-covered rock <b>band.</b> The <b>Yellow</b> <b>Band</b> is a section of interlayered marble, phyllite, and semischist, which also requires about 100 metres of rope for traversing it.|$|R
