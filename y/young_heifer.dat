It glared savagely round, as if in imitation of the bull, refused point-blank to land, swerved from side to side of the gangway, backed right into the ship at the risk of its neck and limbs, attempted to charge the men, created dire confusion and alarm among the poultry, and finally fell off the gangway into the water, and scrambled on shore in a way that must have thrilled Freydissa's heart with admiration--although she did not say so, but maintained a grim silence all the time.|$|E

Grip, the lucififer dog, rushed in blindly, and in two minutes was torn to ribbons. Then the lynxes came {{creeping}} and snarling towards the man, who backed away, shouting and swinging his axe. He killed one by a lucky blow, as it sprang for his chest. The others drove him to his own door; but he would never have reached it, so he told me, but for a long strip of open land that he had cleared back into the woods. He would face and charge the beasts, which seemed more afraid of his voice than of the axe, then run desperately to keep them from circling and getting between him and safety.

My {{admiration for}} the noble and gallant horse caused me to glance with less {{interest}} at the other animals, although many of them might have deserved the notice of Cuvier himself. There was the donkey which Peter Bell cudgelled so soundly, and a brother {{of the same species}} who had suffered a similar infliction from the ancient prophet Balaam. Some doubts were entertained, however, as to the authenticity of the latter beast. My guide pointed out the venerable Argus, that faithful dog of Ulysses, and also another dog (for so the skin bespoke it), which, though imperfectly preserved, seemed once to have had three heads. It was Cerberus. I was considerably amused at detecting in an obscure corner the fox that became so famous by the loss of his tail. There were several stuffed cats, which, as a dear lover of that comfortable beast, attracted my affectionate regards.

The respective cowherds were selected to differ with regard to frame size (SX > BX > AF > NG). The AF cows, young (13 to 15 months old) heifers and herd had significantly lower pregnancy rates than the SX, BX and NG cows, <b>young</b> <b>heifers</b> and herds. The weaning rate for NG was significantly higher (15 %) than SX, and although not significant, it was still 5 and 8 % respectively higher than BX and AF. Weaning weight and pre-weaning growth parameters differed significantly between breed types (SX > BX > AF > NG). Cow efficiency was significantly lower for the AF cows than for the SX, BX and NG cows. The NG herd was more efficient than the other three herds, while the AF herd was the least efficient.

40|$|Nutrients {{are divided}} into {{macronutrients}} and micronutrients based on the relative amount needed daily. Macronutrients are those needed in relatively large amounts, measurable in pounds and ounces or {{as a percentage of}} the ration. Examples of macronutrients are water, crude protein (CP), total digestible nutrients (TDN), and minerals such as calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P). Micronutrients are those needed in relatively small amounts, measurable in parts per million or milligrams in the ration. Examples of micronutrients are copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn). The nutrient requirement of an animal is determined by the animal’s species, age, size, and production level. Young animals need nutrients for growth. A <b>young</b> <b>heifer</b> needs nutrients for growth and for milk production when lactating. If they are to achieve their genetic potential, animals with the genetic ability for high growth rates need more macronutrients than those producing at lower levels.

40|$|International audienceA herd is a {{population}} structured into groups not all equally in contact, which may influence within-herd spread of pathogens. Herd structure varies among cattle herds. However, published {{models of the}} spread of bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) assume no herd structure or a unique structure chosen as a representative. Our objective was to identify - for different index cases introduced into an initially BVDV - free dairy herd - risky (favourable) herd structures, which increased (decreased) BVDV spread and persistence compared to a reference structure. Classically, dairy herds are divided into calves, <b>young</b> <b>heifers,</b> bred heifers, lactating cows and dry cows. In the reference scenario, groups are all equally in contact. We evaluated the effect of isolating or merging groups. Three index cases were tested: an open persistently-infected (PI) heifer, an open transiently-infected heifer, an immune heifer carrying a PI foetus. Merging all groups and merging calves and lactating cows were risky scenarios. Isolating each group, isolating lactating cows from other groups, and merging calves and <b>young</b> <b>heifers</b> were favourable scenarios. In most structures, the most risky index cases were the following: first, the entry of a PI heifer; second, {{the birth of a}} PI calf; last, the entry of a transiently-infected heifer. Recommendations for dairy herds are to raise young animals together before breeding and to isolate lactating cows from others as much as possible.

40|$|The beef {{industry}} {{traditionally has}} discriminated against <b>young</b> <b>heifers</b> {{in the marketplace}} when compared with steers. Price discrimination was probably the result of sex effects on fat partitioning and distribution. Also, steers have been observed to be more efficient than heifers in the conversion of feed to carcass weight. Both testes and ovaries secrete steroids that influence performance traits of cattle. Testosterone appears to stimulate rate of gain and efficiency of feed conversion in the male. Efficiencies of conversion of feed to live animal weight gains have been less in spayed feedlot heifers than in intact heifers. It {{has been suggested that}} androgens and estrogens are both necessary to realize maximum growth potential. In cattle, the concentration of steroids in blood that results in the fastest growth rates corresponds approximately to a combination of the androgen level in growing bulls and the estrogen level in <b>young</b> <b>heifers.</b> Thus, the optimal treatment should maintain this natural hormone status for as long as possible, preferably several months. If the hypothesis is valid, the greatest benefits would be seen in bulls treated with estrogens, steers treated with an androgen combined with an estrogen, and heifers and cows treated with androgens. Therefore, the objectives of the investigation were {{to determine the effects of}} surgical castration, estradiol immunoneutralization and(or) treatment with an exogenous androgen (trenbolone acetate) on growth, carcass characteristics, and meat palatability of heifers fed in a feedlot...|$|R

After a period of adaptation to the diet, the treatments, blood collection and follicular aspirations were started using a randomized design. The dry matter intake and weight gain were lower in the 1. 0 × M group than in the 1. 7 × M group. No differences were found in the plasma progesterone concentrations, albumin, glucose, urea or gonadotropin (FSH and LH) levels between the groups.

40|$|Pelvic {{measurements}} in heifers and bulls can be {{an important}} tool to help reduce the incidence and severity of calving difficulty. Calving difficulty results in a major economic loss to beef producers. This loss is estimated at $ 750 million annually nationwide. Calving difficulty increases calf death loss, cow mortality, labor and veterinary costs; it delays the return of cows to estrus and reduces conception rates. It also lowers calf weaning weight and market value, which results from breeding <b>young</b> <b>heifers</b> and cows to easy calving bulls to reduce calving difficulty. Studies show calf losses of 4 percent within 24 hours of birth for calves born unassisted, compared to 16 percent for calves requiring assistance. Montana research indicates 57 percent of all calf losses were due to dystocia (calving difficulty). Calving difficulty is becoming a greater concern for beef producers because of the increased emphasis on rapid growth rates, heavier weaning weights and improved cow efficiency.

40|$|In {{practice}} cattle may be slaughtered {{at different}} combinations of age and weight. As each of these factors could affect meat quality traits, the present work aimed to identify which combination {{can be expected to}} increase overall meat quality of m. rectus abdominis of Charolais heifers. Totally, 40 heifers were slaughtered either at 26 +/- 1 or at 36 +/- 1 months of age. <b>Young</b> <b>heifers</b> were sampled at two different carcass weights (349 +/- 12 and 394 +/- 8 kg). Old heifers were also sampled at two different carcass weights (397 +/- 6 and 451 +/- 9 kg). The m. rectus abdominis was excised 24 h postmortem to determine metabolic enzyme activities, myosin heavy-chain isoform proportions, lipid contents, collagen content and collagen solubility. Shear force measurements were evaluated on raw and broiled meat after 14 days of ageing. Meat quality traits scored between 0 and 10 by sensory analysis. Increasing slaughter age from 26 to 36 months had no impact on either raw/broiled shear force (0. 31 <= P <= 0. 47) and/or meat quality traits (0. 62 <= P <= 0. 91) or on physicochemical properties of heifer's meat samples. Increasing carcass weight for a similar slaughter age of 26 months had also impact neither on meat quality traits (0. 52 <= P <= 0. 91) nor on muscular properties. On the contrary, increasing carcass weight for a similar slaughter age of 36 months had induced a decrease of muscular shear force (raw muscle; P= 0. 009) and a concomitant decrease of total collagen content (P= 0. 03). Nevertheless, no significant impact on meat quality traits was revealed by the sensorial panel (0. 13 P 0. 49). Metabolic enzyme activities (0. 13 <= P <= 0. 86) and myosin heavy-chain proportions (0. 13 <= P <= 0. 96) were not significantly impacted by slaughter age and carcass weight. Thus, the impact of increasing carcass weight and/or slaughter age in <b>young</b> Charolais <b>heifers</b> has a limited impact on meat quality traits and associated muscular characteristics. Modulating heifer's cycles (age and/or carcass weight in the studied range) appears to be a way to answer to the numerous marketing chains, without penalising meat quality traits...|$|R

The performances of prediction models are satisfactory with a sensitivity of 78 %, a specificity of 80 % and anaccuracy of 79 % from carcass spectral measurements, and respectively of 85 %, 74 % and 80 % from animal spectralmeasurement...|$|R
40|$|In Israel, cattle are {{annually}} {{vaccinated against}} {{foot and mouth disease}} (FMD). If infections with FMD virus occur in dairy farms it mainly involves heifers and calves, while older dairy cows seldom become infected. We hypothesized that {{this difference in}} susceptibility between adult cows and the <b>young</b> <b>heifers</b> and calves is due to stronger and more stable immune response elicited by multiple vaccinations. In order to test this hypothesis, 99 dairy cattle, divided into six groups according to number of prior vaccinations, were annually vaccinated with a trivalent vaccine (A, O and Asia- 1) and followed during two consecutive years. In total 988 sera were sampled at 11 time points. Virus neutralization tests (VNT) were performed {{in order to determine the}} neutralizing antibody titers (NAT) against the vaccine homologous serotypes: O- 4625, O-Manisa, Asia- 1 -Shamir and the heterologous serotype A-Turkey- 20 / 2006. A similar NAT pattern was observed to all serotypes and therefore statistical analysis was restricted to O- 4625 serotype. In the ‘high vaccination’ groups (cows that were vaccinated at least four times before the study), high NAT were found on the beginning of the trial and no or only a mild increase of NAT was observed following further vaccinations. Additionally, in the ‘high vaccination’ groups, the percentage of cows that had a NAT higher than 2. 0 (log 10) by the end of the 1 st year was significantly higher than in the ‘low vaccination’ groups (cows vaccinated only three times or less before the study). We conclude that starting from the 5 th vaccination, the NAT increase following vaccination is mild and NAT are persistent, suggesting reduction of the frequency of routine vaccination after multiple vaccinations is possible. </p...|$|R
60|$|He took a page up {{from the}} pile of cut sheets: the model farm at Kinnereth on the lakeshore of Tiberias. Can become ideal winter sanatorium. Moses Montefiore. I thought he was. Farmhouse, wall round it, blurred cattle {{cropping}}. He held the page from him: interesting: read it nearer, the title, the blurred cropping cattle, the page rustling. A <b>young</b> white <b>heifer.</b> Those mornings in the cattlemarket, the beasts lowing in their pens, branded sheep, flop and fall of dung, the breeders in hobnailed boots trudging through the litter, slapping a palm on a ripemeated hindquarter, there's a prime one, unpeeled switches in their hands. He held the page aslant patiently, bending his senses and his will, his soft subject gaze at rest. The crooked skirt swinging, whack by whack by whack.|$|R
