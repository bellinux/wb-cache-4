500|$|Upon the film's {{theatrical}} release, Richard Roeper wrote, [...] "This is a {{very tough}} film to watch, especially for Beatles fans that worshipped Lennon, but it does provide a thought-provoking take on {{the inner workings of}} Mark David Chapman's twisted mind." [...] San Francisco Chronicles Joel Selvin praised Schaefer's direction writing, [...] "The film is impressively mounted and Schaefer has made a directorial debut of distinction, but it is an uncomfortable ride from the opening scenes of Chapman arriving in New York to the inevitable, inexorable final scene." [...] He also called Leto's performance utterly convincing. Rex Reed gave the film a positive review writing, [...] "Even if <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>only</b> moderately curious about the events that led up to the pointless death of a musical icon, I think you'll find it a film of arm-twisting fascination." [...] He praised Leto calling him unforgettable and writing, [...] "it is the pulverizing concentration and almost somnambulistic intensity of Jared Leto that gives the film its life and pulse." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B saying, [...] "Chapter 27 is far from flawless, but Leto disappears inside this angry, mouth-breathing psycho geek with a conviction that had me hanging on his every delusion." [...] Joe Neumaier of the New York Daily News described Chapter 27 as [...] "a claustrophobic drama that gets uncomfortably into the head of Mark David Chapman," [...] and praised Leto saying, [...] "Leto's drawling, blotchy, creepy performance sets it apart." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{a letter}} to his close friend Jane Octavia Brookfield while the book was being written, Thackeray confided that [...] "You know <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>only</b> a piece of Amelia, my mother is another half, my poor little wife y est pour beaucoup". Within the work, her {{character}} is compared and connected to Iphigenia, although two of the references extend the allusion to all daughters in all drawing rooms as potential Iphigenias waiting to be sacrificed by their families. Her sacrifice of her child to her wealthy relatives is compared to the biblical Hannah.|$|E

The king then wrote to him. [...] "I believe that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>only</b> fifteen [...] in number, in view of the extraordinary conduct which you have taken from the officers at Olmütz to demand deserters, be wary, or after so many such cases of discontent, you and I will quarrel."
