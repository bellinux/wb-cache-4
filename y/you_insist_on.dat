6000|$|... "If <b>you</b> <b>insist</b> <b>on</b> the difference, but I don't {{know that}} it's kind! Besides, I {{wanted to give}} you half my {{frontage}} on the vein." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know that}} I must seem a dreadful brute to you. I daresay I am; but, Miss Terry, it would, under all the circumstances, {{be much more}} to the point, if <b>you</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> Mildred's marrying me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] said Flora, [...] "it {{looks as}} if you had been {{acquiring}} some penetration; you were not so explicit the last time <b>you</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> thanking me. Who can have been teaching you? It seems, however, that I'm still incomprehensible." ...|$|R
