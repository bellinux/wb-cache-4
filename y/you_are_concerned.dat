500|$|His work {{steadily}} {{increased in}} amount and quality throughout the 1920s and '30s. By the 1930s {{he was making}} most of his court appearances in the senior courts such as the High Court of Justice; in 1932 he was advised by his clerk {{that he should not}} be seen in the County Courts, and that he should leave this work for lesser members of the chambers. In 1929 he helped edit several chapters of Smith's Leading Cases (13th ed.) and in 1932 acted as a supervising editor for the 9th edition of Bullen & Leake's Precedents for Pleadings in the King's Bench Division. In 1932 he moved to his own set of chambers in Brick Court, and by 1936 he was earning over £3,000 a year. A notable case was L'Estrange v F Graucob Ltd [...] 2 KB 394, where he successfully argued an exemption clause was incorporated because a contract was signed. This was counter to his work as a judge, where he tried to minimise their impact, but he said that 'If you are an advocate you want your client to win. If you are a judge you don't care who wins exactly. All <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>concerned</b> about is justice'.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Come, Sibylle,' {{said her}} father, 'you can assure your cousin Louis that, {{so far as}} <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>concerned,</b> any family {{misunderstanding}} is at an end.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then Mrs. Strange isn't troubled, as <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> <b>concerning</b> me?" [...] I asked, and I confess my anxiety {{attenuated}} {{my voice}} {{almost to a}} whisper.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am glad to}} {{tell you}} that the affair in which <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>concerned,</b> before <b>you</b> sailed, has now {{completely}} dropped. Nothing has been heard of Mocenigo since he made his escape.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{explain in}} a minute. Let {{me say that}} I've {{examined}} the land sale record here, and have found a deal registered that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>concerned</b> in. It <b>was</b> made {{in the name of}} Cyril Jernyngham." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Amongst them," [...] Borrowdean continued, calmly, [...] "is {{one which}} some day or other I must tell you, for indeed <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>concerned</b> in it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No; he bade {{me think}} much of it before I did so, as <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>concerned.</b> And he said that you might perhaps be disappointed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As far as <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>concerned,</b> I can't {{return the}} compliment," [...] {{he said to}} Catherine's companion. [...] "But as regards Miss Sloper, it's another affair." ...|$|E
6000|$|Good morrow my good Neighbour, Mr. Attentive; whither <b>are</b> <b>you</b> walking {{so early}} this morning? methinks you {{look as if}} <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>concerned</b> about {{something}} more than ordinary. Have you lost any of your Cattel, or what is the matter? ...|$|R
5000|$|Muhammad said, [...] "If one of <b>you</b> <b>is</b> <b>concerned</b> {{about some}} {{practical}} undertaking, or about making {{plans for a}} journey, he should perform two cycles (rak'atain) of voluntary prayer." [...] Then with all sincerity recite the following Du'a.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{shall see}} about it," [...] Terence laughed. [...] "Anyhow, if you allude {{to the subject}} again, I shall feel it my duty to inform the colonel of my reasons for suspecting that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>concerned</b> in {{spreading}} those false reports last night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Bob, I will {{do my best}} {{to persuade}} Carrie to let you go; but as far as <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>concerned,</b> you know, she is {{commanding}} officer." ...|$|E
6000|$|MRS. ARBUTHNOT. Are {{you talking}} {{of the child}} you abandoned? Of the child who, as far as <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>concerned,</b> might have died of hunger and of want? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{never existed}} any {{sentiment}} in my breast, in which <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>concerned,</b> {{that does not}} exist there still, and unchanged," [...] returned Alice, with her single-hearted sincerity.|$|E
6000|$|... "Never, monsieur, {{unless you}} {{happened}} to notice me on your {{visit to the}} prison. I have an official position in the Principality. I am commissioned {{to speak to you}} with respect to the little affair in which <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>concerned</b> at La Turbie." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Some of {{them are}} in the Queen-street prison, and a goodly number have been taken to the Bridewell. Who could give {{information}} to the Britishers that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>concerned</b> in the work at Hog island?" [...] he asked, turning squarely upon me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Rayner," [...] she said, after a pause, [...] "do you {{remember}} at lunch {{one day at}} Mrs. Elphinstone's refusing parsnips? You said that, so far as <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>concerned,</b> parsnips <b>were</b> first by a mile, and that prussic acid and strychnine also ran." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, now, as to {{this man}} Higginson. He first appears upon the scene, so far as <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>concerned,</b> on the day when you {{travelled}} from London to Schlangenbad?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come," [...] he said, [...] "so far as <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>concerned,</b> {{you have}} nothing to {{complain}} of. You offered, I believe, to give it up yourself on one condition." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You have {{no cause}} to be," [...] he said. [...] "Indeed, {{you have no}} cause to be. So far as <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>concerned</b> I have never changed. I am the same man." ...|$|E
50|$|As far as King <b>You</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned,</b> heaven had no {{pity for}} him, he was muddle-headed and {{not up to}} the job, having used {{criminal}} means to obtain the throne. King Xie violated the Mandate of Heaven, the vassal states usurped his power and he moved his capital to Jiaru (郏鄏).|$|R
6000|$|... "Forgive me," [...] he protested, [...] "but I did {{not know}} that you had any plans. All that you told us on your return from Blakely <b>was</b> that <b>you</b> had failed. So far as <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>concerned</b> the matter {{seemed to me to be}} over, and with it, I imagined, your {{interest}} in Mannering. I brought him here--" ...|$|R
6000|$|Slight as it was, {{her beauty}} somehow gave it style; {{so that he}} {{continued}} consistently: [...] "She learned it, you see, too soon--since of course one's idea had been that she might never even learn it at all. And she had felt sure--through everything we had done--of there not being between us, so far at least as <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>concerned,</b> anything she need regard as a warning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>concerned</b> for me," [...] said I, [...] "I am {{neither of}} his people nor yours, but an honest subject of King George, owing no man and fearing no man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite right, John," [...] said Mrs. Smiley. [...] "Them's {{the sentiments}} of a man, and I, as a woman having a right to speak where <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>concerned,</b> quite approve of them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'If {{you be in}} love, 'tis plain you may, {{since it}} is not your own life, but another's, that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>concerned</b> for, and you only save your own because it can't be helped.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "God help me!" [...] she moaned, and {{clung to}} him still. [...] "It is I who am killing you--I and your love for me. For {{it was to}} save me you rode hither to-night, never pausing to weigh your own deadly danger. Oh, I am punished for having listened to every voice but the voice of my own heart where <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>concerned.</b> Had I loved you earlier--had I owned it earlier..." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perfectly, sir," [...] he answered, {{after one}} more rapid glance around the carriage. [...] "I see that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> not <b>concerned</b> in this affair. I wish you good-night!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly," [...] Mr. Gaynsforth answered. [...] "However, that's neither here nor there. Everything was {{properly}} arranged, {{so far as}} <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>concerned,</b> of course. That doesn't alter my friend's convictions. This is a business matter with me, and if the two thousand pounds don't sound attractive enough, well, the amount must be revised, that's all. But I {{want you to understand}} this, Mr. Coulson, I represent a man or a syndicate, or call it what you will." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't think so," [...] she answered. [...] "I'm {{willing to}} admit my faults, that I am a failure so far as <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>concerned.</b> Your ideas of life and mine are far apart." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As far as <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>concerned,</b> I'm the middest Victorian in existence. Mid is {{my middle}} name." [...] Wally met her indignant gaze squarely. [...] "I--do--not--like--your--being--on--the--stage! Especially in any company which Ike Goble is running." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I will come," [...] Tavernake agreed, [...] "but I {{come as a}} listener. Remember that I {{have nothing}} to tell you. So far as <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>concerned,</b> I do not know either of those ladies." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But you yourself, Mr. Furnival; {{you have}} no doubt about it? <b>You</b> have <b>been</b> <b>concerned</b> in this matter from the beginning, and {{therefore}} I have no hesitation in asking you." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "The Messenger of Allah (peace {{and blessings}} of Allah be upon him) {{used to teach}} his companions to make Istikharah in all things, just {{as he used to}} teach them Surahs from the Qur'an. He (SAW) said: 'If any one of <b>you</b> <b>is</b> <b>concerned</b> about a {{decision}} he has to make, (or in the version narrated by Ibn Mas'ood as: 'if any one of you wants to do something...) then let him pray two rak'ahs of non-obligatory prayer and say (after the Salah) ...|$|R
6000|$|And now, if <b>you</b> <b>are</b> a {{stranger}} in Paris, listen {{to the words of}} Titmarsh.--If you cannot speak a syllable of French, and love English comfort, clean rooms, breakfasts, and waiters; if you would have plentiful dinners, and are not particular (as how should <b>you</b> <b>be?)</b> <b>concerning</b> wine; if, in this foreign country, you WILL have your English companions, your porter, your friend, and your brandy-and-water--do not listen to any of these commissioner fellows, but with your best English accent, shout out boldly, [...] "MEURICE!" [...] and straightway a man will step forward to conduct you to the Rue de Rivoli.|$|R
