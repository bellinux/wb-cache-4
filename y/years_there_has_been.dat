5|$|Historically, {{frequent}} wars ravaged Badajoz's {{economy and}} people were poor. Agricultural land was not fertile with no industry of any major importance in its territory.

5|$|In recent <b>years</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> a {{backlash}} against the external environmental effects of conventional agriculture, resulting in the organic movement. Famines continued to sweep the globe through the 20th century. Through the effects of climactic events, government policy, war and crop failure, millions of people died in each of at least ten famines between the 1920s and the 1990s.|$|E

Some 15,000 have come from within Europe, with Poland, Germany, Romania and Norway being the largest contributors.|$|E
5|$|As an {{industrial}} port city, Haifa {{has traditionally been}} a Labor party stronghold. The strong presence of dock workers and trade unions earned it the nickname 'Red Haifa.' In addition, many prominent Arabs in the Israeli Communist Party, among them Tawfik Toubi, Emile Habibi, Zahi Karkabi, Bulus Farah and Emile Toma, were from Haifa. In recent <b>years,</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> a drift toward the center. This was best signified by, in the 2006 legislative elections, the Kadima party receiving about 28.9% of the votes in Haifa, and Labor lagging behind with 16.9%.|$|E

5|$|In recent <b>years,</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> a rise {{in cases}} of {{undisclosed}} synthetic diamond melee being found in set jewelry and within diamond parcels sold in the trade. Due to the relatively inexpensive cost of diamond melee, as well as relative lack of universal knowledge for identifying large quantities of melee efficiently, not all dealers have {{made an effort to}} test diamond melee to correctly identify whether it is of natural or man-made origin. However, international laboratories are now beginning to tackle the issue head-on, with significant improvements in synthetic melee identification being made.|$|E

A National Boer War Memorial Committee was formed prior to that date, and they will be conducting a national competition to find a design for the new memorial. In the design brief for the memorial, the committee state that it is their desire to build a memorial along the same lines as Adelaide's: {{going so far as to}} say that they would be willing to accept a replica of the statue from the South Australian memorial if the original mould could be located or if a duplicate could otherwise be produced.|$|E
5|$|Over the <b>years</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{a gradual}} decline in {{participation}} in the nutrition assistance program.

By 1994, {{participation in the}} NAP program had decreased to 1.3 million, and by 2006 it had decreased to just over 1 million. While the Puerto Rican population has steadily increased throughout those periods, the percentage of the population participating in the nutrition assistance program has significantly declined. With Puerto Rico's current population estimated at 3,944,000 residents and a current estimated NAP participation of 1 million beneficiaries, the program's participation rate is roughly 26%, almost half of the participation under the original Food Stamp program in 1981.|$|E
5|$|Odense is Funen's most {{important}} industrial and commercial centre, and the city's central location in Denmark makes {{it one of}} the national convention and congress centres. Enterprises include the Albani Brewery, ABB (Asea Brown Boveri), Kansas Workwear (clothing), Plus Pack (canning and containers) as well as manufacturers in the electrical sector. In recent <b>years</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> a general trend from manufacturing into the service sector. By 2002, 51% of the workforce was employed by the service sector while only 13% were working in industry. Lindø Wharf, once Denmark's largest shipbuilding facility, has now been converted into Lindø Industrial Park specialising in the production and storage of components for the offshore industries, creating a variety of new tenants. GASA, a large horticultural centre, supplies fruit, vegetables, flowers and plants to most of the country as well as for export.
