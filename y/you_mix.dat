2500|$|In {{a letter}} to the Japanese {{government}} regarding intermarriage with Westerners, Spencer stated that [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>mix</b> the constitution of two widely divergent varieties which have severally become adapted to widely divergent modes of life, you get a constitution which is adapted to the mode of life of neither—a constitution which will not work properly". He {{goes on to say that}} America has failed to limit the immigration of Chinese and restrict their contact, especially sexual, with the presumed European stock. He states [...] "if they mix they must form a bad hybrid" [...] regarding the issue of Chinese and (ethnically European) Americans. Spencer ends his letter with the following blanket statement against all immigration: [...] "In either case, supposing the immigration to be large, immense social mischief must arise, and eventually social disorganization. The same thing will happen if there should be any considerable mixture of European or American races with the Japanese." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kabakov {{described}} {{the colors of}} paint in The Russian Series and Three Green Paintings as the main characters. The brown sandy soil color of the first series was the same enamel used in the Soviet Union during the 1950s and 1960s to paint everything from roofs to hallways, but most often floors. Kabakov {{points out that the}} color of the state is red but the color of the country is gray, due to its “humdrum existence”. [...] Kabakov assigns these colors a metaphysical meaning of earth and nature as controlled and depicted by the Soviet state. [...] He then suggests that if <b>you</b> <b>mix</b> these two colors you end up with the brown sandy soil color, which signifies both the floors and the ground that support the feet of the populace of the Soviet Union. The green of the second series is enamel that was used to paint {{the lower part of the}} walls up to one meter high in order to protect them from dirt and scuffs. For Kabakov, these colors evoke feelings of unavoidable hopelessness. More pertinent to this argument is what these series of paintings do not address. Political ideology is absent and only impersonal colors exist to dominate minor features, all of which are faceless texts and objects.|$|E
