G4's review noted that [...] "the extreme {{difficulty of the}} game might not be welcomed by all players" [...] and Official Xbox Magazine described the game as [...] "reliably unforgiving". According to EGM, [...] "XCOM hates you. XCOM wants <b>you</b> <b>dead.</b> And XCOM will see <b>you</b> <b>dead,</b> over and over again." [...] Game Informer called it [...] "one of the most challenging, intense gaming experiences of this generation." [...] PLAYs review stated, [...] "dying is back in fashion." ...|$|E

It is the longest song on the album, lasting for 5 minutes and 26 seconds. Lyrically, it follows a woman getting her cronies together to seek bloody vengeance against someone, with the singer declaring, [...] "Shot <b>you</b> <b>dead,</b> shot my lover in the head / I'm going straight to hell / I've {{got a lot of}} friends there," [...] before yelling, [...] "Drive bitch, die bitch!". It ends with the line: [...] "If you're going to [...] like a bitch then you're going to die like a bitch." [...] According to MTV News' Bradley Stern, the song [...] "revisits the role of the scorned songstress from Eroticas 'Thief of Hearts' (1992)." ...|$|E

500|$|The song {{received}} acclaim from critics. [...] James Montgomery of MTV News {{said of the}} song, [...] "there {{are moments}} on Stairs that stop <b>you</b> <b>dead</b> in your tracks, send shivers up your spine and make you go 'Whoa'... like the first four-and-a-half minutes of 'I Will Possess Your Heart,' a propulsive whirl of stalking bass line, spindly guitars and stabbing piano." [...] Will Hermes noted in Rolling Stone that the sense of menace in the song was [...] "playing against type for a guy with one of rock's purest voices—a vibrato-less, bell-clear high tenor whose choirboy quality only throws the darkness here into relief." [...] Blender Jonah Weiner concurred, stating [...] "it's a pleasant surprise to hear Gibbard inhabit such a self-consciously creepy role, rather than play the occasionally errant, essentially good-hearted boyfriend who soft-shoes through {{so many of his}} tales." [...] In 2011, Tyler Kane of Paste included the song in a list of [...] "the 25 creepiest songs about love".|$|E
500|$|The pro-Church accounts, by contrast, {{described}} a boy very much resolved {{to stay where}} he was, and horrified by his mother's exhortations {{to return to the}} Judaism of his ancestors. In this narrative, the main reason for the Mortaras' grief was not that their son had been taken, but that he now stood to grow up in the Christian faith. According to La Civiltà Cattolica, Marianna flew into a rage on seeing a medallion hanging from Edgardo's neck bearing the image of the Virgin Mary, and ripped it off; one article {{went so far as to}} claim the Jewish mother had done this with the words: [...] "I'd rather see <b>you</b> <b>dead</b> than a Christian!" [...] Some of the Church's critics had charged that by keeping Edgardo, it was violating the commandment that a child should honour his father and mother—La Civiltà Cattolica countered that Edgardo still loved his family despite their religious differences and indeed, after being taught by the priests to read and write, had chosen to write his first letter to his mother, signing it [...] "your most affectionate little son". Louis Veuillot, the ultramontane editor of the L'Univers newspaper and one of the Pope's staunchest defenders, reported after meeting Edgardo in Rome that the boy had told him [...] "that he loves his father and his mother, and that he will go to live with them when he is older... so that he can speak to them of Saint Peter, of God, and of the most Holy Mary." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{his review}} of the single, for the NME, Derek Johnson admired McCartney's {{performance}} and the lyrics' [...] "pseudo-religious" [...] qualities. Although he considered that the melody paled beside some of the band's previous singles, Johnson added: [...] "As ever with The Beatles, this is a record to stop <b>you</b> <b>dead</b> in your tracks and compel you to listen attentively." [...] John Gabree of High Fidelity magazine found the lyrics [...] "dangerous politically", but viewed the song as possibly [...] "the best thing musically that McCartney has done".|$|E
2500|$|After {{finishing}} the world tour with Latvala – who then assumed {{a permanent position}} in the band's line-up – Children of Bodom proceeded to record and release the EP Trashed, Lost & Strungout and the single [...] "In Your Face", which contained songs from their upcoming album and a parody cover of [...] "Oops!... I Did It Again" [...] by Britney Spears. In late 2005, the album Are <b>You</b> <b>Dead</b> Yet? was released, featuring a style different from what had been presented by the band on its previous works. Simpler and heavier guitar riffs were incorporated into Children of Bodom's sound, as well as elements from industrial music. Reactions from fans to the release were varied; however, the album remains the band's most commercially successful. It was awarded gold status in Finland and reached first place on the Finnish charts, 16th in Germany, 16 in Sweden and 17 in Japan. The next release of the band was a DVD-single for the song [...] "In Your Face", which included the music video, [...] footage from the band and a live recording of the song [...] "Sixpounder" [...] at Wacken Open Air festival in 2004. In June, Children of Bodom {{was in front of}} 120,000 spectators, one of their biggest concerts on the last concert of the Böhse Onkelz. On the DVD of the concert, the Vaya Con Tioz was called, Children of Bodom were also with the song [...] "Everytime I Die" [...] represented.|$|E

[...] When Godvino enters, she demands {{to be left alone}} and her ring be returned. [...] He declares his love and insists upon staying to defend her while she proclaims that she hears her mother's voice coming from her tomb (Aria: Ah, dal sen di quella tomba / [...] "Ah, from the depths of that tomb there echoes a sinister trembling"). [...] Egberto comes across the couple, sends Mina away, and then confronts Godvino, offering him the choice of two proffered swords. [...] Godvino refuses to take one. [...] The older man continues to press him ("Are <b>you</b> <b>dead</b> to any sense of honour?"), accusing him of cowardice and stating that he will reveal him to be a bastard. [...] At that remark, Godvino accepts the challenge and the two men fight until interrupted by the arrival of Aroldo. [...] Stating that [...] "I speak in the name of God", Aroldo tries to force the two men to stop their fighting. [...] In disarming him, he takes Godvino's hand only to have Egberto question how Aroldo can take the hand of the very man who has betrayed him. [...] With Mina's return, Aroldo finally realizes the truth (Aria: Ah no! è impossibile / [...] "Ah no! [...] It is impossible. [...] Tell me at least that I have been mistaken"). Finally, Egberto insists that Aroldo must punish the right person and not Mina, and Aroldo attempts to return Godvino's sword and commence fighting him. [...] Godvino refuses. [...] With Briano's arrival and his attempts to calm his friend ("my heart has lost everything", Aroldo cries, while the chorus of praying parishioners can be heard coming from the church), all join in a plea for forgiveness. [...] Aroldo collapses.|$|E
