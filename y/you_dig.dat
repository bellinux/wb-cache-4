500|$|For the film's {{positive}} response, Kevin Carr {{stated that}} [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>dig</b> down and actually find (and watch) the new Muppet material, {{some of the}} magic is still there." [...] MaryAnn Johanson of Flick Filosopher said that, [...] "It's not {{on a par with}} the Muppet movie madness of old, but it's darn close." [...] According to the Bums Corner's review the film was a [...] "treat for all ages, and that it was a colorful, musical, humorous romp." [...] Keith Allen of Movie Rapture gave the film 2.5 stars out of 3, explaining that the film's humor was surprisingly clever, and that the film would frequently make you laugh. Mutant Reviewers commented that although the Muppet deal with Walt Disney was [...] "disappointing", the film managed to be funny and witty.|$|E

Bono noted [...] "Daniel had {{such a hard time}} on that... {{he was trying to get}} us to play to our strengths and I didn't want to. I wanted to play to our weaknesses. I wanted to experiment." [...] Bono noted that the end product [...] "doesn't quite get off the ground the way I'd hoped it would." [...] An early mix of the track was included on some versions of the 20th anniversary reissue of Achtung Baby. The mix, titled [...] "'Baby' Acrobat", contained lyrics that were later modified to a different perspective ("You know I'd hit out if I only knew who to hit" [...] instead of the final [...] "I know you'd hit out if you only knew who to hit") or scrapped entirely ("If the sky turns to purple and the moon turns to blood / Will <b>you</b> <b>dig</b> me out when I'm face down in the mud").|$|E
500|$|The Guardian also {{quoted a}} U.S. {{official}} explaining the anticipated difficulty {{of finding a}} country that would accept the burial of bin Laden in its soil. A professor of Islamic Law at the University of Jordan stated burying at sea was permitted if there was nobody to receive the body and provide a Muslim burial, and that [...] "it's neither true nor correct to claim that there was nobody in the Muslim world ready to receive bin Laden's body". On a similar note, Mohammed al-Qubaisi, Dubai's grand mufti, stated: [...] "They can say they buried him at sea, but they cannot say they did it according to Islam. If the family does not want him, it's really simple in Islam: <b>you</b> <b>dig</b> up a grave anywhere, even on a remote island, you say the prayers and that's it. Sea burials are permissible for Muslims in extraordinary circumstances. This {{is not one of}} them." [...] Khalid Latif, an imam who serves as a chaplain {{and the director of the}} Islamic Center of New York University, argued that the sea burial was respectful.|$|E
500|$|Tainton and {{the other}} white opponents of the {{concession}} contended that the document conferred upon the grantees all of the watershed's minerals, lands, wood and water, and was therefore tantamount to a purchase receipt for the whole country. Thompson, backed by the missionaries, insisted that the agreement only involved the extraction of metals and minerals, and that anything else the concessionaires might do was covered by the concession's granting of [...] "full power to do all things that they may deem necessary to win and procure" [...] the mining yield. William Mzisi, a Fengu from the Cape, who {{had been to the}} diamond fields at Kimberley, pointed out that the mining would take thousands of men rather than the handful Lobengula had imagined, and argued that digging into the land amounted to taking possession of it: [...] "You say you do not want any land, how can <b>you</b> <b>dig</b> for gold without it, is it not in the land?" [...] Thompson was then questioned as to where exactly it had been agreed that the concessionaires could mine; he affirmed that the document licensed them to prospect and dig anywhere in the country.|$|E

500|$|Writing in Time, Richard Schickel said, [...] "I'm {{not going}} to argue that Valkyrie is a great movie. But in its way it is a {{thoughtful}} and entertaining one, especially {{in comparison with the}} pomp and pretentiousness of most of the competition this holiday season." [...] Ty Burr of The Boston Globe described the film: [...] "It's a smooth, compelling, almost suspenseful ... and slightly hollow Hollywood period piece—a World War II action-drama in which an intriguing (but not electrifying) star performance is buttressed by stellar support." [...] Burr analyzed Cruise's performance: [...] "... his Claus von Stauffenberg is an honorable conception that's ultimately too thin to fully rise up from the pages of history. This story deserves to be told, but for reasons best known to himself, the star has latched onto a strictly Nietzschean interpretation that he rides into the ground." [...] Claudia Puig of USA Today thought of Cruise as [...] "unconvincing and stiff as the disenchanted" [...] von Stauffenberg. She felt that the film started slowly and that [...] "even during scenes of intense action, the visually slick production is only minimally engrossing". She concluded of the film's overall pace, [...] "The action becomes more engrossing during the film's second half, but one expects more depth and nuance, given its pedigree." [...] Anthony Lane of The New Yorker wrote, [...] " [...] carries the movie, although, once <b>you</b> <b>dig</b> beneath the uniform, there isn’t much for him to get a handle on; the fascination with Stauffenberg resides in what he did, not in who he was." [...] Lane thought that there was [...] "too much" [...] character acting of the British veteran actors and felt of the casting of Nighy, Stamp, and Wilkinson, [...] "These men are meant to be battle-toughened Nazi officers, but what we get is an array of discreetly amusing studies in mild neurosis." ...|$|E

2500|$|American Motors {{lacked the}} funds {{to come up with}} a {{separate}} platform for a sub-compact car, so it did something different with an existing model and [...] "although car snobs make fun of the chop-tailed Gremlin, it was a huge sales hit." [...] The authors of the book 365 Cars You Must Drive [...] "that any self-respecting auto enthusiast just has to know and experience from the driver's seat" [...] describe that [...] "driving a Gremlin isn't about the drive; it's about being seen in one, making a statement that <b>you</b> <b>dig</b> the mid-1970s, and also wouldn't be caught dead in something normal." [...] An article published by Time in 2007 included the Gremlin as one of [...] "The 50 Worst Cars of All Time", describing it as an AMC Hornet with the rear end whacked off, and criticizing its exterior proportions, with a long low snout, long front overhang and a truncated tail, [...] "like the tail snapped off a salamander".|$|E
2500|$|On 26 March 1970, Phil Spector remixed {{the song}} for the Let It Be album. This version {{features}} the [...] "more stinging" [...] 4 January 1970 guitar solo, no backing vocals (except during the first chorus), a delay effect on Starr's hi-hat, and more prominent orchestration. The final chorus has three [...] "let it be …" [...] lines, as the [...] "there will be an answer" [...] line is repeated twice (instead of once as on the single) before the [...] "whisper words of wisdom" [...] line to close the song. On the album, as the preceding track [...] "Dig It" [...] ends, Lennon is heard saying in a falsetto voice, mimicking Gracie Fields: [...] "That was 'Can <b>You</b> <b>Dig</b> It' by Georgie Wood, and now we'd like to do 'Hark, the Angels Come'." [...] Allen Klein brought in Spector to mix the album without telling McCartney or asking for his agreement, because McCartney had not signed Klein's management contract.|$|E
2500|$|Tubridy met his wife, the {{producer}} Anne Marie Power at RTÉ in 1997 {{when he spotted}} her in a recording studio. He later spoke of the moment they met: [...] "She was going in to make a programme, I was going out. My head turned and my life changed. I pursued her relentlessly. She used to sashay down the corridor and I was quite taken by her. She was very erudite and she made documentaries on flamenco. She was much brighter than I am and continues to be, which isn't that hard really if <b>you</b> <b>dig</b> deep enough, and I asked her out." [...] The couple had a daughter, Ella, and later married in 2003. Tubridy proposed in the Abbeyglen Hotel (a [...] "favourite haunt" [...] of his) in Clifden, County Galway. The engagement was announced in The Irish Times with the words [...] "Ella Tubridy is delighted to announce the engagement of her parents Ryan and Anne Marie".|$|E

He was scheduled to appear on the first episode of NBC Saturday Night (later renamed Saturday Night Live on October 11, 1975), but his sketch was cut. He did perform on episode 17 of that first season, doing a monologue of an old jazz man capped by the line [...] "Can <b>you</b> <b>dig</b> it? [...] I knew that you could." [...] Host Ron Nessen introduced him as [...] "Bill Crystal."
