2500|$|As of the Rogers-produced Hockey Night, Coach's Corner was noticeably shortened, from {{as long as}} 10 {{minutes to}} as short as 5—a change that was lampshaded by both Cherry and MacLean during their first segment of the new season. The {{following}} Monday, Scott Moore had a short discussion with Cherry regarding the matter, laughing it off and explaining that [...] "if you have more to talk about, {{all you need to}} do is make sure you tell the executive producer what you want to talk about and we'll make sure <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> time." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "That's a good idea," [...] said Mr. Wrenn. It had, apparently, been ordained {{that he was}} {{to write}} it. They were now {{settling}} important details.

6000|$|... "Don't know," [...] {{answered}} Jeekie. [...] "'Spect they doubtfully your wives; 'spect <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> wives here; don't get {{white man}} every day, so make most of him.

They all {{know who you}} are and what you are. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> information which would be useful to me. Aaron must have some one to help him. Why not you? As for the rest, I can afford to pay two secretaries--you needn't be afraid of that." ...|$|E

6000|$|People who pretend (for {{it must be}} pretence) {{that they}} enjoy their holiday in the country, explain that the hills or the sea gave them such an appetite. I could never myself feel the delight {{of being able to}} manage an extra herring for breakfast, but {{it should be pointed out}} that neither {{mountains}} nor oceans give you such an appetite as a holiday in bed. What makes people eat more anywhere is that they have nothing else to do, and in bed <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> time for meals. As for the quality of the food supplied, there is no comparison. In the Highlands it is ham and eggs all day till you sicken. At the seaside it is fish till the bones stick in your mouth. But in bed--oh, there you get something worth eating. You don't take three big meals a day, but twelve little ones, and each time it is something different from the last. There are delicacies for breakfast, for your four luncheons and your five dinners. You explain to your wife that you have lost your appetite, and she believes you, but at the same time she has the sense to hurry on your dinner. At the clatter of dishes (for which you have been lying listening) you raise your poor head, and say faintly: ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{delay was}} fortuitous, as Bregman and Good Machine came aboard as producers. The script went through 10 more drafts that year with Bregman, who comments, [...] "That's {{one of the}} luxuries about {{independent}} film, you often have {{time to make the}} script perfect.

5000|$|The Nutcrackers I've seen {{have all}} been dull. You have a simpering little girl, a Christmas party, a tree that gets big.

5000|$|He {{commented on}} Mayor Michael Bloomberg's reforms:Norman Fruchter, {{director}} of the Community Involvement Program at the Annenberg Institute for School Reform {{and the author of}} a report highlighting problems afflicting New York's middle schools, said he did not think the changes would improve the situation in those schools. Autonomy is not a virtue in and of itself, he said. [...] "If you're living in an abandoned building, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> autonomy," [...] he said. [...] "What you need isn't autonomy" [...] but help.... While there have been some gains in elementary scores, said Fruchter, it's [...] "not translating into middle school gain." [...] The school system, he said, [...] "has not figured out how to build conceptual skills at the eighth grade level." ...|$|E
50|$|Water-based {{paint is}} far easier and cheaper to apply, as undercoat, {{to produce a}} good smooth finish with a {{fraction}} of the time and effort of enamel paints, but harder and slower-drying enamel is best for the top coat {{on the outside of the}} hull, which is subject to a lot of bumps and scraps. Limit varnishing to smaller areas, such as grab rails, hatches, toe rails and trim, unless <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> patience and a very dust-free environment for varnishing. Use only marine gloss varnish on the outside, as interior varnish will peel off very quickly in hot sun and rain. Marine varnish has UV inhibitors to slow down peeling and fading. Never varnish a deck as it is slippery when wet. Even top-quality marine varnish is not as water-resistant as paint, so you must apply at least 4 coats. Often perfectionists will apply 8 coats or more to get a glass-like, reflective finish. Never varnish submerged parts like rudders.|$|E

5000|$|... "The Dinner Roll is a trick I {{developed}} for the ’99 X-Games. It’s a 720 degree off axis rotation, wherein you ski off the jump, do two full rotations, one on the horizontal plane {{and the other on}} the vertical plane. At the X-Games where everything is [...] "extreme" [...] and [...] "rad" [...] the jumps are big, and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> time in the air. The Olympic moguls course is a whole different ball game. It’s steep, with tight turns, and a small narrow technical jump, with an unforgiving landing. The trick was so new that we had to appeal to the Olympic Skiing Federation in order just to do it. We had to show them that it fell within their rule stating [...] "no inverted tricks in the moguls" [...] and also prove that it was not dangerous. After lobbying and video explanation we pushed it through by one vote, much to the chagrin of the European countries." ...|$|E
5000|$|On cross-examination, Miller {{acknowledged}} that Proposition 8 discriminates against {{gays and lesbians}} {{in the sense that}} it treats different people differently. He also {{acknowledged that}} while it is difficult to know the electorate’s intent when voting on initiatives, it is likely that “at least some” supporters of Proposition 8 were motivated by animus against gays and lesbians. On direct Miller had argued, however, that the success of Proposition 8 and the LGBT's reliance on broad coalition support were not signs of political powerlessness. Instead, he argued that this reality conformed with constitutional design: [...] "...in the American political system, which is pluralistic and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> interest groups, again, this is sort of a Madisonian view of American politics with multiplicity of groups or factions in the society. Basically everybody has to form coalitions and make alliances in order to achieve their political goals. If you are a minority group, particularly a smaller minority group, then coalition building and forming alliances becomes even more important to your attaining your goal's objectives.".|$|E
