Watching her try to look like Marilyn Monroe and sound like Betty Boop, though, is {{a sure sign that}} this film was a disaster in the making. At the same time, it seems inconceivable that anyone would sit down and plan something so dreadful." [...] Carole Kass of the Richmond Times-Dispatch felt that since [...] "Madonna is the idol of teen-agers. If they imitate her hair and her makeup, these 'wanna-bes' who want to be like Madonna and dress like Madonna may be cute. But, as a popular personality, Madonna has a responsibility to her fans. And shoplifting is something not to promote. Nor is smoking." [...] Dan Dinicola of The Schenectady Gazette felt that [...] "Who's That Girl is not simply an awful film, it is positively unbearable. It's a movie without a head or a brain, a picture of such crass stupidity that it can't even make <b>you</b> <b>angry.</b> Instead it numbs you to death with its moronic platitudes, its pretensions to comedy. [...] It's a vanity project which is so amateurly produced and conceived that it makes you want to cringe in shame. [...] Madonna {{is no more than a}} novelty item." [...] Johanna Steinmetz of the Chicago Tribune complimented Dunne's acting and said: [...] "Fortunately the film has Griffin Dunne. Dunne, working in a domain once ruled by Cary Grant, manages to be stuffy, naive and vulnerable but never undignified as Loudon Trott, the New York lawyer." [...] Jean Rosenbluth of Rolling Stone was harsh about the film, saying [...] "The question posed by the film's title was Who's that girl? The answer provided by the box-office receipts was, alas, 'The same one who appeared in Shanghai Surprise and bored us to death'." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{scene and}} song [...] "Life Support" [...] were {{also based on}} Friends in Deed, {{as well as on}} Gordon, Pam, and Ali. Originally, the members of Life Support had a solid block of the [...] "forget regret" [...] refrain, and they talked about remembering love. When Jonathan's HIV {{positive}} friends heard this scene, they told him that having AIDS was not so easy to accept: it made <b>you</b> <b>angry</b> and resentful too, and the song did not match that. Jonathan then added a part where Gordon says that he has a problem with this [...] "credo...my T-cells are low, I regret that news, okay?" [...] Paul, the leader of the meeting, replies, [...] "Okay...but, Gordon, how do you feel today?" [...] Gordon admits that he is feeling the best that he has felt all year. Paul asks, [...] "Then why choose fear?" [...] Gordon says, [...] "I'm a New Yorker. Fear's my life." ...|$|E
2500|$|His book Either/Or {{discussed}} {{whether or}} not love can be deceived. Is it {{a good thing to}} find out you have been deceived or is it something that makes <b>you</b> <b>angry?</b> Kierkegaard had already discussed anger in his Two Upbuilding Discourses, 1843 where he quoted The Epistle of James, Therefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger, because man’s anger does not work what is righteous before God. (James 1:17-22) Earlier in the same discourse he had discussed equality. There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. He asks pointed questions, [...] "Did the woman who was a sinner feel her guilt more deeply when the scribes were accusing her than when there was no accuser anymore and she stood alone before the Lord! But you also realize that the most dangerously deceived person is the one who is self-deceived, that the most dangerous condition is that of the one who is deceived by much knowledge, and, furthermore, that it is a lamentable weakness to have one’s consolation in another’s light-mindedness, {{but it is also a}} lamentable weakness to have one’s terror from another’s heavy-mindedness. Leave it solely to God-after all, he knows best how to take care of everything for one who becomes alone by seeking him." ...|$|E
