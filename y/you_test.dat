50|$|A medical {{example is}} {{described}} by Axelsson. Say a doctor performs a test that is 99% accurate, and <b>you</b> <b>test</b> positive for the disease. However, the incidence of the disease is 1/10,000. Your actual chance of having the disease is 1%, because the population of healthy people is so {{much larger than the}} disease. This statistic often surprises people, due to the base rate fallacy, as many people do not take the basic incidence into account when judging probability. Research by Bar-Hillel (1980) suggests that perceived relevancy of information is vital to base-rate neglect: base rates are only included in judgments if they seem equally relevant to the other information.|$|E
5000|$|Say {{you have}} a new disease, called Super-AIDS. Only one in a million people gets Super-AIDS. You develop a test for Super-AIDS that's 99 percent accurate. I mean, 99 percent of the time, it gives the correct result - true if the subject is infected, and false if the subject is healthy. You give the test to a million people.One in a million people have Super-AIDS. One in a hundred people that <b>you</b> <b>test</b> will {{generate}} a [...] "false positive" [...] - the test will say he has Super-AIDS even though he doesn't. That's what [...] "99 percent accurate" [...] means: one percent wrong.What's one percent of one million?1,000,000/100 = 10,000One in a million people has Super-AIDS. If <b>you</b> <b>test</b> a million random people, you'll probably only find one case of real Super-AIDS. But your test won't identify one person as having Super-AIDS. It will identify 10,000 people as having it.Your 99 percent accurate test will perform with 99.99 percent inaccuracy.That's the paradox of the false positive. When you try to find something really rare, your test's accuracy has to match the rarity of the thing you're looking for. If you're trying to point at a single pixel on your screen, a sharp pencil is a good pointer: the pencil-tip is a lot smaller (more accurate) than the pixels. But a pencil-tip is no good at pointing at a single atom in your screen. For that, you need a pointer - a test - that's one atom wide or less at the tip.|$|E
