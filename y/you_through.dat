5|$|Hańska {{wrote to}} Balzac {{several times during}} 1832. On 7 November she posted a seven-page letter filled with praise and flattery:Your soul embraces centuries, Monsieur; its {{philosophical}} concepts {{appear to be the}} fruit of long study matured by time; yet I am told that you are still young. I would like to know you, but feel that I have no need to do so. I know <b>you</b> <b>through</b> my own spiritual instinct; I picture you in my own way and feel that were I to set eyes upon you I should exclaim, 'That is he!' Your outward semblance probably does not reveal your brilliant imagination; you have to be moved, the sacred fire of genius has to be lit, if you are to show yourself as you really are, and you are what I feel you to be—a man superior in his knowledge of the human heart.|$|E
500|$|The story {{revolves}} around Costner's Jim Garrison, {{with a large}} cast of well-known actors in supporting roles. Stone {{was inspired by the}} casting model of the documentary epic The Longest Day, which he had admired as a child: [...] "It was realistic, but it had a lot of stars... the supporting cast provides a map of the American psyche: familiar, comfortable faces that walk <b>you</b> <b>through</b> a winding path in the dark woods." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{his opening}} scene, Cagney spoke fluent Yiddish, a {{language}} {{he had picked}} up during his boyhood in New York City. Critics praised the film. Taxi! {{was the source of}} one of Cagney's most misquoted lines; he never actually said, [...] "MMMmmm, you dirty rat!", a line commonly used by impressionists. The closest he got to it in the film was, [...] "Come out and take it, you dirty, yellow-bellied rat, or I'll give it to <b>you</b> <b>through</b> the door!" [...] The film was swiftly followed by The Crowd Roars and Winner Take All.|$|E
500|$|It [...] shoots its load quickly, {{although}} just as effectively: [...] "Lose My Breath" [...] and [...] "Soldier" [...] are stunning, both {{displaying the}} Beyoncé trademark of creepily submissive lyrics matched with dominatrix vocals and arrangements to superb effect.

[...] which sounds like a military command, and proceeds to put <b>you</b> <b>through</b> a series of moves without pause for breath, Beyoncé and her minions cracking the whip every time you even think of flagging.|$|E
500|$|The third track, [...] "Rock and Roll Dreams Come Through", is {{a prayer}} to rock music, celebrating {{how it is}} always there to help <b>you</b> <b>through</b> troubled times. One of its lyrics is [...] "You're never alone, 'cause you can put on the 'phones and let the drummer tell your heart what to do." [...] The fourth track also has dark overtones. [...] "It Just Won't Quit", Steinman explains, [...] "is {{about the fact that}} there are some things you never shake off... That's love, I guess." [...] "Out of the Frying Pan (And into the Fire)" [...] is a more upbeat song.|$|E

500|$|With {{no return}} address, Balzac {{was left to}} reply in the Gazette de France, {{with the hope that}} she would see the notice.

I would like to know you, but feel I have no need to do so.

500|$|Jose F. Promis of Allmusic {{awarded the}} album four stars out of five, calling it [...] "one of [...] most satisfying." [...] Mi Tierra was [...] "a breezy, sunny album with moments of melancholy," [...] and [...] "one {{of her most}} {{consistent}} albums to date." [...] Achy Obejas of the Chicago Tribune gave the album four out of four stars, praised it as [...] "dispensing with the brash sound of more contemporary salsa" [...] and lauded Emilio Estefan for the album's production. Anne Hurley of Entertainment Weekly said that Mi Tierra [...] "will whirl <b>you</b> <b>through</b> an intoxicating landscape of traditional Cuban rhythms and aromatic flavors," [...] and applauded the guest musicians on the album.|$|E
500|$|On January 24, {{an audio}} tape {{said to be}} from Osama bin Laden praised the bombing attempt and warned of further attacks against the United States, but did not claim {{responsibility}} for it. The short recording, which was broadcast on Al Jazeera television, said: [...] "The message delivered to <b>you</b> <b>through</b> {{the plane of the}} heroic warrior Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab was a confirmation of the previous messages sent by the heroes of the September 11." [...] An adviser to the U.S. President said he could not confirm whether the voice was that of bin Laden.

500|$|Matt Zoller Seitz of RogerEbert.com {{gave the}} film {{four out of}} four stars, stating that, [...] "Silence is a monumental work, and a {{punishing}} one. It puts <b>you</b> <b>through</b> hell with no promise of enlightenment, only a set of questions and propositions, sensations and experiences... This is {{not the sort of}} film you 'like' or 'don't like.' It's a film that you experience and then live with." [...] Richard Roeper awarded the film four out of four stars, saying, [...] "When Ferreira finally appears and we learn the truth about where he's been all this time, it further serves Scorsese's central theme about the conflict between adhering to one's sacred vows and traditional beliefs and doing the right thing, the prudent thing, the moral thing, on a very pragmatic level." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2009, Fallout {{designer}} Chris Taylor {{said they}} [...] "never expected that Dogmeat would {{become such a}} popular character." [...] Taylor said: [...] "I always intended that the various NPCs that joined up with the player would come to a violent end. I was shocked when I heard of all the work people went through to keep Dogmeat alive to the end – especially the hell that they went through with the force fields in the Military Base." [...] According to Fallout 2 and Fallout: New Vegas designer Chris Avellone, Dogmeat is [...] "arguably the most successful NPC companion ever" [...] for several reasons: [...] "One, he doesn't talk, so the players can project a personality on to him. Two, he's effective in combat ... and three, he's a dog that stays with <b>you</b> <b>through</b> thick-and-thin. I don't think there's a deeper 'awww' sentiment than people have in their hearts for their pets." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} of the second season, Bryce Wilson of Cinema Blend commented: [...] "The worst moments of this season are merely uninspired, never truly horrible. Slight misses like “Dancin' Homer”, “One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish”, “Bart's Dog Gets an F”, and “The War of the Simpsons” are a bit flat. But even in their lowest points, humor is easy to find." [...] Jeremy Roebuck of KVUE named this episode, along with [...] "Bart Sells His Soul", [...] "Homer the Heretic", [...] "Simpsons Bible Stories", and [...] "She of Little Faith", one of the best Simpsons episodes with a {{religious}} theme. Dawn Taylor of The DVD Journal thought Homer's line to Bart, [...] "I want to share something with you, the three little sentences that will get <b>you</b> <b>through</b> life. Number one: 'Cover for me.' Number two: 'Oh, good idea, boss.' Number three, 'It was like that when I got here.'", was the best line of the episode.|$|E

500|$|Loud was {{recorded}} in various recording studios worldwide including the Larrabee Sound Studios, The Village and Westlake Recording Studios in Los Angeles, Platinum Sound Recording Studios, and Roc the Mic Studios in New York City and The Bunker Studios in Paris. In September 2010, during a webchat with her fansite Rihannadaily.com, Rihanna announced that the album would be called Loud, saying [...] "get Loud everybody, get crazy, get excited, because I'm pumped. I'm just gonna be me, because that's what you guys love the most, and that's what makes me feel best. Just being normal, normal for me is Loud! Sassy, fun, flirty, energetic."

500|$|Richard Eder praised Any Human Heart in the New York Times: [...] "William Boyd, is {{multifaceted}} and inventive, and {{he plays}} a deep game under his agile card tricks." [...] Christopher Tayler, in the London Review of Books, called the characterisation of Mountstuart weak and {{wondered if he was}} merely a device through which Boyd could write pastiche about 20th-century writers, [...] "Boyd hustles <b>you</b> <b>through</b> to the end despite all this, but it’s hard not to wonder if it was really worth making the journey." [...] In The Atlantic Monthly, Brooke Allen liked the Mountstuart character: [...] "he is far more generous, forgiving, and free than most of us. He is also more amusing, and more amused by life", thus making an [...] "attractive central character" [...] and Boyd's writing showed [...] "a great natural vitality and an increasingly sophisticated humanism." [...] The Atlantic Monthly selected it as one of the [...] "books of the year".|$|E
500|$|Yeary and McGuire co-wrote a song {{entitled}} [...] "You Never Know" [...] as {{a tribute}} to Ezell. Darryl Worley recorded this song on his 2009 album Sounds Like Life, saying that he considered it [...] "dead-on" [...] for him. Shenandoah has continued to tour in 2009 and 2010 with Yeary on lead vocals, mostly playing at community festivals and county fairs. Yeary engaged country-gospel singer Sonya Isaacs (of The Isaacs) in November 2009. They have since become married and had one son in 2011. He has also written songs for other artists, including [...] "In Another World" [...] by Joe Diffie, [...] "Why Wait" [...] by Rascal Flatts, [...] "Summer Thing" [...] by Troy Olsen, [...] "I'm Gonna Love <b>You</b> <b>Through</b> It" [...] by Martina McBride, and [...] "I Drive Your Truck" [...] by Lee Brice.

500|$|Mega Man X {{received}} {{criticism from}} some publications as well. Ed Semrad, Danyon Carpenter, and Al Manuel of the EGM review panel all {{noted that the}} game may have too low a difficulty level; Semrad disliked the introductory stage and felt that the game was too short as well. Super Play editor Zy Nicholson lowered his review score of the game because he found the levels were neither large nor challenging. [...] "A few elementary tricks like repeating easy sections to recoup energy and weapon power will see <b>you</b> <b>through</b> the harder bits," [...] Nicholson explained. [...] "Within the level you'll also find restart points, extra lives, and no harsh time limit {{to put pressure on}} your performance. Couple this with a password system that records your level completion, status and weapon accumulation and you'll see we're not looking at a lasting challenge for the experienced player." [...] Nintendo Power criticized how little the game had changed stating that [...] "the theme remains the same as the Game Boy and NES Mega Man titles." ...|$|E
500|$|One of {{the editing}} {{techniques}} used in Citizen Kane {{was the use}} of montage to collapse time and space, using an episodic sequence on the same set while the characters changed costume and make-up between cuts so that the scene following each cut would look as if it took place in the same location, but at a time long after the previous cut. In the breakfast montage, Welles chronicles the breakdown of Kane's first marriage in five vignettes that condense 16 years of story time into two minutes of screen time. Welles said that the idea for the breakfast scene [...] "was stolen from The Long Christmas Dinner of Thornton Wilder... a one-act play, which is a long Christmas dinner that takes <b>you</b> <b>through</b> something like 60 years of a family's life." [...] The film often uses long dissolves to signify the passage of time and its psychological effect of the characters, such as the scene in which the abandoned sled is covered with snow after the young Kane is sent away with Thatcher.|$|E
500|$|Boulter {{starred in}} two films in 2008, Daylight Robbery by filmmaker Paris Leonti, and Donkey Punch {{directed}} by Olly Blackburn. Boulter portrayed a character named [...] "Sean" [...] in Donkey Punch, who tags along with character [...] "Josh" [...] as the [...] "quiet brother ... who hits {{it off with}} Tammi". Boulter guest starred on a two-part episode arc [...] "Wounds" [...] in May 2008 of the television series Waking the Dead as character [...] "Jimmy Dearden". He appeared on the television series Survivors as [...] "Neil" [...] in November 2008. He had a recurring role in ten episodes of the television series Casualty in 2010, as [...] "Kieron Fletcher". He portrayed an emergency physician applying for a medical fellowship. He commented on the inherent difficulties in portraying a physician on television: [...] "Playing a doctor is a strange experience. Pretending you know what you're talking about when you don't is very bizarre but there are advisers on set who are fantastic at taking <b>you</b> <b>through</b> procedures and giving you the confidence to stand there and look like you know what you're doing." [...] Boulter starred in the 2011 film Mercenaries directed by Paris Leonti.|$|E
