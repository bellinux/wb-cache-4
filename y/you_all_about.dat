Danzig also has a long-standing interest in New World Order related conspiracies: [...] "Not only have I {{always been interested in}} the families that run the world forever, that people know now as the Bilderberg Group. But thereâ€™s an older book called The Committee of 300 which tells <b>you</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> it. I mean, I got in trouble for this back in the 90s, talking about this kind of stuff -- how the United States is based on a Freemason thing, and I got so many government files on me from that one".|$|E
2500|$|The Court {{warned the}} {{students}} not to delay contacting their families because the Court {{was going to}} write them promptly. Dean Greenough wrote to Roberts: [...] "The letter that I am sending to your father this morning, although it does not tell him everything, necessitates your telling him everything." [...] To Kenneth Day he wrote: [...] "It {{would be better for}} them to hear it from you than from me." [...] The Dean's letters about students who had committed no overt act explained the circumstances at length and provided he Court's rationale for expulsion in such cases: [...] "The acts in question are so unspeakably gross that the intimates of those who commit these acts become tainted." [...] He made a clear distinction by not criticizing such a student's character, but his judgment, calling him [...] "no worse than ignorant, over-curious, and careless." [...] When it came to those who had engaged in homosexual sex, Greenough withheld details yet tried to underscore the significance of the violation. To Roberts' father, Greenough wrote that his son [...] "has promised to tell <b>you</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> the matter, and I hope he will tell you the whole truth. His offense {{has nothing to do with}} low scholarship; it is not gambling, or drink or ordinary sexual intercourse. If he does not confess to something worse than these things, he will not have told you the whole story." ...|$|E
