During her testimony, Rowling reiterated her claim that the Lexicon {{contained}} minimal commentary and merely recycled her writing, adding nothing other than [...] "facetious asides and etymologies of the easiest kind." [...] Rowling referred to the Lexicon as [...] "wholesale theft of 17 years of my hard work", and criticized it as [...] "sloppy" [...] and characterized by [...] "very little research". In sometimes emotional testimony, Rowling recalled beginning the Potter books when she was an impoverished 25-year-old single mother, nearly coming to tears when saying, [...] "These characters continue to mean {{so much to me}} {{over a long period of}} time.

5000|$|From 1998, {{when he led}} a {{delegation}} to the World Council of Churches's world conference in Harare, Zimbabwe, and visited Zambia during a huge national furor over a young gay man's public coming-out in the media, Long was closely involved with sexual rights movements across Africa. He connected homophobia and moral panics in many African countries to economic and political factors, especially the poverty and dislocation caused by structural adjustment programs. Long told the Chicago Tribune, [...] "There's a sense {{of economic and political}} powerlessness, and when <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> powerless <b>about</b> <b>your</b> economy and your country's politics there's a tendency to turn to culture as the one thing you can exert control over." [...] In 2003, IGLHRC and Human Rights Watch released More than a Name: State-Sponsored Homophobia and its Consequences in Southern Africa, a 300-page investigation of the roots of homophobia that Long had researched and authored. Long also co-authored or edited major reports on gay, lesbian, and transgender parenting, and on sexuality-based attacks on women's organizing. He also wrote a widely used guide to grassroots advocacy at the United Nations. While at IGLHRC, Long was responsible for one of the first broad statements on sex workers’ rights ever issued by any international human rights organization, affirming that “Sex workers enjoy the rights to work, to equality before the law, to family, to sustenance, and to a sexual life, in the same degree and under the same conditions as do all other persons.” ...|$|R

30|$|We also {{collected}} {{qualitative data}} to provide further evidence, depth, {{and complexity of}} student experiences in order to triangulate our quantitative findings. We conducted three classroom observations for each class level and took semi-structured field notes. Within our observation field notes, we focused on students’ interactions with their teammates if they were working in pairs, their interactions with mentors, the tools they were using, {{and the state of}} their design products. Additionally, we conducted three interviews (i.e., think-alouds) with each student or student team {{over the course of the}} semester (conditional on parental consent, n[*]=[*] 70). Think-alouds were scheduled at the beginning, middle, and end of the semester. Each think-aloud interview lasted 5 – 10  min and were conducted as students were engaging in the design and construction processes. These think-alouds allowed us to gather real-time information on student’s emotions, interest, and efficacy. Although these interviews were largely unstructured conversations, we did have prompts such such as, “How do <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> project today?” or “Tell me about your progress on this project.” Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed by the researchers.|$|E
40|$|How do we {{determine}} {{the well-being of}} a person when her preferences are not stable across worlds? Suppose, for instance, that you are considering getting married, and {{that you know that}} if you get married, you will prefer being unmarried, and that if you stay unmarried, you will prefer being married. The general problem is to find a stable standard of well-being when the standard is set by preferences that are not stable. In this paper, I shall show that the problem is even worse: inconsistency threatens if we accept both that your desires determine what is good for you and that you must prefer what is better for you. After I have introduced a useful toy model and stated the inconsistency argument, I will go on to discuss a couple of unsuccessful theories and see what we can learn from their mistakes. One important lesson is that how you would have felt about a life had you never led it is irrelevant {{to the question of how}} good that life is for you. What counts is how <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> life when you are actually leading it. Another lesson is that a life can be better for you even if you would not rank it higher, if you were to lead it. ...|$|E
40|$|The State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) {{has been}} widely used in {{research}} with pregnant women. However, {{few studies have examined}} its validity for this group. In this paper the content validity of the STAI, the impact of location and consequences for further participation of higher STAI scores are investigated for 215 pregnant women who completed the STAI at hospital or community based clinics. The study participants answered the open ended question, 'How do <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> pregnancy?' {{and whether or not they}} would be willing to take part in further research. Results indicated that STAI state scores reflected the nature of women's spontaneous comments regarding their pregnancy, with lower anxiety related to more 'positive' comments. The state scores were also found to be sensitive to the risk level associated with the clinic where the inventory was completed; higher scores related to high-risk localities. Women with the highest levels of state or trait anxiety were also less likely to wish to take part in further research. The study concludes that the STAI does reflect the anxiety-related experiences of pregnant women and that its use with pregnant women is appropriate in this respect; however, we recommend that future research notes the issue of potential recruitment biases. © 2010 Society for Reproductive and Infant Psychology...|$|E

40|$|PurposeTo {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} four different prostate cancer treatments on quality of life (QoL) and patient satisfaction. MethodsNinety-six prostate cancer patients were treated with hormone therapy, radical retropubic prostatectomy, high dose rate brachytherapy, or low dose rate brachytherapy. We assessed general, cancer-specific, and prostate disease-specific QoL. More than one year since commencement of treatment, the patients were asked the following questions: 1) How do <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> treatment? 2) Would you undergo the same treatment again?ResultsThe comparison of baseline and 12 -month results showed that general and cancer-specific QoL had changed little in all groups. At baseline, the general and cancer-specific QoL tended to be lower in the hormone therapy patients. In the radical the retropubic prostatectomy patients, all scores on the Medical Outcomes Study 36 -Item Short Form were worse than the baseline scores at three months. Scores for the International Index of Erectile Function- 5 had also worsened, with no recovery. In the low-dose rate brachytherapy patients, the prostate disease-specific QoL at baseline tended to improve. However, the satisfaction levels for each treatment were reasonably good, and most patients would choose the same treatment again. ConclusionsThe results {{of each of the}} four treatments differed in assessments of QoL. In the radical retropubic prostatectomy patients, the decrease in the International Index of Erectile Function- 5 scores was especially remarkable and did not show recovery. In contrast, both brachy therapy groups had attained superior sexual function. However, regardless of the quality of life evaluations, most patients surveyed were satisfied with their treatments and would choose the same treatment again...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Anti-VegF {{therapy for}} the {{treatment}} of neovascular AMD has clear clinical and quality of life benefits, as shown in numerous well conducted studies. It is now being implemented in many healthcare systems. However, treatment often involves multiple assessments and intravitreal drug injections, usually {{over an extended period of}} time. How do patients view this process, particularly at the outset, and how does their actual experience affect their views? Methods: Fifteen patients (mean age 76 y; 6 males) were recruited and interviewed using the Biographical Narrative Interview Method (BNIM) before or just after treatment was commenced. At the end of the BNIM interview, a VFQ 25 was also completed. Nine patients were interviewed several months later after they had received at least the loading dose of three injections. A semi-structured interview technique was used and the MacTSQ (a specific treatment satisfaction questionnaire, in which patients score their most recent treatment episode) administered. Interview data was subjected to thematic analysis, and VFQ 25 and MacTSQ data scored and collated in accordance with published procedures. Results: The intersubject mean (±SD) VFQ 25 General Health and General Vision scores were 57 ± 29 and 61 ± 26 respectively; Near Activities scored 65 ± 32. In BNIM interviews almost all patients said that they had known relatively little about what treatment would entail other than that it required injections into their eye. They reported considerable apprehension pre-treatment. However, post-treatment interview data demonstrated that this apprehension was defused by actual treatment experience. None experienced serious adverse events, and few reported experiencing serious discomfort. Where this did occur, it did not discourage patients from continuing with treatment. These reports were complemented by the Mac TSQ data. The mean overall score was 65 ± 5 / 72 (a higher score indicates greater satisfaction). Item 6 specifically asks "How apprehensive did <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> most recent treatment?". The mean score was 5. 2 ± 1. 1 / 6 (where 6 ="Not apprehensive at all"). Many patients compared their treatment favourably to dental treatment. Conclusions: Our results suggest that patients are, in general, very happy with their treatment experience, returning high scores on the MacTSQ. Better information provision at the outset of their treatment journey may be of value in defusing further the apprehension that they reported in initial interviews...|$|E
40|$|Trata-se de um estudo de abordagem qualitativa que teve o objetivo de compreender como as mulheres com {{diabetes}} mellitus (DM) tipo 2 e obesidade vivenciam o seu corpo, realizado no Centro de Pesquisa e Extensão Universitária do interior paulista, em 2009. O referencial teórico utilizado foi a Fenomenologia da Percepção de Maurice Merleau-Ponty. Para coleta de dados foi utilizada a questão norteadora: Como a senhora se sente com o seu corpo? Foram entrevistadas oito mulheres com {{diabetes mellitus}} tipo 2 e obesidade (IMC 30) com idade de 40 a 76 anos. A coleta de dados foi realizada no referido Centro, às terças-feiras, das 14 às 17 horas, em ambiente preservado, pelo próprio pesquisador, com entrevistas gravadas. Os dados foram submetidos à técnica de análise de conteúdo, o que possibilitou a elaboração de sete categorias temáticas: A falta de vivência do corpo atual; O corpo com intencionalidade e significação; A dualidade da obesidade da proteção a tragédia; A negação e a fragmentação da obesidade no corpo atual/habitual; A obesidade velada percepção do objeto como razão de todas as experiências; O DM como algo que destrói e desfigura o corpo e O DM incorporado no seu corpo e na sua vida. Os resultados mostraram que nas falas das participantes há falta de percepção em relação às mudanças e de responsabilidade para com o seu corpo. As falas também mostraram que as participantes atribuem ao corpo intencionalidades e significados, percebendo-o como algo vergonhoso, desconfortável, limitador, pesado, fatigado, ruim, desproporcional, preocupante, um inferno na sua vida e em outros, como meio de expressão, afeto, defesa, companheirismo, parte de si, aceitação e conformismo. As participantes expressam a percepção da obesidade no corpo por sentimentos de proteção, ganho, benefício e fazendo parte da personalidade e por outro lado como um veneno, tragédia, peso, incomodo, cansaço, obstáculo, desvantagem, tristeza, insatisfação e promotora de diferenças entre os seres humanos. Nas falas emergiram dificuldades de perceber o corpo atual. A obesidade é atribuída a fatores externos e o DM é percebido como algo amedrontador, ruim, limitador, destruidor, relacionado à luta e a morte. Por outro lado, algumas participantes expressaram percepção de responsabilidade e consciência para com a doença. Nessa direção a equipe multiprofissional de saúde pode (re) significar as atitudes que intensifiquem a valorização dos significados e dos sentimentos, pertencentes às mulheres com DM tipo 2 e obesidade. Ao valorizar os significados e os sentimentos, a equipe multiprofissional de saúde pode incitar os processos psíquicos internos aproximando-as do autocuidado, da autonomia e da responsabilidade para como seu corpo e possibilitando a apropriação das participantes do corpo fenomenal. Dessa forma, espera-se com esse estudo fornecer subsídios para a reflexão dos profissionais de saúde na atenção em saúde às mulheres com DM tipo 2 e obesidade, bem como, para o olhar mais acurado acerca das necessidades não reveladas pelas participantes, mas expressadas pelo seu corpo para pensar um novo fazer em saúde, ou seja, a educação em DM. This {{is a study}} with qualitative approach that aimed to understand how women with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and obesity experience their bodies, performed at the Center for Research and University Extension from an inland city of São Paulo state in 2009. The theoretical framework was the Phenomenology of Perception of Maurice Merleau-Ponty. To collect data we used the guiding question Ḧow do <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> body?. ̈ We interviewed eight women with type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity (BMI 30) aged between 40 and 76 years old. Data collection {{was done by the}} researcher at that Center on Tuesdays from 2 p. m. to 5 p. m. in an appropriate room and was audio recorded. The data were subjected to content analysis technique, which enabled the creation of seven thematic categories: The lack of experience of the current body; The body with intentionality and meaning; The duality of obesity from protection to tragedy; The denial and the fragmentation of obesity in the present/habitual body; The veiled obesity - perception of the object as a reason for all experiences; The DM as something that destroys and disfigures the body and The DM incorporated into your body and your life. The results showed that in the speeches of the participants {{there is a lack of}} awareness regarding the changes and responsibility to their bodies. Their speeches also showed that the participants attach to the body intentions and meanings, seeing it as something shameful, uncomfortable, limiting, heavy, tired, bad, disproportionate, disturbing, hell in their life and in others, as a mean of expression, affection, protection, companionship, part of oneself, acceptance and conformity. The participants expressed the perception of obesity in the body through protective feelings, gain, benefit and part of the personality and, on the other hand, as a poison, tragedy, weight, discomfort, tiredness, hindrance, disadvantage, sadness, dissatisfaction and promoter of differences between humans. In the speeches also emerged difficulties of perceiving the current body. Obesity is attributed to external factors and the DM is perceived as something scary, bad, limiting, destructive, related to fighting and death. On the other hand, some participants expressed perception of responsibility and awareness regarding the disease. In this direction, the multidisciplinary health care team can (re) signify attitudes that intensify the recovery of meanings and feelings that belong to women with type 2 DM and obesity. By valuing the meanings and feelings, the multidisciplinary health care team may encourage internal mental processes approaching the women to self-care, autonomy and accountability with their bodies and allowing the appropriation of the participants of the phenomenal body. Thus, it is hoped with this study to provide information for consideration of health professionals in health care for women with type 2 DM and obesity, as well as to look more accurate on the needs not revealed by participants, but expressed through their bodies to think a new doing in health, in other words, an education in DM...|$|E
