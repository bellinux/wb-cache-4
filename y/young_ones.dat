5|$|When the Whiskers first {{formed in}} 1998, their main rivals were <b>Young</b> <b>Ones,</b> Lazuli, Elveera and Vivian. These were their main rivals for three years, then Gattaca formed {{north of the}} Whiskers {{territory}} and became their rivals. Over the next few years, Vivian {{moved away from the}} Whiskers and Commandos became the Whiskers new rivals. Soon Elveera and Lazuli moved away from the Whiskers and Aztecs form their territory next to the Whiskers. In 2007 Whiskers main rivals were <b>Young</b> <b>Ones,</b> Aztecs and Commandos. Then <b>Young</b> <b>Ones</b> died out, and Kung Fu formed next to Whiskers, Commandos moved away and the Sequoia formed. Today Whiskers main rivals are Toyota, Lazuli, Kung Fu and Sequoia.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1914, when Jolin and his friends from the Matisse Academy {{returned}} to Stockholm, the group became known as De Unga (The <b>Young</b> <b>Ones).</b> Their participation and paintings created uproar in the Baltic Exhibition in Malmö.

5|$|Mallards of {{all ages}} (but {{especially}} <b>young</b> <b>ones)</b> and in all locations must contend with a wide diversity of predators including raptors, mustelids, corvids, snakes, raccoons, opossums, skunks, turtles, large fish, felids, and canids, including domesticated ones. The most prolific natural predators of adult mallards are red foxes (which most often pick off brooding females) and the faster or larger birds of prey, i.e. peregrine falcons, Aquila eagles, or Haliaeetus eagles. In North America, adult mallards face no fewer than 15 species of birds of prey, from northern harriers and short-eared owls (both smaller than a mallard) to huge bald and golden eagles, and about a dozen species of mammalian predator, not counting several more avian and mammalian predators who threaten eggs and nestlings.|$|E

5|$|Plant {{medicines}} {{can cause}} adverse effects and even death, whether by side-effects of their active substances, by adulteration or contamination, by overdose, or by inappropriate prescription. Many such effects are known, while others {{remain to be}} explored scientifically. There {{is no reason to}} presume that because a product comes from nature it must be safe: the existence of powerful natural poisons like atropine and nicotine shows this to be untrue. Further, the high standards applied to conventional medicines do not always apply to plant medicines, and dose can vary widely depending on the growth conditions of plants: older plants may be much more toxic than <b>young</b> <b>ones,</b> for instance.|$|E
5|$|David Mirkin (born September 18, 1955) is an American {{feature film}} and {{television}} director, writer and producer. Mirkin grew up in Philadelphia and intended to become an electrical engineer, but abandoned this career path in favor of studying film at Loyola Marymount University. After graduating, he became a stand-up comedian, and then moved into television writing. He wrote for the sitcoms Three's Company, It's Garry Shandling's Show and The Larry Sanders Show and served as showrunner on the series Newhart. After an unsuccessful attempt to remake the British series The <b>Young</b> <b>Ones,</b> Mirkin created Get a Life in 1990. The series starred comedian Chris Elliott and ran for two seasons, {{despite a lack of}} support from many Fox network executives, who disliked the show's dark and surreal humor. He moved on to create the sketch show The Edge starring his then-partner, actress Julie Brown.|$|E
5|$|Grass is the guinea pig's natural diet. Their molars are {{particularly}} suited for grinding plant matter, and grow continuously throughout the animal's life. Most grass-eating mammals are quite large {{and have a}} long digestive tract; while guinea pigs have much longer colons than most rodents, they must also supplement their diet by coprophagy, the eating of their own feces. However, they do not consume all their feces indiscriminately, but produce special soft pellets, called cecotropes, which recycle B vitamins, fiber, and bacteria required for proper digestion. The cecotropes (or caecal pellets) are eaten directly from the anus, unless the guinea pig is pregnant or obese. They share this behaviour with rabbits. In geriatric boars or sows (the condition is rarer in <b>young</b> <b>ones),</b> the muscles which allow the softer pellets to be expelled from the anus for consumption can become weak. This creates a condition known as anal impaction, which prevents the boar from redigesting cecotropes, though harder pellets may pass through the impacted mass. The condition may be temporarily alleviated by carefully expelling the impacted feces.|$|E
