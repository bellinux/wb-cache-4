5|$|Assessing Valencia's hitting during 2010 spring training, Twins manager Ron Gardenhire said: “I {{guarantee}} <b>you</b> <b>one</b> thing, he can hit a fastball; {{and if he}} sits on {{a breaking}} ball, he can hit that, too.” On June 3, Valencia was called up to replace Michael Cuddyer, who had {{been placed on the}} bereavement list following the death of his father-in-law. In his debut that day, he went 1 for 3.|$|E

5000|$|Yinz is {{the most}} recent {{derivation}} from the original Scots-Irish form <b>you</b> <b>ones</b> or [...] "yous ones", a form of the second person plural commonly heard in parts of Ulster. When standard-English speakers talk {{in the first person}} or third person, they use different pronouns to distinguish between singular and plural. In the first person, for example, speakers use the singular I and the plural we. But when speaking in the second person, you performs double duty as both the singular form and the plural form. Crozier (1984) suggests that during the 19th century, when many Irish speakers switched to speaking English, they filled this gap with <b>you</b> <b>ones,</b> primarily because Irish has a singular second-person pronoun, tú, as well as a plural form, sibh. The following therefore {{is the most}} likely path from <b>you</b> <b>ones</b> to yinz: <b>you</b> <b>ones</b> [...] > you'uns [...] >youns [...] > yunz [...] > yinz [...] Because there are still speakers who use each form, there is no stable second-person plural pronoun form in southwest or central Pennsylvania—which is why this pronoun is variably referred to or spelled as you'uns, y'ins, y'uns, yunz, yuns, yinz, yenz, yins or ynz.|$|R

When I send a bit of investigation to Edinburgh, the W. H. of that ilk says I took it from him. When I send <b>you</b> <b>one,</b> you take it from me, generalize it at a glance, bestow it thus generalized upon society at large, and make me the second discoverer of a known theorem.|$|E
25|$|With {{millions}} of others I had prayed hard {{at the time of}} Dunkirk and never did prayer seem to be more speedily answered to the full. And we prayed for France and the next day she surrendered. I thought much, and when I went to bed I lay for a long time vividly awake. And I went over in my mind what had happened, concentrating on the thoughts that you had dwelt on, that prayer to be effective must be in accordance with God's will, and that by far the hardest thing to say from the heart and indeed the last lesson we learn (if we ever do) is to say and mean it, ‘Thy will be done.’ And I thought what mites we all are and how we can never see God's plan, a plan on such a scale that it must be incomprehensible. And suddenly for what must have been a couple of minutes I seemed to see with extraordinary and vivid clarity and to hear someone speaking to me. The words at the time were clear, but the recollection of them had passed when I seemed to come to, as it were, but the sense remained, and the sense was this. ‘You cannot see the plan’; then ‘Have you not thought there is a purpose in stripping <b>you</b> <b>one</b> by one of all the human props on which you depend, that you are being left alone in the world? You have now one upon whom to lean and I have chosen you as my instrument to work with my will. Why then are you afraid?’ And to prove ourselves worthy of that tremendous task is our job.|$|E

500|$|... 1926 – [...] "If I Could Be with <b>You</b> (<b>One</b> Hour Tonight)" [...] {{is a song}} {{composed}} by James P. Johnson with lyrics by Henry Creamer. It was introduced by Clarence Williams' Blue Five with vocalist Eva Taylor. McKinney's Cotton Pickers popularized the song with their 1930 recording and used it as their theme song. Louis Armstrong also recorded a popular version in 1930.|$|E
500|$|On his deathbed, Augustus boasted [...] "I found a Rome of bricks; I {{leave to}} <b>you</b> <b>one</b> of marble." [...] Although {{there is some}} truth in the literal meaning of this, Cassius Dio asserts {{that it was a}} metaphor for the Empire's strength. Marble could be found in {{buildings}} of Rome before Augustus, but it was not extensively used as a building material until the reign of Augustus.|$|E

[...] In the final verse, he quotes from the gospels of St Matthew and St Mark, lamenting those who [...] "gain the world and lose their soul". Author Ian MacDonald defends the [...] "accusatory finger" [...] behind such statements, saying that, within the ideology of the emerging 1960s counterculture, [...] "this is a token of what was then felt to be a revolution in progress: an inner revolution against materialism." ...|$|E
500|$|Youngs {{reported}} {{to spring training}} in Marlin, Texas with the Giants in 1917. They initially assigned him to the Rochester Hustlers, a team in the International League with which the Giants had a working relationship. Giants manager John McGraw told Mickey Doolan, {{the manager of the}} Hustlers, [...] "I'm giving <b>you</b> <b>one</b> of the greatest players I've ever seen. Play him in the outfield. If anything happens to him, I'm holding you responsible." [...] In 140 games with Rochester, Youngs hit [...]356, earning himself a late-season promotion to the big league club. McGraw gave Youngs the nickname [...] "Pep" [...] due to his hustle and soon began to groom Youngs to become his successor as Giants' manager.|$|E
500|$|Many reasons {{have been}} {{suggested}} {{for the failure of}} Sinclair Vehicles and what Dale calls [...] "the jigsaw of the C5's disappointment". One of the receivers of Sinclair Vehicles, John Sapte, suggested that Sinclair had taken the wrong tack with its marketing of the C5: [...] "It was presented as a serious transport, when perhaps it should have been presented as a luxury product, an up-market plaything." [...] Ellar's director Maurice Levensohn took exactly this tack when he purchased Sinclair Vehicles' remaining stock, saying that his company would market them as [...] "a sophisticated toy": [...] "If you were a little boy, wouldn't you want your parents to get <b>you</b> <b>one</b> this Christmas?" [...] His strategy was notably successful; Ellar sold nearly 7,000 C5s at up to £700 each, far more (and at a higher price) than Sinclair had ever managed.|$|E

500|$|Abbott is the {{inventor}} of a style of maze called logic mazes. A logic maze has a set of rules, ranging from the basic (such as [...] "you cannot make left turns") to the extremely complicated. These mazes are also called [...] "Multi-State mazes". [...] The reason for this name is that sometimes you can return to a position you were in before, but be traveling in a different direction. That change in direction can {{put you in a}} different state and open up different choices for <b>you.</b> <b>One</b> example, from the book SuperMazes, would be a rolling-die maze. Where you can move from a particular square depends on what number is facing up on the die. If you return to that same square, the die may be in a different state, with a different number on top. Thus, you would have different options than the first time.|$|E
500|$|... "One Time" [...] is {{described}} {{to be in}} a [...] "moderately slow groove". Washington Post called the track, along with 'Love Me' [...] "modest club tracks." [...] About.com described it as a [...] "solid midtempo beat." [...] The song is composed in the key of C♯ minor. The song is moderately paced, and the introduction and outro are sung in a sing-and-tell format with Bieber repetitively voicing the line [...] "Me plus you/Imma tell <b>you</b> <b>one</b> time." [...] The verses are sung with backing R infused bass beats with a light string background in the same moderate pace before the bridge prepares for the refrain through the lines [...] "Your world is my world/My fight is your fight/My breath is your breath/And your heart." [...] Bieber goes into the middle eight the backing is not as much indistinguishable {{from the rest of the}} song, but is delivered a little slower leading up to the chorus and outro.|$|E
500|$|Not all reviews were {{completely}} negative; others were more mixed. Tom Kessenich, {{in his book}} Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files gave the episode a mixed review, writing [...] "as far as [...] go, 'Agua Mala' was pretty standard fare." [...] However, he criticized the episodes resolution, noting that Scully should have {{had no way to}} know pure water would kill the creature. Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four. Vitaris wrote that, [...] "'Agua Mala' won't end up on anybody's 'best of' list, but it's so silly that it's sort of fun." [...] Timothy Sexton from Yahoo! News named [...] "The Hurricane Monster" [...] as one of [...] "The Best X-Files Monsters of the Week", writing, [...] "I'll tell <b>you</b> <b>one</b> thing about this X-Files episode and this X-Files monster: you'll never go to the bathroom during a rainstorm again without thinking twice." ...|$|E
