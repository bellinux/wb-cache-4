5|$|Geochronology {{of several}} Archean rock units {{establishes}} {{a sequence of}} events, approximately 75 million years in duration, leading {{to the formation of}} a new crustal segment. The oldest rocks, at 2,650 million years old, are basic metavolcanics with largely calc-alkaline characteristics. Radiometric dating indicates ages of 2,640 to 2,620 million <b>years</b> <b>are</b> recorded for the syn-kinematic quartz diorite batholiths and 2,590 to 2,100 million years for the major late-kinematic bodies.

5000|$|On Earth, the {{variation}} in the lengths of the tropical <b>years</b> <b>is</b> small, but on Mars it is much larger.

Averaging over an entire orbital period gives a tropical year of 668.5921 sols. (Since, like Earth, {{the northern and southern}} hemispheres of Mars have opposite seasons, equinoxes and solstices must be labelled by hemisphere to remove ambiguity.) ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to school houses, {{for many years}} the form <b>years</b> <b>were</b> named. First <b>year</b> students <b>were</b> classified as [...] "Discovery" [...] Year students in recognition of their new status in the school. Second <b>year</b> <b>was</b> named [...] "Exploration"; the third <b>year</b> <b>was</b> [...] "Understanding"; the fourth <b>year</b> <b>was</b> [...] "Preparation" [...] - as they prepared for their examination years; and the fifth <b>year</b> <b>was</b> [...] "Appreciation" [...] - a somewhat arrogant statement that the students were appreciating all the school had done for them. The sixth form was named Lower and Upper Sixth years. The naming convention was abandoned in 2002.|$|R

5|$|Some {{people in}} {{government}} {{want to say}} that safety is priority number one, but when the federal government provides some guidances for safety measure which would reduce death by 37%, such as alcohol in 1998 or motorcycle helmet in 1967, around ten <b>years</b> <b>are</b> necessary for such measures be implemented by a number of local governments.|$|E
5|$|The El Niño–Southern Oscillation is a {{major factor}} in the {{variation}} of annual precipitation within Buenos Aires and the Pampas, particularly during spring and summer. During an El Niño year, precipitation is higher, with a significant increase in precipitation from November to January. In contrast, La Niña <b>years</b> <b>are</b> associated with lower precipitation; precipitation is below average during October–December.|$|E

5|$|A {{declared}} vulnerable species, {{it occurs}} in two disjunct populations on granite outcrops along the south coast of Western Australia, with the main population near Albany and a smaller population near Walpole, and is threatened by dieback (Phytophthora cinnamomi) and aerial canker (Zythiostroma). B. verticillata is killed by bushfire and new plants regenerate from seed afterwards. Populations take over a decade to produce seed and fire intervals of greater than twenty <b>years</b> <b>are</b> needed to allow the canopy seed bank to accumulate.|$|E
5|$|A radical {{strategy}} for avoiding predators which may otherwise kill {{a large majority}} of the emerging young of a population is to emerge very rarely, at irregular intervals. This strategy is seen in dramatic form in the periodical cicadas, which emerge at intervals of 13 or 17 years. Predators with a life-cycle of one or a few <b>years</b> <b>are</b> unable to reproduce rapidly enough in response to such an emergence, so predator satiation is a likely evolutionary explanation for the cicadas' unusual life-cycle, though not the only one. Predators may still feast on the emerging cicadas, but are unable to consume more than a fraction of the brief surfeit of prey.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the wind}} power {{industry}} {{was affected by}} the global financial crisis in 2009 and 2010, GWEC predicts that the installed capacity of wind power will be 792.1 GW {{by the end of}} 2020 and 4,042 GW by end of 2050. The increased commissioning of wind power is being accompanied by record low prices for forthcoming renewable electric power. In some cases, wind onshore is already the cheapest electric power generation option and costs are continuing to decline. The contracted prices for wind onshore for the next few <b>years</b> <b>are</b> now as low as 30 USD/MWh.|$|E
5|$|As {{with most}} small birds, {{mortality}} {{in the first}} year of life is high, but adults aged three to four <b>years</b> <b>are</b> regularly recorded, and the record is more than seven years. Eggs, chicks and fledglings of this ground-nesting species are taken by stoats, weasels and crows such as the European magpie, and the adults are hunted by birds of prey, particularly the sparrowhawk. Small birds are also at the mercy of the weather, particularly when migrating, but also on the breeding and wintering grounds.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{concerns}} of long-term adverse side effects such as calcification of arteries and kidney stones, the U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) both set Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (ULs) for {{the combination of}} dietary and supplemental calcium. From the IOM, people ages 9-18 <b>years</b> <b>are</b> not supposed to exceed 3,000 mg/day; for ages 19-50 not to exceed 2,500 mg/day; for ages 51 and older, not to exceed 2,000 mg/day. The EFSA set UL at 2,500 mg/day for adults but decided the information for children and adolescents was not sufficient to determine ULs.|$|E
