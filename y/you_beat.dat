500|$|Sudeep {{received}} national {{recognition for}} {{his performance in}} Eega; Rajinikanth told him, [...] "I thought I was the best villain to date. But <b>you</b> <b>beat</b> me to it". His performance was appreciated by other celebrities such as Akkineni Nagarjuna, Mahesh Babu, and Ram Gopal Varma; Varma said he recognised Sudeep's potential after watching Eega, adding, [...] "Many take his acting in that film for granted, with respect to his expressions when interacting with the fly, but as a director, I know {{how difficult it is}} to act when you are imagining the fly to be there". Sudeep's performance in Naan Ee impressed filmmaker Chimbu Deven, who cast him as the antagonist in Puli (2015).|$|E

Brian Jacks of MTV complimented the show's focus on whale conservation, writing, [...] "Leave it to the hard-hitting folks at South Park to do more for conservationism than fifteen cable reality shows put together." [...] Josh Modell of The A.V. Club said the episode was unfunny and mocked a television series that was [...] "culturally insignificant" [...] and not particularly well-known. Modell wrote, [...] "The show's star, Paul Watson, seems to have really pissed off South Park's creators Parker and Stone [...] Fine, but could you make me laugh a few times while <b>you</b> <b>beat</b> me {{over the head with}} information about a guy that I couldn't care less about?" ...|$|E

Scott told the audience, [...] "When you die, {{it does not mean that}} you lose to cancer. <b>You</b> <b>beat</b> cancer by how you live, why you live, and in the manner in which you live." [...] At the ESPYs, a video was also shown that included scenes of Scott from a clinic room at Johns Hopkins Hospital and other scenes from Scott's life fighting cancer.

500|$|At age 10, Ryder and {{her family}} moved on again, this time to Petaluma, California. During her first week at Kenilworth Junior High, she was bullied {{by a group of}} her peers who mistook her for an effeminate, scrawny boy. [...] "I was wearing an old Salvation Army shop boy’s suit. As I went to the {{bathroom}} I heard people saying, ‘Hey, faggot’. They slammed my head into a locker. I fell to the ground and they started to kick the shit out of me. I had to have stitches. The school kicked me out, not the bullies... Years later, I went to a coffee shop and I ran into one of the girls who’d kicked me, and she said, ‘Winona, Winona, can I have your autograph?’ And I said, ‘Do you remember me? Remember in seventh grade <b>you</b> <b>beat</b> up that kid?’ And she said, ‘Kind of’. And I said, ‘That was me. Go fuck yourself.’" [...] As a result, Ryder ended up being home-schooled that year.|$|E

500|$|His autobiography, Conn Smythe: If <b>You</b> Can't <b>Beat</b> 'Em in the Alley, {{written with}} Scott Young, was {{published}} posthumously in 1981. The title {{was taken from}} Smythe's credo, [...] "If <b>you</b> can't <b>beat</b> 'em in the alley, <b>you</b> can't <b>beat</b> 'em on the ice." [...] In Smythe's memoir he describes it as the most misunderstood remark he ever made. Rather than meaning that his players should go out and bully the opposition, he meant the opposite; that his players should refuse to be bullied by the opposition.|$|R

500|$|... "I Care" [...] {{comprised}} 75 {{tracks in}} total: 35 {{for the music}} and 40 for the vocals. According to Swivel, the main challenge in mixing [...] "I Care" [...] was hand‑aligning every single drum shot as it was time-consuming. He said, [...] "It's super‑monotonous, but it's the best way I can do it. If <b>you</b> <b>Beat</b> Detective the drums to the grid, it's never perfect." [...] As the layering of the drums had to be right on the millisecond, Swivel did one kick and snare at a time. This helped him ensure that the kicks line up with the programmed drums, hence preventing any phase inversion. Accordingly, each drum punched through as strongly as the last. The inspiration for the main drum sound on [...] "I Care" [...] came to Swivel at around four {{o'clock in the morning}} during a mixing session. He took a large plate sound from Avid’s D‑Verb plug‑in, rolled the high frequencies off at 8.6kHz, and sent it through an SSL channel strip with a gate on it, setting the release time to 0.6 seconds. He said, [...] "It's a really basic plug‑in, and I used a very 80s‑sounding gated reverb." ...|$|E
500|$|On July 7, he was {{selected}} to his seventh consecutive All-Star Game, played at Great American Ball Park in Cincinnati. [...] In the Reds' clubhouse for the All-Star Game, Molina shared a locker with Reds' second baseman Brandon Phillips. [...] Since the brawl between the Cardinals and Reds in 2010, [...] the two mended their schism, and Molina has a photograph of their families together. [...] When informed whose locker he was using, Molina replied, [...] "This is Phillips' locker? [...] How about that? [...] I'll have to write something to him." [...] While the pregame roster introductions were made, Reds fans booed all six Cardinals players who were selected, and even former Cardinal Albert Pujols. [...] When Molina was introduced, he smiled and turned and pointed his thumbs {{toward the back of}} his jersey. [...] Pujols provided levity when he then joined in the booing. [...] After the game, Molina remarked to reporters, [...] "when you spend 12 years coming to Cincinnati and <b>you</b> <b>beat</b> them so many times, they’re going to boo you." [...] In his career to that point, he hit [...]319 with a [...]352 on-base percentage and [...]500 slugging percentage in 270 career at-bats at Great American Ball Park.|$|E

Dr. Claire Rusbridge expressed her incredulity: [...] "If you took a stick and <b>you</b> <b>beat</b> a dog to create this pain that you could get from Syringomyelia, you'd be prosecuted, but there's nothing to stop you from breeding a dog that can be painful." ...|$|E

He then turned towards the Yorkshire border with greatly augmented forces.

If York were lost or did not need his help, Rupert was to make all haste southward via Worcester.

2500|$|Bryant {{established}} {{a reputation for}} taking shots in the closing moments of tight games, even amid double or triple teams, and has been noted as {{being one of the}} premier closers in the NBA. In an annual survey of NBA general managers, he was selected in 2012 for the 10th consecutive season as the player they most wanted taking the shot with the game on the line. Bryant enjoys being the villain, and revels in being booed and silencing the crowd with his play. His ability to make difficult shots has also drawn criticism of his shot selection. Throughout his career, he has been disparaged for being a selfish high-volume shooter; he has missed more field goal attempts in his career than any other player in NBA history. Phil Jackson states that Bryant [...] "tends to force the action, especially when the game isn't going his way. When his shot is off, Kobe will pound away relentlessly until his luck turns." [...] According to Bryant, [...] "I would go 0 for 30 before I would go 0 for 9; 0 for 9 means <b>you</b> <b>beat</b> yourself, you psyched yourself out of the game." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{success of}} [...] "He Stopped Loving Her Today" [...] led CBS Records to renew Jones' {{recording}} contract and sparked {{new interest in}} the singer. He {{was the subject of}} an hour-and-a-quarter-long HBO television special entitled George Jones: With a Little Help from His Friends, which saw him performing songs with Waylon Jennings, Elvis Costello, Tanya Tucker, and Tammy Wynette, among others. Jones continued drinking and using cocaine, appearing at various awards shows to accept honors for [...] "He Stopped Loving Her Today" [...] arguably inebriated, like when he performed [...] "I Was Country When Country Wasn't Cool" [...] with Barbara Mandrell at the 1981 Country Music Association Awards. [...] He was involved in several high-speed car chases with police, which were reported on the national news, and one arrest was filmed by a local TV crew; the video, which is widely available online, offers a glimpse into Jones' alter ego when drinking, as he argues with the police officer and lunges at the camera man. Conversely, when sober, Jones was known to be friendly and down to earth, even shy. [...] In a 1994 article on Jones, Nick Tosches remarked that when he first interviewed the singer in April 1976, [...] "One could readily believe the accounts by those who had known him for years: that he had not changed much at all and that he had been impervious to fame and fortune." [...] In an unusually unguarded self-appraisal in 1981, the singer told Mark Rose of The Village Voice, [...] "I don't show a lot of affection. [...] I have probably been a very unliked person among family, like somebody who was heartless. [...] I saved it all for the songs. [...] I didn't know you were supposed to show that love person to person. [...] I guess I always wanted to, but I didn't know how. [...] The only way I could would be {{to do it in a}} song." [...] Years later he commented to The Christian Broadcasting Network's Scott Ross about himself, [...] "I think you're mad at yourself, I think that you're sayin' to yourself 'You don't deserve this. [...] You don't deserve those fans. [...] You don't deserve makin' this money.' [...] And you're mad at yourself. [...] And <b>you</b> <b>beat</b> up on yourself by drinkin' and losing friends that won't put up with that...It's just one terrible big mess you make out of your life." [...] In 1982, Jones recorded the album A Taste of Yesterday's Wine with Merle Haggard; [...] while Jones, in the wake of his condition, appeared underweight on the album cover, his singing was flawless. [...] His run of hits also continued in the early 1980s, with the singer charting [...] "I'm Not Ready Yet", [...] "Same Ole Me" [...] (backed by the Oak Ridge Boys)", [...] "Still Doin' Time", [...] "Tennessee Whiskey", [...] "We Didn't See a Thing" [...] (a duet with Ray Charles), and [...] "I Always Get Lucky with You", which was Jones' last number one in 1984.|$|E
