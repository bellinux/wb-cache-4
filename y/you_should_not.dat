25|$|Critics {{assert that}} naked CDSs should be banned, {{comparing}} them to buying fire insurance on your neighbor’s house, which creates a huge incentive for arson. Analogizing {{to the concept}} of insurable interest, critics say <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> be able to buy a CDS—insurance against default—when you do not own the bond. Short selling is also viewed as gambling and the CDS market as a casino.|$|E

500|$|Squab pie {{has been}} the subject of poetry. In [...] "The Squab-Pie. A Devonshire Tale" [...] {{published}} in 1827, John Taylor uses verse to tell of the captain of a ship in Plymouth who forgot to get meat for his trip. A boy on the ship goes into town to claim a large squab pie from the bakery for a penny, though it was not meant to be his. Set on a Sunday, the family who had commissioned the pie from the baker, in order to avoid cooking, try to find it, but to no avail. Taylor explains the moral is that if you believe it is a sin to cook on a Sunday, <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> be still having a big meal by getting a baker to cook for you.|$|E
500|$|Wiedemann and Lammers had {{provided}} assurances that Hess {{would not be}} harmed. In August 1940, Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler, issued {{a letter to the}} Düsseldorf Gestapo ordering that Hess should not be [...] "inopportuned in any way whatsoever". Noting that Hess had been [...] "both in the same company as the Führer and briefly the Führer's company commander", Himmler instructed that Hess should be granted [...] "relief and protection as per the Führer's wishes" [...] and asked that he be informed if Hess should leave Düsseldorf. A follow-up letter was sent by Lammers in November 1940, informing Hess that [...] "it is, however, the Führer's wish that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> be subject to any further restrictions because of your ancestry beyond those required by law." [...] Lammers expressly informed Hess that he was to use the letter for his protection: [...] "I give you this letter, if necessary, to make use [...] ".|$|E

500|$|On May 7, 1972, Kemper {{was driving}} in Berkeley {{when he picked}} up two 18-year-old hitchhiking Fresno State students, Mary Ann Pesce and Anita Mary Luchessa, on the pretext of taking them to Stanford University. After driving for an hour, he managed to reach a secluded wooded area near Alameda, which he was {{familiar}} with from {{his work at the}} Highway Department, without alerting his passengers that he had changed directions from where they wanted to go. Here he intended to rape them, but having learned from serial rapists in Atascadero that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> leave witnesses, he instead handcuffed Pesce and locked Luchessa in the trunk, before stabbing and strangling Pesce to death and killing Luchessa in a similar manner. Kemper later confessed that while handcuffing Pesce he [...] "brushed the back of [...] hand against one of her breasts and it embarrassed [...] " [...] before adding that [...] " [...] even said 'whoops, I'm sorry' or something like that" [...] after grazing her breast, despite murdering her merely minutes later.|$|E
500|$|Jervis {{could also}} be {{exceptionally}} kind when {{he felt that the}} situation warranted it. On one occasion, while the fleet was becalmed the men of the flagship were ordered to bathe. The men leapt over the side to swim in a sail that had been lowered over the side. One of the men, a senior able seaman, jumped in wearing his trousers. In one of the pockets he had his prize money and back pay that he had been saving for several years. The bank notes were destroyed by the water and when the man came aboard and discovered what had happened he began to weep. The Admiral saw the man and asked the problem. One of his officers told him and St Vincent went to his cabin. When he returned he had the crew mustered and called the man forward. [...] "Roger Odell you are convicted, Sir, by your own appearance of tarnishing the British oak with tears. What have you to say in your defence why <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> receive what you deserve?" [...] The man told him what had happened and St Vincent replied [...] "Roger Odell {{you are one of the}} best men in this ship you are moreover a captain of a top and in my life I never saw a man behave himself better in battle than you did in the Victory in the action with the Spanish fleet. To show therefore that your Commander-in-chief will never pass over merit wheresoever he may find it. There is your money Sir!" [...] The Earl produced £70 of his own money and presented it to the surprised sailor [...] "but no more tears mind, no more tears Sir".|$|E

2500|$|In September 2007, The Huffington Post {{published}} Hart's letter, [...] "Unsolicited Advice to the Government of Iran", {{in which}} he stated that [...] "Provocation is no longer required to take America to war" [...] and warns Iran that [...] "for the next sixteen months or so, <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> only not take provocative actions, <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> {{seem to be doing}} so."

2500|$|The {{purpose of}} reform was {{to prop up}} the {{centrally}} planned economy—not to transition to market socialism. Speaking in late summer 1985 to the secretaries for economic affairs of the central committees of the East European communist parties, Gorbachev said: [...] "Many of you see the solution to your problems in resorting to market mechanisms in place of direct planning. Some of you look at the market as a lifesaver for your economies. But, comrades, <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> think about lifesavers but about the ship, and the ship is socialism." ...|$|E

So, future food-production increases will have to come from higher yields. And though I have no doubt yields will keep going up, whether they can go up enough to feed the population monster is another matter. Unless progress with agricultural yields remains very strong, the next century will experience sheer human misery that, on a numerical scale, will exceed the worst of everything that has come before".|$|E
