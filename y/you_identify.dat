USA Today cited the character as being one of the [...] "top 25 most influential people of the past 25 years" [...] in 2007, adding that Homer [...] "epitomized the irony and irreverence at the core of American humor." [...] Robert Thompson, director of Syracuse University's Center for the Study of Popular Television believes that [...] "three centuries from now, English professors are going to be regarding Homer Simpson as one of the greatest creations in human storytelling." [...] Animation historian Jerry Beck described Homer as one of the best animated characters, saying, [...] "you know someone like it, or <b>you</b> <b>identify</b> with (it). That's really the key to a classic character." [...] Homer has been described by The Sunday Times as [...] "the greatest comic creation of [...] time".

500|$|Mic {{organized}} {{a list of}} [...] "5 Reasons Claire Huxatable (sic) is the Ultimate Feminist Mom", and The Huffington Post crowned The Cosby Show [...] "One of the Most Feminist Shows of All Time" [...] due to individual contributions from both Clair and Cliff. Dubbed the [...] "feminist rant" [...] by media publications, Clair's speech to future son-in-law Elvin about gender roles in marriage in the episode [...] "Cliff in Love" [...] is often lauded {{as one of the}} character's greatest moments, to which the studio audience responded with enthusiastic applause. CNN ranked the rant their seventh favorite The Cosby Show moment. Slates Jason Bailey hailed the scene as [...] "Rashad’s finest moment on the show." [...] The rant has proven so popular that it continues to be frequently quoted and referenced on the Internet and social media. Pastes Shannon M. Houston believes that [...] "If you’re a woman, and you work, and <b>you</b> <b>identify</b> as a feminist, there’s a 90 percent chance you or someone you know has posted that clip". Additionally, Houston believes that the scene remains so popular because the discussion about women in the workplace has hardly changed since the episode first aired 30 years ago. According to Nico Lang of The Daily Dot, Clair taught an entire generation [...] "what a strong, successful woman looked like". Former United States First Lady Michelle Obama has constantly been compared to Clair, by which Obama admitted she is flattered because she considers the character to be an [...] "American icon". Patrice Evans of Jezebel wrote that although [...] "Michelle Obama might be taking the baton as the quintessential symbol of the professional black woman/doting mother ... she'll still need Barack to win a second term before she can approach the status of Clair Huxtable." [...] However, Rashad herself has discredited the Clair-Obama comparisons. LGBT rights activist Janet Mock cites Clair as one of her biggest influences: [...] "I wanted to be her; I wanted to be beautiful, be successful, and maybe have a great family and a brownstone in Brooklyn." ...|$|E

2500|$|Recently, global pollsters {{and psychologists}} have studied {{individual}} differences {{in the sense of}} global citizenship. Beginning in 2005, the World Values Survey, administered across almost 100 countries, included the statement, “I see myself as a world citizen.” [...] For smaller studies, several multi-item scales have been developed, including Sam McFarland and colleagues’ Identification with All Humanity scale (e.g., “How much do <b>you</b> <b>identify</b> with (that is, feel a part of, feel love toward, have concern for) [...] [...] [...] all humans everywhere?”), Anna Malsch and Alan Omoto’s Psychological Sense of Global Community (e.g., “I feel a sense of connection to people all over the world, even if I don’t know them personally”), Gerhard Reese and colleagues’ Global Social Identity scale (e.g. “I feel strongly connected to the world community as a whole.”), and Stephen Reysen and Katzarska-Miller's global citizenship identification scale (e.g., “I strongly identify with global citizens.”). These measures are strongly related to one another, but they are not fully identical.|$|E
