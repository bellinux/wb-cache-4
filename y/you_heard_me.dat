500|$|The episode {{received}} primarily positive reviews, with critical attention mostly {{going to}} Veronica and Logan's relationship. Price Peterson of TV.com gave the episode a positive review, noting that [...] "bviously {{the most notable}} aspect of this episode was the Logan-Veronica hookup.

[...] Television Without Pity gave the episode a [...] "B+", writing that [...] " [...] kisses Logan! <b>You</b> <b>heard</b> <b>me!</b> How could you not, with all the exclamation points!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I am Kate Caynsard, one of {{the village}} people here," [...] she answered. [...] "I heard you working to-night from outside. <b>You</b> <b>heard</b> <b>me</b> shout back?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never {{mind what}} <b>you</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>me</b> speak, sir; {{circumstances}} alter cases, and {{this case is}} altogether an exceptional one.|$|R
60|$|HIGGINS [irritated] The {{question}} is not whether I treat you rudely, but whether <b>you</b> ever <b>heard</b> <b>me</b> treat anyone else better.|$|R
6000|$|... “Have <b>you</b> ever <b>heard</b> <b>me</b> utter {{a word in}} my lord’s disparagement?” {{she asked}} hastily, hissing out her words, and {{stamping}} her foot.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{doubt that}} <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>me</b> ask for it, {{though there were}} two teamsters waiting to buy things, who had the good manners to keep away." ...|$|E
6000|$|The blood {{rushed to}} Barbara's face. [...] "The man was your confederate, and you fell {{out over the}} booty--or perhaps <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>me</b> coming and {{arranged}} the little scene for my benefit?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{beg your}} pardon," [...] said a {{pleasant}} but somewhat decided contralto voice, [...] "but I don't think <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>me</b> knock. Ah, I see you did not. May I come in?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are very}} kind, Mr. Laverick. I {{would like to}} see you again very soon. <b>You</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>me</b> sing in Samson and Delilah?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Should you mind," [...] she asked, [...] "if I motored {{down there}} with my publisher--Mr. James Borden? <b>You</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>me</b> speak of him." ...|$|R

[...] Then in English he had summoned his countrymen also to desist. [...] "Sir John Killigrew!" [...] he {{called in a}} loud voice. [...] "Hold your hand until <b>you</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>me!</b> Call your men back and let none others come aboard! Hold until <b>you</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>me,</b> I say, then wreak your will." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{went in to}} get it"--touching the music--"just because <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>me</b> say I {{would like}} those songs. A four days' ride, and a {{blizzard}} raging on one of them!" [...] she said.|$|E
6000|$|... 'You'll {{come to me}} {{tomorrow}} morning, and you shall be shown where that old gentleman lives; that old gentleman who was with me this morning; where you are going, as <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>me</b> say.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pardon me," [...] she said. [...] "My {{memory for}} faces {{is a bad}} one; and I don't think <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>me</b> just now, when I asked for your name. Have we ever met before?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Me?" [...] {{answered}} the Bumpy Man. [...] "Haven't <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> of <b>me?</b> Gingerbread and lemon-juice! I'm known, far and wide, as the Mountain Ear." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You have heard, {{like all}} the world. But what else of ill have <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> of <b>me,</b> Olaf? Speak out, man; I'm here to learn the truth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is the {{accomplished}} creature, Mr. Bernard Longueville, of whom <b>you</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>me</b> speak. One of his accomplishments, as you see, is to {{drop down}} from the moon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Faith!" [...] he cried, [...] "our surgery hath wrought miracles! You are whole {{beyond what}} I looked for; but surely you are deaf, for my step is heavy enough, yet, me thinks, <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>me</b> not." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear Captain George!" [...] cried little Rebecca in an ecstasy. [...] "How {{good of you}} to come. The General and I were moping {{together}} tete-a-tete. General, this is my Captain George of whom <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>me</b> talk." ...|$|E
6000|$|FATHER DEMPSEY. How {{often have}} <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>me</b> bid you call Mister Keegan in his proper name, {{the same as}} I do? Father Keegan indeed! Can't you tell the {{difference}} between your priest and any ole madman in a black coat? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Colonel!" [...] {{answered}} Lieut. D'Hubert, gently. [...] "But I {{am afraid}} that after <b>you</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>me</b> out as a friend you will take action as my superior officer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, colonel," [...] {{answered}} Lieutenant D'Hubert softly, [...] "but I {{am afraid}} that after <b>you</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>me</b> out as a friend, you will take action as my superior officer." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Very well, then, {{that brings}} me to what I am going to propose. This is a letter from Lord Luxellian. I think <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>me</b> speak of him as the {{resident}} landowner in this district, and patron of this living?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I haven't so much talked as raved," [...] Mr. Bender conceded--"for I'm {{afraid that}} when I do want a thing I rave till I get it. <b>You</b> <b>heard</b> <b>me</b> at Ded-borough, and your enterprising daily press has at last caught the echo." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, my good woman," [...] he said, [...] "I {{hope you}} will see the {{instructions}} <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>me</b> give to Mrs Willis carried out. She is very low, but with good food and careful nursing may do well. Can you give her much of your time?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{little piece}} of vanity! {{studying}} yourself in the glass, so that <b>you</b> never <b>heard</b> <b>me</b> come in? Well, you have done it to some purpose. Where {{did you get that}} thing?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “To be sure. Haven’t <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> of <b>me,</b> Professor Richard De Haven, {{the world-famous}} trainer of mice, rats, and cats? I have {{exhibited}} my mice {{in all the}} countries of the world, and——” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why that's Aunt Temple," [...] I whispered, as {{she came}} forward. [...] "Let me {{introduce}} you, aunt, to Mr Macnab--the jolly fur-trader of whom <b>you</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>me</b> speak so often and so much." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Fie, fie!' replied Sir John (for it was he), 'how very churlish! We were {{speaking}} of you. Your name {{was on my}} lips--perhaps <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>me</b> mention it? No? I am sorry for that. I am really sorry.--You know our friend here, Haredale? This is really a most remarkable meeting!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If ever <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>me</b> {{speak of}} love," [...] said I, [...] "you {{know very well}} that it was your voice which spoke, and not mine. The only words of truth which I have ever been able to say to you are those which you heard when last we met." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{was dead}} when I {{come in the}} room, gentlemen," [...] said the prisoner, strenuously. [...] "He {{was on the floor}} dead, and when I see ’im, I tried to get out.

6000|$|... "I've got no atmosphere; there's {{very little}} of the Indian summer about me! I deal with facts--hard facts," [...] Mrs. Farrinder replied. [...] "Have <b>you</b> ever <b>heard</b> <b>me?</b> If so, <b>you</b> know how crisp I am." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, {{not a word}} further!" [...] almost shrieked Fanny--"Not a word more, Adolphus--not a syllable; at {{any rate}} till <b>you</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>me.</b> Oh, <b>you</b> have made me so miserable!" [...] and Fanny burst into tears.|$|R
