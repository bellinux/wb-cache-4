25|$|By {{the will}} of my {{commander}} in chief, I have come to release the ownership over the Talysh regions {{from the hands of}} the Persians and therefore must take Lankaran. Knowing you are a valiant and prudent leader, I consider it necessary to warn that your resistance will be in vain. Even though you may be a great military leader, but you are no better than Abbas Mirza, who lost at Aslanduz and with that ten thousand soldiers, 500 men as prisoners, all the banners, weapons of which the troops don't have to their disposal right now. As it was at Aslanduz, where here barely escaped along with the 20th horsemen regiment and fled to Tabriz, while he had thirty thousand men at his disposal, and we had just two thousand men. Warriors of the great almighty in the world the Russian emperor crashed Abbas Mirza to pieces, and now they are located here, at the Talysh Khanate. So, when Abbas Mirza could not resist our victorious weapons, despite the fact that his troops outnumbered ours by fifteen times, you reflect that you won't be able either to inflict us a mortal blow here; so I suggest that <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> to voluntarily surrender the fortress to avoid harmful and unnecessary bloodshed, sparing both Abbas Mirza's as well as my warriors. Consider of what you will reach by following sanity, namely saving lives, dignity, and both your property and all affiliated parties' properties in this conflict; otherwise, you will lose everything, if you won't attend the voice of common sense. But it is my duty to tell you, as you will be the one to choose; only I shall be justified in front of God and humanity. I'm ordered not to bombard yet by this letter until I receive response and receipt within three hours.|$|E

Alexander Gambotto-Burke, for Eurogamer, considered Kreia {{to be the}} greatest villain in video gaming, praising her dialogue, Kestelman's [...] "intelligent and subtle" [...] voice-acting, and the way she forced the player into making choices and considering their decisions.

With Holly, whether <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> or not (and I agreed with some of his stuff, not others), I had no doubt he was giving his true opinions on things.

Confiscated {{from its original}} owners, the German authorities permitted [...] to reopen under the directorship of Belgian editor Raymond de Becker, although it remained firmly under Nazi control, supporting the German war effort and espousing anti-Semitism.

[...] Hergé however was heavily enticed by the size of s readership, which reached 600,000, far more than what Le Vingtième Siècle had been able to accomplish. Faced with the reality of Nazi oversight, Hergé abandoned the overt political themes that had pervaded much of his earlier work, instead adopting a policy of neutrality. Without the need to satirise political types, Harry Thompson observed that [...] "Hergé was now concentrating more on plot and on developing a new style of character comedy. The public reacted positively." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hard: These {{people use}} {{contentious}} strategies to influence, utilizing {{phrases such as}} [...] "this is my final offer" [...] and [...] "take it or leave it."
