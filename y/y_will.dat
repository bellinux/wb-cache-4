25|$|The cokurtosis between {{variables}} X and Y {{does not}} depend on the scale on which the variables are expressed.

25|$|Taking {{the mean}} μ of X to be 0, the median of <b>Y</b> <b>will</b> be 1, {{independent}} of the standard deviation σ of X. This is so because X has a symmetric distribution, so its median is also 0. The transformation from X to Y is monotonic, and so we find the median e0 = 1 for Y.|$|E

25|$|This {{situation}} {{represents a}} conflict of interest and duty. Both X and Y hold fiduciary duties to each other, which means they must subdue their own interests in favor of the duo's collective interest. By signing an individual contract and taking all the money, X has put personal interest above the fiduciary duty. Therefore, a court will find that X has breached his fiduciary duty. The judicial remedy here will be that X holds both the contract and the money in a constructive trust for the duo. Note, X will not be punished or totally denied of the benefit; both X and <b>Y</b> <b>will</b> receive a half share in the contract and the money.|$|E
25|$|Two points x and y are {{separated}} if {{each of them}} has a neighbourhood {{that is not a}} neighbourhood of the other; that is, neither belongs to the other's closure. More generally, two subsets A and B of X {{are separated}} if each is disjoint from the other's closure. (The closures themselves {{do not have to be}} disjoint.) All of the remaining conditions for separation of sets may also be applied to points (or to a point and a set) by using singleton sets. Points x and <b>y</b> <b>will</b> be considered separated, by neighbourhoods, by closed neighbourhoods, by a continuous function, precisely by a function, if and only if their singleton sets {x} and {y} are separated according to the corresponding criterion.|$|E

500|$|The {{reason for}} this is that a quantum disjunction, unlike the case for {{classical}} disjunction, can be true even when both of the disjuncts are false and this is, in turn, attributable to the fact that it is frequently the case, in quantum mechanics, that a pair of alternatives are semantically determinate, while each of its members are necessarily indeterminate. This latter property can be illustrated by a simple example. Suppose we are dealing with particles (such as electrons) of semi-integral spin (spin angular momentum) for which there are only two possible values: positive or negative. Then, a principle of indetermination establishes that the spin, relative to two different directions (e.g., x and y) results in a pair of incompatible quantities. Suppose that the state ɸ of a certain electron verifies the proposition [...] "the spin of the electron in the x direction is positive." [...] By the principle of indeterminacy, the value of the spin in the direction <b>y</b> <b>will</b> be completely indeterminate for ɸ. Hence, ɸ can verify neither the proposition [...] "the spin in the direction of y is positive" [...] nor ...|$|E
