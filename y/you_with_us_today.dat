Goethe praised Shakespeare for liberating his mind from the rigid Aristoltelian rules, saying: [...] "I jumped into the free air, and suddenly felt I had hands and feet...Shakespeare, my friend, if <b>you</b> were <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>today,</b> I could only live with you". Herder likewise proclaimed that reading Shakespeare's work opens [...] "leaves from the book of events, of providence, of the world, blowing in the sands of time." ...|$|R

5000|$|Anglophilia {{became popular}} in the German states in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, with the German public being {{especially}} attracted {{to the work of}} Shakespeare, a phenomenon known in Germany as Shakespearomanie. In 1807, August Wilhelm Schlegel translated all of Shakespeare's plays into German, and such was the popularity of Schlegel's translation that German nationalists were soon starting to claim that Shakespeare was actually a German playwright who wrote his plays in English. English actors had been visiting the Holy Roman Empire since the late 16th century to work as [...] "fiddlers, singers and jugglers", and through them the work of Shakespeare had first become known in the Reich. The writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe called the plays of Shakespeare [...] "a huge, animated fair", which he attributed to his Englishness, writing: [...] "Everywhere in England [...] - [...] surrounded by the seas, enveloped in fog and clouds, active {{in all parts of the}} world". In the 18th century Reich, the Francophile German critics preferred the rules of French classical theater which rigidly set precise rules of unities of time and place, and saw Shakespeare's work as a [...] "jumble". In a speech delivered in Frankfurt on 14 October 1771 Goethe praised Shakespeare for liberating his mind from the rigid French rules, saying: [...] "I jumped into the free air, and suddenly felt I had hands and feet...Shakespeare, my friend, if <b>you</b> were <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>today,</b> I could only live with you". In 1995, The New York Times observed: [...] "Shakespeare is an all-but-guaranteed success in Germany, where his work has enjoyed immense popularity for more than 200 years. By some estimates, Shakespeare's plays are performed more frequently in Germany than anywhere else in the world, not excluding his native England. The market for his work, both in English and in German translation, seems inexhaustible." [...] In its turn, the German obsession with Shakespeare made Anglophilia very popular, with the English being praised for their [...] "spontaneous" [...] nature, which allowed people to be themselves. The Osnabrück historian Justus Möser wrote that England was everything that a unified Germany should be, as Britain was a land of [...] "organic" [...] natural order where the aristocracy respected the liberties of the people and had a sense of duty to the nation.|$|R
