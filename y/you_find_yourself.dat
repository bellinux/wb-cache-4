When your flat has been broken into, and you cannot afford a locksmith, it is the money. When you are two pence short of a tin of baked beans, and your child is hungry, it is the money.

500|$|The actor {{was more}} {{successful}} in 2006 with his role opposite Jamie Foxx in Michael Mann's action crime drama, Miami Vice.

(The DVD, released the same year, also managed to sell over a million copies (equivalent to $7.91 million in pirated versions) in its first week alone., and, as of 11 February 2007, had grossed over $36.45million in rentals. A. O. Scott criticised Farrell's work: [...] "When he's not on screen, you don't miss him, and when he is, <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>yourself,</b> before long, looking at someone or something else." [...] Conversely, Peter Travers of Rolling Stone was enthusiastic. The actor also reportedly took a slight pay cut to make friend and recent Oscar winner Jamie Foxx happy: His salary was initially larger than Foxx's.|$|E

Computer and Video Games editors Paul Rand, Tim Boone and Frank O'Connor awarded the game a 98/100, praising it for its gameplay, replayability, sound, and graphics.

500|$|The {{critics who}} {{did not like the}} film were not amused by the film's graphic and comical violence, with Larry Ratliff of San Antonio Express-News noting that [...] "this ambitious, {{scratched}} and weathered venture never manages a real death grip on the senses." [...] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle awarded the film a high rating, but noted that [...] "the Rodriguez segment is terrific; the Tarantino one long-winded and juvenile." [...] Others considered Death Proof to be a deeper and more noteworthy segment. Critic A. O. Scott of The New York Times noted that [...] "t a certain point in Death Proof the scratches and bad splices disappear, and <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>yourself</b> watching not an arch, clever pastiche of old movies and movie theaters but an actual movie." [...] Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert was divided. He gave Grindhouse as a whole {{two and a half stars}} out of four, awarding Planet Terror two stars and Death Proof three stars. Ebert also noted the irony of grindhouse films largely being superseded by many big-budget R-rated mainstream films that included a great deal of nudity and graphic violence.|$|E

[...] Maura Johnston from Popdust gave the song a 5 out of 5, declaring [...] "If there’s any justice in the world this’ll be a song of the summer, or at least of the late spring". Joseph R. Atilano at Inquirer.net noted that [...] "“Still Into You” is really directed to their youngest fans with its happy-go-lucky lyrics that are as cheerful as they can get and somewhat disarming in their simplicity", considering it better than the previous single [...] "Now".|$|E

500|$|In another Rolling Stone interview, {{the band}} {{explained}} {{the meaning of}} the title track, saying that is based on a [...] "whirlwind rocker about the pressures on the band members" [...] and how they have changed as they have aged. Bassist Peter Mosely, in discussion of this, said: [...] "We're older than people think we are. [...] We go through months of serenity, and then there'll be this one night where there will be evil." [...] In another interview discussion about [...] "Lights and Sounds", Key noted that it is [...] "about a band like us coming into a career that we didn't think we'd have. <b>You</b> <b>find</b> <b>yourself</b> surrounded by a lot of false people, {{a lot of people who}} are not doing it for the same reasons you are. That song is about the struggle of not giving in to that." [...] The band explained that the lyrics, [...] "Make it new but stay in the lines / Just let go but keep it inside / Smile big for everyone / Even when you know what they've done / They gave you the end but not where to start / Not how to build, how to tear it apart", were written because of that particular reason. Key also revealed that the lyrics, [...] "They gave you the end / But not where to start / Not how to build / But how to tear it apart", were references to bands Nofx and Bad Religion. Key also explained that when he was preoccupied by distractions, in which he referred to them as [...] "lights and sounds", which ultimately resulted in the band naming the album and track title just that. Key also revealed that it was because that is how it surrounded the band, when working on the album.|$|E
500|$|Pfeiffer {{has long}} been {{referred}} to {{as one of the most}} beautiful actresses in Hollywood, a designation The Daily Telegraph Mick Brown considers to be both [...] "a defining characteristic in her acting career" [...] and [...] "a curse". Pfeiffer initially struggled to convince casting agents and directors to take her seriously as an actress because they perceived her as little more than a pretty face during the early stages of her career. Pfeiffer's acting abilities continued to be overshadowed by her beauty even several years after her breakout performance in Scarface (1983); she responded by pursuing roles in which being blond is not a requirement. The Daily Beast Elizabeth Kaye recognized Pfeiffer among Hollywood's rare [...] "beautiful women" [...] who trust that it is possible to be physically beautiful and serious simultaneously. Kaye believes that the actress achieves this feat by [...] "grafting the sensibility of a modern woman onto the glamour of a '30s icon"; Rolling Stones Gerri Hirshey agreed that Pfeiffer's roles combine [...] "Nineties guts and Thirties glamour." [...] For Interview magazine, Peter Stone described Pfeiffer as a [...] "Blond, sultry, and ethereal" [...] actress with an [...] "unforgettable" [...] face. Nisha Lilia Diu, another The Daily Telegraph contributor, opined, [...] "It's not that she looks younger than she is – she doesn't particularly – it's the symmetry of her bone structure, the flashing aquamarine eyes and those lips, the top one so much fuller than the bottom. It's the kind of beauty <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>yourself</b> involuntarily taking a moment to marvel at mid-conversation." [...] At least two of Pfeiffer's films, Stardust (2007) and Chéri (2009), in which she plays a 5, 000 year old witch obsessed with beauty and a courtesan fading into obscurity, respectively, explore themes of beautiful women struggling with the idea of aging. Pfeiffer personally identified with the topic of [...] "our obsession with youth and the ludicrous degrees to which women will go to reclaim it" [...] portrayed in the films. Pfeiffer claims to not want to appear younger than she is and has yet to undergo plastic surgery, although she admits she would [...] "never say never" [...] to the procedure. Dismissing the claim that she is [...] "drop dead gorgeous", insisting that she is only [...] "conventionally pretty". Pfeiffer has been famously self-deprecating about her own appearance, comparing herself to Howard the Duck.|$|E
