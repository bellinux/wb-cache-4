Refusing to take orders from Germer any more, Smith resigned from the O.T.O., while Parsons [...] who remained sympathetic and friendly to Smith during the conflict [...] ceased lodge activities and resigned as its head. In a letter informing Crowley of this decision, Smith remarked [...] "Would to God you knew <b>your</b> <b>people</b> better." [...] Germer subsequently appointed Max Schneider head of the Agape Lodge, which remained inactive, while Crowley, Germer, and Schneider began spreading lies about Smith, including that he was responsible for raping initiates, claims that were denied by many Lodge members.|$|E

500|$|Górecki now had two texts: {{one from}} a mother to her son, the other from a {{daughter}} to her mother. While looking for a third that would continue the theme, he decided on a mid-15th-century folk song from {{the southern city of}} Opole. Its text contains a passage in which the Virgin Mary speaks to her Son dying on the cross: [...] "O my son, beloved and chosen, Share your wounds with your mother..." [...] (Synku miły i wybrany, rozdziel z matką swoje rany...). Górecki said, [...] "this text was folk-like, anonymous. So now I had three acts, three persons... Originally, I wanted to frame these texts with an introduction and a conclusion. I even chose two verses (5 and 6) from Psalm 93/94 in the translation by Wujek: 'They humiliated <b>Your</b> <b>people,</b> O Lord, and afflicted Your heritage, they killed the widow and the passer-by, murdered the orphans. However, he rejected this format because he believed the structure would position the work as a symphony [...] "about war". Górecki sought to transcend such specifics, and instead structured the work as three independent laments.|$|E
500|$|The SCLC's {{goals were}} {{to fill the}} jails with protesters to force the city {{government}} to negotiate as demonstrations continued. However, not enough people were arrested to affect {{the functioning of the}} city and the wisdom of the plans were being questioned in the black community. The editor of The Birmingham World, the city's black newspaper, called the direct actions by the demonstrators [...] "wasteful and worthless", and urged black citizens to use the courts to change the city's racist policies. Most white residents of Birmingham expressed shock at the demonstrations. White religious leaders denounced King and the other organizers, saying that [...] "a cause should be pressed in the courts and the negotiations among local leaders, and not in the streets". Some white Birmingham residents were supportive as the boycott continued. When one black woman entered Loveman's department store to buy her children Easter shoes, a white saleswoman said to her, [...] "Negro, ain't you ashamed of yourself, <b>your</b> <b>people</b> out there on the street getting put in jail and you in here spending money and I'm not going to sell you any, you'll have to go some other place." [...] King promised a protest every day until [...] "peaceful equality had been assured" [...] and expressed doubt that the new mayor would ever voluntarily desegregate the city.|$|E
500|$|The second {{televised}} debate organised by the Finnish Broadcasting Company on 14 April was {{the last}} before the election and it included all the eight parliamentary parties. The economy was a dominant theme of the debate. Jutta Urpilainen reiterated her claim that the incumbent government was furthering {{the establishment of a}} flat tax. She also accused the government for advancing the interests of the richest percentage {{at the expense of the}} poor people. Jyrki Katainen denied the claims, but the two main governing coalition parties, the NCP and the Centre Party, were the only parties opposed to increasing welfare for the unemployed. Prime Minister Mari Kiviniemi of the Centre Party had previously been quiet on spending cuts, but when pressed on the issue by the debate's moderator she was rather indiscreet on cutting funding for the public sector and the Defence Forces. However, she still insisted that cuts may not be necessary if the economic growth is sufficiently high in the following years. Cuts on defence spending were supported by most parties, but Timo Soini contested this by saying that national security can not depend on economic conjectures. The crisis concerning the breaches against the campaign funding laws during the previous electoral campaign in 2007 was also discussed. Kiviniemi admitted that mistakes had been made. Soini called the mishandling an example of corruption and was glad that it was exposed. Kiviniemi discreetly said to Soini that the press had written about events in Soini's party as well. Soini's reply to this was: [...] "The press? <b>Your</b> <b>people</b> are on trial!" ...|$|E
