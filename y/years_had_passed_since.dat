On 6 April 2010 Brown went to Buckingham Palace {{to ask the}} Queen to dissolve Parliament on 12 April {{in preparation for a}} general election. In a live press conference at Downing Street, Brown announced the election would be held on 6 May. The time between the announcement of the election and the dissolution of Parliament, known as wash-up, was to allow for the handling of any unfinished legislative business before the Parliamentary session's conclusion.|$|E

Los Alamos received its first plutonium from Hanford on February 2. While it was still by no means clear that enough plutonium could be produced for use in bombs by the war's end, Hanford was by early 1945 in operation.

Guard implicitly disparaged Shane's current group, and Shane asserted a distaste for performing again with Guard, who had spent the intervening decades living and performing in Australia, touring sporadically as a soloist, and writing about and teaching music. Despite the unpleasantness, Shane and Guard reconciled to a large degree (even to the point of planning a possible reunion tour) prior to Guard's death at age 56 from lymphoma nine years later in March 1991.|$|E

5|$|As a young man, Manuel {{had been}} {{determined}} to restore by force of arms the predominance of the Byzantine Empire in the Mediterranean countries. By the time he died in 1180, 37 <b>years</b> <b>had</b> <b>passed</b> <b>since</b> that momentous day in 1143 when, amid the wilds of Cilicia, his father had proclaimed him emperor. These years had seen Manuel involved in conflict with his neighbours on all sides. Manuel's father and grandfather before him had worked patiently to undo {{the damage done by}} the battle of Manzikert and its aftermath. Thanks to their efforts, the empire Manuel inherited was stronger and better organised than at any time for a century. While it is clear that Manuel used these assets to the full, it is not so clear how much he added to them, and there is room for doubt as to whether he used them to best effect.|$|E

25|$|Before the sod {{was turned}} in June 1938, {{fourteen}} <b>years</b> <b>had</b> <b>passed</b> <b>since</b> the original land purchase. This delay {{can be attributed}} to many factors. The war boom showed signs of recession and the Board became cautious. Initial pressure from the Education Department became less insistent. Accommodations at the present High School (Continuation School) were being met. The first chairman of the first official High School Board, George Klinck, turned the sod an June 28, 1938 for the new school. R.H.

Yet, what is achieved is, of course, fundamentally anti-naturalistic; at great distance from the appearance of the natural world.|$|E
25|$|As several <b>years</b> <b>had</b> <b>passed</b> <b>since</b> {{members had}} left, {{this led to}} {{difficulties}} as well. Walker was unable to return, as {{he had taken the}} role as the replacement touring drummer for The Smashing Pumpkins to replace drummer Jimmy Chamberlin. Lenardo initially was unable to return, as he had gotten married and had children and was living a life that was contrary to Patrick's requirements for him in the studio. However, after working through it, Patrick became more accommodating to his lifestyle, and Lenardo returned in a desire to provide for his family. Cavanaugh had been touring with Prong, but was able to return, and the band recruited new drummer Steven Gillis to replace Walker.|$|E

25|$|In September 1807, Crabbe {{published}} a new volume of poems. Included {{in this volume}} were The Library, The Newspaper, and The Village; the principal new poem was The Parish Register, to which were added Sir Eustace Grey and The Hall of Justice. The volume was dedicated to Henry Vassall-Fox, 3rd Baron Holland, nephew and sometime ward of Charles James Fox. An interval of 22 <b>years</b> <b>had</b> <b>passed</b> <b>since</b> Crabbe's last appearance as an author, and he explained {{in the preface to}} this volume the reasons for this lapse as being his higher calling as a clergyman and his slow progress in poetical ability. This volume led to Crabbe's general acceptance as an important poet. Four editions were issued during the following year and a half, the fourth appearing in March 1809. The reviews were unanimous in approval, headed by Francis Jeffrey in the Edinburgh Review.|$|E
25|$|In 23 BC, Augustus (as Octavian {{now called}} himself) again {{attempted}} {{to reform the}} constitution, {{although it is not}} known why he chose to reform the constitution at this point. Four <b>years</b> <b>had</b> <b>passed</b> <b>since</b> his last reforms, and this may have given him the opportunity to discover the weaknesses in those reforms. In addition, he almost died in 23 BC, and thus he may have thought that his time left was short. To Augustus, one major weakness in his constitution was his status as Consul. While it is true that his prestige minimized the risk of obstruction {{at the hands of a}} co-Consul, this risk still existed. It was also unusual (and unprecedented) for an individual to be elected to the Consulship nine times in a row, as Augustus had been. In addition, tradition did subject the Consulship to certain restrictions, such as the traditional etiquette shown by the two Consuls towards each other. While Augustus did consider the possibility to making himself sole Consul, he realized that this was too radical of a departure from tradition. Therefore, as a 'concession', he gave up his Consulship, and modified both his Proconsular imperium and his Tribunician powers. It is not known exactly how Augustus modified his Proconsular imperium, but it is known that he was allowed to retain this imperium in the city of Rome. Normally, any magistrate had to surrender their imperium while they were inside the city. In addition, his Proconsular imperium was formally modified to give him both a status and an authority above even a Consul.|$|E
500|$|In {{the weeks}} after Berlin, Disraeli and the cabinet {{considered}} calling a general election to capitalise on the public applause he and Salisbury had received. [...] Parliaments were then for a seven-year term, {{and it was the}} custom not to go to the country until the sixth year unless forced to by events. Only four and a half <b>years</b> <b>had</b> <b>passed</b> <b>since</b> the last general election. Additionally, they did not see any clouds on the horizon that might forecast Conservative defeat if they waited. This decision not to seek re-election has often been cited as a great mistake by Disraeli. [...] Blake, however, pointed out that results in local elections had been moving against the Conservatives, and doubted if Disraeli missed any great opportunity by waiting.|$|E

500|$|In 2002, {{as part of}} ABC's push to sell {{merchandise}} {{from its}} soap operas, the network began selling a doll in Todd's likeness on its website, but were thwarted by a backlash. Modeled after cartoon versions of the Manning family that Starr would sometimes imagine, the doll sold for $19.95. According to the description on the site, it was [...] "an all-cloth doll with brown felt hair and blue eyes. He is 20 inches standing. He wears a blue shirt and black pants". The doll's face also included Todd's scar. Even though several <b>years</b> <b>had</b> <b>passed</b> <b>since</b> the gang rape and Todd had [...] "since settled down", and had become a more sympathetic character, rape victim advocate groups thought that selling the doll glorified sexual assault; so ABC removed the doll from its online store. Pictures of the doll were pulled from the Internet and the doll was blocked from being available at eBay or any other online store.|$|E
500|$|These details {{form the}} context for Clement's {{appearance}} in Scotland and his selection as the new Bishop of Dunblane. Three <b>years</b> <b>had</b> <b>passed</b> <b>since</b> {{the death of the}} last bishop, Osbert. Since there was no electoral college for the diocese, Pope Gregory IX charged the bishops of St Andrews, Brechin and Dunkeld, to find and nominate a suitable replacement. There can only be informed speculation regarding the choice of Clement. Importantly, perhaps, King Alexander was later noted for [...] "his concern for building churches for the Friars Preacher [...] ". The status of the Dominicans {{at the cutting edge of}} religious reform, together with Clement's background, may have been the decisive factors. At any rate, Clement was consecrated as bishop at Wedale on 4 September 1233, by William de Malveisin, Bishop of St Andrews. His consecration meant that he was the first Dominican in the British Isles to obtain a bishopric. This has prompted the historian Archie Duncan to comment that [...] "the choice of the first friar-bishop ... can only be called daring".|$|E
500|$|Nomura {{sought to}} make Cloud's design [...] "distinctly {{different}} from the other characters." [...] About thirty different designs were made for Cloud's face, and his hair was altered both to give it a more realistic look and to illustrate that two <b>years</b> <b>had</b> <b>passed</b> <b>since</b> the game's conclusion. The staff attempted rendering Cloud based on the game's original illustrations, but concluded that doing so left his eyes unrealistically big, which [...] "looked gross." [...] Further revisions were made to Cloud's face after completion of the pilot film, which featured a more realistic style. In contrast to his hair, Cloud's clothes were difficult to make in the film. Deciding to give Cloud a simple costume consistent with the concept of [...] "clothes designed for action", the staff began {{with the idea of a}} black robe, eventually parring it down to a [...] "long apron" [...] shifted to one side. Cloud's weaponry was based on the joking observation that because his sword in the original game was already enormously tall, in the sequel, he should use sheer numbers. Referred to as [...] "the fusion swords" [...] during the film's development, early storyboard concepts included Cloud carrying six swords on his back, although the idea was later modified to six interlocking swords. While the idea wasn't [...] "logically thought out" [...] and the staff didn't think that they could [...] "make it work physically", it was believed to provide [...] "an interesting accent to the story." [...] Cloud's new motorcycle, , was designed by Takayuki Takeya, who was asked by the staff to design an upgraded version of Cloud's [...] "Hardy-Daytona" [...] motorcycle from Final Fantasy VII. As development continued, the bike got bigger, with Takeya feeling its heaviness provided an impact that worked well within the film.|$|E
