When {{thirteen}} unidentified <b>young</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> found dead in a container at the docks, McNulty successfully makes a spiteful effort to place the murders within the jurisdiction of his former commander. Meanwhile, police Major Stan Valchek gets into a feud with Polish-American Frank Sobotka, {{a leader of the}} International Brotherhood of Stevedores, a fictional dockers' union, over competing donations to their old neighborhood church. Valchek demands a detail to investigate Sobotka. Cedric Daniels is interviewed, having been praised by Prez, Major Valchek's son-in-law, and also because of his work on the Barksdale case. He is eventually selected to lead the detail assigned just to investigate Sobotka; when the investigation is concluded Daniels is assured he will move up to head a special case unit with personnel of his choosing.|$|E

For example, <b>young</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> {{encouraged}} to throw their handkerchiefs to the crowd, and the young man who catches and returns the handkerchief has a chance at romance. In Daguang, in northeast Guizhou Province, young {{men and women of the}} Dong people would make an appointment at a certain place. The young women would arrive early to overhear remarks made about them by the young men. The young men would praise their lovers in front of their fellows, in which finally the listening women would walk out of the thicket. Pairs of lovers would go off to a quiet place to open their hearts to each other.|$|E
25|$|Globally, {{anorexia}} {{is estimated}} to affect 2.9 million people as of 2015. It {{is estimated to}} occur in 0.9% to 4.3% of women and 0.2% to 0.3% of men in Western countries {{at some point in}} their life. About 0.4% of <b>young</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> affected in a given year and it is estimated to occur ten times less commonly in men. Rates in most of the developing world are unclear. Often it begins during the teen years or young adulthood. While anorexia became more commonly diagnosed during the 20th century it is unclear if this was due to an increase in its frequency or simply better diagnosis. In 2013 it directly resulted in about 600 deaths globally, up from 400 deaths in 1990. Eating disorders also increase a person's risk of death from a wide range of other causes, including suicide. About 5% of people with anorexia die from complications over a ten-year period, a nearly 6 times increased risk. The term anorexia nervosa was first used in 1873 by William Gull to describe this condition.|$|E
25|$|As {{decreases}} in job security and wages for males have negatively impacted {{the ability of}} the sole male-breadwinner family model, there is now increasing pressure for women to work outside the home in a dual-earner family model. The percentage of young women who believed that a man should work outside a home and that women should work inside dropped from 41.6% in 1997 to 27.8% in 2008, while for men the rate went from 40.7% to 34.3% respectively. Similarly, the proportion of young women who expected to work until retirement rose from 15.3% in 1987 to 24.7% in 2010, while the proportion of men who expected their wives to do so rose from 10.5% to 32.7% in the same time period. The increasing acceptance of young Japanese adults of the dual-earner model has resulted in an increase of dual-earner young households from 32.4% in 2000 to 42.8% in 2009. Women are also delaying or avoiding marriage altogether. The mean age of first marriage rose from 24.2 in 1970 to 28.8 in 2010, while the proportion of women aged 25–29 who have not married increased from 18.1% in 1970 to 60.3% in 2010. The education levels of <b>young</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> also drastically increasing, at a rate higher than their male counterparts. 45.2% of women in 2010 progressed to university from high school, a dramatic increase from 15.2% in 1990. These changes in Japanese society have narrowed the wage gap between men and women, as wages of female 25–29 years old have reached 88% of their male counterparts in 2007, as opposed to 76% in 1981. However, a large part of this reduction in the wage gap is due to the stagnation of male wages, which was at the same levels in 2007 as in 1991.|$|E

2500|$|In most congregations, the <b>young</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> sub-divided {{into three}} aged-based classes which were given {{official}} nicknames {{by the church}} in the 1950s.

When a young woman reaches the age of 18, she is normally encouraged to join the Relief Society, the women's organization of the LDS Church.

2500|$|Debate {{increased}} when Randolph-Macon Woman's College {{announced that it}} would adopt coeducation and change its name. Former Interim president Ginger H.

In response, a number of presidents of women's colleges challenged Worden's article, arguing that other women's colleges are still doing well and attracting students. This includes: Agnes Scott College, Converse College (Spartanburg, SC), Columbia College, The Seven Sisters, a separate article from Mount Holyoke College, Simmons College, and Hollins University. Sweet Briar College announced March 3, 2015, that it was closing Aug. 25 due to [...] "insurmountable financial challenges."

2500|$|In {{examining}} the female role designations of Plautus's plays, Z.M. Packman {{found that they}} are not as stable as their male counterparts: a senex will usually remain a senex {{for the duration of the}} play but designations like matrona, mulier, or uxor at times seem interchangeable. Most free adult women, married or widowed, appear in scene headings as mulier, simply translated as [...] "woman". But in Plautus' Stichus the two <b>young</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> referred to as sorores, later mulieres, and then matronae, all of which have different meanings and connotations. Although there are these discrepancies, Packman tries to give a pattern to the female role designations of Plautus. Mulier is typically given to a woman of citizen class and of marriageable age or who has already been married. [...] Unmarried citizen-class girls, regardless of sexual experience, were designated virgo. Ancilla was the term used for female household slaves, with Anus reserved for the elderly household slaves. A young woman who is unwed due to social status is usually referred to as meretrix or [...] "courtesan". A lena, or adoptive mother, may be a woman who owns these girls.|$|E
