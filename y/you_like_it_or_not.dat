25|$|In 1968, Callas told Lord Harewood, De Hildalgo had {{the real}} great {{training}}, {{maybe even the}} last real training of the real bel canto. As a young girl—thirteen years old—I was immediately thrown into her arms, meaning that I learned the secrets, the ways of this bel canto, which of course as you well know, is not just beautiful singing. It is a very hard training; it {{is a sort of}} a strait-jacket that you're supposed to put on, whether <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>or</b> <b>not.</b> You have to learn to read, to write, to form your sentences, how far you can go, fall, hurt yourself, put yourself back on your feet continuously. De Hidalgo had one method, which was the real bel canto way, where no matter how heavy a voice, it should always be kept light, it should always be worked on in a flexible way, never to weigh it down. It is a method of keeping the voice light and flexible and pushing the instrument into a certain zone where it might not be too large in sound, but penetrating. And teaching the scales, trills, all the bel canto embellishments, which is a whole vast language of its own.|$|E

He later claimed {{that he had not}} been talking about nuclear war, but rather about the historically determined victory of communism over capitalism. In 1961, Khrushchev declared that even if the USSR was behind the West, within a decade its housing shortage would disappear, consumer goods would be abundant, and within two decades, the [...] "construction of a communist society" [...] in the USSR would be completed [...] "in the main".|$|E

2500|$|The bias {{worked to}} Bjelke-Petersen's benefit {{in his first}} {{election}} as premier, in 1969. [...] His Country Party won only 21 percent of the primary vote, finishing third behind Labor and the Liberals. [...] However, due to the Country Party's heavy concentration of support in the provincial and rural zones, it won 26 seats, seven more than the Liberals. [...] Combined, the Coalition had 45 seats out of 78, enough to consign Labor to opposition even though it finished percentage points ahead of the Coalition on the two-party vote. While in opposition, Bjelke-Petersen had vehemently criticised the 1949 redistribution, claiming that Labor was effectively telling Queenslanders, [...] "Whether <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>or</b> <b>not,</b> we will be the government." ...|$|E

With God's Son, Nas {{has the opportunity to}} cement his status as the King of NY, at least for another 3-4-year term, or he could prove that he is not the savior that hip-hop fans should be pinning their hopes on." [...] After the album's release, he began helping the Bravehearts, made up of his younger brother Jungle and friend Wiz (Wizard), put together their debut album, Bravehearted. The album features guest appearances from Nas, Nashawn (Millennium Thug), Lil Jon, and Jully Black.|$|E

2500|$|Swervedriver {{appeared}} to rebound when they signed a three-album deal with DGC Records (a subsidiary of Geffen Records) in early 1996. Originally, the first album {{in the deal}} was to be an American release of Ejector Seat Reservation; the band had attempted to talk A into relinquishing them the rights, but after news of their talks with Geffen was publicized on the Internet, A had come back with an exorbitant price for its sale (to avoid the same missed opportunity after previously dropped Soul Asylum hit it big with 1992's Grave Dancers Union). With their advance, they finished building their own recording studio, Bad Earth in Farringdon, and instead began work on a new record for the label. Over the next year, the group would record 99th Dream with Moulder at the helm, this time taking a more simple, laid-back approach than with previous productions. They scaled back from 48-track to 24-track recording, condensing the layering of guitar in the process, and employed more full-ensemble straight live track, partly with the mindset of {{making it easier to}} play the guitar lines live. During that time, the band also put out a pair of self-produced boutique label seven-inch singles, including the double split [...] "Why Say Yeah" [...] with indie collaboration act Sophia. DGC distributed promotional copies of the album and scheduled a release date of 7 May 1997. Meanwhile, in December 1996 Swervedriver went back into the studio and re-recorded the album track [...] "These Times," [...] citing their growing dislike for the original's faster-paced, Oasis-like sound and a bad experience with one of the label's reps during mixing. Three and a half weeks before 99th Dream was due to be released, DGC dismissed the band's A representative, Jody Kurilla, in a corporate downsizing and three hours later terminated their contract (though they would not impede the record's future release). Considering the recent break with their third label in two years, Hindmarsh stated, [...] "Someone from A once told us that it takes four or five listens to a Swervedriver album to see whether <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>or</b> <b>not,</b> and in this marketplace, unless you can hit immediately it's not going to register with people." ...|$|E
