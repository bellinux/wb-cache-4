Budi Subanar, a lecturer on theology at Sanata Dharma University, during this period one of the teachers taught the Fourth Commandment, [...] "Honour your father and your mother, that <b>your</b> <b>days</b> may be long in the land which the Lord your God gives you.", as relating not only to one's birth father and mother, but all who had come before; this left {{the students}} with nationalistic tendencies. On another occasion, a visit by a Capuchin missionary– who was physically {{quite different from the}} Jesuit teachers– led Soegija to consider becoming a priest, an idea which his parents accepted. In 1915 Soegija finished his education at Xaverius, but stayed on as a teacher. The following year he joined the on-site seminary, one of three native Indonesians who entered the seminary that year. He graduated in 1919, having studied French, Latin, Greek, and literature.|$|E

2500|$|The Gemara {{reported}} {{a dispute over}} the meaning of [...] Rava taught that King Manasseh of Judah tried and executed Isaiah, charging Isaiah with false prophesy based, among other things, on a contradiction between [...] and Isaiah's teachings. Manasseh argued that when (as reported in [...] ) Moses quoted God saying, [...] "The number of <b>your</b> <b>days</b> I will fulfill," [...] God meant that God would allow people to live out their appointed lifespan, but not add to it. But Manasseh noted that Isaiah told Manasseh's father Hezekiah (as reported in [...] ) that God promised Hezekiah, [...] "I will add on to <b>your</b> <b>days</b> fifteen years." [...] According to Rava, Isaiah did not dispute Manasseh's charges, knowing that Manasseh would not accept Isaiah's argument, no matter how truthful, and Manasseh had Isaiah killed. The Gemara reported that the Tannaim disagreed about the interpretation of the words [...] "the number of <b>your</b> <b>days</b> I will fulfill" [...] in [...] A Baraita taught that [...] "the number of <b>your</b> <b>days</b> I will fulfill" [...] refers to the lifespan that God allots to every human being at birth. Rabbi Akiba taught that if one is worthy, God allows one to complete the full period; if unworthy, God reduces the number of years. The Sages, however, taught that if one is worthy, God adds years to one's life; if one is unworthy, God reduces the years. The Sages argued to Rabbi Akiba that Isaiah's prophesy to Hezekiah in [...] "And I will add to <b>your</b> <b>days</b> fifteen years," [...] supports the Sages' interpretation. Rabbi Akiba replied that God made the addition to Hezekiah's lifespan from years that God had originally intended for Hezekiah that Hezekiah had previously lost due to sin. Rabbi Akiba cited in support of his position the words of the prophet in the days of Jeroboam, before the birth of Hezekiah, who prophesied (as reported in [...] ), [...] "a son shall be born to the house of David, Josiah by name." [...] Rabbi Akiba argued that since the prophet prophesied the birth of Manasseh's son Josiah before the birth of Manasseh's father Hezekiah, it must be that at Hezekiah's birth God had allotted to Hezekiah enough years to extend beyond the time of Hezekiah's illness (when Isaiah prophesied in [...] ) so as to include the year of Manasseh's birth. Consequently, Rabbi Akiba argued, at the time of Hezekiah's illness, God must have reduced the original number of years allotted to Hezekiah, and upon Hezekiah's recovery, God must have added back only that which God had previously reduced. The Rabbis, however, argued back that the prophet in the days of Jeroboam who prophesied in [...] did not prophesy that Josiah would necessarily descend from Hezekiah. The prophet prophesied in [...] that Josiah would be born [...] "to the house of David." [...] Thus Josiah might have descended either from Hezekiah or from some other person in the Davidic line.|$|E

Rabbi Jose the Galilean argued that learning is more important, for the religious duty to learn the Torah came before the religious duty to separate dough–offering by 40 years, the obligation to separate tithes by 44 years, the obligation of the years of release by 61 years, and the obligation of the Jubilee Year by 103 years.

2500|$|Reading [...] "And on {{the seventh}} day God {{finished}} his work," [...] the Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer taught that God created seven dedications (for the creation {{of each of the}} seven days). God expressed six of them, and reserved one for future generations. Thus, when God created the first day and finished all God's work on it, God dedicated it, as [...] says, [...] "And it was evening, and it was morning, one day." [...] When God created the second day and finished all God's work in it, God dedicated it, as [...] says, [...] "And it was evening, and it was morning, a second day." [...] Similar language appears through the six days of creation. God created the seventh day, but not for work, because Genesis does not say in connecti{{on the seventh}} day, [...] "And it was evening and it was morning." [...] That is because God reserved the dedication of the seventh day for the generations to come, as [...] says, speaking of the Sabbath, [...] "And there shall be one day which is known to the Lord; not day, and not night." [...] The Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer compared this to a man who had precious utensils {{that he did not want}} to leave as an inheritance to anyone but to his son. The Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer taught that it is likewise with God. God did not want to give the day of blessing and holiness that was before God as an inheritance to anyone but Israel. For when the Israelites left Egypt, before God gave them the Torah, God gave them the Sabbath as an inheritance (as reported in [...] ). Before God gave Israel the Torah, they kept two Sabbaths, as [...] says first, [...] "And You made known to them Your holy Sabbath." [...] And only afterwards did God give them the Torah, as [...] says as it continues, [...] "And commanded them commandments, and statutes, and Torah by the hand of Moses, Your servant." [...] God observed and sanctified the Sabbath, and Israel is obliged only to observe and sanctify the Sabbath. For when God gave the Israelites manna, all through the 40 years in the wilderness, God gave it during on the six days during which God had created the world, Sunday through Friday, but on the Sabbath, God did not give them manna. Of course, God had power enough to give them manna every day. But the Sabbath was before God, so God gave the Israelites bread for two days on Friday, as [...] says, [...] "See, for the Lord has given you the Sabbath, therefore he gives you on the sixth day the bread of two days." [...] When the people saw that God observed the Sabbath, they also rested, as [...] says, [...] "So the people rested on the seventh day." [...] Reading [...] "And God blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it," [...] the Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer taught that God blessed and hallowed the Sabbath day, and Israel is bound only to keep and to hallow the Sabbath day. Hence the Sages said that those who says the benediction and sanctification over the wine on Friday evenings will have their days increased in this world, and in the world to come. For [...] says, [...] "For by me <b>your</b> <b>days</b> shall be multiplied," [...] signifying in this world.
