50|$|It may be {{observed}} here that like Premendra Mitra's Ghanada, Tarini khuro {{likes to tell}} tall tales, although unlike Ghanada, {{there is no way}} of ascertaining the veracity of these stories. Also unlike the caste-less Ghanada, Tarini is an upper caste twice born Brahmin. He has had an adventurous life and has (like his creator Ray) largely steered clear from the tremendous political (and social) upheavals that were so much visible in twentieth century India. Although Tarini is apparently born in a Bengali middle class family and is well-to-do in terms of inheritance and social networks, he seeks out occupations all over India (in other words, he does not limit himself to Bengal) for the sheer joy of doing so. And although it is clear that he does not enjoy the benefits <b>of</b> a <b>pensionable</b> <b>service</b> or an annuity or insurance policy, he has to tell tales to get his afternoon tea and snacks. It is also interesting to note that his audience consists of five school children in a middle class dual income Bengali family, who do not have time to spend with their children during the afternoons or evening.|$|R
