500|$|The song {{begins with}} a {{keyboard}} before turning into an '80s-inspired dance-pop number. Reminiscent of Solveig's hit single [...] "Hello", the song has a [...] "pulsating" [...] French house composition, and a [...] "catchy" [...] hook and chorus, inline with Madonna's 2006 single, [...] "Get Together". According to Brad O'Mancey from Popjustice, following the introduction on the keyboard, the music continues to grow as Madonna sings the line, [...] "you feel the wind on <b>your</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> your skin and it's here that I begin my story", and crashes following it. John Mitchell from MTV News described {{that there was a}} [...] "propulsive" [...] energy in the track that felt [...] "authentic and alive". He went on to add that [...] "the calculated perfectionism" [...] of other club tracks by Madonna might appear to be chilly, but the composition of [...] "Turn Up the Radio" [...] instead was [...] "effervescent" [...] and [...] "happy". According to the sheet music of the song published by Guitar Tabs, [...] "Turn Up the Radio" [...] is set in the time signature of common time, with a moderate tempo of 127 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of D major with Madonna's vocals ranging from C to A. The song follows a sequence of D–B–Amin–G in the verses and D–G–B–Emin during the chorus.|$|E

Eckhart said that he felt challenged playing the role: [...] "You have to say these words that are crazy, and yet {{do it with a}} smile on <b>your</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> have the audience like you. At one point, I'm doing a talk show with a kid who's dying of cancer, and he's going through chemotherapy and the whole thing, and I spin it so the anti-smoking people are the bad guys and I'm the good guy, and I'm this guy's best friend. I mean, it's whacked out." [...] The film was screened at a special presentation at the 30th annual Toronto International Film Festival in 2005. It had a limited release in March 2006 and was released worldwide the following month. For his performance, Eckhart received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. A contributor of USA Today wrote that he gave a [...] "standout, whip-smart performance" [...] citing that as Nick Naylor he kept him [...] "likable even in his cynicism." [...] In the Seattle Post-Intelligencer review of the film, it was reported that [...] "Under his chummy but compassionless smile" [...] Eckhart radiated charm and [...] "Naylor's true joys: manipulating arguments, steering debate, cooking words." ...|$|E

Fortunately, I was an acrobat growing up, and a very very good one — I won a lot of contests — so I knew how to control my body and be 'quiet.' You had to do that, you had to be very still and lay there and be a 'good patient.' A young actor will do anything to get their mug on the screen! I remember that the makeup process took about three hours. I had to lay back and be perfectly still as they put this plaster mold on my face. After seeing the test, everyone was very enthusiastic about going ahead with making Planet of the Apes. But they felt the makeup needed a little more work and perfecting before it would look good on screen." ...|$|E

2500|$|Scherzinger's {{songs are}} written from {{personal}} experiences, {{as she said}} they are [...] "personal and heartfelt" [...] tracks. She co-wrote the majority of her first studio album, Killer Love. Scherzinger's earlier songs {{have been described as}} [...] "sexual innuendo" [...] and [...] "funky electronica" [...] which are also backed by [...] "electro beats". In August 2010, RedOne revealed that he was working on Scherzinger's debut album, stating: [...] "I just finished her album. Her last one never came out because it wasn't consistent. Her new record – it's the real her." [...] Scherzinger said a lot of her first studio album was about her split with Lewis Hamilton before they reunited. Scherzinger said that she wanted to create songs which [...] "lend themselves to live performances". She said she likes to record [...] "empowering" [...] ballads. Scherzinger's vocals on ballads have been compared to Kelly Clarkson. She said that she wanted her debut album to be [...] "in <b>your</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> strong". She told MTV [...] "I've always said that in the Pussycat Dolls, I kind of feel like Superwoman. But that's just one of my alter egos. I've got the vulnerable, lovesick side of me amongst others which all appear on my record." ...|$|E
2500|$|Upon its release, Killer Love {{received}} a mixed to positive response from critics. Some praised Scherzinger's strong vocals and conviction to convey emotion, while others criticized {{her choice of}} allowing RedOne to produce {{the majority of the}} album, stating that some of the songs sounded too similar to each other. The Observers Michael Cragg noted the album as being consistent with most other modern R albums, stating [...] "Killer Love is two thirds deliriously catchy pop stompers and one third balladry." [...] Cragg also noted that Scherzinger's [...] "not so inconsiderable voice" [...] takes a backseat allowing the record producers to inject their own influences into her music. Alex Macpherson from BBC Online commented that [...] "Scherzinger {{is one of the few}} pop performers with the requisite power to dominate [...] beats rather than vice versa. Killer Love is far from the album you sense Scherzinger could still deliver: at times, her personality is all that – barely – carries substandard, unmemorable songs." [...] Kim Dawson from The Daily Star was positive, saying that [...] "Nicole's solo record truly is killer and no filler." [...] Another positive reaction came from [...] "Entertainment Focus" [...] who went to say that: [...] "Killer Love is a competent and enjoyable record from one of the nicest women in pop. Fingers crossed this time it works out for her." [...] The 4Music review was also positive, noting that [...] "Killer Love will definitely establish her as a viable act in her own right." [...] Robert Copsey wrote favorably for Digital Spy that [...] "Killer Love is a sturdy debut from the part-time X Factor judge that, in part, lives up to her promise of being [...] "in <b>your</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> strong".|$|E

2500|$|The Game {{began as}} a spec screenplay, written by John Brancato and Michael Ferris in 1991. It was sold that year to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), who put the project in turnaround, where it {{was picked up by}} Propaganda Films. Director Jonathan Mostow was {{originally}} attached to the project with Kyle MacLachlan and Bridget Fonda cast in the lead roles. Principal photography was to start in February 1993 but in early 1992, the project was moved to PolyGram Filmed Entertainment. Mostow was no longer the director of the film but instead became an executive producer. Producer Steve Golin bought the script from MGM and gave it to David Fincher in the hopes that he would direct. Fincher liked the various plot twists but brought in Andrew Kevin Walker, who had worked with him on Seven, to make the character of Nicholas more cynical in nature. Fincher and Walker spent six weeks changing the tone and trying to make the story work. According to David Fincher, there were three primary influences on The Game. Michael Douglas' character was a [...] "fashionable, good-looking Scrooge, lured into a [...] situation with a steroid shot in the thigh from The Sting". He {{said in an interview that}} his film differs from others of that kind because [...] "movies usually make a pact with the audience that says: we're going to play it straight. What we show you is going to add up. But we don't do that. In that respect, it's about movies and how movies dole out information". Furthermore, Fincher has said that the film is about [...] "loss of control. The purpose of The Game is to take your greatest fear, put it this close to <b>your</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> say 'There, you're still alive. It's all right.'" [...] More revisions were made to the script, including removing a scene where Nicholas kills Christine and then commits suicide, because Fincher felt that this did not make sense. In 1996, Larry Gross and Walker were brought in to make further revisions to the script.|$|E
2500|$|After {{seeing the}} film, The New York Times noted the requiem tone {{captured}} by the film, describing it as [...] "a sleek, muscle car of a movie made in the USA, in that industrial graveyard called Detroit". Manohla Dargis compared Eastwood's presence on film to Dirty Harry and the Man with No Name, stating: [...] "Dirty Harry is back, in a way, in Gran Torino, not as a character, but as a ghostly presence. He hovers in the film, in its themes and high-caliber imagery, and of course, most obviously, in Mr. Eastwood’s face. It is a monumental face now, so puckered and pleated {{that it no longer}} looks merely weathered, as it has for decades, but seems closer to petrified wood." [...] The Los Angeles Times also praised Eastwood's performance and credibility as an action hero at the age of 78. Kenneth Turan said of Eastwood's performance, [...] "It is a film that is impossible to imagine without the actor in the title role. The notion of a 78-year-old action hero may sound like a contradiction in terms, but Eastwood brings it off, even if his toughness is as much verbal as physical. Even at 78, Eastwood can make [...] "Get off my lawn" [...] sound as menacing as [...] "Make my day", and when he says [...] "I blow a hole in <b>your</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> sleep like a baby", he sounds as if he means it". Roger Ebert wrote that the film is [...] "about the belated flowering of a man's better nature. And it's about Americans of different races growing more open to one another in the new century." [...] Sang Chi and Emily Moberg Robinson, editors of Voices of the Asian-American and Pacific Islander Experience: Volume 1, said that within the mainstream media, the film received [...] "criticial acclaim" [...] "for its nuanced portrayal of Asian Americans." [...] Louisa Schein and Va-Megn Thoj, authors of [...] "Gran Torino’s Boys and Men with Guns: Hmong Perspective," [...] said that the mainstream critical response was [...] "centered on Eastwood‘s character and viewed the film mainly as a vision of multicultural inclusion and understanding." ...|$|E
