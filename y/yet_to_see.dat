The color sequences include a brief overlap to help clue the audience into {{the fact that they are}} being presented in reverse order. The purpose of the fragmented reverse sequencing is to force the audience into a sympathetic experience of Leonard's defective ability to create new long-term memories, where prior events are not recalled, since the audience has <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> them.|$|E

Clark added that he would've {{reported}} Williams or any coach that offered to run such a program.

25|$|An earlier cut of {{the film}} seems to have {{included}} a large subplot regarding aliens in the extraterrestrial sense, whose presence was made gradually more and more known throughout, and who were planning to siphon off the planet's resources gradually, placing the humans in the same light as the penguins.

25|$|In August 1947, Barrington {{was asked}} to join the groundstaff of the prestigious Surrey County Cricket Club at the Kennington Oval in South London for the {{following}} season. From April 1948, he commuted to London by railway for his training, having <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a first-class cricket match. The Chief Coach was Andy Sandham who thought his leg-spin bowling lacked accuracy (Surrey had Jim Laker and Tony Lock so did not need another spinner) and made him concentrate on his batting. Alec Bedser predicted that Barrington was a future Test player and Sandham later stated that Barrington was his best pupil. He worked on preparing the vast Oval ground for first-class cricket and played for the Surrey Club and Ground cricket team, though still down the order. In the 1949 season he only had time to play one game, making 52 against Kew before he was called up for National Service.|$|E
25|$|The Top 3, Sophie, Bill and Fenton {{had just}} two final {{challenges}} to complete. The {{first was the}} last chance {{to work on their}} presenting skills with Mark and Julia. Mark held a Cue card which they were required to read while looking down the camera and deliver it with as much personality as possible. Mark was looking for someone with the ability to engage the audience. Bill and Sophie struggled with their delivery while big Fenton nailed it in one take, getting a round of applause from both judges. Then it was off to one of Sydney's best fine dining experiences, Mint bar and dining. Once there they had one last attempt to impress 5 VIP's with a signature dish under the keen eye of Ben O'Donoghue. This showed another side of Ben that the contestants had <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>see,</b> a no nonsense head chef barking orders at them in the kitchen and putting the pressure on to get the meals out as efficiently as possible. Sophie served up a very fresh and light Mexican chicken with a tasty salad including heart of palm and pistachio. The food critiques were very impressed. Next up Bill aimed to impress with his dish, crayfish cooked in herb butter and served with a salad. The reaction was the same all round from the judges, not good. The presentation was lacking and the salad didn't suit the dish. Owner of Mint remarked 'It's like two different dishes on one plate.' Finally Fenton from Queensland served up an eye fillet with hollandaise and potato rösti (a favourite at his restaurant.) While one judge thought the beef was the best stating 'he (Fenton) put his whole life on the BBQ and served it up for us.' it was Sophie's chicken that got the majority of the VIP judges vote and won her ticket through to the grand finale. That left Fenton and Bill. Ben then announced that Bill would be going home and Fenton was going through. But then in a final twist, Chef Ben O'Donoghue decided to bring Bill back because he felt that he had let him down with his direction in the kitchen. So the Top 2 was again the Top 3 with all contestants going into the final with the winner announced on Australia Day.|$|E
