500|$|Dig Me Out {{was written}} in nearly two months and {{recorded}} from December 1996 to January 1997 at John and Stu's Place in Seattle, Washington. During the recording sessions, recording the vocal interplay between Tucker and co-vocalist and guitarist Carrie Brownstein involved some difficulties. However, the producer took care and prevented favoring one voice over the other. As Goodmanson recalls: [...] "We always used different mikes for the lead vocal and for the second vocal, or different kinds of processing to make those things really distinct. To make it so <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> both things at once". Goodmanson {{also noted that the}} fact that the band features no bass player was an advantage for the album's production. He explained: [...] "The awesome thing about having no bass player is you can make the guitars sound as big as you want. Usually you have to clear all that room out for the bass, so <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> the bass line. With no bass there, you can just go for giant guitar sounds that you wouldn't normally be able to go for".|$|E

500|$|For {{the first}} time in her career, Gomez was given full {{creative}} control following her signing with Interscope Records. She expressed frustration and constraint with the songs chosen for her earlier in her career, and felt a disconnect from the music both personally and professionally. During the creation of Revival, the singer emphasized the importance of creating a distinct sound for herself, telling Nolan Feeney of Time that [...] "there were times in my career where I sang things that just weren’t me and weren’t for me. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> it in my voice. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> it when it’s inauthentic." [...] Gomez aimed to create autobiographical songs which shared personal stories, whether or not she wrote them. Citing the therapeutic process of writing [...] "The Heart Wants What It Wants" [...] for her greatest hits album For You (2014), the singer was inspired to separate herself from her peers and convert personal experiences into the music of Revival. For [...] "Sober", Gomez focused on using her unique vocal tone and abilities as an actress to translate feelings and emotions through her music. The singer also told producers to focus primarily on the lyrics and vocals, referencing albums of her youth that dealt with themes of growing up in the spotlight, particularly Christina Aguilera's album Stripped (2002).|$|E
500|$|By contrast, The A.V. Club Evan Rytlewski {{wrote that}} the song opens Looking 4 Myself on a [...] "discouragingly {{perfunctory}} note", though complimented Usher for not using auto-tune to alter his vocals. Idolator's Robbie Daw was ambivalent towards the track, writing that [...] "Scream" [...] contains [...] "a dance-pop formula <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> when flipping to any pop station on the radio". Neon Limelight disproved the track as a whole for being generic, saying that the song is a disappointment compared to its previous single [...] "Climax". Melinda Newman of HitFix showed a similar opinion, also noting the track as generic.|$|E
500|$|Jones's role as Hitchcock {{required}} him to spend four hours each day being made up with prosthetic makeup and a fatsuit, and he did daily twenty-minute vocal exercises to imitate Hitchcock's distinctive speech.

There's something in the rhythm and roll of it that {{is connected to the}} way Hitchcock thinks and moves. Then there is everything he ingestedthe cigar smoking and drinking that's imprinted on his voice. And everywhere he lived; <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> cockney London, California, and a plummy received pronunciation in that voice".|$|E

[...] After Moon and Napier-Bell left, Beck and Page added overdubs and sound treatments to complete the track. [...] According to Beck, two or three songs were recorded at the session, but [...] "Beck's Bolero" [...] was the only track released.|$|E
500|$|King {{would have}} {{appointed}} [...] "Jihad" [...] as the group's nomination in the [...] "Best Metal Performance" [...] award category at the 49th Grammy Awards, deeming the chosen track [...] "Eyes of the Insane" [...] "the poorest representations" [...] {{of the group}} on ninth studio album Christ Illusion. Despite King's statement, [...] "Eyes of the Insane" [...] won Slayer their first Grammy award. The Slayer guitarist has also stated; [...] "I like playing 'Jihad' because I'm back changing my guitars, and Jeff starts it and he starts it quietly so <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> the fans go crazy about it and you can't always hear that {{at the beginning of}} a song." ...|$|E

Knowles has said that she loves singing ballads because, [...] "the music and the emotion in the story is told [...] so much better. It's a better connection because <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> it and it's not all these other distractions. I really wanted people to hear my voice and hear what I had to say."

500|$|Earthsuit {{music was}} {{primarily}} rock, but also possessed strong hip-hop, electronica, reggae, soul, and experimental elements. Their sound had sometimes {{been compared to}} The Police, while Meany's rapping had been likened to the Beastie Boys. Adam LaClave stated the differing musical tastes of the band helped cultivate their sound: [...] "Each {{one of us is}} really into {{a lot of different things}} ... it helps make our sound because <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> all kinds of things". Live performances were characterized by [...] sunglasses, futuristic costumes, and energetic showmanship. Many bands have influenced Earthsuit's style; the group has performed covers of songs by Basement Jaxx, Black Sheep, Kraftwerk, and The Talking Heads. They have also utilized samples by DJ Shadow and The Verve.|$|E

However, Chase McMullen of Beats Per Minute observes from the mixtape's sound the [...] "threatening vibe" [...] of Raekwon's 1995 album Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... and a grime influence, commenting that [...] "while southern influences currently dominate much of current hip hop, Rocky places as much importance on the Wu as he does Three 6." [...] Paul Lester of The Guardian compares [...] "Peso" [...] to the stylings of The Jet Age of Tomorrow. [...] "Trilla" [...] has a funk and boom bap influence in its production.|$|E
