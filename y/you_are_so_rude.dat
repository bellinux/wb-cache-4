6000|$|MRS. CLANDON (horrified). Oh, Dolly, Dolly! My dearest, how can <b>you</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>rude?</b> (To Valentine.) Will you excuse these barbarian {{children}} of mine, Mr. Valentine? ...|$|R
6000|$|Meg's mild eyes kindled {{with anger}} {{as she pulled}} a {{crumpled}} note from her pocket and threw it at Jo, saying reproachfully, [...] "You wrote it, and that bad boy helped you. How could <b>you</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>rude,</b> <b>so</b> mean, and cruel to us both?" ...|$|R
5000|$|I, Feng Changqing, {{came from}} a humble station, and surely you know that I had to {{repeatedly}} ask {{to serve as a}} guard of the Zhongcheng even though he repeatedly rejected me.

6000|$|... 'You {{told me to}} {{drop into}} the turbid Amazon and be drowned,' said Slow-Solid. 'Why <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>so</b> <b>rude</b> and forgetful to-day?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't you know, Tom," [...] {{said the}} nurse to him once, [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> noisy and <b>rude,</b> you'll disturb your dear mamma? She's sick, {{and she may}} die, if you're not careful." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{wish you}} could stay, and then we could talk over my picture. If only one single picture's a success, it draws {{attention}} to all the others. I know some of my work is good, if only people could see. And <b>you</b> needn't have <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>rude</b> about it.' ...|$|R

6000|$|Though {{they were}} devouring the dark road, though {{roadside}} rocks, {{caught by the}} headlights, seemed to fly up at them, though they went on forever, chased by a nightmare, Claire snuggled down in security. Her head drooped against his shoulder. He put his arm about her, his hand about her waist. She sleepily wondered if she ought to let him. She heard herself muttering, [...] "Sorry I <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>rude</b> when <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> rude," [...] and her chilly cheek discovered that the smooth-worn shoulder of his old blue coat was warm, and she wondered some more about the questions of waists and hands and---- She was asleep.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, very well. Difficult to {{reconcile}} what Geoffrey told us, with Miss Silvester's manner and appearance. What next? You {{had something else}} to say, when I <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>rude</b> as to interrupt <b>you.</b> What <b>was</b> it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So do you, but I shouldn't <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>rude</b> {{as to say}} so. He shan't come to the dinner-ball, shall he, Daisy?" [...] cried Nan, indignantly.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are an angel, and I 'll never <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>rude</b> again," [...] she added, as Polly's arm came round her, {{and half}} the seat was gladly offered.|$|R

6000|$|... 'I {{wonder how}} Mr. Smith can <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>rude</b> as {{to sit there}} in my {{presence}} over his stupid perch! Smoking those horrid cigars, too! [...] How selfish those field-sports do make men!' ...|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} usually covered with Polyzoa, Lithothamnion, and other {{adherent}} matter, which obscures its appearance, but the shell itself <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>rude,</b> spongy, and bleached in appearance {{that the actual}} surface is often discriminated only when examined with a lens.|$|R

6000|$|... "I did teach {{here for}} a year, but I couldn't endure the noise; I'm not very strong, and the boys <b>were</b> <b>so</b> <b>rude.</b> If I could teach in a seminary--teach Latin and English--I should be happy, I think. But I can't leave mother now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O dear!" [...] thought Kitty, [...] "I didn't {{suppose they}} <b>were</b> <b>so</b> <b>rude.</b> I'm afraid I must say good night," [...] she added aloud, after a little, and stole away the most conscience-stricken {{creature}} on that boat.

And the Don actually was appeased, and went there the very next evening, sneering at himself the whole time for going.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{assure you}} that I did not, sir, or I should not have <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>rude</b> as to pass without saluting you."

60|$|Q. But I am {{like to be}} slighted, and despised {{by other}} little {{children}}, if I begin already to serve God, am I not?--A. If children <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>rude</b> as to mock the prophets and ministers of God, no marvel if they also mock thee; {{but it is a}} poor heaven that is not worth enduring worse things than to be mocked for the seeking and obtaining of (2 Kings 2:23,24).|$|R
50|$|Valerie is a grouchy {{waitress}} who Khyber works with. Khyber spends Saturday mornings {{working at}} the Trojan Horse Restaurant for one hour in exchange for breakfast.

6000|$|To this Albinia pettishly {{replied that}} the girls were to go to no Christmas parties without her; Miss Meadows had taken it very much to heart, and Lucy was declaiming against mamma making any condescension to Mrs. Osborn, or herself being {{supposed}} to care for 'the Osborn's parties,' where the boys <b>were</b> <b>so</b> <b>rude</b> and vulgar, the girls so boisterous, and the dancing a mere romp. Sophy might like it, but she never did! ...|$|R
6000|$|The scene <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>rude</b> and at {{the same}} time so picturesque that it {{impressed}} them all very agreeably. Perhaps they were the more delighted because they had expected nothing admirable in this all but forsaken spot.

60|$|And then I told Joe that I {{felt very}} miserable, and that I hadn't {{been able to}} explain myself to Mrs. Joe and Pumblechook, who <b>were</b> <b>so</b> <b>rude</b> to me, and {{that there had been}} a {{beautiful}} young lady at Miss Havisham's who was dreadfully proud, and that she had said I was common, and that I knew I was common, and that I wished I was not common, and that the lies had come of it somehow, though I didn't know how.|$|R
