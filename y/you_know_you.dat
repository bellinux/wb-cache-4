5|$|Mehldau has {{expressed}} an interest in, and knowledge of, philosophy and literature. In a 2003 interview he commented on romanticism and nostalgia, linking pleasure and pain to musical expression: I love {{the part of the}} Orpheus myth where he is allowed to take his wife out of Hades on the condition that he doesn't look back at her for the trip on the river Styx. When he can't help himself, he looks back, and she is pulled back downstream away from him, taken away forever. Music is that moment right when he looks at her: seeing something that you love for an instant being taken away forever. There's an element of folly to the whole thing – you look even though <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> shouldn't. Music kind of yokes together the feeling of attainment and the feeling of loss at the same time.|$|E

25|$|Cruyff is {{sometimes}} {{described as a}} typical kind of ‘artist-footballer’ or ‘footballer-thinker’ who considers football, the so-called 'beautiful game', not a purely athletic/physical competition but an artistic-oriented mind-body game. Because of his distinctive footballing views, Cruyff was called ‘the Spinoza of football’ by some. He believed in a certain style of play, which {{has the power to}} put a smile on the people's faces as he described it. When Cruyff, both as a player and as a manager, spoke about football he often mentioned the entertainment value of the game, that there is more to it than winning. In a 2009 interview with Sportmails Martin Samuel, Arsène Wenger, as a devout follower of Cruyff's footballing ideology, once shared his opinion about football's artistic value, “I believe the target of anything in life should be to do it so well that it becomes an art. When you read some books they are fantastic, the writer touches something in you that <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> would not have brought out of yourself. He makes you discover something interesting in your life. If you are living like an animal, {{what is the point of}} living? What makes daily life interesting is that we try to transform it to something that is close to art. And football is like that. When I watch Barcelona, it is art.” , the author of Cruyff's French biography, called him ‘the greatest actor in the history of football’ because Cruyff was a glorious exception (possibly the only one ever) being the man who ‘played’ outstandingly well multiple roles in the world of football: player, manager, and thinker.|$|E

500|$|... "Let's Get It On" [...] {{features}} soulful, passionate lead vocals and multi-tracked background singing, both by Gaye. It has a 1950s-styled {{melody and}} begins with three wah-wah guitar notes and centers on simple chord changes, while its arrangements are centered on an eccentric rhythm pattern. Its signature guitar line {{is played by}} session musician Don Peake. Music journalist Jon Landau dubs the song [...] "a classic Motown single, endlessly repeatable and always enjoyable". The song is reprised on the fourth track, [...] "Keep Gettin' It On". It expands on the title track's sensual theme with political overtones: [...] "won't you rather make love, children / as opposed to war, like <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> should." ...|$|E
500|$|Following her {{critical}} {{success with}} Walk the Line, Witherspoon admits to spending several years [...] "kind of floundering career-wise".

500|$|Reviews of Midtown Madness were {{generally}} positive, with video game critics praising its gameplay.

GameSpot wrote that [...] "it's fun {{to be able to}} drive like a maniac [...] because <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> can't in real life." [...] Computer and Video Games remarked on the game's humor, provided by other drivers, police, and competitors (described as maniacs), praising the [...] "carnage that unfolds before your windscreen". PC Zone recommended the game, calling it highly refreshing; Total Video Games said the game seemed a good choice, but suggested that it would be outdone by GT Interactive's Driver, released soon after.|$|E
500|$|For {{her second}} Hollywood role, Thompson starred with John Travolta in Mike Nichols's Primary Colors (1998), playing a couple based on Bill and Hillary Clinton. Thompson's character, Susan, is {{described}} as that of an [...] "ambitious, long-suffering wife" [...] who {{has to deal with}} her husband's infidelity. The film was critically well received but lost money at the box office. According to Kevin O'Sullivan of the Daily Mirror, Americans were [...] "blown away" [...] by her performance and accent, and top Hollywood producers became increasingly interested in casting her. Thompson rejected many of the offers, expressing concerns about living in Los Angeles behind walls with bodyguards, and stated [...] "LA is lovely as long as <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> can leave". She also admitted to feeling tired and jaded with the industry at this point, which influenced her decision to leave film for a year. Thompson followed Primary Colors by playing an FBI agent opposite Rickman in the poorly received thriller Judas Kiss (1998).|$|E

500|$|The album's cover {{art is a}} {{modified}} Hubble Space Telescope photo of the planetary nebula MyCn 18, popularly known as the Hourglass Nebula. Hubble Space Telescope photos of the Helix Nebula and Eagle Nebula are also featured in the inside cover and liner notes for this album, respectively.

500|$|The album's lead single, [...] "If It Makes You Happy", {{underwent}} {{several different}} arrangements before {{being turned into}} a rock song. According to musician Jeff Trott, who co-wrote the song along with Crow, [...] "It started off as a twangy, David Lynch-esque sort of thing. Then [...] we played it like punk rock, really fast, as well as country and funky. <b>You</b> <b>know,</b> <b>you</b> get a song and put clothes on it to see what looks good and what doesn't, and usually when you find the right one it's pretty obvious. With that song it was real obvious!" [...] Trott initially wrote the song {{when he was a}} member of Pete Droge's backing band, but Crow added a second verse and strengthened the melody. Sheryl Crow also has contributions by notable musicians. For example, [...] "Sweet Rosalyn" [...] features saxophone by Steve Berlin of Los Lobos, while [...] "Everyday Is a Winding Road" [...] features harmony vocals by Neil Finn of Crowded House.|$|E
500|$|GHTV was {{designed}} by FreeStyleGames {{to allow them to}} provide new music without having to secure more stringent music licensing rights. FreeStyleGames found that this mode attracted the attention of bands who were eager to offer their music for it; the bands saw GHTV as comparable to the marketing that music television channels had done in the 1980s and 1990s, putting the imagery of the band at the player as they played along. FreeStyleGames also compared GHTV to music services like Spotify and Pandora. This approach makes it easier to secure licensing rights, and fits in better with the current [...] "throwaway culture" [...] nature of society today according to Jackson. Jackson explained that the feature and its curated playlists were [...] "about discovering music {{as much as it is}} about going and finding music <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> already like". Activision's Hirshberg stated that GHTV was developed as a better means to provide new songs to players through a round-the-clock content platform, rather than relying on scheduled downloadable content, allowing the company to provide a much larger quantity of songs, with plans for [...] "hundreds at launch on day one" [...] of the game's release.|$|E
