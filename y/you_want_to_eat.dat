500|$|With his win, Carpenter {{became the}} first {{contestant}} in the worldwide Millionaire franchise to win the show's top prize. He said that the only question that had flustered him was one which asked for {{the location of the}} Gunfight at the O.K. Corral. Carpenter eventually remembered that the film Tombstone included the gunfight, and he replied correctly with the answer 'Tombstone, Arizona'. While taking a vacation after his win, Carpenter considered quitting his job with the IRS, but eventually decided against it. He explained to Kiplinger's Personal Finance that [...] "after the taxes, it's not change-your-life kind of money if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> every day." [...] Carpenter also described the fame as having a bigger impact on his life than the money, later stating: [...] "The money doesn't change your life. What happens afterwards might." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Anhui {{agricultural}} {{reforms were}} heralded as brilliant innovations {{by the central}} government. The system implemented by Wan was followed up with reform programs led by Zhao Ziyang in Sichuan province. [...] Along with Xi Zhongxun, Hu Yaobang, and other reformists in charge of implementing wide-ranging reforms, Wan {{was seen as a}} pioneer who made significant contributions to the national reform programmes in the 1980s, winning praise from paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. Wan Li was immortalised by the folk saying [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> rice, look for Wan Li." ...|$|E
2500|$|Zhao was {{appointed}} Party Secretary of Sichuan in 1975, effectively the province's highest-ranking official. Earlier in the Cultural Revolution, Sichuan had been notable for the violent battles that rival organizations of local Red Guards had fought against each other. At the time, Sichuan was China's most populous province, {{but it had}} been economically devastated by the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution, whose collective policies had collapsed the province's agricultural production to levels not seen since the 1930s, despite a great increase in the province's population. The economic situation was so bad that citizens in Sichuan were reportedly selling their daughters for food. Soon after taking office, Zhao introduced a series of successful market-oriented reforms, leading to an increase in industrial production by 81% and agricultural output by 25% within three years. Zhao's reforms made him popular in Sichuan, where the local people created a saying: [...] "yao chi liang, zhao Ziyang". (This saying is a pun on Zhao's name, which can be loosely translated as: [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat,</b> look for Ziyang.") ...|$|E

2500|$|Mozart himself, {{during his}} short stay in Dresden, {{was an almost}} daily visitor to the Körners' house. For the charming and witty Doris he was all aflame and with his south German vivacity he paid her the naïvest compliments. He {{generally}} came shortly before dinner and, after he had poured out a stream of gallant phrases, he sat down to improvise at the pianoforte. In the next room the table was meanwhile being set and the soup dished up, and the servant announced that dinner was served. But who could tear himself away when Mozart was improvising! The soup was allowed to grow cold and the roast to burn, simply {{so that we could}} continue to listen to the magic sound which the master, completely absorbed in what he was doing and unaware {{of the rest of the}} world, conjured from the instrument. Yet one finally grows tired even of the highest pleasures when the stomach makes known its demands. After the soup had grown cold a few times while Mozart played, he was briefly taken to task. [...] "Mozart", said Doris, gently laying her snow-white arm on his shoulder, [...] "Mozart, we are going in to dine; do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> with us?" [...] But it was precisely Mozart who never did come; he played on undisturbed. Thus we often had the rarest Mozartian musical accompaniment to our meal, Doris concluded her narrative, and when we rose from table we found him still sitting at the keyboard.|$|E

And now come nearer to me, child, so that there may be no need of bawling what I've got to say all over Oyster Pond. There, sit down, my dear, and don't look so eager, as if <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> me, or my mind may misgive me, and then I couldn't tell you, a'ter all. Perhaps it would be best, if I was to keep my own secret." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You are {{not doing}} justice to your profession, Jack. Your pulse is 75, and that won't do {{for a man who}} habitually deals faro. Been doing pretty well lately, and having a good time, eh? I thought so! You've been running too fast, and under too high pressure. You must take these weights off the safely valve, Jack--better take the blower down altogether. Bank your fires and run on half steam. For the next two months I shall run you. You must live like a Christian." [...] Noticing the horror of Jack's face, he added hastily, [...] "I mean go to bed before midnight, get up before <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to,</b> <b>eat</b> more and drink less, don't play to win, bore {{yourself}} thoroughly, and by that time I'll be able to put you back at that table as strong and cool as ever. You used to sing, Jack; sit down at the piano and give me a taste of your quality. * * * There, that'll do; I thought so! You're out of practice and voice. Do that every day, for a week, and it will come easier. I haven't seen you stop and talk to a child for a month. What's become of that little boot-black that you used to bedevil? I've a devilish good mind to send you to a foundling hospital {{for the good of the}} babies and yourself. Find out some poor ranchero with a dozen children, and teach 'em singing. Don't mind what you eat, as long as you eat regularly. I'd have more hopes of you, Jack, if I'd dragged you out of Starvation Camp, in the Sierras, as I did a poor fellow six years ago, than finding you here in these luxurious quarters. Come! Do as I say, and I'll stop that weariness, dissipate that giddiness, get rid of that pain, lower that pulse, and put you back where you were. I don't like your looks, Jack, at all. I'd buck against any bank you ran, all night." ...|$|E

6000|$|No man rose {{to tell me}} {{what were}} the lions of the place. No one volunteered any sort of conveyance. I was {{absolutely}} alone in this big city of white folk.

In Totsukawa we can catch many of them in the summer season. They are {{delicate}} and it’s not so easy to keep them fresh. So when <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> them in the city area, you have to pay not little money for them.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, various securities were listed on the Exchange. The most wanted and the most stable ones were government securities, which is quite understandable as people trusted the state more than public companies. The rule to observe was [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> well, invest in shares. But, if you want to sleep well, invest in government bonds". Between the two world wars, after a four-year break and in a difficult economic situation, the Exchange resumed its business.
