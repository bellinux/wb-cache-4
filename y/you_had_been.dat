500|$|The head of British Secret Intelligence Service, Stewart Menzies, {{stated that}} Cicero {{was indeed a}} double agent and that among the {{documents}} submitted to the Germans were documents of misinformation. Author James Srodes states in his biography of Allen Dulles that some British historians believed that Cicero was [...] "'turned' into a double agent to send disinformation via von Papen". Malcolm Gladwell, author of Pandora's Briefcase, said that an interviewer had questioned Menzies before he died about whether {{he was telling the}} truth. Menzies told the interviewer [...] "Of course, Cicero was under our control," [...] but his truthfulness is questioned. Gladwell stated in an article in The New Yorker; [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> the wartime head of M.I.6, giving an interview shortly before your death, you probably would say that Cicero was one of yours." [...] Gladwell also mentions that while Ribbentrop was wary of Bazna, which curtailed the dissemination of some of Bazna's intelligence, most German intelligence officials were not wary of him.|$|E
500|$|Altogether, Ripken spent 36 {{years in}} the Baltimore Orioles organization, serving as a player, a scout, a coach, and a manager. He is remembered for helping bring about [...] "The Oriole Way", Baltimore's {{tradition}} of excellence. The Baltimore Sun wrote, [...] "Most Baltimore fans couldn't define the term exactly, but they liked that it implied reverence for the sport and {{the skills needed to}} play it well." [...] Elrod Hendricks, another longtime Oriole coach who kept in touch with Ripken throughout the years, said [...] "He was baseball and baseball was him." [...] Sam Perlozzo, who like Ripken spent many years as a third base coach, said [...] "When you were around him, you didn't say much. One reason was out of respect. The other was because you could learn from him, no matter how long <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> in the game." [...] Despite his 36 years with the organization, only a little more than one of them were as manager of the team, causing Thomas Boswell to write, [...] "The idea that a person could find deep satisfaction through fulfilling difficult responsibilities – while never focusing on personal rewards – seems antique these days. Yet Ripken's example makes you wonder if the century, not Senior, has lost its way." [...] Since his death, no Oriole has worn Cal Sr.'s number 7, although the number has not been officially retired.|$|E

He had hoped for similar success to the minutes printed from Admiral Sir John Byng's court martial, which had been held earlier that year, but found they did not sell as well as he had expected. He was told by the printer that ‘if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> condemned to be shot, your trial would have sold as well; but the public take no interest in an honourable acquittal’.|$|E

2500|$|O'Connor {{announced}} {{she was working}} on recording a new album, titled Home, to be released in the beginning of 2012.

Having planned an extensive tour in support of How About I Be Me (and You Be You)?, O'Connor announced on her website in April 2012 that she was [...] "very unwell" [...] and had suffered a serious breakdown between December 2011 and March 2012. This resulted in the cancellation of the tour and all other musical activities for the rest of 2012, at least. O'Connor resumed touring in 2013, announcing The Crazy Baldhead Tour. The second single [...] "4th and Vine" [...] was released on 18 February 2013.|$|E
2500|$|One such theory {{concerns}} Alf Boxall, who {{was reportedly}} involved in intelligence work during {{and immediately after}} World War II. In a 1978 television interview Stuart Littlemore asks: [...] "Mr Boxall, <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> working, hadn't you, in an intelligence unit, before you met this young woman [...] Did {{you talk to her}} about that at all?" [...] In reply, Boxall says [...] "no," [...] and when asked if Harkness could have known, Boxall replies [...] "not unless somebody else told her." [...] When Littlemore suggests in the interview {{that there may have been}} an espionage connection to the dead man in Adelaide, Boxall replies: [...] "It's quite a melodramatic thesis, isn't it?" [...] Boxall's army service record suggests that he served initially in the 4th Water Transport Company, before being seconded to the North Australia Observer Unit (NAOU) – a special operations unit – and that during his time with NAOU, Boxall rose rapidly in rank, being promoted from Lance Corporal to Lieutenant within three months.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the account}} of the raising of Lazarus, Jesus meets with the sisters in turn: Martha {{followed}} by Mary. Martha goes immediately to meet Jesus as he arrives, while Mary waits until she is called. As one commentator notes, [...] "Martha, the more aggressive sister, went to meet Jesus, while quiet and contemplative Mary stayed home. This portrayal of the sisters agrees with that found in Luke 10:38–42." [...] When Mary meets Jesus, she falls at his feet. In speaking with Jesus, both sisters lament that he did not arrive in time to prevent their brother's death: [...] "Lord, if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> here, my brother would not have died." [...] But where Jesus' response to Martha is one of teaching calling her to hope and faith, his response to Mary is more emotional: [...] "When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come along with her also weeping, he was deeply moved in spirit and troubled. As the 17th century Welsh commentator Matthew Henry notes, [...] "Mary added no more, as Martha did; but it appears, by what follows, that what she fell short in words she made up in tears; she said less than Martha, but wept more." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 7 May 1099 the crusaders reached Jerusalem, {{which had}} been recaptured from the Seljuks by the Fatimids of Egypt only a year before. On 15 July, the crusaders were able to end the siege by {{breaking}} down sections of the walls and entering the city. Over {{the course of that}} afternoon, evening and next morning, the crusaders killed almost every inhabitant of Jerusalem. Muslims and Jews alike. Although many Muslims sought shelter atop the Temple Mount inside the Al-Aqsa Mosque, the crusaders spared few lives. According to the anonymous Gesta Francorum, in what some believe {{to be one of the}} most valuable contemporary sources of the First Crusade, [...] "...the slaughter was so great that our men waded in blood up to their ankles...." [...] Tancred claimed the Temple quarter for himself and offered protection to some of the Muslims there, but he was unable to prevent their deaths at the hands of his fellow crusaders. According to Fulcher of Chartres: [...] "Indeed, if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> there you would have seen our feet coloured to our ankles with the blood of the slain. But what more shall I relate? None of them were left alive; neither women nor children were spared." ...|$|E
