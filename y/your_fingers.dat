5|$|In March 1995 {{the group}} signed a record deal with Columbia Records and {{released}} their first full-length album, titled Use <b>Your</b> <b>Fingers</b> (1995), but were subsequently {{dropped by the}} label. At this time Daddy Long Legs and M.S.G., who were angry with Columbia Records, left the band to form another rap group, Wolfpac. Bass player Evil Jared Hasselhoff, drummer Spanky G and turntablist D.J. Q-Ball joined Bloodhound Gang as replacements. In addition, Skip O'Pot2Mus eventually left {{to pursue a career}} outside of the music industry. Eventually, the band began working on their new album, One Fierce Beer Coaster.|$|E

25|$|The coat must be {{stripped}} by hand or a non-cutting knife {{to retain its}} weather-resistant qualities. This does not hurt the dog when done properly. Keeping the skin above the stripped section taut {{with the other hand}} helps especially where the skin is looser, i.e. belly and chest. Never cut the coat – use <b>your</b> <b>fingers</b> or a non-cutting knife. If the coat is clipped, it loses colour and becomes softer, thus losing its weather-resistant characteristics. For the same reason the coat should not be washed too often, as detergents take away the natural skin oils. Most Irish terriers only need washing when dirty.|$|E

25|$|In close-quarters {{fighting}} {{there is}} no more deadly weapon than the knife. In choosing a knife there are two important factors to bear in mind: balance and keenness. The hilt should fit easily in your hand, and the blade should not be so heavy that it tends to drag the hilt from <b>your</b> <b>fingers</b> in a loose grip. It is essential that the blade have a sharp stabbing point and good cutting edges, because an artery torn through (as against a clean cut) tends to contract and stop the bleeding. If a main artery is cleanly severed, the wounded man will quickly lose consciousness and die.|$|E
500|$|... "Lick <b>Your</b> <b>Fingers</b> Clean" [...] was {{recorded}} for Aqualung, {{but was not}} included on the album. The song was drastically re-worked as [...] "Two Fingers" [...] for Tull's 1974 album, War Child. [...] "Lick <b>Your</b> <b>Fingers</b> Clean" [...] was eventually released in 1988 on the 20 Years of Jethro Tull collection. It was then released as a bonus track on the 1996 and 2011 reissues of Aqualung.|$|E
500|$|While the album's predecessor, Use <b>Your</b> <b>Fingers,</b> {{was written}} and {{recorded}} {{in a more}} hip hop-oriented style, featuring distinct rap beats, One Fierce Beer Coaster featured a more alternative-oriented sound. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described The Bloodhound Gang's sound as, [...] "smarmy, smirky alternative funk-metal, complete with junk culture references and [...] "ironic" [...] musical allusions." [...] Former Bloodhound Gang guitarist Lupus Thunder credits Weezer as an inspiration for [...] "Fire Water Burn" [...] and Lemonade and Brownies-era Sugar Ray for [...] "Kiss Me Where It Smells Funny." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{psychedelic}} rock version by the Misunderstood {{was recorded}} in 1966 and released as the B-side to the [...] "I Can Take You to the Sun" [...] single on Fontana Records. [...] Author Dave Thompson writes, [...] "The Misunderstood pumped it up but kept it short, psychedelic sound effects, heart attack drums, [...] eerie harmonics". [...] Misunderstood guitarist Glenn Ross Campbell reworked [...] "Who Do You Love" [...] with his later band, Juicy Lucy, which reached number 14 in the UK Singles Chart in 1970. [...] The song features Campbell's psychedlic steel guitar lines, which Thompson describes [...] "as fast and mean and dirty as any record could have been, a breakneck tour through the bayou swamps and dirt-track roads of the American South, powered by a guitar to make <b>your</b> <b>fingers</b> bleed".|$|E
500|$|Of Rubber Souls [...] "If I Needed Someone", Harrison said: [...] "it's like {{a million}} other songs written around the D chord. If you move <b>your</b> <b>fingers</b> about, you get various little melodies... it amazes me that people still find new {{permutations}} of the same notes." [...] His other contribution to the album, [...] "Think for Yourself", features what Everett described as [...] "ambiguous tonal coloring", using chromaticism in G major with a [...] "strange" [...] mixture of the Dorian mode and the minor pentatonic; he called it a [...] "tour de force of altered scale degrees". In 1966 Harrison contributed innovative musical ideas to Revolver. He played backwards guitar on Lennon's composition [...] "I'm Only Sleeping" [...] and a guitar counter-melody on [...] "And Your Bird Can Sing" [...] that moved in parallel octaves above McCartney's bass downbeats. His guitar playing on [...] "I Want to Tell You" [...] exemplified the pairing of altered chordal colours with descending chromatic lines and his guitar part for Sgt Peppers [...] "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" [...] mirrors Lennon's vocal line {{in much the same}} way that a sarangi player accompanies a khyal singer in a Hindu devotional song.|$|E
500|$|In late January 1567, Mary {{prompted}} {{her husband}} to return to Edinburgh. He recuperated from his illness in a house belonging to the brother of Sir James Balfour at the former abbey of Kirk o' Field, just within the city wall. Mary visited him daily, so that it appeared a reconciliation was in progress. On the night of 9–10 February 1567, Mary visited {{her husband in the}} early evening and then attended the wedding celebrations of a member of her household, Bastian Pagez. In {{the early hours of the}} morning, an explosion devastated Kirk o' Field, and Darnley was found dead in the garden, apparently smothered. There were no visible marks of strangulation or violence on the body. Bothwell, Moray, Secretary Maitland, the Earl of Morton and Mary herself were among those who came under suspicion. Elizabeth wrote to Mary of the rumours, [...] "I should ill fulfil the office of a faithful cousin or an affectionate friend if I did not... tell you what all the world is thinking. Men say that, instead of seizing the murderers, you are looking through <b>your</b> <b>fingers</b> while they escape; that you will not seek revenge on those who have done you so much pleasure, as though the deed would never have taken place had not the doers of it been assured of impunity. For myself, I beg you to believe that I would not harbour such a thought." ...|$|E

500|$|With Brown and Damiani's departure, McCrea felt [...] "freer to experiment" [...] {{with the}} next album, 1998's Prolonging the Magic; he wrote and {{produced}} every song. As {{a result of this}} experimentation, the album was noted as [...] "loaded with spiced-up instrumentation, including a few new ingredients like the pedal steel guitar and musical saw thrown in for extra flavour". McCrea stated that he deliberately [...] "approached writing this record without the guitar as the central assumption of all life in the universe". Music Week described it as an [...] "inspired collection of leftfield rock", while Thor Christensen of The Dallas Morning News said that it [...] "brims with the same dry humor the Sacramento band displayed in past hits such as 'The Distance' and 'Rock and Roll Lifestyle': The leadoff track, 'Satan Is My Motor,' puts a devilish new spin on the rock 'n' roll car-song tradition, while 'When You Sleep' revolves around the question of what <b>your</b> <b>fingers</b> do {{while the rest of the}} body snoozes". Other reviewers were less complimentary, with Mike Pattenden in The Times writing that [...] "Prolonging the Magic suggests that [...] may well be destined to go down as one-hit wonders...While a handful stand out – the country waltz Mexico, You Turn the Screws and Hem of Your Garment – Prolonging the Magic shows McRea and company to be little more than an above average bar-room act. Cake are surviving on songwriting crumbs". The album peaked at number33 on the Billboard 200, was listed in The Columbian as the second best album of 1998, and eventually went platinum after shipping over 1million units.|$|E
500|$|Sharma was {{recommended}} {{for the part}} of AJ by Nitin Ganatra (Masood) after the character was described to him, because producers wanted AJ and Masood to be funny together. The two actors had previously performed in comedy together in short film The Drop, Channel 4's Meet the Magoons and a programme called To Eat with <b>Your</b> <b>Fingers,</b> so Ganatra thought Sharma would be perfect for the role {{and he was the}} first person he thought of. Ganatra and the producers went through ideas of how a brother would affect Masood and what their relationship would be. Ganatra explained that he thought Masood only had one brother until he was told about AJ. When Sharma and Ganatra performed a scene together at Sharma's audition, the dialogue came so naturally to them that producers thought they were improvising, but, as Ganatra explained, they [...] "know each other's style [...] have all these shortcuts. It's like having a real brother." [...] Sharma was offered the part immediately after his interview. Sharma added in March 2013: [...] "I've known Nitin for years and he really lobbied for me to get the role of AJ, and as soon as I finished my audition the producers offered me the part and asked if I wanted a cup of tea, to which I replied, 'Yes please, I've waited 20 years for that cup of tea', but it's been really nice to just jump onto a set with someone I've already bonded with—it's like having a pre-built family to bounce off." [...] He had also previously worked with his co-stars Nina Wadia (Zainab) and Marc Elliott (Syed Masood), so felt it was [...] "cool" [...] and [...] "familiar" [...] to work with them. Sharma revealed in an interview with Inside Soap that his own mother always thought he should play Masood's brother after watching EastEnders for many years. The first scene Sharma filmed was with Ganatra on the set outside The Queen Victoria public house, and he found it [...] "really surreal".|$|E
500|$|Other {{reviews from}} the North American {{leg of the}} tour {{included}} Melissa Ruggierie writing for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution online blog. Ruggierie praised Beyoncé's performance, particularly the strong vocals demonstrated in [...] "1+1" [...] and concluded [...] "watching her command a stadium stage for two hours was another reminder of her limitless ambition". However, {{it was noted that}} Beyoncé did not speak to the crowd very often. After Beyoncé's hometown performance in Houston, Brandon Caldwell of the Houston Press introduced his article stating [...] "Hours after the slaying, the wig snatching, the fitted snatching, the life getting, the boy byes and various curses of shock, amazement and confusion, I stood with a perplexed look on my face. How? How does Beyoncé do this? On this level? With this magnitude?". Lorraine Ali of the Los Angeles Times concluded her positive review of the Pasadena stop of the tour with [...] "Soaking wet and sitting onstage alone, she left the audience with the closing number, [...] "Halo". She'd been baptized and reborn into a less-perfect version of Queen Bey, allowing a more powerful Beyoncé to arise from that imperfection". Jim Harrington of the San Jose Mercury News began his article stating [...] "there were so many moving parts – a tremendous swirl of sharply choreographed dance routines, cool special effects, brilliant fireworks and other tactics for delighting tens of thousands", Harrington noted however that too many snippets of songs rather than their full versions were performed, feeling quality over quantity was missed. The first Canadian show of the tour in Edmonton was performed in cold and rainy conditions, with Beyoncé stating [...] "Can you feel <b>your</b> <b>fingers?</b> I can't feel mine" [...] and [...] "I have to say this is the coldest show I've ever done". Despite this, Sandra Sperounes of the Edmonton Journal commented [...] "not even rain or bitter wind could stop our Ms. Flawless, our Survivor, our Queen Bey from dazzling an estimated 40,000 fans at Commonwealth Stadium on a stormy Friday night." [...] Sperounes concluded [...] "the sun was nowhere to be found, but thanks to Bey's brilliant set, the crowd left beaming with giddiness, girl power and generosity".|$|E
