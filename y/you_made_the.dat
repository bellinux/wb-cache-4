2500|$|The best {{alternative}} to a negotiated agreement, or BATNA is the alternative option a negotiator holds should the current negotiation fails and does not reach agreement. [...] The quality of a BATNA {{has the potential to}} improve a party's negotiation outcome. Understanding one's BATNA can empower an individual and allow him or her to set higher goals when moving forward. One of the best strategy while going into a negotiation is to ensure that you have a strong BATNA, and if not, have tools equipped that can help <b>you</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> other side's BATNA weak. One of the major mistakes made by new negotiators is to disclose their BATNA at first without having had any discussion with the other side. This can jeopardise your position in the negotiation, as your negotiation might have been weaker than the other sides, and such disclosure puts you at a weaker spot in the negotiation. The best strategy is to {{ask a lot of questions}} to develop, if not an exact, but a guess about the other sides BATNA to know your position in the negotiation.|$|E

The songs lyrics {{pertain to the}} {{influence}} of Jackson and his worldwide appeal and effect, as well as reflecting on their own personal memories of Jackson.

[...] "Better on the Other Side" [...] opens with a piano-accompanied soundscape starts off with Diddy [...] "testifying" [...] about Jackson's influence with the lyrics, [...] "I believed I can do anything," [...] he says. [...] "You made the world dance. <b>You</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> music come to life." [...] Then a [...] "thunderous bass drops" [...] in, led by Brown's vocals on the chorus, [...] "This the type of song that makes the angels cry/ Look up in the sky and I wonder why/ Why you had to go, go/ I know it's better on the other side." [...] The song concludes with one last statement from Diddy, [...] "People can say what they want about you. We gonna remember the miracles that you showed us. Through your music, through your dance. You were the one that made us realize that you are the world. Through us your legacy lives on, Mike Jackson." ...|$|E
2500|$|The New York Post {{wrote that}} the lyrics [...] "express {{emotions}} ranging from the flip to the resigned". Sharan Shetty of Slate stated that the song is about [...] "heartbreak and redemption", while a Yahoo! News reviewer noted that it is about [...] "personal travails and confusion". Nora Crotty of Elle magazine described the single as an [...] "ode to repenting {{in the morning for}} the foolish mistakes <b>you</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> night before". Billboards Vena stated that a [...] "plucky acoustic guitar" [...] accompanies Rihanna's vocals while she sings the lines, [...] "I think I've had enough/ Might get a little drunk/ I say what's on my mind/ I might do a little time. Cause all of my kindness/ Is taken for weakness." [...] After the first chorus West sings, [...] "Woke up an optimist/ Sun was shining, I'm positive/ Then I heard you was talking trash/ Hold me back/ I'm about to spazz." [...] On the second chorus, he and Rihanna harmonize as they sing, [...] "Now I'm four, five seconds from wildin'/ And we got three more days 'till Friday/ I'm just trying to make it back home by Monday morning." [...] McCartney's voice can be heard sped up underneath West's opening vocals. McCartney originally played his guitar part slower and in a lower key, which West later speeded up for the finished release, thus causing McCartney's voice to sound much higher than its normal tone. McCartney's lyrics were improvised mid-performance and are for the most part drowned out by West's vocals except for the lines [...] "We can run around" [...] and [...] "How 'bout a mystery" ...|$|E

[...] Towards the ending on the song The Game claims that the feud between him and 50 Cent is over, presumably due to Jackson's death, [...] "First thing I did when I heard was I called Puff. Cause him and Mike tried to stop the beef between us, Who was us? Me and fifty, that beef is dead, and the young Mike Jackson gonna take us to the ledge." [...] After this line, Chris Brown then sings the chorus. Hinting that he is the [...] "young Mike Jackson."
