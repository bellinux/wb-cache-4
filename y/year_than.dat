5|$|Barbary falcons have a {{red neck}} patch but {{otherwise}} differ in appearance from the peregrine proper merely according to Gloger's Rule, relating pigmentation to environmental humidity. The Barbary falcon has a peculiar way of flying, beating only {{the outer part}} of its wings like fulmars sometimes do; this also occurs in the peregrine, but less often and far less pronounced. The Barbary falcon's shoulder and pelvis bones are stout by comparison with the peregrine, and its feet are smaller. Barbary falcons breed {{at different times of}} <b>year</b> <b>than</b> neighboring peregrine falcon subspecies, but they are capable of interbreeding.

5|$|Friends of the High Line {{has raised}} more than $150 million in public and private funds toward the {{construction}} of the first two sections of the High Line. Unlike the first two phases of the High Line, which the city contributed to significantly, Friends of the High Line was solely responsible for raising funding for Phase 3, which is estimated to have cost roughly $35 million. Friends of the High Line raises more than 90 percent of the park's annual operating budget from private donations. A 2012 donation of $5 million from the city was controversial since the High Line received more funding that <b>year</b> <b>than</b> most city parks did, even though Friends of the High Line raised an extra $85 million that year.|$|E
5|$|In chapter nine, Marita's Bargain, Gladwell {{advances}} {{the notion}} that the success of students of different cultures or different socio-economic backgrounds is in fact highly correlated to the time students spent in school or in educationally rich environments. He describes the Knowledge is Power Program (KIPP) which helps students from about 50 inner-city schools across the United States achieve much better results than other inner-city schools' students and explains that their success {{stems from the fact that}} they simply spent more hours at school during the school year and the summer. Gladwell also analyzes a five-year study done by Karl Alexander of Johns Hopkins University, demonstrating that summer holidays have a detrimental effect on students of disadvantaged backgrounds, who paradoxically progress more during the school <b>year</b> <b>than</b> students from the highest socio-economic group.|$|E

5|$|In {{temperate}} areas, {{the male}} owl moults rather {{later in the}} <b>year</b> <b>than</b> the female, {{at a time when}} there is an abundance of food, the female has recommenced hunting and the demands of the chicks are lessening. Unmated males without family responsibilities often start losing feathers earlier in the year. The moult follows a similar prolonged pattern to that of the female and the first sign that the male is moulting is often when a tail feather has been dropped at the roost. A consequence of moulting is the loss of thermal insulation. This is of little importance in the tropics and barn owls here usually moult a complete complement of flight feathers annually. The hot-climate moult may still take place over a long period but is usually concentrated at a particular time of year outside the breeding season.|$|E
5|$|Like most of South Korea's smaller cities, Gyeongju {{has seen}} a steady drop in {{population}} in recent years. From 2002 to 2008, the city lost 16,557 people. This is primarily due to the migration of workers seeking employment in the major South Korean cities. In 2007, about 1,975 more people {{moved away from the}} city each <b>year</b> <b>than</b> moved in. During the same period, births exceeded deaths by roughly 450 per year, a significant number but not enough to offset the losses due to migration.|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} between criminal {{behavior and the}} risk factors, family criminal records and drug use, has been firmly established. With the aim of defining the role of these risk factors in the initiation and evolution of criminal behavior, a field study with prison inmates was designed. A survival analysis with {{the age at which}} the first unsanctioned crime was committed and the age at which entered by first instance into prison was applied to the data of 157 prison inmates in Villabona (Asturias, Spain). The results of a survival analysis showed that drug abuse re-offenders initiated in criminal acts at an earlier age (13 <b>years)</b> <b>than</b> the primary offenders (16 years); re-offenders from family criminal records began his/her criminal activity earlier (13 <b>years)</b> <b>than</b> primary ones (16 years); re-offenders with non-criminal family records, initiate in criminal acts at 14 years, whereas primary at 16; the recidivist drug abusers enter by first instance into prison earlier (19 <b>years)</b> <b>than</b> the primary ones; non-drug consuming primary offenders enter prison {{for the first time at}} the age of 24 whereas recidivists do so at the age of 19; the first entrance into prison of the recidivist with family criminal records occurs early (19 <b>years),</b> <b>than</b> for the primary offenders (23 years); and the recidivist prisoners of non-family criminal records cross the threshold of the prison by first time youngsters (21 <b>years)</b> <b>than</b> the primary inmates (26 years). The implications of these results may lead towards a more effective intervention against crime...|$|R
5|$|The 1955 Dodgers {{got off to}} {{a strong}} start. Even so, an Associated Press article noted that Alston was reticent in {{response}} to questions and that he did not seem like a manager who had won ten consecutive games. The 1955 Brooklyn team won the pennant and its only World Series championship. They clinched the NL pennant earlier in the <b>year</b> <b>than</b> any team had in NL history. In the World Series, Alston started Johnny Podres, who had a mediocre 9-10 regular season record, in the third and seventh games; Podres won both games.

5|$|The animal can be host to {{a number}} of {{different}} parasites. In one study, blue wildebeest were found to be hosts to thirteen species of nematode, one trematode, larvae of five oestrid flies, three species of lice, seven ixodid tick species, one mite and the larvae of a tongue worm. Of these, most were more prevalent at some times of the <b>year</b> <b>than</b> others. Generally, the larvae of Gedoelstica and Oestrus occur in the nasal passages and respiratory cavities of the blue wildebeest, and sometimes migrate to the brain. Compared to some other bovids, blue wildebeest are resistant to infestations by several species of tick.|$|E
5|$|The terns are {{birds of}} open {{habitats}} that typically breed in noisy colonies and {{lay their eggs}} on bare ground {{with little or no}} nest material. Marsh terns construct floating nests from the vegetation in their wetland habitats, and a few species build simple nests in trees, on cliffs or in crevices. The white tern, uniquely, lays its single egg on a bare tree branch. Depending on the species, one to three eggs make up the clutch. Most species feed on fish caught by diving from flight, but the marsh terns are insect-eaters, and some large terns will supplement their diet with small land vertebrates. Many terns are long-distance migrants, and the Arctic tern may see more daylight in a <b>year</b> <b>than</b> any other animal.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Keith was the {{eleventh}} Atlantic tropical cyclone of the 1988 Atlantic hurricane season. It struck the Continental United States {{later in the}} calendar <b>year</b> <b>than</b> any since the 1925 Atlantic hurricane season. Keith developed out of a tropical wave in the Caribbean Sea on November17. It tracked northwestward, and under generally favorable conditions, it reached a peak intensity of 70mph (110km/h) shortly before striking the northeastern tip of the Yucatán Peninsula. It turned northeastward in the Gulf of Mexico, and made landfall near Sarasota, Florida, on November23. Keith accelerated its forward motion {{under the influence of}} a cold front, and became extratropical near Bermuda on November24. The extratropical remnant persisted for two more days.|$|E
5|$|Two {{forms of}} juldarigi, from Gijisi (Dangjin) and Yeongsang, are {{recognised}} as Important Intangible Cultural Properties of Korea. The Yeongsan ceremony is held {{later in the}} <b>year</b> <b>than</b> elsewhere, having been moved from the lunar festival to March 1 in the mid-twentieth century (to commemorate the March 1st Movement). In 2009, a special ₩20000 coin was minted in South Korea commemorating the Yeongsan juldarigi. In Gijisi, where the sport has been practiced for at least 500 years, the traditional East/West divide is replaced with a division of teams into upriver and downriver. The centipede-like shape of the rope is said to resemble {{the way in which}} the villages of the region are arranged. Gijisi is also home to a museum devoted to the practice of juldarigi.|$|E
5|$|Agnew's pride {{had been}} stung by the {{negative}} {{news coverage of}} him during the campaign, and he sought to bolster his reputation by assiduous performance of his duties. It had become usual {{for the vice president}} to preside over the Senate only if he might be needed to break a tie, but Agnew opened every session for the first two months of his term, and spent more time presiding, in his first <b>year,</b> <b>than</b> any vice president since Alben Barkley, who held that role under Harry S. Truman. The first postwar vice president not to have been a senator, he took lessons in Senate procedures from the parliamentarian and from a Republican committee staffer. He lunched with small groups of senators, and was initially successful in building good relations. Although silenced on foreign policy matters, he attended White House staff meetings and spoke on urban affairs; when Nixon was present, he often presented the perspective of the governors. Agnew earned praise from the other members when he presided over a meeting of the White House Domestic Council in Nixon's absence but, like Nixon during Eisenhower's illnesses, did not sit in the president's chair. Nevertheless, many of the commission assignments Nixon gave Agnew were sinecures, with the vice president only formally the head.|$|E
