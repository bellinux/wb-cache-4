In a comparison between the ZX81 and IBM PC published in Which Micro?, he commended the ZX81's user-friendliness and its on-the-fly syntax checking of BASIC programs, which he described as [...] "the feature that I, as a newcomer to computing, want to see incorporated into every micro." ...|$|E
500|$|Baxter {{was noted}} for {{accurate}} passes, for sending opponents {{the wrong way}} with a swivel of his hips, and for inspiring teammates with his confident approach. He attracted attention by his stylish play, controlling the game with [...] "unhurried artistry". He refused to conform with the [...] "efficient" [...] style that dominated British football or the energetic, physical style that was typical of Rangers at the time. Indeed, although Rangers insisted that players tuck their shirts completely into their shorts, Baxter always let part of his dangle over his left hip. He described his approach to playing football as [...] "treating the ball like a woman. Give it a cuddle, caress it a wee bit, take <b>your</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> you'll get the required response".|$|E
500|$|Despite Khan's {{enthusiasm for}} the idea of a sequel, the film {{industry}} expressed mixed opinions regarding it. Filmmaker Rajkumar Gupta commented, [...] "It would be challenging to take forward a story that has not worked earlier." [...] Producer Ramesh Taurani responded negatively to the idea, saying, [...] "It is important for the film to be appreciated so that a sequel can be made." [...] Trade analyst Atul Mohan called the sequel [...] "a bad idea." [...] Conversely, others were supportive of the sequel. Producer Goldie Behl brushed aside arguments about the success of the first film, saying, [...] "If the people think that they can earn some more, then it doesn't matter how big or small the hit was." [...] Director Kunal Kohli also reacted positively, saying, [...] "Certain ideas naturally lend themselves to sequels. So why not use that investment of <b>your</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> effort to make a sequel that will take the brand further?" ...|$|E

500|$|On September 21, 2005, it was {{announced}} that Taking Back Sunday had begun recording their third album with Eric Valentine. The group chose Valentine because he had produced Queens of the Stone Age's Songs for the Deaf (2002) and Third Eye Blind's self-titled album (1997). Although they met with Howard Benson and Rob Cavallo, the band's [...] "love of Eric’s work kind of trumped any other meeting we had." [...] Unlike their previous records, the group worked in a large studio (Barefoot Studios in Los Angeles, California). Warner Bros. told them, [...] "Take <b>your</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> it’s done when you’re done with it," [...] and the band re-recorded the demos. According to Mascherino, the group [...] "knew how it was going to come out... was a thorough way to do it." [...] Working in a big studio, according to Lazzara, gave the band the opportunity to [...] "have more than two guitar sounds." ...|$|E
500|$|Johnson {{also contributed}} {{significantly}} to children's literature. His publication of Barbauld's Lessons for Children (1778–79) spawned {{a revolution in the}} newly emerging genre. Its plain style, mother-child dialogues, and conversational tone inspired a generation of authors, such as Sarah Trimmer. Johnson encouraged other women to write in this genre, such as Charlotte Smith, but his recommendation always came with a caveat of how difficult it was to write well for children. For example, he wrote to Smith, [...] "perhaps you cannot employ <b>your</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> extraordinary talents more usefully for the public & your self , than in composing books for children and young people, but I am very sensible it is extreamly [...] difficult to acquire that simplicity of style which is their great recommendation". He also advised William Godwin and his second wife, Mary Jane Clairmont, on the publication of their Juvenile Library (started in 1805). Not only did Johnson encourage the writing of British children's literature, but he also helped sponsor the translation and publication of popular French works such as Arnaud Berquin's [...] (1782–83).|$|E
500|$|Famitsus reviewers each {{praised the}} gameplay, story, and the {{introduction}} of full-motion movies. One reviewer cited it as the series' new exemplar, while another pointed out rough edges in the graphical redesign and that the new 3D perspective made seeing some parts of the map difficult. 1UP.com's Shane Betternhausen was positive overall, saying [...] " [...] delivers a superbly paced and rewarding adventure". RPGamer's Chris Privitere said [...] "While Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance doesn't necessarily add anything new to the tactical genre, it does everything very well", recommending it to players while stressing the need for patience. Peer Schneider of IGN called the game [...] "yet another worthy installment in Intelligent Systems' venerable strategy RPG series". RPGFan reviewer Mark Tjan said that while not the best Fire Emblem game he had played, [...] "it's certainly a good game and worth picking up if you're searching for an SRPG worth <b>your</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> money". Nintendo World Report's Karl Castaneda was also highly positive, though commenting that its graphical quality were more suited to {{the early days of the}} GameCube's life and that it might have been a great success if released during that period. Eurogamer's Tom Bramwell, despite feeling that the game was flawed by inherent problems in the Fire Emblem formula, enjoyed the game and was willing to replay once he had finished. Greg Kasavin, writing for GameSpot, saying that [...] "by replacing the traditional random battles that typify most Japanese role-playing games with a fun and exciting turn-based combat system, and by going out of its way to deliver a memorable and genuinely emotional story, Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance accomplishes what all role-playing games attempt, but very few actually manage to do". The majority of praise went to the game's story and gameplay, while criticism was focused on the graphical quality.|$|E

The Thing is well-paced, designed with an excellent variety of levels [...] Everything {{is consistent with the}} movie, the theme of which has been handled with exquisite care and thought. With the exception of the blood test goofs and the rather thin storyline, The Thing warrants <b>your</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> money." [...] Steve Polak scored the PC version 8.5 out of 10, writing [...] "The Thing is for the most part an immersive and enjoyable game. The visuals and sound are top notch and the sense of desperation you feel when you are stuck outside and about to succumb to the elements or being hunted by packs of the foul creatures is very real. The squad based elements and the way you keep your men from losing their minds also adds to the depth of the play experience." ...|$|E
