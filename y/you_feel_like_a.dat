500|$|According to Josh Tyrangiel of Time magazine, {{the meaning}} to [...] "Talk" [...] {{is based on}} how Martin [...] "wants to teach us how to feel better about ourselves, and his lessons have the moral superiority {{disguised}} as sensitivity that marked Bono's mighty mullet period." [...] Tyrangiel interpreted the lyrics, [...] "Are you lost or incomplete/ Do <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> puzzle, you can't find your missing piece/ Tell me how you feel", with Martin begging in the song.|$|E
500|$|Another {{recurrent}} {{theme in}} the album is that everything is broken, out of place or missing; This is apparent in nearly all songs in the album. Examples include [...] "Fix You" [...] ("When you lose something you can't replace") and also in [...] "X" [...] ("When something is broken, {{and you try to}} fix it, trying to repair it, any way you can") and [...] "Talk" [...] ("Are you lost or incomplete? Do <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> puzzle, you can't find your missing piece?"). This theme is also reflective of the random, incomprehensible pattern on the album's cover (until you [...] "fix" [...] it using the Baudot Code).|$|E

500|$|... "Express Yourself" [...] {{begins with}} the sound of brass tinkling along, as Madonna chimes the opening line: [...] "Come on girls, do you believe in love? 'Cause I got {{something}} to say about it, And it goes something like this." [...] Handclaps and drum beats start as Madonna moves into the chorus of the song, with a thick vocal texture and high-pitched background singing. The chorus is aided by instrumentation from a saxophone and percussion. Madonna then sings the first verse of the song, as a violin sound is added after she finishes the bridge, [...] "Make <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> queen on the throne, make you love it till you never come down", a male voice repeating the last line. A synthesizer is played after the second verse as Madonna continues chanting the words [...] "Express yourself" [...] with background vocals singing [...] "Hey, hey, hey, hey" [...] alongside her.|$|E
500|$|... "Electioneering", {{featuring}} a cowbell and a distorted guitar solo, is the album's most rock-oriented track {{and one of}} the heaviest songs Radiohead has recorded. It has been compared to Radiohead's earlier style on Pablo Honey. The cynical [...] "Electioneering" [...] is the album's most directly political song, with lyrics inspired by the Poll Tax Riots. The song was also inspired by Chomsky's , a book analysing contemporary mass media under the propaganda model. Yorke likened its lyrics, which focus on political and artistic compromise, to [...] "a preacher ranting in front of a bank of microphones." [...] Regarding its oblique political references, Yorke said, [...] "What can you say about the IMF, or politicians? Or people selling arms to African countries, employing slave labour or whatever. What can you say? You just write down 'Cattle prods and the IMF' and people who know, know." [...] O'Brien said the song was about the promotional cycle of touring: [...] "After a while <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> politician who has to kiss babies and shake hands all day long." ...|$|E
500|$|Grohl {{declared}} that [...] "making this record revitalized this band", particularly the acoustic songs, as they [...] "showed ourselves what we're capable of doing" [...] and [...] " [...] things scary again. You {{do something that}} you've never done, and it makes <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> bigger band." [...] The frontman also stated the mellower acoustic disc {{was an opportunity to}} use [...] "the acoustic tracks we wrote in the past eight or nine years, but never put on albums because they never seemed to fit", particularly because Grohl felt that [...] "it's hard to put an acoustic song {{in the middle of a}} rock record, because sometimes it mucks up the sequence." [...] The tracks include Grohl's first composition [...] "Friend of a Friend" [...] – done in 1990, and previously recorded under the pseudonym 'Late!' on the cassette Pocketwatch; [...] "Razor", which Grohl wrote for a benefit concert at the Wiltern Theatre; and drummer Taylor Hawkins' composition [...] "Cold Day in the Sun", which after an attempt to do an electric version became an unplugged track, featuring Hawkins on vocals and tambourine and Grohl in the drums.|$|E

500|$|Critics praised Super Meat Boys {{platforming}} elements, {{and often}} {{commented on the}} game's difficulty. X-Play reviewer Alexandra Hall said the game had [...] "riveting platforming action", and added that [...] "Super Meat Boys designers are masters of their craft." [...] Henry Gilbert of GamesRadar felt the platforming was [...] "perfect". He wrote that [...] "while it's always tough and demanding, it never feels cheap, or like the game is cheating you." [...] A reviewer from GameTrailers stated that [...] "the difficulty rides the perfect line between driving you utterly bonkers when you fail and making <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> platform pro when you succeed". Joystiq's Richard Mitchell echoed other reviewers' comments: [...] "Super Meat Boy is tough, as tough as the toughest nails in the toughest universe." [...] Gilbert cited the level of difficulty, which he believed made the game inaccessible to some players, as his reason for not awarding the game a perfect score. Tom McShea of GameSpot praised the game's [...] "precise control", [...] "excellent level design", and [...] "smooth difficulty curve". Reviewer Tom Bramwell of Eurogamer warned that Super Meat Boy is [...] "a hard game. It should {{make you want to}} throw the pad across the room".|$|E
500|$|Thematically, {{influences}} behind The Operative: No One Lives Forever {{were primarily}} 1960s spy-themed films, novels, television shows, {{as well as}} historical references. When {{it was decided that}} NOLF {{was going to be a}} 1960s spy game, lead designer Craig Hubbard started immersing himself in the subject matter, in order to [...] "develop some fluency" [...] in it. As he explained, he [...] "was a big fan of early Bond films, but didn't know a lot about the whole spy craze. So I watched the Derek Flint movies , Modesty Blaise, Matt Helm, , Avengers – anything I could get my hands on." [...] Other influences included books, such as The Spy Who Came in from the Cold, TV shows like The Saint, The Pink Panther films, commando movies, such as The Guns of Navarone, as well as [...] "lots of historical references, encompassing everything from books and documentaries on the spy trade to fashion catalogs and interior-design books." [...] The basis for the biological explosives plot was the 1967 film Casino Royale. According to Hubbard, [...] "the idea was to create a game that would make <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> superspy, so we tried to come up with situations, characters, and settings to support that goal." [...] During the course of the game, the player can hear explicit popular culture references, including the TV series The Prisoner and The Fugitive, the Matt Helm films The Silencers and The Ambushers, and exotica musicians Les Baxter and Sondi Sodsai. Other conversations allude to major events of the time, such as the studio years of The Beatles, and the commercial failure of the Edsel automobile.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} not without its detractors. Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote, [...] "It's {{a measure of how}} the film {{operates}} that not once do we feel particular sympathy for any of the shark's victims.... In the best films, characters are revealed in terms of the action. In movies like Jaws, characters are simply functions of the action... like stage hands who move props around and deliver information when it's necessary". He did, however, describe it as [...] "the sort of nonsense that can be a good deal of fun". Los Angeles Times critic Charles Champlin disagreed with the film's PG rating, saying that [...] "Jaws is too gruesome for children, and likely to turn the stomach of the impressionable at any age.... It is a coarse-grained and exploitative work which depends on excess for its impact. Ashore it is a bore, awkwardly staged and lumpily written." [...] Marcia Magill of Films in Review said that while Jaws [...] "is eminently worth seeing for its second half", she felt that before the protagonists' pursuit of the shark the film was [...] "often flawed by its busyness". William S. Pechter of Commentary described Jaws as [...] "a mind-numbing repast for sense-sated gluttons" [...] and [...] "filmmaking of this essentially manipulative sort"; Molly Haskell of The Village Voice similarly characterized it as a [...] "scare machine that works with computer-like precision.... <b>You</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> rat, being given shock therapy". The most frequently criticized aspect of the film has been the artificiality of its mechanical antagonist: Magill declared that [...] "the programmed shark has one truly phony close-up", and in 2002, online reviewer James Berardinelli said that if not for Spielberg's deftly suspenseful direction, [...] "we would be doubled over with laughter at the cheesiness of the animatronic creature." [...] Halliwell's Film Guide stated that [...] "despite genuinely suspenseful and frightening sequences, it is a slackly narrated and sometimes flatly handled thriller with an over-abundance of dialogue and, when it finally appears, a pretty unconvincing monster." ...|$|E

2500|$|In March 2001, {{after being}} {{notified}} by a viewer, Nick at Nite quickly edited an episode ("The Charming Stranger") where John Ritter's scrotum skin was briefly {{visible through the}} bottom of a pair of blue boxer shorts. The most famous quip about this issue was uttered by John Ritter, who told the New York Observer when they asked him about the controversy: [...] "I've requested that Nickelodeon air both versions, edited and unedited, because sometimes <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> nut, and sometimes you don't" [...] (quoting an advertising jingle for Almond Joy and Mounds candy bars). The incident was also brought up during a [...] "Celebrity Secrets" [...] comedy bit on Late Night with Conan O'Brien in the late 1990s, where a nervous-acting Ritter jokingly says [...] "Somebody asked me if I did that on purpose...", after taking a nervous sip of water, he responds [...] "You bet I did!" ...|$|E

2500|$|From the New York {{listening}} party Rolling Stone said [...] "'Million Dollar Bill' is a clattering, uptempo hip-hop-inspired number. It may be {{the fastest}} ever for Houston, who keeps up nicely. It received a standing ovation setting the tone {{for much of the}} album." [...] MTVs Shaheem Reid comments revolved around the first track 'Million Dollar Bill', saying that [...] "Houston sings of looking for love and finding a man with potential. [...] "If he makes <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> million-dollar bill, say, 'Oh, oh/ Oh, oh,' [...] " [...] she sings on the hook. [...] "It's {{been a long time since}} love has come my way. I've been looking and searching for a man to touch this place." [...] Right from the start, 'Million Dollar Bill' displays her billion-dollar voice over a club-friendly Swizz track that even got Alicia Keys up and dancing while taking video with her personal camera as the words she wrote boomed through the speakers. Dean Piper of the Daily Mirror considered it a [...] "summer track" [...] reminiscent of Janet Jackson's [...] "The Best Things in Life Are Free." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nick Levine of Digital Spy said [...] "Written by Alicia Keys and {{produced}} by Swizz Beatz (probably {{best known for}} Beyoncé's 'Check On It' and 'Ring the Alarm'), it's a midtempo disco track with an unabashedly feelgood message.

The Voice is deeper and raspier than you might remember, but she's still capable of going for a money note. 'Million Dollar Bill' won't be storming any barns in a hurry, but it's a classy, dignified and thoroughly likeable comeback effort. Whitney, it's {{good to have you}} back." [...] Bill Lamb of About.com gave a mixed review saying, [...] "The good news on [...] "Million Dollar Bill" [...] is the performance is undeniably the Whitney Houston we all know. [...] The down side is it's all almost too familiar. The arrangement courtesy producer Swizz Beatz is very old school R [...] Alicia Keys has written a song that fits very well with her tradition of [...] "old soul" [...] songs, but Whitney Houston has failed to give it a new twist that would successfully make the old stunningly new again.". He also gave the song 3.5 stars out of five.|$|E
2500|$|McFly {{have been}} cited as having {{influenced}} a number of high-profile musicians in various different ways. Of particular note are Niall Horan and Louis Tomlinson of One Direction, who have credited McFly as the opening act of the first concert they had ever attended. Speaking about meeting with the group, Jones said [...] "it turned out that Niall and Louis were at one of our first ever shows. And they were all like, 'we copied your haircuts, and you made us want to play guitar', which is really amazing to hear. They're the biggest band {{in the world right}} now. And their favourite band was us! We influenced them. It's really strange, because <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> veteran!". [...] Reviews for One Direction's debut album Up All Night had credited McFly as a notable influence, and Horan stated the group were very happy to have such a comparison noted. McFly had contributed song-writing to the first three studio albums that the group released. The group's debut featured the Fletcher-penned track I Want, while the group's 2nd album Take Me Home featured the song I Would penned by Fletcher, Jones and Poynter. Deluxe editions of the album also featured Irresistible, a track penned by all 5 members of One Direction alongside Fletcher, Jones and Poynter. This track marked the first time Jones was credited as the producer of any McFly-penned song for the group, with this trait continuing for later songs. Horan has since established a professional relationship with McFly, co-writing a number of album tracks for One Direction with Fletcher, Jones and Poynter, including the song Don't Forget Where You Belong from their 3rd album Midnight Memories, having previously credited them for teaching the group songwriting techniques. Horan, Fletcher, Jones and Poynter had written three songs together for the group's 4th album, due for release in late 2014. Despite this, none of the tracks were chosen for the release, marking the first time the band were not featured on the group's songwriting credits on any studio album. However, Horan has returned to work with the band for the group's 5th studio album in 2015, penning two tracks with Fletcher and Jones which are presently in production. On 16 June 2014, Horan told the group's audience at the Parken Stadium in Denmark that McBusted supporting the group was [...] "something special" [...] because [...] "they were a lot of our favourite bands when we were growing up". One Direction have also praised McFly as role models for longevity, having stayed together as a band for over a decade. Tomlinson said [...] "Oh, they're great role models. They've been through it, so it was really nice to have the chance to talk to them about their experiences. They've been so successful because they've managed to be themselves from the start. There aren't any egos, you know? I think that's really important in a band." ...|$|E
