Experiment 2 showed that intercropping systems reduced use of N fertilizer per unit land area and increased relative biomass of intercropped maize, due to promoted photosynthetic efficiency of border rows and N utilization during symbiotic period. Intercropping advantage began to emerge at tasseling stage after N topdressing for maize. Among all treatments with different row ratios, alternating four maize rows with six soybean rows (4 M: 6 S) had the largest land equivalent ratio (1. 30), total N accumulation in crops (258 kg ha(- 1)), and economic benefit (3, 408 USD ha(- 1)). Compared to maize monoculture, 4 M: 6 S had significantly lower nitrate-N accumulation in soil both after harvest of maize and after harvest of the subsequent wheat, {{but it did not}} decrease yield of wheat. The most important advantage of 4 M: 6 S was to increase biomass of intercropped maize and soybean, which further led to the increase of total N accumulation by crops as well as economic benefit. In conclusion, alternating four maize rows with six soybean rows was the optimum row ratio in maize || soybean system, though this needs to be further confirmed by pluri-annual trials...|$|E

A growing body of empirical literature has attempted to measure the efficiency gains from M&As; however there is little sense of how the results might depend on the country, industry and time period analysed. In this paper we review critically works that cover the main sectors of the financial industry (commercial and investment banks, insurance and asset management companies) in the major industrialised countries over the last twenty years, searching for common patterns that transcend national and sectoral peculiarities.

Analyzing the features and price volatility of European markets which undertook the same process, as well as Norwey, Germany and Spain, we formulate a simple model to control the well functioning of energy spot markets in a deregulated context.

40|$|The Canadian supply managed {{dairy sector}} {{is likely to}} face more {{competitive}} pressure from challenges through the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the changing global trade environment. Therefore, it is highly prudent for Canadian dairy producers to focus their concern on their level of competitiveness and how to improve it. This study investigated the competitiveness of Ontario dairy sector based on a sample of farm level data with a Box-Cox transformed econometric cost model. The data were gathered by the Ontario Dairy Farm Accounting Project, for the years 2005, 2006, and 2007.

Estimates of a stochastic production frontier are obtained with two alternative methods; an iterative "average frontier: (AF) procedure and a maximum-likelihood composed error (CE) term method. An index of technical efficiency is calculated for every herd in the sample, with the AF method resulting in an average efficiency ratio of 85 percent, and the CE method producing an average efficiency ratio of 83 percent. Regressions of production cost on milk output, herd size, and efficiency are used to test {{for the effects of}} size <b>economies,</b> <b>yield</b> <b>economies,</b> and technical efficiency on production cost. These results suggest that herd expansion, on average, would lower the average cost of production throughout the province. Romain and Lambert use a similar method in a study of Quebec and Ontario dairy farmers which shows a limited potential to exploit economies of herd size. While not a formal test of the similarity of the two industries, {{the results of this study}} indicate a significant difference between the optimal structure of dairy production in Alberta and Quebec. Such regional differences will have important implications for the possible reapportionment of the national milk market, whether by regulatory or free-market mechanisms.

40|$|Assembly Line Balancing (ALB) {{refers to}} the problem of {{assigning}} operations to (workstations) stations along an assembly line, optimaly balance. Since Henry Ford introduce the assembly lines, ALB has been an optimization problem of significant industrial importance: the efficiency difference between an optimal and a sub-optimal assignment can <b>yield</b> <b>economies</b> (or waste) than reaching millions of dollars per year. ALB is a classic Operations Research (OR) optimization problem, having been tackled by OR over several decades. Many algorithms have been proposed for the problem. [Falkenauer E. (2005) ]. Although a Simple ALB Problem (SALBP) only takes into account two constraints (either the precedence constraints plus the cycle time, or the precedence constraints plus the number of workstations), it is by far the variant of line balancing that has been the most researched. The contribusion so that effort can be found in Falkenauer and Delchambre (1992), where they proposed a Grouping Genetic Algorithm approach that achieved some of the best performance in the field. The Grouping Genetic Algorithm technique itself was presented in detail in Falkenauer (1998). However well researched, the SALBP is hardly applicable in industry. The fact has not escaped the attention of the OR researches, and Becker and Scholl (2004) define many extensions to SALBP, yielding a common denomination GALBP (Generalized Assembly Line Balancing Problem). Each of the extensions reported in their authoritative survey aims to handle an additional difficulty present in real-world line balancing. Since the ALB problem falls into the NP-hard class of combinatorial optimization problems, numerous research efforts have been directed towards the development of computer efficient approximation algorithms or heuristics. In this context, GAs are intelligent random search mechanisms that are applied to various combinatorial optimization problems such as scheduling, TSP, and ALB. The existing studies in the literature have indicated that GA {{can be used as a}} very effective search technique in solving dificult problems because of its ability to move from one solution set to another and felexibility to incorporate the problem specific characteristics. Those aspects have been cleared in Fernando G. F (2002), also by applying the Genetic Algorithm. This chapter is organized as follows. One Section recalls the ALB Problem definitions and its classification. In another Section, some heuristic methods using for ALB problems are introduced. Last Section describes Genetic Algorithms playing for ALB problem and finally presents conclusions...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to analyse the effects of an enlargement of a common market on economic growth and incomes. The analytical framework is developed by Uwe Walz (1998). The underlying growth model draws on the work of Grossman and Helpman (1991). Growth is explained with continuous developing of new differentiated intermediate inputs in an R&D sector. The use of these intermediates <b>yields</b> <b>economies</b> of scale and further, productivity gains in final goods production. The countries’ specialisation patterns are determined together with the mentioned scale economies and agglomeration advantages and disadvantages arising from transport costs. The new country to the common market is considered to be technologically lagging compared to the initial countries. The differences in technology are of such magnitude that the entrant cannot take part in the R&D activity at all. The study of the enlargement is divided into two sequences: liberalisation of trade and liberalisation of migration. The result of removing the barriers to trade is faster economic growth and income convergence between the initial common market countries. The enhanced welfare is observed as better wages in the new member state. The specialisation patterns become less drastic, with the reallocation of resources leading to the innovating activity being more evenly distributed. In the case of labour mobilisation, faster growth is achieved with qualifications. The migration of unskilled workers to the initial common market countries slows down growth. The immigration of skilled workers in turn leads to faster growth if and only if it was used relatively less intensively in the new member country prior to the enlargement. In this case wages converge. The starting point of the study consists of the following papers: Grossman, G. M. & Helpman, E. (1991) : Innovation and Growth in the Global Economy. The MIT Press, Cambridge, Ma. USA. Walz, U. (1998) : Does an Enlargement of a Common Market Stimulate Growth and Convergence? Journal of International Economics 45, 297 – 321. Walz, U.

The main implication of the model is a nonlinear relationship between {{the rate of inflation}} and the choice of regime for the next period. The model also suggests that a major inflationary shock-like the one to which all Central and Eastern European economies were subject when they allowed prices to be determined by the market-should give rise to a tightening of the exchange rate regime, followed by a gradual introduction of more flexibility as inflation subsides.

40|$|The passive {{dynamics}} of bipedal limbs alone are sufficient {{to produce a}} walking motion, without need for control. Humans augment these dynamics with muscles, actively coordinated to produce stable and economical walking. Present robots using passive dynamics walk much slower, perhaps because they lack elastic muscles that couple the joints. Elastic properties are well known to enhance running gaits, but their effect on walking {{has yet to be}} explored. Here we use a computational model of dynamic walking to show that elastic joint coupling can help to coordinate faster walking. In walking powered by trailing leg push-off, the model's speed is normally limited by a swing leg that moves too slowly to avoid stumbling. A uni-articular spring about the knee allows faster but uneconomical walking. A combination of uni-articular hip and knee springs can speed the legs for improved speed and economy, but not without the swing foot scuffing the ground. Bi-articular springs coupling the hips and knees can <b>yield</b> high <b>economy</b> and good ground clearance similar to humans. An important parameter is the knee-to-hip moment arm that greatly affects the existence and stability of gaits, and when selected appropriately can allow {{for a wide range of}} speeds.

40|$|Within an {{internal}} model the Economic Scenario Generator (ESG) {{is an important}} component. In {{order to get a}} regulatory approval of {{an internal}} model it is required that the implemented models (must be) passed a rigorous validation process, see Ceiops [2009]. In this paper we focus on the particular problem to judge the contribution of correlations between interest rate risks across countries in the ESG. To that end we apply two strategies: an analytical and a statistical one. The analytical approach yields necessary conditions in terms of upper and lower bounds for correlations within the chosen model. A system of stochastic differential equations is used to describe several economies simultaneously. In this framework we derive a lower and upper bound of the correlation of the treasury <b>yields</b> between two <b>economies</b> by solving the associated ordinary differential inequalities. In order to deepen our understanding about the correlation structure we consider three modeling types of correlations of historical datasets. We first derive the realized correlations as outlined by Andersen et al.

We then exploit a nice relationship outlined by Andersen et al. [2003], which relates the realized correlation and conditional correlations in oder to compare the three model by their ability to capture the stylized facts of the underlying processes. In this respect the long memory of the correlation processes is of particular importance. We give a series of statistical analysis that highlight the adequacy of the model...|$|R

In all the cases aromatic aldehydes containing electron-withdrawing groups gave shorter time than that with electron-donating groups. The salient features of the present protocol are mild reaction conditions, excellent <b>yields,</b> high atom <b>economy,</b> Eco-friendliness, easy isolation of products, recyclability and reusability of the catalyst...|$|R
