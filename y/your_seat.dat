500|$|Dave Kehr gave {{a largely}} {{negative}} review; [...] "The film betrays no human impulse {{higher than that}} of a ten-year-old boy trying to gross out his baby sister by dangling a dead worm in her face." [...] Ralph Novak of People complained [...] "The ads that say 'this film may be too intense for younger children' are fraudulent. No parent should allow a young child to see this traumatizing movie; it would be a cinematic form of child abuse. Even Harrison Ford is required to slap Quan and abuse Capshaw. There are no heroes connected with the film, only two villains; their names are Steven Spielberg and George Lucas." [...] The Observer described it as [...] "a thin, arch, graceless affair."

Pro TV felt that the clip for [...] "Give Me Your Everything" [...] is very different from her previous works.

[...] Walter Goodman of The New York Times said it was a [...] "flaming, flashing, crashing, {{crackling}} blow-'em-up show that keeps you popping from <b>your</b> <b>seat</b> despite your better instincts and the basically conventional scare tactics." [...] Time magazine featured the film on the cover of its , 1986, issue, calling it the [...] "summer's scariest movie". Time reviewer Richard Schickel declared the film [...] "a sequel that exceeds its predecessor in the reach of its appeal while giving Weaver new emotional dimensions to explore." [...] The selection of Aliens for a Time cover was attributed to the successful reception of the film, as well as its novel example of a science fiction action heroine. Echoing Times assessment, Dave Kehr of The Chicago Reader called the film [...] "one sequel that surpasses the original." [...] On the negative side, Gene Siskel described Aliens as [...] "one extremely violent, protracted attack on the senses" [...] and that [...] "toward the end, the film resorts to placing a young girl in jeopardy in a pathetic attempt to pander to who knows what audience.

500|$|In 1888 Lansbury {{agreed to}} act as {{election}} agent for Jane Cobden, who was contesting the first elections for the newly formed London County Council [...] (LCC) as Liberal candidate for the Bow and Bromley division. [...] Cobden, an early supporter of women's suffrage, was the fourth child of the Victorian radical statesman Richard Cobden. [...] The Society for Promoting Women as County Councillors (SPWCC), a new women's rights group, had proposed Cobden as the [...] candidate for Bow and Bromley and Margaret Sandhurst [...] for Brixton. [...] Lansbury counselled Cobden in the issues of greatest concern to the East End electorate: housing for the poor, ending of sweated labour, rights of public assembly, {{and control of the}} police. Specific questions of women's rights were largely avoided during the campaign. [...] On 19 January 1889 both women were elected; these triumphs were, however, short-lived. Sandhurst's [...] qualification to serve as a county councillor was successfully challenged in the courts by her Conservative Party opponents on the grounds of her sex, and her subsequent appeal was dismissed. Cobden was not immediately challenged, but in April 1891, after a [...] series of legal actions, [...] she was effectively neutered as a councillor by being prevented from voting on pain of severe financial penalties. [...] Lansbury urged her, during the hearings, [...] to [...] "go to prison and let the Council back you up by refusing to declare <b>your</b> <b>seat</b> vacant". Cobden did not follow this path. A Bill introduced in the House of Commons in May 1891 permitting women to serve as county councillors found little support among [...] MPs of any party; women were not granted this right until 1907.|$|E
