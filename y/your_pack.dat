6000|$|... "Let me put the sovereigns {{in the bag}} again," [...] said Maggie; [...] "and you'll {{come and}} see us when you've bought <b>your</b> <b>pack,</b> Bob." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Make <b>your</b> <b>pack!</b> The {{police will}} arrive in a few minutes," [...] Margaret rejoined impatiently and turned her head. [...] "There is not a trail. I am going with you." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Gallilee {{was on her}} way to the breakfast-room, {{when her}} son entered the house. They met in the hall. [...] "Is <b>your</b> <b>packing</b> done?" [...] she asked.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{come along}} to Tranquil Vale," [...] said Captain Trimblett, with forced joviality. [...] "Never mind about <b>your</b> <b>packing.</b> Stay to supper, and I’ll see you home afterward." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You did? Good! Good!" [...] cried Colonel Zane, heartily. [...] "By George, that's great! Tell me--but {{wait until}} you are more comfortable. <b>Your</b> <b>packs</b> came safely on Jeff's raft, {{and you will find}} them inside." ...|$|R
60|$|Sabina Silver. [To CHARLIE WARD.] Will {{you make}} him swear it? Haven't {{you a little}} book in <b>your</b> <b>pack?</b> Bring it out and make him swear to me on it, and you'll be my witness.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, shore! I reckon I understand," [...] replied Colter. [...] "I {{hated to}} tell y'u. But y'u had to heah the truth aboot that half-breed.... I'll carry <b>your</b> <b>pack</b> {{in the cabin}} an' unroll your blankets." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{heard me}} {{breaking}} my shins on that infernal flower-pot you put for me, and out you shot with all <b>your</b> <b>pack</b> of old women and chased me round the garden. What {{do you mean}} by it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's my Shawnee guide, Tomepomehala. He's a good fellow, {{although}} Jonathan and Wetzel {{declare the}} only good Indian is a dead one. Come right in here. There are <b>your</b> <b>packs,</b> and you'll find water outside the door." ...|$|R
60|$|MILLIKEN.--Hold your scurrilous tongues sir! My good nature ruins {{everybody}} about me. Make up <b>your</b> accounts. <b>Pack</b> <b>your</b> trunks--and {{never let}} me see your face again.|$|R
6000|$|... "Finish <b>your</b> <b>packing,</b> ladies. We {{will start}} at daybreak {{tomorrow}} morning. I secured three boats, four days ago, and have been holding them in readiness. Rajbullub will go in charge of you. There is not the least fear of Tippoo being here for another fortnight, at the earliest.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh no; {{our backs}} are {{not strong enough}} to bear your weight," [...] said Flossie, decidedly. [...] "But if you had a sledge, and could harness us to it, we might draw you easily, and <b>your</b> <b>pack</b> as well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “What Mrs. Effingham {{tells you}} is true, Leather-Stocking’ said Edwards; “there {{can be no}} {{necessity}} for your submitting to such hardships now. So throw aside <b>your</b> <b>pack,</b> and confine your hunt to the mountains near us, if you will go.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Besides," [...] added Peterkin, [...] "we {{were anxious}} {{to get back in}} time for your elephant-hunt, else we should have brought more meat with us. But Jack has not {{mentioned}} what I consider our chief prize, the honour of shooting which belongs to my friend Ralph Rover.--Come, Ralph, unfasten <b>your</b> <b>pack</b> and let them see it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If you {{be coming}} back at sunset, white man, why do you carry so many things upon <b>your</b> <b>packs,</b> and why are your saddle-bags filled with cartridges?" [...] he asked. [...] "Surely you do not speak the truth to me, and you hope that never more will you see the sun set upon Bambatse." ...|$|R
50|$|PPNF began <b>Pack</b> <b>Your</b> Trash. In the 1970s <b>Pack</b> <b>Your</b> Trash Day's {{began as}} one of the first beach clean ups in {{response}} to visitors who had not learned to respect the ocean environment.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, then, Le Roux," [...] said Mackenzie, {{turning to}} his clerk, [...] "here you and I shall part. This seems {{a good spot}} and a good {{opportunity}} for opening up the trade with these Indians. When {{the rest of them}} arrive we shall have a palaver, and then you shall remain to look after them, so, open up <b>your</b> <b>packs,</b> and get ready a few small presents without delay." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I ain't {{going to}} have any of this dam sentimental {{nonsense}} and humbug here, sir," [...] the father cried out. [...] "There shall be no beggar-marriages in my family. If you choose to fling away eight thousand a year, which you may have for the asking, you may do it: but by Jove you take <b>your</b> <b>pack</b> and walk out of this house, sir. Will you do as I tell you, once for all, sir, or will you not?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No. Comforts of {{any kind}} are remarkably scarce up yonder. As a matter of fact, I can't imagine {{a country where the}} {{contrasts}} between the luxuries of civilization and--the other thing--are sharper. You can step off a first-class car into the wilderness, where no amount of money can buy you better fare than pork, potatoes and dried apples; {{and if you want to}} travel you must shoulder <b>your</b> <b>pack</b> and walk. But that wasn't exactly what I meant." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I will order a four-wheeler. In {{a quarter}} of an hour, we shall be at your service. If you are {{telegraphing}} home, Mr. Huxtable, it would be well to allow the people in your neighbourhood to imagine that the inquiry is still going on in Liverpool, or wherever else that red herring led <b>your</b> <b>pack.</b> In the meantime I will do a little quiet work at your own doors, and perhaps the scent is not so cold but that two old hounds like Watson and myself may get a sniff of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! I know that" [...] {{interrupted}} Paul, [...] "and have {{no intention}} of smashing up my cart in the woods. We shall go round by the plains, lad. It is somewhat longer, no doubt, but once away, we shall be able to laugh at men on foot if they are so foolish as to follow us. Come now, Betty, stir your stumps and finish <b>your</b> <b>packing.</b> I'll go get the--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let me assure you, master," [...] she {{continued}} with relentless severity, [...] "that you were wise an you returned straightway to <b>your</b> lodgings now ... <b>packed</b> <b>your</b> worldly goods and betook yourself and them to anywhere you please." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think it}} hardly worth while {{for you to}} give {{yourself}} that trouble," [...] said Demorest quietly, looking in Mrs. Van Loo's smiling eyes, [...] "now that I know {{the story of the}} young lady's death was a forgery. And I will not intrude further on your time. Pray give yourself no needless hurry over <b>your</b> <b>packing.</b> I may go to San Francisco this afternoon, and not even require the rooms to-night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Marry, {{these are}} {{questions}} I cannot answer," [...] replied the host. [...] "But look you, sir, you have {{brought me a}} token from worthy Master Tressilian--a pretty stone it is." [...] He took out the ring, and looked at it, adding, {{as he put it}} into his purse again, that it was too rich a guerdon for anything he could do for the worthy donor. He was, he said, in the public line, and it ill became him to be too inquisitive into other folk's concerns. He had already said that he could hear nothing but that the lady lived still at Cumnor Place in the closest seclusion, and, to such as by chance had a view of her, seemed pensive and discontented with her solitude. [...] "But here," [...] he said, [...] "if you are desirous to gratify your master, is the rarest chance that hath occurred for this many a day. Tony Foster is coming down hither, and it is but letting Mike Lambourne smell another wine-flask, and the Queen's command would not move him from the ale-bench. So they are fast for an hour or so. Now, if you will don <b>your</b> <b>pack,</b> which will be your best excuse, you may, perchance, win the ear of the old servant, being assured of the master's absence, to let you try to get some custom of the lady; and then you may learn more of her condition than I or any other can tell you." ...|$|E
50|$|Step up {{and march}} away;Keep on smiling all the day;Shoulder your rifle and hitch <b>your</b> <b>pack</b> up tight,Take {{the right of}} the line and fight.|$|E

50|$|An {{alternative}} is to program the checkweigher to check bands of different weight tolerances. For instance, the total valid weight is 100 grams ±15 grams. This means that the product can weigh 85 g - 115 g. However, {{it is obvious that}} if you are producing 10,000 packs a day, and most of <b>your</b> <b>packs</b> are 110 g, you are losing 100 kg of product. If you try to run closer to 85 g, you may have a high rejection rate.|$|R
50|$|The ski {{approach}} to the hut can take anywhere from 3-7 hours, depending on whether you are breaking trail, the weight of <b>your</b> <b>pack</b> and what type of skis you use. Do not underestimate this approach; {{you are in the}} backcountry and there are 3 or 4 large avalanche paths across the road. While avalanches rarely hit the road, you should find out the current avalanche forecast, cross the avalanche paths one at a time, and do not stop while in the avalanche tracks.|$|E
5000|$|Hikers {{unfamiliar}} with the range should know {{that only a few}} of its hikes are [...] "easy". The terrain, especially in the south is very steep and trails are not always kept clear. If you leave the trail and start scaling the rocks you will find out quickly that 1.5-billion-year-old mudstone is very brittle and not a very reliable handhold. Climb around with caution. In the daytime it can be very hot, but nights are very cold, so pack accordingly. Though the Missions aren't huge, it is always a good idea to bring a map. The USGS topographic maps of the area are available at local sporting goods stores and not a bad thing to have in <b>your</b> <b>pack.</b>|$|E
50|$|Though {{he is in}} London, {{his spirit}} wanders about his home fields (LII). From the grave the suicide's ghost visits the beloved (LIII), a theme {{apparently}} derived from a traditional ballad of the unquiet grave type. Those he loved are dead, and other youths eternally re-live his own experiences (LV). Like the lad that becomes a soldier, one can choose to face death young rather than put it off out of cowardice (LVI). Dick is in the graveyard, and Ned is long in jail, when he returns by himself to Ludlow (LVIII). Take <b>your</b> <b>pack</b> and go: death will be a journey into eternal night (LX). It matters not if he sleeps among the suicides, or among those who died well - they were all his friends (LXI). Some mock his melancholy thoughts but he has used them like the poisons sampled by Mithridates and will survive to die old (LXII). Perhaps these poems are not fashionable, but they survive the poet to please other lads like him (LXIII).|$|E
5000|$|In a nationally-televised {{speech on}} April 9, 2006, Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez {{threatened}} to expel Brownfield for “provoking the Venezuelan people.” Chávez said “Start <b>packing</b> <b>your</b> bags, mister - {{if you keep}} on provoking us, start <b>packing</b> <b>your</b> bags, because I’ll kick you out of here.” ...|$|R
