Beadle was told to liaise with Lardner-Burke regarding any proposals Smith's government might have. Beadle would later recount that the post-UDI government briefly threatened him, telling him to [...] "go now, otherwise <b>you</b> <b>lose</b> <b>your</b> job", but he was ultimately left alone. The Chief Justice noted in his diary that Smith's government was [...] "not prepared to force [...] showdown with the judges".|$|E
500|$|Glee {{choreographer}} Zach Woodlee described [...] "Proud Mary" [...] as the [...] "scariest" [...] number produced to date, citing {{concerns with}} choreographing an entire routine in wheelchairs and problems building the correct staging. Woodlee explained the stage ramps were initially built too steeply, preventing the actors from ascending them in wheelchairs, {{and that the}} actors experienced problems learning to distribute their weight correctly, flipping the wheelchairs over backwards: [...] "It was like roller derby. All of the actors would fall backwards and hit their heads—particularly Lea Michele. <b>You</b> <b>lose</b> <b>your</b> balance really quick {{when you try to}} go up a ramp in a wheelchair. Amber Riley caught an edge going down a ramp and fell off completely. There were pile-ups; there were crashes. Basically, everything that could go wrong, did." [...] Murphy specified to Woodlee that cast members should not be able to leave their wheelchairs during the number, as: [...] "Artie doesn't get to get up ever, so I didn't want anyone to get up." [...] Woodlee agreed: [...] "If it looked too fun and easy, it wouldn't read right. Ryan really wanted people to understand what Artie deals with." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} {{for the song}} was {{directed}} by Honey and it was shot on April 6 and April 7, 2010, in the Lancaster, California desert. It premiered on Vevo at 12:01a.m. on May 13, 2010. Kesha described the concept behind the video {{in an interview with}} MTV, stating, [...] "I wanted it to be like a psychedelic trip of the mind, comparable with being so disgustingly in love with someone that <b>you</b> <b>lose</b> <b>your</b> head." [...] She chose to also incorporate an animal aspect to the video explaining that she was [...] "a huge animal lover". Kesha elaborated on the experience, [...] "I also ride an elephant — no big deal! — and, um, I dance around a cave with black-light body paint and a python. I was in a cave, in the desert, and it was really fun." [...] When asked about the inspiration for the video, she said [...] "This video was inspired by the Beatles' Yellow Submarine movie, the animation aspect. There's a little bit of [...] in there too". Her love interest in the clip was portrayed by Marc-Edouard Leon, a member of the directing team Skinny.|$|E

5000|$|There is {{a common}} motif in Russian folk tales, where a vityaz (Russian knight) comes to {{a fork in the}} road and sees a menhir with an {{inscription}} that reads: [...] "If you ride to the left, <b>you</b> will <b>lose</b> <b>your</b> horse, if <b>you</b> ride to the right, <b>you</b> will <b>lose</b> <b>your</b> head".|$|R
2500|$|When <b>you</b> <b>lose</b> <b>your</b> {{confidence}} {{you don't}} want to bowl again. When I {{went on the}} West Indies tour I had no confidence, even though I got 17 wickets {{at an average of}} about 25, and 10 of them were in first-class games. I only bowled about 78 overs on tour. When <b>you</b> <b>lose</b> <b>your</b> confidence it's not a nice feeling – you can't do what you used to do, but I'm only sorry it was the wrong day at the wrong time , because if I was myself, I assure you, in my opinion, I would have played more Test cricket, but that's only my assumption. I appreciated the experience , but after three months with no confidence [...] I was pleased to get back home.|$|E
