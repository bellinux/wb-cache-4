If <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> directly rubbing up against the government, they wanted it more solid than it could probably ever be done.|$|E
2500|$|Tipton {{was never}} {{formally}} {{married in a}} ceremony, but several women had drivers' licenses identifying them as Mrs. Tipton. In 1960, Tipton ended his relationship with Cox to settle down with nightclub dancer and stripper Kitty Kelly (later known as Kitty Oakes), who was known professionally as [...] "The Irish Venus". They were involved with their local PTA and with the Boy Scouts. They adopted three sons, John, Scott, and William. After Tipton's death, Kitty gave several interviews about him and their relationship. In early interviews, she said, [...] "He gave up everything... There were certain rules and regulations in those days if <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a musician," [...] in reference to breaking into the 1920−30s music industry. William described Tipton as a good father who loved to go on Scout camping trips.|$|E
2500|$|That same day, Wurzelbacher also {{appeared}} on Good Morning America. Diane Sawyer {{asked him if}} he was taking home $250,000 now, Wurzelbacher said with a laugh [...] "No, not even close." [...] Sawyer asked Wurzelbacher, [...] "And the McCain camp, some people have said did they contact you and tell you that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a major part of this, and had they contacted you before that encounter with Senator Obama?" [...] Wurzelbacher answered, [...] "Oh no, no, no one's contacted me as far as if I {{was going to be on}} the debate or as far as my name being used. No. I have been contacted by them and asked to show up at a rally. But, other than that, no. I just happened to be here and Barack Obama happened to show up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] said Bernard, laughing, [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> coarse and flattering, I collapse. If <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> titillate my vanity, I succumb." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Poff," [...] {{she said}} suddenly, [...] "has it ever {{occurred}} <b>to</b> <b>you</b> what <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do afterwards. Do <b>you</b> know <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> quite well off?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Likely enough. 'Gad! the {{performance}} <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> commence," [...] Arthur exclaimed, quickly. [...] "Paul, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{have a new}} sensation. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> see {{the most beautiful woman}} in the world." ...|$|R
60|$|MRS HUSHABYE. Splendid! Oh, what a relief! I thought <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> broken-hearted. Never mind me. Damn him again.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Sounds as if <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{executed}} {{instead of}} married. THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL!' repeated the brother-in-law, with most killing emphasis.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't {{know why}} he danced; but if I had known <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> so silent, I would have {{explained}} the mistake myself.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The man {{is growing}} {{stronger}} and better every day. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> make him recover, after all. I was afraid"--he corrected himself--"I thought"--the word <b>was</b> the truer--"that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> poison him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{quite know}} what <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> say," [...] {{retorted}} Peter hotly. [...] "I can see it by your chin. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> take their part--and suggest their acting undutifully towards their parents." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are going," [...] Pritchard replied, [...] "on {{an errand}} of chivalry. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> become once more a rescuer of woman in distress. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{save the life}} of your {{beautiful}} friend Elizabeth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Max!--don't kill me, Max! It was laudanum--indeed it was. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> married, and I was furious, and I {{went and}} got--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, no. Beastly rough luck {{having to}} leave Wrykyn just when <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> captain, and come to a small school like this." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come {{nearer to}} me, dearest. It {{would not make}} you unhappy to think that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{the wife of a}} man you could love?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> allow yourself, then, to be {{the prey}} of these morbid fancies? <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> treat this {{creature}} {{as a human being}} of your own order? <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> let him work upon your imagination?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know what}} <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> say. Well, {{perhaps it is}} rash. But when <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> foreign courts, what <b>are</b> <b>you</b> to do? If you have got those sort of things you must wear them." ...|$|R
5000|$|The main {{character}} team are The Mates. While there are parallels with The Beatles and each {{character is a}} pastiche of a superhero, Tischman insisted the concept was much broader than that: [...] "The persona of the Mates is an iconic one for both superhero teams and rock bands. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> always <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have the really cute one. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have the quiet one. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have the spiritual one and <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have the goofy one. That’s the case from every group from Justice League to 'N Sync" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Brent will amuse you," [...] he replied. [...] "I didn't know <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> home, and I've promised these men. I'll {{come back}} early." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I didn't know <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> married, Dick,' said Lady Kelsey, {{inclined}} {{to be a little}} hurt because nothing had been said to her of this.|$|E
6000|$|... "But I don't understand," [...] said my mother; [...] "you told me {{when you}} came to me that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> married in a few weeks." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I mean <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{tell the}} truth as you have just told it," [...] replied Fisher. [...] "You <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> placard this town with the wickedness done <b>to</b> old Wilkins. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> fill the {{newspapers}} with the infamous story of Mrs. Biddle. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> denounce Verner from a public platform, naming {{him for what he}} did and naming the poacher he did it <b>to.</b> And you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> find out by what trade this man made the money with which he bought the estate; and when you know the truth, as I said before, of course <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> tell it. Upon those terms I come under the old flag, as you call it, and haul down my little pennon." ...|$|R
50|$|Groucho: <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{convicted of}} murder.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not now," [...] she {{interrupted}} hastily. [...] "Do you know, I fancy {{that we must}} {{be getting}} too confidential. That odious man with the eyeglass keeps staring at us. Tell me what <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do when <b>you</b> leave here. You can ask me--what <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to,</b> afterwards." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Did {{you think}} <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> drowned, dear?" [...] said Mr Webster {{with the air}} of a man who does not know very well what to say.|$|E
6000|$|... "You are Mr. Romilly, aren't you?" [...] {{one of them}} asked. [...] "Bob Millet told us <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> on this steamer. You know Bob, don't you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{looks to}} me," [...] said Sam, [...] "as if I had been mistaken in {{thinking}} that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a ray of sunshine on the voyage." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'When <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> settle {{yourself}} in some Christian sort of place, Liz? I thought <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{do it before}} now.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Anyhow," [...] he went on, {{speaking}} with decision, [...] "so {{long as you}} feel like that, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have a new gown--or two--and a new hat, and <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have them at once. They <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> bought with your brother's money, mind. Shall I come shopping with you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Luke, old friend," [...] Ned said earnestly, {{putting his}} hand on the cropper's shoulder, [...] "don't be angry with Polly, she has done me a great service. I have learned the truth, and know what you meant now by a life for a life. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{sacrifice}} yourself for me. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> take upon yourself a crime which you never committed to clear me. You went to York to declare yourself the murderer of Mulready, in case I had <b>been</b> found guilty. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> emigrate to America to send home a written confession." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{my belief}} and opinion, honest gentleman," [...] said the corporal, [...] "that if <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> hanged yourself, {{you would be}} in no such d--d hurry." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, no," [...] said Oliver, [...] "only I thought that, on the whole, I'd {{rather go}} with you. I didn't think that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> gone so long." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, {{then you}} are Gethryn? That's all right. I was told <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> here to meet this train. Glad to make your acquaintance. My name's Farnie. I'm your uncle, you know.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And now, {{will you}} {{let me know what}} <b>you</b> <b>are</b> {{thinking}} of doing? I told the general what service you had rendered me, and he asked me what <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do. I told him that, as yet, I did not know whether <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> stay here, or go back again." ...|$|R
