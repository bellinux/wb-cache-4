[...] the notion that some radical Islamic group in America would make a threat, even a veiled one, against two men's lives because of it is chilling." [...] Fox News commentator Bill O'Reilly {{said he would have}} advised Parker and Stone not to do the episode out of fear of retaliation: [...] "On the one hand <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> admire their courage. But I don't know whether the risk–reward [...] is worth it." [...] The Daily Telegraph writer Douglas Murray said the entry only gave [...] "200" [...] more legitimacy, writing, [...] " [...] of course just confirms the point that the South Park boys were making. [...] I'd have said that was point proved. South Park 1: Islamists 0." [...] On the April 22, 2010, episode of Comedy Central's The Daily Show, host Jon Stewart went into a ten-minute tirade about the alleged death threats, expressing disgust at the alleged hypocrisy of Revolution Muslim's speech while its members enjoy the American lifestyle and freedom of speech.|$|E
500|$|The Real Housewives of Atlanta {{has been}} {{moderately}} well received by critics. Writing for Common Sense Media, Melissa Camacho spoke favorably of the series' emphasis on [...] "a successful and powerful {{segment of the}} African-American community" [...] {{that appears to be}} frequently neglected by the popular television. Tim Hall from the Seattle Post-Intelligencer commented of his general distaste for reality television, particularly describing The Real Housewives of Orange County as [...] "utterly ridiculous". However, he admitted that the dynamic and conflict between the women, in addition to the wealthy lifestyles they led, to be [...] "somewhat entertaining". In a more mixed review, Alessandra Stanley from The New York Times joked that its portrayal of wealth served as [...] "the best choice for a time capsule of the Bling Decade" [...] when noting the economic downturn the United States experienced around the time that the series premiered, although more seriously stated that the housewives' luxuries [...] "was never all that enviable, and now it looks as if it might not be viable." [...] Hanh Nguyen from Zap2It shared a similar sentiment, criticizing that the [...] "showy elite and rampant consumerism" [...] that the women regularly display [...] "seems rather out of touch" [...] given the United States' economic hardship, although she elaborated that the program [...] " [...] not by any means boring, but <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be in the mood to watch." ...|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{this early}} interest, most {{scientists}} ignored Stevenson's work. According to his New York Times obituary, his detractors {{saw him as}} [...] "earnest, dogged but ultimately misguided, led astray by gullibility, wishful thinking and a tendency to see science where others saw superstition." [...] Critics suggested that the children or their parents had deceived him, {{that he was too}} willing to believe them, and that he had asked them leading questions. In addition, critics said, the results were subject to confirmation bias, in that cases not supportive of the hypothesis were not presented as counting against it. Leonard Angel, a philosopher of religion, told The New York Times that Stevenson did not follow proper standards.

After appearing on the show for three years, James decided to quit and the character was killed off. She stated, [...] "It {{took me a long}} time to decide to leave Shortland Street because it isn't easy to walk away from something you love. I also had this fear I'd never get work again – it's a real fear. So it {{took me a long time}} to wrestle with the idea that saying no to work wasn't unwise, and that if you actually want to grow and develop as an actor <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> stop and move on."
