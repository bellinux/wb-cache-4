Norwood revealed that Mercy is shocked by the proposal, adding [...] "Mercy thinks he's lost his marbles, but soon comes round to the idea. Fatboy reckons that this isn't about his feelings, it's all about keeping her in the UK. Of course, he's also hoping that if she stays, maybe she'll end up liking him {{in the way he}} likes her. [...] <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> a lot of trouble for , ut all Fatboy can think is, 'How can I save Mercy?' She's the girl he loves." [...] Although Fatboy is in love with Mercy, he does not believe that Mercy sees him as more than a friend and may call off the wedding if he tells her. He does not think of the consequences, such as imprisonment. Norwood revealed that Fatboy has known Mercy since they were nine years old and he had feelings for her when EastEnders: E20 started, as he was upset when she got pregnant by someone else. He said that Fatboy would be heartbroken when Mercy leaves. Norwood told Inside Soap that the wedding creates more problems for the characters, rather than solving all their problems. The fact that they try so hard to prove they are genuine makes it [...] "very hard for them to be friends." [...] The wedding episode sees Fatboy have a dream come true, {{but at the same time}} it is a nightmare for him. Knowing the wedding is a sham he is [...] "waiting for that monster to appear". Ashley turns up and is annoyed that Fatboy has kept the wedding a secret, and of this, Norwood stated: [...] "When [...] finds out what has happened he is pretty shocked. He tries to make Fatboy see the consequences of his actions, but Fatboy doesn't want to hear it—his dad has already betrayed him when it comes to Mercy." [...] Mercy is shocked to learn that Fatboy did not tell her that Ashley reported her. Although Norwood concluded that Fatboy [...] "will go to the ends of the earth to make this marriage work".|$|E

[...] "I wonder <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> these things," [...] I whispered, for the place depressed me; and he answered, with similar caution, that he couldn't. [...] "I keep them lying about," [...] he said, confidentially; [...] "but after I think nobody is likely to call I put on an old pair of English ones." [...] At this point the housekeeper knocked at the door, and Scrymgeour sprang like an acrobat into a Japanese dressing-gown before he cried [...] "Come in!"

6000|$|It {{became the}} colonel's {{pleasure}} {{to develop and}} exemplify this idea at all points of their progress through Germany. They were going to Italy, and as Mrs. Kenton {{had had enough of}} the sea in coming to Europe, they were going to Italy by the only all-rail route then existing,--from Paris to Vienna, and so down through the Simmering to Trieste and Venice. Wherever they stopped, whatever they did before reaching Vienna, Colonel Kenton chose to preserve his guarded attitude. [...] "Ah, they pretend this is Stuttgart, do they?" [...] he said on arriving at the Suabian capital. [...] "A likely story! They pretended that was the Black Forest, you know, Bessie." [...] At Munich, [...] "And this is Munich!" [...] he sneered, whenever the conversation flagged during their sojourn. [...] "It's outrageous, the way they let these swindling little towns palm themselves off upon the traveller for cities he's heard of. This place will be calling itself Berlin, next." [...] When his wife, guide-book in hand, was struggling to heat her admiration at some cold history of Kaulbach, and in her failure clinging fondly to the fact that Kaulbach had painted it, [...] "Kaulbach!" [...] the colonel would exclaim, and half close his eyes and slowly nod his head and smile. [...] "What guide-book is that you've got, Bessie?" [...] looking curiously at the volume he knew so well. [...] "Oh!--Baedeker! And are you going to let a Black Forest Dutchman like Baedeker persuade you that this daub is by Kaulbach? Come! That's a little too much!" [...] He rejected the birthplaces of famous persons one and all; they could not drive through a street or into a park, whose claims to be this or that street or park he did not boldly dispute; and he visited a pitiless incredulity upon the dishes of the table d'hôte, concerning which he always answered his wife's questions: [...] "Oh, he says it's beef," [...] or veal, or fowl, as the case might be; and though he never failed to relish his own dinner, strange fears began to affect the appetite of Mrs. Kenton. It happened that he never did come out with these sneers before other travellers, but his wife was always expecting him to do so, and afterwards portrayed herself as ready to scream, the whole time. She was not a nervous person, and regarding the colonel's jokes as part of the matrimonial contract, she usually bore them, as I have hinted, with severe composure; accepting them all, good, bad, and indifferent, as something in the nature of man which she should understand better after they had been married longer. The present journey was made just after the close of the war; they had seen very little of each other {{while he was in the}} army, and it had something of the fresh interest of a bridal tour. But they sojourned only a day or two in the places between Strasburg and Vienna; it was very cold and very unpleasant getting about, and they instinctively felt what every wise traveller knows, that it is folly to be lingering in Germany when <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> Italy; and so they hurried on.|$|E

6000|$|Mr. Birrell, M.P., Chief-Secretary for Ireland, in {{introducing}} [...] Mr. Clemens said: [...] "We all love Mark Twain, {{and we are}} here to [...] tell him so. One more point--all the world knows it, and that [...] is why it is dangerous to omit it--our guest is a distinguished [...] citizen of the Great Republic beyond the seas. In America his [...] 'Huckleberry Finn' and his 'Tom Sawyer' are what 'Robinson [...] Crusoe' and 'Tom Brown's School Days' have been to us. They [...] are racy of the soil. They are books to which it is impossible [...] to place any period of termination. I will not speak of the [...] classics--reminiscences of much evil in our early lives. We do [...] not meet here to-day as critics with our appreciations and [...] depreciations, our twopenny little prefaces or our forewords. [...] I am not going to say what the world a thousand years hence [...] will think of Mark Twain. Posterity will take care of itself, [...] will read what it wants to read, will forget what it chooses to [...] forget, and will pay no attention whatsoever to our critical [...] mumblings and jumblings. Let us therefore be content to say to [...] our friend and guest that we are here speaking for ourselves [...] and for our children, to say what he has been to us. I [...] remember in Liverpool, in 1867, first buying the copy, which I [...] still preserve, of the celebrated 'Jumping Frog.' It had a few [...] words of preface which reminded me then that our guest in those [...] days was called 'the wild humorist of the Pacific slope,' and a [...] few lines later down, 'the moralist of the Main.' That was [...] some forty years ago. Here he is, still the humorist, still [...] the moralist. His humor enlivens and enlightens his morality, [...] and his morality is all the better for his humor. That is one [...] of the reasons why we love him. I am not here to mention any [...] book of his--that is a subject of dispute in my family circle, [...] which is the best and which is the next best--but I must put in [...] a word, lest I should not be true to myself--a terrible thing [...] --for his Joan of Arc, a book of chivalry, of nobility, and of [...] manly sincerity for which I take this opportunity of thanking [...] him. But you can all drink this toast, each one of you with [...] his own intention. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> it what meaning you like. [...] Mark Twain is a man whom English and Americans do well to [...] honor. He is the true consolidator of nations. His delightful [...] humor is of the kind which dissipates and destroys national [...] prejudices. His truth and his honor, his love of truth, and [...] his love of honor, overflow all boundaries. He has made the [...] world better by his presence. We rejoice to see him here. [...] Long may he live to reap the plentiful harvest of hearty, [...] honest human affection!" ...|$|E
60|$|The most unhappy {{of all men}} is the {{man that}} cannot tell what {{he is going to}} do, that has got no work cut out for him in the world, and does not go into it. For work is the grand cure of all the {{maladies}} and miseries that ever beset mankind--honest work, which you intend getting done. If you are in a strait, a very good indication as to choice--perhaps the best you could get--is a book you have a great curiosity about. You are then in the readiest and best of all possible conditions to improve by that book. It is analogous to what doctors tell us about the physical health and appetites of the patient. You must learn to distinguish between false appetite and real. There {{is such a thing as}} a false appetite, which will lead a man into vagaries with regard to diet, will tempt him to eat spicy things which he should not eat at all, and would not but that it is toothsome, and for the moment in baseness of mind. A man ought to inquire and find out what he really and truly has an appetite for--what suits his constitution; and that, doctors tell him, is the very thing he ought to have in general. And so with books. As applicable to almost all of you, I will say that it is highly expedient to go into history--to inquire into what has passed before you in the families of men. The history of the Romans and Greeks will first of all concern you; and you will find that all the knowledge you have got will be extremely applicable to elucidate that. There you have the most remarkable race of men in the world set before you, to say nothing of the languages, which your professors can better explain, and which, I believe, are admitted to be the most perfect orders of speech we have yet found to exist among men. And you will find, if you read well, a pair of extremely remarkable nations shining in the records left by themselves as a kind of pillar to light up life in the darkness of the past ages; and it will be well worth your while if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> the understanding of what these people were and what they did. You will find a great deal of hearsay, as I have found, that does not touch on the matter; but perhaps some of you will get to see a Roman face to face; you will know in some measure how they contrived to exist, and to perform these feats in the world; I believe, also, you will find a thing not much noted, that there was a very great deal of deep religion in its form in both nations. That is noted by the wisest of historians, and particularly by Ferguson, who is particularly well worth reading on Roman history; and I believe he was an alumnus in our own University. His book is a very creditable book. He points out the profoundly religious nature of the Roman people, notwithstanding the wildness and ferociousness of their nature. They believed that Jupiter Optimus--Jupiter Maximus--was lord of the universe, and that he had appointed the Romans to become the chief of men, provided they followed his commands--to brave all difficulty, and to stand up with an invincible front--to be ready to do and die; and also to have the same sacred regard to veracity, to promise, to integrity, and all the virtues that surround that noblest quality of men--courage--to which the Romans gave the name of virtue, manhood, as the one thing ennobling for a man.|$|E
