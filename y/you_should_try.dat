2500|$|... “The Left {{as it is}} {{at present}} is {{certainly}} not going to come to power. There is not even a ghost of a chance of that. We {{will continue to be a}} part of the Opposition. If you want to achieve the objective that you have declared, then <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>try</b> to adopt tactics that would avoid or minimise the division of anti-BJP votes to the extent possible. This strategy should be adopted in all states other than in those states where the BJP is still not a major factor at all, where we would continue to have our main conflict with the Congress." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "There isn't the {{slightest}} danger, father, dear. Don't be silly. If I were <b>you,</b> I <b>should</b> <b>try</b> {{to get a}} good sleep. You must be tired after this morning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>try</b> {{what your}} credit {{with them is}} worth," [...] said Broughton. [...] "It isn't worth much here, as you can perceive. Ha, ha, ha!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'But <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>try</b> to bear it, {{if he is}} {{a little}} cross and tiresome. You know he is not at all well yet, and all this has quite knocked him up.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{and what}} music that was; I never heard any with such {{imagination}} before. You have a turn that way, Angela; <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>try</b> {{to put it}} into words, it would make a poem." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>You</b> <b>should</b> never <b>try</b> to {{understand}} women. Women are pictures, men are problems. If {{you want to}} know what a woman really means--which, by the way, is always a dangerous thing to do--look at her, don't listen to her.|$|R
60|$|LORD ILLINGWORTH. <b>You</b> <b>should</b> never <b>try</b> to {{understand}} them. Women are pictures. Men are problems. If {{you want to}} know what a woman really means - which, by the way, is always a dangerous thing to do - look at her, don't listen to her.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{seems to}} be a good idea," [...] said Mrs. Mitchell thoughtfully, [...] "and I am willing that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>try.</b> But have you thought it all out carefully? There will be many difficulties." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, we {{are also}} under the spell," [...] he declared, [...] "but I {{think that we are}} here mainly because it is cheap. It is really cheap, you know. To {{appreciate}} it <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>try</b> rooms." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can {{understand}} your fire-eating manners as being natural to you," [...] Sheldon went on wearily, [...] "but why <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>try</b> them on me is what I can't comprehend. You surely don't want to quarrel with me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] {{said the}} doctor, [...] "you must not {{misunderstand}} me. I only {{said that the}} new commandant had ordered that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> be <b>tried</b> by court-martial, {{but that is a}} very different thing from its being done. We must get you out of prison to-night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He is too sober-minded for our flights," [...] said Margaret. [...] "I {{know the}} feeling of it, Ethel dear; but you know if he did see that some of your plans might not answer, it is no reason <b>you</b> <b>should</b> not <b>try</b> to do {{something}} at once. You have not {{told me about the}} girl." ...|$|R
5000|$|The secret {{you have}} told me {{is not exactly a}} secret as Edwin (Booth's brother) was told by someone, you were paying great {{attention}} to a young lady in Washington, and if the lady in question is all you desire- I see no cause why <b>you</b> <b>should</b> not <b>try</b> to secure her. ... Her father ... would he give his consent? ...|$|R

[...] David Hoyle, 2006 ...|$|R
60|$|And {{inverted}} commas are so inhospitable. If {{you must take}} in another man's offspring, <b>you</b> <b>should</b> surely <b>try</b> to make the poor foundlings feel at home. Away with such uncharitable distinctions between {{the children of the}} house and the stranger within your gates. I never see {{inverted commas}} but I think of the necessary persecuted mediæval Jew in yellow gabardine.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah! poor lad, I suppose {{your feet}} has got spread with wearing those old ones; but <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>try</b> to use {{yourself}} to decent ones, or you'll soon be barefoot; and I {{do think it}} was a pity to drink them up.' ...|$|E
60|$|ADAM. You should not. You {{are always}} spying on me. I {{can never be}} alone. You always {{want to know what}} I have been doing. It is a burden. <b>You</b> <b>should</b> <b>try</b> to have an {{existence}} of your own, instead of occupying yourself with my existence.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is quite}} natural," [...] Draconmeyer assured her soothingly. [...] "What <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>try</b> {{to do is}} to forget the whole circumstance.

6000|$|... "And why <b>should</b> <b>you</b> want {{to spite}} her? If she is Mary's child, she is your brother's child also. If {{she is my}} niece, she must be your niece too.

6000|$|... 'Well, you {{cannot be}} too {{cautious}} {{if you are}} to stand well with the family. You do well {{to be on your}} guard. Martindale only the second son, and the elder may marry any day.

6000|$|... "But why <b>should</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> to make {{my cousin}} angry; you that ought {{to have so much}} sense? Don't you {{remember}} what you were saying yourself the other day, of the absurdity of combatting pretences which the world sanctions?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There are {{distinct}} fragments," [...] Laura continued, [...] "of embroidered stuff {{such as the}} Salvation Army girl might have been wearing.

6000|$|... "Which you, doubtless, {{were born}} to remedy," [...] said Mr. Pringle, {{laughing}} outright. [...] "Well, well, go on; but take my advice, and never put any of your travesties on paper.

6000|$|... 'You {{do wrong}} not to fill your glass,' said Mr Chester, {{holding up his}} own before the light. 'Wine in moderation--not in excess, for that makes men ugly--has a {{thousand}} pleasant influences. It brightens the eye, improves the voice, imparts a new vivacity to one's thoughts and conversation: <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>try</b> it, Ned.' ...|$|E
5000|$|Chief Paralympic Organiser Koh Kwi-nam {{addressed}} the athletes by saying [...] "The goal <b>you</b> as athletes <b>should</b> <b>try</b> {{to reach for}} in the Games is not to accomplish the Olympic slogan of 'faster, higher and farther' but {{to show the world}} your real selves as courageous challengers, glorious conquerors and impartial participants." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, let us {{understand}} each other," [...] he said gently. [...] "There is no anger between us, {{though there is}} that which I cannot endure at present. I will try to bring myself to endure it. I will let you know where I go to as soon as I know myself. And if I can bring myself to bear it--if it is desirable, possible--I will come to you. But until I come to you {{it will be better}} that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> not <b>try</b> to come to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'My dear Miss Catherine,' I began, too vividly {{impressed}} by her recent kindness {{to break into}} a scold, 'where have you been riding out at this hour? And why <b>should</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> to deceive me by telling a tale? Where have you been? Speak!' ...|$|R
