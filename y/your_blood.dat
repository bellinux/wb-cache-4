25|$|In 2005, as {{the inaugural}} effort, the theme was simply ‘Awareness of high blood {{pressure}}’. The 2006 theme was ‘Treat to goal’, {{with a focus}} on keeping blood pressure under control. The recommended blood pressures are less than 140/90 mmHg for the general population and for the hypertensive population without any other complications, and less than 130/80 mmHg for those with diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney disease. These are the cut-off values recommended by international and Canadian guidelines. The 2007 WHD theme was ‘Healthy diet, healthy blood pressure’. Through such specific themes, the WHL intends to raise awareness not only of hypertension, but also of factors contributing to an increase in the incidence of hypertension and on ways to prevent it. In an effort to empower the public, the theme for 2008 was ‘Measure <b>your</b> <b>blood</b> pressure…at home’. Recent reports confirm the ease, accuracy and safety of blood pressure measurements using home monitors.|$|E

Jason Berry of The New York Times commended the [...] "shimmering intelligence" [...] of Fink's {{discussion}} of the events and their ethical issues, and summarized the book as [...] "social reporting of the first rank". Another New York Times critic, bioethicist Sherwin B. Nuland, felt the book displayed [...] "masterly reporting and the glow of fine writing" [...] and offered particular praise for the tone and language of Fink's writing. The Independent Hirsh Sawhney admired the detail and variety of perspectives offered {{in the book and}} described the book as [...] "soar to artistic and intellectual heights undreamed of in other realms of media". Peter Beaumont, writing for The Guardian, found parts of the book awkward in structure, but felt that overall it was [...] "tight, provocative and gripping" [...] with a [...] "fair and deeply sympathetic" [...] approach to the involved parties. A review by John B. Saul in The Seattle Times commended Fink's ability to produce a [...] "compelling and revealing account" [...] of events despite limited access to evidence such as investigative reports and Pou's testimony, while the Star Tribune Curt Schleier described Five Days at Memorial as [...] "an important book that will make <b>your</b> <b>blood</b> boil no matter which side of the issue you support".|$|E

In his 2011 review of Bedtime Stories, Brett Callwood of the Detroit Metro Times called the song [...] "spectacular". NPR Multimedia senior producer Keith Jenkins gave a positive review of the song, stating that it [...] "washes over you and gets <b>your</b> <b>blood</b> boiling. You may not walk on water after hearing it, but you may want to get your focus back by walking on broken glass". Louis Virtel, from TheBacklot.com, placed [...] "Take a Bow" [...] at number 27 of his list [...] "The 100 Greatest Madonna Songs". He wrote; [...] "Madonna's most successful single to date is a melancholic evisceration of a lover's artifice, and its hopeless plain-spokenness makes it one of the finest examples of 90s balladry". Rikky Rooksby, author of The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, was less impressed with the track. Although he felt that it sounded [...] "shockingly normal" [...] after the [...] "ambient 'Bedtime Story'", he found the song's length as over-long and deduced it to be [...] "communica no sense whatsoever of the pain of a real goodbye." ...|$|E
500|$|Timothy Zachery Mosley {{was born}} on March 10, 1972 in Norfolk, Virginia, to Latrice, who ran a {{homeless}} shelter, and Garland Mosley, an Amtrak employee. He graduated from Salem High School of Virginia Beach, Virginia. During his time as a DJ, {{he was known as}} [...] "DJ Tim" [...] or [...] "DJ Timmy Tim". His brother, Sebastian, is reportedly around nine years younger. His sister Courtney Rashon is a makeup artist and author from New Jersey. While attending high school, Timbaland began a long-term collaboration with rapper Melvin (Magoo) Barcliff. The teenage Mosley also joined the production ensemble S.B.I. (which stood for 'Surrounded By Idiots') which also featured Neptunes producer Pharrell. Mosley was also high school friends with brothers Terrence and Gene Thornton, who would become known as Pusha T and Malice of the rap group Clipse, respectively. In 1986, when Timbaland was 14 years old, he was accidentally shot by a co-worker at a local Red Lobster restaurant and was partially paralyzed for nine months. During this time, he began to learn how to DJ using his left hand.Tim rarely talks about the shooting, and is, in fact, quite critical of gangsta rappers who boast of their war wounds. I'm not a rapper," [...] he says dismissively. I'm not talking about my scars or my battles. Still, the shooting did help him form a bond with 50 Cent. I'll tell you this, Tim says.
