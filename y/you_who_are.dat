5|$|We earnestly {{recommend}} a longer recess from labour at noon, {{and a more}} early dismission from it in the evening, {{to all those who}} work in the cotton mills: but we deem this indulgence essential to the present health, and future capacity for labour, of those who are under the age of fourteen; for the active recreations of childhood and youth are necessary to the growth, vigour, and the right conformation of the human body. And we cannot excuse ourselves, on the present occasion, from suggesting to <b>you,</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> the guardians of the public weal, this further very important consideration, that the rising generation should not be debarred from all opportunities of instruction at the only season of life in which they can be properly improved.|$|E

500|$|Visitors {{were met}} at the {{entrance}} to the wood by the Latin inscription Procul este, profani, which translates as [...] "away all <b>you</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> unhallowed", a quotation from the sixth book of Virgil's Aeneid. The iron entrance gate was mounted between two upended stone coffins supporting the portico, each one topped by a human skull, one male one female. Each coffin was inscribed with a poem, addressed to the male and female visitor respectively. One proclaimed that [...] "Men, at their best state, are altogether vanity", while the other reminded women that [...] "beauty is vain". The author of the poems is unknown, but may have been Soame Jenyns, although topographer Edward Brayley was not entirely convinced this was correct.|$|E
500|$|Trying {{to unravel}} {{the mystery of the}} song, Greil Marcus writes that the song is {{concerned}} with internal questions, rather than external ones: [...] "Line by line, 'Blowin' in the Wind' is pious, or falsely innocent—isn't it obvious that whoever wrote [...] "Yes, 'n' how many seas must a white dove sail / Before she sleeps in the sand?" [...] already knows the answer, assuming he, or anyone, can actually bring themselves to care about such a precious question? But 'Visions of Johanna' is asking different sorts of questions. Such as: Where are <b>you?</b> <b>Who</b> <b>are</b> you? What are you doing here?" [...] Evoking the drugged, urban milieu of the song, Marcus writes of [...] "People wandering from one corner of a loft to another, doped, drunk, half-awake, fast asleep, no point to the next breath, let alone the next step." [...] For Marcus, [...] "'Visions of Johanna' makes a narrative solely out of atmosphere." ...|$|E
500|$|The bass aria {{beginning}} part II, [...] "" [...] (Welcome, worthy treasure!) shows [...] "echoes of {{the first}} movement" [...] and avoids a regular da capo structure. The bass voice is the vox Christi, addressing the bride. The welcoming gesture from the secular cantata seems appropriate for the expressed sentiment. The next hymn stanza, [...] "" [...] (<b>You</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> like the Father), the sixth stanza from Luther's hymn [...] "dealing with {{the sins of the}} flesh and Christ's mission to redeem humankind", is marked [...] "molt' allegro". The tenor sings the chorale melody unadorned as a cantus firmus, but the oboes d'amore play with [...] "the urgent surging of semi-quaver activity". Dürr sees the expression of [...] "" [...] (fight and victory of the Son of God) over [...] "" [...] (weak/sick flesh) of man. Gardiner compares it to a trio sonata movement. He terms the last aria [...] "a berceuse of pure enchantment" [...] and compares it to the [...] "echo aria" [...] from part IV of Bach's Christmas Oratorio. The text [...] "" [...] (Also with muted, weak voices) is illustrated by a muted (con sordino) solo violin. The closing choral, the final stanza of Luther's hymn, [...] "" [...] (Praise be to God, the Father) is a four-part setting.|$|E

500|$|It's {{human nature}} to look to {{external}} forces when faced with our own inadequacies but the ethicist is against this. Comparison is an esthetic exercise and {{has nothing to do}} with ethics and religion. He says, [...] "Let each one learn what he can; both of us can learn that a person’s unhappiness never lies in his lack of control over external conditions, since this would only make him completely unhappy." [...] He also asks if a person [...] "absolutely in love can know if he is more or less in love than others." [...] He completes this thought later in his Concluding Unscientific Postscript and expands on looking inward in Practice in Christianity.The ethical and the ethical-religious have nothing to do with the comparative. … All comparison delays, and that is why mediocrity likes it so much and, if possible, traps everyone in it by its despicable friendship among mediocrities. A person who blames others, that they have corrupted him, is talking nonsense and only informs against himself. Concluding Unscientific Postscript p. 549-550Comparison is the most disastrous association that love can enter into; comparison is the most dangerous acquaintance love can make; comparison is the worst of all seductions. Søren Kierkegaard, Works of Love (1847), Hong, p. 186 Lord Jesus Christ, our foolish minds are weak; they are more than willing to be drawn-and there is so much that wants to draw us to itself. There is pleasure with its seductive power, the multiplicity with its bewildering distractions, the moment with its infatuating importance and the conceited laboriousness of busyness and the careless time-wasting of light-mindedness and the gloomy brooding of heavy-mindedness-all this will draw us away from ourselves to itself in order to deceive us. [...] But <b>you,</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> the truth, only you, Savior and Redeemer, can truly draw a person to yourself, which you have promised to do-that you will draw all to yourself. Then may God grant that by repenting we may come to ourselves, so that you, according to your Word, can draw us to yourself-from on high, but through lowliness and abasement.
