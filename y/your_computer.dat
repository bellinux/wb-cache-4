5|$|The ZX Spectrum {{enjoyed a}} very strong {{community}} early on. Several dedicated magazines were released including Sinclair User (1982), Your Spectrum (1983), rebranded as Your Sinclair in 1986, and CRASH (1984). Early on they were very technically oriented with type-in programs and machine code tutorials. Later on they became almost completely game-oriented. Several general contemporary computer magazines covered the ZX Spectrum in more or less detail. They included Computer Gamer, Computer and Video Games, Computing Today, Popular Computing Weekly, <b>Your</b> <b>Computer</b> and The Games Machine.|$|E

500|$|Reviewers {{writing for}} Crash praised the gameplay, {{stating that the}} game's [...] "element" [...] was {{considerably}} developed and that the several different stages were [...] "highly addictive". Writers in CVG criticised the gameplay, noting that they {{found it difficult to}} distinguish the outlaws from other male inhabitants of the town. They also noted the absence of puzzle elements which was considered [...] "unusual" [...] for an Ultimate game. Bill Bennett of <b>Your</b> <b>Computer</b> similarly considered the omission of puzzle elements unusual, but welcomed the [...] "witty" [...] change in genre from the previous dungeon-themed video games.|$|E

500|$|Sinclair's {{claims to}} have revolutionised the {{electric}} vehicle were dismissed by many reviewers; <b>Your</b> <b>Computer</b> called the C5 [...] "more of a toy than the 'ideal solution {{for all types of}} local journey' which the brochure claims". The Guardian's motoring correspondent also characterised it as [...] "a delightful toy" [...] The Daily Telegraph described it as [...] "a cleverly-designed 'fun' machine that can hardly be regarded as serious, everyday all-weather transport", while The Engineer viewed it as [...] "a smashing big boy's toy, tough enough to take teenage thrashing and possibly a serious vehicle for fit adults to nip out in for the Sunday papers".|$|E

An editor from The Sunday Press suggested that Falklands '82 was [...] "distasteful" [...] because of the game's possibility of an Argentine victory. The game was planned for an Amstrad CPC port, but was never released for that computer. [...] In Spanish markets, the game was released as Malvinas '82 (the Spanish name for the Falkland Islands) and included a manual which was never translated into English.|$|E

500|$|Reviews of the ZX81 {{highlighted}} the great {{value for money}} offered by the machine but noted its technical shortcomings. As Tim Hartnell put it in <b>Your</b> <b>Computer,</b> [...] "the ZX81 is both a delight and a disappointment". He applauded the improvements {{that had been made}} over the ZX80, such as a much better manual, display and string handling, and called the ZX81 [...] "a very good first computer" [...] that [...] "will open the world of computing to many who would be denied access to it by cost." [...] However, the built-in memory was so small that use of a memory expansion pack was [...] "mandatory for any worthwhile use". He also found the ZX81 to be alarmingly unreliable, having to have his first two test machines replaced before getting one that worked properly.|$|E
500|$|The game's visuals {{were highly}} praised by reviewers. In a preview, IGN said that [...] "After seeing the screenshots, our jaws {{hit the floor}} {{at the amount of}} detail," [...] while in their review, 1UP.com {{described}} it as [...] "one of the most beautiful games you will put on <b>your</b> <b>computer</b> for the foreseeable future;" [...] GameSpy agreed, stating, [...] "Age IIIs graphics are unmatched in the strategy genre." [...] GameSpot also admired the graphics, but had a negative comment as well; they said, [...] "Were it not for the awkward unit behavior...Age of Empires III would look truly amazing." [...] GameSpy awarded Age of Empires III the [...] "Best Graphics" [...] award at GameSpy's [...] "Game of the Year 2005", mentioning that the graphics engine boasted [...] "all the high-end technology you would normally find in first-person shooters." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{marketing}} of the ZX81 was handled by Sinclair's long-standing marketing agency Primary Contact (now part of Ogilvy & Mather), which had provided marketing services for Sinclair since 1971 and was {{to continue doing}} so until 1985. Sinclair's entry into the nascent home computing market gave Primary Contact a major challenge – how to market a product simultaneously at hobbyists and at the [...] "man on the street", who probably {{had little or no}} computer literacy. The answer was to pursue what the journalist David O'Reilly of MicroScope magazine described as a single-minded [...] "user-friendly strategy." [...] Chris Fawkes, one of Primary Contact's directors, explained: [...] "We brought personal computers to the mass market by showing that you didn't have to be a whizzkid to use one."

500|$|This hypothesis, {{although}} not perfect, perhaps best explains the evidence. Eighteen {{months prior to}} an October 1984 conference on lunar origins, Bill Hartmann, Roger Phillips, and Jeff Taylor challenged fellow lunar scientists: [...] "You have eighteen months. Go back to your Apollo data, go back to <b>your</b> <b>computer,</b> do whatever you have to, but make up your mind. Don't come to our conference unless {{you have something to}} say about the Moon's birth." [...] At the 1984 conference at Kona, Hawaii, the giant impact hypothesis emerged as the most popular. Before the conference, there were partisans of the three [...] "traditional" [...] theories, plus a few people who were starting to take the giant impact seriously, and there was a huge apathetic middle who didn’t think the debate would ever be resolved. Afterward there were essentially only two groups: the giant impact camp and the agnostics.|$|E

In Gruff Rhys's words Hey Venus! is [...] "a straight up album of songs... with key changes and a live band playing them" [...] with more emphasis [...] "on songs than the arrangement". According to Rhys [...] "nobody brought samplers into the studio, so there's far less electronics than on a lot of our records... a lot of electronic music is quite a solitary pursuit. You sit at <b>your</b> <b>computer</b> or sampler and sometimes it's more of an individual kind of thing.

We're just people. #AllLivesMatter," [...] to which Baer responded with a scathing column on Crashburn Alley, a blog affiliated with ESPN, in which he stated that De Fratus is [...] "complicit in perpetuating a system which inflicts violence on those who didn’t {{have the luxury of}} being born white and male and straight and in an economically-stable area." [...] Subsequently, De Fratus penned a retort to Baer via Facebook, in which he commented, [...] "I sincerely hope that you will take the time to talk to me personally next time before you decide to hide behind <b>your</b> <b>computer</b> screen and criticize me, my upbringing and my character based on 140 characters.

500|$|The game {{received}} negative reviews upon release. Angus Ryall of Crash criticised the game's incompatibility {{with black}} and white television sets, stating that, despite a growing British economy, Ryall expected the developers to have designed games for [...] "the lowest common denominator". Gwyn Hughes of Your Sinclair criticised the tactical elements of the game as too light, stating {{that the success of}} the player depends on dexterity, and not [...] "brainpower". Clare Edgely of Sinclair User praised the game's historical accuracy, however she felt that its late release in comparison to other wargames made The Battle For Midway feel [...] "ordinary". A reviewer of <b>Your</b> <b>Computer</b> stated that the game was a [...] "flawed" [...] attempt to recreate the famous Battle of Midway, despite admitting that it contained [...] "some nice touches". A reviewer of Australian Commodore Review praised the game's wide range of features such as the save and load functions. However, they criticised menu designs and [...] "insufficiently integrated" [...] arcade sequences, calling them both [...] "poor".|$|E
500|$|The {{trend in}} {{improved}} graphics continued {{well into the}} next release, Age of Empires III, much to the delight of reviewers. IGN stated, [...] "After seeing the screenshots, our jaws hit the floor at the amount of detail." [...] 1UP.com described Age of Empires III as [...] "one of the most beautiful games you will put on <b>your</b> <b>computer</b> for the foreseeable future." [...] GameSpy agreed, stating, [...] "Age IIIs graphics are unmatched in the strategy genre." [...] Age of Empires III builds on and introduces new features to the prior release, Age of Mythology, such as the inclusion of the award-winning Havok physics simulation middleware game engine for the Windows version and PhysX for the Mac OS X. The innovative result is that pre-created animations are avoided; instead events are calculated according to the physics engine. Consequently, views of events like building destruction and tree felling are not pre-recorded. GameSpot also admired the graphics in the fourth release but complained about [...] "the awkward unit behavior." [...] Other graphical features of the game include bloom lighting and support for pixel shader 3.0.|$|E
500|$|Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser of Dragon {{praised the}} designers' {{attention}} to detail, and cited the game's humor {{as a high}} point. Although {{they believed that the}} game was too expensive, they summarized it as [...] "a highly enjoyable graphic adventure replete with interesting puzzles, a fantastic Roland soundtrack, superb VGA graphics, smooth-scrolling animation, and some of the funniest lines ever seen on <b>your</b> <b>computer</b> screen." [...] Duncan MacDonald of Zero praised the graphics and found the game [...] "quite amusing". His favorite aspect was the fine-tuned difficulty level, which he believed was [...] "just right". He ended his review, [...] "At last an adventure game that's enjoyable rather than frustrating." [...] Paul Glancey of Computer and Video Games consider the game superior to Lucasfilm's earlier adventure titles, and wrote that, [...] "Usually the entertainment you get from an adventure is derived solely from solving puzzles, but the hilarious characters and situations, and the movie-like presentation ... make playing this more like taking part in a comedy film, so it's much more enjoyable." [...] He considered the puzzles to be [...] "brilliantly conceived" [...] and found the game's controls accessible. He summarized it as [...] "utterly enthralling".|$|E
