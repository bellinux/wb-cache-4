25|$|Asia Agcaoili {{spearheaded the}} show for the viewers of Studio 23. Her show, called Pinoy Big Brother on Studio 23: Si Kuya, KaBarkada Mo (English: Filipino Big Brother on Studio 23: <b>Your</b> <b>Brother,</b> Your Buddy), not only {{featured}} snippets from the primetime telecast the night before, but also featured opinion polls both from {{the man on the}} street and those sending SMS, spoof segments, unaired videos, and feed from inside the house (either live feed or footage taped earlier). Studio 23 has stopped the practice since the second Celebrity Edition and instead resorted to airing the delayed late morning/early afternoon feeds.|$|E
25|$|The {{execution}} {{by lethal}} injection began at 10:53pm EDT. In his final words, Davis maintained his innocence, saying:Well, first of all I'd like to address the MacPhail family. I'd like to let you all know, despite the situation – I know {{all of you are}} still convinced that I'm the person that killed your father, your son and <b>your</b> <b>brother,</b> but I am innocent. The incident that happened that night was not my fault. I did not have a gun that night. I did not shoot your family member. But I am so sorry for your loss. I really am – sincerely. All I can ask is that each of you look deeper into this case, so that you really will finally see the truth. I ask my family and friends that you all continue to pray, that you all continue to forgive. Continue to fight this fight. For those about to take my life, may God have mercy on all of your souls. God bless you all. He was declared dead at 11:08pm EDT.|$|E

What was there to laugh at? <b>Your</b> <b>brother's</b> {{features}} are <b>your</b> features; <b>your</b> <b>brother's</b> hair is <b>your</b> hair; <b>your</b> <b>brother's</b> height is <b>your</b> height. What is there so very ridiculous--with such a resemblance as that--in a poor blind girl like me mistaking you one for the other? I wish to preserve a good opinion of you, for Oscar's sake. Don't turn me into ridicule again--or I shall be forced to think that <b>your</b> <b>brother's</b> good heart is not yours also!" ...|$|R

500|$|Catherine and Francis are later {{informed}} by Dr. Leon that Isabella in fact was not tortured to death, rather she was entombed behind {{a brick wall}} while still alive. Dr. Leon explains, [...] "The very thought of premature interment is enough to send <b>your</b> <b>brother</b> into convulsions of horror." [...] Nicholas fears that Elizabeth may have been interred prematurely. The doctor tells Nicholas that [...] "if Elizabeth Medina walks these corridors, it is her spirit and not her living self." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{intense heat}} at the outdoor Bastille Day event on 14 July {{exhausted}} {{the former prime}} minister, and that evening Rainilaiarivony developed a fever. He slept poorly, disturbed by a dream in which he saw the former queen Rasoherina stand beside his bed, saying, [...] "In the name of <b>your</b> <b>brother,</b> Rainivoninahitriniony, be ready." [...] One of Rainilaiarivony's servants reported the dream to Vassé, explaining it as a premonition that foretold Rainilaiarivony's impending death. The former prime minister remained in bed and rapidly weakened {{over the next several}} days as his fever worsened and he developed a headache. He was constantly attended by his closest friends and loved ones. Rainilaiarivony died in his sleep on 17 July 1896.|$|E
500|$|Kings {{and priests}} in the Old Testament were {{forbidden}} to partake of wine at various times. John the Baptist was a Nazarite from birth. Nazarite vows excluded not only wine, but also vinegar, grapes, and raisins. (Jesus evidently did not take such a vow during the three years of ministry depicted in the gospels, but in fact was even accused by the Pharisees of eating and drinking with sinners. St. Paul further instructs Christians regarding their duty toward immature Christians: [...] "It is better not to eat meat or drink wine or {{to do anything else}} that will cause <b>your</b> <b>brother</b> to fall." [...] Jewish priests cannot bless a congregation after consuming alcohol.|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{after his}} release, Heywood {{had written to}} Edward Christian, Fletcher's older brother, that he would [...] "endeavour to prove that <b>your</b> <b>brother</b> was not that vile wretch, void of all {{gratitude}} ... but, on the contrary, a most worthy character ... beloved by all (except one, whose ill report is his greatest praise)". This statement, published immediately after Heywood's pardon in a local Whitehaven newspaper as {{an open letter to}} Edward Christian, contradicted the respect Heywood had accorded Bligh in the courtroom, and, in turn, it led to the publication in late 1794 of Edward Christian's Appendix to the court martial proceedings. Presented as an account of the [...] "real causes and circumstances of that Unhappy Transaction", the Appendix was said by the press to [...] "palliate the behaviour of Christian and the Mutineers, and to criminate Captain Bligh". In the controversy that followed, Bligh's rebuttals could not silence doubts as to his own conduct, and his position was further undermined when William Peckover, a Bligh loyalist, confirmed that the allegations in the Appendix were substantially accurate.|$|E
500|$|Joined on Anaheim's {{blueline}} by Chris Pronger, Niedermayer {{helped the}} Ducks set franchise records in 2006–07 for most wins (48) and points (110). Both were named finalists for the Norris Trophy, but lost to Detroit's Nicklas Lidström. Individually, Niedermayer played his 1,000th career game, against the Edmonton Oilers on November 28, 2006. He set career highs of 15 goals, 54 assists and 69 points {{during the regular}} season and was named a First Team All-Star. He added 11 points in the 2007 Stanley Cup Playoffs, and was named recipient of the Conn Smythe Memorial Trophy as the most valuable player of the post-season after leading Anaheim to the franchise's first championship in a five-game series victory over the Ottawa Senators in the final. As team captain, Niedermayer was the first player given the chance to hoist the Stanley Cup. He passed the trophy to his brother; it was Rob's first championship victory. Of the moment, Scott stated: [...] "You don't really dream of passing it to <b>your</b> <b>brother.</b> I never have. To {{be able to do that}} is definitely a highlight of my career." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1846, Seward {{became the}} center of {{controversy}} in Auburn when he defended, in separate cases, two felons accused of murder. Henry Wyatt, a white man, was charged with fatally stabbing a fellow inmate in prison; William Freeman, an African American, was accused of breaking into a house after his release and stabbing four people to death. In both cases the defendants were likely mentally ill and had been abused while in prison. Seward, having long been an advocate of prison reform and better treatment for the insane, sought to prevent each man from being executed by using the relatively new defense of insanity. Seward gained a hung jury in Wyatt's first trial, though he was subsequently convicted in a retrial and executed despite Seward's efforts to secure clemency. Freeman was convicted, though Seward gained a reversal on appeal. There was no second Freeman trial, as officials were convinced of his insanity. Freeman died in prison in late 1846. In the Freeman case, invoking mental illness and racial issues, Seward argued, [...] "he is still <b>your</b> <b>brother,</b> and mine, in form and color accepted and approved by his Father, and yours, and mine, and bears equally with us the proudest inheritance of our race—the image of our Maker. Hold him then to be a Man." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rav Nahman bar Isaac (explaining the {{position}} of Rabbi Eleazar) interpreted the words [...] "that <b>your</b> <b>brother</b> may live with you" [...] in [...] to teach that one who has exacted interest should {{return it to the}} borrower, so that the borrower could survive economically.|$|E
2500|$|Christians are {{instructed}} regarding abstinence {{and their}} duty toward immature Christians: [...] "All food is clean, {{but it is}} wrong {{for a man to}} eat anything that causes someone else to stumble. It is better not to eat meat or drink wine or to do anything else that will cause <b>your</b> <b>brother</b> to fall." ...|$|E
2500|$|Esau was heartbroken by the {{deception}} and begged {{for his own}} blessing. Having made Jacob a ruler over his brothers, Isaac could only promise, [...] "By your sword you shall live, but <b>your</b> <b>brother</b> you shall serve; yet it shall be that when you are aggrieved, you may cast off his yoke from upon your neck" [...] (27:39–40).|$|E

An' I guess we all ain't mistaken on the stink of the place where <b>your</b> <b>brother's</b> pull comes from." ...|$|R

2500|$|I {{was trying}} to keep it close to the vest {{throughout}} the release. Paul Walker used to say that [...] was guaranteed. And in some ways, when <b>your</b> <b>brother</b> guarantees something, you sometimes feel like {{you have to make sure}} it comes to pass... so if fate has it, then you’ll get this when you hear about it. [...] was for Paul, [...] is from Paul.|$|E

2500|$|A Baraita {{considered}} {{the case where}} two people were traveling on a journey, and one had a container of water; if both drank, they would both die, but if only one drank, then that one might reach civilization and survive. Ben Patura taught {{that it is better}} that both should drink and die, rather than that only one should drink and see the other die. But Rabbi Akiva interpreted the words [...] "that <b>your</b> <b>brother</b> may live with you" [...] in [...] to teach that concern for one's own life takes precedence over concern for another's.|$|E

2500|$|I {{remember}} that <b>your</b> <b>brother</b> Hugh {{did something to}} dissuade me from tackling Manxland in any sort of work. He did not think the readers of novels would find the island at all interesting, and {{he was sure that}} the local atmosphere was not such as would attract them. I thought over this a good deal, and decided, I must say, against your brother's judgment. [...] In the first place, the island has excellent atmosphere. It has the sea, a fine coast on the west, fine moorland above; it has traditions, folk-talk, folk-lore, a ballad literature, and no end of superstition – and all these are very much its own.|$|E
2500|$|In 198, when Liu Bei was {{planning}} to break free of Cao Cao's control by leaving the imperial capital Xu (許; present-day Xuchang, Henan), he sent Sun Qian and Mi Zhu to secretly contact Cao's rivals Yuan Shao and Liu Biao and form alliances with them. After Yuan Shao's death in 202, Liu Biao once wrote to Yuan Shao's third son and successor, Yuan Shang, and mentioned the rivalry between Yuan Shang and his eldest brother Yuan Tan. Liu Biao wrote: [...] "Whenever I discussed this issue (the rivalry between you and <b>your</b> <b>brother)</b> with General Liu (Liu Bei) and Sun Gongyou, I feel very upset and heartbroken." [...] Both Liu Bei and Liu Biao highly regarded Sun Qian.|$|E
2500|$|The Sifre {{taught that}} when Moses saw the merciful manner of Aaron's death, Moses {{concluded}} {{that he would}} want to die the same way. The Sifre taught that God told Aaron to go in a cave, to climb onto a bier, to spread his hands, to spread his legs, to close his mouth, and to close his eyes, and then Aaron died. At that moment, Moses concluded that one would be happy to die that way. And that is why God later told Moses in [...] that Moses would die [...] "as Aaron <b>your</b> <b>brother</b> died on Mount Hor, and was gathered unto his people," [...] for that was the manner of death that Moses had wanted.|$|E
50|$|Retired Supreme Court Justice Romeo Callejo Sr., one {{of those}} {{conducting}} the investigation, castigated Justice Sabio why he didn’t bring up the intervention of his brother previously—or reprimand his brother. “Why did you not report <b>your</b> <b>brother’s</b> attempt to influence you? That was unethical. You did nothing; you are a professor of ethics. Did you not consider that <b>your</b> <b>brother’s</b> attempt was criminal?” Callejo asked.|$|R
