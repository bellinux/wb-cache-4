40|$|Characterization {{was done}} with {{fourteen}} exotic varieties of potato (Solanum tuberosum) namely Mondial, Granola, Cardinal, Ailsa, Petronese, Morene, Diamant, Cleopetra, Binella, Dheera, Multa, Kufri Sindhuri, Heera, Chamak and a local check (Lal Pakri) under Bangladesh condition. The tuber skin color of Mondial, Granola, Ailsa, Petronese, Morene, Diamant, Binella, Dheera, Multa, Heera and Chamak were white to light <b>yellow,</b> while <b>Cardinal,</b> Kufri Sindhuri, Cleopetra were red. The tuber shape were round in Granola, Morene and Kufri Sindhuri; elongate in Mondial, Ailsa and Diamant and oval in rest of the exotic potato varieties. The plant traits were spready and green in color with no flowering habit except variety Chamak. The yield ranged of exotic varieties were 19. 44 to 46. 67 ton per hectare. Variety Ailsa produced the maximum yield (46. 67 t ha - 1) which was followed by Cardinal and Mondial...|$|R
50|$|The Pottsville Maroons {{were one}} of the {{dominant}} teams of the 1925 season, and after defeating the Cardinals on December 6, came away with {{the best record in the}} league. However, NFL commissioner Joseph Carr suspended and removed the Maroons from the NFL after they played an unauthorized exhibition game in Philadelphia, on the grounds that they had violated the territorial rights of the Frankford <b>Yellow</b> Jackets. The <b>Cardinals</b> played and won two more games against weak NFL opponents, giving them a superior record, and were awarded the title.|$|R

40|$|The <b>yellow</b> <b>cardinal</b> (Gubernatrix cristata) is a {{passerine}} {{found in}} southern Brazil, especially {{along the border}} with Uruguay and Argentina. It is an endangered species and its population is decreasing. Among the parasites that affect passerines, the genus Isospora is the most easily found in both captive and free-living birds. This parasite commonly causes injury to the intestinal tissue and could occasionally affect other organs. In this work we examined the occurrence of coccidiosis in captive yellow cardinals and its association with factors such as sex, use of parasiticides, type of enclosure, contact with feces, type of food and cleaning frequency. We collected fecal samples of 45 yellow cardinals, healthy and kept in captivity, in late afternoon {{at the end of the}} reproductive period. The examination showed parasitic infection by Isospora bocamontensis in 44. 5 % of the birds. This infection is not influenced by the sex of birds, but is significantly affected by the type of enclosure, contact with the feces, use of parasiticides, type of food and cleaning frequency. The results indicate that to keep yellow cardinals captive, these factors must be observed...|$|E
40|$|Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann, 1824) (Dip. : Tephritidae) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{destructive}} agricultural pests in the world. To replace chemical control methods, as well as the timing of the peak population of Mediterranean fruit fly, the yellow sticky vertical traps were used in this study. The research was carried out in some citrus orchards of various cities of Mazandaran province of Iran, during the four months from August to November 2016. To determine the best type of yellow color to trap this fly, four types of yellow colors with measured wavelength of reflection, including the fluorescent yellow (538 nm), lemon yellow (574 nm), yellow (602 nm) and amber yellow (641 nm), were used. Also, to determine the best geographical direction and appropriate height for installation of <b>yellow</b> cards, four <b>cardinal</b> directions and five different heights of 1, 1. 5, 2, 2. 5 and 3 m above ground level were determined and the cards were installed. The results of mean comparison of captured flies in different treatments showed that there are significant differences between all of them. The results indicated that the fluorescent yellow, heights of 1. 5 and 2 m, the south direction, and month October had the highest number of capture in yellow cards. </p...|$|R
40|$|The drought that gripped much {{of western}} Nebraska {{for the past}} 5 years {{loosened}} its hold this year as rain returned to more normal levels, especially in the northwest Panhandle. Some {{other areas of the}} state still remained at below normal rainfall levels. The following observers submitted records for the nest report: Kathy Delara (KD), Stephen J. Dinsmore (SJD), Mike Fritz (MF), Robin Harding (RH), Derrick Keim (DK), Alice Kenitz (AK), Courtney Kerns (CK), Daniel H.

40|$|Adaptation to {{a steady}} {{background}} has {{a profound effect on}} both colour appearance and discriminability. We determined the temporal characteristics of adaptation for appearance and discrimination, and for changes along different colour directions. Subjects were adapted to a large uniform background made up of a CRT screen and a 60 deg × 60 deg wall illuminated by computer-controlled lamps. After an instant change in background colour along the red - green or blue - <b>yellow</b> <b>cardinal</b> colour axes, we measured thresholds for the detection of increments or decrements along the same axes at fixed times between 16 and 120 s. Analogously, colour appearance was determined by means of observer production of achromatic appearance. We found a slow exponential time-course of adaptation with a half-life of 20 - 30 s that was common to appearance and discrimination. Also, a 50 - 100 ms component could be identified, which was probably due to photoreceptor adaptation. There was an extremely fast mechanism with a half-life faster than 10 ms, but only for colour appearance. There were no differences for adaptational changes along the different colour axes. We conclude that the fast adaptation mechanism for colour appearance is of higher order and is situated after the mechanisms mediating slower adaptational changes in colour discrimination and appearance...|$|E

O cardeal-amarelo (Gubernatrix cristata) é um pássaro que ocorre no sul do Brasil, principalmente na fronteira com Uruguai e Argentina. É uma ave ameaçada de extinção e sua população está decrescendo. Dentre, os parasitas que afetam a ordem Passeriformes, o gênero Isospora está entre o mais encontrado, tanto em aves de cativeiro quanto em aves de vida-livre. Comumente causam injúrias no tecido intestinal, podendo ocasionalmente afetar outros órgãos. Neste trabalho examinamos a ocorrência de coccidiose em cardeais mantidos em cativeiro e verificamos sua associação com fatores como sexo, uso de produtos parasiticidas, tipo de recinto, contato com fezes, tipo de alimentação e frequência de limpeza. Foram coletadas amostras de fezes, ao entardecer, de 45 cardeais-amarelos, hígidos, mantidos em cativeiro, no final do período reprodutivo. O exame coproparasitológico revelou infecção parasitária por Isospora bocamontensis, em 44, 5 % das aves. Esta infecção não é influenciada pelo sexo das aves, mas é significativamente afetada pelo tipo de recinto, contato com as fezes, uso de parasiticidas, tipo de alimentação e frequência de limpeza. Indicando que para a manutenção em cativeiro estes fatores devem ser observados...|$|E
