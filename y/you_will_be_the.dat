25|$|By {{the will}} of my {{commander}} in chief, I have come to release the ownership over the Talysh regions {{from the hands of}} the Persians and therefore must take Lankaran. Knowing you are a valiant and prudent leader, I consider it necessary to warn that your resistance will be in vain. Even though you may be a great military leader, but you are no better than Abbas Mirza, who lost at Aslanduz and with that ten thousand soldiers, 500 men as prisoners, all the banners, weapons of which the troops don't have to their disposal right now. As it was at Aslanduz, where here barely escaped along with the 20th horsemen regiment and fled to Tabriz, while he had thirty thousand men at his disposal, and we had just two thousand men. Warriors of the great almighty in the world the Russian emperor crashed Abbas Mirza to pieces, and now they are located here, at the Talysh Khanate. So, when Abbas Mirza could not resist our victorious weapons, despite the fact that his troops outnumbered ours by fifteen times, you reflect that you won't be able either to inflict us a mortal blow here; so I suggest that you agree to voluntarily surrender the fortress to avoid harmful and unnecessary bloodshed, sparing both Abbas Mirza's as well as my warriors. Consider of what you will reach by following sanity, namely saving lives, dignity, and both your property and all affiliated parties' properties in this conflict; otherwise, you will lose everything, if you won't attend the voice of common sense. But it is my duty to tell you, as <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> one to choose; only I shall be justified in front of God and humanity. I'm ordered not to bombard yet by this letter until I receive response and receipt within three hours.|$|E

500|$|Andante. Copland {{considered}} this prélude the most immediately accessible of the set. [...] "At first, what will most attract <b>you,</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> third in G-minor, a strange {{mixture of the}} romantic and classic." [...] The musicologist Vladimir Jankélévitch wrote, [...] "it might be a barcarolle strangely interrupting a theme of very modern stylistic contour".|$|E
500|$|Following the match, Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier {{claimed he}} had a premonition that goalkeeper Dudek would be {{the hero of the}} final: [...] "I told Jerzy three days ago 'I can feel <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> hero. You were too unlucky when we played them, today he was man of the match. But {{football}} can be like that. Sometimes you can be at the bottom and then be a hero again. I just had a feeling. I'm a great believer that when you have the right attitude everything else follows. He had a good run after the World Cup but then he made some mistakes and we had to support him. The squad get on very well. There was no finger-pointing after that game. He has saved us before in games and we had to keep faith in him." [...] Houllier also praised Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson: [...] "I wished him the best in the Champions League because he represents the best in English football, he congratulated every Liverpool player after the final whistle and that shows that he is not just a great manager but a great man." ...|$|E

2500|$|Perhaps {{the climax}} of the feud came during Fred Allen's parody of popular quiz-and-prize show Queen for a Day, which was barely a year old when Allen decided to have a crack at it on The Fred Allen Show—an episode that has survived for today's {{listeners}} to appreciate. Calling the sketch [...] "King for a Day", Allen played the host and Benny a contestant who sneaked onto the show using the alias Myron Proudfoot. Benny answered the prize-winning question correctly and Allen crowned him [...] "king" [...] and showered him with a passel of almost meaningless prizes. Allen proudly announced, [...] "Tomorrow night, in your ermine robe, you will be whisked by bicycle to Orange, New Jersey, where <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> judge in a chicken-cleaning contest," [...] to which Benny joyously declared, [...] "I'm king for a day!" [...] At this point a professional pressing-iron was wheeled on stage, to press Benny's suit properly. It didn't matter that Benny was still in the suit. Allen instructed his aides to remove Benny's suit, one item at a time, ending with his trousers, each garment's removal provoking louder laughter from the studio audience. As his trousers began to come off, Benny howled, [...] "Allen, you haven't seen the end of me!" [...] At once Allen shot back, [...] "It won't be long now!" ...|$|E
