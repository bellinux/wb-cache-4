5|$|The {{first known}} fossils of the closely related Mapusaurus {{were found in}} a bonebed {{consisting}} of several individuals at different growth stages. In their 2006 description of the genus, Coria and Currie suggested that though this {{could be due to}} a long term or coincidental accumulation of carcasses, the presence of different growth stages of the same taxon indicated the aggregation was not coincidental. In a 2006 National Geographic article, Coria stated that the bonebed was probably the result of a catastrophic event, and that the presence of mainly medium-sized individuals, with very few <b>young</b> <b>or</b> <b>old,</b> is normal for animals that form packs. Therefore, Coria said, large theropods may have hunted in groups, which would be advantageous when hunting gigantic sauropods.|$|E

25|$|About 80 {{percent of}} {{patients}} are adolescents when they first experience KLS. On some occasions though, its first occurrence comes in childhood or adulthood. In most adolescent-onset patients, symptoms cease {{by the time they}} are 30 years old. A French study of 108 patients found a median duration of 13 years, but a review of 186 cases found a median duration of 8 years. Unusually <b>young</b> <b>or</b> <b>old</b> patients and those who experience hypersexuality tend to have a more severe course. Patients who initially have frequent attacks generally see the disease cease earlier than others. The condition spontaneously resolves, and the patient is considered to be cured if there have been no symptoms for six years.|$|E

2500|$|Then {{he writes}} of {{another kind of}} truth. There is another kind of truth or, if this is humbler, another kind of truths that could be called {{concerned}} truths. They do not live on a lofty plane, {{for the simple reason}} that, ashamed, as it were, they are conscious of not applying universally to all occasions but only specifically to particular occasions. They are not indifferent to the single individual's particular condition, whether he is <b>young</b> <b>or</b> <b>old,</b> happy or dejected, because this determines for them whether they are to be truths for him. Neither do they promptly let go of the individual and forsake him, but they continue to be concerned about him until he himself completely breaks away, and even to this they are not indifferent, although he is not able to make these truths doubtful about themselves. Such a truth is not indifferent to how the individual received it, whether he wholeheartedly appropriates it or it becomes mere words to him. This very difference certainly shows that it is jealous of itself, is not indifferent to whether the truth becomes a blessing or a ruination to him, since this contrary decision witnesses specifically against the equal validity; it is not indifferent to whether he honestly places his confidence in it or whether, himself deceived, he wants to deceive others, since this avenging wrath expressly shows that it is not indifferent. Such a concerned truth is not independent of the one who has propounded it; on the contrary, he remains present in it continually in order in turn to concern himself about the single individual.
