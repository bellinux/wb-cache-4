5|$|The {{majority}} of woodpeckers are sedentary {{but there are}} a few examples of migratory species such as the rufous-bellied woodpecker and <b>yellow-bellied</b> <b>sapsucker,</b> and the Eurasian wryneck breeds in Europe and west Asia and migrates to the Sahel in Africa in the winter. More northerly populations of Lewis's woodpecker, northern flicker, Williamson's sapsucker, red-breasted sapsucker and red-naped sapsucker all move southwards in the fall in North America. Most woodpecker movements can be described as dispersive, such as when young birds seek territories after fledging, or eruptive, to escape harsh weather conditions. Several species are altitudinal migrants, for example the grey-capped woodpecker, which moves to lowlands from hills during the winter months. The woodpeckers that do migrate do so during the day.|$|E
25|$|Pignut hickory {{is easily}} damaged by fire, which causes stem degrade {{or loss of}} volume, or both. Internal discolorations called mineral streak are common and are one major reason why so few {{standing}} hickories meet trade specifications. Streaks result from <b>yellow-bellied</b> <b>sapsucker</b> pecking, pin knots, worm holes, and mechanical injuries. Hickories strongly resist ice damage and seldom develop epicormic branches.|$|E
25|$|Nyssa sylvatica is an {{important}} food source for many migrating birds in the fall. Its early color change (foliar fruit flagging) is thought to attract birds to the available fruit, which ripen before many other fall fruits and berries. The fruit is quite marked, dark blue, in clusters of two or three. The sour fruits are eagerly sought by many kinds of birds, including: American robin, Swainson's thrush, gray-cheeked thrush, hermit thrush, wood thrush, northern cardinal, northern mockingbird, blue jay, red-bellied woodpecker, <b>yellow-bellied</b> <b>sapsucker,</b> northern flicker, pileated woodpecker, eastern phoebe, brown thrasher, eastern bluebird, European starling, scarlet tanager, gray catbird, cedar waxwing, and American crow, all primarily eastern North American birds migrating or residing year-round within the tree's range.|$|E
50|$|Because <b>yellow-bellied</b> <b>sapsuckers</b> feed {{on up to}} 250 {{species of}} living trees and woody plants, they are {{sometimes}} {{considered to be a}} pest. The birds can cause serious damage to trees, and intensive feeding has been documented as a source of tree mortality. Sapsucker feeding can kill a tree by girdling, which occurs when a ring of bark around the trunk is severely injured. Certain tree species are particularly susceptible to dying after being damaged by <b>yellow-bellied</b> <b>sapsuckers.</b> For example, a USDA forest study that examined trees injured by <b>yellow-bellied</b> <b>sapsuckers</b> noted a mortality of 67% for gray birch (Betula populifolia), 51% for paper birch (Betula papyrifera), and 40% for red maple (Acer rubrum). In other tree species, injuries inflicted by <b>yellow-bellied</b> <b>sapsuckers</b> can result in significantly less mortality. The USDA study noted that only 3% of Red Spruce (Picea rubens) and 1% of Hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) that were injured by sapsuckers succumbed to their wounds.|$|R
50|$|In the United States, <b>yellow-bellied</b> <b>sapsuckers</b> {{are listed}} and {{protected}} under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Taking, killing, or possessing this species is illegal without a permit.|$|R
50|$|In orchards, the USDA {{recommends}} allowing <b>yellow-bellied</b> <b>sapsuckers</b> to {{feed upon}} their preferred tree(s), suggesting the birds will focus {{their attention on}} these and spare {{the rest of the}} orchard from serious damage. Non-lethal deterrents can also be applied to trees to ward off the birds, including burlap wraps and bird tanglefoot (a type of sticky repellent). In commercial aspen plantations, <b>yellow-bellied</b> <b>sapsuckers</b> can be drawn to a stand by individual trees infested by the fungus Fomes igniarius. Infested trees are prone to heartwood decay, which provides prime habitat for sapsuckers to carve nesting holes. Therefore, infested trees should be eliminated to prevent colonization of commercial aspen stands by sapsuckers.|$|R
500|$|Worlds End State Park is {{featured}} in the Audubon Society's Susquehanna River Birding and Wildlife Trail Guide. Birds {{of interest in the}} park include common mergansers along the creek and other riparian species such as belted kingfisher, as well as barred, great horned, and the scarce, elusive northern saw-whet owls. Other avian species seen in the park and believed to nest there include tufted titmouse, brown creeper, red-breasted nuthatch, common raven, scarlet tanager, <b>yellow-bellied</b> <b>sapsucker,</b> and winter wren. These bird populations are typical of [...] "mature northern hardwood-hemlock forests and high elevation swamps and conifer swamps".|$|E
500|$|Ricketts Glen State Park has {{extensive}} acreage of [...] "interior forest" [...] that is {{far from}} open space; several bird species that are area-sensitive are found within these forests in the park, including the black-throated green warbler, red-eyed vireo, dark-eyed junco and black-capped chickadee. Two species of owl, barred and northern saw-whet, inhabit the deep forests. The hemlock forests of the glens are home to the Louisiana waterthrush, Acadian flycatcher, Blackburnian warbler, blue-headed vireo, magnolia warbler, brown creeper, golden-crowned kinglet and winter wren. Wood thrush {{are found in the}} lower elevations of the park and are replaced within the ecosystem by hermit thrush at the higher elevations. The Canada warbler and black-throated blue warbler are on several watchlists, but are common within the park. The Canada warbler inhabits blueberry thickets with white-throated sparrow, while the black-throated blue warbler is found in the forests atop the plateau with the least flycatcher. Common raven are regularly seen soaring over the forests of the park looking for carrion. Canada goose are present in the park and have been classified as a [...] "pest" [...] due to their high numbers and the large amount of fecal waste they leave on the shores of Lake Jean. Ricketts Glen's forests also support populations of [...] Nashville and yellow-rumped warblers, <b>yellow-bellied</b> <b>sapsucker,</b> red-breasted nuthatch, and purple finch.|$|E

50|$|The red-naped sapsucker {{is one of}} four North American {{woodpeckers}} in {{the genus}} Sphyrapicus. It has no subspecies. First described by Spencer Fullerton Baird in 1858, it was initially thought to be a subspecies of the <b>yellow-bellied</b> <b>sapsucker.</b> However, there are significant genetic differences between this species and the <b>yellow-bellied</b> <b>sapsucker,</b> and the American Ornithologists' Union recognized it as a distinct species in the seventh edition of its North American birds checklist, published in 1998. Genetic analysis has shown that the red-naped sapsucker is a sister species with (and very closely related to) the red-breasted sapsucker, and that these two species form a superspecies with the <b>yellow-bellied</b> <b>sapsucker.</b> All three species are known to hybridize with each other, with hybrids between red-naped and red-breasted sapsuckers proving particularly common.|$|E
5000|$|Because sapsuckers attack living trees, {{they are}} often {{considered}} a pest species. [...] Intensive feeding by sapsuckers is a cause of severe tree damage and mortality, with certain tree species more adversely affected by feeding than others. A USDA Forest Service study found that 67 percent of gray birch (Betula populifolia) trees damaged by <b>yellow-bellied</b> <b>sapsuckers</b> later died of their injuries. This compares to a mortality of 51 percent for paper birch (Betula papyrifera), 40 percent for red maple (Acer rubrum), 3 percent for red spruce (Picea rubens), and 1 percent for hemlock (Tsuga canadensis).|$|R
40|$|We {{developed}} time-activity {{budgets for}} 286 <b>Yellow-bellied</b> <b>Sapsuckers</b> (Sphyrapicus varius) from October 2005 / 2006 to March 2006 / 2007 in east Texas bottomland hardwood forests. Behaviors were similar between genders and study sites (P 3 ̆e 0. 05), but varied (P = 0. 008) between years. Sapsuckers {{spent more time}} foraging upon arrival in wintering areas and during morning throughout the study periods. Deviation from monthly average low temperature was an important (P = 0. 038) covariate during the second study year, when sapsuckers increased time spent foraging during colder than average temperatures and increased time perching on days with warmer than average temperatures. Sapsuckers partitioned about half their time foraging (early in the day) and half their time perching (later in the day). Sapsuckers may have little physiological need for drastic behavioral adjustments to successfully meet nutritional demands during winter in areas with mild climates...|$|R
50|$|Coates is an 80-acre {{conservation}} area located north of Calmar in Leduc County, near Edmonton. The natural area was donated to EALT by Ethel Coates. The area consists {{almost entirely of}} parkland forest, a habitat that is rapidly disappearing. It is located within an Environmentally Significant Area of Regional Importance and High Sensitivity. The area is located within the Willow Creek wildlife corridor, which provides both habitat {{and access to the}} North Saskatchewan River for moose, coyote, beaver, porcupine, wood frogs, crayfish, red-tailed hawks, great blue herons, <b>yellow-bellied</b> <b>sapsuckers,</b> mourning doves, eastern phoebes, ravens and chickadees. Coates is covered by mixedwoods forest including aspen, poplar, birch and spruce tree species as well as red-osier dogwood, prickly rose, wild raspberry, honeysuckle and fern species. The area contains a creek and adjacent plants such as willows, bullrushes, reeds and sedges. Also in the area is a white spruce forest with fairybells, wintergreen, twinflower, wild strawberry and stair-step moss. The area is rated as having high potential for historic resources by Alberta Culture and Community Spirit due to hadrosaur footprints, albertosaurus skin impressions and dinosaur bones that were extracted in the 1990s.|$|R

5000|$|The Doub Farm {{supports}} abundant wildlife. Large {{herds of}} deer are common. [...] "Piebald" [...] deer are occasionally seen. Peyton Doub has noted {{over the years}} numerous groundhogs, skunks, possums, cottontail rabbits, red and yellow foxes, and coyotes. Increasing numbers of grey squirrels are present, likely resulting from the many oaks that the Doubs have planted on the property. Mr. Doub, an avid birder, has noted most common birds of Maryland on the property. Especially common are northern cardinals, blue jays, eastern bluebirds, northern starlings, house finches, song sparrows, chipping sparrows, northern juncos, Carolina chickadees, eastern phoebes, red bellied woodpeckers, pileated woodpeckers, <b>yellow-bellied</b> <b>sapsuckers,</b> and eastern goldfinches. Large numbers of turkey vultures often congregate on trees. Red-tailed hawks have established territories in the front pasture. Large clusters of deep groundhog burrows are present, indicative of large underground colonies. Mr. Doub also commonly sees wild turkeys and an occasional ring-neck pheasant. Venturing out at night on the Doub Farm one will frequently hear barred owls, great horned owls, and barn owls. Brian Baker, who rents and farms much of the land, has anecdotally spoken of black bears and mountain lions in the area.|$|R
40|$|This was a long, cold winter, but {{effects on}} birds were not {{particularly}} noticeable. Perhaps the relative blandness of the reports reflected the 2 ̆ 2 normal 2 ̆ 2 behavior of most birds when confronted with a cold winter and the seriousness of survival: birds were in places they should have been. Carolina Wrens may have been hit (more on that in the Spring Report), but a few species were present in higher numbers than might have been expected. Rusty and Red-winged Blackbirds and Brown-headed Cowbird were notable for higher winter numbers, as were Snow Buntings. Even more so, {{there were lots of}} Fox Sparrows, including several wintering birds, and <b>Yellow-bellied</b> <b>Sapsuckers</b> were widespread in eastern Nebraska. Winter Wrens stayed into December in force, with few reported in January. At {{the opposite end of the}} spectrum, Townsend 2 ̆ 7 s Solitaires and Red Crossbills were in low numbers, as were Common Redpolls, which adhered to their apparent alternating year appearance schedule. Encouraging was the slow but definite increase in reports of Red-shouldered Hawks in southeast Nebraska; this spring will add to the story. Rarities were unremarkable: a Bewick 2 ̆ 7 s Wren was a belated 2008 – 2009 report. There was a single Varied Thrush and a dangerously late Yellow-throated Warbler, Nebraska 2 ̆ 7 s third for December...|$|R
40|$|This {{winter was}} pretty much a rerun of last, {{although}} perhaps not as severe; I could have used last winter 2 ̆ 7 s Introduction again. If there was an overall theme, {{it would be the}} widespread occurrences of species that would not be expected to linger into late December and January. Several species of waterbirds, notably Blue-winged Teal, scoters, Ruddy Duck, Common Loon, and Homed and Red-necked Grebes were in this category. Large numbers of Western Grebes were still at Lake McConaughy in early January, and surprisingly late individuals of Black-crowned Night-Heron and Plegadis ibis were located. Mourning Doves were in good numbers in the southeast, and, among passerines, Hermit Thrushes were in good numbers, also. Late surprises among sparrows included Clay-colored, Chipping, and Field. Other daringly late passerines included two (!) Ruby-crowned Kinglets at Ogallala in February, and a Wilson 2 ̆ 7 s Warbler in December in Scotts Bluff Co. Things are happening with some woodpeckers; for the second consecutive winter, <b>Yellow-bellied</b> <b>Sapsuckers</b> were everywhere, and Pileateds continue to expand their range northward in the Missouri Valley. This was a great year for Snow Buntings, even better than last year 2 ̆ 7 s good showing. Rarities were scarce; prominent of course was the carryover Ross 2 ̆ 7 s Gull from fall, but almost unbelievable was another Ross 2 ̆ 7 s Gull in Lancaster Co. in early December while the Gavins Point bird was still present.

The pine grosbeak, as a pest, generally affects Scots pine but also affects eastern white and red pine as well as spruce trees. The <b>yellow-bellied</b> <b>sapsucker,</b> as a Christmas tree pest, is hosted by Scots and Austrian pine trees. The sapsuckers peck holes in sapling bark causing sap to bleed out: potentially killing the trees and allowing insects and pathogens to enter.|$|E
