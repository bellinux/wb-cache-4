5|$|Cassel was {{annexed to}} France the {{following}} <b>year</b> <b>under</b> {{the terms of}} the Treaty of Nijmegen, which ended the war. The annexation led to the town's defences being dismantled; it was considered indefensible, as it was within easy firing range of the nearby Mont des Récollets, and it would have cost far too much to fortify both hills. In addition, the revised frontier following the treaty was now a significant distance from Cassel and without the proximity of the border, the town was no longer seen as having much strategic significance.|$|E

At this point, {{the memory of the}} old general evidently diminished, for the king gave him a major general to assist his command. On 29 October 1762 at the Battle of Freiberg, the last great battle of the Seven Years' War, he could not participate as planned, since his replacement had not yet arrived, but he advanced to Pretzschendorf after the battle.|$|E

5|$|The Welsh {{performance}} during the 1893 Home Nations Championship was {{in stark contrast}} to the previous <b>year.</b> <b>Under</b> the captaincy of Gould, Wales not only won the Championship for the first time, but also the Triple Crown. The first match of the campaign was against England, and played at the Cardiff Arms Park. The pitch had been kept from freezing over the night before by 500 braziers dispersed across the playing field. This led to a slippery ground, with play further hampered by a strong wind.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} of a three-field rotation system for planting crops increased the usage of land from one half in use each <b>year</b> <b>under</b> the old two-field system to two-thirds under the new system, with a consequent increase in production. The {{development of}} the heavy plough allowed heavier soils to be farmed more efficiently, aided by {{the spread of the}} horse collar, which led to the use of draught horses in place of oxen. Horses are faster than oxen and require less pasture, factors that aided the implementation of the three-field system.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship had}} been reduced to the II Reserve by 1895. From 1902, she was {{employed}} as a training ship for naval cadets, a role she filled until 1914.
