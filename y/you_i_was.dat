25|$|In 1975 Milligan fathered a son, James (born June 1976), in {{an affair}} with Margaret Maughan. Another child, a {{daughter}} Romany, is suspected {{to have been born}} at the same time, to a Canadian journalist named Roberta Watt. His last wife was Shelagh Sinclair, to whom he was married from 1983 to his death on 27 February 2002. Four of his children collaborated with documentary makers on a multi-platform programme called I Told <b>You</b> <b>I</b> <b>Was</b> Ill: The Life and Legacy of Spike Milligan (2005), which then included an accompanying website (www.spikemilliganlegacy.com).|$|E

When I send a bit of investigation to Edinburgh, the W. H. of that ilk says I took it from him. When I send you one, you take it from me, generalize it at a glance, bestow it thus generalized upon society at large, and make me the second discoverer of a known theorem.|$|E
500|$|... "The New Cup" [...] {{received}} largely positive {{reviews from}} critics, with many noting {{that both the}} episode's plot and songs were particularly strong. According to Nielsen Media Research, on its initial broadcast, [...] "The New Cup" [...] was watched by over 500,000 people. Two songs from the episode, [...] "Sugalumps" [...] and [...] "You Don't Have to be a Prostitute", received positive critical acclaim and were later included on the band's second album I Told <b>You</b> <b>I</b> <b>Was</b> Freaky.|$|E

500|$|Texans {{knew of the}} {{oil that}} lay beneath {{the ground in the}} state for decades, but this was often seen more as a problem than a benefit because it {{hindered}} the digging of water wells. Rancher William Thomas Waggoner (1852–1934), who later became an influential oil businessman in Fort Worth, struck oil while drilling for water in 1902. He was quoted as having said, [...] "I wanted water, and they got me oil. I tell <b>you</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> mad, mad clean through. We needed water for ourselves and for our cattle to drink." ...|$|E

I had a body suit on underneath my clothes, so there's a little fun fact for <b>you.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> trying not to break my focus pretty much the entire shoot, because I was really in that zone – thinking a lot about the position I was in a year ago... thinking about the situation and how much I wanted to get all that emotion off my chest." ...|$|E
500|$|Separate {{awards for}} Best Hard Rock Performance and Best Metal Performance were {{introduced}} in 1990. Beginning that year, Metallica won three consecutive Grammy Awards for Best Metal Performance for the song [...] "One" [...] from ...And Justice for All, their cover of Queen's [...] "Stone Cold Crazy", and their eponymous album in 1992. When Metallica won the Grammy in 1992, drummer Lars Ulrich referenced the previous award by facetiously [...] "thanking" [...] Jethro Tull for not putting out an album that year, though they actually had released the album Catfish Rising in 1991. A decade after Jethro Tull defeated Metallica, Ulrich admitted: [...] "I'd be lying if I didn't tell <b>you</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> disappointed. Human nature is that you'd rather win than lose, but Jethro Tull walking away with it makes a huge mockery of {{the intentions of the}} event." [...] As of 2010, Metallica holds the record for the most wins in the metal category, with a total of six.|$|E

500|$|Having seen Black Mischief {{launched}} to mixed {{but generally}} favourable critical comment (Oldmeadow's intervention was not immediate), Waugh sailed from Tilbury on 2 December 1932. He arrived in British Guiana on 23 December, and after some days of indecision opted {{to accompany the}} district commissioner for Rupununi, on a journey into the interior. He hoped that he might reach Manaus, a large city deep within the Brazilian jungle, but transport proved unreliable, and he got {{no further than the}} border town of Boa Vista. On the way, at one of his overnight stopping points, he encountered Mr Christie, an elderly mixed-race settler who greeted him by saying, [...] "I was expecting <b>you.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> warned in a vision of your approach". The two enjoyed an agreeable dinner together, where Christie talked of the [...] "Fifth Kingdom" [...] (a biblical prophecy from the Book of Daniel). He told Waugh that he had seen the entire gathering of the saints in heaven—surprisingly few, he said—but could not count them because they were incorporeal. Waugh added Christie to his [...] "treasury of eccentrics", set aside for future literary use.|$|E
500|$|Nhu's agents soon {{reported}} Có's {{activities to}} the palace. When the Ngô brothers confronted Đính with what occurred in Mỹ Tho, Đính feigned astonishment at his deputy's behaviour. He began crying and said [...] "This is my fault, {{because you have}} suspected me. I have not really gone {{to work for the}} last 15 days but have stayed at home because I was sad. But I am not against <b>you.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> sad because I thought I was discredited with you. So Nguyễn Hữu Có profited from my absence to make trouble." [...] Đính claimed to know nothing of Có's activities and vowed to have his deputy killed. Nhu opposed this and stated that he wanted keep Có alive to catch the plotters, and tried to use Đính to this end. Nhu ordered Đính and Tung, both of whom took their orders directly from the palace instead of the ARVN command, to plan a fake coup against the government. One objective was to trick dissidents into joining the false uprising so that they could be identified and eliminated. Another aim of the public relations stunt was to give a false impression of the strength of the regime.|$|E
500|$|In {{the season}} opener at #12 California, he caught one pass for 28yards and made two rushing {{attempts}} for 16yards. Against Division I FCS James Madison, Smith caught eight passes for 80yards, rushed twice for 22yards and a touchdown, and returned four kickoffs 127yards, including one 81-yard touchdown return. Despite the strong statistical performance, head coach Ralph Friedgen said, [...] "To be honest with <b>you,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> kind of expecting more out of Torrey. I've {{got a lot of}} faith in him. I'm not surprised at all about the return yards. But I think if you asked Torrey, he has high expectations for himself, too." [...] Smith agreed with the criticism, and acknowledged that in his second season as a wide receiver, he had room for improvement. He recorded five catches for 165yards and two touchdowns in the Middle Tennessee game, and caught four passes for 112yards against Rutgers. He led the team with three receptions for 64yards and a 29-yard touchdown against Clemson, and became the first player in the nation to reach 1,000all-purpose yards on the season. Against Wake Forest, Smith returned six kickoffs 194yards and caught a career-high ten passes for 70yards and a touchdown. For his performance, he was named the Atlantic Coast Conference Specialist of the Week. Wake Forest head coach Jim Grobe said, [...] "This kid is probably a better receiver [...] He catches the ball better, he's got great foot speed. He can hurt you running the ball or catching it. Everywhere you look, he's a problem." ...|$|E

2500|$|One of the band's songs {{entitled}} [...] "Blow Your House Down" [...] {{was featured}} in a Hollywood CGI animated film Hoodwinked, from The Weinstein Company. An instrumental version of the song was played {{in the background of}} the Granny Xtreme skiing scene. The film's soundtrack was released under Rykodisc. Most animations and visuals of Hoodwinked were created and processed at Digital Eye Candy, Makati City. One of the head animators behind the Hoodwinked team, Gorio Vicuna, is the one who designed and directed the album cover and sleeve layout of [...] "Beautiful Machines” album. A line in the lyrics of the song says “no one told <b>you</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> abroad”, which in turn, the song was actually used in an international movie.|$|E

On the day of his funeral, 8 March 2002, his coffin was carried to St Thomas Church in Winchelsea, East Sussex, and was draped in the flag of Ireland. He had once quipped that he wanted his headstone to bear the words [...] "I told <b>you</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> ill." [...] He was buried at St Thomas' churchyard but the Chichester diocese refused to allow this epitaph. A {{compromise}} was reached with the Irish translation, Dúirt mé leat go raibh mé breoite and in English, [...] "Love, light, peace". The additional epitaph [...] "Grá mór ort Shelagh" [...] can be read as [...] "Great love for you Shelagh".|$|E

Terence [...] "Spike" [...] Milligan died on 27 February 2002, aged 83; Secombe ended up singing at his funeral anyway, as a recording. Two years later Milligan's wish to have the words [...] "I told <b>you</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> ill" [...] inscribed on his gravestone was finally granted, although the church would only agree if the words were written in Irish, as Dúirt mé leat go raibh mé breoite.|$|E
