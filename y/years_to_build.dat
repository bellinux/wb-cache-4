5|$|Since {{the convent}} school {{was small and}} only temporary, the next order of {{business}} was to build the actual school. The parochial school took ten <b>years</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> (1950–1960). This building also consists of three floors and is covered with red sandstone in the front. The rear of the building is made of white Pennsylvania sandstone. There is a bell tower on the building.

5|$|In 1997 {{there had}} been plans for a £130 million {{combined}} cycle gas turbine power station {{on the site of}} the Ever Ready battery factory to the West of the site of the North station. AES Electrical applied to the Department of Trade and Industry for permission to build the station, which would have been twice as efficient as the coal-fired Stella stations and the first major electricity generation site built in Tyne and Wear in over 40years. The station would have had a generating capacity of 350MW. It would have taken three <b>years</b> <b>to</b> <b>build,</b> and created 400construction jobs, as well as 40full-time jobs after construction. But the proposal was opposed by the coal mining industry and dropped.|$|E

A $2million bid bond was to accompany each bid; the winner would have to post a $5million performance bond. The contractor had seven <b>years</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> the dam, or penalties would ensue.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} of both bridges was problematic, {{with both the}} first and second bridges requiring several redesigns from multiple architects. The original bridge, the first iron bridge over the Thames, was built by a private company and operated as a toll bridge before being taken into public ownership in 1879. The second bridge, which took eight <b>years</b> <b>to</b> <b>build,</b> was the first in London to carry trams and later one of the first two roads in London to have a bus lane.|$|E
5|$|The war was {{costly for}} Philip and the Macedonians, losing them a fleet {{that had taken}} three <b>years</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> as well as {{triggering}} the defection of their Greek allies, the Achean League and the Aetolian League, to the Romans. In the war's immediate aftermath the Dardani, a barbarian tribe, swarmed across the northern border of Macedon, but Philip was able to repel this attack. In 197, however, Philip was defeated in the Battle of Cynoscephalae by the Romans {{and was forced to}} surrender. This defeat cost Philip most of his territory outside Macedon and he had to pay a war indemnity of 1,000 talents of silver to the Romans.|$|E

5|$|After {{the end of}} the Russian Civil War {{the victorious}} Bolsheviks {{considered}} finishing Izmail, and possibly Borodino, to their original design. It would have taken at least two <b>years</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> all of Izmails turrets, even if enough guns had been available. Ten had been delivered by Vickers before the Revolution and one gun had been completed domestically in 1912, but the prospects that more guns could be purchased from Vickers or that the Soviets could make more were not promising, given the state of their heavy industry {{in the wake of the}} Civil War. Another problem was the complicated electrical system; it could not be completed under current conditions, and at least twenty months would be required to replace it with a simpler system.|$|E
5|$|In {{the period}} of unmistakable Turkish danger and the fall of Bosnia under Turkish rule, a {{detached}} fortress providing additional protection to the land approach to the eastern Ploče Gate was built {{to the east of}} the city in 1462. The name Revelin derives from rivelino (ravelin), a term in military architecture which refers to work built opposite the city gate in order to afford better protection from enemy attack. Danger of Venetian assault suddenly increased in the times of the First Holy League, and it was necessary to strengthen this vulnerable point of the city fortifications. The Senate hired Antonio Ferramolino, an experienced builder of fortresses {{in the service of the}} Spanish admiral Doria, a trusted friend of the Republic. In 1538 the Senate approved his drawings of the new, much stronger Revelin Fortress. It took 11 <b>years</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> it, and during that time all other construction work in the city had stopped in order to finish this fortress as soon as possible.|$|E
5|$|It was {{possibly}} after the defences were finished that Urbicus {{turned his attention}} upon the fourth lowland Scottish tribe, the Novantae who inhabited the Dumfries and Galloway peninsula. The main lowland tribes, sandwiched as they were between Hadrian's Wall of stone {{to the south and}} the new turf wall to the north, later formed a confederation against Roman rule, collectively known as the Maeatae. The Antonine Wall had a variety of purposes. It provided a defensive line against the Caledonians. It cut off the Maeatae from their Caledonian allies and created a buffer zone north of Hadrian's Wall. It also facilitated troop movements between east and west, but its main purpose may not have been primarily military. It enabled Rome to control and tax trade and may have prevented potentially disloyal new subjects of Roman rule from communicating with their independent brethren to the north and coordinating revolts. Urbicus achieved an impressive series of military successes, but like Agricola's they were short-lived. Having taken twelve <b>years</b> <b>to</b> <b>build,</b> the wall was overrun and abandoned soon after 160.|$|E

5|$|On 6August1860 the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway (A), {{with the}} 3rd Duke (then still Marquess of Chandos) as {{chairman}} and Sir Harry Verney as deputy chairman, was incorporated by Act of Parliament with the object of connecting the Buckinghamshire Railway (by now operated by the LNWR) to Aylesbury. The 2nd Duke used his influence to ensure the new route would run via Quainton, near his remaining estates around Wotton, instead of the intended more direct route via Pitchcott. Beset by financial difficulties, the line took over eight <b>years</b> <b>to</b> <b>build,</b> eventually opening on 23September1868. The new line {{was connected to the}} Wycombe Railway's Aylesbury station, and joined the existing Buckinghamshire Railway lines {{at the point where the}} Oxford–Bletchley line and the line to Buckingham already met. Verney Junction railway station was built at the point where the lines joined, named after Sir Harry who owned the land on which it was built, since there was no nearby town. Aylesbury now had railways to the east, north and southwest, but no line southeast towards London and the Channel ports.|$|E

5|$|Stone keep {{construction}} required skilled craftsmen. Unlike {{timber and}} earthworks, {{which could be}} built using unfree labour or serfs, these craftsmen had to be paid and stone keeps were therefore expensive. They were also relatively slow to erect, due to {{the limitations of the}} lime mortar used during the period – a keep's walls could usually be raised by a maximum of only 12 feet (3.6 metres) a year; the keep at Scarborough was not atypical in taking ten <b>years</b> <b>to</b> <b>build.</b> The number of such keeps remained relatively low: in England, for example, although several early stone keeps had been built after the conquest, there were only somewhere between ten and fifteen in existence by 1100, and only around a hundred had been built by 1216.|$|E

5|$|The {{construction}} of the aqueduct has long been credited to the Roman emperor Augustus' son-in-law and aide, Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, around the year 19 BC. At the time, he was serving as aedile, the senior magistrate responsible for managing the water supply of Rome and its colonies. Espérandieu, writing in 1926, linked the {{construction of}} the aqueduct with Agrippa's visit to Narbonensis in that year. Newer excavations suggest the construction may have taken place between 40 and 60 AD. Tunnels dating from the time of Augustus had to be bypassed by the builders of the Nîmes aqueduct, and coins discovered in the outflow in Nîmes are no older than the reign of the emperor Claudius (41–54 AD). On this basis, a team led by Guilhem Fabre has argued that the aqueduct must have been completed around the middle of the 1st century AD. It is believed to have taken about fifteen <b>years</b> <b>to</b> <b>build,</b> employing between 800 and 1,000 workers.|$|E
5|$|Wodehouse worked {{extensively}} on his books, sometimes having {{two or more}} in preparation simultaneously. He would take up to two <b>years</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> a plot and write a scenario of about thirty thousand words. After the scenario was complete he would write the story. Early in his career he would produce a novel in about three months, but he slowed in old age to around six months. He used a mixture of Edwardian slang, quotations from and allusions to numerous poets, and several literary techniques to produce a prose style that has been compared with comic poetry and musical comedy. Some critics of Wodehouse have considered his work flippant, but among his fans are former British prime ministers {{and many of his}} fellow writers.|$|E
5|$|Regardless of the sequencing, {{artificial}} mottes {{had to be}} {{built by}} piling up earth; this work was undertaken by hand, using wooden shovels and hand-barrows, possibly with picks {{as well in the}} later periods. Larger mottes took disproportionately more effort to build than their smaller equivalents, because of the volumes of earth involved. The largest mottes in England, such as Thetford, are estimated to have required up to 24,000 man-days of work; smaller ones required perhaps as little as 1,000. Contemporary accounts talk of some mottes being built in a matter of days, although these low figures have led to suggestions by historians that either these figures were an underestimate, or that they refer to the construction of a smaller design than that later seen on the sites concerned. Taking into account estimates of the likely available manpower during the period, historians estimate that the larger mottes might have taken between four and nine months to build. This contrasted favourably with stone keeps of the period, which typically took up to ten <b>years</b> <b>to</b> <b>build.</b> Very little skilled labour was required to build motte and bailey castles, which made them very attractive propositions if forced peasant labour was available, as was the case after the Norman invasion of England. Where the local workforce had to be paid – such as at Clones in Ireland, built in 1211 using imported labourers – the costs would rise quickly, in this case reaching £20.|$|E
