He allegedly threatened their mother, Kathleen Mulhall saying [...] "I'm going to fucking kill <b>you,</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> I did with Raonaid Murray", although he was allegedly drunk at the time. Noor, who was questioned during the initial investigation, has since been ruled out; Gardaí believe he claimed responsibility to upset Mulhall.|$|E

60|$|What is it? a {{piece of}} old mortar? Yes. But mortar which was made Madam How herself, and not by any man. And what is in it? A piece of flint and some bits of bone. But look at that piece of flint. It is narrow, thin, sharp-edged: quite {{different}} in shape from any bit of flint which you or I ever saw {{among the hundreds of}} thousands of broken bits of gravel which we tread on here all day long; and here are some more bits like it, which came from the same place--all very much the same shape, like rough knives or razor blades; and here is a core of flint, the remaining part of a large flint, from which, as you may see, blades like those have been split off. Those flakes of flint, my child, were split off by men; even your young eyes ought to be able to see that. And here are other pieces of flint--pear-shaped, but flattened, sharp at one end and left rounded at the other, which look like spear-heads, or arrow-heads, or pointed axes, or pointed hatchets--even your young eyes can see that these must have been made by man. And they are, I may tell <b>you,</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> the tools of flint, or of obsidian, which is volcanic glass, and which savages use still where they have not iron. There is a great obsidian knife, you know, in a house in this very parish, which came from Mexico; and your eye can tell you how like it is to these flint ones. But these flint tools are very old. If you crack a fresh flint, you will see that its surface is gray, and somewhat rough, so that it sticks to your tongue. These tools are smooth and shiny: and the edges of some of them are a little rubbed from being washed about in gravel; while the iron in the gravel has stained them reddish, which it would take hundreds and perhaps thousands of years to do. There are little rough markings, too, upon some of them, which, if you look at through a magnifying glass, are iron, crystallised into the shape of little sea- weeds and trees--another sign that they are very very old. And what is more, near the place where these flint flakes come from there are no flints in the ground for hundreds of miles; so that men must have brought them there ages and ages since. And to tell you plainly, these are scrapers such as the Esquimaux in North America still use to scrape the flesh off bones, and to clean the insides of skins.|$|E

The first on-air presenter, DJ Holger Brockmann, notably used his own name (a deliberate reference to his former work for top-rated Sydney pop station 2SM). Owing to 2SM's restrictive policies at the time, Brockmann, whose real name was considered [...] "too foreign-sounding", {{had been forced to}} work using the pseudonym [...] "Bill Drake" [...] in prior positions. After an introductory audio collage that featured sounds from the countdown and launch of Apollo 11, Brockmann launched the station's first-ever broadcast with the words, [...] "Wow, and we're away!", and then cued The Skyhooks' <b>You</b> <b>Just</b> <b>Like</b> Me 'Cos I'm Good in Bed.|$|E

5000|$|.....if {{you want}} to read my lyrics for the subtexts and hear us as a {{political}} band, you can certainly do that and you can practically get a reading list from our songs (Ibn Rushd, Omar Khayyam, George Orwell, Victor Serge, Arjun Appadurai, Ramin Jahanbegloo, Salman Rushdie, Slavoj Žižek, just to give you the short list). But if <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> the music, that works too. You don't have to know who Akbar Ganji and Zakia Zaki are to appreciate 'When Worlds Collide' by us ... it is form or melody that succeeds first--if the more thought out ideas and agendas work too, they are only able to do so because the rest is already in place and one's appreciation of one shouldn't condition too much your ability to appreciate the other.http://nimany.com/news/2008/01/nimany-post-punk-music-scene.html ...|$|E
5000|$|As {{with most}} Johnson songs, [...] "Stop Breakin' Down Blues" [...] failed to {{generate}} much interest with the blues record buying public {{when it was}} released. However, his work was kept alive by a [...] "small circle of Mississippi peers" [...] with interpretations recorded by other blues artists. In 1945, Sonny Boy Williamson I recorded his version as an early Chicago blues with Big Maceo (piano), Tampa Red (guitar), and Charles Sanders (drums) (RCA Victor 20-3047). Titled [...] "Stop Breaking Down", the song featured somewhat different lyrics, including the refrain [...] "I don't believe you really really love me, I think <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> the way my music sounds" [...] in place of Johnson's [...] "The stuff I got it gon' bust your brains out, hoo hoo, it'll make you lose your mind".
