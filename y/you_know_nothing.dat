Harris tells the children not to be afraid to tell someone {{if they have been}} improperly touched, saying, [...] "Some people don't act right with kids, and they need help. You can't protect them from trouble that they themselves have caused, and it's better to say something so that you and the family can get the help you need. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>nothing</b> gets better by keeping quiet about it." [...] Harris says that, if it is difficult to explain where they have been touched, they can draw a picture or point to the place on a doll. The film ends with [...] "My Body" [...] sung by a group of people including Harris, two police officers, and some children.|$|E
500|$|While {{the editor}} of Personal Computer World was on holiday in May 1981, his colleagues publicised the magazine's review of the ZX81 with a cover showing a {{chimpanzee}} with the machine above the strapline [...] "Editor benchtests the ZX81". (The chimp returned in later issues to [...] "benchtest" [...] all of Sinclair's subsequent computers.) The review, which was written by PCW staffer Dave Tebbutt, acknowledged that the machine had significant shortcomings but nonetheless represented [...] "absolutely amazing value for money". He described the ZX81 as [...] "a lovely product which will have enormous appeal to people wanting {{to find out more}} about computers, but without it costing them an arm and a leg" [...] and concluded: [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>nothing</b> about computers and you want to enjoy finding out about them, then this machine offers a value for money way of doing just that. Children will love the ZX81, there can be no question about that, and I suspect that more than a few people who are already familiar with computers will buy one, just to have a bit of fun." ...|$|E
500|$|The album's cover art (known as the 'Screaming Elf') is a {{distorted}} {{photograph of the}} band members, photographed by Kevin Westenberg, above {{a black and white}} upside-down burning forest. Concerning the artwork, Cornell said, [...] "Superunknown relates to birth in a way... Being born or even dying—getting flushed into something that <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>nothing</b> about. The hardest thing is to nail down a visual image to put on a title like that. The first thing we thought of was a forest in grey or black. Soundgarden has always been associated with images of flowers and lush colors and this was the opposite. It still seemed organic but it was very dark and cold... I was into those stories as a kid where forests were full of evil and scary things as opposed to being happy gardens that you go camping in." [...] In a 1994 Pulse! magazine interview, Cornell said that the inspiration for the album's title came from his misreading of a video entitled Superclown. He added, [...] "I thought it was a cool title. I'd never heard it before, never saw it before, and it inspired me." [...] The album also saw a limited release on 12" [...] colored vinyl (blue, orange, and clear), as a double-LP in a gatefold sleeve. The album's title 'SUPERUNKNOWN' is sometimes displayed with the [...] "UNKNOWN" [...] as semi upside down and reversed lettering (stylized as [...] "SUPER∩ИKИOWИ").|$|E

2500|$|During late 2014 {{and early}} 2015, the band moved {{recording}} and production over to Montreal, Quebec, at the Golden Ratio Studios, where they worked with Canadian music producer Damian Taylor, {{who had previously}} worked with American rock band The Killers on their 2011 album Battle Born, and as a creative companion to Icelandic musician Björk. An initial version of the album with 13 tracks was tracked {{at the end of}} April 2015, however, the creative process continued when additional songs were written and recorded for the album. Numerous delays pushed the recording and production of the album well into 2015, despite an open declaration early in that year, by Mandagi, that the album would be soon completed. By then, the band had collaborated with European producer Pascal Gabriel, co-writer and producer of various Marina and the Diamonds and Goldfrapp tracks, British songwriter and producer Justin Parker, known for his work with American recording artist Lana Del Rey, and American producer Ben H. Allen, who had previously produced albums for art rock acts Animal Collective and Deerhunter. Ultimately, in October 2015, 32 months after the band started production, amassing over 40 song ideas in the process, the album's production entered the audio mixing phase. Mandagi expressed dissatisfaction with the album's lengthy recording process, though insisted that he and the band were, in contrast, satisfied with the outcome and the final product, stating, [...] "sometimes it was ok, sometimes it was a bit trying but <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>nothing</b> good comes easy we just had to keep at it. We didn't put it out until it was right, 'til we felt right." ...|$|E
