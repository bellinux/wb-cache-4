2500|$|During {{his time}} in South Carolina, Gibbs also became {{involved}} in Republican political activities during Reconstruction. Gibbs participated in a meeting of black delegates who drafted a petition demanding that the educated of both races be allowed to vote, suggesting {{he may have had}} some elitism. The petition also said, [...] "we do ask that if the ignorant white man is allowed to vote, that the ignorant colored man shall be allowed to vote also." [...] Gibbs noted that, [...] "If we can secure, for the next ten years, three clean shirts a week, a tooth brush, and spelling-book to every Freedman in South Carolina, I will go bail (a thing I seldom do) for the next hundred <b>years,</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> will have no more slavery, and both whites and blacks will be happier and better friends." ...|$|E

But as a nation, we recognize the right of all people to believe as they want and not to impose our beliefs on other people. I believe that abortion should be safe and legal in this country. I have since the time that my mom took that position when she ran in 1970 as a U.S. Senate candidate. I believe that since Roe v.

60|$|The {{comparison}} made Clement groan; and {{yet that}} canal journey had a pensive joy about it, as we sat beside our sleeping brother and conversed freely and fearlessly, as we {{had never been able}} to do for ten minutes together in all the long <b>years</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had loved one another. There was something very sweet in the knowing that, exile as he was, he and I must be all the world to one another. And so indeed it has been.

60|$|There {{is a man}} hates God, blasphemes his name, despises his being; yea, {{says there}} is no God.

He continued to be her admirer until her early death; but these two, the greatest writers of fiction in their age, were never brought together. Both were home-loving people, and Miss Austen especially was averse to publicity and popularity. She died, quietly as she had lived, at Winchester, in 1817, and was buried in the cathedral. She was a bright, attractive little woman, whose sunny qualities are unconsciously reflected in all her books.|$|E
