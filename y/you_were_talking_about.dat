2500|$|Rice {{said in a}} CNN {{interview}} about Pelosi's leadership, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> a company that was posting losing numbers, if <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> any sports team that was losing time and time again, changes would be made, right? The CEO out. The coach would be out {{and there would be}} a new strategy put in place." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hello, chatterbox," [...] {{retorted}} Redhead with {{a twinkle}} in his eyes. [...] "I didn't know <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> my family, but I could have guessed that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> some one's family. Does your tongue ever stop, Jenny?" ...|$|E
5000|$|To {{refer to}} the same person <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about,</b> like [...] "No g√ºey, no pude ir." [...] (No dude, I couldnt go).|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{what have}} <b>you</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> so long?" [...] sang Mrs. Bunting, {{with an almost}} motherly hand {{on the back of}} Melville's chair.|$|R
6000|$|... "Bah! You do {{not know}} what <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about.</b> They <b>are</b> crafty, that is all,--and half the cadets at Putnam Hall know it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Quatermain," [...] I said, [...] "don't let Good beat you, let us {{hear how}} you killed those {{elephants}} <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> this evening just after you shot the woodcocks." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Plenty, thank you,' {{replied that}} gentleman, whose poetic curiosity had been greatly {{excited by the}} last {{observation}} of his entertainer. 'I beg your pardon, but <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> {{the song of the}} Ivy.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{must say}} {{you take it}} rather cool," [...] {{declared}} Hannah, almost resentfully. [...] "You come in and tell us you're going to marry Mr. Ditmar just like <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> the weather." ...|$|E
6000|$|Do {{you know}} what <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about?</b> Love, yes. Word known to all men. Amor vero aliquid alicui bonum vult unde et ea quae concupiscimus ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You don't {{know what}} <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about,</b> <b>you</b> foolish boy," [...] said she; [...] "it {{is a very}} proper letter about things you don't understand." ...|$|R
60|$|You don't {{know what}} <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about,</b> my friend. I am {{quite willing to}} answer any gentleman in the crowd who asks an {{intelligent}} question.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "at present we couldn't keep a smelter {{big enough}} to be {{economical}} going, and I'm doubtful whether we would get much ore from the other properties <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> to Nairn." ...|$|E
6000|$|HE: [...] "It was {{accidental}} at first--indeed it was; {{and then}} I recognized your voice; and then I knew <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> me; and I {{had so much}} at stake; and I did love you so dearly!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Corey made {{an offer}} of going. Mrs. Brinkley stopped him with her fan. [...] "No--stay, Mr. Corey. Unless you wish to go. I fancy it's the people <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about,</b> and you must help me through with them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Jupiter, I {{should like}} to {{understand}} what it <b>is</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about.</b> <b>You</b> say your master is sick. Hasn't he told you what ails him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|STEVE. 'Look here, {{honestly}} I don't {{know what}} <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about.</b> <b>You</b> know, I could <b>be</b> angry with <b>you,</b> but I feel sure <b>you</b> <b>are</b> sincere.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Help me? On this theme!" [...] Sam grinned broadly. [...] "Tom, {{you don't}} know what <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about.</b> Do <b>you</b> {{know what this}} theme is on?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I said <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> me. I say it again. Oh, I haven't been blind. Day {{after day}} I've seen {{the two of}} you talking about me. Why don't you come out and say it to my face! I know you know. And I know your mind's made up to {{discharge}} me at Attu-Attu." ...|$|E
6000|$|SHE: [...] "Kill me, but don't look SO at me! It was {{accidental}} at first- -indeed it was; {{and then}} I recognized your voice; and then I knew <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> me; and I {{had so much}} at stake; and I did love you so dearly! You WILL forgive me, darling? It wasn't as if I were listening with any bad motive." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But Fanny, dear, I {{must speak}} as I find. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> clouds just now, {{and do you}} think that all this is not a cloud in my sky? Ludovic tells me that he is {{attached}} to Miss Robarts, and you tell me that she is attached to him; and I am called upon to decide between them. Her very act obliges me to do so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tut, tut, child, you do {{not know}} what <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about!</b> Your mother has given me her word, and you ought to bow to the inevitable." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'I don't {{know what}} <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about,</b> sir; {{and if you}} molest a modest young woman in the streets, I shall appeal to the town constables for protection.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Showing: this {{is making}} {{something}} understandable, or using your own example {{to demonstrate a}} skill or activity. You show what <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about,</b> <b>you</b> show by your own behavior.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{there have}} been some funny goings on. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> the monotony of our lives, but I assure you that they are {{sometimes}} quite as exciting as we wish them to be. You'd better come back to the house now, for after sundown we begin to get the fever-fog up from the marshes. There, you can see it coming across the river." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And,' said Jane, 'I should {{guess that}} Miss Ada herself knew {{something}} about it, for when I {{could not find the}} puzzle in the right-hand cupboard, she was so very unwilling that I should look into that one; she said there was nothing there but the boys' old playthings and Esther's clothes. And I do not know whether you saw how she fidgeted when <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> the quinces, before you went up.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Volkes {{saw that}} he had made a mistake. [...] "Yes, I quite {{understand}} you don't want him back," [...] he said, soothingly. [...] "I thought, perhaps, that you would like people to know how you had sacrificed yourself {{to put an end to}} the curse, and how cleverly you had managed to deceive every one. People would never believe us if we were to tell them. They would say either that you did not know what <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about,</b> or that it was empty boasting on your part." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "With disapproval. Who <b>are</b> those Puritans <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about?</b> But wait--how did {{you come}} to know so much about this family? Where did you get all this hearsay evidence?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I assure you," [...] said she, [...] "I don't {{know what}} <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about,</b> but {{apparently}} {{it is something}} dreadful; so perhaps one of us ought to go away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'About WHAT?--I don't {{know what}} <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about.</b> I think <b>you</b> <b>are</b> sick or crazy or something. But anyway, you're awake, and I'll {{get to sleep}} while I've got a chance.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now," [...] said she, with a vivacious little laugh, [...] "I {{have poured}} out my whole soul before you, and, in return, I {{want you to}} gratify a curiosity which is fairly eating me up. Why were you so anxious to find my Cousin Junius? And how {{did you happen to}} come here the very day after he arrived? And, more than that, how was it that you had seen him at Midbranch so recently? <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> it last night. It couldn't have been my letter from Howlett's that brought you down here?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I had to {{say what}} I thought," [...] she {{continued}} earnestly; [...] "I stood {{it as long as}} I could. Perhaps you didn't realize it, but my father was striking at me when he referred to your sermon, and spiritual control--and in other things he said when <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> the settlement-house. He reserves for himself the right to do as he pleases, but insists that those who surround him shall adopt the subserviency which he thinks proper {{for the rest of the}} world. If he were a Christian himself, I shouldn't mind it so much." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Harry, perhaps I {{need not}} have grumbled so much, but you see it is a pretty rough {{beginning}} when one is not accustomed to it. We ought {{to have had a}} short job to begin with, and got into it gradually, instead of having six hours on end; and I expect that the backwoods settler <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> does not work for very long when he first begins. If he did he would be a fool, for he certainly would not be fit for work for a week if he kept on till he had nearly broken his back and taken the whole skin off his hands by working all day the first time he tried it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ben!" [...] exclaimed the other, [...] "you don't {{know what}} <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about!</b> Captain Bonnet would be seized and tried as a pirate. His blood {{would be on}} your head, Ben!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I really don't know," [...] he said, {{blinking}} his eyes, [...] "what <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about.</b> Do <b>you</b> {{ask us to}} {{give this}} obvious lunatic nearly a thousand a year for life?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You burden {{yourself}} with the intricacies and subserviences, with the tedium and pomposities of Court life! Cora, {{you do not know}} what <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about,</b> or what <b>you</b> <b>are</b> proposing for yourself." ...|$|R
