40|$|The final {{destination}} of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) -attached proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the plasma membrane or the cell wall. Two kinds of signals {{have been proposed}} for their cellular localization: (i) the specific amino acid residues V, I, or L at the site 4 or 5 amino acids upstream of the GPI attachment site (the ω site) and <b>Y</b> <b>or</b> <b>N</b> at the site 2 amino acids upstream of the ω site for cell wall localization and (ii) dibasic residues in the region upstream of the ω site (the ω-minus region) for plasma membrane localization. The relationships between these amino acid residues and efficiencies of cell wall incorporation were examined by constructing fusion reporter proteins from open reading frames encoding putative GPI-attached proteins. The levels of incorporation were high in the constructs containing the specific amino acid residues and quite low in those containing two basic amino acid residues in the ω-minus region. With constructs that contained neither specific residues nor two basic residues, levels of incorporation were moderate. These correlations clearly suggest that GPI-attached proteins have two different signals which act positively or negatively in cell wall incorporation for their cellular localization...|$|E

30|$|These states {{indicate}} {{what actually}} {{took place in}} reality. State 43 is the most stable equilibrium state, as its stability type is Nash, which also means that state 43 is equilibrium according to SEQ, GMR, and SMR. Because 43 is Nash equilibrium, no DM can unilaterally move to a more preferred state from state 43. States 27 and 39 are also equilibria in this conflict, but only according to SMR and GMR stability, which means sanctioning DMs can move to less preferred states when blocking the given DM’s unilateral improvement, which is a movement by a DM to a more preferred state. What happened in reality (as of 2010) is that the Ontario Government chose AECL as the vendor of the reactors, and then the Federal Government decided to attempt to privatize AECL. After this decision was made, the Ontario Government postponed {{the purchase of the}} two reactors, because the future of AECL was very uncertain. Therefore, the state that took place was state 43, but states 27 and 39, which can be presented as (N Y N, Y N, N -, Y), happened after state 43, where a dash means <b>Y</b> <b>or</b> <b>N.</b> Also, since states 27 and 39 are only GMR and SMR equilibria, the stability of these states is not as strong as an SEQ equilibrium in which the sanctions by other DMs against unilateral improvements by a focal DM can only be levied using unilateral improvements. Here, one may conclude that neither state 27 nor state 39 are the final equilibria of the conflict, so the dispute will not finish at this point.|$|E
40|$|Influenza B viruses cause annual {{outbreaks}} of respiratory illness in humans and are increasingly {{recognized as a}} major cause of influenza-associated pediatric mortality. Neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors (NAIs) are the only available therapy for patients in-fected with influenza B viruses, and the potential emergence of NAI-resistant viruses is a public health concern. The NA substitu-tions located within the enzyme active site could not only reduce NAI susceptibility of influenza B virus but also affect virus fit-ness. In this study, we investigated the effect of single NA substitutions on the fitness of influenza B/Yamanashi/ 166 / 1998 viruses (Yamagata lineage). We generated recombinant viruses containing either wild-type (WT) NA or NA with a substitution in the catalytic (R 371 K) or framework (E 119 A, D 198 E, D 198 Y, I 222 T, H 274 Y, and N 294 S) residues. We assessed NAI susceptibility, NA biochemical properties, NA protein expression, and virus replication in vitro and in differentiated normal human bronchial epi-thelial (NHBE) cells. Our results showed that four NA substitutions (D 198 E, I 222 T, H 274 Y, and N 294 S) conferred reduced inhi-bition by oseltamivir and three (E 119 A, D 198 Y, and R 371 K) conferred highly reduced inhibition by oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir. All NA substitutions, except for D 198 Y and R 371 K, were genetically stable after seven passages inMDCK cells. Cell surface NA protein expression was significantly increased by H 274 Y and N 294 S substitutions. Viruses with the E 119 A, I 222 T, H 274 <b>Y,</b> <b>or</b> <b>N</b> 294 S substitution were not attenuated in replication efficiency in vitro or in NHBE cells.

40|$|Effective {{antiviral}} {{drugs are}} essential for early control of an influenza pandemic. It is therefore crucial to evaluate the possible threat posed by neuraminidase (NA) inhibitor-resistant influenza viruses with pandemic potential. Four NA mutations (E 119 G, H 274 Y, R 292 K, and N 294 S) that {{have been reported to}} confer resistance to NA inhibitors were each introduced into recombinant A/Vietnam/ 1203 / 04 (VN 1203) H 5 N 1 influenza virus. For comparison, the same mutations were introduced into recombinant A/Puerto Rico/ 8 / 34 (PR 8) H 1 N 1 influenza virus. The E 119 G and R 292 K mutations significantly compromised viral growth in vitro, but the H 274 Y and N 294 S mutations were stably maintained in VN 1203 and PR 8 viruses. In both backgrounds, the H 274 Y and N 294 S mutations conferred resistance to oseltamivir carboxylate (50 % inhibitory concentration [IC 50] increases, > 250 -fold and > 20 -fold, respectively), and the N 294 S mutation reduced susceptibility to zanamivir (IC 50 increase, > 3. 0 -fold). Although the H 274 Y and N 294 S mutations did not compromise the replication efficiency of VN 1203 or PR 8 viruses in vitro, these mutations slightly reduced the lethality of PR 8 virus in mice. However, the VN 1203 virus carrying either the H 274 <b>Y</b> <b>or</b> <b>N</b> 294 S mutation exhibited lethality {{similar to that of the}} wild-type VN 1203 virus. The different enzyme kinetic parameters (Vmax and Km) of avian-like VN 1203 NA and human-like PR 8 NA suggest that resistance-associated NA mutations can cause different levels of functional loss in NA glycoproteins of the same subtype. Our results suggest that NA inhibitor-resistant H 5 N 1 variants may retain the high pathogenicity of the wild-type virus in mammalian species. Patients receiving NA inhibitors for H 5 N 1 influenza virus infection should be closely monitored for the emergence of resistant variants. Copyright © 2007, American Society for Microbiology.

40|$|A {{practical}} {{approach for}} the design of multiple-description scalar quantization of speech is presented that conforms to standard G. 711 PCM. The method chiefly consists of an index assignment algorithm that enables the side decoders to exhibit SNR characteristics comparable to those of the standard logarithmic quantizer. With two-channel transmission of multiple descriptions, an increase in robustness to lossy channels is obtained without violation of the standard coding method. The method found is suitable {{for the design}} of multiple descriptions of any given scalar quantizer, e. g. one within a complex speech coder. 1. MULTIPLE-DESCRIPTION CODING Multiple-description coding [1] provides a transmission link with diversity in order to improve robustness to channel breakdown. The coded signal is split into two or more descriptions, or partial codes, which are transmitted over the same number of different channels. These channels may indeed consist of different physical links, or of different packets transmitted through networks like the internet. The priciple of a two-channel multiple-description (MD) coded transmission is shown in fig. 1. From the input signal, x(n), the encoder generates two descriptions C 1 and C 2 to be sent over two lossy channels. If no loss occurs, both descriptions will be used by the central decoder to reconstruct the signal y 0 (n) with high quality. If one of the descriptions is lost, the received part of the code will enable its corresponding side decoder to yield a reduced-quality version of the output signal, <b>y</b> 1 (<b>n)</b> <b>or</b> <b>y</b> 2 (<b>n).</b> The transmission will be interrupted only when both descriptions are lost. x(n...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: The {{cross-resistance}} {{profiles of}} elvitegravirand dolutegraviron raltegravir-resistant variants is still controversial or {{not available in}} macrophages and lack extensive evaluations on wide panels of clonal variants. Thus, a complete evaluation in parallel with all currently available integrase inhibitors (INIs) was performed. Methods: The integrase coding region was RT-PCR-amplified from patient-derived plasma samples and cloned into an HIV- 1 molecular clone lacking the integrase region. Twenty recombinant viruses bearing mutations to all primary pathways of resistance to raltegravir were phenotypically evaluated with each integrase inhibitor in freshly purified CD 4 =" T cells or monocyte-derived macrophages. Results: Y 143 R single mutants conferred {{a higher level of}} raltegravir resistance in macrophages [fold change (FC) 47. 7 - 60. 24] compared with CD 4 + Tcells (FC 9. 55 - 11. 56). All other combinations had similar effects on viral susceptibility to raltegravir in both cell types. Elvitegravir displayedasimilarbehaviour both in lymphocytesandmacrophages with all the tested patterns. When compared with raltegravir, none to modest increases in resistancewere observed for the Y 143 R/C pathways. Dolutegravir maintained its activity and cross-resistance profile in macrophages. Only Q 148 H/R variants had a reduced level of susceptibility (FC 5. 48 - 18. 64). No variations were observed for the Y 143 R/C (+/ 2 T 97 A) <b>or</b> <b>N</b> 155 H variants. Conclusions: All INIs showed comparable antiretroviral activity in both cell types even if single mutations were associated with a different level of susceptibility in vitro to raltegravirand elvitegravir inmacrophages.

40|$|To {{identify}} {{sites in}} gp 120 that {{interact with the}} CCR 5 coreceptor and to analyze the mechanisms of infection, we selected variants of the CCR 5 -dependent JRCSF molecular clone of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) that adapted to replicate in HeLa-CD 4 cells that express the mutant coreceptor CCR 5 (<b>Y</b> 14 <b>N)</b> <b>or</b> CCR 5 (G 163 R), which were previously shown to bind purified gp 120 -CD 4 complexes only weakly. Correspondingly, these mutant CCR 5 s mediate infections of wild-type virus only at relatively high cell surface concentrations, demonstrating a concentration-dependent assembly requirement for infection. The plots of viral infectivity versus concentration of coreceptors had sigmoidal shapes, implying involvement of multiple coreceptors, with an estimated stoichiometry of four to six CCR 5 s in the active complexes. All of the adapted viruses had mutations in the V 3 loops of their gp 120 s. The titers of recombinant HIV- 1 virions with these V 3 mutations were determined in previously described panels of HeLa-CD 4 cell clones that express discrete amounts of CCR 5 (<b>Y</b> 14 <b>N)</b> <b>or</b> CCR 5 (G 163 R). The V 3 loop mutations did not alter viral utilization of wild-type CCR 5, but they specifically enhanced utilization of the mutant CCR 5 s by two distinct mechanisms. Several mutant envelope glycoproteins were highly fusogenic in syncytium assays, and these all increased the efficiency of infection of the CCR 5 (<b>Y</b> 14 <b>N)</b> <b>or</b> CCR 5 (G 163 R) clonal panels without enhancing virus adsorption onto the cells or viral affinity for the coreceptor. In contrast, V 3 loop mutation N 300 Y was selected during virus replication in cells that contained only a trace of CCR 5 (Y 14 N) and this mutation increased the apparent affinity of the virus for this coreceptor, as indicated by {{a shift in the}} sigmoid-shaped infectivity curve toward lower concentrations. Surprisingly, N 300 Y increased viral affinity for the second extracellular loop of CCR 5 (Y 14 N) rather than for the mutated amino terminus. Indeed, the resulting virus was able to use a mutant CCR 5 that lacks 16 amino acids at its amino terminus, a region previously considered essential for CCR 5 coreceptor function. Our results demonstrate that the role of CCR 5 in infection involves at least two steps that can be strongly and differentially altered by mutations in either CCR 5 or the V 3 loop of gp 120 : a concentration-dependent binding step that assembles a critical multivalent virus-coreceptor complex and a postassembly step that likely involves a structural rearrangement of the complex. The postassembly step can severely limit HIV- 1 infections and is not an automatic consequence of virus-coreceptor binding, as was previously assumed. These results have important implications for our understanding of the mechanism of HIV- 1 infection and the factors that may select for fusogenic gp 120 variants during AIDS progression...|$|R

Increasing dopant content from 5 to 20 % decreased NSE in most cases, although in the case of Pr, NSE was increased. During subsequent NOx-temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), two NOx desorption events were apparent in all cases, the first occurring below 350 °C and the second occurring in the range 350 – 500 °C. Doping with Pr promoted the release of increased amounts of NOx below 350 °C compared to samples doped with other lanthanides; moreover, increasing the content of all doping metals except Pr shifted desorption peaks to higher temperatures, while the opposite trend was observed for Pr. Promotion with Pd was also examined, resulting in an increase of NOx desorption at low temperatures (< 350 °C) relative to Pt. These results can be rationalized in terms of the ability of Pr to create vacancies in the CeO 2 lattice, which facilitate NOx adsorption, and by the superior NO oxidation activity of Pt relative to Pd, which promotes NOx storage as nitrates possessing high thermal stability.

40|$|Abstract. Distributive lattices {{are well}} known to be {{precisely}} those lattices that possess cancellation: x ∨ y = x ∨ z and x ∧ y = x ∧ z imply y = z. Cancellation, in turn, occurs whenever a lattice has neither of the 5 -element lattices M 3 <b>or</b> <b>N</b> 5 as sublattices. In this paper we examine cancellation in skew lattices, where the involved objects are in many ways lattice-like, but the operations ∧ and ∨ no longer need be commutative. In particular, we find necessary and sufficient conditions involving the nonoccurrence of potential sub-objects similar to M 3 <b>or</b> <b>N</b> 5 that insure that a skew lattice is left cancellative (satisfying the above implication) right cancellative (x∨z = y∨z and x∧z = y∧z imply x = <b>y)</b> <b>or</b> just cancellative (satisfying both implications). We also present systems of identities showing that left [right or fully] cancellative skew lattices form varieties. Finally, we give some positive characterizations of cancellation. 1...|$|R
40|$|The oxygen {{deficient}} CuO x {{planes of}} the high-T c superconductors REBa 2 Cu 3 O 6 +x (RE denotes a rare-earth atom or yttrium) are studied. Starting from the Emery {{model for the}} Cu-O chain fragments, an extended ASYNNNI model is proposed to describe the statistical mechanics of the CuO x planes. The model is analysed by using Monte Carlo techniques, computing especially the charge transfer to the CuO 2 planes regulating the high-T c superconductivity, and the concentration of differently coordinated Cu ions. Results are compared to experimental data for various RE cases. Keywords: REBCO compounds, Cu-O chains, Emery model, ASYNNNI model Typeset using REVT E X I.

The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the emotional stress evoked by a prostate cancer diagnosis increases the immediate risks of cardiovascular events and suicide. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a prospective cohort study by following all men in Sweden who were 30 <b>y</b> <b>or</b> older (<b>n</b> = 4, 305, 358) for a diagnosis of prostate cancer (n = 168, 584) and their subsequent occurrence of cardiovascular events and suicide between January 1, 1961 and December 31, 2004. We used Poisson regression models to calculate relative risks (RRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) of cardiovascular events and suicide among men who had prostate cancer diagnosed within 1 y to men without any cancer diagnosis. The risks of cardiovascular events and suicide were elevated during the first year after prostate cancer diagnosis, particularly during the first week. Before 1987, the RR of fatal cardiovascular events was 11. 2 (95 % CI 10. 4 - 12. 1) during the first week and 1. 9 (95 % CI 1. 9 - 2. 0) during the first year after diagnosis. From 1987, the RR for cardiovascular events, nonfatal and fatal combined, was 2. 8 (95 % CI 2. 5 - 3. 2) during the first week and 1. 3 (95 % CI 1. 3 - 1. 3) during the first year after diagnosis. While the RR of cardiovascular events declined, the RR of suicide was stable over the entire study period: 8. 4 (95 % CI 1. 9 - 22. 7) during the first week and 2. 6 (95 % CI 2. 1 - 3. 0) during the first year after diagnosis. Men 54 <b>y</b> <b>or</b> younger at cancer diagnosis demonstrated the highest RRs of both cardiovascular events and suicide. A limitation of the present study is the lack of tumor stage data, which precluded possibilities of investigating the potential impact of the disease severity on the relationship between a recent diagnosis of prostate cancer and the risks of cardiovascular events and suicide. In addition, we cannot exclude residual confounding as a possible explanation. CONCLUSIONS: Men newly diagnosed with prostate cancer are at increased risks for cardiovascular events and suicide. Future studies with detailed disease characteristic data are warranted...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Health problem {{lists are}} a key {{component}} of electronic health records and are instrumental in the development of decision-support systems that encourage best practices and optimal patient safety. Most health problem lists require initial clinical information to be entered manually and few integrate information across care providers and institutions. This study assesses the accuracy of a novel approach to create an inter-institutional automated health problem list in a computerized medical record (MOXXI) that integrates three sources of information for an individual patient: diagnostic codes from medical services claims from all treating physicians, therapeutic indications from electronic prescriptions, and single-indication drugs. Methods Data for this study were obtained from 121 general practitioners and all medical services provided for 22, 248 of their patients. At the opening of a patient's file, all health problems detected through medical service utilization or single-indication drug use were flagged to the physician in the MOXXI system. Each new arising health problem were presented as 'potential' and physicians were prompted to specify if the health problem was valid (<b>Y)</b> <b>or</b> not (<b>N)</b> <b>or</b> if they preferred to reassess its validity at a later time. Results A total of 263, 527 health problems, representing 891 unique problems, were identified for the group of 22, 248 patients. Medical services claims contributed to the majority of problems identified (77 %), followed by therapeutic indications from electronic prescriptions (14 %), and single-indication drugs (9 %). Physicians actively chose to assess 41. 7 % (n = 106, 950) of health problems. Overall, 73 % of the problems assessed were considered valid; 42 % originated from medical service diagnostic codes, 11 % from single indication drugs, and 47 % from prescription indications. Twelve percent of problems identified through other treating physicians were considered valid compared to 28 % identified through study physician claims. Conclusion Automation of an inter-institutional problem list added over half of all validated problems to the health problem list of which 12 % were generated by conditions treated by other physicians. Automating the integration of existing information sources provides timely access to accurate and relevant health problem information. It may also accelerate the uptake and use of electronic medical record systems. </p...|$|R
40|$|Slow wave sleep (SWS) {{has been}} {{reported}} to correlate with sleep maintenance, but whether pharmacological enhancement of SWS also leads to improved sleep maintenance is not known. Here we evaluate the time-course of the effects of gaboxadol, an extra-synaptic gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonist, on SWS, sleep maintenance, and other sleep measures in a traffic noise model of transient insomnia. After a placebo run-in, 101 healthy subjects (20 - 78 y) were randomized to gaboxadol (n = 50; 15 mg in subjects < 65 y and 10 mg in subjects ≥ 65 <b>y)</b> <b>or</b> placebo (<b>n</b> = 51) for 7 nights (N 1 -N 7). The model caused some disruption of sleep initiation and maintenance, with greatest effects on N 1. Compared with placebo, gaboxadol increased SWS and slow wave activity throughout N 1 to N 7 (p < 0. 05). Gaboxadol reduced latency to persistent sleep overall (N 1 -N 7) by 4. 5 min and on N 1 by 11 min (both p < 0. 05). Gaboxadol increased total sleep time (TST) overall by 16 min (p < 0. 001) and on N 1 by 38 min (p < 0. 0001). Under gaboxadol, wakefulness after sleep onset was reduced by 11 min overall (p < 0. 01) and by 29 min on N 1 (p < 0. 0001), and poly-somnographic awakenings were reduced on N 1 (p < 0. 05). Gaboxadol reduced self-reported sleep onset latency overall and on N 1 (both p < 0. 05) and increased self-reported TST overall (p < 0. 05) and on N 1 (p < 0. 01). Subjective sleep quality improved overall (p < 0. 01) and on N 1 (p < 0. 0001). Increases in SWS correlated with objective and subjective measures of sleep maintenance and subjective sleep quality under placebo and gaboxadol (p < 0. 05). Gaboxadol enhanced SWS and reduced the disruptive effects of noise on sleep initiation and maintenance...|$|R
