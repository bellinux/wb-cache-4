40|$|In {{our modern}} {{information}} age, few technological problems have had {{as great a}} potential catastrophic impact on humanity as the <b>year</b> <b>2000</b> <b>computer</b> date change (Y 2 K). Although Y 2 K was considered initially a technical issue with a straight-forward technical solution, it was later found to have significant human consequences and educed a response unparalleled {{in the late twentieth}} century. If left unaddressed, Y 2 K could have caused a serious interruption to critical elements of our complex national infrastructure. As alarmists consistently warned, these disruptions would have grave repercussions in the social, political, and commercial institutions that rely on them. ^ Although Y 2 K is judged to be a nonevent by some, this study demonstrates that the multiple challenges related to the <b>year</b> <b>2000</b> <b>computer</b> date change were more than a technical threat. In addition, this dissertation makes evident that Y 2 K alarmists were effective in highlighting the risks of modern information technologies. ^ Y 2 K presented a unique crossroad to examine our attitudes toward advanced technology. The human responses to potential consequences of a cataclysmic event do not always have to be negative. The manner in which these are addressed may also serve as models for resolving future problems. ^ As the Y 2 K challenge was recent, scholarly research {{is still in its infancy}} to assess the effects that this technological episode has had upon humanity. This dissertation seeks to provide an important contribution to this body of knowledge. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{management}} philosophy until {{recent years}} has been to replace the workers with computers, which are available 24 hours a day, need no benefits, no insurance and never complain. But as the <b>year</b> <b>2000</b> approached, along with it came the fear of the millennium bug, generally known as Y 2 K, and the computers threatened to strike!!!! Y 2 K, though an abbreviation of <b>year</b> <b>2000,</b> generally refers to the computer glitches which are associated with the <b>year</b> <b>2000.</b> <b>Computer</b> companies, in order to save memory and money, adopted a voluntary standard {{in the beginning of the}} computer era that all computers automatically convert any year designated by two numbers such as 99 into 1999 by adding the digits 19. This saved enormous amount of memory, and thus money, because large databases containing birth dates or other dates only needed to contain the last two digits such as 65 or 86. But it also created a built in flaw that could make the computers inoperable from January 2000. The problem is that most of these old computers are programmed to convert 00 (for the <b>year</b> <b>2000)</b> into 1900 and not 2000. The trouble could therefore, arise when the systems had to deal with dates outside the 1900 s. In 2000, for example a programme that calculates the age of a person born in 1965 will subtract 65 from 00 and get - 65. The problem is most acute in mainframe systems, but that does not mean PCs, UNIX and other computing environments are trouble free. Any computer system that relies on date calculations must be tested because the Y 2 K or the millennium bug arises because of a potential for “date discontinuity” which occurs when the time expressed by a system, or any of its components, does not move in consonance with real time. Though attention has been focused on the potential problems linked with change from 1999 to 2000, date discontinuity may occur at other times in and around this period. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{primary goal}} of (weak) {{artificial}} intelligence is to build intelligent entities. A related (but not a necessary) goal is to understand intelligent entities, and perhaps even to understand and engineer human intelligence (strong AI). But what are intelligent entities? Russell and Norvig put forth four possible definitions, {{the second and third}} of which might be categorized as strong AI, and the first and fourth of which are more along the lines of weak AI: 1. systems that act like humans 2. systems that think like humans 3. systems that think rationally 4. systems that act rationally 1. 1 Acting Like Humans In 1950, Turing proposed an operational definition of intelligence, later named the Turing Test. An entity is deemed intelligent, according to Turing, if it demonstrates an ability to achieve human-level performance in all cognitive tasks, sufficient to fool an interrogator. Turing predicted that by the <b>year</b> <b>2000,</b> <b>computers</b> would be able to pass the Turing test; more specifically, he predicted that the average interrogator {{would not be able to}} distinguish a computer from a human more than 70 per cent of the time, after a five minute conversation.

50|$|The 4:3 {{aspect ratio}} was common in older {{television}} {{cathode ray tube}} (CRT) displays, which were not easily adaptable to a wider aspect ratio.

The 16:10 ratio allowed some compromise between showing older 4:3 aspect ratio broadcast TV shows, but also allowing better viewing of widescreen movies. However, around the year 2005, entertainment industry displays (i.e., TV sets) gradually moved from 16:10 to the 16:9 aspect ratio, for further improvement of viewing widescreen movies. By about 2007, virtually all mass market entertainment displays were 16:9. In 2011, 1920×1080 (Full HD, the native resolution of Blu-ray) was the favored resolution in the most heavily marketed entertainment market displays.

40|$|We {{comment on}} {{mathematical}} results about the statistical behavior of Lorenz equations an its attractor, and more generally {{to the class}} of singular hyperbolic systems. The mathematical theory of such kind of systems {{turned out to be}} surprisingly difficult. It is remarkable that a rigorous proof of the existence of the Lorenz attractor was presented only around the <b>year</b> <b>2000</b> with a <b>computer</b> assisted proof together with an extension of the hyperbolic theory developed to encompass attractors robustly containing equilibria. We present some of the main results on the statisitcal behavior of such systems. We show that for attractors of three-dimensional flows, robust chaotic behavior is equivalent to the existence of certain hyperbolic structures, known as singular-hyperbolicity. These structures, in turn, are associated to the existence of physical measures: in low dimensions, robust chaotic behavior for flows ensures the existence of a physical measure. We then give more details on recent results on the dynamics of singular-hyperbolic (Lorenz-like) attractors.

40|$|During {{the latter}} part of the 1990 s, U. S. {{economic}} growth was boosted by sizable increases in business purchases of information processing equipment and software, otherwise known as high-tech capital goods. Beginning in 2000, though, firms began to curtail these expenditures; by 2001, high-tech and other forms of business investment were falling sharply. Indeed, much of the downturn in the growth of U. S. economic activity can be traced to the sharp decline in investment spending. Several explanations have been offered, from the acceleration in labor productivity—the so-called “New Economy” story—to the stock market surge and subsequent collapse. One explanation that has not been explored in much detail is the surge in business purchases of hardware and software in preparation for the century date change (Y 2 K). Because many information processing systems and much of the hardware and software were not Y 2 K compliant as late as 1998, it was thought that business investment in high-tech equipment and software would increase appreciably to fix this problem. Although solid Y 2 K spending data are lacking, the evidence presented in this paper indicates that the magnitude and timing of Y 2 K-related expenditures make it unlikely that the investment boom and bust was a Y 2 K event. <b>Year</b> <b>2000</b> date conversion (<b>Computer</b> systems); Information technology...|$|R
