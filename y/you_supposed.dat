500|$|The {{main source}} of the game's horror is Alma, a ghostly little girl. Craig Hubbard remarked that [...] "a guy in a mask chasing co-eds with a meat cleaver can be scary, but on some level you're {{thinking}} to yourself you could probably kick his ass if you got the drop on him...but when a spooky little girl takes out an entire Delta Force squad, how are <b>you</b> <b>supposed</b> to deal with that?" [...] While Alma {{has been compared to}} the character Samara from The Ring, Craig Hubbard stated that she [...] "... was born out of a tradition of eerie, faceless female ghosts ..." [...] and not [...] "... as an answer to any specific movie character." [...] Hubbard acknowledged that Alma [...] "... admittedly bears some visual resemblance to the ghosts in Dark Water or Séance", but [...] "... creepy little girls have been freaking [...] out since The Shining." [...] Developers Dave Matthews and Nathan Hendrickson say the name 'Alma' comes from the character Alma Mobley in Peter Straub's novel Ghost Story.|$|E

He described {{in an interview}} with Steve Lobel, [...] "Jay was a mentor before I ever signed to him." [...] "I studied his moves that much...I got to go on tour with him and steal a lot of gems. That's how <b>you</b> <b>supposed</b> to do it. You're supposed to learn and take pieces from the greatest. So, Jay was my mentor before I ever signed to him. And now that I signed to him it's just a blessing to be able to hit him for advice and get that real 20 years of experience or however long he been in the game. It's priceless.""My favorite rapper was Pac," [...] he said. [...] "He was my favorite rapper before I even started rapping. Before I even thought of-It went from Michael Jackson, Bobby Brown as a kid and artists like that. Even Kool Moe Dee. Just the cool dude that I looked up to. And then one day my stepfather came home from-I don't know if he was back from Desert Storm...I remember him coming home with that first Pac album. With [...] "Brenda's Got A Baby". It was 2Pacalypse Now. And since then-When I was too young to know what he was talking about, but it connected. Cause that's the thing about art. It's just truth. It's straight-Whatever you feel. So, even as a seven-year-old kid, eight-year-old kid I could hear Pac's early albums and feel the truth." [...] Cole drew comparisons to Nas following the release of Friday Night Lights, stating that Nas served as the primary inspiration behind the creation of the mixtape. Cole later addressed their musical similarities on [...] "Let Nas Down", a song written and composed due to his disparaging comments towards [...] "Work Out".|$|E
