25|$|Atwater: But Reagan did {{not have}} to do a {{southern}} strategy for two reasons. Number one, race was not a dominant issue. And number two, the mainstream issues in this campaign had been, quote, southern issues since way back in the sixties. So Reagan goes out and campaigns on the issues of economics and of national defense. The whole campaign was devoid of any kind of racism, any kind of reference. And I'll tell <b>you</b> <b>another</b> thing you all need to think about, that even surprised me, is the lack of interest, really, the lack of knowledge right now in the South among white voters about the Voting Rights Act.|$|E
500|$|There {{have been}} many {{alternate}} versions of this event. One version, which was later portrayed in The Babe Ruth Story, claims that Ruth went to Sylvester's hospital bed and promised him in person that he would {{hit a home run}} for him. On October 9, Ruth followed up on Sylvester and told him he would [...] "try to knock <b>you</b> <b>another</b> homer, maybe two today". Differing newspaper reports from October 1926 claimed that Sylvester suffered from blood poisoning, a spinal infection, a sinus condition, or had a condition requiring a spinal fusion. Contemporary analyses dispute whether Sylvester was ever hospitalized, dying, or if Ruth's three home runs had actually saved the boy's life, as claimed by the newspapers.|$|E
500|$|Like {{previous}} games, Dream Drop Distance features various Disney characters, including Mickey Mouse, who {{is seen in}} {{the game}} in three different incarnationsâ€”his original characterization in the Kingdom Hearts series as the king of Disney Castle; a musketeer as featured in and the young apprentice of Yen Sid shown in Fantasia. Donald Duck and Goofy make similar appearances as well. Characters hailing from their respective worlds remain in their worlds and play a small role in the main story, while Maleficent and Pete reprise their roles as antagonists, and Yen Sid as a supporting character. Unlike the other major installments, which feature an extensive cast of Final Fantasy characters, only a single Moogle appears from the franchise. Dream Drop Distance features appearances of Neku Sakuraba, Joshua, Shiki, Beat and Rhyme from The World Ends with <b>You,</b> <b>another</b> game owned by Square Enix with characters designed by Tetsuya Nomura, marking the first time that non-Disney, non-Final Fantasy characters have appeared in the series.|$|E

500|$|The court {{considered}} that Thomas had been regularly informed by {{all those who}} had interrogated him that {{the degree to which}} he cooperated would determine what happened to him, and that given their position as authority figures, Thomas would have readily perceived that they had the ability to change his situation; indeed, none of the interviewers had done anything to dispel the idea that {{they would be able to}} help Thomas. The court also pointed out that even if actions such as showing Thomas photographs of his family and letters from them could not be said to be deliberately improper, as the trial judge seemed to indicate would be necessary to characterise them as inducements, there was no way that they could be interpreted by someone in Thomas' position, other than as indications that if he cooperated he would be reunited with his family. Particularly, after Thomas expressed happiness at seeing the photographs, one of the interviewers took them away, saying [...] " [...] might give <b>you</b> <b>another</b> look at that later", comments which were [...] "calculated, if not intended, to remind the applicant that he was dependent on his captors and interviewers for favours." ...|$|E
500|$|Joey Thurmond of Push Square wrote how playing {{through the}} {{campaign}} from Modern Warfare {{reminded him of}} its sheer memorability and how it had long endured with fans compared with other games in the series, saying [...] "there's tension and gravity shot through the experience, {{as if the world}} is on your shoulders to push past every enemy line with explosive bravado or exacting stealth. [...] There's a grounded feel to player characters that make <b>you</b> <b>another</b> cog in the machine with the abilities and limitations of an ordinary soldier, not a supernatural saviour." [...] He praised the game's graphical enhancements, saying [...] "Modern Warfare Remastered looks and sounds like a fresh game on par with today's graphical and aural standards" [...] and calling it a [...] "ridiculously faithful remake", but wrote that the game still showed some slight signs of age, such as artificial intelligence problems and pacing issues. In short, he commended Raven Software [...] "for arguably delivering the most substantial, masterful remake we have ever experienced", and that [...] "Modern Warfare Remastered celebrates this legacy with updated visuals and sound that really go above and beyond the call of duty, sprucing up an old care package for a more modern age to near-perfection." ...|$|E
500|$|Phipps {{had little}} {{tolerance}} for foolishness and retained a professional soldier's dislike of civilian interference in military affairs, and ineffective administration, whether from civilians or government. In 1887, {{shortly after his}} retirement, {{he wrote a letter}} to the editor of The Times addressing some of the highly publicized problems of desertions from the ranks. [...] "War Office civilians," [...] he wrote, [...] "like the plan of indiscriminate enlist, as it swells their list of recruits. [...] Then, when the list of deserters grows, they put on long faces, and say, 'it must be those wicked officers.' [...] The officers would stop this plan in a day if they were allowed." [...] The problem with recruiters, Phipps maintained, lay in the need for quantity, not quality. [...] "What fools you civilians are to pay for these blackguards," [...] he wrote. [...] "If you would let the officers select their men, for the first year or so, you would have fewer men on paper, fewer men in prison, and just as many men for service....I will then give <b>you</b> <b>another</b> hint for saving money...why not do away with the Inspector-General of Recruiting, and spend his pay in horse artillery, who would be very ornamental and very serviceable? What use is the Inspector General?" [...] He had retired from active service in 1883, and Phipps fully retired in 1887, after attaining the rank of colonel.|$|E

An example: commenting on his opponent at the 1970 USSR vs. Rest of the World match, he remarked, [...] "When [...] Spassky offers you a piece, you might as well resign then and there.

2500|$|Like Water for Chocolate {{received}} universal acclaim {{from music}} critics. Rolling Stones Kris Ex called Common [...] "a hip-hop MC willing to actually examine himself through his art". NMEs Stevie Chick {{described him as}} a [...] "great storyteller" [...] who is [...] "equal parts philosopher and documentarian." [...] Spins Peter S. Scholtes praised Like Water for Chocolate as [...] "his most aggressive and powerful record yet", and The Wire also hailed it as his best album. The Source wrote that the album finds [...] "a more worldly Common... creating full-fledged jazz, funk and soul songs". Mojo called Like Water for Chocolate the [...] "most user-friendly contribution so far to the wave of 'conscious' rap." [...] RapReviews critic Steve Juon wrote: [...] "From 'Payback is a Grandmother' {{all the way to}} the finale 'Pop's Rap III' you'll find your ears have been smothered in a sweet darkness that Dove has never been able to wrap in foil and sell for ninety-nine cents.

2500|$|The {{record label}} speculated that Eminem {{would be the}} first artist to sell one million copies in an album's first week of release. These {{expectations}} placed a large burden on Eminem, who recalled, [...] "I was scared to death. I wanted to be successful, but before anything, I want respect. [...] " [...] After the album was finished, the record label felt that there were no songs that had potential to be a lead single. Feeling pressured, Eminem returned to the studio and wrote [...] "The Way I Am" [...] as his way of saying, [...] "Look, this is the best I can do. I can't give <b>you</b> <b>another</b> 'My Name Is. ' I can't just sit in there and make that magic happen. [...] " [...] However, after the song was added to the album, Eminem felt the urge to write another song, and gave a hook to Dr. Dre for him to create a beat, and went home to write new lyrics; the song eventually became [...] "The Real Slim Shady". The song also discusses Eminem killing Dr. Dre. The producer reflected, [...] "It was funny to me. As long as it's hot, let's roll with it ... in my opinion, the crazier it is the better.
