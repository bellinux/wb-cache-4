50|$|C. A. Lejeune's film reviews {{have long}} been {{compared}} to those of Dilys Powell, who wrote for The Sunday Times {{for much of the}} period when Lejeune was writing for The Observer. Unlike Powell, Lejeune became increasingly disillusioned by various trends in films and, shortly after she had expressed her disgust at Michael Powell's film Peeping Tom, she resigned from The Observer following the release of Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho in 1960. Subsequently she completed Angela Thirkell's unfinished last novel, Three Score Years and Ten (1961) and wrote an autobiography, Thank <b>You</b> <b>for</b> <b>Having</b> <b>Me</b> (1964).|$|E
5000|$|September 30, 2016: Brenda Tracy, {{supporter}} {{of those who}} have suffered rape and sexual assault, writes an article for The Huffington Post, claiming a school football player-development specialist pulled her aside following her meeting with the football players. [...] "He was obviously very angry and defensive about what was happening. I was shocked by what he was saying. He knew that I had a voice in the media and he was doing nothing but making Baylor look guilty and he was validating for me that the football culture and that all the claims being made against them and Briles were probably true." [...] She made no mention of this incident immediately after her visit to Baylor on July 25th, saying [...] "Coach @WF_Grobie is a good man with a good heart.

40|$|Thank <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>having</b> <b>me</b> {{here tonight}} {{to discuss with}} you a subject that I believe has {{important}} ramifications for science, for society, and {{for the relationship between}} the two. The controversy sparked by efforts to undermine the teaching of evolution in the public schools in the United States, efforts that in their current form appeal to the notion of Intelligent Design (ID) as a scientific theory {{on a par with the}} theory of evolution, affords us an opportunity to examine aspects of science and the relationship between science and society that might otherwise go unexamined – except perhaps by that rather strange species of philosophers known as philosophers of science. Scientists care about the theory of evolution, scientists perceive attacks on the theory of evolution as attacks on science itself, and scientists are thus perhaps a bit more willing than they otherwise might be to listen to what philosophers have to say on the subject – or even, as Professor Braterman demonstrated in his lecture last Thursday, to engage in a bit of philosophical reflection of their own. This is not at all to suggest that philosophers know more about science than scientists do – this is in fact a notion of which I hope t...|$|E
