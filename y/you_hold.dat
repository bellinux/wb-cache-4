5|$|The website Allmusic {{called the}} song 'a tormented ballad about romantic loss and regret {{built on a}} spooky yet heart-wrenching piano melody'. The torment {{is present in the}} song's opening ('There were nights when the wind was so cold'), from which the singer recovers ('I {{finished}} crying in the instant that you left... And I banished every memory you and I had ever made'). However, the defiance in the verses are replaced by the return of the 'subservient' feelings in the chorus ('when you touch me like this, and <b>you</b> <b>hold</b> me like that...'); this juxtaposition continues throughout the song.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} eighteen, {{he joined}} the Red Hot Chili Peppers, first {{appearing}} on the band's 1989 album, Mother's Milk. The group's follow-up album, Blood Sugar Sex Magik (1991), was a breakthrough success. Frusciante became overwhelmed by the band's new popularity and quit in 1992. He became a recluse and entered {{a long period of}} drug addiction, during which he released his first solo recordings: Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt (1994) and Smile from the Streets <b>You</b> <b>Hold</b> (1997). In 1998, he successfully completed drug rehabilitation and rejoined the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Their next album, Californication (1999) would eventually go on to sell 16 million copies. His album To Record Only Water for Ten Days was released in 2001. A fourth album with the Chili Peppers, By the Way was released in 2002. On a creative spree, Frusciante released six solo albums in 2004; each album explored different recording techniques and genres. 2006 saw the release of his fifth and final album with the Chili Peppers, Stadium Arcadium. In 2009, Frusciante released The Empyrean, which features Flea and Josh Klinghoffer, and announced he had again parted ways with the Chili Peppers.|$|E
5|$|The discography of John Frusciante, who is {{best known}} as the former guitarist of the rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers, {{consists}} of eleven solo albums and four EPs, as well as two albums with collaborators Joe Lally and Josh Klinghoffer under the name Ataxia and one EP and one album under the alias of Trickfinger. After recording Mother's Milk and Blood Sugar Sex Magik, Frusciante left the Red Hot Chili Peppers in 1992 when he got tired of the growing success of the band. He released his first solo album, Niandra LaDes and Usually Just a T-Shirt, in 1994 on American Recordings. His second record, Smile From the Streets <b>You</b> <b>Hold,</b> was released in 1997 and later taken off the market at his request in 1999. After returning to the Red Hot Chili Peppers in 1998, Frusciante recorded Californication with the band and subsequently released his third solo album, To Record Only Water for Ten Days, in February 2001 on Warner Music Group.|$|E

500|$|Frusciante's drug {{addiction}} worsened {{as the years}} progressed. An article published by the New Times LA described him as [...] "a skeleton covered in thin skin". He participated {{in an interview with}} Dutch public broadcast station VPRO—the first media appearance he made since leaving the Chili Peppers. In the interview Frusciante speaks of the positive effects drugs have had on his mind and proudly admits to being a [...] "junkie". He went on to confess addictions to heroin and crack cocaine, but ultimately described himself as being in the best health of his life. In 1997, Frusciante released his second solo album Smile From the Streets <b>You</b> <b>Hold,</b> primarily for drug money. Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt was estimated to have sold only 45,000 copies when Frusciante ordered it out of print in 1998—when Frusciante rehabilitated and rejoined the Chili Peppers. Smile From the Streets <b>You</b> <b>Hold</b> was withdrawn from the market a year later. In 1999 Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt was re-released on American Recordings. In the early 2000s, Frusciante said he planned to re-release Smile From the Streets <b>You</b> <b>Hold</b> sometime in the future, but did not give any indication as to when. It was eventually re-released on American Records in Europe of 2006.|$|E

500|$|Frusciante {{released}} his second solo album, Smile from the Streets <b>You</b> <b>Hold,</b> in 1997. The album's first track, [...] "Enter a Uh", was largely characterized by cryptic lyrics and hysterical screeches. Frusciante also coughs throughout the track, showcasing his deteriorating health. By his own admission, {{the album was}} released {{in order to get}} [...] "drug money"; he withdrew it from the market in 1999. The album is also notable for including a recording called [...] "Height Down" [...] which features River Phoenix.|$|E
500|$|When Madonna {{recorded}} it, even as our demo faded out, on the fade {{you could}} hear Tom saying, [...] "When your heart beats, and <b>you</b> <b>hold</b> me, and you love me..." [...] That {{was the last thing}} you heard as our demo faded. Madonna must have listened to it very, very carefully because her record ends with the exact same little ad-libs that our demo did. That rarely happens that someone studies your demo so carefully that they use all that stuff. We were sort of flattered how carefully she followed our demo on that.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Diamonds" [...] is a {{departure}} from Rihanna's recurring themes of unhealthy relationships on her other songs, and contains a prominent concept of love. The first verse introduces the song's concept: [...] "Find light in the beautiful sea / I choose to be happy / You and I, you and I / We're like diamonds in the sky." [...] The hook continues this metaphor: [...] "So shine bright, tonight, you and I / We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky / Eye to eye, so alive." [...] According to Glenn Yoder of The Boston Globe, the song shows Rihanna differently than how she is viewed by the public because of lyrics such as [...] "I choose to be happy" [...] and [...] "We're like diamonds in the sky". James Montgomery of MTV News commented that she embraces the positivity and fulfillment of a realized relationship, particularly with the line [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>hold</b> me, I'm alive", and admits [...] "I knew that we'd become one right away". Lindsay DiMattina of Hollywood.com interpreted that Rihanna is crying out for her lover when she sings lines such as, [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>hold</b> me, I'm alive," [...] and [...] "At first sight I felt the energy of sun rays / I saw the life inside your eyes." [...] The Herald Sun asserted that the lyrics were most likely inspired by Rihanna's private life.|$|E

500|$|Outliers {{has been}} {{described}} as a form of autobiography, as Gladwell mixes in elements from his own life into the book to give it a more personal touch. Lev Grossman, writing in Time magazine, called Outliers a [...] "more personal book than its predecessors", noting, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>hold</b> it up to the light, at the right angle, you can read it as a coded autobiography: a successful man trying to figure out his own context, how success happened to him and what it means." [...] He also surmised that Gladwell feels guilty about his success and believes that Christopher Langan should have experienced the same success that he had.|$|E
500|$|Musically, [...] "Hold It Against Me" [...] blends {{pulsating}} {{industrial and}} dance beats with elements of trance. The chorus has lilting synths that lift her vocals and contrast {{them with the}} hard beats. The song features a dubstep-influenced breakdown, in which Spears moans and blows kisses, and the song ends with a final chorus with elements of rave. The lyrics portray the singer seducing someone on the dancefloor, and the chorus revolves around pick-up lines. After the song was released, The Bellamy Brothers criticized it for being similar to their 1979 hit [...] "If I Said You Had a Beautiful Body Would <b>You</b> <b>Hold</b> It Against Me". They were sued by Martin, Luke, McKee and Billboard for defamation and libel, but the case was dismissed after The Bellamy Brothers apologized. McKee stated {{in an interview that}} the title was inspired by a discussion she had with Katy Perry about the latter's body.|$|E
500|$|All of {{the music}} on the record was written by Frusciante, save for the cover of {{hardcore}} punk band Bad Brains' song [...] "Big Takeover". The track was intentionally slowed down and recorded melodically because of a pastime in which Frusciante sang punk songs in different time signatures: [...] "It was just something I had been walking around thinking of in my head. Sometimes I'll walk around singing punk rock songs to myself, but {{as if they were}} regular songs instead of punk rock songs, you know, slow it down and make a melody instead of just yelling them out. And then the idea occurred me to record it like a Led Zeppelin ballad with mandolins and stuff." [...] River Phoenix, a friend of Frusciante's, had contributed guitar and backing vocals to two songs that were intended be included on the record, but they were ultimately left off due to protests from his family. These were later included under different names on the album Smile from the Streets <b>You</b> <b>Hold</b> in 1997.|$|E

500|$|Due to the father-son {{dynamics}} of the hunting world depicted in the series' first season with the Winchesters, the writers decided to explore a mother-daughter relationship. This resulted in {{the introduction of the}} character Jo Harvelle and her mother Ellen, though the Alex character was eventually renamed Jo. Tal had been a fan of the show, and decided to audition for the role. Since the character was not fully explored during her first few appearances on the show, Tal did not know what her personality would be. Because of the way Jo is introducedthreatening Dean with a rifleTal {{was under the impression that}} the character was an experienced hunter. With this in mind, she decided to portray her as [...] "somewhat confident and cool" [...] by making use of her experience in the Israeli army, where she served for two years. Tal commented, [...] "When I was in the army I was holding my gun and feeling all dangerous and badass. It's an attitude, it's a different kind of walk, and the way <b>you</b> <b>hold</b> yourself, the way you look at things. I tried to put that in there because she didn't say much." ...|$|E
500|$|After [...] "Hold It Against Me" [...] was released, The Bellamy Brothers criticized it {{for being}} {{similar to their}} 1979 hit [...] "If I Said You Had a Beautiful Body Would <b>You</b> <b>Hold</b> It Against Me". In a statement, David Bellamy said [...] "professionally, well, in all honesty, we feel {{completely}} ripped off. Where's the originality?" [...] The brothers's attorney Christopher E. Schmidt stated that [...] " [...] becomes somewhat uncanny if you simply double {{the beat of the}} Bellamy Brothers' song and match it up with Britney's version" [...] and pointed out that it {{was not the first time}} Martin and Luke were accused of copyright infringement. On March 2, 2011, Martin, Luke, McKee and Billboard filed a lawsuit in which they accused the brothers of making defamatory and libelous statements about them. The case was dismissed on August 11, 2011. The Bellamy Brothers released a statement that said, [...] "The Bellamy Brothers apologise to Dr. Luke and Max Martin for the Bellamys' public statements and any false impressions suggested by the statements on their website that Dr. Luke and Max Martin copy the works of others." ...|$|E

So, on the 30th, Washington appealed to his men to stay one month longer for a bounty of ten dollars. He asked any men who wanted to volunteer to poise their firelocks, but not a man turned out. Washington then wheeled his horse around and rode in front of the troops, saying [...] "My brave fellows, you have done all I asked you to do, and more than could be reasonably expected; but your country is at stake, your wives, your houses and all that <b>you</b> <b>hold</b> dear. You have worn yourselves out with fatigues and hardships, but we know not how to spare you. If you will consent to stay only one month longer, you will render that service to the cause of liberty and to your country which you probably never can do under any other circumstances." [...] At first no one stepped forward, but then one soldier stepped forward, and he was followed by most of the others, leaving only a few in the original line.|$|E

500|$|Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone {{commented that}} the song [...] "recalls the synth-gloom {{ambience}} of Britney's 2007 gem, Blackout."

The hook was noted by Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times to be reminiscent of [...] "(I Just) Died in Your Arms" [...] (1986) by Cutting Crew. Nick Levine of Digital Spy felt the song had a [...] "clubby and au courant" [...] feel, comparable to [...] "Only Girl (In the World)" [...] (2010) by Barbadian recording artist Rihanna. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Kobalt Music Publishing Inc., [...] "Hold It Against Me" [...] {{is set in the}} compound meter time signature, with a moderate dance beat infused metronome of 133 beats per minute. Lyrically, [...] "Hold It Against Me" [...] talks about seducing someone on the dancefloor. The chorus revolves around pick-up lines; Spears sings, [...] "If I said I want your body now, would <b>you</b> <b>hold</b> it against me?"

500|$|In September 1510, a {{group of}} Dominican friars arrived in Santo Domingo led by Pedro de Córdoba; appalled by the injustices they saw {{committed}} by the slaveowners against the Indians, they decided to deny slave owners the right to confession. Las Casas was among those denied confession for this reason. In December 1511, a Dominican preacher Fray Antonio de Montesinos preached a fiery sermon that implicated the colonists in the genocide of the native peoples. He {{is said to have}} preached, [...] "Tell me by what right of justice do <b>you</b> <b>hold</b> these Indians in such a cruel and horrible servitude? On what authority have you waged such detestable wars against these people who dealt quietly and peacefully on their own lands? Wars in which you have destroyed such an infinite number of them by homicides and slaughters never heard of before. Why do you keep them so oppressed and exhausted, without giving them enough to eat or curing them of the sicknesses they incur from the excessive labor you give them, and they die, or rather you kill them, in order to extract and acquire gold every day." [...] Las Casas himself argued against the Dominicans in favour of the justice of the encomienda. The colonists, led by Diego Columbus, dispatched a complaint against the Dominicans to the King, and the Dominicans were recalled from Hispaniola.|$|E
500|$|In a press release, Lewis {{explained}} the meaning behind [...] "Trouble": [...] "it {{tells the story}} of love going bad and becoming destructive, aspects of which we can all relate to. It’s a deeply emotional and poignant song that I have a real connection to." [...] According to the Sunday Mirror, [...] "Trouble" [...] was inspired by Lewis' break-up with her childhood sweetheart Lou Al-Chamaa. Lyrics which reference her relationship with Chamaa include the lines: [...] "I told you never to get used to me, I stay awake while you fall asleep. I'm a whole lot of trouble, we're in a whole lot of trouble. You shout louder than you used to, and <b>you</b> <b>hold</b> on tighter in the bedroom." [...] During an interview with Digital Spy, Lewis further explained that she was inspired and influenced by British trip-hop pioneers Massive Attack. The Suns showbiz editor Gordan Smart also picked up on the similarities, noting that [...] "Trouble" [...] sounds similar to [...] "Unfinished Sympathy" [...] (1991) and [...] "Teardrop" [...] (1998) by Massive Attack. [...] "Trouble" [...] drew comparisons to Sandé's own singles; according to Michael Cragg from The Guardian, [...] "Trouble" [...] was much like [...] "Heaven" [...] (2011) while MSN's Danielle Cheeseman compared it to Sandé collaboration with Naughty Boy, [...] "Daddy" [...] (2011).|$|E
