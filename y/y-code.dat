2500|$|A vinyl-roofed Landau option with {{simulated}} S-bars {{was added}} to the Thunderbird for 1962 as was a Sports Roadster package for convertible models. The Sports Roadster included 48-spoke Kelsey Hayes-designed wire wheels and a special fiberglass tonneau cover for the rear seats which gave the car the appearance of a two-seat roadster like the original Thunderbird. The Sports Roadster package was slow-selling due the high price of the package and complexity of the tonneau cover, resulting in few Thunderbirds being equipped with it.

40|$|We {{consider}} a {{time division duplex}} (TDD) n_t × n_r multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system with channel state information (CSI) at both the transmitter and receiver. We propose X- and <b>Y-Codes</b> to achieve high multiplexing and diversity gains at low complexity. The proposed precoding schemes are based upon the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the channel matrix which transforms the MIMO channel into parallel subchannels. Then X- and <b>Y-Codes</b> are used to improve the diversity gain by pairing the subchannels, prior to SVD precoding. In particular, the subchannels with good diversity are paired with those having low diversity gains. Hence, a pair of channels is jointly encoded using a 2 × 2 real matrix, which is fixed a priori and does not change with each channel realization. For X-Codes these matrices are 2 -dimensional rotation matrices parameterized by a single angle, while for <b>Y-Codes,</b> these matrices are 2 -dimensional upper left triangular matrices. The complexity of the maximum likelihood decoding (MLD) for both X- and <b>Y-Codes</b> is low. Specifically, the decoding complexity of <b>Y-Codes</b> {{is the same as}} that of a scalar channel. Moreover, we propose X-, Y-Precoders with the same structure as X-, <b>Y-Codes,</b> but the encoding matrices adapt to each channel realization.

40|$|WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Hospital admissions {{associated}} with an adverse drug reaction are often coded to the International Classification of Diseases external cause Y-codes, denoting the medicine class deemed to cause the adverse drug reaction. Matching hospital data with outpatient dispensing data {{has the potential to}} identify the specific causative medicines but the ability to identify the causative medicines in this way has not been previously assessed. This study aimed to determine the proportion of Y-coded hospitalizations for drug-induced hepatotoxicity that could be matched with a potential causative medicine from outpatient dispensing data. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was undertaken from 1 Jan 2005 to 30 June 2012 using data from the Australian Government Department of Veterans’ Affairs of all admissions coded to drug-induced hepatotoxicity. Medicine use in the 6 months prior to hospitalization was examined to identify the probable causative medicines. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Thirty five admissions were identified for 31 patients. All admissions were preceded by use of medicines known to cause hepatotoxicity. Twenty four admissions had a <b>Y-code</b> recorded, of which 19 admissions had at least one <b>Y-code</b> specifying the causative medicine class (22 Y-codes). Of the 22 Y-codes, 95 % could be successfully matched with a medicine from the same class that had been dispensed in the 6 months prior to admission. Further, 92 % were preceded by use of multiple hepatotoxic medicines. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Results of our study demonstrate that hospital administrative data can be linked to prescription dispensing data to identify specific medicines suspected of causing the adverse drug reaction.

Using singular value decomposition (SVD) precoding at the transmitter, the MIMO channels are transformed into parallel subchannels. To improve the low diversity order, we propose X- and <b>Y-Codes,</b> prior to SVD precoding, to pair subchannels having different diversity orders. Specifically, a pair of channels is jointly encoded using a 2 × 2 real matrix, which is fixed a priori and does not change with each channel realization.

The optimal encoding matrices for X- and Y-Codes/Precoders are derived analytically to minimize the average error probability. Finally, we see that X-, Y-Codes/Precoders indeed achieve higher diversity gains at very low encoding/decoding complexity for both well- and ill-conditioned channels, respectively, {{when compared to other}} precoding schemes in the literature. We also observe that for the Rayleigh fading channel model X- and Y-Codes/Precoders exhibit the best average error performance. Index Terms—TDD MIMO, precoding, SVD, diversity I...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} a slow fading nt x nr multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system with channel state information (CSI) {{at both the}} transmitter and receiver. Since communication in such scenarios is subject to block fading, reception reliability, quantified {{in terms of the}} achievable diversity gain, is of importance. A simple and well known precoding scheme is based upon the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the channel matrix, which transforms the MIMO channel into parallel subchannels. Despite having low maximum likelihood decoding (MLD) complexity, this SVD based precoding scheme provides a diversity gain which is limited by the diversity gain of the weakest subchannel. We therefore propose X- and YCodes, which improve the diversity gain of the SVD precoding scheme, by jointly coding information across a pair of subchannels (i. e., pairing subchannels). In particular, subchannels with high diversity gain are paired with those having low diversitygain. A pair of subchannels is jointly encoded using a 2 x 2 real matrix, which is fixed a priori and does not change with each channel realization. For X-Codes, these matrices are 2 -dimensional rotation matrices parameterized by a single angle, while for <b>Y-Codes,</b> these matrices are 2 -dimensional upper left triangular matrices. Also, since joint coding is performed only across a pair of subchannels, the joint MLD complexity remains low. In particular, the MLD complexity of <b>Y-Codes</b> is even lower than that of X-Codes, and is equivalent to symbol by symbol detection. Moreover, we propose X-, Y-Precoders with the same structure as X-, <b>Y-Codes,</b> but with encoding matrices adapted to each channel realization. With respect to the error probability performance, the optimal encoding matrices for X-, YCodes/ Precoders are derived analytically and numerically. Whencompared to other precoding schemes reported in the literature, it is observed that X-Codes/Precoders perform better in wellconditioned channels, while Y-Codes/Precoders perform better in ill-conditioned channels. © 2010 IEEE.
