500|$|While Saw {{received}} mixed reviews, {{a general}} consensus among reviewers was that {{fans of the}} film series would enjoy it. Reviewer for Xbox 360 Achievements Alan Pettit wrote that while he enjoyed the game, {{it was not an}} outstanding title. Pettit commented that the game suffered due to the choice of Zombie Studios as the developer and that the franchise could be successful if a sequel was made with changes in developer and budget. Although he claimed it was repetitive, Pettit mentioned that [...] "If there was only one thing the game did well, I'd say the puzzles that are put before you are excellently constructed, well thought out and best of all, difficult enough that <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> get it on your first attempt." [...] The resulting score from Pettit's review was a 74 out of 100.|$|E
500|$|Popke {{noted that}} {{although}} he saw little connection between {{the music and the}} film, Moore [...] "expresses the mood of each scene brilliantly." [...] He found that watching Age 13 with Graveyard Mountain Home as the soundtrack enhanced the film: [...] "Age 13 is not necessarily an enjoyable film to watch... but viewing it with the Chroma Key soundtrack makes an odd experience even odder yet wholly compelling, with a mysterious filmstrip allure that freezes a bygone era." [...] Conversely, Jablonski considered Age 13 as an enhancement to the music. [...] "Listening to the album stand alone for the first time <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> be much impressed," [...] she said. [...] "The music is solemn and somewhat confusing as the tracks run from one to another without much build and in seemingly senseless patterns... Having previously seen or simultaneously watching Age 13 most definitely would help the listener along." ...|$|E
500|$|Critics {{were also}} divided about the game's {{graphics}} and pacing. Destructoid stated that [...] "while detailed, most environments alternate between concrete gray and brick red." [...] GameSpot echoed {{criticism of the}} [...] "lack of visual variety." [...] IGN added that [...] "the world map and dungeons are crying for more detail." [...] Despite this, Destructoid allowed that [...] "the colorful clothing helps offset the game's otherwise limited palette." [...] IGN disliked the fact that [...] "large difficulty spikes are interjected every now and then" [...] and [...] "Resonance of Fate is built for those that enjoy the grind." [...] In contrast, the GameSpot reviewer liked {{this aspect of the}} game, [...] "You need to use every trick you have learned, and a few <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> have even realized yet, to tackle these treacherous monsters, but there is nothing quite as sweet as toppling something that has tormented you for so long." ...|$|E

500|$|Approached by Rhimes {{about the}} concept, Strickland {{agreed to the}} storyline on the {{conditions}} {{that it would not}} be limited to a single episode and would significantly impact the character. She liked the script, describing it as [...] "humanizing the victims and just really creating a legitimate experience for the audience in a way that <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> see on network television". As well as communicating with RAINN representatives, the actress visited the Rape Treatment Center at UCLA Medical Center in Santa Monica and saw a young girl being admitted, which shaped her performance. Strickland also researched reactions to sexual assault by survivors, their friends and families. The decision to portray King's resistance to reporting her rape was reached after consultation with the Rape Treatment Center. Strickland defended the choice, calling it an essential aspect of King's character development. Most of the episode focused on King's psychological response to the rape.

Kelley stated [...] "it's obvious that someone has done Williams wrong" [...] from the lyrics in the album's the songs, and noted its similarity to Lavigne's previous studio album Under My Skin (2004). Tony Pascarella of The Trades said that [...] "these passionate, rocking tracks are what make this Tennessee group so talented [...] Paramore is a band <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> yet have heard of, but look {{for them to make}} a major splash in the very near future."

[...] BuzzFeed included the album at number 13 on their [...] "36 Pop Punk Albums You Need To Hear Before You F——ing Die" [...] list.

500|$|In {{order to}} obtain the {{licences}} needed to open, the Emirates Stadium hosted three non-full capacity events. The first [...] "ramp-up" [...] event was a shareholder open day on 18 July 2006, the second an open training session for 20,000 selected club members held two days later. The third event was Dennis Bergkamp's testimonial match against Ajax on 22 July 2006. The Emirates Stadium was officially opened by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh on 26 October 2006; his wife Queen Elizabeth II had suffered a back injury {{and was unable to}} carry out her duty. Prince Philip quipped to the crowd, [...] "Well, <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> have my wife, but you've got the second-most experienced plaque unveiler in the world." [...] The royal visit echoed the attendance of the Queen's uncle, the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VIII) at the official opening of Highbury's West Stand in 1932. As a result of the change of plan, the Queen extended to the club the honour of inviting the chairman, manager and first team to join her for afternoon tea at Buckingham Palace. Held on on 15 February 2007, the engagement marked the first time a football club had been invited to the palace for such an event.|$|E

500|$|... 7 Khoon Maaf {{released}} to universal critical acclaim and Chopra's performance was singled out in particular, with many reviewers describing it as [...] "a {{role of a}} lifetime". Aniruddha Guha of the Daily News and Analysis rated the film a four (out of five) and wrote, [...] "For a filmmaker who has long established his hold over the craft, 7 Khoon Maaf {{is the only way}} forward – it pushes the envelope and takes you on a cinematic journey <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> experience in a Hindi film {{for a long time to}} come". She praised Chopra's performance: [...] "Priyanka Chopra takes on a character that most of her contemporaries would shy away from and enacts it in a way that only she possibly can. For a woman with as many shades as Susanna, Chopra gets a crack at a role of a lifetime. And Bhardwaj ensures she sparkles like never before". The Indo-Asian News Service described the film as a [...] "winner" [...] by Vishal Bhardwaj, rating it four out of five: [...] "Chalk up an absolute winner for the Vishal Bhardwaj-Priyanka Chopra team. They make a coherent vision out of an inconceivable marital crises." [...] Zee News also rated the film four out of five: [...] "Vishal Bhardwaj does it again.

500|$|Enio Chiola of PopMatters, {{included}} the song {{on his list}} of [...] "Top 15 Madonna Singles of All Time". He opined that [...] " [...] features a more demure Madonna, confident in her termination of a doomed relationship, and the music is accented by characteristically Asian orchestration and lovely poetic lyrics", concluding that [...] " [...] quickly learned that the {{way back into the}} public's collective hearts was to focus more attention on the music than on the frankness of her sexual image". In his 2011 review of Bedtime Stories, Brett Callwood of the Detroit Metro Times called the song [...] "spectacular". NPR Multimedia senior producer Keith Jenkins gave a positive review of the song, stating that it [...] "washes over you and gets your blood boiling. <b>You</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> walk on water after hearing it, but you may want to get your focus back by walking on broken glass". Louis Virtel, from TheBacklot.com, placed [...] "Take a Bow" [...] at number 27 of his list [...] "The 100 Greatest Madonna Songs". He wrote; [...] "Madonna's most successful single to date is a melancholic evisceration of a lover's artifice, and its hopeless plain-spokenness makes it one of the finest examples of 90s balladry". Rikky Rooksby, author of The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, was less impressed with the track. Although he felt that it sounded [...] "shockingly normal" [...] after the [...] "ambient 'Bedtime Story'", he found the song's length as over-long and deduced it to be [...] "communica no sense whatsoever of the pain of a real goodbye." ...|$|E
500|$|... {{the film}} had {{a rating of}} 29% on review {{aggregator}} website Rotten Tomatoes. Vincent Canby of The New York Times noted that Madonna, left to her own devices and her own canny pace, is a very engaging comedian. [...] "When Madonna's no-nonsense pragmatism isn't being twisted into poses of lovable eccentricity, the actress is sexy and funny and never for a minute sentimental. At times she looks amazingly like Marilyn Monroe, but the personality is her own, more resilient and more knowing. As the WASP-y sleeping prince, Mr. Dunne gives the most stylishly comic performance of a career that's been largely underrated by the public. Though {{he seems to be}} Madonna's foil, he provides the movie with its backbone, even in its most ludicrous moments. He may well {{be one of the most}} truly sophisticated straight men in the business today." [...] However, he ended the review by saying that the film was short on outright guffaws. Hal Hinson of The Washington Post gave the film a mixed review, commenting that [...] "you may not feel as if you've seen a movie. <b>You</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> quite know what you've seen" [...] and that although he laughed too much, the film [...] "is outrageously inept, but not in a routine manner". Hinson also criticized the work of Foley, noting that he [...] "doesn't have the skill to sustain a cartoon style." [...] Philip Wuntch of The Dallas Morning News commented that the film is a deft and daffy comedy performance; Madonna is great with the one-liners. [...] As a movie star, Madonna may be an acquired taste. But one thing is certain: acquiring this particular taste is going to be an enjoyable experience." [...] Jay Boyar of the Orlando Sentinel gave a negative review saying, [...] "Luckily for her, Madonna can sing, and use it to save herself from this disgrace of a movie." ...|$|E
