500|$|Prison Break {{features}} a serialized story structure, {{similar to that}} of its first season companion show 24. At the 2009 TV Critics Press Tour, Kevin Reilly told reporters that the series would end with the fourth season. Despite decreasing ratings, Reilly attributed the cancellation to creativity: [...] "The show has just played out. <b>You</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> point creatively where you feel all the stories have been told, and you want to end strong and not gimp out in the end of the season." [...] Regarding the finale, Reilly stated, [...] "They have a really cool ending, actually. I know where they end, and it's a hell of an idea." ...|$|E
500|$|The album {{title is}} rooted in the idea of [...] "yielding to nature," [...] a theme central to Daniel Quinn's novel Ishmael. The band members read the book while working on the album. Regarding the title, McCready said, [...] "I think the title Yield has to do with maybe being more {{comfortable}} within ourselves, with this band....we're all a little bit older and a little more relaxed and maybe just kind of yielding to those anxieties and not trying to fight it so much...That's what it kind of feels to me– yielding, letting something else happen and going with it." [...] Vedder said, [...] "Let's say that hypothetically speaking, the title does mean something...You can fight so much, {{and then you have to}} think, 'What are the real battles?' 'What's really important?' <b>You</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> certain point, and it's really hard to remember what music is and to remember what drives you." ...|$|E
500|$|Actress and dancer Zoë Lister {{was cast}} {{in the role of}} Zoe. On 8 June 2009, media {{entertainment}} website Digital Spy revealed that Lister had quit the soap and would leave {{towards the end of the}} year. Speaking of her decision to quit, Lister stated: [...] "It's scary but also very, very exciting. I think three years in a soap is enough to do and <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> point where you either make a decision that this is what you do or you want to try something different." [...] She also revealed that she had been planning to leave the series one year prior to announcement. Lister's decision to quit matched that of co-star Loui Batley (Sarah Barnes). Hollyoaks officially announced on 23 July 2009 that both Lister and Batley would leave towards the end of the year in a storyline that would see [...] "A tragic curtain call for one of them", later revealing that either Sarah or Zoe would be killed off in a dramatic storyline. Lister also revealed in an interview with Heat magazine that she was [...] "nervous", but [...] "very excited" [...] about leaving the show.|$|E

500|$|During the Hanover Quay {{sessions}} in 2008, Bono {{indicated that he}} had become [...] "tired of [...] the first-person", leading him to write songs {{from the perspective of}} different characters. He invented [...] "a traffic cop, a junkie [...] a soldier serving in Afghanistan." [...] Although each character tells a personal story, the underlying theme of the album is peripheral vision, events taking place in the wider world, [...] "just at the edges". Bono described it as [...] "central to the understanding of this album". Nevertheless, as the characters narrate there is an intentional [...] "shutting out" [...] of the wider world, so that the focus remains on their [...] "personal epiphanies". The narrative the group originally planned for the album was broken up in the sessions' final weeks with their changes to the track listing. Bono revealed that numbers were significant in many of the songs, and that the album was split into thirds; he described the first section as [...] "a whole world unto itself, and <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> very ecstatic place", and the second as [...] "a load of singles". The final third is composed of songs that are [...] "unusual territory" [...] for the band.|$|E
500|$|Early in the series, Clark {{was still}} {{learning}} how to handle his life, by learning to control his powers and find the best solution for everyone. His main priority was {{to fit in with}} his friends at school and be an average guy. Initially, Clark's biggest problem was the fact that he could not share his secret with anyone he cared about. According to Welling, [...] "He is burdened with a lot of responsibility. He hasn't been able to choose whether or not he has these abilities. All this responsibility has just been thrust on him, and he has to deal with it. There have got to be times when he goes home and thinks to himself, ‘Why me?' He wishes it could all go away and he could just be normal. That's part of the character dilemma which makes him interesting to play." [...] Welling noted that the show was not about Clark always saving the day, but more about how using his powers [...] "... alienate him from others". Welling reasoned {{that by the end of}} season three, Clark had decided that leaving Smallville and going with Jor-El was something that would save everyone a lot of pain in the long run. Welling described why Clark finally gave in to Jor-El at the end of season three:"If you can't fight them, you might as well join them [...] he was choosing the lesser of two evils to go with Jor-El. I think a combination of those two things would probably sum it up. A lot of times in your life, <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> point where you go, 'I just can't fight this anymore. There's nothing I can do about it, so I better get up out of bed and go to work!' And in a sense, that's what Clark had to do. Somehow he had to try to face what it was that was causing him so much pain—and everyone else so much pain—and maybe he reasoned that by causing everyone else a little bit of pain, he could save them a lot of pain in the long run." ...|$|E

50|$|If {{there is}} enough space {{between you and the}} {{attacker}}, you will have time to turn up some face-down pieces before the attacker closes on <b>you.</b> If <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> open area at least 2 x 2 in size, you can use that “rotation space” <b>to</b> dodge <b>a</b> single enemy piece by sidestepping.

2500|$|Game Revolution's Duke Ferris {{scored the}} game a B+, praising the graphics, but criticizing the {{difficulty}} level, writing [...] "you have unlimited lives in MDK2, {{and it is}} a strictly linear game with fixed checkpoints. This means that when <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> hard section, your only choice is to do {{it over and over again}} until you get to the next checkpoint. After playing the exact same level for the 30th time, this can get frustrating." [...] However, he concluded, [...] "the non-frustrating times in MDK 2 are simply tons of fun. The game is genuinely funny, has great voices and a terrific comic book flair." ...|$|E
2500|$|During a UFC 128 post-fight {{interview}} with Ariel Helwani, Evans {{stated that he}} was done training at Jackson's Martial Arts in preparation for his fight with Jon Jones. [...] He then commenced training at Imperial Athletics in Boca Raton, Florida, at a new camp co-founded by Evans and several Brazilian fighters who had concomitantly left American Top Team due to a dispute over management services; these were later joined by some African-American fighters, {{and as a result}} the camp's members became known colloquially as the [...] "Blackzilians," [...] especially on Twitter. Evans gave further insight to MMAWeekly about his leaving Jackson's Submission Fighting, “When <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> certain point, you really need a lot of time (with the coaches)… make sure you get the one-on-one, and you just need different things,” he explained. “After being at Jackson’s for a while, with so many people at the gym, it just got harder and harder for me to get that time." ...|$|E

50|$|Note {{that in this}} defense, if {{you pull}} the middle guard and replace him with <b>a</b> middle linebacker, <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> early version of the 4-3 defense. Conversely, {{if you take a}} 4-3 defense and replace the middle linebacker with a middle guard, then you convert a 4-3 into a 5-2 Eagle. This latter switch is {{historically}} significant in at least one game. In 1972, George Allen pulled his middle linebacker, replacing him with defensive lineman Manny Sistrunk, defeating Green Bay in a playoff game with his unexpected five man front, shutting down the Packers' powerful rushing combination of John Brockington and MacArthur Lane.|$|R

2500|$|R singer-songwriter Frank Ocean {{wrote the}} ballad [...] "Scared of Beautiful" [...] for the album. Ocean {{previously}} co-wrote [...] "1st & Love" [...] and [...] "Locket (Locked in Love)" [...] with Rich King for Norwood's Human (2008) album. [...] "Scared of Beautiful" [...] was originally {{conceived as a}} duet between Norwood and Ocean, and features the duo exchanging lyrics about looking forwards and not backwards, with lines such as [...] "I wonder why there's no mirrors on these walls no more/ You can't tell me why you're so terrified of beautiful". However the final version features just Norwood. Speaking on how the song came about Norwood said, [...] "Well, he had the song {{for a while and}} when I heard it, it really just spoke to me. Sometimes <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> point in your life where you’re scared to be great, you’re scared to be beautiful, you’re scared to be the best version of you and you talk to yourself and you try to get yourself back on track.

Ah! what, you are getting peevish again? You won't wait? Impatient old man, what a life your wife must lead, if you have got one! Remember the bridge.

So far as I can find out there is nothing particular about it, except that it is lukewarm water, neither hot enough nor cold enough to make it a pleasant drink. It didn't seem to agree with Jone at first, but after he kept at it three or four days it began to suit him better, so that he could take nearly a tumbler without feeling badly. Two or three times I felt it might be better for my health if I didn't drink it, but I wanted to stand by Jone as much as I could, and so I kept on.|$|E

There are no {{provisions}} for foundations, thickness of walls, size of timbers and columns, and if these houses had been deliberately erected {{to make a}} bonfire they couldn't have answered the purpose better. If {{it were not for}} the danger to life and the pity of making thousands of families homeless, a conflagration would be a blessing, although I believe the entire north or south side of the city would go under certain conditions. The best thing you could do would be to burn whole rows of these tenements, they are ideal breeding grounds for disease. In the older sections of the city you've got hundreds of rear houses here, houses moved back on the lots, in some extreme cases with only four-foot courts littered with refuse,--houses without light, without ventilation, and many of the rooms where these people are cooking and eating and sleeping are so damp and foul they're not fit to put dogs in.
