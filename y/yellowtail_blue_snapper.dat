50|$|Chrysiptera parasema, {{also known}} as <b>yellowtail</b> damselfish, <b>yellowtail</b> <b>blue</b> damsel, goldtail demoiselle, and other variations, is a popular {{saltwater}} aquarium fish from the Indo-Pacific. It was described by Fowler in 1918.|$|R
40|$|About 50 kg {{of yellow}} tail <b>blue</b> <b>snappers</b> (Paracaesio xanthurus) locally called as “methi meen” {{belonging}} to family Lutjanidae were landed by mechanised gillnetters at Chennai Fishing Harbour in July 2011. On 17 th July 2011, about 300 kg of P. xanthurus was landed by ring seine at Mahabalipuram area from {{a depth of}} about 30 fathom...|$|R
50|$|C. parasema is {{blue with}} a {{distinctive}} yellow caudal fin (tail fin). The yellow coloring may {{extend up to}} the back of the anal and dorsal fins, especially in species from Papua New Guinea. These fish may also have yellow pelvic or pectoral fins. However, yellow is never found on the backs or bellies of <b>Yellowtail</b> <b>Blue</b> damsels. A yellow belly likely indicates that the fish is actually an Azure demoiselle, whereas yellow areas on the nose or chin may indicate that it is a Blue Devil damsel.|$|R

5000|$|A {{group of}} playing card-themed Time Shifters {{made up of}} Blademan the Swordsman (spade, red), Thud the All-Powerful (clover, green), Arrowman the Archer (diamond, <b>blue),</b> and <b>Snapper</b> the Camera Whiz (heart, pink). They are modeled on The Three Musketeers and J.A.K.Q. Dengekitai. The four can merge while {{transforming}} into their powered forms. Cardian-Con (Akuman) is a centipede monster that looks similar to a jester-like Grim Reaper with the four faces on its different segments. Cardian-Master (Sūpā Reddoman) {{on the other hand}} is a knight equipped with a sword and shield. Found in 2000 during Dr. Goodman's teenage time in Tokyo.|$|R
5000|$|The State of Connecticut {{now owns}} {{the island and}} {{it is part of}} Silver Sands State Park. It is {{designated}} a Natural Area Preserve for the local bird population of herons and egrets. White-tail deer were common, but the estimated 16 deer on the island were hunted by the Department of Environment Protection (now the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection) in February 2011 to protect the nesting birds. [...] The waters around the island have bluefish, <b>snapper</b> <b>blues,</b> sand sharks, and horseshoe crabs.|$|R
5000|$|Originally, the concourses had {{names and}} each turn was {{considered}} a rotunda or court and named for the style of stores it contained. The original mall concourses (running west to east) were Modern Main Street, Mediterranean Main Street, Art Deco Main Street and Caribbean Main Street. The courts were (running west to east) Entertainment Court, Cabana Court, Video Court, Rotunda Court and New Ideas Court. This proved harder to keep in effect as anchors and internal stores changed. Later, Mall Entrances were named after the parking lot areas, i.e., Yellow Toucan, Green Toad, Purple Parrot, White Seahorse, Red <b>Snapper,</b> <b>Blue</b> Dolphin, Pink Flamingo and New Ideas Court. In the mid-2000s, inspired by rival Dolphin Mall in Miami, the mall transitioned into the current [...] "Avenues" [...] sections.|$|R
50|$|Leduck Island is {{an island}} in the United States Virgin Islands, also spelled LeDuck Island, which is located 0.5 miles east of Sabbat Point in Johns Folly, {{separated}} from Saint John by the Sabbat Channel. LeDuck Island lies by the entrance to Coral Bay and is 85 feet high. Leduck Island is located within the Virgin Islands National Park {{and is one of the}} largest offshore islands to Saint John, along with Grass Cay and Congo Cay. Being home to numerous spur and groove reefs, it is a popular scuba diving destinations and its reefs are habitat for an abundance for endemic tropical fish species. Some of the fish species found here include the Fairy basslet, Sergeant major, French angelfish, Gray angelfish, Queen triggerfish, Jackknife-fish, <b>Blue</b> chromis, Schoolmaster <b>snapper,</b> Mangrove snapper, Red hind, Blacktip shark, Hawksbill sea turtle, Glassy sweeper, Squirrelfish, and numerous species of damsels and jacks.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Natural Resources: Fisheries, 2014 Groundfish {{stocks are}} {{typically}} managed on a regional scale delineated by geographical or geopolitical boundaries. However, fleet and stock dynamics often operate on finer spatial scales, thereby leading to variable impacts of fishing within regional boundaries, {{which may be}} evident in the size and age structure of some fishes. This study is designed to examine {{the validity of the}} assumption that historic fishing effort on rocky reefs along California???s North Coast is inversely correlated with distance-from-port. Data collection involved hook-and-line sampling at randomly selected ???rocky habitat??? cells within each of six depth by distance-from-port strata associated with each of three ports: Crescent City Harbor, Trinidad Bay, and Noyo River Harbor. Size structure effects were assessed for six species of rockfish (Sebastes spp. : black, <b>blue,</b> <b>yellowtail,</b> China, gopher, and canary) and two species of Hexagrammidae: lingcod, and kelp greenling. Age data, based on reading sagittal otoliths, were generated for the two most abundant species, black rockfish and blue rockfish. Analysis results suggested a significant positive effect of distance-from-port on the lengths and ages of black rockfish. This effect was variable among ports. Results for species other than black rockfish, which were limited by smaller sample sizes, suggested that the response of length and age data to historic fishing pressure is also variable among species. These findings support an assumption that distance-from-port may act as a proxy for historic fishing pressure within the study region, but the effect of distance-from-port on lengths and ages of species varies by port and by species due to a variety of possible factors. Results from this study may be useful for localized management of black rockfish...|$|R
40|$|The {{geomorphology}} of Cockburn Sound {{is unique}} to the lower west coast of Australia due to the relative paucity of sheltered nearshore marine embayments along this coastline. Numerous studies {{on many of the}} commercially and/or recreationally important species that inhabit Cockburn Sound have demonstrated that for many of them this marine embayment constitutes an integral part of their life history. Since the commencement of industrial and urban development in the mid 1950 s, in the waters and along the shores of Cockburn Sound, the marine fauna utilising this area have been exposed to ongoing changes in environmental quality. These detrimental, anthropogenic influences have impacted on many attributes that affect the faunal composition, including, for example, habitat alteration and/or loss. Recent data has also revealed that blue swimmer crab stocks in Cockburn Sound are more vulnerable than previously thought with this fishery collapsing in 2005 / 06. The broader impacts of the declining numbers of crabs on the ecology, i. e. predator-prey relationships, are unknown. Likewise, adult populations of snapper in the lower west coast region have been identified as being low/depleted. Recent studies on the biology of snapper have identified the nearshore marine embayments of Owen Anchorage, Cockburn and Warnbro Sounds as important sources of recruitment for the adult population. Until recently, very little research had been done on the structure of the faunal community in these embayments to which <b>blue</b> swimmer crab, <b>snapper</b> and other commercially and/or recreationally important species belong. A broader understanding of the diversity of fauna that resides in this marine embayment will provide insights into their ecological interactions and thus aid in their sustainable management...|$|R
