500|$|... "Homeless" [...] {{was written}} by Swedish {{songwriter}} Jörgen Elofsson, and produced by Steve Mac. It is an R power ballad, which lasts for a duration of three minutes and 50 seconds. The song was composed on common time in the key of B minor at 68beats per minute. Instrumentation is provided by a piano and a guitar. Lewis's vocal range spans nearly two octaves from low note of A3 to the high note of B5. The song's lyrics revolve around Lewis singing about waiting for her boyfriend {{to come home to}} where she is waiting for him, but feels homeless without his presence. The opening lyrics are [...] "Wait here for <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> me/ For you to tell me that ev'rything's a big mistake." [...] Nick Levine for Digital Spy described Lewis's vocals in the lyric [...] "In this cold I'm walking aimless, feeling helpless" [...] as [...] "a tour de force of despair and misery".|$|E
500|$|The school {{treated the}} {{incident}} seriously and called police {{to the school}} {{in the days after}} the noose incident. The principal called an assembly on September 6, 2006. The Jena Police Department asked Parish Attorney Walters to attend and speak at the assembly. Already pressed for time due to a case under preparation, Walters felt that the students were not paying proper attention to him. He warned them, [...] "I can be your best friend or your worst enemy. With the stroke of a pen I can make life miserable for you or ruin your life. So I want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> me before you do something stupid." [...] Though black students say Walters was looking at them when he made the comments, Walters and school board member Billy Fowler, also present, deny it. Walters said that he was irritated at [...] "two or three girls, white girls, [...] were chit-chatting on their cellphones or playing with their cellphones".|$|E

2500|$|Regarding {{suggestions}} that renaming efforts stem from egotism or personal pique, Stallman has responded that his interest {{is not in}} giving credit to himself but to the GNU Project: [...] "Some people think that it's because I want my ego to be fed. Of course, I'm not asking <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> it 'Stallmanix'." [...] Stallman has admitted to irritation, although he believes it to be justified in response to seeing [...] "an idealistic project stymied and made ineffective, because people don't usually give it the credit for what it has done," [...] concluding [...] "If you're an idealist like me, that can ruin your whole decade." ...|$|E
2500|$|American {{ambassador}} Nicholas Vliotes {{boarded the}} Achille Lauro to confirm Craxi's information about Klinghoffer's death. He found De Rosa distraught, learned that Molqi {{had held the}} {{gun to his head}} during the ship-to-shore communication that claimed all the hostages were healthy. De Rosa in tears handed the ambassador Klinghoffer's passport. Veliotes called the American embassy with the ship-to-shore radio to give orders [...] "Leon Klinghoffer was murdered by the terrorists off of Tartus when {{they were trying to get}} the attention of the Syrians. In my name, I want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> the [...] foreign minister, tell him what we learned, tell him the circumstances, tell him in view of this and the fact that we – and presumably them – didn't have those facts, we insist that they prosecute those sons of bitches." ...|$|E

5000|$|Of his {{professional}} career in newspapers, LeDuff states: [...] "I’m not a journalist, I’m a reporter. The {{difference between a}} reporter and a journalist is that a journalist can type without looking. The problem with journalism is its self-importance. Like in the New York Times, there’s style guides; you can’t call a doctor a physician, <b>you</b> got <b>to</b> <b>call</b> him a doctor- too high falutin’. You can’t call an undertaker a mortician- too high falutin’; <b>you</b> got <b>to</b> <b>call</b> him an undertaker. You can’t call a lawyer an attorney, <b>you</b> have <b>to</b> <b>call</b> him a lawyer. But somehow, since we control it, and we’re very self-important people, you can call a reporter a journalist." ...|$|R
