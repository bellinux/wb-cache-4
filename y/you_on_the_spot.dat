After that we will settle the remuneration. Meanwhile, shake hands again, and allow me to express to you my {{appreciation}} of the noble character of your brother, who, I understand from my sister's letter, saved a young relative of mine from the midst of imminent danger.

And did they confer a title on <b>you</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>spot?</b> Say, art thou Elector, or Palsgrave, or Baron; or, failing in thy devoirs, as once did our good cousin Arnelm, confess that thou wert ordained with becoming reverence the Archprimate of Puddledrink. Eh! Arnelm, is not that the style thou bearest at the Palace of the Wines?" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{continue}} to scribble, though with relaxed continuity while abroad; but I can't {{talk to you}} about it. One thing only is clear, that henceforth I must do, or half do, England in fiction--as the place I see most today, and, in a sort of way, know best. I have at last more acquired notions of it, on the whole, than of any other world, and it will serve as well as any other. It has been growing distincter that America fades from me, and as she never trusted me at best, I can trust her, for effect, no longer. Besides I can't be doing de chic, from here, when <b>you,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>spot,</b> are doing so brilliantly the vécu....|$|E
6000|$|... "A big coterie, then! It's {{only that}} at the best. A nasty, prim, 'official' woman who's perched on her little local {{pedestal}} and thinks she's a queen for ever because she's ridiculous for an hour! Oh you needn't tell me, I've seen them abroad--the dreariest females--and could imitate them here. I could do one for <b>you</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> if I weren't so tired. It's scarcely worth mentioning perhaps all this while--but I'm ready to drop." [...] She picked up the white mantle she had tossed off, flinging it round her with her usual amplitude of gesture. [...] "They're waiting for me and I confess I'm hungry. If I don't hurry they'll eat up all the nice things. Don't say I haven't been obliging, and come back when you're better. Good-night." ...|$|E
6000|$|Strether {{followed}} afresh, {{but looking}} as he went. [...] "Certainly--in a manner. But it would scarce be a triumph worth having if, once entangled, feeling her dislike and possibly conscious {{in time of}} a certain quantity of your own, <b>you</b> should <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> make yourself unpleasant to her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No doubt, no doubt," [...] said Alexander, [...] "but {{then you}} see <b>you</b> aren't always <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> to have <b>the</b> thing {{explained}} to you. Last night, for instance--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Who were they? I hope <b>you</b> hung them <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>spot,</b> as I bade,' {{continued}} Henry, coughing {{between his}} sentences, and almost {{in spite of}} himself, putting {{his hand to his}} side.|$|R
6000|$|... "After all, {{now that}} I {{come to think}} of it, it is as well that you should not leave home at present, as {{there will be plenty of}} executor's {{business}} to keep <b>you</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>spot.</b> No doubt you will hear from your late uncle's lawyers, Thomas and Thomas, and as soon as you do so you had better go over to Seaview and take formal possession of it and its contents as an executor of the will. I have no time to write more at present, as the undertaker is waiting to see me about the last arrangements for the interment, which takes place at the English cemetery here. The poor man has gone, but at least we may reflect that he can be no more troubled by sickness, etc., and it is a consolation to know that he has made arrangements so eminently proper under the circumstances.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have had}} another narrow escape," [...] Mr. Goodenough said. [...] "I see that your ball last night broke {{one of his}} hind legs. That spoilt his spring. Had {{it not been for}} that he would {{undoubtedly}} have reached you, and a blow with his paw, given with all his weight and impetus, would probably have killed <b>you</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>spot.</b> We ought not to have stood near a tree strong enough to bear him when in pursuit of a wounded leopard. They will always take to trees if they can, and you see this was a very suitable one for him. This bough on which he was lying starts from the trunk only about four feet from the ground, so that even with his broken leg he was able to get upon it without difficulty. Well, thank God, you've not been hurt, my boy. It will teach us both to be more careful in future." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Mr. Craig," [...] said she, [...] "this is no laughin' matter. What me and Mrs. Aleshine is sayin' is {{for your}} good, and {{for the good of}} Miss Ruth along with you. I haven't much opinion of her father, but his money is as good as anybody else's, and though they had to leave their trunks on board their ship, what little they brought with them shows that they've been used to havin' the best there is. Mrs. Aleshine and me has set up till late into the night talkin' over this thing, and we are both of one mind that you two need never expect to have the same chance again that you've got now. The very fact that the old gentleman is a preacher, and can marry <b>you</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>spot,</b> ought to make you tremble when you think of the risks you are runnin' by puttin' it off." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Tristram kissed her. Newman {{expressed}} his thanks, {{and she took}} her leave. Her hostess went {{with her to the}} door, and left Newman alone a moment. Presently she returned, rubbing her hands. [...] "It was a fortunate chance," [...] she said. [...] "She had come to decline my invitation. <b>You</b> triumphed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>spot,</b> making her ask you, at the end of three minutes, to her house." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. But <b>you</b> are not <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> when <b>you</b> are wanted. You {{know you}} weren't. That steward of yours wouldn't dare to neglect {{a message from}} this office. Where the devil did you hide {{yourself}} for {{the best part of}} the day?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have sent}} for surveyors, {{and we will}} run our own lines early to-morrow morning, after which an officer shall be {{stationed}} there to warn him from encroaching. <b>You</b> must be <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> {{as early as possible}} to attend to matters." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wake up, Mat! You {{shall have}} your fair chance with the lady, {{along with the}} rest of us; and I'll {{undertake}} to qualify <b>you</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> for civilized courtship," [...] continued Zack, pitilessly carrying on his joke. [...] "In the first place, always remember that you mustn't go beyond admiration at a respectful distance, to begin with. At the second interview, you may make amorous faces at close quarters--what you call looking unutterable things, you know. At the third, you may get bold, and try her with a little present. Lots of people have done that, before you. Gimble tried it, and Bullivant wanted to; but Blyth wouldn't let him; and I mean to give her--oh, by the bye, I have another important caution for you." [...] Here he indulged himself in a fresh burst of laughter, excited by the remembrance of his interview with Mrs. Peckover, in Mr. Blyth's hall. [...] "Remember that the whole round of presents is open for you to choose from, except one; and that one is a Hair Bracelet." ...|$|E
60|$|I must bless <b>you</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> {{for your}} dear {{letter of the}} 22nd--continued on the 31st. I clutch so at {{everything}} that concerns and emanates from you all that I kind of pine for the need of it all the while--or at any rate am immensely and positively bettered by every scrap of the dear old Library life that you can manage to waft over to me.... I find, naturally, that I can think of you all, and mingle with you so, ever so much more vividly than I could of old--through the effect of all those weeks and months of last year--which have had at any rate that happy result, that I have the constant image of your days and doings. You must think now very cheerfully and relievedly of mine--because distinctly, yes, dear brave old London is working my cure. The conditions here were what I needed all the while that I was {{so far away from}} them--I mean because they are of the kind materially best addressed to helping me to work my way back to an equilibrium.... I shall see how it works--from 10.30 to 1.30 each day--and let you hear more; but it represents the yearning effort really to get, more surely and swiftly now, up to my neck into the book about William and the rest of us. I have written to Harry to ask him for certain of the young, youthful letters (copies of them) which I didn't bring away with me--on the other hand I have found some six or eight very precious ones mixed up with the mass of Father's that I have with me (thrust into Father's envelopes etc.) Of Father's, alas, very few are useable; they are so intensely domestic, private and personal.|$|E
6000|$|This communication, let me, {{without a}} shred of coyness, {{instantly}} declare, much interests and engages me--to the degree even that I think I find myself prepared to post <b>you</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> a round, or a square, Rather! I won't go through any simpering as to the goodness of your [...] "having thought of me"--nor even through any frank gaping (though there might be, for my admiration and awe, plenty of that!) over the wonder of your multiform activity and dauntlessly universal life. Basta that I will write anything in life that anyone asks me in decency--and a fortiori that you so gracefully ask. I can only feel it to be enough for me {{that you have a}} hand in the affair, that you are giving a book yourself and engaging yourself otherwise, and that I am in short in your company. What I understand is that my little novel shall be of fifty thousand (50,000) words, neither more, I take it, nor less; and that I shall receive the sum mentioned in the prospectus [...] "down," [...] in advance of royalties, on such delivery. (I shall probably in point of fact, in my financial humility, prefer, when the time comes, to avail myself of the alternative right mentioned in the prospectus--that of taking, instead of a royalty, for the two years [...] "lease," [...] the larger sum formed by the so-much-a-word aggregation. But that I shall be clear about when the work is done; I only glance at this now as probable.) It so happens that I can get at the book, I think, almost immediately and do it within the next three or four months. You will therefore, unless you hear from me a short time hence to the contrary, probably receive it well before December. As for the absoluteness of the [...] "order," [...] I am willing to take it as, practically, sufficiently absolute. If you shouldn't like it, there is something else, definite enough, that I can do with it. What, however, concerns me more than anything else is to take care that you shall like it. I tell myself that I am not afraid! ...|$|E
500|$|According to the Orkneyinga saga, the Northern Isles were Christianised by King Olaf Tryggvasson in 995 when {{he stopped}} at South Walls {{on his way to}} Ireland from Norway.

500|$|The islands {{were fully}} Christianised by Olav Tryggvasson in 995 {{when he stopped}} at South Walls on his way from Ireland to Norway.

If you refuse, I'll have <b>you</b> killed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> and I swear I will ravage every island with fire and steel."

60|$|I can't not thank <b>you</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> {{for your}} so {{interesting}} and moving letter, which reflects to me, relievingly in a manner, all the horror and dismay in which I sit here alone. I {{mean that it}} eases off the appalled sense a little to share that sickness with a fellow-victim {{and be able to}} say a little of what presses on one. What one first feels one's self uttering, no doubt, is but the intense unthinkability of anything so blank and so infamous in an age that we have been living in and taking for our own as if it were of a high refinement of civilisation--in spite of all conscious incongruities; finding it after all carrying this abomination in its blood, finding this to have been what it meant all the while, is like suddenly having to recognise in one's family circle or group of best friends a band of murderers, swindlers and villains--it's just a similar shock. It makes us wonder whom in the world we are now to live with then--and even if with everything publicly and internationally so given away we can live, or want to live, at all. Very hideous to me is the behaviour of that forsworn old pastor of his people, the Austrian Emperor, of whom, so éprouvé and so venerable, one had supposed better things than so interested and so cynical a chucking to the winds of all moral responsibility. Infamous seem to me in such a light all the active great ones of the earth, active for evil, in our time (to speak only of that,) from the monstrous Bismarck down! But il s'agit bien to protest in face of such a world--one can only possess one's soul in such dignity as may be precariously achievable. Almost the worst thing is that the dreadfulness, all of it, may become interesting--to the blight and ruin of our poor dear old cherished source of interest, and in spite of one's resentment at having to live in such a way. With it all too is indeed the terrible sense that {{the people of this country}} may well--by some awful brutal justice--be going to get something bad for the exhibition that has gone on so long of their huge materialized stupidity and vulgarity. I mean the enormous national sacrifice to insensate amusement, without a redeeming idea or a generous passion, that has kept making one ask one's self, from so far back, how such grossness and folly and blatancy could possibly not be in the long run to be paid for. The rate at which we may witness the paying may be prodigious--and then no doubt one will pityingly and wretchedly feel that the intention, after all, was never so bad--only the stupidity constitutional and fatal. That is truly the dismal reflection, and on which you touch, that if anything very bad does happen to the country, there isn't anything like the French intelligence to react--with the flannelled fool at the wicket, the muddied oaf and tutti quanti, representing so much of our preferred intelligence. However, let me pull up with the thought that when I am reduced to--or have come to--quoting Kipling for argument, there may be something the matter with my conclusion. One can but so distressfully wait and so wonderingly watch.|$|E
