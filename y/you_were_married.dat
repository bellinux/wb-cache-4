60|$|PICKERING. But you've {{been through}} it before, man. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>married</b> to Eliza's mother.|$|E
60|$|WALPOLE. Rot! <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>married</b> already {{when you}} married her; and that settles it.|$|E
6000|$|... "But why? When {{you were}} younger, before <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>married,</b> you all {{lived at home}} together--or, perhaps, you were an only child?" ...|$|E
60|$|Dor. Remember, I invade no propriety: my servant <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> only 'till <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>married.</b>|$|R
60|$|Warn. When <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>married,</b> you'll soon make trial, {{whether she}} be a maid or no.|$|R
60|$|Bel. An {{you make}} no better harmony after <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>married,</b> than <b>you</b> have before, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> the miserablest couple in Christendom.|$|R
6000|$|... "For {{the young}} lady's sake. A lady always prefers a young gentleman {{to an old}} one. Only think what you'd feel if <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>married</b> to Mr Whittlestaff." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{we shall}} see," [...] said Lily. [...] "I shouldn't wonder if <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>married</b> first now, Bell. For my part I'm quite {{prepared}} {{to wait for}} three years." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No: it's {{not good}} of me. I'm {{thinking}} of myself--not of you." [...] She suddenly lowered her tone. [...] "I wish <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>married</b> to him," [...] she said.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mary, my dear, sit down,' said Mr. Pickwick, cutting short these compliments. 'Now then; {{how long}} have <b>you</b> <b>been</b> <b>married,</b> eh?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{how long}} had <b>you</b> <b>been</b> <b>married</b> before your husband had that chain-coat?" [...] said Romola, her heart beating faster and faster.|$|R
6000|$|... "This is not right, Mr. Willoughby.--Remember that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>married.</b> Relate {{only what}} in your {{conscience}} you think necessary {{for me to}} hear." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] cried Witherby. [...] "I didn't know <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>married!</b> That's good! There's {{nothing like}} marriage, Mr. Hubbard, {{to keep a}} man {{going in the right}} direction. But you've begun pretty young." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, ma'am; and God {{be praised}} {{that it is}} so. I dreamt, it is now four years, Miss Eve; we were then {{travelling}} among the Denmarkers, and I dreamt that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>married</b> to a great prince--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But seriously, Hawk, {{would you}} want to go to all those places, if <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>married?</b> Would you, practically? You know, even rich globe-trotters go to the same sorts of places, mostly. And we wouldn't even be rich, would we?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Deadt--deadt long ago. Right after I {{got home}} from the war--tventy years ago. But tell me, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>married?</b> Children? Yes! Goodt! And how oldt <b>are</b> <b>you</b> now?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nonsense! When <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>married</b> to Miss Blake, {{you can pay}} me back, if it will be {{a relief}} to you. When's the wedding to be?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, Rosa, well!' said Mrs. Steerforth, as {{the other}} was about to interpose, 'it is no matter. Let it <b>be.</b> <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>married,</b> sir, I <b>am</b> told?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There's {{no one to}} live there. If <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>married</b> {{you might}} perhaps take it." [...] This was of course said in joke, as old Mrs. Morton would have thought Bragton to be disgraced for ever, even by such a proposition.|$|E
60|$|Algernon. Well, my dear fellow, {{you need}} not eat {{as if you were}} going to eat it all. You behave as if <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>married</b> to her already. You are not married to her already, and I don't think you ever will be.|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{had been}} {{conscious}} of the truth before, but she had stifled her misgivings insanely, and, as I feel, almost wickedly, pushing on, and saying to herself that when <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>married,</b> {{then there would be}} no escape, and she must love you." ...|$|E
60|$|MISS FOSTER. They are: as I'm a sinful woman. And {{when will}} <b>you</b> <b>be</b> <b>married,</b> Barbara? and when dear Dorothy? I {{hate to see}} old maids a-making.|$|R
6000|$|... "There you are," [...] said Mr. Evans, {{sweeping}} the things {{into his own}} pockets; [...] "and the day <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>married</b> I hand them back to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sometimes--often, in fact, my dear Aline--you pass all understanding. I shall {{write to}} Quintin that the sooner <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>married</b> {{the better it}} will be for all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was the ring," [...] he said. [...] "I {{knew that}} <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>married,</b> and somehow, knowing that, I desired to know no more. I suppose that sounds {{rather like a}} cry from Noah's Ark, but I couldn't help it. I just felt like that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Quite sufficiently. You can say, if necessary, that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>married</b> {{to him at}} {{the church}} of St. Michael, in Bath City, in my name, as the first that {{occurred}} to you, to escape detection. That was where he married me. I will support you in this.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{must not}} fail," [...] she muttered. [...] "I am nervous these days. I would rather <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>married</b> to Lois, and her money {{was in the}} bank, and that these places were closed. I start when the bell rings. Huntley himself {{said that you were}} rash." ...|$|E
6000|$|Vane stopped him. [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>married</b> to Miss Blake {{you can pay}} me back, if it will be {{a relief}} to you. When's the wedding to be?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he answered; [...] "when <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>married</b> {{he will do}} {{perfectly}} well, {{but until}} that happy event I am afraid that I must take your personal opinion." ...|$|R
60|$|HOTCHKISS. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> in it already. Marriage <b>is</b> a trap. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>married.</b> Any {{man who has}} {{the power}} to spoil your {{marriage}} {{has the power to}} spoil your life. I have that power over you.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why you haven't been here--let me see--since <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>married?</b> I called, you know, but {{you were}} out; and upon my word {{it is such a}} climb after dark that I have been waiting till the days are longer before lumpering up again. I am glad you didn't wait, however." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is the Spaniard's child also, and {{remember}} the curse you told me of, your own curse uttered on this thing before ever <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>married?</b> If it lives that curse shall cling to it, and through it you, too, shall be accursed. Best let me kill it and have done." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; I mean my own {{marriage}} with Lady Mason. We will {{not talk about}} that just at present, and I only mention it to explain that before I do so, I shall settle the property permanently. If <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>married</b> I should at once divide it with you. I should like to keep the old house myself, till I die--" ...|$|E
6000|$|ELEANOR. [...] You {{must not}} believe it, Because I have a {{wholesome}} medicine here Puts that belief asleep. Your answer, beauty! Do {{you believe that}} <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>married</b> to him? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nonsense, child! When <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>married,</b> <b>you</b> {{will know}} that the easiest of all secrets to keep is a secret from your husband. I give you my promise. Now begin!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But that <b>was</b> when <b>you</b> had {{nobody to}} take care of her,' she said quickly. 'How absurd of him to write now! Does he know <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>married?</b> He must, surely.' ...|$|R
