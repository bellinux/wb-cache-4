I will say they proved useful to me, and may to others who read <b>your</b> <b>paper.</b> First, keep the head cool and calm. Second, keep the feet dry and warm. Third, keep the heart free from anger", she wrote.|$|E
2500|$|In 1991, Savage {{was living}} in Madison, Wisconsin, and working as a manager at a local video store that {{specialized}} in independent film titles. He befriended Tim Keck, co-founder of The Onion, who {{announced that he was}} moving to Seattle to help start an alternative weekly newspaper titled The Stranger. Savage [...] "made the offhand comment that forever altered [...] life: 'Make sure <b>your</b> <b>paper</b> has an advice columnâ€”everybody claims to hate 'em, but everybody seems to read 'em'." [...] Savage wrote a sample column, and to his surprise, Keck offered him the job.|$|E
2500|$|The essays were {{originally}} published in consecutive monthly instalments of the new Cornhill Magazine between August and November 1860 and was published in a single volume in 1862. However, its editor, William Makepeace Thackeray, was forced to abandon the series by the outcry of its largely conservative readership and the fears of a nervous publisher (Smith, Elder & Co.). The press reaction was hostile, and Ruskin was, he claimed, [...] "reprobated in a violent manner". His father also strongly disapproved. Others were enthusiastic, including Ruskin's friend, Thomas Carlyle, who wrote, [...] "I have read <b>your</b> <b>paper</b> with exhilaration... such a thing flung suddenly into half a million dull British heads... will do {{a great deal of}} good." ...|$|E
60|$|BRIGADIER. Poetry {{is a great}} {{hindrance}} to {{the ends}} of justice. Well, take <b>your</b> <b>papers.</b>|$|R
60|$|MRS. FARRELL. Ive {{been too}} busy casting an {{unfavorable}} eye on your cloze and on the litther you make with <b>your</b> <b>papers.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{shall have}} <b>your</b> <b>papers</b> without fail {{tomorrow}} early, {{so you can}} safely make your preparations. And now goodbye, and may fortune attend you." ...|$|R
60|$|Thanks for <b>your</b> <b>paper,</b> which I {{have sent}} to the Printer's with much pleasure.|$|E
60|$|You {{probably}} {{already know the}} difference between the actual methods of producing a printed impression from wood and metal; but I may perhaps make the matter a little more clear. In metal engraving, you cut ditches, fill them with ink, and press <b>your</b> <b>paper</b> into them. In wood engraving, you leave ridges, rub the tops of them with ink, and stamp them on <b>your</b> <b>paper.</b>|$|E
60|$|COLONEL. Why don't {{you read}} <b>your</b> <b>paper,</b> then you'd {{see what a}} lot of wild-cat things there are about.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course he}} would! S'posin' a feller smashed {{you in the}} neck, an' knocked <b>your</b> <b>papers</b> in the mud, wouldn't you fight? I guess you would!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] he said. [...] "You are {{not here}} for a picture. A {{thousand}} pardons. Give me <b>your</b> <b>papers.</b> One moment--I {{will return to the}} General and explain." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh! {{you will}} find plenty more in our corps,' {{answered}} the Captain, still in the sneering mood. 'Give up <b>your</b> <b>papers,</b> Mr. Gentleman, and let us see who you really are.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Better {{put this}} thing {{straight}} at once,' said he. 'I must make some fresh arrangements. May I use <b>your</b> <b>paper</b> and envelopes?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly, sir," [...] Burton answered. [...] "If it {{is really}} worth putting in <b>your</b> <b>paper</b> and paying for, you can have plenty more." ...|$|E
60|$|DEAR MR. WHITMEE,--I have {{reflected}} long and fully on <b>your</b> <b>paper,</b> and at your kind request {{give you the}} benefit of my last thoughts.|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{finished}} putting away your few things, my jewel. There, there! why didn't {{you tell me}} to burn <b>your</b> <b>papers</b> for you? You have soiled your dear hands, and ..." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wish you}} would let me sort <b>your</b> <b>papers</b> for you, uncle," [...] said Dorothea. [...] "I would letter them all, and then {{make a list of}} {{subjects}} under each letter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I {{shall have}} to send a thumb-print down {{to the office and}} get your number from that. But are you sure you haven't <b>your</b> <b>papers</b> or numbers? It's very queer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{going to}} put <b>your</b> <b>paper</b> on strong, dashing, enterprising lines," [...] said the King. [...] "Now, where are your posters of last night's defeat?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ay, ay! Very good trade, I should think? You must send me <b>your</b> <b>paper,</b> Felix; I {{want one}} I can trust {{to lie about}} the house.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was a {{singular}} coincidence," [...] she continued, [...] "that at the instant that you called I was reading <b>your</b> <b>paper</b> on 'Locomotor Ataxia,' in the Lancet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Put up {{your bills}} if you choose," [...] {{interrupted}} the Commissary. [...] "In {{an hour or}} so I will examine <b>your</b> <b>papers</b> at the office. But now go; I am busy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, of course; he had to. How'd {{you like}} it if a feller sneaked up an' whacked {{you in the face}} when you wasn't doin' anything, an' knocked <b>your</b> <b>papers</b> in the mud." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will listen}} to you," [...] he said. [...] "You {{referred}} me just now to the consul's letter. The consul tells me you suspected some one of taking <b>your</b> <b>papers</b> and <b>your</b> clothes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "An {{affair of}} money," [...] he exclaimed. [...] "I understand. We will give <b>your</b> <b>paper</b> one, two hundred pounds, {{to make no}} mention of Theos for a week." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Produce <b>your</b> <b>paper,</b> gents," [...] {{continued}} Sanford, with {{a dramatic}} whang of a leathern wallet down into his palm. [...] "I'm buying up all paper on the bank." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not on your tintype it won't," [...] {{said the}} {{stranger}} decidedly. [...] "It won't be needed. Is Mr. Maude on <b>your</b> <b>paper?</b> That's all right, then. I can go ahead." ...|$|E
3000|$|In {{your own}} research, you have drawn very richly from {{different}} fields. Many of <b>your</b> <b>papers</b> are {{great examples of}} interdisciplinary work. What {{do you see as}} the main challenges in this approach? [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "Quietly--too quietly. I'm 'most {{afraid of}} her. She's here--I {{went over to}} Forster's for her. Insists on staying in the house. I'll send {{somebody}} around with <b>your</b> <b>papers,</b> and then go along with you." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Green was abashed a moment. But he {{recovered}} quickly; {{no doubt he}} had met the cool type before. [...] "Come, come!" [...] said he. [...] "No blustering. Out with <b>your</b> <b>papers,</b> my fine fellow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When did {{you ever}} ask me {{anything}} that I did not tell you? You remember, for example, my giving you the material for <b>your</b> <b>paper</b> about {{the temple of the}} Vestals." ...|$|E
6000|$|SIR,--Will {{you allow}} me to correct some errors into which your critic has fallen in his review of my story, The Picture of Dorian Gray, {{published}} in today's issue of <b>your</b> <b>paper?</b> ...|$|E
60|$|Sir, {{upon the}} whole, <b>your</b> <b>paper</b> {{is a very}} crude piece, liable to more {{objections}} than there are lines; but I think your meaning is good, and so far you are pardonable.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, indeed. You will be detained, of course, {{but you are}} not prisoners--as yet. I {{will keep}} <b>your</b> <b>papers</b> and submit them to the general staff. It will be for that august body to decide." ...|$|R
6000|$|God {{bless you}} for your {{kindness}} to us, and try to forgive me for touching <b>your</b> <b>papers.</b> But I thought that you would detect it, know WHY I did it, and then help us, as you did! Good-by! ...|$|R
6000|$|In evasion of {{this hard}} {{question}} the unreal editor temporized with {{the effect of}} not having heard it. [...] "I believe that he and Mr. Mitchell were the only writers of <b>your</b> <b>papers</b> till Mr. Alden wrote the last?" ...|$|R
