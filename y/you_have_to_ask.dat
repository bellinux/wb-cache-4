500|$|Radiohead's six-album record {{contract}} with EMI {{ended with the}} release of Hail to the Thief. In 2005, Yorke told Time: [...] "I like the people at our record company, but the time is at hand when <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> why anyone needs one. And, yes, it probably would give us some perverse pleasure to say 'Fuck you' to this decaying business model." [...] In 2006, the New York Times described Radiohead as [...] "by far the world's most popular unsigned band".|$|E
500|$|As Radiohead's six-album {{contract}} with EMI ended after the 2003 release of Hail to the Thief, Radiohead recorded In Rainbows without a record contract. In 2005, Yorke told Time: [...] "I {{like the people}} at our record company, but the time is at hand when <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> why anyone needs one. And, yes, it probably would give us some perverse pleasure to say 'Fuck you' to this decaying business model." [...] In 2006, the New York Times described Radiohead as [...] "by far the world's most popular unsigned band".|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by {{executive}} producer Frank Spotnitz and {{was intended as a}} morality tale. Spotnitz made sure that the episode had an explicit purpose and reason, and he noted, [...] "If you're going to depart from literal reality as most of us know—if you're going to go into supernatural—as a writer <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> yourself 'Why? ... And if you don't really have a point or reason, your story's probably not going to be very good." [...] Despite largely being concerned with a [...] "Monster-of-the-Week", [...] "The Gift" [...] also fits in the series' overarching mythology. The Complete X-Files book, released in 2008, considers the episode part of the overall myth arc, however, it was not included on the 2005 DVD release The X-Files Mythology, Volume 4 – Super Soldiers.|$|E

500|$|Childress and Bowyer {{were both}} {{upset with the}} {{penalties}} and almost immediately announced plans to appeal. Bowyer argued the penalties to be too severe, saying, [...] "I don't think the penalty fits the crime. Sixty-thousandths of an inch, folks. Grab a quarter out of your pocket. Less than the thickness of that quarter right there is worth a 150-point fine?" [...] He also argued that his car could have been damaged slightly after the race as his car was pushed by a wrecker after it {{ran out of gas}} on its way to victory lane. [...] "Is it possible that a two-ton wrecker could bend the quarter-panel 60-thousandths of an inch? <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> yourself that." [...] The team lost the initial appeal, forcing them to make a final appeal to NASCAR National Commissioner John Middlebrook. As a result of the final appeal, Wilson's fine was reduced to $100,000 while he and Haney's suspensions were reduced from six to four races (they were allowed to work with the team during the appeal process); however, the points penalty administered to Bowyer and his team was upheld.|$|E
2500|$|John McCain and Ron Paul had {{a notable}} {{exchange}} over the Iraq War and the Vietnam War. McCain stated that troops wanted the US government to [...] "let them win." [...] Ron Paul replied [...] "The real question <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> is why do I {{get the most}} money from active duty officers and military personnel?" ...|$|E
2500|$|An avid yachtsman, Morgan owned {{several large}} yachts. The {{well-known}} quote, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> the price, you can't afford it" [...] is commonly attributed to Morgan {{in response to}} a question about the cost of maintaining a yacht, although the story is unconfirmed. A similarly unconfirmed legend attributes the quote to his son, J. P. Morgan Jr., in connection with the launching of the son's yacht Corsair IV at Bath Iron Works in 1930.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{know where}} Miss Gascoyne is, but you {{suggested}} that <b>you</b> <b>had</b> something <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> me, and I shall be busy by and by," [...] he said.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] {{said the}} captain, evidently relieved. [...] "I thought perhaps <b>you</b> <b>had</b> come <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> {{questions}} about some reports <b>you</b> may <b>have</b> heard {{in regard to}} me." ...|$|R
2500|$|He {{has become}} {{involved}} in advocacy relating to mental health issues. In December 2010, {{he announced that he}} would donate some or all of his salary for the 2011–12 NBA season toward mental health awareness charities. Artest also auctioned off his 2009–10 championship ring and donated the proceeds to various mental health charities nationwide. In 2016, he told Sports Illustrated, [...] "Some people don’t understand mental health is broad. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> questions. Are you depressed? Are you schizophrenic? Do you have anxiety? Are you bipolar? Those are the different things that come under the banner of mental health." ...|$|E
2500|$|After Radiohead's six-album record {{contract}} with EMI {{ended with the}} release of Hail to the Thief (2003), Yorke told Time: [...] "I like the people at our record company, but the time is at hand when <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> why anyone needs one. And, yes, it probably would give us some perverse pleasure to say 'Fuck you' to this decaying business model." [...] In 2006, he called major record labels [...] "stupid little boys' games – especially really high up." [...] In 2007, Radiohead independently released their album In Rainbows as a download for which listeners could choose their price; Yorke said the [...] "most exciting" [...] part of the release was the removal of the barrier between artist and audience.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh! <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> a favour! It {{occurred}} to me,' and the handsome face looked bitterly at him, 'that your manner was softened, Mr Clennam.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They're yours," [...] he said, and {{she knew}} he meant the men. [...] "Whatever you want done, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> only <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> them; but it wasn't because of the supper." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I pray {{you forgive}} me," [...] he said, still humbly kneeling, [...] "but <b>you</b> <b>have</b> deigned <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> my help, and I'll {{not give it}} unless you will tell me what your purpose is." ...|$|R
60|$|L. I couldn't {{think what}} you were about. I saw your French grammar lying on the grass behind you, and thought perhaps <b>you</b> <b>had</b> gone <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> the ants <b>to</b> hear you a French verb.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hush! hush!" [...] said Isabelle [...] "for {{your own}} sake--for mine--be silent {{on such a}} theme. Tell me rather what it is <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> of me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'So {{you think}} that is all <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> pardon for,' said Mr. Edmonstone. 'I advise you to study your apologies, for you are in pretty {{tolerable}} disgrace.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Then King Angus said: [...] "As to {{the matter}} of {{granting}} you a favor, that I would do in any case for the love I bear you. So let me hear {{what it is that}} <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> of me." ...|$|E
60|$|ZOO. Very well. Behave {{just as you}} feel. It doesn't {{matter how}} you behave. But keep your wits about you when the pythoness ascends, or you will forget the {{questions}} <b>you</b> <b>have</b> come <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then <b>you</b> <b>have</b> come <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> me why I {{lead this}} life," [...] said the Hermit, {{frowning}} in a stormy manner. [...] "I never {{tell that to}} any human being. I will not be asked that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ha! ha!" [...] he roared heartily, {{slapping}} {{the table with}} his open hand till the dishes rang. [...] "The girls thought yesterday <b>you</b> <b>had</b> come <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> {{for a piece of}} bread! Ha! ha! ho! ho! ho!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You have a {{free and}} manly temper, I know,' said Pinch; 'and therefore, your being so ungenerous in this one solitary instance, only grieves me the more. It's not my pardon <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask,</b> John. You have done ME nothing but kindnesses.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{what right}} can <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> me whether I have {{received}} attentions? Had {{it not been}} for the affectionate attention of my cousin, Mr. Greystock, I should have died beneath the load of sorrow you have heaped upon me!" [...] This she said quite boldly, and yet the man she named was he of whom Andy Gowran told his horrid story, and whose love-making to Lizzie had, in Mrs. Hittaway's opinion, been sufficient to atone for any falling off of strength in the matter of the diamonds.|$|E
6000|$|... "I know. You see," [...] he went on, {{a little}} wistfully, [...] "you {{have not taken}} me, as yet, very far into your confidence, Philippa. You know that I love you as a man loves only once. It sounds like an empty phrase to say it, but if you will give me your life to take care of, I shall only have one thought--to make you happy. Could I succeed? That is what <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> yourself. You are not happy now. Do you think that, if you stay on here, the future {{is likely to be}} any better for you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'If I was Mr Merdle, sir, <b>you</b> wouldn't <b>have</b> cause <b>to</b> {{complain}} of me then. No, believe me!' the Defaulter would proceed with {{a shake of}} the head. 'I'd pay up so quick then, Mr Pancks, that <b>you</b> shouldn't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> me.' ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1960, {{following}} the verdict {{in favour of}} Penguin Books and the subsequent publication of Lady Chatterley's Lover, Hornby commented, [...] "It will be stocked {{but it will not}} be on display. <b>You</b> will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> for it." ...|$|R
60|$|RIDGEON [sharply] Yes, {{of course}} I should mind very much. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> no right <b>to</b> <b>ask.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Joss it is, too, {{when the}} cruiser's 8-inch shot, {{that should have}} raked out your innards from the forward boiler to the ward-room stove, {{deflects}} miraculously, like a twig dragged through deep water, and, almost returning on its track, skips off unbursten and leaves you reprieved by the breadth of a nail from three deaths in one. Later, a single splinter, no more, may cut your oil-supply pipes as dreadfully and completely as a broken wind-screen in a collision cuts the surprised motorist's throat. Then you must lie useless, fighting oil-fires while the precious fuel gutters away till <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> leave to escape while there are yet a few tons left. One ship who was once bled white by such a piece of Joss, suggested {{it would be better}} that oil-pipes should be led along certain lines which she sketched. As if that would make any difference to Joss when he wants to show what he can do! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Upon my word, if {{you want}} my opinion, I believe she will; but <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> her first. Look here, my boy, be advised by me, and do {{it as soon as}} possible. The notion is rather new to me, I admit; but, taking her all round, where would you find a better woman? You and I don't always agree about things; we are of a {{different}} generation, and look at the world from different standpoints. But I think that at the bottom we respect each other, and I am sure," [...] he added with a touch of restrained dignity, [...] "that we are naturally and properly attached to each other. Under these circumstances, and taking everything else into consideration, I am convinced also that you will give weight to my advice. I assure you that I do not offer it lightly. It is that you should marry your cousin Mary." ...|$|E
60|$|These three {{examples}} are violently marked ones; but, in preparing {{to draw any}} object, you will find that, practically, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> yourself, Shall I aim at the color of it, the light of it, or the lines of it? You can't have all three; you can't even have any two out of the three in equal strength. The best art, indeed, comes so near nature as in a measure to unite all. But the best is not, and cannot be, as good as nature; and the mode of its deficiency is that it must lose some of the color, some of the light, {{or some of the}} delineation. And in consequence, there is one great school which says, We will have the color, and as much light and delineation as are consistent with it. Another which says, We will have shade, and as much color and delineation as are consistent with it. The third, We will have delineation, and as much color and shade as are consistent with it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't tell me," [...] she begged, [...] "that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> come <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> me any {{questions}} about that night! I simply could not bear it. The police have been here twice, and I <b>had</b> nothing <b>to</b> tell them, absolutely nothing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because {{you are a}} young man, you mean? Whom {{else can}} I trust, Harry? To whom can I go? Would <b>you</b> <b>have</b> me <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> Hugh <b>to</b> do this? Or, would Archie Clavering be a proper messenger? Whom else have I?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't be stupid, Bernard, dear, please. I didn't {{say that}} he suspected. Only people have been talking, {{and of course it}} leaves an impression.
