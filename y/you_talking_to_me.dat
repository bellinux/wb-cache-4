But I can hear them coming down from the terrace, and I must be off. I am on duty there, you know, now. Bathurst has undertaken double work in that hole. I didn't like it, really; it seemed mean to be getting out of the work and letting him do it all, but he said that he liked work, and I really think he does. I am sure he is always worrying himself because he can't take his share in the firing on the roof; and when he is working he hasn't time to think about it. When he told me that in future he would drive the tunnel our shift himself, he said, 'That will enable you to take your place on the roof, Wilson, and you must remember you are firing for both of us, so don't throw away a shot.' It is awfully rough on him, isn't it? Well, goodby, Miss Hannay," [...] and Wilson hurried off to the roof.|$|E

You have {{requested}} an attorney and I don't want <b>you</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> unless you so desire because anything you say - because - since you have requested an attorney, you know, it has to be at your own free will." [...] A conversation then followed in which the officer suggested his theory of how Bradshaw had caused Reynolds' death and then suggested that Bradshaw take a lie detector test to clear things up. Bradshaw agreed and the next day, after he was read his Miranda rights, Bradshaw took the lie detector test. At the end, the polygraph examiner informed Bradshaw that the results of the test indicated that he had not been truthful in his responses, it was at this point that Bradshaw admitted to being the driver of the truck at the time of the accident.

40|$|This practice-based project {{examines}} mediated performative relationality in videoperformance {{by means}} of five artworks and a dissertation. I argue that videoperformance {{has the potential to}} contribute to wider debates on relationality, to examine the addressee and the dynamics of relationality through the mediated encounter between performer and viewer, and to produce an account of relationality that manifests the specific ethical and political valence of this practice. I focus on videoperformances in which artists address viewers via video camera and screen, with the result of activating mediated relationality. The term relationality conveys the emergence of intersubjective relationships. Mediation refers to the relay of performativity from performer to camera, screen and viewer, and acknowledges the transformations introduced by technology. My videoperformances experiment with aspects of mediated relationality: Before You Now (2013) explores the desire for authenticity and unmediated relationality. Regardless (2007) experiments with visual strategies to suggest that the screen is permeable. The Other Person (2010) explores intimacy, trust and zones of proximity. Are <b>You</b> <b>Talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>Me?</b> (2010) denies relationality by focusing on a dialogue internal to the performer. Wish You Were Here (2011) suggests and mocks idealised conviviality, and plays with ideas of liveness. The dissertation is divided into two parts: part one contextualises the project in the framework of theoretical approaches and practices. It maps Lacanian concepts of subjectivity and the gaze; Butler’s concept of performativity; film, performance and new media studies; relational and distributed aesthetics. It also reviews the history of videoperformance from a contemporary relational perspective. Part two examines the interplay of relationality and subjectivity in three videoperformances by way of performative writing and critical analysis. This combination of different research methodologies achieves a thorough analysis of performative mediated relationality in videoperformance and contributes to a wider discourse on relationality...|$|E
