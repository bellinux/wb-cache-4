Night Shyamalan leads <b>you</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> {{fascinating}} labyrinth, an alternative universe that lurks right under our noses. In this case, it's the mythological world and, in these modern times, the secret design to that labyrinth, the key to the path, is contained in comic books." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite initial {{negative}} reactions from comics fans {{prior to the}} film's release, Keaton's portrayal of Batman was generally praised. James Berardinelli called the film entertaining, with the highlight being the production design. However, he concluded, [...] "the best thing {{that can be said}} about Batman is that it led to Batman Returns, which was a far superior effort." [...] Variety felt [...] "Jack Nicholson stole every scene" [...] but still greeted the film with positive feedback. Roger Ebert was highly impressed with the production design, but claimed [...] "Batman is a triumph of design over story, style over substance, a great-looking movie with a plot you can't care much about." [...] He also called the film [...] "a depressing experience". His reviewing partner Gene Siskel disagreed, describing the film as having a 'refreshingly adult' approach with performances, direction and set design that 'draws <b>you</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> psychological world'.|$|E
500|$|Although {{generally}} {{respected by}} London society, the longer Lambert remained there, the more irritable he became. Shy and self-conscious, he was annoyed at repeatedly being {{asked about the}} size of his clothes. [...] In answer to one request, to a woman who enquired as to the cost of his coat, he replied [...] "I cannot pretend to charge my memory with the price, but I can put <b>you</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> method of obtaining the information you want. If you think proper to make me a present of a new coat, you will then know exactly what it costs". [...] Another interested spectator claimed that since his entrance fee was paying for Lambert's clothing, he had the right to know about it; Lambert replied [...] "Sir, if I knew what part of my next coat your shilling would pay for, I can assure you I would cut out the piece". Lambert calculated in 1806 that a full suit of clothes cost him £20, about £ as of [...]|$|E

500|$|HIStory {{received}} generally positive reviews. Arguably Jackson's most angry, raw, emotional album, the new {{tracks on}} HIStory revealed a musician worn and torn {{by years of}} superstardom, now reportedly reacting against people who tried to bring him down. This reaction is what some people say ultimately stunted his previous skill at creating cutting edge musical trends, with Jon Pareles of The New York Times writing that [...] "It {{has been a long}} time since Michael Jackson was simply a performer. He's the main asset of his own corporation, which is a profitable subsidiary of Sony". Some reviewers commented on the unusual format of a new studio album being accompanied by a [...] "greatest hits" [...] collection, with Q magazine saying [...] "from the new songs' point of view, it's like taking your dad with <b>you</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> fight." [...] Fred Shuster of the Daily News of Los Angeles described [...] "This Time Around", [...] "Money" [...] and [...] "D.S." [...] as [...] "superb slices of organic funk that will fuel many of the summer's busiest dance floors".|$|E
500|$|In 2006, Constantine and Woodall {{moved from}} the BBC to ITV in a deal reputedly worth £1.2 million {{to start a new}} show, Trinny & Susannah Undress..., on 3 October. The second series of Trinny & Susannah Undress... was {{transmitted}} in June 2007, and it maintained the format of series one which saw Constantine and Woodall advising couples who were finding problems within their marriage. [...] Constantine found it warming that people could open up to them as confidantes, and also said [...] "It's been fascinating to see how looking good and having faith in your appearance makes <b>you</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> sexier person, which makes you attractive to your partner again." [...] Constantine stated in an interview that filming the show was very emotionally draining, and as a result, she often went home crying. The programme did not come without its critics who questioned the depth at which Constantine and Woodall could deal with serious issues raised during the programme. On 16 October 2006, they both appeared on NBC's The Today Show and performed makeovers on three women especially for the show.|$|E
500|$|Alex Timbers {{developed}} {{the concept and}} directed the play, while Kyle Jarrow wrote the accompanying book, music, and lyrics. [...] Timbers and Jarrow were classmates together at Yale University. [...] The script for the play is published by Samuel French, Inc. [...] Jarrow was motivated to write the script {{by what he saw}} as a shift in religious teachings – from an old model involving hell and retribution, to a new system of thought promising money or peace. [...] Jarrow commented on Timbers' idea of using children to tell a story about Scientology: [...] "I did a lot of work on cults in college, and what I learned is that they sort of turn <b>you</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> child by appealing to that part of you that wants {{to be taken care of}} and given answers. [...] And so it all began to make sense to me." [...] He said Scientology would be [...] "an especially interesting topic for a theater piece" [...] because of its criticism of psychiatry, relative newness compared to Buddhism, Islam, Judaism, and Christianity, and practice of requiring [...] "that the follower take courses which cost significant amounts of money." ...|$|E

500|$|One of {{the most}} notable story lines for Martha was her secret life as a pole dancer and {{subsequent}} road into alcoholism. This {{was a result of}} her abortion and failed relationships with Jack and Ash Nader (Ben Geurens) along with her new relationship with Cameron [...] "Cam" [...] Reynolds (Ashley Lyons), who was leading her astray. The story line began playing out from the 2006 [...] "cliffhanger" [...] episode, when Ash reveals that he is married with children and leading a double life. Gordon branded Martha as ignorant to the situation she has got herself into: [...] "I think she is so naive, she wants to believe that she's found a great guy and she keeps giving him second chances. She wants to make it work." [...] Martha fails to cope with the situation, as Gordon describes: [...] "It's this whole emotional roller-coaster that, if you don't deal with your life, can be terrible." [...] Their relationship falls apart after Martha aborts Ash's child, causing Martha to begin her transition into a party girl. Gordon commented that [...] "I think everyone in this show begins as a scruffy bum and gradually they turn <b>you</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> glamour puss." ...|$|E
500|$|Yahoo!'s Kathleen Perricone gave [...] "Scream & Shout" [...] a mixed review, {{and said}} it was [...] "not exactly worthy of all the hype", and Alicia Lutes of Hollywood.com criticized its lyrical meaning and {{repetitive}} production.

[...] The Huffington Post journalist Kia Makarechi called the song a [...] "competent piece of airy dance pop", and wrote that the only mildly inspiring moment on [...] "Scream & Shout" [...] is the sample from [...] "Gimme More". An editorial writer from Popjustice was negative towards [...] "Scream & Shout" [...] and Pitbull's song [...] "Feel This Moment" [...] (2012), stating that what the [...] "two songs represent is pop music writhing around in its own shit." [...] Kurt Schlosser of NBCNews.com also criticized the song's lyrical content, and wrote that it [...] "plays like a forgotten sample from a Black Eyed Peas song, with Britney doing the Fergie talkie parts..."

500|$|In September 1994, Looking Glass Technologies {{employee}} Seamus Blackley told Computer Gaming World that {{he wanted}} to create a combat-based sequel to Flight Unlimited, whose development he was directing at the time. The magazine's Johnny L. Wilson wrote, [...] "If Flight Unlimited can pass the civilian tests, the military version should be right behind it." [...] In March of the next year, Blackley told PC Gamer US that the sequel [...] "should feel so real that pilots will be afraid. They'll feel the gun hits." [...] He dismissed the flight dynamics in other flight simulators, such as Falcon 3.0, in favor of the real-time computational fluid dynamics (CFDs) model he created for Flight Unlimited. When PC Gamers Bernie Yee asked why the team had waited to make a combat flight simulator, Blackley responded that they wanted to [...] "retrain" [...] players first. In September, Computer Gaming World reported that Blackley was designing a combat-based sequel to Flight Unlimited under the working title Flight Combat. Blackley told them that it would [...] "make <b>you</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> fighter pilot", and the magazine commented that it would teach the same material as the Air Force. The team planned to allow players to practice an element and then execute it on a mission, and Blackley said that the game would feature competitive online play. However, a new manager at Looking Glass Technologies, instated by venture capital investors, demanded that Blackley work on Flight Unlimited II instead of Flight Combat. Blackley refused and was fired, leaving the company in late 1995.|$|E

500|$|Elgar was knighted at Buckingham Palace on 5 July 1904. The {{following}} month, he and {{his family}} moved to Plâs Gwyn, a large house on the outskirts of Hereford, overlooking the River Wye, where they lived until 1911. Between 1902 and 1914, Elgar was, in Kennedy's words, at the zenith of popularity. He made four visits to the US, including one conducting tour, and earned considerable fees from the performance of his music. Between 1905 and 1908, he held the post of Peyton Professor of Music at the University of Birmingham. He had accepted the post reluctantly, feeling that a composer should not head a school of music. He was not at ease in the role, and his lectures caused controversy, with his attacks on the critics and on English music in general: [...] "Vulgarity in the course of time may be refined. Vulgarity often goes with inventiveness ... but the commonplace mind can never be anything but commonplace. An Englishman will take <b>you</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> large room, beautifully proportioned, and will point out to you that it is white – all over white – and somebody will say, 'What exquisite taste'. You know in your own mind, in your own soul, that it is not taste at all, that it is the want of taste, that is mere evasion. English music is white, and evades everything." [...] He regretted the controversy and was glad to hand on the post to his friend Granville Bantock in 1908. His new life as a celebrity was a mixed blessing to the highly strung Elgar, as it interrupted his privacy, and he often was in ill-health. He complained to Jaeger in 1903, [...] "My life is one continual giving up of little things which I love." [...] Both W. S. Gilbert and Thomas Hardy sought to collaborate with Elgar in this decade. Elgar refused, but would have collaborated with George Bernard Shaw had Shaw been willing.|$|E
500|$|Overall, {{reviews of}} the film were highly positive. Entertainment Weekly critic Owen Gleiberman awarded the film an [...] "A" [...] grade, hailing the film as a [...] "procedural thriller for the {{information}} age" [...] that [...] "spins your head in a new way, luring <b>you</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> vortex and then deeper still." [...] Nathan Lee in his review for The Village Voice wrote that director Fincher's [...] "very lack of pretense, coupled with a determination to get the facts down with maximum economy and objectivity, gives Zodiac its hard, bright integrity. As a crime saga, newspaper drama, and period piece, it works just fine. As an allegory {{of life in the}} information age, it blew my mind." [...] Todd McCarthy's review in Variety praised the film's [...] "almost unerringly accurate evocation of the workaday San Francisco of 35–40 years ago. Forget the distorted emphasis on hippies and flower-power that many such films indulge in; this is the city as it was experienced by most people who lived and worked there." [...] David Ansen, in his review for Newsweek magazine, wrote, [...] "Zodiac is meticulously crafted – Harris Savides's state-of-the-art digital cinematography has a richness indistinguishable from film – and it runs almost two hours and 40 minutes. Still, the movie holds you in its grip from start to finish. Fincher boldly (and some may think perversely) withholds the emotional and forensic payoff we're conditioned to expect from a big studio movie." [...] Roger Ebert gave the film 4 stars out of a possible 4, writing: [...] "The film is a police procedural crossed with a newspaper movie, but free of most of the cliches of either. Its most impressive accomplishment is to gather a bewildering labyrinth of facts and suspicions over a period of years, and make the journey through this maze frightening and suspenseful." [...] Ebert also praised the casting (critical in an ensemble film) and, as a longtime columnist for The Chicago Sun-Times, asserted Zodiac was [...] "intriguing in its accuracy" [...] in showing the operation of a major newspaper.|$|E
2500|$|The show {{aired on}} Canadian airwaves {{for the first}} time on September 2, 1997 to CHOM in Montreal and CILQ in Toronto. Stern's {{comments}} about French people and their language caused a rift with some listeners. [...] "There is something about the language that turns <b>you</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> pussy-assed jack off. Anybody who speaks French is a scum bag. It turns <b>you</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> coward. Just like in World War II, they would not stick up for us. Screw your culture and we're invading you all." [...] Ratings for the two stations increased nonetheless by 62% and 47% respectively. Following listener complaints and censorship enforced by the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council and the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission, the show was cancelled in Montreal in 1998 and in Toronto in 2001.|$|E

The duo became instantly renowned for their poking and prodding of the contestants, their straight-talking advice, and frequently referring to breasts as tits. The editor of ELLE, Sarah Bailey, has stated [...] "You just don't expect posh girls to grab your tits, call your trousers 'too clitty' and use words like 'pussy pelmet' but they do. You are so shocked by {{what they are saying}} that by the time you have recovered and thought of something to say they have whipped you out of your jeans and eased <b>you</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> Lycra cat suit." [...] They have stated that their relationship is more like a marriage and that being total opposites, they balance each other out. They cannot imagine working without each other and have even considered taking insurance out on their television partnership should something unforeseen happen. Woodall and Constantine have been accused of being patronising, but reject these claims.|$|E
