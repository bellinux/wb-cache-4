2500|$|In December 2016, in the Rolling Stone video series 'Her Sound, Her Story: Tina Arena', she {{discusses}} how {{the music}} industry squanders women as both they and their careers mature. [...] "Youâ€™ve got {{to give me a}} really damn good reason why somebody, who is in the prime of their career and are doing really good work, why on earth they should stop? Are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> a male who {{is at the top of}} his game in whatever domain, that he needs to step down and retire?". Speaking to series creators Michelle Grace Hunder and Claudia Sangiorgi Dalimore, Arena goes on to talk about the importance of female solidarity, mentioning how competition between women can be (and has been) dismantled by supportive relationships and encouragement of other women. Arena says [...] "Get out of the ring. Take your boxing gloves off. Be convinced in the argument of your thoughts and your dreams".|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{say your}} comrades {{know nothing of}} your family history?" [...] she had said {{to him on the}} journey thither. [...] "What are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> them?" ...|$|E
60|$|CUTHBERTSON (to {{help them}} out). <b>You</b> were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> about Grace, Charteris.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; the knights, you know: <b>You</b> were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> {{me about}} them. A while back, you remember. Figuratively speaking, game's called." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Don't say you will, my good fellow,' {{returned}} his father, crossing his legs, 'or you certainly will not. <b>You</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me'-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I s'pose I can't get {{clear of}} it then," [...] said Davy with a sigh. [...] "Are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> Marilla and Mrs. Lynde on me, Anne?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And, afther all, are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me now, that I may jist go my own way? Is {{that to be}} your answer, and all I'm to {{get from}} you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What were <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me?" [...] said I, smiling, for I saw {{she wanted}} to go on. [...] "You have roused my curiosity, and now you must gratify it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Grandfather," [...] {{said little}} Alice, looking fearfully into his face, [...] "your voice {{sounds as though}} <b>you</b> were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> us {{something}} awful!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't look so ashamed," [...] he said, smiling faintly. [...] "I'm {{not afraid}} of him. What is it <b>you</b> were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me about him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No you won't. That drink was {{for you if}} {{you went}} ashore. If <b>you</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me the island, you must do it in your sober senses." ...|$|R
6000|$|ERNEST. Gilbert, you bewilder me. You {{have told}} me that all art is, in its essence, immoral. Are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me now that all thought is, in its essence, dangerous? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me, Paul, about the--the--subject we {{were talking}} of on our way here?" [...] asked Fred, who was still devoting much of his {{attention}} to a deer's rib.|$|E
6000|$|MRS. BRENNAN. Don't be goin' {{out there}} till I tell you, you imp! I must speak {{to your father}} first. (Coming closer to him and {{lowering}} her voice.) Are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> her about it? ...|$|E
60|$|ANNA--[With a laugh.] There you go kiddin' again. [Then {{seeing his}} hurt expression--quickly.] But <b>you</b> was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me about yourself. You're Irish, of course I can tell that.|$|R
6000|$|... "Pooh! I knew that," [...] {{retorted}} Jenny Wren. [...] "What do {{you suppose}} my eyes are make for? I thought <b>you</b> were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me something I didn't know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{be angry}} with me, ma'am," [...] he said; [...] "I must remind you that <b>you</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me your secrets, without any wish to intrude on them on my part--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, I {{wear one}} too,' said the captain, {{pointing}} to the pin in his necktie. 'Are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me that I am a traitor to the flag, sir? I warn you Professor, to be careful.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I thought so. There was a {{dishonesty}} {{about your}} dear eyes {{which has never}} been there before, and love-making and dishonesty are inseparable as coupled hounds. Up comes man, and away goes innocence. Are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me anything about him?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you were}} to know me you would feel none of this," [...] she said. [...] "We don't know each other--we've always been--interrupted.... Were <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me this that day my aunts came?" [...] she asked, recollecting the whole scene.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, he wouldn't. Nobody would {{suppose that}} anybody would pick {{me out for}} this kind of thing. If I'd known that <b>you</b> were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me such a story as this I wouldn't have come with you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know," [...] {{interrupted}} Old Man Coyote. [...] "It {{was handed}} down from your greatest-great-grandfather, {{who lived in the}} days when the world was young and what <b>you</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me about happened. Isn't that it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is of no}} use my {{thinking}} about it, Mary," [...] Mr. Armstrong said, resignedly, [...] "especially as I suppose <b>you</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me. I have made one suggestion, {{and it seems that}} it is incorrect." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The old gentleman did not reply, but began {{switching}} at some invisible dandelions. 'What {{you tell}} me,' he said presently, 'reminds {{me of my}} Aunt Amanda. She was a fine woman, and she had two lovers.' ('You little round-faced scamp!' thought Miss Amanda. 'Are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> that child all my love-affairs? And {{what do you know}} about them, anyway? I never confided in you. You were nothing but a boy, although you were a very inquisitive one, always wanting to know things, and what you have found out is beyond me to imagine.') ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Maraton," [...] he said, [...] "now I {{am going}} to ask you this question. To-morrow you go to Manchester to {{pronounce}} your doctrines. To-morrow you are going to incite the working people of England practically to revolt. Are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> them that it is for posterity they must strike? Do you mean, when you thunder at them from the platforms, to tell them the truth?--to tell them that the good which you promise is not for them nor for their children, nor their children's children, but for the unborn generations? Do you mean to tell them this?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Prendergast {{had made}} up his mind that nothing could be gained by soft usage with Mr. Mollett. Indeed nothing could be gained in any way, by any usage, unless it could be shown that Mollett and Talbot were not the same person. He could afford {{therefore}} to tell the scoundrel that he was a scoundrel, and to declare against him--war to the knife. The more that Mollett trembled, the more abject he became, the easier would be the task Mr. Prendergast now had in hand. [...] "Well, sir," [...] he continued, [...] "are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me what business has brought you here to-day?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She merely smiled, {{and went}} on: 'And I {{should not have}} told you of my {{engagement}} if I had not {{thought it would be}} safer to do so, considering the story <b>you</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> your husband.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I mean <b>you</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> {{the truth}} as you have just told it," [...] replied Fisher. [...] "You are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> placard this town with the wickedness done to old Wilkins. <b>You</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> fill the {{newspapers}} with the infamous story of Mrs. Biddle. <b>You</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> denounce Verner from a public platform, naming {{him for what he}} did and naming the poacher he did it <b>to.</b> And you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> find out by what trade this man made the money with which he bought the estate; and when you know the truth, as I said before, of course <b>you</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> it. Upon those terms I come under the old flag, as you call it, and haul down my little pennon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Now, Jane, {{you should}} not be so cross,' cried Clara, 'when it is your own Jemmy, come on purpose to help and comfort us all! <b>You</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> Uncle Oliver, and make him glad to see him, as you know you are.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{is a very}} {{interesting}} little incident, Fan," [...] said Katie with delight when they were alone; [...] "quite a romancelet of real life. Let me see; here is a poor boy--the boy who deceived us, you remember--whom bad companions are trying to decoy into the wicked meshes of their dreadful net, and a sweet young girl, a sort of guardian angel as it were, comes to me and asks my aid to save the boy, and have him sent to sea. Isn't it delightful? Quite the ground-work of a tale--and might be so nicely illustrated," [...] added Katie, glancing at her drawings. [...] "But forgive me, Fan; I interrupted you. What were <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do as you're bid, will you, {{and give}} me the whisky. Are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me when I'm to eat and when I'm to drink, like a child?" [...] This he said in that tone of voice which made Mrs. Moulder know that he meant to be obeyed; and though she was sure {{that he would make}} himself drunk, she was {{compelled}} to minister to his desires. She got the whisky and hot water, the lemon and sugar, and set the things beside him; and then she retired to the sofa. John Kenneby the while sat perfectly silent looking on. Perhaps he was considering whether {{he would be able to}} emulate the domestic management of Dockwrath or of Moulder when he should have taken to himself Mrs. Smiley and the Kingsland brick-field.|$|E
6000|$|... "Our liturgy," [...] {{observed}} Crawford, [...] "has beauties, {{which not}} even a careless, slovenly style of reading can destroy; {{but it has also}} redundancies and repetitions which require good reading not to be felt. For myself, at least, I must confess being not always so attentive as I ought to be" [...] (here was a glance at Fanny); [...] "that nineteen times out of twenty I am thinking how such a prayer ought to be read, and longing to have it to read myself. Did you speak?" [...] stepping eagerly to Fanny, and addressing her in a softened voice; and upon her saying [...] "No," [...] he added, [...] "Are you sure you did not speak? I saw your lips move. I fancied you might be going to tell me I ought to be more attentive, and not allow my thoughts to wander. Are not <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me so?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You have! I tell you, Sigsbee, you've {{solved the}} whole thing. Archie's such a bully good fellow, {{why not give}} him a benefit? Why not let him win this championship? <b>You</b> aren't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me that <b>you</b> care whether you win a tin medal or not?' ...|$|R
60|$|I thought no {{one knew}} but me till this morning, {{when you were talking}} to Arthur. Then I thought you must know too. My heart was in my mouth, I was afraid <b>you</b> were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> him. But <b>you</b> didn't, and I thought I'd been mistaken.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] exclaimed Phonny, [...] "now I know <b>you</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> some {{story about}} me and Beechnut." [...] Here Phonny {{threw back his head}} and laughed aloud. He {{repeated}} the words Johnny and Hazelnut, and then laughed again, until he made the woods ring with his merriment.|$|R
