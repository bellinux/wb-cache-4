[...] "I was singing the line, 'Don't let the bastards drag you down,' feeling determined rather than angry. Before we started, Rab [...] said, 'What are <b>you</b> <b>thinking</b> about this U2 cover?' I said, 'Ach, it'll be easy: just make it sound bigger than U2'." ...|$|E
500|$|Brian Crecente, {{editor-in-chief}} of Kotaku, praised the general use of {{light as a}} gameplay-mechanic. He commented on the episodic structure, saying it made the player feel satisfied even after short gameplay sessions. He also praised the overall storyline, having played the final episode thrice in a row, saying: [...] "For {{the first time in}} my life, I have experienced something that plays like a game but has the impact of a movie... Alan Wake is a powerful ride, an experience bound to leave <b>you</b> <b>thinking</b> about it and wanting more for days after its completion." [...] He criticised the game for not providing enough information about Wake and his wife, despite being [...] "packed with memorable people", but concluded that the game [...] "redefines interactive storytelling".|$|E
500|$|The lyrics feature LaBelle {{offering}} {{advice on}} how to keep a man's attention and sexual interest. LaBelle described the single as an [...] "anthem for women", in which she defined the term [...] "sexify" [...] as a way for women to [...] "make [...] feel comfortable and confident and happy and proud" [...] or help their men feel the same way. The chorus is accompanied by a [...] "summery two-step tune", and includes lyrics such as [...] "I gotta whole bunch of ways" [...] and [...] "He'll come home girl / If you know what I mean." [...] LaBelle continues to instruct women by singing: [...] "I'll sexify you / Have <b>you</b> <b>thinking</b> about my name {{in the middle of the}} day." ...|$|E

500|$|Rooksby {{called the}} song as [...] "the other gem" [...] of the Who's That Girl soundtrack along with [...] "Causing a Commotion," [...] and denoted it as [...] "an expressive, {{understated}} track." [...] J. Randy Taraborrelli, author of Madonna: An Intimate Biography, commented that [...] "'The Look of Love' was an exotic ballad." [...] Don Shewey from Rolling Stone {{said that the}} song was [...] "so haunting that it would leave <b>you</b> <b>thinking</b> as to where your life is going." [...] John Evan Seery, author of Political theory for mortals: shades of justice, images of death, commented that the song portrayed Madonna's [...] "discipline of gaze". Brian Hadden from Time found the song depressing. Tiju Francis from Vibe wrote: [...] "For a such a commonly titled song, Madonna’s take does at least offer something a little different. [...] 'The Look of Love' actually sounds like part of the score– Madonna could well be singing over what was previously just the moody character development background synth music apparently present in every film in the ’80s. [...] But its slow-burn feel means the song is four minutes of not-particularly-intense brooding that never peaks– unlike a ballad." ...|$|E
2500|$|A Popular Science {{comparison}} of four new compact sedans concluded that AMC's aim [...] "hit the mark" [...] at car buyers switching to smaller cars.

[...] High-quality materials and attractive dash design [...] "would have <b>you</b> <b>thinking</b> this was an expensive car were it for one thing: poor quality control." [...] Compared to the Ford Fairmont, Plymouth Volaré, and Pontiac Phoenix, the 1978 compact cars offer more variety and [...] "especially the Concord, are more refined than ever and make lots of sense as family cars." ...|$|E
2500|$|Under Howard's {{leadership}} in the 2005 general election, the Conservative Party increased their total vote share by around 0.7% (up to 32.4%) and–more significantly–their number of parliamentary seats by 33 (up to 198 seats). This gain accompanied a large decline in the Labour vote, and the election reduced Labour's majority from 167 to 68 and {{its share of the}} vote to 35.2%. The campaign, based on the slogan [...] "Are <b>you</b> <b>thinking</b> what we're thinking?", was designed by Australian pollster Lynton Crosby. The day following the election, on 6 May, Howard announced that he did not feel it was right to continue as leader after defeat in the general election, also saying that he would be too old to lead the party into another campaign and would therefore step down after allowing time for the party to amend its leadership election rules.|$|E

[...] Unlike many children of her age, the young Lady Zhen did not enjoy playing. Once, when she was eight years old, her sisters went to the balcony to watch a group of horse-riding performers outside their house but Lady Zhen did not join in. Her sisters were puzzled so they asked her, and she responded, [...] "Is this something a girl should watch?" [...] When she was nine years old, she became interested in scholarly arts and started reading books and using her brothers' writing materials. Her brothers told her, [...] "You should be learning what women traditionally do (such as weaving). When you picked up reading, were <b>you</b> <b>thinking</b> of becoming a female academician?" [...] Lady Zhen replied, [...] "I heard that virtuous women in history learnt from the successes and failures of those who lived before them. If they didn't read, how did they learn all that?" ...|$|E
2500|$|David Lim, a music {{journalist}} and announcer on radio station Joy 94.9, {{wrote in an}} article about the best albums of 2012, [...] "When it comes to the quality of songwriting and vocal performance, this is hands down the best Guy Sebastian album yet. [...] Armageddon feels like a mature, universal pop album that would appeal to young and old, broken and fulfilled alike." [...] In earlier reviews for the singles he said [...] "Don't Worry Be Happy" [...] was [...] "feel good, sun-soaked and universally appealing", and described Battle Scars as a [...] "massive bruised ballad with a titan hook that just beats you down with no mercy." [...] Lim wrote of [...] "Get Along", [...] "The emotive political ballad 'Get Along' is possibly the best single Sebastian has ever released. I just can't get over how great his observant lyrics about religious wars are. The hook - 'Dear God, dear soul, dear Mary, Mohammed... can we all just get along?' - absolutely rips right through the heart. Music site auspOp gave positive reviews for all the released singles. They said [...] "Don't Worry Be Happy" [...] was [...] "bright as sunshine" [...] and of [...] "Gold" [...] they wrote, [...] "This new tune is precisely what Guy does best - oozing with class and old school soul. 'Gold' sounds like it could have been ripped straight from the streets of 1960s Detroit, what with its flashy brass, gorgeous gospel chorus and Guy's insane pitch-perfect vocal. They named [...] "Battle Scars" [...] {{as one of the best}} singles of the year, with [...] "stunning, crystal-clear, pitch-perfect vocals" [...] calling it [...] "superb home-grown pop". In a review for [...] "Get Along" [...] they wrote, [...] "This one is designed to get <b>you</b> <b>thinking.</b> To tap into your emotions. 'Get Along' is a song about hope, peace and understanding and a dream that perhaps one day we'll all be united, together as one people, one world, despite our differences in opinion, religion, creed and race.
