5|$|In a {{manuscript}} {{he wrote in}} 1704 (never intended to be published) he mentions the date of 2060, {{but it is not}} given as a date for the end of days. It has been falsely reported as a prediction. The passage is clear, when <b>you</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> date in context. He was against date setting for the end of days, concerned that this would put Christianity into disrepute.|$|E
5|$|If <b>you</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> {{records of}} the Royal Society {{and what they were}} doing in the 1660s, it's clear that at a certain point, some of these people– and I think Hooke was one of them– became a little bit disgusted with {{themselves}} and began excusing themselves when one of these vivisections was going to happen. I certainly don't think they turned into hardcore animal rights campaigners, or anything close to that, but I think after a while, they got a little bit sick of it and started to feel conflicted about what they were doing. So I've tried to show that ambivalence and complication in the book.|$|E

500|$|For the exteriors of {{the capital}} city of King's Landing, that had been doubled for Malta for the entire season 1, now the {{production}} flew to the Croatian city of Dubrovnik. Known as The Pearl of the Adriatic, the city proved to be a good representation of King's Landing since it shared many characteristics with the fictional capital: it had a well-preserved medieval look, with high walls and the sea at its side. According to David Benioff, executive producer of the show, [...] "The minute we started walking around the city walls we knew that was it. <b>You</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> descriptions in the book and you come to Dubrovnik and that's what the actual city is.

500|$|The {{book was}} made into the well-received 1962 film with the same title, {{starring}} Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch. The film's producer, Alan J.

I said, 'Have <b>you</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> book?' They said, 'Yes.' I said, 'That's the story.'" [...] The movie was a hit at the box office, quickly grossing more than $20 million from a $2-million budget. It won three Oscars: Best Actor for Gregory Peck, Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Black-and-White, and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium for Horton Foote. It was nominated for five more Oscars including Best Actress in a Supporting Role for Mary Badham, the actress who played Scout.|$|E

He continued, [...] "Whenever I came back, I was excited to come back, and the scenes all seemed pretty amazing. I was so happy to re-embrace the character." [...] According to Parkinson, he was sorry that Rickon would die but his manner of death was a compensation: [...] "It was a cool death, and it was {{always going to be a}} good death, so at the same time, I was pretty happy." ...|$|E

500|$|On {{the other}} hand, giving the episode a {{negative}} review, DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson wrote that [...] "Simpsons Bible Stories" [...] "proves less successful [...] ". He {{added that he}} [...] "just think the brevity required by the inclusion of three separate tales better suits the world of horror spoofs than it does these Bible pieces," [...] as they [...] "try to pack an awful lot into very little time." [...] He concluded by writing that, while the episode has [...] "some good moments", he did not {{find a lot of}} entertainment in it. Jake MacNeill of Digital Entertainment News was also critical, and wrote that the episode [...] "fails to be funny" [...] because it [...] "strays too far from the source material". He added [...] "have <b>you</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> bible? That stuff’s funny enough in and of itself." [...] Aaron Roxby of Collider described [...] "Simpsons Bible Stories" [...] as his least-favorite trilogy episode, and wrote [...] "Considering that, in earlier seasons, the show had some of the most thoughtfully edgy religious humor on television, this one feels surprisingly toothless." [...] However, he gave praise to the talking pig in the Garden of Eden.|$|E
500|$|Reyes {{said that}} the album was written solely for [...] "fun {{and the love of}} music, no expectations." [...] Their lyrics were {{inspired}} by personal experience. Nolan and Lazzara had a concept where some of the lyrics could be read [...] "like a play where one line is the boy and the next line is the girl ... Sometimes when <b>you</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> lyrics it's a little boring and it's more interesting this way". About half their song titles, according to Nolan, came from [...] "sitting around late at night watching TV". The title of [...] "Cute Without the 'E' (Cut from the Team)" [...] came when a friend of the band said that someone he knew was [...] "cut from the team". [...] "Great Romances of the 20th Century" [...] includes an audio sample from the film, Beautiful Girls (1996). Lazzara said [...] "The Blue Channel" [...] and [...] "Head Club" [...] were songs that the band used [...] "to get enough songs to fill a record so we could go on tour". The album's sound would later be described as emo. Around this time, Taking Back Sunday was influenced by emo bands the Get Up Kids and the Promise Ring.|$|E

[...] These comments were made before the doosra controversy, in spite of Muralitharan's action having been cleared by ICC in both 1996 and 1999. For his comment Gilchrist was reprimanded by the Australian Cricket Board (ACB) and found guilty of being in breach of ACB rules concerned with [...] "detrimental public comment".|$|E

2500|$|Shortly {{before his}} death in 1980, Lennon commented that [...] "Although the lyrics don't resolve into any sense, they're good lines.

[...] Lennon made reference to [...] "Yesterday" [...] in his song [...] "How Do You Sleep?" [...] on his 1971 album Imagine. The song appears to attack McCartney with the line [...] "The only thing you done was yesterday, but since you've gone you're just another day", a reference to McCartney's recent hit [...] "Another Day".

2500|$|The word robotics, used to {{describe}} this field of study, was coined by the science fiction writer Isaac Asimov.

(The three laws are pure fiction, and no technology yet created {{has the ability to}} understand or follow them, and in fact most robots serve military purposes, which run quite contrary to the first law and often the third law. [...] "People think about Asimov's laws, but they were set up to point out how a simple ethical system doesn't work. If <b>you</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> short stories, every single one is about a failure, and they are totally impractical," [...] said Dr. Joanna Bryson of the University of Bath.) ...|$|E

2500|$|On the Road {{has been}} the object of {{critical}} study since its publication. [...] David Brooks of The New York Times compiled several opinions and summarized them in an Op-Ed from October 2, 2007. Whereas Millstein {{saw it as a}} story in which the heroes took pleasure in everything, George Mouratidis, an editor of a new edition, claimed [...] "above all else, the story is about loss." [...] "It's a book about death and the search for something meaningful to hold on to—the famous search for 'IT,' a truth larger than the self, which, of course, is never found," [...] wrote Meghan O'Rourke in Slate. [...] "Kerouac was this deep, lonely, melancholy man," [...] Hilary Holladay of the University of Massachusetts Lowell told The Philadelphia Inquirer. [...] "And if <b>you</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> book closely, you see that sense of loss and sorrow swelling on every page." [...] "In truth, 'On the Road' is a book of broken dreams and failed plans," [...] wrote Ted Gioia in The Weekly Standard.|$|E
2500|$|On February 8, {{during his}} Grammy Awards red carpet interview, West {{explained}} how the collaboration came to fruition: [...] "I'm {{executive producer of}} Rihanna's album, and I said I'd done a few songs with Paul McCartney and she couldn't get past this record. She had to have it on her album... So now we at the Grammys doing it". West further compared Rihanna's vocals on the song to that of Scottish singer Annie Lennox: [...] "I feel like she has this type of energy in her vocals. And she even brought it to another level of like soul and heart and artistry". In an interview with V magazine, Rihanna revealed, [...] "The thing that made me {{fall in love with}} [...] is the juxtaposition of the music and the lyrics. When <b>you</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> lyrics it's a completely different song than what you are hearing. The music is easygoing, but the lyrical content is very loud and in your face." [...] Although it is a first collaboration by the trio, they have collaborated separately. West and McCartney collaborated on the 2014 single [...] "Only One", a track dedicated to West's daughter North. Rihanna and West previously collaborated on Jay-Z's 2009 single [...] "Run This Town" [...] — which became a commercial success and peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 chart — and West's 2011 single [...] "All of the Lights", a track featuring backup vocals by John Legend, Fergie, and Elton John among others.|$|E
2500|$|Robert Downey Jr. as Sherlock Holmes, a bohemian {{scientist}} and eccentric detective-for-hire {{who becomes a}} wanted fugitive in his hunt for Lord Blackwood while constantly being followed {{by the presence of}} Professor Moriarty. Downey was visiting Joel Silver's offices with his wife, producer Susan Downey, when he learned about the project. Ritchie initially felt Downey was too old for the role because he wanted the film to show a younger Holmes on a learning curve like Batman Begins. Ritchie decided {{to take a chance on}} casting him in the role, and Downey told the BBC that [...] "I think me and Guy are well-suited to working together. The more I look into the books, the more fantastic it becomes. Holmes is such a weirdo". Downey also revealed what his wife had to say: [...] "that when <b>you</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> description of the guy — quirky and kind of nuts— it could be a description of me". Downey intended to focus more on Holmes' patriotic side and his bohemianism, and felt that his work on Chaplin had prepared him for an English accent. Ritchie feels his accent is [...] "flawless". Both Downey and Ritchie are martial arts enthusiasts, and have been inspired by the Baritsu mentioned in the 1901 story [...] "The Adventure of the Empty House". Downey lost weight for the part, because during a chat he had with Chris Martin, Martin recommended that Holmes look [...] "gaunt" [...] and [...] "skinny".|$|E
