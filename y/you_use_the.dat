500|$|In August 2013, after Joss Whedon, {{director}} of , announced that Hank Pym {{would not be}} Ultron's creator, Wright said Ultron was never {{a part of the}} story of Ant-Man, explaining that [...] "just to sort of set up what Ant-Man does is enough for one movie". Wright described Ant-Man as a stand-alone film but said it would fit into to the larger continuity of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, explaining, [...] "I like to make it standalone because I think the premise of it needs time. I want to put the crazy premise of it into a real world, which is why I think Iron Man really works because it's a relatively simple universe; it's relatable. I definitely want to go into finding a streamlined format where <b>you</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> origin format to introduce the main character and further adventures can bring other people into it." [...] Wright also stated that pre-production for Ant-Man would begin in October and filming would begin in 2014. The next month, Disney moved the film's release date up to July 31, 2015.|$|E
500|$|Nixon {{stated that}} no {{contributor}} to the fund got any service that an ordinary constituent would not have received, and then anticipated the skeptical questions, [...] "Well, what did <b>you</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> fund for, Senator? Why {{did you have to}} have it?" [...] In response to his rhetorical question, he explained salary and office allowances for senators. He went through different ways that political expenses could be met. One way was to be rich, but the senator stated that he was not rich. Another way was to put one's spouse on the Congressional office payroll, as, he stated, his Democratic rival, Senator John Sparkman, had done. Nixon did not feel comfortable doing that himself with so many deserving stenographers in Washington needing work, though Pat Nixon was a [...] "wonderful stenographer" [...] and sometimes helped out in the office as a volunteer. At this point, the camera turned from Nixon {{for the first time to}} reveal Pat Nixon sitting alongside the desk. The senator indicated he could not continue his law practice, as some Congressmen did, due to the distance to California, and in any event he felt that practicing law while a lawmaker was a conflict of interest. Thus, he indicated, he had found that the best way to pay for political expenses not within his means was to allow contributors to do so. Nixon proffered the legal and accounting opinions as proof of his statements.|$|E

2500|$|Lastly, Shakespeare {{finishes}} the sonnet (as expected) with a couplet: two consecutive rhyming lines. Each line contains ten syllables, {{and the second}} line is composed only of one-syllable words.

Gascoigne is quoted as saying, [...] "The more monosyllables that <b>you</b> <b>use,</b> <b>the</b> truer Englishman you shall seemed, and the less you shall smell of the Inkhorn".|$|E

In 1895, for example, Adeline Knapp published her short story [...] "The Ways That Are Dark", quoting {{a line from the}} poem.

2500|$|Jeremy {{began using}} {{his first and}} middle name professionally in the adult industry, after his {{grandmother}} Rose was pestered by people calling her thinking they were contacting him.

2500|$|The term may be spelled with {{or without}} a hyphen (antisemitism or anti-Semitism). Some {{scholars}} favor the unhyphenated form because, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> hyphenated form, you consider the words 'Semitism', 'Semite', 'Semitic' as meaningful" [...] whereas [...] "in antisemitic parlance, 'Semites' really stands for Jews, just that." [...] For example, Emil Fackenheim supported the unhyphenated spelling, in order to [...] " [...] the notion that there is an entity 'Semitism' which 'anti-Semitism' opposes." [...] Others endorsing an unhyphenated term for the same reason include Padraic O'Hare, professor of Religious and Theological Studies and Director of the Center for the Study of Jewish-Christian-Muslim Relations at Merrimack College; Yehuda Bauer, professor of Holocaust studies at the Avraham Harman Institute of Contemporary Jewry at Hebrew University of Jerusalem; and James Carroll, historian and novelist. According to Carroll, who first cites O'Hare and Bauer on [...] "the existence of something called 'Semitism'", [...] "the hyphenated word thus reflects the bipolarity that {{is at the heart of}} the problem of antisemitism".|$|E
