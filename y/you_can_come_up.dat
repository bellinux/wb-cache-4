500|$|In the {{subsequent}} decade, two pioneers {{of the style}} became increasingly commercially viable. According to Nielsen Soundscan, Napalm Death sold 367,654 units between May 1991 and November 2003, while Carcass sold 220,374 units in the same period. The inclusion of Napalm Death's [...] "Twist the Knife (Slowly)" [...] on the Mortal Kombat soundtrack brought the band much greater visibility, as the compilation scored a Top 10 position in the Billboard 200 chart and went platinum {{in less than a}} year.< The originators of the style have expressed some ambivalence regarding {{the subsequent}} popularity of grindcore. Pete Hurley, the guitarist of Extreme Noise Terror, declared that he had no interest in being remembered as a pioneer of this style: [...] "'grindcore' was a legendarily stupid term coined by a hyperactive kid from the West Midlands, and {{it had nothing to do}} with us whatsoever. ENT were, are, and - I suspect - always will be a hardcore punk band... not a grindcore band, a stenchcore band, a trampcore band, or any other sub-sub-sub-core genre-defining term <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> with." [...] Lee Dorian of Napalm Death indicated that [...] "Unfortunately, I think the same thing happened to grindcore, if you want to call it that, as happened to punk rock - all the great original bands were just plagiarised by a billion other bands who just copied their style identically, making it no longer original and no longer extreme." ...|$|E

Their friends are keen to see Sybil nonetheless, and Basil struggles to keep them downstairs. Virginia reminds Basil that she is a qualified nurse and becomes determined to see Sybil in order to diagnose her illness. Kitty and Reg arrive saying they saw Sybil driving in the town, but Basil assures them that it was another [...] "northern woman" [...] who resembles her. Alice tries to rein in her wise-cracking husband, Roger, who suspects Basil is covering up for having a row with Sybil. Basil tries reverse psychology insisting the group disturb Sybil: [...] "I'll just pop upstairs and tell her to stop dying so that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> all <b>come</b> <b>up</b> and identify her." [...] This naturally makes the guests feel very uncomfortable and reluctant, but Roger is not so easily dissuaded.|$|R

5000|$|Boy Meets Boy creator Doug Ross {{has held}} out {{hope for a}} second season. He has {{acknowledged}} that the popularity of season one would make it practically impossible for another season with the same twist but has {{also said that he}} has <b>come</b> <b>up</b> with another twist which Bravo executives thought was fun. Speaking in 2007, Bravo executive Frances Berwick pointed to public knowledge of the twist as a stumbling block to a second season, noting the difficulty Bravo had selling the series overseas because of international press reports on the twist. On the possibility of a season two with a new twist, Berwick said, [...] "What Bravo does best is to do things first and to really sort of shake up people's preconceptions and notions about things. And we would accept many different formats a Boy Meets Boy-type. I'm not saying that they wouldn't be as good, because <b>you</b> <b>can</b> always <b>come</b> <b>up</b> with something else. But until we find the perfect way to do it..." [...] Berwick also suggested that at the time a series as gay-specific as Boy Meets Boy might not have fit into Bravo's overall programming strategy. [...] "It has to feel like it's broad enough, and multidimensional enough to work for our incredibly smart audience." ...|$|R

[...] Virgil Thomson found this process frustrating: [...] "Anyone who allowed her in any piece to tell him what to do next would see that piece ruined before his eyes by the application of routine recipes and bromides from standard repertory." [...] Copland recalled that [...] "she had but one all-embracing principle...the creation of what she called la grande ligne - the long line in music." [...] She disapproved of innovation for innovation's sake: [...] "When you are writing music of your own, never strain to avoid the obvious."

5000|$|Gary Cohn recounted how he {{and writing}} partner Dan Mishkin created Blue Devil: Our editor {{for a number of}} things we were doing was a guy named Dave Manak. At this point, Dan Mishkin was living in Michigan and I was in New York. I was the point guy who went to the DC office once a week and schmoozed the editors. One day Manak says, [...] "Ditko’s been hanging around the office and he really wants {{something}} to do. Do you think <b>you</b> and Dan <b>can</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> for something for him?" [...] I went home and I called Dan and told him about this, and we were both very excited. Ditko was the guy who created Spider-Man and Dr. Strange, and we were gaga for Ditko! ... We decided to do something that takes something from every Marvel character we ever loved. Let’s take Iron Man, the guy in the costume; the Thing, the tragedy of the guy stuck in a shape he didn’t want; and a light-hearted, bouncy approach and a character who was going to move like Spider-Man. ... And we wanted something like the Green Goblin. How about Blue Devil? We called him that because Dan’s wife is from North Carolina and he was a Blue Devils fan. Then we started creating Blue Devil and thinking, [...] "Ditko is going to love this!" [...] We created this great proposal, and it was everything that we knew was going to set Ditko’s light on high beam. We took it in to Manak and he gave it to Ditko. Ditko looked at it and said, [...] "I’ll do it if I have to, but this is really not my kind of stuff at all." ...|$|R

5000|$|In 2005 he {{opted to}} compete in the IFSA British Championships which was set up in direct rivalry with the BSM after IFSA parted company with the BSM and World's Strongest Man {{competition}} organiser TWI. He finished second in that competition to Mark Felix. Like many British strongmen he returned to the TWI British circuit in 2006 and won Britain's Strongest Man that year. He also competed in the 2006 IFSA World Championship where he made the final and came eighth. Disaster struck in February 2007, whilst he was training for the Mohegan Sun Super Series. He was deadlifting and he tore his biceps. Reportedly, he said that it did not hurt. He went on to say [...] "No, there are no nerves in there, it didn’t hurt. I just heard it snap and I was just aware of it. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> feel it <b>come</b> <b>up,</b> but there’s no pain." [...] Although the biceps was repaired Thompson has reported that it feels different and that [...] "it’s just not quite as smooth." [...] Although he has said that he does not think it will ever be the same, he has also said that: [...] "When I get to a competition, I won’t be holding back because of my arm. I’ve already won Britain’s Strongest Man - you don’t want to go down - you’ve got to try and win Britain’s Strongest Man again or it’s pointless. So I’ve got to win it really. That’ll be how I judge where I go from there - if I win it or not. Second place isn’t something I’ll be chuffed with." [...] Thompson trained intensively with training partner Scott Reid, the 2007 Britain’s Strongest Man in the 105 kg weight class. He went on to qualify for the finals of Britain's Strongest Man in 2008 and won his heat in the process.
