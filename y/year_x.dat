2500|$|The {{chronology}} {{of the ancient}} Near East provides a framework of dates for various events, rulers and dynasties. Individual inscriptions and texts customarily record events {{in terms of a}} succession of officials or rulers, taking forms like [...] "in the <b>year</b> <b>X</b> of king Y". Thus by piecing together many records a relative chronology is arrived at, relating dates in cities over a wide area. For the first millennium BC, the relative chronology can be tied to actual calendar years by identifying significant astronomical events. An inscription from the tenth year of Assyrian king Ashur-Dan III refers to an eclipse of the sun, and astronomical calculations among the range of possible dates identify the eclipse as having occurred 15 June 763 BCE. The date can be corroborated with other mentions of astronomical events and a secure absolute chronology established, that ties the relative chronologies into our calendar.|$|E

40|$|This study aims {{to compare}} the women engaged in doing regular {{exercise}} and those having done exercise previously and now not doing it or never done it before in terms of such blood values as leptin, cholesterol, insulin, glucose, triglyceride levels and body fat percentage (BFP) and to investigate the effects of regular exercise on these values. The participants of the study consisted of 35 (sportswomen) women doing regular exercise and 35 healthy and sedentary female university students never involved in doing regular exercise before. With {{the permission of the}} ethics committee, measuring was made. The mean (X) age of those doing regular exercise was 18. 03 ± 0. 81 <b>years,</b> <b>X</b> height was 163. 62 ± 5. 28 cm, X weight was 57. 12 ± 5. 77 kg, and training background 7. 34 ± 1. 75 <b>years.</b> <b>X</b> age of sedentary group was 18. 91 ± 0. 72 <b>years,</b> <b>X</b> height was 164. 45 ± 5. 44 cm, X weight was 58. 15 ± 4. 68 kg. Statistically {{significant differences were found between}} the two groups in terms of the values of HDL and Triglyceride (p 0. 05). The increase in serum leptin levels is directly correlated with BFP. It has also been observed that regular exercise, as it reduces BFP, suppresses serum leptin levels. Regular exercise is significant in the regulation of body weight and prevention of obesity. It is concluded that if regular and moderate exercise is supplemented by good nutrition to avoid cardiovascular risk factor, to reduce LDL level, to bring about an increase in the level of HDL, this creates a positive influence on hormones and body fats and that exercise could be an important factor in enhancing the quality of life...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Extract of unripe pawpaw (Carica papaya) has {{traditionally}} been used as an antisickling agent by some sickle cell patients in Western Nigeria. An evaluation {{of the effects of}} intake of the extract on functions of the liver of sickle cell patients categorized into three according to their age, 2 to < 6 <b>years</b> (<b>x</b> 5. 2), 6 to < 12 <b>years</b> (<b>x</b> 9. 7) and, 12 yreas and above (x 21. 4) was carried out using standard techniques. Total and conjugated bilirubins (TB and CB) were significantly reduced (p< 0. 05) during intake than before intake of the extract. Total proteins (TP), albumin (Alb) and globulin (glb) were significantly increased (p< 0. 05) but within the reference range during intake than before intake. The valves of aspartate and alanine transaminases (AST and ALT) and cholesterol were within the reference range before and during the intake of the extract. Alkaline phosphatase (alk. Phos) was significantly increased (p< 0. 05) but within reference range during intake than before intake of the extract. Prothrombin Time (PT) and Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT) were within the reference range before and during intake of the extract. We concluded that the extract of unripe pawpaw has no adverse effect on liver functions.

40|$|AbstractCerebral palsy (CP) is {{a common}} cause of motor {{deficiency}} in children born prematurely. The present study explored the effect of biographical factors on study measures; determined whether performance on neuro-sensory motor developmental assessment (NSMDA) at 8, 12 and 24 months in prematurely born children with CP predicted performance {{at the age of}} 4 years; and investigated the percentage of children within each NSMDA classification at each test age who were walking independently at the age of 4 years. Forty-three children born prematurely and diagnosed with CP by the age of 4 years were assessed on NSMDA. Regression analyses showed that NSMDA at 8 months was predictive of classification at 12 months (x 2 (1) = 10. 3, p = 0. 001, OR = 2. 6, 95 % CI = 1. 45, 4. 66); at 12 months predicted classification at 2 <b>years</b> (<b>x</b> 2 (1) = 12. 2, p = 0. 000, OR = 4. 15, 95 % CI = 1. 86, 9. 2); and at 2 years predicted classification at 4 <b>years</b> (<b>x</b> 2 (1) = 8. 2, p = 0. 004, OR = 4. 7, 95 % CI = 1. 63, 13. 87).
