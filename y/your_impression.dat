6000|$|But his {{companion}} immediately met it. [...] "Haven't you after all had <b>your</b> <b>impression</b> of it? That's how you've {{got hold of}} him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are very}} good. You are a learned man. I am only a poor ignorant woman. <b>Your</b> <b>impression</b> can not {{possibly}} require correcting by mine." ...|$|E
6000|$|But what I deplore still more, and I {{think with}} reason, {{is the total}} {{omission}} of the familiar interrogation: [...] "What is <b>your</b> <b>impression</b> of our women?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "May we ask then," [...] we resumed, {{correcting}} our obvious blunder, [...] "what are <b>your</b> <b>impressions,</b> Prince, of the Atlantic Ocean?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Couldn't {{you keep}} <b>your</b> <b>Impressions</b> of America {{for the book}} you're going to write, {{and come to the}} point?" [...] said Wally rudely.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, as to that, {{of course}} I don't know. You {{ought to be}} the best judge of that. But I don't believe <b>your</b> <b>impressions</b> would deceive you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come {{and smoke}} a pipe with me, Bathurst, before you turn in," [...] the Doctor said, {{as they went}} out. [...] "I don't think either {{of us will be}} likely to go to sleep for some time. What is <b>your</b> <b>impression</b> of all this?" ...|$|E
60|$|Please tell me {{what was}} his Christian name, and whether he was in our service or that of the enemy. I shall also be glad to have <b>your</b> <b>impression</b> as to the effect the late {{operations}} about Murfreesborough {{will have on the}} prospects of Tennessee.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh no--no, sir," [...] {{said the}} son, {{instantly}} relieving his brows from the strain upon them, and beaming again. [...] "But I was thinking {{whether you were}} not perhaps right in <b>your</b> <b>impression</b> {{that it might be}} well for you to make Colonel Lapham's acquaintance before a great while." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Fifthly and lastly," [...] said he, {{glancing at}} the tube. [...] "Say, young fellah, don't tell me you've been writin' up <b>your</b> <b>impressions</b> in that paper on your knee." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I want {{to marry}} with my eyes open. I want to know my wife. You don't know people {{when you are in}} love with them. <b>Your</b> <b>impressions</b> are colored." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Where do {{you want}} to go? Oh, I forget that you have never been in New York before. By the way, what are <b>your</b> <b>impressions</b> of our glorious country?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{you wish}} me to infer," [...] the {{psychologist}} pursued, [...] "that the entire incident was {{a figment of}} your sleeping brain? That there was no sort of sleeping thought-transference, no metaphantasmia, no--Excuse me. Do you remember verifying <b>your</b> <b>impression</b> of being between Worcester and Springfield when the affair occurred, by looking at your watch, for instance?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{more serious}} trouble was the {{questions}} put {{to me by}} the reporters. Over in our chief centres of population we use another set altogether. I am thinking here especially of the kind of interview that I have given out in Youngstown, Ohio, and Richmond, Indiana, and Peterborough, Ontario. In all these places--for example, in Youngstown, Ohio the reporter asks as his first question, [...] "What is <b>your</b> <b>impression</b> of Youngstown?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am glad I {{took you}} away," [...] said Lawrence, [...] "but {{it seems to}} me that <b>your</b> <b>impression</b> was not {{altogether}} natural. I thought that, amid all that mad enthusiasm, you were over-excited, not depressed. A solemn solitude like this would, to my thinking, be much more likely to lower your spirits. I don't like solitude, myself, and therefore, I suppose it is that I thought an impressible nature, like yours, would find something sad in the loneliness of these silent woods." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Suppose you {{try your}} hand at a {{descriptive}} article," [...] I suggested, [...] "giving <b>your</b> <b>impressions</b> of New York {{as seen from the}} Brooklyn Bridge. The fresh point of view, the--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A week--only I want it off my mind. You can get {{out somewhere}} and rub up <b>your</b> <b>impressions.</b> We'll dine for half a crown in Soho, and you shall tell me about Paris." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope," [...] said she, [...] "that you are {{collecting}} <b>your</b> <b>impressions.</b> If so, I am {{sure they}} {{must be in the}} air, for you have not looked to the right or to the left." ...|$|R
6000|$|Strether {{took another}} turn about the room, giving a twitch to his companion's blanket and finally gaining the door. His feeling {{was that of}} a nurse who had earned {{personal}} rest by having made everything straight. [...] "Involving more things than I can think of breaking ground on now. But don't be afraid--you shall have them from me: you'll probably find yourself having quite as much of them as you can do with. I shall--if we keep together--very much depend on <b>your</b> <b>impression</b> of some of them." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{letter from}} Little White Lion Street does not impress me favourably. It is not {{written in a}} simple or truthful manner, I am afraid, {{and is not a}} good reference. Moreover, I think it {{probable}} that the writer may have deserted some pursuit for which he is qualified, for vague and laborious strivings which he has no pretensions to make. However, I will certainly act on <b>your</b> <b>impression</b> of him, whatever it may be. And if you could explain to the gentleman in Nelson Square, that I am not evading his request, but that I do not know of anything to which I can recommend him, {{it would be a great}} relief to me.|$|E
6000|$|... "You held {{your own}} bravely," [...] I answered, [...] "but what is <b>your</b> <b>impression</b> {{of the man}} {{now that you have}} seen him?" [...] "Why," [...] said my father, [...] "he is one of those holy men who, under the various names of Sannasis, Yogis, Sevras, Qualanders, Hakims, and Cufis have devoted their lives {{to the study of the}} mysteries of the Buddhist faith. He is, I take it, a theosophist, or worshipper of the God of knowledge, the highest grade of which is the adept. This man and his companions have not {{attained}} this high position or they could not have crossed the sea without contamination. It is probable that they are all advanced chelas who hope in time to attain to the supreme honour of adeptship." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Von Ragastein," [...] {{he said at}} last, [...] "I {{have sent}} {{for you to have}} a few words {{concerning}} your habitation in England. I wish you to receive <b>your</b> <b>impressions</b> of <b>your</b> mission from my own lips." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's all right, Miss Dalstan," [...] {{the young}} man {{declared}} soothingly. [...] "See you later, Mr. Romilly," [...] he added. [...] "Maybe you'll let us have a few of <b>your</b> <b>impressions</b> to work in with the other stuff." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When {{you leave}} it, come {{and tell me}} what are <b>your</b> <b>impressions,</b> and what you think of Mr. Daubeny's speech. There'll be nothing done in the House before four, and you'll be able to run up to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Is that <b>your</b> <b>impression?</b> And she {{the most}} {{intelligent}} of the lot, too. Things then are going as well as possible. Everything conspires to...Ah! these conspirators," [...] he said slowly, with an accent of scorn; [...] "they would get hold of you in no time! You know, Natalia Victorovna, I have the greatest difficulty in saving myself from the superstition of an active Providence. It's irresistible.... The alternative, of course, would be the personal Devil of our simple ancestors. But, if so, he has overdone it altogether--the old Father of Lies--our national patron--our domestic god, whom we take with us when we go abroad. He has overdone it. It seems that I am not simple enough.... That's it! I ought to have known.... And I did know it," [...] he added {{in a tone of}} poignant distress which overcame my astonishment.|$|E
6000|$|... 7. The {{characters}} of the dramatis personæ, like those in real life, are to be inferred by the reader;—they are not told to him. And it is well worth remarking that Shakespeare’s characters, like those in real life, are very commonly misunderstood, and almost always understood by different persons in different ways. The causes are the same in either case. If you take only what {{the friends of the}} character say, you may be deceived, and still more so, if that which his enemies say; nay, even the character himself sees himself through the medium of his character, and not exactly as he is. Take all together, not omitting a shrewd hint from the clown or the fool, and perhaps <b>your</b> <b>impression</b> will be right; and you may know whether you have in fact discovered the poet’s own idea, by all the speeches receiving light from it, and attesting its reality by reflecting it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Better cold lather, barber, than a cold heart. Why {{that cold}} sign? Ah, I don't wonder {{you try to}} shirk the confession. You feel in your soul how ungenerous a hint is there. And yet, barber, now that I look into your eyes--which somehow speak to me of the mother that must have so often looked into them before me--I dare say, though you may not think it, {{that the spirit of}} that {{notification}} is not one with your nature. For look now, setting, business views aside, regarding the thing in an abstract light; in short, supposing a case, barber; supposing, I say, you see a stranger, his face accidentally averted, but his visible part very respectable-looking; what now, barber--I put it to your conscience, to your charity--what would be <b>your</b> <b>impression</b> of that man, in a moral point of view? Being in a signal sense a stranger, would you, for that, signally set him down for a knave?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You wander, you wander!" [...] we exclaimed. [...] "Why {{should we}} care for <b>your</b> <b>impressions</b> of German cooking and waiting, unless {{they go to}} prove or {{disprove}} that living in New York is cheaper than in the European capitals?" ...|$|R
60|$|You are {{constantly}} denouncing other general {{officers and the}} inference with people naturally {{is that you get}} <b>your</b> <b>impressions</b> from me. Do nothing to correct what you have already done but for the future keep quiet on this subject.|$|R
6000|$|... "Glad to meet you, Mr. Crawshay," [...] he said, [...] "but {{a little}} {{disturbed}} at the cause. I {{must say that}} I hope you will find <b>your</b> <b>impressions</b> ill-founded. I don't like things of this sort happening in my house." ...|$|R
60|$|In short, if Byron {{leaves you}} with an {{impression}} that he said very little about Catherine, and that little not what was best worth saying, I beg to correct <b>your</b> <b>impression</b> by assuring you that what Byron said was all there really {{is to say that}} is worth saying. His Catherine is my Catherine and everybody's Catherine. The young man who gains her favor is a Spanish nobleman in his version. I have made him an English country gentleman, who gets out of his rather dangerous scrape, by simplicity, sincerity, and the courage of these qualities. By this I have given some offence to the many Britons who see themselves as heroes: what they mean by heroes being theatrical snobs of superhuman pretensions which, though quite groundless, are admitted with awe {{by the rest of the}} human race. They say I think an Englishman a fool. When I do, they have themselves to thank.|$|E
6000|$|The book I was to {{have given}} Longfellow for you is not worth sending by itself, being only a Barnaby. But I will look up some {{manuscript}} for you (I think I have that of the American Notes complete), and {{will try to make}} the parcel better worth its long conveyance. With regard to Maclise's pictures, you certainly are quite right in <b>your</b> <b>impression</b> of them; but he is [...] "such a discursive devil" [...] (as he says about himself) and flies off at such odd tangents, that I feel it difficult to convey to you any general notion of his purpose. I will try to do so when I write again. I want very much to know about ---- and that charming girl. [...] . Give me full particulars. Will you remember me cordially to Sumner, and say I thank him for his welcome letter? The like to Hillard, with many regards to himself and his wife, with whom I had one night a little conversation which I shall not readily forget. The like to Washington Allston, and all friends who care for me and have outlived my book. [...] . Always, my dear Felton, ...|$|E
60|$|Your letter {{covering}} the newspaper slips was received last night. The subject of that letter is exceedingly painful to me, and I cannot but {{think there is}} some mistake in <b>your</b> <b>impression</b> of the motives of the old men. I suppose I am now one of the old men; and I declare on my veracity, which I think is good with you, that nothing could afford me more satisfaction than to learn that you and others of my young friends at home were doing battle in the contest and endearing themselves to the people and taking a stand far above any I have ever been able to reach in their admiration. I cannot conceive that other men feel differently. Of course I cannot demonstrate what I say; but I was young once, and I am sure I was never ungenerously thrust back. I hardly know what to say. The way for a young man to rise is to improve himself every way he can, never suspecting that anybody wishes to hinder him. Allow me to assure you that suspicion and jealousy never did help any man in any situation. There may sometimes be ungenerous attempts to keep a young man down; and they will succeed, too, if he allows his mind to be diverted from its true channel to brood over the attempted injury. Cast about and see if this feeling has not injured every person you have ever known to fall into it.|$|E
6000|$|... "You're not an architect, you're a critic," [...] {{he said to}} him {{early in}} their {{accidental}} acquaintance. [...] "Now, I want to experiment on you. I {{want you to see}} Irving to-night and write <b>your</b> <b>impressions</b> of it. I have a notion you'll startle my readers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Are you sure?" [...] he began, {{speaking}} courteously {{to her for}} {{the first}} time. [...] "May I rely upon the accuracy of <b>your</b> <b>impressions</b> on this subject? I know you are incapable of trifling in a matter which might expose me to humiliation; but can you give me any guarantee--any--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] assented B. [...] "You {{can put in}} that if you like. There is no harm in it. And {{then you}} can go on to speak of the play itself, and give <b>your</b> <b>impressions</b> {{concerning}} it. Never mind their being silly. They will be all the better for that. Silly remarks are generally more interesting than sensible ones." ...|$|R
