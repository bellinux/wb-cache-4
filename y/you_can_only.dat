5|$|In a 2006 Icelandic Radio interview, Fischer {{explained}} {{his reasons for}} advocating Fischerandom Chess:In chess so much depends on opening theory, so the champions before the last century did not {{know as much as}} I do and other players do about opening theory. So if you just brought them back from the dead they wouldn't do well. They'd get bad openings. You cannot compare the playing strength, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> talk about natural ability. Memorisation is enormously powerful. Some kid of fourteen today, or even younger, could get an opening advantage against Capablanca, and especially against the players of the previous century, like Morphy and Steinitz. Maybe they would still be able to outplay the young kid of today. Or maybe not, because nowadays when you get the opening advantage not only do you get the opening advantage, you know how to play, they have so many examples of what to do from this position... and that is why I don't like chess any more... It is all just memorization and prearrangement...|$|E

25|$|Three sets of grades {{exist in}} Swedish {{universities}} and university colleges. Some universities have introduced a seven-grade scale (A-F, Fx), that {{similar to the}} ECTS scale, but with a criterion-referenced grading instead of relative grading. The most common scale is a three-grade scale that consists of U (Underkänd in Swedish, fail), G (Godkänd, pass) and VG (Väl godkänd, pass with distinction). In this set VG is the highest. The other grade set consists of (U, 3, 4, 5) where 5 is the highest. This grade set is normally given in courses within technical professional degrees. Finally there are some courses, within two systems of grading, in which <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> get G (pass) or U (fail). For instance, for a one semester thesis (specialized level) in Computer Science for a Master's degree at some institutions one can only get the grade G (pass) or fail, while for an equivalent thesis at other institutions one can also receive the grade VG.|$|E

Nick Levine of Digital Spy called [...] "Don't Stop the Music" [...] "brilliant and unwitting", and {{said that it was}} the best single with a Jackson writing credit since his 1997 [...] "Blood on the Dance Floor". PopMatters Quentin B.

Another says that the painting resulted from an effort to prove his abilities to both his son and his son's classmates who mocked Lichtenstein's hard-to-fathom abstracts. American painter Allan Kaprow once stated, in reference to a Bazooka Dubble Bubble Gum wrapper, to Lichtenstein, [...] "You can't teach color from Cézanne, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> teach it from something like this."

[...] He also confirmed with Spielberg's office that payment had been sent from there. Filmmaker Michael Haneke criticized the sequence in which Schindler's women are accidentally sent off to Auschwitz and herded into showers: [...] "There's a scene in that film when we don't know if there's gas or water coming out in the showers in the camp. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> do something like that with a naive audience like in the United States.

[...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote for AllMusic that [...] "there's a melancholic comfort to its ebb and flow, a gentle rocking motion that feels comforting; it's a tonic to the cloistered, scattered King of Limbs and even the sleek alienation of Kid A." [...] Pitchfork editor Jayson Greene felt the album was coloured by Yorke's separation: [...] "The impact of trauma, a sort of car crash of the soul, is palpable. The music here feels loose and unknotted, broken open in the way <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> be after a tragedy." [...] At the end of the year, Pitchfork named [...] "Daydreaming" [...] and [...] "True Love Waits" [...] the 24th and 9th best songs of 2016 respectively.|$|E

Cameron eventually reveals himself. He had murdered Sharon's ex-boyfriend (and Cassie's biological father) Frank Barritt (Phil Dozois), who was visiting town, and hid the body in Sharon's car trunk. Cameron's crimes are revealed; he is jailed, absolving Sharon of wrongdoing. Although Sharon did not actually murder Cameron, Case praised the storyline and called Sharon a heroine. She explained: [...] "Your romantic lead shouldn't just be a simple romantic lead. Sharon was {{that for a long}} time.

Speaks five languages! I’ve got a 15-year-old boy from the Ivory Coast who speaks five languages!" [...] After Arsenal's defeat to Manchester United in February 1997 – a match marred by a bust up between Wright and Schmeichel, Wenger referred to Ferguson’s interference: [...] "I {{was surprised to see}} Ferguson on the pitch because <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> play eleven." [...] When Ferguson asserted that his team played the best football in England during the 2001–02 season, Wenger quipped: [...] "Everyone thinks they have the prettiest wife at home," [...] a subtle remark that Ferguson initially suspected was a taunt at his own wife Cathy.|$|E

Jillette was originally planning to do an episode of [...] based on Scientology, but Showtime prohibited him from doing so to avoid the possibility of legal action from the Church of Scientology.

[...] and with uncooperative subjects. Thus, he says, he created his own magazine with what Daily Beast described as [...] "female full-frontal nudity, luxe-y aesthetic, and [...] underpinning of fashion-world credibility" [...] that has gotten [...] "influential tastemakers and industry icons" [...] to take notice. According to Shaw, treats! was founded to present content that was too risqué for magazines such as Vogue, Elle and InStyle. Shaw's nickname for photos that could not be used because they pushed the borders too far was [...] "treats", and he decided to use the nickname as the title for the magazine. The magazine presents images that have not been airbrushed or photographically retouched.|$|E

Though it is {{regarded}} as seminal to the growth of punk rock in England and elsewhere, Lydon has repeatedly rejected any suggestion that it influenced the Sex Pistols: [...] " [...] were all long-haired and of no interest to me. I didn't like their image, what they stood for, or anything about them"; [...] "They were hilarious but <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> go so far with 'duh-dur-dur-duh'. I've heard it. Next.

They devoted the rest of the month to touring small cities and towns in the north of England and recording demos in London with producer and recording artist Chris Spedding. The following month they played their first gig in Manchester, arranged by Devoto and Shelley. The Sex Pistols' performance of 4 June at the Lesser Free Trade Hall set off a punk rock boom in the city.|$|E

Regarding the Ninth Doctor's less eccentric character, Davies stated: [...] "He travels in time and space, he's got two hearts, he's a Time Lord— that's eccentric enough to be getting on with". In contrast with previous Doctors, the Ninth Doctor speaks with a distinct Northern accent. Remarking on this aspect of his characterisation Eccleston states that the character [...] "is a scientist and an intellectual, {{and a lot of people}} seem to think <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> be those things if you speak with received pronunciation which, of course, is rubbish." [...] In regards to the Doctor's costume, consisting of simply a black leather coat and dark trousers, Eccleston stated, [...] "I didn't want the costume to be my performance" [...] and that [...] "I wanted any flamboyance and colour to come out of my acting." [...] Eccleston thought that as the Doctor he should show a [...] "slight dark side" [...] but also bring out a lighter side.
