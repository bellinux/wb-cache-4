She initially was uncomfortable finding herself viewed as a role model for girls, preferring to simply be noticed as a top jockey. She became aware that she could {{have a positive impact on}} others and that helped her be more comfortable with her prominence. [...] She still prefers to emphasize her riding prowess, and stated in 2014, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>show</b> your work ethic and professionalism and obvious skill and ability, that is what is going to win somebody over." ...|$|E

500|$|Since [...] "Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da" [...] {{was not a}} {{song that}} McCartney's bandmates enjoyed recording, the motive behind Harrison's {{appropriation}} of the title has invited speculation. Author Jeffrey Roessner considers it significant that Harrison mispronounces the title; in addition, he contends that the full statement – [...] "We all know Ob-la-di-bla-da / But can <b>you</b> <b>show</b> me where you are?" [...] – serves {{as an example of}} Harrison, like Lennon, mocking those listeners who obsessively scanned the Beatles' lyrics for [...] "clues". Music journalist Robert Fontenot interprets the lines as an expression of distaste for [...] "Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da", since Harrison and Lennon were openly critical of McCartney's composition.|$|E

500|$|Burton {{approached}} Sam Hamm, a {{comic book}} fan, to write the screenplay. Hamm decided not to use an origin story, feeling that flashbacks would be more suitable and that [...] "unlocking the mystery" [...] would {{become part of the}} storyline. He reasoned, [...] "You totally destroy your credibility if <b>you</b> <b>show</b> the literal process by which Bruce Wayne becomes Batman." [...] Hamm replaced Silver St. Cloud with Vicki Vale and Rupert Thorne with his own creation, Carl Grissom. He completed his script in October 1986, which demoted Dick Grayson to a cameo rather than a supporting character. One scene in Hamm's script had a young James Gordon on duty {{the night of the murder}} of Bruce Wayne's parents. When Hamm's script was rewritten, the scene was deleted, reducing it to a photo in the Gotham Globe newspaper seen in the film.|$|E
500|$|Megan Fox was {{originally}} {{attached to the}} film, and Patrick Dempsey's role as Dylan Gould {{was to be the}} employer of Fox's character, Mikaela Banes. According to various published sources, Fox's absence from the film was due to Bay ultimately choosing not to renew her role in light of her comparing him and his work ethics to Adolf Hitler, although representatives for the actress said that it was her decision to leave the film franchise. Bay later claimed that Fox was fired by executive producer Steven Spielberg, a claim which Spielberg denied. [...] "I wasn't hurt", Bay stated, [...] "because I know that's just Megan. Megan loves to get a response. And she does it in kind of the wrong way. I'm sorry, Megan. I'm sorry I made you work twelve hours. I'm sorry that I'm making <b>you</b> <b>show</b> up on time.

500|$|It is an Eurodance song, which {{incorporates}} heavy synth-pop {{elements in}} its instrumentation and {{is similar to}} previous works by producer David Guetta. Contemporary critics compared the track to Britney Spears' [...] "Till the World Ends" [...] (2011) and Chris Brown's [...] "Beautiful People" [...] (2011). Lyrically, Bieber sings for his love interest and says that [...] "all around the world, {{people want to be}} loved".

As the track follows, Bieber encourages girls to release their inner beauty: [...] "Light it up, so explosive/Why you acting so shy, holding back/DJ bring that back." [...] During the rap section, Ludacris references their previous collaboration on [...] "Baby" [...] (2010), saying, [...] "Once again, the dynamic duo is back at it!/ JB, Ludacris!/ I love everything about you/ You're imperfectly perfect/ Everyone's itching for beauty/But they're just scratching the surface." ...|$|E

500|$|Trial by Jury is {{the only}} Gilbert and Sullivan opera played in one act and the only {{theatrical}} work by W. S. Gilbert without spoken dialogue. However, later Gilbert and Sullivan operas retained a number of patterns seen in Trial. [...] For example, all except The Yeomen of the Guard begin with a chorus number. [...] Also, like Trial by Jury, the later operas generally end with a relatively short finale consisting of a chorus number interspersed with short solos by the principal characters. [...] "Comes the broken flower" [...] (part of No.3) {{was the first in}} a string of meditative [...] "Horatian" [...] lyrics, [...] "mingling happiness and sadness, an acceptance and a smiling resignation". [...] These would, from this point forward, allow the characters, in each of the Savoy operas, an introspective scene where they stop and consider life, in contrast to the foolishness of the surrounding scenes. [...] Like both of the tenor's arias in Trial by Jury, tenor arias in later Savoy operas were set in 6/8 time so frequently that Anna Russell, in her 1953 parody, [...] "How to Write Your Own Gilbert and Sullivan Opera", exclaimed, [...] "the tenor...according to tradition, must sing an aria in 6/8 time, usually accompanying himself on a stringed instrument". [...] In Trial by Jury hypocrisy is revealed as the characters' motivations are held up to satire, and Gilbert mocks the underlying absurdity of the judicial procedures. [...] As Gilbert scholar Andrew Crowther explains, Gilbert combines his criticisms with comic entertainment, which renders them more palatable, {{while at the same time}} underlining their truth: [...] "By laughing at a joke <b>you</b> <b>show</b> that you accept its premise." [...] This too would become characteristic of Gilbert's work.|$|E
500|$|On 11 October 2016, Buffon {{became the}} first goalkeeper ever to win the Golden Foot Award. Buffon had {{initially}} suffered criticism in the media {{at the beginning of}} the 2016–17 season over a high-profile error against Spain in a World Cup qualifier with Italy, followed by another mistake with Juventus against Udinese in Serie A; although certain analysts questioned his longevity, on 18 October, Buffon drew praise from pundits for his performance in his club's third fixture of the 2016–17 Champions League group stage, as he helped a ten-man Juventus to a 1–0 away win over Lyon. During the match, he saved Alexandre Lacazette's penalty in the 35th minute (his first penalty save in the Champions League since 2003), and later also made a decisive stop on Nabil Fekir's deflected shot early into the second half, while he used his legs to deny Corentin Tolisso's point-blank header in the 71st minute. The victory meant that Juventus had managed to earn their first ever away victory against a French side in the Champions League, while Buffon sealed his third consecutive clean sheet of the season in the competition, and the 42nd Champions League clean sheet of his career. Following the match, Buffon commented [...] "I love it when they celebrate your funeral, and then <b>you</b> <b>show</b> them that you're still alive." [...] Following his performances throughout the calendar year, Buffon was included in the 30-man shortlist for the 2016 Ballon d'Or; he placed ninth alongside Pepe in the final ranking. In Juventus' fourth Champions League group match of the season on 2 November, a 1–1 home draw against Lyon, Buffon made his 100th Champions League appearance (excluding appearances in qualifying rounds), becoming the 29th player to reach this landmark. On 4 November, he was included in the 23-player shortlist for The 2016 Best FIFA Men's Player Award. On 6 November, Buffon earned his 600th Serie A appearance in a 2–1 away win against Chievo, the fourth player to reach this milestone. His performances saw him earn the Juventus Player of the Month Award for October 2016. On 21 November, Buffon was nominated for the UEFA Team of the Year for the ninth time his career, making him goalkeeper with the most nominations ever, alongside Iker Casillas. On 1 December, Buffon was nominated for the 2016 FIFPro World XI, making him the only player, alongside Cristiano Ronaldo, to have been included in the shortlist every year since its inception in 2005. On 23 December, Buffon made his 600th competitive appearance for Juventus in the 2016 Supercoppa Italiana; following a 1–1 draw after extra time, Juventus lost 4–3 to Milan in a penalty shoot-out, although Buffon saved Gianluca Lapadula's initial spot kick. Buffon capped off the year by placing second in the 2016 IFFHS World's Best Goalkeeper Award, finishing behind Neuer once again.|$|E

2500|$|Rabbi Eleazar {{interpreted}} the words [...] "He withdraws not {{his eyes from}} the righteous" [...] in [...] to teach that God rewards righteousness, even generations later. The Gemara taught that in reward for Rachel's modesty as shown in her dealings with Jacob, God rewarded her with King Saul as a descendant. The Gemara taught that Jacob asked Rachel, [...] "Will you marry me?" [...] She replied, [...] "Yes, but my father is a trickster, and he will outwit you." [...] Jacob replied, [...] "I am his brother in trickery." [...] She said to him, [...] "Is it permitted to the righteous to indulge in trickery?" [...] He replied, [...] "Yes, with the pure <b>you</b> <b>show</b> yourself pure, and with the crooked <b>you</b> <b>show</b> yourself subtle." [...] He asked her, [...] "What is his trickery?" [...] She replied: [...] "I have a sister older than I am, and he will not let me marry before her." [...] So Jacob gave her certain tokens through which he could identify her. When night came, she said to herself, [...] "Now my sister will be put to shame," [...] so she gave Leah the tokens. Thus when [...] reports, [...] "And it came to pass in the morning that, behold, it was Leah," [...] we are not to infer that up until then she had not been Leah, but rather that on account of the tokens that Rachel had given Leah, Jacob did not know until then that it was Leah. Therefore, God rewarded Rachel with having Saul among her descendants..|$|E
