[...] "He hired coaches he trusted, then gave them the resources, {{latitude}} and support they needed to operate as they saw fit – providing they played by the rules." [...] Iowa wrestling coach Dan Gable said his wife cried on learning that Elliott had retired. [...] In 1999, Gable wrote: [...] "Right after I came to coach at the University of Iowa, I {{had a meeting with}} Bump Elliott, who was the Athletic Director.

Strive to get there, sure, but do it wisely through continuing to build upon what <b>you</b> <b>already</b> <b>have.</b> As you build, come see me, and we’ll see how I can help you out.’ I now call that bit of wisdom the Bump Elliott Rule, and it serves a good reminder to keep things in perspective. Gradual, solid growth is better than any quick fix.""The one thing we emphasized from the start was that our staff had to make sure we were 100 percent loyal to each other and the university," [...] Elliott said {{at the time of his}} retirement. [...] "There could be no jealousy between the coaches and various programs. [...] I wanted no one talking behind anyone's backs. [...] I wanted absolute loyalty.
