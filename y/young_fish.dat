5|$|Many pets {{have escaped}} or been {{released}} into the Everglades from the surrounding urban areas. Some find the conditions quite favorable and have established self-sustaining populations, competing for food and space with native animals. Many tropical fish have been released, but blue tilapias (Oreochromis aureus) cause damage to shallow waterways by creating large nests and consuming aquatic plants that protect native <b>young</b> <b>fish.</b>|$|E
5|$|The sand whiting {{commonly}} inhabits shallow sandy substrates in bays, estuaries and surf zones {{where it}} preys on polychaete worms, small crustaceans and bivalve molluscs. Reproduction in {{the species is}} variable over its range, generally spawning twice between September and April. <b>Young</b> <b>fish</b> inhabit shallow sand flats, both along the coast and well into {{the upper reaches of}} estuaries.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} {{commonly}} caught throughout its habitat, with sand flats, tidal gutters in estuaries and surf beaches commonly having producing good catches. Excessively shallow water, especially in proximity to Zostera beds may produce numerous undersized fish, {{and may be}} avoided if the <b>young</b> <b>fish</b> are too prevalent. Due to their preferred habitat, light lines with minimal weight added are employed to avoid spooking the fish, with a small running bean or ball sinker commonly rigged above a size 4 or 6 hook. Specialist whiting fishermen often use a red piece of tubing or beads to attract the whiting; whether this works {{has yet to be}} proved, but anecdotal evidence shows the fishermen's catches don't suffer. Baits used resemble the species natural prey, with prawns, nippers, a variety of bivalves and beach worms most often used, with more successful catches obtained using live bait.|$|E

5|$|As {{with many}} species of fish, the timing of {{spawning}} varies over {{the range of the}} species, with gonad development indicating that spawning in the southern New South Wales region occurs from December to April, while spawning in southern Queensland occurs from September to February. Spawning takes place twice a year, evident by the two classes of egg size found in the ovaries and by the two recruitment pulses observed each year as <b>young</b> <b>fish</b> enter their juvenile habitats. The spawning takes place at the mouths of estuaries or in surf zones, with the larvae occurring in fully marine waters. Juveniles reach 16.5cm in length after their first year of life, 26.7cm after their second year and 30.5cm after their third year. After the beginning of the spawning season young whiting of 10mm and over can be observed swimming actively in small droves of from 10 to 20 on the sand flats and beaches to which they are recruited, moving up and down with the tide, swimming in very shallow water to depths of 1m. Unlike closely related sillaginids, the juveniles usually prefer unprotected sand substrates, while other species tend to use seagrass and mangroves as protection. As they grow older they keep further from the shore.|$|E
5|$|Beaches {{protected}} from tides and storms by coral reefs {{are often the}} best places for housing in tropical countries. Reefs are an important food source for low-technology fishing, both on the reefs themselves and in the adjacent seas. However, despite their great productivity, reefs are vulnerable to over-fishing, {{because much of the}} organic carbon they produce is exhaled as carbon dioxide by organisms at the middle levels of the food chain and never reaches the larger species that are of interest to fishermen. Tourism centered on reefs provides much of the income of some tropical islands, attracting photographers, divers and sports fishermen. However, human activities damage reefs in several ways: mining for construction materials; pollution, including large influxes of fresh water from storm drains; commercial fishing, including the use of dynamite to stun fish and the capture of <b>young</b> <b>fish</b> for aquariums; and tourist damage caused by boat anchors and the cumulative effect of walking on the reefs. Coral, mainly from the Pacific Ocean has long been used in jewellery, and demand rose sharply in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|The North Mere is 5.6-acres (2.25 ha) large, and {{is blocked}} off on its {{northern}} end by a sod-cast bank, {{adjacent to the}} site of the North Gate. The southern half takes the form of a 331-foot (101 m) long moat, which was recorded as being 18-foot (5.5 m) deep in the medieval period, terminating in the West Gate. The northern part of this mere occasionally floods in the 21st century, creating a temporary lake, and the moated section usually still contains some standing water. The West Mere, covering 2.25-acres (1 ha), stretches away from the location of West Gate and is blocked at the far end by a small, stone dam. Three rectangular fishponds were built alongside the West Mere, the smallest, probably a stew pond for raising <b>young</b> <b>fish,</b> being fed with water from the lake. A protective earthen bank, probably originally reinforced by a timber palisade, ran for approximately 490 feet (150 m) along either side of the West Gate, where a gatehouse was probably built. At the far end of the lake complex was the South Mere, 2.25-acres (1 ha) in size, with the South Gate positioned in its eastern corner.|$|E

25|$|However, 2005 {{research}} on rockfish shows that large, elderly females {{are far more}} important than <b>younger</b> <b>fish</b> in maintaining productive fisheries. The larvae produced by these older maternal fish grow faster, survive starvation better, and {{are much more likely to}} survive than the offspring of <b>younger</b> <b>fish.</b> Failure to account for the role of older fish may help explain recent collapses of some major US West Coast fisheries. Recovery of some stocks is expected to take decades. One way to prevent such collapses is to establish marine reserves, where fishing is not allowed and fish populations age naturally.|$|R

25|$|Significant dietary {{overlaps}} {{with a number}} of co-occurring species of sillaginids is seen in both juvenile and adult stages in different environments. <b>Young</b> <b>fish</b> in their shallow, protected environments show overlap with young S. burrus, S. schomburgkii and Sillaginodes punctatus in their preference for copepods, although the timing of spawining events somewhat decreases this competition. In deeper nearshore waters, there is minor overlap with S. bassensis, but significant differences reduce interspecific competition.|$|E
25|$|The {{offspring}} {{remain in}} the fresh water until {{they are ready to}} migrate to the ocean as smolts.

Causes of death include natural predators, commercial and sport fishing, disease, low stream flows, poor water quality, flooding, and concentrated developments along streams and lakes.|$|E
50|$|The {{shrimp scad}} {{is known to}} be a migratory species, with records from India {{indicating}} the fish resides and feeds in the waters of Madras from September to May, before migrating elsewhere to spawn. The shrimp scad feeds on a variety of prey, with at least two shifts in diet occurring as the fish mature. Older individuals feed mainly on <b>young</b> <b>fishes,</b> crustaceans like decapods, ostracods, amphipods and cladocerans with minor amounts of nematodes, insect body parts and insect larvae taken. Fish within a length range of 150-199 mm and 240-319 mm showed a preference for <b>young</b> <b>fishes,</b> while those in the length range of 200-239 mm primarily consumed ostracods and other crustaceans. Based on the food items taken, the species is an active midwater feeder. There is less food consumed during breeding season, which is indicative of reduced feeding activity during that period. Sexual maturity is attained by about 17 cm fork length and spawning is thought to occur in shallow coastal waters.|$|R

The hatchery receives its Chinook, coho and steelhead broodstock directly from river-running fish that are allowed directly into the hatchery. The facility also raises brown trout and Atlantic salmon using eggs received from other facilities. In total, the hatchery raises nearly three million <b>young</b> <b>fish</b> for release into New York's waters each year.|$|E
25|$|Older dams {{often lack}} a fish ladder, which keeps many fish from moving {{upstream}} to their natural breeding grounds, causing failure of breeding cycles or blocking of migration paths. Even {{the presence of}} a fish ladder does not always prevent a reduction in fish reaching the spawning grounds upstream.
