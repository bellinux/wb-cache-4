500|$|Final mixing for {{the song}} took place on 21 June as the Beatles rushed to {{complete}} Revolver before beginning {{the first leg of}} their 1966 world tour. Harrison discussed [...] "Love You To" [...] with Shankar when the two musicians met that month, at a social event hosted by the Angadi family. Although he was unaware of the band's popularity and had <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> [...] "Norwegian Wood", Shankar was impressed with Harrison's humility as the guitarist downplayed his sitar recordings with the Beatles as merely [...] "experiments". Soon after this meeting, Shankar gave Harrison his first sitar lesson at Kinfauns, his and Boyd's home in Surrey, and later, with tablist Alla Rakha, performed a private recital there for Harrison, Lennon and Starr. Harrison subsequently recalled of his first lesson with Shankar: [...] "I felt I wanted to walk out of my home that day and take a one-way ticket to Calcutta. I would even have left Pattie behind in that moment." ...|$|E
500|$|Such a {{move would}} have to be made by a {{combination}} of the Australian Federal and State Governments, and has lacked sufficient political and public support. In 2001 Prime Minister John Howard stated that he acknowledged Aboriginal concerns with the date, but that it was nevertheless a significant day in Australia's history, and thus he was in favour of retaining the current date. He also noted that 1 January, which was being discussed in light of the Centenary of Federation, was inappropriate as it coincided with New Year's Day. Prime Minister Kevin Rudd gave a [...] "straightforward no" [...] to a change of date, speaking in response to Mick Dodson's suggestion to reopen the debate. The Leader of the Opposition, Malcolm Turnbull, echoed Rudd's support of 26 January, but, along with Rudd, supported the right of Australians to raise the issue. At the State level, New South Wales Premier Nathan Rees stated that he was <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> a [...] "compelling argument" [...] to support change; and Queensland Premier Anna Bligh expressed her opposition to a change.|$|E
2500|$|At the {{presentation}} ceremony, {{man of the}} match Marlon Samuels dedicated his award to Shane Warne, saying [...] "I answer with the bat, not the mic". This {{was in response to}} an ongoing war-of-words between the two players that dates back to an altercation at the 2013â€“14 Big Bash League. West Indies captain Darren Sammy criticised the WICB during {{the presentation}} speech, saying [...] "I'm <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> from our own cricket board (during the tournament). That is very disappointing". England captain Eoin Morgan said that [...] "we let ourselves down with the bat and probably fell about 40 short" [...] and defended Ben Stokes bowling in the final over saying [...] "it's not his fault".|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thank you}} for having spared her," [...] he began, abruptly. [...] "She is not strong enough <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> bear <b>hearing</b> of a new misfortune, unless I break the tidings to her first." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{looked at}} him in some surprise. I had not <b>yet</b> grown {{accustomed}} <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> him speak in such a tone.|$|R
6000|$|... "We Americans {{are very}} polite," [...] said Acton, whose {{national}} consciousness had been complicated by a residence in foreign lands, and who <b>yet</b> disliked <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> Americans abused. [...] "We don't like to tread upon people's toes," [...] he said. [...] "But I should {{like very much}} <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> about your marriage. Now tell me how it came about." ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{term of the}} {{tribunal}} was initially set to expire in August 2005. [...] However, {{in the light of}} the many arguments the court was <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear,</b> {{the tribunal}} filed a request for extension of its term. [...] The extension was granted and the tribunal's term was extended for another year until September 2006. [...] Early in 2006, a major controversy erupted over the 'Assessor's report' that was apparently 'leaked' to the press. [...] The report had suggested a decision which Karnataka summarily rejected. [...] Another major controversy erupted when just a couple of months before the September 2006 deadline, the tribunal recommended the formation of another expert committee to study the 'ground realities' yet again. [...] This was unanimously and vehemently opposed by all the four states party to the dispute. [...] The states contended that this move would further delay a judgement which has already been 16 years in the making.|$|E
60|$|I {{looked at}} him and he ceased. Somehow I could not bear, as <b>yet,</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> her beloved name spoken by other lips.|$|E
6000|$|... "I fear {{you were}} not born a diplomat, sir," [...] says Patty. [...] "You agree that we are beautiful, <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> that {{one of us is}} more so is small consolation." ...|$|E
60|$|Troil. I think I do, That I <b>yet</b> live <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> you. But no more; Hope for no more; for, should some goddess offer To give {{herself and}} all her heaven in change, I would not part with Cressida: So return This answer as my last.|$|R
40|$|Letter from David Fentress to {{his wife}} Clara {{describing}} his ill health. He remarks {{that he has had}} no letter from her, <b>yet</b> hopes <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> from her {{before the end of the}} war.

6000|$|... "Trust all to me," [...] {{said the}} physician, shrugging his shoulders. [...] "What {{sort of a}} butcher is he that can cut the lamb's throat, <b>yet</b> is afraid <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> it bleat?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, then, Sir John, talk of {{anything}} but of our v'y'ge, to the dear crittur. I {{do not think}} she is quite prepared <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> of all the wonders we saw." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This is news indeed, Mr. Jones," [...] he said. [...] "I have <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> of {{the birth}} of this infant navy, for which we have not yet begun to make {{swaddling}} clothes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Upon my soul I {{wonder at}} you!" [...] Mr. Bucket remonstrates. [...] "I thought the French were a polite nation, I did, really. <b>Yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> a female going {{on like that}} before Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet!" ...|$|E
60|$|Yes, Caesar built a lot {{of roads}} in England, {{and you can find}} them. But Rogers has only built one road, and he hasn't {{finished}} that <b>yet.</b> I like <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> my old friend complimented, but I don't like <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> it overdone.|$|R

6000|$|... "D--n that question!--forget it!" [...] he cried, in {{a passion}} of pain {{for her and}} anger at himself. [...] "But once and for all--tell me--I know it, <b>yet</b> I want <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> you say so--you couldn't help yourself?" ...|$|R
6000|$|I heard Mountain {{whisper to}} Sir William, [...] "Good God! it's the grave! He's digging him up!" [...] It {{was what we}} had all guessed, and <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> it put in {{language}} thrilled me. Sir William violently started.|$|E
6000|$|... "By {{them that}} have the skill of it," [...] {{returned}} he; [...] "but I have <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> that either you or me is much of a hand at that exercise; and for my own part, I swim like a stone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Fred, O poor Fred!" [...] and {{she seemed}} {{on the point of}} another burst of lamentation, but her aunt went on speaking--"I must go to him; he has <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> it, and you had better come to him as soon as you are dressed." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{stepped on}} to the pavement, and {{assisted}} her to alight. The thought of leaving her so abruptly was painful <b>to</b> him, and <b>yet</b> he dreaded <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> her invite him {{to go in with}} her; nevertheless, she did so.|$|R
6000|$|... "A D'Arcy! A D'Arcy!" [...] {{came back}} Wulf's answer from the bridge, {{and his voice}} echoed thin and hollow in the spaces of the gulf. <b>Yet</b> they rejoiced <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> it, for it told them that he was sound and strong.|$|R
6000|$|It was so entirely true, <b>yet</b> so {{shocking}} <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> {{from her}} mouth, {{that all three}} stood aghast, as she stood with heaving chest, crimson cheeks, and big tears in her eyes. Miss Headworth only muttered, 'Oh, my poor child, you mustn't!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This ain't no bluff, Joe Hall! Why don't ye call? Yer's fifty men; {{the returns}} are agin ye, and two precincts <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> from." [...] (This was a double thrust, at Hall's former {{career as a}} gambler, and the {{closeness}} of his late election vote.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What do {{you want}} then--an aristocracy?" [...] he asked, {{secretly}} moved. He always felt that by rights he belonged to the ruling aristocracy. <b>Yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> her speak for his class pained him with a curious, painful pleasure. He felt he was acquiescing in something illegal, taking to himself some wrong, reprehensible advantages.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{talk about}} love," [...] said the Philosopher, [...] "as {{though it were}} a known quantity. After all, to say that a man loves is like saying that he paints or plays the violin; it conveys no meaning until we have {{witnessed}} his performance. <b>Yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> the subject discussed, one might imagine the love of a Dante or a society Johnny, of a Cleopatra or a Georges Sand, to be precisely the same thing." ...|$|E
60|$|It was amusing, <b>yet</b> {{nevertheless}} puzzling, <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> this boyish {{young man}} comment upon Susy's girlishness. And Clarence was serious, {{for he had}} quite forgotten in Mrs. Peyton's presence the impression of superiority which Susy had lately made upon him. But Mrs. Peyton returned to the charge, or, rather, to an attack upon what she conceived to be Clarence's old position.|$|R
60|$|She listened, waiting, hoping <b>yet</b> {{dreading}} <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> the clattering {{approach of}} her cowboys. There would be fighting--blood--men injured, perhaps killed. Even {{the thought of}} violence of any kind hurt her. But perhaps the guerrillas would run in time to avoid a clash with her men. She hoped for that, prayed for it. Through her mind flitted what she knew of Nels, of Monty, of Nick Steele; and she experienced a sensation that left her somewhat chilled and sick. Then {{she thought of the}} dark-browed, fire-eyed Stewart. She felt a thrill drive away the cold nausea. And her excitement augmented.|$|R
60|$|When Father John {{returned}} <b>to</b> Carrick, anxious, <b>yet</b> fearing <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> the verdict, {{he found}} that the jury had not yet agreed. Even this was some comfort, for it made it evident that there was doubt on the subject; and surely, thought he, if a man doubts on such a subject as this, he must ultimately lean to the side of mercy. He remained with Tony McKeon in court till about eight, when they went to the hotel and got their dinner--for they would not leave the town till the jury were locked up for the night.|$|R
6000|$|My friends, we {{will not}} go again or ape an ancient rage, [...] Or stretch the folly of our youth to be the shame of age, [...] But walk with clearer eyes and ears this path that wandereth, [...] And see undrugged in evening light the decent inn of death; [...] For there is good news <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> and fine things to be seen, [...] Before we go to Paradise by way of Kensal Green.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am warned," [...] said Hunsden; [...] "and so are you, lad," [...] (nodding to me). [...] "I hope <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> of {{a travesty}} of the Moor and his gentle lady, {{in which the}} parts shall be {{reversed}} according to the plan just sketched--you, however, being in my nightcap. Farewell, mademoiselle!" [...] He bowed on her hand, absolutely like Sir Charles Grandison on that of Harriet Byron; adding--"Death from such fingers would not be without charms." ...|$|E
60|$|If {{there is}} {{anything}} more embarrassing to a guest than a family row, we have <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> of it. Mike, scarlet to the extreme edges of his ears, concentrated himself on his plate. Comrade Prebble made a great many remarks, which were probably illuminating, {{if they could have}} been understood. Mr Waller looked, astonished, at Mr Richards. Mr Richards, pink but dogged, loosened his collar, but said nothing. Psmith, leaning forward, asked Master Edward Waller his opinion on the Licensing Bill.|$|E
6000|$|... "Poor old Prue's {{child was}} all that she had,--and <b>yet</b> she had <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> it crying, and she couldn't help it! Papa, these poor creatures love their {{children}} {{as much as you}} do me. O! do something for them! There's poor Mammy loves her children; I've seen her cry when she talked about them. And Tom loves his children; and it's dreadful, papa, that such things are happening, all the time!" ...|$|R
50|$|The {{first meeting}} of the Supreme Court of the United States {{was held in the}} Royal Exchange {{building}} on February 1, 1790, although a quorum was not available until the following day. There were not <b>yet</b> any cases <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> at the first meeting. A second session was held in August 1790. The court met in New York for a total of twelve days before it moved to Philadelphia {{with the rest of the}} nascent federal government in 1791.|$|R
5000|$|In 1996 former NHL goalie Daryl [...] "Razor" [...] Reaugh joined Strangis as the Stars' color commentator, thus {{creating}} the popular duo [...] "Ralph and Razor". The two achieved a near cult-like {{following in the}} city of Dallas, so much so that, even though fan support and Dallas' media market size could easily support separate radio and television broadcast teams, the Stars elected to continue simulcasting the pair. In 2008, the Stars added in-arena radio (on 97.5FM) allowing fans <b>yet</b> another opportunity <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> the popular team.|$|R
