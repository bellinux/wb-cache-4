25|$|Alexandros Panagoulis {{was brutally}} {{tortured}} during his incarceration by the junta. Many {{believe that he}} maintained his faculties thanks to his will, determination to defend his beliefs, {{as well as his}} keen sense of humour. While imprisoned at Bogiati, Panagoulis is said to have written his poetry on the walls of his cell or on small papers, often using his own blood as ink (as told in the poem 'The Paint'). Many of his poems have not survived. However, he managed to smuggle some to friends while in prison, or to recall and rewrite them later. While in prison his first collection in Italian titled Altri seguiranno: poesie e documenti dal carcere di Boyati (Others will Follow: Poetry and Documents of the Prison of Boyati) was published in Palermo in 1972 with an introduction of the Italian politician Ferruccio Parri and the Italian film director and intellectual Pier Paolo Pasolini. For this collection Panagoulis was awarded the Viareggio International Prize of Poetry (Premio Viareggio Internazionale) the following year. After his liberation he published his second collection in Milan under the title Vi scrivo da un carcere in Grecia (I write <b>you</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> prison in Greece) with an introduction by Pasolini. He had previously published several collections in Greek, including The Paint (I Bogia).|$|E
500|$|Gotye was {{initially}} {{reported to have}} been unimpressed with the Glee rendition of his song, but later stated that his words had {{been taken out of}} context. On April 22, 2012, two Australian newspapers, the Sunday Mail and the Sunday Herald Sun, quoted him as having said, [...] "They did such a faithful arrangement of the instrumentals but the vocals were that pop Glee style". The Mail's quote continued after a comma with [...] "ultra-dry, sounded pretty tuned and the rock has no real sense, like it's playing to <b>you</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> cardboard box." [...] The Herald Sun's continuation of the quote came after a period: [...] "It made it sound dinky and wrong." [...] Gotye said in an interview the next day that he had been referring to [...] "this xylophone hook in my song—it's kind of dinky not just in the cover version but the original song". He added, [...] "I thought it was really clever to transpose the song to two guys ... It was a great idea." [...] In an interview published ten days later, Glee executive music producer Adam Anders said that although the iTunes version of the song that the show released was [...] "very true" [...] to Gotye's, that in the episode itself, [...] "the reality is, it was drier".|$|E

2500|$|On January 4, 2007, {{before the}} first session of the 110th Congress, Ellison at a multi-faith prayer service recited verse Al-Hujurat 49:13 from the Quran which said: ‘Oh, humanity, we created <b>you</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> single pair, male and female, and made you tribes and nations so that you would know each other and not despise each other.’” ...|$|E

Announcing [...] "Men, I have come to save <b>you</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> drunkard's fate", she began to destroy the saloon's stock with her cache of rocks. After she similarly destroyed two other saloons in Kiowa, a tornado hit eastern Kansas, which she took as divine approval of her actions.|$|E
2500|$|When he {{came back}} to Australia in 1886/87, Read was flabbergasted at the pickiness of the Australian public, and he wrote of it: [...] "If you have a bit of bad luck and make nothing two or three times, you are not of much account in Australia, and out of the team you should go, even if you have scored {{excellently}} on occasions." [...] In England, however, it was different. [...] "There," [...] he reckoned, [...] "if you are a recognised player, half a dozen successive noughts will not exclude <b>you</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> team." ...|$|E
2500|$|Furthermore, as {{relates to}} the {{placement}} of this sura within the Quran as a whole, Neal Robinson notes what {{he refers to as}} the [...] "dovetailing" [...] of suras. Based on this idea of structure, one sura ends with a topic that is immediately picked up in the next sura. The Family of 'Imran, sura 3, includes a discussion of male and female {{near the end of the}} sura (3.195). This theme continues at the beginning of sura 4: [...] "People, be mindful of your Lord, who created <b>you</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> single soul, and from it created its mate, and from the pair of them spread countless men and women far and wide; be mindful of God, in whose name you make requests of one another." [...] This dovetailing may indicate a complex editorial process involved in ordering the suras.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Perhaps in {{a former}} life it was {{permitted}} that I should have rendered thee some service. Maybe'--he smiled--'I freed <b>thee</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> trap; or, having caught thee on a hook {{in the days when}} I was not enlightened, cast thee back into the river.' ...|$|R

2500|$|Del Toro {{said that}} he {{interpreted}} The Hobbit as being set in a [...] "world that is slightly more golden at the beginning, a very innocent environment" [...] and the film would need to [...] " [...] <b>you</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> time of more purity to a darker reality throughout the film, but [...] {{in the spirit of}} the book". He perceived the main themes as loss of innocence, which he likened to the experience of England after World War I, and greed, which he said Smaug and Thorin Oakenshield represent. Bilbo Baggins reaffirms his personal morality during the story's third act as he encounters Smaug and the Dwarves' greed. He added, [...] "The humble, sort of a sturdy moral fibre that Bilbo has very much represents the idea that Tolkien had about the little English man, the average English man", and the relationship between Bilbo and Thorin would be the heart of the film. The Elves will also be less solemn.|$|E
2500|$|Two {{months after}} taking office, Ellison met with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice {{and other top}} State Department {{officials}} to talk about [...] "showcasing his story {{as part of their}} public diplomacy efforts in the Muslim world." [...] According to the Star Tribune, Ellison was [...] "profiled three times by the State Department’s overseas press bureau." [...] He also [...] "did a Voice of America interview from his office, where an American flag was placed conspicuously behind his desk for the cameras." [...] In the interview which was set to play in the Middle East and South Asia, Ellison stressed global inclusiveness and quoted verse 49:13 of the Qur'an [...] "Oh humanity, We created <b>you</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> single pair..." [...] Ellison also accepted the Bush administration's request {{to be part of a}} [...] "teleconference with Karen Hughes, the State Department's undersecretary for public diplomacy. The White House has asked that the teleconference promote American values and confront ideological support for terrorism around the world." [...] The Voice of America applauded Ellison's cooperation saying [...] "He is the most famous freshman congressman in the world." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ristar {{received}} {{considerably more}} positive reviews {{over a decade}} later upon being re-released digitally {{and as part of}} Sonic and Sega themed game compilations. IGN gave the Virtual Console version an 8 out of 10, praising the game's graphics, music, and gameplay, and closed with saying [...] "platformer fans would do well to give this one a look." [...] GameSpot praised the Virtual Console release as well, especially its graphics, stating, [...] "Visually, the developers made the best of the system's limited color palette and employed every graphical trick they could to make the game look snazzy. Ristar and his enemies have a good variety of animations, but what you'll probably notice the most are the colorful, multilayered backgrounds that constantly flaunt animated details in the form of moving clouds, falling debris, and rampaging creatures that have a habit of hurling things at <b>you</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> distance." [...] NintendoLife scored it at 9/10 and referred to the game {{as one of the best}} of the system in regards to graphics, animation, and gameplay, stating [...] "Ristar proves that taking a radical approach to play control in a platformer can sometimes really pay off in the end. Not only did Sonic Team create a game that easily differentiates itself from their Sonic the Hedgehog series, they've also come up with some of the most unique game play ideas to come out of the 16-bit era and a game that's every bit as much fun to play today as it was almost 15 years ago when it was first released." [...] 1UP.com referred to the game as [...] "excellent" [...] and referred to it as the [...] "most entertaining" [...] of the four non-Sonic games in Sonic Mega Collection. AllGame echoed the sentiment, referred to it as [...] "being as good if not better than any of the included Sonic games." [...] in Sonic Mega Collection and as [...] "an overlooked gem" [...] as part of Sega Genesis Collection.|$|E
