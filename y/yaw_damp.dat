50|$|A <b>yaw</b> <b>damper</b> is {{a device}} used on many {{aircraft}} (usually jets and turboprops) to damp (reduce) the rolling and yawing oscillations {{known as the}} Dutch roll mode. It consists of yaw-rate sensors and a processor that provides a signal to an actuator connected to the rudder. The use of a <b>yaw</b> <b>damper</b> helps provide a better ride for passengers by preventing the uncomfortable yawing and rolling oscillation. On some aircraft it is mandatory for the <b>yaw</b> <b>damper</b> to be operational at all times during flight above a specified altitude.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two types}} of yaw dampers: series yaw dampers and {{parallel}} yaw dampers. The servo actuator of a parallel <b>yaw</b> <b>damper</b> will actuate the rudder independently of the rudder pedals while the servo actuator of a series <b>yaw</b> <b>damper</b> is clutched to the rudder control quadrant and will result in pedal movement when the system commands the rudder to move.|$|R

50|$|The damping term is {{dominated}} by the product of the roll <b>damping</b> and the <b>yaw</b> <b>damping</b> derivatives, these are both negative, so their product is positive. The Dutch roll should therefore be damped.|$|R
40|$|A piloted similator {{experiment}} {{designed to}} investigate directional axis handling qualities requirements for low-speed and hover tasks {{conducted by a}} scout/attack helicopter is described. Included were the directional characteristics of various candidate light helicopter family (LHX) configurations. The test also focused on conventional single main/tail rotor configurations where the first-order effects {{that contribute to the}} loss of tail rotor control experienced by the OH- 58 series aircraft were modeled. Two types of yaw stability and control augmentation systems were implemented: washed-out yaw rate feedback and shaped control input, and a yaw rate command, heading-hold system. The results of the experiment indicate that rotorcraft configurations with high directional gust sensitivity require more <b>yaw</b> <b>damping</b> to maintain satisfactory handling qualities during nap-of-the-earth (NOE) flying tasks. It was also determined that both <b>yaw</b> <b>damping</b> and control response are critical handling qualities parameters in performing the air-to-air target acquisition and tracking task. The lack of substantial <b>yaw</b> <b>damping</b> and larger values of gust sensitivity increased the possibility of loss of directional control at low airspeeds for the tail rotor configurations...|$|R

Included were the directional characteristics of various candidate light helicopter family configurations. Also, the experiment focused on conventional single main/tail rotor configurations of the OH- 58 series aircraft, where the first-order yaw-axis dynamic effects {{that contributed to the}} loss of tail rotor control were modeled. Five pilots flew 22 configurations under various wind conditions. Cooper-Harper handling quality ratings were used as the primary measure of merit of each configuration. The results of the experiment indicate that rotorcraft configurations with high directional gust sensitivity require greater minimum <b>yaw</b> <b>damping</b> to maintain satisfactory handling qualities during nap-of-the-Earth flying tasks. It was also determined that both <b>yaw</b> <b>damping</b> and control response are critical handling qualities parameters in performing the air-to-air target acquisition and tracking task.

50|$|Yaw dampers usually {{consist of}} a yaw rate sensor (either a {{gyroscope}} or angular accelerometer), a computer/amplifier and a servo actuator. The <b>yaw</b> <b>damper</b> uses <b>yaw</b> rate sensor to sense when the aircraft begins a Dutch roll. A computer processes the signals from the yaw rate sensor to {{determine the amount of}} rudder movement that is required to dampen out the Dutch roll. The computer then commands the servo actuator to move the rudder that amount. The Dutch roll is dampened out and the aircraft becomes stable about the yaw axis. Because Dutch roll is an instability that is inherent to all swept-wing aircraft, most swept-wing aircraft have some sort of <b>yaw</b> <b>damper</b> system installed.|$|R
5|$|Relatively rare amongst fighter aircraft, the RB.199 is {{fitted with}} thrust reversers to {{decrease}} the distance required to safely land. To fully deploy the thrust reverser during landings, the <b>yaw</b> <b>damper</b> {{is connected to the}} steering of the nosewheel to provide greater stability.|$|R
50|$|Many of the {{modifications}} listed above, {{including the}} synchronous traction motors, were tested at speeds over 400 km/h on TGV Sud-Est trainset 88. In one high-speed test, technicians attempted {{to provoke a}} truck into unstable oscillation by drastically reducing the <b>yaw</b> <b>damping,</b> but failed to achieve this.|$|R
50|$|A <b>yaw</b> <b>damper</b> is a {{transverse}} mounted {{shock absorber}} {{used to prevent}} railcars and locomotives from swaying excessively from side to side. Yaw dampers prevent locomotives and passenger railcars from striking station platforms as they roll past them and reduce the gap that must be left between the railroad vehicle and the platform.|$|R
50|$|The second {{lateral motion}} is an oscillatory {{combined}} roll and yaw motion called Dutch roll, {{perhaps because of}} its similarity to an ice-skating motion {{of the same name}} made by Dutch skaters; the origin of the name is unclear. The Dutch roll may be described as a yaw and roll to the right, followed by a recovery towards the equilibrium condition, then an overshooting of this condition and a yaw and roll to the left, then back past the equilibrium attitude, and so on. The period is usually on the order of 3-15 seconds, but it can vary from a few seconds for light aircraft to a minute or more for airliners. Damping is increased by large directional stability and small dihedral and decreased by small directional stability and large dihedral. Although usually stable in a normal aircraft, the motion may be so slightly damped that the effect is very unpleasant and undesirable. In swept-back wing aircraft, the Dutch roll is solved by installing a <b>yaw</b> <b>damper,</b> in effect a special-purpose automatic pilot that <b>damps</b> out any <b>yawing</b> oscillation by applying rudder corrections. Some swept-wing aircraft have an unstable Dutch roll. If the Dutch roll is very lightly damped or unstable, the <b>yaw</b> <b>damper</b> becomes a safety requirement, rather than a pilot and passenger convenience. Dual yaw dampers are required and a failed <b>yaw</b> <b>damper</b> is cause for limiting flight to low altitudes, and possibly lower Mach numbers, where the Dutch roll stability is improved.|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{to evaluate the}} applicability of the Verifiable Integrated Processor for Enhanced Reliability (VIPER) microprocessor to real time control is described. The VIPER microprocessor was invented by the Royal Signals and Radar Establishment (RSRE), U. K., and {{is an example of the}} use of formal mathematical methods for developing electronic digital systems with a high degree of assurance on the system design and implementation correctness. The experiment consisted of selecting a control law, writing the control law algorithm for the VIPER processor, and providing real time, dynamic inputs into the processor and monitoring the outputs. The control law selected and coded for the VIPER processor was the <b>yaw</b> <b>damper</b> function of an automatic landing program for a 737 aircraft. The mechanisms for interfacing the VIPER Single Board Computer to the VAX host are described. Results include run time experiences, performance evaluation, and comparison of VIPER and FORTRAN <b>yaw</b> <b>damper</b> algorithm output for accuracy estimation...|$|R
40|$|Dynamic {{stability}} testing {{was conducted on}} a 2. 5 % scale model of the X- 33 technology demonstrator sub-orbital flight-test vehicle. This testing was conducted at the NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) l 6 -Foot Transonic Wind Tunnel with the LaRC High-speed Dynamic Stability system. Forced oscillation data were acquired for various configurations over a Mach number range of 0. 3 to 1. 15 measuring pitch, roll and <b>yaw</b> <b>damping,</b> {{as well as the}} normal force due to pitch rate and the cross derivatives. The test angle of attack range was from - 2 to 24 degrees, except for those cases where load constraints limited the higher angles of attack at the higher Mach numbers. A variety of model configurations with and without control surfaces were employed, including a body alone configuration. Stable pitch damping is exhibited for the baseline configuration throughout the angle of attack range for Mach numbers 0. 3, 0. 8, and 1. 15. Stable pitch damping is present for Mach numbers 0. 9 and 0. 6 with the exception of angles 2 and 16 degrees, respectively. Constant and stable roll damping were present for the baseline configuration over the range of Mach numbers up to an angle of attack of 16 degrees. The <b>yaw</b> <b>damping</b> for the baseline is somewhat stable and constant for the angle of attack range from - 2 to 8 degrees, with the exception of Mach numbers 0. 6 and 0. 8. <b>Yaw</b> <b>damping</b> becomes highly unstable for all Mach numbers at angles of attack greater than 8 degrees...|$|R

40|$|An {{investigation}} of the lateral stability and control effectiveness of a 0. 0858 -scale model of the Lockheed XF- 104 airplane has been conducted in the Langley 16 -foot transonic tunnel. The model has a low aspect ratio, 3. 4 -percent-thick wing with negative dihedral. The horizontal tail is located {{on top of the}} vertical tail. The investigation was made through a Mach number range of 0. 80 to 1. 06 at sideslip angles of - 5 deg. to 5 deg. and angles of attack from 0 deg. to 16 deg. The control effectiveness of the aileron, rudder, and <b>yaw</b> <b>damper</b> were determined through the Mach number and angle-of-attack range. The results of the investigation indicated that the directional stability derivative was stable and that positive effective dihedral existed throughout the lift-coefficient range and Mach number range tested. The total aileron effectiveness, which in general produced favorable yaw with rolling moment, remained fairly constant for lift coefficients up to about 0. 8 for the Mach number range tested. Yawing-moment effectiveness of the rudder changed little through the Mach number range. However, the <b>yaw</b> <b>damper</b> effectiveness decreased about 30 percent at the intermediate test Mach numbers...|$|R
50|$|At 19:05, {{the crew}} {{disengaged}} the autopilot and the <b>yaw</b> <b>damper.</b> The crew {{then tried to}} locate the runway, unaware that Flight 222 had deviated to the left while still descending. By the time the First Officer and the Captain called for a go-around, the aircraft had an altitude of only 72 ft, hence collision with the ground was inevitable. Flight 222 crash landed in a small forest. The impact caused {{some parts of the}} ATR-72 to detach from its body.|$|R
50|$|Some {{aircraft}} have stability augmentation {{systems that}} will stabilize the aircraft {{in more than}} a single axis. B-52s, for example, require both pitch and yaw SAS in order to provide a stable bombing platform. Many helicopters have pitch, roll and yaw SAS systems.

Rockets at lift-off, however, have practically zero external aerodynamic damping and the jet damping becomes significant.|$|R
500|$|After {{extensive}} {{wind tunnel}} testing, the stabilator was mounted {{at the top}} of the fin for optimum stability and control about the pitch axis. Because the vertical tail fin was only slightly shorter than the length of each wing and nearly as aerodynamically effective, it could act as a wing on rudder application (a phenomenon known as [...] "Dutch roll"). To offset this effect, the wings were angled downward to give 10° anhedral. The rudder was manually operated and supplemented by a small <b>yaw</b> <b>damper</b> surface mounted at the bottom of the fin.|$|R
50|$|A {{stability}} augmentation system (SAS) {{is another}} type of automatic flight control system; however, instead of maintaining the aircraft on a predetermined attitude or flight path, the SAS will actuate the aircraft flight controls to dampen out aircraft buffeting regardless of the attitude or flight path. SAS can automatically stabilize the aircraft {{in one or more}} axes. The most common type of SAS is the <b>yaw</b> <b>damper</b> which is used to eliminate the Dutch roll tendency of swept-wing aircraft.
