500|$|Kristen Bell {{was chosen}} to portray Veronica Mars from more than 500 women who auditioned for the role. On casting the lead role, Thomas later commented, [...] "When you're casting 20-year-old hot girl, <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> bad actors." [...] Bell {{felt that it was}} [...] "just luck" [...] that Rob Thomas saw that [...] "I have some sass to me, and that's exactly what he wanted". Bell thought that it was her {{cheerleader}} looks and an outsider's attitude that set her apart from the other women who auditioned. Bell's life shared many similarities with that of her character—her father had [...] "an investigative bent", and her best friend died in high school in a car crash.|$|E
500|$|Graham {{became the}} Browns' uncontested leader, {{but he was}} also [...] "just one of the guys", tackle Mike McCormack said in 1999. [...] "He was not aloof, which <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> times today." [...] He was good at {{spinning}} and moving in the pocket, skills he learned playing basketball. In his autobiography, Paul Brown praised Graham's ability to anticipate his receivers' route-running by watching their shoulders. [...] "I remember his tremendous peripheral vision and his great athletic skill, as well as his ability to throw a football far and accurately with just a flick of his arm", Brown said. His short passes were hard and accurate, teammates later said, and his long balls were soft. [...] "I used to catch a lot of them one-handed", Lavelli said. [...] "He had great touch in his hands." [...] He was nicknamed [...] "Automatic Otto" [...] for his consistency and toughness.|$|E
500|$|R {{singer and}} friend Brandy {{said about the}} late singer [...] "She came out before Monica and I did, she was our inspiration. At the time, record {{companies}} {{did not believe in}} kid acts and it was just inspiring to see someone that was winning and winning being themselves. When I met her I embraced her, I was so happy to meet her." [...] Rapper Drake said that the singer has had the biggest influence on his career. He also has a tattoo of the singer on his back. Solange Knowles remarked on the tenth anniversary of her death that she idolized Aaliyah and proclaimed that she would never be forgotten. Adam Levine, the lead vocalist of the pop rock group Maroon 5, remembers that listening to [...] "Are You That Somebody?" [...] convinced him to pursue a more soulful sound than that of his then-band Kara's Flowers. Erika Ramirez, associate editor of Billboard.com, said at the time of Aaliyah's career [...] "there weren't many artists using the kind of soft vocals the ways she was using it, and now <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> artists doing that and finding success," [...] her reasoning for Aaliyah's continued influence on current artists. She argued that Aaliyah's second album One in a Million was [...] "very much ahead of its time, with the bass and electro kind of R sounds that they produced", referring to collaborators Timbaland and Missy Elliott and that the sound, which [...] "really stood out" [...] at its time, was being replicated.|$|E
6000|$|... "I always {{understand}} you well enough till {{you begin to}} explain," [...] he rejoined, with a candid, even if embarrassed, laugh. [...] "Then, by Jove, I 'm quite in the woods. <b>You</b> <b>see</b> such <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> more in things than most people. Does n't she, Miss Vivian?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Heidnik's defense attorney, A. Charles [...] "Chuck" [...] Peruto Jr., told Philadelphia magazine: [...] "Eventually Gary’s story wound its {{way into}} Silence of the Lambs. If you watch that movie, <b>you</b> can <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of Heidnik in the Buffalo Bill character. The way he has {{the girl in the}} pit." ...|$|R
5000|$|On canal bridge, {{there are}} two Banyan tree {{on either side of}} road. During summer <b>you</b> can <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of people enjoying cooler shade of these trees and {{drinking}} sweet water from water hand pumps next to these trees.

2500|$|Ed Helms, Zach Galifianakis, and Bradley Cooper {{were all}} casual acquaintances before The Hangover was filmed, which Helms said he {{believed}} helped in establishing a rapport and chemistry amongst their characters. Helms credited Phillips for [...] "bringing together three guys who are really different, but really appreciate each others' humor and sensibilities". Helms also said {{the fact that the}} story of the three characters growing closer and bonding informed the friendship between the three actors: [...] "As you spend 14hours a day together for three months, <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> sides of somebody. We went through the wringer together, and that shared experience really made us genuine buddies." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "North by North Quahog", which premiered May 1, 2005, was {{the first}} episode to be {{broadcast}} after the show's hiatus. It was written by MacFarlane and directed by Peter Shin. MacFarlane believed the show's three-year hiatus was beneficial because animated shows do not normally have hiatuses, and {{towards the end of}} their seasons, [...] "... <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> more sex jokes and bodily function jokes and signs of a fatigued staff that their brains are just fried". With [...] "North by North Quahog", the writing staff tried to keep the show [...] "... exactly as it was" [...] before its cancellation, and [...] "None of us had any desire to make it look any slicker". The episode was watched by 11.85 million viewers, the show's highest ratings since the airing of the first season episode [...] "Brian: Portrait of a Dog".|$|R
5000|$|I {{remembered the}} saying that <b>you</b> <b>see</b> on <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of old plates and mugs: 'Industry {{produces}} wealth, God speed the plow.' This, I knew, was {{a play about}} work and {{about the end of}} the world, so 'Speed-the-Plow' was perfect because not only did it mean work, it meant having to plow under and start over again.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] Mr. Blount said, {{examining}} them, {{and pulling}} out a brand that was still glowing. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>see,</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> sand has been thrown over it. Whoever was here must have seen us coming, and tried to extinguish the fire when they caught sight of us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You never did!" [...] exclaimed Sadie admiringly. [...] "Well, ain't you {{the lucky}} one? Piggy's an awful swell; {{and he always}} takes a girl to swell places. He took Blanche up to the Hoffman House one evening, where they have swell music, and <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> swells. You'll have a swell time, Dulce." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I don't know," [...] he replied. [...] "The old man {{was very}} anxious I should find out. <b>You</b> <b>see,</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> {{information}} seems to have got over on the other side, and we couldn't think where it had leaked out, except through your wireless. However, that isn't likely, of course, unless you've got one of these beastly Germans in your receiving-room. Now if I can borrow a cigarette, a cigar, or a pipe of tobacco--any mortal thing to smoke--I'll be off, if I may. The old man turned me out at an unearthly hour this morning, and in Sheringham all the shops were closed. Steady on, young fellow," [...] he laughed, as Gerald filled his pockets with cigarettes. [...] "Well, here's good morning to you, Miss Fentolin. Good morning, sir. How long ought it {{to take me to}} get to Sheringham?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "'Why, {{the usual}} way,' says Denver, surprised. 'We'll get the orators {{on our side}} out every night to make speeches in the native lingo, and have torch-light parades {{under the shade of}} the palms, and free drinks, and buy up all the brass bands, of course, and--well, I'll turn the baby-kissing over to <b>you,</b> Sully--I've <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of 'em.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{worry about}} me," [...] replied Sammy [...] "I {{know just how}} far those terrible guns can shoot, and I don't take any chances. By the way, Lightfoot, the Green Forest is full of hunters looking for <b>you.</b> I've <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of them, and I know {{they are looking for}} you because they do not shoot at anybody else even when they have a chance." ...|$|R

Walter Murphy, who had composed music for the show before its cancellation, returned to compose the music for [...] "North by North Quahog".

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Gay Times, Otto said, [...] "When I signed up I had an inkling because I knew it was reliant on intense characters and drama. By season three, once Maxine gets completely accepted, she aligns herself with Bea and we see a whole new side of her personality. She becomes sassy, confident and strong, and later <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> the comedy coming out between Maxine and Boomer. I think Maxine recognised herself in Boomer; the little lost person who just wants to be loved and {{is not part of}} the norm." ...|$|E

5000|$|I {{worry that}} the {{marionette}} is not the puppet of choice any more - <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> hand puppets in the West End shows but marionettes take time to learn the craft. Why would people spend the time training {{when there are no}} jobs and no money? I don't earn enough to pay tax and I only go home to sleep, I work the rest of the time. But I'm one of the lucky ones; if you've got some way of being creative then it's the most satisfying thing in life. I get the same thrill out of this as I got when I was a kid playing with toys.|$|E

5000|$|... "At {{the time}} of the film, it was before the genre really picked up so I didn’t give it a lot of credit or take it seriously. For me, it was just another {{audition}} because I had no idea what it would end up meaning after all this time. When I played Ginny, I was really young and different from {{a lot of the people}} working at the time so that came out in my character. I was naturally suspicious of cocky guys at that age, and <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> that when I’m on screen with Paul (John Furey). I tried to put so much behind the actual words in the script just so she felt almost unreachable, to Paul and to audiences. I wanted her to have some power." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Ofo" [...] {{refers to}} a {{particular}} type of staff (as well as the wood from which it's made) that is carried by elder men - notably patrilineage priests and some masqueraders. Christopher Ejizu, in his invaluable but very arcane book, Ofo: Igbo Ritual Symbol (Enugu: Fourth Dimension 1986), tells us that there is an ofo masquerade group in the Nnewi area called the Ofo-Anunu-Ebe and later associates that ofo group with the practice of [...] "sending" [...] the spirit of ofo out against miscreants. ... I believe that ofo can generally be inherited through the paternal line, and that it is also associated with the work of some healer-diviners (ndi dibia) in divination (afa). This is complicated ritual practice, and <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> variation -as with most Igbo ritual - from town to town (30 Nov. 2002).|$|E
6000|$|... "Ow," [...] he said; [...] "ye'es! From {{a little}} thing, we {{thought she had}} stuff in her. I've come to take a great {{interest}} in her work. It's not in my line, but I think she's a sticker; I like to see perseverance. Where you've got that, you've got half the battle of success.

5000|$|Although her sculptures are strikingly lifelike, Xiang {{says she}} isn't aiming for realism.

[...] "I want my art to awaken the {{sensibility}} of each onlooker, to awaken his body, so that his body can experience the sculpture.

6000|$|... "The {{fact that}} we are {{remaining}} out here is enough to show that we are doing something, anyhow. The men who go in are always strictly ordered to say no word about what our luck is, but the mere fact that they hold their tongues--and you may be sure they are questioned sharply--is enough to excite curiosity, and these men have come to find out and see what the country is like, and to prospect the hills round where we are working. <b>You</b> will <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of them here before long." ...|$|R
