500|$|Keenan and Jones {{met through}} {{a mutual friend}} in 1989. After Keenan played a tape {{recording}} for Jones of his previous band project, Jones was so impressed by his voice that he eventually talked his friend into forming their own band. They started jamming together and were {{on the lookout for}} a drummer and a bass player. Carey happened to live above Keenan and was introduced to Jones by Tom Morello, an old high school friend of Jones and former member of Electric Sheep. Carey began playing in their sessions because he [...] "felt kinda sorry for them," [...] as other invited musicians were not showing up. Tool's lineup was completed when a friend of Jones introduced them to bassist D'Amour. Early on, the band fabricated the story that they formed because of the pseudophilosophy [...] "lachrymology". Although [...] "lachrymology" [...] was also cited as an inspiration for the band's name, Keenan later explained their intentions differently: [...] "Tool is exactly what it sounds like: It's a big dick. It's a wrench. ... we are ... your tool; use us as a catalyst in your process of finding out whatever it is <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> out, or whatever it is you're trying to achieve." ...|$|E

5000|$|Next, {{in order}} <b>to</b> <b>find</b> the {{outstanding}} loan balance <b>you</b> will <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> {{the present value}} of the remaining payments. Use the monthly payment of $775.30 as the payment function, the term will be 156 ((20-7)x12), and [...]583333% as the rate. This will give you an outstanding loan balance of $79,268.02.

First looking for errors, then for factors the estimation didn't take account of - Does Chicago have a number of music schools or other places with a disproportionately high ratio of pianos to people?

50|$|To {{determine}} {{whether you should}} add insulation, <b>you</b> first <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> out how much insulation you already have in your home and where. A qualified home energy auditor will include an insulation check as a routine part of a whole-house energy audit.

Simply append 25 to the root and compare that to the remainder; if it is {{less than or equal to}} the remainder, then the next digit will be at least five and round up is needed.

Noriaka Okimura, the person who designed Doctor Lautrec, stated that, while inspired by Layton, {{it was not his}} intention to make the two look alike; he felt it would be awkward for a 19th-century gentleman to not be wearing a hat like Laytons. Kyle Gray, creator of Henry Hatsworth, was more aggressive, stating that Henry Hatsworth is the man youd call to [...] "save the world from an impending collision with an alternate dimension", while Professor Layton is the sort of person to call [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>need</b> someone <b>to</b> <b>find</b> your missing cat.".|$|R

40|$|Thank you {{for taking}} time to read through the Dorothy H. Hoover Library Research Handbook. We hope that it will help you to start {{learning}} more about “information literacy. ” Researching in an academic environment can be intimidating; there are so many conflicting pressures, concerns, and questions that seem to arise throughout the process. But don’t worry; these anxieties are, in fact, a critically important feature of research. Studies show that researchers that feel pressure, concern, and are plagued by questions {{in the early stages of}} researching are the ones that end up discovering the most compelling results at the end of their research journey! An important factor to success, however, is the skill of taking control over that anxiety and being able to move forward and <b>find</b> the information <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> complete a research task, whether it’s building an argument for an academic essay, analyzing a case-study, engaging with design thinking in order to problem-solve, or creating a meaningful work of art. In the library, we call this skill set information literacy, which is simply a set of strategies that you can use to expertly navigate through our complex information environment. Information literacy helps you understanding what information <b>you</b> <b>need,</b> how <b>to</b> <b>find</b> it, and, most importantly, why this information is important. This entire process—from beginning to end—is all part of turning the “raw materials” of information into the “finished product” of knowledge. By comparing academic research to the creative process, we hope that you will begin seeing commonalities between both and use your experiences in studio-based art or design thinking to empower your academic research. Artists and designers have amazing strategies for working through creative blocks when making art, so why not use these talents to get “un-stuck” when researching? Sincerely, The Dorothy H. Hoover Librarian...|$|R
5000|$|As a youth, Caruana had an {{aggressive}} style of play. In his own words, [...] "I preferred to attack {{all the time}} and really loved sacrificing pieces to get at the enemy king. I played like that for quite a long time, but when I moved up it turned out that you can far from always win with a direct attack... I had to become universal, to learn to manoeuvre and defend and so on." [...] Caruana's playing style is now universal, based on excellent opening preparation and good calculation: [...] "I wouldn't assess it in such categories or strategic. It seems to me I'm a good fighter. I enjoy playing different types of position, both tactical and strategic. I can't say there's anything I avoid. I can attack on a board full of pieces or manoeuvre in a roughly even position, and I've got nothing against the endgame". Caruana is known as a hard working player, once saying: [...] "Hundreds of games are played each day all around the world, {{and a lot of them}} are important. They're all available online, but you have to put in the time to look at them all. And <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> analyze, <b>find</b> new trends, keep trying <b>to</b> <b>find</b> new ideas <b>to</b> use against specific opponents". Talking about Magnus Carlsen's play, Caruana hinted at his deep knowledge of opponent's strengths and weaknesses: [...] "In some positions you can't compete with him. Certain pawn structures he just plays like a machine. There are certain openings where I say, ‘I just can't do that.’ But OK, certain positions he's not as comfortable with. Just like any player, he can also play unconfidently." ...|$|R
