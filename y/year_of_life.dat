In more primitive, long-tailed pterosaurs ("rhamphorhynchoids"), such as Rhamphorhynchus, the average growth rate {{during the first}} <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> was 130% to 173%, slightly faster than {{the growth rate of}} alligators.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to explore the {{characteristics}} of digestive organ cancer mortality and the potential <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> lost in Inner Mongolia, and to provide evidence for the prevention of digestive organ cancers. Methods: Using data from the Death Registry System from 2009 to 2012, we classified male and female cancer deaths according to the International Classification of Disease (10 th revision). The mortality and potential <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> lost were calculated for digestive organ cancers in Inner Mongolia. The average <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> lost was calculated. Results: Digestive organ cancer mortality in Inner Mongolia was higher in men than in women. The potential <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> lost were also much higher in men than in women. Gallbladder cancer, pancreatic cancer, and colorectal, anus, and anal canal cancer were the most prominent contributors to mortality. Esophageal cancer was the most prominent contributor to potential <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> lost, and was the leading cause <b>of</b> average <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> lost in both sexes. Conclusion: Liver cancer and stomach cancer mortality and the potential <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> lost to liver and stomach cancer are demonstrably higher in Inner Mongolia. Although esophageal cancer mortality was not the highest of the digestive organ cancers, the average <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> lost to esophageal was the highest for both sexes, and it should therefore be targeted for prevention...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to calculate average <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> lost due to breast and cervical cancer in Mexico in 2000 and 2010.

40|$|Temperature is an {{important}} determinant of health. A better knowledge of how temperature affects population health is important {{not only to the}} scientific community, but also to the decision-makers who develop and implement early warning systems and intervention strategies to mitigate the health effects of extreme temperatures. The temperature–health relationship is also of growing interest as climate change is projected to shift the overall temperature distribution higher. Previous studies have examined the relative risks of temperature-related mortality, but the absolute measure <b>of</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> lost is also useful as it combines the number <b>of</b> deaths with <b>life</b> expectancy.

40|$|Background: Extreme {{temperatures}} {{are associated with}} cardiovascular disease (CVD) deaths. Previous studies have investigated the relative CVD mortality risk of temperature, but this risk is heavily influenced by deaths in frail elderly persons. To better estimate the burden of extreme temperatures we estimated their effects on <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> lost due to CVD. Methods and Results: The data were daily observations on weather and CVD mortality for Brisbane, Australia between 1996 and 2004. We estimated the association between daily mean temperature and <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> lost due to CVD, after adjusting for trend, season, day of the week, and humidity. To examine the non-linear and delayed effects of temperature, a distributed lag non-linear model was used. The model’s residuals were examined to investigate {{if there were any}} added effects due to cold spells and heat waves. The exposure-response curve between temperature and <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> lost was U-shaped, with the lowest <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> lost at 24 °C. The curve had a sharper rise at extremes of heat than of cold. The effect of cold peaked two days after exposure, whereas the greatest effect of heat occurred on the day of exposure. There were significantly added effects of heat waves on <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> lost. Conclusions: Increased <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> lost due to CVD are associated with both cold and hot temperatures. Research on specific interventions is needed to reduce temperature-related <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> lost from CVD deaths. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} a new {{approach}} for calculation <b>of</b> the <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> lost per excess death due to stochastic health effects is applied to external exposure pathways. The short-term external exposures are due {{to the passage of}} radioactive cloud and due to the skin and clothes contamination. The long-term external exposure is the one from the radioactive material deposited on the ground (groundshine). Three nuclides, 131 I, 137 Cs, and 239 Pu, and with the extremely wide range of half-life are considered in order to examine their possible influence on the calculated values <b>of</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> lost. For each of these nuclides, the number <b>of</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> lost has been found as a decreasing function of the age at the expo sure and presented graphically in this paper. For protracted exposures, the fully averaged number <b>of</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> lost is negative correlated with the nuclide’s half-life. On the other hand, the short-term external exposures do not depend on the nuclide’s half-life. In addition, a weak <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> lost dependence <b>of</b> the dose has been commented...|$|R
5|$|A UTI affects {{parts of}} the urinary system {{including}} the urethra, bladder, and kidneys. There is about a one percent risk of UTIs in boys under two years of age, {{and the majority of}} incidents occur in the first <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> There is good but not ideal evidence that circumcision of babies reduces the incidence of UTIs in boys under two years of age, and there is fair evidence that the reduction in incidence is by a factor of 310 times (100 circumcisions prevents one UTI). Prevention of UTIs does not justify routine use of the procedure, however. Circumcision is most likely to benefit boys who have a high risk of UTIs due to anatomical defects, and may be used to treat recurrent UTIs.|$|E

5|$|About a {{third to}} a half of {{individuals}} with autism do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs.

Children with autism are less likely to make requests or share experiences, {{and are more likely to}} simply repeat others' words (echolalia) or reverse pronouns. Joint attention seems to be necessary for functional speech, and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with ASD: for example, they may look at a pointing hand instead of the pointed-at object, and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience. Children with autism may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} species of fish, the timing of {{spawning}} varies over {{the range of the}} species, with gonad development indicating that spawning in the southern New South Wales region occurs from December to April, while spawning in southern Queensland occurs from September to February. Spawning takes place twice a year, evident by the two classes of egg size found in the ovaries and by the two recruitment pulses observed each year as young fish enter their juvenile habitats. The spawning takes place at the mouths of estuaries or in surf zones, with the larvae occurring in fully marine waters. Juveniles reach 16.5cm in length after their first <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> 26.7cm after their second year and 30.5cm after their third year. After the beginning of the spawning season young whiting of 10mm and over can be observed swimming actively in small droves of from 10 to 20 on the sand flats and beaches to which they are recruited, moving up and down with the tide, swimming in very shallow water to depths of 1m. Unlike closely related sillaginids, the juveniles usually prefer unprotected sand substrates, while other species tend to use seagrass and mangroves as protection. As they grow older they keep further from the shore.|$|E

40|$|Excess <b>Years</b> <b>of</b> <b>Life</b> Lost due to {{exposure}} {{is an important}} measure of health impact complementary to rate or risk statistics. I show that the total excess <b>Years</b> <b>of</b> <b>Life</b> Lost due to exposure can be estimated unbiasedly by calculating the corresponding excess <b>Years</b> <b>of</b> Potential <b>Life</b> Lost given conditions that describe study validity (like exchangeability of exposed and unexposed) and assuming that {{exposure is}} never preventive. I further demonstrate that the excess <b>Years</b> <b>of</b> <b>Life</b> Lost conditional on age at death cannot be estimated unbiasedly by a calculation <b>of</b> conditional excess <b>Years</b> <b>of</b> Potential <b>Life</b> Lost without adopting speculative causal models that cannot be tested empirically. Furthermore, I point out by example that the excess <b>Years</b> <b>of</b> <b>Life</b> Lost for a specific cause of death, like lung cancer, cannot be identified from epidemiologic data without assuming non-testable assumptions about the causal mechanism as to how exposure produces death. Hence, excess <b>Years</b> <b>of</b> <b>Life</b> Lost estimated from life tables or regression models, as presented by some authors for lung cancer or after stratification for age, are potentially biased. These points were already made by Robins and Greenland 1991 reasoning on an abstract level. In addition, I demonstrate by adequate life table examples designed to critically discuss the <b>Years</b> <b>of</b> Potential <b>Life</b> Lost analysis published by Park et al. 2002 that the potential biases involved may be fairly extreme. Although statistics conveying information about the advancement of disease onset are helpful in exposure impact analysis and especially worthwhile in exposure impact communication, I believe that attention should be drawn to the difficulties involved and that epidemiologists should always be aware of these conceptual limits <b>of</b> the <b>Years</b> <b>of</b> Potential <b>Life</b> Lost method when applying it as a regular tool in cohort analysis...|$|R
5|$|Despite the {{maternal}} care they receive, hatchlings commonly fall to predation. While the female is transporting some {{to the nursery}} area, others are picked off by predators that lurk near the nest. The hatchlings {{are a source of}} food for most of the creatures that feed on eggs, and are also subject to aquatic attacks by turtles, fish, and snakes. Birds of prey take their toll, and in any clutch there may be malformed individuals that are unlikely to survive. In northern Australia, the survival rate for saltwater crocodile hatchlings is only twenty-five percent, but with each succeeding <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> this improves, reaching sixty percent by year five. Mortality rates are fairly low among subadults and adults, though they are occasionally preyed on by large cats and snakes. The jaguar and the giant otter may prey on caimans in South America. In other parts of the world, elephants and hippopotamuses may kill crocodiles defensively. Authorities differ as to whether much cannibalism takes place among crocodilians. Adults do not normally eat their own offspring, but there is some evidence of subadults feeding on juveniles and of adults attacking subadults. In Nile crocodiles, rival males sometimes kill each other during the breeding season.|$|E
5|$|The female {{song thrush}} builds a neat {{cup-shaped}} nest lined with mud and dry grass in a bush, tree or creeper, or, {{in the case}} of the Hebridean subspecies, on the ground.

The female incubates the eggs alone for 10–17days, and after hatching a similar time elapses until the young fledge.
