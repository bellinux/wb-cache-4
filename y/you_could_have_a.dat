500|$|Andrew Goodlife, a {{professor}} of geological sciences at the University of Alabama, believes the state is at [...] "high" [...] risk from earthquakes. He claims that [...] "If there is an earthquake {{in one of the}} zone areas, North Alabama is certainly going to feel it. There's going to be damage and some perhaps major. If one occurred in the zone close to Memphis, it would be devastating because buildings are not made to withstand earthquakes. Places like San Francisco are aware of earthquake risks and structures are built to withstand them." [...] By his definition, the state's earthquakes are [...] "insignificant". Emergency planner Bill Thomison feels skeptical about a major earthquake, stating, [...] "I don't believe there are any major faults (interface of rocks) here. It depends on the magnitude of the earthquake and the Richter scale. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> No. 4 (magnitude) earthquake in California and not damage anything, but the same type in New York could be devastating because the building codes don't factor in earthquakes." ...|$|E
500|$|In Game 6 of the series, the Express led by {{four points}} {{by the end}} of the first quarter, but the Rainmen responded with a 21–9 run and led by 12 points at halftime. Windsor, however, entered the fourth quarter with a score of 85–85 after {{dominating}} the third. In the third quarter, they shot 21 free throws. The Express kept it close in the final minutes of the game and held Halifax off to win the contest, 119–112, forcing a decisive Game 7. Quinnel Brown led the way for Windsor with 30 points, 16 of them off free throws. After the game, Rainmen head coach Josep Clarós expressed his unhappiness with the calls made by the referees against his team. Clarós said that rather than protesting to the league, he would [...] "send film to FIBA." [...] He commented on the officiating, [...] "It's ridiculous for a final of a professional league in Canada." [...] An anonymous referee later denounced the league's policy regarding player fines and suspensions. He said, [...] "So <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> guy punch a guy in the face in Game 1, get kicked out, and be playing in Game 2." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ash {{has changed}} in the 30 years since Army of Darkness. In an {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, Campbell stated, [...] "Ash has survivor's guilt. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> heyday with his PTSD. He's a war vet. He doesn't want to talk about it, and he'll lie about that stump on his hand to impress the ladies. This is a guy who's got some issues. He's emotionally stunted. But, he's the guy you want in the foxhole next to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|The colonel {{turned his}} back on him hastily. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> heard <b>a</b> pin drop. [...] "This is some silly woman story--is it not?" ...|$|R

6000|$|A {{moment of}} silence ensued, of silence so {{profound}} that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> heard <b>a</b> pin drop on the deck. Then Ransome's unperturbed voice uttered pleasantly the words: ...|$|R
2500|$|... "All Eyez on Me" [...] {{was one of}} {{the first}} songs Monica, Rodney Jerkins, and his Darkchild crew worked on in the Patchwerk {{recording}} studios in Atlanta, Georgia, and is one out of nine songs the singer wrote or co-wrote for the album. Monica has described the track as a [...] "party record" [...] and [...] "a feel-good song for the summer," [...] stylistically comparing it with Michael Jackson's 1983 hit single [...] "P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)", which the song partially samples. [...] "The same way that 'P.Y.T.' was, I was hoping 'All Eyez on Me' would be - more relaxing and <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> good time. It's not based on anything emotional or anything sad." [...] Jackson hand-delivered the original masters of the song for the production.|$|E
2500|$|The show {{began with}} all the wrestlers, managers, referees and agents of the WWF (except WWF Champion The Undertaker and Kane) {{standing}} on the entrance ramp. [...] Howard Finkel called for a ten-bell salute. Hart's former Nation of Domination comrades were emotional, most notably Mark Henry, who wept as he read a poem that he wrote in memory of Hart. A tribute video narrated by Vince McMahon then played on the Titan Tron. Throughout the broadcast, personal thoughts on Hart {{in the form of}} shoot interviews with various WWF Superstars were played. Before the first commercial break, such thoughts were aired from Mick Foley and Bradshaw. Foley noted that Hart was his son's favorite wrestler and had proudly gotten a haircut like Owen's, although he also said his son did not quite understand that [...] "nugget" [...] was not a term of endearment. Bradshaw talked about how Hart spent less money on the road than most wrestlers because he wanted to retire early and spend time with his family. Owen's friend and Nation of Domination partner The Rock also made a short speech before engaging in a short match against Val Venis. Test then spoke about a rib Owen pulled on him. [...] The broadcast ended with Stone Cold Steve Austin coming out for a special salute to Hart by climbing the turnbuckle and performing his famous [...] "beer-bash" [...] routine, ending with him giving a toast to Owen (whose picture was displayed on the TitanTron throughout the entire show) and leaving one beer in the ring (for Owen). The only notable absence from this show was The Undertaker as he decided to visit his real-life friend, Bret Hart. The tribute show scored a 7.2 Nielsen rating, making it the highest-rated special episode [...] in Raw history and the third highest-rated show overall. Shawn Michaels, in his Heartbreak and Triumph autobiography, notes that [...] "Owen is the only guy <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> two-hour show for, and no-one would say a bad word about him." [...] The next day, WWF taped the episode of Raw for May 31, 1999. During that show, Jeff Jarrett defeated The Godfather to win the WWF Intercontinental Championship, the title Hart was booked to win for a third time at Over the Edge. Jarrett screamed Hart's name as the belt was handed to him.|$|E

60|$|They had Henry Mullins, the manager, on {{the stand}} {{for an hour and}} a half, and the {{excitement}} was so breathless that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> heard <b>a</b> pin drop. Nivens took him on first.|$|R

2500|$|Following the {{unveiling}} of the plan, critics were quick to remark on the negative consequences for the economy that budget changes of the magnitude being proposed <b>could</b> <b>have</b> in the short term. Kevin Hassett, economic policy director of the American Enterprise Institute and chief economic adviser to John McCain's 2000 presidential campaign, praised Paul's aim of reducing {{the size of government}} but worried that, [...] "At the scale he's talking about, it's unlikely <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> immediate reduction in government without hurtling the economy into recession." [...] Economist Dean Baker, of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, said that [...] "This is almost having the economy fall off a cliff." ...|$|R
