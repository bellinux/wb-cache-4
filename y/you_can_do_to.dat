500|$|Host–parasite {{coevolution}} is the coevolution of a {{host and}} a parasite. A general characterization of many viruses, obligate parasites, is that they coevolved alongside their respective hosts. Correlated mutations between the two species enter them into an evolution arms race. Whichever organism, host or parasite, that cannot {{keep up with the}} other will be eliminated from their habitat, as the species with the higher average population fitness survives. This race is known as the Red Queen hypothesis. The Red Queen hypothesis predicts that sexual reproduction allows a host to stay just ahead of its parasite, similar to the Red Queen's race in Through the Looking-Glass: [...] "it takes all the running <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do,</b> <b>to</b> keep in the same place". The host reproduces sexually, producing some offspring with immunity over its parasite, which then evolves in response.|$|E

In 2013, the Jets' new quarterbacks coach, David Lee, instituted a program {{to cut down on}} the fumbles by {{teaching}} Sanchez to hold the ball with both hands. In what Lee calls [...] "The Sanchez Drill," [...] the quarterback runs a gauntlet of people trying to knock the ball out of his hands with foam bats. Lee explained to the press, [...] "Mark can win in this league. He has proven that. He’s played for championships. I'm blatantly honest, brutally truthful at times.

2500|$|Pentangle {{are often}} characterised as a folk-rock band. Danny Thompson {{preferred}} {{to describe the}} group as a [...] "folk-jazz band."

When we worked on those in the group, Terry Cox worked out his percussion patterns to match the patterns in the songs exactly. In that respect he was the opposite of a folk-rock drummer." [...] This approach to songs led to the use of unusual time signatures: [...] "Market Song" [...] from Sweet Child moves from 7/4 to 11/4 and 4/4 time, and [...] "Light Flight" [...] from Basket of Light includes sections in 5/8, 7/8 and 6/4.|$|E

2500|$|Beginning on November 14, 1965, Lt. Col. Moore led the 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry of the 3rd Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile) in the week-long Battle of Ia Drang. Encircled by enemy {{soldiers}} {{with no clear}} landing zone {{that would allow them}} to leave, Moore managed to persevere despite being significantly outnumbered by North Vietnamese Army (NVA) forces that would go on to defeat the 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry only two-and-a-half miles away the next day. Moore's dictum that [...] "there is always one more thing <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> increase your odds of success" [...] and the courage of his entire command are credited [...] with this outcome. Blond haired Moore was known as [...] "Yellow Hair" [...] to his troops at the battle at Ia Drang, and as a tongue-in-cheek homage referencing the legendary General George Armstrong Custer, who commanded as a lieutenant colonel the same 7th Cavalry Regiment at the Battle of the Little Bighorn just under a century before. Moore was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for extraordinary heroism at Ia Drang. After the Battle of the Ia Drang Valley, Moore was promoted to colonel and took over the command of the Garry Owen (3rd) Brigade.|$|E
2500|$|However while a 1988 {{article by}} Brian Martin in Science and Public Policy states that {{although}} Nuclear Winter Reappraised concluded the US-Soviet [...] "nuclear winter" [...] {{would be much}} less severe than originally thought, with the authors describing the effects more as a [...] "nuclear autumn", other statements by Thompson and Schneider show that they [...] "resisted the interpretation that this means {{a rejection of the}} basic points made about nuclear winter". In the Alan Robock et al. 2007 paper they write that [...] "because of {{the use of the term}} 'nuclear autumn' by Thompson and Schneider , even though the authors made clear that the climatic consequences would be large, in policy circles the theory of nuclear winter is considered by some to have been exaggerated and disproved [...]" [...] In 2007 Schneider expressed his tentative support for the cooling results of the limited nuclear war (Pakistan and India) analyzed in the 2006 model, saying [...] "The sun is much stronger in the tropics than it is in mid-latitudes.
