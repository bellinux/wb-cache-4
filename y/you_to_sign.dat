[...] Thereupon Mr Apjohn rang the bell, and asked Mrs Griffith to bring him paper and ink. With these he wrote a letter addressed to himself, which he invited Cousin Henry to sign as soon as he had read it aloud to him and to Mr Brodrick. The letter contained simply the two admissions above stated, and then went on to authorise Mr Apjohn, as the writer's attorney, to withdraw the indictment against the proprietor of the Carmarthen Herald, [...] "in consequence," [...] as the letter said, [...] "of the question as to the possession of Llanfeare having been settled now in an unexpected manner." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{warn you}} that if you attempt to {{repudiate}} your responsibility, I shall suspect you of finding the play too decorous for your taste. The fifteen years have made me older and graver. In you I can detect no such becoming change. Your levities and audacities are like the loves and comforts prayed for by Desdemona: they increase, even as your days do grow. No mere pioneering journal dares meddle with them now: the stately Times itself is alone sufficiently above suspicion to act as your chaperone; and even the Times must sometimes thank its stars that new plays are not produced every day, since after each such event its gravity is compromised, its platitude turned to epigram, its portentousness to wit, its propriety to elegance, and even its decorum into naughtiness by criticisms which the traditions of the paper do not allow <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> at the end, but which you take care to sign with the most extravagant flourishes between the lines. I am not sure {{that this is not a}} portent of Revolution. In eighteenth century France the end was at hand when men bought the Encyclopedia and found Diderot there. When I buy the Times and find you there, my prophetic ear catches a rattle of twentieth century tumbrils.|$|E

You may take it from me that I feel I have been greatly benefited by what has taken place, and that I have reason to bless the {{necessity}} that fell upon me for working for my living. I was spending a very useless and indolent life, and had nothing occurred to rouse me, should probably have led it to the end. Now I have worked hard for two years, and my masters tell me that I have every prospect of rising to eminence as an artist. There will be no occasion for me to rely upon that as a profession now, but the good the necessity for work has done me will remain, and at any rate I shall continue to work at it until this mortgage is paid off. It has in another way brought happiness into my life. Therefore, on my account at least, you need not regret what has happened. I should say nothing at present as to your intention of leaving here. Possibly we may hit upon some reason for your doing so that will be accepted as a natural one. I can assure you I am as anxious as you are yourself, indeed more so, that no shadow of suspicion of anything wrong should rest upon you. So do not worry yourself about it. You can safely leave it in my hands. Now I will say good-bye. I hope that when I return I shall find you stronger and better. I do not know that there is any occasion for <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> this paper I have brought." ...|$|E

6000|$|Nor in jokes at {{the expense}} of policemen is the fun entirely on your side. Maybe I did not proceed with judgment. It occurs to me now, looking back, that the neighbourhoods of Covent Garden and Great Marlborough Street were ill-chosen for sport of this nature. To bonnet a fat {{policeman}} is excellent fooling. While he is struggling with his helmet you can ask him comic questions, {{and by the time he}} has got his head free you are out of sight. But the game should be played in a district where there is not an average of three constables to every dozen square yards. When two other policemen, who have had their eye on you for the past ten minutes, are watching the proceedings from just round the next corner, you have little or no leisure for due enjoyment of the situation. By the time you have run the whole length of Great Titchfield Street and twice round Oxford Market, you are of opinion that a joke should never be prolonged beyond the point at which there is danger of its becoming wearisome; and that the time has now arrived for home and friends. The [...] "Law," [...] on the other hand, now raised by reinforcements to a strength of six or seven men, is just beginning to enjoy the chase. You picture to yourself, while doing Hanover Square, the scene in Court the next morning. You will be accused of being drunk and disorderly. It will be idle for you to explain to the magistrate (or to your relations afterwards) that you were only trying to live up to a man who did this sort of thing in a book and was admired for it. You will be fined the usual forty shillings; and on the next occasion of your calling at the Mayfields' the girls will be out, and Mrs. Mayfield, an excellent lady, who has always taken a motherly interest in you, will talk seriously to you and urge <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> the pledge.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{as far as}} we are concerned. We shall require <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> in the {{presence}} of a magistrate here a formal document acknowledging that the vessel was absolutely captured, and in possession of the pirates, and that she was recaptured by his majesty's schooner the Arrow, and to sign a bond on behalf of the owners to pay the legal proportion of the value of the ship and cargo to the admiralty prize court in London. You will, of course, take her home yourself, but I shall send a naval officer with you, as the ship and its contents remain the property of government until the charges upon her are acquitted. If we were at war with France we should retain her here until she could sail under convoy of a vessel of war homeward-bound, but there is no occasion for doing that now. I do not suppose that you will find much difficulty in obtaining mates and enough sailors to make up your complement here. Scarcely a ship sails from the port without some of her men being left behind, either as deserters or through having been too drunk to rejoin. At any rate you had better be careful whom you pick, and if you should find a difficulty in obtaining men whose discharge-books show that they have hitherto borne a good character, I should advise you to ship eight or ten stout negroes. They are good hands at managing their own craft, and although they might not be of much use aloft, they are as a rule thoroughly trustworthy fellows, and quite as good for work on deck as our own men. I will give you an order on the dockyard for any repairs that you cannot get executed elsewhere. They will of course be charged for, but need not be paid for here, as they will go down in the account against the ship." ...|$|E
6000|$|You have, {{no doubt}} of it, been {{informed}} by my companions, some of [...] whom I hope got safe back again, if not all, that I was lost, [...] where many a brave man has perished before me, by going over the [...] high precipices of the mountain Brassah, in a basket, sliding [...] down by a rope.

The first providential glimpse of the morning [...] gave me a view of a ship driven by the tempest into a creek of [...] the rock, that was by nature formed like a harbour; a miraculous [...] security of deliverance, as I thought, both for the ship's crew [...] and myself. I made all the haste I could, you may be sure, to [...] them, and I found them to be Dutchmen that were come for fish; [...] but in lieu of fish I instructed them to load it with eggs and [...] fowl, which we compassed very happily in a short space of time, [...] and I was to be a sharer with the captain in the lading, and [...] bargained to go for Holland, to see the sale, and nature of the [...] traffic; but when we were at sea, after much bad weather, we made [...] towards Zealand, but we were driven upon the coast of Finland by [...] a new storm, and thence into Lapland, where I now am, and from [...] whence I send you this letter.|$|E
