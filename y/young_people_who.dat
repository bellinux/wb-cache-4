5|$|Figures were {{published}} in June 2006 showing that 76.2% of all young people aged 16–18 are already in further education or training, meaning that the rise might only affect around 25% of <b>young</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> may have otherwise sought employment immediately upon finishing compulsory education. This did not specifically state that young people would remain in secondary school, but rather by law be required {{to continue their education}} full or part-time, whether that be in sixth form, college or work based training.|$|E
5|$|B. Nagi Reddy and Aluri Chakrapani signed L. V. Prasad {{to direct}} a bilingual film for Vijaya Vauhini Studios. The film's script, by Chakrapani, was based on Rabindranath Maitra's Manmoyee Girls School and Sharadindu Bandhopadhyay's Detective. Chakrapani thought the plot of Manmoyee Girls School, about two {{unemployed}} <b>young</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> pretend {{to be married to}} gain employment and fall in love, was too limited for a full-length film. He added the basic storyline of Detective, in which an enthusiastic detective finds a missing woman and marries her. Prasad's relationship with Khan, a Muslim tailor near Kohinoor Studios in Bombay (now Mumbai), was the basis of the film's friendship between two men of different religions. The film was titled Missamma in Telugu and Missiamma in Tamil.|$|E

5|$|In America, {{he again}} tried {{his hand at}} journalism, but a brief stint {{as editor of the}} New Yorker Yiddishe Ilustrirte Zaitung {{resulted}} only in getting the paper suspended and landing himself a rather large fine. On March 31, 1905, he recited poetry at a benefit performance at Cooper Union to raise a pension for Yiddish poet Eliakum Zunser, even worse off than himself because he had found himself unable to write since coming to America in 1889. Shortly afterwards, he met a group of <b>young</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> had a Hebrew language association at the Dr. Herzl Zion Club, and wrote a Hebrew-language play David ba-Milchama (David in the War), which they performed in March 1906, the first Hebrew-language play to be performed in America. Repeat performances in March 1907 and April 1908 drew successively larger crowds.|$|E
5|$|SCI is {{extremely}} disruptive to sexuality, and it most frequently happens to <b>young</b> <b>people,</b> <b>who</b> {{are at a}} peak in their sexual and reproductive lives. Yet the importance of sexuality {{as a part of}} life is not diminished by a disabling injury. Although for years people with SCI were believed to be asexual, research has shown sexuality to be a high priority for people with SCI and an important aspect of quality of life. In fact, of all abilities they would like to have return, most paraplegics rated sexual function as their top priority, and most tetraplegics rated it second, after hand and arm function. Sexual function has a profound impact on self-esteem and adjustment to life post-injury. People who are able to adapt to their changed bodies and to have satisfying sex lives have better overall quality of life.|$|E
5|$|The {{shipbuilding}} industry {{expanded by}} a third and expected renewed prosperity, but instead a serious depression hit the economy by 1922 {{and it did not}} fully recover until 1939. The interwar years were marked by economic stagnation in rural and urban areas, and high unemployment. Indeed, the war brought with it deep social, cultural, economic, and political dislocations. Thoughtful Scots pondered their declension, as the main social indicators such as poor health, bad housing, and long-term mass unemployment, pointed to terminal social and economic stagnation at best, or even a downward spiral. Service abroad on behalf of the Empire lost its allure to ambitious <b>young</b> <b>people,</b> <b>who</b> left Scotland permanently. The heavy dependence on obsolescent heavy industry and mining was a central problem, and no one offered workable solutions. The despair reflected what Finlay (1994) describes as a widespread sense of hopelessness that prepared local business and political leaders to accept a new orthodoxy of centralised government economic planning when it arrived during the Second World War.|$|E

50|$|Carmen Parrilla {{assumes that}} San Pedro was {{a grown man}} {{by the end of}} the 15th century, when he wrote Desprecio de la Fortuna, because he apologized for the {{mistakes}} of his youth in this work.

50|$|Wind {{ensembles}} {{are often}} found at universities, {{and are more}} prevalent amongst <b>younger</b> <b>people,</b> <b>who</b> have more opportunity and encouragement to join like-minded musical people, e.g. at some schools. Older people would not be able, by definition, to join these bands. The existence of a wind band at a particular school is strongly associated with more successful schools. However a successful school need not have a wind band or orchestra.|$|R

5|$|Though {{dopamine}} agonists {{are less}} effective than levodopa at controlling PD motor symptoms, {{they are usually}} effective enough to manage these symptoms {{in the first years}} of treatment. Dyskinesias due to dopamine agonists are rare in <b>younger</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> have PD but, along with other complications, become more common with older age at onset. Thus dopamine agonists are the preferred initial treatment for younger onset PD, and levodopa is preferred for older onset PD.|$|R

50|$|Surprisingly, {{despite the}} level of talent presented, this show did not fare well in Nielsen ratings.
