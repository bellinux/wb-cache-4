5|$|A {{number of}} minor {{problems}} surfaced, but were readily fixed. The <b>yaw</b> <b>damper</b> of the XF-104 {{was found to}} be ineffective and the rudder did not positively center, these problems were corrected by revising the rudder control system. The unpowered rudder did not provide adequate directional control at high air speeds (remedied by using hydraulic power on all subsequent versions of the F-104) and some concern was expressed over poor subsonic maneuverability at higher altitudes.|$|E
25|$|The NTSB {{found that}} there was a fatigue crack in the power control module, and that it was not {{possible}} to visually inspect that type of failure. The lower rudder control module's cast metal housing had broken. The end portion of the control module housing which housed the <b>yaw</b> <b>damper</b> actuator had separated from the main portion of the housing. Deforge said in the Mayday episode that the NW85 failure was an unusual failure since most failures are of internal components rather than the housing itself.|$|E

Two types of yaw stability and control augmentation systems were implemented: washed-out yaw rate feedback and shaped control input, and a yaw rate command, heading-hold system. The results of the experiment indicate that rotorcraft configurations with high directional gust sensitivity require more <b>yaw</b> <b>damping</b> to maintain satisfactory handling qualities during nap-of-the-earth (NOE) flying tasks. It was also determined that both <b>yaw</b> <b>damping</b> and control response are critical handling qualities parameters in performing the air-to-air target acquisition and tracking task.

25|$|The TAC {{request for}} a {{fighter-bomber}} was addressed with the F-100C which flew in March 1954 and entered service on 14 July 1955, with the 450th Fighter Wing, Foster AFB, Texas. Operational testing in 1955 revealed that the F-100C was at best an interim solution, sharing all the flaws of the F-100A. The uprated J57-P-21 engine boosted performance but continued to suffer from compressor stalls. However, the F-100C was considered an excellent platform for nuclear toss bombing because of its high top speed. The inertia coupling problem was reasonably addressed with the installation of a <b>yaw</b> <b>damper</b> in the 146th F-100C, later retrofitted to earlier aircraft. A pitch damper was added starting with the 301st F-100C, {{at a cost of}} US$10,000 per aircraft.|$|E
25|$|A {{key area}} of {{advancement}} on the Mirage F1 over its predecessors {{was in its}} onboard avionics. The Thomson-CSF Cyrano IV monopulse radar system, developed from the Cyrano II unit installed on the Mirage IIIE, serves as the main sensor; it operates in three different modes: air-target acquisition and tracking, ground mapping, and terrain avoidance. The later Cyrano IV-1 model also provided for a limited look-down capability. According to aerospace publication Flight International, the Cyrano IV radar was capable of detecting aerial targets at double the range of earlier models. The standard production Mirage F1 was furnished with an Instrument Landing System (ILS), radar altimeter, UHF/VHF radio sets, Tactical Air Navigation system (TACAN) and aground data link. Other avionics include an autopilot and <b>yaw</b> <b>damper.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Alpha Jet was {{designed}} to perform a diverse range of roles. The principal users of the type, Germany and France, operated their Alpha Jets in different capacities, the former as a ground attack platform and the latter as a trainer aircraft. Beyond performing different roles, the Alpha Jet fleets of France and Germany noticeably differed in their specification and equipment; German aircraft were fitted with a more extensive weapon-aiming system, a different fuel system, a <b>yaw</b> <b>damper,</b> different brakes, nosewheel steering, an arrester hook, and Stencel ejector seats in place of Martin-Baker. According to aerospace publication Flight International, {{the majority of the}} specialised equipment used on the ground attack-orientated variant of the Alpha Jet was provided by German firms. In addition to the ground attack role, the Luftwaffe also employed the Alpha Jet in the electronic countermeasures (ECM) and aerial reconnaissance roles; for the latter purpose, a reconnaissance pod could be fitted upon the port hardpoint.|$|E

50|$|Many of the {{modifications}} listed above, {{including the}} synchronous traction motors, were tested at speeds over 400 km/h on TGV Sud-Est trainset 88. In one high-speed test, technicians attempted {{to provoke a}} truck into unstable oscillation by drastically reducing the <b>yaw</b> <b>damping,</b> but failed to achieve this.|$|R
500|$|After {{extensive}} {{wind tunnel}} testing, the stabilator was mounted {{at the top}} of the fin for optimum stability and control about the pitch axis. Because the vertical tail fin was only slightly shorter than the length of each wing and nearly as aerodynamically effective, it could act as a wing on rudder application (a phenomenon known as [...] "Dutch roll"). To offset this effect, the wings were angled downward to give 10Â° anhedral. The rudder was manually operated and supplemented by a small <b>yaw</b> <b>damper</b> surface mounted at the bottom of the fin.|$|E
500|$|The {{first of}} more than a dozen Tornado prototypes took flight on 14 August 1974 at Manching, Germany; the pilot, Paul Millett stated of the occasion: [...] "Aircraft {{handling}} was delightful... the actual flight went so smoothly that I did begin to wonder whether this was not yet another simulation". Flight testing led to the need for minor modifications. Airflow disturbances were responded to by re-profiling the engine intakes and the fuselage to minimise surging and buffeting experienced at supersonic speeds. Testing revealed that a nose-wheel steering augmentation system, connecting with the <b>yaw</b> <b>damper,</b> was necessary to counteract the destabilising effect produced by deploying the thrust reverser during landing rollouts. In August 1976, Soviet espionage activities were exposed trying to obtain information on the aircraft.|$|E
500|$|KAL007 {{had four}} {{redundant}} hydraulic systems of which systems one, two, and three were damaged or destroyed. There {{was no evidence}} of damage to system four. The hydraulics provided actuation for all the primary flight controls; all secondary flight controls except leading edge slats; and landing gear retraction, extension, gear steering, and wheel braking. Each primary flight control axis received power from all four hydraulic systems. Upon missile detonation, the jumbo jet began to experience oscillations (yawing) as the dual channel <b>yaw</b> <b>damper</b> was damaged. Yawing would not have occurred if hydraulic systems one or two were fully operational. The result is that the control column did not thrust forward upon impact (it should have done so as the plane was on autopilot) to bring down the plane to its former altitude of [...] This failure of the autopilot to correct the rise in altitude indicates that hydraulic system number three, which operates the autopilot actuator, a system controlling the plane's elevators, was damaged or out. KAL007's airspeed and acceleration rate both began to decrease as the plane began to climb. At twenty seconds after missile detonation a click was heard in the cabin, which is identified as the [...] "automatic pilot disconnect warning" [...] sound. Either the pilot or co-pilot had disconnected the autopilot and was manually thrusting the control column forward in order to bring the plane lower. Though the autopilot had been turned off, manual mode did not begin functioning for another twenty seconds. This failure of the manual system to engage upon command indicates failure in hydraulic systems one and two. With wing flaps up, [...] "control was reduced to the right inboard aileron and the innermost of spoiler section of each side".|$|E

This testing was conducted at the NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) l 6 -Foot Transonic Wind Tunnel with the LaRC High-speed Dynamic Stability system. Forced oscillation data were acquired for various configurations over a Mach number range of 0. 3 to 1. 15 measuring pitch, roll and <b>yaw</b> <b>damping,</b> {{as well as the}} normal force due to pitch rate and the cross derivatives. The test angle of attack range was from - 2 to 24 degrees, except for those cases where load constraints limited the higher angles of attack at the higher Mach numbers. A variety of model configurations with and without control surfaces were employed, including a body alone configuration. Stable pitch damping is exhibited for the baseline configuration throughout the angle of attack range for Mach numbers 0. 3, 0. 8, and 1. 15. Stable pitch damping is present for Mach numbers 0. 9 and 0. 6 with the exception of angles 2 and 16 degrees, respectively. Constant and stable roll damping were present for the baseline configuration over the range of Mach numbers up to an angle of attack of 16 degrees. The <b>yaw</b> <b>damping</b> for the baseline is somewhat stable and constant for the angle of attack range from - 2 to 8 degrees, with the exception of Mach numbers 0. 6 and 0. 8. <b>Yaw</b> <b>damping</b> becomes highly unstable for all Mach numbers at angles of attack greater than 8 degrees...|$|R

50|$|A <b>yaw</b> <b>damper</b> is {{a device}} used on many {{aircraft}} (usually jets and turboprops) to damp (reduce) the rolling and yawing oscillations {{known as the}} Dutch roll mode. It consists of yaw-rate sensors and a processor that provides a signal to an actuator connected to the rudder.

40|$|A {{mathematical}} model is described {{to investigate the}} damping moment of weakly nonlinear roll and yaw motions of a floating body in time domain under the action of sinusoidal waves. The mathematical formulation for added {{mass moment of inertia}} and damping is presented by approximating time-dependent coefficients and forcing moments when small distortion holds. Using perturbation technique, we obtain orderwise equations wherein the closed-form solution is obtained for zeroth-order case, and for higher-order cases we resort to numerical integration using Runge-Kutta method with adaptive step-size algorithm. In order to analyze the model result, we perform numerical experiment for a vessel of 19190 tons under the beam wave of 1 m height and frequency 0. 74 rad/s.

50|$|Yaw dampers usually {{consist of}} a yaw rate sensor (either a {{gyroscope}} or angular accelerometer), a computer/amplifier and a servo actuator. The <b>yaw</b> <b>damper</b> uses yaw rate sensor to sense when the aircraft begins a Dutch roll.

The computer then commands the servo actuator to move the rudder that amount. The Dutch roll is dampened out and the aircraft becomes stable about the yaw axis. Because Dutch roll is an instability that is inherent to all swept-wing aircraft, most swept-wing aircraft have some sort of <b>yaw</b> <b>damper</b> system installed.|$|E
40|$|A new {{candidate}} lateral agility metric, {{the modified}} torsional agility parameter, is proposed and tested through generic, nonlinear, non-real-time flight simulation {{programs of the}} F- 18 and F- 5 A.

50|$|The second {{lateral motion}} is an oscillatory {{combined}} roll and yaw motion called Dutch roll, {{perhaps because of}} its similarity to an ice-skating motion {{of the same name}} made by Dutch skaters; the origin of the name is unclear. The Dutch roll may be described as a yaw and roll to the right, followed by a recovery towards the equilibrium condition, then an overshooting of this condition and a yaw and roll to the left, then back past the equilibrium attitude, and so on. The period is usually on the order of 3-15 seconds, but it can vary from a few seconds for light aircraft to a minute or more for airliners. Damping is increased by large directional stability and small dihedral and decreased by small directional stability and large dihedral. Although usually stable in a normal aircraft, the motion may be so slightly damped that the effect is very unpleasant and undesirable. In swept-back wing aircraft, the Dutch roll is solved by installing a <b>yaw</b> <b>damper,</b> in effect a special-purpose automatic pilot that damps out any yawing oscillation by applying rudder corrections. Some swept-wing aircraft have an unstable Dutch roll. If the Dutch roll is very lightly damped or unstable, the <b>yaw</b> <b>damper</b> becomes a safety requirement, rather than a pilot and passenger convenience. Dual yaw dampers are required and a failed <b>yaw</b> <b>damper</b> is cause for limiting flight to low altitudes, and possibly lower Mach numbers, where the Dutch roll stability is improved.|$|E
40|$|A {{low speed}} wind tunnel {{investigation}} is {{conducted for the}} vortex flow characteristics of a tailless fighter configuration that features full length, fuselage-blended forebody strakes. Static pressure distributions were obtained on the forebody upper surface, and six-component forces and moments were measured on the complete, 60 -deg cropped delta wing-fuselage-centerline vertical fin model at angles of attack and sideslip respectively reaching 50 deg and + or - 20 deg. The surface pressure data reveal that development of concentrated vortices from the sharp edged forebody strakes occurred at moderate and high angles of attack. The blended forebody was effective in capturing the windward vortical flow up to high incidence and sideslip angles. The direct suction effect of the windward vortex on the forebody sidewall was the primary contributor to static directional stability at high angles of attack.

The results of the program revealed that SSSA is a viable approach to implementing attitude command and also that SSSA has the capability of performing less demanding augmentation tasks such as <b>yaw</b> <b>damping,</b> wing leveling, and pitch damping.
