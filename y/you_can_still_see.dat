50|$|In August 1869, {{the crowds}} of Methodist campers, {{many of whom were}} from the large {{industrial}} cities in northern New Jersey, gathered in the rustic area for the ten-day camp meeting. Before living in tents, many members set up home in their horse driven wagons in which they rode to the camp meeting. Many tent owners built wooden floors and cabinets inside their tents to protect belongings from the long, cold winter when the campers returned home (<b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>still</b> <b>see</b> this unique style of summer tent living in Ocean Grove today). Over the years the more affluent members of the community, prominent lawyers, ministers and doctors from the Jersey City, Newark, Paterson, Elizabeth and Morristown areas, were building decorative Victorian-style homes (albeit small enough to fit on 16- by 32- foot the tent lots), to make their encampment in the summer more comfortable.|$|R

The film (about 50 min?) was shown one time. There was many (50?) years later a reunion concert with the people who attended the filming.

50|$|This {{station was}} the {{terminus}} {{of the last}} ever proper branch line {{to be built in}} Ireland, when the Great Southern & Western Railway opened a line just north of Kilkenny on the Portlaoise via Abbeyleix line to the coal mining town of Castlecomer in 1922. The branch lost its passenger service only ten years after opening, however it remained open for coal and general goods until January 1963, closing along with the Portlaoise to Kilkenny line. The corrugated iron station building and single platform at Castlecomer Station are now long gone, the site now occupied by the 'Railway Garage'. The trackbed of the coal mine extension from the station to the coal mines outside Castlecomer town is now a footpath. Many of the concrete piers which carried the railway across the Dinin River are still in situ just south of Dysart crossing, visible from the adjacent N78 road. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> also <b>still</b> <b>see</b> the left-side concrete bridge abutment at the Cloghogue Bridge, Chatsworth Street.

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, when Island Records {{approached}} Adé about releasing his material internationally under its Mango Records imprint, the musician {{was already a}} star in his native Nigeria, with his own record label, his own nightclub to host his performances and {{a track record of}} releasing three or four albums a year. When Adé agreed, he was teamed with Martin Meissonnier, a French record producer who advised that the typical long song structures of Nigerian music would not work for Western audiences. Accordingly, Adé divided a number of his Nigerian hits for international release, a task he found unchallenging. He later explained that [...] "In Nigeria, we got used to non-stop recording, about 18 to 20 minutes of music. But over here, the music should be track-by-track for the radio and the dance floor.

And the way I am approaching this - is through the idea of infection.   What if an existing building becomes infected by new purposes and qualities, and if so then how this move could be performed and realized? Unlike the majority of the adaptive reuse projects, mine has at its core the idea of introducing new feathers and elements in the way that it’s natural and a bit illusive, without contrasting the newly added to already existed. My goal is not to reveal this materiality difference.

60|$|This is {{a double}} change. Let me first of all say a word in {{justification}} for my first assertion that existing areas do not represent communities, and then pass to a necessary consequence or so of this fact. I submit that before the railways, {{that is to say}} in the days in which the current conception of local government areas arose, the villages, and still more the boroughs, and even the counties, were practically complete minor economic systems. The wealth of the locality was, roughly speaking, local; rich people resided in contact with their property, other people lived in contact with their work, and it was a legitimate assumption that a radius of a mile or so, or of a few miles, circumscribed most of the practical interests of all the inhabitants of a locality. You got rich and poor in visible relationships; you got landlord and tenant, you got master and workman all together. But now, through a revolution in the methods of locomotion, and chiefly through the making of railways, this is no longer true. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>still</b> <b>see</b> the villages and towns separated by spaces of fields and physically distinct, but it is no longer the case that all who dwell in these old limits are essentially local inhabitants and mutually interdependent as once they would have been.

60|$|What {{would happen}} then, you may guess for yourself, {{from what you}} see happen {{whenever}} the land is left to itself, {{as it is in}} the wood above. In that wood <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>still</b> <b>see</b> the grass ridges and furrows which show that it was once ploughed and sown by man; perhaps as late as the time of Henry the Eighth, when a great deal of poor land, as you will read some day, was thrown out of tillage, to become forest and down once more. And what is the mount now? A jungle of oak and beech, cherry and holly, young and old all growing up together, with the mountain ash and bramble and furze coming up so fast beneath them, that we have to cut the paths clear again year by year. Why, even the little cow-wheat, a very old- world plant, which only grows in ancient woods, has found its way back again, I know not whence, and covers the open spaces with its pretty yellow and white flowers. Man had conquered this mount, you see, from Madam How, hundreds of years ago. And she always lets man conquer her, because Lady Why wishes man to conquer: only he must have a fair fight with Madam How first, and try his strength against hers to the utmost. So man conquered the wood for a while; and it became cornfield instead of forest: but he was not strong and wise enough three hundred years ago to keep what he had conquered; and back came Madam How, and took the place into her own hands, and bade the old forest trees and plants come back again--as they would come if they were not stopped year by year, down from the wood, over the pastures--killing the rich grasses as they went, till they met another forest coming up from below, and fought it for many a year, till both made peace, and lived quietly side by side for ages.|$|E
