I have an opportunity of saying what I have always felt – that I am your friend, for my interests are <b>your</b> <b>interests,</b> and <b>your</b> <b>interests</b> are my interests. We were born on the same soil, breathe the same air, and live in the same land. Why, then, can we not live as brothers? I will say that when the war broke out I felt it my duty to stand by my people. When the time came I did the best I could, and I don't believe I flickered. I came here with the jeers of some white people, who think that I am doing wrong. I believe that I can exert some influence, and do much to assist the people in strengthening fraternal relations, and shall do all in my power to bring about peace. It has always been my motto to elevate every man- to depress none. (Applause.) I want to elevate you to take positions in law offices, in stores, on farms, and wherever you are capable of going.|$|E

I'm not gonna let their fathers, with all of their money, buy, you know, big-time lawyers and get them off. I'm doing this for you.'"

2500|$|A {{significant}} part of Haggard's ministry at New Life Church was based around an entrepreneurial leadership model, which is also covered in The Life-Giving Church. Haggard felt that young and upcoming leaders of the church would bog down in [...] "cumbersome systems" [...] in their churches and decide to take their talents elsewhere, resulting in the church losing its [...] "brightest and best future leaders". Rather than a top-down command and control hierarchy where Haggard made all the decisions and people fell in line, he instituted a free market concept that encouraged young leaders to debate the best ideas (even {{to the point of}} disagreeing with him) and pursue God-inspired dreams and visions in their own departments and beyond. In Haggard's book, Primary Purpose, he explains that the normal leadership style that governments and many corporations use is top down, while the servant leadership model he teaches is the opposite. In a visual representation, Haggard uses an upside down triangle to illustrate this concept. The leader is at the bottom and the people to be served are on top. This [...] "Philippians 2 Attitude" [...] comes from the scripture that states, [...] "Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit, but in humility consider others better than yourselves. Each of you should look not only to <b>your</b> <b>interests,</b> but also to the interests of others." [...] "I took a free-market approach to that and just wanted to empower people to minister whatever was in their hearts." [...] Some of the best-known results of this model are the Mill, the Desperation Band and Desperation interns, the Furnace and World Prayer Center, 24/7 leadership training and New Life Groups, a unique brand of free-market small groups as well as many others. As an example of his coaching of young leaders, John Bolin, in the book Confident Parents, Exceptional Teens that he co-wrote with Haggard, says [...] " [...] talked about communicating with people by improving my posture, poise, and delivery. He painstakingly coached me to stand up tall, to speak with confidence, to look people in the eye, and to articulate with concise clarity... he knew I wouldn't be effective... unless I understood the principle of communication and connection by presenting myself well".|$|E
