500|$|London-based studio Union {{created the}} film's visual effects. According to editor Elliot Graham, {{extensive}} film editing took place even before principal photography was completed. During the one-week rehearsal {{that took place}} in between production {{for each of the three}} acts (shot in chronological order), Graham would work on the existing footage and receive ongoing feedback from Boyle in the editing room. In an interview with Variety, Graham said a particular challenge for him was balancing the shot frequency and providing enough [...] "visual interventions" [...] to control for Sorkin's dialogue-heavy screenplay. He described approaching each scene as [...] "a series of fight sequences". Michael Fassbender provided multiple versions of his performance as Jobs, which Graham and Boyle would then choose from during post-production. Graham also said: [...] "Danny would be involved a lot but also take time away. He would say 'if I'm with <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> time, we'll always have the same opinions because we're on the exact same journey.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{it finds}} B.o.B {{throwing}} away his old habits {{and telling the}} girl he loves {{not to worry about}} other women as he wants to [...] "settle down", while flattering her. In the hook and bridge, Mars is able to allure the girl, who is the object of all this affection, by serenading her. B.o.B, during his verses, makes references appealing not only to younger supporters, [...] "Just like that, girl, you got me froze/ Like a Nintendo 64", but also to older admirers, [...] "Baby <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> package, plus you pay your taxes". Tiny Mix Tapes pointed out that the song's lyrics use [...] "clumsy analogies". Batey found B.o.B's attitude and rapping verses care free, in which you can almost hear him smiling. David Jeffries had a different opinion, stating that the rapper [...] "courts the ladies" [...] on the song along with Mars. He also added that B.o.B transmitted his [...] "positive vibes" [...] on [...] "Nothin' on You". B.o.B compared the song's [...] "spirit" [...] to [...] "Bonita Applebum" [...] by A Tribe Called Quest. Mars confessed that the lyrics are about someone, saying they come from [...] "real-life experience, whether it's at the time or me back-tracking to how I felt at another moment." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{church is}} built from rubble masonry. [...] The roof, {{which is made}} from slate, has a stone bellcote at the west end. Entrance is through the doorway on the south side, from the late 15th century; it has {{decorated}} surrounds and a square frame. There is no structural division between the nave (where the congregation sit) and the chancel (where the altar is located) apart from a single step up into the chancel. The church is about [...] long by [...] wide. The east window, from the late 14th century, {{is set in a}} pointed arch with decorative edging. It has stained glass from 1916 depicting Christ crowning a knight with the words [...] "Well done thou good and faithful servant / Take unto <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> armour of God." [...] There are two pairs of square-headed windows in the south wall, dating from the 17th century. On {{the north side of the}} church, a second entrance was blocked up in the late 19th century, and there is one pair of square-headed windows, also from the 17th century; there is also a small window at the west end of the church, from the 17th or 18th century. [...] The beams of the roof can be seen from inside the church. Behind the altar is a panelled reredos from the 19th century.|$|E
500|$|The {{pressure}} evidently worked, as Rinder {{wrote an}} [...] "Apology and Announcement" [...] on June 4, 2005 {{in which he}} told Miscavige, [...] "I recognise very clearly how Treasonous I have been towards you and Scientology." [...] He subsequently commented that such written confessions [...] "read like North Korean POW writeups," [...] alluding to the way that Korean War POWs detained in North Korea were forced to go through brainwashing to renounce their [...] "reactionary imperialist" [...] mindset. He explained to the Tampa Bay Times why people did not simply {{walk out of the}} Hole: [...] "If you leave you are going to lose contact with your family and any friends who are Scientologists. You have it pounded into <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> time that the only reason someone leaves a group like that is because they are bad, that you have done something that force you to have to leave." [...] He noted people had invested a great deal of themselves in Scientology, that Sea Org members have [...] "made a commitment beyond even a single lifetime" [...] and that the prevailing attitude was that [...] "'I've lived through many lifetimes {{and there are lots of}} experiences that I've had that are far worse than this, so I can put up with this and I can stand it'." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Court {{warned the}} {{students}} not to delay contacting their families because the Court {{was going to}} write them promptly. Dean Greenough wrote to Roberts: [...] "The letter that I am sending to your father this morning, although it does not tell him everything, necessitates your telling him everything." [...] To Kenneth Day he wrote: [...] "It {{would be better for}} them to hear it from you than from me." [...] The Dean's letters about students who had committed no overt act explained the circumstances at length and provided he Court's rationale for expulsion in such cases: [...] "The acts in question are so unspeakably gross that the intimates of those who commit these acts become tainted." [...] He made a clear distinction by not criticizing such a student's character, but his judgment, calling him [...] "no worse than ignorant, over-curious, and careless." [...] When it came to those who had engaged in homosexual sex, Greenough withheld details yet tried to underscore the significance of the violation. To Roberts' father, Greenough wrote that his son [...] "has promised to tell you all about the matter, and I hope he will tell <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> truth. His offense {{has nothing to do with}} low scholarship; it is not gambling, or drink or ordinary sexual intercourse. If he does not confess to something worse than these things, he will not have told <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> story." ...|$|E
2500|$|The four {{brothers}} were united in Lahore, {{but every day}} they were informed that Sher Shah was getting closer and closer. When he reached Sirhind, Humayun sent an ambassador carrying the message [...] "I have left <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> of Hindustan (i.e. the lands to the East of Punjab, comprising most of the Ganges Valley). Leave Lahore alone, and let Sirhind be a boundary between you and me." [...] Sher Shah, however, replied [...] "I have left you Kabul. You should go there." [...] Kabul was {{the capital of the}} empire of Humayun's brother Kamran, who was far from willing to hand over any of his territories to his brother. Instead, Kamran approached Sher Shah and proposed that he actually revolt against his brother and side with Sher Shah in return for most of the Punjab. Sher Shah dismissed his help, believing it not to be required, though word soon spread to Lahore about the treacherous proposal, and Humayun was urged to make an example of Kamran and kill him. Humayun refused, citing the last words of his father, Babur, [...] "Do nothing against your brothers, even though they may deserve it." ...|$|E
