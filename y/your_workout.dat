[...] While running, the runner's body first burns the stored sugars and then begins to burn fat after the sugar is depleted. During a fartlek workout while the body is trying to replace the sugar storage, “fat stores are burned in a metabolic effect that lasts long after your workout." [...] Fartleks are a great option for people that run for their health because the fat burning portion makes it a very efficient exercise.|$|R

5000|$|High {{intensity}} {{interval training}} (HIIT) consists of repeated, short bursts of exercise, completed {{at a high}} level of intensity. These sets of intense activity are followed by a predetermined time of rest or low intensity activity. [...] Studies have shown that exercising at a higher intensity has increased cardiac benefits for humans, compared to when exercising at a low or moderate level. When <b>your</b> <b>workout</b> consists of an HIIT session, your body has to work harder to replace the oxygen it lost. Research into the benefits of HIIT have revealed that it can be very successful for reducing fat, especially around the abdominal region. Furthermore, when compared to continuous moderate exercise, HIIT proves to burn more calories and increase the amount of fat burned post- HIIT session. Lack of time {{is one of the main}} reasons stated for not exercising; HIIT is a great alternative for those people because the duration of an HIIT session can be as short as 10 minutes, making it much quicker than conventional workouts.|$|E

Today’s {{advancement}} in technology brings us the XiSport Cycling Training Device. The XiSport lets you do {{all of that and}} more; it has all the functionality of a speedometer, i. e. Speed, Cadence, Distance, and Time, but only the Xi displays Gearing, Acceleration, as well as YOUR personally designed custom workout. Currently, nothing out there on the market lets YOU, the user, build your own workouts to suit your needs. Buying big, bulky gym equipment is the only other way to get a preprogrammed workout, and that isn’t your own personally designed workout. We’ve designed the Xi to be small enough to be attached to your bike as well as safe enough to be used outside on the open road as well as giving you a great workout in the comfort of your own home. For those who own a bike and are wanting to get a little more out of their casual ride, {{all the way up to}} serious cyclist who needs that extra reminder during training to stay at a certain workout level, the XiSport Cycling Training Device is for you. The workout mode takes in the benchmarks from <b>your</b> <b>workout</b> and graphically displays them. The screen has two training bars as well as a progress bar on the bottom to show you how far along you are in the workout. The training bars display the goal for that segment of the workout just to the left of the middle of the bar. Then during <b>your</b> <b>workout,</b> the bar will go up or down relative to the distance you’re from your goal.

40|$|What {{does the}} heart rate signify? It’s a window into your muscles and lungs; it reveals how hard they are working. Your heart pounds to pump {{oxygen-rich}} blood to your muscles and to carry cell waste products away from your muscles. The more you demand of your muscles, the harder your heart has to work to perform these tasks. That means your heart must beat faster to deliver more blood. The heart rate gives a good indication during exercise routines of how effective that routine is improving your health. Once only used by elite athletes, heart rate monitors are now becoming an essential tool for everyone from the casual athlete to the personal trainer. Heart monitors provide an easy and scientific measure of the effort you are putting into <b>your</b> <b>workouts.</b> A heart rate monitor is simply a device that takes a sample of heartbeats and computes the beats per minute so that the information can easily be used to track heart condition. Current technology consists of optical and electrical monitors. The electrical method provides a bulky strap around one’s chest. The optical method {{does not require the}} strap and can be used more conveniently than the electrical method. There are many constraints in producing a heart monitor.

40|$|Core ” {{muscles are}} the muscles {{that support the}} {{midsection}} and spine. Think of core muscles as nature’s “protective girdle. ” Strong core muscles with optimal endurance work to prevent back injuries and help promote optimal function. Exercising your core muscles should be a *regular part of <b>your</b> <b>workouts!</b> The Basics Bowl of Stability: Core muscles act like a bowl around your spine. Optimal strength and endurance makes this “bowl ” stronger and more stable. You also need to balance “stability” (strength & endurance) and “mobility ” (Range of Motion/ROM). Core Muscles: These muscles surround and brace your trunk or midsection. They form a wrap-a-round “girdle ” or “bowl of support ” that stabilizes your spine. Core muscles {{are more than just}} abdominals on the front of your body—they are also on your sides and mid/low/upper back areas. Some are deep and some are superficial which creates a layered effect for increased stabilization. Strength vs. Endurance for ABS/Back: Excessive strength of core muscles won’t prevent back injuries, but core “endurance ” has been shown to improve the protection of the spinal column— this is the “new philosophy ” in ABS/Back, or rather, “Core ” exercise. Science & Body Mechanics Challenge to Compressive-Cost-Index: A high amount of challenge means you use a lot of core abdominal muscles. The cost of using these muscles relates to the amount of spinal compression (usually refers to lumbar spine) that takes place when they are used. A high cost index is optimal; this means that you are working the most amount muscles without creating unsafe compressive forces on your spine. Compressive Force/Spinal Loading: This happens when you activate the core muscles. Some degree of compressive force occurs with all ABS/Back exercises. The key is to keep the compressive force or spinal loading within an acceptable range while still challenging those muscles enough to improve strength and endurance. Fast Twitch Core Muscles: These are the superficial “strength-oriented ” muscles near your skin. Isometric Contraction: This is when a muscle is activated and develops force but no movement occurs. For core exercises, this would relate to “bracing. ...|$|R

40|$|O objetivo desta pesquisa é analisar o filme O Discreto Charme da Burguesia, de Luis Buñuel (1972), por meio de alguns conceitos do referencial teórico-metodológico de Michel Foucault: saber e enunciado discursivo em suas relações com o poder e verdade, e buscar compreender o poder em seu exercício no filme, e não apenas em seus efeitos. Partindo de alguns princípios sobre saber em Foucault, mapeamos um enunciado fílmico que apareceu em algumas sequências, qual seja: O barulho que oculta a discreta violência da burguesia. Diante disso, pudemos avaliar poder e verdade, noções essas que se fizeram insistentemente presentes na materialidade do filme, solicitando mecanismos de análise. Realizamos, então, reflexões sobre esses princípios por meio da teoria arqueogenealógica de Michel Foucault, para depois aplicá-los na análise do filme. A pesquisa apresenta também aspectos da vida de Luis Buñuel, traça relações entre a ditadura militar deste filme e a ditadura militar brasileira, além de pontuar a experiência deste diretor com o movimento surrealista, sua criação católica e o exílio na Espanha em momento de ditadura. Tudo isso Buñuel revela em sua obra. Estabelecemos, também, antes da análise, um diálogo entre Marx e Foucault no que se refere à questão do poder em relação à compreensão de burguesia. The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to analyze the film The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie by Luis Buñuel (1972), by means of some concepts of the theoretical and methodological framework of Michel Foucault: "knowing" and "discursive statement" in its relations with the "power "and" truth ", and seek to understand the power in <b>your</b> <b>workout</b> in the film, and not only in its effects. Starting with some basics about "knowing" in Foucault, we mapped one filmic statement which appeared in some sequences, which is: "The noise that hides the discrete violence of the bourgeoisie. " Therefore, we assess the "power and truth," these notions that became persistently present in the materiality of the film, prompting analysis mechanisms. Then conducted reflections on these principles by theory arqueogenealógica Foucault, then apply them to the analysis of the film. The research also presents aspects of the life of Luis Buñuel, traces relations between the military dictatorship of this movie and the Brazilian military dictatorship, and punctuate the experience of the director with the Surrealist movement his Catholic creation and exile in Spain in time of dictatorship. Buñuel all this shows in his work. We also established prior to analysis, a dialogue between Marx and Foucault in relation to the issue of power in relation to understanding the "bourgeoisie. ...|$|E

Martin Pacific Lutheran University, Tacoma, WA PURPOSE: The {{overall goal}} {{of this study was}} to examine whether an {{increase}} in willingness to incorporate specific fitness apps into daily exercise patterns would increase following a two-week educational unit for college students currently enrolled in physical activity courses. The following hypothesis was developed: a willingness to incorporate fitness apps into daily exercise would increase significantly from pre to post-test. METHODS: Participants included 102 undergraduate students currently enrolled in a physical activity class at a small, liberal arts university in the Pacific Northwest. Participants consisted of freshman through graduating seniors, and were enrolled in a variety of activity courses including: personalized fitness program PE, co-ed volleyball, or pickleball. All participants completed the pre and post-test fitness app survey, as well as the two-week educational unit. To assess potential change following the two week duration, the pre and post-test surveys consisted of statements in which students responded to a 5 point Likert scale such as “is the app content what you expected”, “how well can the app be customized to the needs and interest of the user”, and “how willing are you to incorporate this app into <b>your</b> <b>workout.</b> ” During the two-week educational unit students were instructed to download, encouraged to use, and required to evaluate and assess whether they would incorporate each of the five identified fitness apps into their daily exercise patterns. The five fitness apps were: 1) FitBit, 2) MapMyRun, 3) MyFitnessPal, 4) Nike Training Club, and 5) Jefit Workout. Pre to post-test change was analyzed using paired t-test with the significance value set at p 3 ̆c 0. 05. RESULTS: Paired t-tests were conducted to examine pre to post-test change in willingness to incorporate specific fitness apps into collegiate student’s daily exercise patterns. Paired t-test revealed significant differences between pre and post-test for all five apps; FitBit pre (. 41 ± 1. 12) and post-test (1. 5 ±. 99), MapMyRun pre (1. 12 ± 1. 79) and post-test (3. 78 ±. 77), MyFitnessPal pre (. 86 ± 1. 58) and post-test (4. 35 ±. 78), Nike Training Club pre (. 65 ± 1. 44) and post-test (4. 48 ±. 63), and JeFit pre (. 02 ±. 20) and post-test (2. 09 ±. 51). CONCLUSION: When provided access, instruction, and encouragement from their instructor students enjoy the use of fitness apps, find them useful, and are likely to incorporate apps to enhance their exercise experience.

Rad Automatic of Sega Saturn Magazine stated that the game is fun but severely outdated {{in terms of both}} graphics and gameplay, though he did praise the absence of slowdown and the authentic arcade feel of the tate mode. A reviewer for Maximum similarly commented that the game falls into the retro genre without offering the nostalgia value found in most such releases, and further criticized that the tate mode [...] "isn't very practical in execution (and not particularly healthy for your television)." [...] While he acknowledged the game is fun, he noted it was being released alongside a host of top-quality Saturn titles (including Virtua Fighter 2 and Sega Rally Championship), and concluded, [...] "Come on - be honest now - is this really the sort of game you coughed up £300 to play with your high-tech next generation gaming system? Playable it may be, but it's not really worth buying." [...] A Next Generation critic agreed that Galactic Attack is dated and would appeal only to die-hard shooter fans, but nonetheless took the time to explain why shooter fans would enjoy it more than most games in the genre: [...] "Aside from the fact that Galactic Attack is a super-fast action game, there is a definite feeling of quality development and several elements of smart game techniques that are displayed with this title. The best part about Galactic Attack, however, is that it offers everything a good space shooter should without any problems that may have shown up on a 16-bit system trying to do the same ... which means no slow down, even when a load of sprites are on the screen at once." [...] GamePro gave the game a positive review, saying it [...] "features gorgeous, space-themed backgrounds and a rockin' soundtrack.
