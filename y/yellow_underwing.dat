25|$|Slugs and snails {{are serious}} pests {{in some parts}} of the world, {{particularly}} in spring when new growth is emerging through the soil. Earwigs can also disfigure the blooms. The other main pests likely to be encountered are aphids (usually on young stems and immature flower buds), red spider mite (causing foliage mottling and discolouration, worse in hot and dry conditions) and capsid bugs (resulting in contortion and holes at growing tips). Diseases affecting dahlias include powdery mildew, grey mould (Botrytis cinerea), verticillium wilt, dahlia smut (Entyloma calendulae f. dahliae), phytophthora and some plant viruses. Dahlias are a source of food for the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including angle shades, common swift, ghost moth and large <b>yellow</b> <b>underwing.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The Salmon-crested {{cockatoo}} (Cacatua moluccensis) {{also known}} as the Moluccan cockatoo, is a cockatoo endemic to the Seram archipelago in eastern Indonesia. At a height of up to 46-52 cm and weight of up to 850 g, it is among the largest of the white cockatoos. The female is larger than the male on average. It has white-pink feathers with a definite peachy glow, a slight <b>yellow</b> on the <b>underwing</b> and underside of the tail feathers and a large retractable recumbent crest which it raises when threatened, revealing hitherto concealed bright red-orange plumes to frighten potential attackers. It may also be raised in excitement or in other 'emotional' displays. Some describe the crest as [...] "flamingo-colored." [...] It also has one of the louder calls in the parrot world and in captivity is a capable mimic.|$|R

50|$|Noctua janthe, {{the lesser}} broad-bordered <b>yellow</b> <b>underwing,</b> is a moth {{of the family}} Noctuoidea. Some authors {{consider}} Noctua janthe and Noctua janthina {{to be the same}} species. It is found in Europe and North Africa.|$|E
5000|$|Broad-bordered <b>yellow</b> <b>underwing</b> (N. fimbriata) - rare, one on 29 September 1994 {{was a new}} Isles of Scilly record. A {{second was}} caught on 29 September 1995 and a third on 9 July 2001; all on St Agnes.|$|E
50|$|This species {{generally}} has {{the appearance of}} a smaller (wingspan 38-48 mm) version of the large <b>yellow</b> <b>underwing</b> Noctua pronuba. The forewings are equally variable in pattern and colour, from pale clay to reddish clay, light brown to almost black. The stigmata are dark and outlined with pale yellow. The crosslines are weak. The wavy line flows on to the front edge as a no more than dark brown (never black) stain, which is sometimes extended down the enire wavy line. The hindwings are orange-yellow with a broad black sub-terminal band and central discal lunule (usually absent in Noctua pronuba). It is also similar to the lunar <b>yellow</b> <b>underwing</b> Noctua orbona. In the overall impression a broad-winged species.|$|E
50|$|Catocala nymphagoga, the oak <b>yellow</b> <b>underwing,</b> is a moth of the Erebidae family. It {{is found}} in Southern Europe, from Bulgaria up to the Iberian Peninsula and {{sometimes}} further north as a migrant. It {{is also found in}} North Africa and Asia Minor.|$|E
50|$|Noctua fimbriata, the broad-bordered <b>yellow</b> <b>underwing,</b> is a moth of {{the family}} Noctuidae. It is found in Europe, North Africa, Anatolia, the Caucasus, Turkey, Caucasus, Transcaucasia, Armenia, Turkmenistan and Novosibirsk Oblast. The border of its {{southern}} range is unclear because of the similar looking species Noctua tirrenica.|$|E
50|$|Dianthus {{species are}} used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species {{including}} Cabbage Moth, Double-striped Pug, Large <b>Yellow</b> <b>Underwing</b> and The Lychnis. Also three species of Coleophora case-bearers feed exclusively on Dianthus; C. dianthi, C. dianthivora and C. musculella (which feeds exclusively on D. superbus).|$|E
50|$|Noctuid moths {{commonly}} {{begin the}} reproductive season from spring to fall, and mostly are multivoltine, {{such as the}} Eastern Panthea moth (Panthea furcilla), which reproduces over the year. Nevertheless, some species have just one brood of offspring (univoltine); among the best known is the Lesser <b>yellow</b> <b>underwing</b> (Noctua comes).|$|E
50|$|The Small Dark <b>Yellow</b> <b>Underwing</b> (Coranarta cordigera) is a moth of the Noctuidae family. It can {{be found}} in parts of Europe, mainly in the North. In Central and Southern Europe it is only found in mountainous areas. In the Alps for instance, it is found up to heights of 2,200 meters.|$|E
