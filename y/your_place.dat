25|$|Some {{writers in}} their manner and stance {{intentionally}} provoke challenge and criticism from their readers. Others just {{invite you to}} think. Baudrillard's hyperprose demands only that you grunt wide-eyed or bewildered assent. He yearns to have intellectual influence, but must fend off any serious analysis of his own writing, remaining free to leap from one bombastic assertion to the next, no matter how brazen. <b>Your</b> <b>place</b> is simply to buy his books, adopt his jargon, and drop his name wherever possible.|$|E
25|$|The Kindle Paperwhite (1st generation) was {{announced}} on September 6, 2012, and released on October 1. It has a 6in, 212PPI E Ink Pearl display (758×1024 resolution) with four built-in LEDs {{to illuminate the}} screen. It was available in Wi-Fi ($120 ad-supported, $140 no ads) and Wi-Fi + 3G ($180 ad-supported, $200 no ads) models, with the ad-supported options only intended to {{be available in the}} United States. The light {{is one of the main}} features of the Paperwhite and it has a manually adjusted light level. The 3G access restrictions are the same as the Kindle Touch, and usage of the 3G data is limited to 50 MB per month and only on Amazon and Wikipedia's websites; additional data may be purchased. Battery life is advertised as up to eight weeks of reading with half an hour per day with wireless off and constant light usage; this usage equals 28 hours. The official leather cover for the Paperwhite uses the hall effect sensor in the device that detects when the cover is closed/opened to turn the screen off/on respectively. This device was the first Kindle to track one's reading speed to estimate when one will finish a chapter or book; this feature was later included with updates to the other Kindles and Kindle Fire tablets. The Kindle Paperwhite lacks physical buttons for page turning and does not perform auto-hyphenation. Except for the lock screen/power button at its bottom, it relies solely on the touchscreen interface. In November 2012, Amazon released the 5.3.0 update that allowed users to turn off recommended content on the home screen in Grid View (allowing two rows of user content) and included general bug fixes. In March 2014, the Paperwhite 5.4.4 update was released that added Goodreads integration, Kindle FreeTime to restrict usage for children, Cloud Collections for organization and Page Flip for scanning content without losing <b>your</b> <b>place,</b> which closely matched the Paperwhite 2's software features.|$|E

500|$|The lyrics in {{the song}} are cryptic; The ending lines of the third verse emphasise in belief and assurance: [...] "If {{you could see it}} then you'd understand/ah, when you see it then you'll understand," [...] and [...] "Some things you have to believe/others are puzzles puzzling me."

500|$|Although Sunday {{was ordained}} by the Presbyterian Church in 1903, his {{ministry}} was nondenominational {{and he was}} not a strict Calvinist. He preached that individuals were, at least in part, responsible for their own salvation. [...] "Trail hitters" [...] were given a four-page tract that stated, [...] "if you have done your part (i.e. believe that Christ died in <b>your</b> <b>place,</b> and receive Him as your Saviour and Master) God has done HIS part and imparted to you His own nature." ...|$|E

500|$|At {{the advice}} of his former editor Raymond de Becker, Hergé {{travelled}} to Zürich to consult the Swiss psychoanalyst Franz Riklin, a student of Carl Jung, to decipher his disturbing dreams. Riklin latched on to the [...] "quest for purity" [...] that featured so prominently in Hergé's dreams, and ultimately in Tintin in Tibet. He told the author that he must destroy [...] "the demon of purity" [...] in his mind as soon as possible: [...] "I do not want to discourage you, but you will never reach the goal of your work.

500|$|With Lights and Sounds, Yellowcard {{broke away}} from their {{original}} pop punk sound to a more alternative rock album. The album is somewhat of a concept album, made to reflect what Yellowcard was feeling {{at the time of}} production. Ryan Key, in discussion of this, said that Ocean Avenue was about [...] "finding <b>your</b> <b>place</b> in the world" [...] and explained that Lights and Sounds was about [...] "realizing that you've gotten lost". The band has cited Radiohead's Kid A (2000) and Guns N' Roses' 1991 albums Use Your Illusion I and Use Your Illusion II as major influences for the album. Yellowcard also credit Aphex Twin, Mouse on Mars and Explosions in the Sky for inspiration, regarding the music sound in the album.|$|E
500|$|The {{role of the}} Italian father Tony {{was played}} by Frank H. Crane. Crane was {{involved}} in the very beginnings of the Thanhouser Company and acted in numerous productions before becoming a director at Thanhouser. In the role of Tony's wife was Anna Rosemond, who was one of two leading ladies for {{the first year of the}} company. Marie Eline, played the role of Tony's son, was concealed in masculine make up and black hair for the role of the Italian boy. The Moving Picture World said, [...] "aybe you'd never recognize her if we did not tip you off.

[...] He threatened to expel Taylor, who responded by saying a forced departure would mean the end of US support. However, Khánh later said he was open to the possibility of going abroad and asked Taylor if he thought this {{would be good for the}} country, to which the ambassador replied in the affirmative. Khánh also said he took responsibility for his generals' actions, and expressed regret at what they had done. Khánh then ended the meeting, saying he would think about his future.|$|E

2500|$|Other reviews {{were more}} positive. In Inside Bay Area, Esther Fields opined that [...] "...ot {{only does it}} {{challenge}} modern assumptions about how the world works, but it also points the way toward {{a new way of}} understanding <b>your</b> <b>place</b> in the cosmos...and shows how we are on the brink of world changes as great as those of the time of Galileo and Copernicus." [...] Anthroposophist Frederick Dennehy opined in Lilipoh magazine that [...] "Tarnas’ deeply radical hypothesis is that the disenchantment of the modern universe is unreal – the result of a “simplistic epistemology” and moral positioning totally inadequate to the depths, complexity and grandeur of the cosmos." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{their early}} dislike for one another, Goldman and de Cleyre came to {{respect each other}} intellectually. In her 1894 essay [...] "In Defense of Emma Goldman and the Right of Expropriation", de Cleyre wrote {{in support of the}} right of {{expropriation}} while remaining neutral on its advocacy: [...] "I do not think one little bit of sensitive human flesh is worth all the property rights in N.

2500|$|After the disaster, Ismay was savaged by {{both the}} American and the British press for deserting the ship while women and {{children}} were still on board. Some papers called him the [...] "Coward of the Titanic" [...] or [...] "J. Brute Ismay" [...] and suggested that the White Star flag be changed to a yellow liver. Some ran negative cartoons depicting him deserting the ship. The writer Ben Hecht, then a young newspaperman in Chicago, wrote a scathing poem contrasting the actions of Capt. Smith and Ismay. The final verse reads: [...] "To hold <b>your</b> <b>place</b> in the ghastly face of death on the sea at night is a seaman's job, but to flee with the mob, is an owner's noble right." ...|$|E

Khánh ended the meeting, saying that he would think about his future.|$|E
2500|$|A {{prominent}} {{theme in}} Slug's lyrics is his allegorical usage of women, especially in his earlier work. A notable use of women by Slug {{is in the}} song [...] "Woman with the Tattooed Hands", which he has said is [...] "a metaphor for that same old shit that everybody has already made songs about. Just trying to find <b>your</b> <b>place</b> within a belief and faith {{as well as people}} that you want to have sex with." [...] Further examples come in the song [...] "Abusing of the Rib" [...] from {{it has been said that}} the [...] "lover" [...] Slug speaks of is actually an allegory for hip-hop itself. In the tour-only release Sad Clown Bad Dub II, Slug used both symbolism and metaphor with references to nature and relationships throughout each song, culminating in the album's penultimate track [...] "The River." ...|$|E
