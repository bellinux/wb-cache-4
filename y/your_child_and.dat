You can have <b>your</b> <b>child</b> <b>and</b> you can still have fun and still be sexy and still have dreams and still live for yourself. I'm not embarrassed about it, and I don't feel like I have to protect that side of me because I do believe that {{sexuality}} is a power we all have." ...|$|E

[...] "Her motto is ‘Make the world your family’ meaning force your mind into becoming loyal {{to the world in}} a way usually reserved for <b>your</b> <b>child,</b> <b>and</b> that’s intellectually daunting," [...] said Thomas. In comparison to the first game's questions of free will and destiny, Thomas said that the player character is [...] "almost the ultimate individual" [...] whom Lamb goads to fulfill her goals.|$|E

[...] Note: Ida Tarbell in her extensive study of lynchings had already established that few lynchings were of black men who attacked white women; many more were committed to defeat an economic competitor or suppress a man behaving too independently.|$|E

60|$|So {{that a child}} {{arrives at}} the age of puberty already {{stripped}} of its childhood's darkness, bound, and delivered over. Instead of waking now to a whole new field of consciousness, a whole vast and wonderful new dynamic impulse towards new connections, it finds itself fatally bound. Puberty accomplishes itself. The hour of sex strikes. But there is your child, bound, helpless. You have already aroused in it the dynamic response to your own insatiable love-will. You have already established between <b>your</b> <b>child</b> <b>and</b> yourself the dynamic relation in the further plane of consciousness. You have got your child as sure as if you had woven its flesh again with your own. You have done what it is vicious for any parent to do: you have established between <b>your</b> <b>child</b> <b>and</b> yourself the bond of adult love: the love of man for man, woman for woman, or man for woman. All your tenderness, your cherishing will not excuse you. It only deepens your guilt. You have established between <b>your</b> <b>child</b> <b>and</b> yourself the bond of further sympathy. I do not speak of sex. I speak of pure sympathy, sacred love. The parents establish between themselves and their child the bond of the higher love, the further spiritual love, the sympathy of the adult soul.|$|E
