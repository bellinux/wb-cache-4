2500|$|I {{think it}} is well also for {{the man in the}} street to realise that there is no power on earth that can protect him from being bombed. Whatever people may tell him, the bomber will always get through, The only defence is in offence, which means that you have to kill more women and {{children}} more quickly than the enemy if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>save</b> yourselves...If the conscience of the young men should ever come to feel, with regard to this one instrument [...] that it is evil and should go, the thing will be done; but if they do not feel like that – well, as I say, the future is in their hands. But when the next war comes, and European civilisation is wiped out, as it will be, and by no force more than that force, then do not let them lay blame on the old men. Let them remember that they, principally, or they alone, are responsible for the terrors that have fallen upon the earth.|$|E
2500|$|Roger Ebert, who {{had given}} the 2007 film three stars, [...] gave the sequel only one, calling it [...] "...a horrible {{experience}} of unbearable length", a phrase which later became {{the title of his}} third bad-movie-reviews collection. Later in his review, Ebert discouraged movie-goers from seeing the film by saying [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>save</b> yourself the ticket price, go into the kitchen, cue up a male choir singing the music of hell, and get a kid to start banging pots and pans together. Then close your eyes and use your imagination." [...] He later wrote on his blog about the film, [...] "The day will come when Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen will be studied in film classes and shown at cult film festivals. It will be seen, in retrospect, as marking the end of an era. Of course there will be many more CGI-based action epics, but never again one this bloated, excessive, incomprehensible, long (149 minutes) or expensive ($200 million)." [...] Ebert would continue to lambast the film (and, sometimes, the Transformers franchise in general) in other movie reviews and responses to letters and emails sent to him. Rolling Stone critic Peter Travers did not give the film any stars, considering that [...] "Revenge of the Fallen has a shot at the title 'Worst Movie of the Decade'." [...] Which he later did name it the [...] "worst film of the decade". Other reviewers, while still critical, were less damning of the film, The A.V. Club gave the film a [...] "C-", complaining about the writing and length, but mentioning the effects and action scenes were impressive. Among positive reviews, Robbie Collin of News of the World remarked [...] "It's bigger. Badder. Boobier. And many other words beginning with B, including boneheadedly brilliant.", Amy Biancolli of The Houston Chronicle called it [...] "a well-oiled, loudly revving summer action vehicle that does all that's required, and then some", Jordan Mintzer from Variety said it [...] "takes the franchise to a vastly superior level of artificial intelligence", and Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly wrote that [...] "Revenge of the Fallen may be a massive overdose of popcorn greased with motor oil. But it knows how to feed your inner 10-year-old's appetite for destruction." ...|$|E

2500|$|Gonzales was a {{ruthless}} competitor with a fierce temper. Many {{of his peers}} on the professional circuit were intimidated by him, and he was often at odds with officials and promoters, {{but he was a}} fan favorite who drew the most spectators. After his death, a Sports Illustrated article stated: [...] "If earth was on the line in a tennis match, the man <b>you</b> <b>want</b> serving <b>to</b> <b>save</b> humankind would be Ricardo Alonso Gonzales."

5000|$|R. Larry Moyer lists [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be <b>saved,</b> just invite Jesus {{into your}} heart" [...] {{as one of}} the things that God never said. Moyer {{suggests}} that Revelation 3:20 ("Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me", KJV) is the only verse that could be considered to support the concept, but notes that the verse is addressed to Christians rather than non-Christians. Moyer argues that the phrase [...] "often conveys the idea that one is saved by saying a prayer instead of trusting Christ." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Mr. Nishikanta, {{you can go}} to hell, sir, and all {{the rest}} as well," [...] was Daughtry's quiet response, {{although}} in the same breath he was saying, respectfully and assuringly, to the Ancient Mariner: [...] "You hold Killeny, sir.

6000|$|... 'Brings me back, sir,' was his exclamation then, with {{a startling}} touch on Clennam's knee, 'brings me back, sir, to the Investments!

6000|$|... "No," [...] said Jordan dryly, [...] "I don't quite think Jimmy will do that. In some respects, I {{understand}} {{him better than}} <b>you</b> do. He <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>save</b> the girl all the sorrow and disgrace he can, but {{he is going to}} run her father out of this city. Jimmy's not exactly clever, and it's quite likely he'll mix up things when he meets Merril; but, for all that, I guess he'll carry out just what he means to do. Somehow, he generally does. That's the kind of man he is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I shan't be pinched. I haven't got a {{score of}} women about me, as you'll have before long. There's {{nothing in the world}} like having a wife. I am quite sure of that. But if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>save</b> money, {{the way to do it}} is not to have a nursery. You'll marry, of course, now?" ...|$|E

Oh, don't think that I never saw what was in your mind. I know very well what brings you here now. <b>You</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>save</b> him. I saw it all many a time at Feldwick, but you've none so much to flatter yourself about. He took little enough notice of me, and none at all of you. He deceived us all, and as I'm a living woman he shall suffer for it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I plainly tell you, Mr. Sampson,' he went on, with {{a manner}} almost composed, 'that I {{understand}} your object. <b>You</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>save</b> your funds, and escape from your liabilities; these are old tricks of trade with you Office-gentlemen. But {{you will not}} do it, sir; you will not succeed. You have not an easy adversary to play against, when you play against me. We shall have to inquire, in due time, when and how Mr. Beckwith fell into his present habits. With that remark, sir, I put this poor creature, and his incoherent wanderings of speech, aside, and wish you a good morning and a better case next time.' ...|$|E
5000|$|The petitioners {{made their}} way into the hall and sat down besides the Montagnards. Robespierre ascended the tribune and {{supported}} the suppression of the commissions. When Vergniaud called upon him to conclude, Robespierre turned towards him and said: [...] "Yes, I will conclude, but it will be against you! Against you, who, after the revolution 10 August, <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> send those responsible for it to the scaffold; against you, who have never ceased to incite to the destruction of Paris; against <b>you,</b> who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>save</b> the tyrant; against you, who conspired with Dumouriez... Well my conclusion is: the prosecution of all Dumouriez's accomplices and all those whose names have been mentioned by the petitioners..." [...] To this Vergniaud did not reply. The Convention suppressed the commissions of twelve and approved the ordinance of the Commune granting two livres a day to workmen under arms.|$|R
