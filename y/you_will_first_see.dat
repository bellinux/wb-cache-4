6000|$|<b>You</b> <b>will</b> <b>first</b> <b>see</b> in how {{confidential}} {{a manner}} Hoolas Roy was employed, {{and in what}} light he was held: that he was employed to carry some instructions which do not indeed appear, but were accompanied by an order from Mr. Middleton. [...] "When these instructions shall come to you, to put these prisoners in irons and keep them without food, &c." [...] The Begums say, without food and water. Et cetera are words of large import; but he was [...] "to keep them without food, &c., agreeable to my instructions of yesterday." [...] This was a pretty general warrant for sufferings. This Hoolas Roy, this mere news-writer, was not only intrusted with this warrant, but Mr. Middleton declares {{him to be a}} person who was to be received there, and to represent the Nabob, and very justly too; for he, Mr. Middleton, was undoubtedly the real nabob of the country. The man, therefore, whom they talk of in this contemptuous manner in order to make slight of an observation we made, and which I shall make again, and whom they affect to consider as a mere paragraph-monger in some scandalous newspaper, was a man vested by Mr. Middleton with authority equal to that of the Nabob himself.|$|E
40|$|In {{this unit}} <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> <b>first</b> how to convert vectors from {{geometric}} form, {{in terms of}} a magnitude and direction, to component form, and then how conversion in the opposite sense is accomplished. The ability to convert between these different forms of a vector is useful in certain problems involving displacement and velocity, as shown in Section  2, in which <b>you</b> <b>will</b> also work with bearings. ...|$|R

But I was in at the Square this morning with Holmeskirk, and I said I was coming down to see you; so the countess--who has a very high opinion of you, my dear, and who constantly inquires after you, especially as she knows, of course, how you stand with Percy--insisted on my taking her carriage and leaving her card. She sent her love, and she hopes that <b>you</b> and Polly <b>will</b> call upon her when you come over to see me; and I can assure you, Agnes, the dear old lady meant it. And now what day <b>will</b> <b>you</b> come? I <b>will</b> send my brougham down any day you like to name, that is if <b>you</b> <b>will</b> let me <b>first</b> <b>see</b> what days I am disengaged." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, {{when you}} get into the Grand Alley, which <b>you</b> <b>will</b> know by its being the broadest, and smoothest, and most splendid grand walk that you ever saw, you must stop for a minute, and look both ways. I'll tell <b>you</b> what <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>see.</b> <b>First,</b> if <b>you</b> turn to the left, that is, toward the east, <b>you</b> <b>will</b> see {{at the end of the}} alley, in that direction, a long range of splendid buildings, {{extending}} across from side to side. In the opposite direction, at the top of a long, gentle slope, a mile and a half away, <b>you</b> <b>will</b> see the grand Triumphal Arch. That is at the barrier of the city. The view is not entirely open, however, out to the arch. About midway, in the centre of the Grand Alley, is a tall obelisk, standing on a high pedestal, and farther along there are one or two fountains. Still you can see the Triumphal Arch very plainly, it is so large, and it stands so high.|$|R

6000|$|... "I am so glad," [...] she said; [...] "so {{glad that}} <b>you</b> are <b>willing.</b> There won't be much to arrange. But <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>first</b> {{have to trust}} me while I go upstairs for my purse." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{had written}} to you, sir," [...] replied O'Moy. [...] "Perhaps <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>first</b> read my letter." [...] And he went to fetch it from the writing-table, where he had left it when {{completed}} an hour earlier.|$|R
6000|$|... "You shall hear it directly--if <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>first</b> {{allow me}} to finish what I wanted to say. I wish--if I can--to persuade you that I come here as a friend, before I mention my name. <b>You</b> <b>will,</b> I am sure, not be very {{sorry to hear that}} you need dread no further annoyance--" ...|$|R
60|$|In doing this, <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>first</b> have to {{meet the}} {{difficulty}} of representing depth of color by depth of shade. Thus a pattern of ultramarine blue {{will have to be}} represented by a darker tint of gray than a pattern of yellow.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you take}} command of one line, Bull; and {{you of the}} other, Macwitty. I don't think that we shall be meddled with but, should any of them return and attack <b>you,</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>first</b> try and persuade them to go away quietly. If they still attack, <b>you</b> <b>will</b> at once fire upon them.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{accept your}} limitation," [...] said Van Helsing, [...] "and all I ask {{of you is}} that if you feel it {{necessary}} to condemn any act of mine, <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>first</b> consider it well and be satisfied that it does not violate your reservations." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite right, Tommy. We <b>will</b> <b>first</b> <b>see</b> what <b>you</b> can do. Perhaps, after all, it {{may turn}} out that you are better as a cook." [...] In his heart Peter doubted this.|$|R
6000|$|He {{put his arm}} {{round her}} to support her. A thought came {{to him as he}} looked at her, waiting in doubt and fear for his reply. 'You shall know what I have discovered,' he said, 'if <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>first</b> put on your hat and cloak, and come out with me.' ...|$|R
60|$|We now {{proceed to}} another part of our charge, which Mr. Hastings has not thought proper to deny, but upon which we shall beg leave to make a few observations. <b>You</b> <b>will</b> <b>first</b> hear read to you, from the 17th article of our charge, the {{subject-matter}} to which we now wish to call your attention.|$|R
6000|$|For instance, {{take the}} two words [...] "fuming" [...] and [...] "furious." [...] Make up your mind that <b>you</b> <b>will</b> say both words, but leave it {{unsettled}} which <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>first.</b> Now open your mouth and speak. If your thoughts incline ever so little towards [...] "fuming," [...] <b>you</b> <b>will</b> say [...] "fuming-furious;" [...] if they turn, by even a hair's breadth, towards [...] "furious," [...] <b>you</b> <b>will</b> say [...] "furious-fuming;" [...] {{but if you have}} the rarest of gifts, a perfectly balanced mind, <b>you</b> <b>will</b> say [...] "frumious." ...|$|R
50|$|Both forms {{will yield}} the same value. The short form uses one {{equation}} as where the long form requires two equations. With the long form <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>first</b> find {{for the fire}} arm velocity. With the velocity known for the small arm, the free recoil of the small arm can be calculated using the translational kinetic energy equation.|$|R
50|$|Parallel {{power can}} be simplified, by recalling the {{relationship}} between effort and flow for 0 and 1-junctions. To solve parallel power <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>first</b> want to write down all of the equations for the junctions. For the example provided, the equations can be seen below. (Please make note of the number bond the effort/flow variable represents).|$|R

"Tell him {{anything}} you will," [...] said Craigengelt, [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>first</b> {{allow me to}} state the inconveniences to which he will expose himself by quitting our society, {{to remind him of}} the obstacles to his remaining here, and of the difficulties attending his proper introduction at Versailles and Saint Germains without the countenance of those who have established useful connexions." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By your leave, Sir Knight," [...] said Quentin, {{who could}} not brook the menacing tone in which this advice was given, [...] "I <b>will</b> <b>first</b> <b>see</b> whom I {{have had to do}} with, and learn who is to answer for the death of my comrade." ...|$|R

[...] "I would warn you that the town which <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>first</b> arrive at is {{specially}} hostile to your people, for the baron, its master, is a relation of Conrad of Montferat, {{who is said to}} have been killed by order of your king." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{are some}} things," [...] replied the Abbot gravely, [...] "into {{which it was}} never {{intended}} that we should inquire. But you have a long road before <b>you.</b> Whither <b>will</b> <b>you</b> <b>first</b> turn?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Instantons are {{the tool}} to {{understand}} why this happens within the semi-classical approximation of the path-integral formulation in Euclidean time. We <b>will</b> <b>first</b> <b>see</b> this by using the WKB approximation that approximately computes the wave function itself, and will move on to introduce instantons by using the path integral formulation.|$|R
6000|$|Holmes {{chuckled and}} wriggled in his chair, {{as was his}} habit when in high spirits. [...] "It is a little off the beaten track, isn't it?" [...] said he. [...] "And now, Mr. Wilson, off you go at scratch and {{tell us all about}} yourself, your household, and the effect which this {{advertisement}} had upon your fortunes. <b>You</b> <b>will</b> <b>first</b> make a note, Doctor, of the paper and the date." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{island has}} several villages, {{all of them}} {{connected}} by a road that runs {{down the middle of}} the island.

If we begin on Saturday, we {{may be tempted to}} desecrate the Sabbath; therefore, as good citizens, I pray that <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>first</b> {{consider}} your duty to your God, and not forget to keep holy His day. The soldiers will be here on Monday. Let us begin our work then, and finish it before the following Saturday night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As for myself, my dear," [...] {{continued}} he, [...] "we {{know the}} old proverb--'It's bad teaching an old dog tricks.' I must decline the Sunday-school, and shall therefore probably decline the hospital also. But I <b>will</b> <b>first</b> <b>see</b> your brother-in-law."

"And supposing I do not {{submit to}} part with what the law gives me some {{security}} for retaining? <b>You</b> <b>will</b> then, of course, proclaim your reasons in the ear of all Florence. <b>You</b> <b>will</b> bring forward your mad assassin, who is doubtless ready to obey your call, and <b>you</b> <b>will</b> tell the world that you believe his testimony because he is so rational as to desire to assassinate me. <b>You</b> <b>will</b> <b>first</b> inform the Signoria that I am a Medicean conspirator, and then <b>you</b> <b>will</b> inform the Mediceans that I have betrayed them, and in both cases <b>you</b> <b>will</b> offer the excellent proof that you believe me capable in general of everything bad.
