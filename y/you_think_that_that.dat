6000|$|... "And, Eleanor, do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> is {{a proper}} letter for you--for {{a person in}} your condition--to receive from Mr. Slope?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't seriously mean, Basil," [...] I said, [...] "that <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> fellow {{really did}} go as a {{stowaway}} with Nansen {{and pretend to}} be the Mad Mullah and--" ...|$|E
6000|$|Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> {{word has}} not been worth an army to the Stadtholder? {{that it has not}} cooled the ardor of the Dutch patriots? that it has not {{commanded}} the vigorous defence of Williamstadt? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I’m {{not getting}} younger, I know," [...] assented Mrs. Chalk. [...] "But if <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that’s</b> any excuse for your goings on, you’re mistaken." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> all <b>that's</b> required?" [...] {{she made}} answer with cold gaiety. But she added more familiarly: [...] "Probably <b>that's</b> the reason. She's so shy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Of {{course you}} did. It was clean out. So was the lbw. I say, did <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> ball <b>that</b> bowled <b>you</b> was a chuck? <b>That</b> {{one in my}} first over, you know.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Now, Mr. Scott, {{have the}} {{goodness}} {{to look at}} the jury, and to speak a little louder. You are in the habit of addressing a larger audience than this, and cannot, therefore, be shamefaced. You mean to tell the jury that <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> note was not intended by you for Mr. Tudor?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very good, Jeeves. We {{will now}} suppose {{that there has}} {{recently}} been some little coolness between this tiger cub and this tigress. For some days, let us say, {{they have not been}} on speaking terms. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> would make any difference to the vim with which the latter would leap to the former's aid?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, first tell me {{what you}} think of this. Suppose two people, both sensitively {{organized}} individuals, loved each other with a love stronger than life. If they were apart, do you think it might be possible for their souls to communicate with each other in some inexplicable way? And if anything happened to one, don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> one could and would let the spirit of the other know?" ...|$|E
5000|$|... e.g., ‘Why do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> I asked <b>that</b> {{question}}?’, ‘Why was <b>that</b> question important?’, ‘Which of {{your questions}} {{turned out to be}} the most useful?’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Which means <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> or hope, <b>that</b> <b>that</b> is all," [...] {{retorted}} Joe laughingly. [...] "Well, Kate, {{there the}} resemblance ends, thank God for Jim!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> Elsa," [...] {{he asked}} more insistently now, and sinking {{his voice to}} <b>that</b> whisper which reaches a woman's ear far more truly than the loudest beating of drum, [...] "do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> now <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are free, you could bring {{yourself}} to [...] . . . to care [...] . . . to [...] . . . ? You were very fond of me once, Elsa," [...] he pleaded.|$|R
6000|$|The {{momentary}} {{charge at}} Balaclava, in obedience to a blundering command, proving what a perfect machine the soldier is, has, properly enough, been celebrated by a poet laureate; but the steady, {{and for the}} most part successful, charge of this man, for some years, against the legions of Slavery, in obedience to an infinitely higher command, is as much more memorable than that, as an intelligent and conscientious man is superior to a machine. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> will go unsung? ...|$|E
60|$|Chairman. Referring to the Crystal Palace, do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> was an {{appropriate}} instance to put, considering the working man pays for his own, {{and is not}} ashamed to enjoy his own for his own money?--I have never examined {{the causes of the}} feeling; it did not appear {{to me to be a}} matter of great importance what was the state of feeling in foreign countries. I felt that it depended upon so many circumstances, that I thought it would be a waste of time to trace it.|$|E
6000|$|... "But I {{must look}} to it, my dear. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> woman, who sits there at Barchester in high places, disgracing herself and that puny ecclesiastical lord who is her husband,--do {{you think that}} she would not immure me if she could? She is a she-wolf,--only less {{reasonable}} than the dumb brute as she sharpens her teeth in malice coming from anger, and not in malice coming from hunger as do the outer wolves of the forest. I tell you, Mary, that if she had a colourable ground for her action, she would swear to-morrow that I am mad." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And I, {{who have}} come hither from California to see you, am to return {{satisfied}} because you tell me <b>that</b> you have--changed your affections? <b>That</b> is to be all, and <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> fair? <b>That</b> suits your own mind, and leaves no sore spot in your heart? You can do <b>that,</b> and shake hands with me, and go away,--without a pang, without a scruple?' ...|$|R
60|$|The {{world know}} {{not the way}} of the Lord, nor the {{judgment}} of our God. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> saints <b>that</b> dwell in the world, and <b>that</b> have more of the mind of God than the world, would, could so rejoice in God, in the cross, in tribulations and distresses, were they not assured <b>that</b> through many tribulations is the very roadway to heaven (Acts 14:22).|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>you</b> {{can easily}} <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> made me prick up my ears, for the {{business}} has not been over-good for some years, and an extra couple of hundred {{would have been very}} handy.|$|R
6000|$|... "Could {{it be that}} I {{should not}} love him? When such a one comes, casting his pearls about, {{throwing}} sweet odours through the air, whispering words which are soft-sounding as music in the heavens, whispering them to me, casting them at me, turning on me the laughing glances of his young eyes, how could I help to love him? Do you remember when {{for a moment he}} knelt almost at my feet, and told me that I was his friend, and spoke to me of his hearth? Did <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> did not move me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Facilis descensus Averni!" [...] {{said the}} Duke, shaking his head. [...] "Noctes atque dies patet atri janua Ditis." [...] No doubt, he thought, that {{as his son}} was at Oxford, admonitions in Latin would serve him better than in his native tongue. But Gerald, {{when he heard the}} grand hexameter rolled out in his father's grandest tone, entertained a {{comfortable}} feeling that the worst of the interview was over. [...] "Win back what you had lost! Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> is the common fortune of young gamblers when they fall among those who are more experienced than themselves?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] he {{pronounced}} at last, [...] "I am rather inclined {{to agree with}} all that you have said. Yet {{it seems to me}} that you evade the great point. The status quo is what we desire, peace is what the world wants. If, before such a war as you have spoken of is begun, people realise what the end of it must be, don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> itself is the greatest help towards peace? My own opinion is, I tell you frankly, that for many years to come, at any rate, there will be no war." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{believe the}} fellow is {{friendly}} to us, but I can't quite make him out," [...] said Cochrane to Belmont. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> he means <b>that</b> {{his name is}} Tippy Tilly, and <b>that</b> he killed Hicks Pasha?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{remember}} what you said very well. If nothing else was to deter me from asking Miss Effingham to be my wife, <b>you</b> will hardly <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> ought to have any weight. The threat had no weight." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why not! Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> {{figure and}} <b>that</b> walk {{were picked up}} in stay-ridden, toe-pinching England? [...] . Ay, in the East; and why not elsewhere? Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> I got my {{knowledge}} of the human figure from the live-model in the Royal Academy?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{can hold}} a torch as she sits; {{it does not matter}} to us if we get wet to the waist, but it would be very uncomfortable for her. We shall have to put the largest burdens on to the mules. One of the riding mules could carry the two llamas, or if <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> is too much, we can tie each across a {{separate}} mule. They were more trouble coming up than all the mules put together. We had pretty nearly to carry them through the deep places, though at other points they leapt from rock to rock cleverly enough." ...|$|E
60|$|WISE. Alas! {{men that}} are wicked themselves, yet greatly hate it in others, {{not simply because}} it is wickedness, but because it opposeth their interest. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> maid's master would have been troubled {{at the loss of}} her, if he had not lost, with her, his gain? No, I'll warrant you; she might have gone to the devil for him; but 'when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone,' then, then he fell to persecuting Paul (Acts 16:17-20). But Mr. Badman's master did {{sometimes}} lose by Mr. Badman's sins, and then Badman and his master were at odds.|$|E
6000|$|Now, it {{had come}} to pass that not a word had been said as to Harry Annesley since the mother and {{daughter}} had reached Brussels. Mrs. Mountjoy had declared that she would consult her brother-in-law in that difficulty, but no such consultation had as yet taken place. Indeed, Florence would not have found her sojourn at Brussels to be unpleasant were it not for Mr. Anderson's unpalatable little whispers. She had taken them as jokes as long as she had been able to do so, but was now at last driven to perceive that other people would not do so. [...] "Mamma," [...] she said, [...] "don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> Mr. Anderson is an odious young man?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that!</b> He says <b>that</b> now; but he deceived me {{all these}} years, {{and if he}} lied {{to me in the}} past, can he not still lie, affirming <b>that</b> he knows nothing of my people, even as he affirmed <b>that</b> he knew not Riolama?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "At {{any rate}} {{you do not}} do so now? Putting aside the grey coat {{there is nothing to}} make <b>you</b> now <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> man and Mr. Finn were one and the same? Come, my lord, on behalf of <b>that</b> man's life, which is in great {{jeopardy}},--is in great jeopardy because of the evidence given by you before the magistrate,--do not be ashamed to speak the truth openly, though it be at variance with what you may have said before with ill-advised haste." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Enough! Indeed it is not. From {{what you}} know of me, do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> it likely <b>that</b> <b>that</b> will be enough?" [...] He was now {{standing}} in front of her, between her and the gate, and she made no effort to leave him.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have never}} been in London at all," [...] she continued. [...] "I really only know what men and women are like from books, or the one or two types I have met around here. Now, do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> is enough to satisfy one? Of course it is very {{beautiful}} here, I know, and sometimes when the sun is shining and the birds singing and the sea comes up into the creeks, well, one almost feels content. But the sun doesn't always shine, Richard, and there are times when I am right down bored, and I feel as though I'd love to draw my allowance from uncle, pack my trunk, and go up to London, on my own!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 134. Supposing it were {{impossible}} to concenter in one great museum {{the whole of}} these things, where should you prefer to draw the line? Would {{you draw the line}} between what I may call the ancient Pagan world and the modern Christian world, and so leave, to what may be called the ancient world, all the ancient sculpture, and any fragments of ancient painting which there might be--all the vases, all the ancient bronzes, and, in short, everything which comes down to a certain period? Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> would be the best division, or should you prefer any division which takes special arts, and keeps those arts together?--I should like the Pagan and Christian division. I think it very essential that wherever the sculpture of a nation was, there its iron work should be--that wherever its iron work was, there its pottery should be, and so on.|$|E
6000|$|... "That will suit me admirably." [...] Mr. Atherton said. [...] "A boating {{excursion}} up {{an unknown}} river {{is just the}} thing I like--that is, when the boat is a reasonable size. I was once fool enough on the Amazon to allow myself to be persuaded that a canoe at most two feet wide would carry me, and the tortures I suffered during that expedition, wedged {{in the bottom of}} that canoe, and holding on to the sides, I shall never forget. The rascally Indians made matters worse by occasionally giving sly lurches to the boat, and being within an ace of capsizing her. I had two days of that work before I got to a village where I could obtain a craft of reasonable size, and I should think I must have lost two stone in weight during the time. <b>You</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> was rather an advantage I can see, Miss Mitford," [...] he broke off, seeing a smile upon the girl's face. [...] "Well, yes, I could spare that and more, but I should prefer that it was abstracted by other means than that of agony of mind; besides, these improvements are not permanent." ...|$|E
2500|$|The second song, [...] "Damita Jo", is {{composed}} of hip-hop and brittle funk. The instrumentation includes bells, cat calls, and rap inflected scratches, with [...] "shyly sexual" [...] vocals. Thematically, Jackson focuses on being misunderstood in the media, in [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> I'm <b>that</b> person <b>you</b> watch on T.V.?", {{and the concept of}} a hidden personality. The song's [...] "tricked-out" [...] lyrics feature Jackson reflecting her different moods, in [...] "sexy, quiet, shy, but down for a good time", and describe her alter persona, in [...] "Miss Jackson don't, but Damita sure would." ...|$|R
6000|$|Come in! It's quite {{dark in the}} parlor, for sister {{will keep}} the [...] blinds down, [...] For you know her {{complexion}} is sallow like yours, but she isn't as [...] brown; [...] Though Jack says <b>that</b> isn't the reason she likes to sit here with [...] Jim Moore. [...] Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> he meant <b>that</b> she kissed him? Would you--if your [...] lips wasn't sore? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But no one {{who knows}} <b>you</b> will <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> Adam. <b>That</b> is not a reason strong enough against a course <b>that</b> is really more generous, more unselfish than the other. And it will be known--it shall be made known, <b>that</b> both you and the Poysers stayed at my entreaty. Adam, don't try to make things worse for me; I'm punished enough without that." ...|$|R
