The latter also produced the song [...] "Green Light" [...] (2006). Jason Goldstein mixed [...] "Kitty Kat" [...] with assistance from Steve Tolle. Concerning the song, Knowles told MTV: [...] " [...] is [...] very sexy , talking {{about a man who}} is out with friends all night and you're left at home. And <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>like,</b> 'No more of this. It's time to go.'" [...] The song appeared online through the website of Rap-Up magazine on August 23, 2006, prior to the release of B'Day.|$|E
2500|$|Non-Arab {{people were}} {{reportedly}} raped by Janjaweed militiamen {{as a result}} of the Sudanese government's goal of completely eliminating the presence of black Africans and non-Arabs from Darfur. The Washington Post Foreign Service interviewed verified victims of the rapes and recorded that Arabic terms such as [...] "abid" [...] and [...] "zurga" [...] were used, which mean slave and black. One victim, Sawelah Suliman, was told by her assailant, [...] "Black girl, you are too dark. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>like</b> a dog. We want to make a light baby." [...] In an 88-page report, victims from Darfur have also accused the Rapid Support Forces of rape and assault as recently as 2015.|$|E
2500|$|For Kierkegaard, true {{individuality}} {{is called}} selfhood. Becoming {{aware of our}} true self is our true task and endeavor in life—it is an ethical imperative, as well as preparatory to a true religious understanding. Individuals can exist {{at a level that}} is less than true selfhood. We can live, for example, simply in terms of our pleasures—our immediate satisfaction of desires, propensities, or distractions. In this way, we glide through life without direction or purpose. To have a direction, we must have a purpose that defines for us the meaning of our lives. Kierkegaard puts it this way in Either/Or, Here, then, I have your view of life, and, believe me, much of your life will become clear to you if you will consider it along with me as thought-despair. You are a hater of activity in life-quite appropriately, because {{if there is to be}} meaning in it life must have continuity, and this your life does not have. You keep busy with your studies, to be sure; you are even diligent; but it is only for your sake, and it is done with as little teleology as possible. Moreover, you are unoccupied; like the laborers in the Gospel standing idle in the marketplace, you stick your hands in your pocket and contemplate life. Now you rest in despair. Nothing concerns you; you step aside for nothing; “If someone threw a roof tile down I would still not step aside.” <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>like</b> a dying person. You die daily, not in the profound, earnest sense in which one usually understands these words, but life has lost its reality and you “Always count the days of your life from one termination-notice to the next.” You let everything pass you by; nothing makes any impact. But then something suddenly comes along that grips you, an idea, a situation, a young girl’s smile, and now you are “involved,” for just on certain occasions you are not “involved,” so at other times you are “at your service” in every way. Wherever there is something going on you join in. You behave in life as you usually do in a crowd. “You work yourself into the tightest group, see to it, if possible, to get yourself shoved up over the others so that you come to be above them, and as soon as you are up there you make yourself as comfortable as possible, and in this way you let yourself be carried through life.” But when the crowd is gone, when the event is over, you again stand on the street corner and look at the world.
