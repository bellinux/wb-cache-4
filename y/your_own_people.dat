"Well, {{you have}} not been saints in the way you have acted toward the darker peoples of the world and toward even <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>people.</b> But, in truth, Mr. Russert, any human being who gives themself over to the doing of evil could be {{considered}} a devil. In the Bible, in the Book of Revelation, it talks about the fall of Babylon. It says Babylon is fallen because she has become the habitation of devils. We believe that that ancient Babylon is a symbol of a modern Babylon, which is America." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 22 November, Erdoğan {{said that}} Assad should {{learn from the}} fate of Muammar Gaddafi. Erdogan said that [...] "Assad is showing up and saying he would fight to the death. For God's Sake, against whom will you fight? Fighting against <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>people</b> is not heroism, but cowardice. If {{you want to see}} someone who has fought until death against his own people, just look at Nazi Germany, just look at Hitler, at Benito Mussolini, at Nicolae Ceausescu in Romania," [...] and [...] "If you cannot draw any lessons from them, then look at the Libyan leader who was killed just 32 days ago in a manner none of us would wish for and who used the same {{expression}} you used." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You had best leave us," [...] muttered a {{voice behind}} me. [...] "If you don't go of <b>your</b> <b>own</b> accord, our <b>people</b> will starve {{you out of}} the place." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{he said to}} the {{question}} in her eyes, [...] "that's my room. You got this one--for <b>your</b> <b>own.</b> It's how <b>people</b> do now. People of our position.... There's no lock." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He's {{none of his}} either--more, I mean, {{than any}} one else's. He's every one's American, literally--to all appearance; and I've not to tell you, surely, with the freedom of <b>your</b> <b>own</b> visitors, how <b>people</b> stalk in and out here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It {{was one of}} <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>people</b> did the hurt, Kadmiel.' Puck's eyes twinkled maliciously. 'So he {{gave the}} freeman a piece of gold, and no more was said.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{should n't}} even say that. When you talk of my {{patience}} you are disloyal to <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>people.</b> Patience implies suffering; and what have I had to suffer?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{the friend}} of a great prince," [...] said the other, sturdily. [...] "But you, Rajah Laut, were even greater. And great you will remain while you are with us, people of this sea and of this land. But what becomes of the {{strength}} of your arms before <b>your</b> <b>own</b> white <b>people?</b> Where does it go to, I say? Well, then, we must trust in the strength of your heart." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well; but do {{not talk}} long, for it may {{prejudice}} <b>your</b> <b>own</b> case. The <b>people</b> whom he has swindled are here to see {{that some form of}} punishment is meted out to him, and it can do you no good to be seen acting as a consoler." ...|$|R
50|$|I {{was a young}} dreamer back then, you know, {{the utopian}} type. The Plaza was my very first {{experience}} with mass demonstrations. It was easy {{to go over there}} because you felt like you were with <b>your</b> <b>own</b> kind of <b>people</b> - no dressed-up people there, nobody was wearing neckties.|$|R

6000|$|... "Why, perhaps, just at present, you are {{too weak}} to move; only wouldn't it be more {{comfortable}} {{for you to be}} in <b>your</b> <b>own</b> house? These <b>people</b> here are all very well, I dare say, but they must be a great bother to you, eh?--so interested, you know, in everything they do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You 've hit it this time, Polly; you {{certainly}} have a gift for putting {{a good deal of}} both articles into <b>your</b> <b>own</b> and other <b>people's</b> lives, which is lucky, as, we all have to eat that sort of cake, {{whether we like it or}} not," [...] observed Tom, so soberly that Polly opened her eyes, and Maud exclaimed, [...] "I do believe he 's preaching." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "People keep {{praising the}} film's 'realistic' {{depiction}} of slum life in India. But it's no such thing. Slum {{life is a}} cage. It robs you {{of confidence in the}} face of the rich and the advantaged. It steals your pride, deadens your ambition, limits your imagination and psychologically cripples you whenever you step outside the comfort zone of <b>your</b> <b>own</b> neighborhood. Most <b>people</b> in the slums never achieve a fairy-tale ending." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you are a}} man, {{you will}} return to protect your kind. You will not run away from one of <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>people,</b> because {{one of them has}} run away from you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Home to <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>people.</b> How nice! I have {{no people}} to go to. I have one sister, who {{lives with her husband}} at Riga. She is my only relation, and I never see her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'You {{had better}} go off, at once, to <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>people,</b> Abdullah. There must be many here who {{understand}} the treatment of wounds. You had better get one, at once, to attend to your arm." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then she paused, but as Isabel {{would not}} be enticed into any further {{declaration}} of independence, she continued, [...] "It certainly is a setting up of <b>your</b> <b>own</b> judgment against <b>people</b> who must know better. As for Mr Owen, of course it will drive him to look for some one else. The young man wants a wife, {{and of course he}} will find one. Then that chance will be lost." ...|$|R
25|$|It dispelled so many {{myths about}} the {{coaching}} business -- {{that you had}} to be a yeller and a screamer to win. You can be <b>your</b> <b>own</b> person, treat <b>people</b> with respect, be very demanding but demanding in a way that doesn't trample on people. And you don't have to give up your faith to win in the NFL. It confirmed and re-affirmed an awful lot of the beliefs I held about coaching....|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{want you}} to set a new fashion: {{you know you can}} set almost any you choose in <b>your</b> <b>own</b> circle; for <b>people</b> are very like sheep, and will follow their leader if it happens to be one they fancy. I don't ask you to be a De Staël, and have a {{brilliant}} salon: I only {{want you to}} provide employment and pleasure for others like yourself, who now are dying of frivolity or ennui." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not know}} that they are in any way better, in that respect, than <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>people,</b> Queen Maclutha. There are good and bad--men who treat their wives well, and men who neglect them." ...|$|E
6000|$|Jefferson's eyes twinkled. [...] "You are a curious, inconsequent kind of man. You worry {{over those}} Spaniards {{who have no}} call on you, and then you propose to bluff <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>people</b> out of their money." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{could never}} go back to live in China?" [...] I said to him inquiringly after a time. [...] "You could never endure life among <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>people</b> after so long a {{residence}} in civilized Europe?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Hip-hop {{journalist}} Harry Allen {{called the}} album a big {{turning point in}} hip-hop where you didn’t have to be [...] "tough". A Tribe Called Quest member Ali Shaheed Muhammad further elaborated that [...] "LL Cool J, Big Daddy Kane, KRS-One, N.W.A, even Public Enemy, had a tough guy image. It was this bravado {{at the time that}} all the hip-hop artists had. People’s instinctive Travels wasn’t any of that. We weren’t trying to be tough guys. It was about having fun, being lighthearted, being witty, being poetic. Just being good with one another. That’s what we presented. Just be. Just exist. Be comfortable in <b>your</b> <b>own</b> skin. <b>People’s</b> Instinctive Travels was about celebrating you, whoever you are".|$|R
5000|$|Adopting {{the name}} Waves, the band—with Gash, Wildman and Marshall on guitar and Matthew on bass—played at folk clubs, cafes and {{eventually}} at Auckland Town Hall, His Majesty's Theatre, the Maidment and the Mercury, playing soft rock and singing four-part harmonies. They avoided the pub circuit, as Gash explained: [...] "They wanted {{something to drink}} to, not think to. So we needed venues where the intricacies of our music would be heard." [...] The band had three writers, with each member excelling at singing or guitar-playing. Gash said the band felt proud playing original New Zealand songs. [...] "Back then it wasn't particularly popular to front up and play all <b>your</b> <b>own</b> music. <b>People</b> tended {{to get a little}} bored with that." ...|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with The Paris Review in 1956, Faulkner remarked: Let the writer take up surgery or bricklaying if he is interested in technique. There is no mechanical {{way to get the}} writing done, no shortcut. The young writer would be a fool to follow a theory. Teach yourself by <b>your</b> <b>own</b> mistakes; <b>people</b> learn only by error. The good artist believes that nobody is good enough to give him advice. He has supreme vanity. No matter how much he admires the old writer, he wants to beat him. Another esteemed Southern writer, Flannery O'Connor, stated that [...] "the presence alone of Faulkner in our midst makes a great difference in what the writer can and cannot permit himself to do. Nobody wants his mule and wagon stalled on the same track the Dixie Limited is roaring down".|$|R
6000|$|... "I go away! He {{wanted me}} to come--he himself did! [...] . You must go away. You {{do not know what}} you are asking for. Listen. Go to <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>people.</b> Leave him. He is [...] ." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{must get}} {{accustomed}} to them, my dear, {{so that when}} you find <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>people,</b> you will not be stiff and awkward; as you certainly will be, when you dress in English fashion for the first time." ...|$|E

2500|$|However, Peniston herself {{seemed to}} be not worried about losing her audience, when interviewed {{at the time of}} I'm Movin' On release by Billboard: [...] "When you're first coming out as an artist, many times label {{executives}} have their own vision for you. But as you move forward, it's only fair that you begin determining <b>your</b> <b>own</b> direction. <b>People</b> will make the change with you as long as you’re honest about your craft and display a comfort for what it is that you’re doing," [...] two years later Peniston actually confirmed her doubts, after being questioned by the magazine: [...] "I can speak about this firsthand, believe me. Sometimes doing what you feel isn’t always accepted by the public. You’ve got to choose {{where you want to go}} and be consistent," [...] (said by the artist at the 5th annual Billboard Dance Music Summit that urged members of the dance music community to work together toward greater credibility, visibility and sales for the genre, held July 8–10 in 1998).|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, certainly," [...] {{said the}} Captain. [...] "I must be--arranged for, and that so soon as possible." [...] The man {{spoke with a}} {{slightly}} foreign accent and in a tone, as Fred thought, which savoured altogether of the galleys. [...] "You have done me the honour, I am informed, to make my daughter all <b>your</b> <b>own.</b> These estimable <b>people</b> assure me that you hasten to make her your wife on the instant. I consent. The O'Haras, who are of the very oldest blood in Europe, have always connected themselves highly. Your uncle is a most excellent nobleman whose hand I shall be proud to grasp." [...] As he thus spoke he stalked {{across the room to}} Fred, intending at once to commence the work of grasping the Neville family.|$|R
