5|$|In 1999, Ravalomanana {{decided to}} {{register}} {{as an independent}} candidate in the Antananarivo mayoral election rather than finance a representative from another party. The president of the Judged by <b>Your</b> <b>Work</b> Party (AVI), Norbert Lala Ratsirahonana, had met the entrepreneur several years prior in relation to Tiko business matters. The two discussed the possibility that Ravalomanana could run as an AVI candidate, but this idea was abandoned. His principal opponent, former Prime Minister Guy Willy Razanamasy of the Association for the Rebirth of Madagascar (AREMA party), suffered from low popularity, leading Ratsiraka to tacitly support Ravalomanana's candidature against the representative of his own party. By contrast, Ravalomanana was an unknown, attracting attention primarily for his considerable success in employment and wealth creation through Tiko, and his esteemed role as Vice President of the Church of Jesus Christ in Madagascar, which was vocal in its support for the candidate.|$|E

30|$|This passage also {{implies that}} if you want to be a {{positive}} and influential leader in the world, first you must get your own life in order. Ground yourself in the universal principle so that your behaviour is wholesome and effective. If you do that, you will earn trust and respect, and be a powerful influence. Your behaviour influences others through a ripple effect. Everyone influences everyone else, powerful people are powerful influences. For perspective of Laozi’s wisdom, we understand if <b>your</b> life <b>works,</b> you influence <b>your</b> organization; if <b>your</b> organization <b>works,</b> <b>your</b> organization influences the community; if <b>your</b> community <b>works,</b> <b>your</b> community influences the nation; if <b>your</b> nation <b>works,</b> <b>your</b> nation influences the world, and if <b>your</b> world <b>works,</b> the ripple effect spreads through the cosmos. Your influence begins with you and ripples outward. So be sure that your influence is both potent and wholesome.|$|R

25|$|Income {{taxation}} has {{the worst}} effect on {{division of labor}} {{in the form of}} barter. Suppose that the person doing job B is actually interested in having job A done for him. Now suppose you could amazingly do job A four times over, selling half <b>your</b> <b>work</b> on the market for cash just to pay your tax bill. The other half of the work you do for somebody who does job B twice over but he has to sell off half to pay his tax bill. You're left with one unit of job B, but only if you were 400% as productive doing job A! In this case of 50% tax on barter income, anything less than 400% productivity will cause the division of labor to fail.|$|E

While some religious institutes encourage their members to withdraw from the material world, Opus Dei exhorts its members and all lay Catholics to [...] "find God in daily life" [...] and to perform their work excellently as a service to society and as a fitting offering to God.

Commenting on the rigidity of his routine, Chabon said, [...] "There have been plenty of self-destructive rebel-angel novelists over the years, but writing is about getting <b>your</b> <b>work</b> done and getting <b>your</b> <b>work</b> done every day.

[...] The two characters went on to have a brief sexual relationship, resulting in Connie becoming pregnant with Sam's child. Once the revelation of Connie's pregnancy had been made, Chambers asserted of the tension between the separated couple: [...] "Some of the scenes with Connie work amazingly well because we do genuinely get worked up and we like {{to keep it that way}} until filming is finished.
