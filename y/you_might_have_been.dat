It is what Pieces of <b>You</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> had Jewel had the musical knowledge {{then that she}} has now. A very satisfying work, all in all." [...] Rolling Stone, however, called the album [...] "overdone and undercooked" [...] with a rating of 2 stars out of 5.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the federalist}} forces in open disarray and the polls {{showing that the}} yes side was going to win, Fisheries Minister Brian Tobin {{suggested}} organizing a gigantic [...] "unity rally" [...] in Montreal. Most of the Cabinet was opposed to Tobin's idea, but Chrétien decided to support the rally, telling Tobin at the Cabinet meeting [...] "Brian-Go!" [...] Chrétien's chief of staff Jean Pelletier later recalled that [...] "We muscled in" [...] on leading the no forces as Johnson, the nominal leader of the no committee {{was considered to be}} an inept leader who would lose the referendum on his own. Facing defeat, Chrétien did an U-turn on the question of a [...] "distinct society", saying in a speech on October 24 in Verdun that the federal government was now open to the idea of recognizing Quebec as a [...] "distinct society" [...] in the constitution. In a speech before the Liberal caucus on October 25, Chrétien acknowledged openly the possibility of defeat, and lashed out at the Quebec media whom he accused of pushing [...] "a big pile of shit" [...] that was allowing the yes side to win people over, and suggested that he might resign if the oui side won. On October 26, 1995, Montreal radio station disk jockey Pierre Brassard telephoned Queen Elizabeth II pretending to be Chrétien; he discussed the pending referendum, but also rambled about odd subjects, such as what the Queen would be wearing for Halloween and placing her effigy on Canadian Tire money. The Queen later said to Chrétien: [...] "I didn't think you sounded quite like yourself, but I thought, given all the duress you were under, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> drunk." [...] The result of Tobin's efforts was the Unity Rally of October 27, 1995, when 100,000 people showed up. On the night of the referendum, the prospect of a victory for the yes side was considered to be so realistic that Defence Minister David Collenette ordered the military to begin contingency plans to defend federal property in Quebec from a separatist take-over should the yes side prevail. On October 30, 1995, the federalist no side won by the narrowest of margins. Chrétien blamed the narrow victory on the Quebec Liberals under Johnson, whom he claimed had betrayed him, and argued the federalists would have done much better if only he had intervened in the referendum earlier, and presented the no case in terms of Trudeau-style [...] "hard federalism" [...] instead of the [...] "soft federalist" [...] no case presented by Johnson, which depicted the benefits of Confederation in purely economic terms, and had a strongly nationalist, albeit federalist tone of language.|$|E
