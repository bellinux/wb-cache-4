40|$|In {{this first}} part of the article the aim is to provide the reader with an anthropoetic key to Wordsworth's poem. Whether the attempt to unlock opens it up to a justifiable {{interpretation}} <b>your</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> the value of the key must decide. It has already been tested on works of Geoffrey Chaucer and Jorge Luis Borges (Wright, 2005, 2007). There is a common habit of referring to the poem as Wordsworth's 'great ode. ' Take Emerson's characterization of it as 'The high water-mark of intellect in this age ' (Emerson, 1983, 928) and Thomas Noon Talfourd's declaration that it is 'the noblest piece of lyric poetry in the world, ' 'a rainbow linking infancy with the realms of blessedness beyond the grave ' (Talfourd, in his essay 'The Genius and Writings of Wordsworth, ' 1820). For Coleridge the task of the poet was 'to combine the child's sense of wonder and novelty with the appearances which every day for perhaps forty years has rendered familiar ' (Coleridge, 1816, 86). For Gerard Manley Hopkins, after his reading of the ode, concluded that Wordsworth was 'one of the very few men, who have seen something that made him tremble ' (Hopkins in one of his letters). There are other people who take a more openly religious line: Mary Wedd, for example, in a recent article, says that the ode resonates with us because 'we are still in touch with the fountain light'; the child may only have had 'a fleeting vision, ' she adds, but 'there is a greater power that is everlasting ' (Wedd, 1996, 156).

30|$|Another {{point of}} {{discussion}} concerned {{the identification of}} a partner. Given the focus on horticulture, teachers were of {{the view that the}} receiving institution would also need to have ready access to a garden where learners could practice skills, rather than relying on a classroom only. Alternatively, the educational institution would need to have access to placement settings in an enterprise. Teachers were of the view that a focus on skills development during the mobility was more feasible, thereby necessitating practical experience, rather than a classroom experience: ‘I will say that it’s going to be more skills-based and it would be either going more to employers or even let’s say in our college we’d have a lot of practical [activities] […] but I would say that it would be more skills and practical-based rather than going into class’. Such an environment would provide a more suitable context for learning, and enable a more appropriate <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> the targeted learning outcomes: ‘It would cover <b>your</b> <b>assessment</b> for workplace and it probably also will cover some skills from food crops and maybe in plant identification and so on’.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} an extended guide to reviewing for ESPL {{in particular and}} geomorphology in general. After a brief consideration of both how we choose reviewers and why we hope that reviewers will accept, I consider what makes a fair and constructive review. I note that we aim to publish papers with the rigour (r) necessary to sustain an original and significant contribution (q). I note that judging q is increasingly difficult because of the ever-growing size of the discipline (the Q). This is {{the sense in which}} we rarely have a full appreciation of Q, and our reviews are inevitably going to contain some bias. It is this bias that cannot be avoided (cf. Nicholas and Gordon, 2011) and makes the job of ESPL's Editors of critical importance. With this in mind, I identify six elements of a good review: (1) an introductory statement that explains <b>your</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> your competences in relation to the manuscript (r and Q); (2) a summative view of the originality and significance of the manuscript (q) in relation to Q: (3) a summative view of the methodological rigour of the manuscript (r); (4) identification and justification of any major concerns; (5) identification of any minor issues to be corrected if you think the manuscript merits eventual publication; and (6) note of any typographical or presentation issues to be addressed although this latter activity is also an editorial responsibility. In addition, I note the importance of a constructive review, grounded in what is written in the manuscript, justified where appropriate and avoiding reference to personal views as far as is possible. I conclude with a discussion of whether or not you should sign your review openly and the importance of reviewer confidentiality. Copyright (C) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|E
40|$|Effective drought {{early warning}} systems are an {{integral}} part of efforts worldwide to improve drought preparedness. Timely and reliable data and information must be the cornerstone of effective drought policies and plans. In pursuit of the goal of improving the effectiveness of {{drought early warning}} systems, participants of the experts meeting were asked to address three fundamental questions: 1. What is <b>your</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> the current status of drought early warning systems? 2. What are the shortcomings, limitations, and needs for drought early warning systems? 3. How can drought early warning systems be improved to better support drought preparedness and mitigation efforts at the local, national, and international level? Participants identified the primary users of data and information derived from drought early warning systems as a first step in evaluating the status of early warning systems. Users were diverse, including government agencies, farmers, extension services, insurance companies, media, donors, NGOs, and the general public. Leadership for drought early warning systems is provided principally by meteorological or agricultural services. In general, where meteorological services were the lead agency, the information tended to be more meteorologically based. In contrast, leadership for drought early warning systems that were more agriculturally based tended to take a more multidisciplinary or integrated approach to monitoring. An integrated approach is considered preferable because information from all elements of the hydrologic system must be considered to obtain a comprehensive assessment of climate and water supply conditions. Although forecasting and monitoring are considered critical components of all early warning systems, there appeared to be little evidence of the beneficial use of that information by farmers. It was noted that few countries currently have a national drought policy in place. Australia is an exception and progress in South Africa and the United States was noted. It was apparent that other countries were moving in the direction of a national drought policy. In some instances, subnational policies were in existence. Comprehensive early warning systems should be the foundation on which national drought policies and plans are constructed. Although many countries have some type of drought early warning system in place, these systems are not comprehensive and have very limited financial and human resource inputs...|$|E
