40|$|The {{morphological}} {{variation in}} 104 local races of plum (Prunus domestica subsp. domestica L.) in the Nordic Gene Bank's Prunus clone archive in Pälkäne, Southwest Finland was examined. Each tree was described using 37 characteristics. On {{the basis of}} fruit characteristics the local races were classified into three main groups. The largest one was the red <b>plum</b> group, the <b>yellow</b> <b>plum</b> group being the second largest. Victoria-type plums, which have not been reported to occur in Finland before and which resemble the English cultivar 'Victoria', make up the third group. Victoria-type plums proved to be fully and red plums partly self-compatible, whilst the <b>yellow</b> <b>plums</b> were self-incompatible.

500|$|In French cooking, plums are an {{ingredients}} in a significant tradition of cake making: [...] "...throughout the districts of the Loire, the Dordogne, the Lot and the Périgord, there [...] hardly a celebration, a wedding feast or celebration at which the dessert [...] not include some sort of plum or mirabelle tart, made with fresh or dried plums or jam according to the season." [...] The Mirabelle plum is a specific cultivar used to make Tarte aux mirabelles (plum tart). A Galette aux fruits {{is a type of}} galette made with yeast dough and covered with previously cooked fruit in season, such as plums (or quinces, apples, apricots).

When made from pomace, it is called pomace brandy or marc. [...] While most eaux de vie from the Alpine regions of Europe only rest very briefly in glass containers, others are aged in wooden casks before bottling. Thus, calvados, an apple-based spirit from northwestern France, is {{required by law to}} spend at least two years in wood, and most producers also offer much older products to the market (up to 20 years or more). Some slivovitz are also aged in wooden casks, giving them their golden or amber color and some additional flavors.|$|R

Raised in an orphanage, Grenouille grows into a strangely detached boy with a superhuman sense of smell. After growing to maturity as a tanner's apprentice, he makes his first delivery to Paris, where he revels in the new odors. He focuses on a redheaded girl (Karoline Herfurth) selling <b>yellow</b> <b>plums,</b> following her and repeatedly attempting to sniff her, but startles her with his behavior. To prevent her from crying out, he covers the girl's mouth and unintentionally suffocates her. After realizing that she is dead, he strips her body naked and smells her all over, becoming distraught when her scent fades. Afterwards, Grenouille is haunted by the desire to recreate the girl's aroma.|$|R

40|$|The {{aim was to}} {{experimentally}} {{evaluate the}} antioxidant capacity of different fresh aromatic herbs (field balm, marjoram, parsley, rosemary, sage, sweet basil), several varieties of olives from Central Italy ('Carboncello', 'Rosciolo', 'Olivastro', 'Coratello', 'Leccino', 'Frantoio') and several types of fresh fruit (apple, apricot, banana, cherry, fig, grape, medlar, melon, peach, pear, pineapple, <b>plum,</b> water melon, <b>yellow</b> <b>plum)</b> using a superoxide dismutase (SOD) biosensor developed by the present authors. Measurements were carried out by comparing the biosensor response to the concentration of superoxide radical produced in solution using a xanthine/xanthine oxidase system in the presence and absence of the antioxidant sample considered. Tests carried out on different samples of fruit and aromatic herbs showed that the homogenised samples had better antioxidant properties than the centrifuged ones (obtained by centrifuging the homogenate), which sometimes gave extremely low antioxidant capacity values. The reliability of the proposed method was checked by comparing the trend of some experimental results found using the SOD biosensor with those {{reported in the literature}} obtained using the classic (ORAC) method. The precision of this method of analysis was found to be good for samples of aromatic herbs (RSD% {{less than or equal to}} 8 %), acceptable for homogenised fruit samples (RSD% less than or equal to 13 %) and less good for homogenised and centrifuged samples (RSD% less than or equal to 20 %) ...|$|R

40|$|A {{significant}} increase in the domestic organic market, especially in Buenos Aires city can be observed in Argentina. Horticultural products represent {{a large percentage of the}} total organic volume traded. Within these, increasingly evident interest in heritage type products, niche type or heirloom can be observed. As the development of these products is almost incipient, varieties of tomatoes were rescued to characterize its production profile for possible adoption by organic horticultural producers in the area of Buenos Aires. A greenhouse trial with 14 varieties of tomatoes was developed. They were: PeaceVein, Ildi Red and <b>Yellow,</b> Black <b>Plum,</b> Chadwick, Saint Pierre, Thessaloniki, TSW 10, Platense Gentile, Money maker, Mars, Uco Plata and the hybrid Koyi (from TheRuiterSeeds) and Elpida (Syngenta).

The results concluded that some varieties are suitable to be incorporated to the horticultural trade as a complement of organic vegetables in the Horticultural Greenbelt in Buenos Aires. The most important varieties were the Ildis ones, with attractive color and piriformis; Black Plum, an old mahogany ovate tomato variety; Chadwick, also known as very productive variety of tasty fruit.

40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] breakdown (GB) and overripeness (OR) remain the biggest internal Problems with Prunus armeniaca L. ‘Imperial’, which makes the biggest contribution to the total volume of apricots exported from South Africa per annum. Prunus salicina L. ‘Pioneer’, an early season South African plum cultivar, ripens quickly {{on and off the}} tree which results in rejections for soft fruit at packing and on arrival overseas. ‘Songold’, a <b>yellow,</b> midseason <b>plum</b> cultivar tends to develop GB and OR during cold-storage in some seasons, which renders the fruit inedible and results in high rejection rates. Prompt cooling and good temperature management are essential to lower the rate of physiological deterioration of stone fruit. In some commercial depots in South Africa, forced air cooling (FAC) of stone fruit can take as long as 48 to 72 h, {{depending on the type of}} packaging. Consequently, the objective of this study was to determine the effect of the rate and duration of FAC on the fruit quality of different stone fruit cultivars. Fruit was subjected to the following FAC rates at a delivery air temperature of - 1. 0 °C to a pulp temperature of 0 °C for 6 h, 12 h, 24 h stepwise cooling and 48 h stepwise cooling for the apricot, and 12 h, 24 h, 48 h stepwise cooling, and 72 h stepwise cooling for the two plum cultivars. The fruit was evaluated after cold-storage and a simulated shelf-life period. The trial was conducted in two consecutive seasons. ‘Imperial’ apricots had the best internal quality after 6 h of FAC, ‘Pioneer’ plums were not affected by FAC rate or duration, and ‘Songold’ plums had the best internal quality when FAC was applied for 12 h and longer. These results on plums demonstrate that cultivar differences must be considered when drawing up handling protocols for stone fruit, as a blanket recommendation may lead to the induction of quality defects...|$|R
