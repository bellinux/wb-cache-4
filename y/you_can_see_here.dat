60|$|It puzzled my aunt that I {{did not go}} westward, {{where it}} was country-side and often quite pretty, with hedgerows and fields and copses and flowers.

That was the stuff to which I turned by nature, to the human effort, and the {{accumulation}} and jar of men's activities. And in such a country as that valley social and economic relations were simple and manifest. Instead of the limitless confusion of London's population, in which no man can trace any but the most slender correlation between rich and poor, in which everyone seems disconnected and adrift from everyone, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>here</b> the works, the potbank or the ironworks or what not, and here close at hand the congested, meanly-housed workers, and at a little distance a small middle-class quarter, and again remoter, the big house of the employer.

Well, two years ago a Miss Vanlo, a very ladylike girl, came from home to keep house for her brother, Fred, who had an engineering shop for small repairs by the water side. Suddenly Falk takes to going up to their bungalow after dinner, and sitting for hours in the verandah saying nothing. The poor girl couldn't tell for the life of her what to do with such a man, so she would keep on playing the piano and singing to him evening after evening till she was ready to drop. And it wasn't {{as if she had been}} a strong young woman either. She was thirty, and the climate had been playing the deuce with her. Then--don't you know--Fred had to sit up with them for propriety, and during whole weeks on end never got a single chance to get to bed before midnight. That was not pleasant for a tired man--was it? And besides Fred had worries then because his shop didn't pay and he was dropping money fast. He just longed to get away from here and try his luck somewhere else, but for the sake of his sister he hung on and on till he ran himself into debt over his ears--I can tell you. I, myself, could show a handful of his chits for meals and drinks in my drawer. I could never find out tho' where he found all the money at last. Can't be but he must have got something out of that brother of his, a coal merchant in Port Said. Anyhow he paid everybody before he left, but the girl nearly broke her heart. Disappointment, of course, and at her age, don't you know.... Mrs. Schomberg here was very friendly with her, and she could tell you. Awful despair. Fainting fits. It was a scandal. A notorious scandal. To that extent that old Mr. Siegers--not your present charterer, but Mr. Siegers the father, the old gentleman who retired from business on a fortune and got buried at sea going home, he had to interview Falk in his private office. He was a man who could speak like a Dutch Uncle, and, besides, Messrs. Siegers had been helping Falk with a good bit of money from the start. In fact you may say they made him as far as that goes. It so happened that just at the time he turned up here, their firm was chartering a lot of sailing ships every year, and it suited their business that there should be good towing facilities on the river. See?... Well--there's always an ear at the keyhole--isn't there?

It's notorious the man has been longing for years to make a home for himself. Only he can't face the expense. When it comes to putting his hand in his pocket--it chokes him off.

40|$|International audienceIn {{the eighteenth}} century and before, the systems of {{measurement}} (length, weight, capacity, currencies) are complex. Moreover, they vary {{from one country to}} another, from one region to another, from one city to another, from one professional milieu to another. This leads to complicated calculations in everyday life, and multiple opportunities for fraud. To give an idea of this permanent complexity, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>here</b> the most common units used in Paris before the French Revolution. While mathematical knowledge is increasing strongly in Europe, including the development of calculus, the paradox is that mathematics of everyday life is handicapped by an archaic metrology with intricate subdivisions. Economic agents are prisoners of this complexity. The non-decimal systems used for all sorts of quantities make calculations very exhausting. Only addition is relatively easy to perform. Multiplication and division are nightmares for bankers, traders, notaries, who must calculate interests, rents and shares. Logarithmic tables, which are certainly useful for mathematicians and astronomers, do not work for multiplication in non-decimal systems. Therefore I propose to present some attempts in the late seventeenth and in eighteenth century to facilitate monetary and metrological calculations. We will see how several types of tables were designed in that time, almost by necessity, to facilitate people's everyday life, especially people uneducated in arithmetic...|$|E

40|$|Jatropha oil ? an {{alternative}} to kerosene Cue: Every evening, millions of families across the world light up kerosene lanterns, especially in rural areas not connected to a national electricity grid. In some countries, kerosene is also widely used as a cooking fuel, and may be subsidised by governments, to reduce dependence on firewood. But in Tanzania, a locally produced alternative to kerosene is gaining in popularity. Jatropha oil is produced from {{the seeds of the}} jatropha tree, a plant found in regions close to the equator, which can grow up to 6 metres in height. Jatropha Products Tanzania Limited is a non-profit organisation which is promoting the use of jatropha oil in the country. Farmers, for example, are being trained in how to extract the oil and use it to meet some of their energy needs. Albert Mshanga explained more to Lazarus Laiser, about how the oil can be used. IN:	?Jatropha oil, essentially, can be used ? OUT:	? energy at our household level. ? DUR?N:	 5 ? 30 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Albert Mshanga of Jatropha Products Tanzania Limited. The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Mshanga	Jatropha oil, essentially, can be used in different ways. It can be used to light a small lantern like the jatropha lamps that we have in front of us here. Also it {{can be used in a}} small stove which has been modified to use plant oil. Jatropha oil can also be transformed into biodiesel and used in cars which use diesel oil. Laiser	Now Mr Albert, focusing on the small lantern which is just before us, will you just describe how it is made? Mshanga	This small lantern is made up of a recycled coffee tin. The coffee tins have been thrown away after the coffee inside has been used. Also we have a glass on top of it which is put there to radiate the light, to increase the illumination of the lamp. And we have the wires which are used for making handles and a frame for the glass. The fabrication of this lantern is quite simple. It is just a coffee tin, wire, and a glass and a copper tube at the middle of the lantern. The copper tube is used as an area where you fix or you put your wick, and the copper tube is used to warm the oil around it, so it makes the oil thinner so it can increase the capillarity of the oil. Laiser	So the tube which is going down there, you say that it helps to heat the oil to make it thinner? Mshanga	It is true that the copper tubes go inside the oil in the tin. The copper tube is used because it transmits heat inside, and plant oil is thicker than kerosene, so you have to warm it so that you reduce the viscosity of it, and hence you increase the capillarity of the oil. Laiser	So you think that this lantern is more cheaper to use than the kerosene lantern? Mshanga	Yes, the lantern is cheaper compared to the kerosene lantern. We did a study on the use of the jatropha oil and the kerosene in the same type of lamp. In jatropha oil, the amount of oil that was consumed in a month was only a litre, but for the kerosene we found that in a month it used three or four litres. And in lighting the lamp, the amount of oil that is used in ten hours, we did a study and found that for the jatropha, only 50 cc went out, while for the kerosene lamp, 180 - 220 cc of kerosene was used in the same period. So economically, this jatropha lamp seems to be more economical compared to the kerosene lamp. Laiser	What also if you compare the smoke which is coming out after burning the oil? Mshanga	As <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>here,</b> the jatropha lantern does not produce smoke. There is smoke but the smoke is very small, you can?t even see it or you can?t detect it. Laiser	I just want to test it. I have a paper with me. Then I would like to test if it has smoke. Ah yes, I have my paper just close to the lantern, on top of the glass, and, how long was it? But not yet, I cannot see any smoke. So compared to kerosene, yes, it is wonderful. What else would you like to tell the listener, about the price of this lantern? How much is it sold for? Mshanga	Currently the price of this small jatropha lantern is 3, 500 Tanzanian shillings. But we do encourage in areas where we promote the production of jatropha, we do encourage farmers to produce oil and various other products on their own. So essentially what we do at JPTL, we teach the farmers how to process the oil and also we teach youth in those areas how to fabricate the lamp. So you will find that, even if you see now the prices are 3, 500, but farmers can be taught how to fabricate the lamp, and they can fabricate the lamps for themselves and also sell to other householders within the community. And also, by teaching them how to fabricate the lamps, we create some sort of employment to the youth, and we do also conserve the environment by recycling the tins. The other thing is you can produce your energy at a household level. Instead of travelling long distance in search of oil; you know that a lot of villages in our country, the infrastructure is quite poor. Carrying kerosene from town to villages, the price goes higher compared to the oil which can be produced at local level, at household level. And you can have your energy for cooking, for lighting, at your vicinity, instead of going outside and depending on oil from outside, we can have energy at our household level.

40|$|Cue: It?s widely {{acknowledged}} that HIV and AIDS pose an enormous threat to food production {{in many of}} Africa?s agriculture-dependent countries. For anyone to die from AIDS is a tragedy, but in Africa, {{many of those who}} are dying are the backbone of the farming labour force. How can those who are left behind, the very old, the very young, the widows and the orphans, manage to grow the crops they require for their own food and income needs? One answer, being promoted by the NGO Africare, is the use of labour saving technologies, that allow cultivation of sufficient areas of land with much less human labour than has been needed in the past. Africare has designed new implements, such as ploughs, planters and harvesters, which can be operated even by old people or fairly young children. Chris Kakunta recently visited a field day in his home country of Zambia, {{to find out more about}} the equipment Africare is promoting. He sent us this report. IN:		?I am here at the Africare ?? OUT:		??You are most welcome. ? DUR?N	 4 ? 58 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Chris Kakunta reporting from Magoye, Zambia, on new labour-saving equipment being promoted by the NGO Africare. Transcript Kakunta	I am here at the Africare stand, Magoye, Mazibuka, some 150 km south of Lusaka. Africare is one of the NGOs that has come to exhibit some of their equipment that they are promoting among small scale farmers at this year?s field day, particularly to small scale farmers who are vulnerable. And with me is Munachoongo Muleya, the field officer with the organisation. To start with Munachoongo, what are some of these equipment that you are trying to promote? Muleya	What we are doing actually, we are looking at two main areas. We are looking at conservation tillage and crop processing. So what we have here are conservation tillage implements and we have post-harvest machinery. Kakunta	How can the farmers benefit from this equipment that you are promoting? Muleya	You know these days, Chris, we are talking of HIV and AIDS, and actually we are talking of farmers who have lost their animals due to Corridor [disease]. And what <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>here,</b> we have the rippers, we have the groundnut lifter, we have the cultivators, we have the weed-sweep. These implements that you see can be used by a farmer who has maybe two oxen. That farmer can use and actually rip the field as much as he wants. Kakunta	Let?s take for instance the ripper, this one, which is looking like a small plough really. Muleya	Actually this ripper that we are seeing here, it?s a ripper that can be used by any farmer, and what we have done it we have just designed this attachment and then you put it onto the usual beam. You know these beams at our farms, the plough beams that we have, you know the farmers have this tendency of saying, ?No, they have brought up this new technology but it is very expensive. ? Everything now we are making, it has to be fitted on the old beam, the old plough beam that we have on our farm. So you just have to attach the ripper to the beam which we have; then you use it to make your own furrows at the farm. Kakunta	When you came up with all this equipment, what was in your mind? Muleya	You know if you go to the villages now, Chris, you only find the old and the young. And actually in the villages there, the people who do most of the work are the women. Now we are saying, since we have the old men there at the farms, we have the old men in the village, if we bring these implements, and you can see on that poster Chris, that?s a poster for a maize sheller, and that?s a poster for a ripper, you know these men they get interested. The next thing you can see there is the ripper planter. Instead of the women following the animals everyday, the man will just put on the ripper planter, put the seed, he will make the furrow, he will plant, and the same ripper planter you are seeing has a covering mechanism. You rip, then it plants behind, and it covers. Then it does three jobs at once. So it will be easier for the old men in the village there to do the work alone. Kakunta	How are the vulnerable, the women and children, the widows and orphans, how are they able to access some of this equipment. Do you have a mechanism in place? Muleya	We don?t give direct loans, but we work with lending institutions like micro-bankers trust, and women finance co-operatives. These people, when we go into the villages, we go with them, and the farmers are able to access money from these lending institutions and are able to buy our machines. I can give you an example; that group that you can see there is Manyama farmers group. They were able to access that peanut butter machine and now here in Magoye, these women are making peanut butter. That means the family and themselves, even their husbands - you can see that husband there is getting interested, because there is money coming out. And that peanut butter, actually, when you talk of HIV and AIDS, they can use it for the porridge, for the children. They can put it in relish. And you know it makes life easier. Kakunta	What about the health concerns. How are you addressing them? Muleya	Actually Chris, on health, it?s not direct, that we go to those people who are directly affected by HIV/AIDS. We are targeting those people who are there in the villages, who have remained. We are talking of the old and the young. You know, the old ladies who are looking after the orphans and those orphans who have been left; we don?t want these people to make excuses, that?s why we have made sure that we have these implements which are labour saving, which can be used by the old women - the ripper can be used by an old man, even a young boy. The ripper will just go, within two hours it will be a hectare. And that woman, what she needs is just to go and put in the seed when the rains come. That means that woman will be able to harvest; she won?t even make an excuse that she had nothing to use, and that?s why she is going hungry now. These farmers have to change with time, because everything is changing. Even the rains are changing. Then why don?t you change the implements that you are using as a farmer? Kakunta	I would like to thank you so much. Muleya	You are most welcome. End of track.

Moore]Malcolm A. S. Moore:Doctor Friedenstein is a person that I think laid the foundations for the substantial areas ofresearch that was carried out subsequently by other people, including Mike Dexter andmyself. We owe him a major debt for his pioneering work and it is particularly exciting for usto have him come to this meeting. It is one of… I think, talking to him, he said the secondtime {{that he has been}} outside the USSR at a scientific meeting. So we'll begin with the first talk: "On stromal-hematopoietic interrelationships. Maximow'sideas and modern models. " - Doctor Friedenstein?Alexander Friedenstein:It's certainly an honour to speak here about Maximow's works in connection with modernproblems of hemopoietic micro-environment. It's also a great pleasure for me to participate inthis meeting. So I want to thank Doctor Neth for giving me the possibility to come to thismeeting. The idea of stromal-hemopoietic interactions was part of Maximow's theory of hemopoiesis,which he proposed more than 60 years ago. Maximow assumed that differentiation ofhemopoietical stem cell descendants depends on what he called "local conditions", which aregenerated from bone marrow stroma. Maximow's theory was far ahead of his time. Andthough Maximow was highly respected in the scientific community, his concept of localstromal conditions was met with skepticism. But now, this Maximow's idea raises no doubt. Itwas directly proved by Dexter cultures and in fact constitutes an essence of problem of thehemopoietic micro-environment as it is perceived in modern hematology. But the main question, that is which of the stromal cells establish the micro-environment,continues to provoke discussions. According to Maximow, the cells in question are the bonemarrow fibroblasts or reticular cells. I'm going to speak about their micro-environmental functions and about possible diversity inhierarchy of their clonogenic precursors. At present, the micro-environmental functions of stromal cells can be analyzed using twodifferent procedures. The first way is to test the ability to transfer the micro-environment invivo. The second way to test the capacity of maintaining hemopoiesis in vitro and to producehemopoietic growth factors. The first model… First slide, please. The first model is {{based on the results of}} heterotopic transplantation, either of marrowfragments or of marrow cells itself, which are grafted under, for example, renal capsule. Andthese grafting results in the formation of new ossicles with the medullary cavity in which therepopulated recipient cells proliferate and differentiate as in the ordinary bone marrow. In theheterotopic bone marrow organs, all the hemopoietic cells, or most of them, are of therecipient origin, which means that they are the cells, which repopulated the new microenvironment. At the same time, there are direct proofs, that the heterotopic microenvironmentis established by engraftment of donor cells, which remain non-replaced by therecipient cells. Thus, heterotopic transplantation makes it possible to test whether the marrow fibroblasts cantransfer and establish the micro-environment. This was done with deployed cultures ofmarrow fibroblasts. We grafted them under the renal capsule. And on the next slide you'll see that… the result was the formation of new bone marroworgans with the medullary cavity filled with hemopoietic cells. And the hemopoiesis, whichtook place in this medullary cavity was also the usual one including proliferation of stemcells, formation of committed precursors, and their differentiation. Doctor Patt has also shown, that dependent of the origin of the engraftment marrowfibroblasts, they transfer not only the general pattern of the micro-environment, but also itsdetails, for example the density of hemopoietic cells in the would-be hemopoietic organs orwhether it would be a red or yellow marrow. So, cultured marrow fibroblasts can transfer and establish the bone marrow microenvironmentin vivo. On the other hand, cultures of pure marrow fibroblasts, as it was shownby Brockbank, may also be used successfully as underlayers for Dexter culture. They alsoproduce, as it is well known, a vast set of hemopoietic growth factors. Thus, marrow fibroblasts are the micro-environmentally competent cells. But their population,most probably, is a heterogeneous one. And the next step in studying the hemopoietic microenvironmentis to find out the genetic diversity of different types of marrow fibroblasts. Atpresent, all fibroblasts, including those from hemopoietic and non-hemopoietic organs, lookquite alike. Next slide, please. There are typical marrow fibroblasts in culture and as you see, they can't be distinguishedfrom other fibroblasts, say from skin and so on. And there are no cyto-chemical markers anddifferences to distinguish fibroblasts of different origin. 2 nd slide, please. All of them synthesize in cultures: one- and three-type collagen. It is the main mark offibroblasts in cultures. They lack the markers of macrophages and most markers ofendothelial cells. However, the diversity of fibroblasts of marrow origin and the diversity of… betweenfibroblasts of marrow origin compared to, say, stromal… spleen fibroblasts certainly exists. For example, if rabbits' spleen fibroblast are engrafted under the renal capsule, they form nota bone marrow or an organ but some sort of a lymphoid organ where no hemopoiesis takesplace and, on the contrary, which is filled with the proliferating lymphocytes and no bonecapsule is found in such a marker. The source for marrow fibroblasts cultures are stromal colony forming cells or stromal colonyforming units, CFU-f. Second slide, please. Not so quick. Well [...] . The colony-forming units of stromal fibrocytes or stromal fibroblasts are tested in such a way,that single marrow. suspensions. are expanded at low initial density in liquid marrow cultures. The precursors of fibroblasts, CFU-f, are highly adherent cells so they stick to the surface ofthe blood vessels. And in ten days they form fibroblasts colonies, which are cell clones. Thisfibroblasts may be passaged in two different ways. First you can passage the total amount ofcolonies or you can passage the colonies one by one. In the first way you get the multi-colonyderived fibroblasts strains because they are deployed and have a high proliferated capacity. Atthe second way you have the single colony derived fibroblasts strains which are the clonecultures. Than the cultures may be either engrafted heterotopically to learn whether theytransfer, or don't, the micro-environment or or they can be transplanted in diffusion chambersto learn the differentiations capacity of the whole of colonies or of separate colonies. It can beeasily shown, that micrological CFU-f colonies are certainly heterogeneous. Second slide [...] . ah, next slide, please. That is… that are individual colonies stained for alkaline phosphatase. You can see, that someof the colonies are negative, the others are positive. Next slide, please. These are from different cultures. Different cyto-chemical reactions can be used and diversityalso exists while using this reaction. Next slide, please. Some of the colonies consist of spreaded fibroblasts like here, the others of blanket cells. Next slide, please. Other colonies are the mixture of two kinds of fibroblasts, or some colonies may be evenmineralized. However all this phenotype differences can not serve as good markers of CFU-fdiversity because they are non-stable during recloning. What I know is that CFU-f differ by their differentiation potential. When single colonyderived cultures of marrow fibroblasts from the red were tested by transplantation in diffusionchambers it was found, that some of the colonies, some of the single colony derived strands,form simultaneously bone and cartilage. Next slide, please. As it is shown here, is the result of transplantation in the chamber of single colony derivedfibroblasts which form simultaneously cartilage and bone, two different things. Some of the single colony derived cultures form only bone or a tissue which resembles thereticular tissue, that one can not be sufficiently sure that it is real reticular tissue. In thechambers, which were grafted with cultures, which form bone and cartilage, some of thisreticular like tissue is also formed. Next slide, please. Here is this reticular tissue in question. These fibroblasts… cultures, these single colony derives fibroblasts cultures differ in theircapacity to proliferate. Those, who are osteogenic and form simultaneously bone and cartilagehave a high proliferated capacity, which provides for non less than 20 cell doublings. Next slide, please. CFU-f which initiate the cultures with osteochondrogenic potencies are supposed to beskeletongenic or osteogenic stem cells. Anyway they are highly proliferated commonprecursors for both osterogenic cells and fibroblasts. The other strains of fibroblasts form onlybone tissue and the less reticular like tissue. The distributions of the CFU-f are as it is shownhere. The most interesting CFU-f are those, which give arise to cultures, which form bone,cartilage, and may be reticular tissue. Because only this single cells derived cultures, whengrafted heterotopically, form bone organs, which are filled with hemopoietic tissue. Thismeans, that they transfer the hematopoietic micro-environment. Thus Maximow's hypotheses, that marrow fibroblasts are responsible for bone marrow microenvironmentseems to be confirmed by using these experimental models. One can be speculated, that several types of marrow fibroblasts are participating inestablishing hemopoietic micro-environments and the micro-environment is a joint product ofa network of different reticular cell types. Next slide. In situ the CFU-f…ah… Well, that is the bone marrow organ or the bone marrow cavity inwhich hematopoiesis takes place, which is formed by grafting of a single colony-derivedfibroblast strain. Next slide, please. In situ, the CFC-f are outside the cycle. They are arrested in G 0 and for a long time itremained unnoticed, that the recruitment into the cycle required stimulation by somehematopoietic cells. It came to light only when the CFU-f assay was performed in marrowcultures from which the non-adherent marrow cells were removed. The results of such anexperiment are shown here. In all the cultures, the marrow cells were planted with low initial density. After one hour thenon-adherent cells were removed and the cultures were cultivated for ten days. Now, some ofthe cultures were supplemented with different numbers of irradiated marrow cells instead ofthe cells which were removed after one hour of cultivation. Other cultures were not supplemented with marrow feeder cells. You see, that the colonyformation in the not supplemented cultures didn't take place. It means, that CFU-f did notproliferate. The cultures were maintained with different concentration of serum: one percent,twelve percent, and twenty percent. And even with twenty percent of serum no colonyformation without supplementary feeder cells took place. But if the cultures weresupplemented with feeder cells, than the usual colony formation [...] . the usual efficient colonyformation could be obtained and it was the high concentration plus feeder-cells were used. Next slide, please. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>here</b> such cultures. This is the not supplemented with feeder cells colony. Andthis was the supplemented one. This is the number of planted cells and this is the same family. Now, what was found, that the supplementing feeder cells, which stimulate the fibroblastscolony formation were simply platelets. Now, I must mention, that this cultures weremaintained with high serum concentration in the medium. That means that they were culturedwith high amounts of PDGF. On the other hand, if PDGF was added into the cultureadditionally, instead of platelets, there was no effect. Which means, that probably plateletshave some colony stimulating factor, which stimulates proliferation of fibroblasts, which areinitially in G 0 period, which is necessary for CFU-f colony formation. Thus the CFU-f colony formation depends on stimulating factors, or one of them, whichremain to be identified and which is produced by hemopoietic cells or their descendants. Thatmeans, that the interaction of hemopoiesis and stromal cells maybe goes in two directions. This stimulation of hemopoietic cells, which is usually meant when we are speaking about themicro-environment, but it takes place also in the opposite direction. The hemopoietic cells canstimulate and maybe are the necessary stimulators of proliferation of the resting stromalmarrow cells. Now to finish my talk I would like to return to Maximow's last work, which appeared in 1928 in "Archiv für experimentelle Zellforschung". It was entitled “Cultures of blood leukocytes:From lymphocytes and monocytes to connective tissue“. This work described thedevelopment of fibroblasts in plasma-clot cultures of blood cells. However, it was laterdisproved on the grounds of two objections. Objection one was that fibroblasts could becomponents of the vessel walls which contaminate blood during sampling. Objection two wasthat they were not true fibroblasts. The problem of circulation of fibroblasts precursors in blood sometimes is discussed atpresent. Objection number one, that means, that the colony of fibroblasts contaminate bloodduring sampling, turned out to be invalid when CFU-f colony assay was used for culturingblood-circulating blood cells. Luria from the Gamelaya Institute in Moscow showed, that numbers of CFU-f colonies incultures or blood cells were in the linear relation to the numbers of the explanted leukocytesand independent from the number of functions, which was made for blood collection. Now, I wish to demonstrate that the cells in Maximow's blood cultures were true fibroblasts,which means, that they synthesize one and three type collagens. Next slide, please. Here are such cultures. You see the individual colonies. Next slide, please. And here are the cells, which compose this colonies. They are typical fibroblasts bymorphology. Next slide, please. This is the other colony, which you see, consists of the same cells of different shapes, but itmeans nothing. Next slide, please. What means is that the cells…the fibroblasts synthesize first type collagen. Next slide, please. And third type. Next slide, please. Well, before showing you Maximow. I must conclude, that it remains not known, where fromCFU-f migrate into blood and were they settle. But their circulation may happen to besignificant for understanding of the role of fibroblasts in establishing hemopoietic microenvironment. Anyway the story about circulating CFU-f demonstrates, that Maximow'sexperimental results, not only his ideas, are so topic that, virtually, Maximow still remains theparticipant of the present day research. That is why I would like to show you Maximow atwork in St. Petersburg. Maximow on the left. Next slide, please. Maximow on the right: he is taking blood from the rabbit. Next slide, please. So he is going to centrifuge this blood. Next slide, please. Here is the beginning of preparing the cultures in plasma-clot system. Next slide, please. Next slide, please. That's the modern thermostat. Next slide, please. That's all. Thank you. (Applause) [...] -Malcolm A. S. Moore:Well, it is really nice to see the father of a field… Two fathers actually – this is another one. Questions? We have a time for a couple of questions. Q: In the single colony transfer experiment, where you had 50 % of the colonies being shownfor competence for osteogenesis, chondrogenesis in the reticular tissue. Did you do anyexperiments which tested whether the cells gave arise to this colonies were able to self-renewand make additional colonies? I mean, did they full range of differentiation correspondedanyway with self-renewal?A. Friedenstein: Do you mean the recloning of cells from initial fibroblasts colonies?Q: Yes. When you did a single colony transplantation experiment some of the colonies wereable to differentiate in to bone cartilage in reticular tissue. Did you do any experiments, forexample. to split colonies and transplant some of the cells and replate some of the cells, to tryto correlate self-renewal of the clonogenic cells with differentiation?A. Friedenstein: That is what we did. We had cultures, which were single colony derived. Q: So, all the colonies that gave rise to bone cartilage in reticular tissue, they're all selfrenewed? [...] . Maybe I talk to you about it after. Maybe it is a bit complex. Michael A. S. Moore: I think he is trying to establish whether there is the question of pluripotentiality,whether the fibroblasts clone can reclone as a pluripotential cell, capable ofgiving rise to all the different components of the bone, cartilage, etc. A. Friedenstein: Yes. Q: They do? All these colonies do?A. Friedenstein. : Yes. It's… Well, what we did is that… Maintaining such single cellcolonies, single cell cultures, we were grafting them into diffusion chamber on differentpassages. That means that the line of the common precursor certainly exists at the strain. Butwhat we don't know whether all the CFU-f, which were generated in such cultures, were alsopolypotential. Q: Ok. M. Moore:Any further question? I would like to mention, that we done some studies with xenograftig ofhuman fibroblasts colonies in nude mice and we saw the same pattern of bone developmentwith an interesting chimaeric situation, where some of the murine components are involved inthe development of bone, e. g. osteoclast and hemopoietic elements with the other componentsof the bone being of human origin.

60|$|We left Rome on the 4th of June, and {{travelled}} by vettura through Orvieto and Chiusi. Beautiful scenery, interesting {{pictures and}} tombs, but a fatiguing journey. At least, Pen's pony and I were {{both of us}} unusually fatigued, and scarcely, {{at the end of}} a week, am I myself yet. I am not as strong since my illness last summer. We stay here till the early part of July and then remove to Siena, to the villa we had last year; and there Pen keeps tryst with his Abbé and the Latin. He has made great progress this winter in Latin and much besides, and he isn't going to be a 'wretched little Papist,' as some of our friends precipitately conclude from the fact of his having a priest for a tutor. Indeed Pen has to be restrained into politeness and tolerance towards ecclesiastical dignities. Think of his addressing his instructor (who complained of the weather at Rome one morning) thus--in choice Tuscan: 'Of course it's the excommunication. The prophet says that a curse begins with the curser's own house; and so it is with the Holy Father's curse.' Wasn't that clever of Pen? and impertinent, but our Abbé only tried at gravity; he sympathises secretly with the insorgimento d' Italia, and besides is very fond of Pen. Poor Pen, 'innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck,' how his mama has been wickedly cursing her native country (after Chorley)! It's hard upon me, Fanny, that you won't tell me of the spirits, <b>you</b> who <b>can</b> <b>see.</b> <b>Here</b> is even Robert, whose heart softens to the point of letting me have the 'Spiritual Magazine' from England. Do knock at Mrs. Milner Gibson's doors till you get to see the 'hands' and the 'heads' and the 'bodies' and the 'celestial garlands' which she has the privilege of being familiar with. Touch the hands. Has Mr. Monckton Milnes seen anything so as to believe? Is it true that Lord Lyndhurst was lifted up in a chair? Does he believe? I hear through Mr. Trollope and Chapman that Edwin Landseer has received the faith, and did everything possible to persuade Dickens to investigate, which Dickens refused. Afraid of the truth, of course, having deeply committed himself to negatives. This is a moral lâcheté, hard for my feminine mind to conceive of. Dickens, too, who is so fond of ghost-stories, as long as they are impossible....|$|R
40|$|Electricity {{from water}} power Cue: For most people, {{particularly}} in rural areas, kerosene lamps and battery powered torches are essential sources of light once {{the sun has}} gone down. But kerosene and batteries have costs, and not only financial ones. Smoke from lamps can cause eye and breathing problems, and batteries can damage the environment if they are disposed of carelessly. And with rising oil prices, just lighting a home is requiring {{more and more of}} household income. In Kenya, the NGO Practical Action, also known as ITDG, has been supporting rural communities to set up small-scale water-powered electricity generators. These work by piping water down a steep gradient and onto a turbine, which spins at high speed, generating electric power which is then supplied to homes. The system is known as Pico hydro. In Kathamba village, on the southern slopes of Mount Kenya, Eric Kadenge met with Silas Muchira Gachoki, Secretary of the village Pico hydro project. IN:	?The project has got about ? OUT:	? with 5 bulbs and 2 sockets. ? DUR?N:	 3 ? 20 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Silas Gachoki, hoping that electricity from a small-scale water-powered generator, or Pico hydro, can be supplied to more villagers in Kathamba, Kenya. The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Gachoki	The project has got about 172 members, and the Pico has already served 58 households, which is benefiting around 1, 500 people. We start by contributing a small amount of money. After getting the money, we started building a reservoir, that?s a dam. From there we bought pipes, then we have the gradient where we build the powerhouse down here. We get the turbine. Then we had someone who came with all those technologies and after getting power that?s when we started supplying to those few members you have heard. Kadenge	What are the benefits of this project to the local people here? Gachoki	In fact to mention a few, my neighbour is used to buying paraffin. He has children who are in school. Every week he is using five litres. A litre is costing now 85 shillings. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> it is more than 400 shillings per week. These dry cells for a radio or a torch are now lasting for one week and it is costing 45 shillings. So per month you are using a lot of money. Whereas whoever is using the power, it is just 80 shillings or 50 shillings the whole month. Kadenge	What kind of geographical environment do you need for you to construct this kind of facility? Gachoki	For someone to have power, first you need water flowing, and it should be flowing yearly, not seasonally. This is not a seasonal stream; it runs all the year round. You need a gradient area, so people has to work hard to get some money because a project like this needs some money to construct a powerhouse. Cables are now costly. You need pipes, generators, the turbine. We need security. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> we have used the metal doors. Kadenge	And the parts that you have mentioned, the turbines, the motor, is there anything that you need to import or everything is available? Gachoki	Now the turbines and whatever are now locally found. Like ours here has never broken down for those years. So mostly you have to grease the machine. So after every three to four months we have to come here and maintain the machine, you grease it, you look whether the turbines are working well. So for sustainability we don?t have a problem. Kadenge	What are your plans in the future? Do you intend to extend it? Gachoki	Our future plan, as <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> downstream <b>here,</b> we have a big river here, just 800 metres from here, from this powerhouse. We want to extend; we have already bought in fact some materials. We have bought pipes, we have bought blocks, because we have to construct a powerhouse there, which {{we are going to get}} about 10 kilowatts there, whereby we will now be able to supply our 172 members with 5 bulbs and 2 sockets.
