Eminem raps, [...] "It's the rage that took over, it controls <b>you</b> <b>both,</b> <b>so</b> they say it's best to go your separate ways. Guess that they don't know ya, cause today that was yesterday." [...] Sady Doyle of The Atlantic interpreted these lyrics as the rapper's confession to having abused Scott, as he [...] "turns the anger and accusations toward himself". In the second verse, Eminem accepts the outcome after feeling sorry, admitting, [...] "Yesterday is over, it's a different day." [...] His frustration increases and he raps that two personalities can clash and devastate: [...] "maybe that's {{what happens when a}} tornado meets a volcano". The described love–hate relationship worsens and leads to domestic violence. Eminem admits to lying about promises he makes and says late in the song, [...] "If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire", a reference to Rihanna's lyrics.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Oh! I'm glad of that. I wish poor Mysie {{had done}} the same. I believe it was what Lady Merrifield intended, <b>you</b> <b>both</b> looked <b>so</b> knocked up.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And for you also, if {{you desire}} it-even {{though some of}} your periods should be spoiled thereby. But why are <b>you</b> <b>both</b> here <b>so</b> early, before any {{business}} is stirring?" ...|$|R
60|$|RAMSDEN. [much perplexed] <b>You</b> are <b>both</b> <b>so</b> full {{of natural}} and affectionate feeling in these family matters {{that it is very}} hard to put the {{situation}} fairly before you.|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{would it}} be, then," [...] I asked, [...] "but what {{you speak of}} as what I've 'found out'? The effort you {{distinguish}} in her is the effort of concealment--vain, as I gather it strikes <b>you</b> <b>both,</b> <b>so</b> far as I, in my supernatural acuteness, am concerned." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly. I'm glad to find <b>you</b> <b>both</b> <b>so</b> {{interested}} in it. Let me {{know about this}} mistake at lunch-time, Morton," [...] he added, smiling. [...] "I'm going for a stroll round the garden now, and I should advise {{you to do the}} same. We've had a close morning's work." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] I repeated, with emphasis, [...] "'of all {{responsibility}} in the premises.' I hope that is plain English, and good English, although I know that Mr. Hardinge {{has been trying to}} make <b>you</b> <b>both</b> <b>so</b> simple in your language, that you turn up your noses at a profound sentiment, whenever you hear one." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I must go now; just {{a little}} stroll, that's all; good-bye! Now don't be {{following}} me, Pierre. Mrs. Glendinning, will you keep Pierre back? I know you want him; you were talking over some private affair when I entered; <b>you</b> <b>both</b> looked <b>so</b> very confidential." ...|$|R
60|$|NURSE. And him keepin' company. And you {{not married}} a year. Ah! Mr. Hubert, now do 'ee take care; <b>you</b> and him's <b>both</b> <b>so</b> rash.|$|R
6000|$|... "Perfectly," [...] he assented, with a courteous little {{wave of the}} hand. [...] "I am {{very glad}} to have come across <b>you</b> <b>both</b> again <b>so</b> opportunely. I only arrived in England a few days ago, but I did not hope to have this {{pleasure}} until the morning at the earliest. You expected to have heard from me, perhaps, before." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah, my sons, {{it is too}} feeling-full to see <b>you</b> <b>both</b> <b>so</b> {{happy and}} again in the old home. I haf no words to outpour my gratitude, and can only ask of the dear Gott in Himmel to bless and keep you all,' cried Professor Bhaer, trying to gather all four into his arms at once, while tears rolled down his cheeks, and his English failed him.|$|E
60|$|I am {{delighted to}} find <b>you</b> <b>both</b> <b>so</b> well {{pleased with the}} Blind Book scheme.[94] I said nothing of it to you when we were together, though I had made up my mind, because I wanted to come upon you with that little burst from a distance. It seemed {{something}} like meeting again when I remitted the money and thought of your talking of it.|$|E

Lady Breton exclaimed, drawing {{herself up}} with much dignity; 'how on earth you, who have always {{pretended to be}} a {{religious}} person, can utter such a shocking and wicked sentiment as that, really passes my comprehension. What {{in the world is}} religion for, I should like to know, if it isn't to teach us how to save our own souls? But the particular thing I want to speak to you about is just this: couldn't you manage to induce Ernest to see the Archdeacon a little, and let the Archdeacon speak to him about his deplorable spiritual condition? I thought about <b>you</b> <b>both</b> <b>so</b> much at church yesterday, when the dear Archdeacon was preaching such a beautiful sermon; his text was like this, as far as I can remember it. [...] "There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death." [...] I couldn't help thinking all the time of my own two poor rebellious boys, and of the path that their misguided notions were leading them on. For I believe Ernest does really somehow persuade himself that he's in the right--it's inconceivable, but it's the fact; and I'm afraid the end thereof will be the ways of death; and then, as the dear Archdeacon said, [...] "After death the judgment." [...] Oh, Ronald, when I think of your poor dear brother Ernest's open unbelief, it makes me tremble for his future, so that I couldn't rest upon my bed until I'd been to see you and urged you to go and try to save him.' ...|$|E

They know that there be holidays and workin'-days; times for every-day wear, and times for feathers and paint. No--no--they look at <b>you</b> <b>both,</b> with <b>so</b> much interest, on account of their traditions." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Before we separate," [...] I began, [...] "I {{have a word}} to {{say about}} the {{experiment}} which has been tried to-night. Two distinct objects were to be gained by it. The first of these objects was to prove, that Mr. Blake entered this room, and took the Diamond, last year, acting unconsciously and irresponsibly, under the influence of opium. After what <b>you</b> have <b>both</b> seen, are <b>you</b> <b>both</b> satisfied, <b>so</b> far?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, yes, yes; and I {{hope it will}} cheer poor Laura {{up again}} a little. Four years has it gone on? Constancy, indeed! {{and it is time}} it should be rewarded. We little thought what you were up to, so grave and demure as <b>you</b> <b>both</b> were. <b>So</b> <b>you</b> won't have the papers to-night? I can't say you do look fit for business. Perhaps Laura may suit you better--eh, Philip?' ...|$|R

Thank you for giving me the encouragement I needed to keep going when it seemed like I had hit a dead end. Thank you for reading, and re-reading my many drafts and responding to my frequent late-night emails with calm positivity and wise, helpful words. This thesis could not be what it is today without your help. I {{would also like to thank}} Chris Schiff. Your jolly attitude and remarkable skills as a research librarian and citation expert helped to relieve much of my stress and anxiety throughout this project. I would also like to thank my parents, for making it possible for me to attend Bates College. Without your loving support I would never have had this remarkable opportunity.

40|$|First and foremost, I want {{to thank}} {{my mom and dad}} for {{supporting}} me, both emotionally and financially, as I continued to embark on strengthening my educational career. Your quest to encourage me to continue my education has gotten me to the where I am today. The value you both place on education and how you continued to instill this value in me while growing up has provided me with a significant motivation to continue this journey. We have been through so much, but our strong, little family has not faltered as we continue to support and love one another unconditionally. Thank you for everything you have given me [...] . you are both truly an inspiration. I love <b>you</b> <b>both</b> <b>so</b> very much. To my sister, Megan.

Thank you for always being there for me [...] . you will always be in my heart. I love you...|$|E

[...] "Ted Stokes brought round a man named Bell this {{afternoon}} so like you that I can't tell the difference.

6000|$|... "But I {{must say}} more. Dear Joe, I {{hope you will}} have {{children}} to love, and that some little fellow will sit in this chimney-corner of a winter night, who may remind you of another little fellow gone out of it for ever. Don't tell him, Joe, that I was thankless; don't tell him, Biddy, that I was ungenerous and unjust; only tell him that I honored <b>you</b> <b>both,</b> because <b>you</b> were <b>both</b> <b>so</b> good and true, and that, as your child, I {{said it would be}} natural to him to grow up a much better man than I did." ...|$|R

But we all like you very much; and as <b>you</b> <b>both</b> are <b>so</b> very young, I think that you might wait with patience,--say for a year. Then come to Noningsby again, and try your fortune once more. That is my advice." ...|$|R
40|$|Many {{people in}} many places mark my path. First, mom and dad, thank you. You brought me into this world and taught me to search for justice and love in the work I do and the {{relationships}} I build.

Thank you for everything you have done and continue to do for me as I walk into this new phase of life—as a husband and father. I love <b>you</b> <b>both</b> <b>so</b> much.
