30|$|Representative {{areas of}} each {{landscape}} unit were then assessed for rangeland quality, using herders’ indicators. To facilitate the quantification of <b>forage</b> <b>plants</b> which {{were used by}} the herders {{as one of the}} indicators for rangeland quality, nested plots (1 × 1 [*]m for herbaceous species, 4 × 4 [*]m for shrubs and 10 × 10 [*]m for trees) were placed at 40 -m intervals along 240 -m long-transects (Mapinduzi et al. 2003). Three to four transects were placed on each assessed landscape to cover a sufficient area. Herders identified <b>forage</b> <b>plants</b> and assessed livestock preference and availability trend of <b>forage</b> <b>plants</b> on each nested plot along transects. <b>Forage</b> <b>plants</b> were categorised as ‘decreasing’, ‘increasing’ and ‘stable’, based on the availability trend over the years as perceived by herders.|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the way of calculation in the application of basic growth mechanics to the ruminant animal, the <b>forage</b> <b>plant,</b> indigestibility increase with forage growth and net assimilation rate of the <b>forage</b> <b>plant.</b> The results obtained were as follows. (1) The mean value over the given interval for absolute growth rate of weight (AGRw) was described using the product of mean weight (W) and mean growth acceleration of W (GAw). (2) The mean value over the given interval for AGRi (AGR of indigestible matter (I)) was described using the product of mean value of I and that of GAi (GA of I). (3) The indigestibility increase with forage growth, which was given by two different descriptions, was described using mean value over the given interval for I, that for GAi, that for W and that for GAw. (4) The mean value over the given interval for net assimilation rate (NAR) of the <b>forage</b> <b>plant</b> was described using mean leaf area (A), mean W and mean GAw.

40|$|Numerous {{research}} {{workers in}} industrial and educational institutions {{throughout the world}} have investigated the process of wafer formation with <b>forage</b> <b>plant</b> materials. The advantages obtained from reducing the volume of material handled and increasing production of animals fed wafers has made the process attractive to farmers. Manufacturers of farm machinery recognized the potential importance of wafers and set about to develop wafering machines and offer them to the farm market. The number of machines sold {{in the western part}} of the United States is in-creasing each year. Although manufacturers and researchers have expended enormous effort in developing forage wafering, there are many unanswered questions about the behavior of <b>forage</b> <b>plant</b> material during the wafering operation. Thus the investigation of the influence of physicomechanical and chemical properties of <b>forage</b> <b>plant</b> material on the forming of wafers thus became the major objective of the research on which this paper is based. A union of the biological and mechanical behavior of the <b>forage</b> <b>plant</b> was sought to give more insight into wafer behavior under wafering processes now in use...|$|R
40|$|The quack {{and wheat}} grasses of Iowa, eastern North America, and the Rocky Mountains are important, {{not only as}} weeds, but as <b>forage</b> <b>plants.</b> One of the most {{valuable}} of these is the western wheat grass, ranging from the eastern slopes of the Rockies into western Iowa. Besides this species there are several others more or less common in the western and northwestern portion in the state. Some of these are considered valuable as <b>forage</b> <b>plants,</b> yet during the past season many complaints have been made of the abundance and weedy nature of the quack grasses in North America. It seems wise, therefore, to consider the quack and wheat grasses not only as weeds, but also from the standpoint of their value as <b>forage</b> <b>plants...</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to conduct analyses of canopy structure of <b>forage</b> <b>plants</b> by applying the golden ratio and the Fibonacci sequence to the infinite series of exponential function with base e used for analyses of production structures in <b>forage</b> <b>plants.</b> The results obtained were as follows. (1) The product of light extinction coefficient (K) and leaf area index (F) in the plant canopy took the value of golden ratio, where K and F were in inverse proportion. (2) The combination of large K and low F suggested the canopy leaves showing a horizontal inclination. (3) The small K and high F suggested the canopy leaves showing a vertical inclination. (4) These phenomena depended on the leaf inclination angle with which upper leaves shaded lower leaves, provided that other factors were the same. Therefore, the case (3) might give the canopy structure that was higher in the production of <b>forage</b> <b>plants</b> compared with the case (2). It was suggested that the golden ratio and the Fibonacci sequence, which appeared in the infinite series of exponential function with base e, were related to the analysis of canopy structure of <b>forage</b> <b>plants...</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{assessed}} national scale {{changes in}} the <b>forage</b> <b>plants</b> of bumblebees in Britain, {{as a means of}} providing quantitative evidence for the likely principal cause of declines in bumblebee species. We quantified the relative value of native and long-established <b>plant</b> species as <b>forage</b> (nectar and pollen) resources for bumblebees by collating visitation data from 14 field sites across Britain. Twentieth Century changes in range and frequency of these <b>forage</b> <b>plants</b> were assessed using data from the New Atlas of the British and Irish Flora (1930 – 1969 to 1987 – 1999) and the Countryside Surveys of Britain (1978 – 1998). <b>Forage</b> <b>plants</b> declined in both large-scale range and local-scale frequency between the two survey periods. These changes were of greater magnitude than changes in other native plant species, reflecting serious reductions in quality of foraging habitats for bees as well as a general decline in insect-pollinated plants. Seventy-six percent of <b>forage</b> <b>plants</b> declined in frequency within 1 -km squares, including those (e. g. Trifolium pratense) of particular value for threatened bumblebee species.

40|$|Globally, {{pressure}} on concentrate feed resources is increasing, {{especially in the}} tropics where many countries are net importers of food. <b>Forage</b> <b>plants</b> are a possible alternative but their use as feed ingredients for pigs raises several issues related to their higher fibre and plant secondary metabolites contents {{as well as their}} lower nutritive value. In this paper, the nutritive value of several forage species as well as the parameters that influence this nutritive value in relationship to the plant family, the physiological stage, the plant part and the preservation method (fresh, hay and silage) are reviewed. The influence of the breed and the physiological status of the animal on animal voluntary intake of fibre-rich ingredients, digestibility as related to gastrointestinal volume and transit time and growth performances are also discussed. The final section highlights the assets and drawbacks of <b>forage</b> <b>plants</b> in pig diets and stresses the need for proper economic evaluation to conclude on the benefits of the use of <b>forage</b> <b>plants</b> in pig feed.

40|$|During spring migration, herbivorous {{waterfowl}} breeding in the Arctic {{depend on}} {{peaks in the}} supply of nitrogen-rich <b>forage</b> <b>plants,</b> following a "green wave" of grass growth along their flyway to fuel migration and reproduction. The effects of climate warming on <b>forage</b> <b>plant</b> growth {{are expected to be}} larger at the Arctic breeding grounds than in temperate wintering grounds, potentially disrupting this green wave and causing waterfowl to mistime their arrival on the breeding grounds. We studied the potential effect of climate warming on timing of food peaks along the migratory flyway of the Russian population of barnacle geese using a warming experiment with open-top chambers. We measured the effect of 1. 0 - 1. 7 °C experimental warming on <b>forage</b> <b>plant</b> biomass and nitrogen concentration at three sites along the migratory flyway (temperate wintering site, temperate spring stopover site, and Arctic breeding site) during 2 months for two consecutive years. We found that experimental warming increased biomass accumulation and sped up the decline in nitrogen concentration of <b>forage</b> <b>plants</b> at the Arctic breeding site but not at temperate wintering and stop-over sites. Increasing spring temperatures in the Arctic will thus shorten the food peak of nitrogen-rich forage at the breeding grounds. Our results further suggest an advance of the local food peak in the Arctic under 1 - 2 °C climate warming, which will likely cause migrating geese to mistime their arrival at the breeding grounds, particularly considering the Arctic warms faster than the temperate regions. The combination of a shorter food peak and mistimed arrival is likely to decrease goose reproductive success under climate warming by reducing growth and survival of goslings after hatching. </p...|$|R
