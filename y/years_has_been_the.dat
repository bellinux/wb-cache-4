25|$|A notable {{controversy}} in Canadian magazine publishing in recent <b>years</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> existence of split run magazines, where a title published in another country, such as TIME or Sports Illustrated, is republished in Canada {{with a few}} pages of special Canadian content, {{in order to take}} advantage of Canadian advertising sales revenues.

The Coca-Cola Company suffered losses during its failed introduction of New Coke in 1985, but soon afterwards regained its market share.|$|E

Since then, the show's focus has shifted to individual characters instead of family groupings. Notable characters introduced subsequently include Carol Meehan, Tracey Kavanagh, Ray O'Connell, and Jo Fahey. Another change in recent <b>years</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> introduction of ethnic minority characters such as Lana Dowling and the Udenze family. However, the Udenzes moved back to England after the father Gabriel was burnt {{to death in a}} fire, and Lana Dowling was kidnapped and murdered. In 2009 an Israeli character was introduced to the show – Avi Bar Lev, Avi hails from the town of Haifa in Israel. In 2013, Ama Chisenga, a devout Christian nurse from Zambia came to Carrigstown, and faced trouble with documentation for immigration. More recently in 2017, two Chilean brothers, Jake and Christiano, came to the show. Jake, who came first, was initially homeless, but later started a relationship with Ama. His gay brother Christiano soon followed, and both now run a coffee shop, Brewers, in the Carrigstown Arcade.|$|E

500|$|The most {{important}} {{addition to the}} building in recent <b>years</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> Sainsbury Wing, designed by the postmodernist architects Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown to house the collection of Renaissance paintings, and built in 1991. The building occupies the [...] "Hampton's site" [...] {{to the west of}} the main building, where a department store of the same name had stood until its destruction in the Blitz. The Gallery had long sought expansion into this space and in 1982 a competition was held to find a suitable architect; the shortlist included a radical high-tech proposal by Richard Rogers, among others. The design that won the most votes was by the firm Ahrends, Burton and Koralek, who then modified their proposal to include a tower, similar to that of the Rogers scheme. The proposal was dropped after the Prince of Wales compared the design to a [...] "monstrous carbuncle on the face of a much-loved and elegant friend", The term [...] "monstrous carbuncle", for a modern building that clashes with its surroundings, has since become commonplace.|$|E

500|$|The United States is {{a nation}} founded by {{different}} ethnicities frequently described as coming together in a [...] "melting pot," [...] a term used to emphasize {{the degree to which}} constituent groups influence and are influenced by each other, or a [...] "salad bowl," [...] a term more recently coined in contrast to the [...] "melting pot" [...] metaphor and emphasizing those groups' retention of fundamentally distinct identities despite their proximity to each other and their influence on the overall culture that all of those groups inhabit. A controversial political issue in recent <b>years</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> question of bilingualism. Many immigrants have come from Hispanic America, who are native Spanish speakers, in the past centuries and have become a significant minority and even a majority {{in many areas of the}} Southwest. In New Mexico the Spanish speaking population exceeds 40%. Disputes have emerged over language policy, since a sizeable part of the population, and in many areas the majority of the population, speak Spanish as a native language. The biggest debates are over bilingual education for language minority students, the availability of non-English ballots and election materials and whether or not English is the official language. It has evolved into an ethnic conflict between the pluralists who support bilingualism and linguistic access and the assimilationists who strongly oppose this and lead the official English movement. The United States does not have an official language, but English is the default national language, spoken by the overwhelming majority of the country's population.|$|E

2500|$|Of central {{importance}} {{in the development of}} architecture in Finland for over 100 <b>years</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> development of architectural competitions, mostly {{under the control of the}} Finnish Association of Architects (SAFA). The first architectural competition was held in 1860, even before the founding of SAFA. Twelve competitions had been held by 1880. It was only after 1893 that the competition system became more systematic, with the setting of rules. Many of the leading works of architecture at the turn of that century were the results of competitions: e.g. Tampere Cathedral (Lars Sonck, 1900), National Museum, Helsinki (Herman Gesellius, Armas Lindgren and Eliel Saarinen, 1902). Sonck was only 23 years old when he won the competition. Indeed, several well-known architects kick-started their careers while still young by winning an architecture competition. Competitions have been used not only in the design of public buildings and churches, but also for various scales of urban and regional planning. Beside Sonck and Gesellius-Lindgren-Saarinen, among the notable careers that began or were boosted by competition success are: Vyborg Library by Alvar Aalto, the Finnish pavilion at the 1958 Brussels World's Fair by Reima Pietilä, Myyrmäki Church (1984) by Juha Leiviskä, the Nokia Corporation Headquarters, Espoo (1983–97) by Helin and Siitonen Architects, the Heureka Science Centre, Vantaa (1989) by Heikkinen – Komonen Architects, the Lusto Finnish Forest Museum, Punkaharju (1994) by Lahdelma & Mahlamäki Architects, the new canopy for the Helsinki Olympic Stadium (2003) by K2S Architects, and the Kilden Performing Arts Centre (2012), Kristiansand, Norway, by ALA Architects. The competition results have been seen to have reflected the international trends of the time, or to have endorsed the critical regionalism, that is, what Aalto had referred to as [...] "being international yet true to themselves".|$|E
