2500|$|According to Tarantino, {{the most}} {{difficult}} part of making the film was [...] "trying to take myself to a different place as a filmmaker and throw my hat in the ring with other great action directors", as opposed to the dialogue scenes he was known for. The House of Blue Leaves sequence, in which the Bride battles dozens of yakuza soldiers, took eight weeks to film, six weeks over schedule. Tarantino wanted to create [...] "one of the greatest, most exciting sequences in the history of cinema". The crew eschewed computer generated imagery in favor of traditional practical effects used in 1970s Chinese cinema, particularly by director Chang Cheh, including the use of fire extinguishers and condoms to create spurts and explosions of blood. Tarantino told his crew: [...] "Let's pretend we're little kids and we're making a Super 8 movie in our back yard, and you don't have all this shit. How would <b>you</b> <b>achieve</b> this effect?

2500|$|If {{evidence}} {{were to be}} uncovered {{which showed}} that George Mallory or Andrew Irvine had reached the summit of Everest in 1924, advocates of Hillary and Norgay's first ascent maintain that the historical record should not be changed to state that Mallory and Irvine made the first ascent, displacing Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay. Former Mount Everest summiteer Major H. P. S. Ahluwalia claims that without photographic proof, {{there is no evidence}} that Mallory reached the summit and [...] "it would be unfair to say that the first man to scale Mount Everest was George Mallory". George Mallory's own son, John Mallory, who was only three years old when his father died, said, [...] "To me the only way <b>you</b> <b>achieve</b> a summit is to come back alive.

If you don't eliminate him now, he'll become a threat to you in the future." [...] Cao Cao asked Guo Jia for his opinion, to which Guo replied, [...] "That's true. However, when you raised an army in the name of righteousness and pledged to help the common people eliminate tyrants, you attracted talented and capable people to serve under you based on your sincerity and integrity. Liu Bei is known to be a hero, so if you kill him when he comes to serve you, you will be viewed as someone who harms men of virtue. Other talented persons will start to doubt you and may even change their minds about serving you. If that happens, who will help <b>you</b> <b>achieve</b> your goals? Therefore, it's imperative that you carefully consider the consequences of ruining your good reputation for the sake of eliminating one man who poses a threat to you."

Believe me Haydon your picture is part of myself--I have ever been too sensible of the labyrinthian path to eminence in Art (judging from Poetry) ever to think I understood the emphasis of painting.
