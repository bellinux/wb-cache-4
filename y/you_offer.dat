500|$|When Madonna {{finally decided}} {{to go on the}} tour, time was short and she had to prepare the show within three months. Auditioning for the dancers started around March 2001. Jamie King was signed up as the {{creative}} director and the choreographer of the show. King {{said in an interview that}} the tour [...] "was so hectic that I suffered from depressions and fell considerably ill." [...] Rehearsals continued for thirteen hours a day, five days a week, with more and more dancers joining for the show. In the end, ten dancers and two backup singers were used. Madonna had her guitarist Monte Pittman teach her to play the instrument, and she played both acoustic and electric guitar live in the show. French house music expert Stuart Price, who had worked with Madonna on remixes of her album Music, was signed as bassist and keyboards player. Clair Brothers Audio support was roped in for providing a mixture of high-tech techno sound and fusion of acoustic and trance. Madonna clarified: [...] "I don't see the point of doing a show unless <b>you</b> <b>offer</b> something that is going to mind-boggle the senses. It's not enough to get on stage and sing a song. It's all about theatre and drama and surprises and suspenses." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lowell was a {{conscientious}} objector during World War II and served several {{months at the}} federal prison in Danbury, Connecticut. He explained his decision not to serve in World War II in a letter addressed to President Franklin Roosevelt on September 7, 1943, stating, [...] "Dear Mr President: I very much regret that I must refuse the opportunity <b>you</b> <b>offer</b> me in your communication of August 6, 1943 for service in the Armed Force." [...] He explained that after the bombing at Pearl Harbor, {{he was prepared to}} fight in the war until he read about the American terms of unconditional surrender that he feared would lead to the [...] "permanent destruction of Germany and Japan." [...] Before Lowell was transferred to the prison in Connecticut, he was held in a prison in New York City that he later wrote about in the poem [...] "Memories of West Street and Lepke" [...] from his book Life Studies.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with the Unesco Courier, anthropologist and social theorist Mark Anspach (editor of the René Girard issue of Les Cahiers de l'Herne) explains that Aglietta and Orléan (who were very critical of economic rationality) see the classical theory of economics as a myth. According to Anspach, the vicious circle of violence and vengeance generated by mimetic rivalry gives rise to the gift economy, as a means to overcome it and achieve a peaceful reciprocity: [...] "Instead of waiting for your neighbour to come steal your yams, <b>you</b> <b>offer</b> them to him today, and it is up to him {{to do the same for}} you tomorrow. Once you have made a gift, he is obliged to make a return gift. Now you have set in motion a positive circularity." [...] Since the gift may be so large as to be humiliating, a second stage of development—"economic rationality"—is required: this liberates the seller and the buyer of any other obligations than to give money. Thus reciprocal violence is eliminated by the sacrifice, obligations of vengeance by the gift, and finally the possibly dangerous gift by [...] "economic rationality." [...] This rationality, however, creates new victims, as globalization is increasingly revealing.|$|E

2500|$|The small-pox so fatal and so general amongst us is here entirely {{harmless}} by {{the invention}} of ingrafting (which is the term they give it). There {{is a set of}} old women who make it their business to perform the operation. Every autumn in the month of September, when the great heat is abated, people send to one another to know if any of their family has a mind to have the small-pox. They make parties for this purpose, and when they are met (commonly fifteen or sixteen together) the old woman comes with a nutshell full of the matter of the best sort of small-pox and asks what veins you please to have opened. She immediately rips open that <b>you</b> <b>offer</b> to her with a large needle (which gives you no more pain than a common scratch) and puts into the vein as much venom as can lye upon the head of her needle, and after binds up the little wound with a hollow bit of shell, and in this manner opens four or five veins[...] [...] [...] The children or young patients play together {{all the rest of the}} day and are in perfect health till the eighth.

I am patriot enough to take pains to bring this useful invention into fashion in England, and I should not fail to write to some of our doctors very particularly about it if I knew any one of them that I thought had virtue enough to destroy such a considerable branch of their revenue for the good of mankind, but that distemper is too beneficial to them not to expose to all their resentment the hardy wight that should undertake to put an end to it.
