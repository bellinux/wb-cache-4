40|$|BACKGROUND: Practitioners often presume {{there is}} {{adequate}} humidification in the ventilator circuit if the <b>Y-piece</b> is at a specified temperature, but control of <b>Y-piece</b> temperature may be inadequate to ensure adequate humidification. METHODS: In an in vitro bench model we mea-sured water-vapor delivery with several heated humidification setups {{and a wide}} range of minute volume (V ˙ E) values. The setup included a condenser, hygrometry, and thermometer. First, we calibrated the system with a point-source humidifier and water pump. Then we tested the water-vapor delivery during non-heated-wire humidification and during heated-wire humidification with a temperature gradient of 3 °C, 0 °C, and 3 °C between the humidifier and the <b>Y-piece.</b> We compared the results to 2 recommended humidification values: 100 % saturated (absolute humidity 44 mg H 2 O/L) gas at 37 °C (saturated/ 37 °C); and 75 % saturated (absolute humidity 33 mg H 2 O/L), which is the humidity recommended by the International Organization for Standardization (the ISO standard). In all the experiments the setup was set to provide 35 °C at the <b>Y-piece.</b> RESULTS: Our method for measuring water-vapor delivery closely approximated the amount delivered by a calibrated pump, but slightly underestimated the water-vapor delivery in all the experiments and the whole V ˙ E range. At all V ˙ E values, water-vapor delivery during non-heated-wire humidification matched or exceeded saturated/ 37 °C and was significantly greater than that during heated-wire humidification. During heated-wire humidification, water-vapor delivery varied with the temper-ature gradient and did not reach saturated/ 37 °C at V ˙ E> 6 L/min. Water-vapor delivery with the negative temperature gradient was below the ISO standard. CONCLUSIONS: Maintaining tem-perature {{at one point in the}} inspiratory circuit (eg, <b>Y-piece),</b> does not ensure adequate water-vapor delivery. Other factors (humidification system, V ˙ E, gradient setting) are critical. At a given temperature, humidification may be significantly higher or lower than expected.

40|$|Background: Aerosol {{delivery}} during invasive {{mechanical ventilation}} (IMV) depends on nebulizer type, {{placement of the}} nebulizer and ventilator settings. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the influence of two inspiratory flow patterns on amikacin delivery with a vibrating-mesh nebulizer placed at different positions on an adult lung model of IMV equipped with a proximal flow sensor (PFS). Methods: IMV was simulated using a ventilator connected to a lung model through an 8 -mm inner-diameter endotracheal tube. The impact of a decelerating and a constant flow pattern on aerosol delivery was evaluated in volume-controlled mode (tidal volume 500 mL, 20 breaths/min, inspiratory time of 1 sec, bias flow of 10 L/min). An amikacin solution (250 mg/ 3 mL) was nebulized with Aeroneb Solo® placed at five positions on the ventilator circuit equipped with a PFS: connected to the endotracheal tube (A), to the <b>Y-piece</b> (B), placed at 15 cm (C) and 45 cm upstream of the <b>Y-piece</b> (D), and placed at 15 cm of the inspiratory outlet of the ventilator (E). The four last positions were also tested without PFS. Deposited doses of amikacin were measured using the gravimetric residual method. Results: Amikacin delivery was significantly reduced with a decelerating inspiratory flow pattern compared to a constant flow (p< 0. 05). With a constant inspiratory flow pattern, connecting the nebulizer to the endotracheal tube enabled similar deposited doses than these obtained when connecting the nebulizer close to the ventilator. The PFS reduced deposited doses only when the nebulizer was connected to the <b>Y-piece</b> with both flow patterns or placed at 15 cm of the <b>Y-piece</b> with a constant inspiratory flow (p< 0. 01). Conclusions: Using similar tidal volume and inspiratory time, a constant flow pattern (30 L/min) delivers a higher amount of amikacin through an endotracheal tube compared to a decelerating inspiratory flow pattern (peak inspiratory flow around 60 L/min).

30|$|For higher {{concentration}} tobramycin (100  mg/ml), the aerosol {{delivery system}} can deliver a higher lung dose.

40|$|Background: If {{at the end}} of anaesthesia, {{the gases}} on the {{anaesthetic}} machine are not turned off, they continue to flow through the breathing circuit and may dry out the carbon dioxide absorbent in the absorber. At the beginning of the next anaesthetic procedure, the desiccated absorbent decomposes the volatile anaesthetic, resulting in the formation of toxic gas mixtures, which are dangerous for the patient. In such circumstances, the measured level of the volatile anaesthesic in the breathing circuit differs from the selected value. In the paper, we analyse potentially dangerous possible directions of continuous flow of fresh gas mixture in different anaesthetic breathing circuits. 				Methods: In {{the first part of the}} study, we simulated the continuous flow of gases in a Sulla anaesthesia machine using an experimental method in a simulation setting. In the second part, we analysed whether a retrograde flow through the absorber was possible in a convential anaesthetic breathing circuit and in the Fabius GS, Cato, Julian and Primus circuits with the <b>Y-piece</b> connector open or closed. Information on users’ requests for maintenance services due to discrepancies between the desired and measured levels of the volatile anaesthetic in the breathing circuit were obtained from the manufacturer’s local servicing agent. 				Results: In a Dräger ISO 8 circle system (Sulla anaesthetic machine) with a standard gas supply connector, a retrograde flow is not possible. If the <b>Y-piece</b> connector is left open, the gases are vented to the outside via the absorber and the inspiratory tube. If the <b>Y-piece</b> connector is closed or open, the absorbent in the canister dries because of the continuous flow of gas. A retrograde flow is possible only in those Sulla anaesthetic machines where the fresh gas inlet is located below the inspiratory valve. A retrograde flow of gases causing absorbent desiccation can occur in a Cato, Julian, Fabius GS, or Primus anaesthetic machines with the <b>Y-piece</b> connector closed. Maintenance engineers point out that problems are reported mostly on Monday mornings before the first operation. 				Conclusions: After completed anaesthesia, the fresh gas inlets on the anaesthetic machine must always be closed. Especially in older machines, the carbon dioxide absorber must be checked before the first operation on a Monday morning. In new-generation machines, we must make sure that the emergency ventilation valve is closed after the end of anaesthesia...|$|E

Our aim was to compare effectiveness of salbutamol and placebo nebulized in NIV circuit in patients admitted to {{the intensive care unit}} (ICU) for exacerbation of COPD.

40|$|Inhalation of {{nitric oxide}} (NO) during {{mechanical}} ventilation is a well-established treatment for reducing pulmonary artery pressure and improving oxygenation in critically ill patients. Currently, NO is delivered {{during the entire}} inspiration or the entire respiratory cycle into the inspiratory limb close to the ventilator. Delivery of NO at the early inspiration during mechanical ventilation has been previously shown to be effective and safe in animal studies. In this study the feasibility, efficacy and safety of pulsed NO delivery during early inspiration was investigated in vitro using a commercially available NO delivery system. An artificial lung model was established to allow measurements of NO concentrations using a fast responding chemiluminescence NO analyser. Automatic flushing of the dead space with ambient air after each inspiration facilitated breath-by-breath analyses. NO was administered into the inspiratory limb 20 cm downstream from the ventilator using either pulsed delivery during the first third of the inspiration, delivery during the entire inspiration or during the entire respiratory cycle. Additionally, NO was administered into the inspiratory limb close to the <b>y-piece</b> using pulsed delivery to allow comparisons between the two sites of delivery. NO target concentrations of 5, 10, 20 and 40 ppm were investigated using pressure and volume controlled ventilation, different inspiration-to-expiration ratios, and tidal volumes of 230, 450 and 750 ml. The data show that pulsed NO delivery during the early inspiration is working reliably in vitro. When applied close to the ventilator, pulsed delivery achieves NO concentrations in the artificial lung comparable to those achieved using the other two modes of NO delivery. When applying low to medium tidal volumes and NO target concentrations up to 10 ppm pulsed delivery yields significantly higher NO concentrations {{compared to the other}} delivery modes. In the artificial lung, no toxic NO or NO 2 concentrations were recorded during any experiment. By pulsed NO delivery close to the <b>y-piece</b> significantly higher NO concentrations can be achieved in the artificial lung compared to pulsed NO delivery close to the ventilator using equal NO target concentrations. In summary, the data presented in this investigation show that 1) pulsed delivery of NO during the first third of the inspiration is feasible and that 2) pulsed delivery of NO distant from the endotracheal tube, while less effective than pulsed delivery close to the <b>y-piece,</b> may still be advantageous in settings where lower tidal volumes and NO concentrations up to 10 ppm are used...|$|E
30|$|Lung {{deposition}} of 15  % reported during volume-controlled ventilation {{is consistent with}} the amount of amikacin measured in vitro at the distal tip of the endotracheal tube using the same nebulizer position and ventilatory settings [7]. However, lung deposition is still low in comparison with other studies using breath-actuated jet nebulizers (15.3  ±  9.5  % of radiotracer deposited in the lungs) [15], continuous vibrating-mesh nebulizers (40 – 60  % of antibiotics deposited in piglets lungs) [26, 27] and a recent breath-actuated vibrating-mesh nebulizer connected to the endotracheal tube (72  ±  11  % of aerosol delivery to a lung model) [20]. The explanation is the nebulizer configuration used in the present study, i.e., connected to the endotracheal tube for a continuous nebulization. It led to a significant aerosol loss during the expiratory time [5]. A more distal position was used in other studies using continuous nebulization (from 30  cm of the <b>Y-piece</b> to the inspiratory inlet of the ventilator) [3, 27]. At the time of the study, the proximal flow sensor was considered as a potential barrier for nebulized particles, implying to position the nebulizer after this sensor just before the endotracheal tube. However, we showed recently that the proximal flow sensor has no impact when the nebulizer is placed at 45  cm of the <b>Y-piece</b> or connected to the inspiratory inlet of the ventilator whatever the inspiratory flow pattern (decelerating or constant) [7]. Both positions could have led to a better aerosol delivery with both ventilation modes and should be assessed in further in vivo studies.|$|E

METHODS: Prospective, randomized study, including 45 patients (ASA 1 - 2), scheduled for elective general or urology surgery. The patients were {{randomly assigned to one of}} three treatments. Patients in group 1 (NDS) received fresh gas flow of 1 litre/min without using additional dead-space volumes.

Ventilator parameters for conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV) included PIP, mean airway pressure (mPaw), positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), expiratory tidal volume (Vte), and FiO 2; for HFOV, these included mPaw, F, ∆P and FiO 2. Vte was measured near the <b>Y-piece</b> of the endotracheal tube in patients[*]<[*] 10  kg (VarFlex™, Vyaire, Yorba Linda, CA, USA). These data were documented hourly. The PF ratio and oxygenation index (OI: mPaw * FiO 2 * 100)/PaO 2) were computed using concurrent blood gas and ventilator data.|$|E
30|$|Materials {{and methods}} Experimental {{prospective}} study, randomised in cross-over of healthy volunteers from March to July 2016, in Caen university hospital. None {{of them were}} obese, smoked or had a chronic lung disease. Healthy volunteers conducted a preoxygenation with fraction of inspired oxygen at 100 %: spontaneous ventilation (SV) and noninvasive ventilation (NIV, pressure support + 6  cmH 2 O and PEEP + 5  cmH 2 O) without and with calibrated leak (SV-leak and NIV-leak). From the volunteer mouth at respirator, subjects breathed through a mouthpiece (with a nose clip), mount catheter, antibacterial filter and <b>Y-piece</b> of respirator. In modes of ventilation with calibrated leaks, the leak was placed on mount catheter. The leak was characterized as a turbulent flow with the flow/pressure curve. The fraction of expired oxygen (FeO 2), changes in respiratory rate and end-tidal of carbon dioxide were measured. A PreOx was deemed effective if FeO 2  >  90 %. The primary endpoint {{was the time to}} achieve a FeO 2  >  90 %. The secondary endpoint was the proportion of subject with FeO 2  >  90 % at the third minute.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Pressure support {{ventilation}} (PSV) {{should be}} applied so that the inspiratory muscles are unloaded appropriately. We developed a computerized advisory system that assesses the load on the inspiratory muscles to spontaneously inhale, reflected by the automatically and noninvasively measured work of breathing per minute, and tolerance for that load, reflected by spontaneous breathing frequency and tidal volume, in a fuzzy-logic algorithm that provides rec-ommendations for setting PSV. We call this a load and tolerance strategy for determining PSV. METHODS: In a clinical validation study, we compared the recommendations from our PSV advisory system to the recommendations of experienced critical-care Registered Respiratory Ther-apists (RRTs) for setting PSV in patients with respiratory failure. With 76 adult patients in a university medical center surgical intensive care unit receiving PSV, a combined pressure/flow sensor, positioned between the endotracheal tube and patient <b>Y-piece,</b> sent measurements to the PSV advisory system. We compared the advisory system’s recommendations (increase, maintain, or decrease the pressure support) to the RRTs ’ recommendations at the bedside. RESULTS: There {{were no significant differences}} between the RRTs ’ and the advisory system’s recommendations (n 109) to increase, maintain, or decrease PSV. The RRTs agreed with 91 % of the advisor...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Introduction: Dead space {{negatively}} influences {{carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) elimination, particularly at high respiratory rates (RR) used at low tidal volume ventilation in {{acute respiratory distress}} syndrome (ARDS). Aspiration of dead space (ASPIDS), a known method for dead space reduction, comprises two mechanisms activated during late expiration: aspiration of gas {{from the tip of}} the tracheal tube and gas injection through the inspiratory line - circuit flushing. The objective was to study the efficiency of circuit flushing alone and of ASPIDS at wide combinations of RR and tidal volume (VT) in anaesthetized pigs. The hypothesis was tested that circuit flushing and ASPIDS are particularly efficient at high RR. Methods: In Part 1 of the study, RR and VT were, with a computer-controlled ventilator, modified for one breath at a time without changing minute ventilation. Proximal dead space in a <b>y-piece</b> and ventilator tubing (VDaw,prox) was measured. In part two, changes in CO 2 partial pressure (PaCO 2) during prolonged periods of circuit flushing and ASPIDS were studied at RR 20, 40 and 60 minutes- 1. Results: In Part 1, VDaw,prox was 7. 6 ± 0. 5...|$|E

Background. While heat and moisture exchangers (HMEs) have been increasingly used for humidification during mechanical ventilation, the efficacy of pediatric HMEs {{has not yet been}} fully evaluated. Methods. We tested ten pediatric HMEs when mechanically ventilating a model lung at respiratory rates of 20 and 30 breaths/min and pressure control of 10, 15, and 20 cmH 2 O. The expiratory gas passed through a heated humidifier. We created two rates of leakage: 3. 2 L/min (small) and 5. 1 L/min (large) when pressure was 10 cmH 2 O. We measured absolute humidity (AH) at the <b>Y-piece.</b> Results. Without leakage, eight of ten HMEs maintained AH at more than 30 mg/L. With the small leak, AH decreased below 30 mg/L (26. 6 to 29. 5 mg/L), decreasing further (19. 7 to 27. 3 mg/L) with the large leak. Respiratory rate and pressure control level did not affect AH values. Conclusions. Pediatric HMEs provide adequate humidification performance when leakage is absent. 1...|$|E
40|$|In adult {{high-frequency}} oscillatory ventilation (HFOV), {{stroke volume}} (SV) and mean lung pressure (PLung) {{are important for}} lung protection. We measured the airway pressure at the <b>Y-piece</b> and the lung pressure during HFOV using a lung model and HFOV ventilators for adults (R 100 and 3100 B). The lung model was made of a 20 -liter, airtight rigid plastic container (adiabatic compliance: 19. 3 ml/cmH 2 O) {{with or without a}} resistor (20 cmH 2 O/l/sec). The ventilator settings were as follows: mean airway pressure (MAP), 30 cmH 2 O;frequency, 5 - 15 Hz (every 1 Hz);airway pressure amplitude (AMP), maximum;and % of inspiratory time (IT), 50 % for R 100, 33 % or 50 % for 3100 B. The measurements were also performed with an AMP of 2 / 3 or 1 / 3 maximum at 5, 10 and 15 Hz. The PLung and the measured MAP were not consistently identical to the setting MAP in either ventilator, and decreasing IT decreased the PLung in 3100 B. In conclusion, we must pay attention to the possible discrepancy between the PLung and the setting MAP during adult HFOV...|$|E
30|$|Our {{study has}} several limitations. First, {{extrapolation}} of our results is limited {{due to the}} nebulization performed in patients with healthy lungs, using a radiotracer instead of a relevant drug, using a minimal mandatory sedation during pressure support ventilation and a ventilator circuit without heated and humidifier system. However, {{the aim of the}} study was to focus on the effect of mechanical ventilation on nebulization efficiency and not on its clinical benefit. Second, the continuous nebulizer was connected to the endotracheal tube. At the beginning of the study, the distal position was not known as the optimal position to reduce aerosol loss considering the presence of the proximal flow sensor on the ventilator circuit [7]. Further clinical study with nebulizer positioned at 30, 45  cm above the <b>Y-piece</b> or at the inspiratory outlet of the ventilator is required. Third, quantification was performed based on counts derived from a single anterior planar image instead of a geometric mean of anterior and posterior counts that could decrease the accuracy of the quantification [23]. Safety concern imposed to avoid patient’s transfer to the examination table and posterior images of the lungs could not be acquired due to bed structure; this bias, if of any relevance, was, however, constant for all patients in both groups.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background In {{mechanically}} ventilated patients, {{we investigated}} how positioning {{the heat and}} moisture exchanger (HME) at different places on the ventilator circuit affected inspiratory gas humidification. Methods Absolute humidity (AH) and temperature (TEMP) at the proximal end of endotracheal tube (ETT) were measured in ten mechanically ventilated patients. The HME was connected either directly proximal to the ETT (Site 1) or at before the circuit <b>Y-piece</b> (Site 2 : distance from proximal end of ETT and Site 2 was about 19 cm) (Figure. 1). Two devices, Hygrobac S (Mallinckrodt Dar, Mirandola, Italy) and Thermovent HEPA (Smiths Medical International Ltd., Kent, UK) were tested. AH and TEMP were measured with a hygrometer (Moiscope, MERA Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Results Hygrobac S provided significantly higher AH and TEMP at both sites than Thermovent HEPA. Both Hygrobac S and with Thermovent HEPA provided significantly higher AH and TEMP when placed proximally to the ETT. Conclusion Although placement proximal to the ETT improved both AH and TEMP in both HMEs tested, one HME performed better in the distal position than the other HME in the proximal position. We conclude the both the type and placement of HME can make {{a significant difference in}} maintaining AH and TEMP during adult ventilation. </p...|$|E
