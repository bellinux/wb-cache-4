5|$|Clay {{attempts}} to romance Rain Turner, a gorgeous young woman auditioning {{for a role}} in his new film, leading her on {{with the promise of}} being cast, all the while knowing she is too old for the part. His narration reveals he has done this with a number {{of men and women in}} the past, and yet often comes out of the relationship hurt and damaged himself. Over the course of their relationship, he is stalked by unknown persons driving a Jeep and is frequently reminded by various individuals of the grisly murder of a <b>young</b> <b>producer</b> whom he knew. Clay disinterestedly watches a snuff film of the murder—later attributed to Rip—on his iPhone.|$|E

25|$|During the {{production}} of Johnny Oro, Sergio Corbucci was approached by Manolo Bolognini, an ambitious <b>young</b> <b>producer</b> who had previously worked as Pier Paolo Pasolini's production manager on The Gospel According to St. Matthew, to write and direct a Spaghetti Western that would recoup the losses of his first film as producer, The Possessed. Corbucci immediately accepted Bolognini's offer, leaving Johnny Oro {{to be completed by}} others. The director wanted to create a film inspired by Akira Kurosawa's Yojimbo, which he had seen two years prior on recommendation from his regular cinematographer, Enzo Barboni. Corbucci also wanted to make a film that would rival the success of A Fistful of Dollars, a Yojimbo adaptation directed by his friend Sergio Leone. According to Ruggero Deodato, Corbucci's assistant director, the director borrowed the idea of a protagonist who dragged a coffin behind him from a comic magazine he found on a news-stand in Via Veneto, Rome.|$|E

[...] After Pinter mentioned {{that he had an}} idea for a play, Woolf asked him to write it so that he could direct it to fulfill a requirement for his postgraduate work. Pinter wrote it in three days. The production was described by Billington as [...] "a staggeringly confident debut which attracted the attention of a <b>young</b> <b>producer,</b> Michael Codron, who decided to present Pinter's next play, The Birthday Party, at the Lyric Hammersmith, in 1958." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1992, Wearing {{was able}} to persuade the then-controller of BBC Two, Alan Yentob, to {{commission}} Peter Flannery to write scripts for {{a new version of}} the project. However, Yentob had no great enthusiasm for Our Friends in the North, as he remembered a meeting with Flannery in 1988, when the writer had left him unimpressed by stating that Our Friends in the North was about [...] "post-war social housing policy." [...] As Wearing was now a head of department at the BBC he was too busy overseeing other projects to produce Our Friends in the North personally. George Faber was briefly attached to the project as producer before he moved on to become Head of Single Drama at the BBC. Faber was succeeded by a <b>young</b> <b>producer</b> with great enthusiasm for the project, Charles Pattinson.|$|E

The band wrote new material prodigiously; lead guitarist Peter Buck recalled, [...] "We were going through this streak where we were writing two good songs a week [...] We {{just wanted to do}} it; whenever we had a new batch of songs, it was time to record". Due to the number of new songs the band had, Buck unsuccessfully tried to convince everyone to make the next album a double album. In November 1983, the band recorded 22 songs during a session with Neil <b>Young</b> <b>producer</b> Elliot Mazer in San Francisco. While Mazer was briefly considered as a candidate to produce the band's next album, R.E.M. ultimately decided to team up again with Murmur producers Mitch Easter and Don Dixon.|$|E

She and her R group, Sista, auditioned for DeVante Swing, a producer {{and member of the}} successful R act Jodeci. DeVante signed Sista to his Swing Mob record label and Elliott brought Mosley and Barcliff along with her to New York, where Swing Mob was based.

Through him, she met with then upcoming <b>young</b> <b>producer</b> from Atlanta called Dallas Austin, who had become famous {{for his work on}} girl group TLC's debut album, Ooooooohhh... On the TLC Tip (1992). Together they composed two songs for the album, [...] "Secret" [...] and [...] "Sanctuary". The former was originally produced in its demo form by Pettibone, under the name [...] "Something's Coming Over Me", however Austin reworked the demo and made it a different song musically. On September 27, 1994, the song was released as the lead single from Bedtime Stories. The cover art of the single showed a new look for Madonna, with blonde hair and style compared to the look of 1930s American actress, Jean Harlow. Shot by photographer Patrick Demarchelier in black-and-white, the image showed the singer slouched on a sofa with her dress down and revealing her translucent brassiere. Unusual for the mid-1990s, Madonna talked about the new single on the Internet leaving an audio message for her fans, as well as a snippet of the song.|$|E

2500|$|Early {{companies}} {{formed by}} Calder and Simon were Sagittarius Management and Clive Calder Productions (CCP). [...] CCP was distributed by EMI Records South Africa who purchased {{the company in}} 1972. [...] Although Calder has no stake in it now, it still exists as a wholly owned subsidiary of EMI, specializing in the recording, development and marketing of domestic artists.

2500|$|In late 1965, after {{numerous}} car-club dances, juke joint gigs, {{appearances at}} the Avalon Ballroom {{and winning the}} Teenage Fair Battle of the Bands, the group finally bagged a contract for recording two singles with the newly created A Records label with Leonard Grant as their manager. It was {{at this time that}} musical relationships had also been struck with members of Rising Sons who would later feature in the band's recordings. The A deal also brought some contention between members of the band, torn between a career as an experimental [...] "pop" [...] group and that of a purist blues band. Working with <b>young</b> <b>producer</b> David Gates also opened up horizons for Vliet's skills as a poet-cum-lyricist, with his [...] "Who Do You Think You're Fooling" [...] on the flipside of the band's first single, a cover of the Ellas McDaniel/Willie Dixon-penned hit, [...] "Diddy Wah Diddy". Fate and circumstance, not for the first time, would befall the band's success upon its release – which coincided with a singles cover of the same song by the Remains. The initial line-up of the Magic Band that entered the studio for the A recordings was not that which emerged by the second release, [...] "Moonchild", also backed by a Vliet-penned number, [...] "Frying Pan". A 12" [...] vinyl 45rpm mono EP/mono mini-cassette tape was later released in 1987, with the four tracks of the two singles, plus [...] "Here I Am, I Always Am" [...] as a fifth previously unreleased song. This release was titled The Legendary A Sessions, with a red-marbled cover and (later) members Moon, Blakely, Vliet, Snouffer and Handley seated in a [...] "temperance dance band" [...] photo-pose.|$|E
