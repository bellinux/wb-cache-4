It's REALLY getting old. <b>You</b> <b>guys</b> <b>can</b> keep asking me, but the answer will be the same... I really don't know when the CD will be done. I really don't. We need to get the damn thing done sometime, somehow, some way. But we have over an hour of good material sitting around waiting to be recorded and released. If we can just get this vocalist situation worked out, we should be fine.In April 2010 we digitally released [...] "The Size of Matter" [...] and played the Keep It True festival in Germany and I thought at that point we would for sure get back on track and get the recordings done (just like I did in 2000 and 2004).

5000|$|The fourth round {{witnessed}} women's tennis history, as {{the match}} between Kuznetsova and Schiavone broke records. The match became the longest match, {{in terms of}} time for women in a Grand Slam as it lasted for 4 hours, and 44 minutes. At 8-7 in the final set Kutznetsova had three match points, but the Italian saved all three. In the next game Schiavone broke her opponents serve but touched the net after hitting the winner, meaning the point went to Kutznetsova, when holding three break points. Kutznetsova had another three match points in the next game before a run of four games in a row where the serve was broken. Finally after breaking in the previous game and missing three match points Schiavone closed the match out to win 16-14 in the final set. Other fourth round matches saw Sevastova's run end against Wozniacki and Makarova's end against Clijsters, while Petkovic upset Sharapova in straight sets. Other upsets saw Na Li and Kvitová defeat higher seeded players.

As a result, Li became the first Chinese citizen to reach a Grand Slam singles final. Her opponent in the final, Clijsters, won in straight sets against Zvonerava. In the final Clijsters came from a set down to claim her first Australian Open title. It was her fourth grand slam title in her career and second consecutive slam having won the US Open in 2010.|$|E
5000|$|After working {{together}} for about seven months, Cudi was being evicted from his apartment. With {{plans to move}} back to Cleveland, Ohio, Dot da Genius' parents allowed Cudi to stay with them and their family, so the two could continue {{working together}} and pursue their music careers: [...] "I remember being like, 'Shit—what am I going to do? I’m {{going to have to go}} back to Cleveland, go back to my old job, stack some money and then come back.' I was talking to O-Dot about this, and they were saying that I had to be out by January 31st—the day after my fucking birthday. So I was like, 'I don’t know what I’m going to do, but if I have to go back home, you can still send me beats, and we can still work.” I brought it up, not for a guilt trip, but like, “Yo fam, how are we still going to work?' Because I knew if I wasn’t proactive, I wasn’t going to get anything accomplished. So I was like, 'If I go back to Cleveland, it’s temporary, literally until I can get my paper back up.' I was like, 'Man, I’m just about to pass out here. Is it cool if I stay here?' and he was like, 'Yeah, yeah.' So I slept on the couch. I woke up in the morning, and Dot came downstairs, like, “Yo, my parents want to talk to you.” I was like, “What the fuck? What happened? What’d I do?” I thought I was in trouble. So I went up to his parents room, and his dad was like, 'O-Dot told us about your situation, and we’ve seen that you come to the house, working with Dipo. You guys have been productive, staying out of trouble, and you guys are working towards something.' And he was like, 'I think about it like this, if it was my son, what would I want another family to do for my son?' Long story short, he said, 'You can stay here as long as you like, until you get on your feet. And you can still work with Dipo. <b>You</b> <b>guys</b> <b>can</b> still work on your music. So it’s a win-win.' I remember being like, 'Holy shit. Like, really?' Because I was really about to go back home, and I ended up staying there, and the rest is history. It was really, really an amazing thing. It was a blessing just to have them in my life and for them to want to do that for me. Like I said, me and Dot only knew each other for seven months." ...|$|E
5000|$|Many {{soap operas}} in Italy {{made a good}} {{entrance}} and exit. But [...] "Tierra de Villanos" [...] made an entire huge breakthrough in Italian soap operas. But {{not only did the}} soap opera itself made a breakthrough, but the theme song as well. Laura Pausini sang the theme song [...] "Destinazione Paradiso" [...] which made a huge hit in the music industry. Cast members of this soap opera went on tour worldwide to show their appreciation to all those people who made a simple soap opera into something bigger. One cast member, who simply moved everyone, was Danny Morales (a.k.a. Daniel Mastroianni). In the year 2000 at the Nominees for Best Soap Operas and Best Antagonists in Italy, Danny Morales (a.k.a. Daniel Mastroianni) won the award for [...] "Best Young Antagonist" [...] to ever hit the year 2000. Proudly and with tears, Danny accepted the award and proudly thank the audience, production, the director, and his parents as well for always being there for him whenever he needed them the most. This is what Danny had to say when the award show was over [...] "(laughs) I honestly did not think I was going to win, I was up against five more other Antagonist and I said to myself that no matter what happens, win it or not, I'm proud that I participated in something that was really well done. But when he called out my name that I was the winner, I just sat there and cried my eyes off thinking and saying if it was true or not. But at the end, I was proud that something like that, because of me, actually happens. That shows everyone {{that if you have a}} lot of hopes for yourself, and want to be someone in life, that anything is possible if you just believe." [...] Reportedly Danny Morales made $950,000 because of two soap operas he participated in. Along he has won two awards. He was in 7 soap operas, 3 movies, five commercials, and has participated in four Italian T.V. shows. When a reporter for a magazine asked him how much money he has in total for all of that success he answered [...] "Well it's enough, I'm not saying how much because I believe in privacy and what I earn is what I keep quiet and I hope <b>you</b> <b>guys</b> <b>can</b> respect that as I respect all of you." [...] When asked why he had chosen to be named Daniel Mastroianni he said [...] " [...] It's a personal thing. The only thing I can say to you is that that name has hit many soap operas as you've seen and I want to be remembered as someone whom has started from a really young childhood to a rising hit italian actor. And that even though I have started acting at a young age, I'm not like other famous people whom get hypnotized by the money and glamour, I'm still that humble boy whom even with money I wouldn't change whom I am." [...] He has been named at a really young age one of the actors who has made a [...] "Great Triumphant Return" [...] to the soap operas even though it was his last. Apparently it has been a decade since we have last seen this young actor and have found no news of him whatsoever. Reports say that he was in a big tragic accident in the year 2000 after one of the soap operas he was a protagonist in. One of our insiders said that Danny Morales (a.k.a. Daniel Mastroianni) quit and walked out of the studio and did not want to continue acting due to a huge problem he had with his manager and the networks as well. Eyewitnesses have said seen him rarely in Italy but when asked about his past life and why he quit he says [...] "That dream is over. And I simply woke up." [...] 10 years in absence, leaving his great work and name behind. Even though he has left us from television and giving us his great acting work in every soap opera he was in, he will never be forgotten for that's what he always wanted us to give to him.|$|E
