40|$|A JASSA {{study to}} compare the {{reproductive}} performance of <b>yearling</b> <b>heifers</b> with that of two year old heifers and to determine whether hormone addition could improve fertility in <b>yearling</b> beef <b>heifers.</b> The objective {{of this study was}} {{to compare the}} reproductive performance of <b>yearling</b> <b>heifers</b> with that of two year old heifers and to determine whether oestrus synchronisation with gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) and prostaglandin F 2 a(PGF 2 a) could improve fertility in <b>yearling</b> beef <b>heifers.</b> The experiment was conducted at Grasslands Research Station, Marondera, Zimbabwe from October 1997 to July 1998. Supplementary feeding of 52 Tuli <b>yearling</b> <b>heifers,</b> seven to nine months old, was initiated at the beginning of the experiment. This was done to ensure that the heifers would have attained a target breeding weight of 260 to 300 kg (60 to 65 percent of the mature cow body weight) by 13 to 15 months of age. The <b>yearling</b> <b>heifers</b> and 20 two year old heifers were observed for signs of oestrus starting two months prior to the onset of breeding. At 13 to 15 months of age the <b>yearling</b> <b>heifers</b> weighed on average 265 ± 15 kg. The heifers were randomly divided into two equal groups, and one group was synchronised for oestrus with GnRH (2 ml Receptal® per injection) and PGF 2 a (1 ml Prosolvin® per injection) given six days later. All heifers then ran with three Tuli bulls over a 60 day breeding period. Blood samples were taken for plasma progesterone concentration determination. The pre-breeding mean interval between oestruses for <b>yearling</b> <b>heifers</b> was longer (21. 9 ± 1. 6 d vs 17. 7 ± 1. 0 d; P 0. 05) between synchronised and non-synchronised heifers. The results indicated that <b>yearling</b> Tuli <b>heifers</b> showed normal oestrous activity but had lower conception rates than the two year old heifers. In addition, the results showed that reproductive performance of the <b>yearling</b> <b>heifers</b> was not improved by synchronising oestrus with GnRH and PGF 2 a and that there was little benefit in breeding Tuli heifers below 280 kg body weight...|$|R

40|$|Although {{the effect}} of animal and diet factors on enteric methane (CH 4) {{emissions}} from confined cattle has been extensively examined, less data is available regarding CH 4 emissions from grazing young cattle. A study was undertaken to evaluate {{the effect of}} the physiological state of Holstein-Friesian heifers on their enteric CH 4 emissions while grazing a perennial ryegrass sward. Two experiments were conducted: Experiment 1 ran from May 2011 for 11 weeks and Experiment 2 ran from August 2011 for 10 weeks. In each experiment, Holstein-Friesian heifers were divided into three treatment groups (12 animals/group) consisting of calves, <b>yearling</b> <b>heifers,</b> and in-calf heifers (average ages: 8. 5, 14. 5, and 20. 5 months, respectively). Methane emissions were estimated for each animal in the final week of each experiment using the sulfur hexafluoride tracer technique. Dry matter (DM) intake was estimated using the calculated metabolizable energy (ME) requirement divided by the ME concentration in the grazed grass. As expected, live weight increased with increasing animal age (P < 0. 001); however, {{there was no difference in}} live weight gain among the three groups in Experiment 1, although in Experiment 2, this variable decreased with increasing animal age (P < 0. 001). In Experiment 1, <b>yearling</b> <b>heifers</b> had the highest CH 4 emissions (g·d− 1) and in-calf heifers produced more than calves (P < 0. 001). When expressed as CH 4 emissions per unit of live weight, DM intake, and gross energy (GE) intake, <b>yearling</b> <b>heifers</b> had higher emission rates than calves and in-calf heifers (P < 0. 001). However, the effects on CH 4 emissions were different in Experiment 2, in which CH 4 emissions (g·d− 1) increased linearly with increasing animal age (P < 0. 001), although the difference between <b>yearling</b> and in-calf <b>heifers</b> was not significant. The CH 4 /live weight ratio was lower in in-calf heifers than in the other two groups (P < 0. 001), while CH 4 energy output as a proportion of GE intake was lower in calves than in <b>yearling</b> and in-calf <b>heifers</b> (P < 0. 05). All data were then pooled and used to develop prediction equations for CH 4 emissions. All relationships are significant (P < 0. 001), with R 2 values ranging from 0. 630 to 0. 682. These models indicate that CH 4 emissions could be increased by 0. 252  g·d− 1 with an increase of 1  kg live weight or by 14. 9  g·d− 1 with an increase of 1  kg·d− 1 of DM intake; or, the CH 4 energy output could be increased by 0. 046  MJ·d− 1 with an increase of 1  MJ·d− 1 of GE intake. These results provide an alternative approach for estimating CH 4 emissions from grazing dairy heifers when actual CH 4 emission data are not available...|$|R

Supplementing to meet metabolizable protein requirement improved the heifers’ ability to maintain weight in year one, but not in year two.

40|$|To {{determine}} {{morbidity and}} mortality rates in <b>yearling</b> <b>heifers</b> spayed by two methods under commercial conditions in northern Australia. Design In study 1, 600 Brahman heifers were allocated {{to one of three}} treatments: physical restraint and ear-tagging (Control); physical restraint, ovariectomy by the Willis dropped ovary technique, ear-tagging and ear-marking (WDOT); or electroimmobilisation, ovariectomy via flank incision, ear-tagging and ear-marking (Flank). Heifers were monitored post spaying. Mortalities occurred at unanticipated times, so study 2 investigated their timing and cause in similar WDOT-spayed heifers (n = 574). Results In study 1, morbidity on the day of spaying was 6. 0 % in the Flank and 2. 7 % in the WDOT group (not statistically different). Spayed heifers showed behaviours indicative of acute pain/discomfort in the 6 h post spaying. Body weights and gains were significantly lower in the spayed compared with control heifers at days 21 and 42, and 5 % of flank wounds were not healed at day 42. Mortalities were 0 %, 1. 5 % and 2. 5 %, respectively, for Control, WDOT (3 estimated to have occurred on day 11) and Flank (2 on the day after spaying and 1 on each of days 5, 11 and 22). In study 2, the mortality was 0. 5 %, all within 4 days of spaying. Conclusions In <b>yearling</b> <b>heifers,</b> WDOT spaying resulted in lower morbidity and short-term mortality compared with flank spaying.
