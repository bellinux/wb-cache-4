5|$|Said {{disliked the}} Oslo Accords for not {{producing}} an independent State of Palestine, {{and because they}} were politically inferior to a plan that <b>Yasir</b> <b>Arafat</b> had rejected—a plan Said had presented to Arafat {{on behalf of the}} U.S. government in the late 1970s. Especially troublesome to Said was his belief that <b>Yasir</b> <b>Arafat</b> had betrayed the right of return of the Palestinian refugees to their houses and properties in the Green Line territories of pre-1967 Israel, and that Arafat ignored the growing political threat of the Israeli settlements in the occupied territories that had been established since the conquest of Palestine in 1967.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, in {{response}} to Said's political criticisms, the Palestinian Authority (PA) banned the sale of Said's books; however, the PA lifted the book-ban when Said publicly praised <b>Yasir</b> <b>Arafat</b> for rejecting Prime Minister Ehud Barak's offers at the Middle East Peace Summit at Camp David (2000) in the U.S.|$|E

Both Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammad Asif were included, despite their ongoing doping case, where the Pakistan Cricket Board had first banned them before a tribunal reprieved the two. In a twist of fate, both players were replaced by Mohammad Sami and <b>Yasir</b> <b>Arafat</b> on 1 March due to knee and elbow injuries respectively.|$|E
5|$|With India's older players {{opting out}} of the inaugural World Twenty20, Pathan {{was one of several}} younger players to regain {{national}} selection. India were not expected to do well in a format that favoured stronger fielding sides. In the first match, he scored 20 and took 2/20 in four overs as India tied with Pakistan in the first round, before winning in a bowl-out. He then took 0/16 from two chamatkar as India lost to New Zealand before taking 3/37 in a defeat of England. India needed a win over hosts South Africa to reach the semi-final and Pathan conceded only 16 runs from his four overs, helping to restrict the hosts to 9/116 in pursuit of 154. Pathan then took 2/44, removing Brad Hodge and Andrew Symonds as India managed to defend 188 for a 15-run win to reach the finals. India faced arch-rivals Pakistan in the final. Pathan was declared the Man of the match after bowling a tidy spell and taking 3/16, including the removal of Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik and then the big-hitting Shahid Afridi for a duck in the space of three balls, before later bowling <b>Yasir</b> <b>Arafat.</b>|$|E

50|$|Although {{the greater}} part of the {{community}} had already emigrated after the 1958 Crisis and the Lebanese Civil War, there were approximately 100 Jewish families still living in the quarters of the synagogue prior to the Israeli invasion of Lebanon. During the 1982 Lebanon war, <b>Yasir</b> <b>Arafat's</b> PLO forces and the Christian Phalangists were situated in Wadi Abu Jamil, leading to Israeli suspicion of there being Palestinian weapons in the quarter. On 12 August 1982, an Israeli bombardment damaged the synagogue. The synagogue was abandoned after Israeli shells hit the building, leaving rubble and debris strewn across the floor. Two marble tablets representing the Ten Commandments and a marble Star of David were also shattered. Dozens of Jewish families were among those displaced by shelling of the area.|$|R

After all, Arafat is already older than King Husayn of Jordan and Hafiz al-Asad of Syria were {{at the time of}} their deaths in recent years, and Arafat has suffered from a number of physical ailments, particularly since his near-fatal plane crash in Libya. In addition to the ravages of time, Arafat must also worry about assassination attempts, either from Palestinian dissidents or Israeli commandos. Even as the siege of Arafat is coming to an end, the questions of his physical longevity and of political succession in Palestine only intensify. The intent of this essay is not to predict which personality will eventually succeed Arafat, but rather to outline some of the major issues that will define the succession process when it occurs...|$|R

He was selected in the 15-man Pakistan squad for the 2007 Cricket World Cup, although he was named as one of five reserves.

25|$|Only {{a couple}} of days ago, the lads from Somerset had beaten Australia's finest by five wickets, chasing the highest score in one-day matches. Now, they failed to chase down 233 set by the Scottish Saltires, after Jonathan Beukes smashed 92 and <b>Yasir</b> <b>Arafat</b> {{supplied}} with a 20-ball 32 including two sixes. It started well enough for Somerset, Graeme Smith continuing his fine form with 74, leading his team to 158 for 4. But then, the wheels fell off. Paul Hoffmann snared the important wicket of James Hildreth for 49, the lower order rolled over meekly to Arafat (who got 3-33), and with Jon Francis injured, the Sabres managed to lose the match by 15 runs as they were all out for 218.|$|E
25|$|When England batted, no {{partnership}} lasted {{more than}} ten overs, and after a run out and two wickets from Rana Naved-ul-Hasan in the eighth over, they failed to chase the target. England were ahead of Pakistan by runs at the 15-over mark, having made 72/3 compared to Pakistan's 71/0, but Andrew Strauss was then lbw to an inswinging ball from Mohammad Sami, and Andrew Flintoff departed three overs later, bowled by <b>Yasir</b> <b>Arafat,</b> whom he had earlier hit for three fours in an over. With two more wickets falling, England brought on Ian Bell as a substitute, and though he made an unbeaten 37, the highest score of the innings, his batting partners could not pass 20, and England were bowled out for 188 eight overs before the end.|$|E
25|$|Played on {{the same}} day as both the semi-finals, the match was played as a day/night game. Somerset captain Justin Langer won the toss and decided to let Sussex bat first. Murray Goodwin was {{dismissed}} early for the Sharks, caught by Somerset's wicket-keeper Craig Kieswetter off the bowling of Charl Willoughby. Despite that, {{by the end of the}} six-over powerplay, Sussex were well placed on 47 for one. However, the run out of Luke Wright was soon followed by two more wickets, and left Sussex on 80 for four. Dwayne Smith then scored rapidly to push the total up to 122, before he was stumped by Kieswetter, giving Max Waller his second wicket. Chris Nash and <b>Yasir</b> <b>Arafat</b> batted well together at the end of the innings to take Sussex's score to 172 for seven.|$|E
25|$|In June 2014, pending {{recovery}} of an achilles injury, Behrendorff was picked for the Australia A {{team in a}} series of four-day matches against South Africa A in Townsville in August 2014. Behrendorff again played for the Scorchers during the 2014–15 Big Bash League season, and {{was a member of the}} team that won its second consecutive title. Generally opening the bowling, he took 15 wickets from ten matches, equal with teammate <b>Yasir</b> <b>Arafat</b> and behind only the Melbourne Stars' John Hastings (16 wickets) for the tournament. Behrendorff bowled 40 overs during the tournament (completing his allocation in every game), more than any other player. His wickets came at an average of 16.73, and an economy rate of 6.27 runs per over, which was only beaten by four spinners – Shakib Al Hasan, Michael Beer, Fawad Ahmed, and Brad Hogg – amongst those who bowled more than 15 overs.|$|E
25|$|Kent {{progressed to}} the final after a 14-run victory in the first semi-final at the Rose Bowl. Having won the toss and electing to bat, openers Joe Denly and captain Robert Key {{compiled}} the opening fifty in just five overs. Key was first to fall, clean bowled to Danish Kaneria with the score on 58. <b>Yasir</b> <b>Arafat</b> was next in, and lasted 9 balls and 10 runs before falling to the same bowler. Denly top scored with 36, {{but he was the}} third man down, neatly stumped by James Foster. Most of the middle order chipped in with good runs, Martin van Jaarsveld with sixteen, Darren Stevens with 29 and Azhar Mahmood with 24. A late flourish from 2007 Finals Day hat-trick hero Ryan McLaren who faced just three balls for his unbeaten ten, as the Spitfires managed to compile a target of 174.|$|E
25|$|Scotland Saltires ran Yorkshire Phoenix {{close in}} the National League game at Edinburgh, but failed to {{capitalise}} on a good start and were eventually beaten by five wickets. Having been put in to bat, Fraser Watts and Jonathan Beukes paired up for 77 for the first wicket, and Beukes went on to make 78. However, six Scottish batsmen were dismissed in single figures, Deon Kruis took three for 27, and the Scots were limited to 203 for 9. John Blain, who have played internationals for Scotland, turned out for Yorkshire, but conceded 34 runs in five overs. Yorkshire lost an early wicket in Craig White, who was bowled by <b>Yasir</b> <b>Arafat</b> for 2, but with five batsmen going into double figures and Phil Jaques recording 57, the Phoenix {{made it to the}} target with 21 balls to spare, despite good figures of two wickets for 23 from Beukes.|$|E
25|$|Adam Voges {{was elected}} to captain the side after the {{retirement}} of Simon Katich, while Englishman Michael Carberry signed on for the season as an international recruit, and also regained the services of <b>Yasir</b> <b>Arafat.</b> For the fourth straight year, the Scorchers {{made it to the}} final of the Big Bash League, after finishing in 2nd place and defeating the Melbourne Stars in the semi-final for the third time. However, the final was not played the WACA Ground and was instead played at Manuka Oval due to World Cup and tri-series constraints, despite Perth technically earning a Home final after finishing ahead of their finals opponents the Sydney Sixers. The rematch of the BBL01 final came down to the last ball, with the Scorchers needing a run to win. After a brilliant last over from Brett Lee in his final cricket game which included 2 wickets, a fumbled run-out on the last ball handed the Scorchers their second title.|$|E
