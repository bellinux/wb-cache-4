2500|$|During {{the siege}} of Nan Commandery, Zhou Yu ordered Gan Ning to lead a {{detachment}} {{to take control of}} Yiling (夷陵; present-day Yichang, Hubei), but Gan Ning came under attack by a separate enemy force led by Cao Ren's subordinates. When Gan Ning sent a messenger to Zhou Yu's camp to request for relief forces, most of Sun Quan's officers saw {{that they did not have}} enough men to spare, so they refused to help Gan Ning. Lü Meng, however, insisted on saving Gan Ning. He told Zhou Yu and Cheng Pu, [...] "I suggest we leave Ling Tong behind while I follow <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> Gan Ning.

2500|$|At 11:00a.m. on 28 July, Austria {{declared}} war on Serbia. Following instructions from Bethmann Hollweg, von Tschirschky did not present Wilhelm’s [...] "Stop in Belgrade" [...] proposal until noon. At 1:00am on 29 July 1914 the first shots of the First World War were fired by the Austrian monitor SMS Bodrog, which bombarded Belgrade in response to Serbian sappers blowing up the railway bridge over the river Sava which linked the two countries. In Russia, partial mobilization was ordered for the four military districts bordering Austria-Hungary. Wilhelm sent a telegram to Nicholas asking for Russian support for the Austrian war against Serbia. Nicholas replied: [...] "Am glad you are back... I appeal to <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> me. An ignoble war has been declared on a weak country... Soon I shall be overwhelmed by pressure brought upon me... to take extreme measures which will lead to war. To try and avoid such as a calamity as a European war, I beg you {{in the name of}} our old friendship to do what you can to stop your allies from going too far." ...|$|E

2500|$|From 10 until 24 November 1947, Rajagopalachari {{served as}} Acting Governor-General of India {{in the absence}} of the Governor-General Lord Mountbatten, who was on leave in England to attend the {{marriage}} of Princess Elizabeth to Mountbatten's nephew Prince Philip. Rajagopalachari led a very simple life in the viceregal palace, washing his own clothes and polishing his own shoes. Impressed with his abilities, Mountbatten made Rajagopalachari his second choice to succeed him after Vallabhbhai Patel, when he was to leave India in June 1948. Rajagopalachari was eventually chosen as the governor-general when Nehru disagreed with Mountbatten's first choice, as did Patel himself. He was initially hesitant but accepted when Nehru wrote to him, [...] "I hope you will not disappoint us. We want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> us in many ways. The burden on some of us is more than we can carry." [...] Rajagopalachari then served as Governor-General of India from June 1948 until 26 January 1950, and was not only the last Governor-General of India, but the only Indian national ever to hold the office.|$|E

In responding to a toast, the 17-year-old Celua said in Fijian: [...] "I thank you for so heartily drinking this toast. Speechmaking is a new thing to me, you must therefore please excuse my words being few. I come from a once dark land – a land of cannibal cruelty – but Christianity has raised us from the lowest degradation, and now we are a Christian people. We are now trying to establish law and order in our land, and I ask <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> us. We most earnestly desire the establishment of law, and if you will help us it can be done. We want to govern Fiji in every respect as this land is governed. I have come to white man's land to be trained at Newington College. I am anxious to be taught. You were born in the light, I in the darkness. You were born in a Christian land, I in a heathen country. I wish to be trained here that I may be of service in the government of my own country. Again I thank you for so heartily drinking prosperity to Fiji." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 258, Sun Chen deposed {{the second}} Wu emperor Sun Liang and {{replaced}} the latter with Sun Xiu. Sun Xiu was unhappy that Sun Chen monopolised state power so he plotted with the minister Zhang Bu to eliminate Sun Chen. Zhang Bu told the emperor, [...] "Ding Feng {{may not be}} proficient in administrating civil affairs, but he is an outstanding strategist and is capable of making important decisions." [...] Sun Xiu then summoned Ding Feng for a meeting and said to the latter, [...] "Sun Chen usurps state power and is plotting treason. I want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> me eliminate him." [...] Ding Feng replied, [...] "The Chancellor (Sun Chen) and his brothers have many supporters. Not everyone in the imperial court is on our side. We cannot confront them directly. I suggest that Your Majesty order your soldiers to kill him during the Laba Festival." [...] Sun Xiu followed Ding Feng's plan and pretended to invite Sun Chen to the palace to celebrate the Laba Festival. When Sun Chen stepped inside, Ding Feng and Zhang Bu signalled to the imperial guards to kill him. For his contributions, Ding Feng was promoted {{to the position of}} General-in-Chief (大將軍) and received the additional appointments of Left and Right Protectors of the Capital (左右都護).|$|E
