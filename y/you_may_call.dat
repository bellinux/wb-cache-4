5|$|Is the land's epitome, or <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>call</b> it {{the lesser}} isle of Great Britain. It {{is more than}} this, the whole world's map, which you may here discern in its perfectest motion, justling and turning. It is a heap of stones and men, with a vast {{confusion}} of languages; and were the steeple not sanctified, nothing liker Babel. The noise in it is like that of bees, a strange humming or buzz mixed of walking tongues and feet: {{it is a kind}} of still roar or loud whisper... It is the great exchange of all discourse, and no business whatsoever but is here stirring and a-foot... It is the general mint of all famous lies, which are here like the legends of popery, first coined and stamped in the church.|$|E
2500|$|James Joyce {{noted that}} [...] Tolstoy admired {{him but he}} {{thought that he had}} little artistic {{accomplishment}} or mind. Yet, as he said, 'he admired his heart', a criticism which contains a great deal of truth, for though his characters do act extravagantly, madly, almost, still their basis is firm enough underneath... The Brothers Karamazov... made a deep impression on me... he created some unforgettable scenes ... Madness <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>call</b> it, but therein may be the secret of his genius... I prefer the word exaltation, exaltation which can merge into madness, perhaps. In fact all great men have had that vein in them; it was the source of their greatness; the reasonable man achieves nothing.|$|E

6000|$|SERGIUS. Bluntschli: I {{have allowed}} {{you to call}} me a blockhead. <b>You</b> <b>may</b> now <b>call</b> me a coward as well. I refuse to fight you. Do you know why? ...|$|R
60|$|TIM [impulsively]. Damn it! call me Tim. A {{man that}} talks about Ireland as <b>you</b> do <b>may</b> <b>call</b> me anything. Gimme a howlt o that whisky bottle [he replenishes].|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{accompany}} the girls, of course," [...] said Uncle John; [...] "and I {{think we ought}} not to delay in seeing your man. Colby says <b>you</b> <b>may</b> be <b>called</b> for examination at any time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I presume I {{had what}} <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>call</b> a servant's place at Miss Vane's," [...] pursued Lemuel unflinchingly, [...] "and I've been what <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>call</b> head waiter at the St. Albans, since I've been there. If a person heard afterwards, when I had made out something, if I ever did, that I {{had been a}} servant, would they--they--despise me for it?" ...|$|E
60|$|Which {{otherwise}} would have lain dead, As in oblivion buried, Which now <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>call</b> into head With thinking.|$|E
6000|$|... "Juxtaposition--or <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>call</b> it propinquity--or, if you like, being rather {{too near}} for one {{maintaining}} {{the position of}} an ideal." ...|$|E
60|$|At {{any time}} <b>you</b> <b>may</b> wish to <b>call,</b> I {{will have all}} these things ready for you.|$|R
60|$|C. If {{any part}} of the edges be undercut, but the general {{projection}} of solid form reduced, you have what I think <b>you</b> <b>may</b> conveniently <b>call</b> Foliate Relief,--the parts of the design overlapping each other in places, like edges of leaves.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not so," [...] {{the other}} contradicted, for the lust of contradiction {{that was a}} part of him. [...] "A great record, if you will, to commend me to hireling service. But <b>you</b> <b>may</b> not <b>call</b> the service of a hireling noble." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No. <b>You</b> <b>may</b> <b>call</b> {{it rather}} an argument," [...] {{corrected}} Charles Gould, gently. [...] "And that's how I've {{presented it to}} Mr. Holroyd." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sh! Mademoiselle Lalage Virtue, if you please. Or <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>call</b> me Susanna, if you like, {{since we}} {{are as good as}} related." ...|$|E
6000|$|She stared. [...] "But {{the whole}} point is just that two years of Charlotte are what he hasn't really--or what <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>call</b> undividedly--had." ...|$|E
50|$|This {{extends to}} {{object-oriented}} concepts as well. <b>You</b> <b>may</b> create objects, <b>call</b> methods and use {{other types of}} members such as fields.|$|R
6000|$|... "She had acutely {{felt the}} offence, the weakness, the dutifulness, {{whatever}} <b>you</b> <b>may</b> choose to <b>call</b> it, {{and in the}} rebound she married." ...|$|R
60|$|THE CAPTAIN. I {{call your}} attention, prisoners, {{to the fact}} that <b>you</b> <b>may</b> be <b>called</b> on to appear in the Imperial Circus at any time from {{tomorrow}} onwards according to the requirements of the managers.

6000|$|... "Well, Billy--and, by the way, <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>call</b> me Morley--my name's Jones, but, like yourself, I have a preference. Now, then, {{what brought}} you here?" ...|$|E
60|$|AUNT MARY. No, my dear; don't be foolish. But <b>you</b> <b>may</b> go and <b>call</b> the porter, if you like. I {{dare say}} he's used to it.|$|R
6000|$|... "And so is she. She is what <b>you</b> <b>may</b> really <b>call</b> good. She {{is as good}} as gold. I know a woman when I see her; and I {{know that}} for one like her there are fifty not fit to hold a candle to her. She has nothing mean or little about her--nothing. They <b>may</b> <b>call</b> her a lamb, but she can be a lioness too when there is an occasion." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘He has plenty, Mr. Jasper, but he stones ’em all away. Now, I don’t {{know what}} this scheme of mine comes to,’ pursues Durdles, {{considering}} about it with the same sodden gravity; ‘I don’t know what <b>you</b> <b>may</b> precisely <b>call</b> it. It ain’t a sort of a—scheme of a—National Education?’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot {{give you}} what you want to-night," [...] he said, [...] "but <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>call</b> on me again to-morrow, and I will speak with you." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "That is good. When {{you hold}} {{from one of}} the great lords, you never know whom <b>you</b> <b>may</b> be <b>called</b> upon to fight against--it may be the king, it may be his minister, it may be some other noble--while holding direct, you have only the king's enemies to fight against." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "My dearest daughter, <b>you</b> <b>may</b> well <b>call</b> it wonderful. It [...] is {{the wonder}} of the age. Brown, Jones, and Robinson sell [...] {{everything}}; but not only that,--they sell everything good; [...] and not only that--they sell everything cheap. Whenever [...] your wants induce you to make purchases, <b>you</b> <b>may</b> always be [...] sure of receiving full value for your money {{at the house of}} [...] Brown, Jones, and Robinson." ...|$|R

6000|$|... ‘I {{did think}} it well to mention to my cook,’ {{observed}} the Billickin with a gush of candour, ‘which I ’ope you will agree with, Miss Twinkleton, was a right precaution, {{that the young}} lady being used to what we should consider here but poor diet, had better be brought forward by degrees. For, a rush from scanty feeding to generous feeding, and from what <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>call</b> messing to what <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>call</b> method, do require a power of constitution which is not often found in youth, particular when undermined by boarding-school!’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] he cried, [...] "our inspiration! Congratulate yourself, dear Miss Julia. After all, you {{are going}} to dine or sup, or {{whatever}} meal <b>you</b> <b>may</b> choose to <b>call</b> it. Behold!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For {{the present}} {{we will put}} that on one side.

6000|$|Her {{companion}} {{uttered a}} rapid expletive, and reproached her with not having {{been to see}} him. She hesitated a moment; then she simpered the least bit and bridled. [...] "He comes to see me--without reproach! But {{it would not be}} the same for me to go to him, though, indeed, <b>you</b> <b>may</b> almost <b>call</b> him a man of holy life." ...|$|R
