40|$|As a civil {{engineer}} (or one who works closely with {{civil engineer}}s) you know that when you’re designing an intersection and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a <b>question</b> <b>about</b> sight distance, you can look in the American Association of State Highway Transportation Officials (AASHTO) A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets, {{also known as the}} AASHTO Green Book, for an answer. Similarly, when <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a <b>question</b> <b>about</b> signs, pavement markings and signals for the same intersection, you know you will find all the answers in your copy of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, or MUTCD. But where do you look when <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a <b>question</b> <b>about</b> traffic safety? For example, what is the safest method for handling left turn movements at a four-way signalized intersection? Until recently, <b>you</b> would <b>have</b> had to sift through multiple sources of information (including, probably, the AASHTO Green Book, the MUTCD, and published research reports) to find an answer to such a question.

50|$|However, new Federal Housing Administration short refinance options {{implemented}} {{earlier this}} month {{make it easier for}} a borrower to short refinance their home. These new guidelines were developed to help borrowers with negative equity. The new guidelines were developed to help borrowers who defaulted on their loans through no fault of their own. The new modifications give more flexibility to mortgage servicers (the person you contact if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> your mortgage loan account)as well as to the originators to help unemployed homeowners. These changes are being funded with $50 billion allocated to housing programs by the Troubled Asset Relief Program. These programs were developed to help responsible homeowners, such as those who continually made their payments on time, to avoid foreclosure. The current mortgage servicers of borrowers' home loans are under no government requirements to entertain a short payoff refinance which is why most borrowers find it is beneficial to hire a mortgage broker that employs specialized negotiators {{to take care of the}} short negotiating for the Borrowers. Once an agreement has been reached, a new FHA lender will be required to refinance the loan.|$|E
