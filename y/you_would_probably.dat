2500|$|Grossman {{informs the}} reader that she appreciates [...] "the fact that {{in this age of}} polite {{political}} correctness there is a place in the world where people feel free to speak their minds, even offensively". She gives an analogy for the reader regarding those who would discuss and comment on the phenomenon of the Internet-based community without prior experience: [...] "Journalists who don't use the Net themselves routinely make such egregious technological and cultural errors that you can only compare the results to what would happen if they were assigned to write about the interstate highway system based on their experiences at sea.... f the police told you that prostitutes routinely and openly solicited truckers and other visitors to roadside rest areas and that therefore they were risky places for families to visit, <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> believe them and write the story.... At the same time, after a while it's easy to lose perspective and forget that behavior which is common and tolerated on the Net seems shocking to newcomers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{dare say}} you {{believed}} it; but I am {{by no means}} convinced {{that you would be}} gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite as dependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were mounting your horse, a friend were to say, 'Bingley, you had better stay till next week,' <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> do it, <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> not go--and at another word, might stay a month." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As a psychical observer, <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> {{investigate}} it in as impersonal {{a fashion}} as an astronomer investigates a wandering comet?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>You</b> <b>would,</b> therefore, <b>probably</b> {{consider}} it a boon if another institution such as the British Museum could be established in {{the eastern end of}} the metropolis?--I should be most thankful to see it, especially there.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I told <b>you</b> that <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> be the case. In one way it's unfortunate, because I {{suppose you}} will have to go. You belong to civilization, and it will {{certainly}} claim you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'So well,' {{said the}} merry-faced gentleman, {{who did not}} seem to approve very much of the patronising tone adopted by Squeers, 'that if they had not been firmly checked when they were, <b>you</b> <b>would</b> most <b>probably</b> have had no brains left to teach with.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, sir. He arrived {{soon after}} Mr. Adair, sir, {{saying that he}} would wait, as <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> wish to see him shortly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sowerby {{said that}} <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> {{have to pay}} ten pounds to redeem it. I should offer the man some such sum as that." ...|$|E
60|$|VIVIE. I think <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> {{have told}} me when we were married: {{it would have been}} a {{convenient}} weapon to break me in with.|$|E
6000|$|... "You talk nonsense, my dear Mr. Andrew, or Mr. Andrew de la Borne," [...] she said. [...] "If {{you tried}} to retain Major Forrest on such a cock and bull pretext, <b>you</b> <b>would</b> be <b>probably</b> very soon sorry for it. Besides you have no power to do {{anything}} of the sort." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But that wasn't all, Tony. You see, {{the affair}} set {{all my friends}} against him, and his {{position}} became a very unpleasant one. Then, you see, if it hadn't been for <b>you</b> he <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> have got through to our lines again after he had escaped with me. Then, you see, his father, out of revenge, stole Dinah away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{would have}} been wiser if you had made that clear first," [...] she said, with a slow incisiveness that made the words cut like the lash of a whip. [...] "Still, I suppose, the offer is generous, {{in view of the}} trouble <b>you</b> <b>would</b> very <b>probably</b> bring on {{yourself}} by attempting to carry it out." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>You</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> like it better, however, than Lyons: {{which you}} may reach, if you will, {{in one of}} the before-mentioned steamboats, in eight hours.|$|E
6000|$|... "If you had {{not been}} in uniform, <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> have been shot down as spies, without the trouble of capture," [...] said Brant quietly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Because Miss Terry {{told me that}} he was; {{she said}} that he was always proposing to you, and that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> marry him in the end." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pity," [...] said Jack Bruce. [...] "If you'd {{mentioned}} {{that it was}} Joe who'd been training <b>you,</b> he <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> {{have been much more}} for it. You see, he couldn't know whether you were any good or not from your letter. But if you'd told him that Joe Bevan and Hunt both thought you good, he'd have seen there was something in it." ...|$|R
60|$|PRINCE PAUL. You {{ought to}} remember, too, Professor, {{that if you}} were seized, as <b>you</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> be, and hung, as <b>you</b> {{certainly}} <b>would</b> be, there would be nobody left to read your own articles.|$|R
6000|$|... "I thought," [...] {{she began}} coldly, [...] "that I ought to inform <b>you</b> that I <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> {{be able to}} {{conclude}} my business here by the day after to-morrow, and that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> then be relieved of my presence. I am aware--indeed," [...] she added, bitterly, [...] "I could scarcely help perceiving, {{that it has been}} an exceedingly irksome one." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, signor. I {{put them}} into my doublet when I saw you approaching, {{thinking}} that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> wish me to take them on shore at once." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] she said, [...] "I almost {{think you}} owe Mr. Austin a little, too. If he hadn't stopped the Estremedura <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> {{have been in}} Madeira now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Miss Stackpole let me know," [...] said Caspar Goodwood. [...] "She told me <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> be at {{home alone}} this evening and {{would be willing to}} see me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{you have}} been pretty bad, my lad, and have been light-headed {{for the past three}} or four days, and I did not for a moment expect that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> come round so soon. You must have a {{magnificent}} constitution, for most men, even if they recovered at all from such terrible wounds as <b>you</b> have had, <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> have been three or four times as long before the fever had run its course." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's not of importance--to me at least--that you didn't go; though I {{should have}} been glad to see you. I'm glad you're not in Rome now--which <b>you</b> might be, <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> be, if <b>you</b> had gone there a month ago. There's {{something}} I should like you to do at present in Florence." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Couldn't {{you have}} gone short in your {{payments}} before it got too big, and let him sell the place?" [...] suggested Drakesford. [...] "In that case, anything over and above what he advanced {{would have had to}} be refunded to you. Still, the man <b>you</b> dealt with <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> have provided for that difficulty." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{probably}} possess what {{is called}} a sense of honor," [...] Wingrave continued. [...] "You would certainly disapprove of some of my proceedings, and <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> disobey my orders." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You might do, but you won't, my lad; for {{if you did}} <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> {{start your}} wound {{bleeding}} afresh. You two had best take your shoes off directly you get on deck." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{would hardly}} go {{to a small}} place like Matching in your present position. There {{are so many people}} whom you should entertain! <b>You</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> have two or three of the foreign ministers down for a time." ...|$|E
60|$|You can't argue any more, after that. The machine {{would give}} way under the {{language}} {{you want to}} make use of. Half of what <b>you</b> feel <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> cause an explosion at some point where the wire was weak. Indeed, mere language of any kind would fall short of the requirements of the case. A hatchet and a gun are the only intermediaries through which you could convey your meaning by this time. So you give up all attempt to answer back, and meekly mention that you want to be put in communication with four-five-seven-six.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will not}} tell you what else I think of it because <b>you</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> not understand. For you, M. Danton, {{there is at least}} this excuse that you did not know me. But you, Isaac--to bring this gentleman here with such a proposal!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Even so. It {{would take}} too long to explain, and <b>you</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> not understand. Besides, you might take it--really, you might take it for a declaration. But {{it has nothing to}} do with you personally; it's what you represent. Fortunately you don't know all that, or your conceit would {{increase}} insufferably." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is necessary," [...] {{continued}} Edward, [...] "that public men {{be protected}} from intrusion, no matter how democratic they may be personally. <b>You</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> find it as difficult to approach the President of the United States as the King of England." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{are quite}} {{aware that you}} have ground to complain. Of course {{you can go on}} if you like. The fact that they have offered to apologise will no doubt be a point in their favour. Nevertheless <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> get a verdict." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pritchard is {{a clever}} man, generally," [...] she remarked, [...] "diabolically clever. Why has {{he told you}} all this, I wonder? He must have known that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> repeat it to me. Why {{does he want to}} show me his hand?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Unschoolers may {{question}} {{the school environment}} as one that is optimal for daily learning. According to Brain Rules by John Medina, [...] "If you wanted to create an education environment that was directly opposed to what the brain was good at doing, <b>you</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> create something like a classroom...."According to the Victorian Institute of Teaching here: 15 ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} {{thinking}} all night about those three men," [...] said Miss Markham, [...] "and I have imagined something which may have happened. Isn't it possible {{that they may have}} discovered at a distance some inland settlement which could not be seen by the party in the boat, and that they thought it their duty to push their way to it, and so get assistance for us? In that case, <b>you</b> know, they <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> be a long time coming back." ...|$|R
5000|$|So far, we {{have shown}} nothing {{that could not be}} done {{slightly}} more easily in a JavaScript library like jQuery. The power of declarative GUI development will become clear with the next example, showing a table with a rich interface. You should contrast the source code shown in the example below, with similar functionality in a jQuery plugin, where <b>you</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> see only a [...] on a page and where <b>you</b> <b>would</b> have to guess what the final appearance of the element would be from looking at the JavaScript code.|$|R
