5000|$|The primary {{difference}} between a budget and a CAFR is a budget is {{a plan for a}} specific fiscal period (often a year) primarily showing where tax income is to be allocated. The CAFR contains the results of the period (year) with previous years accumulations. A CAFR shows the total of all financial accounting that a general purpose budget reports does not. The CAFR contains a section that provides a comparison of period budget and actual. Additionally, the CAFR gives a detailed showing of investment accounts by category reflecting balances over previous years, or in plain language using a personal example in comparison would be the {{difference between}}: <b>Your</b> house <b>Budget</b> for the year vs your statement of [...] "Net Worth" [...] covering the financial accounting over your lifetime. 1-year vs your lifetime.|$|R

50|$|There {{are several}} types of {{lighting}} units which can sustain indoor plants, Fluorescent, Halide or Diode. Choosing the best type depends on the need of the plants grown and/or <b>your</b> <b>budget.</b> For the sake of efficiency, incandescents, no matter how cheap, should not be used. Not only do they provide little or no benefit to plants, {{but the cost of}} the electricity will outweigh the cost of purchasing multiple incandescent bulbs and fixtures in the long run. Fluorescents are mass marketed. CFL fluorescents are the cheapest option, but more than a couple bulbs are almost always required to be running at once. The next step up is shop lights, available mostly in 2-ft (609 mm) or 4-ft (1219 mm) fluorescent tubes. The best type of fluorescent are called High Output Fluorescents. Also available in 2-ft (609 mm) and 4-ft(1219 mm) tubes, these bulbs provide more wattage (54 watts each is standard) thus more lumens per watt (92 at the current time). That is about 5,000 lumens per dual 4-ft (1219 mm) H.O. Fluorescent Unit. The most serious lights that are used by professionals and in greenhouses as a supplement, are known as Metal Halide or High Pressure Sodium Grow Lights. These lights provide the most lumens, heat and intensity of light so they should be positioned respectively further from the tops of plants to prevent burning. LED or Light Emitting Diode grow lights which produce the photosynthetic optimum red (640-670 nm) and blue (430-460 nm), they have long life expectancies, and efficiency, 100 watts producing 3,400 lumens output from a unit 400x212x62mm, they are also rather cool, so you can have them quite close to the plants.|$|E
5000|$|In January 2011, Setzer {{quit his}} job {{to work at the}} brewery full-time. [...] "Everyone around me told me I was crazy," [...] he {{recalled}} to USA Today later in the year. That spring Vanden Berg came to China to take {{a more active role in}} the business. The warming weather improved business as patrons could sit outside. Enough other bar owners came by asking if they could sell the beer that Setzer decided it was time to get into distribution. Sales were so strong that by the summer Great Leap was converting a farmhouse in Tianxianlu, near the Mutianyu section of the Great Wall, into a brewery, using equipment better suited to large-scale industrial production, to meet demand. [...] In China and India you have access to spices that would break <b>your</b> <b>budget</b> (elsewhere). But here, they're like a penny for a pound. You can't help but see what works and what doesn't. It's all helped. Chinese customers come in and see the ingredients on the board, and get really curious. The last thing a Chinese customer wants is to feel like they don't know what they're doing. So if they can come in and see that one of our beers is named after a character of the Three Kingdoms, or has spices or a style of tea that they drank when they were kids, it's easier for them, just out of curiosity to pick that one. They don't have to ask a foreigner, or friends, they just say, oh I want to see what that is. Anything with Sichuan peppercorn or tea—they go for that first because they just want to see how that manifests itself in a glass. - Carl Setzer As Setzer had hoped, younger Chinese drinkers, many of whom had been introduced to craft beers abroad, were joining the expatriates as customers. By July they were making up 70% of the brewery's customer base. [...] "Some come, they think, 'That's a bit weird,' and leave after one drink," [...] Liu said. [...] "But then they come back the next day, the next week, and bring their friends, too." [...] She observed that, among younger Chinese, the longstanding tradition of consuming alcoholic beverages only in the form of grain-based spirits with meals seemed to be changing thanks to the introduction of beers like Great Leap's.|$|E
