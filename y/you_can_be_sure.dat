The {{last day of}} regular services was Saturday 10 June 1961 when a pair of C class 0-6-0's replaced the usual H class tanks. The event was recorded by a BBC cameraman who filmed the 09:07 departure from Paddock Wood. The Tonbridge crew had chalked on the cabside of the engine [...] "Shed no tears for the single track, for perhaps we may come back. And if we do, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure,</b> we'll see you all again once more." [...] Later in the day the trains were lengthened {{with the addition of}} former LSWR push-pull set No. 656 and a Maunsell corridor coach. The same locomotive worked the last 17:00 train from Hawkhurst, while every seat was taken by locals and railway enthusiasts. The daughter of bandleader Jack Payne was on-hand to toast the final departure.|$|E
500|$|On another occasion, {{when she}} visited Bermuda, she {{was invited to}} a {{reception}} and chose to walk rather than be driven. She became thirsty along the way and stopped at a house, where she asked a black woman named Mrs McCarthy {{for a glass of}} water. Owing to the scarcity of water, the woman had to go some distance to obtain it, but was reluctant because she had to finish her ironing. When Louise offered to continue the ironing, the woman refused, adding that she was in a great hurry to finish so that she could go and see Princess Louise. Realising that she had not been recognised, Louise enquired whether McCarthy would recognise her again. When the woman said that she would have thought so, but was admittedly unsure, Louise replied: [...] "Well {{take a good look at}} me now, so <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> to know me tomorrow at St. Georges." [...] The Princess clung to her privacy, and enjoyed not being recognised.|$|E
500|$|Stephen Holden from The New York Times wrote, [...] "This {{version of}} The Mummy has no pretenses to be {{anything}} other than a gaudy comic video game splashed onto the screen. Think Raiders of the Lost Ark with cartoon characters, no coherent story line and lavish but cheesy special effects. Think Night of the Living Dead stripped of genuine horror and restaged as an Egyptian-theme Halloween pageant. Think Abbott and Costello Meet the Mummy grafted onto a Bing Crosby-Bob Hope road picture (The Road to Hamunaptra?) and pumped up into an epic-size genre spoof." [...] Publications like The Austin Chronicle and Dallas Observer {{came to the conclusion that}} despite good acting and special effects, the movie lacked cohesion; talking about the special effects, the Observer lamented [...] "If only generating a soul for the film itself were so easy." [...] Other publications such as Jump Cut felt that Industrial Light and Magic's lock on special effects proved detrimental to The Mummy; [...] "The mummy", Ernest Larson wrote for the Jump Cut, [...] "is standard-issue I.L.". Kim Newman of the British Film Institute judged the picture inferior to the original, as all the time was spent on special effects, instead of creating the atmosphere which made the original film such a classic. USA Today gave the film two out of four stars and felt that it was [...] "not free of stereotypes", a sentiment with which the BFI concurred. [...] "If someone complains of a foul odor, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> an Arab stooge is about to enter a scene. Fraser, equally quick with weapon, fist or quip, may save the day, but even he can't save the picture", USA Today wrote.|$|E

He {{was given an}} office in the West Wing in 1969 and regularly interacted with the Nixon administration hierarchy. He was named Director of the Economic Stabilization Program in 1970 as well, and later headed up the Cost of Living Council. In March 1971 Nixon was recorded saying about Rumsfeld [...] "at least Rummy is tough enough" [...] and [...] "He's a ruthless little bastard. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> of that." ...|$|E
2500|$|On the one hand, {{film and}} {{television}} producers seem to find Catholicism irresistible. There {{are a number of}} reasons for this. First, more than any other Christian denomination, the Catholic Church is supremely visual, and therefore attractive to producers and directors concerned with the visual image. Vestments, monstrances, statues, crucifixes – {{to say nothing of the}} symbols of the sacraments – are all things that more [...] "word oriented" [...] Christian denominations have foregone. The Catholic Church, therefore, lends itself perfectly to the visual media of {{film and television}}. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> that any movie about the Second Coming or Satan or demonic possession or, for that matter, any sort of irruption of the transcendent into everyday life, will choose the Catholic Church as its venue. (See, for example, [...] "End of Days," [...] "Dogma" [...] or [...] "Stigmata.") ...|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "joke" [...] {{was evidently}} {{already in the}} {{mainstream}} by the very early 1970s; in the October 1972 edition of MAD magazine (issue no. 154), an article entitled [...] "When Watching Television, <b>You</b> <b>Can</b> <b>be</b> <b>Sure</b> of Seeing...", gossip columnist 'Rona Boring' states: [...] "And there isn't a grain of truth to the vicious rumor that movie and TV star Rock Heman and singer Jim Nelly were secretly married! Rock and Jim are just good buddies! I repeat, they are not married! They are not even going steady!" [...] Those who failed to get the joke spread the rumor and as a result, Hudson and Nabors never spoke to each other again. Three years later, Nabors would begin a long-term (and, until 2013, secret) relationship with Stan Cadwallader, a retired firefighter from Honolulu and the man he would eventually marry once same-sex marriage was legalized.|$|E

2500|$|Following the lynching on October 16, 2000, Riccardo Cristiano, {{the deputy}} {{head of the}} Jerusalem bureau of Italy's state {{television}} channel RAI, published a letter (...) in Al-Hayat al-Jadida, the official daily newspaper of the Palestinian Authority (PA). In the letter (entitled [...] "Special Clarification by the Italian Representative of RAI, the Official Italian Television Station"), Cristiano denies that RAI had any involvement with the filming of the incident {{and that one of}} the station's Italian competitors was responsible for the footage. He wrote, [...] "We [...] emphasize to all of you that the events did not happen this way, because we always respect (will continue to respect) the journalistic procedures with the Palestinian Authority for (journalistic) work in Palestine and we are credible in our precise work." [...] The Italian correspondent also praised the PA, declaring, [...] "We congratulate you [...] and think that it is our duty to put you in the picture (of the events) of what happened on October 12 in Ramallah....
