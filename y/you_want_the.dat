[...] The political scientists David Butler and Dennis Kavanagh noted that this question was often mocked for its [...] "unrealistic ambiguity", and some journalists referred to Goldsmith's venture as the [...] "Referendum Only Party". Goldsmith did not position the party as explicitly opposed to the EU, instead stating that it was [...] "wholly agnostic" [...] about EU membership and just wanted to secure a referendum on the issue. However, the wording of the party's main question led one group of political scientists to note that it [...] "clearly revealed Goldsmith's Eurosceptic colours" [...] and that the wider pronouncements of the party became increasingly Eurosceptic as time went on.|$|E

Smithers's recollection of his marriage parodies the two plays Cat on a Hot Tin Roof and A Streetcar Named Desire, both written by American playwright Tennessee Williams. Homer's bedroom rant to Marge is a parody mishmash of four popular films: ...And Justice for All (1979), A Few Good Men (1992), Patton (1970), and Chinatown (1974). He says: [...] "Look Marge, you don't know what it's like. I'm the one out there every day putting his ass on the line. And I'm not out of order! You're out of order.
