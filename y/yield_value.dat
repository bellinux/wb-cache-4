40|$|Aluminium {{zirconium}} tetrachlorohydrex glycine (AZG) is {{a popular}} antiperspirant/ deodorant agent, formulated in various forms including the clear gels. Silicones are used for the preparation of these gels, giving them desirable characteristics. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the influence of various silicones, when used in combination, on the rheological properties of the resulting AZG gels prepared. Based on preliminary studies, various AZG containing silicone-based gel formulations were prepared. Silicones used (as ternary mixtures) included ABIL ® EM 97, ABIL ® 8839 and ABIL ® 8852. Formulations prepared were then examined rheologically and their plastic viscosity and <b>yield</b> <b>values</b> determined. Results showed that the amount of ABIL ® EM 97 (used as an emulsifier) present within the gel formulation is critical. An increase in the amount of this silicone, corresponding to a small decrease in the amount of the hydrophobic structure building (gelling agent) ABIL ® B 8839, increased the plastic viscosity and <b>yield</b> <b>values</b> of the gel.

40|$|A {{vibration}} rheometer {{has been}} developed {{for the purpose of}} determining the viscosity coefficient and the <b>yield</b> <b>value</b> of fresh concrete under vibration. The main parts of the apparatus, a test specimen and a vibration source form a unitary oscillatory system whose parameters can be measured with sufficient precision. Two types of fine grained reference material have been prepared and examined; one with a high coefficient of viscosity and the other with a high <b>yield</b> <b>value.</b> The rheological properties of reference materials have been determined in a capillary tube viscometer. Since there is no analytical solution to the flow in the vibration rheometer, the constants of the vibration rheometer have been determined by experiment, for each position of the apparatus piston within the measuring range. The parameters of the flow depend on the maximum acceleration of the vibration source. An increase in acceleration causes an increase in the <b>yield</b> <b>value</b> as well as a reduction in the plastic viscosity coefficient of the material specimen.
