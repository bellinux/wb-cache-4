At {{the beginning of her}} career, she was often described by the press as having a vivacious personality and a bubbly, outgoing persona, an image she had confessed to disliking. According to film critic Sukanya Verma, Zinta's energetic nature extends from her real life into her appearances in films and {{is an integral part of}} her technique. In an article discussing Hindi film actresses and their flair for comedy, Verma wrote, [...] "What can <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> an actress who giggles non-stop in a tone that is anything but prim and propah? She is carefree. She is animated. She talks non-stop. She laughs all the time. She has a chilled out sense of humour. And a tomboyish streak too. Preity Zinta is all that and more. All this greatly contributes to her style of acting." ...|$|E
500|$|Metro complimented the visuals of the remaster, {{saying that}} [...] "The game still doesn't look {{quite as good}} as the last couple of Call Of Duty's, but it's {{extremely}} close. And whatever else <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> it, on a presentational level this is an excellent remaster." [...] The multiplayer they praised for being more pleasingly simple than recent Call of Duty games and pointed out how it was sure to bring considerable nostalgia to players of the original, but nonetheless criticized it for feeling limited and shallow. They also noted that the remaster inadvertently felt clichéd and overfamiliar, due to the original having inspired numerous sequels and imitations, but praised the modern-day setting as feeling surprisingly fresh again. Metro summarized their review by saying [...] "One of the most influential video games of all time gets the remaster it deserves, and is still impressively entertaining after all these years." ...|$|E

Lappas said, [...] "What else do <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> Anthony Anderson? He had thirteen rebounds in the game. Its {{great to see}} Anthony have six points {{in the game and}} win. We couldn't have one a game like this in a million years with Anthony Anderson only scoring six points. You don't even notice it now, where when he didn't score before we almost didn't have a chance. It's good for him {{to go out there and}} play and direct these kids that he has out there under him." [...] In mid-December 2004, Anderson was suspended for three games after failing a drug test. Lappas called it a [...] "violation of team rules." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Electioneering", {{featuring}} a cowbell and a distorted guitar solo, is the album's most rock-oriented track {{and one of}} the heaviest songs Radiohead has recorded. It has been compared to Radiohead's earlier style on Pablo Honey. The cynical [...] "Electioneering" [...] is the album's most directly political song, with lyrics inspired by the Poll Tax Riots. The song was also inspired by Chomsky's , a book analysing contemporary mass media under the propaganda model.

[...] Regarding its oblique political references, Yorke said, [...] "What can <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> the IMF, or politicians? Or people selling arms to African countries, employing slave labour or whatever. What can you say? You just write down 'Cattle prods and the IMF' and people who know, know."
