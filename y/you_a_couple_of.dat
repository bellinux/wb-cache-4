2500|$|Rick Moranis {{drove me}} out of my mind. There's this whole wave of insult comedy. In the real world, if someone insults <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> times, you can smack them. Or punch them. You can't do that on a movie set. And these comedians walk around, and they can say {{whatever}} they want. I'm just not that handy with that. Comedians are a special breed. They can antagonize you and say whatever they... want, and you can't do anything to stop them... He's this weird looking little guy who couldn't get laid in a whore house with a fistful of fifties. He would imitate me. The first thing he says to me is, [...] "Do you just act cool, or are you really cool?" [...] That was the first sentence out of his mouth to me in Joel Silver's office. And I was like, [...] "Oh... {{this is not going to}} go well." [...] But he was one of Joel's dear friends, and he ended up making a bunch of movies for Disney. I just wasn't that sharp. I wasn't ready for that kind of crap.|$|E
6000|$|... "Plenty," [...] the man said. [...] "I will fetch <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> long coils {{from the}} stables. Here, one of you, {{come along with}} me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hope you aren't {{going to}} pull out, Kelley? You suit me, and if it's a {{question}} of pay, I'll raise <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> dollars on a week." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mike," [...] she said, [...] "I've {{lived with}} <b>thee</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> years, and {{had nothing but}} temper! Now I'm no more to 'ee; I'll try my luck elsewhere. 'Twill be better for me and Elizabeth-Jane, both. So good-bye!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Won't <b>you</b> take <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> bisques, dear?" [...] {{he asked}} affectionately, after a while. [...] "I don't like always beating <b>you</b> by such <b>a</b> lot." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I don't know. I can't {{answer that}} yet. I'm too busy. I'll {{have to talk}} to <b>you</b> later. <b>A</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> friends are coming to get me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A little impatient," [...] she answered. [...] "He {{is going}} to sell <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> {{thousand}} acres of moor and a tumble-down manse for thirty thousand pounds." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{will have}} to help me carry her off, Jim, and the day that she signs her name Bertha Carthew I will give <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> {{thousand}} pounds." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{had no idea}} it was so bad as that, Gordon. Surely {{there must}} be some other way out of the difficulty. I could lend <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> hundred pounds." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I see that. I don't {{like the}} color of your face.... Well, well, Daren. It was hell, wasn't it? Did <b>you</b> kill <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> Huns for me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, it {{is better}} to have it all done and over," [...] he said, [...] "than to have the thing hanging over <b>you</b> for <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> months." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come in, {{and smoke}} a cigar. You've got all night before {{you if you}} want to do Marathons. I haven't seen <b>you</b> for <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> months. I want you to tell me all the news." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm goin' to tell <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> things, old boss," [...] Billy answered. [...] "Number one: you ain't goin' to pull us. Number two: we're goin' {{to sleep}} the night out here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Groome, sir," [...] he pronounced, [...] "you are a wizard! You {{must have}} seen right through into the breast pocket of my coat. Allow me to read <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> letters." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never {{mind your}} wife and children," [...] said his benefactor, putting down the empty pewter. [...] "You eat that up and I’ll give <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> loaves to take home to them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mannering," [...] he said, [...] "I did {{not come}} here to simper cheap philosophies with <b>you</b> like <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> schoolgirls. I have a real live errand. I {{want to speak to}} you of great things." ...|$|R
6000|$|Arthur Berkeley {{opened his}} eyes wide with unspeakable amazement. 'What, YOU here,' he exclaimed, coming forward {{suddenly}} {{to shake hands with}} Hilda; 'why, I saw <b>you</b> only <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> hours since at the Le Bretons' at Holloway.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, you mustn't do that; {{that would}} only make more talk. Go on with your plans. I'll stay here with you. It won't take <b>you</b> but <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> days to do the work, and Wayland needs the rest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Keep it from Miller {{as long as}} possible. If {{you hear}} any one else talking of it, tell ’em {{to keep it from}} him. If he marries her I’ll give <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> pints." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Mr. Upton, I {{like your}} looks, and if you'll accept it I'll loan <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> dollars. I {{suppose it was}} partly my fault that Smith robbed you. But don't blame me, I've suffered, too." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Have <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> days to spare? Have {{just been}} wired for {{from the west}} of England in {{connection}} with Boscombe Valley tragedy. Shall be glad if you will come with me. Air and scenery perfect. Leave Paddington by the 11:15." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, youngster," [...] he said, [...] "so we're {{likely to}} have a brush. I see <b>you</b> have <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> gun cases under your berth. <b>You</b> are <b>a</b> good deal better {{provided}} than most lads who go out as writers.|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{made you}} let me sleep so long?" [...] he asked, with just a shade of {{irritation}} in his tone. [...] "I was better able to stand watch than <b>you,</b> an' <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> hours' sleep would a'-fixed me up all right." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I beg pardon, my dear, {{here are}} but four; and you {{remember}} {{two on the}} corner, and four on the points. Doctor, I will trouble <b>you</b> for <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> guineas from Miss Wigram's store, I am in haste {{to get to the}} Countess's route." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Have {{you got any}} more, young fellow?" [...] asked Warrington. [...] "We {{must make}} them give <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> guineas a page; and if the verses are liked, why, you'll get an entree into Bacon's magazines, and may turn a decent penny." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now I {{can have}} a GOOD look at you; and, laws-a-me, I've been hungry for it a many and a many a time, all these long years, and it's come at last! We been expecting <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> days and more. What kep' you?--boat get aground?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{want you}} to put us ashore on the left bank {{as soon as we}} are our of sight of the town," [...] Captain Heraugiere said. [...] "As it will be heavy work getting your boat back with only two of you, I will give <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> crowns beyond the amount I bargained with you for." ...|$|E
60|$|HECTOR. Oh, don't explain. We understand. <b>You</b> have <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> {{thousand}} pounds in exchequer bills, 50,000 shares worth tenpence a dozen, {{and half a}} dozen tabloids of cyanide of potassium to poison yourself with when you are found out. That's the reality of your millions.|$|R
5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{reference to}} a death ray in literature is in the P.G. Wodehouse short story, [...] "The Rummy Affair of Old Biffy" [...] published in 1925, in which Bertie Wooster describes Sir Roderick Glossop as having [...] "eyes that go through <b>you</b> like <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> Death Rays.” ...|$|R
6000|$|Trembling, {{and in a}} great flutter, Morgiana put on her bonnet and gloves, {{and went}} towards the door. [...] "It's a fine morning," [...] said Mr. Walker, looking out: [...] "a walk will do you good; and--Morgiana--didn't you say <b>you</b> had <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> guineas in your pocket?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Dick, {{you jump}} up behind me," [...] his father said. [...] "Dunlop can take you, Ned; {{and you can}} give us a short account of what has befallen you as we ride back. We must get <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> horses of some kind or another at Synee. Can't you cast off these women's clothes?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Come now,' {{she said}} to the man, in a reasonable, coldly-coaxing tone, 'put your coat on and leave us alone. Be a man, and not worse than a brute of a German. You can get a bed easy enough in St Just, and if you've nothing to pay for it {{sergeant}} would lend <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> shillings, I'm sure he would.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thought you}} wasn't achin' terrible {{bad for a}} fight," [...] and Dan flourished his fists {{precisely}} as Sam had done while trying to provoke Seth. [...] "Yell for the perlice, will yer? I've a precious good mind to give <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> black eyes, only that I hate to hit a feller who don't dare to put up his hands." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! I {{know that}} well enough, Maud; {{and to say}} the truth, <b>you</b> are <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> idolaters, between <b>you.</b> Mamma says this, sometimes; though she owns she is not jealous. But it would pain her {{excessively}} to hear {{that you do not}} feel towards Bob, just as we all feel." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Say, if <b>you</b> get <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> runs {{this time}} we'll be It. Look at the students. Ready {{to fall out}} of the stands.... Peg, I'm glad Herne got a run. Now we won't think of a shut-out. That'll steady us up. And, boys, break loose now, for the game's ours." ...|$|R
6000|$|RAINA (to Bluntschli with an {{intuitive}} guess at {{his state of}} mind). I daresay <b>you</b> think us <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> grown up babies, don't you? ...|$|R
