'St. Paul Missionary Baptist Church Blues' {{focuses on}} the {{decaying}} value of a real life abandoned church in Grand Rapids and how that was a striking contrast to the popularity of other churches. 'Edit Your Hometown', {{has been described as}} [...] "treading the boundary between melodrama and actual drama" [...] by Ben Patashnik of 'Rock Sound'. 'The Most Beautiful Bitter Fruit' deals with the hypothetical author's sexuality, by exploring and questioning his inability to participate in casual sex. 'King Park', a seven-minute ballad, focuses on inner-city gang culture and follows the perspective of an individual who is engrossed by a drive-by shooting; and also follows how the drive by shooter, plagued by guilt, commits suicide. Dreyer described the true story behind the song: [...] "A <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>ago,</b> down the street from where Brad and I work, a kid was shot. It's an area that's been riddled with gang violence, which has been really sad to witness." [...] 'Edward Benz, 27 Times' {{is the story of a}} father dealing with the pain of being brutally attacked by his schizophrenic son, while [...] "I See Everything" [...] describes parents losing their seven-year-old son to cancer.|$|E

60|$|In writing this, moreover, {{there is}} a very great {{difficulty}} in steering my way between two equally undesirable tones in the telling. In the first place I do not want to seem to confess my sins with a penitence I am very doubtful if I feel. Now that I have got Isabel we can no doubt count the cost of it and feel unquenchable regrets, but I am not sure whether, if we could be put back now into such circumstances as we were in a <b>year</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> whether with my eyes fully open I should not do over again very much as I did. And on the other hand I do not want to justify the things we have done. We are two bad people--if there is to be any classification of good and bad at all, we have acted badly, and quite apart from any other considerations we've largely wasted our own very great possibilities. But {{it is part of a}} queer humour that underlies all this, that I find myself slipping again and again into a sentimental treatment of our case that is as unpremeditated as it is insincere. When I am a little tired after a morning's writing I find the faint suggestion getting into every other sentence that our blunders and misdeeds embodied, after the fashion of the prophet Hosea, profound moral truths. Indeed, I feel so little confidence in my ability to keep this altogether out of my book that I warn the reader here that in spite of anything he may read elsewhere in the story, intimating however shyly an esoteric and exalted virtue in our proceedings, the plain truth of this business is that Isabel and I wanted each other with a want entirely formless, inconsiderate, and overwhelming. And though I could tell you countless delightful and beautiful things about Isabel, were this a book in her praise, I cannot either analyse that want or account for its extreme intensity.|$|R

60|$|I gave {{a lecture}} to the Eton boys a <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>ago,</b> on {{little more than}} the shepherd's dog, which is yet more {{wonderful}} in magnified scale of photograph. The lecture is partly published--somewhere, but I can't refer to it.|$|E
6000|$|... "I believe," [...] said Gerald, [...] "that {{he joined}} the Wills-of-the-Wisp, that company which was got up by Sir Lewis Willingham, and played at Devereux Castle a <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>ago.</b> Some one {{told me they were}} wonderfully {{effective}} for amateurs." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Nonsense," [...] said Mrs Neverbend; [...] "are {{you going}} to send the poor boy to break his neck among the glaciers? Don't you {{remember}} that Dick Ardwinkle was lost there a <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>ago,</b> and came to his death in a most frightful manner?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And so I {{thanked her}} and went. She was {{certainly}} a very remarkable woman. A <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>ago</b> I heard that her father Nala was dead, {{and that she had}} succeeded to the chieftainship of both tribes, which she ruled with great justice and firmness.|$|E
6000|$|... “Quite {{right of}} her,” said Mrs. Yonelet with vague approval; “it’s what any girl of spirit would have done. Still, {{that was a}} <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>ago,</b> I believe; Bertie is older now, and so is Teresa. Naturally she must be anxious to see him settled.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{went away}} by train a day <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>ago,</b> {{and if he}} had had {{anything}} to fear, he would have made his escape then," [...] she said.|$|R
6000|$|Wilson {{shook his}} head. [...] "I don’t know," [...] he said gloomily, [...] "I don’t know. He was here an hour <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>ago.</b> He was here yesterday." ...|$|R
6000|$|Townshead turned towards her. [...] "You fancied so {{a moment}} <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>ago,</b> {{and now you}} are sure," [...] he said. [...] "There must be some meaning to this." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No doubt," [...] replied Donatello,--"but I {{know little}} of such things, and never could {{comprehend}} the interest {{which some of}} you Forestieri take in them. A <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>ago</b> an English signore, with a venerable white beard--they say he was a magician, too--came hither from as far off as Florence, just to see my tower." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So be it, sir, I will go; but first, as {{an honest}} man and my father's friend, and, as I thought, my own, answer me one question. Why have you changed your tune to me of late? Am I not the same Christopher Harflete I was a <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>ago?</b> And have I done aught to lower me in the world's eye or in yours?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{so you see}} {{you might}} as well have done it a <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>ago</b> when perhaps things would have been simpler. Well, it is a fine example of the vanity of human plans, and, Alan, we must be going home to lunch. If we don't, Sir Robert will be {{organizing}} a search party to look for us; in fact, I shouldn't wonder if he is doing that already, in the wrong direction." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes; {{but he will}} be so angry. When that lot of fellows a <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>ago</b> did {{something}} like it, and shot some of the Abbotstoke rabbits, don't you remember how much he said about its being disgraceful, and ordering us never {{to have anything to}} do with their gunnery? And he will think it so very bad to have gone out on a lark just now! Oh, I wish I hadn't done it." ...|$|E
6000|$|We {{were all}} {{assembled}} shortly before dinner, {{and he was}} still at the piano idly picking out in his luxurious way little strains of music, and talking between whiles of finishing some sketches of the ruined old Verulam wall to-morrow, which he had begun a <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>ago</b> and had got tired of, when a card was brought in and my guardian read aloud in a surprised voice, [...] "Sir Leicester Dedlock!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{almost as}} dead to hope as I am to shame. Some <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>ago</b> I {{should have thought}} it {{impossible}} to bear the eyes of people looking at me, as though my life had been sinful and impure. I seem now to care nothing for all that. I can look them back again with bold eyes and a brazen face, {{and tell them that}} their hardness is at any rate as bad as my impurity." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{fact that}} a famous inquiry agent has traced your {{movements}} down to a week <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>ago,</b> and told me where to find you, will render that simple," [...] said the lawyer dryly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then it {{has come}} on very suddenly," [...] said Austin. [...] "You seemed all right a moment <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>ago.</b> Am I to {{understand}} that somebody gave you five pounds to look after me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, thanks. I breakfasted quite early at Euston. I came up by a night train, {{and might}} have been here an hour <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>ago,</b> but {{preferred}} to wait until your usual getting-up hour." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I {{must say}} I {{thought that was}} a nasty story a <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>ago</b> about the man who said he had stolen jewels," [...] said Cei. [...] "It got hushed up somehow; but I {{remember}} Piero di Cosimo said, at the time, he believed there was something in it, for he saw Melema's face when the man laid hold of him, and he never saw a visage so `painted with fear,' as our sour old Dante says." ...|$|E
6000|$|We {{might have}} {{extended}} this chapter {{to a much}} greater length--we might have carried the comparison into the liberal professions--we might have shown, as was in fact our original purpose, that each is in itself a little pantomime with scenes and characters of its own, complete; but, as we fear we have been quite lengthy enough already, we shall leave this chapter just where it is. A gentleman, not altogether unknown as a dramatic poet, wrote thus a <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>ago</b> - ...|$|E
60|$|Now {{there is}} no real {{difficulty}} about teaching drill and the simpler kinds of gymnastics. It is done admirably well, for example, in the North Surrey Union schools; and a <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>ago</b> when I had an opportunity of inspecting these schools, I was greatly struck with the effect of such training upon the poor little waifs and strays of humanity, mostly picked out of the gutter, who are being made into cleanly, healthy, and useful members of society in that excellent institution.|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{came back}} an hour <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>ago.</b> Maggy Ann saw her go past. Fancy her seeing her father at last! It {{must have been}} an ordeal for her. I wonder what took place." ...|$|R
