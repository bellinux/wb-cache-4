We would talk a little bit until she got the lyrics all nicely coordinated and done. And then we just waited until the {{sessions}} began, which were in the summer of '94 where we got together in New York and started recording. And that's when we first hear her at the microphone singing, and the rest is history.|$|E
5|$|When <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> Goya, {{who painted}} the most horrendous {{pictures}} {{of violence and}} torture and so forth, and they're amazing, exquisite paintings, {{one of the reasons}} they're such wonderful paintings is because what he's saying is, 'Look– look at this.' So if you paint it badly or put it in the sort of wrong perspective, you draw more attention to what's wrong with the image rather than looking at the image.|$|E

25|$|In linguistics, wh-movement (also {{known as}} wh-fronting or wh-extraction or long-distance dependency) {{concerns}} special rules of syntax—rules observed in many languages around the world—involving {{the placement of}} interrogative words. The special interrogatives, whatever the language, are known within linguistics as wh-words (so named because most interrogative words in the English language start with a wh-; for example, who(m), whose, what, which, etc.). Wh-words are used to form questions, and can also occur in relative clauses. In languages exhibiting wh-movement, sentences or clauses containing a wh-word show a special word order that has the wh-word (or phrase containing the wh-word) appearing {{at the front of}} the sentence or clause, e.g. Who do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about?,</b> instead of in a more canonical position further to the right, e.g. I think about you. The opposite is called wh in situ.|$|E
500|$|David Houghton of Game Revolution {{said that}} despite its flaws, the game [...] "feels like {{the revival of}} not just a brand, but a genre." [...] Polygon's Russ Pitts criticized the [...] "weird dichotomy" [...] of the game's {{strategy}} component, but praised the tactical gameplay, calling it [...] "one {{of the best and}} most artfully designed strategy games in recent memory." [...] Edwin Evans-Thirlwell of Official Xbox Magazine stated that it [...] "isn't just Xbox 360's finest strategy experience – it's also a strategy game which changes how <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> strategy games." ...|$|E

And when <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it, that's also Peter Parker's core issue." [...] The episode's title, [...] "Interactions," [...] expands the series theme [...] "The Education of Peter Parker" [...] chosen by developer Greg Weisman.

500|$|Beginning in February 2007, Nielsen {{began playing}} a small {{role as a}} doctor in the humorous yet {{educational}} television show Doctor*Ology. The show chronicles real-life medical techniques and technology, on the Discovery Channel. Nielsen said: [...] "There {{are any number of}} things that <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> when you ponder if you hadn't been an actor, what would you be, and I've always said I'd like to be an astronaut or a doctor. I have such admiration for doctors. I just don't know how you go around to thank them enough for coming up with the world's most remarkable new discoveries." ...|$|E
500|$|AllMusic's Heather Phares {{described}} the album as more consistent than most remix collections {{and noted that}} it functions well as a record in its own right. Priya Elan of NME explained that [...] "the results are pretty much all quality" [...] {{and that some of}} the tracks are better than the original songs on Silent Alarm. Rockfeedback's Thomas Hannan stated, [...] "It's all very clever, but the most intelligent thing about it is that it makes <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> the original in a completely altered way." [...] Pitchfork Media's Nitsuh Adebe was impressed with the album and indicated that it is [...] "surprisingly good, and surprisingly often".|$|E
500|$|Nielsen {{himself was}} {{ambiguous}} about his attitudes to late Romantic German music and to nationalism in music. He {{wrote to the}} Dutch composer Julius Röntgen in 1909 [...] "I am surprised by the technical skills of the Germans nowadays, and I cannot help thinking that all this delight in complication must exhaust itself. I foresee a completely new art of pure archaic virtue. What do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> songs sung in unison? We must go back... to the pure and the clear." [...] On the other hand, he wrote in 1925 [...] "Nothing destroys music more than nationalism does... and {{it is impossible to}} deliver national music on request." ...|$|E

In pop music generally, people have one image. You get pigeonholed. I'm lucky {{enough to be able to}} change and still be accepted.

500|$|As with {{previous}} ceremonies he produced, Cates centered the show around a theme. This year, he christened {{the show with}} the theme [...] "Togetherness of Moviegoing" [...] commenting, [...] "The thing that's kind of wonderful about movies is that you watch them with other people. The only other areas where you do that, when <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it, are religion and sports." [...] He concluded by noting that the movie theater is [...] "a wonderful place where you come together to laugh, to cry." [...] In tandem with the theme, actress Winona Ryder presented a montage featuring film clips from Matinee, Casablanca, and A Streetcar Named Desire depicting audiences inside a movie theater.|$|E
500|$|Clocking in at {{over two}} hours in length and {{containing}} 34 tracks, The Astonishing was planned as an immersive experience that would be best enjoyed as a full album {{as opposed to a}} collection of singles. The album plays out similarly to a film, with Loudwire observing, [...] "It’s an enormous amount of music to absorb in one sitting, but when <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it, most movies are around {{two hours in}} length, and The Astonishing is very much like a movie in the way it delivers the storyline." [...] Certain songs, such as [...] "A Savior in the Square" [...] and [...] "Our New World", have reoccurring themes, while others stand more on their own in order to move the plot along.|$|E

The lyrics are written in a form of an [...] "open letter" [...] in which the singer praises her mother's courage for ending a dysfunctional marriage. At the beginning of the song, Beyoncé sings, [...] "Mama, I understand your many sleepless nights / When <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> father / and how you tried to be the perfect wife... I wish you didn’t hurt at all." [...] Alex Frank of Vogue noted how the song was thematically [...] "an enlightened follow-up" [...] to [...] "Single Ladies", discussing a similar private subject matter for the singer.

500|$|David is an android {{that acts}} as the ship's butler and {{maintenance}} man. It {{is designed to be}} indistinguishable from humans, and begins to develop [...] "its own ego, insecurities, jealousy and envy". Writer Damon Lindelof stated that the character provides a non-human perspective on the film's events, and said, [...] "what does the movie look like from the robot's point of view? If you were to ask him, 'What do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> all of this? What's going on? What do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> these humans who are around you?' Wouldn't it be cool if we found a way for that robot to answer those questions?" [...] Fassbender said, [...] "David's views on the human crew are somewhat childlike. He is jealous and arrogant because he realizes that his knowledge is all-encompassing, and therefore he is superior to the humans. David wants to be acknowledged and praised for his brilliance". In developing his character, Fassbender avoided watching the android characters of Alien (1979) and Aliens (1986), and instead studied the replicants in Scott's 1982 science fiction film Blade Runner, with a focus on Sean Young's character Rachael, whose [...] "vacancy" [...] and longing for a soul interested him. Fassbender drew further inspiration from the voice of the HAL 9000 computer in , the [...] "funny walk and economy of movement" [...] of Olympic diver Greg Louganis, and the performances of David Bowie in The Man Who Fell to Earth, Dirk Bogarde in The Servant, and Peter O'Toole in Lawrence of Arabia. David's blond hair was modeled on that of T. E. Lawrence. Scott favored Fassbender for the role; by January 2011 he was confirmed to have joined the cast, despite earlier reports that his agents had sought too high a fee.|$|E

[...] He proved correct; the silver enthusiasm waned by September and Bryan had no ready replacement for it. [...] McKinley, {{on the other}} hand, convinced that his [...] "sound money" [...] campaign had worked, began to promote his tariff issue, stating to the crowds on his front lawn, [...] "I {{do not know what}} <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it, but I believe it is a good deal better to open the mills of the United States to the labor of America than to open the mints of the United States to the silver of the world." ...|$|E

500|$|The video {{has been}} {{described}} as [...] "psychedelic" [...] and as an anthem to Marijuana, rather than one about drunkenness.

Prefix Magazine s Andrew Winistorfer gave the video a harsh critic, he wrote that the smoke was not the only featured in the video as anyone [...] "get to see Damian Marley sell out in real time".

500|$|Lyrically, Eva Spence {{credited}} {{on how the}} Astraea was a {{lot more}} positive than their previous material due to having time off between tours and being able to relax in the writing process. [...] "I feel happier than I {{have done in the past}} few years. I'm seeing things in a positive light and I hope the lyrics will be more uplifting" [...] In an interview with James Spence about the early writing process and how the lyrics have an essence of self-reflection as a common theme in the band's work, [...] "it's not something people normally look at or focus on; self-reflection as a theme, but if you ignore what's happening to you and how it's making <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> things then I don't think that's good." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2004, One by One won the Grammy Award for Best Rock Album, {{while one}} year earlier at the 45th Grammy Awards [...] "All My Life" [...] {{was chosen as}} Best Hard Rock Performance.

Grohl stated that he was frustrated at himself for rushing on the album: [...] "four of the songs were good, and the other seven I've never played again in my life." [...] Hawkins said that [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> things too much, they kinda get sterile, as we found out there", and Shiflett declared that [...] "there are great songs , and then there are... parts of great songs".|$|E

5000|$|In {{his first}} full season {{following}} the trade, Neely's 36 goals led the club, and his 72 points more than doubled his previous year's performance. In the same season, he also spent 143 minutes in the penalty box [...] "Mike Milbury said, 'I want <b>you</b> to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> what you're doing by putting yourself into the penalty box. If you're going to fight, make sure it's on your terms {{and not just because}} someone is challenging you.' He was trying to make me understand who I was going in the box with. He'd say, 'I don't want to take away from you dropping your gloves, but, I don't want <b>you</b> to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> not doing it. I just want <b>you</b> to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> how your reaction affects both their team and our team.' So it got me to thinking a little more about my role. Then, I began going with my instincts more and what felt right at that moment." ...|$|R
