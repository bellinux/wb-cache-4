40|$|Bumping {{is one of}} the nat ural hazards {{that occur}} in Polish collieries. It is a common {{phenomenon}} but difficult to predict and very often it causes huge losses in mining equipment and roadway structure. Death of miners working underground is most severe result of bumping. To re duce or even to eliminate results of bumping, especially fatal cases, many safety measures have been used. Frame of <b>arch</b> <b>support</b> {{is one of the}} measures applied to reduce dangerous results of bumping. Simulation test of impact load of <b>arch</b> <b>yielding</b> <b>support</b> was presented in the paper. The simulation of support load was realized in two stages. Static load of frame of <b>yielding</b> <b>arch</b> <b>support</b> was simulated at the first stage. Among others simulation of assembly of <b>arch</b> <b>support</b> c omponents was carried out. Non-line ar simulation, including contact phenomena, was conducted for that purpose. First st age of t he task was realized in MSC.

40|$|Yielding <b>arch</b> <b>support</b> {{being used}} in German mining almost exclusively, more and more comes up against {{limiting}} factors. The consequence is lacking strata control, and hence {{a high rate of}} accident risk due to late bearing characteristics and, for that reason loosened surrounding rock. In addition to that setting the heavy support components means high physical stress to the heading worker. This work cannot be mechanized. A new support concept, canopy compound support, has been tested in scale models to optimize both its rock mechanical effect and ergonomy. To achieve these two aims, coordination of the support setting activities with the roadheading-system as a whole is crucial besides optimal handling capacity of the single components. The canopy compound support has been tested on a special test rig in scale 1 : 3. Already available experimental data concerning <b>yielding</b> <b>arch</b> <b>support</b> and roof-bolting, facilitated a direct comparison and hence a purposeful optimization of special support characteristics, e. g. yieldability after breaking of the surrounding rock. The experiments in scale 1 : 3 were prepared on a test rig in scale 1 : 20, which allowed for a great number of variants being tested, as well as load-control being optimized in advance. In addition to that, single components have been tested on their own: experiments have been carried out with scale models of the polygonsegments as well as with numerical models using FEM: several variants of arch legs have been tested. As a conclusion of the investigations to hand, which include an ergonomical study, as well, it can be said, that the canopy compound system is a promising support combining the advantages of both <b>yielding</b> <b>arch</b> <b>support</b> and roof-bolting. This should now be proved underground. (orig.)

40|$|The {{design of}} {{reinforced}} concrete structures which {{are subjected to}} static and intensive dynamic loading requires {{taking into account the}} occurrence of thrust reaction resulting in significant increase in strength and crack resistance.

The influence of thrust on the strength, deformation property and crack resistance of reinforced concrete structures under static and short-term dynamic loading was investigated.

40|$|Dynamic impacts {{that became}} {{frequent}} lately cause large human and economic losses, and their prevention methods {{are not always}} effective and reasonable. The given research aims at studying the way of enhancing explosion safety of building structures by means of <b>yielding</b> <b>supports.</b> The paper presents results of numerical studies of strength and deformation property of <b>yielding</b> <b>supports</b> {{in the shape of}} annular tubes under static and short-term dynamic loading. The degree of influence of <b>yielding</b> <b>supports</b> was assessed taking into account three peculiar stages of deformation: elastic; elasto-plastic; and elasto-plastic with hardening. The methodology for numerical studies performance was described using finite element analysis with program software Ansys Mechanical v 17. 2. It was established that rigidity of <b>yielding</b> <b>supports</b> influences significantly their stress-strain state. The research determined that with the increase in deformable elements rigidity dependence between load and deformation of the support in elastic and plastic stages have linear character. Significant reduction of the dynamic response and increase in deformation time of <b>yielding</b> <b>supports</b> were observed due to increasing the plastic component. Therefore, it allows assuming on possibility of their application as supporting units in RC beams...|$|R

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} {{known as}} the ‘arching effect’ occurs when a portion of granular mass yields relative to an adjacent stationary region. The movement is resisted by shearing stresses which act to reduce {{the pressure on the}} <b>yielding</b> <b>support</b> and increase the pressure on the adjacent stationary <b>supporting</b> zones. <b>Arching</b> is widely observed in both natural and man-made structures such as piled embankments, tunnelling, and above mine works and sinkholes. In this research the arching effect is recreated in the increased gravity environment of a geotechnical centrifuge where the pressure distribution across both the <b>yielding</b> and <b>supporting</b> soil masses is measured and the resulting soil displacements observed. A motor driven ‘trapdoor’ apparatus was built inside a plane strain container to model the <b>yielding</b> <b>support.</b> Both the trapdoor and an adjacent support were instrumented to measure the force (and derived pressure) distribution. Soil and trapdoor displacements are determined by analysis of digital images taken in-flight through a Perspex wall of the container. One method of increasing soil shear strength and its resistance to deformation is the reinforcement of soil with randomly distributed discrete fibres. The degree of improvement {{has been shown to be}} directly related to the fibre content in the soil, the fibre aspect ratio, orientation and mechanical properties. In this research the effect of fibre reinforcement on the arching process and resulting deformation is examined by variation of fibre parameters such as fibre aspect ratio and volumetric content of fibre. The influence of fibre and model scale effects were investigated by conducting a modelling of models exercise whereby trapdoor scale and effective stress were varied whilst maintaining a constant cover depth to structure width ratio, and compaction effort. The results were compared directly with those obtained for unreinforced soil trapdoor tests in order to determine the extent of improvement offered by fibre-reinforcement...|$|R

30|$|There {{are many}} soft-rock roadway coal mines in China. The {{surrounding}} rocks of the high-stress soft-rock roadways in deep mine are especially {{difficult to be}} supported using the traditional supporting way. In this study, the south wing rail roadway on the second level of Yunjialing coal mine in China {{was used as an}} example to analyze the deformation and failure characteristics and influencing factors of roadway. On this basis, this study proposed the equalized <b>yielding</b> <b>support</b> idea which employs the yielding rings to realize the pressure equalization on the bolts and cables in the section. To achieve this purpose, the first bolt-mesh-cable equalizing pressure <b>yielding</b> <b>support</b> was integrated with the second grouting reinforcement. The results proved that the yield rings of the bolts and cables on the spandrel of the arched roadway firstly developed yielding deformation; then the deformation extended to the vault of the roadway; the bolts and cables achieved a yielding extreme value of 15 and 18  tonnes, respectively. The roadway surrounding rock tended to be stable at the 26 th day after the maintenance. The equalizing pressure <b>yielding</b> <b>supporting</b> technology plays a moderate pressure-releasing and actively controlling role on the surrounding rocks in the soft-rock roadway with large deformation.|$|R

This particular support scheme has been adopted in order to simulate the different boundary conditions that r. c. slabs subjected to impacts may encounter in practical applications of civil engineering (e. g. roofs, vertical panels, retaining walls, guardrails, etc.). The experimental results showed that influence of support deformability on the structural response under impact depends on their rigidity and on the deformation stage. The results of numerical simulations based on a simple mechanical model qualitatively agree with the experimental results. Therefore the model can be adopted for simulation and design of reinforced concrete panels under impact or high-strain loading situation...|$|R
