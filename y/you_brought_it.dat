6000|$|... "And <b>you</b> <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> all on {{yourself}}," [...] ses Charlie. [...] "You’ve {{only got}} yourself {{to thank for}} it. I ’ad thought o’ picking a bone with you over those letters you wrote." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{think that}} I am, really," [...] he said. [...] "I am moody, though, and that's almost as bad. The sight of <b>you</b> <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> all back. And that fellow Dane--I've been frightened of him, Beatrice." ...|$|E
6000|$|As {{they entered}} the big house Elsie said: [...] "You're to come {{right up to the}} studio. I {{want to show you a}} canvas I {{finished}} yesterday. I had an inspiration--I think <b>you</b> <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you. <b>It</b> was <b>you</b> who <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> to me; {{but that}} wasn't all you did. I came here dejected, and now I'm cheerful again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But what?" [...] he interrupted, savagely. [...] "Why have <b>you</b> not <b>brought</b> <b>it,</b> as I bade {{you in my}} note? Why is it not here? We want it at once!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Brand is {{acquainted with}} it, and I prefer him to remain. My son has {{informed}} me that you hold a note of his. No doubt, <b>you</b> have <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> with you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm sorry," [...] said Janet complacently, [...] "but <b>you</b> <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> on yourself. I'm not brutal, but I won't be balked. Please remember, my girl, {{that to me}} {{this is a very}} {{important}} enterprise and I've no intention of allowing you to defeat my plans." ...|$|E
6000|$|She debated, jerking {{the book}} {{into the nearest}} empty chair, where Mr. Cashmore quickly pounced on it. [...] "Wasn't it for that <b>you</b> <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> me?" [...] she demanded. Yet before he could answer she again {{challenged}} her child. [...] "Have you read this work, Nanda?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What, in {{the name}} of wonder, can you be {{scouring}} your rifle for to-night?" [...] continued young Thorpe. [...] "You have never yet touched it since <b>you</b> <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> into the house. What can you possibly want with it now? We don't shoot birds in England with rifle bullets." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, my God!" [...] moaned Stella, {{wringing}} her hands; [...] "I {{never knew}} it till this moment. <b>You</b> have <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> home to me; you, yes, you!" [...] and she burst out weeping.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{had made}} up my mind to kill you, young sir," [...] he said, [...] "sooner or later; but <b>you</b> have <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> on {{yourself}} now. Draw, sir!" [...] And the duke drew his sword.|$|R
6000|$|... 'The young man's whom <b>you</b> <b>brought</b> here. But <b>it's</b> no matter,' the {{old woman}} added; 'the butler will have entered it--from his card.' ...|$|R
6000|$|She was {{the lonely}} girl, the brown {{appealing}} Myra Thompson, {{whom he had}} married, and he almost wept for pity as he kissed her and besought, [...] "Oh, honey, honey, CARE to have it? Of course I do! I'm awful proud <b>you</b> <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> to me. And I needed a new case badly." ...|$|E
6000|$|Miss Ramsey: [...] "Now you are {{insulting}} me! And that is {{just the}} point. You may be a very clever lawyer, Mr. Ashley, and everybody says you are--very able, and talented, and all that, but you can't get round that point. You may torture any meaning you please out of my words, but I shall always say <b>you</b> <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> on yourself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You can go when it pleases you, Clavering," [...] he said. [...] "I {{am sorry}} you have {{received}} some trifling injury, but I {{have an idea}} that <b>you</b> <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> upon yourself. In the face of your conduct to them {{it seems to me}} that my friends were warranted in detaining you until they made sure of the correctness of your story." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} the romance wears thin, {{leaving only a}} monotonous, not to say sordid, reality, while details of cubic {{quantities}} would hardly interest you. Still, and remember <b>you</b> have <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> upon yourself, I will do my best." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pray, don't let {{my little}} remark {{distress}} you," [...] he said. [...] "I had almost forgotten the circumstance until something <b>you</b> said <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> into my mind. It is you yourself, you must remember, {{who set the}} example of candor." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope so! You're not a quitter, and we'll hold {{on while}} we can, but I think we'll talk about {{something}} else. Well, I've examined the specimen of ore <b>you</b> <b>brought</b> back. <b>It</b> looks like high-grade stuff and certainly carries enough metal to pay for smelting." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Fountain: [...] "My good resolutions? Really, Clarence, {{sometimes}} {{if it were}} not cruelty to animals I should like to hit you. My good-- You know that you suggested that plan, and it wasn't even original with you. The papers have been talking about it for years; but when <b>you</b> <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> up as such a new idea, I fell in with it to please you--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{that must}} be mere gossip and spite at not having the custom. It quite {{accounts}} for what she may say, and indeed <b>you</b> <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> all on yourself by not having asked me for a note. You must restrain yourself. What you may say to me is of no importance, but you must not go and attack those {{who are doing the}} very best for your niece." ...|$|E
6000|$|The man hesitated in his answer, and the Provost continued, [...] "You evidently {{did do it}} on purpose, and in that case, {{although}} it was carried too far, for I hear you had a very narrow escape of being stifled, still <b>you</b> <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> upon yourself, and I {{hope it will be}} a lesson to you not to risk the lives of Eton boys for your amusement. I know nothing about this affair, but if you can point out the boys you suspect I will of course inquire into it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not in comparison, certainly. If that is uncivil, <b>you</b> have <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> on yourself. But I do not {{in truth}} mean {{anything}} derogatory to the painters of the day. When their pictures are old, they,--that {{is the good}} ones among them,--will be nice also." ...|$|R
6000|$|In himself too, after all, {{she could}} still press the spring of {{careless}} mirth. “I’m not afraid, if <b>you</b> haven’t yet <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> off.” ...|$|R
60|$|A rabbit's foot {{may bring}} {{good luck to}} <b>you,</b> but <b>it</b> <b>brought</b> none to the rabbit.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not answer}} that, Cecil; you will think better {{of those words}} another time," [...] said Raymond, sternly. [...] "But when you want your cause taken up, you have to {{remember}} that whatever the annoyance, <b>you</b> <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> upon yourself and her, by your own extraordinary proceeding towards my mother--I will not say towards myself. I will try to smooth matters. I think the De Lanceys must have acted foolishly; but the first step ought to be an expression of regret for such conduct towards my mother." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Macumazahn," [...] he said, [...] "I {{know you}} have your pistol on you, for only the other day <b>you</b> <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> into my presence, and through light and {{darkness}} you nurse it as a mother does her firstborn. Now since the Opener of Roads desires it, I command you to fire at that which seems to stand above us. If it be a mortal woman, she is a cheat and deserves to die. If it be a spirit from heaven it can take no harm. Nor can you take harm who only do that which you must." ...|$|E
60|$|Now, what I {{wanted to}} do, {{was to go}} to the coral-reef and dive down and get {{something}} for myself. It would be worth while to take home a sea-fan or something of that kind, and say <b>you</b> <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> up {{from the bottom of the}} sea yourself. Any one could get things that the divers had brought up. To be sure, the sea wasn't very deep here, but it had a bottom, all the same. I was not so good a swimmer as these darkeys, who ducked and dived as if they had been born in the water, but I could swim better than most fellows, and was particularly good at diving. So I determined, if I could get a chance, to go down after some of those things on the coral-reef.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know, {{things seemed}} {{so long that}} evening. Till after dark at least, and it came on in the morning--no, the Monday. I believe it was your arm--for talking of going to see <b>you</b> always <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> on, till Mr. Ward gave him a dose of brandy-and-water, and that stopped it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Peace, peace!" [...] {{cried the}} Doge, while those present who {{understood}} English translated Dick's wild words to their neighbours, and Cattrina laughed mockingly at {{the success of}} his sneer. [...] "Have I not said that such words are unseemly? Ah! I thought it; well, my lord, <b>you</b> have <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> on yourself." ...|$|R
2500|$|When {{the hunter}} {{arrived at the}} village, he gave the drum to the chief, who said, [...] "We have heard the voice of this thing for a long time, but no-one had seen it until now. <b>You</b> have <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> to us; <b>you</b> have done well. Take my first {{daughter}} for your first wife." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Apparently <b>you</b> <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> upon yourself," [...] Flavia said. [...] "None but {{ourselves}} {{know what}} has happened; therefore, neither shame nor disgrace can arise from it. My advice to you is, go home now and remain there until those marks of the stick have died out; it will be {{easy for you to}} assign an excuse. If you follow the matter up, I will proclaim among my friends how I found you here grovelling on the ground while you were beaten. What will then be said of your manliness? Already the repeated excuses which have served you from abstaining to join the armies in the field have been a matter for much comment. You best know whether it would improve your position were it known that you had been beaten by a slave. Why, you would be a jest among young Romans." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing {{but your}} sword and quarter-staff. I see {{that many of}} the beggars and others that one meets in the streets carry long staffs, and yours is not much longer than the generality. <b>You</b> <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> tied up with your bow, so you would do well to carry it, for in a street broil, where there is room to swing it, you could desire no better weapon, in such strong hands as yours, Tom. Besides, you can knock down and disable with it and no great harm is done, whereas if you used your sword there would be dead men; and {{although}} by all I hear these are not uncommon objects in the streets of Paris, there might be trouble if the town watch came up, as we are strangers. I shall carry a stout cudgel myself, as well as my sword." ...|$|E
60|$|IN the North {{one hears}} the war mentioned, in social conversation, once a month; {{sometimes}} {{as often as}} once a week; but as a distinct subject for talk, it has long ago been relieved of duty. There are sufficient reasons for this. Given a dinner company of six gentlemen to-day, it can easily happen that four of them--and possibly five--were not in the field at all. So the chances are four to two, or five to one, that the war will at no time during the evening become the topic of conversation; and the chances are still greater that if it become the topic it will remain so but a little while. If you add six ladies to the company, you have added six people who saw so little of the dread realities of the war that {{they ran out of}} talk concerning them years ago, and now would soon weary of the war topic if <b>you</b> <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> up.|$|E
6000|$|... 'You have disregarded all my quiet {{interference}} in the miserable lad's behalf,' said Nicholas; 'you have returned no answer to the letter in which I begged forgiveness for him, and offered to be responsible that he would remain quietly here. Don't blame me for this public interference. <b>You</b> have <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> upon yourself; not I.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your cousin, Miss Virginia, {{has been}} to our office," [...] he answered. [...] "She thought, naturally, that <b>you</b> had <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> {{straight}} to us. I don't know whether she seriously expected that we would give it up again, but {{that seemed to be}} the object of her visit. At any rate, we learnt that you had succeeded." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is {{very kind}} of you, my good girl," [...] B. said, [...] "but really I don't think we can. I don't think we ought to. You must not go on doing this sort of thing. We will drink this one now that <b>you</b> have <b>brought</b> <b>it,</b> but we really must insist on its being the last." ...|$|R
