5|$|The baroque {{fountain}} {{consists of}} a large circular basin with three smaller seashell-like basins above it, supported on a pedestal containing sculpted dolphins. It is scheduled as a Grade 1 monument, but it is currently in a dilapidated state. The fountain is currently being restored, after <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>neglect.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although it {{has survived}} years of wear and warfare, {{one of the}} palace's wings is now in danger of {{collapsing}} into the Black Sea below. Cracks have begun {{to appear in the}} library, housing almost 10,000 books and manuscripts. Although Edward Blore had a state-of-the-art drainage system built into the palace's foundation, <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>neglect</b> and the construction of a nearby sewage pipe in 1974 have helped to increase the potential for a landslide. Another potential looming disaster is surrounding the medieval-style gatehouse near the palace's west side.|$|E

5|$|Bizet's {{marriage}} to Geneviève Halévy was intermittently happy and produced one son. After his death, his work, apart from Carmen, was generally neglected. Manuscripts were given away or lost, and published versions {{of his works}} were frequently revised and adapted by other hands. He founded no school and had no obvious disciples or successors. After <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>neglect,</b> his works began to be performed more frequently in the 20th century. Later commentators have acclaimed him as a composer of brilliance and originality whose premature death was a significant loss to French musical theatre.|$|E
5|$|The funding {{produced}} by the Battleship Texas Commission was {{not up to the}} task of maintaining the ship. Consequently, <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>neglect</b> resulted in cracks and gaps in coated surfaces, water intrusion, and steel deterioration. Paint in interior spaces began to crack, then flake, exposing metal surfaces underneath, which began to rust. At the same time, pipes open to the sea ultimately failed, flooding various voids and bunkers.|$|E
5|$|Another problem {{exposed by}} Rolling Thunder was the unpreparedness of the Air Force for the {{operations}} it was undertaking. Its aircraft {{had been designed}} and its pilots trained for strategic operations against the Soviet Union – for nuclear, not conventional war. The new campaign exposed <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>neglect</b> in conventional tactics, while aircraft capabilities and armament were ill-suited to the task at hand. The Air Force was also embarrassed {{by the fact that}} the Navy was better prepared. It possessed the only all-weather bomber in the U.S. inventory in the new A-6 Intruder and was also responsible for the development of the F-4 Phantom fighter-bomber, which became ubiquitous during the Vietnam War.|$|E

Pinen was torn down 2011 after 15 <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>neglected</b> repair.|$|R
5000|$|After Morocco gained {{independence}} {{with the}} end of the French Protectorate in 1956, it started a process of Arabization, with the aim of transforming the nation into a monolingual one, with political and economic independence and an Arab-Islamic identity. In the year 2000, after <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>neglecting</b> and ignoring the other languages present in Morocco, the Charter for Educational Reform recognized them and the necessity for them.|$|R

5|$|By 1978, {{the number}} of Amin's {{supporters}} and close associates had shrunk significantly, and he faced increasing dissent from the populace within Uganda as the economy and infrastructure collapsed {{as a result of}} the <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>neglect</b> and abuse. After the killings of Bishop Luwum and ministers Oryema and Oboth Ofumbi in 1977, several of Amin's ministers defected or fled into exile. In November 1978, after Amin's vice president, General Mustafa Adrisi, was injured in a car crash, troops loyal to him mutinied. Amin sent troops against the mutineers, some of whom had fled across the Tanzanian border. Amin accused Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere of waging war against Uganda, ordered the invasion of Tanzanian territory, and formally annexed a section of the Kagera Region across the boundary.|$|E
5|$|Rook Lane Chapel was a noncomformist chapel built between 1705 and 1707 by James Pope. The chapel had {{a gallery}} around three sides and {{the centre of}} the ceiling was domed and {{supported}} by two Tuscan columns. Rook Lane ceased {{to be used as a}} chapel in 1968 and there followed twenty-five <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>neglect.</b> In the early 1990s the building was compulsorily purchased by Somerset County Council and transferred to the Somerset Buildings Preservation Trust, which carried out repairs and restorations. In 2001 it was converted by a firm of architects, the ground floor becoming a community hall and arts centre managed by Rook Lane Arts Trust and the galleried upper floor becoming offices for the architectural firm NVB Architects.|$|E
5|$|The castle saw service {{during the}} English Civil War of 1642 to 1646, during which its {{vulnerability}} to {{attack from the}} land became apparent, resulting in the Gallants Bower defensive work above it being used to provide additional protection. In 1748, a new gun position called the Grand Battery {{was added to the}} castle, equipped with twelve guns. After <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>neglect</b> in the early 19th century, the castle was upgraded in 1859 with modern artillery, but defending the port of Dartmouth was no longer a military priority. By {{the early years of the}} 20th century the castle was considered redundant by the authorities, who opened it to visitors. It was brought back into use during the First and Second World Wars, but in 1955 it was finally retired from service. In the 21st century, it is managed by English Heritage and the castle received 37,940 visitors in 2007.|$|E

50|$|The second {{change was}} a {{complete}} transformation of the tramway, by means of both long-overdue repairs to the track and {{the purchase of a}} new engine. <b>Years</b> <b>of</b> <b>neglected</b> maintenance had left the railway line in a deteriorated condition. In 1957 the Railways Department gave Council an ultimatum that unless the track was substantially upgraded, it would no longer permit government-owned rolling stock to be used on the Aramac run. The increased prosperity of the district enabled Council both to increase freight charges and levy ratepayers, raising £30,000 which was spent on the first major repairs to the line in many <b>years,</b> including rebuilding <b>of</b> the bridges.|$|R
5|$|The <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>neglect</b> {{following}} {{the closing of}} the hotel took a toll on the building's appearance with both the interior and exterior facade crumbling. In 2005, it was announced that the hotel would undergo a $112million renovation and acquisition with a planned opening in 2007 in a deal between Marriott International/Renaissance Hotels and Sage Hospitality, a Denver, Colorado-based company. The hotel's restoration process was quite lengthy because of the extensive interior damage. $22million of the expected $112million was the cost associated with the acquisition. Sage sought $22million in tax increment financing from the Chicago Community Development Commission. They eventually were approved for $18million in tax-increment financing. The final cost of the restoration came to $128million, of which the city of Chicago provided $13.5million for street-front improvement, including the restoration and recasting of over 10,000 pieces of decorative terra cotta, and federal historical tax credits because the building is a historical landmark. The Chicago Landmark status necessitated renovation oversight by the Commission on Chicago Landmarks.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, after {{a hundred}} <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>neglect,</b> {{a part of}} the Mare aux Songes swamp was {{excavated}} by an international team of researchers (International Dodo Research Project). To prevent malaria, the British had covered the swamp with hard core during their rule over Mauritius, which had to be removed. Many remains were found, including bones of at least 17 dodos in various stages of maturity (though no juveniles), and several bones obviously from the skeleton of one individual bird, which have been preserved in their natural position. These findings were made public in December 2005 in the Naturalis museum in Leiden. 63% of the fossils found in the swamp belonged to turtles of the extinct Cylindraspis genus, and 7.1% belonged to dodos, which had been deposited within several centuries, 4,000 years ago. Subsequent excavations suggested that dodos and other animals became mired in the Mare aux Songes while trying to reach water during a long period of severe drought about 4,200 years ago. Furthermore, cyanobacteria thrived in the conditions created by the excrements of animals gathered around the swamp, which died of intoxication, dehydration, trampling, and miring. Though many small skeletal elements were found during the recent excavations of the swamp, few were found during the 19th century, probably owing to the employment of less refined methods when collecting.|$|E

25|$|It {{was never}} a {{commercial}} success and, from 1950, lack of maintenance allowed the canal to become increasingly derelict. After many <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>neglect,</b> restoration commenced in 1977 and on 10 May 1991 the canal was reopened as a fully navigable waterway from the River Wey to almost {{as far as the}} Greywell Tunnel.

40|$|We {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that the government bond markets in the Eurozone are more fragile and more susceptible to self-fulfilling liquidity crises than in stand-alone countries. We find evidence that {{a significant part of the}} surge in the spreads of the peripheral Eurozone countries during 2010 – 11 was disconnected from underlying increases in the debt to GDP ratios and fiscal space variables, and was associated with negative self-fulfilling market sentiments that became very strong since the end of 2010. We argue that this can drive member countries of the Eurozone into bad equilibria. We also find evidence that after <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>neglecting</b> high government debt, investors became increasingly worried about this in the Eurozone, and reacted by raising the spreads. No such worries developed in stand-alone countries despite the fact that debt to GDP ratios and fiscal space variables were equally high and increasing in these countries. status: publishe...|$|R

We interpreted this evidence as validating the hypothesis formulated in De Grauwe(2011) according to which government bond markets in a monetary union are more fragile and more susceptible to self-fulfilling liquidity crises than in stand-alone countries. We argue that the systematic mispricing of sovereign risk in the Eurozone intensifies macroeconomic instability, leading to bubbles in good years and excessive austerity in bad years...|$|R
