500|$|Santaolalla {{began work}} on The Last of Us early in its development. Druckmann did not give him {{specific}} directions but offered him the game's stories and themes. Santaolalla appreciated this freedom and felt it assisted his process. He {{felt the need to}} [...] "go into some more dark place, more textural and not necessarily melodic", when composing. The composer prefers to compose as he records, as he has little knowledge of reading and writing sheet music. To challenge himself, Santaolalla used a variety of unique instruments that were new to him, giving [...] "an element of danger and innocence". For some tracks, he used a detuned guitar, producing deep noise. To produce unique sounds, Santaolalla recorded in various rooms, including a bathroom and kitchen. The title track was composed on a variety of charango called a ronroco. The team wanted the game's AI to affect the music. They also tried to make the music evoke a reaction from the player, as their familiarization with the sounds would trigger a previous emotion that they felt. Music manager Jonathan Mayer felt that the game's action music was atypical for video game action music, stating that it is [...] "relatively low-key", and that taking it out of context changes the immediate reaction to it. The game's theme, [...] "The Last of Us", was the first piece of music that the team received, and they were very impressed. With the music, the team aimed to [...] "get emotion", as opposed to [...] "horror". Inspired by the sparing use of music in the film No Country for Old Men (2007), the team used music judiciously and tried to find other ways to [...] "make <b>your</b> <b>palms</b> sweaty". The orchestral portions of the score were recorded at Ocean Way Studios in Nashville by the Nashville Scoring Orchestra.|$|E

25|$|The power grip is {{when the}} fingers (and {{sometimes}} palm) clamp down on an object with the thumb making counter pressure. Examples of the power grip are gripping a hammer, opening a jar using both <b>your</b> <b>palm</b> and fingers, and during pullups.|$|R
50|$|There {{are various}} grips for {{executing}} the forehand and their popularity has fluctuated over the years. The most important ones are the Continental, the Eastern, and the Western. The key differences between grips are the different angles they create between {{the angle of}} <b>your</b> <b>palm</b> and the angle of your racquet face. You are used to sensing the direction <b>your</b> <b>palm</b> is facing, so <b>your</b> <b>palm</b> makes the most intuitive basis for sensing the direction your racquet is facing. For {{a number of years}} the small, apparently frail 1920s player Bill Johnston was considered by many to have had the best forehand of all time, a stroke that he hit shoulder-high using a western grip. Few top players used the western grip after the 1920s, but {{in the latter part of}} the 20th century, as shot-making techniques and equipment changed radically, the western forehand made a strong comeback and is now used by many modern players. No matter which grip is used, most forehands are generally executed with one hand holding the racquet, but there have been fine players with two-handed forehands. In the 1940s and 50s the Ecuadorian/American player Pancho Segura used a two-handed forehand to devastating effect against larger, more powerful players, and many female and young players use the two-handed stroke today.|$|R

50|$|To simplify Lazarus's {{theory and}} {{emphasize}} his stress on cognition, {{as you are}} experiencing an event, your thought must precede the arousal and emotion (which happen simultaneously).

Your mouth goes dry, your heart beat quickens, <b>your</b> <b>palms</b> sweat, and your legs begin to shake {{and at the same time}} you experience fear.|$|E
5000|$|Bamboo Dragonfly - The {{traditional}} Chinese {{version of}} the illuminating flying toy was made of bamboo. This version contained two blades that functioned as the propeller. They were connected to a thin rod. When you would rub the rod with <b>your</b> <b>palms,</b> it would rotate and release the bamboo dragonfly. Because there is no electricity involved, the bamboo dragonfly did not fly to great heights. A helicopter-sized version features in the novel.|$|E
50|$|Antonio Damasio {{suggests}} that somatic markers, certain memories {{that can cause}} a strong bodily reaction, act {{as a way to}} guide decision making as well. For example, when you are remembering a scary movie and once again become tense and <b>your</b> <b>palms</b> might begin to sweat. Damasio argues that when making a decision we rely on our “gut feelings” to assess various options, and this makes decide to go with a decision that is more positive and stay away from those that are negative. He also argues that the orbitofrontal cortex - located {{at the base of the}} frontal lobe, just above the eyes - is crucial in your use of somatic markers, because it is the part in the brain that allows you to interpret emotion.|$|E
50|$|There {{is no need}} {{to think}} of {{delivering}} the strike with a 'blade edge'.

That helps enormously in keeping the arm straight throughout.|$|R

50|$|To {{produce a}} {{miniature}} gourmet look-alike, first choose the pre-dyed clay in the desired colour. Use <b>your</b> <b>palms</b> {{to soften the}} clay and roll the clay to the desired shape. Cook the clay in the oven, let the clay cool down in the oven until it is cool enough to be handled again. After it is cooled, take the razor blade and shave off a tiny pile of white powder from chalk. Spray or paint a layer of Varathane sealer. While the sealer is still wet, pick {{up some of the}} white chalk powder with your finger tip and dab it sparingly onto a few areas of the clay. The general shape of the model is thereby finished. Lastly, one may utilize different paints and colouring tools to finish the process.|$|E
50|$|An example {{portion of}} a review, from Littlehampton Gazette, includes: Shadow Blade plays like a new ninja {{graduate}} slashing and spinning out of the blocks, intent on redefining your impression {{of the very best}} action platformers gone before. Drawing on the yingsic and disposing of the yang from similar games gone by, it slices through any new year gaming apathy you may still be harbouring to deliver a visceral, if depressingly brief, digital distraction. It controls like a dream, offers obvious style and panache through its martial arts execution, and is all underpinned by glorious level design that keeps the blood pumping through <b>your</b> <b>palms</b> as you try to dispatch every enemy on screen and reach your goal. There’s drama, great design and drool-worthy danger {{at the end of every}} digit swipe - just cut to the chase and download this razor-sharp slice ‘em up.|$|E
5000|$|By {{taking into}} account {{heightened}} emotion, reaction to the stooge, as well as prompted questions, all these elicited factors provide a negative or positive affect. Although the study took place in 1962, it is still studied in both psychology and communication fields today {{as an example of}} appraisal theory in relation to affect and emotion.Through these findings, Schachter and Singer assess that an event happens which in turn elicits as physiological arousal. From the reasoning of the arousal, you are then able to have an emotion. [...] For example: You are about to give a speech. You approach the podium and look out into the audience as your mouth goes dry, your heart beat quickens, <b>your</b> <b>palms</b> sweat, and your legs begin to shake. From this arousal, you understand you feel this way because you are about to give a speech in front of 50 of your peers. This feeling causes anxiety and you experience the emotion of fear.|$|E

50|$|Bararean cuisine {{is based}} on peas (nokhod in Persian). Bararean dishes all contain peas and they each have very {{different}} methods of eating. For example, when eating the prime dish Nochovskoo, you must place the pea on <b>your</b> <b>palm</b> as opposed to Gholenjoon Nokhod where the pea {{is placed on the}} back of your hand before getting slapped into your throat. TakhtHalghoob and Varcholang are other dishes, both based on peas.|$|R
50|$|Snapping (or clicking) one's fingers is {{the act of}} {{creating}} a snapping or clicking sound with one's fingers. Primarily this is done by building tension between the thumb and another (middle, index, or ring) finger and then moving the other finger forcefully downward so it hits the palm of the same hand at a high speed. Alternatively, one can press the middle finger and thumb together and then fling the middle finger onto <b>your</b> <b>palm.</b>|$|R
