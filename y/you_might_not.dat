500|$|A {{week before}} the final, Liverpool played Portsmouth in the 2005–06 Premier League – it was their last match before the final, and they won 3–1. The win was Liverpool's ninth {{straight}} in the competition and meant they finished the season in third place. One area of concern was the fitness of midfielder Xabi Alonso, who injured his ankle in the match and was a doubt for the final. They were also without striker Robbie Fowler, who was cup-tied after playing for Manchester City earlier in the competition. Captain Steven Gerrard {{was determined not to}} let complacency affect Liverpool; [...] "We have beaten fantastic sides like Manchester United and Chelsea to get to the final, but it is always on your mind that after going on such a successful run <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> get over that last hurdle." ...|$|E

Originally, Nolan had envisioned Inception as a horror film, but eventually wrote it as a heist film {{even though he}} found that [...] "traditionally [...] are very deliberately superficial in emotional terms." [...] Upon revisiting his script, he decided that basing it in that genre did not work because the story [...] "relies so heavily {{on the idea of}} the interior state, the idea of dream and memory. I realized I needed to raise the emotional stakes." [...] Nolan worked on the script for nine to ten years. When he first started thinking about making the film, Nolan was influenced by [...] "that era of movies where you had The Matrix (1999), you had Dark City (1998), you had The Thirteenth Floor (1999) and, to a certain extent, you had Memento (2000), too. They were based in the principles that the world around <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> be real." ...|$|E
500|$|Writers Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith, who had {{previously}} co-written and starred in The League of Gentlemen and Psychoville, took inspiration for Inside No. 9 from [...] "David and Maureen", episode 4 of the first series of Psychoville, which was in turn inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's Rope. [...] "David and Maureen" [...] took place entirely in a single room, and was filmed in only two shots. At the same time, the concept of Inside No. 9 was a [...] "reaction" [...] to Psychoville, with Shearsmith saying that [...] "we'd been so involved with labyrinthine over-arcing, {{we thought it would}} be nice to do six different stories with a complete new house of people each week. That's appealing, because as a viewer <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> like this story, but you've got a different one next week." [...] As an anthology series with horror themes, Inside No. 9 also pays homage to Tales of the Unexpected, The Twilight Zone and Alfred Hitchcock Presents.|$|E

500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film 4 out of 4 stars, calling it [...] "one {{of the best}} police movies in recent years, a virtuoso fusion of {{performances}} and often startling action", {{and went on to}} name the film the fourth best of 2012. Film critic James Berardinelli described End of Watch as [...] "satisfying and emotionally potent ... a good, gritty drama of the sort that seems increasingly rare within the thriller genre", giving the film 3.5 out of 4 stars. Olly Richards, writing for Empire, gave the film 4 out of 5 stars and summarized it as [...] "a collection of cop-movie clichés but presented with sufficient flair and strong performances that the ride is enough, even if its on rails". While New York Bilge Ebiri found the film largely unrealistic and Ayer's direction [...] "serviceable at best", he wrote that [...] "Ayer and his cast appear to have so convincingly nailed the way these characters talk and act that <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> even notice the film slipping from workaday grit into out-and-out myth." ...|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} to The Generous Mr. Lovewell {{was generally}} positive. Giving the album four-and-a-half {{out of five}} stars, Allmusic reviewer Jared Johnson stated [...] "If you only know MercyMe for their 2001 ubiquitous AC crossover hit [...] "I Can Only Imagine," [...] you've missed out {{on some of the}} Christian genre's most accessible and well-known hits – which means <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> fully appreciate the full artistic statement that the band makes on The Generous Mr. Lovewell, a daring reinvention that drove the band far outside its comfort zone and sparked a national social trend in the process," [...] also noting that [...] "the band's collaboration with Brown Bannister and Dan Muckala delivers the messages with authenticity and contemporary new sounds that make it perfectly believable to envision a world in which Lovewell's considerate and genuine actions are manifest in the lives of real everyday people". Kevin Davis of Christian Music Review, giving the album an A+, opined that the album reminds him [...] "of a classic theme album like Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band by The Beatles or Songs For Jane [...] by Maroon 5, both in musical diversity and with the challenging lyrics" [...] and [...] "truly establishes MercyMe as the premier artist in all of Christian music".|$|E
500|$|Gregg Shapiro of the Bay Area Reporter {{gave the}} album a mostly {{negative}} review, calling it [...] "hazardous waste". He {{also noted that}} Spears's voice was [...] "reedy, cold and mechanical" [...] when stripped from the original mixes. However, he highlighted two tracks, saying: [...] "Spears comes closest to achieving dance-diva status on the Valentin remix of [...] "Everytime", while the Davidson Ospina 2005 remix of [...] "Baby One More Time" [...] elevates the original bubblegum track to club classic." [...] Mike Daniel of The Dallas Morning News called the Justice remix of [...] "Me Against the Music" [...] the best track of the album, but said it [...] "has {{the feel of a}} hastily executed stopgap measure with almost no marketing-related thought behind it except to fulfill the once-every-two-years release cycle that's been established for Britney material." [...] Entertainment Weekly writer Leah Greenblatt noted the remixes [...] "amps already-aggressive singles like [...] "Toxic" [...] and [...] "Me Against the Music" [...] to brain-popping levels of synth spiraling", and transforms [...] "sad-eyed slow jams like [...] "Everytime" [...] and [...] "Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know" [...] into Hi-NRG bursts.

500|$|Though Bobby is [...] "fairly content, {{at least}} on the surface, to be alone in the world", he slowly comes to be a {{surrogate}} father for Sam and Dean. On this relationship, Beaver feels that [...] "Bobby's concerned about them both, with Dean's sense of self, but there's a sort of undercurrent of worry about Sam. Sam seems to have more of the heart of darkness about him than Dean does... I just sense that there's this ongoing watchful eye that Bobby's got on Sam." [...] Although he loves each of them [...] "like a son", Bobby is willing to allow the brothers to put themselves in harm's way if it is absolutely necessary. For example, when Dean wants to detoxify Sam from his addiction to demon blood in [...] "When the Levee Breaks", Bobby instead points out that Sam giving in to his demonic abilities could help him to prevent Lucifer's return, even though the amount of blood required to kill Lilith would [...] "change [...] forever". Beaver noted, [...] "Bobby is old enough that he's fairly clear-headed about what the priorities ought to be. Bobby's position is, more or less, 'if you have a family member with a drinking problem and you want to stage an intervention, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> want to do it in New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Senators Larry Smith and Dante Fascell, {{a senior}} member of the firm, worked with the Cuban American National Foundation, Representative Claude Pepper of Florida, Neal Blair's Free the Eagle, and Howard Phillips' Conservative Caucus to repeal the Clark Amendment in 1985. From the amendment's repeal in 1985 to 1992 the U.S. {{government}} gave Savimbi $60million per year, a total of $420million. A sizable amount of the aid went to Savimbi's personal expenses. Black, Manafort filed foreign lobbying records with the U.S. Justice Department showing Savimbi's expenses during his U.S. visits. During his December 1990 visit he spent $136,424 at the Park Hyatt hotel and $2,705 in tips. He spent almost $473,000 in October 1991 during his week-long visit to Washington and Manhattan. He spent $98,022 in hotel bills, at the Park Hyatt, $26,709 in limousine rides in Washington and another $5,293 in Manhattan. Paul Manafort, a partner in the firm, charged Savimbi $19,300 in consulting and additional $1,712 in expenses. He also bought $1,143 worth of [...] "survival kits" [...] from Motorola.

Dmitri Malama gave Tatiana a French bulldog she named [...] "Ortipo" [...] in September 1914. [...] "Forgive me about the little dog," [...] Tatiana wrote to her mother on 30 September 1914. [...] "To say the truth, when he asked should I like to have it if he gave it to me, I at once said yes. You remember, I always wanted to have one, and only afterwards when we came home I thought that suddenly <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> like me having one. But I really was so pleased at the idea that I forgot about everything." [...] The dog died, but Malama gave her a replacement puppy. Tatiana took it with her to Yekaterinburg, where it died {{with the rest of the}} family. Malama paid the imperial family a visit some eighteen months after he gave Tatiana the first dog.

500|$|Pemberton and Shearsmith took {{inspiration}} for Inside No. 9 from [...] "David and Maureen", episode 4 {{of the first}} series of Psychoville, which was in turn inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's Rope. This episode took place entirely in a single room, and was filmed in only two shots. The writers were keen to explore other stories in this bottle episode or TV play format, and Inside No. 9 allowed them to do this. At the same time, the concept of Inside No. 9 was a [...] "reaction" [...] to Psychoville, with Shearsmith saying {{that the two of}} them had [...] "been so involved with labyrinthine over-arcing, we thought it would be nice to do six different stories with a complete new house of people each week. That's appealing, because as a viewer <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> like this story, but you've got a different one next week." [...] Elsewhere, Shearsmith explained that the pair returned to writing macabre stories as they [...] "always feel slightly unfulfilled if [...] write something that's purely comedic, [...] it just feels too frivolous and light". The first story that the pair wrote specifically for Inside No. 9 was about a birthday party. BBC producers felt that this story would work as the opening episode of a sitcom, but, given the script's events, Pemberton and Shearsmith were not happy to develop the idea into its own programme. The script was consequently shelved and revisited during the planning process for the second series, becoming [...] "Nana's Party", the fifth episode of the series and eleventh overall. During the filming Inside No. 9, Shearsmith professed excitement to be working on the programme, saying that [...] "eing in the middle of filming a third series of Psychoville would be utterly depressing". Pemberton and Shearsmith aimed for a simpler experience with Inside No. 9 than they had experienced with Psychoville, describing [...] "Sardines", Inside No. 9s first episode, by saying that it was [...] "just about some good actors in a wardrobe with a good story." ...|$|E
