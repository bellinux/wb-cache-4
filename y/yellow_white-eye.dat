50|$|The islands {{have been}} {{identified}} by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because they support over 1% of the world populations of fairy and roseate terns, and of sooty oystercatchers. Greater crested terns breed there irregularly, sometimes in large numbers. Other birds breeding on the islands include ospreys, white-bellied sea eagles, pied oystercatchers, Caspian terns and bridled terns. The islands support 12-15 breeding pairs of beach stone-curlews. <b>Yellow</b> <b>white-eyes</b> have been recorded.|$|R
5000|$|The Japanese white-eye is {{olive green}} on its back, from {{anterior}} to posterior, and is pale green on its underside. Its feet, legs, and bill range from black to brown. It has a green forehead and a <b>yellow</b> throat. The <b>white-eye</b> has rounded wings and a long, slender bill - {{both of which}} indicate this bird to be very acrobatic. Its wings are dark brown, but outlined in green. Like other white-eyes, this species exhibits the distinctive white eyering that gives it its name (mejiro also meaning [...] "white eye" [...] in Japanese). Adults range from 4 to 4.5 inches in length, and weigh between 9.75 and 12.75 grams.|$|R

50|$|Various upland birds {{recorded}} as prey include the 177 g Namaqua sandgrouse (Pterocles namaqua), the 350 g rock pigeon (Columba livia), the 84 g laughing dove (Streptopelia senegalensis), the 169 g Senegal coucal (Centropus senegalensis), the 49 g scaly-throated honeyguide (Indicator variegatus) and {{several species of}} hornbill, {{ranging in size from}} the 139 g northern red-billed hornbill (Tockus erythrorhynchus) to the 1235 g silvery-cheeked hornbill (Bycanistes brevis). Among passerines, the most frequently taken are likely to be corvids, which are often favored by Bubo owls from around the world due to their large size, relatively open nests and frequently easy-to-find, communal nocturnal roosts. To date the cape crow (Corvus capensis) and pied crow (Corvus albus) are the corvids reported in dietary studies but in Ethiopia thick-billed ravens (Corvus crassirostris), which at 1500 g are possible the heaviest corvid species in the world, mobbed them vigorously and seemed to consider them a primary threat. Smaller passerines are by no means ignored. White-eyes are among the more frequently taken smaller passerines, with the 10.9 g African <b>yellow</b> <b>white-eye</b> (Zosterops senegalensis) being the smallest identified avian prey species, although penduline tits (Anthoscopus ssp.) (thus far unidentified to species) are likely to be even smaller. The largest bird to be hunted to Verreaux's eagle-owl is {{complicated by the fact that}} they often take relatively small nestlings of larger species, such as ostriches (Struthio camelus) and grey crowned cranes (Balearica regulorum). The only avian prey items successfully attacked larger than other types of birds of prey (reviewed later) are likely bustards. Most predation records have reported on relatively small bustards, namely northern (Afrotis afraoides) and southern black korhaans (Afrotis afra), which average only 745 g and 690 g, respectively. Larger species of bustard thought to be threatened by Verreaux's eagle-owl are the 4790 g Denham's bustard (Neotis denhami) and the 8430 g kori bustard (Ardeotis kori), although it is not clear whether adults (especially males) are attacked in the latter species.|$|E

40|$|The density, seasonality, habitat {{utilization}} and foraging {{ecology of}} birds in mangals (mangrove forests) {{at a site}} on {{the upper reaches of}} Darwin Harbour were investigated by transect censusing and colour-banding over three years. Despite having only 10 species of plants, the site supported 17 confirmed and five probable breeding resident species of birds, and was visited by 30 more. From variable-width transect censuses, the mean density of birds on a 4 -ha plot was estimated to be 25 ha- 1, fairly consistent with densities obtained from territory mapping of colour-banded birds. Nearly 70 % of the individuals belonged to just 4 species: two mangal-dependent species, the red-headed honeyeater (Myzomela erythrocephala) and the <b>yellow</b> <b>white-eye</b> (Zosterops lutea) and two more generalised species, the large-billed gerygone (Gerygone magnirostris) and the brown honeyeater (Lichmera indistincta). Only the red-headed honeyeater showed significant seasonal variation in abundance, with highest numbers during the late dry season after breeding. This coincided with the period of greatest food (nectar) availability in the mangal, due to flowering Bruguiera exaristata. Lowest numbers of the red-headed honeyeater (and the brown honeyeater) occurred in the late wet season when nectar was scarce in the mangal but abundant in Melaleuca cajuputi fringing the mangal. Several resident species held permanent territories, while others apparently shifted landward during the wet season, possibly due to the wetter conditions created by freshwater runoff and high spring tides Many species showed strong associations with particular mangal zones. Large-billed gerygones, grey whistlers (Pachycephala simplex), shining flycatchers (Myiagra alecto) and mangrove fantails (Rhipidura phasiana) were associated with the Rhizophora zone at the wetter (more frequently inundated) end of the plot; mangrove robins (Eopsaltria pulverulenta) and mangrove gerygones (Gerygone laevigaster), were encountered most in the Ceriops zone; and green-backed gerygones (Gerygone chloronata) strongly favoured the dry landward edge. Four foraging guilds were evident among 13 of the most abundant species, the largest of which was the insectivorous foliage-foraging guild. Species in this group partitioned resources by differential selection of mangrove species, heights and foraging techniques. The tiny (6. 4 g) mangrove gerygone was the most specialized species, spending 80 % of its time on Avicennia marina. Contrary to the literature, breeding of mangal-dwelling birds peaked during the dry season. The ecology, evolution and biogeography of mangrove-endemic birds is reviewed in the light of this study and recent information from Western Australia...|$|E
