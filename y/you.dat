5|$|Anyone who {{has ever}} studied the history of American diplomacy, {{especially}} military diplomacy, knows that <b>you</b> might start in a war with certain things on your mind as a purpose of what <b>you</b> are doing, but in the end, <b>you</b> found yourself fighting for entirely different things that <b>you</b> {{had never thought of}} before... In other words, war has a momentum of its own and it carries <b>you</b> away from all thoughtful intentions when <b>you</b> get into it. Today, if we went into Iraq, like the president would like us to do, <b>you</b> know where <b>you</b> begin. <b>You</b> never know where <b>you</b> are going to end.|$|E
5|$|It {{was written}} in the L.A. sun on an {{afternoon}} with my friend David Poe. We were talking about how <b>you</b> sometimes know that <b>you</b> would be better at love if only <b>you</b> were older. But <b>you</b> can't rush old. <b>You</b> have to be young and dumb and let time do its thing before <b>you</b> get the experience <b>you</b> need to handle love right.|$|E
5|$|Look, I'm sorry you're dead OK? I do care. But to be {{perfectly}} honest with <b>you,</b> I don't care a lot. <b>You</b> had a choice, <b>you</b> took the drugs, <b>you</b> died. Are <b>you</b> seriously claiming no one warned <b>you</b> it was dangerous?... I mean, have <b>you</b> had a look at the world lately?... There's plenty of stuff going on that kills <b>you</b> and <b>you</b> don't get warned at all. So sticking your head in a crocodile <b>you</b> were told about is not calculated to get my sympathy.|$|E

5|$|When <b>you</b> were hungry, <b>you</b> {{began to}} cry, because <b>you</b> could not speak. <b>You</b> were seven months without teeth, always sucking. But after <b>you</b> got one, <b>you</b> began to gnaw a crust of bread. It {{was not long}} before another came pop. At ten months <b>you</b> had four pretty white teeth, and <b>you</b> used to bite me. Poor mamma! Still I did not cry, because I am not a child, but <b>you</b> hurt me very much. So I said to papa, it is time the little girl should eat. She is not naughty, yet she hurts me. I have given her a crust of bread, and I must look for some other milk.|$|E

25|$|<b>You</b> speak truly, O Achilli, and {{we cannot}} answer <b>you</b> a word. <b>You</b> are a Priest; <b>you</b> {{have been a}} Friar; <b>you</b> are, it is undeniable, the scandal of Catholicism, and the palmary {{argument}} of Protestants, by your extraordinary depravity. <b>You</b> have been, it is true, a profligate, an unbeliever, and a hypocrite. Not many years passed of your conventional life, and <b>you</b> were never in the choir, always in private houses, so that the laity observed <b>you.</b> <b>You</b> were deprived of your professorship, we own it; <b>you</b> were prohibited from preaching and hearing confessions; <b>you</b> were obliged to give hush-money to the father of one of your victims, as we learned from an official document of the Neapolitan Police to be 'known for habitual incontinency;' your name came before the civil tribunal at Corfu for your crime of adultery. <b>You</b> have put the crown on your offences, by as long as <b>you</b> could, denying them all; <b>you</b> have professed to seek after truth, when <b>you</b> were ravening after sin.|$|E
