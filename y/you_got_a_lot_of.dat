5000|$|Birmingham's {{importance}} in worldwide Bhangra {{is partly a}} result of its widespread connections to other areas of South Asian culture, both on the Indian subcontinent and throughout the Indian Diaspora, and partly the result of its concentration of musical infrastructure, with an extensive web of record companies, distributors, recording artists, DJs and marketing activity. Suky Sohal from the band Achanak has also highlighted the importance of Birmingham's tradition of interaction between eclectic musical cultures: [...] "It's such a thriving place for music, it's very sort of inspirational in that sense to produce music with the mixture of different cultures in the city. I mean I was brought up in a white school, I work in a black area, and I play for a bhangra band so I've seen a lot of different cultures, and that does help the music a lot.

5000|$|On {{her first}} racecourse appearance, Lyric of Light was ridden by Mickael Barzalona {{when she was}} one of eleven fillies to contest a maiden race over seven furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse on 26 August. Starting at odds of 6/1 she tracked the leaders before taking the lead {{approaching}} the final furlong and won by three quarters of a length from Diala with the favourite Shada in third. Two weeks later the filly was moved up in class and distance for the Group Two May Hill Stakes over one mile at Doncaster Racecourse, with Frankie Dettori taking over from Barzalona. She was made the 9/1 fourth choice in the betting behind Fallen For You, Regal Realm (winner of the Prestige Stakes) and Samitar (Albany Stakes). She was held up towaards the rear of the eight-runner field before beginning to make progress three furlongs from the finish. Lyric of Light took the lead a furlong out but hung to the right in the closing stages before staying on to win by a neck from Fallen For You. The racecourse stewards held an inquiry into possible interference between the winner and the runner-up but allowed the result to stand. After the race Dettori commented [...] "She's only run the once and there was a big crowd here today. When I went for her she went right and I tried to steer her as much as I could without interfering with Buick on Fallen For <b>You.</b> She's <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of class and won with her ears pricked. Mahmood's liked her and this was a big jump from her maiden, but the signs are she's good filly".

Although DeGarmo has refrained from publicly commenting on any of this, both sides have talked with restraint about DeGarmo's opinion regarding the current band situation, and they suggest that he has remained friends with both parties. Tate said {{about his relationship with}} DeGarmo: [...] "We’re friends. We see each other probably once a month—play golf, have lunch."

Eating a balanced diet is definitely {{one of the most}} important. At a recent conference in Arusha, Tanzania, delegates have been discussing some of the world?s forgotten foods ? vegetables, nuts and fruits that are no longer widely grown. Many of these crops are extremely nutritious. Green leafy vegetables like nightshade, for example, contain high levels of iron and vitamins. Mama Ndelifose Nanyaro is a farmer who lives in Nambala village, not far from Arusha. She spoke to Lazarus Laiser about how growing indigenous African vegetables has helped to make her life better. Track 9 In	?Right now I am standing in a garden ? Out	?just from this small garden. ? Duration	 1 ? 51 ? Suggested closing announcement: The youthful Ndelifose Nanyaro, a strong advocate for the benefits of eating and growing indigenous vegetables. Transcript Laiser	Right now I am standing in a garden which is situated in Usa, it is Nambala village, and with me is the farmer who is just practising these kind of indigenous vegetables. I can see that there is pigeonpea, I can also see the eggplant and also I can see okra and other things. I just want to know why you chose to grow these indigenous vegetables? Nanyaro	(Vernac) I decided to start this farming because it has <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of benefits. It is easy and I inherited it from my parents. We have been eating these from childhood. I am familiar with it. Laiser	Which type of indigenous fruits or indigenous vegetables do you grow? Nanyaro	(Vernac) I have okra, nightshade, eggplant, cowpeas, cassava, pumpkins, yams. Laiser	And I can see that <b>you</b> have <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of benefits, as I can see you have built a modern house. I can also see that you are healthy, so I assume that may be because of these indigenous vegetables? Nanyaro	(Vernac) I am healthy in my family, I look young as you can see me. I am 60 years but I look young and strong. My daughter is 38 years but she looks very young. I can serve my children well. I can do my own work, I am not a beggar. I pay school fees for my children by my own. In case of sickness I can just take my children to hospital without any problem, just from this small garden. End of track. Mama Ndelifose Nanyaro explains how growing and eating indigenous African vegetables, such as okra, eggplant, cowpeas and pumpkins, has made her life better. She looks and feels young and strong, despite being 60 years old, and she is proud that she can afford to pay school and hospital fees when she needs to...|$|R
6000|$|The {{first thing}} {{the young man said}} was that he was tremendously glad she had written. [...] "I think it was most {{particularly}} nice of you." [...] And this thought precisely seemed, as he spoke, a flower of the general bloom--as if the niceness he had brought in was so great that it straightway converted everything to its image. [...] "The only thing that upset me a little," [...] he went on, [...] "was your saying that before writing it you had so hesitated and waited. I hope very much, you know, that you'll never do anything of that kind again. If you've ever the slightest desire to see me--for no matter what reason, if there's ever the smallest thing of any sort that I can do for you, I promise you I shan't easily forgive you if you stand on ceremony. It seems to me that when people have known each other as long as you and I there's one comfort at least they may treat themselves to. I mean of course," [...] Van developed, [...] "that of being easy and frank and natural. There are such <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of relations in which one isn't, in which it doesn't pay, in which 'ease' in fact would be the greatest of troubles and 'nature' the greatest of falsities. However," [...] he continued while he suddenly got up to change the place in which he had put his hat, [...] "I don't really know why I'm preaching at such a rate, for I've a perfect consciousness of not myself requiring it. One does half the time preach more or less for one's self, eh? I'm not mistaken at all events, I think, about the right thing with YOU. And a hint's enough for you, I'm sure, on the right thing with me." [...] He had been looking all round while he talked and had twice shifted his seat; so that it was quite in consonance with his general admiring notice that the next impression he broke out with should have achieved some air of relevance. [...] "What extraordinarily lovely flowers you have and how charming you've made everything! You're always doing something--women are always changing the position of their furniture. If one happens to come in in the dark, no matter how well one knows the place, one sits down on a hat or a puppy-dog. But of course you'll say one doesn't come in in the dark, or at least, if one does, deserves what one gets. Only you know the way some women keep their rooms. I'm bound to say YOU don't, do you?--you don't go in for flower-pots in the windows and half a dozen blinds. Why SHOULD <b>you?</b> <b>You</b> HAVE <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> to show!" [...] He rose with this for the third time, as the better to command the scene. [...] "What I mean is that sofa--which by the way is awfully good: you do, my dear Nanda, go it! It certainly was HERE the last time, wasn't it? and this thing was there. The last time--I mean the last time I was up here--was fearfully long ago: when, by the way, WAS it?
