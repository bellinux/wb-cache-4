I lived in Leeds for a <b>year</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{used to hear}} to kids {{listening}} to instrumentals on their phones, rapping over the top. I love the way that sounds: the texture of super compressed digital beats {{coming out of a}} cellphone and just a voice over it. Far Side Virtual was inspired by hearing music like that." ...|$|E
500|$|Gallagher {{began to}} suffer drug-induced panic attacks during this period. His {{depression}} and paranoid well-being inspired the song [...] "Gas Panic!", subsequently {{included on the}} 2000 album Standing on the Shoulder of Giants. He claimed to have quit using illicit drugs on 5 June 1998. Gallagher stated in 2001, [...] "I liked drugs, I was good at them. But I'd had panic attacks for about a <b>year</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> stopped because [...] I wanted to. After you make the decision, it is quite easy."

He was inducted into the NASCAR Hall of Fame on May 23, 2011.|$|E
500|$|Durant {{entered the}} 2009 {{season as the}} club's {{starting}} quarterback, but head coach Ken Miller gave backup Jyles significant playing time as well. Durant {{made the most of}} his opportunity, becoming the first Roughrider quarterback to start all 18 games since Kent Austin, who last played for the club in 1993. Durant's consistency on the field {{was one of the reasons}} he earned the Roughriders' starting quarterback position, along with his ability to run for yards when his pass protection breaks down. Durant was named the Roughriders nominee for CFL Most Outstanding Player, and was selected a West Division All-Star at quarterback. He was also named the Roughriders' Wireless Age Most Popular Player. Durant led the Roughriders to the Grey Cup, where they were defeated by the Montreal Alouettes on a last second field goal. He finished the 2009 season with 4,348 passing yards and 501 rushing yards. Durant threw 24 touchdown passes during the season and also had 21 interceptions, leading the CFL. Heading into the 2010 season, Durant wanted to cut down on his interceptions, although he tried to be optimistic, [...] "I throw 21 picks last <b>year</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> guarantee every guy with better stats than me wishes they were in the Grey Cup." ...|$|E

But the truth is, I'm not perfect. This is not about perfection. I don't expect anybody else to be perfect either.

[...] Maxim gave the same console version eight out of ten and said that it was [...] "much more varied this year, i.e. there are far fewer of those hit-a-homer-or-fail objectives, and more small-ball, hit-and-run-type scenarios." [...] However, USA Today gave the same console version seven out of ten, saying that it [...] "isn't going to wow you with unique controls or powerful graphic. But it provides a smooth, consistent baseball experience." ...|$|E
2500|$|.....there surely is {{some common}} ground when both {{those who believe}} in choice and those who are opposed to {{abortion}} can come together and say, 'We should try to prevent unintended pregnancies by providing appropriate education to our youth, communicating that sexuality is sacred and that they should not be engaged in cavalier activity, and providing options for adoption, and helping single mothers if they want to choose to keep the baby'. Those are all things that we put in the Democratic platform {{for the first time this}} <b>year,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> think that's where we can find some common ground, because nobody's pro-abortion. I think it's always a tragic situation. We should try to reduce these circumstances." ...|$|E

2500|$|After the game, Allen {{was cited}} {{as one of}} the main reasons for Duke's {{comeback}} and win by commentators. Mike Krzyzewski agreed, saying, [...] "We were kind of dead in the water. We were nine points down and Grayson just put us on his back." [...] Commenting on his team's loss, Bo Ryan credited Duke's physical defense saying [...] "There was more body contact in this game than any game we played all <b>year,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> just feel sorry for my guys that all of the sudden a game was like that, and I think they're struggling with that a little bit." [...] Ryan, however, also blamed the officials, citing the disparity in fouls called during the second half (Wisconsin's 13 to Duke's 6) and the controversial replay review near the end of the game.|$|E

Rickles won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program, besting a number of notable comics, including David Letterman, Jon Stewart, and Stephen Colbert. Rickles remarked, [...] "Stephen Colbert's a funny man, but he's too young. He has got {{plenty of time to}} win awards, but this may be my last <b>year</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> think that I made it count. On second thought it was probably just a mercy award for an old man."

2500|$|In season 2, the {{basketball}} drama was completely {{removed from the}} series, as executives felt that the show was geared more toward a male audience. David Janollari, then entertainment president at The WB, attributed the show's sophomore success partly to its shift in focus from a male-driven sports plot to expanding the stories of its girls. He felt they had time to [...] "step back and learn from audience response" [...] and that Schwahn tailored the show toward the [...] "core audience". Schwahn said, [...] "Girls watch the show in large numbers. , the girls were sort of appendages to the boys." [...] Show producer Joe Davola and Schwahn agreed with the [...] "sex sells" [...] and [...] "skin to win" [...] sentiments. Less time on {{the basketball}} court could afford One Tree Hill more time for plots fueled by sex and drugs. Lack of basketball drama, however, meant a decrease in male viewership. In a 2006 interview, Schwahn said, [...] "In the second TV season, we didn't play any basketball, which was the rest of their junior <b>year,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> felt that the show suffered a little bit." ...|$|E

Anderson said he would appeal the verdict, claiming that, [...] ""The prosecution has criminalized being a legislator over this past <b>year.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> think I fell victim to that." [...] His sentencing was scheduled for October 2, 2007, but was delayed until October 14, 2007. Anderson faced a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment and a $250,000 fine on the extortion counts; 20 years and a $500,000 fine on each of the money laundering counts; 10 years and a $250,000 fine on the bribery count; and five years and a $250,000 fine on the conspiracy count.

2500|$|The {{newspaper}} highlighted {{four factors}} driving {{the opposition to}} the mosque: a dislike of immigrants, a fear that Christianity was losing its grip on a Bible Belt heartland, a [...] "swell of fear and hatred" [...] prompted by terrorist attacks, and the insecurity of the worst economic climate since the Great Depression. In past slumps, Chinese immigrants had been ostracized for being non-Christians, Catholics had been ostracized for being [...] "the wrong kind of Christians", and this time Muslims were suffering the brunt of prejudice. Rabbi Rami Shapiro noted that [...] "Muslims are in the way of God's plan" [...] for some anti-Muslim Christian Zionists, who believe that Muslims in Iran and Iraq will be forced out of their homes by Israeli expansion that will pave the way for the Second Coming of Jesus. Professor Ron Messier, who teaches Islamic studies and lives in Murfreesboro, commented: [...] "It's happened because this is an election <b>year</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> think there were some political candidates who thought that, here in Middle Tennessee, {{a lot of people have}} very right leanings and they could gain some political leverage by promoting fear about people who have been here for 20 years or more without ever being an issue." ...|$|E

[...] Following VA-11 HALL-As announcement, Brandon Orselli of Niche Gamer expressed optimism, writing [...] "I'm a huge fan of cyberpunk fiction, and I feel like the genre is severely neglected if not mishandled in the gaming industry. The team at Sukeban Games seem to really be paying close attention to everything they possibly can within their game's fiction, and it shines through even in this early form."
