5000|$|The {{doctrine}} of tawhid, {{in the words}} of the prominent Mu’tazili scholar Chief Justice Qadi Abd al-Jabbar (d. 415 AH/1025 AD), is: [...] the knowledge that God, being unique, has attributes that no creature shares with Him. This is explained by the fact <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> the world has a creator who created it and that: He existed eternally in the past and He cannot perish while we exist after being non-existent and we can perish. And <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> He was and is eternally all-powerful and that impotence is not possible for Him. And <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> He is omniscient of the past and present and that ignorance is not possible for Him. And <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> He <b>knows</b> everything <b>that</b> was, everything that is, and how things that are not would be if they were. And <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> He is eternally in the past and future living, and that calamities and pain are not possible for Him. And <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> He sees visible things, and perceives perceptibles, and that He does not have need of sense organs. And <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> He is eternally past and in future sufficient and it is not possible for Him to be in need. And <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> He is not like physical bodies, and that it is not possible for Him to get up or down, move about, change, be composite, have a form, limbs and body members. And <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> He is not like the accidents of motion, rest, color, food or smells. And <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> He is One throughout eternity and there is no second beside Him, and that everything other than He is contingent, made, dependent, structured, and governed by someone/thing else. Thus, if <b>you</b> <b>know</b> all of <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> the oneness of God.|$|R

5000|$|This epistemic closure {{principle}} {{is central to}} many versions of skeptical arguments. A skeptical argument of this type will involve knowledge of some piece of widely accepted information to be knowledge, which will then be pointed out to entail knowledge of some skeptical scenario, such as the brain in a vat scenario or the cartesian evil demon scenario. A skeptic might say, for example, <b>that</b> if <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have hands, then <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are not a handless brain in a vat (because knowledge that you have hands implies <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> are not handless, and if <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are not handless, then <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are not a handless brain in a vat). [...] The skeptic will then utilize this conditional to form a modus tollens argument. For example, the skeptic might make an argument like the following: ...|$|R
