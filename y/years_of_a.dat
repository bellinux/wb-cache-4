5|$|In 1951, the U.S. {{ratified}} the 22nd Amendment, making a president ineligible for election {{to a third}} term or for election to a second full term after serving more than two remaining <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> term of a previously elected president. The latter clause would have applied to Truman's situation in 1952 except that a grandfather clause in the amendment explicitly excluded the amendment from applying to the incumbent president.|$|E
5|$|The Ashland Junior College {{was founded}} in 1938 to allow {{students}} the opportunity to obtain an associate degree or to complete their first two <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bachelor's degree. During the same year, the Ashland Vocational School was created by the Ashland Independent School system, providing vocational and technical training.|$|E
5|$|Within {{a billion}} <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> galaxy's formation, key {{structures}} begin to appear. Globular clusters, the central supermassive black hole, and a galactic bulge of metal-poor Population II stars form. The {{creation of a}} supermassive black hole appears to {{play a key role}} in actively regulating the growth of galaxies by limiting the total amount of additional matter added. During this early epoch, galaxies undergo a major burst of star formation.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} graduate, the school {{requires}} 4 <b>years</b> <b>of</b> English classes, 4 <b>years</b> <b>of</b> Physical Education, 3 <b>years</b> <b>of</b> mathematics, 3 <b>years</b> <b>of</b> sciences, 3 <b>years</b> <b>of</b> history, 1 <b>years</b> in foreign language, 1 <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> practical art, and 1 <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fine/performing art.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} {{graduate}} from Parsippany Hills High School, a student must take at least 24 credits of courses, where one credit equals a one period full-year class. A student must take four <b>years</b> <b>of</b> English, three <b>years</b> <b>of</b> mathematics, three <b>years</b> <b>of</b> science, three <b>years</b> <b>of</b> social sciences, one <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> career development course, one <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> foreign language, and one <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> visual and performing arts elective. In addition, all students must pass the New Jersey High School Proficiency Assessment (HSPA) in their junior or senior year.|$|R
50|$|At the minimum, {{students}} are required to complete three <b>years</b> <b>of</b> history/social science courses, four <b>years</b> <b>of</b> English, two <b>years</b> <b>of</b> mathematics, two <b>years</b> <b>of</b> science, one <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> foreign language, one <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> visual or performing arts, two <b>years</b> <b>of</b> physical education, one semester of health, and 80 credits of elective courses.|$|R
5|$|By 1508, {{construction}} work was completed {{at the north}} of the Loggia, which contained the staircase to access the upper level of the public building. The construction is designed as a body in itself, separated from the main building by a path and connected to it by a covered overpass, a configuration that has come down to us intact. The contribution of Cairano, who at that point returned to the Loggia after at least five <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> stellar career elsewhere, is the portal to the ground floor of the annex and in some ornamentation on the overpass.|$|E
5|$|On September 7, 1874, the new {{constitution}} was completed and signed {{by a majority of}} delegates. The entire electorate, including the disenfranchised Confederates and the Freedmen, voted. The election not only was for ratification of the {{new constitution}} but also for state officials that would be elected if the constitution was indeed ratified. The Republicans actually took the same position that the Democrats had taken earlier, believing that the election was illegal they nominated no candidates. Conservative Democrats and allied paramilitary groups suppressed black voting, using a combination of intimidation, blocking blacks from the polls, and outright assassinations. The new constitution was ratified on October 13, 1874 and Democratic officials elected almost unanimously, including new Democratic Governor Augustus H. Garland who was inaugurated November 12, 1874, and Baxter left office after only serving two <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> four-year term.|$|E
5|$|Other public bills {{could no}} longer be vetoed; instead, they could be delayed for up to two years. This two-year period meant that {{legislation}} introduced in the fourth or fifth <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> parliament could be delayed until after the next election, which could prove an effective measure to prevent it being passed. Specifically, two years had to elapse between the second reading in the House of Commons in the first session and the passing of the bill in the House of Commons in the third session. The Speaker has to also certify that the conditions of the bill had been complied with. Significant restrictions on amendments are made to ensure that it is the same bill that has been rejected twice. The 1911 Act made clear that the life of a parliament could not be extended without the consent of the Lords.|$|E
50|$|Foundation degrees {{must include}} a pathway for {{graduate}} to a progress to an honours degree. This may be via joining the final <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> standard three-year course {{or through a}} dedicated 'top-up' course. Students can also transfer to other institutions to take a top-up course or the final <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> honours course. It may also be possible for students to join the second <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> honours course in a different but related subject.|$|R

5|$|P. lanceolata shrubs {{destroyed}} by bushfire regenerate through seedlings surviving through seedbank in the soil. The Ku-ring-gai Chase {{study found that}} seedlings germinated within two <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 1994 bushfire, although some appeared up to six years afterwards, while germination {{was not related to}} any particular season. Plants take six years to reach maturity. Thus, more frequent bushfires prevent recruitment and hence endanger populations. However, plants in Lane Cove National Park were recorded maturing three years after an especially intense bushfire. What triggers germination is unknown, and seedlings have also arisen from areas disturbed by sand mining, sometimes growing in higher concentrations than before the disturbance. The natural lifespan of a plant appears to range from 25 to 60 years.|$|E
5|$|Scientists also {{view the}} ability to grow very long hair {{as a result of}} sexual selection, since long and healthy hair is a sign of {{fertility}} and youth. An evolutionary biology explanation for this attraction is that hair length and quality can act as a cue to youth and health, signifying a woman's reproductive potential. As hair grows slowly, long hair may reveal 2–3 <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> person's health status, nutrition, age and reproductive fitness. Malnutrition and deficiencies in minerals and vitamins due to starvation causes loss of hair or changes in hair color (e.g. dark hair turning reddish).|$|E
