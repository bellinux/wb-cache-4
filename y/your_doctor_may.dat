40|$|This {{paper is}} {{adressed}} to doctors {{who work with}} patients who have chronic or incurable disease. For {{most of the people}} physical health would seem one of the main assets. Faced with a diagnosis of degenerative disease, incurable, chronic, with a simplistic syllogism {{it could be argued that}} if good health is the main element of a good life, deprivation of health involves a bad life and so there is no attrattive to keep on living. The question is: what’s the meaning of life? Many people would answer that we want to be happy. Then we could rephrase the question asking if you can be happy with a chronic illness or which resources are required to live in the best way you can in that situation. The author considers the definition of happiness and the association between that and health/disease. Are highlighted some personal characteristics that can help patients to cope with the disease. A major part of the unhappiness of the people with chronic and / or severe is linked to the consequences of the disease, especially in the loss or reduction of social relations. The patients have different availability of building relationships, but at least there is one significant opportunity on meeting: with <b>your</b> <b>doctor.</b> The <b>doctor</b> <b>may</b> use this channel to comunicate to patient the lifestyles and self-care, which look to the positive way and to the chance to live happily even in sickness...|$|R

50|$|The use of oral {{steroids and}} {{anti-inflammatory}} medicines help {{to reduce the}} amount of inflammation and pain felt in the knee. If over the counter medicines like ibuprofen or naproxen are not strong enough, prescription strength medicines are used. If oral medicine and physical therapy don't help <b>your</b> knee enough, <b>doctors</b> <b>may</b> consider giving patients injections with pain medicine. Hyaluronic acid is present in the knee, but injections of it can be used to protect the joint when the cartilage becomes thinner and can't do it alone. These injections can provide more pain relief than oral medications lasting from six months to a year.|$|R
50|$|Powerchairs are {{generally}} prescribed {{for use by}} users {{who are unable to}} use a manual wheelchair. However, in both the US (Medicare and some private insurers) and the UK (National Health Service) powerchairs {{are generally}} not prescribed to users who have any ability to walk within the home, even if that ability is so functionally constrained as to be practically useless and where the user is unable to use a manual wheelchair independently. If in doubt, contact <b>your</b> <b>doctor</b> who <b>may</b> refer you for an assessment. Disability rights activists are campaigning for prescription procedures to focus on an individual needs based assessment rather than on inflexible application of prescription rules. The restricted prescribing leads to many users being forced to procure a solution privately, in some cases settling for a powerchair or a mobility scooter that is less than ideal to their needs but which falls within their budget. In the UK, under the NHS, patients are assessed individually and the criteria for prescription are used to guide the assessment process to help achieve a fair and equitable assessment.|$|R

40|$|July 28 th is World Hepatitis Day 2014. Canada’s slogan {{this year}} is “Know your status? Get tested. ” Many people with viral {{hepatitis}} have no obvious symptoms. In Canada, about 1 in 5 people with Hepatitis C do not know they have the virus. If left untreated, viral hepatitis can lead to severe damage to the liver. The Canadian Liver Foundation recommends that all adults born between 1945 and 1975 consider being tested for Hepatitis C. As the Hepatitis C virus can be transmitted by any blood-to-blood contact and many adults are unaware of their own risk factors, widespread testing can identify those who contracted Hepatitis C and have been living with it for many years.
