25|$|For the 1998–99 season, the Kings {{unveiled}} new logos, {{uniforms and}} color scheme, restoring the purple – albeit a lighter shade compared to Forum Blue – as grey and black had become associated with gang colors. The new primary logo was a shield and crest featuring three royal symbols, a lion, a crown and the Sun. The jerseys featured the shield logo with hints of purple on the <b>yoke,</b> <b>sleeve</b> stripes and tail. By coincidence, {{this was the}} same color scheme as the NBA's Sacramento team which is also called the Kings. The bottom of the jerseys read the city name. A purple alternate jersey featuring the updated secondary crown logo was unveiled for the 1999–2000 season. In 2002, the crown logo became the primary while the shield logo was demoted to alternate status. The socks on the black and purple uniforms also switched designations to match their counterparts. Upon moving to the Reebok Edge design in 2007, the jerseys were updated without the tail stripes. The purple-tinged road jerseys were used until the 2010–11 season, while the home jersey was demoted to alternate status in 2011 and remained in use until 2013.|$|E

50|$|During {{the tenure}} of General Manager John Ferguson, Sr., he sought to {{modernize}} the Rangers sweater by featuring rounded numbers, a darker shade of blue and the shield logo, which was unveiled in the 1976-77 season.

5000|$|The gowns for bachelors and masters at Stanford University {{follow the}} pattern {{laid out by}} the Intercollegiate Code. These gowns are based on those of the same level at the University of Oxford. Masters at Stanford wear gowns {{that are similar to}} the Oxford MA m1 with the opening for the hand at the wrist instead of the elbow. The system at Stanford differs from the ICC in its {{doctoral}} robes. These were designed in 1977 by chemistry Professor Eric Hutchinson to reflect the robes of his alma mater, the University of Cambridge. [...] It is {{a modified version of the}} Cambridge doctors d1 robe. The side panels of the robe are cardinal red with black facings and a black <b>yoke.</b> The <b>sleeves</b> are black with the cuffs covered in red and lined with satin of a color indicating the scholarly discipline of the wearer's degree—following the pattern laid out in the ICC. At the top of each facing is the coat of arms of the university school (Eric Hutchinson also designed coats of arms for each of the schools in the university) that can be blazoned On a Saltire Gules a Chief Argent. The chief difference between the shape of the Stanford robe and the true Cambridge doctor's robe is that the sleeves of the former are narrower and reach to the wrists in front. The front of the Cambridge sleeves reach only to the elbows. The use of a PhD robe based on a Cambridge model was unique within the United States until Vanderbilt University began using a similar style robe for PhDs in 2005.|$|R
5000|$|Until 1976, the Theological Department of King's College London (a {{distinct}} institution from King's College London {{and not to}} {{be confused}} with the latter's Faculty of Theology) awarded the Theological AKC. This was an ordination qualification in the Church of England and was a three-year, full-time course of studies. Some ordination candidates read the AKC only and some read the combined BD/AKC course, receiving both qualifications at the end of the three years. The Theological AKC was equivalent to a BA pass degree in theology. It was awarded in three classes with an undivided second class. Holders were entitled to wear distinctive academic dress by a grant of the Archbishop of Canterbury. The hood is of the [...] "Cambridge shape" [...] (MA), made of black poplin and edged, inside and out, with [...] "one inch of mauve silk". The gown resembles the classic MA design of the ancient universities with a few exceptions (e.g. it had a black button and cord at the back of the <b>yoke).</b> Also, its <b>sleeves</b> are cut square, that is, without the [...] "crescent" [...] shaping of the other universities.|$|R

40|$|The San Bias Islands, one {{for each}} day of the year, lie on the Caribbean side of Panama in a chain of tiny atolls. The Cuna Indians, who left the {{mainland}} long ago seeking peaceful isolation, live a quiet communal life in the thatched houses that crowd these Islands. The Cunas have always been self-sufficient, raising their food, building their houses and canoes and making their tools, medicines and clothing. Their economy has long been based on the sale of coconuts, but some men work in the Canal Zone and some sail as merchant seamen and this income enables them to buy cloth and manufactured items, although their wants remain simple. The folk craft of making molas has existed for about one hundred twenty-five years, beginning when the Cunas moved from the mainland to the Islands where the cooler nights necessitated warmer clothing. The women sewed blouses with simple applique borders at first and gradually increased the size of these decorative strips until, with a panel in front and one in the back, only a <b>yoke</b> and short <b>sleeves</b> were needed to complete a kind of quilted garment. This blouse is worn with a dark colored, sarong-like wrapped skirt and bright red head scarf with painted yellow designs. Once every woman wore a gold nose ring and painted a black line down the center of her nose because a long nose was considered beautiful. This is a practice that seems to be dying out, but, when there was an effort to outlaw the wearing of molas, the women flatly refused. Although the women do not hold governing positions, the Cunas have a matriarchal society. A man may not sell property without his wife 2 ̆ 7 s permission and when a daughter marries, her husband is obligated to live with her family and contribute to its support. The Cuna women have developed the fine needlework of molas into a distinctive art found nowhere else in the world. The technique has been called reverse applique and is created from three or more layers of cloth. The cloth is basted together and the design drawn on the top layer. Using small scissors, the woman cuts through the top layer and with tiny, even stitches she catches the narrowly turned edge to the cloth beneath. She then cuts through to the next layer and sews the raw edges under to leave a narrow line of that color showing. This process is continued until the bottom layer appears and the shapes are outlined by a series of colored lines. Any space between the main shapes is filled by an all-over pattern of short cuts often revealing strips of color as a result of small pieces of various colored cloth underlaid in these areas. Regularly appliqued shapes may be superimposed on the mola and bits of embroidery in colored threads may be added details...|$|R
