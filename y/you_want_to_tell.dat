Cooder {{said that he did}} not want to [...] "over-think it" [...] and said of his creative process for each song's distinct style, [...] "It’s taken a long time, but it becomes natural to combine an idea you have or a story <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> with whatever seems conducive." [...] Graham Reid of The New Zealand Herald writes that the music [...] "refers to the dustbowl era, rural blues, Tex-Mex (with accordionist Flaco Jimenez) and old-time folk." [...] The Observers Neil Spencer comments that it is [...] "grounded in the blues, folk and Tex-Mex the guitarist explored in the 1970s, but its songs belong to modern times."

500|$|Gilbert Adair, {{writing in}} a review for Full Metal Jacket, commented that [...] "Kubrick's {{approach}} to language has always been of a reductive and uncompromisingly deterministic nature. He appears to view it as the exclusive product of environmental conditioning, only very marginally influenced by concepts of subjectivity and interiority, by all whims, shades and modulations of personal expression". Johnson notes that although Kubrick was a [...] "visual filmmaker", he also loved words and was like a writer in his approach, very sensitive to the story itself, which he found unique. Before shooting began, Kubrick tried to have the script as complete as possible, but still allowed himself enough space to make changes during the filming, finding it [...] "more profitable to avoid locking up any ideas about staging or camera or even dialogue prior to rehearsals" [...] as he put it. Kubrick told Robert Emmett Ginna: [...] "I {{think you have to}} view the entire problem of putting the story <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> up there on that light square. It begins with the selection of the property; it continues through the creation of the story, the sets, the costumes, the photography and the acting. And when the picture is shot, it's only partially finished. I think the cutting is just a continuation of directing a movie. I think the use of music effects, opticals and finally main titles are all part of telling the story. And I think the fragmentation of these jobs, by different people, is a very bad thing". Kubrick also said: [...] "I think that the best plot is no apparent plot. I like a slow start, the start that gets under the audience's skin and involves them so that they can appreciate grace notes and soft tones and don't have to be pounded over the head with plot points and suspense tools." ...|$|E
500|$|A Kryptonian {{general and}} {{megalomaniac}} {{with the same}} superpowers as Superman, bent on transforming Earth into a new Krypton under his reign. Viggo Mortensen was considered for the role. Snyder stated, [...] "Zod is not only one of Superman's most formidable enemies, {{but one of the}} most significant because he has insights into Superman that others don't. Michael is a powerful actor who can project both the intelligence and the malice of the character, making him perfect for the role." [...] When Goyer was asked about why Zod was chosen as the villain, he stated, [...] "The way (Christopher) Nolan and I have always approached movies as well is you never say, 'Hey, which villain would be cool for this movie?' You start with the story first. What kind of story? What kind of theme do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell?</b> So we worked that out. Then, usually the villain becomes obvious in terms of who's going to be the appropriate antagonist for that. When you guys see the movie, the only villain we could've used was Zod and the Kryptonians. I mean, when you see what the whole story is, nothing else would have even made sense." [...] Shannon also commented on his portrayal in comparison to Terence Stamp's original take on Zod, [...] "To follow Terence Stamp's iconic performance in the original, it is daunting, but I just focused on one day at a time. It's interesting that when we started with this, we did a lot of training together and I think that kind of helped loosen things up a little bit. It is a very physical movie at the end of the day. That's a good way to find your way 'into it' [...]" ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Walt and Mearsheimer {{undermine}} {{our intelligence}} by assuming {{that we are}} simply being manipulated.... If the lobby is so influential over the media, how were Walt and Mearsheimer given such space in every major news outlet {{in the country to}} express their 'dangerous' views? <b>You</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me that a force that can impel us to got [...] to war in Iraq can’t find a way to censor two academics? Not much of a lobby, now is it?" [...] Writing for the Columbia Journalism Review, Beckerman cites examples of op-eds critical of Israel from several major U.S. newspapers and concludes that an equally compelling argument could be made that the Israel lobby doesn't control the media. [...] Itamar Rabinovich, writing for the Brookings Institution, wrote, [...] "The {{truth of the matter is}} that, insofar as the lobby ever tries to intimidate and silence, the effort usually causes more damage than it redresses. In any event, the power of the lobby to do that is very modest." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rosenberg {{talked about}} the freedom that the series had, saying that it would go [...] "even further in all our storytelling" [...] than what Brian Michael Bendis did in the Alias comic: [...] "That's the beauty of working with Netflix. It's 13 [...] There's no pilot and then getting feedback, {{reaction}} and ratings. You're in this bubble. So, what's the story <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell?</b> Where {{do you want to}} go with ?" [...] Expanding on this, Rosenberg said that [...] "we start off with [...] incredible source material and Jessica Jones isn’t as well known in the universe obviously as Daredevil and everyone else, so it really allows for a lot of freedom in there. So there are restrictions in terms of the Marvel niverse of certain rules of mythology, but within that it’s free pass". Rosenberg noted that the final series is very different to the version she developed for ABC because of the different mythology of the MCU.|$|E
2500|$|Zeitgeist {{received}} mixed reviews, {{indicated by}} {{a score of}} 59/100 on Metacritic. Some negative criticism of the album stemmed from the absence of half of the original lineup, with Pitchfork Media's Rob Mitchum suggesting the name was revived for [...] "cash or attention or both." [...] Qs Paul Rees commented that [...] "at least half of Zeitgeist {{is made up of}} grinding songs that amount to riffs, pummelling and little else," [...] and that Zeitgeists emotional range is [...] "limited and wearing", but praised Chamberlin's drumming, stating that he [...] "remains {{one of the most powerful}} drummers in rock." [...] In addition, Modern Drummer proclaimed that the album contains [...] "Chamberlin's greatest drumming ever put to CD." [...] NME gave it a score of five out of ten and said, [...] "It's best treated as a curio in the Smashing Pumpkins' legacy; and for those who grew up on 'Today', '1979' and 'Ava Adore', you're better left with your memories." [...] The A.V. Club gave it a C+ and said that it [...] "ends up sounding like a Corgan career retrospective in B-side form." [...] musicOMH gave it a score of two-and-a-half stars out of five and said, [...] "Recounting such thoughts, by this point almost an hour has been spent in the company of a record which stares back at you with the appeal of an ex you'd rather not have bumped into." [...] Hot Press gave it a mixed review and said, [...] "The best you can offer is that it’s not a disaster – now do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> Billy or should I?" [...] Robert Christgau simply gave the record a [...] "Dud" [...] rating (...) [...] Slant Magazine gave it a score of two out of five and called it [...] "the Pumpkins' most aggressively metal album to date. But heaps of guitars, vocal overdubs, and ridiculous effects don't mask a lack of inventiveness or even plain ol' quality songwriting." [...] Canadian magazine Now also gave it a score of two stars out of five and called it [...] "no-frills rawk that's been dumbed down for mass consumption." [...] Melodic magazine gave it a score of three stars out of five, calling the album a disappointing return of the band. Tiny Mix Tapes gave it a score of one-and-a-half stars out of five and said that [...] "the mixing problems extend far beyond Corgan's voice. The Band of a Hundred Murderous Guitars has turned into a modern-radio-rock band." ...|$|E
