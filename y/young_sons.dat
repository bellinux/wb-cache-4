5|$|Cyan {{partnered with}} Dark Horse Comics in 1993 {{to release a}} limited four-part comic series called Myst: The Book of Black Ships. The series would have focused on Atrus and his <b>young</b> <b>sons,</b> taking place before the events of Myst. The first issue was {{released}} on September 3, 1997, but further books were canceled after Cyan decided the first issue did {{not live up to}} expectations. Another comic, Myst #0: Passages, was later released online.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} death of Duncan his two <b>young</b> <b>sons</b> were sent away for greater safety—exactly where is the subject of debate. According to one version, Malcolm (then aged about nine) was sent to England, and his younger brother Donalbane was sent to the Isles. Based on Fordun's account, it was assumed that Malcolm passed most of Macbeth's seventeen-year reign in the Kingdom of England at the court of Edward the Confessor.|$|E
50|$|Children of {{the eldest}} son of a peer also obtain a special precedence. Generally, {{the eldest son}} of the eldest son of a peer comes {{immediately}} before his uncles, while the <b>younger</b> <b>sons</b> of the eldest son of a peer come after them. Therefore, eldest sons of eldest sons of dukes come before <b>younger</b> <b>sons</b> of dukes, and <b>younger</b> <b>sons</b> of eldest sons of dukes come after them, and so forth for all the ranks. Below the <b>younger</b> <b>sons</b> of barons are baronets, knights, circuit judges and companions of the various orders of Chivalry, followed by the eldest <b>sons</b> of <b>younger</b> <b>sons</b> of peers.|$|R

5|$|As {{soldiers}} {{approached the}} sacristy, {{one of the}} <b>young</b> <b>sons</b> of defender Anthony Wolf stood to pull a blanket over his shoulders. In the dark, Mexican soldiers mistook him for an adult and killed him. Possibly the last Texian to die in battle was Jacob Walker, who attempted to hide behind Susannah Dickinson and was bayoneted {{in front of the}} women. Another Texian, Brigido Guerrero, also sought refuge in the sacristy. Guerrero, who had deserted from the Mexican Army in December 1835, was spared after convincing the soldiers he was a Texian prisoner.|$|E
5|$|In 1937, Victoria's brother, Ernest Louis, {{died and}} soon {{afterwards}} her widowed sister-in-law, nephew, granddaughter {{and two of}} her great-grandchildren all died in an air crash at Ostend. Victoria's granddaughter, Princess Cecilie of Greece and Denmark, had married Victoria's nephew (Ernest Louis's son), George Donatus of Hesse. They and their two <b>young</b> <b>sons,</b> Louis and Alexander, were all killed. Cecilie was pregnant {{at the time and}} the stillborn child was found among the wreckage. Cecilie's youngest child, Johanna, who was not on the plane, was adopted by her uncle Prince Louis of Hesse and by Rhine but the little girl only survived her parents and older brothers by eighteen months, dying in 1939 of meningitis.|$|E
5|$|Most of Kassandra's {{family has}} {{come to think of}} her as mad, and become angry when she feels {{compelled}} to vocalize prophecies that foretell the end of Troy. Despite Kassandra's warnings, the city experiences an earthquake sent by Poseidon, killing the three <b>young</b> <b>sons</b> of Helen and Paris. After Patroklus is killed by Hector, his closest friend Akhilles again joins the fight to get his revenge. Hector and his younger brother Troilus are killed, to the grief of everyone in Troy.

5|$|In June 1942, Heydrich {{was assassinated}} in Prague in an {{operation}} led by Jozef Gabčík and Jan Kubiš, members of Czechoslovakia's army-in-exile who had been trained by the British Special Operations Executive. During the two funeral services, Himmler—the chief mourner—took charge of Heydrich's two <b>young</b> <b>sons,</b> and he gave the eulogy in Berlin. On 9 June, after discussions with Himmler and Karl Hermann Frank, Hitler ordered brutal reprisals for Heydrich's death. Over 13,000 people were arrested, and the village of Lidice was razed to the ground; its male inhabitants and all adults {{in the village of}} Ležáky were murdered. At least 1,300 people were executed by firing squads. Himmler took over leadership of the RSHA and stepped up the pace of the killing of Jews in Aktion Reinhard (Operation Reinhard), named in Heydrich's honour. He ordered the Aktion Reinhard camps—the first extermination camps—to be constructed at Bełżec, Sobibór, and Treblinka.|$|E
5|$|Mansur {{was the son}} of Lu'lu' al-Kabir, {{a former}} ghulām (slave soldier; pl. ghilmān) of the Hamdanid emirs of Aleppo who became ḥājib (chamberlain) under Emir Sa'd al-Dawla (r. 967–991). Though Sa'd was officially succeeded by his son Sa'id al-Dawla, power was {{effectively}} held by Lu'lu' al-Kabir. When Sa'id al-Dawla died in January 1002, Lu'lu' ruled Aleppo in the name of Sa'id al-Dawla's <b>young</b> <b>sons</b> Abu al-Hasan Ali and Abu al-Ma'ali Sharif until ousting them shortly afterward and declaring himself a ruler in his own right. Mansur ruled as his father's deputy and partner. Both Mansur and Lu'lu' harassed the remaining members of the Hamdanid dynasty in Aleppo, prompting one of them, Abu al-Hayja' to flee the city for Byzantine territory where he received official protection. At one point Mansur was made governor of Raqqa, which was taken from him by the Numayrid emir Waththab ibn Sabiq in 1007.|$|E
5|$|Although Sweyn {{had promised}} to leave England, he {{returned}} in spring 1070, raiding along the Humber and East Anglia toward the Isle of Ely, where he joined up with Hereward the Wake, a local thegn. Hereward's forces attacked Peterborough Abbey, which they captured and looted. William was able to secure the departure of Sweyn and his fleet in 1070, allowing {{him to return to}} the continent to deal with troubles in Maine, where the town of Le Mans had revolted in 1069. Another concern was the death of Count Baldwin VI of Flanders in July 1070, which led to a succession crisis as his widow, Richilde, was ruling for their two <b>young</b> <b>sons,</b> Arnulf and Baldwin. Her rule, however, was contested by Robert, Baldwin's brother. Richilde proposed marriage to William fitzOsbern, who was in Normandy, and fitzOsbern accepted. But after he was killed in February 1071 at the Battle of Cassel, Robert became count. He was opposed to King William's power on the continent, thus the Battle of Cassel upset {{the balance of power in}} northern France in addition to costing William an important supporter.|$|E
50|$|Three {{other members}} of the family have also gained distinction. Nicholas Ridley-Colborne, <b>younger</b> <b>son</b> of the second Baronet, was a {{politician}} and was created Baron Colborne in 1839.

5|$|In {{the eighth}} century, Mercia {{was the most}} {{powerful}} kingdom in southern England, {{but in the early}} ninth Wessex became dominant. In the 820s King Egbert of Wessex conquered south-east England (Kent, Surrey, Sussex and Essex). His reign saw the beginning of Viking attacks, but Egbert and his son Æthelwulf, who succeeded in 839, were able to resist them. Æthelwulf died in 858, and he was followed by four sons in succession. King Æthelbald died in 860, and King Æthelberht in 865; Æthelwold's father, Æthelred, then succeeded to the throne. In the same year the Viking Great Heathen Army invaded England. Within five years they had conquered Northumbria and East Anglia, and forced Mercia to buy them off. In late 870 the Vikings invaded Wessex, and in early 871 they fought armies under Æthelred and Alfred in four battles in quick succession, the last two of which Wessex lost. Æthelred died shortly after Easter that year, leaving <b>young</b> <b>sons.</b> Primogeniture was not established in this period, and it was believed that kings should be adults, so he was succeeded by his younger brother Alfred.|$|E
5|$|Olga and {{her husband}} refused to leave Russia, and {{decided to move to}} the Caucasus, which the White Army had cleared of revolutionary Bolsheviks. An {{imperial}} bodyguard, Timofei Yatchik, guided them to his hometown, the large Cossack village of Novominskaya. In a rented five-room farmhouse there, Olga gave birth to her second son, Guri Nikolaevich, on 23 April 1919. He was named after a friend of hers, Guri Panayev, who was killed while serving in the Akhtyrsky Regiment during World War I. In November 1919, the family set out on what would be their last journey through Russia. Just ahead of revolutionary troops, they escaped to Novorossiysk, and took refuge in the residence of the Danish consul, Thomas Schytte, who informed them of the Dowager Empress's safe arrival in Denmark. After a brief stay with the consul, the family were shipped to a refugee camp on the island of Büyükada in the Dardanelles Strait near Istanbul, Turkey, where Olga, her husband and children shared three rooms with eleven other adults. After two weeks, they were evacuated to Belgrade in the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes where she was visited by Regent Alexander Karadjordjevich, later King Alexander I of Yugoslavia. Alexander offered the Grand Duchess and her family a permanent home, but Olga was summoned to Denmark by her mother. On Good Friday 1920, Olga and her family arrived in Copenhagen. They lived with the Dowager Empress, at first at the Amalienborg Palace and then at the royal estate of Hvidøre, where Olga acted as her mother's secretary and companion. It was a difficult arrangement at times. The Dowager Empress insisted on having Olga at her beck and call and found Olga's <b>young</b> <b>sons</b> too boisterous. Having never reconciled with the idea of her daughter's marriage to a commoner, she was cold towards Kulikovsky, rarely allowing him in her presence. At formal functions, Olga was expected to accompany her mother alone.|$|E
5|$|On 15 March 963, Emperor Romanos II (r. 959–963) {{unexpectedly}} died, {{leaving his}} <b>young</b> <b>sons</b> Basil II and Constantine VIII as emperors. The powerful general Nikephoros Phokas (the brother of Leo) decided {{to seize the}} throne for himself, but was opposed by the parakoimomenos and guardian of the young emperors, Joseph Bringas. Seeking support, Bringas offered Marianos the high command {{in the east and}} potentially even the throne if he would aid him. Marianos first suggested trying to win over Nikephoros Phokas' popular nephew and lieutenant, the strategos of the Anatolics John Tzimiskes. The latter not only refused, however, but took his letter straight to his uncle, who summoned his armies to Caesarea and had them proclaim him emperor in early summer. As Phokas' army advanced across Asia Minor on Constantinople, Marianos then tried to stage a coup in Constantinople with men of the Macedonian regiments and armed prisoners of war. This move was opposed by the populace, however, resulting in clashes in the streets. The populace became especially enraged when Marianos tried to forcibly remove the Phokades' elderly father, Bardas, from the Hagia Sophia where he had sought sanctuary, on 15 August. Marianos was reportedly hit on the head by a platter, thrown by a woman from a nearby house roof. Mortally wounded, he died on the next day. Phokas' supporters rapidly prevailed thereafter. Bringas was forced to flee himself to the Hagia Sophia, and on 16 August Nikephoros Phokas was crowned senior emperor as guardian of Basil and Constantine.|$|E
