It is also worded {{so as to}} provoke confusion between an object (such as red text), a reference to an object (such as the word [...] "red"), and even more subtle references (the word [...] "word"). The maze ends up being so complicated that it can even be difficult {{to work out the}} next move, let alone the end. In this maze, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> two hands, each starting at a different place.

Variety wrote that [...] "Hanks is the real reason to see the film and those who enjoyed watching him in Big will find a different, more realized comedian." [...] Roger Ebert wrote that it [...] "makes the fatal mistake of taking stand-up seriously. And if you’re gonna do that, you’d better have good material." [...] One review in The Washington Post read that it [...] "commits the unforgivable sin – it's a movie about comedy that's not funny." [...] Another review in the same newspaper declared that [...] "Seltzer has certainly redeemed his past (ever catch that Six Weeks thing between Dudley Moore and Mary Tyler Moore, or the Jon Voight Table for Five?).

[...] He was critical of the control system, saying [...] "Admirable as the attempt at a new attack system may be, we think that a more traditional method of attack {{would have been a}} better way to go." [...] He was also critical of the graphics, and concluded, [...] "Blade II has turned into our most recent poster child for how NOT to make a movie-licensed videogame." [...] Hilary Goldstein was equally unimpressed with the Xbox version. He too was critical of the combat system, finding it too limiting: [...] "The combat system seems to be begging for more. Chains, grabs, fluidity. But those things are absent. Because <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the thumbstick, and because the thumbstick represents the direction of an attack and the attack itself, combat seems very stilted." [...] He was also critical of the story, missions and AI, referring to the game as [...] "a momentary distraction in video game life." ...|$|E

He waddles in his walk; his hands feel for the reins; his toes turn inwards like a duck's. And here, perhaps, we can see why foreign travellers, judging him from their own standpoint, invariably bring against him the charge of laziness. On horseback he is of all men most active. His patient endurance under privations that would drive other men to despair, his laborious days and feats of horsemanship, the long journeys he performs without rest or food, seem to simple dwellers {{on the surface of the}} earth almost like miracles.
