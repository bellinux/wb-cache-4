500|$|In {{addition}} {{to issues of}} Civil Rights, Fonda has been an opponent of oil developments and their adverse effects on the environment. In 2017, while on a trip with Greenpeace to protest oil developments, Fonda criticized Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau saying at the summit on climate change in Paris, known as the Paris agreement, Trudeau [...] "talked so beautifully of needing {{to meet the requirements}} of the climate treaty and to respect and hold to the treaties with indigenous people...and <b>yet</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> betrayed every {{one of the things he}} committed to in Paris." ...|$|E
500|$|Fischer won the Interzonal (held in Palma de Mallorca in November and December 1970) with 18½/23 (+15−1=7), {{far ahead}} of Larsen, Efim Geller, and Robert Hübner, with 15/23. Fischer {{finished}} the tournament with seven consecutive wins. Setting aside the Sousse Interzonal (which Fischer withdrew from while leading), Fischer's victory gave him a string of eight consecutive first prizes in tournaments. Former World Champion Mikhail Botvinnik was not, however, impressed by Fischer's results, stating: [...] "Fischer has been declared a genius. I {{do not agree with}} this... In order to rightly be declared a genius in chess, you have to defeat equal opponents by a big margin. As <b>yet</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> not done this". Despite Botvinnik's remarks, [...] "Fischer began a miraculous year in the history of chess".|$|E

60|$|One might achieve it, {{but it was}} {{independent}} of the will. Hodder's ideals--if <b>he</b> <b>had</b> only known--transcended the rubric. His feeling for Rachel Ogden had not been lacking in tenderness, and <b>yet</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> recoiled from marriage merely {{for the sake of}} getting a wife, albeit one with easy qualification. He shrank instinctively from the humdrum, and sought the heights, stormy though these might prove. As <b>yet</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> not analyzed this craving.|$|R

500|$|Vernon Gholston did {{not play}} {{football}} at Cass until his sophomore year and {{did not play}} on defense (at linebacker) until his senior year. Gholston did not even see himself as a football player {{when he was in}} high school, <b>yet</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> gone on to become an Ohio State Buckeyes football defensive end, the 2007 Big Ten Conference Defensive lineman of the year and the sixth overall selection in the 2008 NFL Draft. [...] According to Gholston, [...] "It was between periods and I was going to my next class. ...He thought I was actually somebody’s father walking down the hall. He asked me whom was I looking for. I was like, 'Nobody. I go here.' He really couldn't believe it. He kind of grabbed me at that point and put me on the team." ...|$|E
500|$|Not surprisingly, Quentin Tarantino {{has lately}} {{become the focus}} {{for this sort of}} {{criticism}} (about the relationship between the movies and acts of violence). The fact that Django Unchained arrived in theaters right {{around the time of the}} Sandy Hook massacre didn't help. <b>Yet</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> refused to give an inch in discussing the link between movie violence and real life. Obviously I don't think one has to do with the other. Movies are about make-believe. It's about imagination. Part of the thing is trying to create a realistic experience, but we are faking it. Is it possible that anyone in our cynical world credits a self-serving sophistry like this? Of course an industry under fire will claim that its hands are clean, just as the NRA has done – and of course a favorite son, be it Tarantino or LaPierre, can be counted on to make the claim louder than anyone else. But do they really believe that imaginative expression is without consequence? ...|$|E
500|$|Shylock {{is a good}} hater; [...] "a man no less sinned against than sinning." [...] If {{he carries}} his revenge too far, <b>yet</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> strong grounds for [...] "the lodged hate he bears Anthonio", which he {{explains}} with equal force of eloquence and reason. He seems the depositary of the vengeance of his race; and though the long habit of brooding over daily insults and injuries has crusted over his temper with inveterate misanthropy, and hardened him against the contempt of mankind, this adds but little to the triumphant pretensions of his enemies. There is a strong, quick, and deep sense of justice mixed up with the gall and bitterness of his resentment. [...] The desire of revenge is almost inseparable from the sense of wrong; and we can hardly help sympathising with the proud spirit, hid beneath his [...] "Jewish gaberdine", stung to madness by repeated undeserved provocations, and labouring to throw off the load of obloquy and oppression heaped upon him and all his tribe by one desperate act of [...] "lawful" [...] revenge, till the ferociousness of {{the means by which}} he is to execute his purpose, and the pertinacity with which he adheres to it, turn us against him; but even at last, when disappointed of the sanguinary revenge with which he had glutted his hopes, and exposed to beggary and contempt by {{the letter of the law}} on which he had insisted with so little remorse, we pity him, and think him hardly dealt with by his judges.|$|E

2500|$|The Telegraph judged Debnam's {{campaign}} {{to have been}} [...] "incompetent": [...] "He is not a buffoon, <b>yet</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> acted one with his campaign gimmickry. He has created traps for himself through silly stunts," [...] it wrote.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Yet</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> also written, [...] "This {{building}} recognizes complexities and contradictions: {{it is both}} {{complex and}} simple, open and closed, big and little; some of its elements are good on one level and bad on another its order accommodates the generic elements and {{of the house in}} general, and the circumstantial elements of a house in particular." ...|$|E

2500|$|Tchaikovsky, in {{a letter}} to his patroness Nadezhda von Meck was also {{critical}} of Mussorgsky: [...] "Mussorgsky you very rightly call a hopeless case. In talent he is perhaps superior to all the , but his nature is narrow-minded, devoid of any urge towards self-perfection, blindly believing in the ridiculous theories of his circle and in his own genius. In addition, he has a certain base side to his nature which likes coarseness, uncouthness, roughness. He flaunts his illiteracy, takes pride in his ignorance, mucks along anyhow, blindly believing in the infallibility of his genius. <b>Yet</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> flashes of talent which are, moreover, not devoid of originality." ...|$|E
2500|$|Allusions to sectarian difference, {{widespread}} in Northern Ireland through his lifetime, {{can be found}} in his poems. His books Wintering Out (1973) and North (1975) seek to interweave commentary on the Troubles with a historical context and wider human experience. While some critics accused Heaney of being [...] "an apologist and a mythologiser" [...] of the violence, Blake Morrison suggests the poet has written poems directly about the Troubles as well as elegies for friends and acquaintances who have died in them; he has tried to discover a historical framework in which to interpret the current unrest; and he has taken on the mantle of public spokesman, someone looked to for comment and guidance... <b>Yet</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> also shown signs of deeply resenting this role, defending the right of poets to be private and apolitical, and questioning the extent to which poetry, however [...] "committed", can influence the course of history.|$|E
2500|$|He {{has already}} been tagged as the second [...] "Captain Grumpy" [...] since Allan Border early in his {{captaincy}} reign, having to warn Mitchell Starc for unsportsmanlike behaviour, and being {{highly critical of the}} team's bowling and fielding despite beating New Zealand by over 200 runs. <b>Yet,</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> also scored 4 centuries in 5 Tests as captain, including a maiden second-innings century against New Zealand in Perth, which was also Mitchell Johnson's final cricket match. He was also undefeated in the his first 10 Tests as captain, the only one out of the past 4 captains to do so. However, late in 2016, he accumulated consecutive Test series losses, which prompted a reshuffle of the selector's panel. He is also known for being reluctant to use spinners as he no longer bowls on a regular basis, and is very defensive when he does. Since the reshuffle, however, he has used Lyon and Steve O'Keefe in tandem more, which could be due to necessity in India's spin-friendly pitches.|$|E

2500|$|The Arkansas {{volunteers were}} mustered {{into the service}} of the United States on July 13. [...] Five days later the regiment, 800 men and 40 wagons, set off on a march to San Antonio, Texas, by way of Shreveport, Louisiana. [...] At San Antonio they {{reported}} to General John E. Wool, who was busy attempting to organize a campaign against Chihuahua Province, Mexico. [...] Immediately upon making camp at San Antonio it became apparent that Colonel Yell was not up to his tasks as regimental commander. [...] His organization of the camp was haphazard, necessitating General Wool to order its removal to a new location. [...] Yell made no attempt to train the men, although Pike and Captain John Preston (commander of the Phillips County volunteers) drilled their companies. [...] Pike complained bitterly about the ineptitude of Colonel Yell. [...] He wrote back home to Little Rock that Yell “is the laughing stock of the men—for as <b>yet</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> never undertaken to give an order without making a blunder.” [...] Josiah Gregg, who accompanied the Arkansas troops as an interpreter and scout and who later gained fame as author of Commerce of the Prairies, found Yell to be a “clever, pleasant, sociable fellow, but decidedly out of his element” as a military commander.|$|E
2500|$|This Spartan Life has a {{full cast}} of {{characters}}, each with their own unique qualities, which serve to move the show along. As is typical in machinima, the characters have very strong personalities and are heavily characterized {{in order to make}} up for the weakness of machinima: the inability to act. The host, Damian Lacedaemion, is a personable soldier in grey with a smiley face emblem adorning his armor. He leads the show with his carefree manner, and when his guests come under fire, he often has to fall back on his soldiering skills to save them. He tries to rise to a [...] "higher level of discourse" [...] and is the center of the civil nature of the show. Damian has a shotgun, named Phil, which can talk, and prefers to be used exclusively by Damian and will fight anyone attempting to use him without authorization. The show's DJ, DJ Octobit, is named in a reference to the 8-bit music he plays in the show. He creates the music for the show on his DJ console, which looks like a strange round pedestal. He never speaks, <b>yet</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> defended Damian on several occasions. [...] In the first episode he is referred to as Doctor Octobit, but later his name was changed to DJ Octobit. The show featured a co-host under the tag of d4rk5had0w other-wise known as K. He played a small role in the mini-series as a stand-up comedy Spartan but later left the show. The show also features the Solid Gold Elite Dancers (a reference to the 1980s television series Solid Gold). They usually dance to music by Glomag, the alias of Chris Burke, and a segment in the show is reserved for them.|$|E
