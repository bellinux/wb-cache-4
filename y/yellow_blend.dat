5000|$|The American Rose Society sets {{guidelines}} {{and standards for}} rose shows in the US (and for Canadian rose societies affiliated with the ARS) and is the International Cultivar Registration Authority for Roses by appointment of the International Society for Horticultural Sciences. [...] The Royal National Rose Society sets the {{guidelines and}} standards in the UK. Many Canadian and Australian rose societies are affiliated with the RNRS {{in addition to their}} own national societies. Rose shows using ARS guidelines use cultivar classifications assigned by the ARS, for instance Hybrid Tea or Gallica. [...] The ARS also assigns one of 18 official color classes to cultivars, for instance Light Yellow, Medium Yellow, Deep Yellow, and <b>Yellow</b> <b>Blend.</b> There is no color class for blue. Rose shows are hosted by local societies and may be organized as a local show, an ARS District show, or an ARS National show. Local shows generally require no registration or entry fees, while District and National shows do. All three levels of rose show generally offer three divisions: Challenge Classes, Horticulture, and Arrangements. Other divisions may be offered, for instance Rose Photography or Rose Crafts. Rose-themed Quilts have been included at rose shows. The Challenge Classes available vary between the local, District, and National levels.|$|E

5000|$|Mr. Stripey (sometimes {{confused}} with Tigerella) {{is a type}} of heirloom tomato with unusually small leaves and a mix of a yellow and red color that can fool some growers into thinking they are picking an unripe tomato. Under good conditions in size, shape and internal structure it may be considered a [...] "beefsteak".Tigerella is generally smaller than the Mr Stripey variety and the colors are less defined, they actually are two distinct different heirloom varieties.Tigerella isn't as sweet or [...] "low-acid" [...] as the Mr Stripey variety either. Like other heirlooms, Mr. Stripey has an appearance that differs considerably from other tomatoes. In coloration it is generally somewhat more yellow near the stem and more red towards its underside, with gentle stripes of red and <b>yellow</b> <b>blending</b> into each other along the sides. This coloration may extend into the interior of the fruit, which tends to be more yellow than red.|$|R

5000|$|The Horticulture {{division}} of a rose show consists of (usually) single specimens of roses - one 'Peace' rose in a vase, for instance. A few Horticulture classes call for multiple specimens, for instance 3 Stems Hybrid Tea, One Variety. In US shows, the Horticulture classes can be organized either alphabetically by name, i.e. 'Peace' would be exhibited under Hybrid Teas N-R; or by ARS color classes, i.e. 'Peace' would be exhibited under Hybrid Tea <b>Yellow</b> <b>Blends.</b> In some larger shows, popular varieties with many entries, such as 'Peace', may {{get their own}} class. The Challenge Classes division imposes special criteria on the exhibit, for instance Five Floribunda Sprays, Five Varieties, judged on both individual bloom quality and composition of the whole. There are five kinds of Challenge classes: multiple stems of multiple varieties of the same class; multiple stems of one variety; multiple stems of multiple classes; bloom progression (3 stems: bud, exhibition bloom, and open bloom with stamens showing); and English-style box (6 roses). [...] Other popular Challenge classes include Most Fragrant, Rose in a Photo Frame, Rose in a Bowl, and Artist's Palette (5 roses, different colors). The Arrangements division consists of floral arrangements in which roses predominate.|$|R

60|$|Wednesday, October 13th.--A good view, from an upland {{swell of}} our pasture, {{across the valley}} of the river Charles. There is the meadow, as level as a floor, and carpeted with green, perhaps two miles from the rising ground {{on this side of the}} river to that on the {{opposite}} side. The stream winds through the midst of the flat space, without any banks at all; for it fills its bed almost to the brim, and bathes the meadow grass on either side. A tuft of shrubbery, at broken intervals, is scattered along its border; and thus it meanders sluggishly along, without other life than what it gains from gleaming in the sun. Now, into the broad, smooth meadow, as into a lake, capes and headlands put themselves forth, and shores of firm woodland border it, covered with variegated foliage, making the contrast so much the stronger of their height and rough outline with the even spread of the plain. And beyond, and far away, rises a long, gradual swell of country, covered with an apparently dense growth of foliage for miles, till the horizon terminates it; and here and there is a house, or perhaps two, among the contiguity of trees. Everywhere the trees wear their autumnal dress, so that the whole landscape is red, russet, orange, and <b>yellow,</b> <b>blending</b> in the distance into a rich tint of brown-orange, or nearly that,--except the green expanse so definitely hemmed in by the higher ground.|$|R

50|$|Lethal alleles {{were first}} {{discovered}} by Lucien Cuénot in 1905 while studying the inheritance of coat colour in mice. The agouti gene in mice is {{largely responsible for}} determining coat colour. The wild-type allele produces a <b>blend</b> of <b>yellow</b> and black pigmentation in each hair of the mouse. This <b>yellow</b> and black <b>blend</b> may {{be referred to as}} 'agouti' in colour. One of the mutant alleles of the agouti gene results in mice with a much lighter, yellowish colour. When these yellow mice were crossed with homozygous wild-type mice, a 1:1 ratio of yellow and dark grey offspring were obtained. This indicated that the yellow mutation is dominant, and all the parental yellow mice were heterozygotes for the mutant allele.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} {{cementing}} materials are silica and calcium carbonate, {{which are often}} derived either from dissolution or from alteration of the sand after it was buried.

The regularity of the latter favours use {{as a source for}} masonry, either as a primary building material or as a facing stone, over other construction.|$|R
25|$|Outside the {{breeding}} season, and when food is locally abundant, the ducks may congregate in small flocks, sometimes {{of up to}} about a hundred.

40|$|Four Holstein steers (456 kg) {{fitted with}} cannulas in the rumen and {{proximal}} duodenum {{were used in}} a 4 x 4 Latin square design to evaluate the influence of substituting palmitic acid (Energizer?, IFFCO, EEU; 92 % C 16 : 0) for conventional feed fat (yellow grease) on characteristics of digestion and utilization of fat. Treatments were: 1) basal diet, no supplemental fat; 2) 5 % of yellow grease; 3) 2. 5 % of yellow grease and 2. 5 % palmitate and 4) 5 % palmitate. The basal diet contained (DMB) : alfalfa hay (40. 0 %), steam-flaked corn (43. 2 %), canola meal (7. 0 %), molasses (8. 0 %), and mineral supplement (1. 8 %). Fat treatments replaced steam-flaked corn in the basal diet. Total fatty acid intake for fat supplemented diets averaged 637 g/d. Inclusion of palmitate increased quantitatively (linear effect, P 0. 20) by fat supplementation. Fat supplementation increased (P 0. 20) on ruminal pH, VFA molar proportions, or estimated methane production. Calculated NEg for supplemental fats were 4. 53, 4. 83, and 4. 64 Mcal/kg for yellow grease, <b>yellow</b> grease-palmitate <b>blend,</b> and palmitate, respectively. Intestinal digestion of a supplemental fat consisting of 92 % palmitate is equivalent to that of yellow grease (conventional feed fat).

40|$|Two {{trials that}} {{utilized}} 356 steers {{were conducted to}} evaluate the effects of various fat sources (3. 596 of ration dry matter) on performance and carcass traits of finishing cattle fed flaked milo diets. In trial 1, soybean oil, bleachable tallow, and <b>yellow</b> grease (<b>blend</b> of tallow and restaurant grease) were compared to a nonfat control. Feeding fat increased (P<. 05) daily gain, feed efficiency, carcass weight, and dressing percent of steers. Soybean oil and yellow grease also tended to increase 12 th rib backfat thickness and marbling. Feed costs of gain were improved only by yellow grease. However, when increased carcass yield and quality were considered, {{there was a significant}} economic return from all fat sources. In trial 2, fat treatments were acidulated soybean soapstock (SBSS), tallow, a blend of 7096 SBSS: 3096 tallow, and yellow grease. Feeding tallow or the SBSS: tallow blend improved (P<. 05) feed efficiency by 7. 796 compared to the nonfat control. Pooled across source, feeding fat increased (P<. 10) backfat thickness and marbling. Compared to the control, feed cost of gain was reduced 6 cents/l b by the SBSS:tallow blend. However, when increased carcass value was accounted for, net returns of $ 3. 50 to $ 6. 00 per head were seen for SBSS, tallow, and SBSS:tallow priced at 13, 17, and 13 cents per lb, respectively. The SBSS:tallow blend provided greater performance than was predicted by observed performance of steers fed SBSS or tallow separately, an indication of associative response.

40|$|Lignin/lignin blends {{were used}} to improve fiber spinning, {{stabilization}} rates, and properties of lignin-based carbon fibers. Organosolv lignin from Alamo switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) and yellow poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera) were used as blends for making lignin-based carbon fibers. Different ratios of <b>yellow</b> poplar:switchgrass lignin <b>blends</b> were prepared (50 : 50, 75 : 25, and 85 : 15 w/w). Chemical composition and thermal properties of lignin samples were determined. Thermal properties of lignins were analyzed using thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry. Thermal analysis confirmed switchgrass and yellow poplar lignin form miscible blends, as a single glass transition was observed. Lignin fibers were produced via melt-spinning by twin-screw extrusion. Lignin fibers were thermostabilized at different rates and subsequently carbonized. Spinnability of switchgrass lignin markedly improved by <b>blending</b> with <b>yellow</b> poplar lignin. On the other hand, switchgrass lignin significantly improved thermostabilization performance of yellow poplar fibers, preventing fusion of fibers during fast stabilization and improving mechanical properties of fibers.

40|$|Nitride LED (e. g., GaN) {{has become}} the {{mainstream}} of blue light source. The blue light {{can be converted to}} white light by exciting a phosphor (e. g., Nichia's YAG or Osram's TAG) with the complementary yellow emission. However, GaN is typically deposited on sapphire (Al 2 O 3) substrates formed by crystal pulling or hexagonal (e. g., 4 H or 6 H) SiC wafers condensed from SiC vapor. In either case, the nitride lattice is ridden (e. g., 10 9 /cm 2) with dislocations. The high dislocation density with sapphire is due to the large (> 13 %) lattice mismatch; and with hexagonal SiC, because of intrinsic defects. Cubic (beta) SiC may be deposited epitaxially using a CVD reactor onto silicon wafer by diffusing the interface and by chemical gradation. A reactive echant (e. g., hydrogen or fluorine) can be introduced periodically to gasify mis-aligned atoms. In this case, large single crystal wafers would be available for the manufacture of high bright LED with superb electro-optical efficiency. The SiC wafer may be coated with diamond film that can eliminate heat in real time. As a result of lower temperature, the nitride LED can be brighter and it will last longer. The blue light of GaN LED formed on SiC on Diamond (SiCON) LED may also be scattered by using novel quantum dots (e. g., 33 atom pairs of CdSe) to form a broad <b>yellow</b> light that <b>blend</b> in with the original blue light to form sunlight-like white light.

40|$|Zeaxanthin-biofortified sweet-corn is {{a deeper}} golden-orange colour than regular yellow sweet-corn {{due to a}} greater ratio of orange {{carotenoids}} (zeaxanthin, β-cryptoxanthin and β-carotene) to yellow carotenoids (lutein, zeinoxanthin). Freshly-harvested zeaxanthin-biofortified and yellow corn-cobs were subjected to freezing  (- 20 °C) and assessed for colour-change (hue angle). Freezing kernels at - 20 °C was observed to significantly reduce hue angle by approximately 4 - 6 °, with decline slightly greater in zeaxanthin-biofortified kernels than in yellow kernels. Frozen kernel hue angle could be predicted by linear correlation with fresh kernel hue angle (r 2 = 0. 90). Carotenoid-analysis of zeaxanthin-biofortified and yellow corn confirmed no significant change in carotenoid profile due to freezing, apart from slight changes to antheraxanthin, β-cryptoxanthin and β-carotene. This indicates that colour changes {{may be due to}} physical, rather than chemical changes. In order to investigate if cell membrane disruption was the cause of colour change, fresh kernels of zeaxanthin-biofortified and <b>yellow</b> sweet-corn were <b>blended</b> into a slurry, and hue angle measured after freezing to - 20 °C. Decline in hue angle was similar to that of intact kernels, indicating membrane disruption was unlikely to be responsible. Fresh cobs were subsequently subjected to freezing and subsequent thawing. Thawing to room-temperature resulted in a reversal of hue angle to the original values of fresh kernels. The results indicate that colour change due to freezing {{may be due to the}} formation of ice-crystals, possibly interfering with light absorption, as the effect disappeared once the ice-crystals had melted. Rapid freezing with liquid nitrogen had less effect on hue angle than freezing at - 20 °C, indicating that ice-crystal size may also play a role. The observation of why orange cobs are affected more than yellow cobs remains to be elucidated...|$|R
