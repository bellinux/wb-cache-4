25|$|Little {{variation}} occurs {{among individuals}} of P. dominula; the wing lengths of males range from 9.5 to 13.0mm, while those of females range from 8.5 to 12.0mm.

The female mandible is black and sometimes has a <b>yellow</b> <b>spot.</b> Females have a black subantennal mark that rarely has a pair of small, <b>yellow</b> <b>spots.</b> The female vertex sometimes has a pair of small, <b>yellow</b> <b>spots</b> behind the hind ocelli.

40|$|The use of {{fungicides}} {{to control}} <b>yellow</b> <b>spot</b> in wheat, caused by Pyrenophora tritici-repentis, {{in the northern}} wheat region of Australia, was examined in three field experiments. Field conditions were conducive to disease development. This was aided by spreading stubble infested with P. tritici-repentis and by regular spray irrigations, and moderate <b>yellow</b> <b>spot</b> epidemics resulted in all 3 years. Within the three experiments, 12 fungicides were evaluated {{for their ability to}} reduce the impact of <b>yellow</b> <b>spot</b> on grain yield. Single spray applications of the fungicides, some at varying rates, were made at 90...|$|R

50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 13 mm. The forewings are yellowish-white, with two diffused <b>yellow</b> <b>spots</b> {{at the base}} of the cell and a prolonged <b>yellow</b> <b>spot</b> at the corner of the cell, as well as brown scales along the costal margin. The hindwings are light grey. Adults are on wing in late July.|$|R
40|$|The aim was {{to study}} the {{progress}} of the <b>yellow</b> <b>spot,</b> brown spot and leaf rust in wheat cultivar FUNDACEP 50 in Passo Fundo. Was evaluated the incidence of <b>yellow</b> <b>spot</b> [Drechslera tritici-repentis (Died) Drechs. ] brown spot [Bipolaris sorokiniana (Sacc.) ] and leaf rust [Puccinia triticina (Eriks) ]. Values obtained were integralized as Area Under the Disease Incidence Progress Curve (AUDIPC) and to analyze {{the progress of the}} disease was considered the disease progress rate (r), which was obtained with the Logistic and Gompertz. Determination coefficients were high (0. 93 to 0. 98), as well as the mean square error (4. 0706 to 7. 6831). The r were 0. 02 to 0. 22 units, while the accumulated AUDIPC 787. 5, 1216. 3 and 1338. 8 units for <b>yellow</b> <b>spot,</b> brown spot and leaf rust, respectively. The two models used satisfactorily explain the progress of <b>yellow</b> <b>spot</b> and brown spot, while the Gompertz explains better leaf rust...|$|R
