50|$|It is {{characterized}} by a <b>yoke</b> <b>design</b> - that is, a wide decorative circle surrounding the neck opening. The sweater is knitted in a non-varying circle, meaning that there is no difference between the front and the back, unless a zipper is added. The body of the sweater is knitted using circular needles, while 'the sleeves are picked up onto the needle containing the bodice. The shaping of the shoulders by gradually casting off is incorporated into the pattern of the yoke'. The yarn used, lopi, is made from the wool of Icelandic sheep and contains both wind hairs and fleece. Lopi is remarkable in that it is not spun, so it contains more air than spun yarn and as a consequence it has better insulation properties. This also makes lopi more difficult to handle than spun yarn, in particular for those new to the material. Icelandic wool has earned an international reputation for its warmth, lightness and insulation abilities so that even when wet, it keeps you warm.|$|E

40|$|Feasibility {{of single}} turn {{extraction}} in a high-field separated sector cyclotron has been accessed.

40|$|A {{number of}} studies have shown that {{exposure}} to high doses of methamphetamine (MA) is toxic to central dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5 -HT) neurons. In most of those studies, however, high doses of MA were experimenter-administered during a short exposure time. Because contingency is a determinant for many effects of drug exposure, the present objective was to investigate the effects of self-administered MA on tissue monoamine levels following a short (24 hours) or longer (7 days) withdrawal period. As previously reported, a noncontingent "binge" high-dose treatment regimen (4 injections of 10 mg/kg MA administered every 2 hours) produced persistent depletion of cortical 5 -HT and striatal DA. Effects of self-administered MA (0. 1 mg/kg/infusion) were then determined following a 20 -day duration where a <b>yoked</b> <b>design</b> was employed such that some rats received MA contingent on an operant lever press and others received either MA or saline dependent on the responses of the contingent rat.

Similar charts can be calculated for any existing or non-existing bell and used when designing its mounting and propulsion. Moreover, we propose simple and universal launching procedure that allows to decrease the time that is needed to reach given attractor.

40|$|Three yoking {{systems are}} used {{globally}} {{to capture the}} power of oxen. These are the head yoke, withers yoke, and neck yoke.

The neck yoke system offers important lessons in understanding animal comfort and <b>yoke</b> <b>design.</b> Despite its success, the neck yoke should not be universally adopted, nor should it be universally promoted.

40|$|We {{describe}} the rationale, concept, {{design and implementation}} of a fixed-motion (non-adjustable) mechanism for insect-like flapping wing micro air vehicles in hover, inspired by two-winged flies (Diptera). This spatial (as opposed to planar) mechanism {{is based on the}} novel idea of a double spherical Scotch yoke. The mechanism was constructed for two main purposes: (i) as a test bed for aeromechanical research on hover in flapping flight, and (ii) as a precursor design for a future flapping wing micro air vehicle. Insects fly by oscillating (plunging) and rotating (pitching) their wings through large angles, while sweeping them forwards and backwards. During this motion the wing tip approximately traces a ‘figure-of-eight’ or a ‘banana’ and the wing changes the angle of attack (pitching) significantly. The kinematic and aerodynamic data from free-flying insects are sparse and uncertain, and {{it is not clear what}} aerodynamic consequences different wing motions have. Since acquiring the necessary kinematic and dynamic data from biological experiments remains a challenge, a synthetic, controlled study of insect-like flapping is not only of engineering value, but also of biological relevance. Micro air vehicles are defined as flying vehicles approximately 150  mm in size (hand-held), weighing 50 – 100  g, and are developed to reconnoitre in confined spaces (inside buildings, tunnels, etc.). For this application, insect-like flapping wings are an attractive solution and hence the need to realize the functionality of insect flight by engineering means. Since the semi-span of the insect wing is constant, the kinematics are spatial; in fact, an approximate figure-of-eight/banana is traced on a sphere. Hence a natural mechanism implementing such kinematics should be (i) spherical and (ii) generate mathematically convenient curves expressing the figure-of-eight/banana shape. The double spherical Scotch <b>yoke</b> <b>design</b> has property (i) by definition and achieves (ii) by tracing spherical Lissajous curves...|$|E
40|$|Draught animal {{technology}} is a reliable and popular farm power resource in most developing countries. However, despite its growing popularity, animal traction farmers face several constraints such as rapid ploughshare wear, high draught forces and poor design of harnesses and other implements. Also, farmers and researchers have placed little emphasis {{on the importance of}} draught animal welfare issues. The main objective of the thesis was to study the performance of draught animal-implement system to improve productivity and welfare. The specific objectives were to: (i) develop and test cast steel ploughshares for abrasive wear rate and perform comparative analysis; (ii) investigate optimum cutting edge thicknesses in relation to draught force and heart rates of work animals; (iii) analyse the effects of <b>yoke</b> <b>design</b> and loading transport implements on the productivity, comfort and welfare of oxen and camels; (iv) investigate the maximum loads that a camel can pull with carts and sledges without compromising its welfare. The methodologies adopted were laboratory investigations into ploughshare chemical composition, hardness and production methods, cast steel share development, and field-testing of shares, yokes and transport implements. The following conclusions were drawn from the study: (i) The newly developed cast steel shares were equally durable as the imported versions, and more durable than the local blacksmith forged shares (ii) The 2 - 4 mm share thicknesses emerged as the optimum share cutting edges that developed the least resistant forces and minimum stresses (lowest heart rates) when pulled by the animals. (iii) The yoke designs, which have increased contact areas in the animal's neck regions were more comfortable than the traditional yokes that have small contact points on the animals. (iv) At nearly constant walking speeds, the maximum loads camels pulled with cart and sledge were 5620 N and 2490 N, which were 119 - 143 % of their body weights and equivalent to 53 - 64 % pull/live weight ratios. The average pull/live weight ratios for the three camels ranged from 29 - 51 % and 15 - 30 % for cart and sledge, respectively, making the camels to perform nearly twice transport work in pulling loaded carts compared with pulling loaded sledges The concept of performance index is introduced to evaluate draught animal power performance...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{illusion}} of control consists of overestimating {{the influence that}} our behavior exerts over uncontrollable outcomes. Available evidence suggests that {{an important factor in}} development of this illusion is the personal involvement of participants who are trying to obtain the outcome. The dominant view assumes that this is due to social motivations and self-esteem protection. We propose that {{this may be due to}} a bias in contingency detection which occurs when the probability of the action (i. e., of the potential cause) is high. Indeed, personal involvement might have been often confounded with the probability of acting, as participants who are more involved tend to act more frequently than those for whom the outcome is irrelevant and therefore become mere observers. We tested these two variables separately. In two experiments, the outcome was always uncontrollable and we used a <b>yoked</b> <b>design</b> in which the participants of one condition were actively involved in obtaining it and the participants in the other condition observed the adventitious cause-effect pairs. The results support the latter approach: Those acting more often to obtain the outcome developed stronger illusions, and so did their yoked counterparts...|$|R
